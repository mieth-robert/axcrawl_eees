Title: Dirac-Schwinger Quantization for Emergent Magnetic Monopoles?
Authors: A. Farhan (1), M. Saccone (2), B.F.L. Ward (1) ((1) Baylor University, Waco, TX, USA, (2) Croputation, Santa Fe, NM, USA)
Abstract: In Refs.[1-4] Dirac and Schwinger showed the existence of a magnetic monopole required a charge quantization condition which we write following Dirac as $\frac{eg}{4\pi\hbar}=\frac{n}{2},\; n=0,\pm 1,\; \pm 2, \ldots$. Here, $g$ is the magnetic monopole charge and $e$ is the electric charge of the positron. Recently, in Refs. [5,6], it has been shown experimentally that frustrated spin-ice systems exhibit 'emergent' magnetic monopoles. We show that, within the experimental errors, the respective magnetic charges obey the Dirac-Schwinger quantization condition. Possible implications are discussed.

Title: The effects of Repulsive Biquadratic Interactions in a Blume-Emery-Griffiths Spin-Glass with Competing, Attractive Biquadratic Cross-link Interactions
Authors: Daniel P. Snowman
Abstract: A BEG Hamiltonian is used to model an Ising spin glass with annealed vacancies on a hierarchical lattice. In addition to competing bilinear interactions, repulsive biquadratic interactions on the perimeter of our unit structures compete with attractive cross-link interactions. Ordering and transitions in this system are probed by generating several phase diagrams, using renormalization group methods, for a range of constant K/J. A physical interpretation is offered for each sink corresponding to a bulk phase in phase space and critical exponents are calculated for the higher-order transitions.

Title: Topological quantized edge-pumping-spin flip in Rice-Mele model with spin-orbit coupling
Authors: E. S. Ma, Z. Song
Abstract: The quantized Thouless pumping charge in a spinless Rice-Mele (RM) model originates from a degeneracy point in the parameter space and cannot be detected when open boundary conditions are applied. In this work, we investigate the topological features of a spinful Rice-Mele (RM) model. We demonstrate that spin-orbit coupling facilitates the transition of a single degenerate point into a degenerate loop, which is anticipated to be the source of the topological characteristics. When periodic boundary conditions are considered, we find that the pumping spin is zero for an adiabatic loop within the nodal loop and is 2 (in units of $\hbar /2$) for an adiabatic passage enclosing the nodal loop. When open boundary conditions are considered, the boundary-bulk correspondence is demonstrated by quantized pumping-spin flips at the edges, which can be obtained by completing double periods of a closed passage, rather than a single cycle. Our findings reveal an alternative dynamic manifestation of the boundary-bulk correspondence.

Title: Probing the collective excitations of excitonic insulators in an optical cavity
Authors: Elahe Davari, Mehdi Kargarian
Abstract: The light--matter interaction in optical cavities offers a promising ground to create hybrid states and manipulate material properties. In this work, we examine the effect of light-matter coupling in the excitonic insulator phase using a quasi one-dimensional lattice model with two opposite parity orbitals at each site. We show that the model allows for a coupling between the collective phase mode and cavity photons. Our findings reveal that the collective mode of the excitonic state significantly impacts the dispersion of the cavity mode, giving rise to an avoiding band crossing in the photon dispersion. This phenomenon is absent in trivial and topological insulator phases and also in phonon-mediated excitonic insulators, underscoring the unique characteristics of collective excitations in excitonic insulators. Our results demonstrate the significant impact of light-matter interaction on photon propagation in the presence of excitonic collective excitations.

Title: Resonant X-ray spectroscopies on Chromium 3\textit{d} orbitals in CrSBr
Authors: Victor Porée, Alberto Zobelli, Amit Pawbake, Jakub Regner, Zdenek Sofer, Clément Faugeras, Alessandro Nicolaou
Abstract: We investigate the Cr electronic structure and excitations in CrSBr, a layered magnetic semiconductor, using a combination of resonant x-ray spectroscopic techniques. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) spectra collected at the Cr $L_{2,3}$ edges reveal significant linear dichroism, which arises from the distorted octahedral environment surrounding the Cr$^{3+}$ ions. The origin of the bright excitons observed in this compound is examined through a comparison of the d-d excitations identified in the RIXS spectra, the x-ray excited optical luminescence (XEOL) spectra, and previously reported optical spectroscopic and theoretical studies. To further understand these phenomena, we develop a multiplet model based on a crystal electric field (CEF) approach that accounts for the local environment of Cr ions. This model successfully reproduces several experimental features, while also suggesting strong hybridization effects between Cr 3\textit{d} orbitals and ligands that are not fully captured by the present framework. These findings advance our understanding of the electronic structure and excitonic behavior in CrSBr and provide a foundation for future $\textit{in-situ}$ and $\textit{operando}$ studies of CrSBr-based devices for spintronic and optoelectronic applications.

Title: Role of asymmetry in thermoelectric properties of a double quantum dot out of equilibrium
Authors: Diego Perez Daroca, Pablo Roura-Bas, Armando A. Aligia
Abstract: We investigate the thermoelectric properties of a double quantum dot system coupled to two metallic reservoirs, focusing on two main effects: (i) the influence of coupling asymmetry between the quantum dot and the reservoirs on the Seebeck coefficient, and (ii) the impact of asymmetry in the energy levels of the dots on current rectification. In the first case, we find that introducing moderate asymmetry significantly enhances the Seebeck coefficient. In the second case, while rectification vanishes when the energy levels are degenerate, substantial rectification is achieved when one energy level lies below and the other above the Fermi level. We further interpret the dependence of rectification magnitude and shape on system parameters using analytical results from a spinless model.

Title: Microscopic structure and dynamics of shear-thinning suspensions of polydisperse, repulsive vesicles
Authors: Nikolaos Kolezakis, Stefano Aime, Raffaele Pastore, Vincenzo Guida, Gaetano D Avino, Paolo Edera
Abstract: We investigate the rheology, microscopic structure, and dynamics of an industrially relevant dispersion made of cationic surfactant vesicles, from dilute to concentrated conditions. We find that these suspensions exhibit a shear-thinning behavior at relatively low concentrations. At the microscale, this corresponds to a well-defined transition in both the structure, marked by the appearance of a peak in the static structure factor, and the dynamics, which slow down and develop a two-step decay in the correlation functions. This low-concentration transition is particularly surprising in light of experiments showing that for surfactant vesicles of similar composition the interactions should be purely repulsive. This leads us to propose that the observed structural and dynamic transition could arise, as an entropic effect, from the large sample polydispersity coupled to crowding. The shear-thinning behavior is thus interpreted as the nonlinear response of this transient structure to the imposed flow. Our work suggests that similar effects might be a generic feature of dense, highly polydisperse charged suspensions.

Title: Phase diagram, confining strings, and a new universality class in nematopolar matter
Authors: Farzan Vafa, Amin Doostmohammadi
Abstract: We study a minimal model of a system with coexisting nematic and polar orientational orders, where one field tends to order and the other prefers isotropy. For strong coupling, the ordered field aligns the isotropic one, locking their orientations. The phase diagram reveals three distinct phases--nematopolar (aligned orders), nematic (independent orders), and isotropic (vanishing orders)--separated by continuous and discontinuous transitions, including a triple and a tricritical point. We find unique critical scaling for the nematopolar-nematic transition, distinct from standard nematic or polar universality classes. Additionally, in the locked nematopolar phase, we show nematic $+1/2$ topological defect pairs are connected and confined by strings with constant tension. These strings arise from frustration in locking the orientational orders and can be interpreted as elongated cores of $+1$ polar topological defects. When a sufficiently strong background field couples to the polar order, all topological defects are expelled from the region. Analytical predictions are quantitatively confirmed by numerical simulations.

Title: Spectroscopy of the Fractal Hofstadter Energy Spectrum
Authors: Kevin P. Nuckolls, Michael G. Scheer, Dillon Wong, Myungchul Oh, Ryan L. Lee, Jonah Herzog-Arbeitman, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Biao Lian, Ali Yazdani
Abstract: Hofstadter's butterfly, the predicted energy spectrum for non-interacting electrons confined to a two-dimensional lattice in a magnetic field, is one of the most remarkable fractal structures in nature. At rational ratios of magnetic flux quanta per lattice unit cell, this spectrum shows self-similar distributions of energy levels that reflect its recursive construction. For most materials, Hofstadter's butterfly is predicted under experimental conditions that are unachievable using laboratory-scale magnetic fields. More recently, electrical transport studies have provided evidence for Hofstadter's butterfly in materials engineered to have artificially large lattice constants, such as those with moiré superlattices. Yet to-date, direct spectroscopy of the fractal energy spectrum predicted by Hofstadter nearly 50 years ago has remained out of reach. Here we use high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy / spectroscopy (STM / STS) to probe the flat electronic bands in twisted bilayer graphene near the predicted second magic angle, an ideal setting for spectroscopic studies of Hofstadter's spectrum. Our study shows the fractionalization of flat moiré bands into discrete Hofstadter subbands and discerns experimental signatures of self-similarity of this spectrum. Moreover, our measurements uncover a spectrum that evolves dynamically with electron density, displaying phenomena beyond that of Hofstadter's original model due to the combined effects of strong correlations, Coulomb interactions, and the quantum degeneracy of electrons in twisted bilayer graphene.

Title: A phase-field model for DNA self-assembly
Authors: Marco Cappa, Francesco Sciortino, Lorenzo Rovigatti
Abstract: We present a phase-field model based on the Cahn-Hilliard equation to investigate the kinetics of phase separation in DNA nanostar systems. Leveraging a realistic free-energy functional derived from Wertheim theory, our model captures the thermodynamic and dynamic properties of self-assembling DNA nanostars under various conditions. This approach allows for the study of both one-component and multi-component systems, including mixtures of different nanostar species and cross-linkers. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate the model ability to replicate experimental observations, including liquid-liquid phase separation, surface tension variation, and the structural organization of multi-component systems. Our results highlight the versatility and predictive power of the Cahn-Hilliard framework, particularly for complex systems where detailed simulations are computationally prohibitive. This work provides a robust foundation for studying DNA-based materials and their potential applications in nanotechnology and biophysics, including liquid-liquid phase separation in cellular environments.

Title: Phase Transitions in Quasi-Periodically Driven Quantum Critical Systems: Analytical Results
Authors: Jiyuan Fang, Qi Zhou, Xueda Wen
Abstract: In this work, we study analytically the phase transitions in quasi-periodically driven one dimensional quantum critical systems that are described by conformal field theories (CFTs). The phase diagrams and phase transitions can be analytically obtained by using Avila's global theory in one-frequency quasiperiodic cocycles. Compared to the previous works where the quasiperiodicity was introduced in the driving time and no phase transitions were observed [1], here we propose a setup where the quasiperiodicity is introduced in the driving Hamiltonians. In our setup, one can observe the heating phases, non-heating phases, and the phase transitions. The phase diagram as well as the Lyapunov exponents that determine the entanglement entropy evolution can be analytically obtained. In addition, based on Avila's theory, we prove there is no phase transition in the previously proposed setup of quasi-periodically driven CFTs [1]. We verify our field theory results by studying the time evolution of entanglement entropy on lattice models.

Title: Rotational magnetoelastic interactions in the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya magnet Ba$_2$CuGe$_2$O$_7$
Authors: J. Sourd, T. Kotte, P. Wild, S. Mühlbauer, J. Wosnitza, S. Zherlitsyn
Abstract: We report the magnetoelastic properties of a Ba$_2$CuGe$_2$O$_7$ single crystal at low temperatures under a magnetic field applied along the crystallographic [001] axis. Our results extend to low temperature the $H-T$ phase diagram determined for this compound by neutron scattering. Furthermore, we observe that specific elastic modes are better sensitive to the various magnetic transitions. In particular, we observe an unusual coupling between the in-plane transverse acoustic mode and the cycloidal order at low field, which suggests a novel spin-strain mechanism originating from Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in this compound.

Title: Giant Kohn anomaly and chiral phonons in the charge density wave phase of 1H-NbSe$_2$
Authors: Susy Exists, Sougata Mardanya, Robert Markiewicz, Tugrul Hakioglu, Jouko Nieminen, Ville J. Härkönen, Cem Sanga, Arun Bansil, Sugata Chowdhury
Abstract: Despite extensive investigations, many aspects of charge density waves (CDWs) remain elusive, especially the relative roles of electron-phonon coupling and Fermi surface nesting as the underlying driving mechanisms responsible for the emergence of the CDW vector $\bl Q_{CDW}$. It is puzzling that even though electrons interact strongly with optical phonons in many correlated systems, the actual mode softening is of an acoustic mode. Here we consider monolayer 1H-NbSe$_2$ as an exemplar system, and through an accurate computation of the phonon self-energy, including its off-diagonal components. We provide compelling evidence that the relevant mode is a longitudinal optical phonon that softens by anti-crossing several intervening phonon bands. We also show that $\bl Q_{CDW}$ is fixed by the convolution of the susceptibility and electron-phonon coupling, and that the softened phonons are circularly polarized.

Title: Intrinsic Direct Air Capture
Authors: Austin McDannald, Daniel W. Siderius, Brian DeCost, Kamal Choudhary, Diana L. Ortiz-Montalvo
Abstract: We present new metrics to evaluate solid sorbent materials for Direct Air Capture (DAC). These new metrics provide a theoretical upper bound on CO2 captured per energy as well as a theoretical upper limit on the purity of the captured CO2. These new metrics are based entirely on intrinsic material properties and are therefore agnostic to the design of the DAC system. These metrics apply to any adsorption-refresh cycle design. In this work we demonstrate the use of these metrics with the example of temperature-pressure swing refresh cycles. The main requirement for applying these metrics is to describe the equilibrium uptake (along with a few other materials properties) of each species in terms of the thermodynamic variables (e.g. temperature, pressure). We derive these metrics from thermodynamic energy balances. To apply these metrics on a set of examples, we first generated approximations of the necessary materials properties for 11 660 metal-organic framework materials (MOFs). We find that the performance of the sorbents is highly dependent on the path through thermodynamic parameter space. These metrics allow for: 1) finding the optimum materials given a particular refresh cycle, and 2) finding the optimum refresh cycles given a particular sorbent. Applying these metrics to the database of MOFs lead to the following insights: 1) start cold - the equilibrium uptake of CO2 diverges from that of N2 at lower temperatures, and 2) selectivity of CO2 vs other gases at any one point in the cycle does not matter - what matters is the relative change in uptake along the cycle.

Title: Training Allostery-Inspired Mechanical Response in Disordered Elastic Networks
Authors: Savannah D. Gowen
Abstract: Disordered elastic networks are a model material system in which it is possible to achieve tunable and trainable functions. This work investigates the modification of local mechanical properties in disordered networks inspired by allosteric interactions in proteins: applying strain locally to a set of source nodes triggers a strain response at a distant set of target nodes. This is demonstrated first by using directed aging to modify the existing mechanical coupling between pairs of distant source and target nodes, and later as a means for inducing coupling between formerly isolated source-target pairs. The experimental results are compared with those predicted by simulations.

Title: Direct measurement of the longitudinal exciton dispersion in hBN by resonant inelastic x-ray scattering
Authors: Alessandro Nicolaou, Kari Ruotsalainen, Laura Susana, Victor Porée, Luiz Galvao Tizei, Jaakko Koskelo, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Alberto Zobelli, Matteo Gatti
Abstract: We report resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) measurements on the prototypical hexagonal boron nitride hBN layered compound. The RIXS results at the B and N K edges have been combined with electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) experiments and ab initio calculations within the framework of the Bethe-Salpeter equation of many-body perturbation theory. By means of this tight interplay of different spectroscopies, the lowest longitudinal exciton of hBN has been identified. Moreover, its qualitatively different dispersions along the $\Gamma$K and the $\Gamma$M directions of the Brillouin zone have been determined. Our study advocates soft X-ray RIXS and EELS to be a promising combination to investigate electronic excitations in materials.

Title: Finite-Size Effects in Aging can be Interpreted as Sub-Aging
Authors: Henrik Christiansen, Suman Majumder, Wolfhard Janke, Malte Henkel
Abstract: Systems brought out of equilibrium through a rapid quench from a disordered initial state into an ordered phase undergo physical aging in the form of phase-ordering kinetics, with characteristic dynamical scaling. In many systems, notably glasses, dynamical scaling is often described through sub-aging, where a phenomenological sub-aging exponent $0<\mu< 1$ is empirically chosen to achieve the best possible data collapse. Here it is shown that finite-size effects modify the dynamical scaling behavior, away from simple aging with $\mu=1$ towards $\mu<1$, such that phenomenologically it would appear as sub-aging. This is exemplified for the exactly solved dynamical spherical model in dimensions $2<d<4$ and numerical simulations of the two-dimensional Ising model, with short-ranged and long-ranged interactions.

Title: Time Symmetries of Quantum Memory Improve Thermodynamic Efficiency
Authors: Alexander B. Boyd, Paul M. Riechers
Abstract: Classical computations inherently require energy dissipation that increases significantly as the reliability of the computation improves. This dissipation arises when transitions between memory states are not balanced by their time-reversed counterparts. While classical memories exhibit a discrete set of possible time-reversal symmetries, quantum memory offers a continuum. This continuum enables the design of quantum memories that minimize irreversibility. As a result, quantum memory reduces energy dissipation several orders of magnitude below classical memory.

Title: Quantifying and Visualizing the Microscopic Degrees of Freedom of Grain Boundaries in the Wigner-Seitz Cell of the Displacement-Shift-Complete Lattice
Authors: Ian S. Winter, Timofey Frolov
Abstract: We introduce a grain boundary (GB) translation vector, $\textbf{t}^{WS}$, to describe and quantify the domain of the microscopic degrees of freedom of GBs. It has long been recognized that for fixed macroscopic degrees of freedom of a GB there exists a large multiplicity of states characterized by different relative grain translations. More recently another degree of freedom, $[n]$, the number of GB atoms, has emerged and is now recognized as an equally important component of GB structural multiplicity. In this work, we show that all GB microstates can be uniquely characterized by their value of $\textbf{t}^{WS}$, which is located within the Wigner-Seitz (WS) cell of the Displacement-Shift-Complete lattice (DSCL) of the GB. The GB translation vector captures information about both the translation state and the number of GB atoms. We show that the density of GB microstates inside the cell of the DSCL is not uniform and can form clusters that correspond to different GB phases. The vectors connecting the centers of the clusters correspond to the Burgers vectors of GB phase junctions, which can be predicted without building the junctions. Using $\textbf{t}^{WS}$, we quantify GB excess shear and argue that it is defined up to a DSCL vector, which has implications for thermodynamic equilibrium conditions. Additionally, this work generalizes the definition of the number of GB atoms $[n]$ to asymmetric boundaries.

Title: Energy filtering-induced ultrahigh thermoelectric power factors in Ni$_3$Ge
Authors: Fabian Garmroudi, Simone Di Cataldo, Michael Parzer, Jennifer Coulter, Yutaka Iwasaki, Matthias Grasser, Simon Stockinger, Stephan Pázmán, Sandra Witzmann, Alexander Riss, Herwig Michor, Raimund Podloucky, Sergii Khmelevskyi, Antoine Georges, Karsten Held, Takao Mori, Ernst Bauer, Andrej Pustogow
Abstract: Traditional thermoelectric materials rely on low thermal conductivity to enhance their efficiency but suffer from inherently limited power factors. Novel pathways to optimize electronic transport are thus crucial. Here, we achieve ultrahigh power factors in Ni$_3$Ge through a new materials design principle. When overlapping flat and dispersive bands are engineered to the Fermi level, charge carriers can undergo intense interband scattering, yielding an energy filtering effect similar to what has long been predicted in certain nanostructured materials. Via a multi-step DFT-based screening method developed herein, we discover a new family of L1$_2$-ordered binary compounds with ultrahigh power factors up to 11 mW m$^{-1}$ K$^{-2}$ near room temperature, which are driven by an intrinsic phonon-mediated energy filtering mechanism. Our comprehensive experimental and theoretical study of these new intriguing materials paves the way for understanding and designing high-performance scattering-tuned metallic thermoelectrics.

Title: Lifshitz transition and triplet $p$-wave pairing from the induced ferromagnetic plaquette via spin differentiated nonlocal interaction
Authors: Rayan Farid, Daria Gazizova, B. D. E. McNiven, J. P. F. LeBlanc
Abstract: We study the two-dimensional extended Hubbard model on a square lattice and incorporate spin-differentiated nearest neighbor (NN) interactions where the equal-spin ($V_{uu}$) and unequal-spin ($V_{ud}$) terms are independently tuned parameters. We compute single-particle excitations as well as static spin and pairing susceptibilities perturbatively up to the fourth order within the thermodynamic limit and at a finite fixed temperature. By explicitly encoding a ferromagnetic-like NN interaction ($V_{uu} < V_{ud}$), we induce a competition among the uniform $q = (0,0)$, collinear $q = (\pi,0)$, and staggered $q = (\pi,\pi)$ spin excitations. This results in the formation of short-ranged $2\times 2$ ferromagnetic plaquettes arranged in staggered or striped patterns. Kinetic frustration in hopping, both within and between these plaquettes, manifests in single-particle properties, resulting in a reduction of bandwidth and ultimately triggering a Lifshitz transition to quasi-one-dimensional bands. Furthermore, an attractive effective interaction within the localized ferromagnetic plaquette results in the emergence of equal-spin triplet $p$-wave pairing. We demonstrate that sufficiently strong magnetic fluctuations, even at finite length scales, can significantly influence single-particle and pairing properties without breaking translational symmetry. Our approach provides a novel pathway to realize a variety of rich magnetic phases and Fermi surface reconstruction driven by interactions in the absence of explicit geometric frustration.

Title: Stability of a passive viscous droplet in a confined active nematic liquid crystal
Authors: Tanumoy Dhar, Michael J. Shelley, David Saintillan
Abstract: The translation and shape deformations of a passive viscous Newtonian droplet immersed in an active nematic liquid crystal under circular confinement are analyzed using a linear stability analysis. We focus on the case of a sharply aligned active nematic in the limit of strong elastic relaxation in two dimensions. Using an active liquid crystal model, we employ the Lorentz reciprocal theorem for Stokes flow to study the growth of interfacial perturbations as a result of both active and elastic stresses. Instabilities are uncovered in both extensile and contractile systems, for which growth rates are calculated and presented in terms of the dimensionless ratios of active, elastic, and capillary stresses, as well as the viscosity ratio between the two fluids. We also extend our theory to analyze the inverse scenario, namely, the stability of an active nematic droplet surrounded by a passive viscous layer. Our results highlight the subtle interplay of capillary, active, elastic, and viscous stresses in governing droplet stability. The instabilities uncovered here may be relevant to a plethora of biological active systems, from the dynamics of passive droplets in bacterial suspensions to the organization of subcellular compartments inside the cell and cell nucleus.

Title: A Cold Tracer in a Hot Bath: In and Out of Equilibrium
Authors: Amer Al-Hiyasat, Sunghan Ro, Julien Tailleur
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a zero-temperature overdamped tracer in a bath of Brownian particles. As the bath density is increased, the passive tracer transitions from an effectively active dynamics, characterized by boundary accumulation and ratchet currents, to a bona-fide equilibrium regime. To account for this, we eliminate the bath degrees of freedom under the assumption of linear coupling to the tracer and show convergence to equilibrium in the large density limit. We then develop a perturbation theory to characterize the tracer's departure from equilibrium at large but finite bath densities, revealing an intermediate time-reversible yet non-Boltzmann regime, followed by a fully irreversible one. Finally, we show that when the bath particles are connected as a lattice, mimicking a gel, the cold tracer drives the entire bath out of equilibrium, leading to a long-ranged suppression of bath fluctuations.

Title: Adiabatic Pumping of Orbital Magnetization by Spin Precession
Authors: Yafei Ren, Wenqin Chen, Chong Wang, Ting Cao, Di Xiao
Abstract: We propose adiabatic pumping of orbital magnetization driven by coherent spin precession, facilitating the rectification of this precession. The orbital magnetization originates from the adiabatic evolution of valence electrons with a topological bulk contribution expressed as a Chern-Simons form. When the precession cone angle of spin $\bm{S}$ is small, the resulting magnetization is proportional to $\bm{S}\times \dot{\bm{S}}$, contributing to the magnon Zeeman effect. With a large cone angle, the magnetization can reach its natural unit, $e/T$, in an antiferromagnetic topological insulator with $e$ as the elementary charge and $T$ as the precession period. This significant magnetization is related to the global properties of the electronic geometric phases in the parameter space spanned by $\bm{S}$ and momentum $\bm{k}$. When the pumped magnetization is inhomogeneous, induced by spin textures or electronic topological phase domains, a dissipationless charge current is also pumped. At last, we discuss the boundary contributions from the spin-driving edge states, which are intricately linked to the gauge-dependent quantum uncertainty of the Chern-Simons form.

Title: Charge sensing of few-electron ZnO double quantum dots probed by radio-frequency reflectometry
Authors: Kosuke Noro, Motoya Shinozaki, Yusuke Kozuka, Kazuma Matsumura, Yoshihiro Fujiwara, Takeshi Kumasaka, Atsushi Tsukazaki, Masashi Kawasaki, Tomohiro Otsuka
Abstract: Zinc oxide (ZnO) has garnered much attention as a promising material for quantum devices due to its unique characteristics. To utilize the potential of ZnO for quantum devices, the development of fundamental technological elements such as high-speed readout and charge sensing capabilities has become essential. In this study, we address these challenges by demonstrating radio-frequency (rf) reflectometry and charge sensing in ZnO quantum dots, thus advancing the potential for qubit applications. A device is fabricated on a high-quality ZnO heterostructure, featuring gate-defined target and sensor quantum dots. The sensor dot, integrated into an rf resonator circuit, enables the detection of single-electron charges in the target dots. Using this setup, the formation of few-electron double quantum dots is observed by obtaining their charge stability diagram. Also, a charge stability diagram with a gate pulse sequence is measured. We discuss the strong electron correlation in ZnO, which leads to nearly degenerate spin-singlet and -triplet two-electron states in the (0, 2) charge state, and the perspectives on spin-state readout.

Title: Universal Turbulent States of Miscible Two-Component Bose-Einstein Condensates
Authors: Issei Doki, Makoto Tsubota
Abstract: We investigate turbulence in miscible two-component Bose-Einstein condensates confined in a box potential using the coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations. Turbulence is driven by an oscillating force, causing the components to oscillate either in-phase (co-oscillating) or out-of-phase (counter-oscillating). A parameter measuring component separation (0 for overlap, 1 for full separation) reveals two turbulent states: coupled (the parameter $\sim0$) and decoupled (the parameter $\sim0.5$). Co-oscillating flows transition between these states at a critical interaction strength, while counter-oscillating flows consistently show the decoupled state. A probabilistic model predicts the decoupled state's parameter as $\sqrt{4/\pi - 1} = 0.523$, consistent with simulations.

Title: Non-Hermiticity enhanced topological immunity of one-dimensional $p$-wave superconducting chain
Authors: Min Liu, Yue Zhang, Rui Tian, Xiayao He, Tianhao Wu, Maksims Arzamasovs, Shuai Li, Bo Liu
Abstract: Studying the immunity of topological superconductors against non-local disorder is one of the key issues in both fundamental researches and potential applications. Here, we demonstrate that the non-Hermiticity can enhance the robustness of topological edge states against non-local disorder. To illustrate that, we consider a one-dimensional (1D) generalized Kitaev model with the asymmetric hopping in the presence of disorder. It is shown that the region supporting Majorana zero modes (MZMs) against non-local disorder will be enlarged by the non-Hermiticity. Through both the numerical and analytical analyses, we show that non-Hermiticity can stabilize the topological superconducting (SC) phase against higher disorder strength. Our studies would offer new insights into the interplay between non-Hermiticity and topology.

Title: Microscopic origin of magnetoferroelectricity in monolayer NiBr$_{2}$ and NiI$_{2}$
Authors: Hui-Shi Yu, Xiao-Sheng Ni, Dao-Xin Yao, Kun Cao
Abstract: We investigate the magnetoelectric properties of the monolayer NiX$_{2}$ (X = Br, I) through first-principles calculations. Our calculations predict that the NiBr$_{2}$ monolayer exhibits a cycloidal magnetic ground state. For the NiI$_{2}$ monolayer, a proper-screw helical magnetic ground state with modulation vector \(\boldsymbol{Q} = (q, 0, 0)\) is adopted, approximated based on experimental observations. The electric polarization in NiBr$_{2}$ shows a linear dependence on the spin-orbit coupling strength \(\lambda_{\text{SOC}}\), which can be adequately described by the generalized Katsura-Nagaosa-Balatsky (gKNB) model, considering contributions from up to the third nearest-neighbor spin pairs. In contrast, the electric polarization in NiI$_{2}$ exhibits a distinct dependence on \(q\) and \(\lambda_{\text{SOC}}\), which cannot be fully explained by the gKNB mechanism alone. To address this, the \(p\)-\(d\) hybridization mechanism is extended to NiI$_{2}$ to explain the observed behavior. The respective contributions from the \(p\)-\(d\) hybridization and the gKNB mechanism in NiI$_{2}$ are then quantitatively evaluated. Overall, our work elucidates the microscopic mechanisms underlying multiferroicity in NiBr$_{2}$ and NiI$_{2}$ monolayers, with the conclusions readily applicable to their bulk forms.

Title: Time-domain study of coupled collective excitations in quantum materials
Authors: Chenhang Xu, Alfred Zong
Abstract: Quantum materials hold immense promises for future applications due to their intriguing electronic, magnetic, thermal, and mechanical properties that are often traced to a complex interplay among different microscopic degrees of freedom. Important insights of such interactions come from studying the collective excitations of electrons, spins, orbitals, and lattice, whose cooperative motions play a crucial role in determining the novel behavior of these systems and offer us a key tuning knob to modify material properties on-demand through external perturbations. In this regard, ultrafast light-matter interaction has shown great potential in controlling the couplings of collective excitations, and rapid progress in a plethora of time-resolved techniques down to the attosecond regime has significantly advanced our understanding of the coupling mechanism and guided us in manipulating the dynamical property of quantum materials. This review aims to highlight recent experiments on visualizing collective excitations in the time domain, focusing on the coupling mechanism between different collective modes such as phonon-phonon, phonon-magnon, phonon-exciton, magnon-magnon, magnon-exciton, and various polaritons. We introduce how these collective modes are excited by an ultrashort laser pulse and probed by different ultrafast techniques, and we explain how the coupling between collective excitations governs the ensuing nonequilibrium dynamics. We also provide some perspectives on future studies that can lead to further discoveries regarding the emergent properties of quantum materials both in and out of equilibrium.

Title: Finite strain continuum phenomenological model describing the shape-memory effects in multi-phase semi-crystalline networks
Authors: Matteo Arricca, Nicoletta Inverardi, Stefano Pandini, Maurizio Toselli, Massimo Messori, Giulia Scalet
Abstract: Thermally-driven semi-crystalline polymer networks are capable to achieve both the one-way shape-memory effect and two-way shape-memory effect under stress and stress-free conditions, therefore representing an appealing class of polymers for applications requiring autonomous reversible actuation and shape changes. In these materials, the shape-memory effects are achieved by leveraging the synergistic interaction between one or more crystalline phases and the surrounding amorphous ones that are present within the network itself. The present paper introduces a general framework for the finite strain continuum phenomenological modeling of the thermo-mechanical and shape-memory behavior of multi-phase semi-crystalline polymer networks. Model formulation, including the definition of phase and control variables, kinematic assumptions, and constitutive specifications, is introduced and thoroughly discussed. Theoretical derivations are general and easily adaptable to all cross-linked systems which include two or more crystalline domains or a single crystalline phase with a wide melting range and manifest macroscopically the one-way shape-memory effect and the two-way shape-memory effect under stress and stress-free conditions. Model capabilities are validated against experimental data for copolymer networks with two different crystalline phases characterized by well-separated melting and crystallization transitions. Results demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed model in predicting all the phenomena involved and in furnishing a useful support for future material and application design purposes.

Title: Magnetization reversal of finite-length Co and Fe atomic chains on Pt(332) surface: numerical calculations and a new theoretical approach
Authors: S.V. Kolesnikov, E.S. Glazova, A.M. Saletsky
Abstract: Different mechanisms of magnetization reversal in finite-length Co and Fe chains on the Pt(332) surface have been investigated, taking into account the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. It has been found that the magnetization reversal in short atomic chains occurs through the simultaneous reversal of all magnetic moments. In contrast, the magnetization reversal in long atomic chains is facilitated by the formation of domain walls, which exhibit distinct structures for Co and Fe atomic chains. Using the geodesic nudged elastic band method, we have determined the energy barriers for magnetization reversal in chains consisting of 5 to 100 atoms. Additionally, the frequency prefactors have been calculated within the framework of the harmonic approximation of transition state theory. Notably, the dependencies of these prefactors on chain length and external magnetic field are significant and non-monotonic. We propose a theoretical approach that qualitatively describes the numerical dependencies for both the energy barriers and the frequency prefactors. The magnetization curves derived from our theoretical estimates show qualitative agreement with the results of numerical calculations. This analytical approach enables the estimation of the coercive force of atomic chains across a wide range of lengths, temperatures, sweeping rates, and model parameters. The proposed theoretical framework is applicable not only to the Co and Fe chains on the Pt(332) surface but also to a broad class of one-dimensional magnetic systems.

Title: Charge transport limited by nonlocal electron-phonon interaction. I. Hierarchical equations of motion approach
Authors: Veljko Janković
Abstract: Studying charge transport in models with nonlocal carrier-phonon interaction is difficult because it requires finite-temperature real-time correlation functions of mixed carrier-phonon operators. Focusing on models with discrete undamped phonon modes, we show that such correlation functions can be retrieved from the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM), although phonons have been integrated out. Our procedure relies on the explicit expression of HEOM auxiliaries in terms of phonon creation and annihilation operators. It reveals that the auxiliaries describe multiphonon-assisted carrier transitions induced by genuine many-phonon correlations, from which lower-order correlations are subtracted according to the finite-temperature Wick's theorem. Applying the procedure to our recently developed momentum-space HEOM method featuring a specific hierarchy closing, we compute the numerically exact dynamical mobility of a carrier within the one-dimensional Peierls model. The carrier mobility at moderate temperatures decreases with increasing interaction, whereas high temperatures see the opposite trend, reflecting the prevalence of the phonon-assisted current over the purely electronic band current. The pronounced finite-size effects and HEOM instabilities delimit the range of applicability of our approach to moderate interactions, moderate to high temperatures, and not too fast phonons. Importantly, this range comprises the values relevant for charge transport in crystalline organic semiconductors, and we present and discuss the corresponding numerically exact results in a companion paper.

Title: Charge transport limited by nonlocal electron-phonon interaction. II. Numerically exact quantum dynamics in the slow-phonon regime
Authors: Veljko Janković
Abstract: Transport of charge carriers in mechanically soft semiconductors is mainly limited by their interaction with slow intermolecular phonons. Carrier motion exhibits a crossover from superdiffusive to subdiffusive, producing a distinct low-frequency peak in the dynamical-mobility profile. These features can be understood within approaches relying on the timescale separation between carrier and phonon dynamics, such as the transient localization scenario (TLS). However, recovering them from fully quantum dynamics has proved elusive. Using the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM)-based approach exposed in a companion paper, we study carrier transport in the one-dimensional Peierls model near the adiabatic limit. We find that the TLS approximates HEOM dynamics very well at higher temperatures and for stronger interactions. Then, the transport is predominantly phonon-assisted, and turns diffusive from the subdiffusive side well before one phonon period. In contrast, the band current dominates at moderate temperatures and interactions, relevant for transport in realistic materials. We then conclude that the super-to-subdiffusive crossover is transient, so that the diffusive motion sets in from the superdiffusive side after a couple of phonon periods. The low-frequency dynamical mobility then additionally exhibits a dip at approximately one phonon frequency, and the zero-frequency peak. Our findings in this moderate regime show limitations of the TLS, and support the results of the most advanced quantum-classical simulations. We expect that the qualitative differences between HEOM and TLS dynamics would diminish for a more realistic phonon density of states.

Title: Electron-phonon coupling in lattice engineering of lithium niobate single crystal thin films
Authors: Guoqiang Shi, Kunfeng Chen, Hui Hu, Gongbin Tang, Dongfeng Xue
Abstract: Lithium niobate (LN) single crystal thin films are a high-performance photonic platform with applications in electro-optic modulators, nonlinear optical devices, optical frequency combs, and acousto-optic modulators. LN's significance in photonics parallels silicon's in electronics, addressing challenges like high power consumption and slow communication speeds, and offering potential for broad applications in optical communications, quantum computing, and artificial intelligence. Despite progress in developing LN-based photonic structures, achieving low-loss, reconfigurable, and large-scale devices requires improved processing techniques. This work introduces a quantum design methodology based on LN's crystal structure, utilizing electron-phonon coupling through external field perturbations. Multiscale structural analysis is performed with techniques such as time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray absorption spectra to identify and control defect structures. Angle-resolved Raman spectroscopy, femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, and Density Functional Theory further reveal the mechanisms of electron-phonon coupling. These findings establish a framework for designing LN-based quantum devices with enhanced performance and diverse functionalities.

Title: Control of magnon frequency combs in magnetic rings
Authors: Christopher Heins, Attila Kákay, Joo-Von Kim, Gregor Hlawacek, Jürgen Fassbender, Katrin Schultheiss, Helmut Schultheiss
Abstract: Using Brillouin light scattering microscopy, we study the rich dynamics in magnetic disks and rings governed by non-linear interactions, focusing on the role of vortex core dynamics on the spin-wave eigenmode spectrum. By strongly exciting quantized magnon modes in magnetic vortices, self-induced magnon Floquet states are populated by the intrinsic nonlinear coupling of magnon modes to the vortex core gyration. In magnetic rings, however, this generation is suppressed even when exciting the system over a large power range. To retrieve the rich nonlinear dynamics in rings, we apply external in-plane magnetic fields by which the vortex core is restored. Our findings demonstrate how to take active control of the nonlinear processes in magnetic structures of different topology.

Title: Effect of particle and substrate wettability on evaporation-driven assembly of colloidal monolayers
Authors: Qingguang Xie, Tian Du, Christoph J. Brabec, Jens Harting
Abstract: Assembled monolayers of colloidal particles are crucial for various applications, including opto-electronics, surface engineering, as well as light harvesting, and catalysis. A common approach for self-assembly is the drying of a colloidal suspension film on a solid substrate using technologies such as printing and coating. However, this approach often presents challenges such as low surface coverage, stacking faults, and the formation of multiple layers. We numerically investigate the influence of substrate and particle wettability on the deposited pattern. Higher substrate wettability results in a monolayer with a hexagonal arrangement of deposited particles on the substrate. Conversely, lower substrate wettability leads to droplet formation after the film ruptures, leading to the formation of particle clusters. Furthermore, we reveal that higher particle wettability can mitigate the impact of the substrate wettability and facilitate the formation of highly ordered monolayers. We propose theoretical models predicting the surface coverage fraction dependent on particle volume fraction, initial film thickness, particle radius, as well as substrate and particle wettability, and validate these models with simulations. Our findings provide valuable insights for optimizing the deposition process in the creation of assembled monolayers of colloidal particles.

Title: Migration of phthalate plasticisers in heritage objects made of poly(vinyl chloride): mechanical and environmental aspects
Authors: Sonia Bujok, Tomasz Pańczyk, Kosma Szutkowski, Dominika Anioł, Sergii Antropov, Krzysztof Kruczała, Łukasz Bratasz
Abstract: To clean or not to clean? The solution to this dilemma is related to understanding the plasticiser migration which has a few practical implications for the state of museum artefacts made of plasticised poly(vinyl chloride) - PVC and objects stored in their vicinity. The consequences of this process encompass aesthetic changes due to the presence of exudates and dust deposition, an increase in air pollution and the development of mechanical stresses. Therefore, this paper discusses the plasticiser migration in PVC to provide evidence and support the development of recommendations and guidelines for conservators, collection managers and heritage scientists. Particularly, the investigation is focused on the migration of the ortho-phthalates representing the group of the most abundant plasticisers in PVC collections. The predominance of inner diffusion or surface emission (evaporation) determining the rate-limiting step of the overall migration process is considered a fundament for understanding the potential environmental and mechanical risk. According to this concept, general correlations for various ortho-phthalates are proposed depending on their molar mass with the support of molecular dynamics simulations and NMR diffusometry. The study reveals that for the majority of the PVC objects in collections, the risk of accelerated migration upon mild removal of surface plasticiser exudate is low. Thus, surface cleaning would allow for diminishing dust deposition and air pollution by phthalate-emitting objects in a museum environment. Bearing in mind simplicity and the need for fast decision-supporting solutions, the step-by-step protocol for non-destructive identification and quantification of plasticisers in objects made of or containing plasticised PVC, determination of the physical state of investigated artefacts and rate-limiting process of plasticiser migration is proposed.

Title: Unidirectional motion of topological defects mediating continuous rotation processes
Authors: Marisel Di Pietro Martínez, Luke Alexander Turnbull, Jeffrey Neethirajan, Max Birch, Simone Finizio, Jörg Raabe, Edouard Lesne, Anastasios Markou, María Vélez, Aurelio Hierro-Rodríguez, Marco Salvalaglio, Claire Donnelly
Abstract: Topological defects play a critical role across many fields, mediating phase transitions and macroscopic behaviors as they move through space. Their role as robust information carriers has also generated much attention. However, controlling their motion remains challenging, especially towards achieving motion along well-defined paths which typically require predefined structural patterning. Here we demonstrate the tunable, unidirectional motion of topological defects, specifically magnetic dislocations in a weak magnetic stripe pattern, induced by external magnetic field in a laterally unconfined thin film. This motion is shown to mediate the overall continuous rotation of the stripe pattern. We determine the connection between the unidirectional motion of dislocations and the underlying three-dimensional (3D) magnetic structure by performing 3D magnetic vectorial imaging with in situ magnetic fields. A minimal model for dislocations in stripe patterns that encodes the symmetry breaking induced by the external magnetic field reproduces the motion of dislocations that facilitate the 2D rotation of the stripes, highlighting the universality of the phenomenon. This work establishes a framework for studying the field-driven behavior of topological textures and designing materials that enable well defined, controlled motion of defects in unconfined systems, paving the way to manipulate information carriers in higher-dimensional systems.

Title: Thermodynamics of a compressible lattice gas crystal: Generalized Gibbs-Duhem equation and adsorption
Authors: Michiel Sprik
Abstract: Compressible lattice gas models are used in material science to understand the coupling between composition and strain in alloys. The seminal work in this field is the 1973 Larché-Cahn paper (Acta Metall. {\bf 21} 1051-1063). Single-phase crystals in Larché-Cahn theory are stable under open constant pressure, constant temperature conditions. The Gibbs free energy does not have to match the product $\mu N$ of the number of particles $N$ and their chemical potential $\mu$. Discrepancies already arise under hydrostatic stress. The reason is that volume strain is defined with respect to a fixed reference state. The elastic energy is not proportional to volume and the Gibbs-Duhem relation valid for liquids is violated. Extensivity can be recovered by treating the number of lattice sites $M$ as an additional thermodynamic variable. This assigns a formal chemical potential $\nu$ to the immobile lattice sites. The difference $ G-\mu N $ can be identified with $\nu M$. We have worked this out for a one-component compressible lattice gas crystal. Shear stress is omitted. The reinstated Gibbs-Duhem equation can be cast in the form of an adsorption equation and applied to quantify the tendency to vacancy creation. The derivative of population with respect to chemical potential at constant pressure and temperature is compared to the corresponding susceptibility in a fixed volume open system. We find that the difference is proportional to the elastic constant of the bare lattice, confirming that this quantity is the crucial macroscopic property distinguishing a solid under hydrostatic stress from a liquid.

Title: Photon-assisted stochastic resonance in nanojunctions
Authors: Michael Ridley, Leo Bellassai, Michael Moskalets, Lev Kantorovich, Riku Tuovinen
Abstract: We study stochastic resonance in molecular junctions driven by a periodically-varying external field. This is done using the time-dependent Landauer-B{ü}ttiker formalism, which follows from exact analytical solutions to the Kadanoff-Baym equations describing the molecular junction subject to an arbitrary time-dependent bias. We focus on a double quantum dot nanojunction and compare the effects of the temperature with the fluctuating bias in the statically-driven case. We then consider the combined effect of AC-driving and white noise fluctuations on the rectified current through the nanojunction, and find a stochastic resonance effect, where at certain driving conditions the bias fluctuations enhance the current signal. The study is then extended to include the color noise in the applied bias, so that the combined effect of the color noise correlation time and driving frequency on stochastic resonance is investigated. We thereby demonstrate that photon-assisted transport can be optimized by a suitably tuned environment.

Title: Polymorphism and Magnetism in a Kitaev Honeycomb Cobaltate KCoAsO$_4$
Authors: Yuya Haraguchi, Daisuke-Nishio Hamane, Hiroko Aruga Katori
Abstract: We report the synthesis, crystal structure, and magnetic properties of a new Kitaev honeycomb cobaltate, KCoAsO$_4$, which crystallizes in two distinct forms: $P2/c$ and $R\bar{3}$ space groups. Magnetic measurements reveal ordering temperatures of $\sim$14 K for the $P2/c$ structure and $\sim$10.5 K for the $R\bar{3}$ structure. The $P2/c$-type KCoAsO$_4$ sample exhibits a complex temperature-field phase diagram, including a field-induced phase, while the $R\bar{3}$-type KCoAsO$_4$ shows a simpler phase diagram with a single magnetically ordered phase. The observed differences in magnetic properties are attributed to subtle structural variations, strongly suggesting that local structural changes play a crucial role in determining the magnetism of cobaltate-based Kitaev materials.

Title: Anisotropic active Brownian particle in two dimensions under stochastic resetting
Authors: Anirban Ghosh, Sudipta Mandal
Abstract: We analytically investigate the dynamic behavior of an an-isotropic active Brownian particle under various stochastic resetting protocols in two dimensions. The motion of shape-asymmetric active Brownian particles in two dimensions leads to an-isotropic diffusion at short times, whereas rotational diffusion causes the transport to become isotropic at longer times. We have considered three different resetting protocols: (a) complete resetting, when both position and orientation are reset to their initial states, (b) only position is reset to its initial state, (c) only orientation is reset to its initial state. We reveal that orientation resetting sustains asymmetry even at late times. When both the spatial position and orientation are subject to resetting, a complex position probability distribution forms in the steady state. All the analytical findings are thoroughly validated by corresponding simulation results.

Title: Magnetism and electronic dynamics in $CuCr_{2-x}Sn_xS_4$ spinels studied by transferred hyperfine fields at $^{119}Sn$ and muon spin rotation and relaxation
Authors: Elaheh Sadrollahi, Cynthia P. C. Medrano, Magno A.V. Heringer, E. M. Baggio Saitovitch, Lilian Prodan, Vladimir Tsurkan, F. Jochen Litterst
Abstract: We investigated magnetization, muon spin rotation ($\mu$SR), and $^{119}Sn$ Mössbauer spectroscopy on Sn substituted $CuCr_{2-x}Sn_xS_4$ (x=0.03 and 0.08) spinel compounds. The magnetization and $\mu$SR results reveal similar additional low-temperature magnetic transitions around 80 K and 40 K as found for the undoped material, indicating a magnetic ground state deviating from a simple collinear ferromagnet. The observed changes in the Mössbauer hyperfine spectra are less pronounced and are discussed in view of the different positions of the local probes $\mu^+$ and $^{119}Sn$ and their different magnetic coupling to the magnetic Cr lattice. Above 80 K, both $\mu$SR and Mössbauer spectra show temperature-dependent inhomogeneous broadening either due to structural or charge disorder and changing spin dynamics that can be related to a precursor magnetic phase above the well-defined static low-temperature phase.

Title: Tree Models Machine Learning to Identify Liquid Metal based Alloy Superconductor
Authors: Chen Hua, Jing Liu
Abstract: Superconductors, which are crucial for modern advanced technologies due to their zero-resistance properties, are limited by low Tc and the difficulty of accurate prediction. This article made the initial endeavor to apply machine learning to predict the critical temperature (Tc) of liquid metal (LM) alloy superconductors. Leveraging the SuperCon dataset, which includes extensive superconductor property data, we developed a machine learning model to predict Tc. After addressing data issues through preprocessing, we compared multiple models and found that the Extra Trees model outperformed others with an R2 of 0.9519 and an RMSE of 6.2624 K. This model is subsequently used to predict Tc for LM alloys, revealing In0.5Sn0.5 as having the highest Tc at 7.01 K. Furthermore, we extended the prediction to 2,145 alloys binary and 45,670 ternary alloys across 66 metal elements and promising results were achieved. This work demonstrates the advantages of tree-based models in predicting Tc and would help accelerate the discovery of high-performance LM alloy superconductors in the coming time.

Title: Multi-Particle Collision Framework for Active Polar Fluids
Authors: Oleksandr Baziei, Benjamín Loewe, Tyler N. Shendruk
Abstract: Sufficiently dense intrinsically out-of-equilibrium suspensions, such as those observed in biological systems, can be modelled as active fluids characterised by their orientational symmetry. While mesoscale numerical approaches to active nematic fluids have been developed, polar fluids are simulated as either ensembles of microscopic self-propelled particles or continuous hydrodynamic-scale equations of motion. To better simulate active polar fluids in complex geometries or as a solvent for suspensions, mesoscale numerical approaches are needed. In this work, the coarse-graining Multi-Particle Collision Dynamics (MPCD) framework is applied to three active particle models to produce mesoscale simulations of polar active fluids. The first active-polar MPCD (AP-MPCD) is a variant of the Vicsek model, while the second and third variants allow the speed of the particles to relax towards a self-propulsion speed subject to Andersen and Langevin thermostats, respectively. Each of these AP-MPCD variants exhibit a flocking transition at a critical activity and banding in the vicinity of the transition point. We leverage the mesoscale nature of AP-MPCD to explore flocking in the presence of external fields, which destroys banding, and anisotropic obstacles, which act as a ratchet that biases the flocking direction. These results demonstrate the capacity of AP-MPCD to capture the known phenomenology of polar active suspensions, and its versatility to study active polar fluids in complex scenarios.

Title: Rashba effect modulation in two-dimensional A2B2Te6 (A = Sb, Bi; B = Si, Ge) materials via charge transfer
Authors: Haipeng Wu, Qikun Tian, Jinghui Wei, Ziyu Xing, Guangzhao Qin, Zhenzhen Qin
Abstract: Designing two-dimensional (2D) Rashba semiconductors, exploring the underlying mechanism of Rashba effect, and further proposing efficient and controllable approaches are crucial for the development of spintronics. On the basis of first-principles calculations, we here theoretically design all possible types (common, inverse, and composite) of Janus structures and successfully achieve numerous ideal 2D Rashba semiconductors from a series of five atomic-layer A2B2Te6 (A = Sb, Bi; B = Si, Ge) materials. Considering the different Rashba constant {\alpha}R and its modulation trend under external electric field, we comprehensively analyze the intrinsic electric field Ein in terms of work function, electrostatic potential, dipole moment, and inner charge transfer. Inspired by the quantitative relationship between charge transfer and the strength of Ein and even the {\alpha}R, we propose a straightforward strategy of introducing a single adatom onto the surface of 2D monolayer to introduce and modulate the Rashba effect. Lastly, we also examine the growth feasibility and electronic structures of the Janus Sb2Ge2Se3Te3 system and Janus-adsorbed systems on a 2D BN substrate. Our work not only conducts a detailed analysis of A2B2Te6-based Rashba systems, but also proposes a new strategy for efficiently and controllably modulating the {\alpha}R through the reconfiguration of charge transfer.

Title: Three-body scattering hypervolume of two-component fermions in three dimensions
Authors: Jiansen Zhang, Zipeng Wang, Shina Tan
Abstract: We study the zero-energy collision of three fermions, two of which are in the spin-down ($\downarrow$) state and one of which is in the spin-up ($\uparrow$) state. Assuming that the two-body and the three-body interactions have a finite range, we find a parameter, $D$, called the three-body scattering hypervolume. We study the three-body wave function asymptotically when three fermions are far apart or one spin-$\uparrow$ (spin-$\downarrow$) fermion and one pair, formed by the other two fermions, are far apart, and derive three asymptotic expansions of the wave function. The three-body scattering hypervolume appears in the coefficients of such expansions at the order of $B^{-5}$, where $B$ is the hyperradius of the triangle formed by the three fermions. When the interactions are weak, we calculate $D$ approximately using the Born expansion. We also analyze the energy shift of three such fermions in a large periodic cube due to $D$ and generalize this result to the many-fermion system. $D$ also determines the three-body recombination rate in two-component Fermi gases, and we calculate the three-body recombination rate in terms of $D$ and the density and temperature of the gas.

Title: Two- and many-body physics of ultracold molecules dressed by dual microwave fields
Authors: Fulin Deng, Xinyuan Hu, Wei-Jian Jin, Su Yi, Tao Shi
Abstract: We investigate the two- and many-body physics of the ultracold polar molecules dressed by dual microwaves with distinct polarizations. Using Floquet theory and multichannel scattering calculations, we identify a regime with the largest elastic-to-inelastic scattering ratio which is favorable for performing evaporative cooling. Furthermore, we derive and, subsequently, validate an effective interaction potential that accurately captures the dynamics of microwave-shielded polar molecules (MSPMs). We also explore the ground-state properties of the ultracold gases of MSPMs by computing physical quantities such as gas density, condensate fraction, momentum distribution, and second-order correlation. It is shown that the system supports a weakly correlated expanding gas state and a strongly correlated self-bound gas state. Since the dual-microwave scheme introduces addition control knob and is essential for creating ultracold Bose gases of polar molecules, our work pave the way for studying two- and many-body physics of the ultracold polar molecules dressed by dual microwaves.

Title: Application of pretrained universal machine-learning interatomic potential for physicochemical simulation of liquid electrolytes in Li-ion battery
Authors: Suyeon Ju, Jinmu You, Gijin Kim, Yutack Park, Hyungmin An, Seungwu Han
Abstract: Achieving higher operational voltages, faster charging, and broader temperature ranges for Li-ion batteries necessitates advancements in electrolyte engineering. However, the complexity of optimizing combinations of solvents, salts, and additives has limited the effectiveness of both experimental and computational screening methods for liquid electrolytes. Recently, pretrained universal machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have emerged as promising tools for computational exploration of complex chemical spaces with high accuracy and efficiency. In this study, we evaluated the performance of the state-of-the-art equivariant pretrained MLIP, SevenNet-0, in predicting key properties of liquid electrolytes, including solvation behavior, density, and ion transport. To assess its suitability for extensive material screening, we considered a dataset comprising 20 solvents. Although SevenNet-0 was predominantly trained on inorganic compounds, its predictions for the properties of liquid electrolytes showed good agreement with experimental and $\textit{ab initio}$ data. However, systematic errors were identified, particularly in the predicted density of liquid electrolytes. To address this limitation, we fine-tuned SevenNet-0, achieving improved accuracy at a significantly reduced computational cost compared to developing bespoke models. Analysis of the training set suggested that the model achieved its accuracy by generalizing across the chemical space rather than memorizing specific configurations. This work highlights the potential of SevenNet-0 as a powerful tool for future engineering of liquid electrolyte systems.

Title: Control Strategies for Maintaining Transport Symmetries Far From Equilibrium
Authors: David Andrieux
Abstract: We present two schemes for controlling the transport dynamics of mesoscopic devices. In both approaches, we manipulate the system's output - such as particle currents and energy flows - while maintaining symmetric transport properties, even under far-from-equilibrium conditions. We provide exact descriptions of the modified processes under each scheme and investigate their characteristics. Notably, one of the schemes is shown to minimize the dissimilarity between the original and modified processes, as quantified by the Kullback-Leibler divergence. These findings have the potential to enhance the design and control of mesoscopic systems.

Title: A Thermodynamic Theory of Proximity Ferroelectricity
Authors: Eugene A. Eliseev, Anna N. Morozovska, Jon-Paul Maria, Long-Qing Chen, Venkatraman Gopalan
Abstract: Proximity ferroelectricity has recently been reported as a new design paradigm for inducing ferroelectricity, where a non-ferroelectric polar material becomes a ferroelectric by interfacing with a thin ferroelectric layer. Strongly polar materials, such as AlN and ZnO, which were previously unswitchable with an external field below their dielectric breakdown fields, can now be switched with practical coercive fields when they are in intimate proximity to a switchable ferroelectric. Here, we develop a general Landau-Ginzburg theory of proximity ferroelectricity in multilayers of non-ferroelectrics and ferroelectrics to analyze their switchability and coercive fields. The theory predicts regimes of both "proximity switching" where the multilayers collectively switch, as well as "proximity suppression" where they collectively do not switch. The mechanism of the proximity ferroelectricity is an internal electric field determined by the polarization of the layers and their relative thickness in a self-consistent manner that renormalizes the double-well ferroelectric potential to lower the steepness of the switching barrier. Further reduction in the coercive field emerges from charged defects in the bulk that act as nucleation centers. The application of the theory to proximity ferroelectricity in Alx-1ScxN/AlN and Zn1-xMgxO/ZnO bilayers is demonstrated. The theory further predicts that multilayers of dielectric/ferroelectric and paraelectric/ferroelectric layers can potentially result in induced ferroelectricity in the dielectric or paraelectric layers, resulting in the entire stack being switched, an exciting avenue for new discoveries. This thawing of "frozen ferroelectrics", paraelectrics and potentially dielectrics, promises a large class of new ferroelectrics with exciting prospects for previously unrealizable domain-patterned optoelectronic and memory technologies.

Title: Correlation between Complex Spin Textures and the Magnetocaloric and Hall Effects in Eu(Ga$_{1-x}$Al$_x$)$_4$ ($x$ = 0.9, 1)
Authors: Kelly J. Neubauer, Kevin Allen, Jaime M. Moya, Mason L. Klemm, Feng Ye, Zachary Morgan, Lisa DeBeer-Schmitt, Wei Tian, Emilia Morosan, Pengcheng Dai
Abstract: Determining the electronic phase diagram of a quantum material as a function of temperature (T) and applied magnetic field (H) forms the basis for understanding the microscopic origin of transport properties, such as the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) and topological Hall effect (THE). For many magnetic quantum materials, including EuAl$_4$, a THE arises from a topologically protected magnetic skyrmion lattice with a non-zero scalar spin chirality. We identified a square skyrmion lattice (sSkL) peak in Eu(Ga$_{1-x}$Al$_x$)$_4$ ($x$ = 0.9) identical to the peak previously observed in EuAl$_4$ by performing neutron scattering measurements throughout the phase diagram. Comparing these neutron results with transport measurements, we found that in both compounds the maximal THE does not correspond to the sSkL area. Instead of the maximal THE, the maximal magnetocaloric effect (MCE) boundaries better identify the sSkL lattice phase observed by neutron scattering measurements. The maximal THE therefore arises from interactions of itinerant electrons with frustrated spin fluctuations in a topologically trivial magnetic state.

Title: Galvanic molecular intercalation

Schiller, Fèlix Casanova, Samuel Mañas-Valero, Eugenio Coronado, Iván Rivilla, Zdenek Sofer, Beatriz Martín-García, Maider Ormaza, Luis E. Hueso, Marco Gobbi
Abstract: The intercalation of molecular species between the layers of van der Waals (vdW) materials has recently emerged as a powerful approach to combine the remarkable electronic and magnetic properties of vdW materials with the chemical flexibility of organic molecules. However, the full transformative potential of molecular intercalation remains underexplored, largely due to the lack of simple, broadly applicable methods that preserve high crystalline quality down to the few-layer limit. Here, we introduce a simple galvanic approach to intercalate different molecules into various vdW materials under ambient conditions, leveraging the low reduction potential of selected metals to enable a spontaneous molecular insertion. We employ our method, which is particularly well-suited for the in-situ intercalation of few-layer-thick crystals, to intercalate nine vdW materials, including magnets and superconductors, with molecules ranging from conventional alkylammonium ions to metallorganic and bio-inspired chiral cations. Notably, intercalation leads to a molecule-dependent enhancement of the superconducting transition in 2H-TaS2, reaching a critical temperature of 4.7 K, higher than TaS2 monolayers. Additionally, RuCl3 exhibits an unprecedented transition from antiferromagnetic to ferrimagnetic ordering upon intercalation with cobaltocenium. These results establish our approach as a versatile technique for engineering atomically thin quantum materials and heterostructures, unlocking the transformative effects of molecular intercalation.

Title: Competition of superconducting pairing symmetries in La3Ni2O7
Authors: Han-Xiang Xu, Yue Xie, Daniel Guterding, Zhijun Wang
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity in the bilayer Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate La3Ni2O7 under high pressure has generated much interest in the superconducting pairing mechanism of nickelates. Various theoretical approaches have been applied to the study of superconductivity in La3Ni2O7, but lead to a number of contradicting results. We argue that different superconducting states in La3Ni2O7 are in close competition and at the same time particularly sensitive to the choice of interaction parameters as well as changes of the electronic structure through pressure. Our study uses a multi-orbital Hubbard model, incorporating all Ni 3d and O 2p states. We analyze the superconducting pairing mechanism of La3Ni2O7 within the random phase approximation and find a transition between d-wave and sign-changing s-wave pairing states as a function of pressure and interaction parameters, which is driven by spin-fluctuations with different wave vectors. Our work paves the way to understanding seemingly contradictory theoretical results within a unified framework.

Title: MoSi2N4-like crystals -- the new family of two-dimensional materials
Authors: Tatiana Latychevskaia, Denis A. Bandurin, Kostya S. Novoselov
Abstract: Recently-synthesised MoSi2N4 is the first septuple layer two-dimensional material, which doesn't naturally occurs as a layered crystal, and has been obtained with CVD growth. It can be considered as MoN2 crystal (with a crystal structure of MoS2) intercalating Si2N2 two-dimensional layer (with the structure similar to InSe). Such classification gave rise to the understanding of the electronic properties of the material, but also to the prediction of other members of the family (many dozens of them) as well as to the way to classify those. Whereas the originally-synthesised MoSi2N4 is a semiconductor, some of the members of the family are also metallic and some even demonstrate magnetic properties. Interestingly, the room-temperature mobility predicted for such crystals can be as high few thousands cm^2/V*s (hole mobility typically higher than electron) with some record cases as high as 5*10^4 cm^22/V*s, making these materials strong contenders for future electronic applications. The major interest towards these materials is coming from the septuple layer structure, which allows multiple crystal phases, but also complex compositions, in particular those with broken mirror-reflection symmetry against the layer of metal atoms.

Title: Elliptical stability of hopfions in bulk helimagnets
Authors: Konstantin L. Metlov
Abstract: Magnetic hopfions are three-dimensional topological solitons with non-zero Hopf index ${\cal H}$ in the vector field of material's local magnetization. In this Letter elliptical stability of hopfions with ${\cal H}=1$ in a classical helimagnet is studied on the basis of a variational model. It is shown that, depending on their internal structure (vortex and antivortex tubes ordering), the hopfions can either be stable in a bulk magnet or unstable with respect to elongation along their central axis. It is found that the energy of stable hopfions is always below the energy of the $2\pi$-skyrmion lattice in the same material, suggesting the possibility to use $2\pi$-skyrmions as a precursor for hopfion nucleation. Stability diagram for hopfions on the magnetic anisotropy-field phase diagram is computed numerically. Explicit analytical expressions for some of its critical lines are derived.

Title: First-Principles and Machine Learning Insights into the Design of DOTT-Carbon and its Lithium-Ion Storage Capacity
Authors: Kleuton. A. L. Lima, Ana V. P. Abreu, Alysson M. A. Silva, Luiz A. Ribeiro Jr
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) carbon-based materials are promising candidates for developing more efficient green energy conversion and storage technologies. This study presents a new 2D carbon allotrope, DOTT-Carbon, characterized by its distinctive and multi-ring structure featuring 12-, 8-, 4-, and 3-membered rings of carbon atoms. We explore its structural, mechanical, and lithium-ion storage properties by employing density functional theory and machine learning simulations. Phonon calculations confirm its structural stability and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate its thermal resilience at elevated temperatures. The material exhibits anisotropic mechanical properties, with Young's modulus values varying between 280-330 GPa. DOTT-Carbon displays a lithium-ion storage capacity of 446.28 mAh/g, complemented by a low diffusion barrier (0.2-0.9 eV) and a high diffusion coefficient ($ > 1.0 \times 10^{-6}$ cm$^{2}$/s), possibly facilitating efficient lithium-ion transport. The stable open circuit voltage of 0.28 V also indicates its suitability as an anode material.

Title: Evidences for local non-centrosymmetricity and strong phonon anomaly in EuCu2As2: A Raman spectroscopy and lattice dynamics study
Authors: Debasmita Swain, Mainak Dey Sarkar, Andrzej Ptok, G. Vaitheeswaran, Anushree Roy, Sitikantha D Das
Abstract: Phonon modes and their association with the electronic states have been investigated for the metallic EuCu$_{2}$As$_{2}$ system. In this work, we present the Raman spectra of this pnictide system which clearly shows the presence of seven well defined peaks above $100$~cm$^{-1}$ that is consistent with the locally non-centrosymmetric {\it P4/nmm} crystal structure, contrary to that what is expected from the accepted symmorphic {\it I4/mmm} structure. Lattice dynamics calculations using the {\it P4/nmm} symmetry attest that there is a commendable agreement between the calculated phonon spectra at the $\Gamma$ point and the observed Raman mode frequencies, with the most intense peak at $\sim 232$~cm$^{-1}$ being ascribed to the A$_{1g}$ mode. Temperature dependent Raman measurements show that there is a significant deviation from the expected anharmonic behaviour around $165$~K for the A$_{1g}$ mode, with anomalies being observed for several other modes as well, although to a lesser extent. Attempts are made to rationalize the observed anomalous behavior related to the hardening of the phonon modes, with parallels being drawn from metal dichalcogenide and allied systems. Similarities in the evolution of the Raman peak frequencies with temperature seem to suggest a strong signature of a subtle electronic density wave instability below $165$~K in this compound.

Title: Dipolar magnetostirring protocol for three-well atomtronic circuits
Authors: Héctor Briongos-Merino, Felipe Isaule, Montserrat Guilleumas, Bruno Juliá-Díaz
Abstract: We propose a magnetostirring protocol to create persistent currents on an annular system. Under this protocol, polar bosons confined in a three-well ring circuit reach a state with high average circulation. We model the system with an extended Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian and show that the protocol can create circulation in an atomtronic circuit for a range of tunable parameters. The performance and robustness of this scheme are examined, in particular considering different interaction regimes. We also present a method for predicting the optimal protocol parameters, which improves protocol's scalability and enables its application to systems with large numbers of bosons. This overcomes computational limitations and paves the way for exploring macroscopic quantum phenomena.

Title: Unveiling structure-property correlations in ferroelectric $Hf_{0.5}Zr_{0.5}O_2$ films using variational autoencoders
Authors: Kévin Alhada-Lahbabi, Brice Gautier, Damien Deleruyelle, Grégoire Magagnin
Abstract: While $Hf_{0.5}Zr_{0.5}O_2$ (HZO) thin films hold significant promise for modern nanoelectronic devices, a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between their polycrystalline structure and electrical properties remains elusive. Here, we present a novel framework combining phase-field (PF) modeling with Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to uncover structure-property correlations in polycrystalline HZO. Leveraging PF simulations, we constructed a high-fidelity dataset of $P-V$ loops by systematically varying critical material parameters, including grain size, polar grain fraction, and crystalline orientation. The VAEs effectively encoded hysteresis loops into a low-dimensional latent space, capturing electrical properties while disentangling complex material parameters interdependencies. We further demonstrate a VAE-based inverse design approach to optimize $P-V$ loop features, enabling the tailored design of device-specific key performance indicators (KPIs), including coercive field, remanent polarization, and loop area. The proposed approach offers a pathway to systematically explore and optimize the material design space for ferroelectric nanoelectronics.

Title: Double Majorana Vortex Flat Bands in the Topological Dirac Superconductor
Authors: Zhongyi Zhang, Zixi Fang, Shengshan Qin, Peng Zhang, Hoi Chun Po, Xianxin Wu
Abstract: Vortex lines, known as topological defects, are cable of trapping Majorana modes in superconducting topological materials. Previous studies have primarily focused on topological bands with conventional s-wave pairing. However, topological Dirac semimetals exhibiting a unique orbital texture can favor unconventional pairing when electronic correlations are significant. The topology of vortices in these systems has yet to be explored. In this work, we investigate the vortex bound states in superconducting Dirac semimetals, with a particular focus on the orbital-singlet unconventional pairing, which generates higher-order Majorana hinge modes. Remarkably, we identify robust double Majorana vortex flat bands at zero energy. In type-I Dirac semimetals, these Majorana flat bands are located between the projections of two superconduting Dirac points. In contrast, in type-II Dirac semimetals, they extend across the entire 1D Brillouin zone. These double flat bands arise from a nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology defined by an effective particle-hole symmetry and are protected by the four-fold rotational symmetry. Additionally, we observe that moving the vortex line close to a hinge can trivialize the higher-order Majorana arc on the hinge, leaving a single Majorana mode at the vortex core due to the hybridization of Majorana modes. Finally, we discuss the potential experimental implications for correlated Dirac semimetals, such as electron-doped iron-based superconductors.

Title: Quantifying superlubricity of bilayer graphene from the mobility of interface dislocations
Authors: Md Tusher Ahmed, Moon-ki Choi, Harley T Johnson, Nikhil Chandra Admal
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures subjected to interlayer twists or heterostrains demonstrate structural superlubricity, leading to their potential use as superlubricants in micro- and nano-electro-mechanical devices. However, quantifying superlubricity across the vast four-dimensional heterodeformation space using experiments or atomic-scale simulations is a challenging task. In this work, we develop an atomically informed dynamic Frenkel--Kontorova (DFK) model for predicting the interface friction drag coefficient of an arbitrarily heterodeformed bilayer graphene (BG) system. The model is motivated by MD simulations of friction in heterodeformed BG. In particular, we note that interface dislocations formed during structural relaxation translate in unison when a heterodeformed BG is subjected to shear traction, leading us to the hypothesis that the kinetic properties of interface dislocations determine the friction drag coefficient of the interface. The constitutive law of the DFK model comprises the generalized stacking fault energy of the AB stacking, a scalar displacement drag coefficient, and the elastic properties of graphene, which are all obtained from atomistic simulations. Simulations of the DFK model confirm our hypothesis since a single choice of the displacement drag coefficient, fit to the kinetic property of an individual dislocation in an atomistic simulation, predicts interface friction in any heterodeformed BG. By bridging the gap between dislocation kinetics at the microscale to interface friction at the macroscale, the DFK model enables a high-throughput investigation of strain-engineered vdW heterostructures.

Title: Force-Velocity Relationship in Branched Actin Networks: Consequences of Entanglement, Drag and Stall Force
Authors: Magid Badaoui, Serge Dmitrieff
Abstract: We investigate the growth of a branched actin network under load. Using a combination of simulations and theory, we show that the network adapts to the load and exhibits two regimes: a finite velocity at low stress, followed by a power-law decay of the velocity as a function of stress. This decay is explained by a theoretical model relating branched network elasticity to filament entanglement. The finite maximum velocity is attributed to network drag, which dictates dynamics at low stress. Additionally, analysis of filament stall force contribution reveals a transition from a stalled network to a growing network, when the filament stall force exceeds a critical value controlled by the applied stress.

Title: Discovery of Spin-Crossover Candidates with Equivariant Graph Neural Networks
Authors: Angel Albavera-Mata, Pawan Prakash, Jason B. Gibson, Eric Fonseca, Sijin Ren, Xiao-Guang Zhang, Hai-Ping Cheng, Michael Shatruk, S.B. Trickey, Richard G. Hennig
Abstract: Swift discovery of spin-crossover materials for their potential application in quantum information devices requires techniques which enable efficient identification of suitably bistable candidates. To this end, we screened the Cambridge Structural Database to develop a specialized database of 1,439 materials and computed spin-switching energies from density functional theory for each material. The database was used to train an equivariant graph convolutional neural network to predict the magnitude of the spin-conversion energy. A test mean absolute error was 360 meV. For candidate identification, we equipped the system with a relevance-based classifier. This approach leads to a nearly four-fold improvement in identifying potential spin-crossover systems of interest as compared to conventional high-throughput screening.

Title: Real-frequency TPSC+DMFT investigation of the square-lattice Hubbard model
Authors: Lei Geng, Jiawei Yan, Philipp Werner
Abstract: We investigate the two-dimensional Hubbard model using a real-frequency implementation of the TPSC+DMFT approach. This hybrid method combines the nonlocal correlations captured by the Two-Particle Self-Consistent (TPSC) approach with the local dynamical correlations of Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT). The results demonstrate that TPSC+DMFT effectively describes pseudogap physics and nonlocal fluctuations in the moderately correlated regime, while also reproducing the Mott insulating state at larger interaction strengths. For doped Mott insulators, we find that TPSC+DMFT captures the evolution of Fermi pockets into Fermi arcs, consistent with the results from cluster DMFT and photoemission studies. These findings highlight the capability of TPSC+DMFT to bridge the gap between weak and strong coupling physics in Hubbard models, providing insights into spin and charge fluctuations, as well as their role in the pseudogap formation.

Title: Novel Electrical Characterization Method for Antiferroelectrics using a Positive Up Negative Down Approach
Authors: Grégoire Magagnin, Martine Le Berre, Sara Gonzalez, Damien Deleruyelle, Bertrand Vilquin, Jordan Bouaziz
Abstract: This study demonstrates the effectiveness of AFE-PUND, a revisited Positive Up Negative Down (PUND) protocol for characterizing antiferroelectric (AFE) materials, in analyzing $ZrO_2$ films across different thicknesses, revealing key trends. The proposed AFE-PUND method enables the isolation of switching currents from non-switching contributions, allowing precise extraction of remanent polarization and coercive field from hysteresis loops. The remanent polarization increases with film thickness, reflecting enhanced domain stability, while endurance cycles highlight the wake-up effect and its eventual degradation due to fatigue in thicker films. Similarly, coercive fields decrease with thickness, indicating reduced switching barriers and a clearer transition between tetragonal and orthorhombic phases. The method provides valuable insights into micro-structural influences, such as defect accumulation, grain size, and domain wall pinning, which critically affect device performance. AFE-PUND thus establishes itself as an essential tool for advancing the understanding and optimization of antiferroelectric materials.

Title: Self-diffusion in isotropic and liquid crystalline phases of fd virus colloidal rods: a combined single particle tracking and differential dynamic microscopy study
Authors: Eric Grelet, Vincent A. Martinez, Jochen Arlt
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the dynamics of self-organised suspensions formed by rod-like fd virus colloids. Two methods have been employed for analysing fluorescence microscopy movies: single particle tracking (SPT) in direct space and differential dynamic microscopy (DDM) in reciprocal space. We perform a quantitative analysis on this anisotropic system with complex diffusion across different self-assembled states, ranging from dilute and semi-dilute liquids to nematic and smectic organisations. By leveraging the complementary strengths of SPT and DDM, we provide new insights in the dynamics of viral colloidal rods, such as long time diffusion coefficients in the smectic phase. We further discuss the advantages and limitations of both methods for studying the intricate dynamics of anisotropic colloidal systems.

Title: Correlated Hopf insulators
Authors: Konstantinos Ladovrechis, Shouvik Sur
Abstract: Hopf insulators represent an exceptional class of topological matter unanticipated by the periodic table of topological invariants. These systems point to the existence of previously unexplored states of matter with unconventional topology. In this work, we take a step toward exploring this direction by investigating correlation-driven instabilities of Hopf insulators. Organizing our analysis around the topological quantum critical point that separates the Hopf insulating phase from a trivial insulator, we demonstrate the emergence of unconventional Weyl semimetallic and topological insulating states. Notably, the Weyl semimetal supports non-reciprocal superconductivity and a Bogoliubov-Fermi surface, potentially providing a novel framework for realizing the superconducting diode effect. Finally, we highlight the interconnectedness of the effective descriptions of correlated Hopf insulators, two-dimensional quadratic band-touching semimetals, and Luttinger semimetals.

Title: Self-propulsion and self-rotation of an inertial chiral active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particle
Authors: F Sahala, M Muhsin, M Sahoo
Abstract: We investigate the transport feature of an inertial chiral active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particle moving on a two-dimensional surface. Using both analytical approach and numerical simulations, we have exactly explored the transient and steady-state behavior of the particle by analyzing the simulated particle trajectories, probability distribution functions for position and velocity, mean square displacement, mean square velocity, and effective kinetic temperature of the medium. From the mean square displacement calculations, we observe that, unlike an inertial active Brownian particle, a chiral active particle manifests an initial ballistic, intermediate sub-diffusive to non-diffusive, and the conventional long-time diffusive behavior. The intermediate sub-diffusive to non-diffusive behavior is prominent for the self-propulsion of an overdamped particle. It can be understood by chirality-induced transient confinement, which persists for short time intervals and diffuses away in the time asymptotic limit or at the steady state. This behavior is further complemented by the exact calculation of mean square velocity or effective kinetic temperature of the medium, which is a decreasing function of the magnitude of chirality. Moreover, the steady-state MSD and MSV are found to have a dependence both on chirality and activity time scale and hence can be controlled by tuning the persistent duration of activity or strength of the chirality of the particle.

Title: Analytical control of the exchange interaction in periodically driven Mott insulators
Authors: Miguel Tierz
Abstract: The manipulation of electronic structure through periodic electric fields enables the reversible control of effective interactions in extended antiferromagnetic Mott insulators on ultrafast timescales. A careful analytical examination of the modulated effective interactions is conducted, accurately characterising it through the use of exact summation formulas and Bessel functions. As a result, time reversals are analytically determined in terms of Bessel zeroes. We discuss the half-filled Hubbard model, as well as multi-orbital models, various characteristics of the Kitaev-Heisenberg model, and the emergence of chiral spin terms.

Title: Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon Analogs in Full-Shell Hybrid Nanowires
Authors: M. T. Deng, Carlos Payá, Pablo San-Jose, Elsa Prada, C. M. Marcus, S. Vaitiekėnas
Abstract: We report tunneling spectroscopy of Andreev subgap states in hybrid nanowires with a thin superconducting full-shell surrounding a semiconducting core. The combination of the quantized fluxoid of the shell and the Andreev reflection at the superconductor-semiconductor interface gives rise to analogs of Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon (CdGM) states found in Abrikosov vortices in type-II superconductors. Unlike in metallic superconductors, CdGM analogs in full-shell hybrid nanowires manifest as one-dimensional van Hove singularities with energy spacings comparable to the superconducting gap and independent of the Fermi energy, making them readily observable. Evolution of these analogs with axial magnetic field, skewed within the Little-Parks lobe structure, is consistent with theory and yields information about the radial distribution and angular momenta of the corresponding subbands.

Title: Active Microrheology and Dynamic Phases for Pattern Forming Systems with Competing Interactions
Authors: C. Reichhardt, C.J.O. Reichhardt
Abstract: We consider the driven dynamics of a probe particle moving through an assembly of particles with competing long-range repulsive and short-range attractive interactions, which form crystal, stripe, labyrinth, and bubble states as the ratio of attraction to repulsion is varied. We show that the probe particle exhibits a depinning-like threshold from an elastic regime, where the probe particle is trapped by interactions with the other particles, to a plastic flow regime, where the probe particle can break bonds in the surrounding medium. For a fixed particle density, the depinning threshold and sliding velocity of the probe particle vary nonmonotonically as the attraction term is increased. A velocity minimum appears near the crystal to stripe crossover, and there is a significant increase in the depinning threshold in the bubble regime when the probe particle is strongly confined inside the bubbles. For fixed attractive interaction but increasing particle density, the behavior is also nonmonotonic and there are jumps and drops in the velocity and depinning threshold corresponding to points at which the system transitions between different structures. There are also several distinct flow states that can be characterized by the amount of plastic deformation induced by the probe particle in the surrounding medium. Each flow state generates a different amount of effective drag on the probe particle, and there can be jumps in the velocity-force curve at transitions between the states. We also find that when oriented stripes are present, the probe particle can move along the stripe in an edge transport state that has a finite Hall angle.

Title: How quantum selection rules influence the magneto-optical effects of driven, ultrafast magnetization dynamics
Authors: Mohamed F. Elhanoty, Olle Eriksson, Chin Shen Ong, Oscar Grånäs
Abstract: Ultrafast magnetization dynamics driven by ultrashort pump lasers is typically explained by changes in electronic populations and scattering pathways of excited conduction electrons. This conventional approach overlooks the fundamental role of quantum mechanical selection rules, governing transitions from core states to the conduction band, that forms the key method of the probing step in these experiments. By employing fully \textit{ab initio} time-dependent density functional theory, we reveal that these selection rules profoundly influence the interpretation of ultrafast spin dynamics at specific probe energies. Our analysis for hcp Co and fcc Ni at the M edge demonstrates that the transient dynamics, as revealed in pump-probe experiments, arise from a complex interplay of optical excitations of the M shell. Taking into account the selection rules and conduction electron spin flips, this leads to highly energy-dependent dynamics. These findings address longstanding discrepancies in experimental TMOKE measurements and show that only through meticulous consideration of matrix elements at the probe stage, can one ensure that magnetization dynamics is revealed in its true nature, instead of being muddled by artifacts arising from the choice of probe energy.

Title: Interplay between altermagnetism and topological superconductivity in an unconventional superconducting platform
Authors: Pritam Chatterjee, Vladimir Juričić
Abstract: We propose a theoretical model to investigate the interplay between altermagnetism and $p$-wave superconductivity, with a particular focus on topological phase transitions in a two-dimensional (2D) $p$-wave superconductor, considering both chiral and helical phases. Our study reveals that the emergence of helical and chiral Majorana states can be tuned by the amplitude of a $d-$wave altermagnetic order parameter, with the outcome depending on the nature of the superconducting state. In the helical superconductor, such an altermagnet can induce a topological phase transition into a gapless topological superconductor hosting Majorana flat edge modes (MFEMs). On the other hand, in the chiral superconductor, the topological transition takes place between a topologically nontrivial gapped phase and a gapless nodal-line superconductor, where the Bogoliubov quasiparticle bands intersect at an isolated line in momentum space. Remarkably, we show that when such an altermagnet is coupled to a mixed-pairing superconductor, with both chiral and helical components, a hybrid topological phase emerges, featuring dispersive Majorana edge that modes coexist with nearly flat Majorana edge states. Our findings therefore establish a novel platform for controlling and manipulating Majorana modes in unconventional superconductors with vanishing total magnetization.

Title: Twisted times, the Schwarzian and its deformations in DSSYK
Authors: Micha Berkooz, Ronny Frumkin, Ohad Mamroud, Josef Seitz
Abstract: The IR dynamics of SYK is that of the Schwarzian theory, the effective theory of broken reparametrization invariance. In the double scaling limit, SYK is completely solvable by chord diagrams, whose generating functional is a bilocal Liouville theory. At low temperatures a set of modes in this description becomes soft. We interpret them as reparametrization of some twisted time coordinates, and show explicitly that they lead to the nonlinear Schwarzian theory. We further consider deformations of the theory in the double scaling limit, giving rise to diagrams with multiple species of chords, and show that the generating functional is now a Liouville theory with multiple fields. These deformations can be tracked to the IR and we discuss how they affect the Schwarzian.

Title: Topological Responses of the Standard Model Gauge Group
Authors: Zheyan Wan, Juven Wang, Yi-Zhuang You
Abstract: Built upon the previous work on the 4d anomalies and 5d cobordism invariants (namely, 5d invertible field theory [iTFT] or symmetry-protected topological state [SPTs]) of the Standard Model [SM] gauge theory with compatible (SU(3)$\times$SU(2)$\times$U(1))/$\mathbb{Z}_q$ gauge group for $q=1,2,3,6$, we further enumerate lower-dimensional iTFT / SPTs in 4d, 3d, 2d, and 1d. While the 4d SPTs are interesting gapped phases attachable to the SM, those integer classes of SPTs (either the torsion or the free cobordism class) are not universal and are difficult to detect. However, fractional SPTs are more universal and can be detected by a topological response similar to the Hall conductance under an appropriate symmetry twist background field. We find a nontrivial symmetry-extension from a magnetic 1-symmetry U(1)$_{[1]}^m$ by an electric 1-symmetry $\mathbb{Z}_{6/q,[1]}^e$ introducing the $k \in \mathbb{Z}_{6/q}$ fractionalization class. While we also introduce the background fields for Baryon minus Lepton number $({\bf B}-{\bf L})$ like 0-symmetries of U(1)$_{{\bf Q} - N_c {\bf L}}$, U(1)$_X$, and $\mathbb{Z}_{4,X}$, that introduces two more data $\alpha \in 1,3$ and $\beta \in 1,5$ for the SMs. We present their Hall conductance response data (denoted as $\sigma, \sigma'$, and $\sigma''$ respectively), between 0-symmetry and 1-symmetry background fields, and show their fractional dependence on the SM data $(q,\alpha,\beta, k)$.

Title: Topological Leptogenesis
Authors: Juven Wang
Abstract: In the standard lore, the baryon asymmetry of the present universe is attributed to the leptogenesis from the sterile right-handed neutrino with heavy Majorana mass decaying into the Standard Model's leptons at the very early universe -- called the Majorana fermion's leptogenesis; while the electroweak sphaleron causes baryogenesis at a later time. In this work, we propose a new mechanism, named topological leptogenesis, to explain the lepton asymmetry. Topological leptogenesis replaces some of the sterile neutrinos by introducing a new gapped topological order sector (whose low-energy exhibits topological quantum field theory with long-range entanglement) that can cancel the baryon minus lepton $({\bf B} - {\bf L})$ mixed gauge-gravitational anomaly of the Standard Model. Then the Beyond-the-Standard-Model dark matter consists of topological quantum matter, such that the gapped non-particle excitations of extended line and surface defect with fractionalization and anyon charges can decay into the Standard Model particles. In addition, gravitational leptogenesis can be regarded as an intermediate step (between Majorana particle leptogenesis and topological non-particle leptogenesis) to mediate such decaying processes from the highly entangled gapped topological order excitations.

Title: Nondipole interaction between two uniformly magnetized spheres and its relation to superconducting levitation
Authors: Denis Nikolaevich Sob'yanin
Abstract: Analytically solving the magnetostatic Maxwell equations in the bispherical coordinates, we calculate the magnetic field around two uniformly magnetized spheres oriented so that their magnetic moments are parallel to the axis passing through the centers of the spheres. We demonstrate that, contrary to what is often claimed in the literature, the magnetic interaction between such spheres is not equivalent to the interaction between two point magnetic dipoles placed in the centers of the spheres. The nonzero levitation force acting on a uniformly magnetized sphere or a point magnetic dipole above a superconducting sphere in the ideal Meissner state is a clear manifestation of the non-equivalence.

Title: Optical Coherence Tomography in Soft Matter
Authors: Kasra Amini, Cornelius Wittig, Sofia Saoncella, Outi Tammisola, Fredrik Lundell, Shervin Bagheri
Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) has become an indispensable tool for investigating mesoscopic features in soft matter and fluid mechanics. Its ability to provide high-resolution, non-invasive measurements in both spatial and temporal domains bridges critical gaps in experimental instrumentation, enabling the study of complex, confined, and dynamic systems. This review serves as both an introduction to OCT and a practical guide for researchers seeking to adopt this technology. A set of tutorials, complemented by Python scripts, are provided for both intensity- and Doppler-based techniques. The versatility of OCT is illustrated through case studies, including time-resolved velocimetry, particle-based velocity measurements, slip velocity characterization, detection of shear-induced structures, and analysis of fluid-fluid and fluid-structure interactions. Drawing on our experiences, we also present a set of practical guidelines for avoiding common pitfalls.

Title: Extraordinary manifestation of near electrostatic field caused by macroscopic quantum shell effects in submicron hemispherical clusters
Authors: S. E. Kuratov, I. S. Galtsov, S. A. Dyachkov, S. Yu. Igashov
Abstract: The existence of macroscopic shell structure of submicron metal clusters is known for several decades. Since the most studies provide theoretical analysis for clusters of spherical shape, the electron density inhomogeneities caused by shell effects are spherically symmetric and do not provide long range electrostatic fields. However, similar shell structure should exist in a hemispherical cluster which conserves the closed periodic orbits of electrons, but not the spherical symmetry of electron distribution. As a result, we demonstrate that a strong electrostatic field ($E \sim 10^8$~V/m) exists in the vicinity of the flat surface of an isolated, uncharged metal nanocluster of hemispherical shape using modern approaches for electronic structure evaluation. This physical phenomenon is a consequence of the large-scale spatial inhomogeneity in distribution of electrons related to quantum shell effects in submicron metal clusters, which may find numerous applications in various fields of science and technology.

Title: Stability Exchange near Folds: Analysis of an end-loaded Elastica with a Lever Arm
Authors: Siva Prasad Chakri Dhanakoti
Abstract: Numerous problems in physical sciences can be expressed as parameter-dependent variational problems. The associated family of equilibria may or may not exist realistically and can be determined after examining its stability. Hence, it is crucial to determine the stability and track its transitions. Generally, the stability characteristics of the equilibria change near the folds in the parameter space. The direction of stability change can be encoded through a particular projection of the solutions. In this article, we identify such projections for variational problems characterized by fixed-free ends, a class of problems frequently found in mechanics. Using the developed theory, we study an Elastica subject to an end load applied through a rigid lever arm. The examples revealed several instances of snap-back instability in these systems. These findings may aid in enhancing the design of soft robot arms and other innovative switching mechanisms.

Title: Energy Dynamics Powered by Traction and Stress Control Formation and Motion of +1/2 Topological Defects in Epithelial Cell Monolayers
Authors: Pradip K. Bera, Molly McCord, Jun Zhang, Jacob Notbohm
Abstract: In confluent cell monolayers, patterns of cell forces and motion are systematically altered near topological defects in cell shape. In turn, defects have been proposed to alter cell density, extrusion, and invasion, but it remains unclear how the defects form and how they affect cell forces and motion. Here, we studied +1/2 defects, and, in contrast to prior studies, we observed both tail-to-head and head-to-tail defect motion occurring at the same time in the same cell monolayer. We quantified the cell velocities, the tractions at the cell-substrate interface, and stresses within the cell layer near +1/2 defects. Results revealed that both traction and stress are sources of activity within the epithelial cell monolayer, with their competition defining whether the cells inject or dissipate energy and determining the direction of motion of +1/2 defects. Interestingly, patterns of motion, traction, stress, and energy injection near +1/2 defects existed before defect formation, suggesting that defects form as a result of spatially coordinated patterns in cell forces and motion. These findings reverse the current picture, from one in which defects define the cell forces and motion to one in which coordinated patterns of cell forces and motion cause defects to form and move.

Title: Photon State Evolution in Arbitrary Time-Varying Media
Authors: Artuur Stevens, Christophe Caloz
Abstract: We introduce the instantaneous eigenstate method to study the evolution of quantum states in media with arbitrary time-varying permittivity and permeability. This method leverages the Heisenberg equation to bypass the Schrödinger equation, which leads to a complicated infinite set of coupled differential equations. Instead, the method allows the computation of the state evolution by solving only two coupled differential equations. Using this approach, we draw general conclusions about photon statistics in time-varying media. Our findings reveal that the maximum probability of generating a single photon pair from vacuum in such media is $25\%$, while Bell states can be created with a maximum probability of $84\%$. Additionally, we demonstrate that the spectral profile of emitted photons can be precisely controlled through the temporal profiles of permittivity and permeability. These results provide deeper insights into photon state manipulation in time-varying media. Furthermore, the instantaneous eigenstate method opens new opportunities to study state evolution in other systems where the Heisenberg equation offers a more tractable solution than the Schrödinger equation.

Title: Universal quasi-particle kinetics control the cell death decision
Authors: Felix Meige, Lina Hellwig, Harald Stachelscheid, Philipp Mergenthaler, Steffen Rulands
Abstract: Understanding how fluctuations propagate across spatial scales is central to our understanding of inanimate matter from turbulence to critical phenomena. In contrast to physical systems, biological systems are organized into a hierarchy of processes on a discrete set of spatial scales: they are compartmentalized. Here, we show that dynamic compartmentalization of stochastic systems leads to emergent, quasi-particle-like kinetics which are used by cells to perform key biological functions. Specifically, we derive a general theory that predicts the emergence of a single degree of freedom irrespective of system specifics. We obtain equations of motion and response characterising its unique kinetic properties. We experimentally demonstrate the biological relevance of quasi-particle kinetics in the decision of cells to commit suicide (apoptosis). Using fluorescent microscopy, we show that the response of cells to apoptotic stimuli exhibits quasi-particle like kinetics which establish a low-pass filter for cellular stress signals. By highlighting that cells manipulate how noise and signals propagate across spatial scales, our work reveals a new mechanism of cell fate decision-making.

Title: Modelling complex proton transport phenomena -- Exploring the limits of fine-tuning and transferability of foundational machine-learned force fields
Authors: Malte Grunert, Max Großmann, Jonas Hänseroth, Aaron Flötotto, Jules Oumard, Johannes Laurenz Wolf, Erich Runge, Christian Dreßler
Abstract: The solid acids CsH$_2$PO$_4$ and Cs$_7$(H$_4$PO$_4$)(H$_2$PO$_4$)$_8$ pose significant challenges for the simulation of proton transport phenomena. In this work, we use the recently developed machine-learned force field (MLFF) MACE to model the proton dynamics on nanosecond time scales for these systems and compare its performance with long-term ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. The MACE-MP-0 foundation model shows remarkable performance for all observables derived from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, but minor quantitative discrepancies remain compared to the AIMD reference data. However, we show that minimal fine-tuning -- fitting to as little as 1 ps of AIMD data -- leads to full quantitative agreement between the radial distribution functions of MACE force field and AIMD simulations. In addition, we show that traditional long-term AIMD simulations fail to capture the correct qualitative trends in diffusion coefficients and activation energies for these solid acids due to the limited accessible time scale. In contrast, accurate and convergent diffusion coefficients can be reliably obtained through multi-nanosecond long MD simulations using machine-learned force fields. The obtained qualitative and quantitative behavior of the converged diffusion coefficients and activation energies now matches the experimental trends for both solid acids, in contrast to previous AIMD simulations that yielded a qualitatively wrong picture.

Title: Direct Sampling of Confined Polygons in Linear Time
Authors: Clayton Shonkwiler, Kandin Theis
Abstract: We present an algorithm for sampling tightly confined random equilateral closed polygons in three-space which has runtime linear in the number of edges. Using symplectic geometry, sampling such polygons reduces to sampling a moment polytope, and in our confinement model this polytope turns out to be very natural from a combinatorial point of view. This connection to combinatorics yields both our fast sampling algorithm and explicit formulas for the expected distances of vertices to the origin. We use our algorithm to investigate the expected total curvature of confined polygons, leading to a very precise conjecture for the asymptotics of total curvature.

Title: Response Kinetic Uncertainty Relation for Markovian Open Quantum System
Authors: Kangqiao Liu, Jie Gu
Abstract: The thermodynamics and kinetics of a nonequilibrium classical system fundamentally constrain the precision of an observable regarding the celebrated thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) and the kinetic uncertainty relation (KUR). They have been extended to open quantum systems obeying the Lindblad master equation where unique quantum effects are identified. Recently, a new set of principles that further incorporate the response of a classical system to an external perturbation have been discovered, named the response TUR and the response KUR (R-KUR). In this work, we generalize the classical R-KUR using the quantum Cramér-Rao bound to the steady state of the Lindblad master equation. The precision and the sensitivity of a measured observable are bounded from above by the conventional quantum dynamical activity and a perturbation-induced inter-subspace transition term. We provide sufficient conditions such that either of the two contributions vanishes, implying their equal importance. We verify our result and illustrate the conditions in an exactly solvable two-level atom.

Title: Three Simple Stokeslet Trajectories
Authors: Benjamin J. Landrum
Abstract: Exact results for three trajectories of small numbers of particles interacting hydrodynamically through Stokeslets are presented. First, the middle particle in a vertical trio of particles sediments at a constant velocity for all time. Second, a horizontal pair of particles sedimenting toward a rigid wall undergo a finite and surprisingly constant horizontal displacement in the limit of large initial separations. Third, a pair of particles sedimenting in a quadratic flow, such as that of a fluid pumped in the direction of gravity, oscillates in a periodic orbit and admits a Hamiltonian formulation.

Title: Improving signal-to-noise ratios in pump-probe spectroscopy on light-sensitive samples by adapting pulse repetition rates
Authors: Matthias C. Velsink, Maksym Illienko, Komal Chaudhary, Stefan Witte
Abstract: Ultrafast optical pump-probe spectroscopy is a powerful tool to study dynamics in solid materials on femto- and picosecond timescales. In such experiments, a pump pulse induces dynamics inside a sample by impulsive light-matter interaction, resulting in dynamics that can be detected using a time-delayed probe pulse. In addition to the desired dynamics, the initial interaction may also lead to unwanted effects that may result in irreversible changes and even damage. Therefore, the achievable signal strength is often limited by the pumping conditions that a sample can sustain. Here we investigate the optimization of ultrafast photoacoustics in various solid thin films. We perform systematic experiments aimed at maximizing the achievable signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio in a given measurement time while limiting sample damage. By varying pump and probe pulse energies, average pump fluence, and repetition rate, we identify different paths towards optimal SNR depending on material properties. Our results provide a strategy for the design of pump-probe experiments, to optimize achievable SNR for samples in which different damage mechanisms may dominate.

Title: Tomographic identification of all molecular orbitals in a wide binding energy range

Abstract: In the past decade, photoemission orbital tomography (POT) has evolved into a powerful tool to investigate the electronic structure of organic molecules adsorbed on surfaces. Here we show that POT allows for the comprehensive experimental identification of all molecular orbitals in a substantial binding energy range, in the present case more than 10 eV. Making use of the angular distribution of photoelectrons as a function of binding energy, we exemplify this by extracting orbital-resolved partial densities of states (pDOS) for 15 $\pi$ and 23 $\sigma$ orbitals from the experimental photoemission intensities of the prototypical organic molecule bisanthene (C$_{28}$H$_{14}$) on a Cu(110) surface. In their entirety, these experimentally measured orbital-resolved pDOS for an essentially complete set of orbitals serve as a stringent benchmark for electronic structure methods, which we illustrate by performing density functional theory (DFT) calculations employing four frequently-used exchange-correlation functionals. By computing the respective molecular-orbital-projected densities of states of the bisanthene/Cu(110) interface, a one-to-one comparison with experimental data for an unprecedented number of 38 orbital energies becomes possible. The quantitative analysis of our data reveals that the range-separated hybrid functional HSE performs best for the investigated organic/metal interface. At a more fundamental level, the remarkable agreement between the experimental and the Kohn-Sham orbital energies over a binding energy range larger than 10\,eV suggests that -- perhaps unexpectedly -- Kohn-Sham orbitals approximate Dyson orbitals, which would rigorously account for the electron extraction process in photoemission spectroscopy but are notoriously difficult to compute, in a much better way than previously thought.

Title: Mean-Field Dynamics of the Bose-Hubbard Model in High Dimension
Authors: Denis Périce, Shahnaz Farhat, Sören Petrat
Abstract: The Bose-Hubbard model effectively describes bosons on a lattice with on-site interactions and nearest-neighbour hopping, serving as a foundational framework for understanding strong particle interactions and the superfluid to Mott insulator transition. This paper aims to rigorously establish the validity of a mean-field approximation for the dynamics of quantum systems in high dimension, using the Bose--Hubbard model on a square lattice as a case study. We prove a trace norm estimate between the one-lattice-site reduced density of the Schrödinger dynamics and the mean-field dynamics in the limit of large dimension. Here, the mean-field approximation is in the hopping amplitude and not in the interaction, leading to a very rich and non-trivial mean-field equation. This mean-field equation does not only describe the condensate, as is the case when the mean-field description comes from a large particle number limit averaging out the interaction, but it allows for a phase transition to a Mott insulator since it contains the full non-trivial interaction. Our work is a rigorous justification of a simple case of the highly successful dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) for bosons, which somewhat surprisingly yields many qualitatively correct results in three dimensions.

Title: Fermionic cellular automata in one dimension
Authors: Lorenzo S. Trezzini, Matteo Lugli, Paolo Meda, Alessandro Bisio, Paolo Perinotti, Alessandro Tosini
Abstract: We consider quantum cellular automata for one-dimensional chains of Fermionic modes and study their implementability as finite depth quantum circuits. Fermionic automata have been classified in terms of an index modulo circuits and the addition of ancillary systems. We strengthen this result removing the ancilla degrees of freedom in defining the equivalence classes. A complete characterization of nearest-neighbours automata is given. A class of Fermionic automata is found which cannot be expressed in terms of single mode and controlled-phase gates composed with shifts, as is the case for qubit cellular automata.

Title: Efficient Qubit Calibration by Binary-Search Hamiltonian Tracking

Abstract: We present a real-time method for calibrating the frequency of a resonantly driven qubit. The real-time processing capabilities of a controller dynamically compute adaptive probing sequences for qubit-frequency estimation. Each probing time and drive frequency are calculated to divide the prior probability distribution into two branches, following a locally optimal strategy that mimics a conventional binary search. We show the algorithm's efficacy by stabilizing a flux-tunable transmon qubit, leading to improved coherence and gate fidelity. By feeding forward the updated qubit frequency, the FPGA-powered control electronics also mitigates non-Markovian noise in the system, which is detrimental to quantum error correction. Our protocol highlights the importance of feedback in improving the calibration and stability of qubits subject to drift and can be readily applied to other qubit platforms.

Title: Disentangling Interacting Systems with Fermionic Gaussian Circuits: Application to Quantum Impurity Models
Authors: Ang-Kun Wu, Benedikt Kloss, Wladislaw Krinitsin, Matthew T. Fishman, J. H. Pixley, E. M. Stoudenmire
Abstract: Tensor network quantum states are powerful tools for strongly correlated systems, tailored to capture local correlations such as in ground states with entanglement area laws. When applying tensor network states to interacting fermionic systems, a proper choice of the basis or orbitals can reduce the bond dimension of tensors and provide physically relevant orbitals. We introduce such a change of basis with unitary gates obtained from compressing fermionic Gaussian states into quantum circuits corresponding to various tensor networks. These circuits can reduce the ground state entanglement entropy and improve the performance of algorithms such as the density matrix renormalization group. We study the Anderson impurity model with one and two impurities to show the potential of the method for improving computational efficiency and interpreting impurity physics. Furthermore, fermionic Gaussian circuits can also suppress entanglement during the time evolution out of low-energy state. Last, we consider Gaussian multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (GMERA) circuits which compress fermionic Gaussian states hierarchically. The emergent coarse-grained physical models from these GMERA circuits are studied in terms of their entanglement properties and suitability for performing time evolution.

Title: Magneto-optics of a charge-tunable quantum dot -- Observation of a negative diamagnetic shift
Authors: Giora Peniakov, Ayal Beck, Eilon Poem, Zu-En Su, Boaz Taitler, Sven Hoefling, Garnett. W. Bryant, David Gershoni
Abstract: We present magneto-optical studies of a self-assembled semiconductor quantum dot in neutral and positively charged states. The diamagnetic shifts and Zeeman splitting of many well-identified optical transitions are precisely measured. Remarkably, a pronounced negative diamagnetic shift is observed for spectral lines resulting from a doubly positively charged excitonic complex. We use the Hartree - Fock approximation for describing the direct Coulomb and exchange interactions between the quantum dot confined carriers in various configurations. A simple harmonic potential model, which we extend to capture the influence of an externally applied magnetic field in Faraday configuration, is then used to quantitatively account for all the measured diamagnetic shifts. We show that the negative shift is due to the change in the hole-hole exchange interaction energy induced by the magnetic field. Using this model and the measured shifts we extract the dielectric constant of the quantum dot material and get a decent estimate of the quantum dot dimensions. Further, the measured Zeeman splitting of the various spectral lines are also explained by a simple model using algebraic sums and differences of the $g$-factors of the confined charge carriers in their respective first and second discrete energy levels. Finally, the obtained values of the electronic $g$-factor and that of the dielectric constant are independently used to determine the effective composition (x) of the ternary In$_{x}$Ga$_{1-x}$As quantum dot. Both agree to within the experimental uncertainties.

Title: Realizing multiband states with ultracold dipolar quantum simulators
Authors: Yuliya Bilinskaya, Michael Hughes, Paolo Molignini
Abstract: The manipulation of dipolar interactions within ultracold molecular ensembles represents a pivotal advancement in experimental physics, aiming at the emulation of quantum phenomena unattainable through mere contact interactions. Our study uncovers regimes of multiband occupation which allow to probe more realistic, complex long-range interacting lattice models with ultracold dipolar simulators. By mapping out experimentally relevant ranges of potential depths, interaction strengths, particle fillings, and geometric configurations, we calculate the agreement between the state prepared in the quantum simulator and a target lattice state. We do so by separately calculating numerically exact many-body wave functions in the continuum and single- or multiband lattice representations, and building their many-body state overlaps. Our findings reveal that for shallow lattices and stronger interactions above half filling, multiband population increases, resulting in fundamentally different ground states than the ones observed in simple lowest-band descriptions, e.g. striped vs checkerboard states. A wide range of probed parameter regimes in its turn provides a systematic and quantitative blueprint for realizing multiband states with two-dimensional quantum simulators employing ultracold dipolar molecules.

Title: Practical realization of chiral nonlinearity for strong topological protection
Authors: Xinxin Guo, Lucien Jezequel, Mathieu Padlewski, Hervé Lissek, Pierre Delplace, Romain Fleury
Abstract: Nonlinear topology has been much less inquired compared to its linear counterpart. Existing advances have focused on nonlinearities of limited magnitudes and fairly homogeneous types. As such, the realizations have rarely been concerned with the requirements for nonlinearity. Here we explore nonlinear topological protection by determining nonlinear rules and demonstrate their relevance in real-world experiments. We take advantage of chiral symmetry and identify the condition for its continuation in general nonlinear environments. Applying it to one-dimensional topological lattices, we show possible evolution paths for zero-energy edge states that preserve topologically nontrivial phases regardless of the specifics of the chiral nonlinearities. Based on an acoustic prototype design with non-local nonlinearities, we theoretically, numerically, and experimentally implement the nonlinear topological edge states that persist in all nonlinear degrees and directions without any frequency shift. Our findings unveil a broad family of nonlinearities compatible with topological non-triviality, establishing a solid ground for future drilling in the emergent field of nonlinear topology.

Title: Spin caloritronics as a probe of nonunitary superconductors
Authors: Taiki Matsushita, Takeshi Mizushima, Yusuke Masaki, Satoshi Fujimoto, Ilya Vekhter
Abstract: Superconducting spintronics explores the interplay between superconductivity and magnetism, sparking significant interest in nonunitary superconductors as a platform for novel magneto-superconducting phenomena. However, identifying nonunitary superconductors remains challenging. We demonstrate that spin current driven by thermal gradients sensitively probes the nature of the condensate in nonunitary superconductors. Spin polarization of the condensate in momentum space induces the superconducting spin Seebeck effect, where a spin current is generated along thermal gradients without a thermoelectric charge current. Notably, the nonvanishing superconducting spin Seebeck effect provides a smoking gun evidence of nonunitary superconductivity because it reflects the spin polarization of the condensate in momentum space, irrespective of whether the net pair spin magnetization vanishes. At the same time, the spin-chirality of the condensate induces the spin-Nernst effect, where a spin current is generated perpendicular to thermal gradients in nonunitary superconductors. These spin caloritronics phenomena offer a definitive probe of nonunitary superconductors.

Title: Topological states constructed by two different trivial quantum wires
Authors: Jing-Run Lin, Linxi Lv, Zheng-Wei Zuo
Abstract: The topological states of the two-leg and three-leg ladders formed by two trivial quantum wires with different lattice constants are theoretically investigated. Firstly, we take two trivial quantum wires with a lattice constant ratio of 1:2 as an example. For the symmetric nearest-neighbor intra-chain hopping two-leg ladder, the inversion symmetry protected topological insulator phase with two degenerate topological edge states appears. When the inversion symmetry is broken, the topological insulators with one or two topological edge states of different energies and topological metals with edge states embedded in the bulk states could emerge depending on the filling factor. The topological origin of these topological states in the two-leg ladders is the topological properties of the Chern insulators and Chern metals. According to the arrangement of two trivial quantum wires, we construct two types of three-leg ladders. Each type of the three-leg ladder could be divided into one trivial subspace and one topological nontrivial subspace by unitary transformation. The topological nontrivial subspace corresponds to the effective two-leg ladder model. As the filling factor changes, the system could be in topological insulators or topological metals phases. When the two-leg ladder is constructed by two trivial quantum wires with a lattice constant ratio of 1:3 and 2:3, the system could also realize rich topological states such as the topological insulators and topological metals with the topological edge states. These rich topological states in the two-leg and three-leg ladders could be confirmed by current experimental techniques.

Title: Fast single atom imaging for optical lattice arrays
Authors: Lin Su, Alexander Douglas, Michal Szurek, Anne H. Hebert, Aaron Krahn, Robin Groth, Gregory A. Phelps, Ognjen Markovic, Markus Greiner
Abstract: High-resolution fluorescence imaging of ultracold atoms and molecules is paramount to performing quantum simulation and computation in optical lattices and tweezers. Imaging durations in these experiments typically range from a millisecond to a second, significantly limiting the cycle time. In this work, we present fast, 2.4 microseconds single-atom imaging in lattices, with 99.4% fidelity - pushing the readout duration of neutral atom quantum platforms to be close to that of superconducting qubit platforms. Additionally, we thoroughly study the performance of accordion lattices. We also demonstrate number-resolved imaging without parity projection, which will facilitate experiments such as the exploration of high-filling phases in the extended Bose-Hubbard models, multi-band or SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard models, and quantum link models.

Title: Loschmidt echo, emerging dual unitarity and scaling of generalized temporal entropies after quenches to the critical point
Authors: Stefano Carignano, Luca Tagliacozzo
Abstract: We show how the Loschmidt echo of a product state after a quench to a conformal invariant critical point and its leading finite time corrections can be predicted by using conformal field theories (CFT). We check such predictions with tensor networks, finding excellent agreement. As a result, we can use the Loschmidt echo to extract the universal information of the underlying CFT including the central charge, the operator content, and its generalized temporal entropies. We are also able to predict and confirm an emerging dual-unitarity of the evolution at late times, since the spatial transfer matrix operator that evolves the system in space becomes unitary in such limit. Our results on the growth of temporal entropies also imply that, using state-of-the art tensor networks algorithms, such calculations only require resources that increase polynomially with the duration of the quench, thus providing an example of numerically efficiently solvable out-of-equilibrium scenario.

Title: Unbounded entropy production and violent fragmentation for repulsive-to-attractive interaction quench in long-range interacting systems
Authors: P. Molignini, B. Chakrabarti
Abstract: We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of a one-dimensional Bose gas with long-range interactions that decay as $(\frac{1}{r^{\alpha}})$ $(0.5 < \alpha <4.0$). We investigate exotic dynamics when the interactions are suddenly switched from strongly repulsive to strongly attractive, a procedure known to generate super-Tonks-Girardeau gases in systems with contact interactions. We find that relaxation is achieved through a complex intermediate dynamics demonstrated by violent fragmentation and chaotic delocalization. We establish that the relaxed state exhibits classical gaseous characteristics and an asymptotic state associated with unbounded entropy production. The phase diagram shows an exponential boundary between the coherent (quantum) gas and the chaotic (classical) gas. We show the universality of the dynamics by also presenting analogous results for spinless fermions. Weaker quench protocols give a certain degree of control over the relaxation process and induce a slower initial entropy growth. Our study showcases the complex relaxation behavior of tunable long-range interacting systems that could be engineered in state-of-the-art experiments, e.g. in trapped ions or Rydberg atoms.

Title: Quantification of the heavy-hole--light-hole mixing in two-dimensional hole gases
Authors: Peter Stano, Daniel Loss
Abstract: We theoretically investigate heavy-hole--light-hole mixing in two-dimensional hole gases (2DHG). We restrict our analysis to the zone center, appropriate for the low-density regime, which leads to a simple description, analytical results, and physical insights. We identify two different types of hole-Hamiltonian terms concerning mixing. The first type changes the direction of the pure spinors, without admixing light-hole components. It is efficient for Rabi driving the heavy-hole spin. The second type induces mixing and changes the eigenvalues of the $g$-tensor. We analyze several measures that characterize the mixing quantitatively in Ge, Si, and GaAs, namely the $g$-factor, the light-hole weight in the wave function, the off-diagonal matrix elements in the Hamiltonian, and the strength of the induced spin-orbit interaction. We identify the canonical coordinate frame associated with a generic spin-3/2 Hamiltonian with time-reversal symmetry (TRS). In this coordinate frame, the mixing is quantified by a single parameter, the mixing angle $\vartheta$. We interpret it as the canonical (coordinate-frame and Hamiltonian-basis independent) measure of the heavy-hole--light-hole mixing. All the investigated mixing measures are simple functions of $\vartheta$. As an illustration, we use our model to analyze heavy-hole spin qubit $g$-tensor, dephasing, relaxation, and Rabi frequencies, interpreting the arising effects as due to rotations of the canonical frame and changes of the mixing angle $\vartheta$.

Title: Stacking-engineered ferroelectricity and multiferroic order in van der Waals magnets
Authors: Daniel Bennett, Gabriel Martínez-Carracedo, Xu He, Jaime Ferrer, Philippe Ghosez, Riccardo Comin, Efthimios Kaxiras
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials that exhibit spontaneous magnetization, polarization or strain (referred to as ferroics) have the potential to revolutionize nanotechnology by enhancing the multifunctionality of nanoscale devices. However, multiferroic order is difficult to achieve, requiring complicated coupling between electron and spin degrees of freedom. We propose a universal method to engineer multiferroics from van der Waals magnets by taking advantage of the fact that changing the stacking between 2D layers can break inversion symmetry, resulting in ferroelectricity and possibly magnetoelectric coupling. We illustrate this concept using first-principles calculations in bilayer NiI$_2$, which can be made ferroelectric upon rotating two adjacent layers by $180^{\circ}$ with respect to the bulk stacking. Furthermore, we discover a novel multiferroic order induced by interlayer charge transfer which couples the interlayer spin order and electronic polarization. Our approach is not only general but also systematic, and can enable the discovery of a wide variety of 2D multiferroics.

Title: Magnetic properties and enhanced magnetocaloric effect in EuAl$_3$Si single crystals
Authors: Hai Zeng, Shuo Zou, Zhou Wang, Ziyu Li, Kangjian Luo, Yongkang Luo
Abstract: This study presents systematic investigations into the growth and physical properties of EuAl$_3$Si single crystals, encompassing magnetic, transport, and thermodynamic analyses. EuAl$_3$Si undergoes a ferromagnetic transition at $T_C$ = 15 K. A significant reversible magnetocaloric effect was observed around $T_C$. Strikingly, with a small change of magnetic field 2 T, the maximum values of magnetic entropy change (13.4 J/kg K), refrigerant capacity (166 J/kg) and adiabatic temperature change (7.2 K) are found. These parameters respectively are 60%, 148% and 64% larger than those of the parent compound EuAl$_4$, and suggest EuAl$_3$Si as an excellent candidate for magnetic refrigeration applications near the temperature of liquid hydrogen. The possible mechanism for this enhancement is also discussed.

Title: Dynamic phase transition into a mixed-CDW state in 1$T$-TaS$_2$ via a thermal quench

Abstract: Ultrafast light-matter interaction has emerged as a new mechanism to exert control over the macroscopic properties of quantum materials toward novel functionality. To date, technological applications of these non-thermal phases are limited by their ultrashort lifetimes and low-ordering temperatures. Among the most studied photoinduced metastable phases for their technological promise is the hidden metallic charge density wave (H-CDW) in the model correlated CDW compound 1$T$-TaS$_2$. Despite active study and engineering, the nature of the photoinduced H-CDW remains the subject of debate and is only accessible at cryogenic temperatures. Here, we stabilize the H-CDW phase at thermal equilibrium up to near-room temperature by accessing an intermediate mixed CDW order regime via thermal quenching. Using x-ray high dynamic range reciprocal space mapping (HDRM) and scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS), we reveal the coexistence of commensurate (C) CDW and H-CDW domains below 180 K during cooling and below 210 K during warming. Our findings show that each order parameter breaks basal plane mirror symmetry with different chiral orientations and induces out-of-plane unit cell tripling in the H-CDW phase. Despite metallic domain walls and a finite density of states at zero bias observed via STS, bulk resistance remains insulating due to CDW stacking disorder. This study establishes the H-CDW as a thermally stable phase and introduces a new mechanism for switchable metallic behavior in thin flakes of 1$T$-TaS$_2$ and similar materials with competing order phases.

Title: Influence of surface relaxations on scanning probe microscopy images of the charge density wave material 2H-NbSe$_2$
Authors: Nikhil S. Sivakumar, Joost Aretz, Sebastian Scherb, Marion van Midden Mavrič, Nora Huijgen, Umut Kamber, Daniel Wegner, Alexander A. Khajetoorians, Malte Rösner, Nadine Hauptmann
Abstract: Scanning tunneling microscopy is the method of choice for characterizing charge density waves by imaging the variation in atomic-scale contrast of the surface. Due to the measurement principle of scanning tunneling microscopy, the electronic and lattice degrees of freedom are convoluted, making it difficult to disentangle a structural displacement from spatial variations in the electronic structure. In this work, we characterize the influence of the displacement of the surface-terminating Se atoms on the 3 x 3 charge density wave contrast in scanning probe microscopy images of 2H-NbSe$_2$. In scanning tunneling microscopy images, we observe the 3 x 3 charge density wave superstructure and atomic lattice at all probed tip-sample distances. In contrast, non-contact atomic force microscopy images show both periodicities only at small tip-sample distances while, unexpectedly, a 3 x 3 superstructure is present at larger tip-sample distances. Using density functional theory calculations, we qualitatively reproduce the experimental findings and indicate that the 3 x 3 superstructure at different tip-sample distances in non-contact atomic force microscopy images is a result from different underlying interactions. In addition, we show that the displacement of the surface-terminating Se atoms has a negligible influence to the contrast in scanning tunneling microscopy images. Our combined experimental and theoretic work presents a method on how to discriminate the influence of the surface corrugation from the variation of the charge density to the charge density wave contrast in scanning probe microscopy images, which can provide insights into the influence of structural disorder to a charge density wave ground state.

Title: Deconvoluting Thermomechanical Effects in X-ray Diffraction Data using Machine Learning
Authors: Rachel E. Lim, Shun-Li Shang, Chihpin Chuang, Thien Q. Phan, Zi-Kui Liu, Darren C. Pagan
Abstract: X-ray diffraction is ideal for probing sub-surface state during complex or rapid thermomechanical loading of crystalline materials. However, challenges arise as the size of diffraction volumes increases due to spatial broadening and inability to deconvolute the effects of different lattice deformation mechanisms. Here, we present a novel approach to use combinations of physics-based modeling and machine learning to deconvolve thermal and mechanical elastic strains for diffraction data analysis. The method builds on a previous effort to extract thermal strain distribution information from diffraction data. The new approach is applied to extract the evolution of thermomechanical state during laser melting of an Inconel 625 wall specimen which produces significant residual stress upon cooling. A combination of heat transfer and fluid flow, elasto-plasticity, and X-ray diffraction simulations are used to generate training data for machine-learning (Gaussian Process Regression, GPR) models that map diffracted intensity distributions to underlying thermomechanical strain fields. First-principles density functional theory is used to determine accurate temperature-dependent thermal expansion and elastic stiffness used for elasto-plasticity modeling. The trained GPR models are found to be capable of deconvoluting the effects of thermal and mechanical strains, in addition to providing information about underlying strain distributions, even from complex diffraction patterns with irregularly shaped peaks.

Title: Magnetic properties of monolayer, multilayer, and bulk CrTe$_2$
Authors: A. A. Katanin, E. M. Agapov
Abstract: We investigate magnetic properties of CrTe$_2$ within the density functional theory (DFT) approach in ferromagnetic phase and combination of DFT and dynamical mean field theory (DFT+DMFT) approach in paramagnetic phase. We show that few layer CrTe$_2$ possesses well formed local magnetic moments. In the single layer CrTe$_2$ we find antiferromagnetic exchange with 120\degree antiferromagnetic structure most preferable. In the bilayer and trilayer systems electronic correlations in DFT+DMFT approach yield ferromagnetic exchange interaction within each layer, but the interaction between the layers is antiferromagnetic, such that alternation of the direction of magnetization of the layers is expected. In bulk CrTe$_2$ we find the tendency to ferromagnetic order at low temperature, but with increase of temperature antiferromagnetic correlations between the layers dominate. Determination of the critical number of layers at which the interlayer antiferromagnetic order changes to the ferromagnetic one, likely requires consideration of the non-local Coulomb interactions.

Title: Elastic properties of Cu-6wt\%Ag alloy wires for pulsed magnets investigated by ultrasonic techniques
Authors: Ziyu Li, Tianyi Gu, Wenqi Wei, Yang Yuan, Zhuo Wang, Kangjian Luo, Yupeng Pan, Jianfeng Xie, Shaozhe Zhang, Tao Peng, Lin Liu, Qi Chen, Xiaotao Han, Yongkang Luo, Liang Li
Abstract: Conductor materials with good mechanical performance as well as high electrical- and thermal-conductivities are particularly important to break through the current bottle-neck limit ($\sim 100$ T) of pulsed magnets. Here we perform systematic studies on the elastic properties of the Cu-6wt\%Ag alloy wires, a promising candidate material for the new-generation pulsed magnets, by employing two independent ultrasonic techniques - resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS) and ultrasound pulse-echo experiments. Our RUS measurements manifest that the elastic properties of the Cu-6wt\%Ag alloy wires can be improved by an electroplastic drawing procedure as compared with the conventional cold drawing. We also take this chance to test the availability of our newly-built ultrasound pulse-echo facility at Wuhan National High Magnetic Field Center (WHMFC, China), and the results suggest that the elastic performance of the electroplastically-drawn Cu-6wt\%Ag alloy wire remains excellent without anomalous softening under extreme conditions, e.g., ultra-high magnetic field up to 50 T, nitrogen / helium cryogenic liquids.

Title: Statistics of systemwide correlations in the random-field XXZ chain: Importance of rare events in the many-body localized phase
Authors: Jeanne Colbois, Fabien Alet, Nicolas Laflorencie
Abstract: Motivated by recent debates around the many-body localization (MBL) problem, and in particular its stability against systemwide resonances, we investigate long-distance spin-spin correlations across the phase diagram of the random-field XXZ model, with a particular focus on the strong disorder regime. Building on state-of-the-art shift-invert diagonalization techniques, we study the high-energy behavior of transverse and longitudinal correlation functions, computed at the largest possible distance, for a broad range of disorder and interaction strengths. Our results show that while transverse correlations display a fairly stable exponential decay over the entire XXZ phase diagram, longitudinal correlations exhibit markedly different behavior, revealing distinct physical regimes. More precisely, we identify an intermediate disorder region where standard observables show well-converged MBL behavior [J. Colbois et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 116502 (2024)] while the distributions of longitudinal correlations reveal unexpected fat-tails towards large values. These rare events strongly influence the average decay of longitudinal correlations, which we find to be algebraic in a broad region inside the supposed MBL phase, whereas the typical decay remains mostly exponential. At stronger disorder and weaker interactions, this intermediate regime is replaced by a more conventional exponential decay with short correlation lengths for both typical and average correlators, as expected for standard localization. Our findings shed light on the systemwide instabilities and raise important questions about the impact of such rare but large long-range correlations on the stability of the MBL phase. Finally, we discuss the possible fate of the intermediate region in the context of recent perspectives in the field.

Title: Theory of the spin Seebeck effect influenced by crystal-field excitations in Tb$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$
Authors: Michiyasu Mori, Bruno Tomasello, Timothy Ziman
Abstract: The spin Seebeck effect (SSE) is a phenomenon of thermoelectric generation that occurs within a device consisting of a bilayer of a metal and a ferromagnet. When Tb$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$ (TbIG) is substituted for the ferromagnet, the effect goes to zero at low temperatures, yet it increases to positive values with the application of a magnetic field. This is opposite to the expectation that the SSE should be suppressed by a magnetic field due to the increase in the magnon gap. In this paper, the crystal-field excitations (CFE) in TbIG are calculated within a mean field theory exploiting the parameters of Terbium Gallium Garnet Tb$_3$Ga$_5$O$_{12}$ (TGG) from the neutron-scattering experimental literature. Like TGG, the primitive cell of TbIG hosts twelve Tb sites with six inequivalent magnetic sublattices, but due to the net $[111]$-molecular field from the tetrahedral and octahedral Fe ions, these can be classified into two distinct groups, the $\mathbf{C}$ and the $\mathbf{C'}$ sites, which account for the `double umbrella' magnetic structure. We show that when an external magnetic field is applied along the [111] direction of the crystal, the lowest CFE of the $\mathbf{C}$ sublattices decreases. As a consequence of the magnetic field dependence of the lowest CFE, we find that at low temperatures the SSE in TbIG can result enhanced by an applied magnetic field.

Title: Family of third-order topological insulators from Su-Schrieffer-Heeger stacking
Authors: Xun-Jiang Luo, Jia-Zheng Li, Meng Xiao, Fengcheng Wu
Abstract: We construct a family of chiral symmetry-protected third-order topological insulators by stacking Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chains and provide a unified topological characterization by a series of Bott indices. Our approach is informed by the analytical solution of corner states for the model Hamiltonians written as a summation of the extended SSH model along three orthogonal directions. By utilizing the generalized Pauli matrices, an enumeration of the constructed model Hamiltonians generates ten distinct models, including the well-studied three-dimensional Benalcazar-Bernevig-Hughes model. By performing a boundary projection analysis for the ten models, we find that certain surfaces and hinges of the systems can exhibit, respectively, nontrivial second-order and first-order topology in the phase of the third-order topological insulators. Furthermore, we analyze the phase diagram for one of the predicted models and reveal a rich set of topological phases, including the third-order topological insulators, second-order weak topological insulators, and second-order nodal semimetals.

Title: Complete mathematical theory of the jamming transition: A perspective
Authors: Alessio Zaccone
Abstract: The jamming transition of frictionless athermal particles is a paradigm to understand the mechanics of amorphous materials at the atomic scale. Concepts related to the jamming transition and the mechanical response of jammed packings have cross-fertilized into other areas such as atomistic descriptions of the elasticity and plasticity of glasses. In this perspective article, the microscopic mathematical theory of the jamming transition is reviewed from first-principles. The starting point of the derivation is a microscopically-reversible particle-bath Hamiltonian from which the governing equation of motion for the grains under an external deformation is derived. From this equation of motion, microscopic expressions are obtained for both the shear modulus and the viscosity as a function of the distance from the jamming transition (respectively, above and below the transition). Regarding the vanishing of the shear modulus at the unjamming transition, this theory, as originally demonstrated in [Zaccone & Scossa-Romano, Phys. Rev. B 83, 184205 (2011)], is currently the only quantitative microscopic theory in parameter-free agreement with numerical simulations of [O'Hern et al. Phys. Rev. E 68, 011306 (2003)] for jammed packings. The divergence of the viscosity upon approaching the jamming transition from below is derived here, for the first time, from the same microscopic Hamiltonian. The quantitative microscopic prediction of the diverging viscosity is shown to be in fair agreement with numerical results of sheared 2D soft disks from [Olsson & Teitel, Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 178001 (2007)].

Title: On modeling fracture of soft polymers
Authors: Aditya Konale, Vikas Srivastava
Abstract: Soft polymers are ubiquitous materials in nature and as engineering materials with properties varying from rate-independent to rate-dependent depending on the crosslinking mechanisms. Current fracture toughness measures are non-unique for rate-dependent soft materials for varying loading profiles and specimen geometries. Works on modeling fracture in rate-dependent soft polymers are limited to specific pre-cracked geometries. There is no generally agreed-upon model for the fracture of soft polymers. We propose and show that a critical value of stress work $\mathit{W}_{cr}$ obtained from simple homogeneous deformation experiments can be used as a simple experimental scalar measure of fracture resistance in soft polymers. We also develop a damage model to predict fracture in soft polymers through a generalized gradient damage framework based on the method of virtual power. The energetic part of the critical stress work is proposed as a damage initiation criterion. In the model, material strength, which is an important component of phase field damage models, is explicitly accounted for. The fracture model is validated and demonstrated to work well for both elastomers and viscous soft polymers by comparing model predictions against experimental results for different materials (ethylene propylene diene monomer - EPDM, EPS25 vitrimer, styrene butadiene rubber - SBR, and polyborosiloxane - PBS), a variety of specimen geometries, and loading conditions. The model is able to predict key physical phenomena and microstructural physical quantities, such as subchain dissociation energy during the fracture of soft polymers.

Title: Electron transverse transport enhancement by composite formation
Authors: Sang J. Park, Hojun Lee, Jongjun M. Lee, Jangwoo Ha, Hyun-Woo Lee, Hyungyu Jin
Abstract: Anomalous transverse transport of electrons such as the anomalous Hall effect and the anomalous Nernst effect provide opportunities to realize advanced spintronic and thermoelectric devices. To materialize these opportunities, it is crucial to strengthen the transverse transport. There have been considerable efforts to find new materials that fulfill this goal. Topological materials received a surge of recent attention in this regard. Here we report a different approach to enhance the transverse transport. Instead of searching for new materials, we propose mixing known materials to form composites. We show theoretically that randomly mixed arrays of two materials can exhibit significantly stronger transverse transport than the constituent materials. This enhancement is experimentally demonstrated for mixtures of crystallized and amorphous ferromagnetic metals. We identify the requirement of this enhancement, which can be satisfied by a wide class of materials. Thus, this scheme provides a universal method to strengthen transverse transport, together with rooms to accommodate various engineering requirements for device applications.

Title: 3D Printing of Near-Ambient Responsive Liquid Crystal Elastomers with Enhanced Nematic Order and Pluralized Transformation
Authors: Dongxiao Li, Yuxuan Sun, Xingjian Li, Xingxiang Li, Zhengqing Zhu, Boxi Sun, Shutong Nong, Jiyang Wu, Tingrui Pan, Weihua Li, Shiwu Zhang, Mujun Li
Abstract: Liquid Crystal Elastomers with near-ambient temperature-responsiveness (NAT-LCEs) have been extensively studied for building bio-compatible, low-power consumption devices and robotics. However, conventional manufacturing methods face limitations in programmability (e.g., molding) or low nematic order (e.g., DIW printing). Here, a hybrid cooling strategy is proposed for programmable 3D printing of NAT-LCEs with enhanced nematic order, intricate shape forming, and morphing capability. By integrating a low-temperature nozzle and a cooling platform into a 3D printer, the resulting temperature field synergistically facilitates mesogen alignment during extrusion and disruption-free UV cross-linking. This method achieves a nematic order 3000% higher than NAT-LCEs fabricated using traditional room temperature 3D printing. Enabled by shifting of transition temperature during hybrid cooling printing, printed sheets spontaneously turn into 3D structures after release from the platform, exhibiting bidirectional deformation with heating and cooling. By adjusting the nozzle and plate temperatures, NAT-LCEs with graded properties can be fabricated for intricate shape morphing. A wristband system with enhanced heart rate monitoring is also developed based on 3D-printed NAT-LCE. Our method may open new possibilities for soft robotics, biomedical devices, and wearable electronics.

Title: Autoregressive neural quantum states of Fermi Hubbard models
Authors: Eduardo Ibarra-García-Padilla, Hannah Lange, Roger G Melko, Richard T Scalettar, Juan Carrasquilla, Annabelle Bohrdt, Ehsan Khatami
Abstract: Neural quantum states (NQS) have emerged as a powerful ansatz for variational quantum Monte Carlo studies of strongly-correlated systems. Here, we apply recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and autoregressive transformer neural networks to the Fermi-Hubbard and the (non-Hermitian) Hatano-Nelson-Hubbard models in one and two dimensions. In both cases, we observe that the convergence of the RNN ansatz is challenged when increasing the interaction strength. We present a physically-motivated and easy-to-implement strategy for improving the optimization, namely, by ramping of the model parameters. Furthermore, we investigate the advantages and disadvantages of the autoregressive sampling property of both network architectures. For the Hatano-Nelson-Hubbard model, we identify convergence issues that stem from the autoregressive sampling scheme in combination with the non-Hermitian nature of the model. Our findings provide insights into the challenges of the NQS approach and make the first step towards exploring strongly-correlated electrons using this ansatz.

Title: Persistent Homology for Structural Characterization in Disordered Systems
Authors: An Wang, Li Zou
Abstract: We propose a unified framework based on persistent homology (PH) to characterize both local and global structures in disordered systems. It can simultaneously generate local and global descriptors using the same algorithm and data structure, and has shown to be highly effective and interpretable in predicting particle rearrangements and classifying global phases. We also demonstrated that using a single variable enables a linear SVM to achieve nearly perfect three-phase classification. Inspired by this discovery, we define a non-parametric metric, the Separation Index (SI), which not only achieves this classification without sacrificing significant performance but also establishes a connection between particle environments and the global phase structure. Our methods provide an effective framework for understanding and analyzing the properties of disordered materials, with broad potential applications in materials science and even wider studies of complex systems.

Title: Short-Range Order Based Ultra Fast Large-Scale Modeling of High-Entropy Alloys
Authors: Caimei Niu, Lifeng Liu
Abstract: High-Entropy Alloys (HEAs) exhibit complex atomic interactions, with short-range order (SRO) playing a critical role in determining their properties. Traditional methods, such as Monte Carlo generator of Special Quasirandom Structures within the Alloy Theoretic Automated Toolkit (ATAT-mcsqs), Super-cell Random Approximates (SCRAPs), and hybrid Monte Carlo-Molecular Dynamics (MC-MD) are often hindered by limited system sizes and high computational costs. In response, we introduce PyHEA, a Python-based toolkit with a high-performance C++ core that leverages global and local search algorithms, incremental SRO computations, and GPU acceleration for unprecedented efficiency. When constructing random HEAs, PyHEA achieves speedups exceeding 133,000x and 13,900x over ATAT-mcsqs and SCRAPs, respectively, while maintaining high accuracy. PyHEA also offers a flexible workflow that allows users to incorporate target SRO values from external simulations (e.g., LAMMPS or density functional theory (DFT)), thereby enabling more realistic and customizable HEA models. As a proof of concept, PyHEA successfully replicated literature results for a 256,000-atom Fe-Cr-Co system within minutes-an order-of-magnitude improvement over hybrid MC-MD approaches. This dramatic acceleration opens new possibilities for bridging theoretical insights and practical applications, paving the way for the efficient design of next-generation HEAs.

Title: Electronic Structure, mass fluctuation, and Localized Bond Properties of two-dimensional double-layer transition metal chalcogenide MX$_2$ (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se, Te) Calculated Based on Density Functional Theory and BBC model
Authors: Yaorui Tan, Maolin Bo
Abstract: This study systematically investigates the electronic structure and bonding properties of two-dimensional bilayer transition metal chalcogenides MX$_2$ (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se, Te) using density functional theory calculations. Through the analysis of band gaps, deformation bond energies, and non-Hermitian bonding characteristics of various MX$_2$ compounds, the electronic properties and chemical bonding features are comprehensively examined. The findings demonstrate that charge transfer plays a critical role in electron mass fluctuation, with the incorporation of topological geometric analysis confirming the influence of mass changes on atomic bonding and electronic states. Furthermore, Heterojunctions between distinct atomic layers are shown to effectively modulate the band gap of two-dimensional bilayer transition metal chalcogenides. This work establishes a theoretical foundation for advancing the application of these materials.

Title: Study the quantum resolution sizes and atomic bonding states of two-dimensional tin monoxide
Authors: Yu Wang, Yunhu Zhu, Yixin Li, Maolin Bo
Abstract: Understanding the interatomic bonding and electronic properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials is crucial for preparing high-performance 2D semiconductor materials. We have calculated the band structure, electronic properties, and bonding characteristics of SnO in 2D materials by using density functional theory (DFT) and combining bond energy and bond charge models. Atomic bonding analysis enables us to deeply and meticulously analyze the interatomic bonding and charge transfer in the layered structure of SnO. This study greatly enhances our understanding of the local bonding state on the surface of 2D structural materials. In addition, we use the renormalization method to operate energy to determine the wave function at different quantum resolutions. This is of great significance for describing the size and phase transition of nanomaterials.

Title: Bond-Network Entropy Governs Heat Transport in Coordination-Disordered Solids
Authors: Kamil Iwanowski, Gábor Csányi, Michele Simoncelli
Abstract: Understanding how the vibrational and thermal properties of solids are influenced by atomistic structural disorder is of fundamental scientific interest, and paramount to designing materials for next-generation energy technologies. While several studies indicate that structural disorder strongly influences the thermal conductivity, the fundamental physics governing the disorder-conductivity relation remains elusive. Here we show that order-of-magnitude, disorder-induced variations of conductivity in network solids can be predicted from a bond-network entropy, an atomistic structural descriptor that quantifies heterogeneity in the topology of the atomic-bond network. We employ the Wigner formulation of thermal transport to demonstrate the existence of a relation between the bond-network entropy, and observables such as smoothness of the vibrational density of states (VDOS) and macroscopic conductivity. We also show that the smoothing of the VDOS encodes information about the thermal resistance induced by disorder, and can be directly related to phenomenological models for phonon-disorder scattering based on the semiclassical Peierls-Boltzmann equation. Our findings rationalize the conductivity variations of disordered carbon polymorphs ranging from nanoporous electrodes to defective graphite used as a moderator in nuclear reactors.

Title: Impact of Josephson junction array modes on fluxonium readout
Authors: Shraddha Singh, Gil Refael, Aashish Clerk, Emma Rosenfeld
Abstract: Dispersive readout of superconducting qubits is often limited by readout-drive-induced transitions between qubit levels. While there is a growing understanding of such effects in transmon qubits, the case of highly nonlinear fluxonium qubits is more complex. We theoretically analyze measurement-induced state transitions (MIST) during the dispersive readout of a fluxonium qubit. We focus on a new mechanism: a simultaneous transition/excitation involving the qubit and an internal mode of the Josephson junction array in the fluxonium circuit. Using an adiabatic Floquet approach, we show that these new kinds of MIST processes can be relevant when using realistic circuit parameters and relatively low readout drive powers. They also contribute to excess qubit dephasing even after a measurement is complete. In addition to outlining basic mechanisms, we also investigate the dependence of such transitions on the circuit parameters. We find that with a judicious choice of frequency allocations or coupling strengths, these parasitic processes can most likely be avoided.

Title: Non-reciprocal neutral ferroelectric domain walls in BiFeO3
Authors: M. A. P. Goncalves, M. Graf, M. Pasciak, J. Hlinka
Abstract: This paper analyzes a peculiar phenomenon of non-reciprocal domain wall pairs and illustrate the implications in ab-initio-based atomistic computational experiments with (112)-oriented planar R180 domain walls within the canonical multiferroic ferroelectric crystal of BiFeO3. Results show that parallel walls on the opposite sides of a given domain within a simply twinned lamellar domain structure can have considerably different polarization and oxygen octahedra tilt profiles, different thickness and energy densities. The spontaneous formation of zigzag walls and triangular domains suggests that these domain walls are actually the lowest energy planar R180 walls in pure insulating BiFeO3 crystals and films.

Title: High-temperature field-free superconducting diode effect in high-Tc cuprates
Authors: Shichao Qi, Jun Ge, Chengcheng Ji, Yiwen Ai, Gaoxing Ma, Ziqiao Wang, Zihan Cui, Yi Liu, Ziqiang Wang, Jian Wang
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect (SDE) is defined by the difference in the magnitude of critical currents applied in opposite directions. It has been observed in various superconducting systems and attracted high research interests. However, the operating temperature of the SDE is typically low and/or the sample structure is rather complex. For the potential applications in non-dissipative electronics, efficient superconducting diodes working in zero magnetic field with high operating temperatures and a simple configuration are highly desired. Here, we report the observation of a SDE under zero magnetic field with operating temperatures up to 72 K and efficiency as high as 22% at 53 K in high-transition-temperature (high-Tc) cuprate superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+{\delta} (BSCCO) flake devices. The rectification effect persists beyond two hundred sweeping cycles, confirming the stability of the superconducting diode. Our results offer promising developments for potential applications in non-dissipative electronics, and provide insights into the mechanism of field-free SDE and symmetry breakings in high-Tc superconductors.

Title: Time-reversal symmetry breaking fractional quantum spin Hall insulator in moir\'e MoTe2
Authors: Kaifei Kang, Yichen Qiu, Bowen Shen, Kihong Lee, Zhengchao Xia, Yihang Zeng, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Jie Shan, Kin Fai Mak
Abstract: Twisted bilayer transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductors, which support flat Chern bands with enhanced interaction effects, realize a platform for fractional Chern insulators and fractional quantum spin Hall (FQSH) insulators. A recent experiment has reported the emergence of a FQSH insulator protected by spin-Sz conservation at a moiré lattice filling factor {\nu}=3 in 2.1-degree twisted bilayer MoTe2. Theoretical studies have proposed both time-reversal symmetric and asymmetric ground states as possible candidates for the observed FQSH insulator, but the nature of the state remains unexplored. Here we report the observation of spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking at generic fillings in 2.1-degree twisted bilayer MoTe2 from {\nu}<1 all the way to {\nu}>6 except at {\nu}=2, 4, and 6. Although zero Hall response is observed at {\nu}=3 for magnetic fields higher than 20 mT, a finite anomalous Hall response accompanied by a magnetic hysteresis is observed at lower magnetic fields, demonstrating spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking. Our work shows the tendency towards ferromagnetism by doping the first three pairs of conjugate Chern bands in the material; it also sheds light on the nature of the FQSH insulator at {\nu}=3.

Title: BaTiO$_3$ -- SrTiO$_3$ composites: a microscopic study on paraelectric cubic inclusions
Authors: Sheng-Han Teng, Chinwendu Anabaryone, Anna Grünebohm
Abstract: Composites of ferroelectric and paraelectric perovskites have attracted a lot of attention due to their application potential in energy storage as well as novel computing and memory devices. So far the main focus of research has been on superlattices and ferroelectric particles in a paraelectric matrix, while the impact of paraelectric inclusions on the ferroelectric matrix is surprisingly underrepresented. To close this gap in knowledge we perform molecular dynamics simulations using an $ab\ initio$ derived effective Hamiltonian for BaTiO$_3$--SrTiO$_3$ and reveal the dependency of phase stability and phase transitions on the size and distances of paraelectric inclusions. We discuss how the combination of compressive strain and depolarization fields at the SrTiO$_3$ interfaces induces large local polarization, complex domain structures and coexisting phases as well as diffuse phase transitions and reduced coercive fields.

Title: Influence of density-dependent diffusion on pattern formation in a bounded habitat
Authors: G. G. Piva, C. Anteneodo
Abstract: Considering a nonlocal version of the Fisher-KPP equation, we explore the impact of heterogeneous diffusion on pattern formation within a bounded region (refuge). Under homogeneous diffusion, it is established that, nonlocality can lead to spontaneous pattern formation under certain parameter conditions, otherwise, when the homogeneous state is stable, spatial perturbations such as the existence of a refuge (high quality region within a hostile environment) can induce patterns. To understand how density-dependent diffusivity influences these forms of pattern formation, we examine diffusivity reactions to both rarefaction or overcrowding. Additionally, for comparison, we investigate the scenario where diffusivity levels vary spatially, inside and outside the refuge. We find that state-dependent diffusivity affects the shape and stability of patterns, potentially triggering either explosive growth or fragmentation of the population distribution, depending on how diffusion responses to density changes.

Title: Inherent quantum resources in stationary spin chains
Authors: Marcin Płodzień, Jan Chwedeńczuk, Maciej Lewenstein
Abstract: The standard way to generate many-body quantum correlations is via a dynamical protocol: an initial product state is transformed by interactions that generate non-classical correlations at later times. Here, we show that many-body Bell correlations are inherently present in the eigenstates of a variety of spin-1/2 chains. In particular, we show that the eigenstates and thermal states of the collective Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model possess many-body Bell correlations. We demonstrate that the Bell correlations can take on quantized values that change discontinuously with variations in the total magnetization. Finally, we show that these many-body Bell correlations persist even in the presence of both diagonal and off-diagonal disorder.

Title: Interferometry of quantum correlation functions to access quasiprobability distribution of work
Authors: Santiago Hernández-Gómez, Takuya Isogawa, Alessio Belenchia, Amikam Levy, Nicole Fabbri, Stefano Gherardini, Paola Cappellaro
Abstract: The Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability distribution, intimately connected with the quantum correlation function of two observables measured at distinct times, is becoming increasingly relevant for fundamental physics and quantum technologies. This quasiprobability distribution can take non-positive values, and its experimental reconstruction becomes challenging when expectation values of incompatible observables are involved. Here, we use an interferometric scheme aided by an auxiliary system to reconstruct the Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability distribution. We experimentally demonstrate this scheme in an electron-nuclear spin system associated with a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond. By measuring the characteristic function, we reconstruct the quasiprobability distribution of work and analyze the behavior of its first and second moments. Our results clarify the physical meaning of the work quasiprobability distribution in the context of quantum thermodynamics. Finally, we study the uncertainty of measuring the Hamiltonian of the system at two times, via the Robertson-Schr{ö}dinger uncertainty relation, for different initial states.

Title: Measurement-Induced Spectral Transition
Authors: Ken Mochizuki, Ryusuke Hamazaki
Abstract: We show that noisy quantum dynamics exposed to weak measurements exhibit a spectral transition between gapless and gapped phases. To this end, we employ the Lyapunov spectrum obtained through singular values of a non-unitary matrix describing the dynamics. We discover that the gapless and gapped phases respectively correspond to the volume-law and area-law phases of the entanglement entropy for the dominant Lyapunov vector. This correspondence between the spectral gap and the scaling of entanglement offers an intriguing analogy with ground-state phase transitions. We also discuss some crucial differences from ground-state transitions, such as the scaling law of the entanglement and the exponentially small gaps. Furthermore, we show that the spectral transition leads to the transition of the timescale for the memory loss of initial states.

Title: Complexity of two-level systems
Authors: Imre Varga
Abstract: Complexity of two-level systems, e.g. spins, qubits, magnetic moments etc, are analysed based on the so-called correlational entropy in the case of pure quantum systems and the thermal entropy in case of thermal equilibrium that are suitable quantities essentially free from basis dependence. The complexity is defined as the difference between the Shannon-entropy and the second order Rényi-entropy, where the latter is connected to the traditional participation measure or purity. It is shown that the system attains maximal complexity for special choice of control parameters, i.e. strength of disorder either in the presence of noise of the energy states or the presence of disorder in the off diagonal coupling. It is shown that such a noise or disorder dependence provides a basis free analysis and gives meaningful insights. We also look at similar entropic complexity of spins in thermal equilibrium for a paramagnet at finite temperature, $T$ and magnetic field $B$, as well as the case of an Ising model in the mean-field approximation. As a result all examples provide important evidence that the investigation of the entropic complexity parameters help to get deeper understanding in the behavior of these systems.

Title: Thermal Stoner-Wohlfarth Model for Magnetodynamics of Single Domain Nanoparticles: Implementation and Validation
Authors: Deniz Mostarac, Andrey A. Kuznetsov, Santiago Helbig, Claas Abert, Pedro A. Sanchez, Dieter Suess, Sofia S. Kantorovich
Abstract: We present the thermal Stoner-Wohlfarth (tSW) model and apply it in the context of Molecular Dynamics simulations. The model is validated against an ensemble of immobilized, randomly oriented uniaxial particles (solid superparamagnet) and a classical dilute ferrofluid for different combinations of anisotropy strength and magnetic field/moment coupling, at a fixed temperature. We compare analytical and simulation results to quantify the viability of the tSW model in reproducing the equilibrium (with and without dipole-dipole interactions) and dynamic (without dipole-dipole interactions) properties of magnetic soft matter systems. We show that if the anisotropy of a particle is more than five times higher than the thermal fluctuations, tSW is applicable and efficient. This approach allows one to consider the interplay between Néel and Brownian relaxation, often neglected in the fixed point-dipole representation-based magnetic soft matter theoretical investigations.

Title: Unveiling the nature of cathodoluminescence from photon statistics
Authors: Sotatsu Yanagimoto, Naoki Yamamoto, Tatsuro Yuge, Takumi Sannomiya, Keiichirou Akiba
Abstract: Cathodoluminescence (CL), the emission of light induced by accelerated free electrons, has been extensively utilized in various applications, such as displays, streak cameras, and high-spatial-resolution analysis of optical material, surpassing the diffraction limit of light. Despite its long history, the photon statistics of CL have only recently been examined, revealing unexpectedly large bunching of photons. Here we find that this peculiar photon bunching contains information of intervening excitation processes before the photon emission, which can be extracted from the photon statistics within each excitation event by a single free electron. Using this approach, we experimentally unveiled the statistical differences of coherent CL involving a single electromagnetic interaction process and incoherent CL involving multiple excitation processes. The developed formulation is universally applicable for particle generation processes in general to investigate the nature of cascade reactions.

Title: Topology of black hole phase transition in JT gravity
Authors: Hemant Rathi, Dibakar Roychowdhury
Abstract: We present a JT gravity setup coupled with $U(1)$ and $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills fields in two dimensions that reveals the onset of a small black hole to large black hole phase transition at finite chemical potential(s). We identify these black hole solutions as topological defects in the thermodynamic phase space and calculate the associated topological numbers following the standard procedure. We confirm the robustness of our model by estimating perturbative corrections to the bulk free energy at an arbitrary order in the Yang-Mills coupling. We also construct the Schwarzian for the boundary theory using the 2D gravitational action in the bulk and comment on the dual SYK like model where similar observations can be made.

Title: Circuit Quantisation from First Principles
Authors: Yun-Chih Liao, Ben J. Powell, Thomas M. Stace
Abstract: Superconducting circuit quantisation conventionally starts from classical Euler-Lagrange circuit equations-of-motion. Invoking the correspondence principle yields a canonically quantised circuit description of circuit dynamics over a bosonic Hilbert space. This process has been very successful for describing experiments, but implicitly starts from the classical Ginsberg-Landau (GL) mean field theory for the circuit. Here we employ a different approach which starts from a microscopic fermionic Hamiltonian for interacting electrons, whose ground space is described by the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) many-body wavefuction that underpins conventional superconductivity. We introduce the BCS ground-space as a subspace of the full fermionic Hilbert space, and show that projecting the electronic Hamiltonian onto this subspace yields the standard Hamiltonian terms for Josephson junctions, capacitors and inductors, from which standard quantised circuit models follow. Importantly, this approach does not assume a spontaneously broken symmetry, which is important for quantised circuits that support superpositions of phases, and the phase-charge canonical commutation relations are derived from the underlying fermionic commutation properties, rather than imposed. By expanding the projective subspace, this approach can be extended to describe phenomena outside the BCS ground space, including quasiparticle excitations.

Title: Modern Approach to 2D Conformal Field Theory
Authors: Yuya Kusuki
Abstract: The primary aim of these lecture notes is to introduce the modern approach to two-dimensional conformal field theory (2D CFT). The study of analytical methods in two-dimensional conformal field theory has developed over several decades, starting with BPZ. The development of analytical methods, particularly in rational conformal field theory (RCFT), has been remarkable, with complete classifications achieved for certain model groups. One motivation for studying CFT comes from its ability to describe quantum critical systems. Given that realistic quantum critical systems are fundamentally RCFTs, it is somewhat natural that the analytical methods of RCFT have evolved significantly. CFTs other than RCFTs are called irrational conformal field theories (ICFTs). Compared to RCFTs, the study of ICFTs has not progressed as much. Leaving aside whether there is physical motivation or not, ICFTs inherently possess a difficulty that makes them challenging to approach. However, with the development of quantum gravity, the advancement of analytical methods for ICFTs has become essential. The reason lies in the AdS/CFT correspondence. AdS/CFT refers to the relationship between $d+1$ dimensional quantum gravity and $d$ dimensional CFT. Within this correspondence, the CFT appears as a non-perturbative formulation of quantum gravity. Except in special cases, this CFT belongs to ICFT. Against this backdrop, the methods for ICFTs have developed rapidly in recent years. Many of these ICFT methods are indispensable for modern quantum gravity research. Unfortunately, these cannot be learned from textbooks on 2D CFTs, such as Yellow book. These lecture notes aim to fill this gap. Specifically, we will cover techniques that have already been applied in many studies, such as HHLL block and monodromy method, and significant results that have become proper nouns, such as Hellerman bound and HKS bound.

Title: Broadband electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy of $^{167}$Er:$^{7}$LiYF$_4$ at mK temperatures
Authors: Ana Strinic, Patricia Oehrl, Achim Marx, Pavel A. Bushev, Hans Huebl, Rudolf Gross, Nadezhda Kukharchyk
Abstract: Rare-earth spin ensembles are a promising platform for microwave quantum memory applications due to their hyperfine transitions, which can exhibit exceptionally long coherence times when using an operation point with zero first-order Zeeman (ZEFOZ) shift. In this work, we use broadband electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy on $^{167}$Er:$^{7}$LiYF$_4$ single crystals at sub-Kelvin temperatures. By fitting the spin Hamiltonian to the zero-field spectrum, we obtain refined parameters of the magnetic field-independent interactions, such as the hyperfine and quadrupole interaction. We also study the influence of the quadrupole interaction on the hyperfine splitting in the zero and low magnetic field range by analyzing EPR-spectra between 0 mT and 50 mT. Our findings highlight the broadband EPR spectroscopy approach as a powerful tool for the precise determination of the spin Hamiltonian parameters and for the characterization of hyperfine transitions in terms of their selection rules and linewidth.
