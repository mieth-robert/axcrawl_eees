Title: Giant orbital Hall effect due to the bulk states of 3D topological insulators
Authors: James H. Cullen, Hong Liu, Dimitrie Culcer
Abstract: The highly efficient torques generated by 3D topological insulators make them a favourable platform for faster and more efficient magnetic memory devices. Recently, research into harnessing orbital angular momentum in orbital torques has received significant attention. Here we study the orbital Hall effect in topological insulators. We find that the bulk states give rise to a sizeable orbital Hall effect that is up to 3 orders of magnitude larger than the spin Hall effect in topological insulators. This is partially because the orbital angular momentum that each conduction electron carries is up to an order of magnitude larger than the $\hbar/2$ carried by its spin. Our results imply that the large torques measured in topological insulator/ferromagnet devices can be further enhanced through careful engineering of the heterostructure to optimise orbital-to-spin conversion.

Title: Chiral cavity control of superconducting diode-like nonlinearities
Authors: Arpit Arora, Prineha Narang
Abstract: Time reversal symmetry breaking is an important piece in controlling nonreciprocal responses which are crucial in advancing the utility of quantum materials in device operations. Here, we propose cavity control of superconducting diode-like nonreciprocities where time reversal breaking is achieved via chirality of the cavity modes. With twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) as an example, we demonstrate the general principles of cavity control of band dispersion and geometry using chiral microwave photons which are valid for modes in a split-ring resonator or for modes emulated on a qubit lattice. In particular, we show that time reversal breaking by chiral modes enables superconducting diode-like nonlinearities in TBG by valley polarized states and their skewed quantum geometry. Strikingly, we find sizeable nonreciprocities at par with those obtained in magnetic field trained TBG Jospephson junction devices. The cavity control of superconducting nonreciprocities offers non-invasive means of exploring new functionalities in quantum circuits with in-situ implementation. This can serve as an important contribution to the toolbox for nonreciprocal models in circuit quantum electrodynamics to be harnessed for quantum computing and sensing.

Title: Athermal creep deformation of ultrastable amorphous solids
Authors: Pinaki Chaudhuri, Ludovic Berthier, Misaki Ozawa
Abstract: We numerically investigate the athermal creep deformation of amorphous materials having a wide range of stability. The imposed shear stress serves as the control parameter, allowing us to examine the time-dependent transient response through both the macroscopic strain and microscopic observables. Least stable samples exhibit monotonicity in the transient strain rate versus time, while more stable samples display a pronounced non-monotonic S-shaped curve, corresponding to failure by sharp shear band formation. We identify a diverging timescale associated with the fluidization process and extract the corresponding critical exponents. Our results are compared with predictions from existing scaling theories relevant to soft matter systems. The numerical findings for stable, brittle-like materials represent a challenge for theoretical descriptions. We monitor the microscopic initiation of shear bands during creep responses. Our study encompasses creep deformation across a variety of materials ranging from ductile soft matter to brittle metallic and oxide glasses, all within the same numerical framework.

Title: Mode-resolved transmission functions: an individual Caroli formula
Authors: Hocine Boumrar, Hand Zenia, Mahdi Hamidi
Abstract: Efficient manipulation of energy at the nanoscale is crucial for advancements in modern computing, energy harvesting, and thermal management. Specifically, controlling quasiparticle currents is critical to these ongoing technological revolutions. This work introduces a novel and physically consistent approach for computing polarization-resolved transmission functions, a crucial element in understanding and controlling energy transport across interfaces. We show that this new method, unlike several previously derived formulations, consistently yields physically meaningful results by addressing the origin of unphysical behavior in other methods. We demonstrate that while multiple decompositions of the transmission function are possible, only there is a unique and unambiguous route to obtaining physically meaningful results. We highlight and critique the arbitrary nature of these alternative decompositions and their associated failures. While developed within the framework of phonon transport, the individual Caroli formula is general and applicable to other fermionic and bosonic quasiparticles, including electrons, and to internal degrees of freedom such as spin and orbital polarization. Through a comparative analysis using a simple model system, we validate the accuracy and reliability of the individual Caroli formula in capturing polarization-specific transmission properties. This new method provides a more accurate understanding of both phonon and electron transport, offering novel ways for optimization of thermoelectric devices and energy-efficient computing technologies.

Title: Monolithic 4H-SiC nanomechanical resonators with high intrinsic quality factors
Authors: A. Hochreiter, P. Bredol, F. David, B. Demiralp, H. B. Weber, E. M. Weig
Abstract: We present an extensive study of 4H-SiC nanomechanical resonators electrochemically etched out of a monocrystalline wafer. Combining piezo-driven interferometric determination of the mechanical spectra with scanning-laser-Doppler vibrometry, an unambiguous assignment of resonance peaks to flexural and torsional modes is achieved. The investigation of multiple harmonic eigenmodes of singly and doubly clamped resonators with varying geometry allows for a comprehensive characterization. Excellent intrinsic mechanical quality factors up to $2\times10^5$ are found at room temperature, approaching the thermoelastic limit at eigenfrquencies exceeding 10 MHz. Mechanical stress is essentially absent. Young's modulus in agreement with literature. These findings are robust under post-processing treatments, in particular atomic layer etching and high-temperature thermal annealing. The resulting on-chip high-quality mechanical resonators represent a valuable technological element for a broad range of applications. In particular, the monolithic architecture meets the requirements of spin-based photonic quantum technologies on the upcoming SiC platform.

Title: Simulating Curved Lipid Membranes Using Anchored Frozen Patches
Authors: James Tallman, Antonia Statt
Abstract: Lipid bilayers often form high-curvature configurations due to self-assembly conditions or certain biological processes. However, particle-based simulations of lipid membranes are predominantly of flat lipid membranes because planar membranes are easily connected over periodic boundary conditions. To simulate a curved lipid membrane, one can simulate an entire vesicle, a cylinder, or a bicelle (disk-like bilayer aggregate). One can also use artificial methods to control curvature, such as applying virtual walls of beads, radial harmonic potentials, or ``tape up the edges''. These existing methods have limitations due to the method by which curvature is imposed. Herein, we propose an alternative method of introducing arbitrary curvature by anchoring a curved lipid membrane with ``frozen'' equilibrated membrane patches. The method presented here is compatible with all particle-based lipid models and easily extended to many geometries. As an example, we simulate curved membranes with DPPC, DOPC, DLPC and DOPE lipids as parameterized by the Martini3 coarse-grained model. This method introduces limited finite-size artifacts, prevents lipid flip-flop at membrane edges, and allows fluctuations of the free membrane center. We provide verification of the method on flat membranes and discussion on extracting shape and per-leaflet quantities (thickness, order parameter) from curved membranes. Curvature produces asymmetric changes in lipid leaflet properties. Finally, we explore the coupled effect of curvature and membrane asymmetry in both number and lipid type. We report the resulting unique morphologies (inducing gel phase, faceting) and behaviors (thickness dependent on adjacent leaflet type) that are accessible with this method.

Title: Bridging statistical mechanics and thermodynamics away from equilibrium: a data-driven approach for learning internal variables and their dynamics
Authors: Weilun Qiu, Shenglin Huang, Celia Reina
Abstract: Thermodynamics with internal variables is a common approach in continuum mechanics to model inelastic (i.e., non-equilibrium) material behavior. While this approach is computationally and theoretically attractive, it currently lacks a well-established statistical mechanics foundation. As a result, internal variables are typically chosen phenomenologically and lack a direct link to the underlying physics which hinders the predictability of the theory. To address these challenges, we propose a machine learning approach that is consistent with the principles of statistical mechanics and thermodynamics. The proposed approach leverages the following techniques (i) the information bottleneck (IB) method to ensure that the learned internal variables are functions of the microstates and are capable of capturing the salient feature of the microscopic distribution; (ii) conditional normalizing flows to represent arbitrary probability distributions of the microscopic states as functions of the state variables; and (iii) Variational Onsager Neural Networks (VONNs) to guarantee thermodynamic consistency and Markovianity of the learned evolution equations. The resulting framework, called IB-VONNs, is tested on two problems of colloidal systems, governed at the microscale by overdamped Langevin dynamics. The first one is a prototypical model for a colloidal particle in an optical trap, which can be solved analytically, and thus ideal to verify the framework. The second problem is a one-dimensional phase-transforming system, whose macroscopic description still lacks a statistical mechanics foundation under general conditions. The results in both cases indicate that the proposed machine learning strategy can indeed bridge statistical mechanics and thermodynamics with internal variables away from equilibrium.

Title: Soliquidy: a descriptor for atomic geometrical confusion
Authors: Hagen Eckert, Sebastian A. Kube, Simon Divilov, Asa Guest, Adam C. Zettel, David Hicks, Sean D. Griesemer, Nico Hotz, Xiomara Campilongo, Siya Zhu, Axel van de Walle, Jan Schroers, Stefano Curtarolo
Abstract: Tailoring material properties often requires understanding the solidification process. Herein, we introduce the geometric descriptor Soliquidy, which numerically captures the Euclidean transport cost between the translationally disordered versus ordered states of a materials. As a testbed, we apply Soliquidy to the classification of glass-forming metal alloys. By extending and combining an experimental library of metallic thin-films (glass/no-glass) with the this http URL computational database (geometrical and energetic information of mixtures) we found that the combination of Soliquity and formation enthalpies generates an effective classifier for glass formation. Such classifier is then used to tackle a public dataset of metallic glasses showing that the glass-agnostic assumptions of Soliquity can be useful for understanding kinetically-controlled phase transitions.

Title: Few-Mode and Anisotropic Quantum Transport in InSb Nanoribbons Using an All-van der Waals Material-Based Gate
Authors: Colin J. Riggert, Pim Lueb, Tyler Littmann, Ghada Badawy, Marco Rossi, Paul A. Crowell, Erik P.A.M. Bakkers, Vlad S. Pribiag
Abstract: High-quality electrostatic gating is a fundamental ingredient for successful semiconducting device physics, and a key element of realizing clean quantum transport. Inspired by the widespread improvement of transport quality when two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) materials are gated exclusively by other vdW materials, we have developed a method for gating non-vdW materials with an all-vdW gate stack, consisting of a hexagonal boron nitride dielectric layer and a few-layer graphite gate electrode. We demonstrate this gating approach on MOVPE-grown InSb nanoribbons (NRs), a novel variant of the InSb nanowire, with a flattened cross-section. In our all-vdW gated NR devices we observe conductance features that are reproducible and have low- to near-zero gate hysteresis. We also report quantized conductance, which persists to lower magnetic fields and longer channel lengths than typical InSb nanowire devices reported to date. Additionally, we observe level splitting that is highly anisotropic in an applied magnetic field, which we attribute to the ribbon cross-section. The performance of our devices is consistent with the reduced disorder expected from the all-vdW gating scheme, and marks the first report of ballistic, few-modes quantum transport in a non-vdW material with an all-vdW gate. Our results establish all-vdW gating as a promising approach for high-quality gating of non-vdW materials for quantum transport, which is in principle applicable generically, beyond InSb systems. In addition, the work showcases the specific potential of all-vdW gate/InSb NR devices for enabling clean quantum devices that may be relevant for spintronics and topological superconductivity studies.

Title: Learning Metal Microstructural Heterogeneity through Spatial Mapping of Diffraction Latent Space Features
Authors: Mathieu Calvat, Chris Bean, Dhruv Anjaria, Hyoungryul Park, Haoren Wang, Kenneth Vecchio, J.C. Stinville
Abstract: To leverage advancements in machine learning for metallic materials design and property prediction, it is crucial to develop a data-reduced representation of metal microstructures that surpasses the limitations of current physics-based discrete microstructure descriptors. This need is particularly relevant for metallic materials processed through additive manufacturing, which exhibit complex hierarchical microstructures that cannot be adequately described using the conventional metrics typically applied to wrought materials. Furthermore, capturing the spatial heterogeneity of microstructures at the different scales is necessary within such framework to accurately predict their properties. To address these challenges, we propose the physical spatial mapping of metal diffraction latent space features. This approach integrates (i) point diffraction data encoding via variational autoencoders or contrastive learning and (ii) the physical mapping of the encoded values. Together these steps offer a method offers a novel means to comprehensively describe metal microstructures. We demonstrate this approach on a wrought and additively manufactured alloy, showing that it effectively encodes microstructural information and enables direct identification of microstructural heterogeneity not directly possible by physics-based models. This data-reduced microstructure representation opens the application of machine learning models in accelerating metallic material design and accurately predicting their properties.

Title: Local Basis Transformation to Mitigate Negative Sign Problems
Authors: Keisuke Murota, Synge Todo
Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods for the frustrated quantum spin systems occasionally suffer from the negative sign problem, which makes simulations exponentially harder for larger systems at lower temperatures and severely limits QMC's application across a wide range of spin systems. This problem is known to depend on the choice of representation basis. We propose a systematic approach for mitigating the sign problem independent of the given Hamiltonian or lattice structure. We first introduce the concept of negativity to characterize the severity of the negative sign problem. We then demonstrate the existence of a locally defined quantity, the L1 adaptive loss function, which effectively approximates negativity, especially in frustration-free systems. Using the proposed loss function, we demonstrate that optimizing the representation basis can mitigate the negative sign. This is evidenced by several frustration-free models and other important quantum spin systems. Furthermore, we compare the effectiveness of unitary transformations against the standard orthogonal transformation and reveal that unitary transformations can effectively mitigate the sign problem in certain cases.

Title: Polarization-Resolved Core Exciton Dynamics in LiF Using Attosecond Transient Absorption Spectroscopy
Authors: Kylie J Gannan, Lauren B Drescher, Rafael Quintero-Bermudez, Navdeep Rana, Chengye Huang, Kenneth Schafer, Mette B Gaarde, Stephen R Leone
Abstract: The ability to control absorption by modifying the polarization of light presents an exciting opportunity to experimentally determine the orbital alignment of absorption features. Here, attosecond extreme ultraviolet (XUV) transient absorption spectroscopy is used to investigate the polarization dependence of core exciton dynamics in LiF thin films at the Li+ K edge. XUV pulses excite electrons from the Li 1s core level into the conduction band, allowing for the formation of a p-orbital-like core exciton, aligned along the XUV light polarization axis. A sub-5 fs near-infrared (NIR) probe pulse then arrives at variable time delays, perturbing the XUV-excited states and allowing the coherence decay of the core exciton to be mapped. The coherence lifetimes are found to be ~2.4 +- 0.4 fs, which is attributed to a phonon-mediated dephasing mechanism as in previous core exciton studies. The differential absorption features are also shown to be sensitive to the relative polarization of the XUV and NIR fields. The parallel NIR probe induces couplings between the initial XUV-excited p-like bright exciton and s-like dark excitons. When crossed pump and probe polarizations are used, the coupling between the bright and dark states is no longer dipole-allowed, and the transient absorption signal associated with the coupling is suppressed by approximately 90%. This interpretation is supported by simulations of a few-level model system, as well as analysis of the calculated band structure. The results indicate that laser polarization can serve as a powerful experimental tool for exploring the orbital alignment of core excitonic states in solid-state materials.

Title: A Phase Diagram for Crystallization of a Complex Macromolecular Assembly
Authors: Vivekananda Bal, Jacqueline M. Wolfrum, Paul W. Barone, Stacy L. Springs, Anthony J. Sinskey, Robert M. Kotin, Richard D. Braatz
Abstract: Crystallization of biological molecules has high potential to solve some challenges in drug manufacturing. Thus, understanding the process is critical to efficiently adapting crystallization to biopharmaceutical manufacturing. This article describes phase behavior for the solution crystallization of recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) capsids of serotypes 5, 8, and 9 as model biological macromolecular assemblies. Hanging-drop vapor diffusion experiments are used to determine the combined effects of pH and polyethylene glycol (PEG) and sodium chloride concentrations in which full and empty capsids nucleate and grow. Full and empty capsids show different crystallization behavior although they possess similar capsid structure and similar outer morphology with icosahedral symmetry and 2-fold, 3-fold, and 5-fold symmetry. The differential charge environment surrounding full and empty capsids is found to influence capsid crystallization. The crystal growth rate is found to be affected by the mass of the macromolecular assembly rather than the structure/shape of the macromolecular assembly. The regions of precipitant concentrations and pH in which crystallization occurs are found to be different for different rAAV serotypes and for full and empty capsids for each serotype. Depending on the precipitant concentrations and the rAAV serotype, a variety of complex crystal morphologies are formed and a variety of non-crystallization outcomes such as unidentified dense solid-phase/opaque crystals and an oil/dense phase is observed. The well-defined dense phase/oil is found to be converted into a solid phase over a long period of time. Trends in the crystallization of full and empty capsids between serotypes is observed to be altered by the extent of post-translational modifications (PTMS) associated with the massive macromolecular proteinaceous assembly.

Title: Dynamics with Simultaneous Dissipations to Fermionic and Bosonic Reservoirs
Authors: Elvis F. Arguelles, Osamu Sugino
Abstract: We introduce a non-phenomenological framework based on the influence functional method to incorporate simultaneous interactions of particles with fermionic and bosonic thermal reservoirs. In the slow-motion limit, the electronic friction kernel becomes Markovian, enabling an analytical expression for the friction coefficient. The framework is applied to a prototypical electrochemical system, where the metal electrode and solvent act as fermionic and bosonic reservoirs, respectively. We investigate quantum vibrational relaxation of hydrogen on metal surfaces, showing that dissipation to electron-hole pairs reduces the relaxation time. Additionally, in solvated proton discharge, electronic friction prolongs charge transfer by delaying proton transitions between potential wells. This study provides new insights into the interplay of solvent and electronic dissipation effects, with direct relevance to electrochemical processes and other systems involving multiple thermal reservoirs.

Title: A tomographic interpretation of structure-property relations for materials discovery
Authors: Raul Ortega-Ochoa, Alán Aspuru-Guzik, Tejs Vegge, Tonio Buonassisi
Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning (ML) for materials have demonstrated that "simple" materials representations (e.g., the chemical formula alone without structural information) can sometimes achieve competitive property prediction performance in common-tasks. Our physics-based intuition would suggest that such representations are "incomplete", which indicates a gap in our understanding. This work proposes a tomographic interpretation of structure-property relations of materials to bridge that gap by defining what is a material representation, material properties, the material and the relationships between these three concepts using ideas from information theory. We verify this framework performing an exhaustive comparison of property-augmented representations on a range of material's property prediction objectives, providing insight into how different properties can encode complementary information.

Title: Competition between excitonic insulators and quantum Hall states in correlated electron-hole bilayers
Authors: Ruishi Qi, Qize Li, Zuocheng Zhang, Zhiyuan Cui, Bo Zou, Haleem Kim, Collin Sanborn, Sudi Chen, Jingxu Xie, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Michael F. Crommie, Allan H. MacDonald, Feng Wang
Abstract: Excitonic insulators represent a unique quantum phase of matter, providing a rich ground for studying exotic quantum bosonic states. Strongly coupled electron-hole bilayers, which host stable dipolar exciton fluids with an exciton density that can be adjusted electrostatically, offer an ideal platform to investigate correlated excitonic insulators. Based on electron-hole bilayers made of MoSe2/hBN/WSe2 heterostructures, here we study the behavior of excitonic insulators in a perpendicular magnetic field. We report the observation of excitonic quantum oscillations in both Coulomb drag signals and electrical resistance at low to medium magnetic fields. Under a strong magnetic field, we identify multiple quantum phase transitions between the excitonic insulator phase and the bilayer quantum Hall insulator phase. These findings underscore the interplay between the electron-hole interactions and Landau level quantization that opens new possibilities for exploring quantum phenomena in composite bosonic insulators.

Title: Charge state tuning of spin defects in hexagonal boron nitride

Abstract: Boron vacancies in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are among the most extensively studied optically active spin defects in van der Waals crystals, due to their promising potential to develop two-dimensional (2D) quantum sensors. In this letter, we demonstrate the tunability of the charge state of boron vacancies in ultrathin hBN layers, revealing a transition from the optically active singly negatively charged state to the optically inactive doubly negatively charged state when sandwiched between graphene electrodes. Notably, there is a photoluminescence quenching of a few percent upon the application of a bias voltage between the electrodes. Our findings emphasize the critical importance of considering the charge state of optically active defects in 2D materials, while also showing that the negatively charged boron vacancy remains robust against external perpendicular electric fields. This stability makes it a promising candidate for integration into various van der Waals heterostructures.

Title: Exciton-polariton condensate in the van der Waals magnet CrSBr
Authors: Bo Han, Hangyong Shan, Kok Wee Song, Lukas Lackner, Martin Esmann, Vita Solovyeva, Falk Eilenberger, Jakub Regner, Zdeněk Sofer, Oleksandr Kyriienko, Christian Schneider
Abstract: Van der Waals magnets are an emergent material class of paramount interest for fundamental studies in coupling light with matter excitations, which are uniquely linked to their underlying magnetic properties. Among these materials, the magnetic semiconductor CrSBr is possibly a first playground where we can study simultaneously the interaction of photons, magnons, and excitons at the quantum level. Here we demonstrate a coherent macroscopic quantum phase, the bosonic condensation of exciton-polaritons, which emerges in a CrSBr flake embedded in a fully tunable cryogenic open optical cavity. The Bose condensate is characterized by a highly non-linear threshold-like behavior, and coherence manifests distinctly via its first and second order quantum coherence. We find that the condensate's non-linearity is highly susceptible to the magnetic order in CrSBr, and encounters a sign change depending on the antiferro- and ferromagnetic ordering. Our findings open a route towards magnetically controllable quantum fluids of light, and optomagnonic devices where spin magnetism is coupled to on-chip Bose-Einstein condensates.

Title: Unveiling Topological Hinge States in the Higher-Order Topological Insulator WTe$_2$ Based on the Fractional Josephson Effect
Authors: Yong-Bin Choi, Jinho Park, Woochan Jung, Sein Park, Mazhar N. Ali, Gil-Ho Lee
Abstract: Higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs) represent a novel class of topological materials, characterised by the emergence of topological boundary modes at dimensions two or more lower than those of bulk materials. Recent experimental studies have identified conducting channels at the hinges of HOTIs, although their topological nature remains unexplored. In this study, we investigated Shapiro steps in Al-WTe$_2$-Al proximity Josephson junctions (JJs) under microwave irradiation and examined the topological properties of the hinge states in WTe$_2$. Specifically, we analysed the microwave frequency dependence of the absence of the first Shapiro step in hinge-dominated JJs, attributing this phenomenon to the 4$\pi$-periodic current-phase relationship characteristic of topological JJs. These findings may encourage further research into topological superconductivity with topological hinge states in superconducting hybrid devices based on HOTIs. Such advances could lead to the realisation of Majorana zero modes for topological quantum physics and pave the way for applications in spintronic devices.

Title: Refining interface stress measurement in nanomultilayers through layer corrugation and interface roughness corrections
Authors: Yang Hu, Aleksandr Druzhinin, Claudia Cancellieri, Vladyslav Turlo
Abstract: We introduce new models that incorporate layer corrugation and interface roughness into standard approaches for measuring interface stress in nanomultilayers (NMLs). Applied to Cu/W NMLs, these models show that ignoring such features can inflate measured interface stress by up to 0.4 J/m^2. However, corrugation and roughness alone cannot account for the extreme stresses reported, suggesting that atomic-scale phenomena (e.g., intermixing and metastable phase formation at the interfaces) dominate. These findings highlight the importance of balancing bilayer counts and thickness-to-roughness ratios for reliable stress quantification, providing a practical pathway to designing and characterizing advanced nanocomposite coatings with improved accuracy.

Title: Interlayer phase coherence and composite fermions
Authors: Thierry Jolicoeur
Abstract: The fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) realized in two-dimensional electron systems is explained by the emergent composite fermions (CF) out of ordinary electrons. It is possible to write down explicit wavefunctions explaining many if not all FQHE states. In bilayer systems there is a regime at integer filling of the lowest Landau level that displays a spontaneous breakdown of the U(1) relative phase between the two layers. This can be seen as interlayer phase coherence (ILC) in terms of electrons. Recent experiments in double layer samples of graphene have revealed the appearance of many FQHE states unique to the bilayer case. We discuss extensions of the CF idea in this situation as well as the possible existence of ILC of CFs.

Title: Large frequency nonreciprocity of azimuthal spin wave modes in submicron vortex state disks
Authors: Sali Salama, Joo-Von Kim, Abdelmadjid Anane, Jean-Paul Adam
Abstract: Vortex states in thin film disks host spin wave modes that are geometrically quantized according to their radial and azimuthal indices. Previous studies have shown that hybridization between these modes and the vortex core results in a sizeable frequency nonreciprocity between low-order clockwise and counterclockwise propagating azimuthal modes. Here, we present a computational study of these spin wave modes in submicron disks in which the spatial extension of the vortex core becomes comparable to the wavelength of certain modes. In such cases, we find that the frequency nonreciprocity can be large even for higher order radial and azimuthal indices, reaching several GHz and comparable to the mode frequencies themselves.

Title: Curvature-sensing and generation of membrane proteins: a review
Authors: Hiroshi Noguchi
Abstract: Membrane proteins are crucial in regulating biomembrane shapes and controlling the dynamic changes in membrane morphology during essential cellular processes. These proteins can localize to regions with their preferred curvatures (curvature sensing) and induce localized membrane curvature. Thus, this review describes the recent theoretical development in membrane remodeling performed by membrane proteins. The mean-field theories of protein binding and the resulting membrane deformations are reviewed. The effects of hydrophobic insertions on the area-difference elasticity energy and that of intrinsically disordered protein domains on the membrane bending energy are discussed. For the crescent-shaped proteins, such as Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs superfamily proteins, anisotropic protein bending energy and orientation-dependent excluded volume significantly contribute to curvature sensing and generation. Moreover, simulation studies of membrane deformations caused by protein binding and colloidal particle adhesion are reviewed, including domain formation, budding, and tubulation.

Title: Ultra-large mutually synchronized networks of 10 nm spin Hall nano-oscillators
Authors: Nilamani Behera, Avinash Kumar Chaurasiya, Akash Kumar, Roman Khymyn, Artem Litvinenko, Lakhan Bainsla, Ahmad A. Awad, Johan Åkerman
Abstract: While mutually interacting spin Hall nano-oscillators (SHNOs) hold great promise for wireless communication, neural networks, neuromorphic computing, and Ising machines, the highest number of synchronized SHNOs remains limited to $N$ = 64. Using ultra-narrow 10 and 20-nm nano-constrictions in W-Ta/CoFeB/MgO trilayers, we demonstrate mutually synchronized SHNO networks of up to $N$ = 105,000. The microwave power and quality factor scale as $N$ with new record values of 9 nW and $1.04 \times 10^6$, respectively. An unexpectedly strong array size dependence of the frequency-current tunability is explained by magnon exchange between nano-constrictions and magnon losses at the array edges, further corroborated by micromagnetic simulations and Brillouin light scattering microscopy. Our results represent a significant step towards viable SHNO network applications in wireless communication and unconventional computing.

Title: Disentangling real space fluctuations: the diagnostics of metal-insulator transitions beyond single-particle spectral functions
Authors: Michael Meixner, Marcel Krämer, Nils Wentzell, Pietro M. Bonetti, Sabine Andergassen, Alessandro Toschi, Thomas Schäfer
Abstract: The destruction of metallicity due to the mutual Coulomb interaction of quasiparticles gives rise to fascinating phenomena of solid state physics such as the Mott metal-insulator transition and the pseudogap. A key observable characterizing their occurrences is the single-particle spectral function, determined by the fermionic self-energy. In this paper we investigate in detail how real space fluctuations are responsible for a self-energy that drives the Mott-Hubbard metal-insulator transition. To this aim we first introduce a real space fluctuation diagnostics approach to the Hedin equation, which connects the fermion-boson coupling vertex $\lambda$ to the self-energy $\Sigma$. Second, by using cellular dynamical mean-field theory calculations for $\lambda$ we identify the leading physical processes responsible for the destruction of metallicity across the transition.

Title: Active rheology of soft solids performed with acoustical tweezers
Authors: Antoine Penneron, Thomas Brunet, Diego Baresch
Abstract: Single-beam acoustical tweezers are used to manipulate individual microbubbles and provide quantitative measurements of the local shear modulus of soft hydrogels. The microbubbles are directly generated by electrolysis of the hydrogel and their displacement is detected using optical microscopy in the focal plane of a focused vortex beam. Microbubbles displaced off-axis can be pulled by a restoring radial force component that forms a stable two-dimensional trap. We also observe an off-axis tangential microbubble motion that is due to the transfer of the beam's angular momentum flux. A simple elastic model for the hydrogel deformation combined with radiation force calculations finally provide local values of the medium's shear modulus, which are found to be in good agreement with standard bulk measurements performed with a rheometer. Our results suggest that acoustical tweezers are relevant tools to characterize the local mechanical properties of complex soft materials opening new opportunities in the field of active rheology.

Title: Simulation of the crystallization kinetics of Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$ nanoconfined in superlattice geometries for phase change memories
Authors: Debdipto Acharya, Omar Abou El Kheir, Simone Marcorini, Marco Bernasconi
Abstract: Phase change materials are the most promising candidates for the realization of artificial synapsis for neuromorphic computing. Different resistance levels corresponding to analogic values of the synapsis conductance can be achieved by modulating the size of an amorphous region embedded in its crystalline matrix. Recently, it has been proposed that a superlattice made of alternating layers of the phase change compound Sb$_2$Te$_3$ and of the TiTe$_2$ confining material allows for a better control of multiple intermediate resistance states and for a lower drift with time of the electrical resistance of the amorphous phase. In this work, we consider to substitute Sb$_2$Te$_3$ with the Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$ prototypical phase change compound that should feature better data retention. By exploiting molecular dynamics simulations with a machine learning interatomic potential, we have investigated the crystallization kinetics of Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$ nanoconfined in geometries mimicking Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$/TiTe$_2$ superlattices. It turns out that nanoconfinement induces a slight reduction in the crystal growth velocities with respect to the bulk, but also an enhancement of the nucleation rate due to heterogeneous nucleation. The results support the idea of investigating Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$/TiTe$_2$ superlattices for applications in neuromorphic devices with improved data retention. The effect on the crystallization kinetics of the addition of van der Waals interaction to the interatomic potential is also discussed.

Abstract: In recent years, significant advancements in computational methods have dramatically enhanced the precision in determining the energetic ranking of different phases of molecular crystals. The developments mainly focused on providing accurate dispersion corrected exchange correlation functionals and methods for describing the vibrational entropy contributions to the free energy at finite temperatures. Several molecular crystals phases were recently found to have of multi-minima character. For our investigations we highlight the multi-minima character in the example of the molecular crystal consisting of N-(4-Methylbenzylidene)-4-methylalanine. We explore its potential energy landscape on the full DFT level or with a machine learned potential that was fitted to DFT data. We calculate not only many local minima but also exact barriers along transformation pathways to demonstrate the multi-minima character of our system. Furthermore, we present a framework, based on the quantum superposition method, that includes both configurational and vibrational entropy. As an example, we show for our system that the transition temperature between two of its phases is afflicted by an error of about 200 K if the multi-minima character is not taken into account. This indicates that it is absolutely essential to consider configurational entropy to obtain reliable finite temperature free energy rankings for complex molecular crystals.

Title: An extensive thermal conductivity measurement method based on atomic force microscopy
Authors: T. Serkan Kasırga, Berke Köker
Abstract: Heat transport in low-dimensional solids can significantly differ from their bulk counterpart due to various size-related effects. This offers rich heat transport phenomena to emerge. However, finding an appropriate thermometry method for thermal conductivity measurements at the reduced size and dimensionality of the samples is a challenge. Here, we propose and study the feasibility of a nanoscale resolution thermal conductivity measurement method based on bolometric thermometry implemented on an atomic force microscopy (AFM). The local heat exchange between the AFM tip and the sample occurs at a suspended section of the sample, and thermal modeling of the measured electrical resistance change resulting from the bolometric effect provides a unique value for thermal conductivity. As we illustrate via thermal simulations, the proposed method can measure thermal conductivity with thermal disturbance to the sample in as little as 0.2 K at ~20 nm lateral resolution. Our in-depth analysis shows the feasibility and extensive applicability of the proposed AFM-based bolometric thermometry method on low-dimensional materials both in diffusive and ballistic heat transport regimes from cryogenic to above-room temperature. Consequently, the proposed method can lead to a deeper experimental understanding of fundamental questions in nanoscale and low-dimensional heat transport phenomena in many different material classes, as well as Fourier and non-Fourier heat transfer regimes.

Title: Interplay of $d$- and $p$-States in RbTi$_3$Bi$_5$ and CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$ Flat-Band Kagome Metals
Authors: M. Wenzel, E. Uykur, A. A. Tsirlin, A. N Capa Salinas, B. R. Ortiz, S. D. Wilson, M. Dressel
Abstract: Shifting the Fermi level of the celebrated $AM_3X_5$ (135) compounds into proximity of flat bands strongly enhances electronic correlations and severely affects the formation of density waves and superconductivity. Our broadband infrared spectroscopy measurements of RbTi$_3$Bi$_5$ and CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$ combined with density-functional band-structure calculations reveal that the correlated Ti $d$-states are intricately coupled with the Bi $p$-states that form a tilted Dirac crossing. Electron-phonon coupling manifests itself in the strong damping of itinerant carriers and in the anomalous shape of the phonon line in RbTi$_3$Bi$_5$. An anomaly in these spectral features around 150 K can be paralleled to the onset of nematicity detected by low-temperature probes. Our findings show that the materials with low band filling open unexplored directions in the physics of kagome metals and involve electronic states of different nature strongly coupled with lattice dynamics.

Title: Rigorous Test for Quantum Integrability and Nonintegrability
Authors: Akihiro Hokkyo
Abstract: Whether or not a quantum many-body system is integrable, which is characterized by the presence or absence of local conserved quantities, drastically impacts the dynamics of isolated systems, including thermalization. Nevertheless, a rigorous and comprehensive method for deciding integrability or nonintegrability has remained elusive. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing rigorously provable tests for integrability and nonintegrability of quantum spin systems with finite-range interactions. Our approach establishes a new paradigm, moving beyond the conventional artisanal methods in the study of nonintegrability. Furthermore, it partially resolves the long-standing conjecture that integrability is governed by the presence or absence of local conserved quantities with small supports. The proposed framework guarantees that the nonintegrability of one-dimensional spin systems with translational symmetry can be confirmed algorithmically, regardless of system size.

Title: Elastic constants of single-crystalline NiTi studied by resonant ultrasound spectroscopy

Abstract: Contactless, laser-based resonant ultrasound spectroscopy was utilized to monitor changes in elastic properties in single-crystalline NiTi shape memory alloy. It was observed that the elastic behavior of the temperature-induced B19$^\prime$ martensite adopts the symmetry elements of the parent austenite phase, and thus, the changes over the transformation temperature can be represented by the temperature evolution of three cubic elastic coefficients. The experiments confirm that the transition during the cooling run is preceded by pronounced softening of the $c_{44}$ elastic coefficient, which leads to nearly complete vanishing of elastic anisotropy prior to the transition. Below the transition, this coefficient remains soft, and the character of anisotropy switches from $c_{44}/c^\prime>1$ to $c_{44}/c^\prime<1$. We rationalize this behavior from the mechanical instability of the B19$^\prime$ lattice with respect to shears along the (001)$_{B19^\prime}$ plane, which is known from first-principles calculations.

Title: Optimal performance of thermoelectric devices with small external irreversibility
Authors: Rajeshree Chakraborty, Ramandeep S. Johal
Abstract: In the thermodynamic analysis of thermoelectric devices, typical irreversibilities are for the processes of finite-rate heat transfer and Joule heating. Approximate analyses often focus on either internal or external irreversibility, yielding well-known expressions for the efficiency at maximum power (EMP), such as the Curzon-Ahlborn value for endoreversible model and the Schmiedl-Seifert form for exoreversible model. Within the Constant Properties model, we formulate a scenario that incorporates internal as well as external irreversibilities simultaneously. We employ the approximation of a symmetric and small external irreversibility (SEI), confining to the regime where the external conductance of the heat exchangers is large in comparison to the internal thermal conductance of the thermoelectric material. This approach allows us to derive a general expression for EMP, which depends on the ratio of internal to external conductance, apart from the figure of merit and ratio of temperatures. Extending our study to thermoelectric refrigerators under the similar assumptions, we also analyze the efficiency at maximum cooling power.

Title: Pathways to Bubble and Skyrmion Lattice Formation in Fe/Gd Multilayers

Abstract: The creation and control of magnetic spin textures is of great interest in fundamental research and future device-oriented applications. Fe/Gd multilayers host a rich variety of magnetic textures including topologically trivial bubbles and topologically protected skyrmions. Using time-resolved Kerr spectroscopy, we highlight how various control strategies, including temperature, out-of-plane magnetic fields and femtosecond light excitation, can be used to create such textures via different pathways. We find that varying the magnetic field for constant temperature leads to a different ($H, T$)-phase diagram of magnetic textures than moving along a temperature trajectory for constant magnetic field. Micromagnetic simulations corroborate this finding and allow to visualize the different paths taken. Furthermore, we show that the creation of bubbles and skyrmions in this material via impulsive light excitation is not solely governed by temperature-driven processes, since bubbles and skyrmions can be stabilized in parts of the ($H, T$)-phase diagram, where neither the constant temperature nor the constant magnetic field trajectory predict their existence. Using this phase diagram, we reason why bubble and skyrmion creation in this particular system is only possible from the stripe domain state. Our observations provide a versatile toolkit for tailoring the creation of magnetic spin textures in Fe/Gd multilayers.

Title: Dissipation bounds the coherence of stochastic limit cycles
Authors: Davide Santolin, Gianmaria Falasco
Abstract: Overdamped stochastic systems maintained far from equilibrium can display sustained oscillations with fluctuations that decrease with the system size. The correlation time of such noisy limit cycles expressed in units of the cycle period is upper-bounded by the entropy produced per oscillation. We prove this constraint for first-order nonlinear systems in arbitrary dimensions perturbed by weak, uncorrelated Gaussian noise. We then extend the result to important examples of more general stochastic dynamics, including electronic and chemical clocks, illustrating the practical relevance of the dissipation-coherence bound for electronic computing and thermodynamic inference.

Title: Quantifying the generation of negatively charged boron vacancies in He-ion irradiated hexagonal boron nitride

Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) hosts luminescent defects possessing spin qualities compatible with quantum sensing protocols at room temperature. Vacancies, in particular, are readily obtained via exposure to high-energy ion beams. While the defect creation mechanism via such irradiation is well understood, the occurrence rate of optically active negatively charged vacancies ($V_B^-$) is an open question. In this work, we exploit focused helium ions to systematically generate optically active vacancy defects in hBN flakes at varying density. By comparing the density-dependent spin splitting measured by magnetic resonance to calculations based on a microscopic charge model, in which we introduce a correction term due to a constant background charge, we are able to quantify the number of $V_B^-$ defects generated by the ion irradiation. We find that only a small fraction (0.2%) of all vacancies is in the optically active, negatively charged state. Our results provide a protocol for measuring the generation efficiency of $V_B^-$, which is necessary for understanding and optimizing luminescent centers in hBN.

Title: Nonequilibrium friction and free energy estimates for kinetic coarse-graining -- Driven particles in responsive media
Authors: Sebastian Milster, Joachim Dzubiella, Gerhard Stock, Steffen Wolf
Abstract: Predicting the molecular friction and energy landscapes under nonequilibrium conditions is key to coarse-graining the dynamics of selective solute transport through complex, fluctuating and responsive media, e.g., polymeric materials such as hydrogels, cellular membranes or ion channels. The analysis of equilibrium ensembles already allows such a coarse-graining for very mild nonequilibrium conditions. Yet in the presence of stronger external driving and/or inhomogeneous setups, the transport process is governed apart from a potential of mean force also by a nontrivial position- and velocity-dependent friction. It is therefore important to find suitable and efficient methods to estimate the mean force and the friction landscape, which then can be used in a low-dimensional, coarse-grained Langevin framework to predict the system's transport properties and timescales. In this work, we evaluate different coarse-graining approaches based on constant-velocity constraint simulations for generating such estimates using two model systems, which are a 1D responsive barrier as a minimalistic model and a single tracer driven through a 3D bead-spring polymer membrane as a more sophisticated problem. Finally, we demonstrate that the estimates from 3D constant-velocity simulations yield the correct velocity-dependent friction, which can be directly utilized for coarse-grained (1D) Langevin simulations with constant external driving forces.

Title: Magnetism and hidden quantum geometry in charge neutral twisted trilayer graphene
Authors: Alina Wania Rodrigues, Maciej Bieniek, Daniel Miravet, Pawel Hawrylak
Abstract: Here we present a theory of mirror-symmetric magic angle twisted trilayer graphene. The electronic properties are described by a Hubbard model with long range tunneling matrix elements. The electronic properties are obtained by solving the mean field Hubbard model. We obtain the bandstructure with characteristic flat bands and a Dirac cone. At charge neutrality, turning on electron-electron interactions results in metallic to antiferomagnetic phase transition, for Hubbard interaction strength considerably smaller than in other graphene multilayers. We analyze the stability of the antiferromagnetic state against the symmetry breaking induced by hexagonal boron nitride encapsulation, and mirror symmetry breaking caused by the application of electric fields that mix the Dirac cone with the flat bands. Additionally, we explore the topological properties of the system, revealing a hidden quantum geometry. Despite the flat bands having zero Chern numbers, the multiband Berry curvature distribution over the moiré Brillouin zone exhibits a non-trivial structure. Finally, we propose a mechanism to tune this quantum geometry, providing a pathway to control the system's topological properties.

Title: Deep learning with reflection high-energy electron diffraction images to predict cation ratio in Sr$_x$Ti$_{1-x}$O3 thin films
Authors: Sumner B. Harris, Patrick T. Gemperline, Christopher M. Rouleau, Rama K. Vasudevan, Ryan B. Comes
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) with in situ diagnostics offers a transformative approach to accelerate, understand, and control thin film synthesis by uncovering relationships between synthesis conditions and material properties. In this study, we demonstrate the application of deep learning to predict the stoichiometry of Sr$_x$Ti$_{1-x}$O3 thin films using reflection high-energy electron diffraction images acquired during pulsed laser deposition. A gated convolutional neural network trained for regression of the Sr atomic fraction achieved accurate predictions with a small dataset of 31 samples. Explainable AI techniques revealed a previously unknown correlation between diffraction streak features and cation stoichiometry in Sr$_x$Ti$_{1-x}$O3 thin films. Our results demonstrate how ML can be used to transform a ubiquitous in situ diagnostic tool, that is usually limited to qualitative assessments, into a quantitative surrogate measurement of continuously valued thin film properties. Such methods are critically needed to enable real-time control, autonomous workflows, and accelerate traditional synthesis approaches.

Title: Transverse spin photocurrents in ultrathin topological insulator films
Authors: Shahrzad Movafagh, Predrag Nikolic
Abstract: Nonlinear helicity-dependent photocurrents have been reported in 3D topological materials lacking inversion symmetry. Here, we theoretically study the charge and spin photocurrents generated by linear and circularly polarized radiation in ultrathin topological insulator films. Using time-dependent perturbation theory and detailed balance equations, we find that helical transverse spin currents are generated when the symmetry between the top and bottom film surfaces is disturbed. Such spin currents are invariant under in-plane mirror transformations but have $s$-wave and $d$-wave components in regard to transformations under $\pi/2$ rotations. Spin current photo-transistors and amplifiers can be based on these effects.

Title: Derivation of the free energy, entropy and specific heat for planar Ising models: Application to Archimedean lattices and their duals
Authors: Laurent Pierre, Bernard Bernu, Laura Messio
Abstract: The 2d ferromagnetic Ising model was solved by Onsager on the square lattice in 1944, and an explicit expression of the free energy density $f$ is presently available for some other planar lattices. An exact derivation of the critical temperature $T_c$ only requires a partial derivation of $f$ and has been performed on many lattices, including the 11 Archimedean lattices. We give general expressions of the free energy, energy, entropy and specific heat for planar lattices with a single type of non-crossing links. The specific heat exhibits a logarithmic singularity at $T_c$: $c_V(T)\sim -A\ln|1-T_c/T|$, in all the ferromagnetic and some antiferromagnetic cases. While the non-universal weight $A$ of the leading term has often been evaluated, this is not the case for the sub-leading order term $B$ such that $c_V(T)+A\ln|1-T_c/T|\sim B$, despite its strong impact on $c_V(T)$ values in the vicinity of $T_c$, particularly important in experimental measurements. Explicit values of these thermodynamic quantities and of $A$ and $B$ are given for the Archimedean lattices and their dual for both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions.

Title: Non-Hermitian catalysis of density-wave orders on Euclidean and hyperbolic lattices
Authors: Christopher A. Leong, Bitan Roy
Abstract: Depending on the lattice geometry, the nearest-neighbor (NN) tight-binding model for free fermions gives rise to particle-hole symmetric emergent Dirac liquid, Fermi liquid, and flat bands near the half-filling or zero-energy on bipartite Euclidean and hyperbolic lattices, respectively embedded on the flat and negatively curved spaces. Such noninteracting electronic fluids are characterized by a vanishing, a finite, and a diverging density of states near half-filling, respectively. A non-Hermitian generalization of this scenario resulting from an imbalance of the hopping amplitudes in the opposite directions between any pair of NN sites continues to accommodate a real eigenvalue spectrum over an extended non-Hermitian parameter regime. Most importantly, it reduces the band width without altering the characteristic scaling of the density of states close to the zero-energy. Here, we show that on two-dimensional bipartite Euclidean and hyperbolic lattices such a non-Hermiticity catalyzes the formation of both charge-density-wave and spin-density-wave orders at weaker (in comparison to the counterparts in conventional or Hermitian systems) NN Coulomb and on-site Hubbard repulsions, respectively. These two ordered states correspond to staggered patterns of average electronic density and spin between the NN sites, respectively, and both cause insulation in half-filled systems. We arrive at these conclusions by combining biorthogonal quantum mechanics and lattice-based self-consistent numerical mean-field analysis in the Hartree channel. We discuss the scaling of the associated mass gaps near the zero-energy with the non-Hermitian parameter, and also address the finite size scaling of the order parameters specifically on hyperbolic lattices with open boundary conditions. A robust general mathematical criterion for the proposed non-Hermitian catalysis mechanism for ordered phases is showcased.

Title: An unusual BPS equation
Authors: Constantin Bachas, Lorenzo Bianchi, Zhongwu Chen
Abstract: We prove a conjectured relation between the energy-momentum and the displacement norm of superconformal defects. The proof completes earlier results, and shows that supersymmetry identifies two natural notions of brane tension in Anti-de Sitter gravity. As a byproduct we show that a modification of the energy-momentum tensor that removes the stress of static superconformal defects, ensures also that the radiation these emit obeys the Null Energy Condition. This sheds new light on the radiation-reaction problem for moving charges.

Title: Large-scale stochastic simulation of open quantum systems
Authors: Aaron Sander, Maximilian Fröhlich, Martin Eigel, Jens Eisert, Patrick Gelß, Michael Hintermüller, Richard M. Milbradt, Robert Wille, Christian B. Mendl
Abstract: Understanding the precise interaction mechanisms between quantum systems and their environment is crucial for advancing stable quantum technologies, designing reliable experimental frameworks, and building accurate models of real-world phenomena. However, simulating open quantum systems, which feature complex non-unitary dynamics, poses significant computational challenges that require innovative methods to overcome. In this work, we introduce the tensor jump method (TJM), a scalable, embarrassingly parallel algorithm for stochastically simulating large-scale open quantum systems, specifically Markovian dynamics captured by Lindbladians. This method is built on three core principles where, in particular, we extend the Monte Carlo wave function (MCWF) method to matrix product states, use a dynamic time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) to significantly reduce errors during time evolution, and introduce what we call a sampling MPS to drastically reduce the dependence on the simulation's time step size. We demonstrate that this method scales more effectively than previous methods and ensures convergence to the Lindbladian solution independent of system size, which we show both rigorously and numerically. Finally, we provide evidence of its utility by simulating Lindbladian dynamics of XXX Heisenberg models up to a thousand spins using a consumer-grade CPU. This work represents a significant step forward in the simulation of large-scale open quantum systems, with the potential to enable discoveries across various domains of quantum physics, particularly those where the environment plays a fundamental role, and to both dequantize and facilitate the development of more stable quantum hardware.

Title: A strong-driving toolkit for topological Floquet energy pumps with superconducting circuits
Authors: Martin Ritter, David M. Long, Qianao Yue, Maya Amouzegar, Anushya Chandran, Alicia J. Kollár
Abstract: Topological Floquet energy pumps -- which use periodic driving to create a topologically protected quantized energy current -- have been proposed and studied theoretically, but have never been observed directly. Previous work proposed that such a pump could be realized with a strongly-driven superconducting qubit coupled to a cavity. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that the proposed hierarchy of energy scales and drive frequencies can be realized using a transmon qubit. We develop an experimental toolkit to realize the adiabatic driving field required for energy pumping using coordinated frequency modulation of the transmon and amplitude modulation of an applied resonant microwave drive. With this toolkit, we measure adiabatic evolution of the qubit under the applied field for times comparable to $T_1$, which far exceed the bare qubit dephasing time. This result paves the way for direct experimental observation of topological energy pumping.

Title: Engineering of Anyons on M5-Probes via Flux Quantization
Authors: Hisham Sati, Urs Schreiber
Abstract: These extended lecture notes survey a novel derivation of anyonic topological order (as seen in fractional quantum Hall systems) on single magnetized M5-branes probing Seifert orbi-singularities ("geometric engineering" of anyons), which we motivate from fundamental open problems in the field of quantum computing. The rigorous construction is non-Lagrangian and non-perturbative, based on previously neglected global completion of the M5-brane's tensor field by flux-quantization consistent with its non-linear self-duality and its twisting by the bulk C-field. This exists only in little-studied non-abelian generalized cohomology theories, notably in a twisted equivariant (and "twistorial") form of unstable Cohomotopy ("Hypothesis H"). As a result, topological quantum observables form Pontrjagin homology algebras of mapping spaces from the orbi-fixed worldvolume into a classifying 2-sphere. Remarkably, results from algebraic topology imply from this the quantum observables and modular functor of abelian Chern-Simons theory, as well as braid group actions on defect anyons of the kind envisioned as hardware for topologically protected quantum gates.

Title: Measuring decoherence due to quantum vacuum fluctuations
Authors: Anirudh Gundhi, Hendrik Ulbricht
Abstract: The interaction of a particle with vacuum fluctuations -- which theoretically exist even in the complete absence of matter -- can lead to observable irreversible decoherence, if it were possible to switch on and off the particle charge suddenly. We compute the leading order decoherence effect for such a scenario and propose an experimental setup for its detection. Such a measurement might provide further insights into the nature of vacuum fluctuations and a novel precision test for the decoherence theory.

Title: String Breaking in a $2+1$D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Lattice Gauge Theory
Authors: Umberto Borla, Jesse J. Osborne, Sergej Moroz, Jad C. Halimeh
Abstract: String breaking is an intriguing phenomenon crucial to the understanding of lattice gauge theories (LGTs), with strong relevance to both condensed matter and high-energy physics (HEP). Recent experiments investigating string breaking in $2+1$D (two spatial and one temporal dimensions) LGTs motivate a thorough analysis of its underlying mechanisms. Here, we perform matrix product state (MPS) simulations of string breaking in an experimentally relevant $2+1$D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT in the presence of two external charges. We provide a detailed description of the system in the confined phase, highlight a number of mechanisms which are responsible for string breaking, and argue that magnetic fluctuations have a stabilizing effect on the strings. Moreover, we show that deep in the confined regime the problem is dual to one-dimensional free fermions hopping on an open chain. Our work elucidates the microscopic processes of string breaking in $2+1$D LGTs, and our findings can be probed on current superconducting-qubit quantum computers.

Abstract: We prove that the mixing time of driven-dissipative activated random walk on an interval of length $n$ with uniform or central driving exhibits cutoff at $n$ times the critical density for activated random walk on the integers. The proof uses a new result for arbitrary graphs showing that the chain is mixed once activity is likely at every site.

Title: When less is more: evolving large neural networks from small ones
Authors: Anil Radhakrishnan, John F. Lindner, Scott T. Miller, Sudeshna Sinha, William L. Ditto
Abstract: In contrast to conventional artificial neural networks, which are large and structurally static, we study feed-forward neural networks that are small and dynamic, whose nodes can be added (or subtracted) during training. A single neuronal weight in the network controls the network's size, while the weight itself is optimized by the same gradient-descent algorithm that optimizes the network's other weights and biases, but with a size-dependent objective or loss function. We train and evaluate such Nimble Neural Networks on nonlinear regression and classification tasks where they outperform the corresponding static networks. Growing networks to minimal, appropriate, or optimal sizes while training elucidates network dynamics and contrasts with pruning large networks after training but before deployment.

Title: Tensor Completion for Surrogate Modeling of Material Property Prediction
Authors: Shaan Pakala, Dawon Ahn, Evangelos Papalexakis
Abstract: When designing materials to optimize certain properties, there are often many possible configurations of designs that need to be explored. For example, the materials' composition of elements will affect properties such as strength or conductivity, which are necessary to know when developing new materials. Exploring all combinations of elements to find optimal materials becomes very time consuming, especially when there are more design variables. For this reason, there is growing interest in using machine learning (ML) to predict a material's properties. In this work, we model the optimization of certain material properties as a tensor completion problem, to leverage the structure of our datasets and navigate the vast number of combinations of material configurations. Across a variety of material property prediction tasks, our experiments show tensor completion methods achieving 10-20% decreased error compared with baseline ML models such as GradientBoosting and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), while maintaining similar training speed.

Title: On the mean-field antiferromagnetic gap for the half-filled 2D Hubbard model at zero temperature
Authors: Edwin Langmann, Jonatan Lenells
Abstract: We consider the antiferromagnetic gap for the half-filled two-dimensional (2D) Hubbard model (on a square lattice) at zero temperature in Hartree-Fock theory. It was conjectured by Hirsch in 1985 that this gap, $\Delta$, vanishes like $\exp(-2\pi\sqrt{t/U})$ in the weak-coupling limit $U/t\downarrow 0$ ($U>0$ and $t>0$ are the usual Hubbard model parameters). We give a proof of this conjecture based on recent mathematical results about Hartree-Fock theory for the 2D Hubbard model. The key step is the exact computation of an integral involving the density of states of the 2D tight binding band relation.

Title: Neural Network Modeling of Microstructure Complexity Using Digital Libraries
Authors: Yingjie Zhao, Zhiping Xu
Abstract: Microstructure evolution in matter is often modeled numerically using field or level-set solvers, mirroring the dual representation of spatiotemporal complexity in terms of pixel or voxel data, and geometrical forms in vector graphics. Motivated by this analog, as well as the structural and event-driven nature of artificial and spiking neural networks, respectively, we evaluate their performance in learning and predicting fatigue crack growth and Turing pattern development. Predictions are made based on digital libraries constructed from computer simulations, which can be replaced by experimental data to lift the mathematical overconstraints of physics. Our assessment suggests that the leaky integrate-and-fire neuron model offers superior predictive accuracy with fewer parameters and less memory usage, alleviating the accuracy-cost tradeoff in contrast to the common practices in computer vision tasks. Examination of network architectures shows that these benefits arise from its reduced weight range and sparser connections. The study highlights the capability of event-driven models in tackling problems with evolutionary bulk-phase and interface behaviors using the digital library approach.

Title: Probing Non-Equilibrium Topological Order on a Quantum Processor
Authors: M. Will, T. A. Cochran, E. Rosenberg, B. Jobst, N. M Eassa, P. Roushan, M. Knap, A. Gammon-Smith, F. Pollmann
Abstract: Out-of-equilibrium phases in many-body systems constitute a new paradigm in quantum matter - they exhibit dynamical properties that may otherwise be forbidden by equilibrium thermodynamics. Among these non-equilibrium phases are periodically driven (Floquet) systems [1-5], that are generically difficult to simulate classically due to their high entanglement. Using an array of superconducting qubits, we realize a Floquet topologically ordered state theoretically proposed in Ref. [6], image the characteristic dynamics of its chiral edge modes, and characterize its emergent anyonic excitations. Devising an interferometric algorithm allows us to introduce and measure a bulk topological invariant to probe the dynamical transmutation of anyons for system sizes up to 58 qubits. Our work demonstrates that quantum processors can provide key insights into the thus-far largely unexplored landscape of highly entangled non-equilibrium phases of matter.

Title: The Floquet central spin model: A platform to realize eternal time crystals, entanglement steering, and multiparameter metrology
Authors: Hillol Biswas, Sayan Choudhury
Abstract: We propose and characterize protocols to realize eternal discrete time crystals (DTCs) in the periodically driven central spin model. These eternal DTCs exhibit perfect periodic revivals of the initial state at a time $mnT$ (where $n>1$ and $\{m,n\} \in \mathbb{Z}$), when the Ising interaction strength, $\lambda$ between the central spin and the satellite spins is tuned to certain values. The combination of perfect initial-state revival and time-translation-symmetry breaking leads to infinitely long-lived oscillations of the stroboscopic magnetization and the entanglement entropy in these DTCs even for a finite number of satellite spins. We analytically determine the conditions for the existence of these eternal DTCs and prove that the system exhibits eternal period-doubling oscillations ($n=2$) when $\lambda = 2 \pi$ for an arbitrary number of satellite spins. Furthermore, we propose a protocol to realize eternal higher-order(HO)-DTCs ($n>2$) by tuning $\lambda$ to $\pi$. Intriguingly, this protocol naturally steers the system through an entangled trajectory, thereby leading to the generation of maximally entangled Bell-cat states during the dynamical evolution of the HO-DTC. Finally, we demonstrate that these HO-DTCs can serve as a resource for Heisenberg-limited multiparameter sensing.

Title: Non-Markovianity of subsystem dynamics in isolated quantum many-body systems
Authors: Aditya Banerjee
Abstract: It is believed that an isolated quantum many-body system far away from equilibrium should try to attain equilibrium via a mechanism whereby any given subsystem acts as an open quantum system that is coupled to an environment which is the complementary part of the full system and undergoing a complicated equilibration process such that all the subsystems in the long-time limit attain equilibrium states compatible with the global equilibrium state. This picture begs the question whether the dynamics of any given subsystem is Markovian (monotonic loss of information and memory) or non-Markovian. In this work, by numerically probing the dynamical behaviour of the distance between \textit{temporally-separated} subsystem states, we reveal the telltale signatures and other associated features of quantum (non-)Markovianity of the dynamics of small subsystems of an isolated quantum spin system in one dimension (the Ising spin chain) brought far from equilibrium by quantum quenches. Additionally, remarkably systematic behaviour is seen in the dynamics of the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrices of the subsystems. These features strongly depend on the direction of quenching in the parameter space, with paramagnetic-to-ferromagnetic quenches offering considerably stronger signatures of subsystem non-Markovianity, for which we offer heuristic arguments.

Title: Comprehensive Enumeration of Three-Dimensional Photonic Crystals Enabled through Deep Learning Assisted Fourier Synthesis
Authors: Congcong Cui, Guangfeng Wei, Matthias Saba, Lu Han
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) photonic structures enable numerous applications through their unique ability to guide, trap, and manipulate light. Constructing new functional photonic crystals remains a significant challenge since traditional design principles based on band structure calculations require numerous time-consuming computations. Additionally, traditional design is based on enumerated structures making it difficult to find novel functional geometries. Here, we propose an ultra-fast photonic crystal performance prediction method to enable efficient structure optimization of arbitrary 3D photonic crystals even with multiple variable modulation. Our methodology combines Fourier synthesis-enabling the creation of any smooth geometry within a crystallographic space group-with deep learning, which facilitates efficient photonic characterization within the vast parameter space. Over 2 million structures can be explored within 2 hours using a mainstream desktop workstation. The ideal structures with desired band properties, such as large photonic bandgap, specific frequency ranges, etc., could be rapidly discovered. We systematically confirmed the well-documented assumption that the most significant photonic bandgaps are found in minimal surface morphologies, in which the single diamond (dia net) with Fd3m (227) symmetry reigns supreme among known photonic structures, followed by the chiral single gyroid (srs net) with I4132 (214) symmetry. Additionally, a less well-known 3D photonic crystal with lcs topology within Ia3d (230) was rediscovered to exhibit a wide complete photonic bandgap, comparable to the diamond and the gyroid net. Our method not only validates the assumed hierarchy of photonic structures but also lays the foundation for the tailored design of functional materials and offers fresh insights into the advancement of next-generation optical devices and information technology.

Title: Fractonic self-duality and covariant magnetic fractons
Authors: Erica Bertolini, Giandomenico Palumbo
Abstract: Fractons, excitations with restricted mobility, have emerged as a novel paradigm in high-energy and condensed matter physics, revealing deep connections to gauge theories and gravity. Here, we propose a tensorial generalization of electromagnetic duality using a doubled-potential framework with two symmetric tensor gauge fields. This approach symmetrically describes electric and magnetic sectors, introducing covariant magnetic fractons with reduced mobility and supporting a genuine fractonic self-duality. Notably, we find the absence of a Witten-like effect in the covariant fractonic case, precluding the emergence of fractonic dyons.

Title: Optimal generalisation and learning transition in extensive-width shallow neural networks near interpolation
Authors: Jean Barbier, Francesco Camilli, Minh-Toan Nguyen, Mauro Pastore, Rudy Skerk
Abstract: We consider a teacher-student model of supervised learning with a fully-trained 2-layer neural network whose width $k$ and input dimension $d$ are large and proportional. We compute the Bayes-optimal generalisation error of the network for any activation function in the regime where the number of training data $n$ scales quadratically with the input dimension, i.e., around the interpolation threshold where the number of trainable parameters $kd+k$ and of data points $n$ are comparable. Our analysis tackles generic weight distributions. Focusing on binary weights, we uncover a discontinuous phase transition separating a "universal" phase from a "specialisation" phase. In the first, the generalisation error is independent of the weight distribution and decays slowly with the sampling rate $n/d^2$, with the student learning only some non-linear combinations of the teacher weights. In the latter, the error is weight distribution-dependent and decays faster due to the alignment of the student towards the teacher network. We thus unveil the existence of a highly predictive solution near interpolation, which is however potentially hard to find.

Title: Probing topological matter and fermion dynamics on a neutral-atom quantum computer

Abstract: Quantum simulations of many-body systems are among the most promising applications of quantum computers. In particular, models based on strongly-correlated fermions are central to our understanding of quantum chemistry and materials problems, and can lead to exotic, topological phases of matter. However, due to the non-local nature of fermions, such models are challenging to simulate with qubit devices. Here we realize a digital quantum simulation architecture for two-dimensional fermionic systems based on reconfigurable atom arrays. We utilize a fermion-to-qubit mapping based on Kitaev's model on a honeycomb lattice, in which fermionic statistics are encoded using long-range entangled states. We prepare these states efficiently using measurement and feedforward, realize subsequent fermionic evolution through Floquet engineering with tunable entangling gates interspersed with atom rearrangement, and improve results with built-in error detection. Leveraging this fermion description of the Kitaev spin model, we efficiently prepare topological states across its complex phase diagram and verify the non-Abelian spin liquid phase by evaluating an odd Chern number. We further explore this two-dimensional fermion system by realizing tunable dynamics and directly probing fermion exchange statistics. Finally, we simulate strong interactions and study dynamics of the Fermi-Hubbard model on a square lattice. These results pave the way for digital quantum simulations of complex fermionic systems for materials science, chemistry, and high-energy physics.

Title: Symmetries of Weyl Superconductors with Different Pairings
Authors: Mehran Z. Abyaneh, Mehrdad Farhoudi, Mahdi Mashkoori
Abstract: We examine the Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian and its symmetries for a time-reversal symmetry broken three dimensional Weyl superconductor. In the limit of vanishing pairing potential, we specify that this Hamiltonian is invariant under two sets of continues symmetries, i.e. the $U(1)$ gauge symmetry and the $U(1)_A$ axial symmetry. Although a pairing of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer type spontaneously breaks both of these symmetries, we show that a Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov type pairing spontaneously breaks only the $U(1)$ gauge symmetry (that is then restored via the well-known scalar phase mode of superconductivity). Consequently, in the former case, two Nambu-Goldstone modes are required in the system to restore the broken symmetries. We indicate that one of these two modes is an emergent pseudo-scalar phase mode. We also demonstrate that such a phase mode leads to a pseudo-Meissner effect.

Title: Entropy functionals and equilibrium states in mixed quantum-classical dynamics
Authors: Cesare Tronci, David Martínez-Crespo, François Gay-Balmaz
Abstract: The computational challenges posed by many-particle quantum systems are often overcome by mixed quantum-classical (MQC) models in which certain degrees of freedom are treated as classical while others are retained as quantum. One of the fundamental questions raised by this hybrid picture involves the characterization of the information associated to MQC systems. Based on the theory of dynamical invariants in Hamiltonian systems, here we propose a family of hybrid entropy functionals that consistently specialize to the usual Rényi and Shannon entropies. Upon considering the MQC Ehrenfest model for the dynamics of quantum and classical probabilities, we apply the hybrid Shannon entropy to characterize equilibrium configurations for simple Hamiltonians. The present construction also applies beyond Ehrenfest dynamics.

Title: Singlet-only Always-on Gapless Exchange Qubits with Baseband Control
Authors: Nathan L. Foulk, Silas Hoffman, Katharina Laubscher, Sankar Das Sarma
Abstract: We propose a singlet-only always-on gapless exchange (SAGE) spin qubit that encodes a single qubit in the spins of four electrons while allowing universal baseband control. While conventional exchange-only qubits suffer from magnetic-field-gradient-induced leakage and coherent errors, for instance due to local nuclear environments and variations in the $g$-factor, the SAGE qubit subspace is protected from coherent errors due to local magnetic field gradients and leakage out of the computational subspace is energetically suppressed due to the exchange interactions between electrons being always-on. Consequently, we find that when magnetic gradient noise dominates over charge noise, coherence times and single-qubit gate infidelities of the SAGE qubit improve by an order of magnitude compared to conventional exchange-only qubits. Moreover, using realistic parameters, two-qubit gates can be performed with a single interqubit exchange pulse with times comparable in duration to conventional exchange-only qubits but with a significantly simplified pulse sequence.

Title: Connectivity-Dependent Attenuation Factor in Nanographene-Based Molecular Wires
Authors: Sara Sangtarash
Abstract: Designing molecular nanowires with high electrical conductance that facilitate efficient charge transport over long distances is highly desirable for future molecular-scale circuitry. However, most molecular wires act as tunnel barriers, and their electrical conductance decays exponentially with increasing length. Only recently have a few studies shown increasing conductance with length. In this study, we identify a new class of molecular wires that exhibit both an increase and a decrease in room-temperature conductance with length (a dual attenuation factor), depending on their connection points to the electrodes. We show that this dual attenuation factor is an inherent property of these graphene-like nanowires, and its demonstration depends on the constructive quantum interference pattern for different connectivities to the electrodes. This is significant because a given nanographene molecular wire can show both negative and positive attenuation factors. This enables the systematic design of connectivity-dependent high/low-conductance molecular wires for future molecular-scale circuitry.

Title: Pinning-depinning transitions in two classes of discrete elastic-string models in (2+1)-dimensions
Authors: Yongxin Wu, Hui Xia
Abstract: The pinning-depinning phase transitions of interfaces for two classes of discrete elastic-string models are investigated numerically. In the (1+1)-dimensions, we revisit these two elastic-string models with slight modification to growth rule, and compare the estimated values with the previous numerical and experimental results. For the (2+1)-dimensional case, we perform extensive simulations on pinning-depinning transitions in these { discrete models with quenched disorder}. For full comparisons in the physically relevant spatial dimensions, we also perform numerically two distinct universality classes, including the quenched Edwards-Wilkinson (QEW), and the quenched Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (QKPZ) equations with and without external driving forces. The critical exponents of these {systems in the presence of quenched disorder} are numerically estimated. Our results show that the critical exponents satisfy scaling relations well, and these two discrete elastic-string models do not fall into the existing universality classes. In order to visually comparisons of these {discrete systems with quenched disorder} in the (2+1)-dimensional cases, we present surface morphologies with various external driving forces during the saturated time regimes. The relationships between surface morphologies, scaling exponents and correlation length are also revealed.

Title: Symmetry-enforced double Weyl points, multiband quantum geometry, and singular flat bands of doping-induced states at the Fermi level
Authors: Moritz M. Hirschmann, Johannes Mitscherling
Abstract: Two common difficulties in the design of topological quantum materials are that the desired features lie too far from the Fermi level and are spread over a too-large energy range. Doping-induced states at the Fermi level provide a solution, where nontrivial topological properties are enforced by the doping-reduced symmetry. To show this, we consider a regular placement of dopants in a lattice of space group (SG) 176 ($P6\text{}_3/m$), which reduces the symmetry to SG 143 ($P3$). Our two- and four-band models feature double Weyl points, Chern bands, Van Hove singularities, nontrivial multiband quantum geometry due to mixed orbital character, and singular flat bands. We relate these features to density-functional theory (DFT) calculations for dopant and vacancy bands of lead apatite Pb$_{10}($PO$_4)_6$O and Pb$_{10}($PO$_4)_6($OH$)_2$, the van der Waals ferromagnet Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$, the semiconductor SiC, and the 2D dichalcogenide MoS$_2$.

Title: Information dynamics of our brains in dynamically driven disordered superconducting loop networks
Authors: Uday S. Goteti
Abstract: Complex systems of many interacting components exhibit patterns of recurrence and emergent behaviors in their time evolution that can be understood from a new perspective in physics of information dynamics modeled after one such system, our brains. A generic brain-like network model is derived from a system of disordered superconducting loops with Josephson junction oscillators to demonstrate these behaviors. The loops can trap multiples of fluxons that represent quantized information units in many distinct memory configurations populating a state space. The state can be updated by exciting the junctions to $fire$ or allow the movement of fluxons through the network as the current through them surpasses their thresholds. Simulations performed with a lumped circuit model of a 4-loop network show that information written through excitations is translated into stable states of trapped flux and their time evolution. Experimental implementation on the 4-loop network shows dynamically stable flux flow in each pathway characterized by the junction firing statistics. The network separates information from multiple excitations into state categories with large energy barriers observed in simulations that correspond to different flux (information) flow patterns observed across junctions in experiments. Strong evidence for associative and time-dependent (short-to-long-term) memories distributed across the network is observed, dependent on its intrinsic and geometrical properties as described by the model. Suitable network topologies can model various other systems leading to a universal description of the nature of information dynamics.

Zahid Hasan
Abstract: Correlated topological materials often maintain a delicate balance among physical symmetries: many topological orders are symmetry protected, while most correlated phenomena arise from spontaneous symmetry breaking. It is rare to find cases where symmetry breaking induces a non-trivial topological phase. Here, we present the discovery of such a phase in Ta2Pd3Te5, where Coulomb interactions form excitons, which condense below 100 K, opening a topological gap and creating a topological excitonic insulator. Our spectroscopy reveals the full spectral bulk gap stemming from exciton condensation. This excitonic insulator state spontaneously breaks mirror symmetries but involves a very weak structural coupling, as indicated by photoemission spectroscopy, thermodynamic measurements, and a detailed structural analysis. Notably, scanning tunneling microscopy uncovers gapless boundary modes in the bulk insulating phase. Their magnetic field response, together with theoretical modeling, suggests a topological origin. These observations establish Ta2Pd3Te5 as the first confirmed topological excitonic insulator in a three-dimensional crystal. This allows to access the associated physics through bulk-sensitive techniques. Furthermore, we uncover another surprising aspect of the topological excitonic insulator, a secondary excitonic instability near 5 K that breaks the translational symmetry. The wavevector of this state shows an unprecedented magnetic field tunability. Thus, we unveil a unique sequence of topological exciton condensations in a bulk crystal, offering new opportunities to study critical behavior and excitations.

Title: Effect of photoinduced screening on the spectroscopic signature of exciton-phonon coupling
Authors: Selene Mor, Valentina Gosetti, Vadim F. Agekyan, Claudio Giannetti, Luigi Sangaletti, Stefania Pagliara
Abstract: The light-mediated interaction of fermionic and bosonic excitations governs the optoelectronic properties of condensed matter systems. In photoexcited semiconductors, the coupling of electron-hole pairs (excitons) to coherent optical phonons enables a modulation of the excitonic resonance that is phase-locked to the frequency of the coupled vibrational mode. Moreover, due to the Coulombic nature of excitons, their dynamics are sensitive to transient changes in the screening by the photoexcited carriers. Interestingly, the effect of photoinduced screening on the transient optical signal originating from the exciton dynamics coupled to phonons is not yet established. By means of broadband transient reflectance spectroscopy, we disclose how exciton-phonon coupling manifests in either presence or absence of dynamical screening in a layered semiconductor. Further, we unveil the promoting role of photoinduced screening on these exciton-phonon coupled dynamics as opposed to the case in which the unscreened exciton-exciton repulsion likely dominates the nonequilibrium optical response. These findings set a protocol to look at an excitonic resonance and its fundamental many-body interactions on the ultrafast timescale, and provide new perspectives on the access to nonequilibrium coupled dynamics.

Title: Quantum Many-Body Scarring in a Non-Abelian Lattice Gauge Theory
Authors: Giuseppe Calajò, Giovanni Cataldi, Marco Rigobello, Darvin Wanisch, Giuseppe Magnifico, Pietro Silvi, Simone Montangero, Jad C. Halimeh
Abstract: Quantum many-body scarring (QMBS) is an intriguing mechanism of weak ergodicity breaking that has recently spurred significant attention. Particularly prominent in Abelian lattice gauge theories (LGTs), an open question is whether QMBS nontrivially arises in non-Abelian LGTs. Here, we present evidence of robust QMBS in a non-Abelian SU(2) LGT with dynamical matter. Starting in product states that require little experimental overhead, we show that prominent QMBS arises for certain quenches, facilitated through meson and baryon-antibaryon excitations, highlighting its non-Abelian nature. The uncovered scarred dynamics manifests as long-lived coherent oscillations in experimentally accessible local observables as well as prominent revivals in the state fidelity. Our findings bring QMBS to the realm of non-Abelian LGTs, highlighting the intimate connection between scarring and gauge symmetry, and are amenable for observation in a recently proposed trapped-ion qudit quantum computer.

Title: Magnetic geometry to quantum geometry nonlinear transports
Authors: Haiyuan Zhu, Jiayu Li, Xiaobing Chen, Yutong Yu, Qihang Liu
Abstract: Nonlinear transports (NLTs) have garnered broad attention based on their topological origin in quantum geometry. When quantum geometry meets magnetic geometry in magnets, their crossover excites diverse phenomena particularly related to antiferromagnetic spintronics. However, very few material platforms have been predicted and experimentally verified to date, where the material pool was subconsciously narrowed down due to the demand for spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Therefore, to boost antiferromagnetic spintronics, we consider the magnetic order induced quantum geometry and corresponding NLTs in antiferromagnets (AFMs). By integrating the state-of-the-art spin space group theory into the symmetry analysis, we find that collinear and coplanar magnetic geometry can only induce NLT driven by Berry curvature dipole, and noncoplanar one may trigger NLT driven by dipoles of Berry curvature, inverse mass, and quantum metric. Remarkably, a materials database of 260 AFMs with SOC-free NLT effects is established. Several prototypical material candidates are presented by first-principles calculations, including collinear AFM VNb$_3$S$_6$ with NLT driven by Berry curvature dipole, and a room-temperature noncoplanar AFM CrSe with NLTs driven by quantum metric dipole. Our work not only provides a universal theoretical framework for studying various magnetism-driven transport effects, but also predicts broad, experimentally accessible material platforms for antiferromagnetic spintronics.

Title: Refined Phase Diagram for a Spin-1 System Exhibiting a Haldane Phase
Authors: Mohamad Mousa, Birgit Wehefritz-Kaufmann, Sabre Kais, Shawn Cui, Ralph Kaufmann
Abstract: We provide the phase diagram of a 2-parameter spin-1 chain that has a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) Haldane phase using computational algorithms along with tensor-network tools. We improve previous results, showing the existence of a new phase and new triple points. New striking features are the triple end of the Haldane phase and the complexity of phases bordering the Haldane phase in proximity allowing moving to nearby non-SPT phases via small perturbations. These characteristics make the system, which appears in Rydberg excitons, e.g. in Cu$_2$O, a prime candidate for applications.

Title: Room temperature, cavity-free capacitive strong coupling to mechanical motion
Authors: Denise Puglia, Rachel Odessey, Peter S. Burns, Niklas Luhmann, Silvan Schmid, Andrew P. Higginbotham
Abstract: The back-action damping of mechanical motion by electromagnetic radiation is typically overwhelmed by internal loss channels unless demanding experimental ingredients such as superconducting resonators, high-quality optical cavities, or large magnetic fields are employed. Here we demonstrate the first room temperature, cavity-free, all-electric device where back-action damping exceeds internal loss, enabled by a mechanically compliant parallel-plate capacitor with a nanoscale plate separation and an aspect ratio exceeding 1,000. The device has four orders of magnitude lower insertion loss than a comparable commercial quartz crystal and achieves a position imprecision rivaling optical interferometers. With the help of a back-action isolation scheme, we observe radiative cooling of mechanical motion by a remote cryogenic load. This work provides a technologically accessible route to high-precision sensing, transduction, and signal processing.

Title: Through-Thickness Modelling of Metal Rolling using Multiple-Scale Asymptotics
Authors: Mozhdeh Erfanian, Edward James Brambley, Francis Flanagan, Doireann O'Kiely, Alison N. O'Connor
Abstract: A new semi-analytic model of the metal rolling process is introduced, which, for the first time, is able to predict the through-thickness stress and strain oscillations present in long thin roll-gaps. The model is based on multiple-scales asymptotics, assuming a long thin roll-gap and a comparably small Coulomb friction coefficient. The leading-order solution varies only on a long lengthscale corresponding to the roll-gap length and matches with slab models. The next-order correction varies on both this long lengthscale and a short lengthscale associated with the workpiece thickness, and reveals rapid stress and strain oscillation both in the rolling direction and through the thickness. For this initial derivation, the model assumes a rigid perfectly-plastic material behaviour. Despite these strong assumptions, this model compares well with finite element simulations that employ more realistic material behaviour (including elasticity and strain hardening). These assumptions facilitate the simplest possible model to provide a foundational understanding of the complex through-thickness behaviour observed in the finite element simulations, while requiring an order of only seconds to compute. This model can form the foundation of further improved models with more complicated mechanics in the future. Matlab code for evaluating the model is provided in the supplementary material.

Title: How to escape atypical regions in the symmetric binary perceptron: a journey through connected-solutions states
Authors: Damien Barbier
Abstract: We study the binary symmetric perceptron model, and in particular its atypical solutions. While the solution-space of this problem is dominated by isolated configurations, it is also solvable for a certain range of constraint density $\alpha$ and threshold $\kappa$. We provide in this paper a statistical measure probing sequences of solutions, where two consecutive elements shares a strong overlap. After simplifications, we test its predictions by comparing it to Monte-Carlo simulations. We obtain good agreement and show that connected states with a Markovian correlation profile can fully decorrelate from their initialization only for $\kappa>\kappa_{\rm no-mem.\, state}$ ($\kappa_{\rm no-mem.\, state}\sim \sqrt{0.91\log(N)}$ for $\alpha=0.5$ and $N$ being the dimension of the problem). For $\kappa<\kappa_{\rm no-mem.\, state}$, we show that decorrelated sequences still exist but have a non-trivial correlations profile. To study this regime we introduce an $Ansatz$ for the correlations that we label as the nested Markov chain.

Title: Quantum correction to the orbital Hall effect
Authors: Hong Liu, James H. Cullen, Daniel P. Arovas, Dimitrie Culcer
Abstract: Evaluations of the orbital Hall effect (OHE) have only retained inter-band matrix elements of the position operator. Here we evaluate the OHE including all matrix elements of the position operator, including the technically challenging intra-band elements. We recover previous results and find quantum corrections due to the non-commutativity of the position and velocity operators and inter-band matrix elements of the orbital angular momentum. The quantum corrections dominate the OHE responses of the topological antiferromagnet CuMnAs and of massive Dirac fermions.

Title: Thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity of molten salts: insights from molecular dynamics simulations and fundamental bounds
Authors: C. Cockrell, M. Withington, H. L. Devereux, A. M. Elena, I. T. Todorov, Z. K. Liu, S. L. Shang, J. S. McCloy, P. A. Bingham, K. Trachenko
Abstract: We use extensive molecular dynamics simulations to calculate thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity in two common molten salts, LiF and KCl. Our analysis includes the total thermal conductivity and intrinsic conductivity involving mass currents measured experimentally. The latter shows good agreement with the experimental data. We also calculate their key thermodynamic properties such as constant-pressure and constant-volume specific heats. We subsequently compare the results to the lower bound for thermal diffusivity expressed in terms of fundamental physical constants. Using this comparison and recent theoretical insights into thermodynamic and transport properties in liquids, we interpret thermal properties on the basis of atomistic dynamics and phonon excitations. We finally find that thermal diffusivity of molten salts is close to their kinematic viscosity.

Title: Constructing multicomponent cluster expansions with machine-learning and chemical embedding
Authors: Yann L. Müller, Anirudh Raju Natarajan
Abstract: Cluster expansions are commonly employed as surrogate models to link the electronic structure of an alloy to its finite-temperature properties. Using cluster expansions to model materials with several alloying elements is challenging due to a rapid increase in the number of fitting parameters and training set size. We introduce the embedded cluster expansion (eCE) formalism that enables the parameterization of accurate on-lattice surrogate models for alloys containing several chemical species. The eCE model simultaneously learns a low dimensional embedding of site basis functions along with the weights of an energy model. A prototypical senary alloy comprised of elements in groups 5 and 6 of the periodic table is used to demonstrate that eCE models can accurately reproduce ordering energetics of complex alloys without a significant increase in model complexity. Further, eCE models can leverage similarities between chemical elements to efficiently extrapolate into compositional spaces that are not explicitly included in the training dataset. The eCE formalism presented in this study unlocks the possibility of employing cluster expansion models to study multicomponent alloys containing several alloying elements.

Title: Josephson effect and self-trapping in helicoidal spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates with optical lattices
Authors: Sumaita Sultana, Golam Ali Sekh
Abstract: We consider blue matter-wave bright solitons in helicoidal spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates in optical lattices with a view to study Josephson-type oscillation and self-trapping of population imbalance between two pseudo-spin states. For fixed values of nonlinear interaction and lattice parameters, the population imbalance executes Josephson-type oscillation and the frequency of oscillation decreases with the increase of helicoidal gauge potential. The frequency of oscillation further increases in presence of nonlinear optical lattices. We find that the population imbalance can oscillate about a non-zero value and result self-trapping for proper choices of parameters of the system. The self-trapping can be enhanced by the increase of helicoidal gauge potential and by properly tuning the lattice parameters.

Title: A Boltzmann statistical approach for the analysis of polarization states in mixed phase ferroelectric materials: application to morphological phase boundary
Authors: Abhijit Pramanick, Laurent Daniel
Abstract: Ferroelectrics are widely used for a broad array of technological applications due to their attractive electrical and electromechanical properties. In order to obtain large functional properties, material compositions are often designed to favor a coexistence of multiple ferroelectric phases. For such compositions, the macroscopically observed properties are variously attributed to easier domain switching and/or phase transition. Nevertheless, modelling of concurrent domain switching and phase transition in mixed phase ferroelectrics remains a challenging task. Here, a methodology is presented to quantitatively evaluate the volume fractions of different domain variants in a mixed phase ferroelectric under complex electromechanical loading. The methodology combines the phenomenology of Landau free energy of ferroelectric phases with Boltzmann statistical analysis, and is presented for Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 near morphotropic phase boundary (MPB). It is shown that specific grain orientation has a significant effect on how proximity to phase boundary affects microscopic phenomena at the single-crystal level. An estimate of phase and domain switching behavior in a polycrystalline aggregate is subsequently obtained, and the resultant polarization and strain responses at the macroscopic level are computed for a material with random texture. The results indicate the progressive evolution of domain and phase fractions in a material near MPB with mixed ferroelectric phases. We show that in polycrystalline materials with compositions slightly on the tetragonal side of MPB, grains that exhibit large 90 domain switching have a larger contribution to the macroscopic strain response as compared to grains that undergo tetragonal-to-rhombohedral phase-switching.

Title: Cascade switching current detectors based on arrays of Josephson junctions
Authors: Roger Cattaneo, Artemii E. Efimov, Kirill I. Shiianov, Oliver Kieler, Vladimir M. Krasnov
Abstract: Cascade multiplication is a common technique to enhance the sensitivity of photon detectors. In this study, we demonstrate novel cascade-amplified superconducting detectors utilizing arrays of Josephson junctions. The mutual coupling between junctions induces avalanche-like switching of multiple junctions upon photon absorption, leading to cascade amplification of the readout voltage. We present two prototypes featuring either low-Tc linear Nb/NbxSi1-x/Nb arrays, or high-Tc stacked intrinsic Josephson junctions. Both devices exhibit clear antenna effects in microwave directivities, indicating good impedance matching and absorption efficiency. The combination of high absorption efficiency and large cascade amplification has the potential to produce broadband THz sensors with sensitivity exceeding 10^13 V/W.

Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) materials exhibit a variety of states that can be switched with low power at low temperatures, offering a viable cryogenic "flash memory" required for the classical control electronics for solid-state quantum information processing. In 1T-TaS2, a non-volatile metallic 'hidden' state can be induced from an insulating equilibrium charge-density wave ground state using either optical or electrical pulses. Given that conventional memristors form localized, filamentary channels which support the current, a key question for design concerns the geometry of the conduction region in highly energy-efficient 1T-TaS2 devices. Here, we report in operando micro-beam X-ray diffraction, fluorescence, and concurrent transport measurements, allowing us to spatially image the non-thermal hidden state induced by electrical switching of 1T-TaS2. Our results reveal a long-range ordered, non-filamentary switched state that extends well below the electrodes, implying that the self-organized, collective growth of the hidden phase is driven by a combination of charge flow and lattice strain. Our unique combination of techniques showcases the potential of non-destructive, three-dimensional X-ray imaging to study bulk switching properties in microscopic detail, namely electrical control of the vdW layer stacking.

Title: Efficient calculation of trion energies in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides
Authors: Sangeet S. Kumar, Brendan C. Mulkerin, Antonio Tiene, Francesca Maria Marchetti, Meera M. Parish, Jesper Levinsen
Abstract: The reduced dielectric screening in atomically thin semiconductors leads to remarkably strong electron interactions. As a result, bound electron-hole pairs (excitons) and charged excitons (trions), which have binding energies in the hundreds and tens of meV, respectively, typically dominate the optical properties of these materials. However, the long-range nature of the interactions between charges represents a significant challenge to the exact calculation of binding energies of complexes larger than the exciton. Here, we demonstrate that the trion binding energy can be efficiently calculated directly from the three-body Schrödinger equation in momentum space. Key to this result is a highly accurate way of treating the pole of the electronic interactions at small momentum exchange (i.e., large separation between charges) via the Landé subtraction method. Our results are in excellent agreement with quantum Monte Carlo calculations, while yielding a substantially larger ratio of the trion to exciton binding energies than obtained in recent variational calculations. Our numerical approach may be extended to a host of different few-body problems in 2D semiconductors, and even potentially to the description of exciton polarons.

Title: Mode-coupling formulation of heat transport in anharmonic materials
Authors: Aloïs Castellano, J.P. Alvarinhas Batista, Olle Hellman, Matthieu J. Verstraete
Abstract: The temperature-dependent phonons are a generalization of interatomic force constants varying in T, which as found widespread use in computing the thermal transport of materials. A formal justification for using this combination to access thermal conductivity in anharmonic crystals, beyond the harmonic approximation and perturbation theory, is still lacking. In this work, we derive a theory of heat transport of anharmonic crystals, using the mode-coupling theory of anharmonic lattice dynamics. Starting from the Green-Kubo formula, we develop the thermal conductivity tensor based on the system's dynamical susceptibility, or spectral function. Our results account for both the diagonal and off-diagonal contributions of the heat current, with and without collective effects. We implement our theory in the TDEP package, and have notably introduced a Monte Carlo scheme to compute phonon scattering due to third- and fourth-order interactions, achieving a substantial reduction in computational cost which enables full convergence of such calculations for the first time. We apply our methodology to systems with varying regimes of anharmonicity and thermal conductivity to demonstrate its universality. These applications highlight the importance of the phonon renormalizations and their interactions beyond the harmonic order. Overall, our work advances the understanding of thermal conductivity in anharmonic crystals and provides a theoretically robust framework for predicting heat transport in complex materials.

Title: Advancing Natural Orbital Functional Calculations Through Deep Learning-Inspired Techniques for Large-Scale Strongly Correlated Electron Systems
Authors: Juan Felipe Huan Lew-Yee, Jorge M. del Campo, Mario Piris
Abstract: Natural orbital functional (NOF) theory offers a promising approach for studying strongly correlated systems at an affordable computational cost, with an accuracy comparable to highly demanding wavefunction-based methods. However, its widespread adoption in cases involving a large number of correlated electrons has been limited by the extensive iterations required for convergence. In this work, we present a disruptive approach that embeds the techniques used for optimization in deep learning within the NOF calculation, constituting a substantial advance in the scale of accessible systems. The revamped procedure is based on the adaptive momentum technique for orbital optimization, alternated with the optimization of the occupation numbers, significantly improving the computational feasibility of challenging calculations. This work represents a complete change in the size scale of the systems that can be reached using NOF theory. We demonstrate this with three examples that involve a large number of electrons: (i) the symmetric dissociation of a large hydrogen cluster, (ii) an analysis of occupancies distribution in fullerenes, and (iii) a study of the singlet-triplet energy gap in linear acenes. Notably, the hydrogen cluster calculation, featuring 1000 electrons, represents the largest NOF calculation performed to date and one of the largest strongly correlated electron calculations ever reported. This system, which serves as an ideal model for a strongly correlated Mott insulator, illustrates a metal-to-insulator transition where all electrons participate in the correlation phenomenon, offering insight in a unique challenge. We anticipate that this work will enable the practical application of NOFs to increasingly complex and intriguing systems, leveraging the method's inherent scalability and accuracy.

Title: Applications of machine learning in ion beam analysis of materials
Authors: Tiago Fiorini da Silva
Abstract: Ion Beam Analysis (IBA) is an established tool for material characterization, providing precise information on elemental composition, depth profiles, and structural information in the region near the surface of materials. However, traditional data processing methods can be slow and computationally intensive, limiting the efficiency and speed of the analysis. This article explores the current landscape of applying Machine Learning Algorithms (MLA) in the field of IBA, demonstrating the immense potential to optimize and accelerate processes. We present how ML has been employed to extract valuable insights from large datasets, automate repetitive tasks, and enhance the interpretability of results, with practical examples of applications in various IBA techniques, such as RBS, PIXE, and others. Finally, perspectives on using MLA to approach open problems in IBA are also discussed.

Title: Photon-assisted stochastic resonance in nanojunctions
Authors: Michael Ridley, Leo Bellassai, Michael Moskalets, Lev Kantorovich, Riku Tuovinen
Abstract: We study stochastic resonance in molecular junctions driven by a periodically-varying external field. This is done using the time-dependent Landauer-B{ü}ttiker formalism, which follows from exact analytical solutions to the Kadanoff-Baym equations describing the molecular junction subject to an arbitrary time-dependent bias. We focus on a double quantum dot nanojunction and compare the effects of the temperature with the fluctuating bias in the statically-driven case. We then consider the combined effect of AC-driving and white noise fluctuations on the rectified current through the nanojunction, and find a stochastic resonance effect, where at certain driving conditions the bias fluctuations enhance the current signal. The study is then extended to include the color noise in the applied bias, so that the combined effect of the color noise correlation time and driving frequency on stochastic resonance is investigated. We thereby demonstrate that photon-assisted transport can be optimized by a suitably tuned environment.

Title: Towards optimization of the Josephson diode effect
Authors: Michiyasu Mori, Wataru Koshibae, Sadamichi Maekawa
Abstract: We theoretically study the Josephson diode effect in the junction of singlet superconductors separated by the Rashba system in the in-plane magnetic field perpendicular to the bias current. The coupling energy of two superconductors is formulated under the bias current using a tunneling Hamiltonian with a one-dimensional model. The bias current shifts the Fermi momentum in the Rashba system due to the continuity of the electronic current. Including the shift of Fermi momentum in the coupling energy, it is found that the critical current is asymmetric with respect to the current and the magnetic field, i.e., Josephson diode effect. Depending on a distance between the superconducting electrodes $d$, the Josephson diode effect changes its magnitude and sign. The magnitude is inversely proportional to a band split caused by the spin-orbit interaction. Since $d$ is experimentally controllable, the Josephson diode effect can be optimized by tuning of $d$. Our theory develops a new guiding principle to design the Josephson diode device.

Title: Theory of Irreversibility in Quantum Many-Body Systems
Authors: Takato Yoshimura, Lucas Sá
Abstract: We address the longstanding challenge in quantum many-body theory of reconciling unitary dynamics with irreversible relaxation. In classical chaos, the unitary evolution operator develops Ruelle-Pollicott (RP) resonances inside the unit circle in the continuum limit, leading to mixing. In the semiclassical limit, chaotic single-particle quantum systems relax with the same RP resonances. In contrast, the theory of quantum many-body RP resonances and their link to irreversibility remain underdeveloped. Here, we relate the spectral form factor to the sum of autocorrelation functions and, in generic many-body lattice systems without conservation laws, argue that all quantum many-body RP resonances converge inside the unit disk, highlighting the role of nonunitary and the thermodynamic limit. While we conjecture this picture to be general, we analytically prove the emergence of irreversibility in the random phase model (RPM), a paradigmatic Floquet quantum circuit model, in the limit of large local Hilbert space dimension. To this end, we couple it to local environments and compute the exact time evolution of autocorrelation functions, the dissipative form factor, and out-of-time-order correlation functions (OTOCs). Although valid for any dissipation strength, we then focus on weak dissipation to clarify the origin of irreversibility in unitary systems. When the dissipationless limit is taken after the thermodynamic limit, the unitary quantum map develops an infinite tower of decaying RP resonances -- chaotic systems display so-called anomalous relaxation. We also show that the OTOC in the RPM can undergo a two-stage relaxation and that during the second stage, the approach to the stationary value is again controlled by the leading RP resonance.

Title: Director-layer dynamics in the smectic-ZA phase of a ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal
Authors: Arjun Ghimire, Bijaya Basnet, Hao Wang, Parikshit Guragain, Alan Baldwin, Robert Twieg, Oleg Lavrentovich, James Gleeson, Antal Jakli, Samuel Sprunt
Abstract: A dynamic light scattering study of director-layer fluctuations in the anti-ferroelectric smectic-ZA phase of the ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal DIO is reported. The dynamics are consistent with the distinctive feature of the ZA phase that the smectic layers form parallel to the axis of molecular orientational order (director). A model is developed to describe quantitatively the dispersion of the fluctuation relaxation rates. The model is based on a specialization of the elastic free energy density of the smectic-C phase to the case of 90 degree director tilt, a "first-order" approximation of the viscous stresses by their form for an incompressible uniaxial fluid, and a treatment of the effect of chevron layer structure that develops in planar sample cells due to temperature-dependent layer shrinkage, as documented in previous studies on DIO. From the modeling, the layer compression elastic constant is estimated to be ~100 times lower in the smectic-ZA phase than in an ordinary smectic-A liquid crystal. Possible effects of the antiferroelectric layer polarization on the director splay elasticity and viscosity are described. The temperature dependencies of the splay, twist, and bend elastic constants and associated viscosities in the higher temperature nematic phase are also presented.

Title: Anomalous Lattice Effect Originated Metal-Insulator Transition in FeSe$_x$
Authors: Shubham Purwar, Shinjini Paul, Kritika Vijay, R. Venkatesh, Soma Banik, P. Mahadevan, S. Thirupathaiah
Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation of the structural, electrical transport, and magnetic properties of FeSe$_{\it{x}}$ ($\it{x}$ = 1.14, 1.18, 1.23, 1.28, and 1.32) to unravel the mechanism of the metal-insulator transition observed in these systems. For this, we systematically evaluated the structural parameters of FeSe$_{\it{x}}$ as a function of Se concentration and temperature. We observe increased lattice constants and cell volume with increased Se concentration. On the other hand, the temperature-dependent XRD studies suggest unusual lattice change around the metal-insulator (MI) transition temperature of the respective compositions. This remarkable observation suggests that the anomalous lattice effect originates the MI transition in these systems. Additionally, our density of states (DOS) calculations on FeSe$_{1.14}$ qualitatively explain the MI transition, as the low-temperature (50 K) structure DOS suggests a metallic nature and the high-temperature (300 K) structure DOS shows a gap near the Fermi level.

Title: Conditions for orbital-selective altermagnetism in Sr2RuO4: tight-binding model, similarities with cuprates, and implications for superconductivity
Authors: Carmine Autieri, Giuseppe Cuono, Debmalya Chakraborty, Paola Gentile, Annica M. Black-Schaffer
Abstract: The vibrational modes in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ easily induce octahedral rotations without tilting. Being on the verge of a magnetic instability, such propensity of octahedral rotation may also produce magnetic fluctuations. In this work, we analyze the long-range magnetic phase diagram incorporating such octahedral rotations and demonstrate the possibility of an altermagnetic phase in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. Using ab-initio calculations, we first study single layer Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ with octahedral rotations, obtaining an orbital-selective $g$-wave altermagnetic phase. We further provide an effective $t_{2g}$ tight-binding model, demonstrating that the $g$-wave altermagnetism is primarily a product of second and third nearest neighbor interorbital hybridizations between the ${\gamma}z$ ($\gamma=x,y$) orbitals, but only a much longer range intraorbital hybridization in the $xy$ orbitals, establishing a strong orbital-selectiveness for the altermagnetism. Notably, by replacing the $xy$ orbital with the $x^2-y^2$ orbital, a similar tight-biding model may be used to investigate the hole-doped cuprate superconductors. We then study bulk Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, where we find the altermagnetic phase as the magnetic ground state for a range of finite octahedral rotations. In the bulk, interlayer hopping breaks some of the symmetries of the $g$-wave altermagnet, resulting in a $d_{xy}$-wave altermagnet, still with orbital selectiveness. We also include relativistic effects through spin-orbit coupling and obtain that an effective staggered Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction generates weak ferromagnetism. Finally, we discuss the implications of the altermagnetic order on the intrinsic superconductivity of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. Assuming in-plane and intraorbital pairing, the altermagnetism favors spin-singlet $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave or $g$-wave pairing, or (nematic or chiral) combinations thereof.

Title: Sensitive particle shape dependence of growth-induced mesoscale nematic structure
Authors: Jonas Isensee, Philip Bittihn
Abstract: Directed growth, anisotropic cell shapes, and confinement drive self-organization in multicellular systems. We investigate the influence of particle shape on the distribution and dynamics of nematic microdomains in a minimal in-silico model of proliferating, sterically interacting particles, akin to colonies of rod-shaped bacteria. By introducing continuously tuneable tip variations around a common rod shape with spherical caps, we find that subtle changes significantly impact the emergent dynamics, leading to distinct patterns of microdomain formation and stability. Our analysis reveals separate effects of particle shape and aspect ratio, as well as a transition from exponential to scale-free size distributions, which we recapitulate using an effective master equation model. This allows us to relate differences in microdomain size distributions to different physical mechanisms of microdomain breakup. Our results thereby contribute to the characterization of the effective dynamics in growing aggregates at large and intermediate length scales and the microscopic properties that control it. This could be relevant both for biological self-organization and design strategies for future artificial systems.

Title: Exploring the defect landscape and dopability of chalcogenide perovskite BaZrS3
Authors: Rushik Desai (1), Shubhanshu Agarwal (2), Kiruba Catherine Vincent (2), Alejandro Strachan (1), Rakesh Agrawal (2), Arun Mannodi-Kanakkithodi (1) ((1) School of Materials Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA (2) School of Chemical Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA)
Abstract: BaZrS3 is a chalcogenide perovskite that has shown great promise as a photovoltaic absorber over the last few years. Despite its impressive electronic and optical properties, native point defects and impurities could impose significant limitations on the photovoltaic performance of BaZrS3. Such defects may form spontaneously, create deep levels that act as traps for carriers, and influence the device performance by changing the concentrations of electrons and holes. On the other hand, functional dopants that dominate over native defects can help tune the nature of conductivity in BaZrS3. In this work, we applied first principles computations to comprehensively investigate the defect landscape of BaZrS3, including all intrinsic defects and select impurities and dopants. BaZrS3 intrinsically exhibits n-type equilibrium conductivity under Zr-rich and Zr-poor conditions, as determined by low energy vacancy and interstitial defects. O and H impurities create relatively low energy neutral and donor-type defects. La and Nb are calculated to be stable donor-type defects, which will make BaZrS3 even more n-type, whereas As and O form amphoteric defects, which generally show higher formation energies than native defects. This work highlights the difficulty of tuning the electrical properties of BaZrS3 via doping, especially making it more p-type. However, it points to some possible avenues to inform our future work.

Title: Two-dimensional talc as a natural hyperbolic material

Michael Klopf, Susanne C. Kehr, Lukas M. Eng, Alisson R. Cadore, Rainer Hillenbrand, Raul O. Freitas, Ingrid D. Barcelos
Abstract: This study demonstrates that two-dimensional talc, a naturally abundant mineral, supports hyperbolic phonon-polaritons (HPhPs) at mid-infrared wavelengths, thus offering a low-cost alternative to synthetic polaritonic materials. Using scattering scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM) and synchrotron infrared nano spectroscopy (SINS), we reveal tunable HPhP modes in talc flakes of a long lifetime. These results highlight the potential of natural 2D talc crystals to constituting an effective platform for establishing scalable optoelectronic and photonic devices.

Title: Singularity and universality from von Neumann to R\'enyi entanglement entropy and disorder operator in Motzkin chains
Authors: Jianyu Wang, Zenan Liu, Zheng Yan, Congjun Wu
Abstract: The Rényi entanglement entropy is widely used in studying quantum entanglement properties in strongly correlated systems, whose analytic continuation as $n \to 1$ is often believed to give rise to the celebrated von Neumann entanglement entropy. However, this process for the colored Motzkin spin chain exhibits a singularity that yields different scaling behaviors of $\sim \sqrt{l}$ and $\sim \log{l}$ for the von Neumann and Rényi entropies, respectively. It can be understood by the exponential increasing desity of states in its entanglement spectrum. We have also employed disorder operators under various symmetries to study such a system. The analytical and numerical results reveal that the scaling of disorder operators is also $\log{l}$ in the leading term, the same as the Rényi entanglement entropy. We propose that the coefficient of the term $\log{l}$ is a universal constant, both in Rényi entropies and disorder operators, which could be used to identify the constraint physics of Motzkin walks.

Title: Spin-Triplet Pairing in Heavy Nuclei is Stable Against Deformation
Authors: G. Palkanoglou, M. Stuck, A. Gezerlis
Abstract: Any experimental evidence of nucleons paired in spin-triplet states will confirm the existence of an exotic phase of nuclear matter. This type of nuclear superfluidity has been hypothesized in heavy nuclei, where the antagonizing spin-orbit effects are damped, and there it oftentimes coexists with traditional spin-singlet pairing, leading to the possibility of mixed-spin pairing. Realistic nuclear deformation, not considered in such studies, could make-or-break these proposals, since its effect on triplet-pairing, and the competition (and coexistence) of the two superfluid phases, was expected to be crucial. We report on a thorough study on the effect of deformation on triplet-, singlet-, and mixed-spin pairing in the relevant region of the nuclear chart. We find that, at low isospin asymmetries, spin-triplet pairing is enhanced by deformation, while below the proton-drip line, the novel superfluid phase survives alongside the usual spin-singlet pairing. These results suggest that spin-triplet superfluidity exists in realistic nuclei and can be probed in the lab.

Title: Quantum Origin of Limit Cycles, Fixed Points, and Critical Slowing Down
Authors: Shovan Dutta, Shu Zhang, Masudul Haque
Abstract: Among the most iconic features of classical dissipative dynamics are persistent limit-cycle oscillations and critical slowing down at the onset of such oscillations, where the system relaxes purely algebraically in time. On the other hand, quantum systems subject to generic Markovian dissipation decohere exponentially in time, approaching a unique steady state. Here we show how coherent limit-cycle oscillations and algebraic decay can emerge in a quantum system governed by a Markovian master equation as one approaches the classical limit, illustrating general mechanisms using a single-spin model and a two-site lossy Bose-Hubbard model. In particular, we demonstrate that the fingerprint of a limit cycle is a slow-decaying branch with vanishing decoherence rates in the Liouville spectrum, while a power-law decay is realized by a spectral collapse at the bifurcation point. We also show how these are distinct from the case of a classical fixed point, for which the quantum spectrum is gapped and can be generated from the linearized classical dynamics.

Title: Yang-Lee Zeros in Quantum Phase Transition: An Entanglement Perspective
Authors: Hongchao Li
Abstract: We study the Yang-Lee theory in quantum phase transitions from the perspective of quantum entanglement in one-dimensional many-body systems. We primarily focus on the distribution of Yang-Lee zeros and its associated Yang-Lee edge singularity of two prototypical models: the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model and the \emph{XXZ} spin chain. By taking the zero-temperature limit, we show how the Yang-Lee zeros approach the quantum phase transition points on the complex plane of parameters. To characterize the edge singularity induced by Yang-Lee zeros in quantum phase transition, we introduce the entanglement entropy of the ground state to show that the edges of Yang-Lee zeros lead to the ground-state entanglement transition. We further show that our results are also applicable to the general non-interacting parity-time-symmetric Hamiltonians.

Title: Active Loop Extrusion guides DNA-Protein Condensation
Authors: Ryota Takaki, Yahor Savich, Jan Brugués, Frank Jülicher
Abstract: The spatial organization of DNA involves DNA loop extrusion and the formation of protein-DNA condensates. While the significance of each process is increasingly recognized, their interplay remains unexplored. Using molecular dynamics simulation and theory we investigate this interplay. Our findings reveal that loop extrusion can enhance the dynamics of condensation and promotes coalescence and ripening of condensates. Further, the DNA loop enables condensate formation under DNA tension and position condensates. The concurrent presence of loop extrusion and condensate formation results in the formation of distinct domains similar to TADs, an outcome not achieved by either process alone.

Title: Josephson currents in neutron stars
Authors: Armen Sedrakian, Peter B. Rau
Abstract: We demonstrate that the interface between $S$-wave and $P$-wave paired superfluids in neutron stars induces a neutron supercurrent, a charge-neutral analog of the Josephson junction effect in electronic superconductors. The proton supercurrent entrainment by the neutron superfluid generates, in addition to the neutral supercurrent, a charged current across the interface. Beyond this stationary effect, the motion of the neutron vortex lines responding to secular changes in the neutron star's rotation rate induces a time-dependent oscillating Josephson current across this interface when proton flux tubes are dragged along with them. We show that such motion produces radiation from the interface once clusters of proton flux tubes intersect the interface. The power of radiation exceeds by orders of magnitude the Ohmic dissipation of currents in neutron stars. This effect appears to be phenomenologically significant enough to heat the star and alter its cooling rate during the photon cooling era.

Title: Transfer Learning in $\ell_1$ Regularized Regression: Hyperparameter Selection Strategy based on Sharp Asymptotic Analysis
Authors: Koki Okajima, Tomoyuki Obuchi
Abstract: Transfer learning techniques aim to leverage information from multiple related datasets to enhance prediction quality against a target dataset. Such methods have been adopted in the context of high-dimensional sparse regression, and some Lasso-based algorithms have been invented: Trans-Lasso and Pretraining Lasso are such examples. These algorithms require the statistician to select hyperparameters that control the extent and type of information transfer from related datasets. However, selection strategies for these hyperparameters, as well as the impact of these choices on the algorithm's performance, have been largely unexplored. To address this, we conduct a thorough, precise study of the algorithm in a high-dimensional setting via an asymptotic analysis using the replica method. Our approach reveals a surprisingly simple behavior of the algorithm: Ignoring one of the two types of information transferred to the fine-tuning stage has little effect on generalization performance, implying that efforts for hyperparameter selection can be significantly reduced. Our theoretical findings are also empirically supported by applications on real-world and semi-artificial datasets using the IMDb and MNIST datasets, respectively.

Title: Threefold Way for Typical Entanglement
Authors: Haruki Yagi, Ken Mochizuki, Zongping Gong
Abstract: A typical quantum state with no symmetry can be realized by letting a random unitary act on a fixed state, and the subsystem entanglement spectrum follows the Laguerre unitary ensemble (LUE). For integer-spin time reversal symmetry, we have an analogous scenario where we prepare a time-reversal symmetric state and let random orthogonal matrices act on it, leading to the Laguerre orthogonal ensemble (LOE). However, for half-integer-spin time reversal symmetry, a straightforward analogue leading to the Laguerre symplectic ensemble (LSE) is no longer valid due to that time reversal symmetric state is forbidden by the Kramers' theorem. We devise a system in which the global time reversal operator is fractionalized on the subsystems, and show that LSE arises in the system. Extending this idea, we incorporate general symmetry fractionalization into the system, and show that the statistics of the entanglement spectrum is decomposed into a direct sum of LOE, LUE, and/or LSE. Here, various degeneracies in the entanglement spectrum may appear, depending on the non-Abelian nature of the symmetry group and the cohomology class of the non-trivial projective representation on the subsystem. Our work establishes the entanglement counterpart of the Dyson's threefold way for Hamiltonians with symmetries.

Title: Photonic Simulation of Localization Phenomena Using Boson Sampling
Authors: Anuprita V. Kulkarni, Vatsana Tiwari, Auditya Sharma, Ankur Raina
Abstract: Quantum simulation in its current state faces experimental overhead in terms of physical space and cooling. We propose boson sampling as an alternative compact synthetic platform performing at room temperature. Identifying the capability of estimating matrix permanents, we explore the applicability of boson sampling for tackling the dynamics of quantum systems without having access to information about the full state vector. By mapping the time-evolution unitary of a Hamiltonian onto an interferometer via continuous-variable gate decompositions, we present proof-of-principle results of localization characteristics of a single particle. We study the dynamics of one-dimensional tight-binding systems in the clean and quasiperiodic-disordered limits to observe Bloch oscillations and dynamical localization, and the delocalization-to-localization phase transition in the Aubry- Andre-Harper model respectively. Our computational results obtained using boson sampling are in complete agreement with the dynamical and static results of non-interacting tight-binding systems obtained using conventional numerical calculations. Additionally, our study highlights the role of number of sampling measurements or shots for simulation accuracy.

Abstract: The efficacy of mathematical models heavily depends on the quality of the training data, yet collecting sufficient data is often expensive and challenging. Many modeling applications require inferring parameters only as a means to predict other quantities of interest (QoI). Because models often contain many unidentifiable (sloppy) parameters, QoIs often depend on a relatively small number of parameter combinations. Therefore, we introduce an information-matching criterion based on the Fisher Information Matrix to select the most informative training data from a candidate pool. This method ensures that the selected data contain sufficient information to learn only those parameters that are needed to constrain downstream QoIs. It is formulated as a convex optimization problem, making it scalable to large models and datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach across various modeling problems in diverse scientific fields, including power systems and underwater acoustics. Finally, we use information-matching as a query function within an Active Learning loop for material science applications. In all these applications, we find that a relatively small set of optimal training data can provide the necessary information for achieving precise predictions. These results are encouraging for diverse future applications, particularly active learning in large machine learning models.

Title: The quantum magic of fermionic Gaussian states
Authors: Mario Collura, Jacopo De Nardis, Vincenzo Alba, Guglielmo Lami
Abstract: We introduce an efficient method to quantify nonstabilizerness in fermionic Gaussian states, overcoming the long-standing challenge posed by their extensive entanglement. Using a perfect sampling scheme based on an underlying determinantal point process, we compute the Stabilizer Rényi Entropies (SREs) for systems with hundreds of qubits. Benchmarking on random Gaussian states with and without particle conservation, we reveal an extensive leading behavior equal to that of Haar random states, with logarithmic subleading corrections. We support these findings with analytical calculations for a set of related quantities, the participation entropies in the computational (or Fock) basis, for which we derive an exact formula. We also investigate the time evolution of magic in a random unitary circuit with Gaussian gates, observing that it converges in a time that scales logarithmically with the system size. Applying the sampling algorithm to a two-dimensional free-fermionic topological model, we uncover a sharp transition in magic at the phase boundaries, highlighting the power of our approach in exploring different phases of quantum many-body systems, even in higher dimensions.

Title: Physics-based battery model parametrisation from impedance data
Authors: Noël Hallemans, Nicola E. Courtier, Colin P. Please, Brady Planden, Rishit Dhoot, Robert Timms, S. Jon chapman, David Howey, Stephen R. Duncan
Abstract: Non-invasive parametrisation of physics-based battery models can be performed by fitting the model to electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data containing features related to the different physical processes. However, this requires an impedance model to be derived, which may be complex to obtain analytically. We have developed the open-source software PyBaMM-EIS that provides a fast method to compute the impedance of any PyBaMM model at any operating point using automatic differentiation. Using PyBaMM-EIS, we investigate the impedance of the single particle model, single particle model with electrolyte (SPMe), and Doyle-Fuller-Newman model, and identify the SPMe as a parsimonious option that shows the typical features of measured lithium-ion cell impedance data. We provide a grouped parameter SPMe and analyse the features in the impedance related to each parameter. Using the open-source software PyBOP, we estimate 18 grouped parameters both from simulated impedance data and from measured impedance data from a LG M50LT lithium-ion battery. The parameters that directly affect the response of the SPMe can be accurately determined and assigned to the correct electrode. Crucially, parameter fitting must be done simultaneously to data across a wide range of states-of-charge. Overall, this work presents a practical way to find the parameters of physics-based models.

Title: Flowery Horizons & Bulk Observers: $sl^{(q)}(2,\mathbb{R})$ Drive in $2d$ Holographic CFT
Authors: Jayashish Das, Arnab Kundu
Abstract: We explore and analyze bulk geometric aspects corresponding to a driven two-dimensional holographic CFT, where the drive Hamiltonian is constructed from the $sl^{(q)}(2,\mathbb{R})$ generators. In particular, we demonstrate that starting with a thermal initial state, the evolution of the event horizon is characterized by distinct geometric transformations in the bulk which are associated to the conjugacy classes of the corresponding transformations on the CFT. Namely, the bulk evolution of the horizon is geometrically classified into an oscillatory (non-heating) behaviour, an exponentially growing (heating) behaviour and a power-law growth with an angular rotation (the phase boundary), all as a function of the stroboscopic time. We also show that the explicit symmetry breaking of the drive is manifest in a flowery structure of the event horizon that displays a $U(1) \to {\mathbb Z}_q$ symmetry breaking. In the $q\to \infty$ limit, the $U(1)$ symmetry is effectively restored. Furthermore, by analyzing the integral curves generated by the asymptotic Killing vectors, we also demonstrate how the fixed points of these curves approximate a bulk Ryu-Takayanagi surface corresponding to a modular Hamiltonian for a sub-region in the CFT. Since the CFT modular Hamiltonian has an infinitely many in-equivalent extensions in the bulk, the fixed points of the integral curves can also lie outside the entanglement wedge of the CFT sub-region.

Title: Wilsonian renormalisation group and thermal field theory in the Schwinger-Keldysh closed-time-path formalism
Authors: Giorgio Frangi, Sašo Grozdanov
Abstract: We study perturbative Wilsonian renormalisation group (RG) for the scalar $\phi^4$ theory at finite temperature to one loop order in the Schwinger-Keldysh closed-time-path (CTP) formalism. By explicitly integrating out the UV modes, we show how effective interactions coupling the two branches of the CTP contour arise. This provides a microscopic derivation of the type of effective CTP actions used in the literature. While the full effective theory has no critical points, we instead proceed to study critical properties of the RG flow in a reduced space of complex couplings that characterise certain time-ordered correlators and show the existence of two novel fixed points in $d=4$ spacetime dimensions. We relate one to the Wilson-Fisher fixed point known to exist only in $4-\epsilon$ dimensions, and the other to the standard Gaussian fixed point.

Title: Space-Time-Coupled Qubits for Enhanced Superconducting Quantum Computing
Authors: Sajjad Taravati
Abstract: The pursuit of scalable and robust quantum computing necessitates innovative approaches to overcome the inherent challenges of qubit connectivity, decoherence, and susceptibility to noise and crosstalk. Conventional monochromatic qubit coupling architectures, constrained by nearest-neighbor interactions and limited algorithmic flexibility, exacerbate these issues, hindering the realization of practical large-scale quantum processors. In this work, we introduce a paradigm leveraging a space-time-modulated cryogenic-compatible Josephson metasurface to enable polychromatic qubit coupling. This metasurface facilitates frequency-selective interactions, transforming nearest-neighbor connectivity into all-to-all qubit interactions, while significantly enhancing coherence, noise robustness, and entanglement fidelity. Our proposed approach capitalizes on the unique capabilities of space-time-modulated Josephson metasurfaces, including dynamic four-dimensional wave manipulation, nonreciprocal state transmission, and state-frequency conversion, to mediate multi-frequency qubit interactions. By isolating qubit couplings into distinct spectral channels, the cryogenic-compatible metasurface mitigates crosstalk and environmental decoherence, extending coherence times and preserving quantum state fidelity. Full-wave simulations and quantum performance analyses demonstrate a significant enhancement in the operational efficiency of a superconducting qubit array, showcasing improved connectivity, robustness, and entanglement stability. This study establishes the potential of space-time-modulated cryogenic-compatible Josephson metasurfaces as a transformative platform for next-generation quantum computing, addressing critical bottlenecks and paving the way for scalable, high-performance quantum processors.
