Title: Maze-Bubble Pattern Magnetic Domain Simulation Based on the Lengyel-Epstein Model
Authors: Yufei Bai
Abstract: This study is based on the Lengyel-Epstein (LE) model, governed by a system of nonlinear partial differential equations, to simulate the maze-bubble pattern magnetic domains in magnetic thin films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). Through numerical simulations, we successfully reproduce the maze, bubble, and intermediate-state magnetic domains observed in PMA multilayer films under the influence of material thickness and external magnetic fields. The topological structures of the magnetic domains shown in the simulation closely resemble those observed under a microscope, demonstrating the effectiveness of the LE model in simulating changes in the magnetic domain topology of magnetic thin films. This study also innovatively applies the concept of reaction-diffusion, commonly used in biochemistry, by drawing an analogy to electromagnetism. This approach holds significant implications for the study of magnetic domains.

Title: Ensemble Inequivalence in long range interacting spin systems
Authors: Daniel Arrufat-Vicente, David Mukamel, Stefano Ruffo, Nicolo Defenu
Abstract: Ensemble inequivalence occurs when a systems thermodynamic properties vary depending on the statistical ensemble used to describe it. This phenomenon is known to happen in systems with long-range interactions and has been observed in many classical systems. In this study, we provide a detailed analysis of a long-range quantum ferromagnet spin model that exhibits ensemble inequivalence. At zero temperature ($T = 0$), the microcanonical phase diagram matches that of the canonical ensemble. However, the two ensembles yield different phase diagrams at finite temperatures. This behavior contrasts with the conventional understanding in statistical mechanics of systems with short-range interactions, where thermodynamic properties are expected to align across different ensembles in the thermodynamic limit. We discuss the implications of these findings for synthetic quantum long-range platforms, such as atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) systems.

Title: Edge-prompted spin waves probed via magneto-optical effect in the infrared
Authors: Junming Wu, Dinesh Wagle, Yuzan Xiong, Andrew Christy, Yi Li, Shihao Zhou, James F. Cahoon, Xufeng Zhang, M. Benjamin Jungfleisch, Wei Zhang
Abstract: Recent advances in magnonics highlight the need for employing spin wave characteristics as new state variables, which is to be detected and mapped out with high precision in all-onchip, small scale devices. Spin wave modes that are prompted by the sample edges in planar structures are of particular fundamental importance to the future design and characterization of magnonic device functionalities. In this work, we demonstrate an infrared light-based, magneto-optical technique that concurrently functions both as a spectroscopic and an imaging tool. The detected precessional phase contrast can be directly used to construct the map of the spin wave wavefront in the continuous wave regime of spin-wave propagation and in the stationary state, without needing any optical reference path. We experimentally detect the edge spin wave modes of a Y3Fe5O12 film sample, and study the evolution and interference from edge dominated modes to their bulk counterparts. Distinct wavevector groups and propagation characteristics are observed for the edge and bulk spin wave modes. Further, the magnon dispersion relation in the infrared is obtained by Fourier transforming the wavefronts measured in real space, which is a huge advantage to the wavevector-resolved Brillouin light scattering (BLS) technique, where the angle of incidence has to be varied, and is also much less cumbersome than the phase-resolved BLS. Our results demonstrate that the infrared optical strobe light can serve as a versatile platform for magneto-optical probing of magnetization dynamics, with potential implications in investigating hybrid magnonic systems.

Title: Micromagnetic-atomistic hybrid modeling of defect-induced magnetization dynamics
Authors: Nastaran Salehi, Olle Eriksson, Johan Hellsvik, Manuel Pereiro
Abstract: This study presents a multiscale approach for investigating magnetization dynamics in multiscale, hybrid micromagnetic-atomistic simulations. We considered the dynamics of spin waves, domain walls, as well as three-dimensional (3D) skyrmions, in the presence of defects. Two primary defect configurations are examined: (i) a double-slit structure, which enables the study of domain wall and spin wave interference, and (ii) a tetrahedron shaped cluster of atoms with tunable anisotropy, which provides insights into how localized anisotropic perturbations influence domain wall pinning and skyrmion stability. The magnonic double-slit experiment demonstrates interference patterns analogous to electronic wave phenomena, offering potential applications in wave-based computing. Additionally, the results reveal the impact of the local anisotropy that leads to distinct transformations, including domain wall deformations, tubular and spherical structures, skyrmion annihilation, and breathing mode. The findings underscore the critical role of defect-induced anisotropic interactions in controlling domain wall motion, skyrmion topology, and spin wave propagation.

Title: Kinetic analysis of phase transformations during continuous heating: Crystallization of glass-forming liquids
Authors: Owain S. Houghton
Abstract: Phase transformations are widely studied using continuous-heating experiments. In isothermal studies, their kinetics are often described using the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov (JMAK) rate equation. For continuous-heating studies, the same analysis has only been applied numerically. Here, a JMAK rate equation for phase transformations during continuous heating is derived. The equation is applied to the crystallization of glass-forming liquids with different kinetic behaviors and validated by comparison to experimental data and numerical simulations for the crystallization of glassy $\rm Fe_{80}B_{20}$ (at.%). Kissinger's method of analyzing crystallization kinetics is subsequently justified, and it is shown that the non-Arrhenius temperature dependence of crystal growth rates in glass-forming liquids can be better determined by using the present model to fit the peak position, shape and height for a series of crystallization exotherms. The implications of these analytical expressions for the design and development of glass-forming systems for a broad range of applications are considered, and the application of this JMAK rate equation to other transformations during continuous heating is explored.

Title: Modulation doping and control the carrier concentration in 2-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides
Authors: Nikhil Sivadas, Yongwoo Shin
Abstract: Two-dimensional transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have attracted interest as post-Si channel candidates in transistor technology. However, despite their potential benefits, controllably doping TMDs has proven difficult. In this work, we proposed a list of candidate elements that can induce p-type and n-type doping in the TMD channel when they are doped onto conventional gate-dielectric oxides. To verify the screened modulation doping candidates, we demonstrate using first-principles calculations the p-doping of monolayer WSe$_2$ by doping Ni int\textbf{}o the interface dielectric HfO$_2$ layer. The induced hole concentration in the WSe$_2$ can be tuned to values compatible with electrostatic gate control of the channel by changing the Ni doping rate. The results of this study will have essential implications for the commercial viability of TMD-based transistors.

Title: Interfacial Effects and Negative Capacitance State in P(VDF-TrFE) Films with BaTiO3 Nanoparticles
Authors: Oleksii V. Bereznykov, Oleksandr S. Pylypchuk, Victor I. Styopkin, Serhii E. Ivanchenko, Denis O. Stetsenko, Eugene A. Eliseev, Zdravko Kutnjak, Vladimir N. Poroshin, Anna N. Morozovska, Nicholas V. Morozovsky
Abstract: We analyze the temperature dependences of the effective dielectric permittivity of P(VDF-TrFE) films with BaTiO3 nanoparticles (with the average size 24 nm). Transition from a weak to a strong nonlinear temperature dependence of the dielectric permittivity is observed near the freezing temperature (near -50 °C) of P(VDF-TrFE). The transition is followed by a diffuse step-like change in the temperature range (0 - 40)°C, and a subsequent maximum of the dielectric permittivity in the P(VDF-TrFE) films with a lower content (~20-40 vol.%) of BaTiO3 nanoparticles; or by a quasi-plateau of the dielectric permittivity in the P(VDF-TrFE) films with a higher content (~ 50-70 vol.%) of BaTiO3 nanoparticles. The frequency dispersion of the dielectric permittivity is significant in the vicinity of its maxima. The temperature-frequency shift of the permittivity region with a strong temperature dependence is positive. The temperature-frequency shift of the maxima is insignificant (or negative) for the P(VDF-TrFE) films with lower content of BaTiO3 nanoparticles. Increasing the content of BaTiO3 nanoparticles leads to a significant increase in the relative dielectric permittivity of the P(VDF-TrFE)-BaTiO3 films compared to pure P(VDF-TrFE) films (from 8 to 50 at 25 °C). At the same time, the voltage response of the studied P(VDF-TrFE)/BaTiO3 films to the frequency-modulated IR radiation flux has rather photoelectric than pyroelectric nature. A phenomenological model, which considers the screening charges at the interfaces, as well as dipole-dipole cross-interaction effects between the ferroelectric nanoparticles, is proposed to describe the temperature and frequency behavior of the effective dielectric permittivity. The negative capacitance state, which originates due to the interfacial effects, is predicted in the P(VDF-TrFE) films with a high content of BaTiO3 nanoparticles.

Abstract: Generative models and machine learning promise accelerated material discovery in MOFs for CO2 capture and water harvesting but face significant challenges navigating vast chemical spaces while ensuring synthetizability. Here, we present MOFGen, a system of Agentic AI comprising interconnected agents: a large language model that proposes novel MOF compositions, a diffusion model that generates crystal structures, quantum mechanical agents that optimize and filter candidates, and synthetic-feasibility agents guided by expert rules and machine learning. Trained on all experimentally reported MOFs and computational databases, MOFGen generated hundreds of thousands of novel MOF structures and synthesizable organic linkers. Our methodology was validated through high-throughput experiments and the successful synthesis of five "AI-dreamt" MOFs, representing a major step toward automated synthesizable material discovery.

Title: Charge Densities in Crystals and Triply-Periodic Minimal Surfaces
Authors: Mengdi Yin, Dimitri D. Vvedensky
Abstract: The relationship between surfaces of constant charge density and triply-periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS) has been the subject of considerable speculation over many years. Zero-potential surfaces generated in crystals by an electrostatic field from a distribution of point charges provide an approximate description of the TPMS for that crystal. We have recently provided a first-principles alternative to such phenomenological comparisons based on the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP). We showed that the surfaces of a zero charge density calculated for the crystal structure of a material converges to the TPMS of the corresponding crystalline material. The exchange-correlation potentials are chosen for the particular material based on the benchmarking of various approximations for these potentials carried out by others. Here, we report an extension of our previous work by giving additional examples of our theory that shows the zero electron density of an equilibrium structure corresponds to a TPMS for a variety of materials and crystalline structures. We study the ground states of elemental materials that differ electronically and structurally, Na, Cu, Al, Zr, and a compound, NiTi, as well as different phases of the elemental solids that are observed under different thermodynamic conditions.

Title: Probing Loop Currents and Collective Modes of Charge Density Waves in Kagome Materials with NV Centers
Authors: Ying-Ming Xie, Naoto Nagaosa
Abstract: Recently, the unconventional charge density wave (CDW) order with loop currents has attracted considerable attention in the Kagome material family AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A = K, Rb, Cs). However, experimental signatures of loop current order remain elusive. In this work, based on the mean-field free energy, we analyze the collective modes of unconventional CDW order in a Kagome lattice model. Furthermore, we point out that phase modes in the imaginary CDW (iCDW) order with loop current orders result in time-dependent stray fields. We thus propose using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers to detect these time-dependent stray fields, providing a potential experimental approach to identifying loop current order.

Title: General Phase Segregation and Phase Pinning Effects in Ln-doped Lead Halide Perovskite with Dual-wavelength Lasing
Authors: Junyu He, Jun Luo, Weihao Zheng, Biyuan Zheng, Mengjian Zhu, Jiahao Liu, Tingzhao Fu, Jing Wu, Zhihong Zhu, Fang Wang, Xiujuan Zhuang
Abstract: Lead halide perovskites (LHPs) exhibit outstanding optoelectronic properties, making them highly promising for applications in various optoelectronics devices. However, rapid ion migration in LHPs not only undermines device stability but also hinders the development of multi-band composite structures, which are crucial to advancing perovskite bandgap engineering and unlocking novel applications. Here, we introduce a novel and general strategy involving both phase segregation and phase pinning by doping Er$^{3+}$ into CsPb(X$_x$Y$_{1-x}$)$_3$ (X, Y = Cl, Br, I) microplates via a simple one-step chemical vapor deposition method. The ion migration is effectively suppressed and a variety of stable multi-band composite structures are demonstrated, with diverse dual-band photoluminescence emissions covering the red, green, and blue spectral bands. The corresponding high-performance dual-wavelength lasers have also been fabricated, confirming the stability and high crystalline quality of these multi-band composite structures. In addition, this strategy is extended to the doping of various lanthanide ion and the incorporation of different mixed halides into LHPs. As a result, a series of multi-band composite structures based on LHPs and corresponding dual-wavelength lasers are developed, thereby validating the generality of this strategy. Theoretical calculations clarify the phase segregation and phase pinning mechanism in these LHPs. Our work not only facilitates the stability design of LHPs but also significantly advances the bandgap engineering, thereby contributing to the expansion of their potential applications in the optoelectronic future.

Title: Retrieval of fundamental material parameters of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides from experimental exciton energies: An analytical approach
Authors: Duy-Nhat Ly, Dai-Nam Le, Dang-Khoa D. Le, Van-Hoang Le
Abstract: We propose a straightforward and highly accurate method for determining material parameters such as screening length, bandgap energy, exciton reduced mass, and dielectric constant of the surrounding medium using experimental magnetoexciton energies available for monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). Our approach is based on analytical formulations that allow us to calculate the screening length $r_0$ and bandgap energy $E_g$ directly from the experimental $s$-state exciton energies $E_{1s}$, $E_{2s}$, and $E_{3s}$. We also establish a relationship between the surrounding dielectric constant $\kappa$ and the exciton reduced mass $\mu$. This relationship simplifies the Schr{ö}dinger equation for a magnetoexciton in a TMDC monolayer, transforming it into a one-parameter equation that depends only on a single material parameter, $\mu$. Therefore, the fitting method is easy to implement, as it compares calculated magnetoexciton energies with experimental data to determine the true exciton reduced mass, the best-fit value of $\mu$. By applying this method, we extract material parameters $E_g$, $r_0$, $\mu$, and $\kappa$ from the magnetoexciton energies of monolayer TMDCs (WSe$_2$, WS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, and MoS$_2$) encapsulated by hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) slabs in various current experiments. Additionally, we provide key material properties such as diamagnetic coefficients and exciton radii, which are calculated using the extracted parameters.

Title: Bacteria exploit torque-induced buckling instability for flagellar wrapping
Authors: Takuro Kataoka, Taiju Yoneda, Daisuke Nakane, Hirofumi Wada
Abstract: Recent advances in microscopy techniques has uncovered unique aspects of flagella-driven motility in bacteria. A remarkable example is the discovery of flagellar wrapping, a phenomenon whereby a bacterium wraps its flagellum (or flagellar bundle) around its cell body and propels itself like a corkscrew, enabling locomotion in highly viscous or confined environments. For certain bacterial species, this flagellar-wrapping mode is crucial for establishing selective symbiotic relationships with their hosts. The transformation of a flagellum from an extended to a folded (wrapped) state is triggered by a buckling instability driven by the motor-generated torque that unwinds the helical filament. This study investigated this biologically inspired, novel buckling mechanism through a combination of macroscale physical experiments, numerical simulations, and scaling theory to reveal its underlying physical principles. Excellent quantitative agreement between experiments and numerical results showed that long-range hydrodynamic interactions (HIs) are essential for accurate quantitative descriptions of the geometrically nonlinear deformation of the helical filament during wrapping. By systematically analyzing extensive experimental and numerical data, we constructed a stability diagram that rationalized the stability boundary through an elastohydrodynamic scaling analysis. Leveraging the scaling nature of this study, we compared our physical results with available biological data and demonstrated that bacteria exploit motor-induced buckling instability to initiate their flagellar wrapping. Our findings indicate that this mechanically-driven process is essential to bacterial-wrapping motility and consequently, plays a critical role in symbiosis and infection.

Title: Fabrication and characterization of boron-terminated tetravacancies in monolayer hBN using STEM, EELS and electron ptychography
Authors: Dana O. Byrne, Stephanie M. Ribet, Demie Kepaptsoglou, Quentin M. Ramasse, Colin Ophus, Frances I. Allen
Abstract: Tetravacancies in monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) with consistent edge termination (boron or nitrogen) form triangular nanopores with electrostatic potentials that can be leveraged for applications such as selective ion transport and neuromorphic computing. In order to quantitatively predict the properties of these structures, an atomic-level understanding of their local electronic and chemical environments is required. Moreover, robust methods for their precision manufacture are needed. Here were use electron irradiation in a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) at high dose rate to drive the formation of boron-terminated tetravacancies in monolayer hBN. Characterization of the defects is achieved using aberration-corrected STEM, monochromated electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS), and electron ptychography. Z-contrast in STEM and chemical fingerprinting by core-loss EELS enable identification of the edge terminations, while electron ptychography gives insight into structural relaxation of the tetravacancies and provides evidence of enhanced electron density around the defect perimeters indicative of bonding effects.

Title: Bulk photogalvanic current control and gap spectroscopy in 2D hexagonal materials
Authors: Anna Galler, Ofer Neufeld
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal materials have been intensively explored for multiple optoelectronic applications such as spin current generation, all-optical valleytronics, and topological electronics. In the realm of strong-field and ultrafast light-driven phenomena, it was shown that tailored laser driving such as polychromatic or few-cycle pulses can drive robust bulk photogalvanic (BPG) currents originating from the K/K' valleys. We here explore the BPG effect in 2D systems in the strong-field regime and show that monochromatic elliptical pulses also generically generate such photocurrents. The resultant photocurrents exhibit both parallel and transverse (Hall-like) components, both highly sensitive to the laser parameters, providing photocurrent control knobs. Interestingly, we show that the photocurrent amplitude has a distinct behavior vs. the driving ellipticity that can be indicative of material properties such as the gap size at K/K', which should prove useful for novel forms of BPG-based spectroscopies. We demonstrate these effects also in benchmark ab-initio simulations in monolayer hexagonal boron-nitride. Our work establishes new paths for controlling photocurrent responses in 2D systems that can also be used for multi-dimensional spectroscopy of ultrafast material properties through photocurrent measurements.

Title: Wave characteristics and anisotropic homogenization theory of soft matters layered structure
Authors: Rui.Guo, Kai Zhang, Nicholas X. Fang
Abstract: We investigate in this work the wave characteristics and homogenization theory of soft matter layered structure in the limit of low-frequency P-wave. Using the method of potentials, we derive closed-form dispersion relationship and identify three distinct modes of the soft matter layered structure: quasistatic mode, resonance mode, and slip mode. These modes differ based on their equivalent interface conditions: a continuous interface for quasistatic mode, a spring-like interface for resonance mode, and a slip like interface for slip mode. Additionally, we propose a simplified model capturing P-wave wave characteristics in the S-wave high-frequency regime. Our findings unify wave-structure relationships across solid, liquid, and soft matter composites, offering a predictive framework for engineering metamaterials with programmable wave responses. This study offers new insight on the fundamental understanding of layered media and providing direct design principles for applications in acoustic cloaking, vibration damping, and biomedical imaging.

Title: Dichotomy theorem distinguishing non-integrability and the lowest-order Yang-Baxter equation for isotropic spin chains
Authors: Naoto Shiraishi, Mizuki Yamaguchi
Abstract: We investigate the integrability and non-integrability of isotropic spin chains with nearest-neighbor interaction with general spin $S$. We prove a dichotomy theorem that a single relation sharply separates two scenarios: (i) this system is non-integrable, or (ii) the lowest-order Yang-Baxter equation is satisfied. This result solves in the affirmative the Grabowski-Mathieu conjecture stating that a model is integrable only if this model has a 3-local conserved quantity. This theorem also serves as a complete classification of integrability and non-integrability for $S\leq 13.5$, suggesting that all the integrable models are in the scope of the Yang-Baxter equation.

Title: The Role of Flexoelectric Coupling and Chemical Strains in the Emergence of Polar Chiral Nano-Structures
Authors: Anna N. Morozovska, Salia Cherifi-Hertel, Eugene A. Eliseev, Victoria V. Khist, Riccardo Hertel, Dean R. Evans
Abstract: This review examines the conditions that lead to the formation of flexo-sensitive chiral polar structures in thin films and core-shell ferroelectric nanoparticles. It also analyzes possible mechanisms by which the flexoelectric effect impacts the polarization structure in core-shell ferroelectric nanoparticles. Special attention is given to the role of the anisotropic flexoelectric effect in forming a unique type of polarization states with distinct chiral properties, referred to as "flexons". In the first part of the review, we study the influence of the flexoelectric coupling on the polarity, chirality and branching of metastable labyrinthine domain structures in uniaxial ferroelectric core-shell nanoparticles. We reveal that the transition from sinuous branched domain stripes to spiral-like domains occurs gradually as the flexoelectric coupling strength is increased. Our findings indicate that the joint action of flexoelectric effect and chemical strains, termed as "flexo-chemical" coupling, can significantly influence the effective Curie temperature, polarization distribution, domain morphology, and chirality in multiaxial ferroelectric core-shell nanoparticles. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the combination of flexo-chemical coupling and screening effects leads to the appearance and stabilization of a chiral polarization morphology in nanoflakes of van der Waals ferrielectrics. In the second part of the review, we discuss several advanced applications of flexo-sensitive chiral polar structures in core-shell ferroelectric nanoparticles for nanoelectronics elements and cryptography. We underline the possibilities of the flexoelectric control of multiple-degenerated labyrinthine states, which may correspond to a differential negative capacitance (NC) state stabilized in the uniaxial ferroelectric core by the presence of a screening shell.

Title: General trends of electronic structures, superconducting pairing, and magnetic correlations in the Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate $m$-layered superconductors La$_{m+1}$Ni$_{m}$O$_{3m+1}$
Authors: Yang Zhang, Ling-Fang Lin, Adriana Moreo, Satoshi Okamoto, Thomas A. Maier, Elbio Dagotto
Abstract: We report a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the Ruddlesden-Popper layered nickelates La$_{m+1}$Ni$_m$O$_{3m+1}$ ($m = 1$ to 6) under pressure. Our results suggest that, while these Ruddlesden-Popper layered nickelates display many similarities, they also show noticeable differences. The Ni $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals display bonding-antibonding, or bonding-antibonding-nonbonding, characteristic splittings, depending on the even or odd number of stacking layers $m$. In addition, the ratio of the in-plane interorbital hopping between $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals and in-plane intraorbital hopping between $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals was found to be large in La$_{m+1}$Ni$_m$O$_{3m+1}$ ($m = 1$ to 6), and this ratio increases from $m = 1$ to $m = 6$, suggesting that the in-plane hybridization will increase as the layer number $m$ increases. In contrast to the dominant $s^\pm$--wave state driven by spin fluctuations in the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, two nearly degenerate $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave and $s^\pm$-wave leading states were obtained in the four-layer stacking La$_5$Ni$_4$O$_{13}$ and five-layer stacking La$_6$Ni$_5$O$_{16}$. The leading $s^\pm$-wave state was recovered in the six-layer material La$_7$Ni$_6$O$_{19}$. In general, at the level of the random phase approximation treatment, the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ decreases in stoichiometric bulk systems from the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ to the six-layer La$_7$Ni$_6$O$_{19}$, despite the $m$ dependent dominant pairing. Both in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic correlations are found to be quite complex. Within the in-plane direction, we obtained the peak of the magnetic susceptibility at ${\bf q} = (0.6 \pi, 0.6 \pi)$ for La$_5$Ni$_4$O$_{13}$ and La$_7$Ni$_6$O$_{19}$, and at ${\bf q} = (0.7 \pi, 0.7 \pi)$ for La$_6$Ni$_5$O$_{16}$.

Abstract: Structural and mechanical properties of B12-based orthorhombic metal carboborides are studied on the basis of first principle DFT approach. The simulations predict the existence of a new family of phases of the composition MeC2B12 (Me=Mg, Ca, Sr, Sc, Y) with similar structure and space symmetry Imma. It has been found that the predicted phases are thermally (dynamically) stable and have considerably better mechanical properties as compared to the reference compound AlMgB14. The respective calculated isotropic elastic moduli and Vickers hardness are significantly higher (G~ 230-250, E~530-550, and Hv~35-55 GPa). These conclusions were confirmed by direct calculations of shear strength for the above phases, which demonstrated the increase of 30-50% in different directions. The enhanced mechanical characteristics of the MgC2B12 -based phases make them promising for creating novel superhard materials

Title: Real Space Visualization of Order-Disorder Transition in BaTiO3
Authors: Yang Zhang, Xiaoming Shi, Suk Hyun Sung, Cong Li, Houbing Huang, Pu Yu, Ismail El Baggari
Abstract: Ferroelectricity in BaTiO3 was observed nearly eighty years ago, but the mechanism underlying its ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition remains elusive. The order-disorder transition has been recognized as playing a critical role, however, the precise nature of the order parameter still remains under scrutiny, including the local dipole direction and the correlations above and below the Curie temperature. Using in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy, we directly map polar displacements in BaTiO3 across the ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition, providing atomistic insights into a order-disorder mechanism. Atomic tracking reveals finite polar Ti displacements in the paraelectric phase where they manifest as random polar nanoregions. The displacements align along <111> direction in both the ferroelectric and paraelectric phases. The paraelectric-ferroelectric transition emerges from real-space correlations of the <111> polar Ti displacements. Our direct visualizations provides atomic insights into the order-disorder mechanism in the ferroelectric-paraelectric transition of BaTiO3.

Title: Machine learning enhanced atom probe tomography analysis: a snapshot review
Authors: Yue Li, Ye Wei, Alaukik Saxena, Markus Kühbach, Christoph Freysoldt, Baptiste Gault
Abstract: Atom probe tomography (APT) is a burgeoning characterization technique that provides compositional mapping of materials in three-dimensions at near-atomic scale. Since its significant expansion in the past 30 years, we estimate that one million APT datasets have been collected, each containing millions to billions of individual ions. Their analysis and the extraction of microstructural information has largely relied upon individual users whose varied level of expertise causes clear and documented bias. Current practices hinder efficient data processing, and make challenging standardization and the deployment of data analysis workflows that would be compliant with FAIR data principles. Over the past decade, building upon the long-standing expertise of the APT community in the development of advanced data processing or data mining techniques, there has been a surge of novel machine learning (ML) approaches aiming for user-independence, and that are efficient, reproducible, and robust from a statistics perspective. Here, we provide a snapshot review of this rapidly evolving field. We begin with a brief introduction to APT and the nature of the APT data. This is followed by an overview of relevant ML algorithms and a comprehensive review of their applications to APT. We also discuss how ML can enable discoveries beyond human capability, offering new insights into the mechanisms within materials. Finally, we provide guidance for future directions in this domain.

Title: $Σ$-Attention: A Transformer-based operator learning framework for self-energy in strongly correlated systems
Authors: Yuanran Zhu, Peter Rosenberg, Zhen Huang, Hardeep Bassi, Chao Yang, Shiwei Zhang
Abstract: We introduce $\Sigma$-Attention, a Transformer-based operator-learning framework to address a key computational challenge in correlated materials. Our approach utilizes an Encoder-Only Transformer as an ansatz to approximate the self-energy operator of strongly correlated electronic systems. By creating a batched dataset that combines results from three complementary approaches: many-body perturbation theory, strong-coupling expansion, and exact diagonalization, each effective in specific parameter regimes, $\Sigma$-Attention is applied to learn a universal approximation for the self-energy operator that is valid across all regimes. This hybrid strategy leverages the strengths of existing methods while relying on the transformer's ability to generalize beyond individual limitations. More importantly, the scalability of the Transformer architecture allows the learned self-energy to be extended to systems with larger sizes, leading to much improved computational scaling. Using the 1D Hubbard model, we demonstrate that $\Sigma$-Attention can accurately predict the Matsubara Green's function and hence effectively captures the Mott transition at finite temperature. Our framework offers a promising and scalable pathway for studying strongly correlated systems with many possible generalizations.

Title: Quantum tomography of the superfluid-insulator transition for a mesoscopic atomtronic ring
Authors: Yehoshua Winsten, Doron Cohen
Abstract: We provide a phase-space perspective for the analysis of the superfluid-insulator transition for finite-size Bose-Hubbard circuits. We explore how the eigenstates parametrically evolve as the inter-particle interaction is varied, paying attention to the fingerprints of chaos at the quantum phase-transition. Consequently, we demonstrate that the tomographic spectrum reflects the existence of mixed-regions of chaos and quasi-regular motion in phase-space. This tomographic semiclassical approach is much more efficient and informative compared to the traditional ``level statistics" inspection. Of particular interest is the characterization of the fluctuations that are exhibited by the many-body eigenstates. In this context, we associate with each eigenstate a Higgs measure for the identification of amplitude modes of the order-parameter. Finally we focus on the formation of the lowest Goldstone and Higgs bands.

Title: Multifractional Brownian motion with telegraphic, stochastically varying exponent
Authors: Michał Balcerek, Samudrajit Thapa, Krzysztof Burnecki, Holger Kantz, Ralf Metzler, Agnieszka Wyłomańska, Aleksei Chechkin
Abstract: The diversity of diffusive systems exhibiting long-range correlations characterized by a stochastically varying Hurst exponent calls for a generic multifractional model. We present a simple, analytically tractable model which fills the gap between mathematical formulations of multifractional Brownian motion and empirical studies. In our model, called telegraphic multifractional Brownian motion, the Hurst exponent is modelled by a smoothed telegraph process which results in a stationary beta distribution of exponents as observed in biological experiments. We also provide a methodology to identify our model in experimental data and present concrete examples from biology, climate and finance to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.

Abstract: The fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect remains a captivating area in condensed matter physics, characterized by strongly correlated topological order, fractionalized excitations, and anyonic statistics. Numerical simulations, such as exact diagonalization, density matrix renormalization group, matrix product states, and Monte Carlo methods, are essential to examine the properties of strongly correlated systems. Recently, density functional theory (DFT) has been employed in this field within the framework of composite fermion (CF) theory. In this paper, we assess how DFT addresses major challenges in FQH system, such as computing ground state and low-energy excitations. We emphasize the critical insights provided by DFT-based methods into the CF model, edge effects, and the nature of fractional charge and magnetoroton excitations. Furthermore, we examine the advantages and limitations of DFT approaches, highlight the interplay between numerical simulations and theoretical models. We finally discuss the future potential of time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) for modeling non-equilibrium dynamics.

Title: Unconventional magnetism in spin-orbit coupled systems
Authors: Jian-Keng Yuan, Zhiming Pan, Congjun Wu
Abstract: ``Unconventional magnetism" was proposed to describe the exotic states arising from Landau-Pomeranchuk instabilities in the spin channel nearly two decades ago. Its odd-partial-wave-channel (e.g. $p$-wave) states break parity giving rise to the dynamic generation of spin-orbit coupling, while its even-partial-wave-channel (e.g. $d$-wave) states break time-reversal symmetry. Both types of states can exhibit collinear and non-collinear spin configurations over Fermi surfaces with the former and latter termed as the $\alpha$ and $\beta$-phases, respectively. The collinear states in even partial-wave channels are in the same symmetry class of ``altermagnetism". In this work, we investigate unconventional magnetism in both $p$- and $d$-wave channels within spin-orbit coupled systems with parity and time-reversal symmetries maintained. Based on the Ginzburg-Landau free energy analysis, the $p$-wave channel yields the gyrotropic, Rashba, Dresselhaus-type spin-orbit couplings. They compete and mix evolving from the $\beta$-phase to the $\alpha$-phase with various types of spin-momentum lockings. Analyses are performed in parallel for the $d$-wave unconventional magnetism. We emphasize that the single-particle dispersion is not sufficient to justify the spin-group type symmetry of the full Hamiltonian. Furthermore, Goldstone manifolds and excitations are examined in each unconventional magnetic phase.

Title: Non-Equilibrium Probing of Topological Supersolids in Spin-Orbit-Coupled Dipolar Condensates
Authors: Biao Dong, Xiao-Fei Zhang, Wei Han, Renyuan Liao, Xue-Ying Yang, Wu-Ming Liu, Yong-Chang Zhang
Abstract: A chiral supersolid is a quantum phase that simultaneously exhibits crystalline order, superfluidity, and topological spin texture, with spontaneously broken translational, U(1) gauge, and chiral symmetries. Here, we demonstrate a chiral supersolid with tunable non-equilibrium dynamics in a spin-orbit coupled dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate. By adjusting dipolar interaction and spin-orbit coupling, we uncover two distinct quantum phase transitions: (i) a first-order transition from a single skyrmion superfluid to a triangular meron supersolid, and (ii) a second-order transition from this superfluid to a square skyrmion supersolid. These phases are characterized by their lattice symmetries, nonclassical rotational inertia, and spin textures. Under parity-time symmetric dissipation, we predict phase-dependent damping of the current oscillations, directly linked to the superfluid fraction. The predicted chiral supersolid phase can be experimentally observed in ultracold magnetic atoms with spin-orbit coupling. Our results establish dipolar quantum gases as a platform for designing topological matter with spintronic functionality.

Title: Manipulation of anisotropic Zhang-Rice exciton in van der Waals antiferromagnets NiPS3-xSex by anion substitution
Authors: Deepu Kumar, Joydev Khatua, Nguyen The Hoang, Yumin Sim, Rajesh Kumar Ulaganathan, Raju Kalaivanan, Raman Sankar, Maeng-Je Seong, Kwang-Yong Choi
Abstract: Spin-entangled excitons have emerged as intriguing quasi-particle excitations in van der Waals magnets. Among them, the recently observed Zhang-Rice (ZR) exciton in NiPS3 has garnered significant research interest due to its strong correlation with magnetic ordering and its exceptionally long-lived coherence. Herein, we present our in-depth temperature- and polarization-dependent photoluminescence (PL) study of anion-substituted NiPS3-xSex (x=0.008,0.03,0.06 and 0.09 ) to explore the nature and dynamics of the ZR exciton. Our results reveal that, similar to the cation substitution, a small percentage of anion substitution effectively destroys and modulates the ZR exciton, as evidenced by the emergence of a weaker, lower-energy PL peak in addition to the primary ZR peak. The primary and secondary PL peaks exhibit the same anisotropic polarization but differ in their peak energy shift and intensity evolution with Se substitution, suggesting varying charge transfers of p-orbitals. Notably, the ZR exciton undergoes rapid thermal destabilization at much lower temperatures than two-magnon excitations, highlighting that p-orbital inhomogeneity beyond the magnetic ordering structure is a decisive factor in driving its thermal quenching.

Title: Persistent Homology-Based Descriptor of Topological Ordering in Two-Dimensional Quasi-Particle Systems with Application to Skyrmion Lattices
Authors: Michiki Taniwaki, Thomas Brian Winkler, Jan Rothörl, Raphael Gruber, Chiharu Mitsumata, Masato Kotsugi, Mathias Kläui
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) quasi-particles systems, such as magnetic skyrmions, can exhibit a rich variety of topological phase transitions. However, the methodology for capturing the configurational properties of the lattice ordering and constructing an appropriate descriptor that can be easily calculated is not obvious. Here, we present a topological descriptor, "persistent diagram", and propose an indicator for topological phase transitions using persistent homology (PH). PH offers novel insights beyond conventional indicators by capturing topological features derived from the configurational properties of the lattice. The proposed persistent-homology-based topological indicator, which selectively counts stable features in the persistence diagram, effectively traces the lattice's topological changes, as confirmed by comparisons with the conventionally used measure of the ordering $\langle|\Psi_6|\rangle$, typically used to identify lattice phases. While our method is demonstrated in the context of skyrmion lattice systems, the approach is general and can be extended to other two-dimensional systems composed of repulsively interacting quasi-particles. Moreover, our indicator offers lower computational complexity than the conventionally used methods.

Title: Electromagnetic analysis of coated conductors with ferromagnetic substrates: Novel insights
Authors: Vladimir Sokolovsky, Leonid Prigozhin
Abstract: Ferromagnetic substrates can significantly influence the electromagnetic response of a coated conductor to an external magnetic field and transport current. This study analyzes this response theoretically using the thin shell integrodifferential model. First, assuming the substrate is strongly magnetic and the superconductor is in the Meissner state, we present the analytical solution in a convenient explicit form. This helps us to analyze the superconducting current density distributions, highlighting their differences from those in conductors with non-magnetic substrates. Secondly, for a superconducting layer characterized by a nonlinear current-voltage relation and a substrate with a finite field-independent magnetic permeability, we use an effective spectral numerical method to study the unique features of this hybrid superconductor/ferromagnet system, such as magnetization in a parallel external field and the peculiar nonmonotonic variation of loss observed when alternating transport current and parallel field are applied simultaneously. Dynamic losses for the case of a direct transport current and an alternating parallel field are also investigated. It is shown that tuning the phase and amplitude of the applied parallel field relative to those of the transport current can minimize AC losses.

Title: Long-lived Zone-boundary Magnons in an Antiferromagnet
Authors: Jeongheon Choe, David Lujan, Gaihua Ye, Cynthia Nnokwe, Bowen Ma, Jiaming He, Frank Y. Gao, T. Nathan Nunley, Aritz Leonardo, Mikel Arruabarrena, Andres Ayuela, Jianshi Zhou, Martin Rodriguez-Vega, Gregory A. Fiete, Rui He, Xiaoqin Li
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic (AFM) insulators exhibit many desirable features for spintronic applications such as fast dynamics in the THz range and robustness to fluctuating external fields. However, large damping typically associated with THz magnons presents a serious challenge for THz magnonic applications. Here, we report long-lived short-wavelength zone boundary magnons in the honeycomb AFM insulator CoTiO3, recently found to host topological magnons. We find that its zone-boundary THz magnons exhibit longer lifetimes than its zone-center magnons. This unusual momentum-dependent long magnon lifetime originates from several factors including the antiferromagnetic order, exchange anisotropy, a finite magnon gap, and magnon band dispersion. Our work suggests that magnon-magnon interaction may not be detrimental to magnon lifetimes and should be included in future searches for topological magnons.

Title: Bulk nanocrystalline Al-Mg-Y alloys with amorphous grain boundary complexions display high strength and compressive plasticity
Authors: Tianjiao Lei, Esther Hessong, Brandon Fields, Raphael Pierre Thiraux, Daniel S. Gianola, Timothy J. Rupert
Abstract: Although nanocrystalline alloys regularly exhibit high strengths, their use in structural applications often face challenges due to sample size limitations, unstable microstructures, and the limited ability to plastically deform. The incorporation of amorphous grain boundary complexions has been proposed to address these issues, by simultaneously stabilizing nanocrystalline grain structures for scale-up processing and improving alloy toughness. In the present study, the mechanical behavior of bulk nanocrystalline Al-Mg-Y is examined with macroscale compression testing, probing a length scale that is relevant to real-world structural applications. Bulk samples were fabricated via a simple powder metallurgy approach, with different pressing temperatures and times employed for consolidation in order to investigate microstructural and property evolution. All of the specimens contained primary face-centered cubic Al and secondary Al4C3 and Al3Y phases, with the Al3Y particles exhibiting two populations of small equiaxed and larger elongated particles. Appreciable plasticity was measured along with high ultimate stresses over 800 MPa due to the presence of amorphous grain boundary complexions. Microstructural characterization of fracture surfaces revealed that the area fraction of dimpled regions increased with longer hot-pressing time. Most importantly, the elongated Al3Y particles formed regular cellular patterns with increasing hot-pressing time, delaying shear localization and significantly enhancing plasticity. The hierarchy present in the microstructure of the Al-Mg-Y alloy, from amorphous grain boundary complexions to secondary phases, gives rise to excellent bulk mechanical properties, which are attractive for structural applications.

Title: Unveiling Fine Structure and Energy-driven Transition of Photoelectron Kikuchi Diffraction
Authors: Trung-Phuc Vo, Olena Tkach, Aki Pulkkinen, Didier Sebilleau, Aimo Winkelmann, Olena Fedchenko, Yaryna Lytvynenko, Dmitry Vasilyev, Hans-Joachim Elmers, Gerd Schonhense, Jan Minar
Abstract: The intricate fine structure of Kikuchi diffraction plays a vital role in probing phase transformations and strain distributions in functional materials, particularly in electron microscopy. Beyond these applications, it also proves essential in photoemission spectroscopy (PES) at high photon energies, aiding in the disentanglement of complex angle-resolved PES data and enabling emitter-site-specific studies. However, the detection and analysis of these rich faint structures in photoelectron diffraction (PED), especially in the hard X-ray regime, remain highly challenging, with only a limited number of simulations successfully reproducing these patterns. The strong energy dependence of Kikuchi patterns further complicates their interpretation, necessitating advanced theoretical approaches. To enhance structural analysis, we present a comprehensive theoretical study of fine diffraction patterns and their evolution with energy by simulating core-level emissions from Ge(100) and Si(100). Using multiple-scattering theory and the fully relativistic one-step photoemission model, we simulate faint pattern networks for various core levels across different kinetic energies (106 eV - 4174 eV), avoiding cluster size convergence issues inherent in cluster-based methods. Broadening in patterns is discussed via the inelastic scattering treatment. For the first time, circular dichroism has been observed and successfully reproduced in the angular distribution of Si (100) 1s, revealing detailed features and asymmetries up to 31%. Notably, we successfully replicate experimental bulk and more "surface-sensitivity" diffraction features, further validating the robustness of our simulations. The results show remarkable agreement with the experimental data obtained using circularly polarized radiations, demonstrating the potential of this methodology for advancing high-energy PES investigations.

Title: Partial-Wetting Phenomena in Active Matter
Authors: Jing Zhang, Zhixin Liu, Shengda Zhao, Yangjun Yan, Rongxin Yue, Jiaxin Yu, Xinjie Li, Xinghua Zhang
Abstract: Abundant interfacial phenomena in nature, such as water droplets on lotus leaves and water transport in plant vessels, originate from partial-wetting phenomena, which can be well described by Young's equation. It remains an intriguing question whether similar behaviors exist in active matter. In this letter, we present a clear demonstration of the partial-wetting phenomenon in a ternary laning system, which is a typical active system. A phase diagram is constructed in which the relative drift velocities of different components govern the transitions among drying, partial wetting, and complete wetting states. The mechanical balance on the contact lines of the partial-wetting phase described by Young's equation is verified. A theoretical picture is proposed to explain the analogy of partial wetting in the laning system to that in the equilibrium system.

Title: Band-spin-valley coupled exciton physics in antiferromagnetic MnPS$_3$
Authors: Dan Wang, Haowei Chen, Yu Pang, Xiaolong Zou, Wenhui Duan
Abstract: The introduction of intrinsic magnetic order in two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors offers great opportunities for investigating correlated excitonic phenomena. Here, we employ full-spinor GW plus Bethe-Salpeter equation methodology to reveal rich exciton physics in a prototypical 2D Néel-type antiferromagnetic semiconductor MnPS$_3$, enabled by the interplay among inverted dispersion of the second valence band, spin-valley coupling and magnetic order. The negative hole mass increases the reduced mass of the lowest-energy bright exciton, leading to exchange splitting enhancement of the bright exciton relative to band-edge dark exciton. Notably, such splitting couples with spontaneous valley polarization to generate distinct excitonic fine structure between $K$ and $-K$ valleys, which dictate distinct relaxation behaviors. Crucially, magnetic order transition from Néel antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic state induces significant quasiparticle band structure reconstruction and excitonic transitions modification, with low-energy optical excitations being exclusively contributed by majority-spin channel. These findings establish 2D antiferromagnetic semiconductors as an intriguing platform to study band-spin-valley coupled exciton physics.

Title: Converting $PT$-Symmetric Topological Classes by Floquet Engineering
Authors: Ming-Jian Gao, Jun-Hong An
Abstract: Going beyond the conventional classification rule of Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes, $PT$ symmetric topological phases are classified by $(PT)^2=1$ or $-1$. The interconversion between the two $PT$-symmetric topological classes is generally difficult due to the constraint of $(PT)^2$. Here, we propose a scheme to control and interconvert the $PT$-symmetric topological classes by Floquet engineering. We find that it is the breakdown of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge, induced by the $\pi$ phase difference between different hopping rates, by the periodic driving that leads to such an interconversion. Relaxing the system from the constraint of $(PT)^2$, rich exotic topological phases, e.g., the coexisting $PT$-symmetric first-order real Chern insulator and second-order topological insulators not only in different quasienergy gaps, but also in one single gap, are generated. In contrast to conventional Floquet topological phases, our result provides a way to realize exotic topological phases without changing symmetries. It enriches the family of topological phases and gives an insightful guidance for the development of multifunctional quantum devices.

Title: Language Models for Materials Discovery and Sustainability: Progress, Challenges, and Opportunities
Authors: Zongrui Pei, Junqi Yin, Jiaxin Zhang
Abstract: Significant advancements have been made in one of the most critical branches of artificial intelligence: natural language processing (NLP). These advancements are exemplified by the remarkable success of OpenAI's GPT-3.5/4 and the recent release of GPT-4.5, which have sparked a global surge of interest akin to an NLP gold rush. In this article, we offer our perspective on the development and application of NLP and large language models (LLMs) in materials science. We begin by presenting an overview of recent advancements in NLP within the broader scientific landscape, with a particular focus on their relevance to materials science. Next, we examine how NLP can facilitate the understanding and design of novel materials and its potential integration with other methodologies. To highlight key challenges and opportunities, we delve into three specific topics: (i) the limitations of LLMs and their implications for materials science applications, (ii) the creation of a fully automated materials discovery pipeline, and (iii) the potential of GPT-like tools to synthesize existing knowledge and aid in the design of sustainable materials.

Title: Highly Stable Silicon Anodes Enabled by Sub-10 nm Pores and Particles
Authors: Pankaj Ghildiyal, Brandon Wagner, Jianjun Chen, Tu Nguyen, Aishwarya Belamkar, Juchen Guo, Lorenzo Mangolini
Abstract: Silicon anodes offer high energy densities for next-generation lithium-ion batteries; however, their application is limited by severe volume expansion during cycling. Making silicon porous or nanostructured mitigates this expansion but often increases lithium inventory losses due to the inherent high surface area of nanomaterials. This study introduces a simple bottom-up process that overcomes this limitation. The approach relies on small silicon particles (<10 nm) produced using an efficient low-temperature plasma approach. These small building blocks are assembled into micron-scale superstructures characterized by uniformly dispersed sub-10 nm pores. This structure addresses both volume expansion and lithium-inventory issues while achieving tap densities exceeding those of commercial graphite (~1.2 g/cm3), all while maintaining good processability. The resulting silicon-dominant anodes achieve remarkable stability in full pouch cells with NMC811 and LFP cathodes, retaining ~80% capacity for more than 400 cycles without pre-lithiation, graphite blending, or pre-cycling.

Title: Free Energy Distribution and Relaxation Dynamics Near the First-Order Transition Line
Authors: Ranran Guo, Xiaobing Li, Mingmei Xu, Jinghua Fu, Yuanfang Wu
Abstract: Using the three-dimensional kinetic Ising model with Metropolis algorithm, we calculate the free energy in the whole phase boundary, particularly near the first phase transition line (1st-PTL).The results show that along the 1st-PTL, as the temperature decreases, the energy barrier between the two coexisting phases diverges. This results in more difficulty to reach the equilibrium, i.e., ultra-slow relaxation, which has been recently demonstrated. Meanwhile, we exam the randomness of the equilibrium time. It is found that near the 1st-PTL the equilibrium time is self-diverging, in contrast to the non-self-averaging near the critical point.

Title: Vector pulse magnet
Authors: Kosuke Noda, Kent Seki, Dilip Bhoi, Kazuyuki Matsubayashi, Kazuto Akiba, Akihiko Ikeda
Abstract: The underlying symmetry of the crystal, electronic structure, and magnetic structure manifests itself in the anisotropy of materials' properties, which is a central topic of the present condensed matter research. However, it demands such a considerable effort to fill the explorable space that only a small part has been conquered. We report a vector pulse magnet (VPM) as an alternative experimental technique to control the direction of applied magnetic fields, which may complement the conventional methods with its characteristic features. The VPM combines a conventional pulse magnet and a vector magnet. The VPM can create vector pulsed magnetic fields and swiftly rotating pulsed magnetic fields. As a demonstration, the three-dimensional magnetoresistance measurement of a highly oriented pyrolytic graphite is carried out using the AC four-probe method at 4.5 K and 6 T. The two-dimensional electronic structure of graphite is visualized in the three-dimensional magnetoresistance data. One can uncover the rotational and time-reversal symmetry of materials using a VPM and a variety of measurement techniques.

Title: Erratic non-Hermitian skin localization
Authors: Stefano Longhi
Abstract: A novel localization phenomenon, termed erratic non-Hermitian skin localization, has been identified in disordered globally-reciprocal non-Hermitian lattices. Unlike conventional non-Hermitian skin effect and Anderson localization, it features macroscopic eigenstate localization at irregular, disorder-dependent positions with sub-exponential decay. Using the Hatano-Nelson model with disordered imaginary gauge fields as a case study, this effect is linked to stochastic interfaces governed by the universal order statistics of random walks. Finite-size scaling analysis confirms the localized nature of the eigenstates. This discovery challenges conventional wave localization paradigms, offering new avenues for understanding and controlling localization phenomena in non-Hermitian physics.

Title: Metamorphic quantum dot arrays in twisted trilayer hexagonal boron nitride
Authors: Kunihiro Yananose, Changwon Park, Young-Woo Son
Abstract: A large set of controlled quantum states with tunable spacing and interactions is crucial in understanding and engineering novel quantum materials for quantum information processing. Such achievements have been mostly confined to atomic physics, exemplified by ordered arrays of neutral atoms or trapped ions. In solid-state systems, well-ordered quantum dots (QDs), in particular, also have significant potential for these applications. However, their precise large-scale fabrication and on-demand reconfigurations remain important challenges. Here, we predict that twisted trilayer hexagonal boron nitride hosts well-defined QD arrays with spatial precision and symmetry control as well as exceptional dynamic repositioning. These arrays emerge naturally at ultrasmall twist angles, forming diverse domain configurations including triangular, kagome and hexagram arrangements. The quantum states within each dot exhibit high fidelity to quantum harmonic oscillator wavefunctions, realizing uniform dot states as long as the moire-of-moire lattice is well ordered. Uniquely, we demonstrate that these arrays can be dynamically reconfigured via external electric fields coupled to local electric polarizations, allowing continuous tuning between regimes of strong coupling and complete isolation, and offering a pathway to long-ranged quantum information shuttling. This tunability and uniformity distinguish our platform from conventional implementations and suggest substantial potential for quantum applications, from array-based single-photon sources to scalable quantum processors, establishing twisted van der Waals systems as a promising platform for programmable quantum architectures with spatial and energetic control.

Title: Photoinduced DC Hall current in few-layer black phosphorus with a gate-tunable Floquet gap
Authors: Taehun Kim, Hansol Kim, Dongeun Kim, Hongki Min
Abstract: We theoretically explore Floquet engineering in few-layer black phosphorus (fBP) under time-periodic driving. Motivated by the ability of circularly polarized light to induce nontrivial topological states at Dirac nodes, we investigate the emergence of a photoinduced DC Hall effect in the Dirac semimetal phase of fBP. Starting from a low-energy continuum model, we derive the effective Floquet Hamiltonian and analytically calculate the Berry curvature, demonstrating the opening of a topological gap. We also perform lattice-model calculations incorporating a self-consistent Hartree method to compute Floquet band structures and DC Hall conductivity under a perpendicular electric field. Our results reveal that the DC Hall current in fBP can be effectively tuned via a periodic driving field and electrostatic gating.

Title: Gapless behavior in a two-leg spin ladder with bond randomness
Authors: Yu Tominaga, Itsuki Shimamura, Takanori Kida, Masayuki Hagiwara, Koji Araki, Yuko Hosokoshi, Yoshiki Iwasaki, Hironori Yamaguchi
Abstract: We successfully synthesized [Cu$_2$(AcO)$_4$($p$-Py-V-$p$-F)$_2$]$\cdot$4CHCl$_3$, a verdazyl-based complex with a paddlewheel structure comprising two Cu atoms, which induces strong antiferromagnetic (AF) exchange interactions between Cu spins, generating a nonmagnetic singlet state at low temperatures. Two primary exchange interactions between radical spins generate a spin-1/2 AF two-leg ladder. In addition, two possible positional configurations of the F atom in the complex create four different overlap patterns of molecular orbitals, introducing bond randomness in the spin ladder. The observed experimental behaviors, such as the Curie tail in the magnetic susceptibility and the gapless gradual increase in the magnetization curve, are attributed to a broad distribution of excitation energies and a few orphan spins in the random-singlet (RS) state that are stabilized by bond randomness. The low-temperature specific heat exhibits a temperature dependence with $\propto 1/|{\rm{ln}}T|^3$, demonstrating the formation of the RS state in unfrustrated systems. We also consider the effect of restricted patterns of exchange interactions and one-dimensional nature of the system on the RS state.

Title: Effect of presence of rigid impurities in a system of annihilating domain walls with dynamic bias
Authors: Reshmi Roy, Parongama Sen
Abstract: The dynamics of interacting domain walls, regarded as a system of particles which are biased to move towards their nearest neighbours and annihilate when they meet, have been studied in the recent past. We study the effect of the presence of a fraction $r$ of quenched impurities (which act as rigid walkers) on the dynamics. Here, in case two domain walls or one impurity and one domain wall happen to be on the same site, both get simultaneously annihilated. It is found that for any non-zero value of $r$, the dynamical behaviour changes as the surviving fraction of particles $\rho(t)$ attains a constant value. $\rho(t)t^\alpha $ shows a universal behaviour when plotted against $r^\beta t$ with $\alpha, \beta$ values depending on whether the particles are rigid or nonrigid. Also, the values differ for the biased and unbiased cases. The time scale associated with the particle decay obtained in several ways shows that it varies with $r$ in a power law manner with a universal exponent.

Title: Layered semiconductors integrated with polyimide thin films for high-quality valleytronic and quantum-photonic systems
Authors: Jithin T Surendran, Indrajeet D Prasad, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Santosh Kumar
Abstract: Dielectric integration of layered semiconductors is a prerequisite for fabricating high-quality optoelectronic, valleytronic, and quantum-photonic devices. While hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is the current benchmark dielectric, exploration of the most suitable dielectric materials covering the complete substrates continues to expand. This work demonstrates the formation of high optical-quality excitons in two widely explored layered semiconductors, WSe$_2$ and WS$_2$, integrated into polyimide (PI) thin films of thicknesses $\approx$500 nm. The photoluminescence (PL) studies at $T$ = 296 K show the formation of neutral excitons $\left(X^0\right)$ and trions in fully-PI-encapsulated 1L-WSe$_2$ with 2-sigma ($2\sigma$) spatial-inhomogeneity of 4.5 (3.4) meV in $X^0$ emission energy (linewidth), which is $\approx$1/3rd (1/5th), respectively, that of inhomogeneity measured in fully-hBN-encapsulated 1L-WSe$_2$. A smaller $2\sigma$ of 2.1 (2.3) meV in $X^0$ emission energy (linewidth) has been shown for fully-PI-encapsulated 1L-WS$_2$. Polarization-resolved and excitation power-dependent PL measurements of PI-isolated 1L-TMDs at $T$ = 4 K further reveal formations of high-quality neutral-biexcitons and negatively-charged biexcitons, with degrees of valley-polarization up to 21$\%$ under non-resonant excitation. Furthermore, the fully-PI-encapsulated 1L-WSe$_2$ also hosts single quantum emitters with narrow linewidths and high-spectral stability. This work indicates that PI thin films may serve the purpose of high-quality dielectric material for integrating the layered materials on a wafer scale.

Title: The compliance of the molecular hydride superconductor $BiH_4$ with the Migdal's theorem
Authors: E.F. Talantsev, Yu.V. Blinova, A.V. Korolev
Abstract: The discovery of near-room-temperature superconductivity in H3S sparked experimental and theoretical studies of highly compressed hydrides with the aim of obtaining room-temperature superconductivity. There are two dominant hydride classes where the search is ongoing: the first class is the covalently bonded hydrides (which is represented by H3S), and the second class is the clathrate-type hydrides (which is represented by LaH10, YH6, CaH6). Recently, the third class of superconducting hydrides, where the hydrogen remains its molecular form, has been discovered. This class is represented by BaH12 and BiH4. Here, we analyzed experimental data for the BaH12 and BiH4. We found that the BaH12 exhibits grains of an average size of 26 nm and a low level of microstrain 0.1%, in the range of 126 GPa < P < 160 GPa. We also derived the Debye $\Theta_D$ and Einstein $\Theta_E$ temperatures, and the electron-phonon coupling constant $\Lambda_{e-ph} $ in BaH12 and BiH4. The $\Lambda_{e-ph} $ in BiH4 significantly differs from the values obtained by first-principles calculations. The derived Fermi temperature $T_F = 20,000 K$ for BiH4 positions this molecular hydride between the unconventional and conventional superconductors bands in the Uemura plot. This position is outside of the band where covalently bonded and clathrate hydrides are located. The ratio $\Theta_D / T_F = 0.026 $ of BiH4 is typical for pure metals and A-15 alloys. This implies that the BiH4, is the first hydride superconductor which complains with the Migdal's theorem.

Title: Fickian Yet non-Gaussian Diffusion in Complex Molecular Fluids via a non-local diffusion framework
Authors: H. Srinivasan, V. K. Sharma, S. Mitra
Abstract: Fickian yet non-Gaussian diffusion (FnGD) has gained popularity in the recent times owing to it's ubiquity in a variety of complex fluids. However, whether FnGD can be observed experimentally in molecular fuids is still obscure with very little study in real systems. In this letter, we show existence of FnGD in molecular fluids based on compelling evidence from incoherent quasielastic neutron scattering (IQENS). Using a cage-jump diffsion model, we show that while the approach to Fickianity is exponentially fast, the Gaussianity is restored at a much slower algebraic rate. We propose a non-local diffusion (NLD) model to describe a d-dimensional jump-diffusion in FnGD regime and show their universal applicability in such systems. This study establishes that cage-jump diffusion process inevitably lead to FnGD and provides the framework of NLD models to explore such diffusion phenomena in any arbitrary dimensions.

Title: Extending Collinear Density Functionals to Noncollinear Cases under Periodic Boundary Condition
Authors: Xiaoyu Zhang, Taoni Bao
Abstract: Accurate modeling of spin-orbit coupling and noncollinear magnetism in materials requires noncollinear density functionals within the two-component generalized Kohn-Sham (GKS) framework, yet constructing and implementing noncollinear functionals remains challenging. Recently, a methodology was proposed to extend collinear functionals into noncollinear ones, successfully defining noncollinear functionals and their derivatives. However, the initial implementation involved a systematic approach to differentiate energy over density matrix elements rather than the derivatives of the energy functional with respect to density, presenting challenges for integration with periodic boundary condition-density functional theory (PBC-DFT) software. We have derived a novel set of working equations based on the original methodology, which provides noncollinear energy functionals and their derivatives. These working equations have been implemented in our noncollinear functional ensemble named NCXC, ensuring numerical stability and transferability without the need for incorporating derivatives of basis functions. This implementation is expected to facilitate compatibility with most DFT software packages. We demonstrate some preliminary applications in periodic systems, including noncollinear magnetism in spin spirals, band structures in topological insulators, and band gaps in semiconducting inorganic materials, using NCXC.

Title: Predicting Methane Adsorption in Metal-Substituted MOFs: A Comparative Study between Density Functional Theory and Machine Learning
Authors: Karim Aljamal, Xiao Wang
Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising materials for methane capture due to their high surface area and tunable properties. Metal substitution represents a powerful strategy to enhance MOF performance, yet systematic exploration of the vast chemical space remains challenging. In this work, we compare density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning (ML) in predicting methane adsorption properties in metal-substituted variants of three high-performing MOFs: M-HKUST-1, M-ATC, and M-ZIF-8 (M = Cu, Zn). DFT calculations reveal significant differences in methane binding energetics between Cu and Zn variants of all three MOFs. On the other hand, we fine-tuned a pretrained multimodal ML model, PMTransformer, on a curated subset of hypothetical MOF (hMOF) structures to predict macroscopic adsorption properties. While the model qualitatively predicts adsorption properties for the original unaltered MOFs, it fails to distinguish between metal variants despite their different binding energetics identified by DFT. We trace this limitation to the hMOF training data generated using Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations based on classical force fields (UFF/TraPPE). Our study highlights a key challenge in ML-based MOF screening: ML models inherit the limitations of their training data, particularly when electronic effects significantly impact adsorption behavior. Our findings emphasize the need for improved force fields or hybrid GCMC/DFT datasets to incorporate both geometric and electronic factors for accurate prediction of adsorption properties in metal-substituted MOFs.

Title: Ordering and association of patchy particles in narrow channels

Abstract: We show that the formalism of Wertheim's first order thermodynamic perturbation theory can be generalised for the fluid of anisotropic sticky particles confined to a quasi-one-dimensional channel. Using the transfer matrix method, we prove that the theory is exact if the hard body interaction is additive, only the first neighbors interact and the particles can stick together only along the channel. We show that the most convenient treatment of association in narrow channels is to work in NPT ensemble, where all structural and thermodynamic quantities can be expressed as a function of pressure and fraction of sites unbonded.

Title: Learning via mechanosensitivity and activity in cytoskeletal networks
Authors: Deb S. Banerjee, Martin J. Falk, Margaret L Gardel, Aleksandra M. Walczak, Thierry Mora, Suriyanarayanan Vaikuntanathan
Abstract: In this work we show how a network inspired by a coarse-grained description of actomyosin cytoskeleton can learn - in a contrastive learning framework - from environmental perturbations if it is endowed with mechanosensitive proteins and motors. Our work is a proof of principle for how force-sensitive proteins and molecular motors can form the basis of a general strategy to learn in biological systems. Our work identifies a minimal biologically plausible learning mechanism and also explores its implications for commonly occuring phenomenolgy such as adaptation and homeostatis.

Title: Electronic stopping cross sections of tungsten to swift ions and comparisons with models
Authors: Tiago F. Silva, Arilson Silva, Cleber L. Rodrigues, Nemitala Added, Manfredo H. Tabacniks, Flávio Matias, Helio Yoriyaz, Julian Shorto
Abstract: Accurate stopping power data for tungsten is crucial for ion beam analysis (IBA) techniques applied to fusion-related materials. In this work, we present new experimental measurements of the stopping power of tungsten for protons and alpha particles, addressing key gaps in fundamental databases. Our results provide a densely spaced dataset, refining the practical uncertainty limits to approximately 1.5\% for protons and 4\% for alpha particles. We critically compare our findings with semi-empirical and theoretical models, evaluating their performance in describing the stopping power of tungsten for light projectiles. By improving the accuracy and reliability of stopping power data, we contribute to the enhancement of the applicability of ion-beam methods for characterizing tungsten in fusion-related research. These findings contribute to the refinement of semi-empirical models and support the ongoing efforts to develop more precise theoretical frameworks for ion-solid interactions in high-Z materials.

Title: The phase diagram of CeRh$_{2}$As$_{2}$ for out-of-plane magnetic field

Abstract: The heavy-fermion superconductor CeRh$_{2}$As$_{2}$ ($T_{\textrm{c}} = 0.35\, \textrm{K}$) shows two superconducting (SC) phases, SC1 and SC2, when a magnetic field is applied parallel to the $c$ axis of the tetragonal unit cell. All experiments to date indicate that the change in SC order parameter detected at $\mu_{\textrm{0}}H^{*} \approx 4\, \textrm{T}$ is due to strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling at the Ce sites caused by the locally non-centrosymmetric environments of the otherwise globally centrosymmetric crystalline structure. Another phase (phase I) exists in this material below $T_{\textrm{0}} = 0.54\, \textrm{K}$. In a previous specific heat study [K. Semeniuk et al. Phys. Rev. B, $107$, L220504 (2023)] we have shown that phase I persists up to a field $\mu_{\textrm{0}}H_{0} \approx 6\, \textrm{T}$, larger than $H^{*}$. From thermodynamic arguments we expected the phase-I boundary line to cross phase SC2 at a tetracritical point. However, we could not find any signature of the phase-I line inside the SC2 phase and speculated that this was due to the fact that the $T_{0}(H)$ line is almost perpendicular to the $H$ axis and, therefore, invisible to $T$-dependent measurements. This would imply a weak competition between the two order parameters. Here, we report magnetic field dependent measurements of the magnetostriction and ac-susceptibility on high-quality single crystals. We see clear evidence of the singularity at $H_{0}$ inside the SC2 phase and confirm our previous prediction. Furthermore, we observe the transition across the $T^{*}(H)$ line in $T$-dependent specific heat measurements, which show that the $T^{*}(H)$ line is not perpendicular to the field axis, but has a positive slope. Our work supports recent $\mu$SR results which suggest coexistence of phase I with superconductivity.

Title: Non-Hermitian Hopf insulators
Authors: Daichi Nakamura, Kohei Kawabata
Abstract: Hopf insulators represent a unique class of topological insulators that exist exclusively in two-band systems and are inherently unstable upon the inclusion of additional bands. Meanwhile, recent studies have shown that non-Hermiticity gives rise to distinctive complex-energy gap structures, known as point gaps, and associated topological phases with no analogs in Hermitian systems. However, non-Hermitian counterparts of Hopf insulators have remained largely elusive. Here, we generally classify topological phases of two-band non-Hermitian systems based on the homotopy theory and uncover Hopf-type point-gap topology present only for two bands. Specifically, we reveal such Hopf-type point-gap topology for three-dimensional systems with chiral symmetry (class AIII) and four-dimensional systems with no symmetry (class A). Explicitly constructing prototypical models from the Hermitian Hopf insulator, we further demonstrate that these non-Hermitian topological phases lead to anomalous point-gapless boundary states spectrally detachable from the bulk bands.

Title: Interacting Copies of Random Constraint Satisfaction Problems
Authors: Maria Chiara Angelini, Louise Budzynski, Federico Ricci-Tersenghi
Abstract: We study a system of $y=2$ coupled copies of a well-known constraint satisfaction problem (random hypergraph bicoloring) to examine how the ferromagnetic coupling between the copies affects the properties of the solution space. We solve the replicated model by applying the cavity method to the supervariables taking $2^y$ values. Our results show that a coupling of strength $\gamma$ between the copies decreases the clustering threshold $\alpha_d(\gamma)$, at which typical solutions shatters into disconnected components, therefore preventing numerical methods such as Monte Carlo Markov Chains from reaching equilibrium in polynomial time. This result needs to be reconciled with the observation that, in models with coupled copies, denser regions of the solution space should be more accessible. Additionally, we observe a change in the nature of the clustering phase transition, from discontinuous to continuous, in a wide $\gamma$ range. We investigate how the coupling affects the behavior of the Belief Propagation (BP) algorithm on finite-size instances and find that BP convergence is significantly impacted by the continuous transition. These results highlight the importance of better understanding algorithmic performance at the clustering transition, and call for a further exploration into the optimal use of re-weighting strategies designed to enhance algorithmic performances.

Title: Improving efficiency and stability for perovskite solar cell with diethylene glycol dimethacrylate modification
Authors: Xiaodan Wei, Shuyuan Zhang, Boyang Ma, Zehua Feng, chunhan Yu, Linyuan Peng, Zijian Hua, Jie Xu
Abstract: The humidity resistance is the key challenges that hinder the commercial application of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we propose an ultra-thin acrylate polymer (diethylene glycol dimethacrylate, DGDMA) into perovskite films to investigate the influence of polymerized networks on stability. The monomer molecules containing acrylate and carbonyl groups were selected, and the effects of the polymerized were quantified with different concentration. The experimental results show that, when the concentration of DGDMA is 1 mg/ml, the PCE increases from 18.06% to 21.82%, which is optimum. The monomer molecules with carbonyl groups polymerize, they can chelate with uncoordinated Pb2+ in perovskite films to improve the film quality, reduce the surface defect density to decrease non-radiative recombination, and also significantly enhance the humidity stability of PSCs.

Title: Spin dynamics and 1/3 magnetization plateau in a coupled distorted diamond chain compound K2Cu3(MoO4)4
Authors: G. Senthil Murugan, J. Khatua, Suyoung Kim, Eundeok Mun, K. Ramesh Babu, Heung-Sik Kim, C.-L. Huang, R. Kalaivanan, U. Rajesh Kumar, I. Panneer Muthuselvam, W. T. Chen, Sritharan Krishnamoorthi, K.-Y. Choi, R. Sankar
Abstract: We investigate magnetic properties of the $s$ = 1/2 compound K$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$(MoO$_{4}$)$_{4}$ by combining magnetic susceptibility, magnetization, specific heat, and electron spin resonance (ESR) with density functional calculations. Its monoclinic structure features alternating Cu$^{2+}$ ($s$ = 1/2) monomers and edge-shared dimers linked by MoO$_{4}$ units, forming a distorted diamond chain along the $a$-axis. Antiferromagnetic order occurs at $T_{\rm N}$ = 2.3 K, as evident from a $\lambda$-type anomaly in specific heat and magnetic susceptibility derivatives. Inverse magnetic susceptibility reveals coexisting ferro- and antiferromagnetic interactions. Specific heat and ESR data show two characteristic temperatures: one at 20 K, associated with spin-singlet formation in Cu$_{2}$O$_{9}$ dimers, and another at 3.68 K, indicating short-range correlations between dimers and monomers. Magnetization measurements reveal a metamagnetic transition at 2.6 T and a critical magnetic field $\mu_{0}H_{c}$ = 3.4 T, where a 1/3 magnetization plateau emerges with saturation near 0.35 $\mu_{\rm B}$. Low-temperature specific heat and magnetization data reveal the suppression of long-range order at $\mu_{0}H_{c}$, enabling the construction of a temperature-magnetic field phase diagram showing multiple magnetic phases near the $\mu_{0}H_{c}$. Density functional theory confirms a distorted diamond chain with $J_{1}$ dimers and competing $J_2$, $J_4$, $J_3$, and $J_5$ interactions with monomer spins as an effective low-temperature spin model.

Title: The preparation and properties of polycrystalline Bi$_2$O$_2$Se -- pitfalls and difficulties with reproducibility and charge transport limiting parameters
Authors: Jan Zich, Tomáš Plecháček, Antonín Sojka, Petr Levinský, Jiří Navrátil, Pavlína Ruleová, Stanislav Šlang, Karel Knížek, Jiří Hejtmánek, Vojtěch Nečina, Čestmír Drašar
Abstract: Thermoelectric materials allow the direct conversion of waste heat into electricity, and novel materials are being investigated for this purpose. Recently, doped Bi$_2$O$_2$Se has shown high application potential. In this study, we discuss causes for large variation in reported transport properties of pure Bi$_2$O$_2$Se and present a preparation method that improves the reproducibility of undoped polycrystalline samples and improves their stability under thermal cycling. Key steps of this method include calcination of the Bi$_2$O$_3$ precursor, purification of the synthesized material in a temperature gradient, use of a coarse particle fraction and compaction of the powders in a Si3N4 die instead of a graphite die. The resulting polycrystalline material exhibits improved reproducibility and enhanced resistance to thermal cycling. It has room temperature electrical conductivity {\sigma}RT ~ 500 S.m-1 and Seebeck coefficient S ~ -300 $\mu$V.K$^{-1}$. These properties make it suitable as a reference material for future doping studies. The presented synthesis approach may provide a more reliable platform for investigating the intrinsic behavior and doping response of Bi$_2$O$_2$Se in thermoelectric applications.

Title: Swap Monte Carlo for diatomic molecules
Authors: Till Böhmer, Jeppe C. Dyre, Lorenzo Costigliola
Abstract: In recent years the Swap Monte Carlo algorithm has led to remarkable progress in equilibrating supercooled model liquids at low temperatures. Applications have so far been limited to systems composed of spherical particles, however, whereas most real-world supercooled liquids are molecular. We here introduce a simple size-polydisperse molecular model that allows for efficient thermal equilibration \textit{in silico} with the Swap Monte Carlo method, resulting in an estimated speedup of $10^3-10^6$ at moderate polydispersity (5-10 %). Despite being polydisperse, the model exhibits little difference between the size-resolved orientational time-autocorrelation functions. Our results demonstrate the possibility of designing molecular models that can be simulated close to the calorimetric glass transition.

Title: Tracer dynamics in an interacting active bath: fluctuations and energy partition
Authors: Ritwick Sarkar, Ion Santra
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a massive tracer particle coupled to an interacting active bath, modeled as a harmonic chain of overdamped active particles analytically, with an aim to understand the impact of bath interactions and activity on the nonequilibrium fluctuations of the tracer. From the microscopic equations, we derive the tracer particle's effective Langevin equation, obtaining the dissipative and stochastic forces from the bath. We analyze the friction kernel, revealing power-law tails in the weak coupling limit and exponential decay in the strong coupling regime. Due to the interplay between bath interactions, probe-bath coupling, and activity, the mean squared displacement, velocity, and stationary velocity correlations exhibit different dynamical regimes, which we characterize analytically. Under harmonic confinement, we find that energy equipartition holds at low activity but breaks down at higher activity, with the kinetic energy exhibiting a non-monotonic dependence on the activity of the bath.

Title: Predicting fermionic densities using a Projected Quantum Kernel method
Authors: Francesco Perciavalle, Francesco Plastina, Michele Pisarra, Nicola Lo Gullo
Abstract: We use a support vector regressor based on a projected quantum kernel method to predict the density structure of 1D fermionic systems of interest in quantum chemistry and quantum matter. The kernel is built on with the observables of a quantum reservoir implementable with interacting Rydberg atoms. Training and test data of the fermionic system are generated using a Density Functional Theory approach. We test the performance of the method for several Hamiltonian parameters, finding a general common behavior of the error as a function of measurement time. At sufficiently large measurement times, we find that the method outperforms the classical linear kernel method and can be competitive with the radial basis function method.

Title: Probing Complex Decoherence Processes in Materials for Quantum Applications
Authors: Albert Liu, Matthew W. Day, Steven T. Cundiff
Abstract: The primary consideration in developing new material platforms for quantum applications is to optimize coherence. Despite its importance, decoherence processes remains challenging to experimentally interrogate and quantify. In this Perspective, we first introduce the concept of decoherence in quantum systems and conventional techniques to assess decoherence at optical frequencies. We then introduce multidimensional coherent spectroscopy as a unique probe capable of revealing the full complexity of decoherence dynamics in realistic circumstances. To contextualize the techniques discussed here, demonstrative examples in two prototypical quantum systems, namely colloidal nanocrystals and vacancy centers in diamond, are provided.

Title: Average Spread Complexity and the Higher-Order Level Spacing
Authors: Amin Faraji Astaneh, Niloofar Vardian
Abstract: We investigate the spread complexity of a generic two-level subsystem of a larger system to analyze the influence of energy level statistics, comparing chaotic and integrable systems. Initially focusing on the nearest-neighbor level spacing, we observe the characteristic slope-dip-ramp-plateau structure. Further investigation reveals that certain matrix models exhibit additional iterative peaks, motivating us to generalize the known spacing distributions to higher-order level spacings. While this structure persists in chaotic systems, we find that integrable systems can also display similar features, highlighting limitations in using complexity as a universal diagnostic of quantum chaos.

Title: Gauging Quantum Phases: A Matrix Product State Approach
Authors: David Blanik, José Garre-Rubio, Norbert Schuch
Abstract: Utilizing the framework of matrix product states, we investigate gauging as a method for exploring quantum phases of matter. Specifically, we describe how symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases and spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) phases in one-dimensional spin systems behave under twisted gauging, a generalization of the well-known gauging procedure for globally symmetric states. Compared to previous, order parameter--based, approaches our analysis is not limited to the case of maximally non-commutative (MNC) phases and we use our findings to propose a generalization of the Kennedy-Tasaki transformation to the non-MNC setting. A key result of our work is that gauging produces configurations characterized by a combination of MNC order and symmetry breaking, when applied to non-MNC SPT phases. More generally, we conjecture a precise correspondence between SSB and non-MNC SPT phases, possibly enabling the detection of such phases using local and string order parameters.

Prainito, G. L. Carr, Ilya Charaev, Denis Bandurin, Genda Gu, Qiang Li, Karl. K. Berggren, D. N. Basov, Xu Du, Mengkun Liu
Abstract: Superconducting transition-edge sensors are renowned for their extraordinary photon sensitivity and energy resolution, finding applications spanning quantum information, astronomy, and nanophotonics. Here, we report the development of BOlometric Superconducting Optical Nanoscopy (BOSON), a novel platform that integrates bolometric detection at the superconducting transition edges with near-field optical techniques. BOSON enables the mapping of photoinduced changes in superconductivity with unprecedented spatial resolution and photon sensitivity. By incorporating BOSON with low-dimensional materials, we achieved polariton imaging at nanowatt excitation levels--at least four orders of magnitude lower than the power typically required in prior near-field nanoscopy experiments. Our findings highlight the potential for BOSON to advance scanning probe based optical platforms to enable the detection of photons, polaritons, and Cooper pair dynamics at the nanoscale. This paves the way for quantum sensing applications using single-polariton detection and can offer deeper insights into quasiparticle dynamics.

Title: Second-order nonlinear disordered photonic media
Authors: Rabisankar Samanta, Romolo Savo, Claudio Conti, Sushil Mujumdar
Abstract: The field of complex photonics has garnered significant interest due to its rich physics and myriad applications spanning physics, engineering, biology, and medicine. However, a substantial portion of research focuses primarily on the linear medium. Over the years, optical nonlinearity, particularly the second order denoted as $\chi^{(2)}$, has been harnessed for diverse applications such as frequency conversions, three-wave mixing, material characterizations, and bio-imaging. When $\chi^{(2)}$-nonlinearity combines with the disorder, a new realm of physics emerges, which in the last 30 years has witnessed substantial progress in fundamental studies and futuristic applications. This review aims to explore fundamental concepts concerning $\chi^{(2)}$-nonlinear disordered media, chart the field's evolution, highlight current interests within the research community, and conclude with a future perspective.

Title: Exact Duality at Low Energy in a Josephson Tunnel Junction Coupled to a Transmission Line
Authors: Luca Giacomelli, Michel H. Devoret, Cristiano Ciuti
Abstract: We theoretically explore the low-energy behavior of a Josephson tunnel junction coupled to a finite-length, charge-biased transmission line and compare it to its flux-biased counterpart. For transmission lines of increasing length, we show that the low-energy charge-dependent energy bands of the charge-biased configuration can be exactly mapped onto those of the flux-biased system via a well-defined duality transformation of circuit parameters. In the limit of an infinitely long transmission line, the influence of boundary conditions vanishes, and both circuits reduce to a resistively shunted Josephson junction. This convergence reveals the system's intrinsic self-duality and critical behavior. Our exact formulation of charge-flux duality provides a foundation for generalizations to more complex superconductor-insulator phase transitions.

Title: Symmetry resolved entanglement entropy after an inhomogeneous quench
Authors: Hui-Huang Chen, Xin-Liang Zhou, Jiayu Yin, Ming Zhang
Abstract: We investigate the non-equilibrium time evolution of symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy (SREE) following an inhomogeneous quench in a critical one-dimensional free fermion system. Using conformal field theory, we derive an exact expression for the SREE and analyze its behavior. We find that, at leading order in the long-time limit, the SREE grows logarithmically as $\log t$. While the equipartition of entanglement holds at leading order, we identify subleading corrections that break it. Our numerical simulations corroborate the analytical predictions with excellent agreement.

Title: Page curve like dynamics in Interacting Quantum Systems
Authors: Tamoghna Ray, Abhishek Dhar, Manas Kulkarni
Abstract: We study the dynamics of entanglement in a one-dimensional $XXZ$ spin-$1/2$ chain, with and without integrability-breaking interactions, that is connected to a bath. We start from a state where the system and bath are completely unentangled, and the bath is polarized spin-down. We consider two different initial states for the system - (i) a polarized spin-up state, and (ii) an infinite temperature state. In the particle representation of the spin chain, the polarized spin-up state corresponds to a filled state, while the polarized spin-down state corresponds to an empty state. Starting from these inhomogeneous quenches, in all the above-mentioned cases we obtain the Page curve like behavior in the entanglement. We report different power-law behavior in the growth of entanglement for different initial states and different kinds of baths (interacting and non-interacting). In an attempt to explore plausible deep connections between entanglement and Boltzmann entropy, we investigate the latter in both the filled and the infinite temperature case, for the system and the bath. For the filled case, the Boltzmann entropy of the system has the form of a Page curve but quantitatively deviates from the entanglement. On the other hand, the entropy of the bath keeps increasing. Remarkably, for the infinite temperature case, we find that the system and bath Boltzmann entropies agree with the entanglement entropy, after and before the Page time, respectively. Our findings are expected to hold for generic interacting quantum systems and could be of relevance to black hole physics.

Title: Quantum Simulation of the Unruh Temperature the Thermal Properties of Virtually Evolving Bose-Einstein Condensates
Authors: Imad-Eddine Chorfi, Nacer eddine Belaloui, Abdellah Tounsi, Achour Benslama, Mohamed Taha Rouabah
Abstract: This paper presents a novel theoretical model to simulate the Unruh temperature by relating it to the critical temperature of multiple Bose-Einstein thermal baths. These thermal baths are conceptualized as snapshots of a Bose-Firework originating from an evolving driven Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). The critical temperature of each snapshot is determined from the heat capacity, which is numerically estimated by calculating the partition function derived from the system's Hamiltonian. By analyzing the relationship between the average number of the phononic excitations at the critical temperature, acceleration, and the critical temperature itself, our model demonstrates a significant agreement with the Unruh temperature formula, thereby validating our hypothesis. This theoretical approach offers a cost-effective and time-efficient alternative to resource-intensive experimental simulations. Furthermore, it provides a unique perspective on quantum simulation by utilizing the critical phenomena of condensed matter systems to probe fundamental quantum relativistic effects.

Title: Path sampling challenges in large biomolecular systems: RETIS and REPPTIS for ABL-imatinib kinetics
Authors: Wouter Vervust, Daniel T. Zhang, Enrico Riccardi, Titus S. van Erp, An Ghysels
Abstract: Predicting the kinetics of drug-protein interactions is crucial for understanding drug efficacy, particularly in personalized medicine, where protein mutations can significantly alter drug residence times. This study applies Replica Exchange Transition Interface Sampling (RETIS) and its Partial Path variant (REPPTIS) to investigate the dissociation kinetics of imatinib from Abelson nonreceptor tyrosine kinase (ABL) and mutants relevant to chronic myeloid leukemia therapy. These path-sampling methods offer a bias-free alternative to conventional approaches requiring qualitative predefined reaction coordinates. Nevertheless, the complex free-energy landscape of ABL-imatinib dissociation presents significant challenges. Multiple metastable states and orthogonal barriers lead to parallel unbinding pathways, complicating convergence in TIS-based methods. Despite employing computational efficiency strategies such as asynchronous replica exchange, full convergence remained elusive. This work provides a critical assessment of path sampling in high-dimensional biological systems, discussing the need for enhanced initialization strategies, advanced Monte Carlo path generation moves, and machine learning-derived reaction coordinates to improve kinetic predictions of drug dissociation with minimal prior knowledge.

Title: Extending the Low-Frequency Limit of Time-Domain Thermoreflectance via Periodic Waveform Analysis
Authors: Mingzhen Zhang, Tao Chen, Shangzhi Song, Yunjia Bao, Ruiqiang Guo, Weidong Zheng, Puqing Jiang, Ronggui Yang
Abstract: Time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR) is a powerful technique for characterizing the thermal properties of layered materials. However, its effectiveness at modulation frequencies below 0.1 MHz is hindered by pulse accumulation effects, limiting its ability to accurately measure in-plane thermal conductivities below 6 W/(m K). Here, we present a periodic waveform analysis-based TDTR (PWA-TDTR) method that extends the measurable frequency range down to 50 Hz with minimal modifications to the conventional setup. This advancement greatly enhances measurement sensitivity, enabling accurate measurements of in-plane thermal conductivities as low as 0.2 W/(m K). We validate the technique by measuring polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and fused silica, using PWA-TDTR to obtain in-plane thermal diffusivity and conventional TDTR to measure cross-plane thermal effusivity. Together, these allow the extraction of both thermal conductivity and volumetric heat capacity, with results in excellent agreement with literature values. We further demonstrate the versatility of PWA-TDTR through (1) thermal conductivity and heat capacity measurements of thin liquid films and (2) depth-resolved thermal conductivity profiling in lithium niobate crystals, revealing point defect-induced inhomogeneities at depths up to 100 um. By overcoming frequency and sensitivity constraints, PWA-TDTR significantly expands the applicability of TDTR, enabling detailed investigations of thermal transport in materials and conditions that were previously challenging to study.

Title: Novel Concept-Oriented Synthetic Data approach for Training Generative AI-Driven Crystal Grain Analysis Using Diffusion Model
Authors: Ahmed Sobhi Saleh, Kristof Croes, Hajdin Ceric, Ingrid De Wolf, Houman Zahedmanesh
Abstract: The traditional techniques for extracting polycrystalline grain structures from microscopy images, such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), are labour-intensive, subjective, and time-consuming, limiting their scalability for high-throughput analysis. In this study, we present an automated methodology integrating edge detection with generative diffusion models to effectively identify grains, eliminate noise, and connect broken segments in alignment with predicted grain boundaries. Due to the limited availability of adequate images preventing the training of deep machine learning models, a new seven-stage methodology is employed to generate synthetic TEM images for training. This concept-oriented synthetic data approach can be extended to any field of interest where the scarcity of data is a challenge. The presented model was applied to various metals with average grain sizes down to the nanoscale, producing grain morphologies from low-resolution TEM images that are comparable to those obtained from advanced and demanding experimental techniques with an average accuracy of 97.23%.

Title: Maximum Entropy Production Principle of Thermodynamics for the Birth and Evolution of Life
Authors: Yasuji Sawada, Yasukazu Daigaku, Kenji Toma
Abstract: Research on the birth and evolution of life are reviewed with reference to the maximum entropy production principle (MEPP). It has been shown that this principle is essential for consistent understanding of the birth and evolution of life. First, a recent work for the birth of a self-replicative system as pre-RNA life is reviewed in relation to the MEPP. A critical condition of polymer concentration in a local system is reported by a dynamical system approach, above which, an exponential increase of entropy production is guaranteed. Secondly, research works of early stage of evolutions are reviewed; experimental research for the numbers of cells necessary for forming a multi-cellular organization, and numerical research of differentiation of a model system and its relation with MEPP. It is suggested by this review article that the late stage of evolution is characterized by formation of society and external entropy production. A hypothesis on the general route of evolution is discussed from the birth to the present life which follows the MEPP. Some examples of life which happened to face poor thermodynamic condition are presented with thermodynamic discussion. It is observed through this review that MEPP is consistently useful for thermodynamic understanding of birth and evolution of life, subject to a thermodynamic condition far from equilibrium.

Title: Optimizations of electronic stopping cross section measurements using the backscattering method
Authors: Victor Pires, Arilson Silva, Cleber L. Rodrigues, Nemitala Added, Manfredo H. Tabacniks, Tiago F. Silva, Flávio Matias, Helio Yoriyaz, Julian Shorto
Abstract: The accurate determination of electronic stopping cross sections is essential for advancing nuclear science and materials research. In this work, we present an optimized methodology for stopping power measurements using the backscattering technique, with a focus on minimizing both random and systematic uncertainties. By systematically analyzing the sources of uncertainty and refining the experimental geometry, we establish a robust framework for high-precision measurements. Our approach was applied to the stopping power of helium ions in gold thin films, demonstrating excellent agreement with reference models such as SRIM and ICRU-49. The results reveal that carefully chosen measurement angles can effectively balance statistical precision and systematic accuracy, achieving total uncertainties below 3% across a wide energy range. This study provides a refined strategy for stopping power determination, offering valuable improvements for ion beam analysis and benchmarking theoretical models.

Title: Bubble-assisted micromixing via thermally excited intrinsic air within microfluidic systems
Authors: Seyed Shahriar Riazi, Seyed Mostafa Hosseinalipour
Abstract: The micromixing process in microfluidic devices is of central importance in quite a few applications, with microfluidic studies on carbon capture and environmental monitoring being two examples. High surface area to volume ratio in microscale flows outweighs the role of interfacial tension manipulation by means of introducing a secondary phase to the main flow in order to augment the typically diffusion-dominant mass transfer operation. In this paper, we introduce an easily integrable continuous flow micromixing scheme implemented on a simple Y-type microchannel based on thermally excited intrinsic air within microchannel. Thanks to the direct contact between the sputtered thin platinum microheater and the co-flowing streams, trapped air in the liquid and/or tiny crevices is employed to generate elongated bubbles with a millisecond lifespan, consuming less than 0.4 W of power and thereby enabling homogeneous mixing. The performance of the micromixer is characterized in terms of the mixing index (MI), and it is shown that immediately ahead of the microheater, the MI exceeds 95% for side-by-side flowing of water at different overall flowrates, namely 4, 10, and 20 uL/min. Interpreting the experimental results, supplemented by scaling arguments, we quantitatively describe the ephemeral role of emerging elongated bubbles in the micromixing process in which the Marangoni as well as Weber numbers are recognized as the characteristic local non-dimensional groups while the enhancing role of tiny daughter microbubbles on the micromixing downstream of the microchannel can be reflected in the Peclet and the Capillary numbers.

Title: Extended mean-field theories for networks of real neurons
Authors: Luca Di Carlo, Francesca Mignacco, Christopher W. Lynn, William Bialek
Abstract: If the behavior of a system with many degrees of freedom can be captured by a small number of collective variables, then plausibly there is an underlying mean-field theory. We show that simple versions of this idea fail to describe the patterns of activity in networks of real neurons. An extended mean-field theory that matches the distribution of collective variables is at least consistent, though shows signs that these networks are poised near a critical point, in agreement with other observations. These results suggest a path to analysis of emerging data on ever larger numbers of neurons.

Title: Fine features of entanglement dynamics in quenches across the Ising quantum critical point
Authors: Aditya Banerjee
Abstract: The task of exploring and understanding important aspects of far-from-equilibrium dynamics of closed and generic quantum many-body systems has received a thrust of attention in recent years, driven partly by remarkable advances in ultracold experimental technologies. In this work, for the paradigmatic Ising spin chain with transverse and longitudinal fields, we present numerical observations of several "fine-grained" features of far-from-equilibrium dynamics, induced by quantum quenches across the Ising critical point, from a quantum informational point of view that have hitherto escaped notice. Rather featureless dynamics is seen for ferromagnetic to paramagnetic quenches, but paramagnetic to ferromagnetic quenches exhibit rich behaviour, including a series of sudden deaths and revivals of entanglement between two spins in the system's bulk, periodic but short-lived occurrences of approximately $1-$uniform states, non-analytic cusps in single-copy entanglement entropy for sufficiently big subsystems, insufficient mixedness and a series of scrambling-$\textit{un}$scrambling of local information between neighboring spins. Moreover, essentially indistinguishable dynamics is seen at very early times between the integrable limit (zero longitudinal field) and non-integrable cases, with the former eventually showing signatures of better mixing and faster approach to equilibration than the latter. These features are expected to hold for quench dynamics across Ising quantum critical points in more complicated systems.

Title: Rydberg Atoms in a Ladder Geometry: Quench Dynamics and Floquet Engineering
Authors: Mainak Pal, Tista Banerjee
Abstract: In recent days, Rydberg atom quantum simulator platforms have emerged as novel quantum simulators for physical systems ranging from condensed matter to particle physics. On a fundamental level, these platforms allow for a direct test of our understanding of the emergence of quantum statistical mechanics starting from the laws of quantum dynamics. In this paper, we investigate the fate of quantum dynamics in a model of Rydberg atoms arranged in a square ladder geometry, with a Rabi frequency $2\Omega$ and a detuning profile which is staggered along the longer direction with amplitude $\Delta$. As the staggering strength $\Delta$ is tuned from $\Delta/\Omega=0\rightarrow\infty$, the model exhibits a wide class of dynamical phenomena, ranging from (i) quantum many-body scars (QMBS) ($\Delta/\Omega \sim 0,1$), (ii) integrability induced slow dynamics and approximate Krylov fractures ($\Delta/\Omega \gg 1$) . Additionally, by leveraging the underlying chiral nature of the spectrum of this model Hamiltonian, it is possible to design Floquet protocols leading to dynamical signatures reminiscent of discrete time-crystalline order and exact Floquet flat bands. Finally, we study the robustness of these dynamical features against imperfections in the implementation of the Floquet protocols, long-range van der Waals interactions and inevitable influences from the environment in the form of pure dephasing and the finite lifetime of the Rydberg excited state.

Abstract: The spectral characterization of quantum emitter luminescence over broad wavelength ranges and fast timescales is important for applications ranging from biophysics to quantum technologies. Here we present the application of time-domain Fourier transform spectroscopy, based on a compact and stable birefringent interferometer coupled to low-dark-count superconducting single-photon detectors, to the study of quantum emitters. We experimentally demonstrate that the system enables spectroscopy of quantum emitters over a broad wavelength interval from the near-infrared to the telecom range, where grating-based spectrometers coupled to InGaAs cameras are typically noisy and inefficient. We further show that the high temporal resolution of single-photon detectors, which can be on the order of tens of picoseconds, enables the monitoring of spin-dependent spectral changes on sub-nanosecond timescales.

Title: Electronic spectra with paramagnon fractionalization in the single band Hubbard model
Authors: Eric Mascot, Alexander Nikolaenko, Maria Tikhanovskaya, Ya-Hui Zhang, Dirk K. Morr, Subir Sachdev
Abstract: We examine the spectral properties of a recently proposed theory of the intermediate temperature pseudogap metal phase of the cuprates. We show that this theory can be obtained from the familiar paramagnon theory of nearly antiferromagnetic metals by fractionalizing the paramagnon into two `hidden' layers of S=1/2 spins. The first hidden layer of spins hybridizes with the electrons as in a Kondo lattice heavy Fermi liquid, while the second hidden layer of spins forms a spin liquid with fractionalized spinon excitations. We compute the imaginary part of the electronic self energy induced by the spinon excitations. The energy and momentum dependence of the photoemission spectrum across the Brillouin zone provides a good match to observations by He et al. in Bi2201 (Science 331, 1579 (2011)) and by Chen et al. in Bi2212 (Science 366, 1099 (2019)).

Title: Inversion Symmetry Breaking in Epitaxial Ultrathin Bi (111) Films
Authors: Hadass S. Inbar, Muhammad Zubair, Jason T. Dong, Aaron N Engel, Connor P. Dempsey, Yu Hao Chang, Shinichi Nishihaya, Shoaib Khalid, Alexei V. Fedorov, Anderson Janotti, Chris J. Palmstrøm
Abstract: Bismuth (Bi) films hold potential for spintronic devices and topological one-dimensional edge transport. Large-area high-quality (111) Bi ultrathin films are grown on InSb (111)B substrates. Strong film-substrate interactions epitaxially stabilize the (111) orientation and lead to inversion symmetry breaking. We resolve the longstanding controversy over the Z_2 topological assignment of bismuth and show that the surface states are topologically trivial. Our results demonstrate that interfacial bonds prevent the semimetal-to-semiconductor transition predicted for freestanding bismuth layers, highlighting the importance of controlled functionalization and surface passivation in two-dimensional materials.

Title: Parsimonious inertial cavitation rheometry via bubble collapse time
Authors: Zhiren Zhu, Sawyer Remillard, Bachir A. Abeid, Danila Frolkin, Spencer H. Bryngelson, Jin Yang, Mauro Rodriguez Jr., Jonathan B. Estrada
Abstract: The rapid and accurate characterization of soft, viscoelastic materials at high strain rates is of interest in biological and engineering applications. Examples include assessing the extent of tissue ablation during histotripsy procedures and developing injury criteria for the mitigation of blast injuries. The inertial microcavitation rheometry technique (IMR, Estrada et al., 2018) allows for the characterization of local viscoelastic properties at strain rates up to 1E8 per second. However, IMR now typically relies on bright-field videography of a sufficiently translucent sample at >1 million frames per second and a simulation-dependent fit optimization process that can require hours of post-processing. Here, we present an improved IMR-style technique, called parsimonious inertial microcavitation rheometry (pIMR), that parsimoniously characterizes surrounding viscoelastic materials. The pIMR approach uses experimental advancements to estimate the time to first collapse of the laser-induced cavity within approximately 20 ns and a theoretical energy balance analysis that yields an approximate collapse time based on the material viscoelasticity parameters. The pIMR method closely matches the accuracy of the original IMR procedure while decreasing the computational cost from hours to seconds while potentially reducing reliance on ultra-high-speed videography. This technique can enable nearly real-time characterization of soft, viscoelastic hydrogels and biological materials with a numerical criterion assessing the correct choice of model. We illustrate the efficacy of the technique on batches of tens of experiments for both soft hydrogels and fluids.

Title: Quantum Phases in the Honeycomb-Lattice $J_1$--$J_3$ Ferro-Antiferromagnetic Model
Authors: Shengtao Jiang, Steven R. White, A. L. Chernyshev
Abstract: Using large-scale density-matrix renormalization group calculations and minimally augmented spin-wave theory, we demonstrate that the phase diagram of the quantum $S\!=\!\frac12$ $J_1$--$J_3$ ferro-antiferromagnetic model on the honeycomb lattice differs dramatically from the classical one. It hosts the double-zigzag and Ising-z phases as unexpected intermediaries between ferromagnetic and zigzag states that are also extended beyond their classical regions of stability. In broad agreement with quantum order-by-disorder arguments, these collinear phases replace the classical spiral state.

Title: Universal term of Entanglement Entropy in the $π$-flux Hubbard model
Authors: Yuan Da Liao
Abstract: Researchers in physical science aim to uncover universal features in strongly interacting many-body systems, often hidden in complicated observables like entanglement entropy (EE). The non-local nature of EE makes it challenging to compute numerically, necessitating the development of an unbiased and convenient algorithm. In this paper, we use quantum Monte Carlo to reveal that the coefficient of variation in direct EE calculations increases exponentially with system size, leading to inaccuracies. To address this issue, we develop a power incremental algorithm and a technique for straightforwardly calculating the universal term of EE, successfully evaluating the EE of a 2D Hubbard model. Our numerical results demonstrate the consistency of the universal coefficient of EE from sharp corners at the Gross-Neveu quantum critical point and for free Dirac fermions. Our method can also be applied to other unstable observables, such as partition functions, entanglement spectra, and negativity, thereby fostering computational and theoretical progress.

Title: Emergence of nodal Bogoliubov quasiparticles across the transition from the pseudogap metal to the d-wave superconductor
Authors: Maine Christos, Subir Sachdev
Abstract: We model the pseudogap state of the hole- and electron-doped cuprates as a metal with hole and/or electron pocket Fermi surfaces. In the absence of long-range antiferromagnetism, such Fermi surfaces violate the Luttinger requirement of enclosing the same area as free electrons at the same density. Using the Ancilla theory of such a pseudogap state, we describe the onset of conventional $d$-wave superconductivity by the condensation of a charge e Higgs boson transforming as a fundamental under the emergent SU(2) gauge symmetry of a background $\pi$-flux spin liquid. In all cases, we find that the $d$-wave superconductor has gapless Bogoliubov quasiparticles at 4 nodal points on the Brillouin zone diagonals with significant velocity anisotropy, just as in the BCS state. This includes the case of the electron-doped pseudogap metal with only electron pockets centered at wavevectors $(\pi, 0)$, $(0, \pi)$, and an electronic gap along the zone diagonals. Remarkably, in this case too, gapless nodal Bogoliubov quasiparticles emerge within the gap at 4 points along the zone diagonals upon the onset of superconductivity.

Title: Origin of magic angles in twisted bilayer graphene: The magic ring
Authors: Wei-Chen Wang, Feng-Wu Chen, Kuan-Sen Lin, Justin T. Hou, Ho-Chun Lin, Mei-Yin Chou
Abstract: The unexpected discovery of superconductivity and strong electron correlation in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG), a system containing only sp electrons, is considered as one of the most intriguing developments in two-dimensional materials in recent years. The key feature is the emergent flat energy bands near the Fermi level, a favorable condition for novel many-body phases, at the so-called "magic angles". The physical origin of these interesting flat bands has been elusive to date, hindering the construction of an effective theory for the unconventional electron correlation. In this work, we have identified the importance of charge accumulation in the AA region of the moire supercell and the most critical role of the Fermi ring in AA-stacked bilayer graphene. We show that the magic angles can be predicted by the moire periodicity determined by the size of this Fermi ring. The resonant criterion in momentum space makes it possible to coherently combine states on the Fermi ring through scattering by the moire potential, leading to flat bands near the Fermi level. We thus establish the physical origin of the magic angles in TBG and identify the characteristics of one-particle states associated with the flat bands for further many-body investigations.

Title: A study for the energy structure of the Mott system with a low-energy excitation, in terms of the pseudo-gap in HTSC
Authors: Keishichiro Tanaka
Abstract: The Mott system with a low-energy excitation may well constitute the underlying system for high temperature superconductivity (HTSC) of under-doped cuprates. This manuscript explores the above through the Hubbard-1 approximation (the Green function method), especially in terms of its self-energy while evaluating the calculation of self-energy using effective mass ratio. Results show it appears the pseudo-gap of HTSC is due to the self-energy effect on the quasi-particle excitation of the Mott's J.

Title: Mechanical cosmology: simulating scalar fluctuations in expanding Universes using synthetic mechanical lattices
Authors: Brendan Rhyno, Ivan Velkovsky, Peter Adshead, Bryce Gadway, Smitha Vishveshwara
Abstract: Inspired by recent advances in observational astrophysics and continued explorations in the field of analog gravity, we discuss the prospect of simulating models of cosmology within the context of synthetic mechanical lattice experiments. We focus on the physics of expanding Universe scenarios described by the Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric. Specifically, quantizing scalar fluctuations in a background FLRW spacetime leads to a quadratic bosonic Hamiltonian with temporally varying pair production terms. Here we present a mapping that provides a one-to-one correspondence between these classes of cosmology models and feedback-coupled mechanical oscillators. As proof-of-principle, we then perform experiments on a synthetic mechanical lattice composed of such oscillators. We simulate two different FLRW expansion scenarios with Universes dominated by vacuum energy and matter and discuss our experimental results.

Title: Effective single particle theory for active particles using local density fluctuations
Authors: Jayam Joshi, Pawan Kumar Mishra, Shradha Mishra
Abstract: We characterize the dynamic non-equilibrium steady state behavior of active particles using density fluctuations in the system. We analyze the effective local density around a particle in the steady state and numerically calculate its mean, variance and autocorrelation. Thus, using local density and its statistical properties as a temporally correlated stochastic variable, we develop an effective single-particle theoretical model and analytically derive an expression for the particle's diffusivity as a function of the global packing density in the system. Our theory accurately predicts the transport properties of an active particle, validated against numerical simulations. Unlike mean-field theory, which fails at high packing densities due to significant density fluctuations from dynamic cluster formation, our model remains effective across all densities. It also captures the well-known phase transition beyond a critical packing density. The key novelty of our model lies in the introduction of a stochastic local density field, which encapsulates the effect of steric interactions on an active particle and helps predict single-particle behavior in a collection, a feature often absent in standard active matter models. This approach could be useful in experimental setups where fluctuations in local density around a tagged particle are measurable.

Title: Ground state phase diagram and the exotic phases in the spin-1/2 square lattice J1-J2-Jx model
Authors: Jianwei Yang, Zhao Liu, Ling Wang
Abstract: The intricate interplay between frustration and spin chirality has the potential to give rise to unprecedented phases in frustrated quantum magnets. We examine the ground state phase diagram of the spin-1/2 square lattice J1-J2-Jx model by employing critical level crossings and ground state fidelity susceptibility (FS) using exact diagonalization (ED) with full lattice symmetries. Our analysis reveals the evolution of highly symmetric energy levels as a function of J2 at fixed Jx. During a magnetic to non-magnetic phase transition, the precise identification of the phase boundary is achieved through critical level crossings between the gapless excitation of a magnetic phase and the quasi-degenerate ground state of a non-magnet phase. Conversely, a direct transition between two non-magnetic phases is characterized by a FS peak accompanied by an avoided ground state level crossing, serving as a distinctive signal. Within a substantial range of Jx, we identify an anticipated chiral spin liquid (CSL) state and an adjacent nematic spin liquid (NSL) phase with a degeneracy of two on a cylinder. These two phases are demarcated by a nearly vertical boundary line at J2 = 0.65. This critical line terminates at the lower boundary of a magnetic ordered chiral spin solid (CSS) phase. We validate the topological nature of the CSL using the modular S matrix of the minimum entangled states (MES) on a torus, along with the entanglement spectra (ES) of even and odd sectors on a cylinder, employing an SU(2)-symmetric density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method. Furthermore, we delve into a comprehensive discussion on the nature of the NSL, exploring aspects such as ground state degeneracy, the local bond energy landscape, and the singlet and triplet gaps on various tori. These analysis provide substantial evidence supporting the nematic nature of the NSL.

Title: Magnetic nutation: transient separation of magnetization from its angular momentum
Authors: Anulekha De, Julius Schlegel, Akira Lentfert, Laura Scheuer, Benjamin Stadtmüller, Philipp Pirro, Georg von Freymann, Ulrich Nowak, Martin Aeschlimann
Abstract: For nearly 90 years, precession and relaxation processes have been thought to dominate magnetization dynamics. Only recently has it been considered that, on short time scales, an inertia-driven magnetization dynamics should become relevant, leading to additional nutation of the magnetization vector. Here, we trigger magnetic nutation via a sudden excitation of a thin Ni80Fe20 (Permalloy) film with an ultrashort optical pulse, that leads to an abrupt tilting of the effective field acting on the magnetic moments, separating the dynamics of the magnetization from that of its angular momentum. We investigate the resulting magnetization dynamics in the inertial regime experimentally by the time-resolved magneto optical Kerr effect. We find a characteristic oscillation in the Kerr signal in the range of about 0.1 THz superimposed on the precessional oscillations with GHz frequencies. By comparison with atomistic spin dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that this observation cannot be explained by the well-known Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation of motion but can be attributed to inertial contributions leading to nutation of the magnetization vector around its angular momentum. Hence, an optical and non-resonant excitation of inertial magnetization dynamics can trigger and control different magnetic processes, ranging from demagnetization via nutation to precession in a single device. These findings will have profound implications for the understanding of ultrafast spin dynamics and magnetization switching.

Title: Memory-induced long-range order in dynamical systems
Authors: C. Sipling, Y.-H. Zhang, M. Di Ventra
Abstract: Time non-locality, or memory, is a non-equilibrium property shared by all physical systems. Here, we show that memory is sufficient to induce a phase of spatial long-range order (LRO) even if the system's primary dynamical variables are coupled locally. This occurs when the memory degrees of freedom have slower dynamics than the primary degrees of freedom. In addition, such an LRO phase is non-perturbative, and can be understood through the lens of a correlated percolation transition of the fast degrees of freedom mediated by memory. When the two degrees of freedom have comparable time scales, the length of the effective long-range interaction shortens. We exemplify this behavior with a model of locally coupled spins and a single dynamic memory variable, but our analysis is sufficiently general to suggest that memory could induce a phase of LRO in a much wider variety of physical systems.

Title: Spin-filter tunneling detection of antiferromagnetic resonance with electrically-tunable damping
Authors: Thow Min Jerald Cham, Daniel G. Chica, Xiaoxi Huang, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Xavier Roy, Yunqiu Kelly Luo, Daniel C. Ralph
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic spintronics offers the potential for higher-frequency operations and improved insensitivity to magnetic fields compared to ferromagnetic spintronics. However, previous electrical techniques to detect antiferromagnetic dynamics have utilized large, millimeter-scale bulk crystals. Here we demonstrate direct electrical detection of antiferromagnetic resonance in structures on the few-micrometer scale using spin-filter tunneling in PtTe$_2$/bilayer CrSBr/graphite junctions in which the tunnel barrier is the van der Waals antiferromagnet CrSBr. This sample geometry allows not only efficient detection, but also electrical control of the antiferromagnetic resonance through spin-orbit torque from the PtTe$_2$ electrode. The ability to efficiently detect and control antiferromagnetic resonance enables detailed studies of the physics governing these high frequency dynamics.

Title: Learning eigenstates of quantum many-body Hamiltonians within the symmetric subspaces using neural network quantum states
Authors: Shuai-Tin. Bao, Dian Wu, Pan Zhang, Ling Wang
Abstract: The exploration of neural network quantum states has become widespread in the studies of complicated quantum many-body systems. However, achieving high precision remains challenging due to the exponential growth of Hilbert space size and the intricate sign structures. Utilizing symmetries of the physical system, we propose a method to evaluate and sample the variational ansatz within a symmetric subspace. This approach isolates different symmetry sectors, reducing the relevant Hilbert space size by a factor approximately proportional to the size of the symmetry group. It is inspired by exact diagonalization techniques and the work of Choo et al. in Phys. Rev. Lett. 121, 167204 (2018). We validate our method using the frustrated spin-1/2 $J_1$-$J_2$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain and compare its performance to the case without symmetrization. The results indicate that our symmetric subspace approach achieves a substantial improvement over the full Hilbert space on optimizing the ansatz, reducing the energy error by orders of magnitude. We also compare the results on degenerate eigenstates with different quantum numbers, highlighting the advantage of operating within a smaller Hilbert subspace.

Title: Origin of unexpected weak Gilbert damping in the LSMO/Pt bilayer system
Authors: Pritam Das, Pushpendra Gupta, Seung-Cheol Lee, Subhankar Bedanta, Satadeep Bhattacharjee
Abstract: We investigated the Gilbert damping in $La_{0.7}Sr_{0.3}MnO_3$ (LSMO) and $La_{0.7}Sr_{0.3}MnO_3/Pt$ (LSMO/Pt) heterostructures using first-principles calculations and Wannier interpolation techniques. Our work is motivated by recent experimental observations showing smaller Gilbert damping in LSMO/Pt films compared to their reference single-layer LSMO films, despite expectations of enhanced spin-pumping effects in the former. We analyze the electronic structures and transport behaviors, finding that LSMO thin films have a high spin Hall angle ($|\theta_{\mathrm{SH}}|$). However, in LSMO/Pt, the presence of platinum significantly increases longitudinal conductivity, reducing $|\theta_{\mathrm{SH}}|$. Despite the lower $|\theta_{\mathrm{SH}}|$, LSMO/Pt shows a notable anti-damping contribution to Gilbert damping due to a larger spin diffusion length. In contrast, pure LSMO films with large $|\theta_{\mathrm{SH}}|$ exhibit higher damping due to efficient spin-to-charge conversion via a self-induced inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE), as reported in a recent experiment. Finally, this work demonstrates that by fine-tuning the ratio of spin Hall conductivity to longitudinal charge conductivity, it is possible to engineer heterostructures with desired spin-to-charge or charge-to-spin conversion efficiencies even with weaker spin-orbit couplings.

Title: Spin pumping into quantum spin nematic states
Authors: Takuto Ishikawa, Wolfgang Belzig, Takeo Kato
Abstract: We theoretically study spin pumping into a spin-nematic state in a junction system composed of a ferromagnetic insulator and a spin-nematic insulator, described by using the spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic model. We analyze an increase of the Gilbert damping in ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) due to an interfacial exchange coupling within a mean-field theory based on the Schwinger boson method. We find that the two Schwinger bosons contribute in distinct ways to spin pumping. We report a detailed dependence of the spin pumping on a resonant frequency, a magnetic field, and an interface type.

Title: Bootstrapping the Quantum Hall problem
Authors: Qiang Gao, Ryan A. Lanzetta, Patrick Ledwith, Jie Wang, Eslam Khalaf
Abstract: The bootstrap method aims to solve problems by imposing constraints on the space of physical observables, which often follow from physical assumptions such as positivity and symmetry. Here, we employ a bootstrap approach to study interacting electrons in the lowest Landau level by minimizing the energy as a function of the static structure factor subject to a set of constraints, bypassing the need to construct the full many-body wavefunction. This approach rigorously lower bounds the ground state energy, making it complementary to conventional variational upper bounds. We show that the lower bound we obtain is relatively tight, within at most 5\% from the ground state energy computed with exact diagonalization (ED) at small system sizes, and generally gets tighter as we include more constraints. In addition to energetics, our results reproduce the correct power law dependence of the pair correlation function at short distances and the existence of a large entanglement gap in the two-particle entanglement spectra for the Laughlin states at $\nu = 1/3$. We further identify signatures of the composite Fermi liquid state close to half-filling. This shows that the bootstrap approach is capable, in principle, of describing non-trivial gapped topologically ordered, as well as gapless, phases. At the end, we will discuss possible extensions and limitations of this approach. Our work establishes numerical bootstrap as a promising method to study many-body phases in topological bands, paving the way to its application in moiré platforms where the energetic competition between fractional quantum anomalous Hall, symmetry broken, and gapless states remains poorly understood.

Title: Physical aspects of symmetry breaking in Bose gases at thermal equilibrium
Authors: Alexej Schelle
Abstract: The theory of non-interacting Bose gases is supplemented by a numerical quantum field description with a two-dimensional non-local order parameter that allows the modeling of wave-like atomic correlations and interference effects in the limit of low atomic densities. From the present model, it is possible to explain symmetry aspects of non-interacting and very weakly interacting Bose gases in the limit of fluctuating particle numbers, like the forward propagation of time and the relation to the breaking and preservation of phase gauge symmetry in solids. In the present formalism, the propagation of one-directional time arises from the pre-defined and equivalent convergence of independent quantum fields towards the Boltzmann equilibrium, and it is shown that Glauber coherent states are related to the definition of the quantized field. Coherently coupling condensate and non-condensate parts as a direct consequence of the increasing quantum coherence time between the different quantum field components in the Bose gas from cooling to below the critical temperature, the present model describes symmetry breaking, which is originally known from the definition of a specific gauge field from Elitzur's theorem for local gauge fields, as a global physical rather than a purely formal mathematical process.

Title: Enhanced transverse electron transport via disordered composite formation
Authors: Sang J. Park, Hojun Lee, Jongjun M. Lee, Jangwoo Ha, Hyun-Woo Lee, Hyungyu Jin
Abstract: Transverse electron transport in magnetic materials - manifested in effects such as the anomalous Hall and Nernst effects - holds promise for spintronic and thermoelectric applications. While recent advances have focused on enhancing such transport through topological single crystals via intrinsic mechanisms linked to Berry curvature, practical limitations remain due to their mechanical fragility and narrow material scope. Here, we demonstrate a distinct approach for transverse transport enhancement based on composite formation. Using both theoretical modeling and experiments, we show that disordered mixtures of two ferromagnetic materials can exhibit significantly stronger transverse electron deflection than either constituent alone. This enhancement originates from meandering electron pathways created by the disordered mixture of two materials and does not rely on long-range crystalline order. The identified requirements for this mechanism can be broadly satisfied across different material systems, offering a universal and tunable strategy to engineer large transverse responses in structurally robust platforms.

Title: Typical Positivity of Nonequilibrium Entropy Production for Pure States
Authors: Philipp Strasberg, Joseph Schindler
Abstract: We establish that the nonequilibrium dynamics of most pure states gives rise to the same entropy production as that of the corresponding ensemble, provided the effective dimension of the ensemble is large enough. This establishes the positivity of entropy production under a wide variety of nonequilibrium situations. Our results follow from dynamical typicality and suitable continuity properties alone, without relying on non-integrability, and they complement other recent efforts to establish "pure state second laws". An explicit comparison with the distinctively different two-point measurement scheme is also provided.

Title: Inverse Melting of Polar Order in Chemically Substituted BaTiO3
Authors: Yang Zhang, Suk Hyun Sung, Colin B. Clement, Sang-Wook Cheong, Ismail El Baggari
Abstract: In many condensed matter systems, long range order emerges at low temperatures as thermal fluctuations subside. In the presence of competing interactions or quenched disorder, however, some systems can show unusual configurations that become more disordered at low temperature, a rare phenomenon known as "inverse melting". Here, we discover an inverse melting of the polar order in a ferroelectric oxide with quenched chemical disorder (BaTi1-xZrxO3) through direct atomicscale visualization using in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy. In contrast to the clean BaTiO3 parent system in which long range order tracks lower temperatures, we observe in the doped system BaTi1-xZrxO3 that thermally driven fluctuations at high temperature give way to a more ordered state and then to a re-entrant disordered configuration at even lower temperature. Such an inverse melting of the polar order is likely linked to the random field generated by Zr dopants, which modulates the energy landscape arising from the competition between thermal fluctuations and random field pinning potential. These visualizations highlight a rich landscape of order and disorder in materials with quenched disorder, which may be key to understanding their advanced functionalities.

Title: Deformation and adiabatic heating of single crystalline and nanocrystalline Ni micropillars at high strain rates
Authors: Nidhin George Mathews, Matti Lindroos, Johann Michler, Gaurav Mohanty
Abstract: The deformation behavior of single crystal and nanocrystalline nickel were studied using in situ micropillar compression experiments from quasi-static to high strain rates up to 10^3 s-1. Deformation occurred by dislocation slip activity in single crystal nickel whereas extensive grain boundary sliding was observed in nanocrystalline nickel, with a shift towards more inhomogeneous, localized deformation above 1 s-1. The strain rate sensitivity exponent was found to change at higher strain rates for both single crystal and nanocrystalline nickel, while the overall strain rate sensitivity was observed to be of the same value for both. With increasing high strain rate micropillar compression tests being reported, the issue of adiabatic heating in micropillars becomes important. We report crystal plasticity based finite element modeling to estimate the adiabatic heating, spatially resolved within the pillar, at the highest tested strain rates. The simulations predicted a significant temperature rise of up to 200 K in nanocrystalline Ni at the grain boundaries, and 20 K in single crystalline Ni due to strain localization. Transmission Kikuchi Diffraction analysis of nanocrystalline nickel pillar post compression at 10^3 s-1 did not show any grain growth.

Title: Optimizing Hubbard U parameters for Enhanced Description of Electronic and Magnetic Properties in CrI$_3$ Monolayers and Bilayers
Authors: Diego Lauer, Jhon W. González, Eric Suárez Morell, Andrés Ayuela
Abstract: The magnetic properties of CrI$_3$ monolayers, which were recently measured, have been investigated considering electronic repulsion and localization effects in Cr 3d orbitals. In this study, we propose a DFT approach using Hubbard U corrections to improve accuracy. We compare the valence density-of-states using the HSE06 hybrid functional and the DFT+U approach, which includes U parameters for both Cr 3d and I 5p orbitals. The results of our study indicate that the optimal values for U(Cr$_{3d}$) and U(I$_{5p}$) are 3.5 eV and 2.0 eV, respectively. This approach is further applied to improve calculations of electronic and magnetic properties in CrI$_3$ monolayers and, more importantly, in bilayers combined with van der Waals functionals. These refinements hold promise for further studies of complex CrI$_3$ nanostructures, and may also be of interest for other trihalide few-layer systems.

Title: Quantum Delocalization Enables Water Dissociation on Ru(0001)
Authors: Yu Cao, Jiantao Wang, Mingfeng Liu, Yan Liu, Hui Ma, Cesare Franchini, Yan Sun, Georg Kresse, Xing-Qiu Chen, Peitao Liu
Abstract: We revisit the long-standing question of whether water molecules dissociate on the Ru(0001) surface through nanosecond-scale path-integral molecular dynamics simulations on a sizable supercell. This is made possible through the development of an efficient and reliable machine-learning potential with near first-principles accuracy, overcoming the limitations of previous ab initio studies. We show that the quantum delocalization associated with nuclear quantum effects enables rapid and frequent proton transfers between water molecules, thereby facilitating the water dissociation on Ru(0001). This work provides the direct theoretical evidence of water dissociation on Ru(0001), resolving the enduring issue in surface sciences and offering crucial atomistic insights into water-metal interfaces.

Title: Altermagnetic and Noncentrosymmetric Metals
Authors: V.P.Mineev
Abstract: A theory of the normal and superconducting states of piezomagnetic metals, which are altermagnetic materials, has been developed. This has been done in comparison with the corresponding theoretical description for metals that do not have spatial inversion symmetry. Particular attention has been paid to the problem of the anomalous Hall effect, and its absence has been demonstrated in both altermagnetic and non-centrosymmetric metals. It has been shown that the superconducting state in altermagnets always arises by pairing electrons from zones split by spin-orbit interaction, which makes the existence of such superconductors unlikely.

Title: Magnetic properties of Cr$_8$ and V$_8$ molecular rings from ab initio calculations
Authors: Elia Stocco, Maria Barbara Maccioni, Andrea Floris, Matteo Cococcioni
Abstract: Molecular nanomagnets are systems with a vast phenomenology and are very promising for a variety of technological applications, most notably spintronics and quantum information. Their low-energy spectrum and magnetic properties can be modeled using effective spin Hamiltonians, once the exchange coupling parameters between the localized magnetic moments are determined. In this work we employ density functional theory (DFT) to compute the exchange parameters between the atomic spins for two representative ring-shaped molecules containing eight transition-metal magnetic ions: Cr$_8$ and V$_8$. Considering a set of properly chosen spin configurations and mapping their DFT energies on the corresponding expressions from a Heisenberg Hamiltonian, we compute the exchange couplings between magnetic ions which are first, second and further neighbors on the rings. In spite of their chemical and structural similarities the two systems exhibit very different ground states: antiferromagnetic for Cr$_8$, ferromagnetic for V$_8$, which also features non-negligible couplings between second nearest neighbors. A rationalization of these results is proposed that is based on a multi-band Hubbard model with less-than-half filled shells on magnetic ions.

Title: Classification of pair symmetries in superconductors with unconventional magnetism
Authors: Kazuki Maeda, Yuri Fukaya, Keiji Yada, Bo Lu, Yukio Tanaka, Jorge Cayao
Abstract: We consider unconventional magnets with proximity-induced superconductivity and investigate the emergence of superconducting correlations by carrying out a full classification of allowed Cooper pair symmetries. In particular, we focus on $d$-wave altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets under the influence of spin-singlet and spin-triplet superconductivity induced by proximity effect. Under generic conditions, we find that unconventional magnets not only drive a spin-singlet to spin-triplet conversion but also they transfer their parity symmetry that induces superconducting correlations with higher angular momentum. For instance, a conventional spin-singlet $s$-wave superconductor with $d$-wave altermagnetism is able to host odd-frequency mixed spin-triplet $d$-wave superconducting pair amplitudes, while when combining with $p$-wave magnetism the emerging superconducting pairing acquires an even-frequency mixed spin-triplet $p$-wave symmetry. We further demonstrate that unconventional magnetism produces even more exotic superconducting correlations in spin-singlet $d$-wave superconductors, where odd-frequency mixed spin-triplet $g$-wave and even-frequency mixed spin-triplet $f$-wave pair symmetries are possible in altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets, respectively. We also discuss how these ideas generalize to spin-triplet $p$-wave superconductors and also show how our results can be applied to unconventional magnets with higher angular momentum, such as with $f$-, $g$-, and $i$-wave symmetries. Our results can help understand the emergent superconducting correlations due to the interplay of unconventional magnetism and superconductivity.

Title: Orbital textures and evolution of correlated insulating state in monolayer 1T phase transition metal dichalcogenides
Authors: Qiang Gao, Haiyang Chen, Wen-shin Lu, Yang-hao Chan, Zhenhua Chen, Yaobo Huang, Zhengtai Liu, Peng Chen
Abstract: Strong electron-electron interaction can induce Mott insulating state, which is believed to host unusual correlated phenomena such as quantum spin liquid when quantum fluctuation dominates and unconventional superconductivity through doping. Transition metal compounds as correlated materials provide a versatile platform to engineer the Mott insulating state. Previous studies mostly focused on the controlling of the repulsive interaction and bandwidth of the electrons by gating or doping. Here, we performed angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) on monolayer 1T phase NbSe2, TaSe2, and TaS2 and directly observed their band structures with characteristic lower Hubbard bands. By systematically investigating the orbital textures and temperature dependence of the energy gap of the materials in this family, we discovered that hybridization of the chalcogen p states with lower Hubbard band stabilizes the Mott phase via tuning of the bandwidth, as shown by a significant increase of the transition temperature (TC) at a stronger hybridization strength. Our findings reveal a mechanism for realizing a robust Mott insulating phase and establish monolayer 1T phase transition metal dichalcogenide family as a promising platform for exploring correlated electron problems.

Title: Superconducting dome and structural changes in LaRu$_3$Si$_2$ under pressure
Authors: Zhuoqi Li, Shuyuan Huyan, Elizabeth C. Thompson, Tyler J. Slade, Dongzhou Zhang, Young J. Ryu, Wenli Bi, Sergey L. Bud'ko, Paul C. Canfield
Abstract: LaRu$_3$Si$_2$ is of current research interest as a kagome metal with a superconducting transition temperature, $T_c\sim$7 K and higher temperature charge density wave (CDW) orders. Here we report electrical transport and X-ray diffraction measurements on LaRu$_3$Si$_2$ under pressure up to 65 GPa and 35 GPa respectively. The superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ first gets slightly enhanced and reaches a maximum $\sim$8.7 K at $\sim$8.5 GPa. With further applied pressure, $T_c$ is initially gradually suppressed, then more rapidly suppressed, followed by gradual suppression, revealing a superconducting dome. Two possible pressure-induced structural phase transitions are also observed at room temperature, from original hexagonal phase to another hexagonal structure above $\sim$11.5 GPa, and further to a structure with lower symmetry above $\sim$23.5 GPa. These transition pressures roughly correlate with features found in our pressure dependent transport data.

Title: Density-Functional Theory and Triply-Periodic Minimal Surfaces
Authors: Mengdi Yin, Jing Zhang, Dimitri D Vvedensky
Abstract: Several authors have suggested that the surfaces of vanishing potential generated by the electrostatic fields from a distribution of point charges resemble triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS) corresponding to the positions of the point charges. We provide a theoretical basis for this phenomenological comparison by starting with the Boltzmann equation to show that the surface corresponding to zero charge density is a minimal surface. We then use density-functional calculations for elemental materials that differ electronically and structurally, Na, Cu, and Al, to show that surfaces of vanishing charge density converge to the corresponding TPMS.

Title: Jeff = 1/2 Diamond Magnet CaCo2TeO6: A Pathway toward New Spin Physics and Quantum Functions
Authors: Xudong Huai, Luke Pritchard Cairns, Bridget Delles, Michal J. Winiarski, Maurice Sorolla II, Xinshu Zhang, Youzhe Chen, Stuart Calder, Tatenda Kanyowa, Anshul Kogar, Huibo Cao, Danielle Yahne, Robert Birgeneau, James Analytis, Thao T. Tran
Abstract: Diamond lattice magnets, formed by a framework of corner-sharing tetrahedra of magnetic cations, offer unique opportunities to realize novel states of matter for potential utility in information technology. However, research has mostly focused on AB2X4 spinels with Td magnetic ions. This hinders the atomically enabled tunability of competing interactions at different energy scales and the ability to harness many-body electronic states in quantum materials, making the discovery of quantum fluctuations and spin dynamics less accessible. We discover a new material CaCo2TeO6 featuring a diamond lattice of two distinct Oh-Co2+ sites. This material displays strong quantum fluctuations, increased competing magnetic exchange interactions, and field-induced tunability of magnetic structures. The results demonstrate how simple, fundamental refinements in ligand fields can profoundly influence the phase space of quantum matter.

Title: Detection of anyon braiding through pump-probe spectroscopy
Authors: Xu Yang, Ryan Buechele, Nandini Trivedi
Abstract: We show that the braiding of anyons in a quantum spin liquid leaves a distinct dynamical signature in the nonlinear pump-probe response. Using a combination of exact diagonalization and matrix product state techniques, we study the nonlinear pump-probe response of the toric code in a magnetic field, a model which hosts mobile electric $e$ and magnetic $m$ anyonic excitations. While the linear response signal oscillates and decays with time like $\sim t^{-1.3}$, the amplitude of the nonlinear signal for $\chi^{(3)}_{XZZ}$ features a linear-in-time enhancement at early times. The comparison between $\chi^{(3)}_{XZZ}$, which involves the non-trivial braiding of $e$ and $m$ anyons, and $\chi^{(3)}_{XXX}$ that involves the trivial braiding of the same types of anyons, serves to distinguish the braiding statistics of anyons. We support our analysis by constructing a hard-core anyon model with statistical gauge fields to develop further insights into the time dependence of the pump-probe response. Pump-probe spectroscopy provides a distinctive new probe of quantum spin liquid states, beyond the inconclusive broad features observed in single spin flip inelastic neutron scattering.

Title: Prethermalization of light and matter in cavity-coupled Rydberg arrays
Authors: Aleksandr N. Mikheev, Hossein Hosseinabadi, Jamir Marino
Abstract: We explore the dynamics of two-dimensional Rydberg atom arrays coupled to a single-mode optical cavity, employing nonequilibrium diagrammatic techniques to capture nonlinearities and fluctuations beyond mean-field theory. We discover a novel prethermalization regime driven by the interplay between short-range Rydberg interactions and long-range photon-mediated interactions. In this regime, matter and light equilibrate at distinct - and in some cases opposite - effective temperatures, resembling the original concept of prethermalization from particle physics. Our results establish strongly correlated AMO platforms as tools to investigate fundamental questions in statistical mechanics, including quantum thermalization in higher-dimensional systems.

Title: Resistive switching and charge accumulation in Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 nanoparticles

Koptiev, Michail D. Volnyanskii, Valentin V. Laguta, Eugene A. Eliseev, Mikhail P. Trubitsyn, Anna N. Morozovska
Abstract: We revealed the resistive switching, negative differential resistance and charge accumulation effects in Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 nanopowders sintered by the auto-combustion sol-gel method and annealed at temperatures from 500°C to 800°C. The fraction of the orthorhombic phase, determined by the X-ray diffraction (XRD), decreases from 91 vol.% to 7 vol.% with an increase in the annealing temperature from 600°C to 800°C. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra reveal the great amount of oxygen vacancies in the annealed samples, at that the decrease of the orthorhombic phase fraction (observed with an increase in the annealing temperature) correlates with a decrease in the intensity of EPR spectral lines associated with the oxygen vacancies and impurities. This indicates the participation of oxygen vacancies and other defects in the formation of the orthorhombic phase in the Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 powders. To explain the results of electrophysical measurements, we compare the features of the current-voltage characteristics with the phase composition of the Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 powders and with the peculiarities of their EPR spectra. The analysis allows us to relate the resistive switching and charge accumulation observed in Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 nanopowders with the appearance of the ferroelectric-like polar regions in the orthorhombic phase of the nanoparticles, which agrees with the calculations performed in the framework of Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire approach and density functional theory.

Title: Ground-State-Based Model Reduction with Unitary Circuits
Authors: Shengtao Jiang, Steven R. White
Abstract: We present a method to numerically obtain low-energy effective models based on a unitary transformation of the ground state. The algorithm finds a unitary circuit that transforms the ground state of the original model to a projected wavefunction with only the low-energy degrees of freedom. The effective model can then be derived using the unitary transformation encoded in the circuit. We test our method on the one-dimensional and two-dimensional square-lattice Hubbard model at half-filling, and obtain more accurate effective spin models than the standard perturbative approach.

Title: Symmetry-protected topological order identified via Gutzwiller-guided density-matrix-renormalization-group: $\mathrm{SO}(n)$ spin chains
Authors: Pei-Yuan Cai, Hui-Ke Jin, Yi Zhou
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of topological phases in the SO($n$) spin chains using a combination of analytical parton construction and numerical techniques. For even $n=2l$, we identify a novel SPT$^2$ phase characterized by two distinct topological sectors, exhibiting exact degeneracy at the matrix product state (MPS) exactly solvable point. Through Gutzwiller-projected mean-field theory and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations, we demonstrate that these sectors remain topologically degenerate in close chains throughout the SPT$^2$ phase, with energy gaps decaying exponentially with system size. For odd $n=2l+1$, we show that the ground state remains unique in close chains. We precisely characterize critical states using entanglement entropy scaling, confirming the central charges predicted by conformal field theories. Our results reveal fundamental differences between even and odd $n$ cases, provide numerical verification of topological protection, and establish reliable methods for studying high-symmetry quantum systems. The Gutzwiller-guided DMRG is demonstrated to be notably efficient in targeting specific topological sectors.

Title: Motion of ferrodark solitons in harmonically trapped superfluids: spin corrections and emergent quartic potentials exhibiting symmetry breaking
Authors: Jiangnan Biguo, Xiaoquan Yu
Abstract: We propose a framework for topological soliton dynamics in trapped spinor superfluids, decomposing the force acting on the soliton by the surrounding fluid into the buoyancy force and spin-corrections arising from the density depletion at soliton core and the coupling between the orbital motion and the spin mixing, respectively. For ferrodark solitons (FDSs) in spin-1 Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs), the spin correction enables mapping the FDS motion in a harmonic trap to the atomic-mass particle dynamics in an emergent quartic potential. Initially placing a type-I FDS near the trap center, a single-sided oscillation happens, which maps to the particle moving around a local minimum of the emergent double-well potential. As the initial distance of a type-II FDS from the trap center increases, the motion exhibits three regimes: trap-centered harmonic and anharmonic, followed by single-sided oscillations. Correspondingly the emergent quartic potential undergoes symmetry breaking, transitioning from a single minimum to a double-well shape, where particle motion shifts from oscillating around the single minimum to crossing between two minima via the local maximum, then the motion around one of the two minima. In a hard-wall trap with linear potential, the FDS motion maps to a harmonic oscillator.

Title: Fluctuation Bounds for the Restricted Solid-on-Solid Model of Surface Growth
Authors: Timothy Sudijono
Abstract: The restricted solid-on-solid (RSOS) model is a model of continuous-time surface growth characterized by the constraint that adjacent height differences are bounded by a fixed constant. Though the model is conjectured to belong to the KPZ universality class, mathematical progress on the model is very sparse. We study basic properties of the model and establish bounds on surface height fluctuations as a function of time. A linear fluctuation bound is proven for all dimensions, and a logarithmic fluctuation lower bound is given for dimension one. The proofs rely on a new characterization of RSOS as a type of first passage percolation on a disordered lattice, which is of independent interest. The logarithmic lower bound is established by showing equality in distribution to the minimum of a certain dual RSOS process.

Title: Emergent quantum phase transition of a Josephson junction coupled to a high-impedance multimode resonator
Authors: Luca Giacomelli, Cristiano Ciuti
Abstract: The physics of a single Josephson junction coupled to a resistive environment is a long-standing fundamental problem at the center of an intense debate, strongly revived by the advent of superconducting platforms with high-impedance multimode resonators. Here we investigate the emergent criticality of a junction coupled to a multimode resonator when the number of modes is increased. We demonstrate how the multimode environment renormalizes the Josephson and capacitive energies of the junction so that in the thermodynamic limit the charging energy dominates when the impedance is larger than the resistance quantum and is negligible otherwise, independently from the bare ratio between the two energy scales and the compact or extended nature of the phase of the junction. Via exact diagonalization, we find that the transition surprisingly stems from a level anticrossing involving not the ground state, but the first excited state, whose energy gap vanishes in the thermodynamic limit. We clarify the nature of the two phases by pointing at a different behaviour of the ground and excited states and we show that at the transition point the spectrum displays universality not only at low frequencies. In agreement with recent experiments, we reveal striking spectral signatures of the phase transition.

Title: Dynamics and Geometry of Entanglement in Many-Body Quantum Systems
Authors: Peyman Azodi, Herschel A Rabitz
Abstract: A new framework is formulated to study entanglement dynamics in many-body quantum systems along with an associated geometric description. In this formulation, called the Quantum Correlation Transfer Function (QCTF), the system's wave function or density matrix is transformed into a new space of complex functions with isolated singularities. Accordingly, entanglement dynamics is encoded in specific residues of the QCTF, and importantly, the explicit evaluation of the system's time dependence is avoided. Notably, the QCTF formulation allows for various algebraic simplifications and approximations to address the normally encountered complications due to the exponential growth of the many-body Hilbert space with the number of bodies. These simplifications are facilitated through considering the \textit{patterns}, in lieu of the elements, lying within the system's state. Consequently, a main finding of this paper is the exterior (Grassmannian) algebraic expression of many-body entanglement as the collective areas of regions in the Hilbert space spanned by pairs of projections of the wave function onto an arbitrary basis. This latter geometric measure is shown to be equivalent to the second-order Rényi entropy. Additionally, the geometric description of the QCTF shows that characterizing features of the reduced density matrix can be related to experimentally observable quantities. The QCTF-based geometric description offers the prospect of theoretically revealing aspects of many-body entanglement, by drawing on the vast scope of methods from geometry.

Title: Entanglement Propagation in Integrable Heisenberg Chains from a New Lens
Authors: Peyman Azodi, Herschel A Rabitz
Abstract: The exact single-magnon entanglement evolution in Heisenberg chains is obtained using the Quantum Correlation Transfer Function (QCTF) formulation. A dual, i.e., frequency and time-domain, analysis shows that the transient dynamics of individual spins' entanglement is described via a Bessel function of the first kind. Through QCTF, we bypass the evaluation of the full system's state for the purpose of obtaining entanglement. Although it is known that the observable entanglement edge is formed by the arrival of a stream of quasi-particles that travel with the maximum group velocity, we show how the early quasi-particles travel faster than the maximum group velocity of the chain and contribute to entanglement production. Our results can be extended to the multi-magnon regime, therefore opening up the means to better interpret equilibration dynamics and thermodynamics in Heisenberg chains.

Title: A general relativistic kinetic theory approach to linear transport in generic hydrodynamic frame
Authors: Long Cui, Xin Hao, Liu Zhao
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the linear transport of neutral system within the framework of relativistic kinetic theory. Under the relaxation time approximation, we obtain an iterative solution to the relativistic Boltzmann equation in generic stationary spacetime. This solution provides a scheme to study non-equilibrium system order by order. Our calculations are performed in generic hydrodynamic frame, and the results can be reduced to a specific hydrodynamic frame by imposing constraints. As a specific example, we analytically calculated the covariant expressions of the particle flow and the energy momentum tensor up to the first order in relaxation time. Finally and most importantly, we present all 14 kinetic coefficients for a neutral system, which are verified to satisfy the Onsager reciprocal relation in a generic hydrodynamic frame and guarantee a non-negative entropy production in the frame where the first order conservation laws are restored.

Title: Random pure Gaussian states and Hawking radiation
Authors: Erik Aurell, Lucas Hackl, Paweł Horodecki, Robert H. Jonsson, Mario Kieburg
Abstract: A black hole evaporates by Hawking radiation. Each mode of that radiation is thermal. If the total state is nevertheless to be pure, modes must be entangled. Estimating the minimum size of this entanglement has been an important outstanding issue. We develop a new theory of constrained random symplectic transformations, based on that the total state is pure and Gaussian with given marginals. In the random constrained symplectic model we then compute the distribution of mode-mode correlations, from which we bound mode-mode entanglement. Modes of frequency much larger than $\frac{k_B T_{H}(t)}{\hbar}$ are not populated at time $t$ and drop out of the analysis. Among the other modes we find that correlations and hence entanglement between relatively thinly populated modes (early-time high-frequency modes and/or late modes of any frequency) to be strongly suppressed. Relatively highly populated modes (early-time low-frequency modes) can on the other hand be strongly correlated, but a detailed analysis reveals that they are nevertheless very unlikely to be entangled. Our analysis hence establishes that restoring unitarity after a complete evaporation of a black hole does not require any significant quantum entanglement between any pair of Hawking modes. Our analysis further gives exact general expressions for the distribution of mode-mode correlations in random, pure, Gaussian states with given marginals, which may have applications beyond black hole physics.

Title: Quantum speed limit for Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobabilities
Authors: Sagar Silva Pratapsi, Sebastian Deffner, Stefano Gherardini
Abstract: What is the minimal time until a quantum system can exhibit genuine quantum features? To answer this question we derive quantum speed limits for two-time correlation functions arising from statistics of measurements. Generally, these two-time correlators are described by quasiprobabilities, if the initial quantum state of the system does not commute with the measurement observables. Our quantum speed limits are derived from the Heisenberg-Robertson uncertainty relation, and set the minimal time at which a quasiprobability can become non-positive, which is evidence for the onset of non-classical traits in the system dynamics. As an illustrative example, we apply these results to a conditional quantum gate, by determining the optimal condition giving rise to non-classicality at maximum speed. Our analysis also hints at boosted power extraction in genuinely non-classical dynamics.

Title: Magic phase transition and non-local complexity in generalized $W$ State
Authors: A. G. Catalano, J. Odavić, G. Torre, A. Hamma, F. Franchini, S. M. Giampaolo
Abstract: We employ the Stabilizer Renyi Entropy (SRE) to characterize a quantum phase transition that has so far eluded any standard description and can thus now be explained in terms of the interplay between its non-stabilizer properties and entanglement. The transition under consideration separates a region with a unique ground state from one with a degenerate ground state manifold spanned by states with finite and opposite (intensive) momenta. We show that SRE has a jump at the crossing points, while the entanglement entropy remains continuous. Moreover, by leveraging on a Clifford circuit mapping, we connect the observed jump in SRE to that occurring between standard and generalized $W$-states with finite momenta. This mapping allows us to quantify the SRE discontinuity analytically.

Title: Scaling of Computational Order Parameters in Rydberg Atom Graph States
Authors: Zhangjie Qin, V.W. Scarola
Abstract: Graph states are computationally powerful quantum states with many applications including use as resource states for measurement-based quantum computing (MBQC). We demonstrate construction of graph states on a Rydberg atom quantum analogue simulator. We show how an always-on interaction can be used to simultaneously entangle all Rydberg atoms into a graph state. We construct and implement many-body computational order parameters for graph states using non-local measurement-based logic operations in the Clifford group. The order parameters measure the efficacy of entanglement to allow MBQC on graph states of any size. We parameterize finite-size scaling of these order parameters. Our results define a route to efficiently test computational power in quantum devices.

Title: Finite temperature fermionic charge and current densities in conical space with a circular edge
Authors: A. A. Saharian, V. F. Manukyan, T. A. Petrosyan
Abstract: We study the finite temperature and edge induced effects on the charge and current densities for a massive spinor field localized on a 2D conical space threaded by a magnetic flux. The field operator is constrained on a circular boundary, concentric with the cone apex, by the bag boundary condition and by the condition with the opposite sign in front of the term containing the normal to the edge. In two-dimensional spaces there exist two inequivalent representations of the Clifford algebra and the analysis is presented for both the fields realizing those representations. The circular boundary divides the conical space into two parts, referred as interior (I-) and exterior (E-) regions. The radial current density vanishes. The edge induced contributions in the expectation values of the charge and azimuthal current densities are explicitly separated in the both regions for the general case of the chemical potential. They are periodic functions of the magnetic flux and odd functions under the simultaneous change of the signs of magnetic flux and chemical potential. In the E-region all the spinorial modes are regular and the total charge and current densities are continuous functions of the magnetic flux. In the I-region the corresponding expectation values are discontinuous at half-integer values of the ratio of the magnetic flux to the flux quantum. 2D fermionic models, symmetric under the parity and time-reversal transformations (in the absence of magnetic fields) combine two spinor fields realizing the inequivalent representations of the Clifford algebra. The total charge and current densities in those models are discussed for different combinations of the boundary conditions for separate fields. Applications are discussed for electronic subsystem in graphitic cones described by the 2D Dirac model.

Title: Surfacic networks
Authors: Marc Barthelemy, Geoff Boeing, Alain Chiarada, Chris Webster
Abstract: Surfacic networks are structures built upon a two-dimensional manifold. Many systems, including transportation networks and various urban networks, fall into this category. The fluctuations of node elevations imply significant deviations from typical plane networks and require specific tools to understand their impact. Here, we present such tools, including lazy paths that minimize elevation differences, graph arduousness which measures the tiring nature of shortest paths, and the excess effort, which characterizes positive elevation variations along shortest paths. We illustrate these measures using toy models of surfacic networks and empirically examine pedestrian networks in selected cities. Specifically, we examine how changes in elevation affect the spatial distribution of betweenness centrality. We also demonstrate that the excess effort follows a non-trivial power law distribution, with an exponent that is not universal, which illustrates that there is a significant probability of encountering steep slopes along shortest paths, regardless of the elevation difference between the starting point and the destination. These findings highlight the significance of elevation fluctuations in shaping network characteristics. Surfacic networks offer a promising framework for comprehensively analyzing and modeling complex systems that are situated on or constrained to a surface environment.

Title: Engineering-Oriented Design of Drift-Resilient MTJ Random Number Generator via Hybrid Control Strategies

Abstract: Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (MTJs) have shown great promise as hardware sources for true random number generation (TRNG) due to their intrinsic stochastic switching behavior. However, practical deployment remains challenged by drift in switching probability caused by thermal fluctuations, device aging, and environmental instability. This work presents an engineering-oriented, drift-resilient MTJ-based TRNG architecture, enabled by a hybrid control strategy that combines self-stabilizing feedback with pulse width modulation. A key component is the Downcalibration-2 scheme, which updates the control parameter every two steps using only integer-resolution timing, ensuring excellent statistical quality without requiring bit discarding, pre-characterization, or external calibration. Extensive experimental measurements and numerical simulations demonstrate that this approach maintains stable randomness under dynamic temperature drift, using only simple digital logic. The proposed architecture offers high throughput, robustness, and scalability, making it well-suited for secure hardware applications, embedded systems, and edge computing environments.

Title: Critical quantum metrology using non-Hermitian spin model with RT-symmetry
Authors: Keshav Das Agarwal, Tanoy Kanti Konar, Leela Ganesh Chandra Lakkaraju, Aditi Sen De
Abstract: The non-Hermitian transverse $XY$ model with Kaplan-Shekhtman-Entin-Wohlman-Aharony (KSEA) interaction having $\mathcal{RT}$-symmetry, referred to as $iKSEA$ model, possesses both an exceptional point at which eigenvectors coalesce and a quantum critical point where gap-closing occurs. To precisely estimate the magnetic field of the system, we prove that the quantum Fisher information (QFI) of the ground state of the $iKSEA$ model, which is a lower bound of the precision quantified by the root mean square error, scales as $N^2$, with $N$ being the system-size. This provides Heisenberg scaling both at the quantum critical point and the exceptional point in the thermodynamic limit. It indicates that reservoir engineering can provide enhanced precision of system parameters when the system is in contact with the bath, resulting in this non-Hermitian model. Additionally, we demonstrate analytically that, in contrast to Hermitian systems, QFI surpasses the Heisenberg limit and achieves super-Heisenberg scaling ($\sim N^6$), when the strength of the KSEA interaction approaches the anisotropy parameter, permitting competition between non-hermiticity and hermiticity features, as long as the system size is moderate. Moreover, we illustrate that starting from a product state, the non-Hermitian evolving Hamiltonian can create the dynamical state that surpasses the standard quantum limit in the broken regime.

Title: Topological $π/2$ modes in photonic waveguide arrays
Authors: Gang Jiang, Siyuan Zhang, Weiwei Zhu, Y. X. Zhao, Haoran Xue
Abstract: Periodic driving is a powerful tool to generate exotic topological phases without static counterparts, such as the anomalous chiral edge modes from bulk bands with zero Chern number and topological $\pi$ modes exhibiting period-doubled dynamics. Recently, a new class of Floquet topological mode, namely the $\pi/2$ mode, which carries four-period periodicity and has potential applications in quantum computing, was proposed based on a square-root method and realized in an acoustic system. Here we propose a laser-written waveguide array lattice to realize topological $\pi/2$ modes in photonics. Our photonic model simulates a square-root periodically driven Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model and has a rich phase diagram allowing for the co-existence of conventional zero, $\pi$ modes, and the new $\pi/2$ modes. Through numerical simulations of the wave equation, we uncover the unique four-period evolution feature of the $\pi/2$ modes. Our model, which only contains four waveguides per unit cell and two driving steps, is easy to implement with current fabrication techniques and may find applications in quantum optics.
