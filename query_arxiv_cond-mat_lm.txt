Title: Noise induced extreme events in single Fitzhugh-Nagumo oscillator
Authors: S. Hariharan, R. Suresh, V. K. Chandrasekar
Abstract: The FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model serves as a fundamental neuronal model which is extensively studied across various dynamical scenarios, we explore the dynamics of a scalar FHN oscillator under the influence of white noise. Unlike previous studies, in which extreme events (EE) were observed solely in coupled FHN oscillators, we demonstrate that a single system can exhibit EE induced by noise. Perturbation of the deterministic model in its steady state by random fluctuations reveals the emergence of subthreshold/small-amplitude oscillations (SAO), eventually leading to rare and extreme large-amplitude oscillations (LAO), which become particularly evident at minimal noise intensities. We elucidate the route by which these EE emerge, confirming their occurrence through probability calculations of trajectories in phase space. Additionally, our investigation reveals bursting phenomena in the system, which are characterized by specific levels of noise amplitude and elucidated using inter-spike interval statistics. At higher noise amplitudes, frequent LAO production is observed and attributed to self-induced stochastic resonance. The emergence of EE is explained through the theory of large fluctuations, with the escape rates of trajectories estimated via both analytical and numerical approaches. This study is significant because it reveals EE and bursting phenomena in a single FHN oscillator, offering potential new insights into the dynamics of neuronal populations.

Title: Duality viewpoint of noninvertible symmetry protected topological phases
Authors: Weiguang Cao, Masahito Yamazaki, Linhao Li
Abstract: Recent advancements in generalized symmetries have drawn significant attention to gapped phases of matter exhibiting novel symmetries, such as noninvertible symmetries. By leveraging the duality transformations, the classification and construction of gapped phases with noninvertible symmetry can be mapped to those involving conventional group symmetries. We demonstrate this approach by classifying symmetry-protected topological phases with a broad class of noninvertible symmetries in arbitrary spacetime dimensions. Our results reveal new classifications that extend beyond those based on group symmetries. Additionally, we construct lattice models in $(1+1)d$ and $(2+1)d$ that realize these new phases and explore their anomalous interfaces.

Title: Universal electronic structure of layered nickelates via oxygen-centered planar orbitals
Authors: Christine C. Au-Yeung, X. Chen, S. Smit, M. Bluschke, V. Zimmermann, M. Michiardi, P. Moen, J. Kraan, C. S. B. Pang, C. T. Suen, S. Zhdanovich, M. Zonno, S. Gorovikov, Y. Liu, G. Levy, I. S. Elfimov, M. Berciu, G. A. Sawatzky, J. F. Mitchell, A. Damascelli
Abstract: Superconductivity has recently been demonstrated in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ up to 91K under moderate pressure in bulk crystals, and up to 48K at ambient pressure in thin films grown under compressive strain. Key questions remain open regarding the crystal structure and low-energy electronic states that support superconductivity in these compounds. Here we take advantage of the natural polymorphism between bilayer (2222) or alternating monolayer-trilayer (1313) stacking sequences that arises in bulk La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ crystals to identify universal features in this family of materials. Employing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) we observe the fingerprint of a spin-density wave (SDW) instability, strong and coherent enough to modify the electronic structure. We demonstrate that this feature is a `translated' $\beta$ Fermi surface associated with a scattering vector $Q_{t\beta}$ which matches the $Q_{SDW}$ detected by neutron and x-ray scattering experiments. This observation provides an important link between surface and bulk probes, and demonstrates a universal connection between magnetism and fermiology in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ as well as La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. We simulate the spectral weight distribution observed in our ARPES dichroism experiments and establish that the low-energy electronic phenomenology is dominated by oxygen-centered planar orbitals, which -- upon moving along the Fermi surface away from the Ni-O-Ni bond directions -- evolve from the $d_{3x^2-r^2}$ and $d_{3y^2-r^2}$ symmetry characteristic of 3-spin polarons to the familiar $d_{x^2-y^2}$ Zhang-Rice singlets that support high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates. Despite the multiorbital nature of the nickelates, our work establishes an empirical correspondence between the low-energy electronic structure of cuprates and nickelates, thus suggesting a common origin for their unconventional superconductivity.

Title: Direct Observation of Massless Excitons and Linear Exciton Dispersion
Authors: Luna Y. Liu, Steffi Y. Woo, Jinyuan Wu, Bowen Hou, Cong Su, Diana Y. Qiu
Abstract: Excitons -- elementary excitations formed by bound electron-hole pairs -- govern the optical properties and excited-state dynamics of materials. In two-dimensions (2D), excitons are theoretically predicted to have a linear energy-momentum relation with a non-analytic discontinuity in the long wavelength limit, mimicking the dispersion of a photon. This results in an exciton that behaves like a massless particle, despite the fact that it is a composite boson composed of massive constituents. However, experimental observation of massless excitons has remained elusive. In this work, we unambiguously experimentally observe the predicted linear exciton dispersion in freestanding monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) using momentum-resolved electron energy-loss spectroscopy. The experimental result is in excellent agreement with our theoretical prediction based on ab initio many-body perturbation theory. Additionally, we identify the lowest dipole-allowed transition in monolayer hBN to be at 6.6 eV, illuminating a long-standing debate about the band gap of monolayer hBN. These findings provide critical insights into 2D excitonic physics and open new avenues for exciton-mediated superconductivity, Bose-Einstein condensation, and high-efficiency optoelectronic applications.

Title: Axion electrodynamics and giant magnetic birefringence in Weyl excitonic insulators
Authors: Anna Grigoreva, Anton Andreev, Leonid Glazman
Abstract: We study electromagnetic (EM) response of the excitonic insulator phase of time-reversal invariant Weyl semimetals (WSMs). Because of the chiral anomaly and the chiral magnetic effect in the parent WSM, the phase of the exciton condensate couples to the EM fields as a massive dynamical axion. Although the translational symmetry of the WSM is broken in the excitonic insulator state, the axion field is not related to the phase of the sliding exciton density wave. The axion mass is generated by the inter-band matrix elements of electron-electron interactions, and is much smaller than the gap in the single-particle spectrum. Due to the small axion mass, in the presence of a magnetic field, the axion coupling to EM fields produces giant anisotropic polarizability and birefringence. The photon-axion hybridization produces a polariton resonance near the axion gap.

Title: Plasmonic waveguides in two-dimensional materials: a quantum mechanical description using semiclassical techniques
Authors: T. M. Koskamp, M. I. Katsnelson, K. J. A. Reijnders
Abstract: Plasmons are likely to play an important role in integrated photonic ciruits, because they strongly interact with light and can be confined to subwavelength scales. These plasmons can be guided and controlled by plasmonic waveguides, which can be created by patterning different materials or by structuring the dielectric environment. We have constructed a semi-analytical theory to describe plasmonic waveguides, and, more generally, plasmons in spatially inhomogeneous systems. Our theory employs techniques from semiclassical analysis, and is therefore applicable when the electron wavelength is much smaller than the characteristic length scale of changes in the system parameters. We obtain an effective classical Hamiltonian that describes the dynamics of quantum plasmons, given by the Lindhard function with spatially varying parameters. Adding the wave-like character of the plasmons to the classical trajectories generated by this Hamiltonian, we find two different mechanisms for waveguiding. In the first case, a localized plasmonic state arises due to total internal reflection similar to photonic waveguides. The second mechanism relies on a varying dielectric environment, which locally modifies the screening of the electrons. Here, a quasi-localized state arises due to local changes in the amplitude of the plasmonic excitation. Our results provide a solid basis to understand previous numerical studies.

Title: Viscoelastic tensor and hydrodynamics of altermagnets
Authors: A. A. Herasymchuk, E. V. Gorbar, P. O. Sukhachov
Abstract: We calculate the viscoelasticity tensor for altermagnets and formulate the corresponding hydrodynamic equations. The anisotropy of altermagnetic Fermi surfaces allows for additional terms in the viscoelasticity tensor and is manifested in transport properties including electron and spin flows in a channel and nonlocal responses. In the channel geometry, the altermagnetic spin splitting leads to nontrivial spin density and spin current. Like the electric current, the spin current acquires a Poiseuille profile for no-slip boundary conditions. In nonlocal responses, the altermagnetic anisotropy affects current streamlines and electric potential distributions in the viscous regime. Our results provide signatures of the hydrodynamic transport regime in altermagnets potentially facilitating its experimental studies and discovery.

Title: Universal Anyon Tunneling in a Chiral Luttinger Liquid
Authors: Ramon Guerrero-Suarez, Adithya Suresh, Tanmay Maiti, Shuang Liang, James Nakamura, Geoffrey Gardner, Claudio Chamon, Michael Manfra
Abstract: The edge modes of fractional quantum Hall liquids are described by chiral Luttinger liquid theory. Despite many years of experimental investigation fractional quantum Hall edge modes remain enigmatic with significant discrepancies between experimental observations and detailed predictions of chiral Luttinger liquid theory. Here we report measurements of tunneling conductance between counterpropagating edge modes at $\nu=1/3$ across a quantum point contact fabricated on an AlGaAs/GaAs heterostructure designed to promote a sharp confinement potential. We present evidence for tunneling of anyons through an $\nu=1/3$ incompressible liquid that exhibits universal scaling behavior with respect to temperature, source-drain bias, and barrier transmission, as originally proposed by Wen[1,2]. We measure the tunneling exponent $g = 0.334 \pm 0.001$, consistent with the scaling dimension $\Delta = g/2 = 1/6$ for a Laughlin quasiparticle at the edge. When combined with measurements of the fractional charge $e^*=e/3$ and the recently observed anyonic statistical angle $\theta_a=\frac{2\pi}{3}$, the measured tunneling exponent fully characterizes the topological order of the primary Laughlin state at $\nu=1/3$.

Title: Mean-field approximation and phase transitions in an Ising-voter model on directed regular random graphs
Authors: Adam Lipowski, Antonio Luis Ferreira, Dorota Lipowska, Aleksandra Napierala-Batygolska
Abstract: It is known that on directed graphs, the correlations between neighbours of a given site vanish and thus simple mean-field-like arguments can be used to describe exactly the behaviour of Ising-like systems. We analyse heterogeneous modifications of such models where a fraction of agents is driven by the voter or the antivoter dynamics. It turns out that voter agents do not affect the dynamics of the model and it behaves like a pure Ising model. Antivoter agents have a stronger impact since they act as a kind of noise, which weakens a ferromagnetic ordering. Only when Ising spins are driven by the heat-bath dynamics, the behaviour of the model is correctly described by the mean-field approximation. The Metropolis dynamics generates some additional correlations that render the mean-field approach approximate. Simulations on annealed networks agree with the mean-field approximation but for the model with antivoters and with the Metropolis dynamics only its heterogeneous version provides such an agreement. Calculation of the Binder cumulant confirms that critical points in our models with the heat-bath dynamics belong to the Ising mean-field universality class. For the Metropolis dynamics, the phase transition is most likely discontinuous, at least for not too many antivoters.

Title: Formation of Frustrated Charge Density Waves in Kagome Metal LuNb$_6$Sn$_6$

Abstract: The charge density wave (CDW), a translational symmetry breaking electronic liquid, plays a pivotal role in correlated quantum materials, such as high-T$_c$ superconductors and topological semimetals. Recently, CDWs that possibly intertwine with superconductivity and magnetism are observed in various kagome metals. However, the nature of CDWs and the role of the Fermi surface (FS) topology in these materials remain an unresolved challenge. In this letter, we reveal the formation of CDWs in the newly discovered kagome metal LuNb$_6$Sn$_6$. We observe a precursor CDW correlation that features a "yield sign"-like hollow triangle diffuse scattering pattern and nearly complete softening of a flat optical phonon band near Q$_H$=(1/3, 1/3, 1/2). The scattering intensity of the precursor CDW displays divergent behavior as decreasing temperature until T$_{CDW}$=70 K, where a competing CDW at Q$_{CDW}$=(1/3, 1/3, 1/3) emerges. Using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, we image the frustrated CDW patterns that show a short phase coherence length about ~20 nm in real space. Combined with first principles calculations, our observations support frustrated lattice interactions that are modulated by the FS topology. These results shed light on the interplay between FS and CDW in quantum materials with nearly degenerate structural deformation patterns.

Title: Orbital-excitation-dominated magnetization dissipation and quantum oscillation of Gilbert damping in Fe films
Authors: Yue Chen, Haoran Chen, Xi Shen, Weizhao Chen, Yi Liu, Yizheng Wu, Zhe Yuan
Abstract: Using first-principles electronic structure calculation, we demonstrate the spin dissipation process in bulk Fe by orbital excitations within the energy bands of pure spin character. The variation of orbitals in the intraband transitions provides an efficient channel to convert spin to orbital angular momentum with spin-orbit interaction. This mechanism dominates the Gilbert damping of Fe below room temperature. The theoretical prediction is confirmed by the ferromagnetic resonance experiment performed on single-crystal Fe(001) films. A significant thickness-dependent damping oscillation is found at low temperature induced by the quantum well states of the corresponding energy bands. Our findings not only explain the microscopic nature of the recently reported ultralow damping of Fe-based alloys, but also help for the understanding of the transport and dissipation process of orbital currents.

Title: Order parameter fluctuation effects on current-induced magnetization
Authors: Genta Furuya, Kazumasa Hattori
Abstract: We investigate the impact of order parameter fluctuations on magnetoelectric effects in metallic systems using classical Monte Carlo simulations. We focus on a a chiral quadrupole order in a distorted kagome lattice in a model incorporating conduction electrons and classical orbital moments. The ordered orbital moments break mirror symmetry and couple with the conduction electrons, leading to a current-induced magnetization driven by the quadrupole order. Our findings reveal that order parameter fluctuations significantly affect the current-induced magnetization, strongly suppressing the response over a broad temperature range below the transition temperature. Additionally, we analyze the influence of Fermi surface properties and associated matrix elements on this phenomenon. Our results highlight the crucial role of fluctuation effects, demonstrating a qualitatively distinct temperature dependence of the current-induced magnetization compared to that of the order parameter itself.

Title: Lattice Protein Folding with Variational Annealing
Authors: Shoummo Ahsan Khandoker, Estelle M. Inack, Mohamed Hibat-Allah
Abstract: Understanding the principles of protein folding is a cornerstone of computational biology, with implications for drug design, bioengineering, and the understanding of fundamental biological processes. Lattice protein folding models offer a simplified yet powerful framework for studying the complexities of protein folding, enabling the exploration of energetically optimal folds under constrained conditions. However, finding these optimal folds is a computationally challenging combinatorial optimization problem. In this work, we introduce a novel upper-bound training scheme that employs masking to identify the lowest-energy folds in two-dimensional Hydrophobic-Polar (HP) lattice protein folding. By leveraging Dilated Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) integrated with an annealing process driven by temperature-like fluctuations, our method accurately predicts optimal folds for benchmark systems of up to 60 beads. Our approach also effectively masks invalid folds from being sampled without compromising the autoregressive sampling properties of RNNs. This scheme is generalizable to three spatial dimensions and can be extended to lattice protein models with larger alphabets. Our findings emphasize the potential of advanced machine learning techniques in tackling complex protein folding problems and a broader class of constrained combinatorial optimization challenges.

Title: Eightfold Degenerate Dirac Nodal Line in Collinear Antiferromagnet Mn$_5$Si$_3$
Authors: Victor Mendoza-Estrada, Rafael González-Hernández, Bernardo Uribe, Libor Šmejkal
Abstract: We study the electronic, magnetic, and spin transport properties of the orthorhombic Mn$_{5}$Si$_{3}$ compound in the $AF2$ phase using symmetry analysis and ab-initio calculations. Our ground state energy calculations align with experimental observations, demonstrating that the collinear antiferromagnetic (AFM) order, with Néel vector in the [010] direction, is the most stable magnetic configuration both with and without spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in a bulk lattice geometry. We identified an unconventional eight-fold degenerate Dirac nodal line (DNL) close to the Fermi level, characterized by negligible SOC. This DNL is robustly protected by a unique combination of a pure-spin symmetry and a lattice symmetry together with magnetic space group symmetries. Upon introducing SOC, this degeneracy is reduced to two four-fold DNLs, being protected by the combination of time-reversal, partial translation and nonsymmorphic symmetries within the magnetic space group. We predict also a large intrinsic spin Hall conductivity (SHC) which correlates with the presence of SOC-induced splitting of these eight-fold degenerate DNLs near the Fermi level. These intriguing characteristics position collinear antiferromagnet Mn$_{5}$Si$_{3}$ as a compelling candidate for spintronic applications, particularly in the generation and detection of spin currents, while remaining compatible with modern silicon technology.

Title: Gravity-induced Diffusivity of an Axisymmetric Brownian Particle
Authors: Zhongqiang Xiong, Ryohei Seto, Masao Doi
Abstract: A rigid axisymmetric particle with hydrodynamic anisotropy exhibits gliding motion in a quiescent Newtonian fluid under gravity. When Brownian motion is significant, the orientation of the particle fluctuates during sedimentation. We perform an analytical calculation for this sedimentation process. Our results show that gravity can significantly enhance the spatial diffusion of the particle. In addition to Brownian diffusion, gravity induces an additional apparent diffusivity. This gravity-induced diffusivity increases quadratically with the sedimentation Péclet number in the high Péclet number regime and is further enhanced by hydrodynamic anisotropy when the particle shape deviates from a sphere at a fixed Péclet number. When the centers of mass and buoyancy deviate from the hydrodynamic center, the particle tends to align with the direction of gravity. This alignment reduces the effective translational resistance along the gravity direction, thereby increasing the sedimentation velocity. At a given Péclet number, the horizontal diffusivity exhibits a peak before converging to the normal diffusion constant as the center deviation becomes larger.

Title: Polar Vortex Superstructure and Its Coupling with Correlated Electrons in Quasiperiodic Moire Crystal

Abstract: Nanoscale polar structures are significant for understanding polarization processes in low-dimensional systems and hold potential for developing high-performance electronics. Here, we demonstrate a polar vortex superstructure arising from the reconstructed moiré patterns in twisted bilayer graphene aligned with hexagonal boron nitride. Scanning tunneling microscopy reveals spatially modulated charge polarization, while theoretical simulations indicate that the in-plane polarization field forms an array of polar vortices. Notably, this polar field is gate-tunable, exhibiting an unconventional gate-tunable polar sliding and screening process. Moreover, its interaction with electron correlations in twisted bilayer graphene leads to modulated correlated states. Our findings establish moiré pattern reconstruction as a powerful strategy for engineering nanoscale polar structures and emergent quantum phases in van der Waals materials.

Title: Finite-momentum dielectric function and excitonic effects from time-dependent density-functional theory with dielectrically screened hybrid functionals
Authors: Didarul Alam, Jiuyu Sun, Carsten A. Ullrich
Abstract: This paper studies the performance of time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) for calculating the dielectric function of semiconductors and insulators at finite momentum transfer, comparing against the standard Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE). Specifically, we consider a recently proposed hybrid approach that mixes dielectrically screened exact exchange with a semilocal functional, and we also introduce a new hybrid functional featuring a truncated dielectric screening scheme. The computational effort of these hybrid TDDFT approaches is significantly less than that of the BSE, but they deliver comparable accuracy, as demonstrated for the semiconductors Si and GaN and the wide-band insulator LiF. This opens up possibilities for calculating exciton dispersions and electron energy loss functions efficiently and accurately for a wide range of materials.

Title: First passage time properties of diffusion with a broad class of stochastic diffusion coefficients
Authors: Go Uchida, Hiromi Miyoshi, Hitoshi Washizu
Abstract: Diffusion in a heterogeneous environment or diffusion of a particle that shows conformational fluctuations can be described by Brownian motions with stochastic diffusion coefficients (DCs). In the present study, we investigate first passage time (FPT) properties of diffusion with a broad class of stochastic DCs that are positive and non-zero. We show that for diffusion in one-dimensional semi-infinite domain with an absorbing boundary, the eventual absorption is certain. We also show that compared to diffusion whose DC is the ensemble average of a stochastic DC, in diffusion with the stochastic DC, there are particles that reach the absorbing boundary earlier. The approximate proportion of preceding particles is determined by the probability distribution of the time average of a stochastic DC for a given distance to the absorbing boundary. In addition, when particles begin to reach the absorbing boundary before the time change in a stochastic DC occurs, a stochastic DC with a larger supremum leads to an earlier arrival of particles at the absorbing boundary even if the ensemble averages of stochastic DCs are the same. For ergodic DCs, three more properties are revealed. The mean FPT is infinite. In addition, if particles take a long time to reach the absorbing boundary, the exact proportion of preceding particles is almost zero and the FPT distribution can be approximated by the Lévy-Smirnov distribution. We show that these three properties of diffusion with an ergodic DC result from the convergence of the time average of the DC to the ensemble average. For three-dimensional diffusion with a spherical absorbing boundary, we obtain essentially the same results, except that the eventual absorption is not certain. Our results suggest that fluctuations in a DC play an important role in diffusion-limited reactions triggered by single molecules in physics, chemistry, or biology.

Title: Causal horizon from quantum fluctuations
Authors: Simone Franchini
Abstract: We propose a simple model of quantum void where the flow of time is deduced directly from quantum fluctuations and the consequent particle-antiparticle creations. Given a certain number of space-like separated pair creation events, assumed to happen all at the same initial time, we show that past and future can be foliated into a sequence of adapted manifolds based on how many events causally influence them. We also give an explicit construction for the simplest case of one space dimension.

Title: Melting Points and Formation Free Energies of Carbon Compounds with Sodalite Structure
Authors: Kazuhiro Sano, Kenshin Nato
Abstract: Using first-principles calculations, we investigate the melting temperatures $T_{\rm m}$ and formation free energy of carbon compounds with sodalite structures, $X$C$ _6$, $X$C$ _{10}$, and $X$C$ _{12}$, where $X$ is F, Na, Cl, and so on. These compounds are expected to be phonon-mediated superconductors exhibiting high transition temperatures $T_{\rm c}$ of up to about 100 K. We estimate $T_{\rm m}$ as a function of pressure $P$ by using the first-principles molecular dynamics method and show the results as phase diagrams on the $P$-$T$ plane together with the results of $T_{\rm c}$. It indicates that the $T_{\rm m}$ of NaC$_{\rm 6}$, which has a $T_{\rm c}$ up to about 100 K, is about $1300$ K or more at $P=30$ GPa. Furthermore, the $T_{\rm m}$ of FC$_{\rm 6}$ is about 2200 K even at $P=0$ GPa, where its $T_{\rm c}$ is about 80 K. Similar results are obtained for FC$_{\rm 10}$ and ClC$_{\rm 10}$ systems. These results suggest that some compounds can stably exist as high-temperature superconductors even at room temperature and pressure. To examine the feasibility of synthesizing these compounds, we estimate the formation enthalpies and formation free energies. These results suggest that NaC$_6$ could be formed under a sufficiently high pressure of about 300 GPa and a high temperature of about 6500 K.

Title: Symmetry-Broken Kondo Screening and Zero-Energy Mode in the Kagome Superconductor CsV3Sb5
Authors: Yubing Tu, Zongyuan Zhang, Wenjian Lu, Tao Han, Run Lv, Zhuying Wang, Zekun Zhou, Xinyuan Hou, Ning Hao, Zhenyu Wang, Xianhui Chen, Lei Shan
Abstract: The quantum states of matter reorganize themselves in response to defects, giving rise to emergent local excitations that imprint unique characteristics of the host states. While magnetic impurities are known to generate Kondo screening in a Fermi liquid and Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states in a conventional superconductor, it remains unclear whether they can evoke distinct phenomena in the kagome superconductor AV3Sb5 (where A is K, Rb or Cs), which may host an orbital-antiferromagnetic charge density wave (CDW) state and an unconventional superconducting state driven by the convergence of topology, geometric frustration and electron correlations. In this work, we visualize the local density of states induced near various types of impurities in both the CDW and superconducting phases of CsV3-xMxSb5 (M = Ta, Cr) using scanning tunneling microscopy. We observe Kondo resonance states near magnetic Cr dopants. Notably, unlike in any known metal or CDW compound, the spatial pattern of Kondo screening breaks all in-plane mirror symmetries of the kagome lattice, suggesting an electronic chirality due to putative orbital loop currents. While Cooper pairs show relative insensitivity to nonmagnetic impurities, native V vacancies with weak magnetic moments induce a pronounced zero-bias conductance peak (ZBCP). This ZBCP coexists with trivial YSR states within the superconducting gap and does not split in energy with increasing tunneling transmission, tending instead to saturate. This behavior is reminiscent of signature of Majorana zero modes, which could be trapped by a sign-change boundary in the superconducting order parameter near a V vacancy, consistent with a surface topological superconducting state. Our findings provide a new approach to exploring novel quantum states on kagome lattices.

Title: Spatially anisotropic Kondo resonance intertwined with superconducting gap in kagome metal CsV3-xCrxSb5
Authors: Zichen Huang, Hui Chen, Zhongqin Zhang, Hao Zhang, Zhen Zhao, Ruwen Wang, Haitao Yang, Wei Ji, Ziqiang Wang, Hong-Jun Gao
Abstract: The newly-discovered chromium-based kagome metal CsCr3Sb5 has garnered significant interest due to its strong electron correlations, intertwined orders and potential for unconventional superconductivity under high pressure. However, the nature of superconducting and magnetic interactions during the transition from the parent compound CsV3Sb5 to CsCr3Sb5 remains elusive. Here, we report the discovery of spatially anisotropic Kondo resonance which intertwines with the superconducting gap, facilitated by the introduction of magnetic Cr impurities into the kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5. In addition to the gradual suppression of long-ranged charge-density-wave orders, dilute Cr dopants induce local magnetic moments, giving rise to the emergence of Kondo resonances. In addition, the Kondo resonance forms spatially anisotropic ripple-like structures around the Cr dopants, breaking all local mirror symmetries. This anisotropy arises from the antiferromagnetic coupling between itinerant electrons and the Cr-induced spin-up electrons. Remarkably, as the Kondo screening develops, the coherence peak and depth of superconducting gap with finite zero-energy conductance significantly enhances. It indicates that non-superconducting pairs at the Fermi surface in the parent compound participate in the Kondo effect, effectively screening the magnetic moments of Cr dopants while simultaneously enhancing the superfluid density. Our findings pave a unique pathway for exploring the interplay between superconductivity and local magnetic moments in kagome systems.

Abstract: Interplay of lattice, orbital, and charge degrees of freedom in complex oxide materials has hosted a plethora of exotic quantum phases and physical properties. Recent advances in synthesis of freestanding complex oxide membranes and twisted heterostructures assembled from membranes provide new opportunities for discovery using moiré design with local lattice control. To this end, we designed moiré crystals at the coincidence site lattice condition, providing commensurate structure within the moiré supercell arising from the multi-atom complex oxide unit cell. We fabricated such twisted bilayers from freestanding SrTiO3 membranes and used depth sectioning-based TEM methods to discover ordered charge states at the moiré interface. By selectively imaging SrTiO3 atomic planes at different depths through the bilayer, we clearly resolved the moiré periodic structure at the twisted interface and found that it exhibits lattice-dependent charge disproportionation in the local atomic registry within the moiré supercell. Our density-functional modelling of the twisted oxide interface predicts that these moiré phenomena are accompanied by the emergence of a two-dimensional flat band that can drive new electronic phases. Our work provides a novel guideline for controlling moiré periodicity in twisted oxides and opens pathways to exploit the new functionalities via moiré lattice-driven charge-orbital correlation.

Title: Thermally driven two-sphere microswimmer with internal feedback control
Authors: Jun Li, Ziluo Zhang, Zhanglin Hou, Yuto Hosaka, Kento Yasuda, Linli He, Shigeyuki Komura
Abstract: We discuss the locomotion of a thermally driven elastic two-sphere microswimmer with internal feedback control that is realized by the position-dependent friction coefficients. In our model, the two spheres are in equilibrium with independent heat baths having different temperatures, causing a heat flow between the two spheres. We generally show that the average velocity of the microswimmer is nonzero when the friction coefficients are position-dependent. Using the method of stochastic thermodynamics, we obtain the entropy production rate and discuss the efficiency of the two-sphere microswimmer. The proposed self-propulsion mechanism highlights the importance of information in active matter and can be a fundamental process in various biological systems.

Title: Efimov Effect in Long-range Quantum Spin Chains
Authors: Ning Sun, Lei Feng, Pengfei Zhang
Abstract: When two non-relativistic particles interact resonantly in three dimensions, an infinite tower of three-body bound states emerges, exhibiting a discrete scale invariance. This universal phenomenon, known as the Efimov effect, has garnered extensive attention across various fields, including atomic, nuclear, condensed matter, and particle physics. In this letter, we demonstrate that the Efimov effect also manifests in long-range quantum spin chains. The long-range coupling modifies the low-energy dispersion of magnons, enabling the emergence of continuous scale invariance for two-magnon states at resonance. This invariance is subsequently broken to discrete scale invariance upon imposing short-range boundary conditions for the three-magnon problem, leading to the celebrated Efimov bound states. Using effective field theory, we theoretically determine how the ratio of two successive binding energies depends on the interaction range, which agrees with the numerical solution of the bound-state problem. We further discuss generalizations to arbitrary spatial dimensions, where the traditional Efimov effect serves as a special case. Our results reveal universal physics in dilute quantum gases of magnons that can be experimentally tested in trapped-ion systems.

Title: Enhanced Performance and Stability of Perovskite Solar Cells with Ag-Cu-Zn Alloy Electrodes
Authors: Keshav Kumar Sharma, Ashutosh Ujjwal, Rohit Saini, Ramesh Karuppannan
Abstract: Though the common metal electrode-based perovskite solar cells have achieved a power conversion efficiency of >25%, they also play a crucial role in accelerating the degradation of the cells. In this study, we investigated phase transition engineering in Ag electrodes via Cu and Zn alloying, transforming from a cubic to a tetragonal phase. These alloyed electrodes are then thermally deposited as back electrodes in perovskite solar cells. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of the pure Ag and Ag-Cu-Zn alloys deposited atop a hole-transport layer for use in Cs0.05(FA0.83MA0.17)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3-based solar cells. Our findings reveal that solar cells developed with pure Ag electrodes demonstrate a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.71%, characterized by a fill factor (FF) of 74.8%, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.08 V, and a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 23.17 mA/cm2. Conversely, solar cells fabricated with optimized Ag0.875Cu0.120Zn0.005 electrodes exhibit enhanced performance metrics, with an FF of 72.5%, VOC of 1.12 V, and JSC of 23.39 mA/cm2, culminating in an elevated PCE of 19.02%. Moreover, this electrode demonstrates remarkable durability, sustaining operational integrity for 460 hours for the PSCs stored in the N2 glove box, in contrast to the 320 hours for cells with Ag electrodes. The Ag-Cu-Zn alloys exhibited high resistance to corrosion and good adhesion on the hole-transport material layer compared to a layer of Ag. These advancements may lead to the realization of cost-effective, durable, and efficient solar energy conversion systems.

Title: Unraveling the origin of Kondo-like behavior in the 3$d$-electron heavy-fermion compound YFe$_{2}$Ge$_{2}$
Authors: Bing Xu, Rui Liu, Hongliang Wo, Zhiyu Liao, Shaohui Yi, Chunhong Li, Jun Zhao, Xianggang Qiu, Zhiping Yin, Christian Bernhard
Abstract: The heavy fermion (HF) state of $d$-electron systems is of great current interest since it exhibits various exotic phases and phenomena that are reminiscent of the Kondo effect in $f$-electron HF systems. Here, we present a combined infrared spectroscopy and first-principles band structure calculation study of the $3d$-electron HF compound YFe$_2$Ge$_2$. The infrared response exhibits several charge-dynamical hallmarks of HF and a corresponding scaling behavior that resemble those of the $f$-electron HF systems. In particular, the low-temperature spectra reveal a dramatic narrowing of the Drude response along with the appearance of a hybridization gap ($\Delta \sim$ 50 meV) and a strongly enhanced quasiparticle effective mass. Moreover, the temperature dependence of the infrared response indicates a crossover around $T^{\ast} \sim$ 100 K from a coherent state at low temperature to a quasi-incoherent one at high temperature. Despite of these striking similarities, our band structure calculations suggest that the mechanism underlying the HF behavior in YFe$_2$Ge$_2$ is distinct from the Kondo scenario of the $f$-electron HF compounds and even from that of the $d$-electron iron-arsenide superconductor KFe$_2$As$_2$. For the latter, the HF state is driven by orbital-selective correlations due to a strong Hund's coupling. Instead, for YFe$_2$Ge$_2$ the HF behavior originates from the band flatness near the Fermi level induced by the combined effects of kinetic frustration from a destructive interference between the direct Fe-Fe and indirect Fe-Ge-Fe hoppings, band hybridization involving Fe $3d$ and Y $4d$ electrons, and electron correlations. This highlights that rather different mechanisms can be at the heart of the HF state in $d$-electron systems.

Title: Spin waves in the bilayer van der Waals magnet CrSBr
Authors: Rob den Teuling, Ritesh Das, Artem V. Bondarenko, Elena V. Tartakovskaya, Gerrit E. W. Bauer, Yaroslav M. Blanter
Abstract: We derive analytical expressions for the spin wave frequencies and precession amplitudes in monolayer and antiferromagnetically coupled bilayer CrSBr under in-plane external magnetic fields. The analysis covers the antiferromagnetic, ferromagnetic, and canted phases, demonstrating that the spin wave frequencies in all phases are tunable by the applied magnetic field. We discuss the roles of intra- and interlayer exchange interactions, triaxial anisotropy, and intralayer dynamic dipolar fields in controlling the magnetization dynamics.

Title: PFD: Automatically Generating Machine Learning Force Fields from Universal Models
Authors: Ruoyu Wang, Yuxiang Gao, Hongyu Wu, Zhicheng Zhong
Abstract: Universal force fields generalizable across the periodic table represent a new trend in computational materials science. However, the applications of universal force fields in material simulations are limited by their slow inference speed and the lack of first-principles accuracy. Instead of building a single model simultaneously satisfying these characteristics, a strategy that quickly generates material-specific models from the universal model may be more feasible. Here, we propose a new workflow pattern, PFD, which automatically generates machine-learning force fields for specific materials from a pre-trained universal model through fine-tuning and distillation. By fine-tuning the pre-trained model, our PFD workflow generates force fields with first-principles accuracy while requiring one to two orders of magnitude less training data compared to traditional methods. The inference speed of the generated force field is further improved through distillation, meeting the requirements of large-scale molecular simulations. Comprehensive testing across diverse materials including complex systems such as amorphous carbon, interface, etc., reveals marked enhancements in training efficiency, which suggests the PFD workflow a practical and reliable approach for force field generation in computational material sciences.

Title: Theory of Slidetronics in Ferroelectric van der Waals Layers
Authors: Byeoksong Lee, Minki Lee, Joongoo Kang
Abstract: Vertically stacked layers derived from non-ferroelectric monolayers offer a promising route to two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectrics, where polarization switching occurs via interlayer sliding at sub-unit cell scales. Here, we develop a theory of slidetronics based on the notion that sliding-induced switching $P \rightarrow P'$ can also be achieved by applying an appropriate point-group operator $G$ to the entire system, such that $P' = G P$. Interlayer sliding and the transformation induced by the generator $G$ are thus equivalent in describing the relationship between the initial and final layer configurations. From this symmetry principle, we deduce that slidetronics can be classified by generators $G$; the generator $G$ must act as a symmetry operator for the constituent layers, while it is not a symmetry operator for the stacked layers as a whole; for a given 2D material, $G$ determines the interlayer sliding required for polarization switching; and sliding-induced complete polarization inversion is impossible in bilayers but can be realized in multilayers (e.g., PdSe$_2$ trilayers). These findings provide a framework for designing 2D ferroelectrics with targeted polarization-switching properties, as demonstrated through case studies of real materials.

Title: Effect of substrate temperature on the deposition of Al-doped ZnO thin films using high power impulse magnetron sputtering
Authors: Martin Mickan (GREMI), Ulf Helmersson, David Horwat (IJL)
Abstract: Al-doped ZnO thin films were deposited using reactive high power impulse magnetron sputtering at substrate temperatures between room temperature and 600 $\bullet$ C. Two sample series with different oxygen partial pressures were studied. The films with the lowest resistivity of 3 x 10 -4 $\Omega$cm were deposited at the highest substrate temperature of 600 $\bullet$ C. The improvement of the electrical properties could be related to an improvement of the mobility due to the improved crystallinity. This improved crystallinity also increased the stability of the films towards ambient moisture. On the other hand, the detrimental influence of negative oxygen bombardment could be avoided, as the HiPIMS process can take place in the metal or transition mode even at relatively high oxygen partial pressures.

Authors: Karolina Gutmańska, Agnieszka Podborska, Tomasz Mazur, Andrzej Sławek, Ramesh Sivasamy, Alexey Maximenko, Łukasz Orzeł, Janusz Oszajca, Grażyna Stochel, Konrad Szaciłowski, Anna Dołęga
Abstract: Cyanothiazoles, small and quite overlooked molecules, possess remarkable optical properties that can be fine-tuned through coordination with transition metals. In this study, we investigate a promising application of cyanothiazoles, where their combination with copper(I) iodide forms a new class of complexes exhibiting outstanding optical properties. X-ray crystallography of copper(I) iodide complexes with isomeric cyanothiazoles revealed key structural features, such as {\pi}-{\pi} stacking, hydrogen bonding, and rare halogen-chalcogen I-S interactions, enhancing stability and reactivity. Advanced spectroscopy and computational modeling allowed precise identification of spectral signatures in FTIR, NMR, and UV-Vis spectra. Fluorescence studies, along with XANES synchrotron analyses, highlighted their unique thermal and electronic properties, providing a solid foundation for further research in the field.

Title: Structural Insights and Advanced Spectroscopic Characterization of Thiazolothiazoles: Unveiling Potential for Optoelectronic and Sensing Applications
Authors: Karolina Gutmańska, Agnieszka Podborska, Andrzej Sławek, Ramesh Sivasamy, Lulu Alluhaibi, Alexey Maximenko, Anna Ordyszewska, Konrad Szaciłowski, Anna Dołęga, Tomasz Mazur
Abstract: Thiazolothiazoles (TzTz) represent a class of compounds with distinctive structural motifs and exceptional optical properties, positioning them as promising candidates for breakthroughs in optoelectronic and sensing technologies. X-ray crystallographic analyses of TzTz units symmetrically substituted with functional groups such as imidazole, o-vanillin, p-vanillin, phenyl, thiazole, cinnamate, and bistrifluoromethylphenyl have revealed complex structural features, including {\pi}-{\pi} stacking interactions, hydrogen-bond networks, and specific chalcogen and halogen interactions. These interactions collectively enhance the stability and define the unique spectroscopic profiles of these compounds. Beyond classical spectral fingerprints (FTIR, NMR, and UV-Vis spectra), fluorescence studies at various temperatures, complemented by XANES synchrotron analyses, have underscored their remarkable thermal and electronic properties. The findings presented here offer a comprehensive framework for the characterization and analysis of TzTz compounds, emphasizing their potential as components in smart electronic and optoelectronic devices.

Title: Electrocatalyst discovery through text mining and multi-objective optimization
Authors: Lei Zhang, Markus Stricker
Abstract: The discovery and optimization of high-performance materials is the basis for advancing energy conversion technologies. To understand composition-property relationships, all available data sources should be leveraged: experimental results, predictions from simulations, and latent knowledge from scientific texts. Among these three, text-based data sources are still not used to their full potential. We present an approach combining text mining, Word2Vec representations of materials and properties, and Pareto front analysis for the prediction of high-performance candidate materials for electrocatalysis in regions where other data sources are scarce or non-existent. Candidate compositions are evaluated on the basis of their similarity to the terms `conductivity' and `dielectric', which enables reaction-specific candidate composition predictions for oxygen reduction (ORR), hydrogen evolution (HER), and oxygen evolution (OER) reactions. This, combined with Pareto optimization, allows us to significantly reduce the pool of candidate compositions to high-performing compositions. Our predictions, which are purely based on text data, match the measured electrochemical activity very well.

Title: Thermoelectric effects in two-dimensional topological insulators
Authors: Z.Z. Alisultanov, E.G. Idrisov, A.V. Kavokin
Abstract: We explore the nontrivial thermoelectric properties of two-dimensional topological systems. For the Chern insulator, we show that the Seebeck coefficient is fully determined by the Kelvin formula, while the Nernst coefficient vanishes. For a two-dimensional electron gas with Rashba spin-orbit interactions we reveal how the Berry curvature affects the thermoelectric coefficients, and derive the Mott-like equation for thermopower. We predict a strong variation of the thermopower of a two-dimensional topological insulator with time-reversal symmetry in the ballistic and dissipative regimes. The Kelvin formula applies in the ballistic regime, while the Mott formula holds in the dissipative regime. Importantly, in a system with trapezoidal geometry, the combination of ballistic and dissipative regimes leads to the anomalous Nernst effect. Finally, we analyze a two-dimensional Anderson insulator, where edge modes show distinct temperature behavior of the Seebeck coefficient near the weak localization-strong localization transition temperatures. In the trivial phase, the thermopower exhibits a strong power law temperature dependence, while in the topological phase both power law and exponential dependences coexist.

Title: Stabilization of interfaces for double-cation halide perovskites with AVA2FAPb2I7 additives
Authors: Lev O. Luchnikov, Ekaterina A. Ilicheva, Victor A. Voronov, Prokhor A. Alekseev, Mikhail S. Dunaevskiy, Vladislav Kalinichenko, Vladimir Ivanov, Aleksandra Furasova, Daria A. Krupanova, Ekaterina V. Tekshina, Sergey A. Kozyukhin, Dmitry S. Muratov, Maria I. Voronova, Danila S. Saranin, Eugene I. Terukov
Abstract: The use of mixed cation absorber composition was considered as an efficient strategy to mitigate the degradation effects in halide perovskite solar cells. Despite the reports about partial stabilization at elevated temperatures, unfavorable phase transition after thermocycling and electric field-driven corrosion remains critical bottlenecks of perovskite thin-films semiconductors. In this work, we developed stabilized heterostructures based on CsFAPbI3, modified with mechanically synthesized quasi-2D perovskite incorporating the 5-ammonium valeric acid cation (AVA2FAPb2I7). We found that integration of AVA2FAPb2I7 into grain boundaries boosts phase resilience under harsh thermocycling from -10 up to 100 C and suppresses transitions, as well as decomposition to PbI2. The rapid oxidation of metal contacts in the multi-layer stacks with non-passivated CsFAPbI3 was effectively suppressed in the fabricated heterostructure. A comprehensive interface study of the copper electrode contact revealed that the incorporation of AVA2FAPb2I7 stabilized the lead and iodine states and suppressed contamination of FA cation in ambient conditions. Meanwhile, the metal-perovskite interface remained predominantly in the Cu(0)-Cu(I) state. The observed stabilization in perovskite heterostructure was attributed to an increased activation energy for delta-phase accumulation at the grain boundaries combined with reduced ionic diffusion. The obtained results opened important highlights for the mechanisms of the improved phase stability after thermal cycling and mitigation of the interface corrosion and under an applied electric field.

Title: Superconductivity and pair density waves from nearest-neighbor interactions in frustrated lattice geometries
Authors: Eeli O. Lamponen, Sofia K. Pöntys, Päivi Törmä
Abstract: We consider superconductivity and pair density waves (PDWs) arising from off-site pairing in frustrated lattice geometries. We express the pair susceptibility in a generic form that highlights the importance of both the density of states, and the quantum geometry of the eigenstates and calculate the superfluid weight (stiffness) as well as the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) temperature. Paradigmatic bipartite (Lieb) and non-bipartite (kagome) lattices are studied as examples. For bipartite lattices, nearest-neighbor pairing vanishes in a flat band. In the Lieb lattice flat band, we find a PDW at a finite interaction and show that its pair wave vector is determined by the quantum geometry of the band. In the kagome flat band, nearest-neighbor pairing is possible for infinitesimal interactions. At the kagome van Hove singularity, the pair susceptibility predicts a PDW due to sublattice interference, however, we find that its stiffness is zero due to the shape of the Fermi surface. Our results indicate that nearest-neighbor pairing at flat band and van Hove singularities is strongly influenced by the geometric properties of the eigenfunctions, and it is crucial to determine the superfluid weight of the superconducting and PDW orders as it may contradict the predictions by pairing susceptibility.

Title: Dynamics of transport by helical edge states
Authors: Luis Alberto Razo López, Pierre Wulles, Geoffroy J. Aubry, Sergey E. Skipetrov, Fabrice Mortessagne
Abstract: Topologically nontrivial band structure of a material may give rise to special states that are confined to the material's boundary and protected against disorder and scattering. Quantum spin Hall effect (QSHE) is a paradigmatic example of phenomenon in which such states appear in the presence of time-reversal symmetry in two dimensions. Whereas the spatial structure of these helical edge states has been largely studied, their dynamic properties are much less understood. We design a microwave experiment mimicking QSHE and explore the spatiotemporal dynamics of unidirectional transport of optical angular momentum (or pseudospin) by edge states. Pseudospin-polarized signal propagation is shown to be immune to scattering by defects introduced along the edge. Its velocity is two to three orders of magnitude slower than the speed of light in the free space, which may have important consequences for practical applications of topological edge states in modern optical and quantum-information technologies.

Title: Influence of boundary geometry on active patterns
Authors: Jigyasa Watwani, Sakshi Pahujani, V Jemseena, Vishal Vasan, K Vijay Kumar
Abstract: Mechanochemical patterns arising in the actomyosin cortex drive many cellular processes. Here we consider a hydrodynamic model for the actomyosin cortex of cells and study the sensitivity of the emergent patterns to both physical parameters and the geometry of the confining domain. We first establish a general framework for the Galerkin analysis of such patterns far from the linear stability regime on an arbitrary two-dimensional domain. In the case of a circular disk, our analytical results predict transitions from isotropic to anisotropic patterns upon changing the strength of the active stress and the turnover rate. We confirm the existence of these genuine nonlinear bifurcations by an explicit numerical analysis of our model. Extending our numerical analysis to harmonic deformations of the circular disk, we show that the emergent patterns are also sensitive to the curvature of the domain. In particular, the actomyosin patterns resulting from our study closely resemble those seen in cells confined to micropatterned substrates. Our study demonstrates the role of geometry in controlling patterns within the context of a simple model for the actomyosin cortex.

Title: Noise-to-current ratio divergence as a fingerprint of dispersing Majorana edge modes
Authors: Leo Katayama, Andreas P. Schnyder, Yasuhiro Asano, Satoshi Ikegaya
Abstract: The definitive detection of Majorana modes in topological superconductors is a key issue in condensed matter physics. Here we propose a smoking-gun experiment for the detection of one-dimensional dispersing Majorana edge modes, based on theoretical results for multi-terminal transport in a setup consisting of two normal metal leads and a topological superconductor. In the proposed device, the unpaired nature of the Majorana edge modes inherently leads to the absence of the charge current in the linear response regime, while the current fluctuation remains significant. Therefore, the divergence in the noise-to-current ratio serves as unambiguous evidence for the presence of the dispersing Majorana edge modes. We reach this conclusion analytically, without relying on any specific model of topological superconductors. In addition, using tight-binding models of topological-insulator-based topological superconductors, we numerically verify the predicted divergent noise-to-current ratio. We also discuss the application of our proposal to the CoSi$_2$/TiSi$_2$ heterostructure and the iron-based superconductor FeTe$_{1-x}$Se$_x$.

Title: Large Language Models Are Innate Crystal Structure Generators
Authors: Jingru Gan, Peichen Zhong, Yuanqi Du, Yanqiao Zhu, Chenru Duan, Haorui Wang, Carla P. Gomes, Kristin A. Persson, Daniel Schwalbe-Koda, Wei Wang
Abstract: Crystal structure generation is fundamental to materials discovery, enabling the prediction of novel materials with desired properties. While existing approaches leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) through extensive fine-tuning on materials databases, we show that pre-trained LLMs can inherently generate stable crystal structures without additional training. Our novel framework MatLLMSearch integrates pre-trained LLMs with evolutionary search algorithms, achieving a 78.38% metastable rate validated by machine learning interatomic potentials and 31.7% DFT-verified stability via quantum mechanical calculations, outperforming specialized models such as CrystalTextLLM. Beyond crystal structure generation, we further demonstrate that our framework can be readily adapted to diverse materials design tasks, including crystal structure prediction and multi-objective optimization of properties such as deformation energy and bulk modulus, all without fine-tuning. These results establish pre-trained LLMs as versatile and effective tools for materials discovery, opening up new venues for crystal structure generation with reduced computational overhead and broader accessibility.

Title: Linear magnetoresistance, anomalous Hall effect and de Haas-van Alphen oscillations in antiferromagnetic SmAg$_2$Ge$_2$ single crystals
Authors: Kanchan Bala, Rahul Verma, Shovan Dan, Suman Nandi, Ruta Kulkarni, Bahadur Singh, A. Thamizhavel
Abstract: Understanding the interplay among magnetism, electron correlations, and complex electronic structures in rare-earth materials requires both high-quality single crystals and systematic investigation of their electronic properties. In this study, we have successfully grown a single crystal of SmAg$_2$Ge$_2$ and investigated its anisotropic physical properties and de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) quantum oscillations through experimental and theoretical approaches. SmAg$_2$Ge$_2$ crystallizes in the well known ThCr$_2$Si$_2$-type tetragonal structure with lattice parameters, $a~=~4.226$~Å~ and $c~=~11.051$~Å. Electrical transport and magnetization measurements indicate that it is metallic and exhibit antiferromagnetic ordering below the Néel temperature, $T_{\rm N}$ = 9.2~K. SmAg$_2$Ge$_2$ exhibits a linear non-saturating magnetoresistance, reaching $\sim 97$\% at $2$~K for applied magnetic field $B$~$\parallel~[001]$ and a significant anomalous Hall effect with an anomalous Hall angle of $0.10-0.14$. Additionally, magnetization measurements reveal dHvA quantum oscillations for magnetic fields greater than $8$~T. Our calculated electronic structure, quantum oscillations, and anomalous Hall effect in the canted antiferromagnetic state closely align with experimental results, underscoring the role of complex electronic structure and spin-canting-driven non-zero Berry curvature in elucidating the physical properties of SmAg$_2$Ge$_2$

Title: Ferroelectricity in the nematic liquid crystal under the direct current electric field
Authors: Mateusz Mrukiewicz, Paweł Perkowski, Jakub Karcz, Przemysław Kula
Abstract: We investigated the electrical properties of the liquid crystal compound, known as an RM734, exhibiting a ferroelectric nematic phase. The influence of alternating (AC) and direct (DC) current electric fields on the switching process of the polarization vector and dielectric constant of planarly aligned ferronematic and nematic phases were examined. The decrease of the real part of electric permittivity in the ferronematic phase and the creation of ferroelectric order in the nematic phase under the DC field were demonstrated. The analysis of the results reveals the latching of the ferroelectric state. The applied DC field created a ferroelectric mode in the nematic phase. A new model of collective and molecular relaxations considering the domain structure of the ferronematic phase was proposed. The temperature and DC field dependence of dielectric properties were shown. The spontaneous polarization was measured using the field reversal technique. The spontaneous polarization value exhibits a maximum at the fixed temperature.

Title: Photon-drag photovoltaic effects and quantum geometric nature
Authors: Ying-Ming Xie, Naoto Nagaosa
Abstract: The bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) generates a direct current photocurrent under uniform irradiation and is a nonlinear optical effect traditionally studied in non-centrosymmetric materials. The two main origins of BPVE are the shift and injection currents, arising from transitions in electron position and electron velocity during optical excitation, respectively. Recently, it was proposed that photon-drag effects could unlock BPVE in centrosymmetric materials. However, experimental progress remains limited. In this work, we provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of photon-drag effects inducing BPVE (photon-drag BPVE). Notably, we find that photon-drag BPVE can be directly linked to quantum geometric tensors. Additionally, we propose that photon-drag shift currents can be fully isolated from other current contributions in non-magnetic centrosymmetric materials. We apply our theory explicitly to the 2D topological insulator $1T'$-WTe$_2$. Furthermore, we investigate photon-drag BPVE in a centrosymmetric magnetic Weyl semimetal, where we demonstrate that linearly polarized light generates photon-drag shift currents.

Title: Dual tunability of selective reflection by light and electric field for self-organizing materials
Authors: Mateusz Mrukiewicz, Martin Cigl, Paweł Perkowski, Jakub Karcz, Věra Hamplová, Alexej Bubnov
Abstract: The oblique helicoidal structure is formed in right-angle cholesterics under the applied electric field. The electric field changes the pitch and cone angle but preserves the single-harmonic modulation of the refractive index. As a result, in such a supramolecular system, we can tune the selective reflection of light in a broad range. Here, we report that structural colors can be tuned by simultaneously illuminating the structure with UV light and the action of an electric field. The cholesterics with the oblique helicoidal structure were doped with newly designed rod-like, chiral, and bent-shaped azo-photosensitive materials characterized by a very low rate of thermal back isomerization. The isomerization of the photo-active compounds under UV light causes the red shift of the selective light reflection in the cholesteric mixtures. We found that the molecular structure of the photosensitive materials used affects the reflection coefficient, bandwidth, response time to UV irradiation, and tuning range. The effect was explained by considering the effect of molecular matching, cis-trans isomerization, and electric field action. We investigated the dynamics of molecular changes in the oblique helicoidal structure under the influence of external factors. The designed supramolecular system has the potential application in soft matter UV detectors.

Title: Melting of non reciprocal solids: how dislocations propel and fission in flowing crystals
Authors: Stéphane Guillet, Alexis Poncet, Marine Le Blay, William.T. M Irvine, Vincenzo Vitelli, Denis Bartolo
Abstract: When soft matter is driven out of equilibrium its constituents interact via effective interactions that escape Newton's action-reaction principle. Prominent examples include the hydrodynamic interactions between colloidal particles driven in viscous fluids, phoretic interactions between chemically active colloids, and quorum sensing interactions in bacterial colonies. Despite a recent surge of interest in non-reciprocal physics a fundamental question remains : do non-reciprocal interactions alter or strengthen the ordered phases of matter driven out of equilibrium? Here, through a combination of experiments and simulations, we show how nonreciprocal forces propel and fission dislocations formed in hydrodynamically driven Wigner crystals. We explain how dislocation motility results in the continuous reshaping of grain-boundary networks, and how their fission reaction melts driven crystals from their interfaces. Beyond the specifics of hydrodynamics, we argue theoretically that topological defects and nonreciprocal interactions should invariably conspire to deform and ultimately destroy crystals whose the elementary units defy Newton's third law

Title: The $s\pm$ pairing symmetry in the pressured La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ from electron-phonon coupling
Authors: Yucong Yin, Jun Zhan, Boyang Liu, Xinloong Han
Abstract: The recently discovered bilayer Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ exhibits superconductivity with a remarkable transition temperature $T_c\approx 80 $ K under applied pressures above 14.0 GPa. This discovery of new family of high-temperature superconductors has garnered significant attention in the condensed matter physics community. In this work, we assume the this high-temperature superconductor is mediated by phonons and investigate the pairing symmetry in two distinct models: (i) the full-coupling case, where the Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ and Ni-$d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals are treated equally in both interlayer and intralayer coupling interactions, and (ii) the half-coupling case, where the intralayer coupling involves only the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital, while the interlayer coupling is restricted to the $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital. Our calculations reveal that the interlayer coupling favors an $s\pm$-wave superconducting state, whereas the intralayer coupling promotes an $s++$-wave symmetry. Additionally, we discuss the implications of pair-hopping interactions on the superconducting properties. These findings provide valuable insights into the pairing mechanisms and symmetry of this newly discovered high-temperature superconductor.

Title: Optical response of the supersolid polaron
Authors: Laurent H. A. Simons, Ralf Klemt, Tilman Pfau, Michiel Wouters, Jacques Tempere
Abstract: The ground-state properties of the supersolid polaron consisting of a neutral impurity immersed in a dipolar supersolid have recently been studied. Here, the optical response of an impurity in a dipolar supersolid is calculated and interpreted in terms of the contributions of the different excitation modes of the supersolid. The optical absorption spectrum reveals the two Van Hove singularities that correspond to the flattening of the two Goldstone modes of the supersolid at the Brillouin zone edge. A single peak is found in the superfluid regime corresponding to the roton minimum which diverges at the transition. We propose the response of an ionic impurity as an experimental probe for the supersolid excitations and show how this technique can be extended to neutral impurities with an electric or magnetic dipole moment.

Title: Comparative Analysis of Granular Material Flow: Discrete Element Method and Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics Approaches
Authors: Jaekwang Kim, Hyo-Jin Kim, Hyung-Jun Park
Abstract: We compare two widely used Lagrangian approaches for modeling granular materials: the Discrete Element Method (DEM) and Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). DEM models individual particle interactions, while SPH treats granular materials as a continuum using constitutive rheological models. In particular, we employ the Drucker Prager viscoplastic model for SPH. By examining key parameters unique to each method, such as the coefficient of restitution in DEM and the dilatancy angle in SPH, we assess their influence on two dimensional soil collapse predictions against experimental results. While DEM requires computationally expensive parameter calibration, SPH benefits from a continuum scale rheological model, allowing most parameters to be directly determined from laboratory measurements and requiring significantly fewer particles. However, despite its computational efficiency, viscoplastic SPH struggles to capture complex granular flow behaviors observed in DEM, particularly in rotating drum simulations. In contrast, DEM offers greater versatility, accommodating a broader range of flow patterns while maintaining a relatively simple model formulation. These findings provide valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of each method, aiding the selection of appropriate modeling techniques for granular flow simulations.

Title: Non-Gaussian velocity distributions Maxwell would understand
Authors: J. A. S. Lima, M. H. Benetti
Abstract: In 1988, Constantino Tsallis proposed an extension of the Boltzmann statistical mechanics by postulating a new entropy formula, $S_q = k_B\ln_q W$, where $W$ is the number of microstates accessible to the system, and $\ln_q$ defines a deformation of the logarithmic function. This ``top-down" , approach recovers the celebrated Boltzmann entropy in the limit $q \rightarrow 1$ since $S_1 = k_B\ln W$. However, for $q\neq 1$ the entropy is non-additive and has been successfully applied for a variety of phenomena ranging from plasma physics to cosmology. For a system of particles, Tsallis' formula predicts a large class of power-law velocity distributions reducing to the Maxwellian result only for a particular case. Here a more pedagogical ``bottom-up" path is adopted. We show that a large set of power-law distributions for an ideal gas in equilibrium at temperature T is derived by slightly modifying the seminal Maxwell approach put forward in 1860. The emergence of power-laws velocity distribution is not necessarily related with the presence of long-range interactions. It also shed some light on the long-standing problem concerning the validity of the zeroth law of thermodynamics in this context. Potentially, since the new method highlights the value of hypotheses in the construction of a basic knowledge, it may have an interesting pedagogical and methodological value for undergraduate and graduate students of physics and related areas.

Title: Enhanced Electromechanical Properties of Solution-Processed K$_{0.5}$Na$_{0.5}$NbO$_{3}$ Thin Films
Authors: Nagamalleswara Rao Alluri, Longfei Song, Stephanie Girod, Barnik Mandal, Juliette Cardoletti, Vid Bobnar, Torsten Granzow, Veronika Kovacova, Adrian-Marie Philippe, Emmanuel Defay, Sebastjan Glinsek
Abstract: K$_{0.5}$Na$_{0.5}$NbO$_{3}$ is among the most promising lead-free piezoelectrics. While its sputtered films match the performance of the champion piezoelectric Pb(Zr,Ti)O$_{3}$, processing of high-quality, reproducible, and time-stable solution-processed K$_{0.5}$Na$_{0.5}$NbO$_{3}$ films remains challenging. Here, we report 1 $\mu$m-thick Mn-doped K$_{0.5}$Na$_{0.5}$NbO$_{3}$ films prepared through a chemical solution deposition process, which have perfectly dense microstructure and uniform composition across their thickness. The films exhibit a high transverse piezoelectric coefficient (e$_{31,f}$ = -14.8 C/m$^{2}$), high dielectric permittivity (${\epsilon}_{r}$ = 920), low dielectric losses (tan${\delta}$ = 0.05) and can withstand electric fields up to at least 1 MV/cm. The functional properties show excellent stability over time, and the synthesis process is reproducible. The results demonstrate the high potential of Mn-doped K$_{0.5}$Na$_{0.5}$NbO$_{3}$ films to become a replacement for lead-based Pb(Zr,Ti)O$_{3}$ films in piezoelectric applications.

Title: Critical exponents of the spin glass transition in a field at zero temperature
Authors: Maria Chiara Angelini, Saverio Palazzi, Giorgio Parisi, Tommaso Rizzo
Abstract: We analyze the spin glass transition in a field in finite dimension $D$ below the upper critical dimension directly at zero temperature using a recently introduced perturbative loop expansion around the Bethe lattice solution. The expansion is generated by the so-called $M$-layer construction, and it has $1/M$ as the associated small parameter. Computing analytically and numerically these non-standard diagrams at first order in the $1/M$ expansion, we construct an $\epsilon$-expansion around the upper critical dimension $D_\text{uc}=8$, with $\epsilon=D_\text{uc}-D$. Following standard field theoretical methods, we can write a $\beta$ function, finding a new zero-temperature fixed-point associated with the spin glass transition in a field in dimensions $D<8$. We are also able to compute, at first order in the $\epsilon$-expansion, the three independent critical exponents characterizing the transition, plus the correction-to-scaling exponent.

Authors: Sajjan Sheoran, Pratibha Dev
Abstract: The anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is an efficient tool for detecting the Néel vector in collinear compensated magnets with spin-split bands, known as altermagnets (AMs). Here, we establish design principles for obtaining non-zero anomalous Hall conductivity in the recently proposed two-dimensional (2D) AMs using spin and magnetic group symmetry analysis. We show that only two of the seven nontrivial spin layer groups exhibit an unconventional in-plane AHE in which the Néel vector lies within the plane of the Hall current. Through first-principles simulations on bilayers of MnPSe$_3$ and MnSe, we demonstrate the validity of our group theoretic framework for obtaining AHE with $d$ and $i$-wave altermagnetic orders, depending on the stacking of the bilayers. We find that the spin group symmetry is successful in determining the linear and cubic dependence of anomalous Hall conductivity in Néel vector space, although AHE is a relativistic effect. This work shows that the AHE in 2D AMs can probe the altermagnetic order and Néel vector reversal, thereby facilitating the miniaturization of altermagnetic spintronics.

Title: Single-crystalline CrSb(0001) thin films grown by dc magnetron co-sputtering
Authors: S. P. Bommanaboyena, C. Müller, M. Jarošová, K. Wolk, S. Telkamp, P. Zeng, F. Křížek, K. Olejník, D. Scheffler, K. Beranová, S. Banerjee, M. Ledinský, H. Reichlová, T. Jungwirth, L. Horák, D. Kriegner
Abstract: The recent discovery of altermagnetism has sparked renewed interest in the growth of epitaxial films of the NiAs-phase polymorph of CrSb. This paper describes the magnetron sputtering-based fabrication and characterization of high-quality single crystalline CrSb(0001) thin films supported by an isostructural non-magnetic PtSb buffer. X-ray diffraction and scanning transmission electron microscopy show that the films are phase-pure and possess a very high crystalline quality (mosaicity ~0.05 deg), while also being free of extended crystallographic defects. Both scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy confirm their smooth and homogeneous topography. Additionally, the elemental composition of our films was found to be close to stoichiometric via electron probe microanalysis and X-ray fluorescence. Thus, the developed samples represent an ideal platform for further investigation of the material properties of CrSb.

Title: Extremely large magnetoresistance and chiral anomaly in the nodal-line semimetal ZrAs2
Authors: Junjian Mi, Sheng Xu, Shuxiang Li, Chenxi Jiang, Zheng Li, Qian Tao, Zhu-An Xu
Abstract: We performed the detailed magnetotransport measurements and first principle calculations to study the electronic properties of the transition metal dipnictides ZrAs2, which is a topological nodal-line semimetal. Extremely large unsaturated magnetoresistance (MR) which is up to 1.9 * 10^4 % at 2 K and 14 T was observed with magnetic field along the c-axis. The nonlinear magnetic field dependence of Hall resistivity indicates the multi-band features, and the electron and hole are nearly compensated according to the analysis of the two-band model, which may account for the extremely large unsaturated MR at low temperatures. The evident Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations at low temperatures are observed and four distinct oscillation frequencies are extracted. The first principle calculations and angle-dependent SdH oscillations reveal that the Fermi surface consists of three pockets with different anisotropy. The observed twofold symmetry MR with electric field along the b-axis direction is consistent with our calculated Fermi surface structures. Furthermore, the negative magnetoresistance (NMR) with magnetic field in parallel with electric field is observed, which is an evident feature of the chiral anomaly.

Title: Raman Signatures of Single Point Defects in Hexagonal Boron Nitride Quantum Emitters
Authors: Chanaprom Cholsuk, Asli Cakan, Volker Deckert, Sujin Suwanna, Tobias Vogl
Abstract: Point defects in solid-state quantum systems are vital for enabling single-photon emission at specific wavelengths, making their precise identification essential for advancing applications in quantum technologies. However, pinpointing the microscopic origins of these defects remains a challenge. In this work, we propose Raman spectroscopy as a robust strategy for defect identification. Using density functional theory, we systematically characterize the Raman signatures of 100 defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) spanning periodic groups III to VI, encompassing around 30,000 phonon modes. Our findings reveal that the local atomic environment plays a pivotal role in shaping the Raman lineshape, enabling the narrowing of potential defect candidates. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Raman spectroscopy can differentiate defects based on their spin and charge states as well as strain-induced variations, implying the versatility of this approach. Therefore, this study not only provides a comprehensive theoretical database of Raman spectra for hBN defects but also establishes a novel experiment framework for using tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy to identify point defects. More broadly, our approach offers a universal method for defect identification in any quantum materials.

Title: Synthesis and characterizations of arsenic doped FeSe bulks
Authors: Priya Singh, Manasa Manasa, Mohammad Azam, Tatiana Zajarniuk, Konrad Kwatek, Tomasz Cetner, Andrzej Morawski, Jan Mizeracki, Shiv J. Singh
Abstract: FeSe(11) family has a simple crystal structure belonging to iron-based superconductors (FBS) and has many stable phases including hexagonal and tetragonal structures, but only the tetragonal phase exhibits the superconductivity. In this study, we have investigated the effects of chemical pressure induced by As-doping at Se-sites in the FeSe system by preparing a series of FeSe1-xAsx (x = 0.005, 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2) bulks. A broad characterization has been performed on these samples using structural, microstructural, transport, and magnetic measurements. The obtained lattice parameters are increased by As-doping, which suggests the successful insertion of As at Se-sites into the tetragonal lattice for low doping contents up to 5%, whereas the higher As-substitution appears in the form of the FeAs impurity phase. The temperature dependence of the resistivity of all samples has similar behaviour and depicts the highest onset transition temperature of around 11.5 K, but the zero resistivity is not reached until the measured temperature of 7 K, which could be due to the presence of the impurity phases. Our study suggests that a dopant with a large ionic radius, i.e., Arsenic, promotes the formation of the hexagonal phase of the 11 family and is effective for a small amount of doping level for the superconducting properties, whereas higher As-doping levels reduce the superconducting properties.

Title: Multiple magnetic states, valley electronics, and topological phase transitions in two-dimensional Janus XYZH (X = Sc, Y, La, Y = Cl, Br, I, and Z = S, Se, Te): From monolayers to bilayers
Authors: Xinyu Tian, Zixuan Zhang, Lixiu Guan, Xiaobiao Liu, Xiaoyu Zhao, Linyang Li
Abstract: Exploring the coupling between layer, magnetism, valley, and topology in two-dimensional (2D) materials is an important approach to deepen our understanding of materials properties. We propose 27 stable ferromagnetic semiconductor monolayers of Janus XYZH (X = Sc, Y, La, Y = Cl, Br, I, and Z = S, Se, Te). All these monolayers exhibit spontaneous valley polarization, forming ferrovalley (FV) monolayers, showing anomalous valley Hall (AVH) effect. By applying external strain, the topological phase transitions including quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect can be introduced. In the ScBrSH bilayer system, AA and AB stacking configurations were constructed through interlayer sliding and rotational operation. The bilayer system exhibits interlayer antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering with spontaneous valley polarization differing from the FV observed in monolayers. The sliding ferroelectricity observed in the AA stacking indicates that the system exhibits significant multiferroic characteristics. Further analysis shows that interlayer sliding can introduce a layer polarization anomalous valley Hall (LPAVH) effect, which can be precisely controlled by tuning the direction of the ferroelectric polarization. Upon applying external strain, the quantum layer spin Hall (QLSH) effect observed during the topological phase transition in the bilayer can be regarded as the superposition of two QAH monolayers. Furthermore, applying a twisting operation to the bilayer induces unexpected altermagnetism. Our study systematically reveals the rich physical properties of 2D XYZH materials, providing important theoretical foundations and guidance for the design and development of next-generation quantum devices.

Title: Hidden States and Dynamics of Fractional Fillings in tMoTe2 Moiré Superlattices
Authors: Yiping Wang, Jeongheon Choe, Eric Anderson, Weijie Li, Julian Ingham, Eric A. Arsenault, Yiliu Li, Xiaodong Hu, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Xavier Roy, Dmitri Basov, Di Xiao, Raquel Queiroz, James C. Hone, Xiaodong Xu, X.-Y. Zhu
Abstract: The fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effect was recently discovered in twisted MoTe2 bilayers (tMoTe2). Experiments to date have revealed Chern insulators from hole doping at v = -1, -2/3, -3/5, and -4/7 (per moiré unit cell). In parallel, theories predict that, between v = -1 and -3, there exist exotic quantum phases, such as the coveted fractional topological insulators (FTI), fractional quantum spin Hall (FQSH) states, and non-abelian fractional states. Here we employ transient optical spectroscopy on tMoTe2 to reveal nearly 20 hidden states at fractional fillings that are absent in static optical sensing or transport measurements. A pump pulse selectively excites charge across the correlated or pseudo gaps, leading to the disordering (melting) of correlated states. A probe pulse detects the subsequent melting and recovery dynamics via exciton and trion sensing. Besides the known states, we observe additional fractional fillings between v = 0 and -1 and a large number of states on the electron doping side (v > 0). Most importantly, we observe new states at fractional fillings of the Chern bands at v = -4/3, -3/2, -5/3, -7/3, -5/2, and -8/3. These states are potential candidates for the predicted exotic topological phases. Moreover, we show that melting of correlated states occurs on two distinct time scales, 2-4 ps and 180-270 ps, attributed to electronic and phonon mechanisms, respectively. We discuss the differing dynamics of the electron and hole doped states from the distinct moiré conduction and valence bands.

Title: Bayesian Selection for Efficient MLIP Dataset Selection
Authors: Thomas Rocke, James Kermode
Abstract: The problem of constructing a dataset for MLIP development which gives the maximum quality in the minimum amount of compute time is complex, and can be approached in a number of ways. We introduce a ``Bayesian selection" approach for selecting from a candidate set of structures, and compare the effectiveness of this method against other common approaches in the task of constructing ideal datasets targeting Silicon surface energies. We show that the Bayesian selection method performs much better than Simple Random Sampling at this task (for example, the error on the (100) surface energy is 4.3x lower in the low data regime), and is competitive with a variety of existing selection methods, using ACE and MACE features.

Title: Atomically Modulating Competing Exchange Interactions in Centrosymmetric Skyrmion Hosts GdRu2X2 (X = Si, Ge)
Authors: Dasuni N. Rathnaweera, Xudong Huai, K. Ramesh Kumar, Michal J. Winiarski, Tomasz Klimczuk, Thao T. Tran
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions are topologically protected spin states enabling high-density, low-power spin electronics. Despite growing efforts to find new skyrmion host systems, the microscopic mechanisms leading to skyrmion phase transitions at specific temperatures and magnetic fields remain elusive. Here, we systematically study the isostructural centrosymmetric magnets- GdRu2X2 (X = Si and Ge), and the role of X-p orbitals in modifying magnetic exchange interactions. GdRu2Ge2 single crystals, synthesized by arc melting, exhibit two high-entropy pockets associated with skyrmion phases at 0.9 T < H < 1.2 T and 1.3 T < H < 1.7 T, 2 K < T < 30 K-more accessible condition at lower fields and higher temperatures than that in the Si counterpart. Entropy estimations from heat capacity measurements align with magnetization data, and transport studies confirm a topological Hall effect, highlighting the system's nontrivial spin textures and Berry curvature. Compared to GdRu2Si2, electronic structure and exchange interaction evaluations reveal the more extended Ge-4p orbitals enhance competing exchange interactions in GdRu2Ge2, thereby manifesting the rich skyrmion behavior. This work demonstrates how modifying exchange interactions at the atomic level enables the tunability of topologically nontrivial electronic states while advancing our understanding of skyrmion formation mechanisms for future spintronics.

Title: Holes in silicon are heavier than expected: transport properties of extremely high mobility electrons and holes in silicon MOSFETs

Abstract: The quality of the silicon-oxide interface plays a crucial role in fabricating reproducible silicon spin qubits. In this work we characterize interface quality by performing mobility measurements on silicon Hall bars. We find a peak electron mobility of nearly $40,000\,\text{cm}^2/\text{Vs}$ in a device with a $21\,\text{nm}$ oxide layer, and a peak hole mobility of about $2,000\,\text{cm}^2/\text{Vs}$ in a device with $8\,\text{nm}$ oxide, the latter being the highest recorded mobility for a p-type silicon MOSFET. Despite the high device quality, we note an order-of-magnitude difference in mobility between electrons and holes. By studying additional n-type and p-type devices with identical oxides, and fitting to transport theory, we show that this mobility discrepancy is due to valence band nonparabolicity. The nonparabolicity endows holes with a density-dependent transverse effective mass ranging from $0.6m_0$ to $0.7m_0$, significantly larger than the usually quoted bend-edge mass of $0.22m_0$. Finally, we perform magnetotransport measurements to extract momentum and quantum scattering lifetimes.

Title: Prospection and dispersal in metapopulations: a perspective from opinion dynamics models
Authors: Daniela Molas, Daniel Campos
Abstract: Dispersal is often used by living beings to gather information from conspecifics, integrating it with personal experience to guide decision-making. This mechanism has only recently been studied experimentally, facilitated by advancements in tracking animal groups over extended periods. Such studies enable the analysis of the adaptive dynamics underlying sequential decisions and collective choices. Here, we present a theoretical framework based on the Voter Model to investigate these processes. The model, originally designed to study opinion or behavioral consensus within groups through imitation, is adapted to include the prospection of others' decisions as a mechanism for updating personal criteria. We demonstrate that several properties of our model (such as average consensus times and polarization dynamic) can be analytically mapped onto those of the classical Voter Model under simplifying assumptions. Finally, we discuss the potential of this framework for studying more complex scenarios.

Title: $Δ$-model correction of Foundation Model based on the models own understanding
Authors: Mads-Peter Verner Christiansen, Bjørk Hammer
Abstract: Foundation models of interatomic potentials, so called universal potentials, may require fine-tuning or residual corrections when applied to specific subclasses of materials. In the present work, we demonstrate how such augmentation can be accomplished via $\Delta$-learning based on the representation already embedded in the universal potentials. The $\Delta$-model introduced is a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model and various types of aggregation (global, species-separated, and atomic) of the representation vector are discussed. Employing a specific universal potential, CHGNet [Deng et al., Nat. Mach. Intell. 5, 1031 (2023)], in a global structure optimization setting, we find that it correctly describes the energetics of the "8" Cu oxide, which is an ultra-thin oxide film on Cu(111). The universal potential model even predicts a more favorable structure compared to that discussed in recent DFT-based literature. Moving to sulfur adatom overlayers on Cu(111), Ag(111), and Au(111) the CHGNet model, however, requires corrections. We demonstrate that these are efficiently provided via the GPR-based $\Delta$-model formulated on the CHGNet's own internal atomic embedding representation. The need for corrections is tracked to the scarcity of metal-sulfur atomic environments in the materials project database that CHGNet is trained on leading to an overreliance on sulfur-sulfur atomic environments. Other universal potentials trained on the same data, MACE-MP0, SevenNet-0, and ORB-v2-only-MPtrj show similar behavior, but with varying degrees of error, demonstrating the general need for augmentation schemes for universal potential models.

Title: Approximation of anisotropic pair potentials using multivariate interpolation
Authors: Mohammadreza Fakhraei, Chris A. Kieslich, Michael P. Howard
Abstract: The interaction between two particles with shape or interaction anisotropy can be modeled using a pairwise potential energy function that depends on their relative position and orientation; however, this function is often challenging to mathematically formulate. Data-driven approaches for approximating anisotropic pair potentials have gained significant interest due to their flexibility and generality but often require large sets of training data, potentially limiting their feasibility when training data is computationally demanding to collect. Here, we investigate the use of multivariate polynomial interpolation to approximate anisotropic pair potentials from a limited set of prescribed particle configurations. We consider both standard Chebyshev polynomial interpolation as well as mixed-basis polynomial interpolation that uses trigonometric polynomials for coordinates along which the pair potential is known to be periodic. We exploit mathematical reasoning and physical knowledge to refine the interpolation domain and to design our interpolants. We test our approach on two-dimensional and three-dimensional model anisotropic nanoparticles, finding satisfactory approximations can be constructed in all cases.

Title: Self Consistent Field Theory of isotropic-nematic interfaces and disclinations in a semiflexible molecule nematic
Authors: Longyu Qing, Jorge Viñals
Abstract: A Self Consistent Field Theory description of equilibrium, but non uniform, configurations adopted by semi flexible liquid crystal molecules is presented. Two cases are considered, isotropic-nematic phase boundaries, and topological defects in the nematic phase (disclinations). Nematogens are modeled by worm-like chains, with microscopic interaction potential of the Maier-Saupe type, with an added isotropic excluded volume contribution. The thermodynamic fields obtained by numerical minimization of the free energy are the molecular density and the nematic tensor order parameter. Interfaces with both homeotropic and planar alignment are studied, as well as biaxiality and anisotropy around $\pm 1/2$ disclinations. The effects induced by fluid compressibility, interaction strength, and elastic anisotropy that follows from chain flexibility on both types of non-uniform configurations are discussed. Defect core sizes decrease as the system becomes less compressible, eventually reaching a constant value in the incompressible limit. The core size is influenced by the nematic interaction strength and chain persistence length, decreasing as the order increases in the nematic region through manipulation of persistence length and nematic interaction. Additionally, when the far field nematic order is fixed, the core size increases with the persistence length.

Title: Large Seebeck coefficient driven by "pudding mold" flat band in hole-doped CuRhO$_2$
Authors: Amitayush Jha Thakur, Maximilian Thees, Franck Fortuna, Emmanouil Frantzeskakis, Daisuke Shiga, Hiromichi Kuriyama, Minoru Nohara, Hidenori Takagi, Hiroshi Kumigashira, Andrés F. Santander-Syro
Abstract: We report the measurement, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, of the metallic electronic structure of the hole-doped thermoelectric oxide CuRh$_{0.9}$Mg$_{0.1}$O$_2$. The material is found to have a ``pudding mold'' type band structure, with a nearly flat band edge located near the Fermi level, which is thought to be the origin of the thermoelectric behavior of this material. The experimental data match the density functional theory of the undoped parent compound, simply corrected by a rigid shift of the bands. Transport calculations based on the observed band structure yield a Seebeck coefficient of $\sim 200 \,\mu$V/K for the undoped parent material, consistent with experimental measurements. Our results show that CuRhO$_2$ is a textbook example of how pure band-structural effects can result in a large thermoelectric figure of merit, demonstrating that flat band edges in oxides are a realistic route for the efficient conversion of thermal energy.

Title: Bulk-edge correspondence at the spin-to-integer quantum Hall effect crossover in topological superconductors
Authors: Maksim Parfenov, Igor Burmistrov
Abstract: The spin and integer quantum Hall effects are two cousins of topological phase transitions in two-dimensional electronic systems. Their close relationship makes it possible to transform spin to integer quantum Hall effect in two-dimensional topological superconductors by continuous increase in a symmetry breaking Zeeman magnetic field. We study peculiarities of bulk-edge correspondence and a fate of massless edge and bulk topological (instantons) excitations at such the crossover.

Title: Flexible Tuning of Asymmetric Near-field Radiative Thermal Transistor by Utilizing Distinct Phase Change Materials
Authors: Hexiang Zhang, Xuguang Zhang, Fangqi Chen, Mauro Antezza, Yi Zheng
Abstract: Phase change materials (PCMs) play a pivotal role in the development of advanced thermal devices due to their reversible phase transitions, which drastically modify their thermal and optical properties. In this study, we present an effective dynamic thermal transistor with an asymmetric design that employs distinct PCMs, vanadium dioxide (VO2) and germanium antimony telluride (GST), on either side of the gate terminal, which is the center of the control unit of the near-field thermal transistor. This asymmetry introduces unique thermal modulation capabilities, taking control of thermal radiation in the near-field regime. VO2 transitions from an insulating to a metallic state, while GST undergoes a reversible switch between amorphous (aGST) and crystalline (cGST) phases, each inducing substantial changes in thermal transport properties. By strategically combining these materials, the transistor exhibits enhanced functionality, dynamically switching between states of absorbing and releasing heat by tuning the temperature of gate. This gate terminal not only enables active and efficient thermal management but also provides effective opportunities for manipulating heat flow in radiative thermal circuits. Our findings highlight the potential of such asymmetrically structured thermal transistors in advancing applications across microelectronics, high-speed data processing, and sustainable energy systems, where precise and responsive thermal control is critical for performance and efficiency.

Title: Doping dependence of 2-spinon excitations in the doped 1D cuprate Ba$_2$CuO$_{3+δ}$

Abstract: Recent photoemission experiments on the quasi-one-dimensional Ba-based cuprates suggest that doped holes experience an attractive potential not captured using the simple Hubbard model. This observation has garnered significant attention due to its potential relevance to Cooper pair formation in high-$T_c$ cuprate superconductors. To scrutinize this assertion, we examined signatures of such an attractive potential in doped 1D cuprates Ba$_2$CuO$_{3+\delta}$ by measuring the dispersion of the 2-spinon excitations using Cu $L_3$-edge resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS). Upon doping, the 2-spinon excitations appear to weaken, with a shift of the minimal position corresponding to the nesting vector of the Fermi points, $q_F$. Notably, we find that the energy scale of the 2-spinons near the Brillouin zone boundary is substantially softened compared to that predicted by the Hubbard model in one-dimension. Such a discrepancy implies missing ingredients, which lends support for the presence of an additional attractive potential between holes.

Title: A novel approach to accounting for correlations in evolution over time of an open quantum system
Authors: Victor F. Los (V.G. Baryakhtar Institute of Magnetism of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, Kiev, Ukraine)
Abstract: A projection operator is introduced, which exactly transforms the inhomogeneous Nakajima--Zwanzig generalized master equation for the relevant part of a system +bath statistical operator, containing the inhomogeneous irrelevant term comprising the initial corrrelations, into the homogeneous equation accounting for initial correlations in the kernel governing its evolution. No "molecular chaos"-like approximation has been used. The obtained equation is equivalent to completely closed (homogeneous) equation for the statistical operator of a system of interest interacting with a bath. In the Born approximation (weak system-bath interaction) this equation can be presented as the time-local Redfield-like equation with additional terms caused by initial correlations. As an application, a quantum oscillator, interacting with a Boson field and driven from a Gibbs initial equilibrium system+bath state by an external force, is considered. All terms determining the oscillator evolution over time are explicitly calculated at all timescales. It is shown, how the initial correlations influence the evolution process. It is also demonstrated, that at the large timescale this influence vanishes, and the evolution equation for the quantum oscillator statistical operator acquires the Lindblad form..

Title: Advancing excited-state simulations for TADF emitters: An eXtended Tight-Binding framework for high-throughput screening and design
Authors: Jean-Pierre Tchapet Njafa, Aissatou Maghame, Elvira Vanelle Kameni Tcheuffa, Serge Guy Nana Engo
Abstract: We present a computationally efficient framework for predicting the excited-state properties of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters, integrating extended tight-binding (\xtb), simplified Tamm-Dancoff approximation (\stda), and simplified time-dependent density functional theory (\stddft) methods. Benchmarking against Tamm-Dancoff approximation (noted full \tda) demonstrates that this approach accurately captures key photophysical properties, including singlet-triplet energy gaps, excitation energies, and fluorescence spectra, in both vacuum and solvent environments, while achieving over 99\% reduction in computational cost. We analyze a series of representative TADF emitters, revealing a strong correlation between the torsional angle between donor and acceptor units and the solvent-induced redshift in the emission spectrum. This work highlights the potential of semi-empirical methods for high-throughput screening of TADF materials and provides valuable insights for designing next-generation optoelectronic devices. The multi-objective function is one of a kind, and it further enhances our results with an original solution. While acknowledging the limitations of semi-empirical methods for highly complex systems, we outline promising future directions, including hybrid computational approaches and integration with machine learning techniques, to further improve predictive accuracy and accelerate the discovery of advanced functional materials.

Title: Gapped Phases in (2+1)d with Non-Invertible Symmetries: Part II
Authors: Lakshya Bhardwaj, Sakura Schafer-Nameki, Apoorv Tiwari, Alison Warman
Abstract: We use the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) to systematically characterize gapped phases in 2+1 dimensions with categorical symmetries. The SymTFTs that we consider are (3+1)d Dijkgraaf-Witten (DW) theories for finite groups $G$, whose gapped boundaries realize all so-called ``All Bosonic type" fusion 2-category symmetries. In arXiv:2408.05266 we provided the general framework and studied the case where $G$ is an abelian group. In this work we focus on the case of non-Abelian $G$. Gapped boundary conditions play a central role in the SymTFT construction of symmetric gapped phases. These fall into two broad families: minimal and non-minimal boundary conditions, respectively. The first kind corresponds to boundaries on which all line operators are obtainable as boundary projections of bulk line operators. The symmetries on such boundaries include (anomalous) 2-groups and 2-representation categories of 2-groups. Conversely non-minimal boundaries contain line operators that are intrinsic to the boundaries. The symmetries on such boundaries correspond to fusion 2-categories where modular tensor categories intertwine non-trivially with the above symmetry types. We discuss in detail the generalized charges of these symmetries and their condensation patterns that give rise to a zoo of rich beyond-Landau gapped phases. Among these are phases that exhibit novel patterns of symmetry breaking wherein the symmetry broken vacua carry distinct kinds of topological order. We exemplify this framework for the case where $G$ is a dihedral group.

Title: Pattern Formation in Isothermal Miscible Protein/Sugar Systems Driven by Marangoni Effects and Evaporation
Authors: Yu-Ching Tseng, Chamika Goonetilleke, Xiaotian Lu, Niladri Sekhar Mandal, Ali Borhan, Ayusman Sen
Abstract: Through a combination of experiments and modeling, we have demonstrated a novel pattern formation phenomenon in an isothermal miscible fluid system involving simple protein and sugar solutions. We introduced dye-tagged protein solution into a petri dish with sugar solutions, which had higher density than the added protein solution. Initially, the protein spread and became more uniformly distributed at the air-water interface. Subsequently, it concentrated in specific areas to form spiral patterns. We propose that the mechanism involves an interplay between Marangoni effects, evaporation, and airflow. This finding is unexpected as solute Marangoni-related processes are generally characterized by fast spreading (seconds), while the pattern formation in our systems takes several minutes to form. Our work suggests that Turing reaction-diffusion patterns can be replicated by replacing the reaction-induced inhomogeneous solute distribution by evaporation-induced inhomogeneity. In both cases, the fast diffusive or Marangoni spreading of the solute is counteracted by a slower step that serves to reverse the solute homogenization. In showing that dissipative patterns can form in the absence of thermal gradients or chemical reactions, our findings significantly expand the conditions that lead to pattern formation. The insights gained also enhance our ability to manipulate and control fluid motion and surface morphology, with promising implications for many areas such as coating technologies, materials science, and microfluidics.

Abstract: While the number of detected molecules, particularly complex organic molecules, in the solid-state in astrophysical environments is still rather limited, laboratory experiments and astrochemical models predict many potential candidates. Detection of molecules in protoplanetary disks provides a bridge between the chemical evolution of the interstellar medium and the chemistry of planets and their atmospheres. The excellent spectral sensitivity, broad wavelength coverage and high spatial resolution of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) allows for making progress in exploring chemical compositions of various astrophysical environments including planet-forming disks. They are a prerequisite for probing the disk content by means of sensitive absorption studies. In this paper, we present initial results of the JWST Cycle 1 GO program 1741 on d216-0939, a highly inclined TTauri disk located in the outskirts of the Orion Nebula Cluster. We utilise the NIRSpec and MIRI integral field unit spectrographs to cover its spectrum from 1.7 to 28~$\mu$m. In the d216-0939 disk, we give assignments of the composition of silicate grains. We unambiguously detect solid-state features of H$_2$O, CO$_2$, $^{13}$CO$_2$, CO, OCN$^-$, and tentatively OCS; species that had been detected recently also in other circumstellar disks. For the first time in disks, we provide unique detections of ices carrying NH$_4^+$ and the complex organic molecule ammonium carbamate (NH$_4^+$NH$_2$COO$^-$). The latter detections speak for a very efficient NH$_3$ chemistry in the disk. We also show the very important role of scattering in the analysis of observational spectra of highly inclined disks.

Abstract: Composite light-trapping structures offer a promising approach to achieving broadband absorption and high efficiency in thin-film solar cells (TFSCs) in order to accelerate sustainable energy solutions. As the leading material in thin-film solar technology, cadmium telluride (CdTe) faces challenges from surface reflective losses across the solar spectrum and weak absorption in the near-infrared (NIR) range. This computational study addresses these limitations by employing a dual light trapping technique: the top surfaces of both the CdS and CdTe layers are tapered as nanocones (NCs), while germanium (Ge) spherical nanoparticles (NPs) are embedded within the CdTe absorber layer to enhance broadband absorption. Numerical simulations using Finite-Difference Time Domain (FDTD) and other methods are used to optimize the parameters and configurations of both nanostructures, aiming to achieve peak optoelectronic performance. The results show that a short-circuit current density ($J_{sc}$) of 35.38 mA/$cm^2$ and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 27.76% can be achieved with optimal nanocone (NC) texturing and spherical Ge nanoparticle (NP) configurations, a 45.45% and 80.72% increase compared to baseline structure in $J_{sc}$ and PCE respectively. To understand the enhancement mechanisms, the study includes analyses using diffraction grating theory and Mie theory. Fabricability of these structures is also evaluated. Furthermore, an additional study on the effects of incident angle variation and polarization change demonstrates that the optimal structure is robust under practical conditions, maintaining consistent performance.

Abstract: Interferometry is a fundamental technique in physics, enabling precise measurements through the interference of waves. High-harmonic generation (HHG) in solids has emerged as a powerful method for probing ultrafast electronic dynamics within crystalline structures. In this study, we employed extreme ultraviolet (XUV) high-harmonic interferometry with phase-locked XUV pulse pairs to investigate excitation-induced bandgap dynamics in solids. Our experiments on amorphous SiO2 and crystalline MgO, complemented by analytical modeling and semiconductor Bloch equation simulations, reveal a correlation between transient bandgap modifications and variations in the phase of harmonic emission. These findings suggest a potential pathway for sub-cycle, all-optical control of band structure modifications, advancing prospects for petahertz-scale electronic applications and attosecond diagnostics of carrier dynamics.

Title: Anomalous correlators, negative frequencies and non-phase-invariant Hamiltonians in random waves
Authors: Alberto Villois, Giovanni Dematteis, Yuri V. Lvov, Miguel Onorato, Jalal Shatah
Abstract: We investigate a generic non-phase invariant Hamiltonian model that governs the dynamics of nonlinear dispersive waves. We give evidence that initial data characterized by random phases naturally evolve into phase correlations between positive and negative wavenumbers, leading to the emergence of non-zero anomalous correlators and negative frequencies. Using analytical techniques, we show that anomalous correlators develop on a timescale of $O(1/\epsilon)$, earlier than the kinetic timescale. Our theoretical predictions are validated through direct numerical simulations of the deterministic system.

Title: Evolution and Pathogenicity of SARS-CoVs: A Microcanonical Analysis of Receptor-Binding Motifs
Authors: Rafael B. Frigori
Abstract: The rapid evolution and global impact of coronaviruses, notably SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, underscore the importance of understanding their molecular mechanisms in detail. This study focuses on the receptor-binding motif (RBM) within the Spike protein of these viruses, a critical element for viral entry through interaction with the ACE2 receptor. We investigate the sequence variations in the RBM across SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 and its early variants of concern (VOCs). Utilizing multicanonical simulations and microcanonical analysis, we examine how these variations influence the folding dynamics, thermostability, and solubility of the RBMs. Our methodology includes calculating the density of states (DoS) to identify structural phase transitions and assess thermodynamic properties. Furthermore, we solve the Poisson-Boltzmann equation to model the solubility of the RBMs in aqueous environments. This methodology is expected to elucidate structural and functional differences in viral evolution and pathogenicity, likely improving targeted treatments and vaccines.

Title: Variational Transformer Ansatz for the Density Operator of Steady States in Dissipative Quantum Many-Body Systems
Authors: Lu Wei, Zhian Jia, Yufeng Wang, Dagomir Kaszlikowski, Haibin Ling
Abstract: The transformer architecture, known for capturing long-range dependencies and intricate patterns, has extended beyond natural language processing. Recently, it has attracted significant attention in quantum information and condensed matter physics. In this work, we propose the transformer density operator ansatz for determining the steady states of dissipative quantum many-body systems. By vectorizing the density operator as a many-body state in a doubled Hilbert space, the transformer encodes the amplitude and phase of the state's coefficients, with its parameters serving as variational variables. Our design preserves translation invariance while leveraging attention mechanisms to capture diverse long-range correlations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by numerically calculating the steady states of dissipative Ising and Heisenberg spin chain models, showing that our method achieves excellent accuracy in predicting steady states.

Title: Is chiral supersymmetry emanant or emergent?
Authors: Yu Nakayama
Abstract: The extended Majorana Nicolai model is one of the simplest models of supersymmetry realized on a fermionic chain in $1+1$ dimensions. Within a certain parameter region, the extended theory breaks the supersymmetry spontaneously, but it has a distinguished feature that the general counting rule of the Nambu-Goldstone mode does not apply: we observe twice as many low-energy degrees of freedom than the broken lattice symmetry. We argue that the extra degrees of freedom originate from the spontaneous breaking of the emergent chiral supersymmetry. This chiral supersymmetry becomes an emanant symmetry in the non-interacting limit.

Title: Analysis of Evolving Cortical Neuronal Networks Using Visual Informatics
Authors: Ho Fai Po, Akke Mats Houben, Anna-Christina Haeb, Yordan P. Raykov, Daniel Tornero, Jordi Soriano, David Saad
Abstract: Understanding the nature of the changes exhibited by evolving neuronal dynamics from high-dimensional activity data is essential for advancing neuroscience, particularly in the study of neuronal network development and the pathophysiology of neurological disorders. This work examines how advanced dimensionality reduction techniques can efficiently summarize and enhance our understanding of the development of neuronal networks over time and in response to stimulation. We develop a framework based on the Minimum-Distortion Embedding (MDE) methods and demonstrate how MDE outperforms better known benchmarks based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) by effectively preserving both global structures and local relationships within complex neuronal datasets. Our \emph{in silico} experiments reveal MDE's capability to capture the evolving connectivity patterns of simulated neuronal networks, illustrating a clear trajectory tracking the simulated network development. Complementary \emph{in vitro} experiments further validate MDE's advantages, highlighting its ability to identify behavioral differences and connectivity changes in neuronal cultures over a 35-day observation period. Additionally, we explore the effects of stimulation on neuronal activity, providing valuable insights into the plasticity and learning mechanisms of neuronal networks. Our findings underscore the importance of metric selection in dimensionality reduction, showing that correlation metrics yield more meaningful embeddings compared to Euclidean distance. The implications of this research extend to various areas, including the potential development of therapeutic intervention strategies for neurological disorders, and the identification of distinct phases of neuronal activity for advancing cortical-based computing devices.

Title: Ultrafast Heterogeneous Melting of Metals under Extreme Non-equilibrium States
Authors: Qiyu Zeng, Xiaoxiang Yu, Bo Chen, Shen Zhang, Kaiguo Chen, Dongdong Kang, Jiayu Dai
Abstract: The extreme electron-ion nonequilibrium states created by ultrafast laser excitation challenge conventional melting paradigms. Through neural network-enhanced multiscale simulations of tungsten and gold nanofilms, we identify electronic pressure relaxation as a critical driver of heterogeneous phase transformations. Subpicosecond uniaxial expansion generates density decrease that enable surface-initiated melting far below equilibrium melting temperatures. This ultrafast heterogeneous melting propagates at 2500 m/s-tenfold faster than thermal mechanisms-with characteristic stationary diffraction peak splitting distinguishing it from thermal expansion dynamics. While tungsten shows pressure-driven solid-solid transitions, gold exhibits complete room-temperature amorphization under electronic stress. These results establish hot-electron-mediated lattice destabilization as a universal pathway for laser-induced structural transformations, providing new insights for interpreting time-resolved experiments and controlling laser-matter interactions.

Title: GHz helical acoustic drum modes on a chip
Authors: N. Ashurbekov, I. dePedro-Embid, A. Pitanti, M. Msall, P. V. Santos
Abstract: On-chip laterally confined GHz acoustic modes with tunable helicity open the way for advanced optomechanical functionalities. Here, we demonstrate a novel concept for the implementation of these functionalites through the electrical excitation of GHz membrane-like drum modes. Our concept relies on the strong dependence of the frequency spectrum of Lamb acoustic modes on the thickness of the propagating medium. Lamb modes generated by a piezoelectric resonator in a thicker (or thinner) substrate region remain confined in this region via reflections at the lateral boundaries with thinner (thicker) substrate regions. If the generation region is disk-shaped, the lateral reflections form drum-like modes, which we experimentally confirm by radio-frequency spectroscopy as well as by maps of the surface displacements. Furthermore, we show that an array of sector shaped piezoelectric transducers powered with appropriate radio-frequency phases creates helical modes with tunable helicity, which can then be transferred to an optical beam. Our analytical and finite-element models yield useful insights into the acoustic coupling of bulk and surface modes that can guide adaptation to other material systems. The acoustic drum modes thus provide a flexible platform for acousto-optical chiral functionalities in the GHz frequency range.

Title: Dynamics of DNA-Templated Ultrafine Silver Nanowires Formation
Authors: Qifei Ma, Mauro Chinappi, Ali Douaki, Yanqiu Zou, Huaizhou Jin, Emiliano Descrovi, Roman Krahne, Remo Proietti Zaccaria, Dan Cojoc, Karol Kolataj, Guillermo Acuna, Shangzhong Jin, Denis Garoli
Abstract: Recent research on silver nanowires prepared on DNA templates has focused on two fundamental applications: nano-scale circuits and sensors. Despite its broad potential, the formation kinetics of DNA-templated silver nanowires remains unclear. Here, we present an experimental demonstration of the formation of silver nanowires with a diameter of 2.2+0.4 nm at the single-molecule level through chemical reduction. We conducted equilibrium and perturbation kinetic experiments to measure force spectroscopy during the formation of Ag+ -DNA complexes and Ag-DNA complexes, using optical tweezers combined with microfluidics. The addition of AgNO3 resulted in an increase in force of 5.5-7.5 pN within 2 minutes, indicating that Ag+ compacts the DNA structure. In contrast, the addition of hydroquinone caused the force to decrease by 4-5 pN. Morphological characterization confirmed the presence of a dense structure formed by silver atoms bridging the DNA strands, and revealed conformational differences before and after metallization. We compare our experimental data with Brownian dynamics simulations using a coarse-grained double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) model that provides insights on the dependency of the force on the persistence length.

Title: Mean Field Approaches to Lattice Gauge Theories: A Review
Authors: Pierpaolo Fontana, Andrea Trombettoni
Abstract: Due to their broad applicability, gauge theories (GTs) play a crucial role in various areas of physics, from high-energy physics to condensed matter. Their formulations on lattices, lattice gauge theories (LGTs), can be studied, among many other methods, with tools coming from statistical mechanics lattice models, such as mean field methods, which are often used to provide approximate results. Applying these methods to LGTs requires particular attention due to the intrinsic local nature of gauge symmetry, how it is reflected in the variables used to formulate the theory, and the breaking of gauge invariance when approximations are introduced. This issue has been addressed over the decades in the literature, yielding different conclusions depending on the formulation of the theory under consideration. In this article, we focus on the mean field theoretical approach to the analysis of GTs and LGTs, connecting both older and more recent results that, to the best of our knowledge, have not been compared in a pedagogical manner. After a brief overview of mean field theory in statistical mechanics and many-body systems, we examine its application to pure LGTs with a generic compact gauge group. Finally, we review the existing literature on the subject, discussing the results obtained so far and their dependence on the formulation of the theory.

Title: Digital-Controlled Method of Conveyor-Belt Spin Shuttling in Silicon for Large-Scale Quantum Computation
Authors: Ryo Nagai, Takashi Takemoto, Yusuke Wachi, Hiroyuki Mizuno
Abstract: We propose a digital-controlled conveyor-belt shuttling method for silicon-based quantum processors, addressing the scalability challenges of conventional analog sinusoidal implementations. By placing a switch matrix and low-pass filters in a cryogenic environment, our approach synthesizes near-sinusoidal waveforms from a limited number of DC voltage levels. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves fidelity comparable to analog methods while significantly reducing wiring overhead and power dissipation. Moreover, the design offers robustness against device-level variations, enabling large-scale integration of high-fidelity spin shuttling for quantum error correction.

Title: Dynamical Decoupling of Generalization and Overfitting in Large Two-Layer Networks
Authors: Andrea Montanari, Pierfrancesco Urbani
Abstract: The inductive bias and generalization properties of large machine learning models are -- to a substantial extent -- a byproduct of the optimization algorithm used for training. Among others, the scale of the random initialization, the learning rate, and early stopping all have crucial impact on the quality of the model learnt by stochastic gradient descent or related algorithms. In order to understand these phenomena, we study the training dynamics of large two-layer neural networks. We use a well-established technique from non-equilibrium statistical physics (dynamical mean field theory) to obtain an asymptotic high-dimensional characterization of this dynamics. This characterization applies to a Gaussian approximation of the hidden neurons non-linearity, and empirically captures well the behavior of actual neural network models. Our analysis uncovers several interesting new phenomena in the training dynamics: $(i)$ The emergence of a slow time scale associated with the growth in Gaussian/Rademacher complexity; $(ii)$ As a consequence, algorithmic inductive bias towards small complexity, but only if the initialization has small enough complexity; $(iii)$ A separation of time scales between feature learning and overfitting; $(iv)$ A non-monotone behavior of the test error and, correspondingly, a `feature unlearning' phase at large times.

Title: Assessing zero-shot generalisation behaviour in graph-neural-network interatomic potentials
Authors: Chiheb Ben Mahmoud, Zakariya El-Machachi, Krystian A. Gierczak, John L. A. Gardner, Volker L. Deringer
Abstract: With the rapidly growing availability of machine-learned interatomic potential (MLIP) models for chemistry, much current research focuses on the development of generally applicable and ``foundational'' MLIPs. An important question in this context is whether, and how well, such models can transfer from one application domain to another. Here, we assess this transferability for an MLIP model at the interface of materials and molecular chemistry. Specifically, we study GO-MACE-23, a model designed for the extended covalent network of graphene oxide, and quantify its zero-shot performance for small, isolated molecules and chemical reactions outside its direct scope--in direct comparison with a state-of-the-art model which has been trained in-domain. Our work provides quantitative insight into the transfer and generalisation ability of graph-neural-network potentials and, more generally, makes a step towards the more widespread applicability of MLIPs in chemistry.

Title: Single-particle spectra and magnetic susceptibility in the Emery model: a dynamical mean-field perspective
Authors: Yi-Ting Tseng, Mário O. Malcolms, Henri Menke, Marcel Klett, Thomas Schäfer, Philipp Hansmann
Abstract: We investigate dynamical mean-field calculations of the three-band Emery model at the one- and two-particle level for material-realistic parameters of high-$T_c$ superconductors. Our study shows that even within dynamical mean-field theory, which accounts solely for temporal fluctuations, the intrinsic multi-orbital nature of the Emery model introduces effective non-local correlations. These correlations lead to a non-Curie-like temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility, consistent with nuclear magnetic resonance experiments in the pseudogap regime. By analyzing the temperature dependence of the uniform static spin susceptibility obtained by single-site and cluster dynamical mean-field theory, we find indications of emerging oxygen-copper singlet fluctuations, explicitly captured by the model. Despite correctly describing the hallmark of the pseudogap at the two-particle level, such as the drop in the Knight shift of nuclear magnetic resonance, dynamical mean-field theory fails to capture the spectral properties of the pseudogap.

Title: Global Phase Diagram of D-wave Superconductivity in the Square-Lattice $t\text{-}J$ Model
Authors: Feng Chen, F. D. M. Haldane, D. N. Sheng
Abstract: The Hubbard and closely related $t\text-J$ models are exciting platforms for unconventional superconductivity (SC). Through state-of-the-art density matrix renormalization group calculations using the grand canonical ensemble, we address open issues regarding the ground-state phase diagram of the extended $t\text{-}J$ model on a square lattice in the parameter regime relevant to cuprate superconductors. On large 8-leg cylinders, we demonstrate that the pure $t\text{-}J$ model with only nearest-neighbor hoppings and superexchange interactions, for a wide range of doping ($\delta=0.1-0.2$), hosts robust d-wave superconductivity possibly coexisting with weak unidirectional pair density wave. Furthermore, a small next nearest neighbor hopping $t_2$ suppresses pair and charge density waves, resulting in a uniform d-wave SC phase in both electron- and hole-doped cuprate model systems. Our work validates the $t\text-J$ model as a proper minimum model for the emergence of superconductivity in cuprate superconductors.

Title: Multi-objective optimization for targeted self-assembly among competing polymorphs
Authors: Sambarta Chatterjee, William M. Jacobs
Abstract: Most approaches for designing self-assembled materials focus on the thermodynamic stability of a target structure or crystal polymorph. Yet in practice, the outcome of a self-assembly process is often controlled by kinetic pathways. Here we present an efficient machine learning-guided design algorithm to identify globally optimal interaction potentials that maximize both the thermodynamic yield and kinetic accessibility of a target polymorph. We show that optimal potentials exist along a Pareto front, indicating the possibility of a trade-off between the thermodynamic and kinetic objectives. Although the extent of this trade-off depends on the target polymorph and the assembly conditions, we generically find that the trade-off arises from a competition among alternative polymorphs: The most kinetically optimal potentials, which favor the target polymorph on short timescales, tend to stabilize a competing polymorph at longer times. Our work establishes a general-purpose approach for multi-objective self-assembly optimization, reveals fundamental trade-offs between crystallization speed and defect formation in the presence of competing polymorphs, and suggests guiding principles for materials design algorithms that optimize for kinetic accessibility.

Title: Charge Dynamics of an Unconventional Three-Dimensional Charge Density Wave in Kagome FeGe
Authors: Shaohui Yi, Zhiyu Liao, Qi Wang, Haiyang Ma, Jianpeng Liu, Xiaokun Teng, Bin Gao, Pengcheng Dai, Yaomin Dai, Jianzhou Zhao, Yanpeng Qi, Bing Xu, Xianggang Qiu
Abstract: We report on the charge dynamics of kagome FeGe, an antiferromagnet with a charge density wave (CDW) transition at $T_{\mathrm{CDW}} \simeq 105$ K, using polarized infrared spectroscopy and band structure calculations. We reveal pronounced optical anisotropy along the $a$- and $c$-axis, as well as an unusual response associated with three-dimensional CDW order. Above $T_{\mathrm{CDW}}$, there is a notable transfer of spectral weight (SW) from high to low energies, promoted by the magnetic splitting-induced shift in bands. Across the CDW transition, we observe a sudden SW transfer from low to high energies over a broad range, along with the emergence of new excitations around 1200 cm$^{-1}$. These results contrast with observations from other kagome metals like CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, where the nesting of VHSs leads to a clear CDW gap feature. Instead, our findings can be accounted for by a $2\times2\times2$ CDW ground state driven by a first-order structural transition involving large partial Ge1-dimerization. Our study thus unveils a complex interplay among structure, magnetism, and charge order, offering valuable insights for a comprehensive understanding of CDW order in FeGe.

Title: Critical Fluctuations at Finite-Time Dynamical Phase Transition
Authors: Nalina Vadakkayil, Massimiliano Esposito, Jan Meibohm
Abstract: We explore the critical properties of the recently discovered finite-time dynamical phase transition in the non-equilibrium relaxation of Ising magnets after a temperature quench. The transition is characterized by a sudden switch in the relaxation dynamics and it occurs at a sharp critical time. While previous works have focused either on mean-field interactions or on investigating the critical time, we analyze the critical fluctuations at the phase transition in the nearest-neighbor Ising model on a square lattice using Monte Carlo simulations. By means of a finite-size scaling analysis, we extract the critical exponents for the transition. In two spatial dimensions, we find that the exponents are consistent with those of the two-dimensional Ising universality class when the system is initially in the vicinity of the critical point. For initial temperatures below the critical one, however, the critical exponents differ from the Ising-exponents, indicating a distinct dynamical critical phenomenon.

Title: Combining intrinsic and sliding-induced polarizations for multistates in two dimensional ferroelectrics
Authors: Chuhan Tang, Zhiqiang Tian, Tao Ouyang, Anlian Pan, Mingxing Chen
Abstract: Going beyond the bistability paradigm of the charge polarizations in ferroelectrics is highly desired for ferroelectric (FE) memory devices toward ultra-high-density information storage. Here, we propose to build multistates by combining the intrinsic and sliding-induced polarizations. The physics is that there is at least one order of magnitude difference in the energy barriers between these two types of polarization, which leads to a significant difference in the electric fields for reversing the polarization. This difference, along with the symmetry breaking, allows for a unique flipping mechanism involving layer-by-layer sliding followed by layer-by-layer flipping during the transformation of the multistates. As a result, six and ten switchable states can be achieved for the 1T" bilayers and trilayers, respectively. We further illustrate the concept in H-stacking bilayers and trilayers of 1T" transition-metal dichalcogenides by first-principles calculations. Our study provides a new route to design novel polarization states for developing next-generation memory devices.

Title: 2-Morita Equivalent Condensable Algebras and Domain Walls in 2+1D Topological Orders
Authors: Rongge Xu, Holiverse Yang
Abstract: We classify $E_2$ condensable algebras in a modular tensor category $\mathcal{C}$ up to 2-Morita equivalence. From a physical perspective, this is equivalent to providing a criterion for when different $E_2$ condensable algebras result in the same condensed topological phase in a 2d anyon condensation process. By considering the left and right centers of $E_1$ condensable algebras in $\mathcal{C}$, we exhaust all 2-Morita equivalent $E_2$ condensable algebras in $\mathcal{C}$ and provide a method to recover $E_1$ condensable algebras from 2-Morita equivalent $E_2$ condensable algebras. We also prove that intersecting Lagrangian algebras in $\mathcal{C} \boxtimes \overline{\mathcal{C}}$ with its left and right components generates all 2-Morita equivalent $E_2$ condensable algebras in $\mathcal{C}$. This paper establishes a complete interplay between $E_1$ condensable algebras in $\mathcal{C}$, 2-Morita equivalent $E_2$ condensable algebras in $\mathcal{C}$, and Lagrangian algebras in $\mathcal{C} \boxtimes \overline{\mathcal{C}}$. The relations between different condensable algebras can be translated into their module categories, which correspond to domain walls in topological orders. We introduce a two-step condensation process and study the fusion of domain walls. We also show that an automorphism of an $E_2$ condensable algebra may lead to a nontrivial braided autoequivalence in the condensed phase. As concrete examples, we interpret the categories of quantum doubles of finite groups. We also discuss examples beyond group symmetries. Moreover, our results can be generalized to Witt-equivalent modular tensor categories.

Title: Engineering flux-controlled flat bands and topological states in a Stagome lattice
Authors: Biplab Pal, Georges Bouzerar
Abstract: We present the Stagome lattice, a variant of the Kagome lattice, where one can make any of the bands completely flat by tuning an externally controllable magnetic flux. This systematically allows the energy of the flat band to coincide with the Fermi level. We have analytically calculated the compact localized states associated to each of these flat bands appearing at different values of the magnetic flux. We also show that, this model features nontrivial topological properties with distinct integer values of the Chern numbers as a function of the magnetic flux. We argue that this mechanism for making any of the bands exactly flat could be of interest to address the flat-band superconductivity in such a system. Additionally, we show that our results are robust even in the presence of a small amount of disorder. Furthermore, we believe that the phenomenon of photonic flat band localization could be studied in the Stagome lattice structure, designed for instance using femtosecond laser induced single-mode waveguide arrays.

Title: Spectroscopy and complex-time correlations using minimally entangled typical thermal states
Authors: Zhenjiu Wang, Paul McClarty, Dobromila Dankova, Andreas Honecker, Alexander Wietek
Abstract: Tensor network states have enjoyed great success at capturing aspects of strong correlation physics. However, obtaining dynamical correlators at non-zero temperatures is generically hard even using these methods. Here, we introduce a practical approach to computing such correlators using minimally entangled typical thermal states (METTS). While our primary method directly computes dynamical correlators of physical operators in real time, we propose extensions where correlations are evaluated in the complex-time plane. The imaginary time component bounds the rate of entanglement growth and strongly alleviates the computational difficulty allowing the study of larger system sizes. To extract the physical correlator one must take the limit of purely real-time evolution. We present two routes to obtaining this information (i) via an analytic correlation function in complex time combined with a stochastic analytic continuation method to obtain the real-time limit and (ii) a hermitian correlation function that asymptotically captures the desired correlation function quantitatively without requiring effort of numerical analytic continuation. We show that these numerical techniques capture the finite-temperature dynamics of the Shastry-Sutherland model - a model of interacting spin one-half in two dimensions.

Title: Vortex lattices and critical fields in anisotropic superconductors
Authors: Martin Speight, Thomas Winyard
Abstract: A method is developed to compute minimal energy vortex lattices in a general Ginzburg-Landau model of a superconductor subjected to an applied magnetic field. The model may have any number of components and may be spatially anisotropic. The novelty of this method is that it makes no assumptions about the orientation of the vortex lines or the period vectors of the lattice's unit cell: these are all determined dynamically. Methods to compute the first and second critical magnetic fields, $H_{c_1}$ and $H_{c_2}$, in this class of models are also developed. These methods are applied to a simple anisotropic single-component model, and to an anisotropic two-component model of strong current theoretical interest (a so-called $s+id$ model). It is found, in both cases, that at low applied field the vortex lines can tilt very significantly away from the direction of the applied field (by as much as $40^\circ$ for the single-component and $30^\circ$ for the $s+id$ model). The optimal lattice in the $s+id$ model is qualitatively very different from the conventional triangular Abrikosov lattice, exhibiting a phase transition from a system of Skyrmion chains when the external field is orthogonal to the basal plane to a deformed Abrikosov lattice when applied in the basal plane.

Title: Polarons in supersolids: path-integral treatment of an impurity in a one-dimensional dipolar supersolid
Authors: Laurent H. A. Simons, Michiel Wouters, Jacques Tempere
Abstract: The supersolid phase of a dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate has an intriguing excitation spectrum displaying a band structure. Here, the dressing of an impurity in a one-dimensional dipolar supersolid with the excitations of the supersolid is studied. The ground-state energy of the supersolid polaron is calculated using a variational path integral approach, which obtained accurate results for other polaron systems within the Bogoliubov and Fröhlich approximations. A divergence is observed at the superfluid-supersolid phase transition. The polaron radius is also computed, showing that as a function of impurity-atom interactions, the polaron can become localized to a single droplet, behaving like a small solid-state polaron.

Title: Yukawa-Lorentz symmetry of interacting non-Hermitian birefringent Dirac fermions
Authors: Sk Asrap Murshed, Bitan Roy
Abstract: The energy spectra of linearly dispersing gapless spin-3/2 Dirac fermions display birefringence, featuring two effective Fermi velocities, thus breaking the space-time Lorentz symmetry. Here, we consider a non-Hermitian (NH) generalization of this scenario by introducing a masslike anti-Hermitian birefringent Dirac operator to its Hermitian counterpart. At the microscopic level, a generalized $\pi$-flux square lattice model with imbalance in the hopping amplitudes in the opposite directions among spinless fermions between the nearest-neighbor sites gives rise to pseudospin-3/2 NH Dirac fermions in terms of internal, namely sublattice, degrees of freedom. The resulting NH operator shows real eigenvalue spectra over an extended NH parameter regime, and a combination of non-spatial and discrete rotational symmetries protects the gapless nature of such quasiparticles. However, at the brink of dynamic mass generation, triggered by Hubbardlike local interactions, the birefringent parameter always vanishes under coarse grain due to the Yukawa-type interactions with scalar bosonic order-parameter fluctuations. The resulting quantum critical state is, therefore, described by two decoupled copies of spin-1/2 Dirac fermions with a unique terminal Fermi velocity, which is equal to the bosonic order-parameter velocity, thereby fostering an emergent space-time Lorentz symmetry. Furthermore, depending on the internal algebra between the anti-Hermitian birefringent Dirac operator and the candidate mass order, the system achieves the emergent Yukawa-Lorentz symmetry either by maintaining its non-Hermiticity or by recovering a full Hermiticity. We discuss the resulting quantum critical phenomena and possible microscopic realizations of the proposed scenarios.

Title: Spin self-organization in an optical cavity facilitated by inhomogeneous broadening
Authors: Marc Nairn, Luigi Giannelli, Giovanna Morigi, Sebastian Slama, Beatriz Olmos, Simon B. Jäger
Abstract: We study the onset of collective spin-self-organization in a thermal ensemble of driven two-level atoms confined in an optical cavity. The atoms spontaneously form a spin-pattern above a critical driving strength that sets a threshold and is determined by the cavity parameters, the initial temperature, and the transition frequency of the atomic spin. Remarkably, we find that inhomogeneous Doppler broadening facilitates the onset of spin-self-organization. In particular, the threshold is non-monotonic when increasing the spin transition frequency and reaches a minimum when the Doppler broadening is of similar magnitude. This feature emerges due to Doppler-induced resonances. Above the threshold, we find cooperative dynamics of spin, spatial, and momentum degrees of freedom leading to density modulations, fast reduction of kinetic energy, and the emergence of non-thermal states. More broadly, our work demonstrates how broadening can facilitate strong light-matter interactions in many-body systems.

Title: Relativistic Floquet States Near the Shockwave Limit
Authors: Takashi Oka
Abstract: We investigate the impact of propagating waves $V(Qx - \omega t)$ on the electronic states of quantum materials, focusing on Floquet-Bloch states of relativistic fermions. These waves include laser light, polaritons, acoustic waves, and sliding density waves, each propagating at different speeds. Generically, we categorize the fields based on their speed relative to the Fermi velocity into time-like, light-like, and space-like waves, finding that the resulting electronic states exhibit distinct characteristics in each cases. For 3D Dirac electrons in circularly polarized waves, we identify emergent Floquet Weyl bands, which can transition into Type-II Weyl states near a critical point. The effects of Floquet band engineering are significantly enhanced by Lorentz contraction, which reaches its maximum when the wave speed approaches but slightly exceeds the Fermi velocity, leading to the realization of a shockwave-like state. The shockwave-like states are related to the near adiabatic dynamics via Lorentz transformation.

Title: Enantiomer-Selective Magnetoresistance in Chiral Gold Nanocrystals by Magnetic Control of Surface Potentials
Authors: Fengxia Wu, Ying Wang, Yufei Zhao, Zhenyu Yang, Yu Tian, Zuoti Xie, Wenxin Niu, Binghai Yan, Cunlan Guo
Abstract: Chiral nanomaterials offer intriguing possibilities for novel electronic and chemical applications. Here, we report the discovery of an enantiomer-selective magnetoresistance effect in chiral gold nanocrystals. Based on precise control of nanocrystal chiral morphology using amino acid-directed synthesis, we demonstrate that an external magnetic field can dramatically modulate resistance in an enantiomer-specific manner. For a given enantiomer, a magnetic field in one direction alters the resistance by dozens of times, while the opposite field direction leaves it unchanged. This asymmetric response reverses for the opposite enantiomer and are reproduced in both single nanocrystals by conduction atomic force microscopy and nanocrystal thin films in solid state devices. We attribute this phenomenon to a chirality-driven charge pumping effect, where the interplay between the chiral morphology and the magnetic field selectively modifies the surface potential. The magnitude and sign of the magnetoresistance can be further tuned by the surface chemistry of the nanocrystal, as demonstrated through sulfide treatment. Our findings reveal a new form of chirality-dependent magnetoresistance, distinct from previously known effects such as chirality-induced spin selectivity and electric magnetochiral anisotropy. The ability to remotely control surface potentials of chiral nanostructures using magnetic fields could enable novel approaches in catalysis, drug delivery, and nanoelectronics.

Title: Multiferroic Metallic Monolayer Cu(CrSe2)2
Authors: Ke Yang, Yuxuan Zhou, Yaozhenghang Ma, Hua Wu
Abstract: The two-dimensional (2D) Cu(CrSe$_2$)$_2$ monolayer stands out for its combined ferromagnetic (FM), ferroelectric (FE), and metallic properties, marking itself as a prominent 2D multiferroic metal. This work studies those properties and the relevant physics, using density functional calculations, Monte Carlo simulations, and $ab$ $initio$ molecular dynamics. Our results show that Cu(CrSe$_2$)$_2$ monolayer is in the Cr$^{3+}$ $t_{2g}^3$ state with $S$ = 3/2 and Cu$^{1+}$ $3d^{10}$ with $S$ = 0. The observed in-plane magnetic anisotropy primarily arises from exchange anisotropy, which is associated with the Cr-Se-Cr itinerant ferromagnetism. In contrast, both single-ion anisotropy and shape magnetic anisotropy contribute negligibly. The Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is also quite weak, only about 3\% of the intralayer exchange parameters. Our Monte Carlo simulations show a FM Curie temperature ($T_{\rm C}$) of 190 K. Moreover, the monolayer exhibits a vertical FE polarization of 1.79 pC/m and a FE polarization switching barrier of 182 meV/f.u., and the FE state remains stable above room temperature as shown by $ab$ $initio$ molecular dynamics simulations. Furthermore, a magnetoelectric coupling is partially manifested by a magnetization rotation from in-plane to out-of-plane associated with a FE-to-paraelectric transition. The magnetization rotation can also be induced by either hole or electron doping, and the hole doping increases the $T_{\rm C}$ up to 238 K. In addition, tensile strain reduces the FE polarization but enhances $T_{\rm C}$ to 290 K, while a compressive strain gives an opposite effect. Therefore, the multiferroic metallic Cu(CrSe$_2$)$_2$ monolayer may be explored for advanced multifunctional electronic devices.

Title: Exceptional Points, Bulk-Boundary Correspondence, and Entanglement Properties for a Dimerized Hatano-Nelson Model with Staggered Potentials
Authors: Yasamin Mardani, Rodrigo A. Pimenta, Jesko Sirker
Abstract: It is well-known that the standard bulk-boundary correspondence does not hold for non-Hermitian systems in which also new phenomena such as exceptional points do occur. Here we study by analytical and numerical means a paradigmatic one-dimensional non-Hermitian model with dimerization, asymmetric hopping, and imaginary staggered potentials. We present analytical solutions for the singular-value and the eigenspectrum of this model with both open and closed boundary conditions. We explicitly demonstrate that the proper bulk-boundary correspondence is between topological winding numbers in the periodic case and singular values, {\it not eigenvalues}, in the open case. These protected singular values are connected to hidden edge modes which only become exact zero-energy eigenmodes in the semi-infinite chain limit. We also show that a non-trivial topology leads to protected eigenvalues in the entanglement spectrum. In the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric case, we find that the model has a so far overlooked phase where exceptional points become dense in the thermodynamic limit.

Title: Long-range correlations with finite-size effects from a superposition of uncorrelated pulses with power-law distributed durations
Authors: M. A. Korzeniowska, O. E. Garcia
Abstract: Long-range correlations manifested as power spectral density scaling $1/f^\beta$ for frequency $f$ and a range of exponents $\beta$ are investigated for a superposition of uncorrelated pulses with distributed durations $\tau$. Closed-form expressions for the frequency power spectral density are derived for a one-sided exponential pulse function and several variants of bounded and unbounded power-law distributions of pulse durations ${P_\tau(\tau)\sim1/\tau^\alpha}$ with abrupt and smooth cutoffs. The asymptotic scaling relation $\beta=3-\alpha$ is demonstrated for $1<\alpha<3$ in the limit of an infinitely broad distribution $P_\tau(\tau)$. Logarithmic corrections to the frequency scaling are exposed at the boundaries of the long-range dependence regime, $\beta=0$ and $\beta=2$. Analytically demonstrated finite-size effects associated with distribution truncations are shown to reduce the frequency ranges of scale invariance by several decades. The regimes of validity of the $\beta=3-\alpha$ relation are clarified.

Title: Deciphering the origin of spin current in spintronic terahertz emitters and its imprint on their electromagnetic radiation via time-dependent density functional theory
Authors: Ali Kefayati, Yafei Ren, M. Benjamin Jungfleisch, Lars Gundlach, John Q. Xiao, Branislav K. Nikolic
Abstract: Spin current flowing between femtosecond laser pulse (fsLP)-driven ferromagnetic metal and adjacent normal metal (NM) hosting strong spin-orbit coupling is invariably invoked to explain terahertz (THz) radiation believed to be emitted solely by NM layer. Despite being such a central concept, the microscopic origin of interlayer spin current remains vague. Here, we employ recently developed [A. Kefayati {\em et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 133}, 136704 (2024)] time-dependent density functional theory plus Jefimenko equations approach to extract spin current between Co and NM=Pt or NM=W layer where Co is driven by fsLP responsible for its demagnetization, i.e., shrinking of its magnetization vector, $M^y(t)/M^y(t=0)<1$. By comparing time dependence of spin current with those of other relevant quantities, we find that: ({\em i}) spin current is generated by demagnetization dynamics because it {\em follows} closely $dM^y/dt$, thus it is an example of quantum pumping phenomenon that cannot be captured by phenomenological notions (such as ``spin voltage'') and related semiclassical transport theories; ({\em ii}) time dependence of pumped spin current {\em does not follow} closely that of charge current emerging within NM layer via spin-to-charge conversion mechanisms; ({\em iii}) THz emission can be governed by {\em both} charge current (i.e., its time derivative entering the Jefimenko equations) within Co layer or NM layer, but in different times frames. We also unravel a special case of NM=W where spin-to-charge conversion by the inverse spin Hall effect and its contribution to THz emission is suppressed, despite large spin Hall angle of W, because of localization of excited electrons onto the outer unfilled $d$-orbitals of W.

Title: Model-Based Iterative Reconstruction of Three-Dimensional Magnetisation in a Nanowire Structure Using Electron Holographic Vector Field Tomography
Authors: Aurys Silinga, András Kovács, Stephen McVitie, Rafal E. Dunin-Borkowski, Kayla Fallon, Trevor P. Almeida
Abstract: Methods for characterisation of 3D magnetic spin structures are necessary to advance the performance of 3D magnetic nanoscale technologies. However, as the component dimensions approach the nanometre range, it becomes more challenging to analyse 3D magnetic configurations with the appropriate spatial resolution. In this paper, we present a method based on Lorentz transmission electron microscopy in which model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) is used to reconstruct the most probable magnetisation in an exemplar nanostructure. This method is based on relating electron phase measurements to the magnetic configuration of the nanostructure, and therefore, the method is subject to certain limitations. In this proof-of-concept experiment, MBIR was tested on an L-shaped ferromagnetic cobalt nanowire, fabricated using focused electron beam induced deposition. Off-axis electron holography was used to acquire a tomographic tilt series of electron holograms, which were analysed to measure magnetic electron phase shift over two tilt arcs with up to $ \pm 60$ degree tilt range. Then, a 3D magnetisation vector field consistent with the tomographic phase measurements was reconstructed, revealing multiple magnetic domains within the nanowire. The reconstructed magnetisation is accurate for magnetic domains larger than 50 nm, and higher resolution can be achieved by the continued development of tomographic reconstruction algorithms.

Title: Large Twist Angle Dependent Ultrafast Transient Dynamics of MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ van der Waals Heterostructures beyond the Mott Transition
Authors: Vikas Arora, Pramoda K Nayak, Victor S Muthu, A K Sood
Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals heterostructures (HS) exhibit twist-angle ($\theta$) dependent interlayer charge transfer, driven by moiré potential that tunes the electronic band structure with varying $\theta$. Apart from the magic angles of $\sim$3$^\circ$ and $\sim$57.5$^\circ$ that show flat valence bands (twisted WSe$_2$ bilayer), the commensurate angles of 21.8$^\circ$ and 38.2$^\circ$ reveal the Umklapp light coupling of interlayer excitons. We report our results on non-degenerate optical pump-optical probe spectroscopy of MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ HS at large twist angles under high photoexcitation densities above the Mott transition threshold, generating interlayer localized charge carriers. We show that the recombination time of electrons and holes is minimum at the commensurate angles. The strength of non-radiative interlayer Auger recombination also shows a minimum at the commensurate angles. The fluence dependence of interlayer carrier recombination time suggests additional relaxation channels near the commensurate angles. This study emphasizes the significance of the large twist angle of HS in developing transition metal dichalcogenides-based optoelectronic devices.

Title: Spin Chern number in altermagnets
Authors: Rafael Gonzalez-Hernandez, Higinio Serrano, Bernardo Uribe
Abstract: This work explores the topological properties of altermagnets, a novel class of collinear magnetic materials. We employ equivariant K-theory of magnetic groups and Hamiltonian models to formulate a robust $C^z_4 \mathbb{T}$ topological invariant to classify 2D and 3D altermagnetic systems. Our findings demonstrate that the spin Chern number serves as a robust topological index, corresponding to the half-quantized Chern number of the divided Brillouin zone. This indicator enables the prediction of a topologically protected 2D altermagnetic insulators and 3D Weyl altermagnetic semimetals, highlighting the relationship between altermagnetism and topological phases. Furthermore, our results provide a pathway to the exploration of topological applications in $d$-wave altermagnetic materials.

Title: On the relation between fractional charge and statistics
Authors: T. H. Hansson, Rodrigo Arouca, Thomas Klein Kvorning
Abstract: We revisit an argument, originally given by Kivelson and Roček, for why the existence of fractional charge necessarily implies fractional statistics. In doing so, we resolve a contradiction in the original argument, and in the case of a $\nu = 1/m$ Laughlin holes, we also show that the standard relation between fractional charge and statistics is necessary by an argument based on a t'Hooft anomaly in a one-form global ${\mathcal Z}_m$ symmetry.

Title: A Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield bound with a first-order system in the 2D Gross-Pitaevskii equation
Authors: Fabrizio Canfora, Pablo Pais
Abstract: A novel Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) bound for the Gross-Pitaevskii equations in two spatial dimensions is presented. The energy can be bound from below in terms of the combination of two boundary terms, one related to the vorticity (but "dressed" by the condensate profile) and the second to the "skewness" of the configurations. The bound is saturated by configurations that satisfy a system of two first-order partial differential equations when such a BPS system is satisfied, the Gross-Pitaevskii equations are also satisfied. The analytic solutions of this BPS system in the present manuscript represent configurations with fractional vorticity living in an annulus. Using these techniques, we present the first analytic examples of this kind. The hydrodynamical interpretation of the BPS system is discussed. The implications of these results are outlined.

Title: Diabatic error and propagation of Majorana zero modes in interacting quantum dots systems
Authors: Bradraj Pandey, Gaurav Kumar Gupta, Gonzalo Alvarez, Satoshi Okamoto, Elbio Dagotto
Abstract: Motivated by recent experimental progress in realizing Majorana zero modes (MZMs) using quantum dot systems, we investigate the diabatic errors associated with the movement of those MZMs. The movement is achieved by tuning time-dependent gate potentials applied to individual quantum dots, effectively creating a moving potential wall. To probe the optimized movement of MZMs, we calculate the experimentally accessible local density-of-states and time-dependent fidelity using many-body time-dependent numerical methods. Our analysis reveals that an optimal potential wall height is crucial to preserve the well-localized nature of the MZM during its movement. Moreover, for the first time, we analyze diabatic errors in realistic quantum-dot systems, incorporating the effects of repulsive Coulomb interactions and disorder in both hopping and pairing terms. Additionally, we provide a comparative study of diabatic errors arising from the simultaneous versus sequential tuning of multiple gates during the MZMs movement. Finally, we estimate the time scale required for MZM transfer in a six-quantum-dot system, demonstrating that MZM movement is feasible and can be completed well within the qubit's operational lifetime in practical quantum-dot setups.

Title: Rigorous bound on hydrodynamic diffusion for chaotic open spin chains
Authors: Dimitrios Ampelogiannis, Benjamin Doyon
Abstract: The emergence of diffusion is one of the deepest physical phenomena observed in many-body interacting, chaotic systems. But establishing rigorously that correlation functions, say of the spin, expand diffusively, remains one of the most important problems of mathematical physics. We establish for the first time, with Lindbladian evolution, a lower bound on spin diffusion in chaotic, translation-invariant, nearest-neighbor open quantum spin-1/2 chain satisfying a local detailed-balance condition and strong conservation of magnetisation. The bound is strictly positive if and only if the local quantum jumps transport spin. Physically, the bound comes from the spreading effects of initial-state macroscopic fluctuations, a mechanism which occurs whenever spin is an interacting ballistic mode. Chaoticity means that the Hilbert space of extensive charges is spanned by magnetisation; we expect this to be generic. Our main tool is the Green-Kubo formula, the mathematical technique of projection over quadratically extensive charges, and appropriate correlation decay bounds recently established. Because Lindbladian dynamics is not reversible, the Green-Kubo spin diffusion strength includes a contribution due to irreversibility, which we interpret as encoding the hydrodynamic entropy production that may occur in the forgotten environment. This, we show, vanishes for certain choices of interaction parameters, for which the Lindbladian dynamics becomes reversible. Our methods can be extended to finite or short ranges, higher spins, and other non-Hamiltonian systems such as quantum circuits. As we argue, according to the theory of nonlinear fluctuating hydrodynamics, we further expect these systems to display superdiffusion, and thus have infinite diffusivity; however this is still beyond the reach of mathematical rigour.

Title: Quantum noise spectroscopy of superconducting dynamics in thin film Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+δ}$
Authors: Zhongyuan Liu, Ruotian Gong, Jaewon Kim, Oriana K. Diessel, Qiaozhi Xu, Zackary Rehfuss, Xinyi Du, Guanghui He, Abhishek Singh, Yun Suk Eo, Erik A. Henriksen, G. D. Gu, Norman Y. Yao, Francisco Machado, Sheng Ran, Shubhayu Chatterjee, Chong Zu
Abstract: Characterizing the low-energy dynamics of quantum materials is crucial to our understanding of strongly correlated electronic states. Yet, it remains experimentally challenging to investigate such dynamics with high spectroscopic resolution in both frequency and momentum space, particularly in two-dimensional correlated systems. Here, we leverage Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) centers in diamond as a powerful and non-invasive tool to study thin-film Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ (BSCCO), revealing several distinct dynamical phenomena across the superconducting phase diagram. At zero magnetic field and low temperatures, NV depolarization ($T_1$) noise spectroscopy captures the low-frequency (GHz-scale) magnetic noise generated by nodal superconducting quasiparticle excitations, in agreement with Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) mean-field theory. Near the critical temperature $T_c \approx 90$ K, supercurrent-fluctuation-induced noise leads to a sharp reduction of the NV $T_1$. By carefully analyzing the temperature-scaling of $T_1$, we observe clear deviations from the BCS prediction, reflecting the importance of order parameter fluctuations and enabling the determination of both static and dynamical critical exponents. When a small field is applied, we detect a broad and asymmetric reduction of NV $T_1$ near $T_c$; the field-induced smearing of the transition unveils the presence of a vortex liquid phase. Finally, NV decoherence ($T_2$) noise spectroscopy allows us to characterize magnetic noise at even lower MHz-scale frequencies and obtain evidence for complex vortex-solid fluctuations well below $T_c$. Our results establish quantum noise spectroscopy as a versatile platform for probing dynamical phenomena in superconductors, with frequency and length scales complementary to existing techniques.

Title: Laser-driven Ultrafast Dynamics of a Fractional Quantum Hall System
Authors: Ammar Kirmani, Benedikt Fauseweh, Jian-Xin Zhu
Abstract: Fractional quantum Hall (FQH) systems are strongly interacting electron systems with topological order. These systems are characterized by novel ground states, fractionally charged and neutral excitations. The neutral excitations are dominated by a low-energy collective magnetoroton mode. Here we derive and use a quasi-one-dimensional model to investigate the ultrafast nonequilibrium dynamics of a laser-driven FQH system within a two-Landau-level approximation. As opposed to the traditional and synthetic bilayers, our model accounts for interactions where electrons can scatter from one Landau-level to another. By performing exact time evolution of the system, we create an out-of-equilibrium state following the laser pulse that shows rich physics. Our calculations show the presence of non-trivial excited modes. One of these modes is electromagnetically active and represent density oscillations of \emph{magnetoplasmon} mode. Another mode is identified by evaluating the overlap of the initial state and the out-of-equilibrium state following the laser pulse with a quadrupole operator. This mode is analogous to the chiral-graviton mode for FQH systems recently measured in experiments [Nature {\bf 628}, 78 (2024)]. Our results show that a linearly-polarized pulse field can excite the graviton mode when inter-Landau level scattering occurs.

Title: Evidence of Replica Symmetry Breaking under the Nishimori conditions in epidemic inference on graphs
Authors: Alfredo Braunstein, Louise Budzynski, Matteo Mariani, Federico Ricci-Tersenghi
Abstract: In Bayesian inference, computing the posterior distribution from the data is typically a non-trivial problem, which usually requires approximations such as mean-field approaches or numerical methods, like the Monte Carlo Markov Chain. Being a high-dimensional distribution over a set of correlated variables, the posterior distribution can undergo the notorious replica symmetry breaking transition. When it happens, several mean-field methods and virtually every Monte Carlo scheme can not provide a reasonable approximation to the posterior and its marginals. Replica symmetry is believed to be guaranteed whenever the data is generated with known prior and likelihood distributions, namely under the so-called Nishimori conditions. In this paper, we break this belief, by providing a counter-example showing that, under the Nishimori conditions, replica symmetry breaking arises. Introducing a simple, geometrical model that can be thought of as a patient zero retrieval problem in a highly infectious regime of the epidemic Susceptible-Infectious model, we show that under the Nishimori conditions, there is evidence of replica symmetry breaking. We achieve this result by computing the instability of the replica symmetric cavity method toward the one step replica symmetry broken phase. The origin of this phenomenon -- replica symmetry breaking under the Nishimori conditions -- is likely due to the correlated disorder appearing in the epidemic models.

Title: Electrostatics in semiconducting devices I : The Pure Electrostatics Self Consistent Approximation
Authors: A. Lacerda-Santos, Xavier Waintal
Abstract: In quantum nanoelectronics devices, the electrostatic energy is the largest energy scale at play and, to a large extend, it determines the charge distribution inside the devices. Here, we introduce the Pure Electrostatic Self consistent Approximation (PESCA) that provides a minimum model that describes how to include a semiconductor in an electrostatic calculation to properly account for both screening and partial depletion due to e.g. field effect. We show how PESCA may be used to reconstruct the charge distribution from the measurement of pinch-off phase diagrams in the gate voltages space. PESCA can also be extended to account for magnetic field and calculate the edge reconstruction in the quantum Hall regime. The validity of PESCA is controlled by a small parameter $\kappa = C_g/C_q$, the ratio of the geometrical capacitance to the quantum capacitance, which is, in many common situations, of the order of 1%, making PESCA a quantitative technique for the calculation of the charge distribution inside devices.

Abstract: Neutron diffraction experiments of TmFeO3 single crystals were performed in the external magnetic fields. The field along c-axis increases temperature of spin-reorientation transition TSR from phase {\Gamma}4 to {\Gamma}2. Application of the field along b-axis led to the decrease of TSR and to the formation of new phases. Based on the temperature and field dependence of the Bragg reflection intensity, the configuration of magnetically induced phases was proposed. The magneto-structural effects were observed.

Title: ZrN nucleation layer provides backside ohmic contact to MBE-grown GaN nanowires
Authors: Stanislav Tiagulskyi, Roman Yatskiv, Marta Sobanska, Karol Olszewski, Zbigniew R. Zytkiewicz, Jan Grym
Abstract: Self-assembled GaN nanowires are typically grown on Si substrates with convenient nucleation layers. Light-emitting devices based on arrays of GaN nanowires require that the nucleation layer is electrically conductive and optically nontransparent to prevent the absorption of generated light in the Si substrate. This study reports the molecular beam epitaxial growth of GaN nanowires on ZrN nucleation layers sputtered on sapphire and demonstrates that ZrN provides ohmic contact to dense vertical arrays of n-type GaN nanowires. The ohmic nature of the ZrN/n-type GaN nanowire contact is evidenced by the measurement of the current-voltage characteristics of individual as-grown nanowires using nanomanipulators in a scanning electron microscope. The limitations and advantages of single-nanowire measurements are discussed, and approaches to overcome these limitations are proposed. The feasibility of this concept is demonstrated by the measurement of single NWs with a p-n junction, exhibiting highly rectifying characteristics.

Title: Confined colloidal droplets dry to form circular mazes
Authors: Ilaria Beechey-Newman, Natalya Kizilova, Andreas Andersen Hennig, Eirik Grude Flekkøy, Erika Eiser
Abstract: During drying, particle-laden sessile droplets will leave so-called coffee-stain rings behind. This phenomenon is well-known and well-understood (Deegan et al., Nature 389, 827-829 (1997)). Here we show that when particle-laden droplets confined in a slit are allowed to evaporate very slowly, they do not deposit coffee rings, but form a surprisingly intricate, circular maze-like pattern. We present experiments that illustrate this pattern formation and discuss the factors that determine when such patterns can form. We are not aware of reports of natural examples of the formation of such beautiful patterns under confinement, although it seems likely that they exist.

Title: Temperature as Joules per Bit
Authors: Charles Alexandre Bédard, Sophie Berthelette, Xavier Coiteux-Roy, Stefan Wolf
Abstract: In statistical mechanics, entropy is defined as a fundamental quantity. However, its unit, J/K, involves that of temperature, which is only subsequently defined - and defined in terms of entropy. This circularity arises with the introduction of Boltzmann's constant into the very expression of entropy. The J/K carried by the constant prevents entropy from finding a unit of its own while simultaneously obfuscating its informational nature. Following the precepts of information theory, we argue that entropy is well measured in bits and coincides with information capacity at thermodynamic equilibrium. Consequently, not only is the temperature of a system in equilibrium expressed in J/bit, but it acquires a clear meaning: It is the cost in energy to increase its information capacity by 1 bit. Viewing temperature as joules per bit uncovers the strong duality exhibited by Gibbs long ago between available capacity and free energy. It also simplifies Landauer's cost and clarifies that it is a cost of displacement, not of erasure. Replacing the kelvin with the bit as an SI unit would remove Boltzmann's constant from the seven defining constants.

Title: Thermal and Quantum Phase Transitions of the $ϕ^4$ Model
Authors: István Gábor Márián, Andrea Trombettoni, István Nándori
Abstract: The critical behaviour of the classical (thermal) phase transition (CPT) of the Ising model is in the same universality class of the quantum phase transition (QPT) of the $\phi^4$ Quantum Field Theory (QFT), this being a paradigmatic example of the relation between a CPT and its quantum counterpart QPT. It is well known that a classical system in $d$ dimension is -- for short-range interactions -- in the same universality class of the same model in $d-1$ spatial dimension at $T=0$. Nevertheless, to extend the renormalization group (RG) equations of the very same model from $T=0$ to finite $T$ in the usual way resorting to sums on the Matsubara frequencies may lead to subtelties and even to the disappearance of the critical points as extracted from the RG flow, as we comment more in the text. Our goal in this work is to discuss this issue and map out the QPT-CPT diagram focusing as an example on the $\phi^4$ QFT, revisiting its relation to the well-known QPT-CPT phase diagram of the Ising model. To this aim, we propose a modification of the usual finite-temperature RG approach by relating the temperature parameter to the running RG scale, $T \equiv k_T = \tau k$ where $k_T$ is the running cutoff for thermal, and $k$ is for the quantum fluctuations. Once introduced this dimesionless temperature $\tau$, we investigate the consequences on the thermal RG approach for the $\phi^4$ model and construct its QPT-CPT phase diagram. Finally, we formulate requirements for the QPT-CPT phase diagram of the $\phi^4$ theory based on known properties of the QPT-CPT phase diagram of the Ising model.

Title: Quantum reservoir computing on random regular graphs
Authors: Moein N. Ivaki, Achilleas Lazarides, Tapio Ala-Nissila
Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) is a low-complexity learning paradigm that combines the inherent dynamics of input-driven many-body quantum systems with classical learning techniques for nonlinear temporal data processing. Optimizing the QRC process and computing device is a complex task due to the dependence of many-body quantum systems to various factors. To explore this, we introduce a strongly interacting spin model on random regular graphs as the quantum component and investigate the interplay between static disorder, interactions, and graph connectivity, revealing their critical impact on quantum memory capacity and learnability accuracy. We tackle linear quantum and nonlinear classical tasks, and identify optimal learning and memory regimes through studying information localization, dynamical quantum correlations, and the many-body structure of the disordered Hamiltonian. In particular, we uncover the role of previously overlooked network connectivity and demonstrate how the presence of quantum correlations can significantly enhance the learning performance. Our findings thus provide guidelines for the optimal design of disordered analog quantum learning platforms.

Title: A Strategy for Proving the Strong Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis : Chaotic Systems and Holography
Authors: Taishi Kawamoto
Abstract: The strong eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) provides a sufficient condition for thermalization and equilibration. Although it is expected to be hold in a wide class of highly chaotic theories, there are only a few analytic examples demonstrating the strong ETH in special cases, often through methods related to integrability. In this paper, we explore sufficient conditions for the strong ETH that may apply to a broad range of chaotic theories. These conditions are expressed as inequalities involving the long-time averages of real-time thermal correlators. Specifically, as an illustration, we consider simple toy examples which satisfy these conditions under certain technical assumptions. This toy models have same properties as holographic theories at least in the perturbation in large $N$. We give a few comments for more realistic holographic models.

Title: Third-order Orbital Corner State and its Realization in Acoustic Crystals
Authors: Jiyu Wang, Ying Chen, Xiancong Lu
Abstract: Three dimensional (3D) third-order topological insulators (TIs) have zero-dimensional (0D) corner states, which are three dimensions lower than bulk. Here we investigate the third-order TIs on breathing pyrochlore lattices with p-orbital freedom. The tight-binding Hamiltonian is derived for the p-orbital model, in which we find that the two orthogonal ${\pi}$-type (transverse) hoppings are the key to open a band gap and obtain higher-order topological corner states. We introduce the Z4 berry phase to characterize the bulk topology and analysis the phase diagram. The corner states, demonstrated in a finite structure of a regular tetrahedron, exhibit rich 3D orbital configurations. Furthermore, we design an acoustic system to introduce the necessary ${\pi}$-type hopping and successfully observe the orbital corner states. Our work extends topological orbital corner states to third-order, which enriches the contents of orbital physics and may lead to applications in novel topological acoustic devices.

Title: Applications of Statistical Field Theory in Deep Learning
Authors: Zohar Ringel, Noa Rubin, Edo Mor, Moritz Helias, Inbar Seroussi
Abstract: Deep learning algorithms have made incredible strides in the past decade yet due to the complexity of these algorithms, the science of deep learning remains in its early stages. Being an experimentally driven field, it is natural to seek a theory of deep learning within the physics paradigm. As deep learning is largely about learning functions and distributions over functions, statistical field theory, a rich and versatile toolbox for tackling complex distributions over functions (fields) is an obvious choice of formalism. Research efforts carried out in the past few years have demonstrated the ability of field theory to provide useful insights on generalization, implicit bias, and feature learning effects. Here we provide a pedagogical review of this emerging line of research.
