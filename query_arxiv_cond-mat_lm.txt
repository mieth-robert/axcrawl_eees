Title: General expression for the energy and the equation of state for polycrystalline solids
Authors: O. Bystrenko, B. Ilkiv, S. Petrovska, T. Bystrenko, O. Foia, O. Khyzhun (Frantsevich Institute for problems of materials science, Kyiv, Ukraine)
Abstract: On the basis of the extended classical elasticity theory, we propose universal semi-empirical analytical expressions for the energy and the equation of state for poly-crystalline solids. The validation of the relations has been made by means of first principle density functional theory simulations with the use of pseudo-potential approach and generalized gradient approximation for the exchange-correlation energy. The calculations performed for a large number of inorganic crystalline compounds with metal, covalent and ionic bonding (including diamond, Mg, sphalerite, B, magnesium carboboride, topaz, rocksalt, etc.) within the pressure range from -20 GPa to 300 GPa demonstrated an excellent agreement with the predictions of the analytical theory. The proposed relations can be used to describe the behavior of poly-crystalline solids at high pressure, in particular, to predict pressure-induced phase transitions.

Title: Learning to predict superconductivity
Authors: Omri Lesser, Yanjun Liu, Natalie Maus, Aaditya Panigrahi, Krishnanand Mallayya, Leslie M. Schoop, Jacob R. Gardner, Eun-Ah Kim
Abstract: Predicting the superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) of materials remains a major challenge in condensed matter physics due to the lack of a comprehensive and quantitative theory. We present a data-driven approach that combines chemistry-informed feature extraction with interpretable machine learning to predict $T_c$ and classify superconducting materials. We develop a systematic featurization scheme that integrates structural and elemental information through graphlet histograms and symmetry vectors. Using experimentally validated structural data from the 3DSC database, we construct a curated, featurized dataset and design a new kernel to incorporate histogram features into Gaussian-process (GP) regression and classification. This framework yields an interpretable $T_c$ predictor with an $ R^2$ value of 0.93 and a superconductor classifier with quantified uncertainties. Feature-significance analysis further reveals that GP $T_c$ predictor can achieve near-optimal performance only using four second-order graphlet features. In particular, we discovered a previously overlooked feature of electron affinity difference between neighboring atoms as a universally predictive descriptor. Our graphlet-histogram approach not only highlights bonding-related elemental descriptors as unexpectedly powerful predictors of superconductivity but also provides a broadly applicable framework for predictive modeling of diverse material properties.

Title: Emergent spacetime supersymmetry at 2D fractionalized quantum criticality
Authors: Zhengzhi Wu, Zhou-Quan Wan, Shao-Kai Jian, Hong Yao
Abstract: While experimental evidence for spacetime supersymmetry (SUSY) in particle physics remains elusive, condensed matter systems offer a promising arena for its emergence at quantum critical points (QCPs). Although there have been a variety of proposals for emergent SUSY at symmetry-breaking QCPs, the emergence of SUSY at fractionalized QCPs remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate emergent space-time SUSY at a fractionalized QCP in the Kitaev honeycomb model with Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) spin-phonon coupling. Specifically, through numerical computations and analytical analysis, we show that the anisotropic SSH-Kitaev model hosts a fractionalized QCP between a Dirac spin liquid and an incommensurate/commensurate valence-bond-solid phase coexisting with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order. A low-energy field theory incorporating phonon quantum fluctuations reveals that this fractionalized QCP features an emergent $\mathcal{N}=2$ spacetime SUSY. We further discuss their universal experimental signatures in thermal transport and viscosity, highlighting the concrete lattice realization of emergent SUSY at a fractionalized QCP in 2D.

Title: Localization of information driven by stochastic resetting
Authors: Camille Aron, Manas Kulkarni
Abstract: The dynamics of extended many-body systems are generically chaotic. Classically, a hallmark of chaos is the exponential sensitivity to initial conditions captured by positive Lyapunov exponents. Supplementing chaotic dynamics with stochastic resetting drives a sharp dynamical phase transition: we show that the Lyapunov spectrum, i.e., the complete set of Lyapunov exponents, abruptly collapses to zero above a critical resetting rate. At criticality, we find a sudden loss of analyticity of the velocity-dependent Lyapunov exponent, which we relate to the transition from ballistic scrambling of information to an arrested regime where information becomes exponentially localized over a characteristic length diverging at criticality with an exponent $\nu = 1/2$. We illustrate our analytical results on generic chaotic dynamics by numerical simulations of coupled map lattices.

Title: Measuring intrinsic relaxation rates in superconductors using nonlinear response
Authors: Wei-En Tseng, Rahul Nandkishore
Abstract: We discuss intrinsic relaxation rates in superconductors, and how they may be measured using non-linear optical (terahertz) response. We consider both $s$ and $d$-wave superconductors, both with and without a phenomenological (energy dependent) damping. Intrinsic relaxation rates of interest include the Higgs mode decay rate, the quasiparticle redistribution rate ($1/T_1$) and the quasiparticle dephasing rate ($1/T_2$), where the latter two rates are zero in the pure BCS model, but non-zero in the presence of damping. Using the Anderson pseudospin formalism, we illustrate how these intrinsic relaxation rates are related to measurable quantities such as the time-dependent gap function and the non-linear current (a.k.a. third harmonic generation). Hence, we show how intrinsic relaxation rates may be experimentally extracted and discuss what one may thereby learn about the underlying damping. We also discuss the effects of polarization control (viz. non-linear response to light polarized in different directions), which offers a useful experimental knob, especially for $d$-wave superconductors, enabling selective excitation of modes in different irreducible representations (and readout of their corresponding relaxation rates).

Title: Attention to Order: Transformers Discover Phase Transitions via Learnability
Authors: Şener Özönder
Abstract: Phase transitions mark qualitative reorganizations of collective behavior, yet identifying their boundaries remains challenging whenever analytic solutions are absent and conventional simulations fail. Here we introduce learnability as a universal criterion, defined as the ability of a transformer model containing attention mechanism to extract structure from microscopic states. Using self-supervised learning and Monte Carlo generated configurations of the two-dimensional Ising model, we show that ordered phases correspond to enhanced learnability, manifested in both reduced training loss and structured attention patterns, while disordered phases remain resistant to learning. Two unsupervised diagnostics, the sharp jump in training loss and the rise in attention entropy, recover the critical temperature in excellent agreement with the exact value. Our results establish learnability as a data-driven marker of phase transitions and highlight deep parallels between long-range order in condensed matter and the emergence of structure in modern language models.

Title: Pareto-optimality of Majoranas in hybrid platforms
Authors: Juan Daniel Torres Luna, Sebastian Miles, A. Mert Bozkurt, Chun-Xiao Liu, Antonio L. R. Manesco, Anton R. Akhmerov, Michael Wimmer
Abstract: To observe Majorana bound states, and especially to use them as a qubit, requires careful optimization of competing quality metrics. We systematically compare Majorana quality in proximitized semiconductor nanowires and quantum dot chains. Using multi-objective optimization, we analyze the fundamental trade-offs between topological gap and localization length, two key metrics that determine MBS coherence and operational fidelity. We demonstrate that these quantities cannot be simultaneously optimized in realistic models, creating Pareto frontiers that define the achievable parameter space. Our results show that QD chains achieve both comparable quality as nanowires and a regime with a much shorter localization length, making them particularly promising for near-term quantum computing applications where device length and disorder are limiting factors.

Title: Superfluidity in Fermi systems within the framework of Density Functional Theory
Authors: Piotr Magierski
Abstract: This review is based on lectures given by the author at the Enrico Fermi Summer School in Varenna. It presents the basics of Density Functional Theory (DFT) for Fermi superfluids, with particular emphasis on nuclear systems. Special attention is given to the foundations of both DFT and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT). The review explores the advantages and challenges involved in the practical application of TDDFT to superfluid systems, as well as the typical approximations employed. Various applications of the TDDFT framework to the description of phenomena related to nonequilibrium superfluidity in atomic nuclei, neutron stars, and ultracold atoms are discussed.

Title: From two dimensions to wire networks in a dice-lattice Josephson array
Authors: J. D. Bondar, L. Banszerus, W. Marshall, T. Lindemann, T. Zhang, M. J. Manfra, C. M. Marcus, S. Vaitiekėnas
Abstract: We investigate Josephson arrays consisting of a dice-lattice network of superconducting weak links surrounding rhombic plaquettes of proximitized semiconductor. Josephson coupling of the weak links and electron density in the plaquettes are independently controlled by separate electrostatic gates. Applied magnetic flux results in an intricate pattern of switching currents associated with frustration, $f$. For depleted plaquettes, the switching current is nearly periodic in $f$, expected for a phase-only description, while occupied plaquettes yield a decreasing envelope of switching currents with increasing $f$. A model of flux dependence based on ballistic small-area junctions and diffusive large-area plaquettes yields excellent agreement with experiment.

Title: Bayesian Optimization of Multi-Bit Pulse Encoding in In2O3/Al2O3 Thin-film Transistors for Temporal Data Processing
Authors: Javier Meza-Arroyo, Benius Dunn, Weijie Xu, Yu-Chieh Chen, Jen-Sue Chen, Julia W.P. Hsu
Abstract: Utilizing the intrinsic history-dependence and nonlinearity of hardware, physical reservoir computing is a promising neuromorphic approach to encode time-series data for in-sensor computing. The accuracy of this encoding critically depends on the distinguishability of multi-state outputs, which is often limited by suboptimal and empirically chosen reservoir operation conditions. In this work, we demonstrate a machine learning approach, Bayesian optimization, to improve the encoding fidelity of solution-processed Al2O3/In2O3 thin-film transistors (TFTs). We show high-fidelity 6-bit temporal encoding by exploring five key pulse parameters and using the normalized degree of separation (nDoS) as the metric of output state separability. Additionally, we show that a model trained on simpler 4-bit data can effectively guide optimization of more complex 6-bit encoding tasks, reducing experimental cost. Specifically, for the encoding and reconstruction of binary-patterned images of a moving car across 6 sequential frames, we demonstrate that the encoding is more accurate when operating the TFT using optimized pulse parameters and the 4-bit optimized operating condition performs almost as well as the 6-bit optimized condition. Finally, interpretability analysis via Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) reveals that gate pulse amplitude and drain voltage are the most influential parameters in achieving higher state separation. This work presents the first systematic method to identify optimal operating conditions for reservoir devices, and the approach can be extended to other physical reservoir implementations across different material platforms.

Title: Electric susceptibility of antiferromagnetic multiferroics with cycloidal spin order at magnetoelectric effect associated with collinear component of spins
Authors: Pavel A. Andreev
Abstract: The contribution of magnetoelectric effect to Landau--Lifshitz-Gilbert equation is considered in case when medium polarization is caused by parallel component of neighboring spins. The result is presented for ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic materials. A comparison is given with the contribution of magnetoelectric effect to Landau--Lifshitz-Gilbert equation when medium polarization is caused by perpendicular component of spins. The dispersion dependence of spin waves in antiferromagnets with cycloidal equilibrium spin order is derived. The electric susceptibility and permittivity of antiferromagnetic multiferroics in which magnetoelectric effect is caused by collinear component of spins is obtained analytically.

Title: Effects of skewing collision cells on transport properties in multiparticle collision dynamics simulations
Authors: Jinny Cha, Wilfred Kwabena Darko, Jeremy C. Palmer, Michael P. Howard
Abstract: Multiparticle collision dynamics (MPCD) is a mesoscale simulation technique that uses a simplified solvent to model hydrodynamic interactions. Rather than interact through pairwise forces, MPCD solvent particles undergo momentum-exchanging collisions within spatially localized cells according to prescribed rules. The conventional MPCD algorithm employs cubic collision cells, but this choice is not optimal for systems that are most naturally described using skewed simulation boxes. Here, we investigate the behavior of a modified MPCD scheme in which the collision cells are aligned with the vectors that define a triclinic (parallelepiped) simulation box. We find that skewing the collision cells has a small but statistically significant impact on the transport properties of the pure solvent. Similar, but more pronounced, effects are found for nearly hard spheres in solution, including a significant decrease in their nominal self-diffusion coefficient and unphysical anisotropy in their self-diffusion tensor. Thus, our analysis indicates that skewed MPCD collision cells may result in spurious behavior and should be used with caution. We posit that these artifacts may be mitigated by grid-free schemes for placing particles into collision cells.

Title: Quantum Filtering of Hydrogen Isotopes through Graphene
Authors: Joshua Hale, Theja N. De Silva
Abstract: Driven by the growing demand in the energy, medical, and industrial sectors, we investigate a hydrogen isotope separation technique that offers both a high separation factor and economic feasibility. Our findings reveal that filtering isotopes through two-dimensional graphene layers provides an exceptionally efficient quantum-mechanical method for isotope separation. Using a recently developed analytical pairwise potential between hydrogen isotopes and carbon atoms in graphene, we examine the classical trajectories of isotopes near the graphene layer, as well as the quantum-mechanical tunneling properties of isotopes through the graphene layer. Using various quantum-mechanical methods, we calculate both the isotope tunneling probabilities and the quantum-mechanical isotope sticking probabilities. Our study shows that quantum filtering through graphene layers can be an effective technique for enriching deuterium by separating it from protium.

Title: Ultrathin bismuth-yttrium iron garnet films with tunable and compensated magnetic anisotropy
Authors: Hanchen Wang, William Legrand, Davit Petrosyan, Min-Gu Kang, Emir Karadža, Hiroki Matsumoto, Richard Schlitz, Michaela Lammel, Myriam H. Aguirre, Pietro Gambardella
Abstract: We report on the epitaxial growth of nm-thick films of bismuth-substituted yttrium iron garnet (BiYIG) by high-temperature off-axis radio-frequency magnetron sputtering. We demonstrate accurate control of the magnetic properties by tuning of the sputtering parameters and epitaxial strain on various (111)-oriented garnet substrates. BiYIG films with up to -0.80\% lattice mismatch with the substrate remain fully strained up to 60~nm-thick, maintaining a high crystalline quality. Transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy confirm coherent epitaxial growth, the absence of defects, and limited interdiffusion at the BiYIG/substrate interface. Varying the tensile or compressive strain between -0.80\% and +0.56\% in BiYIG allows for accurate compensation of the total magnetic anisotropy through magneto-elastic coupling. The effective magnetic anisotropy of sputtered BiYIG films can be further tuned via the off-axis deposition angle and the oxygen flow during growth, which determine the cation stoichiometry. Under optimized growth conditions, a ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) linewidth of 1~mT at 10~GHz is reliably obtained even for thicknesses as low as 10~nm. We also report small FMR linewidths in ultrathin (2-5~nm) BiYIG films grown on diamagnetic substrate yttrium scandium gallium garnet. These findings highlight the promise of low-damping, strain-engineered nm-thick BiYIG films for implementing advanced functionalities in spin-orbitronic and magnonic devices. Specifically, the magnetic-anisotropy compensation and low damping enable large cone-angle magnetization dynamics immune to magnon-magnon nonlinear scattering.

Title: Dissipative Generation of Currents by Nonreciprocal Local and Global Environments
Authors: Catalin-Mihai Halati
Abstract: We investigate the mechanisms necessary for the stabilization of complex quantum correlations by exploring dissipative couplings to nonreciprocal reservoirs. We analyze the role of locality in the coupling to the environment of the quantum system of interest, as we consider either local couplings throughout the system, or a single global coupling. We contrast the results obtained for two scenarios in which a chain of strongly interacting hardcore bosonic atoms is coupled directly to Markovian kinetic dissipative processes, or experiences effective dissipation through the mediation of the field of a lossy optical cavity. To investigate the dissipative dynamics of the many-body quantum systems considered we perform numerical simulations employing matrix product states numerical methods. We show that by coupling atomic tunneling terms to the global field of a dissipative cavity we can stabilize at long times both finite currents and current-current correlations throughout the atomic chain. This is in contrast to the setup in which dissipation acts directly via local tunneling processes, where currents arise in a small portion of the system and the current-current correlations are rapidly decaying.

Title: Efficiency of the superconducting diode effect of pair-density-wave states in two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnets
Authors: Igor de M. Froldi, Hermann Freire
Abstract: We systematically study the efficiency of the intrinsic superconducting diode effect of several pair-density-wave states that can emerge in two-dimensional $d$-wave metallic altermagnets. To this end, we investigate several scenarios using an effective minimal microscopic model and Ginzburg-Landau analysis in order to derive the corresponding pairing phase diagrams. In addition, we examine also whether the presence of a Rashba spin-orbit coupling and an applied external magnetic field are beneficial to this effect in these systems. As a consequence, our results add further support to the fact that altermagnetic materials indeed provide a good platform for the pursuit of finite-momentum superconductivity, which can lead to an optimization of the diode efficiency in some physically interesting situations. The latter phenomenon has been recently proposed to be key in improving the applicability of new energy-efficient quantum electronic devices.

Title: Thermodynamically Consistent Continuum Theory of Magnetic Particles in High-Gradient Fields
Authors: Marko Tesanovic, Daniel M. Markiewitz, Marcus L. Popp, Martin Z. Bazant, Sonja Berensmeier
Abstract: Magnetic particles underpin a broad range of technologies, from water purification and mineral processing to bioseparations and targeted drug delivery. The dynamics of magnetic particles in high-gradient magnetic fields-encompassing both their transport and eventual capture-arise from the coupled interplay of field-driven drift, fluid advection, and particle-field feedback. These processes remain poorly captured by existing models relying on empirical closures or discrete particle tracking. Here, we present a thermodynamically consistent continuum theory for collective magnetic particle transport and capture in high-gradient fields. The framework derives from a free-energy functional that couples magnetic energy, entropic mixing, and steric interactions, yielding a concentration-dependent susceptibility via homogenization theory. The resulting equations unify magnetism, mass transport, and momentum balances without ad hoc shut-off criteria, allowing field shielding, anisotropic deposition, and boundary-layer confinement to emerge naturally. Simulations predict canonical capture morphologies-axially aligned plumes, crescent-shaped deposits, and nonlinear shielding-across field strengths and flow regimes, consistent with trends reported in prior experimental and modeling studies. By organizing captured particle mass data into a dimensionless phase diagram based on the Mason number, we reveal three distinct regimes-thermodynamically controlled, transitional, and dynamically controlled. This perspective provides a predictive platform for in silico optimization and extension to three-dimensional geometries, and informing digital twin development for industrial-scale high-gradient magnetic separation processes.

Title: Anomalous proteinaceous shells with octagonal local order
Authors: Sergei B. Rochal, Aleksey S. Roshal, Olga V. Konevtsova, Rudolf Podgornik
Abstract: Proteinaceous shells useful for various biomedical applications exhibit a wide range of anomalous structures that are fundamentally different from icosahedral viral capsids described by the Caspar-Klug paradigmatic model. Exploring the Protein Data Bank, we have identified nine different types of anomalous shells structurally close to flat octagonal quasicrystals. As we show, these numerous shells have cubic nets cut from short-period approximants of an octagonal tiling composed of square and rhombic tiles. The approximants and parent tiling are easily obtained within the Landau density wave approach, while the nonequilibrium assembly of them can be simulated using the pair potentials derived from critical density waves. Gluing a polyhedron net and mapping it onto a spherical surface induces tile distortions, and to reduce them, we introduce and minimize the effective elastic energy of the system. Thus, we return quasi-equivalence to previously equivalent tiles. Possible cubic faceting of the octagonal spherical tilings is discussed in terms of the topological charge distribution over the tiling vertices. The proposed structural models describe numerous proteinaceous shells including about half of the known symmetrical enzymes. Our results constitute a fundamental basis for further applications of identified octagonal assemblies and can help to discover and study similar systems in the future.

Title: What is the most optimal diffusion?
Authors: Vasili Baranau
Abstract: What is the fastest possible "diffusion"? A trivial answer would be "a process that converts a Dirac delta-function into a uniform distribution infinitely fast". Below, we consider a more reasonable formulation: a process that maximizes differential entropy of a probability density function (pdf) $f(\vec{x}, t)$ at every time $t$, under certain restrictions. Specifically, we focus on a case when the rate of the Kullback-Leibler divergence $D_{\text{KL}}$ is fixed. If $\Delta(\vec{x}, t, d{t}) = \frac{\partial f}{ \partial t} d{t}$ is the pdf change at a time step $d{t}$, we maximize the differential entropy $H[f + \Delta]$ under the restriction $D_{\text{KL}}(f + \Delta || f) = A^2 d{t}^2$, $A = \text{const} > 0$. It leads to the following equation: $\frac{\partial f}{ \partial t} = - \kappa f (\ln{f} - \int f \ln{f} d{\vec{x}})$, with $\kappa = \frac{A}{\sqrt{ \int f \ln^2{f} d{\vec{x}} - \left( \int f \ln{f} d{\vec{x}} \right)^2 } }$. Notably, this is a non-local equation, so the process is different from the Itô diffusion and a corresponding Fokker-Planck equation. We show that the normal and exponential distributions are solutions to this equation, on $(-\infty; \infty)$ and $[0; \infty)$, respectively, both with $\text{variance} \sim e^{2 A t}$, i.e. diffusion is highly anomalous. We numerically demonstrate for sigmoid-like functions on a segment that the entropy change rate $\frac{d H}{d t}$ produced by such an optimal "diffusion" is, as expected, higher than produced by the "classical" diffusion.

Title: Nonreciprocal Spin-Wave Dynamics in Crescent-Shaped Ferromagnetic Nanowires
Authors: Uladzislau Makartsou, Mateusz Gołębiewski, Attila Kákay, Olena Tartakivska, Maciej Krawczyk
Abstract: Recent progress in the study of spin-wave propagation in ferromagnetic waveguides has highlighted the role of nonreciprocity arising from both the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and the chiral nature of dipolar interactions. In this paper, we examine how a nanowire with a crescent-shaped cross-section affects spin-wave propagation along its long axis when a bias magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the axis. Employing micromagnetic simulations supported by analytical modeling, we systematically analyze the effects of geometry and external magnetic field strength on the magnetization dynamics and spin-wave amplitude distribution. The results demonstrate that these factors modify the dispersion relation of spin waves and influence its nonreciprocity, which can vary depending on the mode type. This work advances the fundamental understanding of spin-wave dynamics in curved geometries and offers new perspectives for designing magnonic waveguides with tailored properties.

Title: Quantizing Bosonized Fermi Surfaces
Authors: Sihan Chen, Luca V. Delacretaz
Abstract: Bosonization describes Fermi surface dynamics in terms of a collective field that lives on a part of phase space. While sensible semiclassically, the challenge of treating such a field quantum mechanically has prevented bosonization from providing as powerful a nonperturbative tool as in one dimension. We show that general Fermi surfaces can be exactly described by a particular $N\to \infty$ limit of a $U(N)_1$ WZW model, with a tower of irrelevant corrections. This matrix-valued description encodes the noncommutative nature of phase space, and its (solvable) strongly coupled dynamics resolves the naive overcounting of degrees of freedom of the collective field without the need to cut the Fermi surface into patches. This approach furthermore provides a quantitative tool to systematically study power-law corrections to Fermi surface dynamics.

Title: Magnetotransport in Topological Materials and Nonlinear Hall Effect via First-Principles Electronic Interactions and Band Topology
Authors: Dhruv C. Desai, Lauren A. Tan, Jin-Jian Zhou, Shiyu Peng, Jinsoo Park, Marco Bernardi
Abstract: Topological effects arising from the Berry curvature lead to intriguing transport signatures in quantum materials. Two such phenomena are the chiral anomaly and nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE). A unified description of these transport regimes requires a quantitative treatment of both band topology and electron scattering. Here, we show accurate predictions of the magnetoresistance in topological semimetals and NLHE in noncentrosymmetric materials by solving the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) with electron-phonon ($e$-ph) scattering and Berry curvature computed from first principles. We apply our method to study magnetotransport in a prototypical Weyl semimetal, TaAs, and the NLHE in strained monolayer WSe$_2$, bilayer WTe$_2$ and bulk BaMnSb$_2$. In TaAs, we find a chiral contribution to the magnetoconductance which is positive and increases with magnetic field, consistent with experiments. We show that $e$-ph interactions can significantly modify the Berry curvature dipole and its dependence on temperature and Fermi level, highlighting the interplay of band topology and electronic interactions in nonlinear transport. The computed nonlinear Hall response in BaMnSb$_2$ is in agreement with experiments. By adding the Berry curvature to first-principles transport calculations, our work advances the quantitative analysis of a wide range of linear and nonlinear transport phenomena in quantum materials.

Title: Magnetically Responsive Microprintable Soft Nanocomposites with Tunable Nanoparticle Loading
Authors: Rachel M. Sun, Andrew Y. Chen, Yiming Ji, Daryl W. Yee, Carlos M. Portela
Abstract: Magnetic remote actuation of soft materials has been demonstrated at the macroscale using hard-magnetic particles for applications such as transforming materials and medical robots. However, due to manufacturing limitations, few microscale magnetically responsive devices exist -- light-based additive manufacturing methods, which are ideal for realizing microscale features, struggle with light scattering induced by the magnetic particles. Moreover, large hard-magnetic microparticles prevent high-resolution features from being manufactured altogether, and soft-magnetic nanoparticles require impractically high loading and high magnetic gradients, incompatible with existing printing techniques. Among successfully fabricated microscale soft-magnetic composites, limited control over magnetic-particle loading, distribution, and matrix-phase stiffness has hindered their functionality. Here, we combine two-photon lithography with iron-oxide nanoparticle co-precipitation to fabricate 3D-printed microscale nanocomposites having features down to 8 um with spatially tunable nanoparticle distribution. Using uniaxial compression experiments and vibrating sample magnetometry, we characterize the mechanical and magnetic properties of the composite, achieving millimeter-scale elastic deformations. We control nanoparticle content by modulating laser power of the print to imbue complex parts with magnetic functionality, demonstrated by a soft robotic gripper and a bistable bit register and sensor. This approach enables precise control of structure and functionality, advancing the development of microscale metamaterials and robots with tunable mechanical and magnetic properties.

Title: Unified microscopic theory of equilibrium thermodynamics and ion association in aqueous and non-aqueous electrolytes with explicit hard-core size
Authors: Sahin Buyukdagli
Abstract: Within the framework of a functional integral formalism incorporating ionic charge and hard-core (HC) interactions on an equal footing, we formulate a unified theory of equilibrium thermodynamics and ion association in charged solutions. Via comparison with recent Monte-Carlo (MC) simulation results (J. Forsman et al., PCCP 26, 19921 (2024)), it is shown that our approach is able to predict with quantitative precision the pair distributions of monovalent ions with the typical hydrated sizes d = 3.0 A and 4.0 A up to the molar concentration ni = 2.0 M. Moreover, comparison with additional simulation data from the literature indicates that within the characteristic regime of ionic packing fraction eta <0.1, the formalism can accurately account for the ion size dependence of the excess energy and pressure from d = 14.3 A down to d = 1.6 A. Via the adjustment of the hydration radius, the theory can also reproduce the non-monotonic salt dependence of the experimentally measured osmotic coefficients of various aqueous and non-aqueous solutions. In accordance with AFM experiments involving non-aqueous electrolytes, the underlying sharp competition between the opposite charge attraction and the excluded volume constraint is shown to limit the occurrence of substantial ionic pair formation to the submolar concentration regime ni <50 mM; at larger concentrations, HC repulsion hinders ion association and results in the quasi-saturation of the pair fraction curves.

Title: Low-Temperature Skyrmions and Spiral Reorientation Processes in Chiral Magnets with Cubic Anisotropy: Guidelines for Bridging Theory and Experiment
Authors: A. O. Leonov, G. Gödecke, J. Grefe, S. Süllow, D. Menzel
Abstract: We revisit the phenomenological Dzyaloshinskii framework, a central theoretical approach for describing magnetization processes in bulk chiral magnets, and demonstrate how magnetocrystalline cubic anisotropy reshapes the phase diagrams of states and provides the key mechanism stabilizing low-temperature skyrmion phases. We show that, for magnetic field directions along the easy anisotropy axes, the phase diagrams feature stable skyrmion pockets for both signs of the anisotropy constant. We further analyze the nature of the transitions at the critical field $H_{c1}$, associated with the reorientation of stable and metastable spirals along the field. We also examine the transition at $H_{c2}$, where the conical state closes into the homogeneous state accompanied by a deviation of the wave vector from the field direction. By mapping characteristic anisotropy-dependent parameters in the theoretical phase diagrams, we provide guidelines for connecting theory with experiment and for estimating the cubic anisotropy constant in Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$Si and MnSi. Our results indicate that samples Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$Si with small $x \sim 0.1$ possess sufficiently strong cubic anisotropy to stabilize a low-temperature skyrmion phase. Overall, these theoretical findings establish a quantitative framework for predicting and interpreting skyrmion stability in other cubic helimagnets as well.

Title: Superconducting meander-line surface coil for NMR spectroscopy of nanoscale thin films
Authors: Louis Beaudoin, Aimé Verrier, Youcef A. Bioud, Mathieu Massicotte, Bertrand Reulet, Jeffrey A. Quilliam
Abstract: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a powerful technique to study local magnetism in a variety of materials. However, the inherently low sensitivity of conventional inductively detected solid state NMR typically requires a large number of spins, reducing its applicability to two-dimensional (2D) materials and nanoscale thin films. To overcome this experimental challenge, we introduce a novel probe based on a superconducting meander-line surface coil that significantly enhances the NMR sensitivity for thin samples. Using a NbN meander with an optimized geometry, we demonstrate the sensitivity of this technique by detecting the NMR signal of a 150-nm-thick boron film containing only $\sim 2\times10^{16}$ $^{11}$B nuclear spins. Spin-echo measurements and theoretical modeling offer insight into the parameters limiting the coil's performance. This work lays the foundation for developing highly sensitive NMR probes, potentially unlocking new opportunities for studying atomically thin materials.

Title: Thermoelectric Enhancement of Series-Connected Cross-Conjugated Molecular Junctions
Authors: Justin P. Bergfield
Abstract: We investigate the thermoelectric response of single-molecule junctions composed of acyclic cross-conjugated molecules, including dendralene analogues and related iso-poly(diacetylene) (iso-PDA) motifs, in which node-possessing repeat units are connected in series. Using many-body quantum transport theory, we show that increasing the number of repeat units leaves the fundamental gap essentially unchanged while giving rise to a split-node spectrum whose cumulative broadening dramatically enhances the thermopower. This form of quantum enhancement can exceed other interference-based mechanisms, such as the coalescence of nodes into a supernode, suggesting new opportunities for scalable quantum-interference-based materials. Although illustrated here with cross-conjugated systems, the underlying principles apply broadly to series-connected architectures hosting multiple interference nodes. Finally, we evaluate the scaling of the electronic figure of merit ZT and the maximum thermodynamic efficiency. Together, these results highlight the potential for split-node-based materials to realize quantum-enhanced thermoelectric response.

Title: Chromium-doped uranium dioxide fuels: A review
Authors: Mack Wesley Cleveland, Andrew Nelson, Ericmoore Jossou
Abstract: UO2 doped with parts per million Cr2O3 powder is considered a potential near term accident tolerant fuel candidate. Here, the results of decades of industry and academic research into Cr-doped UO2 are analyzed and their shortcomings are critiqued. Focusing on the incorporation mechanisms of Cr into the fuel matrix, we explore a mechanistic understanding of the characteristic properties of Cr-doped UO2, notably, enhanced fission gas retention attributed to enlarged grain sizes following sintering, along with marginal improvements in the thermophysical properties. The findings of recent X-ray Adsorption Near Edge Spectroscopy studies were compared and put into conversation with historic data regarding the incorporation of Cr in UO2. On the basis of defect mechanisms, the case is made for the substitutional incorporation of Cr governing the lattice solubility but not the enhanced U diffusivity. Instead, Cr/Cr2O3 redox chemistry in a well-defined oxygen potential explains the differences in the U diffusivity and O/M ratio. The primary mechanism of doping-enhanced grain growth is found to be liquid assisted sintering due to a CrO(l) eutectic phase at the grain boundaries. The role of inhomogeneities in Cr concentration in UO2 at various length scales across the materials microstructure is highlighted and connected to promising experimental and modeling work to fill in the gaps in the current understanding of Cr-doped UO2. The review ends with an outline of future works that combine meticulous irradiation studies and high resolution experiments with next generation modeling and simulations techniques empowered by machine learning advances to accelerate the fabrication and adoption of Cr-doped UO2 light water reactors.

Title: Surface band-selective moiré effect induces flat band in mixed-dimensional heterostructures
Authors: Shuming Yu, Zhentao Fu, Dingkun Qin, Enting Li, Hao Zhong, Xingzhe Wang, Keming Zhao, Shangkun Mo, Qiang Wan, Yiwei Li, Jie Li, Jianxin Zhong, Hong Ding, Nan Xu
Abstract: In this work, we reveal a curious type of moiré effect that selectively modifies the surface states of bulk crystal. We synthesize mixed-dimensional heterostructures consisting of a noble gas monolayer grow on the surface of bulk Bi(111), and determine the electronic structure of the heterostructures using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We directly observe moiré replicas of the Bi(111) surface states, while the bulk states remain barely changed. Meanwhile, we achieve control over the moiré period in the range of 25 Å to 80 Å by selecting monolayers of different noble gases and adjusting the annealing temperature. At large moiré periods, we observe hybridization between the surface band replicas, which leads to the formation of a correlated flat band. Our results serve as a bridge for understanding the moiré modulation effect from 2D to 3D systems, and provide a feasible approach for the realization of correlated phenomena through the engineering of surface states via moiré effects.

Title: Probing Phase Diagrams of Ordered Two-Dimensional Ice
Authors: Bingzheng Wu, Jianming Wu, Sai Duan, Xin Xu
Abstract: Water, a ubiquitous and fundamental substance, plays a critical role across a wide range of disciplines from physics and chemistry to biology and engineering. Despite theoretical predictions of several phases of two-dimensional (2D) ice confined between idealized hydrophobic walls, experimental validation has been limited to the square phase, whose structural origin remains controversial. Here, we propose a realistic nanoconfinement setup using wide-bandgap hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) as the capping layer and Cu(111) as the substrate. This protocol enables scanning tunneling microscope (STM) to resolve the atomic-scale arrangement of water molecules beneath the h-BN layer, overcoming the limitations of conventional techniques. Simulated STM images unambiguously identify all ordered flat 2D ice phases, as well as coexisting phases, and effectively distinguish them from potential contaminants. These findings establish a robust framework for experiment to systematically probe the phase structures of 2D ice, opening an avenue for studying nanoconfined water under ambient conditions.

Title: Elucidation of the Correlation between Molecular Conformation and Shear Viscosity of Polymer Melts under Steady-State Shear Flow
Authors: Yuhi Sakamaki, Shota Goto, Kang Kim, Nobuyuki Matubayasi
Abstract: The rheological behavior of polymer melts is strongly influenced by parameters such as chain length, chain stiffness, and architecture. In particular, shear thinning, characterized by a power-law decrease in shear viscosity with increasing shear rate, has been widely investigated through molecular dynamics simulations. A central question is the connection between molecular conformation under steady flow and the resulting shear-thinning response. In this study, we employ coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of linear and ring polymers with varying chain stiffness to examine this relationship, with chain conformations quantified by the gyration tensor. We identified a strong correlation between the velocity-gradient direction component of the gyration tensor and shear viscosity, which exhibits a clear scaling relationship. This indicates that chain extension along the velocity-gradient direction governs the effective frictional force. Notably, this behavior emerges as a general feature, independent of chain architecture and chain stiffness. In addition, shear viscosity was found to correlate with the component of the gyration tensor that is not directly influenced by advective effects of shear flow. Because advection is absent in the direction, polymer chains can be regarded as diffusing freely, and the extent of this diffusion appears to be controlled by the shear viscosity.

Title: Dimension- and Facet-Dependent Altermagnetic Triferroics and Biferroics in CrSb
Authors: Long Zhang, Guoying Gao
Abstract: Altermagnets have recently garnered significant interest due to their vanishing net magnetic moment and non-relativistic momentum-dependent spin splitting. However, altermagnetic (AM) multiferroics especially triferroics remain scarce. We investigate the experimentally synthesized non-van der Waals CrSb as a model system to explore the effects of dimensionality and facet orientation on its ferroic properties. NiAs, MnP, wurtzite (WZ), zincblende (ZB), and rocksalt (RS) phases are considered. Using first-principles calculations, we predict the altermagnetism of CrSb in MnP phase which has comparable stability with experimental NiAs phase. Both NiAs- and MnP-phase (110) facets exhibit AM-ferroelastic (FC) biferroics, while the WZ-phase bulk and (001) facets host ferromagnetic (FM) or AM-ferroelectric (FE) biferroics. Notably, the WZ-phase (110) facets are identified as FM/AM-FE-FC triferroics, with moderate energy barriers of 0.129 and 0.363 eV atom-1 for FE and FC switching, respectively. Both FE and FC switching can reverse the AM spin splitting in antiferromagnetic (AFM) configurations while preserving the high spin polarization in FM states. The magnetic anisotropy is highly tunable, exhibiting either uniaxial or in-plane behavior depending on the phase, dimension, and facet. This work establishes a framework for designing AM multiferroics through polymorphic, dimensional, and facet engineering, offering promising avenues for multifunctional spintronic applications.

Title: Chiral Edge Excitations of Fractional Chern Insulators
Authors: Xiao-Han Yang, Ji-Yao Chen, Xiao-Yu Dong
Abstract: Edge excitations are the defining signature of chiral topologically ordered systems. In continuum fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states, these excitations are described by the chiral Luttinger liquid ($\chi$LL) theory. Whether this effective description remains valid for fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) on discrete lattices has been a longstanding open question. Here we numerically demonstrate that the charge-one edge spectral function of a $\nu=1/2$ FCI on an infinitely long strip with width $L_y=10$ quantitatively follows the predictions of $\chi$LL theory. The edge spectrum is gapless, chiral, and linear, with spectral weight increasing linearly with both momentum and energy. We further analyze the influence of lattice size, particle number, trapping potential, and charge sector of excitations on the edge properties. Our results establish a clear correspondence between lattice FCIs and continuum FQH systems and provide guidance for future experimental detection of chiral edge modes.

Title: Non-Kramers State Transitions in a Synthetic Toggle Switch Biosystem
Authors: Jianzhe Wei, Jingwen Zhu, Pan Chu, Liang Luo, Xiongfei Fu
Abstract: State transitions are fundamental in biological systems but challenging to observe directly. Here, we present the first single-cell observation of state transitions in a synthetic bacterial genetic circuit. Using a mother machine, we tracked over 1007 cells for 27 hours. First-passage analysis and dynamical reconstruction reveal that transitions occur outside the small-noise regime, challenging the applicability of classical Kramers' theory. The process lacks a single characteristic rate, questioning the paradigm of transitions between discrete cell states. We observe significant multiplicative noise that distorts the effective potential landscape yet increases transition times. These findings necessitate theoretical frameworks for biological state transitions beyond the small-noise assumption.

Title: Phase-controlled quantum transport signatures in a quantum dot-Majorana hybrid ring system
Authors: Sirui Yu, Junrong Wang, Huajin Zhao, Hong Mao, Jinshuang Jin
Abstract: We investigate the quantum transport in a hybrid ring system consisting of a quantum dot (QD) coupled to two Majorana bound states (MBSs) hosted in a topological superconducting nanowire, threaded by a magnetic flux. Utilizing the dissipaton equation-of-motion approach, we demonstrate that the differential conductance shows periodic behavior and its periodicity depends on both the QD energy level and the MBS overlapping. A zero-bias peak (ZBP) emerges as a result of the balance between normal and anomalous tunneling processes, associated with the presence of a single MBS. Beyond the phase-dependent periodic behavior, the shot noise exhibits voltage-dependent transitions between sub-Poissonian ($F = 0.5$), Poissonian ($F = 1$), and super-Poissonian ($F > 1$) regimes. Strikingly, we find a giant Fano factor ($F\gg1$) emerging at the balance point, accompanied by a peak in the shot noise. This distinctive feature may serve as a supplementary signature for MBS detection. However, both ZBP in the differential conductance and shot noise peak are degraded by thermal effects.

Title: Three-Dimensional Electrostatic and Quantum-Confinement Modeling of Silicon Nanowire Double Quantum Dots
Authors: Nilesh Pandey, Dipanjan Basu, Leonard F Register, Sanjay K Banerjee
Abstract: We present a three-dimensional simulation study of silicon nanowire double quantum dots with leads, which extends beyond traditional effective-mass or quasi-1D and quasi-2D approaches typically applied to bulk or planar geometries. Using the Sentaurus QTX, we self-consistently couple a 3-D Poisson solver with two-dimensional Schrödinger solutions along the strongly confined width * thickness cross-sections normal to the transport direction, yielding bound-state energies and wavefunctions across the device cross-section. This method captures wavefunction evolution, subband formation, and valley splitting while retaining the full three-dimensional electrostatics of the device. Our results show that narrow quantum dots (width = 5 nm) provide strong confinement, enhanced valley splitting, and robust single-electron localization, whereas wider quantum dots (width = 20 nm) allow single-electron occupation at lower gate voltages but with shallower quantum wells and additional higher-order modes in the wavefunction. Importantly, the quantum dot width also plays a key role in tunnel coupling: smaller channel widths enhance wavefunction overlap across the barrier, resulting in higher tunnel coupling, whereas increasing the width reduces coupling, which eventually saturates once the width is approximately twice the plunger-gate length. By systematically varying the quantum dot width together with plunger- and barrier-gate lengths, we investigate their combined influence on the conduction-band profile and interdot coupling. Together, these simulations provide design guidelines for geometry-driven control of confinement, valley splitting, and tunnel coupling in silicon nanowire double quantum dots.

Title: Simultaneous optimization of assembly time and yield in programmable self-assembly
Authors: Maximilian C. Hübl, Carl P. Goodrich
Abstract: Rational design strategies for self-assembly require a detailed understanding of both the equilibrium state and the assembly kinetics. While the former is starting to be well understood, the latter remains a major theoretical challenge, especially in programmable systems and the so-called semiaddressable regime, where binding is often nondeterministic and the formation of off-target structures negatively influences the assembly. Here, we show that it is possible to simultaneously sculpt the assembly outcome and the assembly kinetics through the underexplored design space of binding energies and particle concentrations. By formulating the assembly process as a complex reaction network, we calculate and optimize the tradeoff between assembly speed and quality, and show that parameter optimization can speed up assembly by many orders of magnitude without lowering the yield of the target structure. Although the exact speedup varies from design to design, we find the largest speedups for nondeterministic systems where unoptimized assembly is the slowest, sometimes even making them assemble faster than optimized fully-addressable designs. Therefore, these results not only solve a key challenge in semiaddressable self-assembly, but further emphasize the utility of semiaddressability, where designs have the potential to be faster as well as cheaper (fewer particle species) and better (higher yield). More broadly, our results highlight the importance of parameter optimization in programmable self-assembly, and provide practical tools for simultaneous optimization of kinetics and yield in a wide range of systems.

Title: On the decoherence of Majorana zero modes mediated by gapless fermions
Authors: Sauri Bhattacharyya, Marco Grilli, Bernard van Heck
Abstract: We study the decoherence of a collection of Majorana zero modes weakly coupled to a gapless reservoir of non-interacting fermions. Using the Born-Markov approximation, we derive a Lindblad master equation for the dissipative dynamics of the Majorana zero modes. Due to the long-range coupling between Majorana zero modes mediated by the gapless reservoir, the Lindblad jump operators are non-local linear combinations of the Majorana operators. We show that, as a consequence, the dissipative dynamics can exhibit long relaxation times, i.e. a slow decay of fermion parities. A spectral analysis of the Liouvillian shows that the slow-down is suppressed as a power law of the distance between Majorana zero modes. Finally, we validate the Lindblad equation by comparison with unbiased numerical simulations of the time evolution of the full density matrix. In particular, these illustrate that non-Markovian dynamics establishes non-local correlations at small times.

Title: Topological Magnon-Plasmon Hybrids
Authors: Tomoki Hirosawa, Pieter M. Gunnink, Alexander Mook
Abstract: We study magnon-plasmon coupling in effectively two-dimensional stacks of van der Waals layers in the context of the band structure topology. Invoking the quasiparticle approximation, we show that the magnetic dipole coupling between the plasmons in a metallic layer and the magnons in a neighboring magnetic layer gives rise to a Berry curvature. As a result, the hybrid quasiparticles acquire an anomalous velocity, leading to intrinsic anomalous thermal Hall and spin-Nernst effects in ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. We propose magnetic layers supporting skyrmion crystals as a platform to realize chiral magnon-plasmon edge states, inviting the notion of topological magnon-plasmonics.

Title: Ergodicity Breaking and High-Dimensional Chaos in Random Recurrent Networks
Authors: Carles Martorell, Rubén Calvo, Adrián Roig, Alessia Annibale, Miguel A. Muñoz
Abstract: The neural model introduced by Sompolinsky, Crisanti, and Sommers (SCS) nearly four decades ago has become a paradigmatic framework for studying complex dynamics in random recurrent networks. In its original formulation, with balanced positive and negative couplings, the model exhibits two phases: a quiescent regime, where all activity ceases, and a regime of ongoing irregular collective activity, termed asynchronous chaos (AC), in which state variables fluctuate strongly in time and across units but average to zero across the network. Building on recent work, we analyze an extension of the SCS model that breaks this coupling balance, yielding a richer phase diagram. In addition to the classical quiescent and AC phases, two additional regimes emerge, marked by spontaneous symmetry breaking. In the persistent-activity (PA) phase, each unit settles into a distinct, stable activation state. In the synchronous-chaotic (SC) phase, dynamics remain irregular and chaotic but fluctuate around a nonzero mean, generating sustained long-time autocorrelations. Using analytical techniques based on dynamical mean-field theory, complemented by extensive numerical simulations, we show how structural disorder gives rise to symmetry and ergodicity breaking. Remarkably, the resulting phase diagram closely parallels that of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin-glass model, with the onset of the SC phase coinciding with the transition associated with replica-symmetry breaking. All key features of spin glasses, including ergodicity breaking, have clear counterparts in this recurrent network context, albeit with crucial idiosyncratic differences, highlighting a unified perspective on complexity in disordered systems.

Title: Modulating thermal conductivity of bulk BAs based on targeted phonon excitation
Authors: Tianhao Li, Yangjun Qin, Dongkai Pan, Han Meng, Nuo Yang
Abstract: This study proposes a reversible phonon excitation strategy to dynamically modulate the thermal conductivity of boron arsenide (BAs), addressing the opposing thermal conductivity requirements in electronics and thermoelectrics. Using first-principles calculations and Boltzmann transport equation, we demonstrate that selective excitation of specific phonon modes enables active control over thermal transport. At an excitation multiplier of 25, the thermal conductivity of BAs can be enhanced by up to 2% or suppressed by up to 35% relative to its intrinsic value of 2235 W m^-1 K^-1. At a lower multiplier of 5, thermal conductivity can be increased by 2% or decreased by 11%. The modulation effect depends on excitation frequency, multiplier, and intrinsic phonon properties, with certain frequencies exhibiting opposite trends under different excitation intensities. Mechanistic analysis shows that at low excitation levels, phonon splitting suppresses Umklapp scattering, reducing the scattering rate, while at high levels, it enhances Normal scattering, increasing the scattering rate. This approach offers a dynamic and reversible route to tuning thermal conductivity, with applications in thermal management and thermoelectric energy conversion.

Title: Phase Transitions Without Instability: A Universal Mechanism from Non-Normal Dynamics
Authors: Virgile Troude, Didier Sornette
Abstract: We identify a new universality class of phase transitions that arises in non-normal systems, challenging the classical view that transitions require eigenvalue instabilities. In traditional bifurcation theory, critical phenomena emerge when spectral stability is lost; here, we show that transitions can occur even when all equilibria are spectrally stable. The key mechanism is the transient amplification induced by non-orthogonal eigenvectors: noise-driven dynamics are enhanced not by lowering energy barriers, but by increasing the effective shear of the flow, which renormalizes fluctuations and acts as an emergent temperature. Once the non-normality index $\kappa$ exceeds a critical threshold $\kappa_c$, stable equilibria lose practical relevance, enabling escapes and abrupt transitions despite preserved spectral stability. This pseudo-criticality generalizes Kramers' escape beyond potential barriers, providing a fundamentally new route to critical phenomena. Its implications are broad: in biology, DNA methylation dynamics reconcile long-term epigenetic memory with rapid stochastic switching; in climate, ecology, finance, and engineered networks, abrupt tipping points can arise from the same mechanism. By demonstrating that phase transitions can emerge from non-normal amplification rather than eigenvalue instabilities, we introduce a predictive, compact framework for sudden transitions in complex systems, establishing non-normality as a defining principle of a new universality class of phase transitions.

Title: Higher-order epitaxy: A pathway to suppressing structural instability and emergent superconductivity

Abstract: Molecular beam epitaxy enables the growth of thin film materials with novel properties and functionalities. Typically, the lattice constants of films and substrates are designed to match to minimise disorders and strains. However, significant lattice mismatches can result in higher-order epitaxy, where commensurate growth occurs with a period defined by integer multiples of the lattice constants. Despite its potential, higher-order epitaxy is rarely used to enhance material properties or induce emergent phenomena. Here, we report single-crystalline FeTe films grown via 6:5 commensurate higher-order epitaxy on CdTe(001) substrates. Scanning transmission electron microscopy reveals self-organised periodic interstitials near the interface, arising from higher-order lattice matching. Synchrotron x-ray diffraction shows that the tetragonal-to-monoclinic structural transition in bulk FeTe is strongly suppressed. Remarkably, these films exhibit substrate-selective two-dimensional superconductivity, likely due to suppressed monoclinic distortion. These findings demonstrate the potential of higher-order epitaxy as a tool to control materials and inducing emergent phenomena.

Title: Compounding formula approach to chromatin and active polymer dynamics
Authors: Takahiro Sakaue, Enrico Carlon
Abstract: Active polymers are ubiquitous in nature, and often kicked by persistent noises that break detailed balance. In order to capture the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of such active polymers, we propose a simple yet reliable analytical framework based on a compounding formula. Connecting polymeric dynamics to the isolated monomeric behavior via the notion of tension propagation, the formula allows us to clarify rich scaling scenarios alongside corresponding intuitive physical pictures. We demonstrate distinctive transient and steady-state scalings due to the non-Markovian nature of the active noise. Aside from a paradigmatic example of an active Rouse polymer, we expect the framework to be applicable to wide variety of spatially extended systems including more general polymers (crumpled globule, semiflexible polymers etc), fluctuation of growing interface, and an array of particles in single-file configuration.

Title: Atomically resolved electron reflectivity at a metal/semiconductor interface
Authors: Ding-Ming Huang, Jian-Huan Wang, Jie-Yin Zhang, Yuan Yao, H. Q. Xu, Jian-Jun Zhang
Abstract: An atomically flat interface is achieved between face-centered cubic Al and diamond lattice Ge via molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Based on the measurements of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), we demonstrate an atomically resolved lateral periodic change of the electron reflectivity at the Al/Ge interface. The variation of electron reflectivity is up to 24% in lateral 2 nm. We speculate that the change of reflectivity results from the local electronic states at the Al/Ge interface. This phenomenon provides an atomically non-destructive method for detecting the buried interfacial states in hetero-structures by STM.

Title: Magnetic-Field Control of Tomonaga-Luttinger Liquids in Ta2Pd3Te5 Edge States
Authors: Xingchen Guo Anqi Wang, Xiutong Deng, Yupeng Li, Guoan Li, Zhiyuan Zhang, Xiaofan Shi, Xiao Deng, Ziwei Dou, Guangtong Liu, Fanming Qu, Zhijun Wang, Tian Qian, Youguo Shi, Li Lu, Jie Shen
Abstract: Ta2Pd3Te5 is a quasi-one-dimensional transition-metal telluride whose heavy atoms endow the material with strong spin-orbit coupling, while the Fermi level inside the bulk gap makes the low-energy electronic structure highly this http URL and early experiments have already identified a wealth of emergent phases in this platform: an excitonic insulator driven by electron-hole binding, a second-order topological insulator protected by crystalline symmetry, a potential topological-protected quantum-spin-Hall edge, and proximity-induced edge supercurrents when coupled to a conventional s-wave superconductor. These properties make it a promising platform for hosting Majorana zero modes and quantum computation, provided that time-reversal symmetry can be broken by a Zeeman gap. In this work, we demonstrate that the one-dimensional edge channels of exfoliated Ta2Pd3Te5 host a robust and tunable Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid by electrostatic gating because it shifts the chemical potential across the bulk gap without changing the gap size. More importantly, the application of a magnetic field introduces a Zeeman gap that systematically increases the TLL power-law exponent alpha. Furthermore, rotating the field reveals a pronounced twofold anisotropy--alpha is maximal for a field parallel to the edge and minimal for a perpendicular orientation--originating from an orientation-dependent edge g-factor that is likely amplified by quantum-confinement-induced orbital-angular-moment quenching. The existence of gate-tunable edge supercurrents together with the field-controlled Zeeman gap provides a direct route to break time-reversal symmetry in a particle-hole-symmetric superconducting gap and thus to engineer a topological superconducting phase, paving the way towards Majorana-based quantum devices.

Title: Magnon-mediated Radiation and Phonon-driven Quenching of Excitons in a Layered Semiconductor
Authors: Yingchen Peng, Yanan Ge, Zihan Wang, Kang Wang, Kezhao Du, Xingzhi Wang, Ye Yang
Abstract: Layered van der Waals (vdW) magnetic semiconductors open a new avenue for exploring intertwined excitonic and magnetic phenomena. Here, we investigate this interplay in the vdW MnPS3 antiferromagnet, uncovering an exceptionally long exciton lifetime (~100 {\mu}s) below the Néel temperature (T_N). We demonstrate that the exciton lifetime is governed by phonon-mediated nonradiative recombination and thus exhibits a strong temperature dependence. On the contrary, the radiative recombination rate shows a distinct temperature dependence, which is dominated by magnon-assisted emission mechanism below T_N and by short-range spin correlations and phonons above T_N. These findings not only establish MnPS3 as a compelling candidate for excitonic devices due to its long-lifetime and correlation with magnetic orders but also provide crucial insights into the interplay between excitons, spins, and lattice in vdW magnetic semiconductors.

Title: Gate Voltage Tunable Second Harmonic Generation in Mono- and Bi-layer Black Phosphene
Authors: Yan Meng, Kainan Chang, Yanyan Qian, Luxia Wang, Jin Luo Cheng
Abstract: Black phosphorene (BP) has emerged as a promising platform for tunable nonlinear photonics due to its layer-dependent bandgap, high carrier mobility, and remarkable in-plane anisotropy. This study investigates the second-harmonic generation (SHG) of monolayer and bilayer BP under an external static electric field, with describing the electronic states by a tight-binding model and the dynamics by semiconductor Bloch equations. Our results reveal that BP exhibits large second-order nonlinear optical response along the armchair direction, with significant resonant enhancement when the incident photon energy approaches half of its bandgap. Under an applied electric field of $10^7$ V/m, the effective second-order nonlinear susceptibility of BP can be as large as $10^3$ pm/V, surpassing that of the conventional nonlinear crystal AgGaSe$_2$ by more than an order of magnitude. With respect to the static electric field induced by gate voltage, we discuss the relation between the electric-field-induced second harmonic (EFISH) generation and conventional SHG -- under lower gate voltage, the EFISH approach agrees well with the SHG solutions, whereas the former is no longer applicable under higher gate voltage. Specifically, as the increasing gate voltage, monolayer BP exhibits the bandgap expansion and the corresponding blue-shift in the SHG resonant peak. In contrast, bilayer BP undergoes a semiconductor-to-semimetal transition, forming Dirac cone and generating divergent SHG spectra as photon energy goes to zero. Additionally, the chemical potential allows for precise control over interband and intraband nonlinear responses. This work provides important theoretical foundations for the development of BP-based tunable nonlinear photonic devices and expands the application potential of anisotropic two-dimensional materials in nonlinear optics.

Title: Twist-tuned exchange and hysteresis in a bilayer van der Waals magnet
Authors: Priyanka Mondal, Sonu Verma, Wenze Lan, Lukas Krelle, Ryan Tan, Regine von Klitzing, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Kseniia Mosina, Zdenek Sofer, Akashdeep Kamra, Bernhard Urbaszek
Abstract: Moiré superlattices in twisted bilayers enable profound reconstructions of the electronic bandstructure, giving rise to correlated states with remarkable tunability. Extending this paradigm to van der Waals magnets, twisting creates spatially varying interlayer exchange interactions that stabilize emergent spin textures and the coexistence of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic domains. Here, we demonstrate the emergence of robust magnetic hysteresis in bilayer CrSBr upon twisting by an angle of ~ 3°. This is observed as the corresponding hysteretic evolution of the exciton energy, that directly correlates with the bilayer magnetic state, in magnetic field dependent photoluminescence measurements. A two-sublattice model captures this behavior, attributing it to the twist-induced reduction of interlayer exchange that stabilizes both parallel and antiparallel spin configurations across a broad field range. Comparison with experiment enables quantitative extraction of the effective exchange strength. Remarkably, the system exhibits coherent averaging across the moiré supercell, yielding an effective monodomain response characterized by switching into the antiferromagnetic state, rather than forming spin textures or fragmented domains. Spatially resolved measurements further uncover local variations in hysteresis loops, consistent with position-dependent modulation of the average exchange interaction. Our results establish twist engineering as a powerful route to programmable magnetic memories in two-dimensional magnets, harnessing the robustness of antiferromagnetic order.

Title: Exact solution for the current generated by dissipative master equation in single-band tight-binding systems subject to time-dependent uniform electric fields
Authors: J. M. Alendouro Pinho, B. Amorim, J. M. Viana Parente Lopes
Abstract: The theory of open quantum systems is one of the most essential tools for the development of quantum technologies. A particular area of interest is in the optical response of solid state systems, where dissipation is introduced phenomenologically through the relaxation time approximation and its effects are usually gauged perturbatively. Analytical exact results for driven systems under this approximation are scarce and tipically pertain only to the stationary regime. Here, we obtain the analytical solution for the current response of general single-band tight-binding system driven by a uniform electric field with generic time-dependence under the relaxation time approximation. We explore the effects of dissipation in two limiting cases: A monochromatic field, where we analytically deduce the effect of dissipation on High Harmonic Generation, and a constant electric field, where a generalization for the Esaki-Tsu equation is presented for any single-band tight-binding system. We specify the results for a simple 2D nearest neighbours tight-binding lattice to emphasize the effect of the scale competition introduced by the two different neighbours in both the monochromatic and constant field cases. Finally, we compare our exact result for the constant field to the one obtained from the usual perturbation theory calculation to probe the validity of the latter.

Title: Finite element models for Self-Deployable Miura-folded origami
Authors: Suraj Singh Gehlot, Siddhanth Gautam, Sanhita Das
Abstract: Origami-inspired self-deployable structures offer lightweight, compact, and autonomous deployment capabilities, making them highly attractive for aerospace and defence applications, such as solar panels, antennas, and reflector systems. This paper presents finite element frameworks for simulating Miura-origami units in ABAQUS, focusing on two deployment mechanisms: elastic strain energy release and thermally activated shape-memory polymers (SMPs). Validation against experimental data for elastic deployment demonstrates that the model accurately captures fold trajectories and overall kinematics. Parametric studies reveal the influence of hinge stiffness and damping on deployment efficiency. SMP-based simulations qualitatively reproduce stress-strain-temperature behaviour and realistic shape recovery ratios. The study establishes that predictive numerical models can effectively guide the design of origami-based deployable structures for aerospace and defence applications, while highlighting the challenges associated with hinge modelling, damping effects, and thermomechanical actuation.

Abstract: Single-photon detectors are an essential part of the toolbox of modern quantum optics for implementing quantum technologies and enabling tests of fundamental physics. The low energy of microwave photons, the natural signal path for superconducting quantum devices, makes their detection much harder than for visible light. Despite impressive progress in recent years and the proposal and realization of a number of different detector architectures, the reliable detection of a single itinerant microwave photon remains an open topic. Here, we investigate and simulate a detailed protocol for single-photon multiplication and subsequent amplification and detection. At its heart lies a Josephson-photonics device which uses inelastic Cooper-pair tunneling driven by a dc bias in combination with the energy of an incoming photon to create multiple photons, thus compensating for the low-energy problem. Our analysis provides clear design guidelines for utilizing such devices, which have previously been operated in an amplifier mode with a continuous wave input, for counting photons. Combining a formalism recently developed by Mølmer to describe the full quantum state of in- and outgoing photon pulses with stochastic Schrödinger equations, we can describe the full multiplication and detection protocol and calculate performance parameters, such as detection probabilities and dark count rates. With optimized parameters, a high population of a single output mode can be achieved that can then be easily distinguished from vacuum noise in heterodyne measurements of quadratures with a conventional linear amplifier. Realistic devices with two multiplication stages with multiplication of $16$ reach for an impinging Gaussian pulse of length $T$ a detection probability of $84.5\%$ with a dark count rate of $10^{-3}/T$, and promise to outperform competing schemes.

Title: Far-field radiation of bulk, edge and corner eigenmodes from a finite 2D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger plasmonic lattice
Authors: Álvaro Buendía, José Luis Pura, Vincenzo Giannini, José Antonio Sánchez Gil
Abstract: Subwavelength arrays of plasmonic nanoparticles allow us to control the behaviour of light at the nanoscale. Here, we develop an eigenmode analysis, employing a coupled electromagnetic dipole formalism, which permits us to isolate the contribution to the far-field radiation of each array mode. Specifically, we calculate the far-field radiation patterns by bulk, edge and corner out-of-plane eigenmodes in a finite 2D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) array of plasmonic nanoparticles with out-of-plane dipolar resonances. The breaking of symmetries in multipartite unit cells is exploited to tailor the optical properties and far-field radiation of the resonant modes. We prove that the antisymmetric modes are darker and have higher Q-factors than their symmetric counterparts. Also, the out-of-plane nature of the dipolar resonances imposes that all bulk $\Gamma$-modes are dark, while corner and edge states need extra in-plane symmetries to cancel the far-field radiation; radiation patterns in turn become more complex and concentrated along the array plane with increasing array size.

Title: Surface-Localized Magnetic Order in RuO2 Thin Films Revealed by Low-Energy Muon Probes

Abstract: Ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) has recently emerged as a candidate altermagnet, yet its intrinsic magnetic ground state, particularly in thin films, remains debated. This study aims to clarify the nature and spatial extent of the magnetic order in RuO2 thin films grown under different conditions. Thin films of RuO2 with thicknesses of 30 nm and 33 nm are fabricated by pulsed laser deposition and sputtering onto TiO2(110) and Al2O3(1-102) substrates, respectively. Low-energy muon spin rotation/relaxation (LE-muSR) with depth-resolved sensitivity measurements is performed in transverse magnetic fields (TF) from 4 K to 290 K. The muSR data collected with a muon implantation energy of 1 keV reveal that magnetic signals originate from the near-surface region of the film (<10 nm), and the affected volume fraction is at most about 8.5%. The localized magnetic response is consistent across different substrates, growth techniques, and parameter sets, suggesting a common origin related to surface defects and dimensionality effects. The combined use of TF-muSR and the study of depth-dependent implantation with low-energy muons provides direct evidence for surface-confined, inhomogeneous static magnetic order in RuO2 thin films, helping reconcile discrepancies. These findings underscore the importance of considering reduced-dimensional contributions and motivate further investigation into the role of defects, strain, and stoichiometry on the magnetic properties of RuO2, especially at the surface.

Title: Faraday patterns, spin textures, spin-spin correlations and competing instabilities in a driven spin-1 antiferromagnetic Bose-Einstein condensate
Authors: Vaishakh Kargudri, Sandra M. Jose, Rejish Nath
Abstract: We study the formation of transient Faraday patterns and spin textures in driven quasi-one-dimensional and quasi-two-dimensional spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates under the periodic modulation of $s$-wave scattering lengths $a_0$ and $a_2$, starting from the anti-ferromagnetic phase. This phase is characterized by a Bogoliubov spectrum consisting of three modes: one mode is gapped, while the other two are gapless. When $a_0$ is modulated and half of the modulation frequency lies below the gapped mode, density and spin Faraday patterns emerge. In that case, in quasi-one-dimension, the spin texture is characterized by periodic domains of opposite $z$-polarizations. When driven above the gap, the spin texture is characterized by random orientations of spin vectors along the condensate axis. Qualitatively new features appear in the driven quasi-two-dimensional condensate. For instance, when driven above the gap, the spin textures are characterized by anomalous vortices and antivortices that do not exhibit phase winding in individual magnetic components. Below the gap, the spin texture exhibits irregular ferromagnetic patches with opposite polarizations. The spatial spin-spin correlations in quasi-one-dimension exhibit a Gaussian envelope, whereas they possess a Bessel function dependence in quasi-two-dimension. Under the $a_2$-modulation, the density patterns dominate irrespective of the driving frequency, unless the spin-dependent interaction strength is sufficiently smaller than that of the spin-independent interaction. The intriguing scenario of competing instability can emerge when both scattering lengths are simultaneously modulated. Finally, we show that the competing instabilities result in a complex relationship between the population transfer and the strength of the quadratic Zeeman field, while keeping all other parameters constant.

Title: Unveiling Intrinsic Triplet Superconductivity in Noncentrosymmetric NbRe through Inverse Spin-Valve Effects
Authors: F. Colangelo, M. Modestino, F. Avitabile, A. Galluzzi, Z. Makhdoumi Kakhaki, A. Kumar, J. Linder, M. Polichetti, C. Attanasio, C. Cirillo
Abstract: NbRe is a non-centrosymmetric superconductor that has been proposed as a candidate for intrinsic spin-triplet pairing. However, a conclusive demonstration of triplet pairing in NbRe is yet to be found. To probe the presence of equal-spin triplet Cooper pairs, we fabricated Py/NbRe/Py trilayers capped with an antiferromagnetic layer. Magnetic and electrical measurements reveal an inverse spin-valve effect, which could indicate equal-spin triplet superconductivity. The minimal sample structure and the lack of ad hoc engineered interfaces clearly associate our observation to intrinsic triplet correlations of NbRe. The availability of NbRe in thin-film form and the simplicity of the heterostructure highlight its potential as a scalable platform for superconducting spintronics.

Title: Rare-Earth Engineering of NaAlO3 Perovskites Unlocks Unified Optoelectronic, Thermoelectric, and Spintronic Functionalities
Authors: Muhammad Imran, Sikander Azam, Qaiser Rafiq, Amin Ur Rahman
Abstract: Perovskite oxides are promising for energy and quantum technologies, but wide-gap hosts such as NaAlO3 suffer from deep-UV absorption and limited carrier transport. Using first-principles GGA+U+SOC calculations, we investigate Eu3+-, Gd3+-, and Tb3+-doped NaAlO3 and evaluate their electronic, optical, elastic, and thermoelectric properties. Rare-earth substitution is thermodynamically favorable (formation energies 1.2-1.6 eV) and induces strong f-p hybridization, reducing the pristine band gap (about 6.2 eV) to about 3.1 eV for Tb. Spin-resolved band structures reveal Gd-driven half-metallicity, Eu-induced spin-selective metallicity, and Tb-stabilized p-type semiconducting behavior. The optical spectra show a red-shifted absorption edge (about 2.0-2.2 eV), a large static dielectric response (epsilon1(0) about 95 for Eu), and plasmonic resonances near 4 eV, enabling visible-light harvesting. Elastic analysis indicates mild lattice softening with preserved ductility (Pugh ratio B/G about 1.56-1.57). Thermoelectric performance is enhanced, with Seebeck coefficients greater than 210 uV/K for Eu and Tb and ZT about 0.45 at 500 K. These results identify rare-earth-doped NaAlO3 as a multifunctional perovskite platform for photovoltaics, photocatalysis, thermoelectrics, and spintronics.

Title: Odd-frequency Pairing in Josephson Junctions Coupled by Magnetic Textures
Authors: Ignacio Sardinero, Jorge Cayao, Rubén Seoane Souto, Pablo Burset
Abstract: Josephson junctions coupled through magnetic textures provide a controllable platform for odd-frequency superconductivity and Majorana physics. Within a tight-binding Green function framework, induced pair correlations and spectral properties are analyzed under various magnetic and geometric conditions. When the junction is in the topologically trivial regime, even-frequency singlet pairing is dominant, whereas the topological phase is characterized by the coexistence of Majorana bound states and robust odd-frequency equal-spin triplet pairing at the interface edges. The odd-frequency polarized triplets reveal a divergent $1/\omega$ behavior when the Majorana states are decoupled, which is intrinsically connected to their self-conjugation property. The zero-frequency divergence evolves into shifted resonances and linear low-frequency behavior once hybridization occurs. A nonmagnetic interruption in the texture separates the topological superconductor into two topological segments and generates additional inner Majorana modes. When the nonmagnetic barrier is comparable to the inner Majorana states localization length, they hybridize and modify their associated odd-frequency triplet pairing, while the outer edge modes preserve their self-conjugated nature. Tuning the superconducting phase difference further controls the onset of the topological regime and the stability of localized Majorana states. The results highlight the central role of odd-frequency triplet correlations as a probe of topological superconductivity in magnetically engineered Josephson junctions.

Title: Multimodal Topological Textures Arising from Coupled Structural Orders in SrTiO$_3$
Authors: Fernando Gómez-Ortiz, Louis Bastogne, Philippe Ghosez
Abstract: Magnetic spin topological textures recently found their electrical counterparts in polar topologies emerging from the condensation of inhomogeneous polar atomic distortions. Here, we further extend the concept to other non-polar atomic degrees of freedom. Taking SrTiO$_3$ as a prototypical example, we investigate from second-principles atomistic simulations, the equilibrium domain structures and topological textures associated with the natural antiferrodistortive rotations of its oxygen octahedra. % Besides the common 90$^\circ$ antiferrodistortive domain walls (twin boundaries), we identify new metastable 180$^\circ$ domain walls oriented along the $\lbrace100\rbrace_\mathrm{pc}$ direction, when compressive epitaxial strain is applied. These domains exhibit complex antiferrodistortive Bloch- and Néel-like configurations with the later being the most favorable. We also stabilize antiferrodistortive vortex and antivortex structures which are accompanied by co-localized polarization vortices and a complex pattern of the local strain field, giving rise to a trimodal topological structures. Our results extends the concept of topological ordering to non-polar structural degrees of freedom and highlights the role of lattice-mediated couplings in stabilizing complex textures in perovskite oxides.

Title: Electronic structures and superconductivity in Nd-doped La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$
Authors: Cui-Qun Chen, Wenyuan Qiu, Zhihui Luo, Meng Wang, Dao-Xin Yao
Abstract: The recent discovery of high-$T_c$ superconductivity in Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates has motivated extensive efforts to explore higher $T_c$ superconductors. Here, we systematically investigate Nd-doped La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using density functional theory (DFT) and renormalized mean-field theory (RMFT). DFT calculations reveal that both the lattice constants and interlayer spacing decrease upon Nd substitution, similar to the effect of physical pressure. However, the in-plane Ni-O-Ni bond angle evolves non-monotonically with doping, increasing to a maximum at 70% (~2/3) Nd doping level and then falling sharply at 80%, which leads to a reduction in orbital overlap. Moreover, Nd doping has a more pronounced effect on the Ni-$d{_{z^2}}$ orbital, demonstrating an orbital-dependent effect of rare-earth substitution. Through the bilayer two-orbital t-J model, RMFT analysis further shows an $s\pm$-wave pairing symmetry, with $T_c$ rising to a maximum at about 70% Nd substitution before declining, in agreement with the transport measurements. The variation in $T_c$ can be traced to the competition between continuously enhanced interlayer superexchange coupling $J_\perp^z$ and a gradual decrease in particle density. These results highlight the delicate interplay among structural tuning, orbital hybridization, and superconductivity, providing important clues to design higher-$T_c$ RP nickelate superconductors.

Title: Mechanical coupling of polar topologies and oxygen octahedra rotations in PbTiO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ superlattices
Authors: Fernando Gómez-Ortiz, Louis Bastogne, Xu He, Philippe Ghosez
Abstract: PbTiO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ artificial superlattices recently emerged as a prototypical platform for the emergence and study of polar topologies. While previous studies mainly focused on the polar textures inherent to the ferroelectric PbTiO$_3$ layers, the oxygen octahedra rotations inherent to the paraelectric SrTiO$_3$ layers have attracted much little attention. Here, we highlight a biunivocal relationship between distinct polar topologies -- including $a_1/a_2$ domains, polar vortices, and skyrmions -- within the PbTiO$_3$ layers and specific patterns of oxygen octahedra rotations in the SrTiO$_3$ layers. This relationship arises from a strain-mediated coupling between the two materials and is shown to be reciprocal. Through second-principles atomistic simulations, we demonstrate that each polar texture imposes a corresponding rotation pattern, while conversely, a frozen oxygen octahedra rotation dictates the emergence of the associated polar state. This confirms the strong coupling between oxygen octahedra rotations in SrTiO$_3$ and polarization in PbTiO$_3$, highlighting their cooperative role in stabilizing complex polar textures in related superlattices.

Title: Dominant scattering mechanisms and mobility peak in cryogenic 2D electron transport in Silicon (110) confinement by high-k oxides
Authors: Hsin-Wen Huang, Xi-Jun Fang, Edward Chen, Yuh-Renn Wu
Abstract: The performance of silicon nano-devices at cryogenic temperatures is critical for quantum computing technologies. Through multi-valley Monte Carlo simulations of Si (110) systems, we reveal a fundamental shift in electron transport physics at low temperatures. Phonon scattering becomes negligible, and mobility is instead dictated by a competition between remote Coulomb scattering (RCS) at low carrier densities and surface roughness scattering (SRS) at high densities. This competition creates a distinct peak in electron mobility. Furthermore, we demonstrate a critical design trade-off for high-$\kappa$ dielectrics like $\mathrm{HfO_2}$: while enhancing gate control, they introduce strong remote phonon scattering, which can suppress mobility. These findings provide essential guidelines for the material selection and design of next-generation cryogenic nano-devices.

Title: Observation of electromagnons in a monolayer multiferroic
Authors: Mohammad Amini, Tiago V. C. Antão, Liwei Jing, Ziying Wang, Antti Karjasilta, Robert Drost, Shawulienu Kezilebieke, Jose L. Lado, Adolfo O. Fumega, Peter Liljeroth
Abstract: Van der Waals multiferroics have emerged as a promising platform to explore novel magnetoelectric phenomena. Recently, it has been shown that monolayer NiI$_2$ hosts robust type-II multiferroicity down to the two-dimensional limit, a giant dynamical magnetoelectric coupling at terahertz frequencies, and an electrically switchable spin polarization. These developments present the possibility of engineering ultrafast, low-energy-consumption, and electrically-tunable spintronic devices based on the collective excitations of the multiferroic order, electromagnons. However, the direct visualization of these bosonic modes in real space and within the monolayer limit remains elusive. Here, we report the atomic-scale observation of electromagnons in monolayer NiI$_2$ using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy. By tracking the thermal evolution of the multiferroic phase, we establish the energy scale and resolve coherent in-gap excitations of the symmetry-broken multiferroic state. Comparison with first-principles and spin-model calculations reveals that the low-energy modes originate from electromagnon excitations. Spatially resolved inelastic tunneling spectroscopy maps show a stripe-like modulation of the local spectral function at electromagnon energies, matching theoretical predictions. These results provide direct evidence of the internal structure of electromagnons and establish a methodology to probe these modes at the atomic scale, opening avenues for electrically tunable spintronics.

Title: Non-Hermitian many-body localization in asymmetric chains with long-range interaction
Authors: Wen Wang, Han-Ze Li, Jian-Xin Zhong
Abstract: Understanding the relationship between many-body localization and spectra in non-Hermitian many-body systems is crucial. In a one-dimensional clean, long-range interaction-induced non-Hermitian many-body localization system, we have discovered the coexistence of static and dynamic spectral real-complex phase transitions, along with many-body ergodic-localized phase transitions. The phase diagrams of these two types of transitions show similar non-monotonic boundary trends but do not overlap, highlighting properties distinct from conventional disorder-induced non-Hermitian many-body localization. We also propose a potential experimental realization of this model in cold-atom systems. Our findings provide valuable insights for further understanding the relationship between non-Hermitian many-body localization and non-Hermitian spectra in long-range interacting systems.

Title: Flow Coupling Alters Topological Phase Transition in Nematic Liquid Crystals
Authors: Jayeeta Chattopadhyay, Simon Guldager Andersen, Kristian Thijssen, Amin Doostmohammadi
Abstract: We investigate how coupling to fluid flow influences defect-mediated transitions in two-dimensional passive nematic fluids using fluctuating nematohydrodynamic simulations. The system is driven by tuning the fluctuation strength, with increasing (decreasing) fluctuations defining the forward (backward) protocol. In the absence of flow coupling, the transition follows the Berezinskii--Kosterlitz--Thouless (BKT) scenario, governed by reversible binding and unbinding of $\pm 1/2$ defect pairs. When hydrodynamics is included, the outcome is controlled by the flow--alignment parameter. For non-aligning nematics ($\lambda=0$), the transition remains consistent with BKT. By contrast, for strain-rate--aligning nematics ($\lambda\neq 0$), bend--splay walls emerge, lowering the defect nucleation threshold and preventing sustained recombination: once created, defects remain unbound across the full range of fluctuation strengths in both forward and backward protocols. These results identify flow alignment as a fundamental control parameter for topological phase behavior and suggest that the canonical BKT transition emerges only in the absence of flow alignment.

Title: Modified Monte Carlo method with the heat bath algorithm for a model cuprate
Authors: Yu. D. Panov, V. A. Ulitko, D. N. Yasinskaya, A. S. Moskvin
Abstract: The results of numerical simulation using a modified Monte Carlo method with a heat bath algorithm for the pseudospin model of cuprates are presented. The temperature phase diagrams are constructed for various degrees of doping and for various parameters of the model, and the effect of local correlations on the critical temperatures of the model cuprate is investigated. It is shown that, in qualitative agreement with the results of the mean field, the heat bath algorithm leads to a significant decrease in the estimate of critical temperatures due to more complete accounting of fluctuations, and also makes it possible to detect phase inhomogeneous states. The possibility of using machine learning to accelerate the heat bath algorithm is discussed.

Title: The Phase Diagram for Percolating Free Surfaces in Disordered Assemblies of Faceted Grains
Authors: D. J. Priour Jr
Abstract: Percolation in systems made up of randomly placed impermeable grains is often examined in the context of system spanning clusters of connected solids forming above a relatively low critical grain density $\rho_{c1}$ or networks of interstitial void volumes ceasing to exist above a signficantly higher threshold $\rho_{c2}$. In this work, we interpret these percolation transitions as, respectively, the low and high density boundaries of percolating exposed surfaces which either ensheath clusters of impermeable particles or line tunnel-like voids. Moreover, we find in the thermodynamic limit exposed surfaces are either sheaths or tunnels with a second order phase transition from the former to the latter at a density threshold $\rho_{c*}$ intermediate between $\rho_{c1}$ and $\rho_{c2}$. We calculate critical inclusion densities with a new method which identifies exposed free surfaces in a geometrically exact manner with a computational cost scaling only linearly in the system volume. We obtain $\rho_{c1}$, $\rho_{c2}$, and $\rho_{c*}$ for a variety of grain geometries, including each of the Platonic solids, truncated icosahedra, and structurally disordered inclusions formed from cubes subject to a random sequence of slicing planes. In the case of the latter, we find a limiting value of $5\%$ for the critical porosity at the void percolation threshold as the number of sustained slices per cube becomes large.

Title: A nonequilibrium distribution for stochastic thermodynamics
Authors: Jean-Luc Garden
Abstract: The canonical distribution of Gibbs is extended to the case of systems outside equilibrium. The distribution of probabilities of a discrete energy levels system is used to provide a microscopic definition of work, along with a microscopic definition of the uncompensated heat of Clausius involved in nonequilibrium processes. The later is related to the presence of non-conservatives forces with regards to the variation of the external parameters. This new framework is used to investigate the nonequilibrium relations in stochastic thermodynamics. A new relation is derived for the random quantity of heat associated to the nonequilibrium work protocol. We finally show that the distributions of probabilities of work, heat and uncompensated heat are non-independent each other during a nonequilibrium process.

Title: Dynamics of individual active elastic filaments with chiral self-propulsion
Authors: Chanania Steinbock, Daniel A. Beller
Abstract: We study the over-damped dynamics of individual one-dimensional elastic filaments subjected to a chiral active force which propels each point of the filament at a fixed angle relative to the tangent vector of the filament at that point. Such a model is a reasonable starting point for describing the behavior of polymers such as microtubules in gliding assay experiments. We derive sixth-order nonlinear coupled partial differential equations for the intrinsic properties of the filament, namely, its curvature and metric, and show that these equations are capable of supporting multiple different stationary solutions in a co-moving frame, i.e. that chiral active elastic filaments exhibit dynamic multi-stability in their shapes. A linear stability analysis of these solutions is carried out to determine which solutions are stable and a brief analysis of the time-dependent approach to stationary shape is considered. Finally, simulations are presented which confirm many of our predictions while also revealing additional complexity.

Title: Topological surface magnon-polariton in an insulating canted antiferromagnet
Authors: Weixin Li, Rundong Yuan, Fenglin Zhong, Bo Peng, Jean-Philippe Ansermet, Haiming Yu
Abstract: Excitation and control of antiferromagnetic magnon modes lie at the heart of coherent antiferromagnetic spintronics. Here, we propose a topological surface magnon-polariton as the potential means to excite antiferromagnetic magnons in the prototypical magnonic material hematite. We show that in an insulating canted antiferromagnet, where the magnons can strongly couple to photons using electrical on-chip layouts, a surface magnon-polariton mode exists in the gap of the bulk magnon-photon bands. The emergence of surface magnon-polariton mode is further attributed to the nontrivial topology of bulk magnon-photon bands. Magnon-photon coupling enhances the Berry curvature near the anticrossing points, leading to a topological bulk Chern band associated with the surface magnon-polaritons. Our work provides a general principle for the utilisation of optomagnetic properties in antiferromagnets, with an illustration of its feasibility in the particular case of hematite.

Title: Impact of protein corona morphology on nanoparticle diffusion in biological fluids: insights from a mesoscale approach
Authors: Beatrice Cipriani, Hender Lopez
Abstract: Nanoparticles (NPs) demonstrate considerable potential in medical applications, including targeted drug delivery and diagnostic probes. However, their efficacy depends on their ability to navigate through the complex biological environments inside living organisms. In such environments, NPs interact with a dense mixture of biomolecules, which can reduce their mobility and hinder diffusion. Understanding the factors influencing NP diffusion in these environments is key to improving nanomedicine design and predicting toxicological effects. In this study, we propose a computational approach to model NP diffusion in crowded environments. We introduce a mesoscale model that accounts for the combined effects of the Protein Corona (PC) and the crowded medium on NP movement. By including volume-exclusion interactions and modelling the PC both explicitly and implicitly, we identify key macromolecular descriptors that affect NP diffusion. Our results show that the morphology of the PC can significantly affect the diffusion of NPs, and the role of the occupied volume fraction and the size ratio between tracers and crowders are analysed. The results also show that approximating large macromolecular assemblies with a hydrodynamic single-sphere model leads to inexact diffusion estimates. To overcome the limitations of single-sphere representations, a strategy for an accurate parametrization of NP-PC systems using a single-sphere model is presented.

Title: Ultraviolet optical conductivity, exciton fine-structure and dispersion of freestanding monolayer h-BN
Authors: Jinhua Hong, Alberto Guandalini, Weibin Wu, Haiming Sun, Fuwei Wu, Shulin Chen, Chao Ma, Kazu Suenaga, Thomas Pichler, Francesco Mauri
Abstract: Excitons govern the light-matter interaction in 2D gapped materials with intrinsically large binding energies. In spite of plentiful optical measurements in the visible for semiconducting transition-metal dichalcogenides, we still lack optical-absorption studies of the exciton structure of insulating 2D materials that requires UV light. Moreover, measurements of the momentum dispersion of excitons in the vicinity of optical limit are rare owing to low resolutions but hold the key to reveal quasiparticle interactions. To close this gap, we employ high momentum resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy ($q$-EELS) to explore exciton dispersions of mono- and few-layer hexagonal boron nitride. Surprisingly, we reveal a fine structure of the first bright exciton dispersion band composed by two features (A and A$'$), visible only at small momentum, not predicted by Bethe-Salpeter calculations. Introducing an optical conductivity approximation (OCA), we extract from the experimental $q$-EELS spectra the ultraviolet (UV) optical conductivity at zero momentum, $\sigma(\omega)$, and discuss the exciton fine structure in $\sigma(\omega)$, consistent with previous photoluminescence observations. Our findings establish a general methodology to probe the fine structure of exciton dispersions, providing new insights into exciton-phonon sidebands and eventually polarons in low-dimensional materials.

Title: Enhanced thermal stability of inverted perovskite solar cells by bulky passivation with pyridine-functionalized triphenylamine

Abstract: Despite competitive efficiency compared to Si solar cells and relevant stability at near room temperatures the rapid degradation at elevated temperatures remains the critical obstacle for exploitation of perovskite photovoltaics. In this work, a 4-(pyridin-4-yl)triphenylamine (TPA-Py) with pyridine anchor group was employed for inter-grain bulk modification of double-cation CsCH(NH2)2PbI3 perovskite absorbers to enhance thermal stability. Through coordination and dipole-dipole interactions, nitrogen-containing fragments (diphenylamine and pyridine) of TPA-Py passivate uncoordinated cations and improve the phase resilience of perovskite films against segregation. This resulted in a power conversion efficiency of 21.3% with a high open-circuit voltage of 1.14 V. Notable impact of self-assembled monolayer incorporated into the bulk of perovskite film manifested in huge improvement of thermal stability at 85°C (ISOS-D-2). TPA-Py modification improved extended the T80 lifetime to ~600 h compared to only 200 h for the reference under harsh heating stress in ambient conditions. In-depth analysis using photoinduced voltage transients and admittance spectroscopy after different stress periods revealed the screening of ion migration (0.45 eV) for devices with TPA-Py. This work offers an important understanding of the bulk modification of microcrystalline perovskite absorbers and guide for robust design of bulk and buried interfaces in highly efficient perovskite solar cells.

Title: Microstructure and phase stability within the AlMoNbTiZr system: design tools and compositional boundaries for a high-entropy alloy
Authors: Mariano Casas-Luna, Dalibor Preisler, Jiří Kozlík, Josef Stráský
Abstract: This study explores Ti-containing complex concentrated alloys (CCAs) within the AlMoNbTiZr system, focusing on compositions located in regions of the Bo-Md diagram characterized by low bond order (Bo) and d-orbital energy level (Md). Four alloys were designed near the line predicting stress-induced martensite formation in conventional Ti alloys, then cast, annealed at 1200°C, and water quenched. Their microstructures and phases were analyzed and compared against phase prediction tools commonly applied to high-entropy alloys (HEAs), namely empirical parameters and CALPHAD simulations. Results highlight the strong influence of chemical affinity, particularly the roles of Al, Mo, and Zr concentrations, on solid-solution stability. A maximum Al content of 10 at% was identified as the threshold for achieving a single-phase microstructure, observed in the 10Al15Mo10Nb35Ti30Zr alloy. This alloy exhibited a bcc/b2 structure with high compressive strength (above 1300 MPa), low Young's modulus (28 GPa), and limited strain (<6%), but lacked the transformation-induced strengthening mechanisms expected for Ti alloys with comparable Bo-Md values.

Title: Trajectory-Dependent Electronic Energy Losses in Ion Range Simulations
Authors: Glen P. Kiely, Bruno Semião, Evgeniia Ponomareva, Rafael Nuñez-Palacio, Unna Arpiainen, Andrea E. Sand
Abstract: The energy losses of energetic ions in materials depend on both nuclear and electronic interactions. In channeling geometries, the stopping effect of these interactions can be highly reduced, resulting in deeper ion penetration. Comprehensive, trajectory-dependent models for ion-material interactions are therefore crucial for the accurate prediction of ion range profiles. We present the implementation of a recent electron density-dependent energy-loss model in the efficient molecular dynamics-based MDRANGE code. The model captures \textit{ab initio} electron dynamics using a parametrized ion energy loss function, based on calculations for explicit trajectories using real-time time-dependent density functional theory. We demonstrate the efficient simulation of trajectory-dependent ion range profiles with this comprehensive model for electronic energy losses. Our results indicate that accurate trajectory-dependent ion range profiles can be simulated using well-fitted parametrizations of this model. This method offers a unique tool for validation of the fitted energy-loss functions using energetic ion ranges, which can be measured experimentally but are beyond the capability of full MD simulations due to the computational expense.

Title: Anomalous Diffusion in Driven Electrolytes due to Hydrodynamic Fluctuations
Authors: Ramin Golestanian
Abstract: The stochastic dynamics of tracers arising from hydrodynamic fluctuations in a driven electrolyte is studied using a self-consistent field theory framework in all dimensions. A plethora of scaling behaviour including two distinct regimes of anomalous diffusion is found, and the crossovers between them are characterized in terms of the different tuning parameters. A short-time ballistic regime is found to be accessible beyond two dimensions, whereas a long-time diffusive regime is found to be present only at four dimensions and above. The results showcase how long-ranged hydrodynamic interactions can dominate the dynamics of non-equilibrium steady-states in ionic suspensions and produce strong fluctuations despite the presence of Debye screening.

Title: Fractional quantum Hall states under density decoherence
Authors: Zijian Wang, Ruihua Fan, Tianle Wang, Samuel J. Garratt, Ehud Altman
Abstract: Fractional quantum Hall states are promising platforms for topological quantum computation due to their capacity to encode quantum information in topologically degenerate ground states and in the fusion space of non-abelian anyons. We investigate how the information encoded in two paradigmatic states, the Laughlin and Moore-Read states, is affected by density decoherence -- coupling of local charge density to non-thermal noise. We identify a critical filling factor $\nu_c$, above which the quantum information remains fully recoverable for arbitrarily strong decoherence. The $\nu=1/3$ Laughlin state and $\nu = 1/2$ Moore-Read state both lie within this range. Below $\nu_c$ both classes of states undergo a decoherence induced Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thousless (BKT) transition into a critical decohered phase. For Laughlin states, information encoded in the topological ground state manifold degrades continuously with decoherence strength inside this critical phase, vanishing only in the limit of infinite decoherence strength. On the other hand, quantum information encoded in the fusion space of non-abelian anyons of the Moore-Read states remains fully recoverable for arbitrary strong decoherence even beyond the BKT transition. These results lend further support to the promise of non-Abelian FQH states as platforms for topological quantum computation and raises the question of how errors in such states can be corrected.

Title: Kinetic description of one-dimensional stochastic dynamics with small inertia
Authors: Denis S. Goldobin, Lyudmila S. Klimenko, Irina V. Tyulkina, Vasily A. Kostin, Lev A. Smirnov
Abstract: We study single-variable approaches for describing stochastic dynamics with small inertia. The basic models we deal with describe passive Brownian particles and phase elements (phase oscillators, rotators, superconducting Josephson junctions) with an effective inertia in the case of a linear dissipation term and active Brownian particles in the case of a nonlinear dissipation. Elimination of a fast variable (velocity) reduces the characterization of the system state to a single variable and is formulated in four representations: moments, cumulants, the basis of Hermite functions, and the formal cumulant variant of the last. This elimination provides rigorous mathematical description for the overdamped limit in the case of linear dissipation and the overactive limit of active Brownian particles. For the former, we derive a low-dimensional equation system which generalizes the Ott-Antonsen Ansatz to systems with small effective inertia. In the latter case, we derive a Fokker-Planck-type equation with a forced drift term and an effective diffusion in one dimension, where the standard two-/three-dimensional mechanism is impossible. In the four considered representations, truncated equation chains are demonstrated to be utilitary for numerical simulation for a small finite inertia.

Title: Classical to Quantum Diffusive Transport in Atomically Thin Semiconductors Capped with High-k Dielectric
Authors: Jaroslaw Pawlowski, Dickson Thian, Repaka Maheswar, Chai Jian Wei, Pawan Kumar, Sudhiranjan Tripathy, Hugh O.H. Churchill, Dharmraj Kotekar Patil
Abstract: The dielectric environment surrounding semiconductors plays a crucial role in determining device performance, a role that becomes especially pronounced in atomically thin semiconductors where charge carriers are confined within a few atomic layers and strongly interact with their surroundings. High-k dielectrics, such as hafnium oxide (HfO2), have been shown to enhance the performance of two-dimensional (2D) materials by suppressing scattering from charged impurities and phonons, but most studies to date have focused on room-temperature transistor operation. Their influence on quantum transport properties at low temperatures remains largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate how capping monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) with HfO2 modifies its electronic behavior in the quantum regime. By comparing devices with and without HfO2 capping, we find that uncapped devices exhibit transport dominated by classical diffusive scattering, whereas capped devices show clear Fabry-Perot interference patterns, providing direct evidence of phase-coherent quantum transport enabled by dielectric screening. To gain further insight, we develop a tight-binding interferometer model that captures the effect of dielectric screening on conductive modes and reproduces the experimental trends. Our findings demonstrate that dielectric engineering provides a powerful route to control transport regimes in TMD devices.

Title: Techno-economic analysis of self-sustainable thermophotovoltaic systems for grid-scale energy generation
Authors: Jihun Lim, Sungwon Lee
Abstract: To facilitate the widespread adoption of renewable energy, dispatchable, zero-emission power sources are essential for grid stability. This work performs a comprehensive techno-economic analysis of a self-sustainable thermophotovoltaic (TPV) system, an architecture that integrates solar charging to function as a standalone power generation asset. Using theory-based models for air-bridge InGaAs and Si diode cells, our analysis reveals that while the system is not currently competitive from a pure levelized of storage cost (LCOS) perspective due to the high capital expenditure for thermal battery materials, its primary value lies in its competitive levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). The results demonstrate that the LCOE of this self-sustaining system can be competitive with conventional dispatchable generators, such as gas turbines. Furthermore, at scales exceeding the gigawatt-hour level, a Si-based system can also achieve an LCOE comparable to that of traditional gas-turbine power plants, despite having a lower conversion efficiency than its InGaAs counterpart. This highlights a practical engineering pathway for leveraging silicon's immense manufacturing scalability, offering a lower-risk route to deployment compared to III-V materials. Ultimately, this work establishes the self-sustainable TPV architecture as a compelling pathway toward providing grid-scale, on-demand, zero-emission power.

Title: Strong interlayer coupling and chiral flat-band cascades in twisted bilayer gratings
Authors: Daegwang Choi, Soon-Jae Lee, Seung-Woon Cho, Chan Bin Bark, Seik Pak, Dong-Jin Shin, Moon Jip Park, Su-Hyun Gong
Abstract: From atomic crystals to macroscopic material structures, twisted bilayer systems have emerged as a promising route to control wave phenomena. In few-layer van der Waals (vdW) materials, however, the intrinsically weak interlayer coupling typically demands fine control of small twist angles to reach magic-angle conditions. Here, we show that one-dimensional photonic crystal bilayers can overcome this limitation by accessing a regime of strong interlayer coupling -- comparable to intralayer coupling. This strong coupling enables flat-band formation over a broad angular range even at large twist angles. We experimentally realize this regime by stacking WS$_2$ gratings using a two-step lithography method, resulting in ultra-wide chiral flat-band cascades in magic-angle twisted bilayer gratings. Our work not only provides a platform for designing photonic applications with tunable localization but also explores a new regime of physics unattainable in conventional solid-state based moiré systems.

Title: A novel way of recasting the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer gap equations
Authors: Georgios Palkanoglou, Alexandros Gezerlis
Abstract: The gap equations lie at the core of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory, a standard tool in the description of superfluidity. As a set of non-linear integral equations, the gap equations' inherent difficulties oftentimes hinder even the crudest descriptions of superfluid states. Hard-core potentials, high-density superfluids, and coupled-channel pairing are all reasons that have historically required one to provide special treatment to the gap equations to get a solution. In this paper we present a new method for solving the gap equations that holds the promise of being an efficient universal solver that requires the minimum amount of \textit{a priori} knowledge of the targeted solutions. With theoretical evidence of exotic nuclear superfluidity posing new questions to our understanding of this fundamental property of nuclear systems, the presented method can be a valuable tool when exploring new pairing states, finite-temperature properties, or the development of sophisticated descriptions of nuclear superfludity.

Title: Quantum Resources in Non-Abelian Lattice Gauge Theories: Nonstabilizerness, Multipartite Entanglement, and Fermionic Non-Gaussianity
Authors: Gopal Chandra Santra, Julius Mildenberger, Edoardo Ballini, Alberto Bottarelli, Matteo M. Wauters, Philipp Hauke
Abstract: Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) represent one of the most ambitious goals of quantum simulation. From a practical implementation perspective, non-Abelian theories present significantly tougher challenges than Abelian LGTs. However, it is unknown whether this is also reflected in increased values of quantum resources relating to the complexity of simulating quantum many-body models. Here, we compare three paradigmatic measures of quantum resources -- stabilizer Rényi entropy, generalized geometric measure of entanglement, and fermionic antiflatness -- for pure-gauge theories on a ladder with Abelian $\mathbb{Z}_N$ as well as non-Abelian $D_3$ and SU(2) gauge symmetries. We find that non-Abelian symmetries are not necessarily inherently harder to simulate than Abelian ones, but rather the required quantum resources depend nontrivially on the interplay between the group structure, superselection sector, and encoding of the gauge constraints. Our findings help indicate where quantum advantage could emerge in simulations of LGTs, both in NISQ and fault-tolerant eras.

Title: Spectral properties and coding transitions of Haar-random quantum codes
Authors: Grace M. Sommers, J. Alexander Jacoby, Zack Weinstein, David A. Huse, Sarang Gopalakrishnan
Abstract: A quantum error-correcting code with a nonzero error threshold undergoes a mixed-state phase transition when the error rate reaches that threshold. We explore this phase transition for Haar-random quantum codes, in which the logical information is encoded in a random subspace of the physical Hilbert space. We focus on the spectrum of the encoded system density matrix as a function of the rate of uncorrelated, single-qudit errors. For low error rates, this spectrum consists of well-separated bands, representing errors of different weights. As the error rate increases, the bands for high-weight errors merge. The evolution of these bands with increasing error rate is well described by a simple analytic ansatz. Using this ansatz, as well as an explicit calculation, we show that the threshold for Haar-random quantum codes saturates the hashing bound, and thus coincides with that for random \emph{stabilizer} codes. For error rates that exceed the hashing bound, typical errors are uncorrectable, but postselected error correction remains possible until a much higher \emph{detection} threshold. Postselection can in principle be implemented by projecting onto subspaces corresponding to low-weight errors, which remain correctable past the hashing bound.

Title: Classical-quantum oscillators as diffusive processes in phase space
Authors: Emanuele Panella
Abstract: The dynamics of hybrid systems -- i.e. ones in which classical and quantum degrees of freedom co-exist and interact -- feature both diffusion in the classical sector and decoherence in the quantum state. In this article, we will consider the simple setup of a classical damped oscillator interacting with its quantum counterpart and show that, for any initial state, the dynamics flows to a unique (non-equilibrium) steady state, which we compute explicitly. To do so, we make use of a useful mapping between hybrid and classical diffusive dynamics, which we characterise in detail in the master equation formalism.

Title: Charged scalar bosons under rotation and acceleration
Authors: M. Bordag, D. N. Voskresensky
Abstract: Creation of charged spinless bosons from vacuum in the rigidly rotating frame is studied in presence of the external static electromagnetic fields, being formed either in the resting, or in the general rotating or in the local-flat frames. It is shown that the description remains the same in the resting and the local-flat frames. More specifically, the case of a solenoid (magnetic flux tube) embedded into the rotating empty cylinder (rotation frame) is studied in presence or absence of a static square electric potential well $eA_0$. A supervortex of a spinless-boson field can be created from vacuum when the rotation frequency exceeds a critical value $\Omega_c$. It is shown that $\Omega_c$ is smaller provided the solenoid rests in the resting frame. Then the case is considered when the rotating frame additionally moves with acceleration $\vec{w}(\vec{r})\neq 0$. A specific case $w(r)=G/r$ for $G=const$ is treated explicitly. It is shown that for $G<0$ the charged spinless-boson vortex can be created in rapidly rotating system even in the limit when the magnetic and electric fields tend to zero.

Title: Observation of Crystalline Nonlocal Volume Plasmon Waves
Authors: Sathwik Bharadwaj, Makoto Schreiber, Jungho Mun, Sam Ruttiman, Pronoy Das, Misa Hayashida, Marek Malac, Peter Nordlander, Zubin Jacob
Abstract: In plasmonics, nonlocal effects arise when the material response to optical excitations is strongly dependent on the spatial correlations of the excitation. It is well known that a classical free electron gas system supports local Drude volume plasmon waves. Whereas a compressible quantum electron gas system sustains hydrodynamic volume plasmons with nonlocal dispersion isotropic across all high-symmetry directions. Here, distinct from Drude and Hydrodynamic plasmon waves, we present the first observation of crystalline nonlocal volume plasmon waves. We use transmission-based momentum-resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy to measure the volume plasmon dispersion of silicon along all the fundamental symmetry axes, up to high momentum values ($q \sim 0.7$ reciprocal lattice units). We show that crystalline nonlocal plasmon waves have a prominent anisotropic dispersion with higher curvature along the light-mass ($\Gamma K$ \& $\Gamma L$) axes, compared to the heavy-mass ($\Gamma X$) axis. We unveil the origin of this phenomenon by experimentally extracting the anisotropic Fermi velocities of silicon. Our work highlights an exquisite nonlocality-induced anisotropy of volume plasmon waves, providing pathways for probing many-body quantum effects at extreme momenta.

Title: Reconfigurable dissipative entanglement between many spin ensembles: from robust quantum sensing to many-body state engineering
Authors: Anjun Chu, Mikhail Mamaev, Martin Koppenhöfer, Ming Yuan, Aashish A. Clerk
Abstract: An attractive approach for stabilizing entangled many-body spin states is to employ engineered dissipation. Most existing proposals either target relatively simple collective spin states, or require numerous independent and complex dissipative processes. Here, we show a surprisingly versatile scheme for many-body reservoir engineering that relies solely on fully collective single-excitation decay, augmented with local Hamiltonian terms. Crucially, all these ingredients are readily available in cavity QED setups. Our method is based on splitting the spin system into groups of sub-ensembles, and provides an easily tunable setup for stabilizing a broad family of pure, highly entangled states with closed-form analytic descriptions. Our results have immediate application to multi-ensemble quantum metrology, enabling Heisenberg-limited sensing of field gradients and curvatures. Notably, the generated states have robustness against common-mode phase noise, and only require simple Ramsey-style measurements. The same setup also allows the stabilization of entangled states in a 1D chain of spin ensembles with symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order, and have a direct connection to the outputs of sequential unitary circuits. In particular, we present an efficient method for engineering the celebrated spin-1 Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) state.

Title: A Virtual Fields Method-Genetic Algorithm (VFM-GA) calibration framework for isotropic hyperelastic constitutive models with application to an elastomeric foam material
Authors: Zicheng Yan (1), Jialiang Tao (2), Christian Franck (2), David L. Henann (1) ((1) Brown University, (2) University of Wisconsin-Madison)
Abstract: This work introduces a calibration framework for material parameter identification in isotropic hyperelastic constitutive models. The framework synergizes the Virtual Fields Method (VFM) to define an objective function with a Genetic Algorithm (GA) as the optimization method to facilitate automated calibration. The formulation of the objective function uses experimental displacement fields measured from Digital Image Correlation (DIC) synchronized with load cell data and can accommodate data from experiments involving homogeneous or inhomogeneous deformation fields. The framework places no restrictions on the target isotropic hyperelastic constitutive model, accommodating models with coupled dependencies on deformation invariants and specialized functional forms with a number of material parameters, and assesses material stability, eliminating sets of material parameters that potentially lead to non-physical behavior for the target hyperelastic constitutive model. To minimize the objective function, a GA is deployed as the optimization tool due to its ability to navigate the intricate landscape of material parameter space. The VFM-GA framework is evaluated by applying it to a hyperelastic constitutive model for compressible elastomeric foams. The evaluation process entails a number of tests that employ both homogeneous and inhomogeneous displacement fields collected from DIC experiments on open-cell foam specimens. The results outperform manual fitting, demonstrating the framework's robust and efficient capability to handle material parameter identification for complex hyperelastic constitutive models.

Title: Lithographic integration of TES microcalorimeters with SQUID multiplexer circuits for large format spectrometers

Abstract: Arrays of hundreds or thousands of low temperature detectors have been deployed for many experiments, both bolometers for long wavelength applications and calorimeters for shorter wavelength applications. One challenge that is common to many of these arrays is the efficient use of focal plane area to achieve a large fill fraction of absorbers coupled to detectors. We are developing an integrated fabrication of soft X-ray transition edge sensors (TES) and microwave SQUID multiplexers ($\mu$MUX) with the goal of maximizing the fill fraction of the focal plane area on a scale of many thousand pixel detectors. We will utilize lithographically defined high density interconnects to circumvent limitations in existing solutions that use wirebonds or flip-chip bonds. Here we report the first demonstration of combining TES and $\mu$MUX processes into a single TES-System-on-a-Chip (TES-SoC) fabrication on a silicon wafer. The $\mu$MUX SQUIDs and TES electrothermal feedback circuits are microfabricated first and protected with passivating SiO$_2$, then the TES devices and TES-to-SQUID interconnects are fabricated, and finally the protective layer is removed before the fabrication of the microwave resonators. We show that the microwave SQUIDs are functional and have reasonable yield, and that we are able to read out the transition temperature of the connected TESs using those SQUIDs.

Title: Balanced ternary formalism of second quantization
Authors: Yao Yao
Abstract: We construct a second-quantized representation with a structure of balanced ternary formalism, which involves three substances in organic molecular materials, namely electron, hole and charge-transfer exciton, into a uniform framework. The quantum thermodynamic of excitons is investigated in a closed and compact manner, benefitting from the interplay of the three substances. In order to be friendly with quantum simulations, the interactions among them are all described with unitary transformations. Significantly, the nonconserving dynamics of particle numbers, such as the generation of charge current and the exciton fission in organic semiconductors, is consistently expressed by this unitary formalism on the basis of bosonic coherent states. The spin degree of freedom is further taken into account, and an exotic molecular ferromagnetic ordering is induced in a specific configuration of excitons. This balanced ternary formalism establishes a solid bridge to connect thermodynamics and quantum simulations.

Title: Hot-carrier generation in bimetallic Janus nanoparticles
Authors: Hanwen Jin, Chengcheng Xiao, Matias Herran, Emiliano Cortes, Shiwu Gao, Johannes Lischner
Abstract: Energetic electrons and holes generated from the decay of localized surface plasmons in metallic nanoparticles can be harnessed in nanoscale devices for photocatalysis, photovoltaics or sensing. In this work, we study the generation of such hot carriers in bimetallic Janus nanoparticles composed of Au, Ag and Cu using a recently developed atomistic modelling approach that combines a solution of the macroscopic Maxwell equation with large-scale quantum-mechanical tight-binding models. We first analyze spherical Janus nanoparticles whose unique hot-carrier spectrum can be associated with the spectra of the two hemispheres and the interface coupling and find that under solar illumination the Ag-Au system exhibits the highest hot-carrier generation rate. For dumbbell-shaped Janus nanoparticles, we observe a significant increase in hot-carrier generation with increasing neck size. This is caused by a dramatic enhancement of the electric field in the neck region. We also study the dependence of hot-carrier generation on the light polarization and find that the largest generation rates are obtained when the electric field is perpendicular to the interface between the two metals due to the maximal dipole coupling with the electric field. The insights from our study will guide the experimental design of efficient hot-carrier devices based on bimetallic Janus nanoparticles.

Title: Local active error correction from simulated confinement
Authors: Ethan Lake
Abstract: We refine an old idea for performing fault-tolerant error correction in topological codes by simulating confining interactions between excitations. We implement confinement using an array of local classical processors that measure syndromes, broadcast messages to neighboring processors, and move excitations using received messages. The dynamics of the resulting real-time decoder is geometrically local, homogeneous in spacetime, and self-organized, operating without any form of global control. On a system of linear size $L$, our decoder requires access to $O({\rm polylog}(L))$ noiseless classical bits for each qubit, and we prove that below a threshold error rate, it achieves a memory lifetime scaling as a stretched exponential in $L$. When applied to the surface code subject to depolarizing noise and measurement errors of equal strength, numerics indicate a threshold at $p_c \approx 1.5\%$.

Title: Valley polarization of graphene via the saddle point
Authors: Deepika Gill, Sangeeta Sharma, Peter Elliott, Kay Dewhurst, Sam Shallcross
Abstract: Graphene, and other members of the monolayer Xene family, represent an ideal materials platform for "valleytronics", the control of valley localized charge excitations. The absence of a gap in these semi-metals, however, precludes valley excitation by circularly polarized light pulses, sharply circumscribing the possibility of a lightwave valleytronics in these materials. Here we show that combining a deep ultraviolet linearly polarized light pulse with a THz envelope can induce highly valley polarized states in graphene. This dual frequency lightform operates by (i) the deep ultraviolet pulse activating a selection rule at the M saddle points and (ii) the THz pulse displacing the M point excitation to one of the low-energy K valleys. Employing both tight-binding and state-of-the-art time dependent density functional theory, we show that such a pulse results in a near perfect valley polarized excitation in graphene, thus providing a route via the saddle point to a lightwave valleytronics in the gapless Xene family.

Title: Characterizing Liouvillian Exceptional Points Through Newton Polygons and Tropical Geometry
Authors: Sayooj P, Awadhesh Narayan
Abstract: The dynamics of open quantum systems described by the Lindblad master equation follows according to non-Hermitian operators. As a result, such systems can host non-Hermitian degeneracies called Liouvillian exceptional points (EPs). In this work, we show that Newton polygons and tropical geometric approach allow identification and characterization of Liouvillian EPs. We use two models -- dissipative spin$-1/2$ system and dissipative superconducting qubit system -- to illustrate our method. We demonstrate that our approach captures the anisotropy and order of the Liouvillian EPs, while also revealing the subtle dependence on the form of the perturbation. Our analytical analysis is supplemented by direct numerical calculations of the scaling and exchange of eigenvalues around Liouvillian EPs. Our analytical approach could be useful in understanding and designing Liouvillian EPs of desired order.

Title: Entanglement Growth from Entangled States: A Unified Perspective on Entanglement Generation and Transport
Authors: Chun-Yue Zhang, Zi-Xiang Li, Shi-Xin Zhang
Abstract: Studies of entanglement dynamics in quantum many-body systems have focused largely on initial product states. Here, we investigate the far richer dynamics from initial entangled states, uncovering universal patterns across diverse systems ranging from many-body localization (MBL) to random quantum circuits. Our central finding is that the growth of entanglement entropy can exhibit a non-monotonic dependence on the initial entanglement in many non-ergodic systems, peaking for moderately entangled initial states. To understand this phenomenon, we introduce a conceptual framework that decomposes entanglement growth into two mechanisms: ``build'' and ``move''. The ``build'' mechanism creates new entanglement, while the ``move'' mechanism redistributes pre-existing entanglement throughout the system. We model a pure ``move'' dynamics with a random SWAP circuit, showing it uniformly distributes entanglement across all bipartitions. We find that MBL dynamics are ``move-dominated'', which naturally explains the observed non-monotonicity of the entanglement growth. This ``build-move'' framework offers a unified perspective for classifying diverse physical dynamics, deepening our understanding of entanglement propagation and information processing in quantum many-body systems.

Title: When Less is More: Approximating the Quantum Geometric Tensor with Block Structures
Authors: Ahmedeo Shokry, Alessandro Santini, Filippo Vicentini
Abstract: The natural gradient is central in neural quantum states optimizations but it is limited by the cost of computing and inverting the quantum geometric tensor, the quantum analogue of the Fisher information matrix. We introduce a block-diagonal quantum geometric tensor that partitions the metric by network layers, analogous to block-structured Fisher methods such as K-FAC. This layer-wise approximation preserves essential curvature while removing noisy cross-layer correlations, improving conditioning and scalability. Experiments on Heisenberg and frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ models show faster convergence, lower energy, and improved stability.

Title: Random unitaries from Hamiltonian dynamics
Authors: Laura Cui, Thomas Schuster, Liang Mao, Hsin-Yuan Huang, Fernando Brandao
Abstract: The nature of randomness and complexity growth in systems governed by unitary dynamics is a fundamental question in quantum many-body physics. This problem has motivated the study of models such as local random circuits and their convergence to Haar-random unitaries in the long-time limit. However, these models do not correspond to any family of physical time-independent Hamiltonians. In this work, we address this gap by studying the indistinguishability of time-independent Hamiltonian dynamics from truly random unitaries. On one hand, we establish a no-go result showing that for any ensemble of constant-local Hamiltonians and any evolution times, the resulting time-evolution unitary can be efficiently distinguished from Haar-random and fails to form a $2$-design or a pseudorandom unitary (PRU). On the other hand, we prove that this limitation can be overcome by increasing the locality slightly: there exist ensembles of random polylog-local Hamiltonians in one-dimension such that under constant evolution time, the resulting time-evolution unitary is indistinguishable from Haar-random, i.e. it forms both a unitary $k$-design and a PRU. Moreover, these Hamiltonians can be efficiently simulated under standard cryptographic assumptions.

Title: Random unitaries that conserve energy
Authors: Liang Mao, Laura Cui, Thomas Schuster, Hsin-Yuan Huang
Abstract: Random unitaries sampled from the Haar measure serve as fundamental models for generic quantum many-body dynamics. Under standard cryptographic assumptions, recent works have constructed polynomial-size quantum circuits that are computationally indistinguishable from Haar-random unitaries, establishing the concept of pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs). While PRUs have found broad implications in many-body physics, they fail to capture the energy conservation that governs physical systems. In this work, we investigate the computational complexity of generating PRUs that conserve energy under a fixed and known Hamiltonian $H$. We provide an efficient construction of energy-conserving PRUs when $H$ is local and commuting with random coefficients. Conversely, we prove that for certain translationally invariant one-dimensional $H$, there exists an efficient quantum algorithm that can distinguish truly random energy-conserving unitaries from any polynomial-size quantum circuit. This establishes that energy-conserving PRUs cannot exist for these Hamiltonians. Furthermore, we prove that determining whether energy-conserving PRUs exist for a given family of one-dimensional local Hamiltonians is an undecidable problem. Our results reveal an unexpected computational barrier that fundamentally separates the generation of generic random unitaries from those obeying the basic physical constraint of energy conservation.

Title: Optimal Distillation of Qubit Clocks
Authors: Sujay Kazi, Iman Marvian
Abstract: We study coherence distillation under time-translation-invariant operations: given many copies of a quantum state containing coherence in the energy eigenbasis, the aim is to produce a purer coherent state while respecting the time-translation symmetry. This symmetry ensures that the output remains synchronized with the input and that the process can be realized by energy-conserving unitaries coupling the system to a reservoir initially in an energy eigenstate, thereby modeling thermal operations supplemented by a work reservoir or battery. For qubit systems, we determine the optimal asymptotic fidelity and show that it is governed by the purity of coherence, a measure of asymmetry derived from the right logarithmic derivative (RLD) Fisher information. In particular, we find that the lowest achievable infidelity (one minus fidelity) scales as $1/N$ times the reciprocal of the purity of coherence of each input qubit, where $N$ is the number of copies, giving this quantity a clear operational meaning. We additionally study many other interesting aspects of the coherence distillation problem for qubits, including computing higher-order corrections to the lowest achievable infidelity up to $O(1/N^3)$, and expressing the optimal channel as a boundary value problem that can be solved numerically.

Title: Average-case quantum complexity from glassiness
Authors: Alexander Zlokapa, Bobak T. Kiani, Eric R. Anschuetz
Abstract: Glassiness -- a phenomenon in physics characterized by a rough free-energy landscape -- implies hardness for stable classical algorithms. For example, it can obstruct constant-time Langevin dynamics and message-passing in random $k$-SAT and max-cut instances. We provide an analogous framework for average-case quantum complexity showing that a natural family of quantum algorithms (e.g., Lindbladian evolution) fails for natural Hamiltonian ensembles (e.g., random 3-local Hamiltonians). Specifically, we prove that the standard notion of quantum glassiness based on replica symmetry breaking obstructs stable quantum algorithms for Gibbs sampling, which we define by a Lipschitz temperature dependence in quantum Wasserstein complexity. Our proof relies on showing that such algorithms fail to capture a structural phase transition in the Gibbs state, where glassiness causes the Gibbs state to decompose into clusters extensively separated in quantum Wasserstein distance. This yields average-case lower bounds for constant-time local Lindbladian evolution and shallow variational circuits. Unlike mixing time lower bounds, our results hold even when dynamics are initialized from the maximally mixed state. We apply these lower bounds to non-commuting, non-stoquastic Hamiltonians by showing a glass transition via the replica trick. We find that the ensemble of all 3-local Pauli strings with independent Gaussian coefficients is average-case hard, while providing analytical evidence that the general $p$-local Pauli ensemble is non-glassy for sufficiently large constant $p$, in contrast to its classical (Ising $p$-spin, always glassy) and fermionic (SYK, never glassy) counterparts.

Title: Quantum Probe Tomography
Authors: Sitan Chen, Jordan Cotler, Hsin-Yuan Huang
Abstract: Characterizing quantum many-body systems is a fundamental problem across physics, chemistry, and materials science. While significant progress has been made, many existing Hamiltonian learning protocols demand digital quantum control over the entire system, creating a disconnect from many real-world settings that provide access only through small, local probes. Motivated by this, we introduce and formalize the problem of quantum probe tomography, where one seeks to learn the parameters of a many-body Hamiltonian using a single local probe access to a small subsystem of a many-body thermal state undergoing time evolution. We address the identifiability problem of determining which Hamiltonians can be distinguished from probe data through a new combination of tools from algebraic geometry and smoothed analysis. Using this approach, we prove that generic Hamiltonians in various physically natural families are identifiable up to simple, unavoidable structural symmetries. Building on these insights, we design the first efficient end-to-end algorithm for probe tomography that learns Hamiltonian parameters to accuracy $\varepsilon$, with query complexity scaling polynomially in $1/\varepsilon$ and classical post-processing time scaling polylogarithmically in $1/\varepsilon$. In particular, we demonstrate that translation- and rotation-invariant nearest-neighbor Hamiltonians on square lattices in one, two, and three dimensions can be efficiently reconstructed from single-site probes of the Gibbs state, up to inversion symmetry about the probed site. Our results demonstrate that robust Hamiltonian learning remains achievable even under severely constrained experimental access.

Title: Hardness of recognizing phases of matter
Authors: Thomas Schuster, Dominik Kufel, Norman Y. Yao, Hsin-Yuan Huang
Abstract: We prove that recognizing the phase of matter of an unknown quantum state is quantum computationally hard. More specifically, we show that the quantum computational time of any phase recognition algorithm must grow exponentially in the range of correlations $\xi$ of the unknown state. This exponential growth renders the problem practically infeasible for even moderate correlation ranges, and leads to super-polynomial quantum computational time in the system size $n$ whenever $\xi = \omega(\log n)$. Our results apply to a substantial portion of all known phases of matter, including symmetry-breaking phases and symmetry-protected topological phases for any discrete on-site symmetry group in any spatial dimension. To establish this hardness, we extend the study of pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) to quantum systems with symmetries. We prove that symmetric PRUs exist under standard cryptographic conjectures, and can be constructed in extremely low circuit depths. We also establish hardness for systems with translation invariance and purely classical phases of matter. A key technical limitation is that the locality of the parent Hamiltonians of the states we consider is linear in $\xi$; the complexity of phase recognition for Hamiltonians with constant locality remains an important open question.

Title: Quenching, Fast and Slow: Breaking Kibble-Zurek Universal Scaling by Jumping along Geodesics
Authors: Thi Ha Kyaw, Guillermo Romero, Gaurav Saxena
Abstract: A major drawback of adiabatic quantum computing (AQC) is fulfilling the energy gap constraint, which requires the total evolution time to scale inversely with the square of the minimum energy gap. Failure to satisfy this condition violates the adiabatic approximation, potentially undermining computational accuracy. Recently, several approaches have been proposed to circumvent this constraint. One promising approach is to use the family of adiabatic shortcut procedures to fast-forward AQC. One caveat, however, is that it requires an additional Hamiltonian that is very challenging to implement experimentally. Here, we investigate an alternate pathway that avoids any extra Hamiltonian in the evolution to fast-forward the adiabatic dynamics by traversing geodesics of a quantum system. We find that jumping along geodesics offers a striking mechanism to highly suppress the density of excitations in many-body systems. Particularly, for the spin-$1/2$ XY model, we analytically prove and numerically demonstrate a rate-independent defect plateau, which contrasts with well-established results for the Kibble-Zurek and anti-Kibble-Zurek mechanisms.

Title: A Structural Theory of Quantum Metastability: Markov Properties and Area Laws
Authors: Thiago Bergamaschi, Chi-Fang Chen, Umesh Vazirani
Abstract: Statistical mechanics assumes that a quantum many-body system at low temperature can be effectively described by its Gibbs state. However, many complex quantum systems exist only as metastable states of dissipative open system dynamics, which appear stable and robust yet deviate substantially from true thermal equilibrium. In this work, we model metastable states as approximate stationary states of a quasi-local, (KMS)-detailed-balanced master equation representing Markovian system-bath interaction, and unveil a universal structural theory: all metastable states satisfy an area law of mutual information and a Markov property. The more metastable the states are, the larger the regions to which these structural results apply. Therefore, the hallmark correlation structure and noise resilience of Gibbs states are not exclusive to true equilibrium but emerge dynamically. Behind our structural results lies a systematic framework encompassing sharp equivalences between local minima of free energy, a non-commutative Fisher information, and approximate detailed balance conditions. Our results build towards a comprehensive theory of thermal metastability and, in turn, formulate a well-defined, feasible, and repeatable target for quantum thermal simulation.

Title: Efficient sampling method for multi-component ZrCu(Al) metallic glasses
Authors: Filip Kaskosz, Rene Alvarez-Donado, Mikko Alava, Anshul D.S. Parmar, Silvia Bonfanti
Abstract: We investigate multi-component metallic glass systems using a hybrid Molecular Dynamics (MD) and Variance-Constrained Semi-Grand Canonical approach. This method enables us to generate samples with properties consistent with experimental observations, at deeply supercooled states that are typically inaccessible with conventional MD simulations. Using a realistic interatomic potential, we investigate the dynamics, kinetic stability, and rheology of a ZrCuAl metallic glass, together with the widely studied ZrCu system, in the low-temperature glassy regime, specifically, for ZrCu below its experimental glass-transition temperature. Our results demonstrate how the hybrid method enhances relaxation and provides a generic framework for modeling realistic complex metallic glasses in close agreement with experimental observations.

Title: Nonlinear response functions and disorder: the case of photogalvanic effect
Authors: Konstantinos Ladovrechis, Tobias Meng
Abstract: We investigate the impact of disorder in the form of impurity scattering on a generalized version of the circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE) in Weyl semimetals where the frequency detuning between the two orthogonally polarized beams is nonzero. Considering a minimal model with two Weyl nodes at different energies, we employ the self-consistent Born approximation to unravel the dependence of the associated two-point retarded Green's function on the strength of intra- and internode scattering, frequency detuning, and energy difference between the two Weyl nodes. In the case of intranode scattering only, the second-order current density acquires Drude-like features, which we elucidate further by introducing an effective scattering strength. The Drude-like theory can even describe the second-order response in the presence of strong internode scattering, provided the latter has a linear interdependence with the intranode scattering. By properly adjusting the frequency detuning, we also find the real part of the two-point retarded Green's function to be reminiscent of a "quantized CPGE"-like form, although the imaginary part of the latter function is in general finite, and the second-order current density oscillates with time due to the finite frequency detuning. We finally conclude with an outlook on possible experimental consequences.

Title: Active Caustics
Authors: Rahul Chajwa, Rajarshi, Rama Govindarajan, Sriram Ramaswamy
Abstract: Inertial particles (IPs) in vortical fluid flow cluster strongly, forming singular structures termed caustics for their resemblance to focal surfaces in optics. Here we show that such extreme aggregation onto low-dimensional submanifolds can arise without mechanical inertia for self-propelled particles (SPPs), through a formal correspondence between the dynamics of IPs and SPPs in a generic background flow. We establish that a singular perturbation underlies caustics formation by SPPs around a single vortex, and numerical studies of SPPs in two-dimensional Navier-Stokes turbulence reveal intense caustics in straining regions of the flow, peaking at intermediate levels of self-propulsion. Our work offers a route to singularly high local concentrations in a macroscopically dilute suspension of zero-Reynolds-number swimmers. Caustics generate burst-like encounters through large relative velocities between neighboring swimmers, with potentially significant implications for communication and sexual reproduction. An intriguing open direction is whether the active turbulence of a suspension of swimming microbes could serve to generate caustics in its own concentration

Title: Topological phases in discrete stochastic systems
Authors: Jaime Agudo-Canalejo, Evelyn Tang
Abstract: Topological invariants have proved useful for analyzing emergent function as they characterize a property of the entire system, and are insensitive to local details, disorder, and noise. They support boundary states, which reduce the system response to a lower dimensional space and, in 2D systems, offer a mechanism for the emergence of global cycles within a large phase space. Topological invariants have been heavily studied in quantum electronic systems and have been observed in other classical platforms such as mechanical lattices. However, this framework largely describes equilibrium systems within an ordered crystalline lattice, whereas biological systems are often strongly non-equilibrium with stochastic components. We review recent developments in topological states in discrete stochastic models in 1D and 2D systems, and initial progress in identifying testable signature of topological states in molecular systems and ecology. These models further provide simple principles for targeted dynamics in synthetic systems and in the engineering of reconfigurable materials. Lastly, we describe novel theoretical properties of these systems such as the necessity for non-Hermiticity in permitting edge states, as well as new analytical tools to reveal these properties. The emerging developments shed light on fundamental principles for non-equilibrium systems and topological protection enabling robust biological function.

Title: Transfer Matrix and Lattice Dilatation Operator for High-Quality Fixed Points in Tensor Network Renormalization Group
Authors: Nikolay Ebel, Tom Kennedy, Slava Rychkov
Abstract: Tensor network renormalization group maps study critical points of 2d lattice models like the Ising model by finding the fixed point of the RG map. In a prior work arXiv:2408.10312 we showed that by adding a rotation to the RG map, the Newton method could be implemented to find an extremely accurate fixed point. For a particular RG map (Gilt-TNR) we studied the spectrum of the Jacobian of the RG map at the fixed point and found good agreement between the eigenvalues corresponding to relevant and marginal operators and their known exact values. In this companion work we use two further methods to extract many more scaling dimensions from this Newton method fixed point, and compare the numerical results with the predictions of conformal field theory (CFT). The first method is the well-known transfer matrix (TM), while the second method we refer to as the lattice dilatation operator (LDO). We introduce some extensions of these method that provide also spins of the CFT operators, modulo an integer. With comparable computing resources, the TM and LDO methods perform equally well. The agreement for the scaling dimensions and spins is excellent up to the scaling dimesnion 4.125, and reasonably good up to 2 units higher. Some of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian of the RG map can come from perturbations associated with total derivative interactions and so are not universal. In some past studies (arXiv:2102.08136, arXiv:2305.09899) such non-universal eigenvalues did not appear in the Jacobian. We explain this surprising result by showing that their RG map has the unusual property that the Jacobian is equivalent to the LDO operator.

Title: Revealing the Geometrical and Vibrational Properties of the Defects Driving the Boson Peak
Authors: Shivam Mahajan, Darryl Seow Yang Han, Cunyuan Jiang, Matteo Baggioli, Massimo Pica Ciamarra
Abstract: In amorphous solids, the vibrational density of states shows an excess of modes over the Debye model, known as the boson peak, whose origin remains unclear. Studies suggest a link to quasi-localized nonphononic vibrations or 'defects,' but identifying them is challenging due to hybridization with phonons that renders methods based on localization properties, such as the participation ratio, unreliable. We introduce a practical method to separate hybridized phonons from localized vibrations and find that boson peak phonons hybridize with compact, two-dimensional defects exhibiting oscillatory pure shear deformations. These two-dimensional defects are also exposed by the procedure recently employed to identify stringlets (Nature Physics volume 18, pages 669-677 (2022)), suggesting that these may not be one-dimensional objects as speculated. Our work demonstrates the presence of localized defects at the boson peak frequency and provides a comprehensive characterization of their vibrational and geometric properties, resolving the tension between the concepts of quasi-localized quadrupolar defects and stringlets.

Title: Nonequilibrium chemical short-range order in metallic alloys
Authors: Mahmudul Islam, Killian Sheriff, Yifan Cao, Rodrigo Freitas
Abstract: Metallic alloys are routinely subjected to nonequilibrium processes during manufacturing, such as rapid solidification and thermomechanical processing. It has been suggested in the high-entropy alloy literature that chemical short-range order (SRO) could offer a new knob to tailor materials properties. While evidence of the effect of SRO on materials properties accumulates, the state of SRO evolution during alloy manufacturing remains obscure. Here, we employ high-fidelity atomistic simulations to track SRO evolution during the solidification and thermomechanical processing of alloys. Our investigation reveals that alloy processing can lead to nonequilibrium steady-states of SRO that are different from any equilibrium state. The mechanism behind nonequilibrium SRO formation is shown to be an inherent ordering bias present in nonequilibrium events. These results demonstrate that conventional manufacturing processes provide pathways for tuning SRO that lead to a broad nonequilibrium spectrum of SRO states beyond the equilibrium design space of alloys.

Title: Entanglement and confinement: A new pairing mechanism in high-T_{C} cuprates
Authors: Felix A. Buot, Roland E. S. Otadoy, Unofre Pili
Abstract: We demonstrate that entanglement and confinement hole pairing (ECHP) is the precise physics for the entanglement framework of the RVB theory of high-Tc cuprates. Our novel strong ECHP mechanism explains the whole phase diagram of both electron and hole-doped cuprates, notably the linearly decreasing T* at the pseudogap, the duality of spin-gap and strange-metal phase, the Tc=T* at the optimum doping and the rest of over-doped regions of SC dome, presence of parallel superconducting stripes in CuO plane (spin-polarized and spin-unpolarized channels), and linear-T behavior of strange-metal phase above the overdoped regions of SC dome. It also explains experimental spin textures of cuprates. We refer to our new ECHP model as a resonating entanglement-confinement hole pair (RECHP) theory. Based on RECHP theory, we are able to give a conceptual and comprehensive qualitative explanation of the whole phase diagram, thus giving the sought-after mechanism responsible for the whole phase diagram of high-Tc cuprates.

Title: Direct imaging and control of Berry curvature in noncollinear antiferromagnetic single-crystal thin films

Abstract: The discovery of the intrinsic anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in noncollinear antiferromagnets where transverse Hall voltage emerges without magnetic field, has opened a plethora of promising opportunities in antiferromagnetic devices. The key challenges limiting their full potential are (1) high-quality epitaxial thin-film growth and (2) the understanding of Berry curvature domain physics. Here, we focus on a noncollinear antiperovskite antiferromagnet Mn3NiN as a model system, successfully grown as a single-crystal epitaxial thin film. Combining multiple experiments supported by theoretical calculations, we probe the Berry curvature associated with antiferromagnetic {\Gamma}4g domains in Mn3NiN and its strong connection to an AHE. We directly image the intrinsic Berry curvature with high-resolution Sagnac microscopy, controlling spatial distribution and dynamics by varying temperature and applied magnetic fields. We discover that the {\Gamma}4g domains are switchable near the Néel transition, but become frozen and unresponsive to external stimuli at low temperature. This behavior enables the tuning of Berry-curvature driven AHE and magneto-optic Kerr effect responses through controlled experimental conditions. Our findings provide critical advancement of the fundamental understanding and wide tunability of Berry curvature in noncollinear antiferromagnets important for realization in potential spintronic applications.

Title: Symmetry-designed BiFeO3 single domain spin cycloid for efficient spintronics

Abstract: Deterministic control of coupled ferroelectric and antiferromagnetic orders remains a central challenge in multiferroics, limiting their integration into functional magnetoelectrics and magnonic-devices. (111)pc BiFeO3 with a robust single spin cycloid, offers direct magnetoelectric-coupling and a platform for efficient spin transport, yet multi-magnetic domains and ferroelectric-fatigue have prevented reproducible control. Here, we show that anisotropic-compressive in-plane strain stabilizes a single antiferromagnetic domain with unique spin-cycloid vector, by breaking the symmetry of the (111)pc plane. Epitaxial BiFeO3 films grown on orthorhombic NdGaO3 (011)o [(111)pc] substrates impose the required anisotropic in-plane strain and stabilizes single antiferromagnetic domain, as confirmed through direct imaging with scanning NV microscopy and non-resonant-x-ray-magnetic-scattering. Remarkably, these engineered films exhibit deterministic and non-volatile 180° switching of ferroelectric and single antiferromagnetic domains over 1,000 cycles. The monodomain state also enables anisotropic and threefold enhanced magnon transport with reduced scattering. Thus, symmetry-designed (111)pc monodomain BiFeO3 offers a robust platform for advanced magnetoelectric and magnonic applications.

Title: Specific heat of Gd$^{3+}$ and Eu$^{2+}$-based magnetic compounds
Authors: D. J. Garcia, J. G. Sereni, A. A. Aligia
Abstract: We have studied theoretically the specific heat of a large number of non-frustrated magnetic structures described by the Heisenberg model for systems with total angular momentum $J=7/2$, corresponding to the 4f$^7$ configuration of Gd$^{+3}$ and Eu$^{+2}$. For a given critical temperature (determined by the magnitude of the exchange interactions), we find that, to a high degree of accuracy, the specific heat is governed by two primary parameters: the effective number of neighbors $z$, which dictates the extent of spatial and quantum fluctuations, and the axial anisotropy $K$. The universality of $z$ (its ability to describe specific heat across diverse lattices) holds robustly for systems where exchange interactions do not strongly increase with distance and in the absence of frustration. Otherwise, deviations from universality emerge. Using these two parameters we fit the specific heat of four Gd compounds and two Eu compounds, achieving a remarkable agreement. The present approach enables the extraction of magnetic interaction parameters not accessible through mean-field theory, offering a powerful tool for interpreting specific heat data in 4f$^7$ systems.

Title: P-adic numbers and kernels
Authors: Simone Franchini
Abstract: We discuss the relation between p-adic numbers and kernels in view of a recent large deviation theory for mean-field spin glasses. As an application we show several fundamental properties of numerical bases in kernel language. In particular, we show that the Derrida's Generalized Random Energy Model can be interpreted as a (random) numerical base. We also show an application to the Primon gas and the Riemann Zeta Function by constructing a kernel representation of the Primon gas based on a finite p-base, thereby establishing a concrete link between number theory and kernel theory.

Title: Hexatic Phase in Covalent Two-Dimensional Silver Iodide

Abstract: According to the Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young (KTHNY) theory, the transition from a solid to liquid in two dimensions (2D) proceeds through an orientationally ordered liquid-like hexatic phase. However, alternative mixed-melting scenarios, in which melting proceeds through the hexatic phase with both continuous and discontinuous transitions, have also been observed in some 2D systems. Here, we imaged silver iodide (AgI) embedded in multilayer graphene using time and temperature resolved in-situ atomic-resolution scanning transmission microscopy (STEM) and nanobeam electron diffraction. We observe the hexatic phase and provide evidence supporting a mixed melting scenario.

Title: The Mottness and the Anderson localization in bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-δ}$
Authors: Yuxin Wang, Ziyan Chen, Yi Zhang, Kun Jiang, Jiangping Hu
Abstract: The oxygen content plays a pivotal role in determining the electronic and superconducting properties of the recently discovered La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ superconductors. In this work, we investigate the impact of oxygen vacancies on the insulating behavior of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ across the doping range $\delta = 0$ to $0.5$. At $\delta = 0.5$, we construct a bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model to describe the system. Using dynamical mean-field theory, we demonstrate that the model captures the characteristics of a bilayer Mott insulator. To explore the effects of disorder within the range $\delta = 0$ to $0.5$, we treat the system as a mixture of metallic and Mott insulating phases. By applying the dynamical cluster approximation and the typical medium dynamical cluster approximation, we identify an Anderson localization transition at a critical doping of $\delta \sim 0.2$ through the geometric average of the local density of states. This Anderson localization transition is the key reason for the suppression of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$. These results provide a quantitative explanation of recent experimental observations and highlight the critical influence of oxygen content on the physical properties of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$.

Title: Stress-induced phase transformations in Ti-15Mo alloy at elevated temperature
Authors: Petr Harcuba, Tomáš Krajňák, Dalibor Preisler, Jiří Kozlík, Josef Stráský, Jana Šmilauerová, Fernando Gustavo Warchomicka, Miloš Janeček
Abstract: Controlled mechanical loading was applied to Ti-15Mo alloy during annealing at 550 $^\circ$C. Massive formation of the $\omega_{\textrm{iso}}$ phase from the parent $\beta$-phase occurred during annealing at 550 $^\circ$C without external stress or with stress well below the yield stress. Moreover, a massive $\alpha$ phase precipitation takes place under simultaneous annealing and plastic deformation. Plastic deformation plays a key role in $\beta\rightarrow\alpha$ transformation and achieving refined $\alpha+\beta$ type microstructure resulted in improved mechanical properties. Studying phase transformations during plastic deformation is critical for understanding and optimizing thermomechanical processing of metastable $\beta$-Ti alloys.

Title: Topologically Charged Vortices at Superconductor-Quantum Hall Interfaces
Authors: Enderalp Yakaboylu, Thomas L. Schmidt
Abstract: We explore interface states between a type-II $s$-wave superconductor (SC) and a $\nu = 1$ quantum Hall (QH) state. We show that the effective interaction gives rise to two emergent Abelian Higgs fields, representing paired electrons localized at the SC-QH interface. These fields interact with each other in the presence of a Chern-Simons term originating from the QH sector. The Chern-Simons term leads to a topological contribution to the photon mass and imparts a \emph{fractional} topological charge of $e/2$ to the interface vortices. The topological mass modifies the vortex lattice at the interface, while the topological charge leads to formation of vortex quadruplets. We predict that these effects lead to a \emph{topological} Abrikosov lattice at the interface.

Title: Thermodynamic entropic uncertainty relation
Authors: Yoshihiko Hasegawa, Tomohiro Nishiyama
Abstract: Thermodynamic uncertainty relations reveal a fundamental trade-off between the precision of a trajectory observable and entropy production, where the uncertainty of the observable is quantified by its variance. In information theory, Shannon entropy is a common measure of uncertainty. However, a clear quantitative relationship between the Shannon entropy of an observable and the entropy production in stochastic thermodynamics remains to be established. In this Letter, we show that an uncertainty relation can be formulated in terms of the Shannon entropy of an observable and the entropy production. We introduce symmetry entropy, an entropy measure that quantifies the symmetry of the observable distribution, and demonstrate that a greater asymmetry in the observable distribution requires higher entropy production. Specifically, we establish that the sum of the entropy production and the symmetry entropy cannot be less than $\ln 2$. As a corollary, we also prove that the sum of the entropy production and the Shannon entropy of the observable is no less than $\ln 2$. As an application, we demonstrate our relation in the diffusion decision model, revealing a fundamental trade-off between decision accuracy and entropy production in stochastic decision-making processes.

Title: Multicomponent one-dimensional quantum droplets across the mean-field stability regime
Authors: I. A. Englezos, P. Schmelcher, S. I. Mistakidis
Abstract: The Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) energy correction at the edge of the mean-field stability regime is known to give rise to beyond mean-field structures in a wide variety of systems. In this work, we analytically derive the LHY energy for two-, three- and four-component one-dimensional bosonic short-range interacting mixtures across the mean-field stability regime. For varying intercomponent attraction in the two-component setting, quantitative deviations from the original LHY treatment emerge being imprinted in the droplet saturation density and width. On the other hand, for repulsive interactions an unseen early onset of phase-separation occurs for both homonuclear and heteronuclear mixtures. Closed LHY expressions for the fully-symmetric three- and four-component mixtures, as well as for mixtures comprised of two identical components coupled to a third independent component are provided and found to host a plethora of mixed droplet states. Our results are expected to inspire future investigations in multicomponent systems for unveiling exotic self-bound states of matter and unravel their nonequilibrium quantum dynamics.

Title: Instability of a fluctuating biomimetic membrane driven by an applied uniform DC electric field
Authors: Zongxin Yu, Shuozhen Zhao, Michael J. Miksis, Petia M. Vlahovska
Abstract: The linear stability of a lipid membrane under a DC electric field, applied perpendicularly to the interface, is investigated in the electrokinetic framework, taking into account the dynamics of the Debye layers formed near the membrane. The perturbed charge in the Debye layers redistributes and generates destabilizing Maxwell stress on the membrane, which outweighs the stabilizing contribution from the electrical body force, leading to a net destabilizing effect. The instability is suppressed as the difference in the electrolyte concentration of the solutions separated by the membrane increases, due to a weakened base state electric field near the membrane. This result contrasts with the destabilizing effect predicted using the leaky dielectric model in cases of asymmetric conductivity. We attribute this difference to the varying assumptions about the perturbation amplitude relative to the Debye length, which result in different regimes of validity for the linear stability analysis within these two frameworks.

Title: Analytical solution for the relaxed atomic configuration of twisted bilayer graphene including heterostrain
Authors: Jian Kang, Oskar Vafek
Abstract: Continuum atomic relaxation models for twisted bilayer graphene involve minimization of the sum of intralayer elastic energy and interlayer adhesion energy. The elastic energy favors a rigid twist i.e. no distortion in the twisted honeycomb lattices, while the adhesion energy favors Bernal stacking and breaking the relaxation into triangular AB and BA stacked domains. We compare the results of two relaxation models with the published Bragg interferometry data, finding good agreement with one of the models. We then provide a method for finding a highly accurate approximation to the solution of this model which holds above the twist angle of $\approx0.7^\circ$ and thus covers the first magic angle. We find closed form expressions in the absence, as well as in the presence, of external heterostrain. These expressions are not written as a Taylor series in the ratio of adhesion and elastic energy, because, as we show, the radius of convergence of such a series is too small to access the first magic angle.

Title: Proximity Effects Between the Graphene Quasicrystal and Magic-Angle Twisted Bilayer Graphene
Authors: Pedro Alcázar Guerrero, Viet-Hung Nguyen, Aron W. Cummings, Jean-Christophe Charlier, Stephan Roche
Abstract: We present a numerical study of three-layer graphene heterostructures in which the layers are twisted by the magic angle ($\sim$1.1$^\circ$) or by $\sim$$30^\circ$ to form a graphene quasicrystal. The heterostacks are described using realistic structural relaxations and tight-binding Hamiltonians, and their transport properties are computed for both pristine and disordered systems containing up to $\sim$8 million atoms. Owing to the weak interlayer coupling, we resolve the hybridization between magic-angle flat bands and quasicrystalline states, which are modified in distinct ways across low- and high-energy windows, revealing a new hybrid electronic regime to explore.

Title: Universal whirling magnetic orders in non-Heisenberg Tsai-type quasicrystal approximants
Authors: Farid Labib, Kazuhiro Nawa, Yusuke Nambu, Hiroyuki Takakura, Yoichi Ikeda, Kazuhiko Deguchi, Masato Matsuura, Asuka Ishikawa, Ryoichi Kajimoto, Kazuhiko Ikeuchi, Taku J. Sato, Ryuji Tamura
Abstract: Magnetic orders of non-Heisenberg Tsai-type 1/1 approximant crystals (ACs) in the Au-Ga-Dy system were studied through bulk magnetization, neutron diffraction, and inelastic neutron scattering techniques. The results uncovered noncoplanar, ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin configurations whirling along [111] crystallographic axis, which is analogous to those observed in the Tb- and Ho-contained counterparts. The crystal electric field excitations similar to those in the Tb-based counterpart are also observed indicating the strong Ising-like magnetic anisotropy. These comprehensive experiments and analyses have revealed the existence of a universal mechanism that stabilizes noncoplanar FM and AFM structures in non-Heisenberg Tsai-type ACs, independent of the rare-earth species (Tb, Dy, Ho); FM intra-cluster interactions and strong Ising-like anisotropy.

Title: Neutral but Impactful: Gallium Cluster-Induced Nanopores from Beam-Blanked Gallium Ion Sources
Authors: Dana O. Byrne, Stephanie M. Ribet, Karen C. Bustillo, Colin Ophus, Frances I. Allen
Abstract: Neutral atoms emitted from liquid metal ion sources are an often-overlooked source of contamination and damage in focused ion beam microscopy. Beyond ions and single atoms, these sources also emit atom clusters. While most studies have investigated charged clusters, here we demonstrate that neutral clusters are also emitted. These neutral clusters bypass the electrostatic beam blanking system, allowing them to impinge on samples even when the ion beam is blanked. We investigate this phenomenon using thin (<20 nm) freestanding membranes of hexagonal boron nitride, silicon, and silicon nitride as targets. Randomly dispersed nanopores that form upon neutral cluster exposure are revealed. The average nanopore diameter is ~2 nm with a narrow size distribution, suggesting that the atom clusters emitted from the source have a preferred size. Various electron microscopy techniques are used to characterize the nanopores, including high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, multislice ptychography, and electron energy-loss spectroscopy. Finally, we show how electron irradiation in the transmission electron microscope can be used to both remove any amorphous material that may clog the pores and to controllably grow the pores to specific sizes. Tunable nanopores such as these are interesting for nanofluidic applications involving size-selective membranes.

Title: Driven-dissipative turbulence in exciton-polariton quantum fluids
Authors: R. Ferrini, S.V. Koniakhin
Abstract: The present paper is devoted to comprehensive theoretical studies of exction-polariton quantum fluids specificities in the optics of their utilization for quantum turbulence research. We show that a non-trivial implementation of time-varying potential for excitation of quantum fluid (injection of quantized vortices) via the stirring procedure can be efficiently substituted with resonant excitation-based phase-imprinting techniques. The most efficient phase pattern corresponds to imprinting of tiles with randomly oriented plane waves in each. The resulting turbulent flows, spatial vortex distributions, and clustering statistics resemble those for the case of a conventional spoon-stirring scheme. We quantify the limitations on the lifetime and density depletion for the development and sustainability of quantum turbulence. The yield is the necessity to prevent the density depletion for more than one order of magnitude. Finally, we demonstrate that turbulence is robust with respect to alternating gain and loss at a certain range of modulation parameters, which corresponds to laser operating above and below condensation threshold.

Title: Variational Diagrammatic Monte-Carlo Built on Dynamical Mean-Field Theory
Authors: Yueyi Wang, Kristjan Haule
Abstract: We develop a variational perturbation expansion around dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) that systematically incorporates nonlocal correlations beyond the local correlations treated by DMFT. We apply this approach to investigate how the DMFT critical temperature is suppressed from its mean-field value and how the critical behavior near the finite-temperature phase transition evolves from the mean-field to the Heisenberg universality class. By identifying the symmetry breaking of paramagnetic diagrammatic expansions as a signature of the Néel transition, we accurately predict the Néel temperature of the three-dimensional cubic Hubbard model across all interaction strengths with low computational cost. Introducing a variational order parameter, our method can be applied to both paramagnetic and long-range ordered states, such as antiferromagnetic order. We compute magnetization and antiferromagnetic susceptibility, demonstrating minor corrections to DMFT solutions in the weak-coupling regime while revealing significant modifications to these properties in the intermediate correlation regime. From the analysis of critical exponents, we establish the emergence of Heisenberg critical behavior beyond the mean-field nature of DMFT.

Title: From Light-Cone to Supersonic Propagation of Correlations by Competing Short- and Long-Range Couplings
Authors: Catalin-Mihai Halati, Ameneh Sheikhan, Giovanna Morigi, Corinna Kollath, Simon B. Jäger
Abstract: We investigate the dynamical spreading of correlations in many-body quantum systems with competing short- and global-range couplings. We monitor the non-equilibrium dynamics of the correlations following a quench, showing that for strong short-range couplings the propagation of correlations is dominated at short and intermediate distances by a causal, light-cone, dynamics, resembling the purely short-range quantum systems. However, the interplay of short- and global-range couplings leads to a crossover between space-time regions in which the light-cone persists to regions where a supersonic, distance-independent, spreading of the correlations occurs. We identify the important ingredients needed for capturing the supersonic spreading and demonstrate our findings in systems of interacting bosonic atoms, in which the global range coupling is realized by a coupling to a cavity light field, or atomic long-range interactions, respectively. We show that our results hold in both one and two dimensions and in the presence of dissipation. Furthermore, we characterize the short time power-law scaling of the distance-independent growth of the density-density correlations.

Title: Possible Observation of Quadrupole Waves in Spin Nematics

Abstract: Discovery of new states of matter is a key objective in modern condensed matter physics, which often leads to revolutionary technological advancements such as superconductivity. Quantum spin nematic, a ``hidden order'' that evades conventional magnetic probes, is one such state. Na$_2$BaNi(PO$_4$)$_2$ is a potential spin nematic material, suggested by the observation of a two-magnon Bose-Einstein condensation from above the saturation field. However, direct confirmation of the spin nematicity remains elusive. This Letter presents inelastic neutron scattering spectra from the putative spin nematic phases of Na$_2$BaNi(PO$_4$)$_2$, revealing low-energy quadrupole waves that are absent in the neighboring conventional magnetic phases. A spin-one model quantitatively captures the full details of the spin excitation spectra across all low-temperature phases, providing direct evidence of the spin nematic orders. Additionally, we show evidence of the three-magnon continuum and two-magnon bound states in the $1/3$-magnetization plateau, revealing condensation of the two-magnon bound state as the origin of the low-field spin nematic supersolid phase.

Title: Skyrmionic Transport and First Order Phase Transitions in Twisted Bilayer Graphene Quantum Hall Ferromagnet
Authors: Vineet Pandey, Prasenjit Ghosh, Riju Pal, Sourav Paul, Abhijith M B, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Atindra Nath Pal, Vidya Kochat
Abstract: Large-angle twisted bilayer graphene (TBLG) realizes a multicomponent quantum Hall (QH) platform of spin, valley and layer pseudospins with strong Coulomb interaction-driven symmetry broken phases. Here, we investigate the low energy Landau-level spectrum of layer-decoupled TBLG and identify skyrmion-textured charged excitations and a field-induced insulating transition to an intervalley coherent state at zero-filling factor. Symmetric potential difference perpendicular to TBLG demonstrated layer coherent population of ground states with uniform energy barriers, while the charge imbalance in the layers at finite displacement field led to multidomain nucleation and a pronounced hysteresis in the exchange-dominated transport regime suggesting first order phase transitions between different QH ferromagnetic ground states.

Title: Shot noise signatures of candidate states for the fractional quantum Hall $ν= 12/5$ state
Authors: Goutham Vinjamuri, Ankur Das
Abstract: Fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states are highly sought after because of their ability to host non-abelian anyons, whose braiding statistics make them excellent candidates for qubits in topological quantum computing. Multiple theoretical studies on the $\nu=\frac{12}{5}$ FQH state predict various quasi-particle states hosted by the $\frac{12}{5}$ plateau, which include $\mathbb Z_3$ parafermions and Majorana modes. In this work, we provide a systematic protocol to distinguish among four possible candidate wavefunctions of the $\frac{12}{5}$ plateau using zero-frequency shot noise experiments on a filter-geometry. Qualitative comparisons of Fano-Factors provide a robust way to predict the candidate state across both the full and partial thermal equilibration regimes without prior knowledge of the experimental information, like thermal equilibration length, to allow for more realistic experiments.

Title: Quantum effects in rotationally invariant spin glass models
Authors: Yoshinori Hara, Yoshiyuki Kabashima
Abstract: This study investigates the quantum effects in transverse-field Ising spin glass models with rotationally invariant random interactions. The primary aim is to evaluate the validity of a quasi-static approximation that captures the imaginary-time dependence of the order parameters beyond the conventional static approximation. Using the replica method combined with the Suzuki--Trotter decomposition, we established a stability condition for the replica symmetric solution, which is analogous to the de Almeida--Thouless criterion. Numerical analysis of the Sherrington--Kirkpatrick model estimates a value of the critical transverse field, $\Gamma_\mathrm{c}$, which agrees with previous Monte Carlo-based estimations. For the Hopfield model, it provides an estimate of $\Gamma_\mathrm{c}$, which has not been previously evaluated. For the random orthogonal model, our analysis suggests that quantum effects alter the random first-order transition scenario in the low-temperature limit. This study supports a quasi-static treatment for analyzing quantum spin glasses and may offer useful insights into the analysis of quantum optimization algorithms.

Title: Universal Bound States with Bose-Fermi Duality in Microwave-Shielded Polar Molecules
Authors: Tingting Shi, Haitian Wang, Xiaoling Cui
Abstract: We report universal bound states of microwave-shielded ultracold molecules that solely depend on the strengths of long-range dipolar interaction and microwave coupling. Under a highly elliptic microwave field, few-molecule scatterings in three dimension are shown to be governed by effective one-dimensional (1D) models, which well reproduce the tetratomic bound state and the Born-Oppenheimer potential in three-molecule sector. For hexatomic systems comprising three identical molecules, we find much deeper bound state than the tetratomic one, with binding energy exceeding twice of the latter. Strikingly, these bound states display Bose-Fermi duality as facilitated by the effective 1D scattering with a large repulsive core from angular fluctuations. For large molecule ensembles, our results suggest the formation of elongated self-bound droplets with crystalline patterns in both bosonic and fermionic molecules.

Title: Effect of interatomic repulsion and quasi-degenerate states on a Kitaev-transmon qubit based on double quantum dots
Authors: Clara Palacios, Armando A. Aligia
Abstract: We investigate the effect of interatomic Coulomb repulsion $V$ and particular states disregarded previously on the Kitaev-transmon system proposed by Pino \textit{et al.} \cite{pino} which consists of a Josephson junction between two double quantum dots (DQDs) modeled by the spinless Kitaev Hamiltonian. For an isolated DQD, we demonstrate that a ``sweet spot'' hosting ``poor man's Majorana'' states persist in the presence of $V$, provided that system parameters are appropriately tuned. For the full system, we demonstrate that at the sweet spots of both DQDs, all eigenstates are doubly degenerate. This degeneracy arises from the existence of an operator that maps between two decoupled Hilbert subspaces. Away from the sweet spots, the microwave spectrum becomes sensitive to the choice of initial state. In our study, we consider transitions from the ground state (which depending on the flux alternates between the above mentioned subspaces) to all possible excited states. This scenario corresponds to a system initially in thermal equilibrium at low temperature.

Title: Spectrum Selective Interfaces and Materials towards Non-photothermal Saltwater Evaporation: Demonstration with a White Ceramic Wick
Authors: Navindra D. Singh, James Leung, Ji Feng, Alma K. González-Alcalde, Arial Tolentino, David Tuft, Juchen Guo, Luat T. Vuong
Abstract: Most solar desalination efforts are photothermal: they evaporate water with ``black'' materials that absorb as much sunlight as possible. Such ``brine-boiling'' methods are limited by the high thermal mass of water, i.e., its capacity to store and release heat. Here, we study the light-enhanced evaporation by a hard, white, aluminum nitride wick, and propose a route to selectively target salt-water bonds instead of bulk heating via deep-UV interactions. Through experiments and analyses that isolate the effects of light absorption and heating in aluminum nitride, we provide experimental evidence of a light-driven, spectrum-selective path to non-photothermal saltwater evaporation. Leverage of these light-matter interactions in white ceramic wicks may achieve low-cost, low-energy desalination, reduce the heat island effects of traditional solar technologies, and contribute to future cooling technologies where drought is also a concern.

Title: Topological Mixed States: Phases of Matter from Axiomatic Approaches
Authors: Tai-Hsuan Yang, Bowen Shi, Jong Yeon Lee
Abstract: For closed quantum systems, topological orders are understood through the equivalence classes of ground states of gapped local Hamiltonians. The generalization of this conceptual paradigm to open quantum systems, however, remains elusive, often relying on operational definitions without fundamental principles. Here, we fill this gap by proposing an approach based on three axioms: ($i$) local recoverability, ($ii$) absence of long-range correlations, and ($iii$) spatial uniformity. States that satisfy these axioms are fixed points; requiring the axioms only after coarse-graining promotes each fixed point to an equivalence class, i.e., a phase, presenting the first step towards the axiomatic classification of mixed-state phases of matter: mixed-state bootstrap program. From these axioms, a rich set of topological data naturally emerges; importantly, these data are robust under relaxation of axioms. For example, each topological mixed state supports locally indistinguishable classical and/or quantum logical memories with distinct responses to topological operations. These data label distinct mixed-state phases, allowing one to distinguish them. We further uncover a hierarchy of secret-sharing constraints: in non-Abelian phases, reliable recovery-even of information that looks purely classical-demands a specific coordination among spatial subregions, a requirement different across non-Abelian classes. This originates from non-Abelian fusion rules that can stay robust under decoherence. Finally, we performed large-scale numerical simulations to corroborate stability: weakly decohered fixed points respect the axioms once coarse-grained. These results lay the foundation for a systematic classification of topological states in open quantum systems.

Title: Direct Synthesis of Metal Hydrides from Metal and Acids
Authors: Ankang Chen, Zihao Huo, Jiewen Liu, Chuang Liu, Yongming Sui, Xuan Liu, Qingkun Yuan, Yan Li, Guangtong Wang, Bao Yuan, Defang Duan, Gang Liu, Bo Zou
Abstract: Reactive metals generally undergo hydrogen evolution rather than forming direct hydrides when reacting with acids. However, an alternative pathway that involves the direct insertion of atomic hydrogen into the metal lattice, analogous to hydrogen embrittlement (HE), can induce extreme localized stresses on the order of gigapascals (GPa). This mechanochemical process significantly promotes the formation of metal hydrides under high-stress conditions. Inspired by this mechanism, we synthesized at least 19 high-purity metal hydrides, including MgH2, ScH2, YH2, LaH2, LaH2.3, CeH2, SmH2, LuH2, TiH2, ZrH1.6, ZrH2, HfH1.7, HfH2, VH0.8, VH2, NbH, NbH2, Ta2H, and TaH, using bulk metal foils and sulfuric or oleic acid as hydrogen sources. Through high-pressure technique conducted at the GPa level using a diamond anvil cell (DAC), we introduce the pressure concepts Delta-Ph and Delta-Peq to elucidate the synthesis and stabilization mechanisms. Quantitative analysis across all 19 hydrides reveals that the criterion abs(Delta-Peq) greater than Delta-Pph is essential for successful acid-mediated hydride formation; conversely, when abs(Delta-Peq) less than Delta-Pph, hydrogen-induced brittle fracture occurs. This principle not only enables the synthesis of challenging hydrides such as LiH, but also explains failure mechanisms in metals like Fe. Ultimately, this work repurposes HE from a failure mechanism into a controlled tool for hydride synthesis.

Title: Load-Dependent Power-Law Exponent in Creep Rupture of Heterogeneous Materials
Authors: Chloé Braux, Antoine Bérut, Loïc Vanel
Abstract: Creep tests on heterogeneous materials under subcritical loading typically show a power-law decaying strain rate before failure, with the exponent often considered material-dependent but independent of applied stress. By imposing successive small stress relaxations through a displacement feedback loop, we probe creep dynamics and show experimentally that this exponent varies with both applied load and loading direction. Simulations of a disordered fiber bundle model reproduce this load dependence, demonstrating that such models capture essential features of delayed rupture dynamics.

Title: Three-dimensional topological orbital Hall effect caused by magnetic hopfions
Authors: Börge Göbel, Samir Lounis
Abstract: Magnetic hopfions are non-collinear spin textures that are characterized by an integer topological invariant, called Hopf index. The three-dimensional magnetic solitons can be thought of as a tube with a twisted magnetization that has been closed at both ends to form a torus. The tube consists of a magnetic whirl called in-plane skyrmion or bimeron. Although hopfions have been observed by microscopy techniques, their detection remains challenging as they lack an electronic hallmark so far. Here we predict a three-dimensional orbital Hall effect caused by hopfion textures: When an electric field is applied, the hopfion generates a transverse current of orbital angular momentum. The effect arises due to the local emergent field that gives rise to in-plane and out-of-plane orbital Hall conductivities. This orbital Hall response can be seen as a hallmark of hopfions and allows us to distinguish them from other textures, like skyrmioniums, that look similar in real-space microscopy experiments. While the two-dimensional topological invariant of a skyrmion determines its topological Hall transport, the unique three-dimensional topological orbital Hall effect can be identified with the three-dimensional topological invariant that is the Hopf index. Our results make hopfions attractive for spin-orbitronic applications because their orbital signatures allow for their detection in devices and give rise to large orbital torques.

Title: Controlling energy delivery with bistable nanostructures
Authors: Andreas Ehrmann, Carl P. Goodrich
Abstract: Countless biological processes are fueled by energy-rich molecules like ATP and GTP that supply energy with extreme efficiency. However, designing similar energy-delivery schemes from the bottom up, essential for the development of powered nanostructures and other {\it de novo} machinery, presents a significant challenge: how can an energy-rich structure be stable in solution yet still deliver this energy at precisely the right time? In this paper, we present a purely physical mechanism that solves this challenge, facilitating energy transfer akin to ATP hydrolysis, yet occurring between synthetic nanostructures without any biochemical interactions. This targeted energy delivery is achieved by exploiting a differentiable state-based model to balance the energy profiles that govern the structural transitions in the two nanostructures, creating a combined relaxation pathway with minimal barriers that facilitates energy delivery. We verify the effectiveness and robustness of this mechanism through Molecular Dynamics simulations, demonstrating that a bath of the high-energy structures can systematically and repeatedly drive the target structure out of equilibrium, enabling it to perform tasks. As the mechanism operates only through explicit physical forces without any biochemistry or internal state variables, our results present generic and far-reaching design principles, setting the stage for the next generation of synthetic nanomachines.

Title: Rabi-induced localization and resonant delocalization of a binary condensate in a spin-asymmetric quasiperiodic potential
Authors: Swarup K. Sarkar, Sh. Mardonov, E. Ya. Sherman, Pankaj K. Mishra
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the ground state and dynamics of a Rabi-coupled pseudospin-1/2 Bose-Einstein condensate, where only one spin component is subjected to an external potential. We show that in the quasiperiodic potential the Rabi coupling induces localization between the components as it is raised above the threshold value. Interestingly, the localization is mutually induced by both components for the quasiperiodic confinement, whereas for a harmonic trap the localization is induced in the potential-free component by interaction with that confined in the potential. Further, we explore the condensate dynamics by implementing a periodic driving of the Rabi frequency, where various frequency-dependent delocalization patterns, such as double (triple)-minima, tree-(parquet)-like, and frozen distributions with a correlated propagation of different spin populations are observed in the condensate density. These features pave the way to control the condensate mass and spin density patterns, both in the stationary and dynamical realizations.

Title: Vortex structure and intervortex interaction in superconducting structures with intrinsic diode effect
Authors: A. V. Putilov, D. V. Zakharov, A. Kudlis, A. S. Mel'nikov, A. I. Buzdin
Abstract: We demonstrate that the intrinsic superconducting diode effect can affect the structure, interactions and dynamics of Abrikosov vortices in non-centrosymmetric superconductor/ferromagnet hybrid structures. The Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory accounting for the spin-orbit and exchange-field effects predicts a chiral distortion of the superfluid velocity, non-central interaction forces and resulting torque in a vortex-antivortex pair, and anisotropy of the Bean-Livingston barrier. These closed-form results are fully confirmed by time-dependent GL numerical simulations carried out with a fourth-order least-squares finite-difference solver, which captures equilibrium single vortex configuration in realistic mesoscopic geometries. The analysis shows that the cubic gradient term shifts vortex cores by an amount proportional to the in-plane exchange field and simultaneously generates a lateral torque that can rotate entire vortex ensembles, showing how spin-orbit coupling and the exchange field enable breakdown of the vortex-antivortex symmetry in a finite-size sample. By combining transparent analytics with quantitative numerics, the work provides the hallmarks of vortex physics in superconducting structures with an intrinsic diode effect and supplies concrete guidelines for designing non-reciprocal superconducting circuits, fluxonic logic elements, and kinetic-inductance devices.

Title: Synthesis and transport properties of epitaxial Bi (111) films on GaAs (111) substrates
Authors: Jagannath Jena, Eugene D. Ark, Siddhesh Ambhire, Michael D. Smith, Justin S. Wood, Junyi Yang, John Pearson, Hanu Arava, Daniel Rosenmann, Ulrich Welp, Jidong S. Jiang, Deshun Hong, Ivar Martin, Steven S.-L. Zhang, Anand Bhattacharya
Abstract: In recent decades, the growth of ultrathin epitaxial bismuth (Bi) films on various substrates has garnered interest due to their unique electronic properties. We report upon the growth and electrical transport properties of epitaxial Bi (111) films in the thickness range of 5-32 nm deposited directly on GaAs (111) substrates, without a buffer layer. The quality of Bi films is found to depend on conditions for substrate treatment using Ar+ ion-milling and annealing. Substrates milled at low ion beam currents display poor surface reconstruction after annealing, which hinders the growth of high-quality films. In contrast, substrates milled under optimized conditions led to reconstructed surfaces upon annealing, resulting in epitaxial Bi films with predominantly single-domain orientation. Although epitaxial films formed in both cases, transport measurements indicated significantly higher conductivity for films grown on optimally treated substrates. Measurements at low temperatures suggest that the transport properties are dominated by a surface state with high mobility electrons. Magneto-transport measurements suggest that conductivity and mobility improve progressively with increasing film thickness. For the thinnest 5 nm film, a hole-like state emerges, presumably as the electron-like state is gapped out. These results provide a robust methodology for growing high-quality epitaxial Bi films on GaAs (111) and offer insights into their unique transport properties, and our ability to tune them.

Title: Thermodynamic bounds and symmetries in first-passage problems of fluctuating currents
Authors: Adarsh Raghu, Izaak Neri
Abstract: We develop a method for deriving thermodynamic bounds for first-passage problems of currents with two boundaries in Markov chains. Using this method, we derive a thermodynamic bound on the rate of dissipation in terms of the splitting probability and the first-passage time statistics of a fluctuating current, which is a refinement of a previously derived inequality. We also show that the concept of effective affinity, originally developed for continuous-time Markov chains, naturally extends to discrete-time Markov chains. Furthermore, we analyse symmetries in first-passage problems of fluctuating currents with two boundaries. We show that optimal currents -- those for which the effective affinity fully accounts for the dissipation -- satisfy a symmetry property: the current's average speed to reach the positive threshold equals the current's speed to reach the negative threshold. The developed approach uses a coarse-graining procedure for the average entropy production at random times and uses martingale methods to perform time-reversal of first-passage quantities.

Title: Absence of nontrivial local conserved quantities in the Hubbard model on the two or higher dimensional hypercubic lattice
Authors: Mahiro Futami
Abstract: By extending the strategy developed by Shiraishi in 2019, we prove that the standard Hubbard model on the $d$-dimensional hypercubic lattice with $d\ge2$ does not admit any nontrivial local conserved quantities. The theorem strongly suggests that the model is non-integrable. To our knowledge, this is the first extension of Shiraishi's proof of the absence of conserved quantities to a fermionic model. Although our proof follows the original strategy of Shiraishi, it is essentially more subtle compared with the proof by Shiraishi and Tasaki of the corresponding theorem for $S=\tfrac12$ quantum spin systems in two or higher dimensions; our proof requires three steps, while that of Shiraishi and Tasaki requires only two steps. It is also necessary to partially determine the conserved quantities of the one-dimensional Hubbard model to accomplish our proof.

Title: Monopole Traps for Position-Based Information Coding
Authors: Prakash Timsina, Andres Chappa, Deema Alyones, Boris Kiefer, Ludi Miao
Abstract: We propose a spin-ice-based heterostructure capable of encoding magnetic monopole quasiparticle positions for non-volatile information storage applications. Building upon two-dimensional magnetic monopole gases formed at the interface between 2-in-2-out spin ice and all-in-all-out antiferromagnetic pyrochlore iridate, the design introduces a 3-in-1-out/1-in-3-out fragmented barrier layer into the spin-ice matrix, defining two energetically stable monopole traps. The occupancy of these traps can be deterministically controlled by an externally applied magnetic field. Monte Carlo simulations reveal robust bistable switching, thermal stability below 0.22 K, and fully reversible field-driven transitions, demonstrating the system's potential for reliable, repeatable memory operation. Crucially, the heterostructure exhibits emergent ferromagnetism linked to monopole position, enabling non-destructive readout of the memory state via spatially resolved magnetic imaging. Unlike topological carriers such as skyrmions, monopoles confined at the sub-nanometer scale offer three orders of magnitude higher information density. These results establish these monopole-trap heterostructures as a scalable platform for next-generation ultra-compact memory technologies.

Title: Explicit equivalence between the spectral localizer and local Chern and winding markers
Authors: Lucien Jezequel, Jens H. Bardarson, Adolfo G. Grushin
Abstract: Topological band insulators are classified using momentum-space topological invariants, such as Chern or winding numbers, when they feature translational symmetry. The lack of translation symmetry in disordered, quasicrystalline, or amorphous topological systems has motivated alternative, real-space definitions of topological invariants, including the local Chern marker and the spectral localizer invariant. However, the equivalence between these invariants is so far implicit. Here, we explicitly demonstrate their equivalence from a systematic perturbative expansion in powers of the spectral localizer's parameter $\kappa$. By leveraging only the Clifford algebra of the spectral localizer, we prove that Chern and winding markers emerge as leading-order terms in the expansion. It bypasses abstract topological machinery, offering a simple approach accessible to a broader physics audience.

Title: A microscopically reversible kinetic theory of flocking
Authors: Ruben Lier
Abstract: We formulate a kinetic theory of two species of hard spheres which can undergo collisions converting chemical energy into kinetic energy. As the two species represent birds and air, this reactive collision mimics birds flapping their wings, allowing for their propulsion. We demand microscopic reversibility of the reactive collisions. We then introduce a chemostat to drive the system out of equilibrium. When the chemostat is sufficiently turned on and one restricts to grazing interspecies collisions, the momentum damping term can turn into a momentum growth term, hinting at a flocking transition.

Title: Phase engineering of 1T$'$ and 1T CrS2 and Cr2S3 by MOCVD

Abstract: Layered Cr-chalcogenides compounds offer a rich range of crystal phases with different magnetic properties some of which have been predicted only but not experimentally verified. Here we demonstrate a previously unreported crystal phase of CrS2, namely the distorted octahedral (1T$'$) structure, synthesized via metal-organic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD). We achieved the tuneable synthesis of either 1T$'$ or 1T phase CrS2. The structure were identified using polarized Raman spectroscopy, density functional perturbation theory (DFPT), as well as scanning electron diffraction (4D-STEM). 4D-STEM reveals that 1T$'$ crystals grow from an originally nucleated kinetically favoured 1T phase which then transform into the thermodynamically stable 1T$'$ phase. Magneto-optic Kerr imaging reveals that the 1T$'$ CrS2 crystals have soft ferromagnetic nature at low temperature. Our MOCVD growth of complex phases of 2D CrS2 with long-range magnetic order paves the way for the scalable synthesis of 2D magnets for ultrathin magnetic memories for logic-in-memory applications and spintronics.

Title: Supervised and Unsupervised Deep Learning Applied to the Majority Vote Model
Authors: J. F. Silva Neto, D. S. M. Alencar, L. T. Brito, G. A. Alves, F. W. S. Lima, A. Macedo-Filho, R. S. Ferreira, T. F. A. Alves
Abstract: We employ deep learning techniques to investigate the critical properties of the continuous phase transition in the majority vote model. In addition to deep learning, principal component analysis is utilized to analyze the transition. For supervised learning, dense neural networks are trained on spin configuration data generated via the kinetic Monte Carlo method. Using independently simulated configuration data, the neural network accurately identifies the critical point on both square and triangular lattices. Classical unsupervised learning with principal component analysis reproduces the magnetization and enables estimation of critical exponents, typically obtained via Monte Carlo importance sampling. Furthermore, deep unsupervised learning is performed using variational autoencoders, which reconstruct input spin configurations and generate artificial outputs. The autoencoders detect the phase transition through the loss function, quantifying the preservation of essential data features. We define a correlation function between the real and reconstructed data, and find that this correlation function is universal at the critical point. Variational autoencoders also serve as generative models, producing artificial spin configurations.

Abstract: We report observations of Higgs modes in superconducting Titanium nanostructures at very low temperature. They appear as anomalies in the microwave complex impedance of the samples revealed by the presence of a dc supercurrent. By varying the sample geometry and contact material, we probe how the Higgs modes are sensitive to the dimensionality of superconductivity, the penetration of the dc and ac current densities in the sample and the dissipation in the contacts.

Title: Non-ohmic to ohmic crossover in the breakdown of the quantum Hall states in graphene under broadband excitations
Authors: Torsten Röper, Aifei Zhang, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Olivier Maillet, François D. Parmentier, Erwann Bocquillon
Abstract: Graphene, through the coexistence of large cyclotron gaps and small spin and valley gaps, offers the possibility to study the breakdown of the quantum Hall effect across a wide range of energy scales. In this work, we investigate the breakdown of the QHE in high-mobility graphene Corbino devices under broadband excitation ranging from DC up to 10 GHz. We find that the conductance is consistently described by variable range hopping (VRH) and extract the hopping energies from both temperature and field-driven measurements. Using VRH thermometry, we are able to distinguish between a cold and hot electron regime, which are dominated by non-ohmic VRH and Joule heating, respectively. Our results demonstrate that breakdown in the quantum Hall regime of graphene is governed by a crossover from non-ohmic, field-driven VRH to ohmic, Joule-heating-dominated transport.

Title: Defect mediated quantum melting of charge ordered insulators
Authors: Abijith Krishnan, Ajesh Kumar, T. Senthil
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2d) electronic systems on a lattice at fractional filling $\nu = p/q$ exhibit a competition between charge ordered insulators, called Wigner-Mott insulators (WMIs), at large Coulomb repulsion and Fermi-liquid metals at large electronic kinetic energy. When those two energy scales are roughly equal, insulating states that restore the lattice translation symmetry, which we call quantum charge liquids (QCLs), may emerge. When gapped, these QCLs must exhibit topological order. In this work, we show that the allowed topological ordered phases that are proximate to the WMI strongly depend on the charge ordering in the WMI. In particular, we show that when $q$ is even, no direct transition exists between a WMI with the smallest allowed unit cell size from filling constraints, i.e., the "minimal" WMI, and the topological order with the smallest ground state degeneracy on a torus allowed by filling constraints, i.e., the "minimal" TO. Furthermore, we describe the quantum melting transition of the WMIs to the proximate QCLs in terms of the proliferation of the topological defects of the WMIs. The field theory of this transition in terms of the topological defects reveals their role as precursors to the anyon excitations in the QCLs.

Title: Determining the density of in-gap states in organic semiconductors: A pitfall of photoelectron yield spectroscopy
Authors: Ryotaro Nakazawa, Masaya Kitaoka, Ryota Kaimori, Manato Tateno, Runa Hoshikawa, Yuya Tanaka, Hisao Ishii
Abstract: Accurate determination of low-density electronic states in the bandgap (in-gap states) is crucial for optimizing the performance of organic optoelectronic devices. Derivative photoelectron yield spectroscopy (PYS) is employed to estimate the density of states (DOS) of in-gap states. However, low-energy photons in PYS can generate excitons and anions in organic semiconductors, raising questions about whether derivative PYS spectra truly represent the DOS. We revealed that PYS signals originate from the single-quantum external photoelectron effect (SQEPE) of in-gap states, SQEPE of the singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO) of anions, and the biphotonic electron emission (BEE) effect via exciton fusion. Because BEE signals mask the DOS contribution, derivative PYS misestimates the DOS of in-gap states. In contrast, constant final state yield spectroscopy (CFS-YS) reliably determines the DOS by separating these components. For a tris(8-hydroxyquinoline) aluminum (Alq3) film, CFS-YS revealed the DOS of in-gap and SOMO states over six orders of magnitude, clarifying why the Alq3 layer works effectively in organic light-emitting diodes. In the devices, BEE can act as carrier-generation and degradation processes, and CFS-YS can also probe it. We provide the practical guidelines of low-energy photon measurements for DOS determination, such as measurements of photon-flux dependency.

Title: Fate of entanglement in open quantum spin liquid: Time evolution of its genuine multipartite negativity upon sudden coupling to a dissipative bosonic environment
Authors: Federico Garcia-Gaitan, Branislav K. Nikolic
Abstract: Topological properties of many-body entanglement in quantum spin liquids (QSLs), persisting at arbitrarily long distances, have been intensely explored over the past two decades, but mostly for QSLs viewed as {\em closed} quantum systems. However, in experiments and potential quantum computing applications, candidate materials for this exotic phase of quantum matter will always interact with a dissipative environment, such as the one generated by bosonic quasiparticles in solids at finite temperature. Here we investigate the spatial structure and stability of entanglement in the Kitaev model of QSL made {\em open} by sudden coupling to an infinite bosonic bath of Caldeira-Leggett type and time-evolved using the Lindblad quantum master equation in the Markovian regime (i.e., for weak coupling) or tensor network methods for open quantum systems in the non-Markovian regime (i.e., for strong coupling). From the time-evolved density matrix of QSL and its subregions, we extract genuine multipartite negativity (GMN), quantum Fisher information, spin-spin correlators, and expectation value (EV) of the Wilson loop operator. In particular, time-dependence of GMN offers the most penetrating insights: (i) in the Markovian regime, it remains non-zero in larger loopy subregions of QSL (as also discovered very recently for closed QSLs) up to temperatures comparable to Kitaev exchange interaction at which other quantities, such as EV of the Wilson loop operator, vanish; (ii) in the non-Markovian regime with pronounced memory effects, GMN remains non-zero up to even higher temperatures, while also acquiring non-zero value in smaller non-loopy subregions. The non-Markovian dynamics can also generate emergent interactions between spins, thereby opening avenues for tailoring properties of QSL via environmental engineering.

Abstract: Surface oxides are associated with two-level systems (TLSs) that degrade the performance of niobium-based superconducting quantum computing devices. To address this, we introduce a predictive framework for selecting metal capping layers that inhibit niobium oxide formation. Using DFT-calculated oxygen interstitial and vacancy energies as thermodynamic descriptors, we train a logistic regression model on a limited set of experimental outcomes to successfully predict the likelihood of oxide formation beneath different capping materials. This approach identifies Zr, Hf, and Ta as effective diffusion barriers. Our analysis further reveals that the oxide formation energy per oxygen atom serves as an excellent standalone descriptor for predicting barrier performance. By combining this new descriptor with lattice mismatch as a secondary criterion to promote structurally coherent interfaces, we identify Zr, Ta, and Sc as especially promising candidates. This closed-loop strategy integrates first-principles theory, machine learning, and limited experimental data to enable rational design of next-generation materials.

Title: A physics-informed neural network approach to the point defect model for electrochemical oxide film growth
Authors: Mohid Farooqi, Ingmar Bösing, Conrard G. Tetsassi Feugmo
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) offer a novel AI-driven framework for integrating physical laws directly into neural network models, facilitating the solution of complex multiphysics problems in materials engineering. This study systematically explores the application of PINNs to simulate oxide film layer growth in halide-free solutions using the point defect model (PDM). We identify and analyze four key failure modes in this context: imbalanced loss components across different physical processes, numerical instabilities due to variable scale disparities, challenges in enforcing boundary conditions within multiphysics systems, and convergence to mathematically valid but physically meaningless solutions. To overcome these challenges, we implement and validate established techniques including nondimensionalization for training stabilization, Neural Tangent Kernel-based adaptive loss balancing, robust enforcement of boundary conditions and hybrid training with sparse data. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of these strategies in enhancing the reliability and physical fidelity of PINNs, achieving sub $1\%$ relative error as compared to Finite Element Benchmarks with the hybrid model. Thereby showing that PINNs can be used for high fidelity electrochemical simulations with minimal data requirements and highlight necesary factors for fully autonomous PINN simulations.

Title: Autonomous interpretation of atomistic scattering data
Authors: Andy S. Anker, John L. A. Gardner, Louise A. M. Rosset, Andrew L. Goodwin, Volker L. Deringer
Abstract: Materials with bespoke properties have long been identified by computational searches, and their experimental realisation is now coming within reach through autonomous laboratories. Scattering experiments are central to verifying the atomic structures of autonomously synthesised materials. Yet, interpreting these measurements typically requires user expertise and manual processing, or machine learning (ML) models trained on predefined datasets, limiting fully autonomous materials discovery. Here, we introduce a differentiable optimisation framework that treats scattering calculations, energetics, and chemical constraints as a unified refinement problem. Capability demonstrations across molecules, crystal structures, nanoparticles, and amorphous matter show that this data-driven approach resolves structural degeneracies with multi-modal inputs - suggesting its usefulness for informing, and ultimately guiding, the operation of autonomous laboratories.

Title: Stochastic Interpolants: A Unifying Framework for Flows and Diffusions
Authors: Michael S. Albergo, Nicholas M. Boffi, Eric Vanden-Eijnden
Abstract: A class of generative models that unifies flow-based and diffusion-based methods is introduced. These models extend the framework proposed in Albergo and Vanden-Eijnden (2023), enabling the use of a broad class of continuous-time stochastic processes called stochastic interpolants to bridge any two probability density functions exactly in finite time. These interpolants are built by combining data from the two prescribed densities with an additional latent variable that shapes the bridge in a flexible way. The time-dependent density function of the interpolant is shown to satisfy a transport equation as well as a family of forward and backward Fokker-Planck equations with tunable diffusion coefficient. Upon consideration of the time evolution of an individual sample, this viewpoint leads to both deterministic and stochastic generative models based on probability flow equations or stochastic differential equations with an adjustable level of noise. The drift coefficients entering these models are time-dependent velocity fields characterized as the unique minimizers of simple quadratic objective functions, one of which is a new objective for the score. We show that minimization of these quadratic objectives leads to control of the likelihood for generative models built upon stochastic dynamics, while likelihood control for deterministic dynamics is more stringent. We also construct estimators for the likelihood and the cross entropy of interpolant-based generative models, and we discuss connections with other methods such as score-based diffusion models, stochastic localization, probabilistic denoising, and rectifying flows. In addition, we demonstrate that stochastic interpolants recover the Schrödinger bridge between the two target densities when explicitly optimizing over the interpolant. Finally, algorithmic aspects are discussed and the approach is illustrated on numerical examples.

Title: Recommendations and tools to enable reproducibility in 2D materials research
Authors: Peter Bøggild, Timothy John Booth, Bjarke Sørensen Jessen, Abhay Shivayogimath, Nolan Lassaline, Stephan Hofmann, Kim Daasbjerg, Anders Smith, Kasper Nørgaard, Amaia Zurutuza, Terrance Barkan, Andrew J. Pollard
Abstract: Research on 2D materials has achieved significant milestones and fuelled a rapidly growing industrial sector. This progress, however, is accompanied by challenges in reproducibility, arising from the atomic thinness, fragility, and environmental sensitivity of these materials. Subtle variations in methods or materials can lead to drastically different outcomes, undermining reliability and slowing down both scientific and technological advances. At the same time, academic publishing and funding systems continue to place greater value on novelty than on efforts to improve reproducibility. This Expert Recommendation outlines concrete, actions researchers can take to improve reproducibility in 2D materials science. We introduce two tools - STEP (Standardised Template for Experimental Procedures) and ReChart (Reproducibility Charter) - designed to support rigorous documentation and transparent sharing of protocols, failure modes, and raw data. To illustrate the application of STEP, we provide three detailed examples covering key processes in 2D materials research: graphene growth by chemical vapour deposition (CVD) on copper foil, wet transfer of CVD graphene, and dry assembly of van der Waals heterostructures. We offer practical recommendations that spans the full research process and show how researchers can engage constructively with stakeholders across academia, funding, publishing, and industry to create a stronger basis for reproducibility, transparency and trust in the field.

Title: The non-stabilizerness of fermionic Gaussian states
Authors: Mario Collura, Jacopo De Nardis, Vincenzo Alba, Guglielmo Lami
Abstract: We introduce an efficient method to quantify nonstabilizerness in fermionic Gaussian states, overcoming the long-standing challenge posed by their extensive entanglement. Using a perfect sampling scheme based on an underlying determinantal point process, we compute the Stabilizer Rényi Entropies (SREs) for systems with hundreds of qubits. Benchmarking on random Gaussian states with and without particle conservation, we reveal an extensive leading behavior equal to that of Haar random states, with logarithmic subleading corrections. We support these findings with analytical calculations for a set of related quantities, the participation entropies in the computational (or Fock) basis, for which we derive an exact formula. We also investigate the time evolution of non-stabilizerness in a random unitary circuit with Gaussian gates, observing that it converges in a time that scales logarithmically with the system size. Applying the sampling algorithm to a two-dimensional free-fermionic topological model, we uncover a sharp transition in non-stabilizerness at the phase boundaries, highlighting the power of our approach in exploring different phases of quantum many-body systems, even in higher dimensions.

Title: Krylov spread complexity as holographic complexity beyond JT gravity
Authors: Michal P. Heller, Jacopo Papalini, Tim Schuhmann
Abstract: One of the important open problems in quantum black hole physics is a dual interpretation of holographic complexity proposals. To date the only quantitative match is the equality between the Krylov spread complexity in triple-scaled SYK at infinite temperature and the complexity = volume proposal in classical JT gravity. Our work utilizes the recent connection between double-scaled SYK and sine-dilaton gravity to show that the quantitative relation between Krylov spread complexity and complexity = volume extends to finite temperatures and to full quantum regime on the gravity side at disk level. From the latter we isolate the first quantum correction to the complexity = volume proposal and propose to view it as a complexity of quantum fields in the bulk. Finally, we comment on the switchback effect, whose presence would make the Krylov spread complexity a fully fledged holographic complexity at least in sine-dilaton gravity.

Title: Low-temperature Gibbs states with tensor networks
Authors: Denise Cocchiarella, Mari Carmen Bañuls
Abstract: We introduce a tensor network method for approximating thermal equilibrium states of quantum many-body systems at low temperatures. Whereas the usual approach starts from infinite temperature and evolves the state in imaginary time (toward lower temperature), our ansatz is constructed from the zero-temperature limit, the ground state, which can be found with a standard tensor network approach. Motivated by properties of the ground state for conformal field theories, our ansatz is especially well suited near criticality. Moreover, it allows an efficient computation of thermodynamic quantities and entanglement properties. We demonstrate the performance of our approach with a tree tensor network ansatz, although it can be extended to other tensor networks, and present results illustrating its effectiveness in capturing the finite-temperature properties in one- and two-dimensional scenarios. In particular, in the critical one-dimensional case we show how the ansatz reproduces the finite temperature scaling of entanglement in a conformal field theory.

Title: Analysis of Josephson Junction Barrier Variation: A Combined Electron Microscopy, Breakdown and Monte-Carlo Approach
Authors: Oscar W. Kennedy, Kevin G. Crawford, Kowsar Shahbazi, Connor D. Shelly
Abstract: Josephson junctions manufactured to tight tolerances are necessary components for superconducting quantum computing. Developing precise manufacturing techniques for Josephson junctions requires an understanding of their make-up and robust feedback metrics against which to optimise. Here we consider complementary techniques assessing what conclusions they allow us to draw about the barriers in junctions. Monte-Carlo simulations of barriers show that standard deviations of 15-20% of the total barrier thickness are compatible with our experimental data. Electrical breakdown allows us to probe the weakest points in barriers. Narrowing the distribution of this breakdown provides a promising feedback mechanism for barrier optimisation. Grouping junctions by breakdown voltage allows us to identify sub-ensembles of junctions with different median resistance. Transmission electron microscopy can be used to find average barrier thickness, although we highlight challenges forming robust conclusions on the distribution of thicknesses in a barrier from these experiments.

Title: Gauging the complex SYK model
Authors: Ziruo Zhang, Cheng Peng
Abstract: Motivated by SYK-like models describing near-BPS black holes in string/M-theory, we consider gauging the U$(1)$ symmetry of the complex SYK model in the presence of a Wilson line with charge $k$. At a fixed background gauge field, solutions to the Schwinger-Dyson equations display vastly different properties from those at a fixed real chemical potential. In the partition function and the two-point function, the integral over the gauge field is performed either directly or via a large $N$ saddle point approximation, and both results are consistent with exact diagonalization data. From the behaviour of the two-point function at large $N$, we deduce that the conformal symmetry at low energies is preserved at fixed $\kappa = k/N = 0$, but broken at $\kappa\neq 0$. In addition, we find that there is maximal chaos for all $k$.

Title: Unified Cross-Scale 3D Generation and Understanding via Autoregressive Modeling
Authors: Shuqi Lu, Haowei Lin, Lin Yao, Zhifeng Gao, Xiaohong Ji, Yitao Liang, Weinan E, Linfeng Zhang, Guolin Ke
Abstract: 3D structure modeling is essential across scales, enabling applications from fluid simulation and 3D reconstruction to protein folding and molecular docking. Yet, despite shared 3D spatial patterns, current approaches remain fragmented, with models narrowly specialized for specific domains and unable to generalize across tasks or scales. We propose Uni-3DAR, a unified autoregressive framework for cross-scale 3D generation and understanding. At its core is a coarse-to-fine tokenizer based on octree data structures, which compresses diverse 3D structures into compact 1D token sequences. We further propose a two-level subtree compression strategy, which reduces the octree token sequence by up to 8x. To address the challenge of dynamically varying token positions introduced by compression, we introduce a masked next-token prediction strategy that ensures accurate positional modeling, significantly boosting model performance. Extensive experiments across multiple 3D generation and understanding tasks, including small molecules, proteins, polymers, crystals, and macroscopic 3D objects, validate its effectiveness and versatility. Notably, Uni-3DAR surpasses previous state-of-the-art diffusion models by a substantial margin, achieving up to 256\% relative improvement while delivering inference speeds up to 21.8x faster.

Title: Liouvillian Spectral Transition in Noisy Quantum Many-Body Scars
Authors: Jin-Lou Ma, Zexian Guo, Yu Gao, Zlatko Papić, Lei Ying
Abstract: Understanding the behavior of quantum many-body systems under decoherence is essential for developing robust quantum technologies. Here, we examine the fate of weak ergodicity breaking in systems hosting quantum many-body scars when subject to local pure dephasing -- an experimentally relevant form of environmental noise. Focusing on a large class of models with an approximate su(2)-structured scar subspace, we show that scarred eigenmodes of the Liouvillean exhibit a transition reminiscent of spontaneous $\mathbb{PT}$-symmetry breaking as the dephasing strength increases. Unlike previously studied non-Hermitian mechanisms, this transition arises from a distinct quantum jump effect. Remarkably, in platforms such as the XY spin ladder and PXP model of Rydberg atom arrays, the critical dephasing rate shows only weak dependence on the system size, revealing an unexpected robustness of scarred dynamics in noisy environments.

Title: Indirect Influence on Network Diffusion
Authors: Lluís Torres-Hugas, Jordi Duch, Sergio Gómez
Abstract: Models of network diffusion typically rely on the Laplacian matrix, capturing interactions via direct connections. Beyond direct interactions, information in many systems can also flow via indirect pathways, where influence typically diminishes over distance. In this work, we analyze diffusion dynamics incorporating such indirect connections using the $d$-path Laplacian framework. We introduce a parameter, the indirect influence, based on the change in the second smallest eigenvalue of the generalized path Laplacian, to quantify the impact of these pathways on diffusion timescales relative to direct-only models. Using perturbation theory and mean-field approximations, we derive analytical expressions for the indirect influence in terms of structural properties of random networks. Theoretical predictions align well with numerical simulations, providing a phase diagram for when indirect influence becomes significant. We also identify a structural phase transition governed by the emergence of $d$-paths and derive the critical connection probability above which they dramatically alter diffusion. This study provides a quantitative understanding of how indirect pathways shape network dynamics and reveals their collective structural onset.

Title: Pauli Stabilizer Models for Gapped Boundaries of Twisted Quantum Doubles and Applications to Composite Dimensional Codes
Authors: Mohamad Mousa, Amit Jamadagni, Eugene Dumitrescu
Abstract: We provide new algorithms and provide example constructions of stabilizer models for the gapped boundaries, domain walls, and $0D$ defects of Abelian composite dimensional twisted quantum doubles. Using the physically intuitive concept of condensation, our algorithm explicitly describes how to construct the boundary and domain-wall stabilizers starting from the bulk model. This extends the utility of Pauli stabilizer models in describing non-translationally invariant topological orders with gapped boundaries. To highlight this utility, we provide a series of examples including a new family of quantum error-correcting codes where the double of $\mathbb{Z}_4$ is coupled to instances of the double semion (DS) phase. We discuss the codes' utility in the burgeoning area of quantum error correction with an emphasis on the interplay between deconfined anyons, logical operators, error rates and decoding. We also augment our construction, built using algorithmic tools to describe the properties of explicit stabilizer layouts at the microscopic lattice-level, with dimensional counting arguments and macroscopic-level constructions building on pants decompositions. The latter outlines how such codes' representation and design can be automated. Going beyond our worked out examples, we expect our explicit step-by-step algorithms to pave the path for new higher-algebraic-dimensional codes to be discovered and implemented in near-term architectures that take advantage of various hardware's distinct strengths.

Title: Generation of Volume-Law Entanglement by Local-Measurement-Only Quantum Dynamics
Authors: Surajit Bera, Igor V. Gornyi, Sumilan Banerjee, Yuval Gefen
Abstract: Repeated local measurements typically have adversarial effects on entangling unitary dynamics, as local measurements usually degrade entanglement. However, recent works on measurement-only dynamics have shown that strongly entangled states can be generated solely through non-commuting random multi-site and multi-spin projective measurements. In this work, we explore a generalized measurement setup in a system without intrinsic unitary dynamics and show that volume-law entangled states can be generated through local, non-random, yet non-commuting measurements. Specifically, we construct a one-dimensional model comprising a main fermionic chain and an auxiliary (ancilla) chain, where generalized measurements are performed by locally coupling the system to detector qubits. Our results demonstrate that long-time states with volume-law entanglement or mutual information are generated between different parts of the main chain purely through non-unitary measurement dynamics. Remarkably, we find that such large-entanglement generation can be achieved using only the measurements of one-body operators. Moreover, we show that measurements of non-local higher-body operators can be used to control and reduce entanglement generation by introducing kinetic constraints to the dynamics. We discuss the statistics of entanglement measures along the quantum trajectories, the approach to stationary distributions of entanglement or long-time steady states, and the associated notions of limited ergodicity in the measurement-only dynamics. Our findings highlight the potential of non-random measurement protocols for controlled entanglement generation and the study of non-unitary many-body dynamics.

Title: Classical and quantum chaotic synchronization in coupled dissipative time crystals
Authors: Eliška Postavová, Gianluca Passarelli, Procolo Lucignano, Angelo Russomanno
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of two coherently coupled dissipative time crystals. In the classical mean-field limit of infinite spin length, we identify a regime of chaotic synchronization, marked by a positive largest Lyapunov exponent and a Pearson correlation coefficient close to one. At the boundary of this regime, the Pearson coefficient varies abruptly, marking a crossover between staggered and uniform $z$-magnetization. To address finite-size quantum dynamics, we employ a quantum-trajectory approach and study the trajectory-resolved expectations of subsystem $z$-magnetizations. Their histograms over time and trajectory realizations exhibit maxima that undergo a staggered-to-uniform crossover analogous to the classical one. In analogy with the classical case, we interpret this behavior as quantum chaotic synchronization, with dissipative quantum chaos highlighted by the steady-state density matrix exhibiting Gaussian Unitary Ensemble statistics. The classical and quantum crossover points are different due to the noncommutativity of the infinite-time and infinite-spin-magnitude limits and the role played by entanglement in the quantum case, quantified via the two-subsystem entanglement entropy.

Authors: Xueyuan Yan
Abstract: We develop a numerical approach based on the sinc basis set for first-principles electronic structure calculations in one-dimensional systems. The method exploits the inherent accuracy and non-local character of the sinc functions to handle long-range couplings effectively. As a proof of principle, we provide a computational study of a molecule in an optical cavity, with our code directly calculating the emergence of the energy level splitting in the spectrum.

Title: Chiral quantum state circulation from photon lattice topology
Authors: Souvik Bandyopadhyay, Anushya Chandran, Philip JD Crowley
Abstract: Chiral quantum state circulation is the unidirectional transfer of a quantum state from one subsystem to the next. It is essential to the working of a quantum computer; for instance, for state preparation and isolation. We propose a cavity-QED architecture consisting of three cavities coupled to a qubit, in which \emph{any} photonic state of cavity 1 with sufficiently many photons circulates to cavity 2 after a fixed time interval, and then to cavity 3 and back to 1. Cavity-state circulation arises from topologically protected chiral boundary states in the associated photon lattice and is thus robust to perturbation. We compute the circulation period in the semi-classical limit, demonstrate that circulation persists for time-scales diverging with the total photon number, and provide a Floquet protocol to engineer the desired Hamiltonian. Superconducting qubits offer an ideal platform to build and test these devices in the near term.

Title: The role of entropy production and thermodynamic uncertainty relations in the asymmetric thermalization of open quantum systems
Authors: Álvaro Tejero
Abstract: The asymmetry between heating and cooling in open quantum systems is a hallmark of nonequilibrium dynamics, yet its thermodynamic origin has remained unclear. Here, we investigate the thermalization of a quantum system weakly coupled to a thermal bath, focusing on the entropy production rate and the quantum thermokinetic uncertainty relation (TKUR). We derive an analytical expression for the entropy production rate, showing that heating begins with a higher entropy production, which drives faster thermalization than cooling. The quantum TKUR links this asymmetry to heat-current fluctuations, demonstrating that larger entropy production suppresses fluctuations, making heating more stable than cooling. Our results reveal the thermodynamic basis of asymmetric thermalization and highlight uncertainty relations as key to nonequilibrium quantum dynamics.

Title: Identification and optimal control strategies for the transversal splitting of ultra--cold Bose gases
Authors: Nikolaus Würkner, Yevhenii Kuriatnikov, Karthikeyan Kumaran, M Venkat Ramana, Jörg Schmiedmayer, Andreas Kugi, Maximilian Prüfer, Andreas Deutschmann-Olek
Abstract: Splitting a Bose--Einstein condensate (BEC) is a key operation in fundamental physics experiments and emerging quantum technologies, where precise preparation of well--defined initial states requires fast yet coherent control of the condensate's nonlinear dynamics. This work formulates the BEC splitting process as an optimal feedforward control problem based on a physically interpretable, reduced--order model identified from limited experimental data. We introduce a systematic calibration strategy that combines optimal experiment selection and constrained nonlinear parameter estimation, enabling accurate system identification with minimal experimental overhead. Using this calibrated model, we compute energy--optimal trajectories via indirect optimal control to realize shortcuts to adiabaticity (STAs), achieving rapid transitions to the ground state of a double--well potential while suppressing excitations. Experiments confirm that the proposed control framework yields high--fidelity state transfers across multiple configurations, demonstrating its robustness and scalability for quantum control applications.
