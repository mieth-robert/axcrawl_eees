Title: Topology Optimization of Pneumatic Soft Actuators Based on Porohyperelasticity
Authors: Sumit Mehta, Konstantinos Poulios
Abstract: This paper introduces a new nonlinear topology optimization framework which employs porohyperelasticity for providing computational design of pneumatic soft actuators. Density-based topology optimization is used with the objective of maximizing the bending response in a soft actuator made of an elastomer, for given actuation pressure and external resistance. Pressurization of interconnected cavities is modeled via an extension of the Darcy flow theory that is valid for large deformations. Essential for the good performance of the framework is a carefully chosen interpolation scheme for the permeability between void and solid regions, as well as a suitable definition of a drainage term in the solid regions. Results are shown for a variety of actuation pressure and maximum allowable strain energy density levels, covering a wide range of system responses from small to rather large deformations.

Title: Achieve equilibrium outside the contact angle hysteresis
Authors: Lei Liu, Guanlong Guo, Kaiyu Wang, Linke Chen, Yangyang Fan, Sergio Andres Galindo Torres, Jiu-an Lv, Herbert E. Huppert, Changfu Wei, Liang Lei
Abstract: It is common belief that the equilibrium contact angle, corresponding to the minimum system energy state, lies between advancing and receding contact angles. Here, we derive advancing and receding contact angles considering the micro contacting processes on ideal rough 2D surfaces. Equilibrium contact angles obtained via energy minimization can be smaller than the receding contact angle and reach 0 degrees, at which hysteresis diminishes on the super-hydrophilic surface. Gibbs free energy analyses, numerical simulations and physical experiments all confirm these new findings.

Title: Elasto-Hall conductivity and the anomalous Hall effect in altermagnets
Authors: Keigo Takahashi, Charles R. W. Steward, Masao Ogata, Rafael M. Fernandes, Jörg Schmalian
Abstract: Altermagnets break time-reversal symmetry, preserve the crystal translation invariance, and have a spin density with $d$-wave, $g$-wave, etc. momentum dependencies which do not contribute to the magnetization. When an $s$-wave spin-density contribution cannot be excluded by symmetry a small magnetization and an anomalous Hall effect (AHE) emerge. However, for so-called "pure" altermagnets, where the $s$-wave component is symmetry forbidden even in the presence of SOC, both the zero-field magnetization and the AHE vanish. We show that altermagnets generally exhibit a non-zero elasto-Hall-conductivity, by which application of strain leads to a non-zero AHE. For pure altermagnets it is the only contribution to the AHE. This elasto-Hall-conductivity is caused by strain coupling to the Berry curvature quadrupole that characterizes altermagnets and allows for the determination of the altermagnetic order using transport measurements that are linear in the electrical field. We further show that the emergence of a non-zero magnetization in the presence of strain arises from a different response function: piezomagnetism. While this magnetization gives rise to an additional contribution to the elasto-Hall conductivity, the corresponding Berry curvature is qualitatively different from the distorted Berry curvature quadrupole originating from the altermagnetic order parameter. This insight also helps to disentangle AHE and weak ferromagnetism for systems with symmetry-allowed $s$-wave contribution. Quantitatively, the elasto-Hall conductivity is particularly pronounced for systems with a Dirac spectrum in the altermagnetic state. The same mechanism gives rise to anomalous elasto-thermal Hall, Nernst, and Ettinghausen effects.

Title: Non-commutative effective field theory of the lowest Landau level superfluid
Authors: Nandagopal Manoj
Abstract: A 2+1D superfluid in a rapidly rotating trap forms an array of vortices, with collective excitations called Tkachenko modes. Du et al. (2024) argued from an effective field theory viewpoint that these excitations are described by a field theory living on a non-commutative space. We elucidate the microscopic origin of these non-commutative fields, and present a novel derivation of the effective field theory for this superfluid using a lowest Landau level projected coherent state path integral approach. Besides conceptual clarity, this approach makes quantitative predictions about the long-wavelength, low-energy behavior in terms of the microscopic parameters of the weakly interacting lowest Landau level superfluid -- relevant to trapped Bose-Einstein condensate experiments.

Title: Realizing Quantitative Quasiparticle Modeling of Skyrmion Dynamics in Arbitrary Potentials
Authors: Maarten A. Brems, Tobias Sparmann, Simon M. Fröhlich, Leonie-C. Dany, Jan Rothörl, Fabian Kammerbauer, Elizabeth M. Jefremovas, Oded Farago, Mathias Kläui, Peter Virnau
Abstract: We demonstrate fully quantitative Thiele model simulations of magnetic skyrmion dynamics on previously unattainable experimentally relevant large length and time scales by ascertaining the key missing parameters needed to calibrate the experimental and simulation time scales and current-induced forces. Our work allows us to determine complete spatial pinning energy landscapes that enable quantification of experimental studies of diffusion in arbitrary potentials within the Lifson-Jackson framework. Our method enables us to ascertain the time scales, and by isolating the effect of ultra-low current density (order $10^6 A/m^2$) generated torques we directly infer the total force acting on the skyrmion for a quantitative modelling.

Title: Super-diffusion of Photoexcited Carriers in Topological Insulator Nanoribbons
Authors: Rodrigo Becerra Silva, Jay Huang, Bob Minyu Wang, Ziyi Song, Henry Clark Travaglini, Dong Yu
Abstract: Understanding the ultrafast dynamics and transport of photoexcited carriers in topological insulators is crucial for the optical manipulation of spins and may shed light on the nature of topological excitons. Here we investigate bulk-insulating Sb-doped $\mathrm{Bi_2Se_3}$ nanoribbons via ultrafast transient photovoltage microscopy. The probe-pulse-induced photovoltage is substantially suppressed by a pump pulse. Recovery time increases from 50 to 1600 picoseconds as the pump fluence increases. We found that the diffusivity of photoexcited carriers increases significantly at lower carrier concentrations, up to 800 cm$^2$/s at 21 K, two to three orders of magnitude higher than that of band-edge carriers. Remarkably, the photoexcited carriers travel up to 10 $\mu$m for hundreds of picoseconds at this high diffusivity. The diffusivity peaks in intrinsic devices and is reduced at high temperatures. We discuss the possible mechanisms of long-ranged super-diffusion in the frames of hot carriers and exciton condensation.

Title: Information-optimal mixing at low Reynolds number
Authors: Luca Cocconi, Yihong Shi, Andrej Vilfan
Abstract: Mutual information between particle positions before and after mixing provides a universal assumption-free measure of mixing efficiency at low Reynolds number which accounts for the kinematic reversibility of the Stokes equation. For a generic planar shear flow with time-dependent shear rate, we derive a compact expression for the mutual information as a nonlinear functional of the shearing protocol and solve the associated extremisation problem exactly to determine the optimal control under both linear and non-linear constraints, specifically total shear and total dissipation per unit volume. Remarkably, optimal protocols turn out to be universal and time-reversal symmetric in both cases. Our results establish a minimum energetic cost of erasing information through mixing.

Title: Multi-Output Convolutional Neural Network for Improved Parameter Extraction in Time-Resolved Electrostatic Force Microscopy Data
Authors: Madeleine D. Breshears, Rajiv Giridharagopal, David S. Ginger
Abstract: Time-resolved scanning probe microscopy methods, like time-resolved electrostatic force microscopy (trEFM), enable imaging of dynamic processes ranging from ion motion in batteries to electronic dynamics in microstructured thin film semiconductors for solar cells. Reconstructing the underlying physical dynamics from these techniques can be challenging due to the interplay of cantilever physics with the actual transient kinetics of interest in the resulting signal. Previously, quantitative trEFM used empirical calibration of the cantilever or feed-forward neural networks trained on simulated data to extract the physical dynamics of interest. Both these approaches are limited by interpreting the underlying signal as a single exponential function, which serves as an approximation but does not adequately reflect many realistic systems. Here, we present a multi-branched, multi-output convolutional neural network (CNN) that uses the trEFM signal in addition to the physical cantilever parameters as input. The trained CNN accurately extracts parameters describing both single-exponential and bi-exponential underlying functions, and more accurately reconstructs real experimental data in the presence of noise. This work demonstrates an application of physics-informed machine learning to complex signal processing tasks, enabling more efficient and accurate analysis of trEFM.

Title: Universal machine learning interatomic potentials poised to supplant DFT in modeling general defects in metals and random alloys
Authors: Fei Shuang, Zixiong Wei, Kai Liu, Wei Gao, Poulumi Dey
Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning, combined with the generation of extensive density functional theory (DFT) datasets, have enabled the development of universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs). These models offer broad applicability across the periodic table, achieving first-principles accuracy at a fraction of the computational cost of traditional DFT calculations. In this study, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art pretrained uMLIPs can effectively replace DFT for accurately modeling complex defects in a wide range of metals and alloys. Our investigation spans diverse scenarios, including grain boundaries and general defects in pure metals, defects in high-entropy alloys, hydrogen-alloy interactions, and solute-defect interactions. Remarkably, the latest EquiformerV2 models achieve DFT-level accuracy on comprehensive defect datasets, with root mean square errors (RMSE) below 5 meV/atom for energies and 100 meV/Å for forces, outperforming specialized machine learning potentials such as moment tensor potential and atomic cluster expansion. We also present a systematic analysis of accuracy versus computational cost and explore uncertainty quantification for uMLIPs. A detailed case study of tungsten (W) demonstrates that data on pure W alone is insufficient for modeling complex defects in uMLIPs, underscoring the critical importance of advanced machine learning architectures and diverse datasets, which include over 100 million structures spanning all elements. These findings establish uMLIPs as a robust alternative to DFT and a transformative tool for accelerating the discovery and design of high-performance materials.

Title: SymmCD: Symmetry-Preserving Crystal Generation with Diffusion Models
Authors: Daniel Levy, Siba Smarak Panigrahi, Sékou-Oumar Kaba, Qiang Zhu, Kin Long Kelvin Lee, Mikhail Galkin, Santiago Miret, Siamak Ravanbakhsh
Abstract: Generating novel crystalline materials has potential to lead to advancements in fields such as electronics, energy storage, and catalysis. The defining characteristic of crystals is their symmetry, which plays a central role in determining their physical properties. However, existing crystal generation methods either fail to generate materials that display the symmetries of real-world crystals, or simply replicate the symmetry information from examples in a database. To address this limitation, we propose SymmCD, a novel diffusion-based generative model that explicitly incorporates crystallographic symmetry into the generative process. We decompose crystals into two components and learn their joint distribution through diffusion: 1) the asymmetric unit, the smallest subset of the crystal which can generate the whole crystal through symmetry transformations, and; 2) the symmetry transformations needed to be applied to each atom in the asymmetric unit. We also use a novel and interpretable representation for these transformations, enabling generalization across different crystallographic symmetry groups. We showcase the competitive performance of SymmCD on a subset of the Materials Project, obtaining diverse and valid crystals with realistic symmetries and predicted properties.

Title: Coexistence of 3D and quasi-2D Fermi surfaces driven by orbital selective Kondo scattering in UTe$_2$
Authors: Byungkyun Kang, Myoung-Hwan Kim, Chul Hong Park
Abstract: The 3D Fermi surface, along with a chiral in-gap state and a Majorana zero energy state, is suggested to play a crucial role in the topologically nontrivial superconductivity in UTe$_2$. However, conflicting experimental observations of the 2D Fermi surface raise questions about topological superconductivity. By combining ab initio many-body perturbation GW theory and dynamical mean-field theory based on Feynman diagrams, we discovered the coexistence of two orbital dependent Fermi surfaces, both centered at the $\Gamma$ point in the Brillouin zone, which are heavily influenced by the orbital-selective Kondo effect. At high temperature, both Fermi surfaces exhibit 3D nature with weak spectral weight due to incoherent Kondo hybridization. Upon cooling down to 25 K, due to the pronounced Kondo coherence, while one Fermi surface remains a robust 3D Fermi surface, the other transforms surprisingly into a quasi-2D Fermi surface, which should be responsible for the experimental observation of 2D character. Our results suggest that the 3D Fermi surface should exist at low temperature for the topological superconductivity. Our findings call for further investigation of the interplay between the two orbital-dependent $\Gamma$-centered Fermi surfaces.

Title: Polarons and Exciton-Polarons in Two-Dimensional Polar Materials
Authors: V. Shahnazaryan, A. Kudlis, I. V. Tokatly
Abstract: We propose a macroscopic theory of optical phonons, Fr{öh}lich polarons, and exciton-polarons in two-dimensional (2D) polar crystalline monolayers. Our theory extends the classical macroscopic formulation of the electron-phonon problem in three-dimensional (3D) polar crystals to the new generation of 2D materials. Similarly to the 3D case, in our approach, the effective electron-phonon Hamiltonian is parametrized solely in terms of macroscopic experimentally accessible quantities -- 2D polarizabilities of the monolayer at low and high frequencies. We derive the dispersion of long wave length longitudinal optical (LO) phonons, which can be viewed as a 2D form of the Lyddane-Sachs-Teller relation, and study the formation of 2D Fr{öh}lich polarons by adopting the intermediate coupling approximation. Finally, we apply this approach to excitons in polar 2D crystals and derive an effective potential of the electron-hole interaction dressed by LO phonons. Due to the specific dispersion of LO phonons, the polarons and exciton-polarons in 2D materials exhibit unique features not found in their 3D counterparts. As an illustration, the polaron and exciton-polaron binding energies are computed for a representative set of 2D polar crystals, demonstrating the interplay between dimensionality, polarizability of materials, and electron-phonon coupling.

Title: Energy & Force Regression on DFT Trajectories is Not Enough for Universal Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials
Authors: Santiago Miret, Kin Long Kelvin Lee, Carmelo Gonzales, Sajid Mannan, N. M. Anoop Krishnan
Abstract: Universal Machine Learning Interactomic Potentials (MLIPs) enable accelerated simulations for materials discovery. However, current research efforts fail to impactfully utilize MLIPs due to: 1. Overreliance on Density Functional Theory (DFT) for MLIP training data creation; 2. MLIPs' inability to reliably and accurately perform large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for diverse materials; 3. Limited understanding of MLIPs' underlying capabilities. To address these shortcomings, we aargue that MLIP research efforts should prioritize: 1. Employing more accurate simulation methods for large-scale MLIP training data creation (e.g. Coupled Cluster Theory) that cover a wide range of materials design spaces; 2. Creating MLIP metrology tools that leverage large-scale benchmarking, visualization, and interpretability analyses to provide a deeper understanding of MLIPs' inner workings; 3. Developing computationally efficient MLIPs to execute MD simulations that accurately model a broad set of materials properties. Together, these interdisciplinary research directions can help further the real-world application of MLIPs to accurately model complex materials at device scale.

Title: Co-existing topological and Volkov-Pankratov plasmonic edge states in magnetized graphene
Authors: Samyobrata Mukherjee, Viktoriia Savchuk, Jeffery W. Allen, Monica S. Allen, Gennady Shvets
Abstract: Graphene placed in a perpendicular magnetic field supports optical modes known as magnetoplasmons which are transversally confined to the graphene layer. Unlike ordinary graphene plasmons, these magnetoplasmonic surface waves are characterized by a band gap corresponding to the cyclotron frequency. In addition, these magnetoplasmon bands are topological, characterized by a non-zero Chern number. This leads to the existence of topologically protected edge states at domain edges where the Chern number changes. Since the Chern number is dependent on the direction of the magnetic field, edge states exist at domain edges across which the magnetic field flips direction. Physically, the magnetic field can only flip direction at gradual domain edges with finite width creating topological heterojunctions. These topological heterojunctions support extra edge states known as Volkov-Pankratov edge states which can enter the band gap and support propagation in both directions. The number of Volkov-Pankratov states at a heterojunction varies as a function of the width of the gradual domain edge.

Title: Microstructure-Aware Bayesian Materials Design
Authors: Danial Khatamsaz, Vahid Attari, Raymundo Arroyave
Abstract: In this study, we propose a novel microstructure-sensitive Bayesian optimization (BO) framework designed to enhance the efficiency of materials discovery by explicitly incorporating microstructural information. Traditional materials design approaches often focus exclusively on direct chemistry-process-property relationships, overlooking the critical role of microstructures. To address this limitation, our framework integrates microstructural descriptors as latent variables, enabling the construction of a comprehensive process-structure-property mapping that improves both predictive accuracy and optimization outcomes. By employing the active subspace method for dimensionality reduction, we identify the most influential microstructural features, thereby reducing computational complexity while maintaining high accuracy in the design process. This approach also enhances the probabilistic modeling capabilities of Gaussian processes, accelerating convergence to optimal material configurations with fewer iterations and experimental observations. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework through synthetic and real-world case studies, including the design of Mg$_2$Sn$_x$Si$_{1-x}$ thermoelectric materials for energy conversion. Our results underscore the critical role of microstructures in linking processing conditions to material properties, highlighting the potential of a microstructure-aware design paradigm to revolutionize materials discovery. Furthermore, this work suggests that since incorporating microstructure awareness improves the efficiency of Bayesian materials discovery, microstructure characterization stages should be integral to automated -- and eventually autonomous -- platforms for materials development.

Title: Improving noisy free-energy measurements by adding more noise
Authors: Stephen Whitelam
Abstract: Estimating free-energy differences using nonequilibrium work relations, such as the Jarzynski equality, is hindered by poor convergence when work fluctuations are large. For systems governed by overdamped Langevin dynamics, we propose the counterintuitive approach of adding noise in order to increase the precision of such calculations. By introducing additional stochastic fluctuations to the system and rescaling its potential energy, we leave the thermodynamics of the system unchanged while increasing its relaxation rate. For a given time-dependent protocol this modification reduces dissipated work, leading to more accurate free-energy estimates. We demonstrate this principle using computer simulations applied to two model systems. However, the regime of applicability of this strategy is likely limited, because it requires control of the system's potential energy in a way that is feasible in only a few experimental settings.

Title: Stacking effects on magnetic, vibrational, and optical properties of CrSBr bilayers
Authors: Huicong Li, Yali Yang, Zhonghao Xia, Yateng Wang, Jiacheng Wei, Jiangang He, Rongming Wang
Abstract: The van der Waals layered semiconductor CrSBr, which exhibits A-type antiferromagnetism and a relatively high Néel temperature, has been successfully exfoliated into atomically thin sheets. In this study, we investigate the structural, lattice dynamical, electronic, magnetic, and optical properties of four distinct stacking structures of CrSBr bilayers using first-principles calculations and Monte Carlo simulations. Our findings show that though the most energetically favorable bilayer structure retains the stacking pattern of the bulk counterpart, three other high-symmetry stacking structures can be achieved by sliding one of the layers along three distinct directions, with energy costs comparable to that observed in MoS$_2$ bilayer. All these four bilayers exhibit semiconductor behavior with A-type antiferromagnetic ordering, similar to the bulk material, and demonstrate closely aligned Néel temperatures. Moreover, these bilayers exhibit relatively low lattice thermal conductivities, pronounced anisotropy, and a strong dependence on stacking patterns. This behavior is attributed to significant phonon-phonon scattering arising from avoided crossings between acoustic and optical phonons, as well as the presence of flat optical phonon bands in the low-frequency region. While the electronic structures and optical properties of these bilayers show weak dependence on the stacking pattern for antiferromagnetic ordering, they undergo significant changes for ferromagnetic ordering, influencing the band gap, valence and conduction band splitting, and effective mass. Furthermore, we found that antiferromagnetic ordering can transition to ferromagnetic under intense visible light illumination. Thus, the integration of layer stacking and visible light illumination offers an effective means to control the heat transfer, magnetic, and optical properties of CrSBr bilayers.

Title: Twist, splay, and uniform domains in ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals
Authors: Maxim O. Lavrentovich, Priyanka Kumari, Oleg D. Lavrentovich
Abstract: The recently-discovered ferroelectric nematic ($\mathrm{N}_\mathrm{F}$) liquid crystal presents a host of defect phenomena due to its unique polar nature and long-ranged electrostatic interactions. Like the solid state ferroelectrics, the depolarization field in the material favors a spontaneous spatial variation of the polarization $\mathbf{P}$, manifesting in myriad ways including a twist in the bulk and different arrangements of alternating polarization domains. Unlike the solid-state ferroelectrics with a bulk crystalline structure, the configuration of the $\mathrm{N}_\mathrm{F}$ fluids is determined not only by the reduction of depolarization fields but also by the alignment of molecules at interfaces. In this work, we consider an $\mathrm{N}_\mathrm{F}$ confined to a thin cell, pre-patterned with various types of apolar surface anchoring produced by photoalignment. For uniform planar alignment, we find that the sample forms a series of striped domains. For a cell pre-patterned with a radial +1 defect pattern, the $\mathrm{N}_\mathrm{F}$ breaks up into "pie-slice" polarization domains. We calculate the elastic and electrostatic energy balance which determines the observed configurations and demonstrate that the electrostatic interactions tend to decrease the characteristic domain size $\lambda$ while the elastic and surface anchoring interactions facilitate a larger $\lambda$. We also demonstrate that ionic screening mitigates electrostatic interactions, increasing $\lambda$ and, above some critical concentration, eliminating the domains altogether.

Title: Symmetry-breaking induced surface magnetization in non-magnetic RuO$_2$
Authors: Dai Q. Ho, D. Quang To, Ruiqi Hu, Garnett W. Bryant, Anderson Janotti
Abstract: Altermagnetism is a newly identified phase of magnetism distinct from ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. RuO$_2$ has been considered a prototypical metallic altermagnet with a critical temperature higher than room temperature. Previous interpretations of the unusual magnetic properties of RuO$_2$ relied on the theoretical prediction that local moments on two Ru sublattices, which are connected by four-fold rotational symmetry, are quite significant (approximately 1 $\mu_B$), leading to long-range antiferromagnetic order. However, accumulated experimental data suggest that local moments on Ru in RuO$_2$ are vanishingly small, indicating that the bulk material is likely non-magnetic. This observation is consistent with the delocalized nature of the 4$d$ electrons of Ru and the strong screening effect in the metallic state. In this work, we show that despite the non-magnetic bulk, the RuO$_2$(110) surface exhibits spontaneous magnetization. We attribute this effect to the breaking of local symmetry, which results in electronic redistribution and magnetic moment enhancement. The emergence of surface magnetism gives rise to interesting spectroscopic phenomena, including spin-polarized surface states, spin-polarized scanning probe microscopy images, and potentially spin-dependent transport effects. These findings highlight the important role of surface magnetic structures in the otherwise non-magnetic bulk RuO$_2$.

Title: A Multiscale Approach to Structural Relaxation and Diffusion in Metallic Glasses
Authors: Anh D. Phan, Do T. Nga, Ngo T. Que, Hailong Peng, Thongchanh Norhourmour, Le M. Tu
Abstract: Metallic glasses are promising materials with unique mechanical and thermal properties, but their atomic-scale dynamics remain challenging to understand. In this work, we develop a unified approach to investigate the glass transition and structural relaxation in CoCrNi, Zr46Cu46Al8, Zr50Cu40Al10, and Zr64.13Cu15.75Ni10.12Al10 metallic glasses. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is employed to analyze the radial distribution function at different temperatures and accurately determine the glass transition temperature. We then combine this temperature with the Elastically Collective Nonlinear Langevin Equation (ECNLE) theory to predict the temperature dependence of the structural relaxation time, tau_alpha(T). By connecting $\tau_\alpha(T)$ to the diffusion constant, the ECNLE predictions of tau_alpha(T) can be compared with those calculated from MD simulations or estimated based on the diffusion constant. By combining atomistic simulation with force-level statistical mechanics, our multiscale approach offers deeper insights into relaxation dynamics and diffusion across various timescales. The relationship between the glass transition and the liquidus temperature is elucidated. This study enhances understanding of the glassy dynamics and properties in complex amorphous materials.

Title: Out-of-phase Plasmon Excitations in the Trilayer Cuprate Bi$_2$Sr$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{10+\delta}$
Authors: S. Nakata, M. Bejas, J. Okamoto, K. Yamamoto, D. Shiga, R. Takahashi, H. Y. Huang, H. Kumigashira, H. Wadati, J. Miyawaki, S. Ishida, H. Eisaki, A. Fujimori, A. Greco, H. Yamase, D. J. Huang, H. Suzuki
Abstract: Within a homologous series of cuprate superconductors, variations in the stacking of CuO$_2$ layers influence the collective charge dynamics through the long-range Coulomb interactions. We use O $K$-edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering to reveal plasmon excitations in the optimally-doped trilayer Bi$_2$Sr$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{10+\delta}$. The observed plasmon exhibits nearly $q_z$-independent dispersion and a large excitation gap of approximately 300 meV. This mode is primarily ascribed to the $\omega_{-}$ mode, where the charge density on the outer CuO$_2$ sheets oscillates out of phase while the density in the inner sheet remains unaltered at $q_z=0$. The intensity of the acoustic $\omega_3$ mode is relatively weak and becomes vanishingly small near $(q_x, q_y)=(0, 0)$. This result highlights a qualitative change in the eigenmode of the dominant low-energy plasmon with the number of CuO$_2$ layers.

Title: Heteroepitaxial growth of highly anisotropic $Sb_{2}Se_{3}$ films on GaAs
Authors: Kelly Xiao, Virat Tara, Pooja D. Reddy, Jarod E. Meyer, Alec M. Skipper, Rui Chen, Leland J. Nordin, Arka Majumdar, Kunal Mukherjee
Abstract: The epitaxial integration of anisotropic materials with mainstream cubic semiconductors opens new routes to advanced electronic and photonic devices with directional properties. In this work, we synthesize heteroepitaxial thin films of orthorhombic "quasi-1D" $Sb_{2}Se_{3}$ on cubic GaAs(001) using molecular beam epitaxy. Traditionally, the synthesis of anisotropic films with low symmetry materials is challenging due to multiple grain orientations that form. On a macroscopic scale, such a film tends towards isotropic properties, even if individual grains possess anisotropic responses. We achieve epitaxial $Sb_{2}Se_{3}$ grains on pristine homoepitaxial GaAs templates at low temperatures of 180-200 °C. With the $Sb_{2}Se_{3}$ 1D axis aligned in-plane to GaAs [110] and the primary van der Waals direction lying out-of-plane, we find a birefringence of 0.2 between in-plane orthogonal directions and a giant out-of-plane birefringence greater than 1 at telecom wavelengths. Growth at higher temperatures up to 265 °C yields $Sb_{2}Se_{3}$ of an unusual in-plane rotated texture that further enhances the in-plane optical index anisotropy to 0.3.

Title: Correlated helimagnetic configuration in a nonsymmorphic magnetic nodal semimetal
Authors: Xi Luo, Yu-Ge Chen, Ye-Min Zhan, Yue Yu
Abstract: Nonsymmorphic magnetic Weyl semimetal materials such as ReAlX (Re=rare earth, X=Si/Ge) provide a unique opportunity to explore the correlated phenomena between Weyl fermions and nontrivial magnetic configurations. To be specific, we study a lattice model in which the magnetic configuration is determined by the competition among ferromagnetic (FM) interaction, the Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction, and the Kondo coupling $K_0$ to the Weyl fermion. Both quantum and finite-temperature phase transitions between FM and correlated nesting helical configurations are found. Different from the uncorrelated helimagnet that decouples to the Weyl fermions, this correlated helimagnet induces a magnetic Brillouin zone with a $K_0$-dependent nesting in the band structure of the conducting fermions instead of the magnetic monopole-like Weyl cone. By measuring the current induced by the chiral magnetic effect on the conducting fermion with nesting Weyl nodes, one can distinguish the correlated nesting helical order and the ferromagnetism because the chiral magnetic effect is considerably suppressed in the former case. These properties we study here may explain the experimental observations in ReAlX.

Title: Pisarenko's Formula for the Thermopower
Authors: Andrei Novitskii, Takao Mori
Abstract: The thermopower $\alpha$ (also known as the Seebeck coefficient) is one of the most fundamental material characteristics for understanding charge carrier transport in thermoelectric materials. Here, we revisit the Pisarenko formula for the thermopower, which was traditionally considered valid only for non-degenerate semiconductors. We demonstrate that regardless of the dominating scattering mechanism, the Pisarenko formula describes accurately enough the relationship between thermopower $\alpha$ and charge carrier concentration $n$ beyond the non-degenerate limit. Moreover, the Pisarenko formula provides a simple thermopower-conductivity relation, $\alpha = \pm \frac{k_{\mathrm{B}}}{e} (b - \ln \sigma)$, valid for materials with $\alpha > 90$ $\mu$V K$^{-1}$ when acoustic phonon scattering is predominant. This offers an alternative way to analyze electron transport when Hall measurements are difficult or inaccessible. Additionally, we show how the Pisarenko formula can be used to estimate the maximum power factor of a thermoelectric material from the weighted mobility of a single, not necessarily optimized, sample at any given temperature.

Title: Dendrite Suppression in Zn Batteries Through Hetero-Epitaxial Residual Stresses Shield
Authors: Musanna Galib, Amardeep Amardeep, Jian Liu, Mauricio Ponga
Abstract: Dendrite formation is a long-standing problem for the commercial application of aqueous zinc (Zn)-ion batteries (AZIB). Here, we investigate the effect of hetero-epitaxial residual stresses due to layered coatings on dendrite suppression. We found that atomic and molecular layered coatings can substantially reduce dendritic growth in AZIB by providing shielding due to residual stresses, even at single and a few layers of coatings. Through a combined experimental and numerical approach, we demonstrate that the residual stresses developed due to the coating of the Zn anodes significantly reduced the chemical potential polarization around dendrite embryos, forcing the deposition of zinc in the regions adjacent to the protuberances. This, in turn, results in a slower rate of dendritic growth, and eventually, dendrite suppression. The fundamental understanding of the effect of residual stresses due to coatings demonstrated herein can be extended to various metal anode batteries such as Li or Na.

Title: Unifying shear thinning behaviors of meso-scaled particle suspensions
Authors: Yuan Lin, Peiwen Lin, Yixuan Liang, Dingyi Pan
Abstract: The rheology of suspensions with meso-scaled particles [with size of $O(10^2)\ \text{nm}$ to $O(10)\ \mu\text{m}$] is intriguing since significant non-Newtonian behaviors are widely observed although the thermal fluctuation (Brownain motion) of the meso-scaled particles is negligible. Here, we show that the linear constitutive relation for such systems fails due to a flow-induced particle aggregation, which originates from the inherent inter-particle interactions, e.g., the weakly adhesive van der Waals interaction. This accounts for the temporal evolution of the rheological property in both steady and oscillatory shear flows. A dimensionless number that measures the importance of the hydrodynamic interaction in shear flow with respect to the inter-particle interaction, {is} proposed, through which the non-linear constitutive relation for suspensions with various particle sizes, particle concentrations, as well as flow conditions could be unified. This investigation bridge \mdf{the gap between micro- and macro-scaled suspension systems} and make the rheology of the meso-scaled suspensions predictable.

Title: Oxygen sublattice disorder and valence state modulation in infinite-layer nickelate superlattices
Authors: R. A. Ortiz, N. Enderlein, K. Fürsich, R. Pons, P. Radhakrishnan, E. Schierle, P. Wochner, G. Logvenov, G. Cristiani, P. Hansmann, B. Keimer, E. Benckiser
Abstract: The family of infinite-layer nickelates promises important insights into the mechanism of unconventional superconductivity. Since superconductivity has so far only been observed in epitaxial thin films, heteroepitaxy with the substrate or a capping layer possibly plays an important role. Here, we use soft x-ray spectroscopy to investigate superlattices as a potential approach for a targeted material design of high-temperature superconductors. We observe modulations in valence state and oxygen coordination in topotactically reduced artificial superlattices with repeating interfaces between nickelate layers and layers of materials commonly used as substrates and capping layers. Our results show that depending on the interlayer material metallic conductivity akin to the parent infinite-layer compounds is achieved. Depth-resolved electronic structure measured by resonant x-ray reflectivity reveals a reconstructed ligand field and valence state at the interface, which is confined to one or two unit cells. The central layers show characteristics of monovalent nickel, but linear dichroism analysis reveals considerable disorder in the oxygen removal sites. We observe a quantitative correlation of this disorder with the interlayer material that is important for future modeling and design strategies.

Title: The Role of Tunneling Oxide in the Low Frequency Noise of Multi-level Silicon Nitride ReRAMs
Authors: Nikolaos Vasileiadis, Alexandros Mavropoulis, Christoforos Theodorou, Panagiotis Dimitrakis
Abstract: This research explores the characteristics of two CMOS-compatible RRAM cells utilizing silicon nitride as the switching material. By employing SET/RESET pulse sequences, the study successfully attains four distinct and stable resistance states. To gain deeper insights, a Low-Frequency Noise (LFN) statistical analysis is conducted to investigate the role of a tunneling oxide between the bottom electrode and SiNx at various resistance levels. The findings from the LFN measurements strongly suggest that the multilevel high resistance switching primarily arises from variations in the number of nitrogen vacancies, which in turn modulate the conductivity of conductive filaments (CF). Notably, this modulation does not compromise the quality of the filament's surrounding interface. This research sheds light on the underlying mechanisms of RRAM cells and their potential for advanced memory applications.

Title: Electric field tunable bands in doubly aligned bilayer graphene hBN moire superlattice
Authors: Priya Tiwari, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Aveek Bid
Abstract: In this letter, we demonstrate electric field-induced band modification of an asymmetrically twisted hBN/BLG/hBN supermoire lattice. Distinct from unaligned BLG/hBN systems, we observe regions in the density-displacement field (n-D) plane where the device conductance is independent of n and decreases as |D| increases. This distinction arises due to the angle asymmetry between the layers, which induces field-controlled layer polarization. We identify D-dependent additional band gaps near the charge neutrality point that appear in the conduction (valence) band for negative (positive) D values. In the quantum Hall regime, new 6-fold degenerate Landau levels are observed. Our findings establish that in an asymmetric supermoire heterostructure, an external vertical displacement field affects the valence and conduction bands very differently and sheds light on the asymmetric conductance patterns noted in previous studies.

Title: Memory-induced current reversal of Brownian motors
Authors: Mateusz Wiśniewski, Jakub Spiechowicz
Abstract: Kinetics of biological motors such as kinesin or dynein is notably influenced by viscoelastic intracellular environment. The characteristic relaxation time of the cytosol is not separable from the colloidal timescale and therefore their dynamics is inherently non-Markovian. In this paper we consider a variant of a Brownian motor model, namely a Brownian ratchet immersed in a correlated thermal bath and analyze how memory influences its dynamics. In particular, we demonstrate the memory-induced current reversal effect and explain this phenomenon by applying the effective mass approximation as well as uncovering the memory-induced dynamical localization of the motor trajectories in the phase space. Our results reveal new aspects of the role of memory in microscopic systems out of thermal equilibrium.

Title: Crystal tensor properties of magnetic materials with and without spin-orbit coupling. Application of spin point groups as approximate symmetries
Authors: Jesus Etxebarria, J. Manuel Perez-Mato, Emre S. Tasci, Luis Elcoro
Abstract: Spin space groups, formed by operations where the rotation of the spins is independent of the accompanying operation acting on the crystal structure, are appropriate groups to describe the symmetry of magnetic structures with null spin-orbit coupling. Their corresponding spin point groups are the symmetry groups to be considered for deriving the symmetry constraints on the form of the crystal tensor properties of such idealized structures. These groups can also be taken as approximate symmetries (with some restrictions) of real magnetic structures, where spin-orbit and magnetic anisotropy are however present. Here we formalize the invariance transformation properties that must satisfy the most important crystal tensors under a spin point group. This is done using modified Jahn symbols, which generalize those applicable to ordinary magnetic point groups [Gallego et al., Acta Cryst. (2019) A{\bf 75}, 438-447]. The analysis includes not only equilibrium tensors, but also transport, optical and non-linear optical susceptibility tensors. The constraints imposed by spin collinearity and coplanarity within the spin group formalism on a series of representative tensors are discussed and compiled. As illustrative examples, the defined tensor invariance equations have been applied to some known magnetic structures, showing the differences of the symmetry-adapted form of some relevant tensors, when considered under the constraints of its spin point group or its magnetic point group. This comparison, with the spin point group implying additional constraints in the tensor form, may allow to distinguish those magnetic-related properties that can be solely attributed to spin-orbit coupling from those that are expected to be present even under negligible spin-orbit effects.

Title: Phase diagram of the hard-sphere potential model in three and four dimensions using a pseudo-hard-sphere potential
Authors: Edwin A. Bedolla-Montiel, Ramón A. Castañeda-Cerdán, Ramón Castañeda-Priego
Abstract: The hard-sphere potential has become a cornerstone in the study of both molecular and complex fluids. Despite its mathematical simplicity, its implementation in fixed time-step molecular simulations remains a formidable challenge due to the discontinuity at contact. To circumvent the issues associated with the ill-defined force at contact, a continuous potential--referred to here as the pseudo-hard-sphere (pHS) potential--has recently been proposed [J. Chem, Phys. 149, 164907 (2018)]. This potential is constructed to match the second virial coefficient of the hard-sphere potential and is expected to mimic its thermodynamic properties. However, this hypothesis has only been partially validated within the fluid region of the phase diagram for hard-sphere dispersions in two and three dimensions. In this contribution, we examine the ability of the continuous pHS potential to reproduce the equation of state of a hard-sphere fluid, not only in the fluid phase but also across the fluid-solid coexistence region. Our focus is primarily on hard-sphere systems in three and four dimensions. We compare the results obtained from Brownian dynamics simulations of the pHS potential with those derived from refined event-driven simulations of the corresponding hard-sphere potential. Furthermore, we provide a comparative analysis with theoretical equations of state based on both mean-field and integral equation approximations.

Title: Raman signature of multiple phase transitions and quasi-particle excitations in putative Kitaev spin liquid candidate Na2Co2TeO6
Authors: Atul G. Chakkar, Chaitanya B. Auti, Deepu Kumar, Nirmalya Jana, Koushik Pal, Pradeep Kumar
Abstract: Two-dimensional cobalt-based honeycomb oxide Na2Co2TeO6 is an important candidate for the realization of Kitaev physics and may provide future platform for the quantum computation and quantum technology. Here, we report an in-depth temperature as well as polarization dependent inelastic light scattering (Raman) measurements on the single crystals of quasi-two-dimensional Na2Co2TeO6. Our study reveal signature of multiple phase transitions i.e. long-range zigzag antiferromagnetic transition (TN) at ~ 30 K, ferroelectric transition (TFE) at ~ 70 K, and a crossover from pure paramagnetic phase to a quantum paramagnetic phase around ~ 150 K reflected in the renormalized self-energy parameters of the Raman active phonon modes. A distinct signature of spin reorientation deep into the AFM phase around TSR ~ 17 K is observed, marked by the clear change in the frequency and linewidth slopes. We also observed an asymmetric phonon mode in the low frequency region, and it appears below the transition temperature ~ 50 K, attributed to the magnetic excitations other than the magnon. The Raman signature of multiple crystal-field excitations at low temperature along with lifting of the Kramers degeneracy is also observed. Signature of the underlying broad magnetic continuum in the quantum paramagnetic phase and its temperature dependence suggest presence of frustrated magnetic interaction in the quantum paramagnetic phase below ~ 150 K.

Title: Triple-Q state in magnetic breathing kagome lattice
Authors: Hangyu Zhou, Manuel dos Santos Dias, Shijian Bao, Hanchen Lu, Youguang Zhang, Weisheng Zhao, Samir Lounis
Abstract: Magnetic frustration in two-dimensional spin lattices with triangular motifs underpins a series of exotic states, ranging from multi-Q configurations to disordered spin-glasses. The antiferromagnetic kagome lattice, characterized by its network of corner-sharing triangles, represents a paradigmatic frustrated system exhibiting macroscopic degeneracy. Expanding upon the kagomerization mechanism, we focus on the magnetic breathing kagome lattice formed by a Mn monolayer deposited on a heavy metal substrate and capped with h-BN. The Mn kagome arrangement induces pronounced magnetic frustration, as evidenced by the nearly flat bands derived from spin spiral energy calculations. Including further-neighbor interactions reveals a spin spiral energy minimum along the $\Gamma$-K line and an intriguing triple-Q state with nonzero topological charge, potentially leading to highly nonlinear Hall effects. Furthermore, the flat band properties can further give rise to an even more complex spin configuration, marked by several Q-pockets in the spin structure factor. These results present a fertile ground for advancing the study of multi-Q states and exploring emergent topological phenomena.

Title: Photoluminescence Features of Few-Layer Hexagonal $\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$

Abstract: Indium (III) selenide is currently one of the most actively studied materials in the two-dimensional family due to its remarkable ferroelectric and optical properties. This study focuses on the luminescent properties of few-layer In$_2$Se$_3$ flakes with thicknesses ranging from 7 to 100 monolayers. To explore the photoluminescence features and correlate them with changes in crystal symmetry and surface potential, we employed a combination of techniques, including temperature-dependent micro-photoluminescence, time-resolved photoluminescence, Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, and Kelvin probe force microscopy. X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy confirmed that the samples studied possess the $\alpha$-polytype structure. The micro-photoluminescence spectrum consists of two bands, A and B, with band B almost completely disappearing at room temperature. Temperature-dependent photoluminescence and time-resolved measurements helped us to elucidate the nature of the observed bands. We find that peak A is associated with emission from interband transitions in In$_2$Se$_3$, while peak B is attributed to defect-related emission. Additionally, the photoluminescence decay times of In$_2$Se$_3$ flakes with varying thicknesses were determined. No significant changes were observed in the decay components as the thickness increased from 7 to 100 monolayers, suggesting that there are no qualitative changes in the band structure.

Title: Boosting superconductivity: how nanofaceted surfaces transform the ground state of ultrathin YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ thin films
Authors: E. Wahlberg, R. Arpaia, D. Chakraborty, A. Kalaboukhov, D. Vignolles, C. Proust, A. M. Black-Shaffer, G. Seibold, T. Bauch, F. Lombardi
Abstract: In the cuprate high-temperature superconductors doping is fixed during synthesis and the charge carrier density per CuO$_2$ plane cannot be easily tuned by conventional gating, unlike 2D materials. Strain engineering has recently emerged as a powerful tuning knob for manipulating the properties of cuprates, in particular charge and spin orders, and their delicate interplay with superconductivity. In thin films, additional tunability can be introduced by the substrate surface morphology, particularly nanofacets formed by substrate surface reconstruction. Here we show a remarkable enhancement of the superconducting onset temperature $T_{\mathrm{c}}^{\mathrm{on}}$ and the upper critical magnetic field $H_{c,2}$ in nanometer-thin YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ films grown on a substrate with a nanofaceted surface. We theoretically show that the enhancement is driven by electronic nematicity and unidirectional charge density waves, where both elements are captured by an additional effective potential at the interface between the film and the uniquely textured substrate. Our findings show a new paradigm in which substrate engineering can effectively enhance the superconducting properties of cuprates. This approach opens an exciting frontier in the design and optimization of high-performance superconducting materials.

Title: Simulation of the thermocapillary assembly of a colloidal cluster during the evaporation of a liquid film in an unevenly heated cell
Authors: Kristina N. Kondrashova, Konstantin S. Kolegov, Irina V. Vodolazskaya
Abstract: The control of the thermocapillary assembly of colloidal particle clusters is important for a variety of applications, including the creation of photonic crystals for microelectronics and optoelectronics, membrane formation for biotechnology, and surface cleaning for laboratory-on-chip devices. It is important to understand the main mechanisms that influence the formation of such clusters. This article considers a two-dimensional mathematical model describing the transfer of particles by a thermocapillary flow in an unevenly heated cell during the evaporation of a liquid. This gave us the opportunity to study one of the main processes that triggers the formation of a particle cluster. Whether the particle will move with the flow or stop at the heater, becoming the basis for the cluster, is determined by the ratio between gravity and the drag force. The results of numerical calculations show that, for small particle concentrations, their fraction entering the cluster decreases as the volumetric heat flux density $Q$ increases. The reason for this is an increase in the thermocapillary flow with an increase in the volumetric heat flux $Q$. It reduces the probability of particles entering the cluster.

Title: Quantifying Ionic Liquid Affinity and Its Effect on Phospholipid Membrane Structure and Dynamics
Authors: V. K. Sharma, J. Gupta, H. Srinivasan, P. Hitaishi, S. K. Ghosh, S. Mitra
Abstract: In this study, we examine the impact of imidazolium based ILs on the viscoelasticity, dynamics, and phase behavior of two model membrane systems, (i) lipid monolayers and (ii) unilamellar vesicles composed of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC). Our findings demonstrate that both ILs induce significant disorder in lipid membranes by altering the area per lipid molecule, thereby modulating their viscoelastic properties. ILs with longer alkyl chains show stronger interactions with membranes, causing more pronounced disorder. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicates that IL incorporation shifts the membrane main phase transition to lower temperatures and introduces gauche defects, signifying increased structural disorder. This effect is amplified with longer alkyl chains and higher IL concentrations. Quasielastic neutron scattering studies highlight that ILs markedly enhance the lateral diffusion of lipids within the membrane leaflet, with the extent of enhancement determined by the membrane physical state, IL concentration, and alkyl chain length. The most pronounced acceleration in lateral diffusion occurs in ordered membrane phase with higher concentrations of the longer chain IL. Molecular dynamics simulations corroborate these experimental findings, showing that longer chain ILs extensively disrupt lipid organization, introduce more gauche defects, increase the area per lipid, and consequently enhance lateral diffusion. This increase in lipid fluidity and permeability provides a mechanistic basis for the observed higher toxicity associated with longer chain ILs.

Title: Search for Stable States in Two-Body Excitations of the Hubbard Model on the Honeycomb Lattice
Authors: Petar Sinilkov, Evan Berkowitz, Thomas Luu, Marcel Rodekamp
Abstract: We present one- and two-body measurements for the Hubbard model on the honeycomb (graphene) lattice from ab-initio quantum monte carlo simulations. Of particular interest is excitons, which are particle/hole excitations in low-dimensional systems. They are analogous to the pion in QCD, but without confinement, the question of whether they are bound and stable is of great interest in the condensed matter arena. By measuring one- and two-body correlators across various spin and isospin channels we can compute two-body energies relative to their thresholds, ultimately allowing us to check for stable states.

Title: Spontaneous helix formation in polar smectic phase
Authors: Ewa Gorecka, Magdalena Majewska, Ladislav Fekete, Jakub Karcz, Julia Żukowska, Jakub Herman Przemysław Kula, Damian Pociecha
Abstract: In soft ferroelectric crystals, the depolarization field can be reduced by periodic distortion of the polarization direction. In the polar nematic and tilted smectic phases, this process is energetically favorured , as it only requires changes in the director orientation. We demonstrate the spontaneous formation of a helical structure in the proper ferroelectric tilted smectic (SmCTBF) phase, the phase is formed below the heliconical polar nematic (NTBF) phase. The helical pitch in the smectic phase is approximately 600 nm and remains nearly constant across the entire temperature range of the phase. Under weak electric fields, the helix reorients while its structure remains largely intact; however, in stronger fields, the helix is destroyed as the electric polarization aligns along the electric field.

Title: Non-renormalization of the fractional quantum Hall conductivity by interactions
Authors: M. Selch, M.A.Zubkov, Souvik Pramanik, M.Lewkowicz
Abstract: We investigate the theory of the fractional quantum Hall effect (QHE) proposed a long time ago by Lopez and Fradkin \cite{Fradkin1991chern}. The magnetic fluxes of the statistical gauge field attached to electrons remain at rest in the reference frame moving together with the electron liquid. In the laboratory reference frame the electric field of the statistical gauge field forms and screens the external electric field. The fractional QHE conductivity appears as a consequence of this screening already on the mean field theory level. We consider a relativistic extension of the model, and propose an alternative description of the fractional QHE based on macroscopic motion of the electron liquid within the Zubarev statistical operator approach. It is this macroscopic motion of electrons which in this pattern gives rise to the fractional QHE. Within this approach we propose the proof to all orders of perturbation theory that the interaction corrections cannot change the above mentioned mean field theory result for the QHE conductivity.

Title: Atomically Thin Metallenes at the Edge
Authors: Kameyab Raza Abidi, Mohammad Bagheri, Sukhbir Singh, Pekka Koskinen
Abstract: Atomically thin metallenes are a new family of materials representing the ultimate limit of a thin free-electron gas for novel applications. Although metallene research has gained traction, limited attention has been paid to the properties of their ubiquitous edges. Here, we use density-functional theory simulations to investigate various edges of Mg, Cu, Y, Au, and Pb metallenes with hexagonal and buckled honeycomb lattices. Investigating relaxations, energies, stresses, and electronic structures at the edge, we find that some properties have clear trends while others are sensitive to both element and lattice type. Given that edge properties are fundamental to metallene stability and interactions in lateral heterostructures, their detailed understanding will help guide the development of metallene synthesis and applications.

Title: Exploring Group Convolutional Networks for Sign Problem Mitigation via Contour Deformation
Authors: Christoph Gäntgen, Thomas Luu, Marcel Rodekamp
Abstract: The sign problem that arises in Hybrid Monte Carlo calculations can be mitigated by deforming the integration manifold. While simple transformations are highly efficient for simulation, their efficacy systematically decreases with decreasing temperature and increasing interaction. Machine learning models have demonstrated the ability to push further, but require additional computational effort and upfront training. While neural networks possess the capacity to learn physical symmetries through proper training, there are anticipated advantages associated with encoding them into the network's structure. These include enhanced accuracy, accelerated training, and improved stability. The objective of the present study is twofold. First, we investigate the benefits of group convolutional models in comparison to fully connected networks, with a specific focus on the effects on the sign problem and on computational aspects. Second, we examine their capabilities for transfer learning, demonstrating the ability to further reduce training cost. We perform our investigations on the Hubbard model on select low-dimensional systems.

Title: An inelastic neutron scattering study of the magnetic field dependence of the quantum dipolar garnet: Yb$_3$Ga$_5$O$_{12}$
Authors: Edward Riordan, Monica Ciomaga Hatnean, Geetha Balakrishnan, Kim Lefmann, Jacques Ollivier, Stephane Raymond, Elsa Lhotel, and Pascale P. Deen
Abstract: The garnet compound Yb$_3$Ga$_5$O$_{12}$ is a fascinating material that is considered highly suitable for low-temperature refrigeration, via the magnetocaloric effect, in addition to enabling the exploration of quantum states with long-range dipolar interactions. It has previously been theorized that the magnetocaloric effect can be enhanced, in Yb$_3$Ga$_5$O$_{12}$ , via magnetic soft mode excitations which in the hyperkagome structure would be derived from an emergent magnetic structure formed from nanosized 10-spin loops. We study the magnetic field dependence of bands of magnetic soft mode excitations in the effective spin $S = 1/2$ hyperkagome compound Yb$_3$Ga$_5$O$_{12}$ using single crystal inelastic neutron scattering. We probe the magnetically short ranged ordered state, in which we determine magnetic nanoscale structures coexisting with a fluctuating state, and the magnetically saturated state. We determine that Yb$_3$Ga$_5$O$_{12}$ can be described as a quantum dipolar magnet with perturbative weak near-neighbor and inter-hyperkagome exchange interaction. The magnetic excitations, under the application of a magnetic field, reveal highly robust soft modes with distinctive signatures of the quantum nature of the Yb3+ spins. Our results enhance our understanding of soft modes in topological frustrated magnets that drive both the unusual physics of quantum dipolar systems and future refrigerant material design.

Title: Search for stable and low-energy Ce-Co-Cu ternary compounds using machine learning
Authors: Weiyi Xia, Wei-Shen Tee, Paul Canfield, Rebecca Flint, Cai-Zhuang Wang
Abstract: Cerium-based intermetallics have garnered significant research attention as potential new permanent magnets. In this study, we explore the compositional and structural landscape of Ce-Co-Cu ternary compounds using a machine learning (ML)-guided framework integrated with first-principles calculations. We employ a crystal graph convolutional neural network (CGCNN), which enables efficient screening for promising candidates, significantly accelerating the materials discovery process. With this approach, we predict five stable compounds, Ce3Co3Cu, CeCoCu2, Ce12Co7Cu, Ce11Co9Cu and Ce10Co11Cu4, with formation energies below the convex hull, along with hundreds of low-energy (possibly metastable) Ce-Co-Cu ternary compounds. First-principles calculations reveal that several structures are both energetically and dynamically stable. Notably, two Co-rich low-energy compounds, Ce4Co33Cu and Ce4Co31Cu3, are predicted to have high magnetizations.

Title: Octagonal tilings with three prototiles
Authors: April Lynne D. Say-awen, Sam Coates
Abstract: Motivated by theoretically and experimentally observed structural phases with octagonal symmetry, we introduce a family of octagonal tilings which are composed of three prototiles. We define our tilings with respect to two non-negative integers, $m$ and $n$, so that the inflation factor of a given tiling is $\delta_{(m,n)}=m+n (1+\sqrt{2})$. As such, we show that our family consists of an infinite series of tilings which can be delineated into separate `cases' which are determined by the relationship between $m$ and $n$. Similarly, we present the primitive substitution rules or decomposition of our prototiles, along with the statistical properties of each case, demonstrating their dependence on these integers.

Title: Unveiling three types of fermions in a nodal ring topological semimetal through magneto-optical transitions
Authors: Jiwon Jeon, Taehyeok Kim, Jiho Jang, Hoil Kim, Mykhaylo Ozerov, Jun Sung Kim, Hongki Min, Eunjip Choi
Abstract: We investigate the quasiparticles of a single nodal ring semimetal SrAs$_3$ through axis-resolved magneto-optical measurements. We observe three types of Landau levels scaling as $\varepsilon \sim \sqrt{B}$, $\varepsilon \sim B^{2/3}$, and $\varepsilon \sim B$ that correspond to Dirac, semi-Dirac, and classical fermions, respectively. Through theoretical analysis, we identify the distinct origins of these three types of fermions present within the nodal ring. In particular, semi-Dirac fermions--a novel type of fermion that can give rise to a range of unique quantum phenomena--emerge from the endpoints of the nodal ring where the energy band disperses linearly along one direction and quadratically along the perpendicular direction, a feature not achievable in nodal point or line structures. The capacity of the nodal ring to simultaneously host multiple fermion types, including semi-Dirac fermions, establishes it as a valuable platform to expand the understanding of topological semimetals.

Title: Leading and beyond leading-order spectral form factor in chaotic quantum many-body systems across all Dyson symmetry classes
Authors: Vijay Kumar, Tomaž Prosen, Dibyendu Roy
Abstract: We show the emergence of random matrix theory (RMT) spectral correlations in the chaotic phase of generic periodically kicked interacting quantum many-body systems by analytically calculating spectral form factor (SFF), $K(t)$, up to two leading orders in time, $t$. We explicitly consider the presence or absence of time reversal ($\mathcal{T}$) symmetry to investigate all three Dyson's symmetry classes. Our derivation only assumes random phase approximation to enable ensemble average. For $\mathcal{T}$-invariant systems with $\mathcal{T}^2=1$, we show that beyond the Thouless time $t^*$, the SFF takes the form $K(t)\simeq 2t-2t^2/\mathcal{N}$ up to second order in time, where $\mathcal{N}$ is the Hilbert space dimension. This is identical to the result from circular orthogonal ensemble of RMT. In the absence of $\mathcal{T}$-symmetry, we show that $K(t)\simeq t$ beyond $t^*$, and there is no universal term in the second order, unlike the $\mathcal{T}^2=1$ case, in agreement with the result of circular unitary ensemble. For $\mathcal{T}$-invariant systems with $\mathcal{T}^2=-1$, we show that $K(t)\simeq 2t+2t^2/\mathcal{N}$ up to two orders in time beyond $t^*$, in agreement with the result of circular symplectic ensemble. In all three cases, the system-size, $L$, scaling of $t^*$ is determined by eigenvalues of a doubly stochastic matrix $\mathcal{M}$. For strongly interacting fermionic chains, $\mathcal{M}$ is $SU(2)$ invariant in all three cases, leading to $t^*\propto L^2$ in the presence of $U(1)$ symmetry. In the absence of $U(1)$ symmetry, we find $t^*\propto L^0$, due to gapped non-degenerate second-largest eigenvalue of $\mathcal{M}$ or $t^*\propto \ln(L)$ due to gapped second-largest eigenvalue with degeneracy $\propto L^\zeta$. Our calculation of SFF is plausible in higher space dimensions as well, where similar system-size scalings of $t^*$ can be obtained.

Title: Continuously varying critical exponents in an exactly solvable long-range cluster XY mode
Authors: Tian-Cheng Yi, Chengxiang Ding, Maoxin Liu, Liangsheng Li, Wen-Long You
Abstract: We investigate a generalized antiferromagnetic cluster XY model in a transverse magnetic field, where long-range interactions decay algebraically with distance. This model can be exactly solvable within a free fermion framework. By analyzing the gap, we explicitly derive the critical exponents $\nu$ and $z$, finding that the relationship $\nu z = 1$ still holds. However, the values of $\nu$ and $z$ depend on the decaying exponent $\alpha$, in contrast to those for the quantum long-range antiferromagnetic Ising chain. To optimize scaling behavior, we verify these critical exponents using correlation functions and fidelity susceptibility, achieving excellent data collapse across various system sizes by adjusting fitting parameters. Finally, we compute the entanglement entropy at the critical point to determine the central charge $c$, and find it also varies with $\alpha$. This study provides insights into the unique effect of long-range cluster interactions on the critical properties of quantum spin systems.

Title: Temperature dependent energy gap for Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states at the quantum phase transition
Authors: Andreas Theiler, Christian R. Ast, Annica M. Black-Schaffer
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments, which allow for fine tuning of the effective magnetic interaction between the impurity and the superconductor, we investigate the regime around the quantum phase transition where the system's ground state changes from a weakly coupled free spin to a screened spin regime. At this transition we find that the YSR states remain at finite energies at low temperatures, thereby generating a gap in the spectrum, which is inconsistent with predictions of the original YSR theory. We investigate various gap-generating scenarios and determine that the local suppression of the order parameter, only captured by self-consistent calculations, generates the gap.

Title: Pressure suppresses the density wave order in kagome metal LuNb$_6$Sn$_6$
Authors: William R. Meier, David E. Graf, Brenden R. Ortiz, Shirin Mozaffari, David Mandrus
Abstract: Dancing tins pair up, But compressing the framework Thwarts the displacements. The density waves that develop in kagome metals ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ and LuNb$_6$Sn$_6$ at low temperature appear to arise from under-filled atomic columns within a V-Sn or Nb-Sn scaffolding. Compressing this network with applied pressure in ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ suppressed the structural transition temperature by constraining atomic rattling and inhibiting the shifts that define the structural modulation. We predicted that the density wave transition in LuNb$_6$Sn$_6$ at 68 K would be suppressed by pressure as well. In this brief study we examine the pressure dependence of the density wave transition by remeasuring resistance vs temperature up to 2.26 GPa. We found the transition temperature is smoothly depressed and disappears around 1.9 GPa. This result not only addresses our prediction, but strengthens the rattling chains origin of structural instabilities in the HfFe$_6$Ge$_6$-type kagome metals.

Title: Large Negative Magnetoresistance in off-Stochiometric Topological Material PrSbTe
Authors: Gokul Acharya, Krishna Pandey, M.M. Sharma, Jian Wang, Santosh Karki Chhetri, Md Rafique Un Nabi, Dinesh Upreti, Rabindra Basnet, Josh Sakon, Jin Hu
Abstract: Magnetic topological materials LnSbTe (Ln = lanthanide) have attracted intensive attention because of the presence of interplay between magnetism, topological, and electron correlations depending on the choices of magnetic Ln elements. Varying Sb and Te composition is an efficient approach to control structural, magnetic, and electronic properties. Here we report the composition-dependent properties in PrSbxTe2-x. We identified the tetragonal-to-orthorhombic structure transitions in this material system, and very large negative magnetoresistance in the x = 0.3 composition, which might be ascribed to the coupling between magnetism and transport. Such unusual magnetotransport enables PrSbxTe2-x topological materials as a promising platform for device applications.

Title: Phonon spectra, quantum geometry, and the Goldstone theorem
Authors: Guglielmo Pellitteri, Guido Menichetti, Andrea Tomadin, Haoyu Hu, Yi Jiang, B. Andrei Bernevig, Marco Polini
Abstract: Phonons are essential (quasi)particles of all crystals and play a key role in fundamental properties such as thermal transport and superconductivity. In particular, acoustic phonons can be viewed as the Goldstone modes arising from the spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry. In this article, we present a comprehensive - in the absence of Holstein phonons - theory of the quantum geometric contributions to the phonon spectra of crystals. Using graphene as a case study, we separate the dynamical matrix into several terms that depend differently on the electron energy and wavefunction, and demonstrate that the quantum geometric effects are crucial in shaping the phonon spectra of the material. Neglecting them leads to a gap in the acoustic phonon branches, which clearly violates the Goldstone theorem.

Title: Josephson coupling in Lanthanum-based cuprates superlattices
Authors: Halima Giovanna Ahmad, Davide Massarotti, Francesco Tafuri, Gennady Logvenov, Antonio Bianconi, Gaetano Campi
Abstract: In most anisotropic compounds such as bismuth-based layered cuprate perovskites, the supercurrent across the blocking layer is of Josephson type, and a single crystal forms a natural stack of Josephson junctions. Here, we report on the evidence of Josephson-like transport in an artificial cuprate superlattice composed of 10 LaSrCuO-LaCuO repeats, creating a superlattice of junctions, where LCO is a superconducting Mott insulator and LSCO an overdoped metal, respectively. The superlattice has been designed with a long period d = L+W = 5.28 nm, with L and W the thickness of LCO and LSCO units, respectively, and is in the underdoped regime with an average doping level < {\delta} >= 0.11. Quantum-size effects and Rashba spin-orbit coupling are controlled by L/d = 0.75, with a quasi-2D superconducting transition temperature of 41 K and a c-axis coherence length of about 1.5 nm. Measurements at very low temperatures show evidence of Josephson phase dynamics consistent with very low Josephson coupling and a phase diffusion regime, thus explaining why Josephson coupling in LSCO superlattices has been so elusive. The tuning of LSCO superlattices in the Josephson regime enriches the phase diagram of HTS.

Title: Anderson insulator-based cryogenic photonic thermal amplifiers
Authors: Matteo Pioldi, Giorgio De Simoni, Alessandro Braggio, Francesco Giazotto
Abstract: A photonic heat amplifier (PHA) designed for cryogenic operations is introduced and analyzed. This device comprises two Anderson insulator reservoirs connected by lossless lines, allowing them to exchange heat through photonic modes. This configuration enables negative differential thermal conductance (NDTC), which can be harnessed to amplify thermal signals. To achieve this, we maintain one reservoir at a high temperature, serving as the source terminal of a thermal transistor. Concurrently, in the other one, we establish tunnel contacts to metallic reservoirs, which function as the gate and drain terminals. With this arrangement, it is possible to control the heat flux exchange between the source and drain by adjusting the gate temperature. We present two distinct parameter choices that yield different performances: the first emphasizes modulating the source-drain heat current, while the second focuses on the temperature modulation of the colder Anderson insulator. Lastly, we present a potential design variation in which all electronic reservoirs are thermally connected through only photonic modes, allowing interactions between distant elements. The proposal of the PHA addresses the lack of thermal transistors and amplifiers in the mK range while being compatible with the rich toolbox of circuit quantum electrodynamics. It can be adapted to various applications, including sensing and developing thermal circuits and control devices at sub-Kelvin temperatures, which are relevant to quantum technologies.

Title: The effect of Carrier Doping and Thickness on the Electronic Structures of La$3$Ni$2$O$7$ Thin Films
Authors: Haoliang Shi, Zihao Huo, Guanlin Li, Hao Ma, Tian Cui, Dao-Xin Yao, Defang Duan
Abstract: Recently, the superconductivity of bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7 has been observed in the thin film at ambient pressure, facilitated by epitaxial strain. Here, we investigate the effects of film thickness and carrier doping on the electronic structure of La3Ni2O7 thin films with thickness of 0.5-3 unit cells (UC) using first-principles calculations. At an optimal doping concentration of 0.4 holes per formula unit for 2UC film, the Ni-"d" _("z" ^"2" ) interlayer bonding state metallizes, leading to the formation of {\gamma} pockets at the Fermi surface, which quantitatively matches the experimental results of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). These findings provide theoretical support for recent experimental observations of ambient-pressure superconductivity in La3Ni2O7 thin films and highlight the crucial role of film thickness and carrier doping in modulating electronic properties.

Title: Isolating the hard core of phaseless inference: the Phase selection formulation
Authors: Davide Straziota, Luca Saglietti
Abstract: Real-valued Phase retrieval is a non-convex continuous inference problem, where a high-dimensional signal is to be reconstructed from a dataset of signless linear measurements. Focusing on the noiseless case, we aim to disentangle the two distinct sub-tasks entailed in the Phase retrieval problem: the hard combinatorial problem of retrieving the missing signs of the measurements, and the nested convex problem of regressing the input-output observations to recover the hidden signal. To this end, we introduce and analytically characterize a two-level formulation of the problem, called ``Phase selection''. Within the Replica Theory framework, we perform a large deviation analysis to characterize the minimum mean squared error achievable with different guesses for the hidden signs. Moreover, we study the free-energy landscape of the problem when both levels are optimized simultaneously, as a function of the dataset size. At low temperatures, in proximity to the Bayes-optimal threshold -- previously derived in the context of Phase retrieval -- we detect the coexistence of two free-energy branches, one connected to the random initialization condition and a second to the signal. We derive the phase diagram for a first-order transition after which the two branches merge. Interestingly, introducing an $L_2$ regularization in the regression sub-task can anticipate the transition to lower dataset sizes, at the cost of a bias in the signal reconstructions which can be removed by annealing the regularization intensity. Finally, we study the inference performance of three meta-heuristics in the context of Phase selection: Simulated Annealing, Approximate Message Passing, and Langevin Dynamics on the continuous relaxation of the sign variables. With simultaneous annealing of the temperature and the $L_2$ regularization, they are shown to approach the Bayes-optimal sample efficiency.

Title: Mutual Multilinearity of Nonequilibrium Network Currents
Authors: Sara Dal Cengio, Pedro E. Harunari, Vivien Lecomte, Matteo Polettini
Abstract: Continuous-time Markov chains have been successful in modelling systems across numerous fields, with currents being fundamental entities that describe the flows of energy, particles, individuals, chemical species, information, or other quantities. They apply to systems described by agents transitioning between vertices along the edges of a network (at some rate in each direction). It has recently been shown by the authors that, at stationarity, a hidden linearity exists between currents that flow along edges: if one controls the current of a specific "input" edge (by tuning transition rates along it), any other current is a linear-affine function of the input current [PRL 133, 047401 (2024)]. In this paper, we extend this result to the situation where one controls the currents of several edges, and prove that other currents are in linear-affine relation with the input ones. Two proofs with distinct insights are provided: the first relies on Kirchhoff's current law and reduces the input set inductively through graph analysis, while the second utilizes the resolvent approach via a Laplace transform in time. We obtain explicit expressions for the current-to-current susceptibilities, which allow one to map current dependencies through the network. We also verify from our expression that Kirchhoff's current law is recovered as a limiting case of our mutual linearity. Last, we uncover that susceptibilities can be obtained from fluctuations when the reference system is originally at equilibrium.

Title: Site-engineered ferromagnetism in Ca and Cr co-substituted Bismuth Ferrite Nanoparticles
Authors: Mehedi Hasan Prince, Abrar Daiyan, Troyee Mitra Aishi, Anika Rahman Riya, Md. Fakhrul Islam, Md. Abdullah Zubair, Takian Fakhrul
Abstract: Multiferroic perovskites that exhibit room temperature magnetization and polarization have immense potential in the next generation of magneto-electric and spintronic memory devices. In this work, the magnetic and ferroelectric properties of Bismuth Ferrite, BiFeO3 (BFO) nanoparticles (NPs) were enhanced through simultaneous A and B site Ca and Cr co-substitution. Novel compositions of Bi0.97Ca0.03CrxFe1-xO3 (x=0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05) were synthesized using the sol-gel route and annealed at 550 degrees Celcius. Rietveld Refinement of XRD patterns confirmed high phase purity, while SEM analysis revealed a decreasing trend in average particle size with increasing dopant concentration. Hysteresis loops showed enhanced magnetic properties as particle size approached the spin cycloid wavelength (around 62 nm), disrupting the intrinsic antiferromagnetic ordering of BFO. Moreover, the presence of exchange bias in the NPs was linked to the formation of core-shell structure. Temperature dependent magnetization studies showed an increase in Néel temperature upon Ca substitution. XPS analysis confirmed that Bi0.97Ca0.03FeO3 samples exhibited the highest oxygen vacancy concentration, while Fe3+ remained the dominant oxidation state across all compositions. Ferroelectric polarization loop measurements showed enhanced remanent polarization in doped samples, with leakage linked to oxygen vacancies and extrinsic microstructural effects.

Title: Shape-asymmetry and flexibility in active cross-stream migration in nonuniform shear
Authors: Derek C. Gomes, Tapan C. Adhyapak
Abstract: We show that the interplay of activity and broken fore-aft symmetry of shapes helps microswimmers to migrate across streamlines in nonuniform shear, emphasizing a hitherto overlooked fundamental cause of active cross-stream migration in imposed flows. Using a framework on model flagellated microswimmers in a microchannel flow, we find that besides the broken head-tail shape symmetry, extended hydrodynamic coupling is vital for cross-stream migration, whereas flagellar flexibility significantly affects the same. Furthermore, by simplifying the problem to a basic analytical model, we are able to identify the fundamental factors affecting the observed rich nonlinear dynamics and predict the sorting and control of microswimmer populations inside a microchannel. Our predictions are general and apply to both living and artificial microswimmers, whereas the hydrodynamic framework developed here is necessary to probe other scenarios, such as in dense suspensions, where non-uniform shear and near-field flows become important.

Title: Non-unitary time dynamics of topological modes in open planar quantum systems
Authors: Saakshi Porwal, Bitan Roy
Abstract: Nontrivial topological invariant of bulk electronic wavefunctions in two-dimensional quantum crystals leaves its footprints on the edge, dislocation, and corner modes. Here we investigate non-unitary time dynamics of these topological modes in square lattice-based open quantum systems in which the time-dependent Hamiltonian smoothly interpolates between topologically distinct insulators across band gap closing quantum critical points. The temporal dynamics of these modes is described by a Lindblad equation in which the instantaneous Hamiltonian plays the role of the Lindblad operator, thereby allowing the environment to couple with the system through the energy channels (weak measurement protocol). We show that in the presence of such a real time ramp, the survival probability of these modes decreases (increases) in short (long) time scale where the dephasing (quantum Zeno) effect dominates with the increasing amplitude of the system-to-environment coupling, for both slow and fast ramps from a topological to a normal insulating state. For a reverse course of the time evolution, the revival or condensation probability of nucleating such topological modes, otherwise absent in the initial system, increases for stronger system-to-environment coupling. This phenomenon can be attributed to the strong decoherence of the initial mixed state among all the energy eigenstates of the final Hamiltonian which also includes the topological modes, causing their enhanced condensation probability. Our findings can be germane to real open topological materials with time-tunable band gap, and should be applicable to open topological crystals of arbitrary dimension and belonging to any symmetry class.

Title: Shortcuts to Analog Preparation of Non-Equilibrium Quantum Lakes
Authors: Nik O. Gjonbalaj, Rahul Sahay, Susanne F. Yelin
Abstract: The dynamical preparation of exotic many-body quantum states is a persistent goal of analog quantum simulation, often limited by experimental coherence times. Recently, it was shown that fast, non-adiabatic Hamiltonian parameter sweeps can create finite-size ``lakes'' of quantum order in certain settings, independent of what is present in the ground state phase diagram. Here, we show that going further out of equilibrium via external driving can substantially accelerate the preparation of these quantum lakes. Concretely, when lakes can be prepared, existing counterdiabatic driving techniques -- originally designed to target the ground state -- instead naturally target the lakes state. We demonstrate this both for an illustrative single qutrit and a model of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Rydberg quantum spin liquid. In the latter case, we construct experimental drive sequences that accelerate preparation by almost an order of magnitude at fixed laser power. We conclude by using a Landau-Ginzburg model to provide a semi-classical picture for how our method accelerates state preparation.

Title: Soft gravitons as Goldstone modes of spontaneously broken asymptotic symmetries in de Sitter
Authors: Martin S. Sloth
Abstract: I demonstrate that soft graviton modes in de Sitter are the Goldstone modes of the spontaneously broken asymptotic symmetry group of de Sitter. I then show that any local measurement, including the effects of the environment, will collapse the symmetric state onto the broken state in the large volume limit. In any discussion involving observers, de Sitter is, therefore, best described globally by the broken phase, while local observers, in the small volume limit, can not discriminate between different degenerate global vacuum states, and are therefore best described by the symmetric state. This illuminates the physical nature of soft graviton modes in de Sitter.

Title: Sharp Page transitions in generic Hamiltonian dynamics
Authors: Lauren H. Li, Stefan Kehrein, Sarang Gopalakrishnan
Abstract: We consider the entanglement dynamics of a subsystem initialized in a pure state at high energy density (corresponding to negative temperature) and coupled to a cold bath. The subsystem's Rényi entropies $S_\alpha$ first rise as the subsystem gets entangled with the bath and then fall as the subsystem cools. We find that the peak of the min-entropy, $\lim_{\alpha \to \infty} S_\alpha$, sharpens to a cusp in the thermodynamic limit, at a well-defined time we call the Page time. We construct a hydrodynamic ansatz for the evolution of the entanglement Hamiltonian, which accounts for the sharp Page transition as well as the intricate dynamics of the entanglement spectrum before the Page time. Our results hold both when the bath has the same Hamiltonian as the system and when the bath is taken to be Markovian. Our ansatz suggests conditions under which the Page transition should remain sharp even for Rényi entropies of finite index $\alpha$.

Title: Generic Hilbert Space Fragmentation in Kogut--Susskind Lattice Gauge Theories
Authors: Anthony N. Ciavarella, Christian W. Bauer, Jad C. Halimeh
Abstract: At the heart of quantum many-body physics lies the understanding of mechanisms that avoid quantum thermalization in an isolated system quenched far from equilibrium. A prominent example is Hilbert space fragmentation, which has recently emerged as an ergodicity-breaking mechanism in constrained spin models. Here, we show that Kogut--Susskind formulations of lattice gauge theories in $d+1$D ($d$ spatial and one temporal dimensions) give rise to Hilbert space fragmentation, and discuss possible implications for understanding continuum physics. Our findings not only prove that lattice gauge theories are a natural platform for Hilbert space fragmentation, they also serve as a guide to the conditions under which these models can be faithfully used to infer the thermalization properties of quantum chromodynamics.

Title: Many-body non-Hermitian skin effect with exact steady states in dissipative lattice gauge theory
Authors: Yu-Min Hu, Zijian Wang, Biao Lian, Zhong Wang
Abstract: We introduce a dissipative lattice gauge model that exhibits the many-body version of the non-Hermitian skin effect. The dissipative couplings between dynamical gauge fields on the lattice links and the surrounding environment generate chiral motions of particles residing on lattice sites. Although the system involves many-body interactions, the local gauge symmetries offer a flexible approach to exactly constructing the steady state that demonstrates the many-body non-Hermitian skin effect. Furthermore, our approach can be generalized to realize a new type of many-body non-Hermitian skin effect, dubbed the hierarchical skin effect, where different subsystem degrees of freedom exhibit boundary accumulation of multiple moments at different orders. Our findings can be readily observed by engineering dissipation in state-of-the-art lattice gauge simulators.

Title: The anomalously slow dynamics of inhomogeneous quantum annealing
Authors: Mohammadhossein Dadgar, Christopher L. Baldwin
Abstract: Inhomogeneous quantum annealing (IQA), in which transverse fields are turned off one by one rather than simultaneously, has been proposed as an effective way to avoid the first-order phase transitions that impede conventional quantum annealing (QA). Here we explicitly study the dynamics of IQA, rather than merely the thermodynamics, and find that it is appreciably slower than the phase diagram would suggest. Interestingly, this slowdown manifests both when IQA succeeds in circumventing phase transitions and when it fails. Even in the absence of transitions, such as for the mean-field models that have been analyzed previously, IQA is slower than expected by a factor of the number of spins $N$. More significantly, we show that in non-mean-field models, first-order transitions are likely to be quite common, and the gap at such transitions is not merely exponential in $N$ but exactly zero. Thus IQA cannot reach the ground state on any timescale. Both of these results can be understood through the simple observation that a spin's magnetization becomes conserved once its field is turned off during the IQA protocol.

Title: Distributed Quantum Dynamics on Near-Term Quantum Processors
Authors: Vladyslav Bohun, Maxence Grandadam, Maciej Koch-Janusz
Abstract: Simulations of quantum dynamics are a key application of near term quantum computing, but are hindered by the twin challenges of noise and small device scale, which limit the executable circuit depths and the number of qubits the algorithm can be run on. Towards overcoming these obstacles we develop and implement a distributed variant of the projected Variational Quantum Dynamics which we dub dp-VQD, which allows to simultaneously alleviate circuit depth and width limitations. We employ the wire cutting technique, which can be executed on the existing devices without quantum or classical communication. We demonstrate the full variational training on noisy simulators, and execute and perform the reconstruction on real IBM quantum devices. The algorithm allows to execute Hamiltonian evolution simulations for problem sizes exceeding devices' nominal qubit counts, and to combine multiple small devices in a distributed computation. We test our approach on the Heisenberg and Hubbard model dynamics.

Title: Page Curve and Entanglement Dynamics in an Interacting Fermionic Chain
Authors: Rishabh Jha, Salvatore R. Manmana, Stefan Kehrein
Abstract: Generic non-equilibrium many-body systems display a linear growth of bipartite entanglement entropy in time, followed by a volume law saturation. In stark contrast, the Page curve dynamics of black hole physics shows that the entropy peaks at the Page time $t_{\text{Page}}$ and then decreases to zero. Here, we investigate such Page-like behavior of the von Neumann entropy in a model of strongly correlated spinless fermions in a typical system-environment setup, and characterize the properties of the Page curve dynamics in the presence of interactions using numerically exact matrix product states methods. The two phases of growth, namely the linear growth and the bending down, are shown to be separated by a non-analyticity in the min-entropy before $t_{\text{Page}}$, which separates two different quantum phases, realized as the respective ground states of the corresponding entanglement (or equivalently, modular) Hamiltonian. We confirm and generalize, by introducing interactions, the findings of \href{this https URL}{Phys. Rev. B 109, 224308 (2024)} for a free spinless fermionic chain where the corresponding entanglement Hamiltonian undergoes a quantum phase transition at the point of non-analyticity. However, in the presence of interactions, a scaling analysis gives a non-zero critical time for the non-analyticity in the thermodynamic limit only for weak to intermediate interaction strengths, while the dynamics leading to the non-analyticity becomes \textit{instantaneous} for interactions large enough. We present a physical picture explaining these findings.

Title: Topological phases of non-interacting systems: A general approach based on states
Authors: Giuseppe De Nittis
Abstract: In this work we provide a classification scheme for topological phases of certain systems whose observable algebra is described by a trivial $C^*$-bundles. The classification is based on the study of the homotopy classes of \emph{configurations}, which are maps from a \emph{quantum parameter space} to the space of pure states of a reference \emph{fiber} $C^*$-algebra. Both the quantum parameter space and the fiber algebra are naturally associated with the observable algebra. A list of various examples described in the last section shows that the common classification scheme of non-interacting topological insulators of type A is recovered inside this new formalism.

Title: Aging in coevolving voter models
Authors: Byungjoon Min, Maxi San Miguel
Abstract: Aging, understood as the tendency to remain in a given state the longer the persistence time in that state, plays a crucial role in the dynamics of complex systems. In this paper, we explore the influence of aging on coevolution models, that is, models in which the dynamics of the states of the nodes in a complex network is coupled to the dynamics of the structure of the network. In particular we consider the coevolving voter model, and we introduce two versions of this model that include aging effects: the Link Aging Model (LAM) and the Node Aging Model (NAM). In the LAM, aging is associated with the persistence time of a link in the evolving network, while in the NAM, aging is associated with the persistence time of a node in a given state. We show that aging significantly affects the absorbing phase transition of the coevolution voter model, shifting the transition point in opposite directions for the LAM and NAM. We also show that the generic absorbing phase transition can disappear due to aging effects.

Title: Experimental validation of the diverse incident angle performance of a pulse-width-dependent antenna based on a waveform-selective metasurface in a reverberation chamber
Authors: Kaito Ozawa, Hiroki Wakatsuchi
Abstract: We present experimental validation results of a pulse-width-dependent antenna based on a waveform-selective metasurface that behaves differently according to the incoming waveform, more specifically, the incoming pulse width, even at a fixed frequency. This waveform-selective behavior is integrated with an antenna design to preferentially accept a predetermined incoming waveform while rejecting another waveform at the same frequency. In particular, we report how the waveform-selective antenna performance can be evaluated for diverse incident angles, which is enabled by a measurement method based on a reverberation chamber. This method facilitates variation of the electromagnetic fields and modes inside the chamber and mimicking of complicated wireless communication environments through rotation of the internal stirrer. The experimental results verify that our antenna design concept based on waveform-selective metasurfaces can filter different signals with a wide range of incident angles, opening the door to utilizing such pulse-width-dependent antennas to suppress electromagnetic noise in more realistic wireless communication environments.

Title: Phase diagram of the interacting partially directed self-avoiding walk attracted by a vertical wall
Authors: Elric Angot (LMJL), Nicolas Pétrélis (LMJL), Julien Poisat (CEREMADE)
Abstract: In the present paper, we consider the interacting partially-directed self-avoiding walk (IPDSAW) attracted by a vertical wall. The IPDSAW was introduced by Zwanzig and Lauritzen (J. Chem. Phys., 1968) as a manner of investigating the collapse transition of a homopolymer dipped in a repulsive solvent. We prove in particular that a surface transition occurs inside the collapsed phase between (i) a regime where the attractive vertical wall does not influence the geometry of the polymer and (ii) a regime where the polymer is partially attached at the wall on a length that is comparable to its horizontal extension, modifying its asymptotic Wulff shape. The latter rigorously confirms the conjecture exposed by physicists in (Physica A: Stat. Mech. \\&amp; App., 2002). We push the analysis even further by providing sharp asymptotics of the partition function inside the collapsed phase.

Title: Free Growth under Tension
Authors: Chenyun Yao, Jens Elgeti
Abstract: Ever since the ground breaking work of Trepat et al. in 2009, we know that cell colonies growing on a substrate can be under tensile mechanical stress. The origin of tension has so far been attributed to cellular motility forces being oriented outward of the colony. Works in the field mainly revolve around how this orientation of the forces can be explained, ranging from velocity alignment, self-sorting due to self-propulsion, to kenotaxis. In this work, we demonstrate that tension in growing colonies can also be explained without cellular motility forces! Using a combination of well established tissue growth simulation technique and analytical modelling, we show how tension can arise as a consequence of simple mechanics of growing tissues. Combining these models with a minimalistic motility model shows how colonies can expand while under even larger tension. Furthermore, our results and analytical models provide novel analysis procedures to identify the underlying mechanics.

Title: Fundamental mechanisms of high-electric-field vacuum arc initiation
Authors: Walter Wuensch, Sergio Calatroni, Flyura Djurabekova, Andreas Kyritsakis, Yinon Ashkenazy
Abstract: This review brings together a body of experimental, theoretical, and simulation work addressing the behaviour of high-field devices and the fundamental process of vacuum arcing, also referred to as vacuum breakdown. Detailed experimental observations and results relating to a wide range of aspects of high-field devices including conditioning, field and temperature dependence of breakdown rate, and the field-holding capability as a function of device geometry and of different materials are presented. The different observations are then addressed theoretically, and with simulation, capturing the sequence of processes that lead to vacuum breakdown and explaining the major observed experimental dependencies. The core of the work described in this review was carried out by a broad multi-disciplinary collaboration in an over a decade-long program to develop high-gradient, 100 MV/m-range, accelerating structures for the CLIC project, a possible future linear-collider high-energy physics facility. Connections are made to the broader linear collider, high-field, and breakdown communities.

Title: Modeling the laser-pulse induced helium trimer dynamics
Authors: Q. Guan, J. Kruse, M. Kunitski, R. Doerner, D. Blume
Abstract: Motivated by ongoing pump-probe spectroscopy experiments, this work develops a theoretical framework for describing the rovibrational wave packet dynamics that ensues when a single weakly-bound van der Waals trimer is exposed to a short, sub-picosecond linearly polarized pump laser pulse. The intensity I of the pump laser is chosen such that excitation and ionization of the electronic degrees of freedom are negligible while excitation of the wavepacket in the nuclear degrees of freedom is non-negligible. The numerical treatment, which takes advantage of the fact that the laser pulse is very short compared to typical molecular time scales, is based on a wave packet decomposition that utilizes hyperspherical coordinates. The framework is applied to the extremely floppy bosonic helium trimer. A convergence analysis of the partial wave decomposition is conducted. The kinetic energy release and orientation dynamics are presented. While the dynamics of more strongly-bound van der Waals trimers such as, e.g., the argon trimer display negligible coupling between vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom, rendering a description within a rigid-body picture appropriate, those of weakly-bound trimers display non-negligible coupling between vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom, rendering a description within a rigid-body picture inappropriate. It is shown that a model that constructs the helium trimer dynamics from the dynamics of the helium dimer captures a number of key characteristics of the alignment signal, including the interference between different angular momentum wave packet components.

Title: Terahertz Defect Detection in Multi-Layer Materials Using Echo Labeling
Authors: Dogus Can Sevdiren, Furkan H. Ilgac, Aydin Sezgin
Abstract: Non-destructive testing is an important technique for detecting defects in multi-layer materials, enabling the evaluation of structural integrity without causing damage on test materials. Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) offers unique capabilities for this purpose due to its sensitivity and resolution. Inspired by room geometry estimation methods in acoustic signal processing, this work proposes a novel approach for defect detection in multi-layer composite materials using THz-TDS, enhanced by high-power sources. The proposed method utilizes Euclidean distance matrices to reduce problem complexity compared to state-of-the-art approaches, and effectively distinguishes and maps higher-order reflections from sublayers, enabling precise defect localization in composite materials without artifacts.

Title: Model-based reconstruction of real-world fractal complex networks
Authors: Kordian Makulski, Mateusz Samsel, Michal Lepek, Agata Fronczak, Piotr Fronczak
Abstract: This paper presents a versatile model for generating fractal complex networks that closely mirror the properties of real-world systems. By combining features of reverse renormalization and evolving network models, the proposed approach introduces several tunable parameters, offering exceptional flexibility in capturing the diverse topologies and scaling behaviors found in both natural and man-made networks. The model effectively replicates their key characteristics such as fractal dimensions, power-law degree distributions, and densities. Unlike traditional deterministic models, it incorporates stochasticity into the network growth process, overcoming limitations like discontinuities in degree distributions and rigid size constraints. The model's applicability is demonstrated through its ability to reproduce the structural features of real-world fractal networks, including the Internet, the World Wide Web, and co-authorship networks.

Title: General theory of slow non-Hermitian evolution
Authors: Parveen Kumar, Yuval Gefen, Kyrylo Snizhko
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems are widespread in both classical and quantum physics. The dynamics of such systems has recently become a focal point of research, showcasing surprising behaviors that include apparent violation of the adiabatic theorem and chiral topological conversion related to encircling exceptional points (EPs). These have both fundamental interest and potential practical applications. Yet the current literature features a number of apparently irreconcilable results. Here we develop a general theory for slow evolution of non-Hermitian systems and resolve these contradictions. We prove an analog of the adiabatic theorem for non-Hermitian systems and generalize it in the presence of uncontrolled environmental fluctuations (noise). The effect of noise turns out to be crucial due to inherent exponential instabilities present in non-Hermitian systems. Disproving common wisdom, the end state of the system is determined by the final Hamiltonian only, and is insensitive to other details of the evolution trajectory in parameter space. Our quantitative theory, leading to transparent physical intuition, is amenable to experimental tests. It provides efficient tools to predict the outcome of the system's evolution, avoiding the need to follow costly time-evolution simulations. Our approach may be useful for designing devices based on non-Hermitian physics and may stimulate analyses of classical and quantum non-Hermitian-Hamiltonian dynamics, as well as that of quantum Lindbladian and hybrid-Liouvillian systems.

Title: Geometrical frustration, power law tunneling and non-local gauge fields from scattered light
Authors: Pavel P. Popov, Joana Fraxanet, Luca Barbiero, Maciej Lewenstein
Abstract: Designing the amplitude and range of couplings in quantum systems is a fundamental tool for exploring a large variety of quantum mechanical effects. Here, we consider off-resonant photon scattering processes on a geometrically shaped molecular cloud. Our analysis shows that such a setup is properly modeled by a Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian where the range, amplitude and sign of the tunneling processes of the scattered photonic modes can be accurately tuned. Specifically, by varying the molecular distribution, we demonstrate that different configurations characterized by geometrical frustration, long-range power law hopping processes, and non-local gauge fields can be achieved. Our results thus represent a powerful and alternative approach to perform an accurate Hamiltonian engineering of quantum systems with non trivial coupling structures.

Title: Light-matter correlations in Quantum Floquet engineering of cavity quantum materials
Authors: Beatriz Pérez-González, Gloria Platero, Álvaro Gómez-León
Abstract: Quantum Floquet engineering (QFE) seeks to generalize the control of quantum systems with classical external fields, widely known as Semi-Classical Floquet engineering (SCFE), to quantum fields. However, to faithfully capture the physics at arbitrary coupling, a gauge-invariant description of light-matter interaction in cavity-QED materials is required, which makes the Hamiltonian highly non-linear in photonic operators. We provide a non-perturbative truncation scheme of the Hamiltonian, which is valid or arbitrary coupling strength, and use it to investigate the role of light-matter correlations, which are absent in SCFE. We find that even in the high-frequency regime, light-matter correlations can be crucial, in particular for the topological properties of a system. As an example, we show that for a SSH chain coupled to a cavity, light-matter correlations break the original chiral symmetry of the chain, strongly affecting the robustness of its edge states. In addition, we show how light-matter correlations are imprinted in the photonic spectral function and discuss their relation with the topology of the bands.

Title: Landau Theory of Barocaloric Plastic Crystals
Authors: R. Marín-Delgado, X. Moya, G. G. Guzmán-Verri
Abstract: We present a minimal Landau theory of plastic-to-crystal phase transitions in which the key components are a multipole-moment order parameter that describes the orientational ordering of the constituent molecules, coupling between such order parameter and elastic strains, and thermal expansion. We illustrate the theory with the simplest non-trivial model in which the orientational ordering is described by a quadrupole moment, and use such model to calculate barocaloric effects in plastic crystals that are driven by hydrostatic pressure. The model captures characteristic features of plastic-to-crystal phase transitions, namely, large changes in volume and entropy at the transition, as well as the linear dependence of the transition temperature with pressure. We identify temperature regions in the barocaloric response associated with the individual plastic and crystal phases, and those involving the phase transition. Our model is in overall agreement with previous experiments in powdered samples of fullerite C$_{60}$, and predicts peak isothermal entropy changes of $\sim90 \,{\rm J K^{-1} kg^{-1}}$ and peak adiabatic temperature changes of $\sim35 \,{\rm K}$ under $0.60\,$GPa at $265\,$K in fullerite single crystals.

Title: The coupled-cluster self-energy
Authors: Christopher J. N. Coveney, David P. Tew
Abstract: Coupled-cluster and Green's function theories are highly successful in treating many-body electron correlation and there has been significant interest in identifying and leveraging connections between them. Here we present a diagrammatic definition of the irreducible coupled-cluster self-energy that directly embeds coupled-cluster theory within the framework of many-body field theory. The EOM-CC treatment emerges naturally from our definition via the Dyson and Bethe-Salpeter equations, providing a unified description of RPA, $GW$-BSE and CC theory for ground state and excitation energies. This clarifies the origin of previously established connections between RPA, $GW$-BSE and coupled-cluster theory, and exposes the relationship between vertex corrections and the coupled-cluster amplitude equations.

Title: Nonreciprocal Ising model
Authors: Yael Avni, Michel Fruchart, David Martin, Daniel Seara, Vincenzo Vitelli
Abstract: Systems with nonreciprocal interactions generically display time-dependent states. These are routinely observed in finite systems, from neuroscience to active matter, in which globally ordered oscillations exist. However, the stability of these uniform nonreciprocal phases in noisy spatially-extended systems, their fate in the thermodynamic limit, and the critical behavior of the corresponding phase transitions are not fully understood. Here, we address these questions by introducing a nonreciprocal generalization of the Ising model and study its phase transitions by means of numerical and analytical approaches. While the mean-field equations predict three stable homogeneous phases (disordered, ordered and a time-dependent swap phase), our large scale numerical simulations reveal a more complex picture. Static order is destroyed in any finite dimension due to the growth of rare droplets unless the symmetry between the two spin types is broken triggering a stabilizing droplet-capture mechanism. The swap phase is destroyed by fluctuations in two dimensions through the proliferation of spiral defects but stabilized in three dimensions where nonreciprocity changes the critical exponents from Ising to XY, thus giving rise to a robust spatially-distributed clock.

Title: Disorder-induced instability of a Weyl nodal loop semimetal towards a diffusive topological metal with protected multifractal surface states
Authors: João S. Silva, Miguel Gonçalves, Eduardo V. Castro, Pedro Ribeiro, Miguel A. N. Araújo
Abstract: Weyl nodal loop semimetals are gapless topological phases that, unlike their insulator counterparts, may be unstable to small perturbations that respect their topology-protecting symmetries. Here, we analyze a clean system perturbed by chiral off-diagonal disorder using numerically exact methods. We establish that the ballistic semimetallic phase is unstable towards the formation of an unconventional topological diffusive metal hosting topological multifractal surface states. Although, as in the clean case, surface states are exponentially localized along the direction perpendicular to the nodal loop, disorder induces a multifractal structure in the remaining directions. Surprisingly, the number of these states also increases with a small amount of disorder. Eventually, as disorder is further increased, the number of surface states starts decreasing.

Abstract: Altermagnetism, a kind of collinear magnetism that is characterized by a momentum-dependent band and spin splitting without net magnetization, has recently attracted considerable interest. Finding altermagnetic materials with large splitting near the Fermi level necessarily requires three-dimensional k-space mapping. While this is crucial for spintronic applications and emergent phenomena, it remains challenging. Here, using synchrotron-based angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), spin-resolved ARPES and model calculations, we uncover a large altermagnetic splitting, up to ~1.0 eV, near the Fermi level in CrSb. We verify its bulk-type g-wave altermagnetism through systematic three-dimensional k-space mapping, which unambiguously reveals the altermagnetic symmetry and associated nodal planes. Spin-resolved ARPES measurements further verify the spin polarizations of the split bands near Fermi level. Tight-binding model analysis indicates that the large altermagnetic splitting arises from strong third-nearest-neighbor hopping mediated by Sb ions. The large band/spin splitting near Fermi level in metallic CrSb, together with its high TN (up to 705 K) and simple spin configuration, paves the way for exploring emergent phenomena and spintronic applications based on altermagnets.

Title: Electrically activated W-doped VO2 films for reliable, large-area, broadband THz waves modulators
Authors: Eduard-Nicolae Sirjita, Alexandre Boulle, Jean-Christophe Orlianges, Richard Mayet, Aurélien Debelle, Lionel Thomé, Maggy Colas, Julie Cornette, Aurelian Crunteanu
Abstract: THz amplitude modulators and switches are considered to be the main building blocks of future THz communication systems. Despite rapid progress, modulation and switching devices in this electromagnetic spectrum lag far behind other frequency ranges. Currently, THz modu-lators face major challenges in consistently producing high modulations depths over large frequency bands. Moreover, a convenient integration for practical applications requires that the modulation/switching properties can be electrically controlled. Devices fulfilling all these con-ditions remain to be demonstrated. In this work we show that W-doped VO2 films grown by direct-current magnetron sputtering can be efficiently used for the development reliable, large-area, broadband THz waves modulators. We demonstrate that W doping not only permits to tune the insulator to metal transition (IMT) temperature of VO2, but also, most importantly, to control the topology of the electrically activated transition. In situ / operando X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy characterizations of the devices, coupled with standard resistivi-ty measurements and time-domain THz spectroscopy, unambiguously demonstrate that the changes in the spatial distribution of the IMT is due to structural distortions induced by W doping.

Title: Viscous liquid dynamics modeled as random walks within overlapping hyperspheres
Authors: Mark F. B. Railton, Eva Uhre, Jeppe C. Dyre, Thomas B. Schrøder
Abstract: The hypersphere model is a simple one-parameter model of the potential energy landscape of viscous liquids, which is defined as a percolating system of same-radius hyperspheres randomly distributed in $\mathbb{R}^{3N}$ in which $N$ is the number of particles. We study random walks within overlapping hyperspheres in 12 to 45 dimensions, i.e., above the percolation threshold, utilizing an algorithm for on-the-fly placement of the hyperspheres in conjunction with the kinetic Monte Carlo method. We find behavior typical of viscous liquids; thus decreasing the hypersphere density (corresponding to decreasing the temperature) leads to a slowing down of the dynamics by many orders of magnitude. The shape of the mean-square displacement as a function of time is found to be similar to that of the Kob-Andersen binary Lennard-Jones mixture and the Random Barrier Model, which predicts well the frequency-dependent fluidity of nine glass-forming liquids of different chemistry [Bierwirth et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. $\mathbf{119}, 248001\,(2017)$].

Title: Interlayer Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions induced via non-linear phononics in bilayer van der Waals materials
Authors: Ze-Xun Lin, Bowen Ma, Wesley Roberts, Martin Rodriguez-Vega, Gregory A. Fiete
Abstract: We theoretically study the impact of light-driven structural changes via nonlinear phononics on the magnetic order of untwisted bilayer van der Waals materials. We consider an illustrative example of the AA-stacked bilayer honeycomb lattice and show that high-intensity light in resonance with selected phonons induces large amplitude phonon displacements that modify the magnetic Hamiltonian of the system. We performed a group theory analysis to identify the vibrational modes of the honeycomb bilayer and the nonlinear couplings among them in the strongly driven regime. We find that the structural changes in the strongly driven regime lower the symmetry relative to the equilibrium lattice and produce changes in the magnetic interactions between the local moments. In particular, the lattice symmetry changes permit a non-zero interlayer Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction that induces a magnetic state with canted local moments. Using a spin-wave analysis about the new magnetic configuration we study the corresponding changes in the magnon spectrum and identify a protocol for engineering topological band transitions using a combination of nonlinear phononics and an external magnetic field. Our work suggests a strategy to induce and control interlayer Dyzaloshinskii-Moriya interactions in a class of layered van der Waals materials, the effect of which is to modify the magnetic ground state, magnon dispersions, and related band geometric properties, including topological invariants.

Title: Correlation Effects in a Simplified Bilayer Two-Orbital Hubbard Model at Half Filling
Authors: Jian-Jian Yang, Dao-Xin Yao, Han-Qing Wu
Abstract: Motivated by the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure, we investigate the ground-state phase diagram and correlation effects using determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations in a simplified bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model at half filling. Our results reveal the emergence of a nonmagnetic weakly insulating phase at weak on-site Hubbard interactions, transitioning to an antiferromagnetic Mott insulating phase as the interaction strength exceeds a critical value $U/t_1^x\approx 4.15$. This phase transition is consistent with the 3D O(3) Heisenberg universality class. Additionally, we analyze dynamical properties such as the single-particle spectral function and dynamic spin structure factor. The pronounced inter-layer correlation of $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals results in a downward trend and an extended flatness in the $\gamma$ band, mirroring the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy findings under ambient pressure. Our numerical results provide important clues for understanding the strong correlation effects in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.

Title: Dynamical phase transitions in the nonreciprocal Ising model
Authors: Yael Avni, Michel Fruchart, David Martin, Daniel Seara, Vincenzo Vitelli
Abstract: Nonreciprocal interactions in many-body systems lead to time-dependent states, commonly observed in biological, chemical, and ecological systems. The stability of these states in the thermodynamic limit and the critical behavior of the phase transition from static to time-dependent states are not yet fully understood. To address these questions, we study a minimalistic system endowed with nonreciprocal interactions: an Ising model with two spin species having opposing goals. The mean-field equation predicts three stable phases: disorder, static order, and a time-dependent swap phase. Large scale numerical simulations support the following: (i) in 2D, the swap phase is destabilized by defects; (ii) in 3D, the swap phase is stable, and has the properties of a time crystal; (iii) the transition from disorder to swap in 3D is characterized by the critical exponents of the 3D XY model, and corresponds to the breaking of a continuous symmetry, time translation invariance; (iv) when the two species have fully anti-symmetric couplings, the static-order phase is unstable in any finite dimension due to droplet growth; (v) in the general case of asymmetric couplings, static order can be restored by a droplet-capture mechanism preventing the droplets from growing indefinitely. We provide details on the full phase diagram which includes first- and second-order-like phase transitions and study how the system coarsens into swap and static-order states.

Title: Self-organised magnon condensation in quasi-1D edge-shared cuprates without external fields
Authors: Cliò Efthimia Agrapidis, Stefan-Ludwig Drechsler, Satoshi Nishimoto
Abstract: Multimagnon bound states were predicted nearly a century ago and have since been a key topic in condensed matter physics due to their intriguing quantum properties. However, their realization in natural materials remains elusive, especially in low-dimensional quantum magnets, where stabilizing them is particularly challenging due to the traditionally required extreme external magnetic fields. Therefore, we introduce a novel mechanism that enables the stabilization of multimagnon bound states in quasi-one-dimensional edge-shared cuprates. Our theoretical framework, supported by numerical simulations and experimental data, demonstrates that small antiferromagnetic interchain couplings act as effective internal magnetic fields, promoting a collinear antiferromagnetic order and enabling magnon condensation even at zero external field. This intrinsic stabilisation mechanism eliminates the need for high external fields, offering a platform that is more accessible for experimental realization. We validate this concept by applying it to representative materials such as Li$_2$CuO$_2$, Ca$_2$Y$_2$Cu$5$O$_{10}$, LiCuSbO$_4$, and PbCuSO$_4$(OH)$_2$. Beyond its experimental feasibility, this mechanism could drive advancements in magnon-based quantum computing, low-power spintronic devices, and high-speed magnonic circuits. Moreover, our findings reveal that small interchain and/or interlayer couplings can generally unlock previously overlooked magnetic phenomena, redefining the nature of magnetically ordered states and expanding the frontiers of quantum magnetism.

Title: Non-Hermitian Dirac cones with valley-dependent lifetimes
Authors: Xinrong Xie, Fei Ma, W.B. Rui, Zhaozhen Dong, Yulin Du, Wentao Xie, Y.X. Zhao, Hongsheng Chen, Fei Gao, Haoran Xue
Abstract: Relativistic quasiparticles emerging from band degeneracies in crystals play crucial roles in the transport and topological properties of materials and metamaterials. Quasiparticles are commonly described by Hermitian Hamiltonians, with non-Hermiticity usually considered detrimental. In this work, we show that such an assumption of Hermiticity can be lifted to bring quasiparticles into non-Hermitian regime. We propose a concrete lattice model containing two Dirac cones with valley-dependent lifetimes. The lifetime contrast enables an ultra-strong valley selection rule: only one valley can survive in the long-time limit regardless of the excitation, lattice shape and other details. This property leads to an effective parity anomaly with a single Dirac cone and offers a simple way to generate vortex states. Additionally, extending non-Hermitian features to boundaries generates valley kink states with valley-locked lifetimes, making them effectively unidirectional and more resistant against inter-valley scattering. All these phenomena are experimentally demonstrated in a non-Hermitian electric circuit lattice.

Title: Boundary-driven many-body phase transitions in a non-Hermitian disordered fermionic chain
Authors: Kuldeep Suthar
Abstract: The non-Hermitian systems exhibit extreme sensitivity to the boundary conditions. The change in the eigenspectrum with tunning boundary parameter is intimately connected to the non-Hermitian skin effect. The single-particle systems are affected by the boundary perturbations; however the interplay of a random disorder potential and non-reciprocal hopping under boundary perturbations of an interacting many-body system is not yet clear. In this work, we examine the boundary sensitivity of a non-Hermitian interacting fermionic system in the presence of a random disorder potential. A non-zero boundary parameter results in real-complex spectral transitions with non-reciprocal (or unidirectional) hopping at weak disorder. While the many-body localization at strong disorder washes away real-complex transitions leading to dynamical stability and real eigenvalue spectrum. We show that the boundary-driven real-complex spectral transitions of the non-Hermitian chain are accompanied by the corresponding changes in the level statistics and nearest level-spacing distributions. The intriguing features of non-reciprocity and boundary sensitivity are further revealed using the averaged inverse participation ratios. Finally, we find distinct behaviour in the quench dynamics of local particle density, population imbalance, and entanglement entropy of charge-density-wave ordered state that corroborate the real-complex and localization transitions. Our results provide a route to understanding disordered many-body systems under a generalized boundary.

Title: Local Properties of the Rapidity Distribution in the Lieb-Liniger Model
Authors: Miłosz Panfil, Zoran Ristivojevic
Abstract: We study the rapidity distribution in the Lieb-Liniger model and derive exact relations for its derivatives at the Fermi level. The latter enables us to treat analytically the free energy of the system at low temperatures and arbitrary interactions. We calculated the leading-order correction to the well-known result obtained using conformal field theory. In contrast to the leading-order term controlled by the sound velocity or the Luttinger liquid parameter, the new term is controlled by an additional dimensionless parameter. We calculated its series expansions in the limiting cases of weak and strong interactions. Our results are generalized to other Galilean-invariant integrable systems.

Title: Wigner-function formalism for the detection of single microwave pulses in a resonator-coupled double quantum dot
Authors: Drilon Zenelaj, Peter Samuelsson, Patrick P. Potts
Abstract: Semiconductor double quantum dots (DQD) coupled to superconducting microwave resonators offer a promising platform for the detection of single microwave photons. In previous works, the photodetection was studied for a monochromatic source of microwave photons. Here, we theoretically analyze the photodetection of single microwave pulses. The photodetection in this case can be seen as a non-linear filtering process of an incoming signal, the pulse, to an outgoing one, the photocurrent. This analogy to signal processing motivated the derivation of a Wigner-function formalism which provides a compelling visualization of the time and frequency properties of the photodetector for low intensities. We find a trade-off between detecting the time and the frequency of the incoming photons in agreement with the time-energy uncertainty relation. As the intensity of the source increases, the photodetection is influenced by coherent Rabi oscillations of the DQD. Our findings give insight into the time-dependent properties of microwave photons interacting with electrons in a DQD-resonator hybrid system and provide guidance for experiments on single microwave pulse detection.

Title: Charge density waves and pinning by lattice anisotropy in 214 cuprates
Authors: Xiao Hu, Pedro M. Lozano, Feng Ye, Qiang Li, Jennifer Sears, Igor. A. Zaliznyak, Genda Gu, John M. Tranquada
Abstract: The detection of static charge density waves (CDWs) in La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ (LSCO) with x $\sim$ 0.12 at relatively high temperatures has raised the question of what lattice feature pins the CDWs. Some recent structural studies have concluded that some form of monoclinic distortion, indicated by the appearance of certain weak Bragg peaks (type M peaks) at otherwise forbidden positions, are responsible for CDW pinning. As a test of this idea, we present neutron diffraction results for a single crystal of La$_{2-x}$Ba$_x$CuO$_4$ (LBCO) with x = 1/8, which is known to undergo two structural transitions on cooling, from high-temperature tetragonal (HTT) to low-temperature orthorhombic (LTO) near 240 K, involving a collective tilt pattern of the corner-sharing CuO$_6$ octahedra, and from LTO to low temperature tetragonal (LTT) near 56 K, involving a new tilt pattern and the appearance of intensity at peaks of type T. We observe both type M and type T peaks in the LTT phase, while the type M peaks (but not type T) are still present in the LTO phase. Given that CDW order is observed only in the LTT phase of LBCO, it is apparent that the in-plane Cu-O bond anisotropy associated with the octahedral tilt pattern is responsible for charge pinning. We point out that evidence for a similar, but weaker, bond anisotropy has been observed previously in LSCO and should be responsible for CDW pinning there. In the case of LBCO, the monoclinic distortion may help to explain previously-reported magneto-optical evidence for gyrotropic order.

Title: Collective Foraging and Behavioural Heterogeneity in Ants: First-Passage Statistics with Heterogeneous Walkers on a Honeycomb Lattice
Authors: Daniel Marris, Pol Fernández-López, Frederic Bartumeus, Luca Giuggioli
Abstract: Individual behavioural heterogeneity is key to understanding how natural populations adapt flexibly to environmental changes. In ant species like \textit{Aphaenogaster senilis}, two key roles in collective foraging are commonly recognized: scouts, who discover food patches, and recruits, who exploit these patches and transport food back to the nest. These roles involve distinct movement patterns and exploratory behaviours. In this chapter, we develop a correlated random walk model on a bounded honeycomb lattice to interpret and replicate empirical observations of foraging ants in an enclosed arena with honeycomb tiling. We do so by extending the theory of first-passage processes for $\mathcal{N}$ random walkers when individuals belong to a heterogeneous population. We apply this theory to examine how individual behavioural heterogeneity in ants affects collective foraging efficiency, focusing on first-passage time statistics for nest-to-patch and patch-to-patch movements. With the combined use of the mathematical model and the controlled experimental setup we evaluate (i) the impact of distinct movement strategies by scouts and recruits on finding food items and (ii) whether ants practice strict central place foraging or utilise previously discovered patches as starting points for further exploration.

Title: Heat exchange for oscillator strongly coupled to thermal bath
Authors: Alex V. Plyukhin
Abstract: The heat exchange fluctuation theorem (XFT) by Jarzynski and Wójcik [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 230602 (2004)] addresses the setting where two systems with different temperatures are brought in thermal contact at time $t=0$ and then disconnected at later time $\tau$. The theorem asserts that the probability of an anomalous heat flux (from cold to hot), while nonzero, is exponentially smaller than the probability of the corresponding normal flux (from hot to cold). As a result, the average heat flux is always normal. In that way, the theorem demonstrates how irreversible heat transfer, observed on the macroscopic scale, emerges from the underlying reversible dynamics. The XFT was proved under the assumption that the coupling work required to connect and then disconnect the systems is small compared to the change of the internal energies of the systems. That condition is often valid for macroscopic systems, but may be violated for microscopic ones. We examine the validity of the XFT's assumption for a specific model of the Caldeira-Leggett type, where one system is a classical harmonic oscillator and the other is a thermal bath comprised of a large number of oscillators. The coupling between the system and the bath, which is bilinear, is instantaneously turned on at $t=0$ and off at $t=\tau$. For that model, we found that the assumption of the XFT can be satisfied only for a rather restricted range of parameters. In general, the work involved in the process is not negligible and the energy exchange may be anomalous in the sense that the internal energy of the system, which is initially hotter than the bath, may further increase.

Title: A phenomenological magnetomechanical model for hysteresis loops
Authors: Alexej Perevertov
Abstract: In this work we propose a simple phenomenological model for magnetization curves of stressed samples. The effect of stress is introduced by scaling the arctangent function argument (magnetic field) proportionally to stress. The magnetization curve is modelled by one or two arctangent functions. Despite of its simplicity, the model gives a very good agreement with experimental curves, reproducing all stress-induced features usually observed on the magnetization curves including the common crossover point and constricted hysteresis loops. The popular effective field concept in this model is just a consequence of a simple scaling of the magnetic field. We show that the differential susceptibility is inversely proportional to the applied stress for all magnetization values. We propose to analyze the field and differential susceptibility as a function of magnetization in contrast to convenient M(H) loops.

Title: Nonreciprocal spin-wave dispersion in magnetic bilayers
Authors: C. Heins, V. Iurchuk, O. Gladii, L. Körber, A. Kákay, J. Fassbender, K. Schultheiss, H. Schultheiss
Abstract: Nonreciprocal spin-wave propagation in bilayer ferromagnetic systems has attracted significant attention due to its potential to precisely quantify material parameters as well as for applications in magnonic logic and information processing. In this study we investigate the nonreciprocity of spin-wave dispersions in heterostructures consisting of two distinct ferromagnetic materials, focusing on the influence of saturation magnetization and thickness of the magnetic layers. We exploit Brillouin light scattering to confirm numerical calculations which are conducted with the finite element software TETRAX. An extensive numerical analysis reveals that the nonreciprocal behavior is strongly influenced by the changing material parameters, with asymmetry in the spin-wave propagation direction reaching several GHz under optimized conditions. Our findings demonstrate that tailoring the bilayer composition enables precise control over nonreciprocity, providing a pathway for engineering efficient unidirectional spin-wave devices. These results offer a deeper understanding of hybrid ferromagnetic systems and open avenues for designing advanced magnonic circuits.

Title: Fractonic superfluids. III. Hybridizing higher moments
Authors: Han-Xie Wang, Shuai A. Chen, Peng Ye
Abstract: Fractonic superfluids are featured by the interplay of spontaneously broken charge symmetry and mobility constraints on single-particle kinematics due to the conservation of higher moments, such as dipoles, angular charge moments, and quadrupoles. Building on prior studies by Yuan et al. [Phys. Rev. Res. 2, 023267 (2020)] and Chen et al. [Phys. Rev. Res. 3, 013226 (2021)], we study a class of fractonic superfluids, termed \textit{hybrid fractonic superfluids} (HFS), in which bosons of multiple species interact while moment hybridization is conserved. We explore the consequences of hybridization via two model series: \textit{Model Series A}, conserving total moments of the same order across species, and \textit{Model Series B}, conserving total moments of different orders. In Model Series A, we analyze dipole moment hybridization and extend the discussion to higher-order moments, examining the ground state, Goldstone modes, correlation functions, and so on. We compute the minimal spatial dimensions, where the total charge symmetry begins to get partially broken via particle-hole condensation, leading to true off-diagonal long-range order. In Model Series B, we focus on HFS with hybrid dipole-quadrupole conservation. For both series, we introduce Bose-Hubbard-type lattice models that reduce to either of both series in the weak Hubbard interaction regime. We perform a mean-field analysis on the global phase diagram and discuss experimental realizations in strongly tilted optical lattices via a third-order perturbation theory. This work, alongside prior studies, completes a trilogy on fractonic superfluids, uncovering symmetry-breaking physics emerging from higher moment conservation, leaving various promising studies for future investigation.

Title: Nonequilibrium Response Theory: From Precision Limits to Strong Perturbation
Authors: Ruicheng Bao, Shiling Liang
Abstract: Understanding the response of nonequilibrium systems to external perturbations remains a fundamental challenge in statistical physics. Here, we prove a novel universal bound stating that the response precision for state observable is fundamentally constrained to 1/2 under single edge or vertex perturbations, independent of system size. Furthermore, we develop exact relations connecting responses to perturbations of arbitrary strengths, extending nonequilibrium response theory beyond the weak-perturbation regime. Through response equalities, we also provide a novel physical interpretation of response sensitivity and recover bounds previously obtained using graph-theoretical methods and extensive linear algebra. Our results provide a general mathematical framework applicable across diverse nonequilibrium systems and offer design principles for optimal sensing and information processing in biochemical systems.

Title: Hallmarks of Spin Textures for High-Harmonic Generation
Authors: Francesco Gabriele, Carmine Ortix, Mario Cuoco, Filomena Forte
Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling and quantum geometry are fundamental aspects in modern condensed matter physics, with their primary manifestations in momentum space being spin textures and Berry curvature. In this work, we investigate their interplay with high-harmonic generation (HHG) in two-dimensional non-centrosymmetric materials, with an emphasis on even-order harmonics. Our analysis reveals that the emergence of finite even-order harmonics necessarily requires a broken twofold rotational symmetry in the spin texture, as well as a non-trivial Berry curvature in systems with time-reversal invariance. This symmetry breaking can arise across various degrees of freedom and impact both spin textures and optical response via spin-orbit interactions. These findings underscore the potential of HHG as a powerful tool for exploring electronic phases with broken rotational symmetry, as well as the associated phase transitions in two-dimensional materials. This approach provides novel perspectives for designing symmetry-dependent nonlinear optical phenomena.

Title: Bond Disordered Antiferromagnetic Quantum Spin Chains with Long Range Interactions
Authors: Stefan Kettemann
Abstract: We introduce and implement a reformulation of the strong disorder renormalization group (SDRG) method in real space, which is well suited to study bond disordered power law long range coupled, antiferromagnetic quantum spin chains. We derive the distribution function of couplings $J$ with corrections to the previously derived strong disorder fixed point distribution, which depend on power exponent $\alpha$ and coupling anisotropy $\gamma.$ As a consequence, the low temperature magnetic susceptibility is found to diverge with an anomalous power law. The distribution of singlet lengths is found to decay more slowly than obtained previously, with consequences for physical properties. The entanglement entropy of a subsystem of length $n$ is thereby found to increase with a power law, rather than logarithmically, corresponding to a subvolume law. While we find no volume law entanglement entropy for the ground state for any $\alpha$, we derive a finite probability that excited states are rainbow states below a critical value $\alpha_c\approx 1.5$, which leads to volume law entanglement for $\alpha < 0.4$, where the rainbow state formation is certain.

Title: Symmetric tensor scars with tunable entanglement from volume to area law
Authors: Bhaskar Mukherjee, Christopher J. Turner, Marcin Szyniszewski, Arijeet Pal
Abstract: Teleportation of quantum information over long distances requires robust entanglement on the macroscopic scale. The construction of highly energetic eigenstates with tunable long-range entanglement can provide a new medium for information transmission. Using a symmetric superposition of the antipodal triplet states, we construct polynomially many exact zero-energy eigenstates for a class of non-integrable spin-1/2 Hamiltonians with two-body interactions. These states exhibit non-thermal correlations, and by tuning the distribution of triplets we induce extensive, logarithmic, or area-law entanglement. Quasiparticle excitations in this manifold converge to be exact quantum many-body scars in the thermodynamic limit. This framework has a natural extension to higher dimensions, where entangled states controlled by lattice geometry and internal symmetries can result in new classes of correlated out-of-equilibrium quantum matter. Our results provide a new avenue for entanglement control and quantum state constructions.

Title: Linear-time classical approximate optimization of cubic-lattice classical spin glasses
Authors: Adil A. Gangat
Abstract: Computing low-energy configurations (i.e., approximate optimization) of classical spin glasses is of relevance to both condensed matter and combinatorial optimization. Recent theoretical work opens the possibility to make its time complexity with quantum annealing generically polynomial, and D-Wave experiments can now achieve approximate optimization of cubic-lattice classical Ising spin glasses with $\sim$$10^4$ spins. It is therefore timely to ask which short-range classical spin glasses are good candidates for demonstrating quantum advantage in the time complexity of heuristic approximate optimization. One intuition is to consider models with very rugged energy landscapes in configuration space. However, here we provide evidence that short-range classical spin glasses may be approximately optimized in linear time and space with a very simple deterministic tensor-network heuristic regardless of ruggedness. On the cubic lattice with up to 50$\times$50$\times$50 spins, we obtain energy errors of $\lesssim$3% for the $\pm J$ model used in recent D-Wave experiments, and $\lesssim$5% for much more rugged planted-solution instances. For cubic-lattice-Ising reductions of unweighted Max-Cut on random 3-regular graphs with up to 300 vertices, we find energy errors of $<$1% and approximation ratios of about 72-88%. A theoretical implication of our algorithm is that only quantum algorithms with sublinear time complexity may have time-complexity quantum advantage for heuristic approximate optimization of classical spin glasses that have decaying correlations. These results inform the search for quantum advantage and suggest an efficient classical method for generating warm starts for other spin-glass optimization algorithms. Our algorithm is amenable to massive parallelization and may also allow for low-power, accelerated implementations with photonic matrix-multiplication hardware.

Title: Reactive Fluid Ferroelectrics: A Gateway to the Next Generation of Ferroelectric Liquid Crystalline Polymer Networks
Authors: Stuart R Berrow, Jordan Hobbs, Calum J Gibb
Abstract: Herein we report the first examples of reactive mesogenic materials (RMs) which exhibit fluid ferroelectric order based on the recently discovered ferroelectric nematic (NF) phase. We term these materials NF RMs and they provide the first steps towards the next generation of ferroelectric liquid crystalline polymer networks. We report the chemical synthesis and characterisation of the liquid crystalline properties of these materials, demonstrating that they have the lowest longitudinal molecular dipole moments of any reported NF material of 7.39 D. We go on to demonstrate a potential use case of this new class of reactive material through the polymer stabilisation of a matrix which exhibits the NF phase, increasing the phase range of the ferroelectric phase from 75 °C to 120 °C. The NF RMs reported herein are an exciting step forward in ferroelectric liquid crystal research, demonstrating that reactive NF materials are achievable, allowing for the future development of liquid crystalline ferroelectric networks, elastomers and polymers.

Title: Nonclassical dynamics of N\'eel vector and magnetization accompanied by THz and high-harmonic radiation from ultrafast-light-driven NiO antiferromagnet insulator
Authors: Federico Garcia-Gaitan, Adrian E. Feiguin, Branislav K. Nikolic
Abstract: Ultrafast-light-driven strongly correlated antiferromagnetic insulators, such as prototypical NiO with large energy gap 4 eV, have recently attracted experimental attention using either above-gap [K. Gillmeister et al., Nat. Commun. 11, 4095 (2020)] or subgap [H. Qiu et al., Nat. Phys. 17, 388 (2021)] energy photons that are of fundamental interest in far-from-equilibrium quantum matter or spintronic applications, respectively. In the latter context, emission of THz radiation is also observed from NiO/Pt bilayers, where heavy metal (HM) Pt introduces strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC). However, microscopic mechanisms of such emission remain obscure because spintronic THz emitters have been amply studied using FM/HM (FM-ferromagnetic metal of conventional type) bilayers, where ultrafast demagnetization takes place and is directly related to THz emission. Conversely, in NiO total magnetization is zero prior to the fs laser pulse (fsLP) application. Here we employ the two-orbital Hubbard-Hund-Heisenberg model and study, via numerically exact nonequilibrium quantum many-body methods, the dynamics of its Neel vector and nonequilibrium magnetization. Additionally, we compute electromagnetic radiation by both time-dependent magnetization and local charge currents arising in either plain NiO or NiO with proximity SOC introduced by HM layer. Our analysis reveals nonclassical dynamics of Neel vector and nonequilibrium magnetization, changing only in length while not rotating, where the former is substantially reduced only in the case above-gap fsLP. In the plain NiO case, THz radiation of interest to applications is insignificant, but adding SOC enhances both current and magnetic dipole contributions to it. Above THz range, we find integer high-harmonic generation, as well as unusual noninteger harmonics for above-gap fsLP pump.

Title: Superconductivity and magnetic ordering in chalcogen-intercalated graphene bilayers with charge compensation
Authors: Tommy Li
Abstract: This work introduces a new class of two-dimensional crystals with the structure AC$_8$XC$_8$, consisting of two layers of graphene, a chalcogen (X = O, S, Se, Te) intercalation layer, and an alkaline earth (A = Be, Ca, Mg, Sr, Ba) adlayer. The electronic band structure for the 20 compounds was studied using density functional theory. The chalcogen $p$ orbitals interact with the carbon $\pi$ orbitals to form weakly dispersing bands that intersect the Fermi level and give rise to complex Fermi surfaces featuring electron and hole pockets whose densities exactly compensate each other, and van Hove singularities that are very close to, or coincident with, the Fermi level in the majority of compounds studied. The resulting electron-electron interaction effects are studied using both the temperature-flow renormalisation group approach and a spin fluctuation model, which show a ferromagnetic phase with critical temperatures as high as $\sim 10^3$ K that coexists with $p$- or $f$-wave spin triplet superconductivity over a range of temperatures.

Title: Mie-enhanced micro-focused Brillouin light scattering with wavevector resolution
Authors: Jakub Krčma, Ondřej Wojewoda, Martin Hrtoň, Jakub Holobrádek, Jon Ander Arregi, Jaganandha Panda, Michal Urbánek
Abstract: Magnons, the quanta of spin waves, are magnetic excitations of matter spanning through the entire crystal's Brillouin zone and covering a wide range of frequencies ranging from sub-gigahertz to hundreds of terahertz. Magnons play a crucial role in many condensed matter phenomena, such as the reduction of saturation magnetization with increasing temperature or Bose-Einstein condensation. However, current experimental techniques cannot resolve magnons with wavevectors between 30 and 300$\,$rad$\,\mu$m$^{-1}$. In this letter, we address this gap by tailoring the light in Brillouin light scattering process with dielectric periodic nanoresonators and thus gaining access to the previously unmeasurable spin waves with full wavevector resolution using table-top optical setup. Filling this gap can stimulate further experimental investigations of the fundamental phenomena associated with magnons but also stimulate the application of magnonics in computational and microwave devices. In addition, the same methodology can be applied to other excitations of matter, such as phonons, opening up new possibilities in e.g. mechanobiological studies.

Authors: Tobias Eul, Miwan Sabir, Victor DeManuel-Gonzalez, Florian Diekmann, Kai Rossnagel, Michael Bauer
Abstract: Exciton-polaritons emerging from the interaction of photons and excitons in the strong coupling regime are intriguing quasiparticles for the potential exchange of energy during light-matter interaction processes such as light harvesting. The coupling causes an energy anti-crossing in the photon dispersion centered around the exciton resonance, i.e., a Rabi splitting between a lower and upper energetic branch. The size of this splitting correlates with the coupling strength between the exciton and the photonic modes. In this work, we investigate this coupling between excitons and photonic waveguide modes excited simultaneously in thin-film flakes of the transition-metal dichalcogenide WSe$_2$. Using a Photoemission electron microscope, we are able to extract the dispersion of the transversal electric and magnetic modes propagating through these flakes as well as extract the energy splitting. Ultimately, our findings precipitate the investigation of the propagation of exciton-polaritons in the time-domain via time-resolved photoemission.

Title: Convergence and Quantum Advantage of Trotterized MERA for Strongly-Correlated Systems
Authors: Qiang Miao, Thomas Barthel
Abstract: Strongly-correlated quantum many-body systems are difficult to study and simulate classically. We recently proposed a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) based on the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) with tensors constrained to certain Trotter circuits. Here, we determine the scaling of computation costs for various critical spin chains which substantiates a polynomial quantum advantage in comparison to classical MERA simulations based on exact energy gradients or variational Monte Carlo. Algorithmic phase diagrams suggest an even greater separation for higher-dimensional systems. Hence, the Trotterized MERA VQE is a promising route for the efficient investigation of strongly-correlated quantum many-body systems on quantum computers. Furthermore, we show how the convergence can be substantially improved by building up the MERA layer by layer in the initialization stage and by scanning through the phase diagram during optimization. For the Trotter circuits being composed of single-qubit and two-qubit rotations, it is experimentally advantageous to have small rotation angles. We find that the average angle amplitude can be reduced considerably with negligible effect on the energy accuracy. Benchmark simulations suggest that the structure of the Trotter circuits for the TMERA tensors is not decisive; in particular, brick-wall circuits and parallel random-pair circuits yield very similar energy accuracies.

Title: Rate Function Modelling of Quantum Many-Body Adiabaticity
Authors: Vibhu Mishra, Salvatore Manmana, Stefan Kehrein
Abstract: The quantum adiabatic theorem is a fundamental result in quantum mechanics, with a multitude of applications, both theoretical and practical. Here, we investigate the dynamics of adiabatic processes for quantum many-body systems %in detail by analysing the properties of observable-free, intensive quantities. In particular, we study the adiabatic rate function $f(T, \Delta \lambda)$ in dependence of the ramp time $T$, which gives us a complete characterization of the many-body adiabatic fidelity as a function of $T$ and the strength of the parameter displacement $\Delta \lambda$. $f(T, \Delta \lambda)$ quantifies the deviation from adiabaticity for a given process and therefore allows us to control and define the notion of adiabaticity in many-body systems. First we study $f(T, \Delta \lambda)$ for the 1D transverse field Ising model and the Luttinger liquid, both of which are quadratic systems and therefore allow us to look at the thermodynamic limit. For ramps across gapped phases, we relate $f(T, \Delta \lambda)$ to the transition probability of the system and for ramps across a gapless point, or gapless phase we relate it to the excitation density of the relevant quasiparticles. Then we investigate the XXZ model which allows us to see the qualitative features that survive when interactions are turned on. Several key results in the literature regarding the interplay of the thermodynamic and the adiabatic limit are obtained as inferences from the properties of $f(T, \Delta \lambda)$ in the large $T$ limit.

Title: Volume-entangled exact scar states in the PXP and related models in any dimension
Authors: Andrew N. Ivanov, Olexei I. Motrunich
Abstract: In this Letter, we report first exact volume-entangled Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen--type scar states hosted by PXP and related Hamiltonians corresponding to various geometric configurations of Rydberg-blockaded atom systems, including the most extensively studied ones such as the chain with periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) and square lattice. We start by introducing a new zero-energy eigenstate of the PBC chain and proceed by generalizing it to a wide variety of geometries and Hamiltonians. We point out the potential experimental relevance of our states by providing a protocol for their preparation on near-term Rydberg quantum devices, which relies only on strictly local measurements and evolution under native Hamiltonians. We also demonstrate the utility of these states for the study of quantum dynamics by describing a protocol for measuring infinite-temperature out-of-time-order correlator functions.

Title: Thermal Area Law in Long-Range Interacting Systems
Authors: Donghoon Kim, Tomotaka Kuwahara, Keiji Saito
Abstract: The area law of the bipartite information measure characterizes one of the most fundamental aspects of quantum many-body physics. In thermal equilibrium, the area law for the mutual information universally holds at arbitrary temperatures as long as the systems have short-range interactions. In systems with power-law decaying interactions, $r^{-\alpha}$ ($r$: distance), conditions for the thermal area law are elusive. In this work, we aim to clarify the optimal condition $\alpha> \alpha_c$ such that the thermal area law universally holds. A standard approach to considering the conditions is to focus on the magnitude of the boundary interaction between two subsystems. However, we find here that the thermal area law is more robust than this conventional argument suggests. We show the optimal threshold for the thermal area law by $\alpha_c= (D+1)/2$ ($D$: the spatial dimension of the lattice), assuming a power-law decay of the clustering for the bipartite correlations. Remarkably, this condition encompasses even the thermodynamically unstable regimes $\alpha < D$. We verify this condition numerically, finding that it is qualitatively accurate for both integrable and non-integrable systems. Unconditional proof of the thermal area law is possible by developing the power-law clustering theorem for $\alpha > D$ above a threshold temperature. Furthermore, the numerical calculation for the logarithmic negativity shows that the same criterion $\alpha > (D+1)/2$ applies to the thermal area law for quantum entanglement.

Title: Observable asymptotics of regularized Cox regression models with standard Gaussian designs: a statistical mechanics approach
Authors: Emanuele Massa, Anthony Coolen
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behaviour of the Regularized Maximum Partial Likelihood Estimator (RMPLE) in the proportional limit, considering an arbitrary convex regularizer and assuming that the covariates $\mathbf{X}_i\in\mathbb{R}^{p}$ follow a multivariate Gaussian law with covariance $\mathbf{I}_p/p$ for each $i=1, \dots, n$. In order to efficiently compute the estimator under investigation, we propose a modified Approximate Message Passing (AMP) algorithm, that we name COX-AMP, and compare its performance with the Coordinate-wise Descent (CD) algorithm, which is taken as reference. By means of the Replica method, we derive a set of six Replica Symmetric (RS) equations that we show to correctly describe the average behaviour of the estimators when the sample size and the number of covariates is large and commensurate. These equations cannot be solved in practice, as the data generating process (that we are trying to estimate) is not known. However, the update equations of COX-AMP suggest the construction of a local field that can in turn be used to accurately estimate all the RS order parameters of the theory \emph{solely from the data}, \emph{without} actually solving the RS equations. We emphasize that this approach can be applied when the estimator is computed via any method and is not restricted to COX-AMP. Once the RS order parameters are estimated, we have access to the amount of signal and noise in the RMPLE, but also its generalization error, directly from the data. Although we focus on the Partial Likelihood objective, we envisage broader application of the methodology proposed here, for instance to GLMs with nuisance parameters, which include some non-proportional hazards models, e.g. Accelerated Failure Time models.

Title: Bayesian RG Flow in Neural Network Field Theories
Authors: Jessica N. Howard, Marc S. Klinger, Anindita Maiti, Alexander G. Stapleton
Abstract: The Neural Network Field Theory correspondence (NNFT) is a mapping from neural network (NN) architectures into the space of statistical field theories (SFTs). The Bayesian renormalization group (BRG) is an information-theoretic coarse graining scheme that generalizes the principles of the exact renormalization group (ERG) to arbitrarily parameterized probability distributions, including those of NNs. In BRG, coarse graining is performed in parameter space with respect to an information-theoretic distinguishability scale set by the Fisher information metric. In this paper, we unify NNFT and BRG to form a powerful new framework for exploring the space of NNs and SFTs, which we coin BRG-NNFT. With BRG-NNFT, NN training dynamics can be interpreted as inducing a flow in the space of SFTs from the information-theoretic `IR' $\rightarrow$ `UV'. Conversely, applying an information-shell coarse graining to the trained network's parameters induces a flow in the space of SFTs from the information-theoretic `UV' $\rightarrow$ `IR'. When the information-theoretic cutoff scale coincides with a standard momentum scale, BRG is equivalent to ERG. We demonstrate the BRG-NNFT correspondence on two analytically tractable examples. First, we construct BRG flows for trained, infinite-width NNs, of arbitrary depth, with generic activation functions. As a special case, we then restrict to architectures with a single infinitely-wide layer, scalar outputs, and generalized cos-net activations. In this case, we show that BRG coarse-graining corresponds exactly to the momentum-shell ERG flow of a free scalar SFT. Our analytic results are corroborated by a numerical experiment in which an ensemble of asymptotically wide NNs are trained and subsequently renormalized using an information-shell BRG scheme.

Title: Probing quantum chaos through singular-value correlations in sparse non-Hermitian SYK model
Authors: Pratik Nandy, Tanay Pathak, Masaki Tezuka
Abstract: Utilizing singular value decomposition, our investigation focuses on the spectrum of the singular values within a sparse non-Hermitian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. Unlike the complex eigenvalues typical of non-Hermitian systems, singular values are inherently real and positive. Our findings reveal a congruence between the statistics of singular values and those of the analogous Hermitian Gaussian ensembles. An increase in sparsity results in the non-Hermitian SYK model deviating from its chaotic behavior, a phenomenon precisely captured by the singular value ratios. Our analysis of the singular form factor ({\upsigma}FF), analogous to the spectral form factor (SFF) indicates the disappearance of the linear ramp with increased sparsity. Additionally, we define singular complexity, inspired by the spectral complexity in Hermitian systems, whose saturation provides a critical threshold of sparseness. Such disintegration is likely associated with the breakdown of the existing holographic dual for non-Hermitian systems.

Title: Tensor renormalization group study of the three-dimensional SU(2) and SU(3) gauge theories with the reduced tensor network formulation
Authors: Atis Yosprakob, Kouichi Okunishi
Abstract: We perform a tensor renormalization group simulation of non-Abelian gauge theory in three dimensions using a formulation based on the `armillary sphere.' In this formulation, matrix indices are completely traced out, eliminating the degeneracy in the singular value spectrum of the initial tensor. We demonstrate the usefulness of this technique by computing the average plaquette at zero temperature and the Polyakov loop susceptibility at finite temperatures for 2+1D SU(2) and SU(3) gauge theories. The deconfinement transition is identified for both gauge groups, with the SU(2) case being consistent with previous Monte Carlo results.

Title: Krylov fractality and complexity in generic random matrix ensembles
Authors: Budhaditya Bhattacharjee, Pratik Nandy
Abstract: Krylov space methods provide an efficient framework for analyzing the dynamical aspects of quantum systems, with tridiagonal matrices playing a key role. Despite their importance, the behavior of such matrices from chaotic to integrable states, transitioning through an intermediate phase, remains unexplored. We aim to fill this gap by considering the properties of the tridiagonal matrix elements and the associated basis vectors for appropriate random matrix ensembles. We utilize the Rosenzweig-Porter model as our primary example, which hosts a fractal regime in addition to the ergodic and localized phases. We discuss the characteristics of the matrix elements and basis vectors across the three (ergodic, fractal, and localized) regimes and introduce tools to identify the transition points. The exact expressions of the Lanczos coefficients are provided in terms of $q$-logarithmic function across the full parameter regime. The numerical results are corroborated with analytical reasoning for certain features of the Krylov spectra. Additionally, we investigate the Krylov state complexity within these regimes, showcasing the efficacy of our methods in pinpointing these transitions.

Title: Initial tensor construction and dependence of the tensor renormalization group on initial tensors
Authors: Katsumasa Nakayama, Manuel Schneider
Abstract: We propose a method to construct a tensor network representation of partition functions without singular value decompositions nor series expansions. The approach is demonstrated for one- and two-dimensional Ising models and we study the dependence of the tensor renormalization group (TRG) on the form of the initial tensors and their symmetries. We further introduce variants of several tensor renormalization algorithms. Our benchmarks reveal a significant dependence of various TRG algorithms on the choice of initial tensors and their symmetries. However, we show that the boundary TRG technique can eliminate the initial tensor dependence for all TRG methods. The numerical results of TRG calculations can thus be made significantly more robust with only a few changes in the code. Furthermore, we study a three-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory without gauge-fixing and confirm the applicability of the initial tensor construction. Our method can straightforwardly be applied to systems with longer range and multi-site interactions, such as the next-nearest neighbor Ising model.

Title: Polaronic neutron in dilute alpha matter: A $p$-wave Bose polaron
Authors: Hiroyuki Tajima, Hajime Moriya, Tomoya Naito, Wataru Horiuchi, Eiji Nakano, Kei Iida
Abstract: We theoretically investigate quasiparticle properties of a neutron immersed in an alpha condensate, which is one of the possible states of dilute symmetric nuclear matter. The resonant $p$-wave neutron-alpha scattering, which plays a crucial role in forming halo nuclei, is considered. This system is similar to a Bose polaron near the $p$-wave Feshbach resonance that can be realized in cold-atomic experiments. Calculating the self-energy within the field-theoretical approach, we give an analytical formula for the effective mass of a polaronic neutron as a function of alpha condensation density. Moreover, two adjacent neutrons in a medium, each of which behaves like a stable polaron having an enhanced effective mass, can form a bound dineutron, with the help of $^1S_0$ neutron-neutron attraction. This is in contrast to the case of the vacuum, where a dineutron is known to be unbound. Our result would be useful for understanding many-body physics in astrophysical environments as well as the formation of multi-nucleon clusters in neutron-halo nuclei.

Title: Many-body adiabatic passage: Instability, chaos, and quantum classical correspondence
Authors: Anant Vijay Varma, Amichay Vardi, Doron Cohen
Abstract: Adiabatic passage in systems of interacting bosons is substantially affected by interactions and inter-particle entanglement. We consider STIRAP-like schemes in Bose-Hubbard chains that exhibit low-dimensional chaos (a 3 site chain), and high-dimensional chaos (more than 3 sites). The dynamics that is generated by a transfer protocol exhibits striking classical and quantum chaos fingerprints that are manifest in the mean-field classical treatment, in the truncated-Wigner semiclassical treatment, and in the full many-body quantum simulations.
