Title: Machine learning applications in cold atom quantum simulators
Authors: Henning Schlömer, Annabelle Bohrdt
Abstract: As ultracold atom experiments become highly controlled and scalable quantum simulators, they require sophisticated control over high-dimensional parameter spaces and generate increasingly complex measurement data that need to be analyzed and interpreted efficiently. Machine learning (ML) techniques have been established as versatile tools for addressing these challenges, offering strategies for data interpretation, experimental control, and theoretical modeling. In this review, we provide a perspective on how machine learning is being applied across various aspects of quantum simulation, with a focus on cold atomic systems. Emphasis is placed on practical use cases -- from classifying many-body phases to optimizing experimental protocols and representing quantum states -- highlighting the specific contexts in which different ML approaches prove effective. Rather than presenting algorithmic details, we focus on the physical insights enabled by ML and the kinds of problems in quantum simulation where these methods offer tangible benefits.

Title: PyPAS -- Python package for Positron Annihilation Spectroscopy Doppler Broadening Analysis
Authors: Achiya Yosef Amrusi, Sharon May-Tal Beck, Hadar Steinberg, Guy Ron
Abstract: Doppler Broadening (DB) of annihilation radiation is a well-established technique within Positron Annihilation Spectroscopy (PAS), used for probing the electronic structure of materials. The analysis of DB experimental data relies on gamma spectroscopy analysis tools, while depth profiling using variable-energy slow positron beams depends on solving the positron diffusion equation. Traditional Variable Energy Doppler Broadening (VEDB) analysis tools, such as VEPFIT and ROYPROF, often present limitations due to outdated interfaces and lack of integration with comprehensive spectroscopy analysis platforms. Addressing these challenges, an open-source Python package for PAS analysis, PyPAS, is introduced. PyPAS offers functionalities including Coincidence Doppler Broadening (CDB) filtering, two-dimensional CDB analysis with DB and resolution extraction, and computation of lineshape parameters (S and W). Furthermore, it integrates modules for generating thermal positron implantation profiles based on established models, solving positron diffusion equations using finite-difference methods and optimizing diffusion length. This work presents the architecture of the PyPAS package and the validation results and demonstrates the application of the package through case studies.

Title: Critical Majorana fermion at a topological quantum Hall bilayer transition
Authors: Cristian Voinea, Wei Zhu, Nicolas Regnault, Zlatko Papić
Abstract: Quantum Hall bilayers are a uniquely tunable platform that can realize continuous transitions between distinct topological phases of matter. One prominent example is the transition between the Halperin state and the Moore--Read Pfaffian, long predicted to host a critical theory of Majorana fermions but so far not verified in unbiased microscopic simulations. Using the fuzzy sphere regularization, we identify the low-energy spectrum at this transition with the 3D gauged Majorana conformal field theory. We show that the transition is driven by the closing of the neutral fermion gap, and we directly extract the operator content in both integer and half-integer spin sectors. Our results resolve the long-standing question of the nature of a topological phase transition in a setting relevant to quantum Hall experiments, while also providing the first realization of a fermionic theory on the fuzzy sphere, previously limited to bosonic theories.

Title: Laser-engineered $Γ$-point Topology in Trigonal Bismuthene
Authors: Zhe Li, Haijun Cao, Sheng Meng
Abstract: The $\Gamma$-point topology represents a significant segment in the family of topological insulators. Here we provide a comprehensive prediction of light-induced $\Gamma$-point-based topological manipulation in trigonal bismuthene and its derivatives. Our findings unveil a two-stage process of topological phase transitions (TPT) as the laser intensity increases. Initially, a quantum-spin-Hall or metallic state transitions to a quantum-anomalous-Hall (QAH) state ($C$ = $\pm$3), followed by another TPT that yields a compensated Chern-insulating state ($C$ = 0). The trigonal warping model accounts for these states, describing the $C_{3z}$-rotational band-inversion process, which is determined by $\pm$1 orders of replica bands. Notably, this high Chern-number QAH state persists over a broad range of laser parameters, maintaining functionality beyond room temperature as evidenced by the large global gaps ($\geq$ 60 meV). Our work provides a comprehensive roadmap towards the designer $\Gamma$-point topology under laser excitation, facilitating applications of artificial topological materials.

Title: Self-organized hyperuniformity in a minimal model of population dynamics
Authors: Tal Agranov, Natan Wiegenfeld, Omer Karin, Benjamin D. Simons
Abstract: We identify a novel scenario for hyperuniformity in a generic model of population dynamics that has been recently introduced to account for biological memory in the immune system and epigenetic inheritance. In this model, individuals' competition over a shared resource guides the population towards a critical steady state with prolonged individual life time. Here we uncover that the spatially extended model is characterized by hyperuniform density fluctuations. A hydrodynamic theory is derived by explicit coarse-graining, which shows good agreement with numerical simulations. Unlike previous models for non-equilibrium hyperuniform states, our model does not exhibit conservation laws, even when approaching criticality. Instead, we trace the emergence of hyperuniformity to the divergence of timescales close to criticality. These findings can have applications in engineering, cellular population dynamics and ecology.

Title: Hidden frustration in the triangular-lattice antiferromagnet NdCd3P3
Authors: Juan R. Chamorro, Steven J. Gomez Alvarado, Dibyata Rout, Sarah Schwarz, Allen Scheie, Ganesh Pokharel, Alexander I. Kolesnikov, Lukas Keller, Stephen D. Wilson
Abstract: We report a study of the magnetic ground state and crystal electric field (CEF) scheme in the triangular-lattice antiferromagnet NdCd$_3$P$_3$. Combined neutron scattering, magnetization, and heat capacity measurements demonstrate that the Nd$^{3+}$ moments occupying the triangular lattice in this material harbor hidden signs of frustration not detected in typical Curie-Weiss-based parameterization of the frustration index ($f=\Theta_{CW} / T_N$). This is evidenced by a zero-field splitting of the Kramers' ground state and first excited state doublets at temperatures far in excess of $T_N$ as well as signatures of low-energy fluctuations for $T>>T_N$. A suppression of the zero-field ordered moment relative to its field saturation value is observed, and the impacts of this magnetic frustration as well as the coexisting bond frustration in the CdP honeycomb network on the physical properties of NdCd$_3$P$_3$ are discussed.

Title: A two-axes shear cell for rheo-optics
Authors: Chiara Marraffa, Stefano Aime
Abstract: We develop and test a rheo-optical platform based on a two-axes, parallel plates shear cell coupled to an optical microscope and a photon correlation imaging setup, for simultaneous investigation of the rheological response and the microscopic structure and dynamics of soft materials under shear. Each plate of the shear cell is driven by an air bearing linear stage, actuated by a voice coil motor. A servo control loop reading the plate displacement through a contactless linear encoder enables both strain-controlled and stress-controlled rheology. Simultaneous actuation of both linear stages enables both parallel and orthogonal superposition rheology. We validate the performance of our device in both oscillatory and transient rheological tests on a microgel soft glass, and we demonstrate its potential through orthogonal superposition rheology experiments. During steady-state flow, we reconstruct the strain field across the gap by tracking the motion of tracer particles, to check for slip or shear banding instabilities. At the same time, we measure the microscopic dynamics, both affine and non-affine, resolving them in space and time using photon correlation imaging.

Title: Poly-liquid behaviors of self-associating fluids and mesoscopic aggregation in liquid solutions
Authors: Ilya Davydov, Vassiliy Lubchenko
Abstract: In conflict with standard notions of thermodynamics, mesoscopically-sized inclusions (``clusters'') of a solute-rich liquid have been observed in equilibrated solutions of proteins and other molecules. According to a complexation scenario proposed earlier, a steady-state ensemble of finite-sized droplets of a metastable solute-rich liquid can emerge in a solution, if the solute molecules can form transient complexes with each other and/or solute. Here we solve for the thermodynamics of an explicit model of a self-associating fluid in which particles can form transient dimers. We determine ranges of parameters where two distinct dense liquid phases, dimer-rich and monomer-rich respectively, can co-exist with each other and the solute-poor phase. We find that within a certain range of the dimer's binding strength, thermodynamic conditions for mesoscopic clusters to emerge are indeed satisfied. The location and size, respectively, of the corresponding region on the phase diagram are consistent with observation. We predict that the clusters are comprised of a metastable monomer-rich dense liquid, while the bulk solution itself contains substantial amounts of the dimer and exhibits large, pre-critical density fluctuations. Surprisingly, we find that the dense phase commonly observed during the macroscopic liquid-liquid separation should be dimer-rich, another testable prediction. The present findings provide further evidence for the complexation scenario and suggest new experimental ways to test it.

Title: Insertion space in repulsive active matter
Authors: Luke K. Davis, Karel Proesmans
Abstract: For equilibrium hard spheres the stochastic geometry of the insertion space, the room to accommodate another sphere, relates exactly to the equation of state. We begin to extend this idea to active matter, analyzing insertion space for repulsive active particles in one and two dimensions using both on- and off-lattice models. In 1D we derive closed-form expressions for the mean insertion cavity size, cavity number, and total insertion volume, all in excellent agreement with simulations. Strikingly, activity increases the total insertion volume and tends to keep the insertion space more connected. These results provide the first quantitative foundation for the stochastic geometry of active matter, and opens up a new route to building a thermodynamics of active systems.

Title: Controlling the collective transport of large passive particles with suspensions of microorganisms
Authors: Taha Laroussi, Julien Bouvard, Etienne Jambon-Puillet, Mojtaba Jarrahi, Gabriel Amselem
Abstract: A promising approach to transport cargo at the microscale lies within the use of self-propelled microorganisms, whose motion entrains that of passive particles. However, most applications remain limited to just a few passive particles of similar size as the microorganisms, since the transport mechanism relies on the interaction between individual swimmers and single particles. Here, we demonstrate how to control the collective transport of hundreds of large passive particles with phototactic microalga. Using directional light stimuli in suspensions of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, we trigger bioconvection rolls capable of macroscale transport. Passive particles an order of magnitude larger than the microalgae are either attracted or repelled by the rolls depending on their density. Using experiments and simulation, we rationalize these bioconvective flows and describe how to harness them for cargo transport, with future applications in targeted drug delivery and decontamination.

Title: Structural Phase Separation and Enhanced Superconductivity in La1.875Ba0.125CuO4 under Uniaxial Strain
Authors: Baizhi Gao, Ehsan Nikbin, Graham Johnstone, Ze Shi, Christopher Heath, Narayan Appathurai, Beatriz Diaz Moreno, Al Rahemtulla, G. D. Gu, John M. Tranquada, Jane Y. Howe, Young-June Kim
Abstract: Strain engineering has attracted significant attention in recent years due to its capability in tuning lattice and electronic structures of quantum materials. Using moderate uniaxial compressive strain, we induce structural phase separation in the low-temperature phase of x=1/8 La2-xBaxCuO4 (LBCO) single crystals. These structures are low temperature tetragonal (LTT), low temperature less orthorhombic (LTLO), and a plastically deformed nano-domain structure (PDNS), comprised of few-nanometer-sized orthorhombic domains within an amorphous matrix. These three structures exhibit distinct superconducting behaviors. The volume fraction of the LTT structure is suppressed with increasing strain, while its superconducting transition temperature increases and broadens. The LTLO structure exhibits a sharp superconducting transition above 32 K, which increases up to ~36 K at maximum strain. The PDNS phase exhibits a very broad superconducting transition and persists even after removing the strain. Our study illustrates the sensitivity of superconductivity to the structure of the LBCO sample near its stripe instability.

Title: Quantum phase with spontaneous translational symmetry breaking in an extended diamond chain
Authors: Hironori Yamaguchi, Shunsuke C. Furuya, Yu Tominaga, Akira Matsuo, Koichi Kindo
Abstract: We report the experimental realization of a spin-1/2 extended diamond chain in a verdazyl-Cu complex, where competing interactions and lattice distortions give rise to exotic quantum phases. The magnetic properties exhibit a zero-field energy gap and 1/2 magnetization plateau, which is explained by a dimer-monomer model. Considering the effective interactions between the monomers, three types of dimer-dimer phases are expected to appear as the ground state, depending on the magnitude of the lattice distortions. By mapping to the nonlinear sigma model, three phases are distinguished topologically, and a symmetry-protected topological phase equivalent to the Haldane phase is identified. Furthermore, a nontrivial magnetization is observed above the 1/2 plateau region, suggesting a gapped dimer phase accompanied by a spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry. The discovery of this rare quantum state has broad implications for strongly correlated systems, topological matter, and quantum information science, where symmetry and topology play crucial roles.

Title: Highly tunable Gilbert damping in two-dimensional van der Waals ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2: From bilayer to the twisted bilayer
Authors: Jie Wang, Shi-Bo Zhao, Jia-wan Li, Lin Zhuang, Yusheng Hou
Abstract: Van der Waals ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2 possesses both a high Curie temperature and robust perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, holding promise for practical spintronic applications. In particular, understanding and engineering its Gilbert damping which determines magnetization dynamics are crucial for its applications. Here, we investigate the Gilbert damping of bilayer and the twisted bilayer Fe3GaTe2 through first-principles calculations. For the bilayer Fe3GaTe2, we obtain a quite low Gilbert damping when its magnetization is along the z axis at room temperature. In addition, the bilayer Fe3GaTe2 exhibits a large orientational anisotropy of Gilbert damping when its magnetization is rotated from the magnetic easy axis to the hard one. Such anisotropy is attributed to the distinct band structures caused by the anisotropic spin-orbit coupling. Surprisingly, we find that twisting the bilayer Fe3GaTe2 can effectively reduce the Gilbert damping for the perpendicular magnetization, and enhance the orientational anisotropy of Gilbert damping up to 635% when rotating the magnetization from the magnetic easy axis to the hard one. These findings open up an entirely new avenue for the manipulation of Gilbert damping and its anisotropy in two-dimensional van der Waals ferromagnets.

Title: Reinterpretation of chiral anomaly on a lattice
Authors: Huan-Wen Wang, Bo Fu, Shun-Qing Shen
Abstract: The chiral anomaly is a quantum mechanical effect for massless Dirac fermions in both particle physics and condensed matter physics. Here we present a set of effective models for single massless Dirac fermions in one- and three-dimensions in the whole Brillouin zone from higher-dimensional Chern insulators, which uniquely capture both the chiral fermion behavior near the Dirac point and high-energy states at Brillouin zone boundaries. In the presence of electromagnetic fields, the chiral coefficient $C_{5}$ is found to be chemical-potential dependent in general, but quantized precisely at the Fermi surface where chiral symmetry is preserved. This result provides an alternative interpretation of chiral anomaly on a lattice: the anomaly is caused by the symmetry-broken states far below the Fermi surface, and protected by the local chiral symmetry. Our analysis here might provide a potential theoretical foundation for applying the concept of chiral anomaly in condensed matter physics.

Title: Moiré excitons in generalized Wigner crystals
Authors: Jing-Yang You, Chih-En Hsu, Zien Zhu, Benran Zhang, Ziliang Ye, Mit H. Naik, Ting Cao, Hung-Chung Hsueh, Steven G. Louie, Mauro Del Ben, Zhenglu Li
Abstract: Moiré superlattices of transition-metal dichalcogenide bilayers host strong Coulomb interactions residing in narrow electron bands, leading to correlated insulating states at fractional carrier doping densities, known as generalized Wigner crystals. In excited states, the formation of moiré excitons is expected to be fundamentally shaped by the Wigner-crystal ground states, manifesting an intricate interplay between electronic and excitonic correlations. However, the microscopic description of these Wigner crystalline excitons (WCEs) remains elusive, largely subject to speculations, and is further needed for the understanding of exotic excitonic phases (e.g., exciton insulators and exciton density waves) and their unique properties (e.g., anomalous exciton diffusion). Here, using first-principles many-body GW-Bethe-Salpeter-equation calculations, we directly reveal the internal structures of WCEs in angle-aligned MoSe2/MoS2 moiré heterostructure at hole fillings of 1/3 and 2/3. Our results unveil the propagation of correlation effects from the ground state to excited states, shaping the real-space characteristics of WCEs. The strong two-particle excitonic correlations dominate over the kinetic energy of free electron-hole pairs, in analog to the strong single-particle correlations of flat bands. We propose that such unusual excited-state correlation effects of WCEs can be experimentally probed by photocurrent tunneling microscopy. Our work provides a microscopic understanding of strongly correlated WCEs, suggesting them as a highly tunable mixed boson-fermion platform to study many-body interactions and phenomena.

Title: Sb doping effect on transport behavior in the topological insulator Bi2Se3
Authors: Shu-Wei Wang, Hang Chi, Jui-Che Chung
Abstract: Bismuth selenide (Bi2Se3) is a good topological insulator (TI) with its surface band Dirac point inside the bulk bandgap. However, Bi2Se3 films grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) often require tuning of Fermi level near the Dirac point for optimal proximity effect with magnetic or superconducting materials. In this study, we achieve the control of the Fermi level in MBE-grown Bi2Se3 thin films by antimony (Sb) doping and systematically investigate the transport properties of these Bi2-xSbxSe3 films with different doping concentrations. Excellent topological surface conduction is attained, and weak antilocalization is observed in all Sb-doped Bi2Se3 films. While the carrier mobility shows no dependence on the Sb concentrations, indicating that the phonon scattering dominates over the impurity scattering from Sb dopants, the coherence length varies significantly with the Sb doping level at low temperatures (< 30 K), highlighting the non-negligible electron-electron interactions in the low temperature regime. Furthermore, EuS/Bi2-xSbxSe3 heterostructures are fabricated to explore proximity-induced ferromagnetism in the TI surface states. However, the long-range magnetic order is not formed in the TI surface states under our growth conditions. Our results emphasize the critical role of interface quality for realizing exchange coupling. This work offers new insights into the interplay of disorder, decoherence, and scattering mechanisms in Sb-doped Bi2Se3 thin films, providing guidance for the future study of the proximity effect in heterostructures involving Sb-doped Bi2Se3.

Title: Impurity-Induced Interference at a Topological Boundary in an Infinite SSH Heterojunction
Authors: Hao-Ru Wu, Hong-Yi Chen, Yiing-Rei Chen
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the coupling between a strong impurity and the topological boundary of an SSH heterojunction, composed of two SSH chains belonging to different topological classes. We show that impurity boundary coupling gives rise to bonding and antibonding states within the SSH bulk gap. This coupling produces an interference effect in the local density of states, as the impurity approaches the boundary the LDOS evolves from a single sharp peak to a characteristic double peak structure. Moreover, the interference strength can be quantified by the decay length of the bonding or antibonding wavefunction and by the energy splitting of the LDOS resonance peaks near the Fermi energy.

Title: Percolation Diagrams Derived from First-Principles Investigation of Chemical Short-Range Order in Binary Alloys
Authors: Abhinav Roy, Karl Sieradzki, Michael J. Waters, James M. Rondinelli, Ian D. McCue
Abstract: Recent developments in the percolation theory of passivation have shown that chemical short-range order (SRO) affects the aqueous passivation behavior of alloys. However, there has been no systematic exploration to quantify these SRO effects on percolation in practical alloys and the related passivation behavior. In this study, we quantify the effects of SRO on percolation in a binary size-mismatched Cu-Rh alloy and study the related passivation behavior. We develop a mixed-space cluster expansion model trained on the mixing energy calculated using density functional theory. We use the cluster expansion model to sample the configuration space via variance-constrained semi-grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations and develop SRO diagrams over a range of compositions and temperatures. Building on this with the percolation crossover model, specifically the variation of percolation threshold with SRO in the FCC lattice, we construct the first nearest-neighbor chemical percolation diagram. These diagrams can inform the design of the next generation of corrosion-resistant metallic alloys.

Title: Nonlinear opto-magnetic signuature of d-wave altermagnets
Authors: Lijun Yang, Long Liang
Abstract: Altermagnetism, a recently discovered collinear magnetic order with net zero magnetization but exhibits spin-splitting band structure, has attracted much research interest due to the rich fundamental physics and possible applications. In this work, we investigate the opto-magnetic response of $d$-wave altermagnets, focusing on the inverse Cotton-Mouton effect--the induction of static magnetization via linearly polarized light. We find that the direction of the induced magnetization is determined by the Néel vector. Moreover, its magnitude exhibits a periodic dependence on the polarization angle of the incident light, a hallmark of the system's symmetry. Our findings demonstrate that the inverse Cotton-Mouton effect provides both a method of manipulating altermagnetic magnetization in altemagnets and a probe of their intrinsic properties.

Title: Two-dimensional materials as a multiproperty sensing platform
Authors: Dipankar Jana, Shubhrasish Mukherjee, Dmitrii Litvinov, Magdalena Grzeszczyk, Sergey Grebenchuk, MakarsŠiškins, Virgil Gavriliuc, Yihang Ouyang, Changyi Chen, Yuxuan Ye, Yiming Meng, Maciej Koperski
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials have disrupted materials science due to the development of van der Waals technology. It enables the stacking of ultrathin layers of materials characterized by vastly different electronic structures to create man-made heterostructures and devices with rationally tailored properties, circumventing limitations of matching crystal structures, lattice constants, and geometry of constituent materials and supporting substrates. 2D materials exhibit extraordinary mechanical flexibility, strong light-matter interactions driven by their excitonic response, single photon emission from atomic centers, stable ferromagnetism in sub-nm thin films, fractional quantum Hall effect in high-quality devices, and chemoselectivity at ultrahigh surface-to-volume ratio. Consequently, van der Waals heterostructures with atomically flat interfaces demonstrate an unprecedented degree of intertwined mechanical, chemical, optoelectronic, and magnetic properties. This constitutes a foundation for multiproperty sensing, based on complex intra- and intermaterial interactions, and a robust response to external stimuli originating from the environment. Here, we review recent progress in the development of sensing applications with 2D materials, highlighting the areas where van der Waals heterostructures offer the highest sensitivity, simultaneous responses to multiple distinct externalities due to their atomic thickness in conjunction with unique material combinations, and conceptually new sensing methodology.

Title: Electrically Controlled 0-$π$ Oscillations and Josephson Giant Magnetoresistor with PT-Symmetric Antiferromagnetic Bilayers
Authors: Jin-Xin Hu, Mengli Hu, Ying-Ming Xie, K. T. Law
Abstract: We propose that unconventional Josephson effects typically emerge in {\it PT}-symmetric antiferromagnetic (AFM) bilayer systems. When proximitized by a conventional superconductor, these systems host dominant interlayer Cooper pairing that features a distinctive spin texture enabled by the strong exchange field. Specifically, we demonstrate a novel mechanism for electrically tunable 0-$\pi$ oscillations in lateral Josephson junctions, controlled by an out-of-plane electric displacement field. This behavior originates from field-induced finite-momentum Cooper pairing, a hallmark of the unique layer-pseudospin structure in {\it PT}-symmetric AFM bilayers. Furthermore, we introduce a Josephson giant magnetoresistor based on these exotic spin-layer-locked Cooper pairs, in which the supercurrent exhibits a strong dependence on the internal Néel order. Our findings establish {\it PT}-symmetric AFM bilayers as a versatile platform for phase-controllable Josephson junctions and superconducting magnetic random-access memory, with promising applications in superconducting circuits and ultralow-power computing.

Title: Controlling GaN nucleation via O$_2$-plasma-perforated graphene masks on c-plane sapphire
Authors: Su Young An, Chinkyo Kim
Abstract: Atomically thin, perforated graphene on $c$-plane sapphire functions as a nanoscale mask that enables GaN growth through thru-holes. We tune the perforated-area fraction $f_p$ by controlled O$_2$-plasma exposure and quantify its impact on early-stage nucleation: the nucleation-site density scales with $f_p$, while the nucleation-delay time decreases approximately as $1/f_p$. Time-resolved areal coverage and domain counts exhibit systematic $f_p$-dependent trends. A kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) model that coarse-grains atomistic events -- adatom arrival, surface diffusion, attachment at exposed sapphire within perforations, and coalescence (the first front-front contact between laterally growing domains) -- reproduces these trends using a constant per-site nucleation rate. Fitting the kMC simulation data yields onset times t$_0$ for the nucleation delay that closely match independently observed no-growth thresholds (Set 1: 28.5s vs $\sim$30s; Set 2: 38s vs $\sim$35s), validating the kMC-experiment mapping and highlighting plasma dose as an activation threshold for plasma-induced through-hole formation in 2D materials. Together, experiment and kMC identify $f_p$ as a single, surface-engineerable parameter governing GaN nucleation statistics on perforated graphene masks, providing a quantitative basis and process window for epitaxial lateral overgrowth (ELOG)/thru-hole epitaxy (THE) workflows that employ two-dimensional masks.

Title: Membrane Heterogeneity Driven Dynamics of Multicomponent Vesicles in Shear Flow
Authors: Shuqi Tang, Steven M. Wise, John Lowengrub, Zhenlin Guo
Abstract: Despite their significance in biology and materials science, the dynamics of multicomponent vesicles under shear flow remain poorly understood because of their nonlinear and strongly coupled nature, especially regarding the role of membrane heterogeneity in driving nonequilibrium behavior. Here we present a thermodynamically consistent phase-field model, which is validated against experiments, for the quantitative investigation of these dynamics. While prior research has primarily focused on viscosity or bending rigidity contrasts, we demonstrate that surface tension heterogeneity can also trigger swinging and tumbling in vesicles under shear. Additionally, our systematic phase diagram reveals three previously unreported dynamical regimes arising from the interplay between bending rigidity heterogeneity and shear flow. Overall, our model provides a robust framework for understanding multicomponent vesicle dynamics, with findings offering new physical insights and design principles for tunable vesicle-based carriers.

Title: Crossover between kite growth and vibrational bridging in pillar-assisted controlled formation of carbon nanotube networks
Authors: Yuanjia Liu, Taiki Inoue, Yoshihiro Kobayashi
Abstract: Pillar-assisted growth is a technique in which short carbon nanotubes (CNTs) form suspended networks by growing across closely spaced microfabricated pillars. During growth, the CNT tips exhibit vibrations that allow them to bridge the neighboring pillars. To improve the complexity and controllability of the CNT networks, we introduce a kite-growth mechanism in which CNTs are elongated and aligned by gas flow during growth, enabling a longer bridging distance compared to vibrational bridging. By integrating theoretical modeling, simulations, and experimental synthesis, we found that CNT tip vibrations dominate bridging at short lengths, whereas gas flow increasingly influences alignment as CNTs grow longer. This results in a crossover behavior governed by gas flow and pillar arrangement. We also developed a bridging model based on geometric constraints to quantify the bridging behavior based on pillar spacing and angular accessibility. The statistical analysis of the resulting network structures demonstrates that the pillar arrangement significantly influences the connection types, with kite growth enabling more diverse network topologies. These findings provide design principles for tuning the density and structural complexity of suspended CNT networks, offering promising applications in nanoscale electrical interconnect wiring and three-dimensional circuit architectures.

Title: Non-equilibrium lifetimes of DNA under electronic current in a molecular junction
Authors: Julian A. Lawn, Nicholas S. Davis, Daniel S. Kosov
Abstract: We investigate the non-equilibrium mechanical motion of double-stranded DNA in a molecular junction under electronic current using Keldysh-Langevin molecular dynamics. Non-equilibrium electronic force reshapes the effective potential energy surface, and along with electronic viscosity force and stochastic force, governs voltage-dependent dynamics of DNA's collective mechanical coordinate. We compute mean first-passage times to quantify the non-equilibrium lifetime of the DNA junction. At low voltage biases, electron-mechanical motion coupling destabilises DNA by shifting the potential minimum towards critical displacement and suppressing barriers, shortening lifetimes by several orders of magnitude. Unexpectedly, at higher voltages the trend reverses: the potential minimum shifts away from instability and the barrier re-emerges, producing re-stabilisation of the junction. In addition, we demonstrate the Landauer blowtorch effect in this system: coordinate-dependent fluctuations generate a spatially varying effective temperature, changing current-induced dynamics of mechanical degrees of freedom. Apparent temperatures of DNA mechanical motion increase far above ambient due to current-induced heating, correlating with suppressed electronic current at stronger couplings. Our results reveal a non-equilibrium interplay between current-driven forces, dissipation, and fluctuations in DNA junctions, establishing mechanisms for both destabilisation and recovery of DNA stability under electronic current.

Title: Comparative study of terbium tellurides Tb2Te5 and TbTe3

Abstract: Two terbium tellurides, TbTe3 and Tb2Te5, were studied by means of thermodynamics, ultrafast pump-probe spectroscopy and torque magnetometry. While crystal structure and some physical properties of TbTe3 were established previously, the crystal structure of Tb2Te5 was solved only in this work in the orthorhombic space group Cmcm with the parameters of unit cell a = 4.3120(5), b = 41.0305(76) and c = 4.2979(8) Å. In contrast to TbTe3, which experiences three successive magnetic phase transitions, Tb2Te5 orders antiferromagnetically in two steps at TN1 = 9.0 K and TN2 = 6.8 K, both readily suppressed by an external magnetic field. The third transition in TbTe3 is due to the interaction of the magnetic subsystem with the charge density waves. The interaction of magnetic and electronic subsystems in Tb2Te5 has been revealed by the pump probe. Torque measurements of TbTe3 show that the magnetic moments of Tb are oriented predominantly in the ac plane at high temperatures and switch to the b axis at low temperatures. In Tb2Te5, the magnetic moments of Tb are oriented predominantly in the ac plane at low temperatures.

Title: Treasure Map Toward Skyrmion Evolution in Ambient Conditions: A Perspective from Electronic Instabilities and the Density of Energy
Authors: Xudong Huai, Thao T. Tran
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions with topologically protected properties are anticipated to shape the future of electronics. Understanding how skyrmions may evolve in ambient conditions presents a key challenge in the pursuit of technologically significant materials. In this perspective, we focus on electronic instabilities and the density of energy of established skyrmion hosts, where a pathway to a skyrmion phase transition is readily available, to identify signposts for the emergence of skyrmions. We value the impressive research efforts in the field that have built the foundation for many more enticing breakthroughs to come. We share a framework that connects the electronic origins of skyrmion formation to the temperature and field requirements, allowing predictions of candidate materials that may host skyrmions at ambient conditions (the treasure).

Title: Trans-scale spin Seebeck effect in nanostructured bulk composites based on magnetic insulator
Authors: Sang J. Park, Hirata Keisuke, Hossein Sepehri-Amin, Fuyuki Ando, Takamasa Hirai, Ken-ichi Uchida
Abstract: The spin Seebeck effect (SSE) enables thermoelectric conversion through thermally generated spin currents in magnetic materials, offering a promising transverse geometry for scalable devices. However, conventional SSE devices are confined to nanoscale thin-film architectures, with significantly restricted output power due to the intrinsic constraints of spin and magnon diffusion lengths. Here, we demonstrate a trans-scale SSE using nano-structured bulk composite materials composed of Pt-coated yttrium iron garnet (YIG) powders fabricated via dynamic powder sputtering and low-temperature sintering. The resulting three-dimensional composites exhibit continuous Pt channels and robust mechanical integrity. The effective electrical conductivity of the composites is 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than conventional thin-film-based YIG/Pt devices. Transverse thermoelectric measurements confirm isotropic SSE signals at the bulk scale. This work establishes a scalable platform for bulk SSE-based thermoelectrics, bridging nanoscale spin caloritronics with macroscopic device integration.

Title: Capillary rise on hydrogel surfaces
Authors: Anagha Datar, Joonas Ryssy, Aku O. Toivonen, Matilda Backholm
Abstract: Capillary rise occurs when a thin tube contacts a liquid, which rises against gravity due to the capillary force. This phenomenon is present in a wide range of everyday and industrial settings and provides the means to measure the physical properties of liquids. Here, we report on the unusual ultra-slow capillary rise on a solid-like material of agarose hydrogels. The observed meniscus motion cannot be described with classical capillary rise models, and we develop a new model based on the fluid transport through the porous hydrogel network. Our model is in good agreement with the experimental data for agarose gels made with five different concentrations and with two different viscosities of the liquid flowing inside the gel. Our results provide a non-invasive technique to directly estimate the permeability of hydrogel interfaces, which is crucial for the implementation of hydrogels in different bioadhesion applications.

Title: An Efficient Phase-Transition Framework for Gate-Tunable Superconductivity in Monolayer WTe$_2$
Authors: F. Yang, G. D. Zhao, Y. Shi, L. Q. Chen
Abstract: The recently reported gate-tunable superconductivity in monolayer WTe$_2$ exhibits several striking anomalies beyond the standard paradigm, including a contrasting carrier-density dependence of the transition temperature $T_c$ in weakly and strongly disordered regimes and more surprisingly, the sudden disappearance of superconducting fluctuations below a critical carrier density. To understand these features, we go beyond the mean-field theory to treat the superconducting gap and superfluid density by explicitly incorporating both Nambu-Goldstone (NG) phase fluctuations and Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) fluctuations. We show that these fluctuations are minimal in the weak-disorder regime but become crucial under strong disorder, where the zero-temperature gap renormalized by NG quantum fluctuations becomes density-dependent while the BKT fluctuations drive the superconducting $T_c$ below the gap-closing temperature. Simulations within this unified framework combining with the density-functional-theory input to account for the excitonic instability quantitatively reproduced nearly all key experimental observations in monolayer WTe$_2$, providing a consistent understanding of reported anomalies.

Title: Ultrafast Spin Injection in Graphene via Dynamical Carrier Filtering at Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Interfaces
Authors: Shunsuke Yamada, Arqum Hashmi, Tomohito Otobe
Abstract: We report a real-time first-principles study of ultrafast spin injection in a WSe$_2$-graphene heterobilayer under circularly polarized laser irradiation, using time-dependent density functional theory. Contrary to conventional expectations, spin transfer into graphene is not a passive process but is actively driven by spin-selective carrier filtering at the interface. Spin-polarized carriers generated in the WSe$_2$ layer induce a preferential migration of opposite-spin carriers from graphene, which results in net spin magnetization in graphene. This process is governed by interlayer band offsets, density-of-state asymmetry, and Pauli blocking. These findings indicate a microscopic mechanism of spin injection in non-magnetic systems and identify a guiding principle for the design of ultrafast opto-spintronic functionalities in van der Waals heterostructures.

Title: Layer-dependent Charge Transfer and inter-layer coupling in WSe2/Graphene Heterostructures
Authors: Lan Huang, Laric Bobzien, Ángel Labordet Álvarez, Daniel E. Cintron Figueroa, Li-Syuan Lu, Chengye Dong, Joshua A. Robinson, Bruno Schuler, Mirjana Dimitrievska
Abstract: Understanding interfacial interactions in two-dimensional (2D) heterostructures is essential for advancing optoelectronic and quantum technologies. We investigate metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD)-grown WSe$_2$ films (one to five layers) on graphene/SiC, directly compared to exfoliated WSe$_2$ on SiO$_2$, using Raman and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy complemented by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Raman measurements reveal compressive strain and interfacial charge transfer in WSe$_2$/graphene heterostructures, evidenced by blue-shifted phonon modes and the emergence of higher-order interlayer breathing modes absent on SiO$_2$. Concomitant shifts and attenuation of graphene's G and 2D modes with increasing WSe$_2$ thickness indicate progressive p-type doping of graphene, while WSe$_2$ phonon shifts point to n-type doping of the semiconductor, consistent with interfacial electron transfer. PL shows strong quenching for monolayer WSe$_2$ on graphene due to ultrafast charge transfer and F"orster resonance energy transfer (FRET), with partial emission recovery in multilayers relative to SiO$_2$-supported flakes. Exciton behavior differs strongly between substrates: on SiO$_2$, A- and B-exciton energies vary markedly with thickness, whereas on graphene they remain nearly pinned. This stability reflects the combined effects of graphene's strong dielectric screening and charge-transfer-induced free-carrier screening, with strain playing a secondary role. These results establish graphene, unlike SiO$_2$, as an active interfacial partner that stabilizes excitonic states and enables engineering of the optical response of 2D heterostructures.

Title: Comprehensive Structure Exploration and Thermodynamics of Heteroatom Doped Graphene Superstructures
Authors: Benedict Saunders, Lukas Hörmann, Reinhard J. Maurer
Abstract: Graphene has been studied in detail due to its mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties. It is well documented that the introduction of dopants or defects in the lattice can be used to tune material properties for a specific application, such as in electronics, sensors, or catalysis. To design graphene with specific properties, one must achieve control over the composition and concentration of defects. This requires a fundamental understanding of the stability of defects and their interaction in a superstructure. We present a comprehensive defect structure determination approach that enables close to exhaustive enumeration of all relevant defect structures. The approach uses a combination of Density Functional Theory and machine learning to build a transferable energy model for defect formation. Henceforth, we show the capabilities of our approach for a proof-of-principle application on free-standing graphene with heteroatom defects. This allows us to provide physical insights into defect interactions and to establish a thermodynamic model to investigate how temperature affects the configuration space of doped graphene.

Title: Adsorption Barrier Limits the Ice Inhibition Activity of Glycan-Rich Antifreeze Glycoproteins
Authors: Wentao Yang, Zhaoru Sun
Abstract: Antifreeze glycoproteins (AFGPs) are among the most potent ice recrystallization inhibition (IRI) agents, yet the molecular basis for their counterintuitive decline in activity with increasing glycosylated threonine (T*) content remains unresolved. Through molecular dynamics simulations of model glycoproteins with increasing T* content, we show that potent IRI activity arises not only from the thermodynamic stability of strong ice-binding states, but also from their kinetic accessibility. Specifically, the free energy barrier for forming strong ice-binding states from the unbound state constitutes a critical kinetic bottleneck. Increasing T* content enhances the overall hydration capacity due to the additional glycan moieties, thereby imposing a greater desolvation penalty and elevating the adsorption barrier. This kinetic limitation, rather than the absence of strong ice-binding states, accounts for the experimentally observed decline in IRI activity. To quantify the structural basis of this behavior, we introduce a facial amphiphilicity index that integrates both spatial segregation and compositional ratio of hydrophilic and hydrophobic residues, and show that it correlates well with IRI activity. These findings highlight that facial amphiphilicity mediates a critical balance between binding stability and kinetic accessibility, providing a rational design principle for advanced IRI materials.

Title: Diameter-Controlled High-Order Vortex States and Magnon Hybridization in VSe2 Nanotubes
Authors: Jia-Wen Li, Xin-Wei Yi, Jin Zhang, Gang Su, Bo Gu
Abstract: Curved magnets offer a rich phase diagram and hold great promise for next-generation spintronic technologies. This study establishes the paramount significance of high-order vortex states (e.g., 3$\varphi$ with winding number $n$ > 1) in VSe2 nanotubes, which uniquely enable magnonic functionalities fundamentally inaccessible to conventional magnetic systems. These states arise from diameter-dependent competition between the nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic ($J_1$) and longer-range antiferromagnetic ($J_2$/$J_3$) couplings, as rigorously validated through density-functional theory calculations and Heisenberg modeling of phase diagrams. Critically, by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, we find that high-order vortex configurations unlock an intrinsic hybridization mechanism governed by strict orbital angular momentum (OAM) selection rules ($\Delta l = \pm 2(n-1)$) -- a process strictly forbidden in fundamental vortices ($n$ = 1) -- generating complex high-OAM magnons with measurable topological charge. This is vividly demonstrated in the 3$\varphi$ state, where hybridization between $l$ = -4, 0 and 4 modes produces eight-petal magnon density patterns. Such states provide an essential platform-free solution for generating high-OAM magnons, wchich is crucial for spin-wave-based information transport. These findings establish a predictive theoretical framework for controlling high-order vortex states in curved magnets and highlight VSe2 nanotubes as a promising platform for exploring complex magnetism and developing future magnonic and spintronic devices.

Title: Terahertz nonlinear response in cuprate superconductors and the Higgs field in doped Mott insulators
Authors: Xiang Li, Zheng-Yu Weng
Abstract: A puzzling phenomenon has been recently revealed in terahertz nonlinear optical response experiments: A third harmonic generation (THG) signal, identified only in the superconducting (SC) phase in a conventional BCS superconductor, is found to persist into a wide pseudogap regime in the underdoped cuprate, accompanied by a $\pi$ phase shift in the THG signal across the SC transition. In this paper, we offer a consistent understanding of such an unconventional phenomenon based on an emergent Higgs mode of the condensed holons in the doped Mott insulator. Specifically, in the lower pseudogap phase (LPP) where, although the holons still remain Bose condensed, the SC phase coherence gets disordered by excited spinons, which induce vortex-like responses from the holon condensate. By coupling to such internal fluctuations described by a mutual Chern-Simons gauge theory, we show that an external electromagnetic field can indeed produce the optical THG response in both the SC and LPP states, which are distinguished by a $\pi$ phase shift with a substantial suppression of the THG signal in the latter regime at higher temperatures.

Title: Recent progress in nickelate superconductors
Authors: Yuxin Wang, Kun Jiang, Jianjun Ying, Tao Wu, Jinguang Cheng, Jiangping Hu, Xianhui Chen
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in nickelate compounds has opened new avenues in the study of high-temperature superconductors. Here we provide a comprehensive overview of recent progress in the field, including all different nickelate systems, reduced-Ruddlesden-Popper-type infinite layer LaNiO$_2$, Ruddlesden-Popper-type bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. We begin by introducing the superconducting properties of the hole-doped LaNiO$_2$ system, which marked the starting point for nickelate superconductivity. We then turn to the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ system, discussing both its high-pressure and thin-film superconducting phases. This is followed by an examination of the trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ system and other related multilayer nickelates. Throughout the review, we highlight emerging trends, key challenges, and open questions. We conclude by addressing current limitations in materials synthesis and characterization, and future directions that may help uncover the mechanisms driving superconductivity in these complex oxide systems.

Title: Facet: highly efficient E(3)-equivariant networks for interatomic potentials
Authors: Nicholas Miklaucic, Lai Wei, Rongzhi Dong, Nihang Fu, Sadman Sadeed Omee, Qingyang Li, Sourin Dey, Victor Fung, Jianjun Hu
Abstract: Computational materials discovery is limited by the high cost of first-principles calculations. Machine learning (ML) potentials that predict energies from crystal structures are promising, but existing methods face computational bottlenecks. Steerable graph neural networks (GNNs) encode geometry with spherical harmonics, respecting atomic symmetries -- permutation, rotation, and translation -- for physically realistic predictions. Yet maintaining equivariance is difficult: activation functions must be modified, and each layer must handle multiple data types for different harmonic orders. We present Facet, a GNN architecture for efficient ML potentials, developed through systematic analysis of steerable GNNs. Our innovations include replacing expensive multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for interatomic distances with splines, which match performance while cutting computational and memory demands. We also introduce a general-purpose equivariant layer that mixes node information via spherical grid projection followed by standard MLPs -- faster than tensor products and more expressive than linear or gate layers. On the MPTrj dataset, Facet matches leading models with far fewer parameters and under 10% of their training compute. On a crystal relaxation task, it runs twice as fast as MACE models. We further show SevenNet-0's parameters can be reduced by over 25% with no accuracy loss. These techniques enable more than 10x faster training of large-scale foundation models for ML potentials, potentially reshaping computational materials discovery.

Title: Resonant current-in-plane spin-torque diode effect in magnet$-$normal metal bilayers
Authors: Ulli Gems, Oliver Franke, Piet W. Brouwer
Abstract: Via the spin-Hall effect and its inverse, in-plane charge currents in a normal metal$-$ferromagnet (N$|$F) bilayer can be used to excite and detect magnetization dynamics in F. Using a magneto-electric circuit approach, we here consider the current response to quadratic order in the applied electric field, which is resonantly enhanced for driving frequencies close to frequencies of coherent magnetization modes. Our theory can be applied to bilayers with a magnetic insulator or with a magnetic metal. It focuses on the contribution of coherent magnetization dynamics to spin currents collinear with the equilibrium magnetization direction, but also takes into account relaxation of spin accumulation via spin currents carried by incoherent magnons and conduction electrons in F.

Title: Line defects in infinite networks of resistors
Authors: Róbert Németh, József Cserti, Gábor Széchenyi
Abstract: We study infinite resistor networks perturbed by line defects, in which the resistances are periodically modified along a single line. Using the Sherman-Morrison identity applied to the reciprocal-space representation of the lattice Green's function, we develop a general analytical framework for computing the equivalent resistance between arbitrary nodes. The resulting expression is a one-dimensional integral that is evaluated exactly in special cases. While our analysis is carried out for the square lattice, the method readily extends to other lattice geometries and networks with general impedances. Therefore, this framework is useful for studying the boundary behavior of topolectrical circuits, which serve as classical analogs of topological insulators.

Title: From Kardar-Parisi-Zhang scaling to soliton proliferation in Josephson junction arrays
Authors: Mikheil Tsitsishvili, Reinhold Egger, Karsten Flensberg, Sebastian Diehl
Abstract: We propose Josephson junction arrays as realistic platforms for observing nonequilibrium scaling laws characterizing the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class, and space-time soliton proliferation. Focusing on a two-chain ladder geometry, we perform numerical simulations for the roughness function. Together with analytical arguments, our results predict KPZ scaling at intermediate time scales, extending over sufficiently long time scales to be observable, followed by a crossover to the asymptotic long-time regime governed by soliton proliferation.

Title: Probing up-conversion electroluminescence of decoupled porphyrin molecules in a plasmonic nanocavity
Authors: Li-Qing Zheng, Fábio J.R. Costa, Abhishek Grewal, Ruonan Wang, Fengmin Wang, Wei Li, Anna Rosławska, Klaus Kuhnke, Klaus Kern
Abstract: Molecular triplet states can produce significant phosphorescence and act as a relay state for luminescence, such as in up-conversion processes. While this property makes triplet emitters interesting for organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), the study of their luminescence at the single molecule level in high resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is challenging. We investigate individual Pd-octaethylporphyrin (PdOEP) molecules decoupled from Ag(100) and Ag(111) by an ultrathin NaCl layer and observe singlet and triplet emission lines at visible wavelengths, only about 100 nm apart from each other. This is in stark contrast to the metal or free-base phthalocyanines, for which typically the lowest triplet transitions lie in the far red or infrared where the sensitivity of CCD camera decreases significantly. The singlet S1 state of PdOEP emits photons even when the photon energy is higher than the energy provided by a tunneling electron, in an energy up-conversion process. This mechanism requires a relay (or shelving) state in which energy is stored in the molecule for the interval between tunneling electrons. Analyzing the energy levels of different molecular states (S1, D0, and T1 states) and fitting the current dependencies of S1 under up-conversion electroluminescence (UCEL) condition for S1 and T1 emission, we verify the validity of a triplet-mediated up-conversion model. We also discuss a preliminary result for coupling with a neighboring molecule.

Title: Visualizing phonon edge states on molybdenum disulphide
Authors: Patrick Giese, Mathias Stokkebye Nissen, Stig Helveg, Jakob Schiøtz
Abstract: We employ Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations to study atom vibrational amplitudes in carbon-supported Molybdenum Disulphide (MoS2) nanoparticles. Enhanced and correlated atom vibrational amplitudes are observed as the nanoparticle edges are approached from the bulk, consistent with recent experimental High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-TEM) observations by Chen et al (Nature Communications 12, 5007 (2021). Analysis of phonon modes in finite systems explains the experimental observation by low-energy phonon modes confined at the nanoparticle edge, underscoring the need of full MD modeling for accurate HR-TEM image interpretation. Noticeably, we introduce a workflow for training Equivariant Neural Network-based machine learning potentials using limited Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. This approach effectively captures both covalent and van der Waals interactions, enabling accurate extrapolations of DFT calculations to larger systems with built-in error estimation.

Title: Benchmarking CHGNet Universal Machine Learning Interatomic Potential Against DFT and EXAFS: Case of Layered WS2 and MoS2
Authors: Pjotrs Žguns, Inga Pudza, Alexei Kuzmin
Abstract: Universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) deliver near ab initio accuracy in energy and force calculations at low computational cost, making them invaluable for materials modeling. Although uMLIPs are pre-trained on vast ab initio datasets, rigorous validation remains essential for their ongoing adoption. In this study, we use the CHGNet uMLIP to model thermal disorder in isostructural layered 2Hc-WS2 and 2Hc-MoS2, benchmarking it against ab initio data and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra, which capture thermal variations in bond lengths and angles. Fine-tuning CHGNet with compound-specific ab initio (DFT) data mitigates the systematic softening (i.e., force underestimation) typical of uMLIPs and simultaneously improves alignment between molecular dynamics-derived and experimental EXAFS spectra. While fine-tuning with a single DFT structure is viable, using ~100 structures is recommended to accurately reproduce EXAFS spectra and achieve DFT-level accuracy. Benchmarking the CHGNet uMLIP against both DFT and experimental EXAFS data reinforces confidence in its performance and provides guidance for determining optimal fine-tuning dataset sizes.

Title: Approximation in Lattice Field Theories
Authors: Thomas Banks, Anish Suresh
Abstract: We investigate an approximation to the Schwinger-Dyson (SD) equations of the collective Coulomb field of the large $N$ homogeneous electron fluid. The large $N$ approximation transforms the infinite SD hierarchy is into a set of closed, equations for 1 and 2-pt correlators. In this paper, the dynamics of a toy model - a small square Euclidean lattice with periodic boundary conditions - are considered. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo numerical method evaluated the 1 and 2-pt correlation functions on a $2 \times 2$ and $3 \times 3$ lattice. The derived equations are checked with the correlator values, and an agreement at $N \sim 10^3$ to order $10^{-3}$ was found. The agreement can be further strengthened by increasing runs in the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method.

Title: Observation of tunable chiral spin textures with nonlinear optics

Abstract: Chiral spin textures, such as spin spirals and skyrmions, are key to advancing spintronics by enabling ultrathin, energy-efficient memory, and high-density data storage and processing. However, their realization remains hindered by the scarcity of suitable host materials and the formidable experimental challenges associated with the characterization of these intricate chiral magnetic states. Here, we report the observation of tunable chiral magnetic textures in van der Waals magnet CrPS$_4$ with nonlinear optics. These tunable textures exhibit strong chiral third-order nonlinear optical responses, driven by interlayer and intralayer spin couplings under varying magnetic fields and temperatures. These pronounced chiral nonlinear optical responses highlight the potency and high sensitivity of the nonlinear optical readout for probing non-collinear magnetic orders. Moreover, our findings position van der Waals magnets and their heterostructures as an exceptional platform for reconfigurable spin-photonics and spintronics, unifying optical, electrical, and magnetic properties through unique intralayer and interlayer spin coupling properties and effective spin interaction between photons and electrons.

Title: Hysteresis and the Barkhausen noise in magnets
Authors: Deepak Dhar, Sanjib Sabhapandit
Abstract: We provide an overview of studies of hysteresis in models of magnets. We discuss the shape of the hysteresis loop, dynamical symmetry breaking, and the dependence of the area of the loop on the amplitude and frequency of the driving field. The Barkhausen noise in the hysteresis loop may be modelled by the wide distribution of sizes of magnetization jumps in the random-field Ising model. We discuss the distribution of sizes of these jumps in the random field Ising model on the Bethe lattice.

Title: Constraint correlation functions of the Ising model in the scaling limit
Authors: Ivan Balog, Adam Rançon
Abstract: We study the correlation function of the one-dimensional Ising model at fixed magnetization. Focusing on the scaling limit close to the zero-temperature fixed point, we show that this correlation function, in momentum space, exhibits surprising oscillations as a function of the magnetization. We show that these oscillations have a period inversely proportional to the momentum and give an interpretation in terms of domain walls. This is in sharp contrast with the behavior of the correlation function in constant magnetic fields, and sheds light on recent results obtained by Monte Carlo simulations of the critical two-dimensional Ising model at fixed magnetization.

Title: Inverse Clausius Thermodynamics in Run-and-Tumble Dynamics
Authors: Oded Farago
Abstract: We consider a one-dimensional run-and-tumble particle (RTP) confined by an external potential and coupled to a thermal reservoir. Starting from the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation, we derive an explicit expression for the local entropy flux between the system and the heat bath. We then construct a thermodynamic representation of the RTP dynamics, modeling the system as an overdamped particle in a medium with a spatially inhomogeneous effective temperature field, determined directly from the entropy flux. This forms the basis of an Inverse Clausius Thermodynamics framework, in which thermodynamic quantities are inferred from entropy exchange with the heat bath rather than postulated. In addition to an exact expression for the entropy flux, the framework introduces a physically motivated approximation for evaluating the local entropy production rate. The approach is computationally efficient and broadly applicable, and is particularly well suited for RTP models where propulsion velocities are redrawn from a continuous distribution at each tumbling event rather than restricted to discrete states.

Title: Shape-specific fluctuations of an active colloidal interface
Authors: Arvin Subramaniam, Tirthankar Banerjee, Rajesh Singh
Abstract: Motivated by a recently synthesized class of active interfaces formed by linked self-propelled colloids, we investigate the dynamics and fluctuations of a phoretically (chemically) interacting active interface with roto-translational coupling. We enumerate all steady-state shapes of the interface across parameter space and identify a regime where the interface acquires a finite curvature, leading to a characteristic C-shaped topology, along with persistent self-propulsion. In this phase, the interface height fluctuations obey Family-Vicsek scaling but with novel exponents: a dynamic exponent $z_h \approx 0.6$, a roughness exponent $\alpha_h \approx 0.9$ and a super-ballistic growth exponent $\beta_h \approx 1.5$. In contrast, the orientational fluctuations of the colloidal monomers exhibit a negative roughness exponent, reflecting a surprising smoothness law, where steady-state fluctuations diminish with increasing system size. Together, these findings reveal a unique non-equilibrium universality class associated with self-propelled interfaces of non-standard shape.

Title: Accelerating first-principles molecular-dynamics thermal conductivity calculations for complex systems
Authors: Sandro Wieser, YuJie Cen, Georg K. H. Madsen, Jesús Carrete
Abstract: Atomistic simulations of heat transport in complex materials are costly and hard to converge. This has led to the development of several noise reduction techniques applicable to equilibrium molecular-dynamics simulations. We analyze the performance of those strategies, taking InAs nanowires as our benchmark due to the diverse structures and complex phonon spectra of these quasi-1D systems. We demonstrate how, for low-thermal-conductivity systems, cepstral analysis can reduce computational demands while still delivering accurate results that do not require discarding arbitrary parts of the dataset. However, issues with this approach are revealed when treating high-thermal-conductivity systems, where the thermal conductivity is significantly underestimated. We discuss alternative methods to be used in that situation, relying on uncertainty propagation from independent simulations. We show that the contributions of the covariance matrix have to be included for a quantitative assessment of the error. The combination of these strategies with machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) provides an accelerated, robust workflow applicable to a diverse set of systems, as our examples using a highly transferable MACE potential illustrate.

Title: Microstructural Control and Heat Transport Enhancement in Lanthanum Sulfate for Thermochemical Heat Storage
Authors: Kunihiko Shizume, Naoyuki Hatada
Abstract: Enhancing heat transport within thermochemical heat storage (TCHS) materials is essential for improving the heat output. A common strategy is combining salts with highly conductive additives such as carbon or metals. However, such composites often suffer from drawbacks including interfacial instability and a reduction of gas permeability. In this work, we propose an alternative approach based on microstructural orientation control, aiming to create efficient heat transport pathways without relying on conductive additives. As a model material, La$_2$(SO$_4$)$_3$ was selected, which undergoes reversible hydration and dehydration below 250 °C. Centimeter-scale hexagonal prismatic La$_2$(SO$_4$)$_3\cdot$9H$_2$O grains were grown from solution and then formed into plate-shaped specimens either parallel to the longitudinal direction or transverse to it, and then dehydrated to $\beta$-La$_2$(SO$_4$)$_3$. Laser flash analysis revealed clear orientation-dependent thermal diffusivity of pre-dehydrated $\beta$-La$_2$(SO$_4$)$_3$, with values of about 0.24 mm$^2$/s for the longitudinal plate and about 0.15 mm$^2$/s for the transverse plate at room temperature. Microstructural observations indicated the formation of aligned rod-like domains, suggesting that orientation provides an efficient heat transport pathway. These findings demonstrate that controlling orientation provides a viable route to enhance heat transport in TCHS materials, offering a new design approach.

Title: Stochastic Modeling of Fish Schooling Dynamics: Decomposition into Collective and Individual Movements
Authors: Elena G. de Lamo, M. Carmen Miguel, Romualdo Pastor-Satorras
Abstract: The movement of fish in schools can be effectively modeled using stochastic frameworks, particularly through descriptions based on random walk dynamics. In this study, we analyze fish motion by decomposing it into two components: the movement of the school's center of mass and the relative motion of individual fish with respect to this center. We demonstrate that the center of mass follows an active random walk subjected to hard wall interactions and driven by white noise, while individual fish move independently within an effective field generated by the group. Their trajectories can be described as active random walks within a potential shaped by the spatial distribution of the school, influenced by multiplicative noise. Our findings enhance the understanding of collective animal behavior and offer valuable insights into the stochastic modeling of fish movement.

Title: Quantifying the liquid-liquid transition in cold water/glycerol mixtures by ih-RIDME
Authors: Sergei Kuzin, Maxim Yulikov
Abstract: Water/glycerol mixtures are common for experiments with biomacromolecules at cryogenic temperatures due to their vitrification properties. Above the glass transition temperature, they undergo liquid-liquid phase separation. Using the novel EPR technique called intermolecular hyperfine Relaxation-Induced Dipolar Modulation Enhancement (ih-RIDME), we quantified the molar composition in frozen water/glycerol mixtures with one or the other component deuterated after the phase transition. Our experiments reveal nearly equal phase composition regardless of the proton/deuterium isotope balance. With the new ih-RIDME data, we can also revisit the already reported body of glass transition data for such mixtures and build a consistent picture for water/glycerol freezing and phase transitions. Our results also indicate that ih-RIDME has the potential for investigating the solvation shells of spin-labelled macromolecules.

Title: Intertwined polar, chiral, and ferro-rotational orders in a rotation-only insulator
Authors: Weizhe Zhang, June Ho Yeo, Xiaoyu Guo, Tony Chiang, Nishkarsh Agarwal, John T. Heron, Kai Sun, Junjie Yang, Sang-Wook Cheong, Youngjun Ahn, Liuyan Zhao
Abstract: Intertwined orders refer to strongly coupled and mutually dependent orders that coexist in correlated electron systems, often underpinning key physical properties of the host materials. Among them, polar, chiral, and ferro-rotational orders have been theoretically known to form a closed set of intertwined orders. However, experimental investigation into their mutual coupling and physical consequences has remained elusive. In this work, we employ the polar-chiral insulator Ni$_3$TeO$_6$ as a platform and utilize a multimodal optical approach to directly probe and reveal the intertwining among polarity, chirality, and ferro-rotational order. We demonstrate how their coupling governs the formation of domains and dictates the nature of domain walls. Within the domains, we identify spatial inversion symmetry as the operation connecting two domain states of opposite polarity and chirality, with a common ferro-rotational state serving as the prerequisite for these interlocked configurations. At the domain walls, we observe a pronounced enhancement of in-plane polarization accompanied by a suppression of chirality. By combining with Ginzburg-Landau theory within the framework of a pre-existing ferro-rotational background, we uncover the emergence of mixed Néel- and Bloch-type domain walls. Our findings highlight the critical role of intertwined orders in defining domain and domain wall characteristics and open pathways for domain switching and domain wall control via intertwined order parameters.

Title: Actin driven morphogenesis in hydra
Authors: Sabyasachi Mukherjee, Anirban Sain
Abstract: Hydra, a centimeter long cylindrical-shaped freshwater organism, has emerged as an interesting model system for studying morphogenesis in animals. Recently, fluorescent imaging of cytoskeletal actin filaments on the outer surface of hydra has revealed nematic-type arrangement of actin filaments. {Several topological defects in the nematic field have also been detected. In particular, aster-like +1 defects appear at the curved head of hydra and at the tip of its tentacles, while -1/2 defects are seen at the base of the tentacles. However, functional role of these defects in tissue development is not clear. Motivated by these observations, we here model hydra's epthelial tissue as a visco-elastic membrane and the tentacles as growing membrane tubes driven by a nematic interaction among actin. We consider the epithelial layer of hydra as a fluid membrane and carry out a non-equilibrium simulation which also includes membrane growth and polymerization of actin. We show that specific kind of defect at the head does not play any positive role in emergence of the tentacles. The reorganization of actin at the base and the tip of growing tentacles are consistent with other possible defect structures at the head as well. While it is known that regions of tentacle growth are hot spots of chemical signaling, involving Wnt3/$\beta$-catenin pathway, we propose that active polymerization of actin bundles could also be an important player in the growth of tubular tentacles. In addition to polymerization, fluidity of our model membrane, capturing effective fluidity of the epithelial tissue, turns out to be essential for enabling such growth.

Title: A Local-Phase Framework for the BaTi_{1-x}Zr_xO_3$ Phase Diagram: From Ferroelectricity to Dipolar Glass
Authors: M. Sepliarsky, F. Aquistapace, F. Di Rino, R. Machado, M.G. Stachiotti
Abstract: We apply a first-principles-based atomistic model to investigate the BaTi(1-x)Zr(x)O3 phase diagram, focusing on both macroscopic and local structural changes. Our approach, which combines molecular dynamics with machine learning techniques, accurately captures the influence of Ti and Zr cations on their local environment and its evolution with composition and temperature. The computed phase diagram shows excellent agreement with existing experimental and theoretical data. Beyond reproducing known results, our analysis reveals that the behavior of the solid solution across different compositions and temperatures can be understood in terms of coexisting Ti cells with different symmetries, whose stability depends on the local B-site configuration. This local-phase-based approach provides a unified description of the distinct regions of the solid solution, including ferroelectric, relaxor, and dipolar glass phases, and captures the continuous evolution from one regime to another. Our findings demonstrate how atomic-level distortions drive the complex macroscopic behavior of the material.

Title: Persistent spin texture preserved by local symmetry in graphene/WTe$_2$ heterostructure
Authors: Przemyslaw Przybysz, Karma Tenzin, Berkay Kilic, Witold Kozlowski, Pawel J. Kowalczyk, Pawel Dabrowski, Jagoda Slawinska
Abstract: Crystal symmetries in solids give rise to spin-momentum locking, which determines how an electron's spin orientation depends on its momentum. This relationship, often referred to as spin texture, influences both charge-to-spin conversion and spin relaxation, making it one of the essential characteristics for spin-orbit-driven phenomena. Materials with strong spin-orbit coupling and broken inversion symmetry can host persistent spin textures (PSTs) - unidirectional spin configurations in momentum space, supporting efficient charge-to-spin conversion and extended spin lifetimes. Monolayer WTe$_2$, a topological material crystallizing in a rectangular lattice, is a notable example; its symmetry enforces a canted PST enabling quantum spin Hall effect with the nontrivial spin orientation. Here, we use first-principles calculations to explore how these properties are modified when WTe$_2$ is interfaced with graphene. We find that the PST is preserved by the local symmetry present in different regions of the heterostructure, while the system develops extended electron and hole pockets, resulting in semimetallic behavior. Although the band gap closes and eliminates the quantum spin Hall phase, spin Hall effects remain robust in both conventional and unconventional geometries. The computed spin Hall conductivities are comparable to those of other two-dimensional materials, and the survival of the PST suggests the possibility of long-range spin transport even in the absence of topological edge states. In addition, the graphene layer serves as an oxidation barrier, helping protect the intrinsic properties of WTe$_2$ and supporting the potential of this heterostructure for spintronic applications.

Title: Ultra-Efficient Reconstruction of Anisotropic Hyperuniform Continuous Random Fields in 2D and 3D via Generalized Spectral Filtering
Authors: Liyu Zhong, Sheng Mao
Abstract: Hyperuniform continuous random fields suppress large-scale fluctuations while preserving rich local disorder, making them highly attractive for next-generation photonic, thermal and mechanical materials. However, traditional reconstruction techniques often suffer from limited spectral control or excessive computational cost, especially in high-resolution 2D and 3D settings. In this work, we present an ultra-efficient generative algorithm based on generalized superellipse spectral filtering, which allows independent tuning of isotropic and anisotropic spectral envelopes without resorting to costly iterative schemes. We demonstrate our method on a comprehensive set of 2D and 3D examples, showing precise manipulation of spectral band shape and orders-of-magnitude speedup compared to existing approaches. Furthermore, we explore the effect of simple thresholding on the generated fields, analyzing the morphological features and power-spectrum characteristics of the resulting two-phase maps. Our results confirm that the proposed framework not only accelerates hyperuniform field synthesis but also provides a versatile platform for systematic study of binary microstructures derived from continuous designs. This work opens new avenues for large-scale simulation and optimized design of advanced hyperuniform materials.

Abstract: We report the first experimental observation of magnetic-field-induced quantized charge accumulation in a quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) system -- a phenomenon originating from the intrinsic two-dimensional surface state and fundamentally distinct from conventional edge-dependent transport phenomena. Our approach employs a novel out-of-plane capacitive detection method to directly probe this charge accumulation, revealing its distinction and correlation with other surface state properties, such as Laughlin charge pumping. We demonstrate that the accumulated charge density is governed by the quantized Hall conductance but is significantly influenced by dissipation effects due to finite longitudinal conductance. By performing frequency and longitudinal conductance dependence measurements, the underlying ideal quantized charge accumulation is extracted, in agreement with theoretical predictions. Importantly, our out-of-plane method of measuring charge accumulation allows the detection of small electric polarization in future studies, establishing a pathway toward the direct observation of the topological magnetoelectric effect, a manifestation of the four-dimensional quantum Hall effect.

Title: Quantum backreaction in an analogue black hole
Authors: G. Ciliberto, R. Balbinot, A. Fabbri, N. Pavloff
Abstract: We extend the Gross-Pitaevskii equation to incorporate the effect of quantum fluctuations onto the flow of a weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensate. Applying this framework to an analogue black hole in a quasi-one-dimensional, transonic flow, we investigate how acoustic Hawking radiation back-reacts on the background condensate. Our results point to the emergence of stationary density and velocity undulations in the supersonic region (analogous to the black hole interior) and enable to evaluate the change in upstream and downstream Mach numbers caused by Hawking radiation. These findings provide new insight into the interplay between quantum fluctuations and analogue gravity in Bose-Einstein condensates.

Title: Feynman paradox induced by vacuum and thermal fluctuations
Authors: Svend-Age Biehs, Ivan Latella
Abstract: A charged particle initially at rest in an external magnetic field starts to rotate when the magnetic field is switched off. This is a variant of the Feynman disc paradox, where the conservation of angular momentum is seemingly violated. The paradox is understood by realizing that angular momentum is initially stored in the electromagnetic field and is transferred to the particle when the magnetic field is removed. In a classical description, no rotation occurs if the particle is uncharged, as the initial angular momentum is zero in this case. We show that electromagnetic fluctuations in thermal equilibrium can induce a quantum analog of the Feynman paradox, where a nonreciprocal particle without charge starts to rotate when the source of nonreciprocity is removed. This paradox is due to persistent energy fluxes arising in nonreciprocal systems at equilibrium, leading to angular momentum stored in the electromagnetic field. We demonstrate that the contribution of vacuum fluctuations to persistent energy fluxes dominate over thermal fluctuations at finite temperature, so vacuum fluctuations dominate the equilibrium angular momentum as well. Observation of the induced motion would thus provide a means of detecting persistent energy fluxes and offer further evidence for the physical reality of vacuum fluctuations.

Title: Weakly superconducting anisotropy in 4Hb-Nb0.95Ti0.05Se2 with 1T/1H heterostructure
Authors: Fanyu Meng, Hechang Lei
Abstract: Heterostructures of layered transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) exhibit rich physical properties by the combination of strong electronic correlation effects in 1T layer and superconductivity in 1H layer. But the limited number of bulk TMD materials with such heterostructures impedes the in-depth understanding of the physical mechanisms behind these properties, as well as research on tuning of these properties. Here, we report a systematic study on physical properties of the 4Hb-Nb0.95Ti0.05Se2 single crystals with 1T/1H heterostructure. It exhibits a superconducting transition at temperature below 3.3 K. Further analysis indicates that 4Hb-Nb0.95Ti0.05Se2 is an intermediately coupled type-II superconductor. Moreover, 4Hb-Nb0.95Ti0.05Se2 shows a rather weak superconducting anisotropy (~ 2), distinctly different from other known TMD superconductors with 4Hb heterostructure.

Title: Finite-temperature transport in the gapped spin-1/2 XXZ chain and one-dimensional lattice spinless fermion model
Authors: J. M. P. Carmelo, P. D. Sacramento
Abstract: Here we consider a class of energy eigenstates of the spin-1/2 XXZ chain that exist both for anisotropies 1 and larger than 1. We show that at the isotropic point their contributions are behind the diffusion constant being infinite, spin transport being anomalous superdiffusive for temperatures T>0. That for anisotropy larger than 1 such states do not contribute to the diffusion constant is shown to imply it is finite, spin transport being normal diffusive for T>0. By combining the connection through a Jordan-Wigner transformation of the spin-1/2 XXZ chain to the one-dimensional (1D) lattice spinless fermion model at zero chemical potential for V/J larger or equal to 1 with its Bethe-ansatz solution, where V is the nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsion and J is twice the hopping integrai, in this paper we also address the issue of the T>0 charge transport of that model at zero chemical potential. It is found to be anomalous superdiffusive for V/J=1 and normal diffusive for V/J>1.

Title: Kitaev-derived Gapless Spin Liquid in the $K$-$J$-$Γ$-$Γ'$ Quantum Magnet Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$
Authors: Han Li, Xu-Guang Zhou, Gang Su, Wei Li
Abstract: The realization of quantum spin liquids (QSLs) in Kitaev magnets represents an intriguing topic in frustrated quantum magnetism. Despite prediction in the pure Kitaev honeycomb model, realization of QSLs in realistic systems and materials remain scarce. The recent discovery of cobalt-based compound Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ has raised significant research interest. By establishing a realistic $K$-$J$-$\Gamma$-$\Gamma'$ model for Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ -- with a dominant antiferromagnetic (AFM) Kitaev interaction ($K>0$) that quantitatively explains its thermodynamics measurements -- we reveal an intermediate gapless QSL phase under [111] magnetic fields with tensor-network calculations. We confirm the QSL nature of this phase by demonstrating its adiabatic connection to the intensively studied intermediate QSL of the pure AFM Kitaev model under out-of-plane fields. Our results show excellent agreement with recent high-field experiments, thereby explaining the intermediate-field phase in Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$. These findings bridge the gap between theoretical proposals for a Kitaev-derived QSL and experimental realization, opening new avenues for exploring exotic quantum states of matter in realistic Kitaev materials.

Title: Absence of two-orbital superconductivity in cuprate family: A DFT+DMFT perspective
Authors: Jian-Hong She, Jing-Xuan Wang, Rong-Qiang He, Zhong-Yi Lu
Abstract: The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has spurred intense interest in exploring analogous mechanisms in other transition metal oxides. This raises a pivotal question: can cuprates, as neighbors to nickelates in the periodic table, host similar two-orbital superconductivity? Here, we systematically investigate the electronic structure of a series of designed Ruddlesden-Popper cuprates. Our calculations reveal that the parent compound La$_3$Cu$_2$O$_7$ is a weakly correlated metal, and hole-doping fails to induce strong correlation. We find that the actual valence of the copper cations becomes strikingly pinned around +2.3, far away from the targeted $d^8$ configuration. This valence pinning is attributed to the inherent charge-transfer nature of cuprates. We propose this mechanism as a general principle explaining the robust single-orbital physics consistently observed in the cuprate family, holding true even in materials like the high-$T_c$ superconductor Ba$_2$CuO$_{3+\delta}$ that appear structurally primed for two-orbital activity. Our results therefore conclude that the route towards two-orbital superconductivity is fundamentally obstructed in cuprates, providing a crucial constraint for the future design of high-temperature superconductors.

Abstract: A novel concept of nano-scaled interwoven templates for drug delivery with alternating hydro- and lipophilicity properties is introduced. They are built from cellulose and peptide hydrogel in tandem, and characterized by a nano-stacked interwoven design, thus enabling for tuning the lipophilicity in the mesh nano-domains in which drug candidates of complementary lipophilicities can be embedded. This allows for low-dose-controlled consumption and therapeutic applications. Time-resolved and in-situ grazing incidence X-ray scattering studies confirm the design of the therapeutic nano-paper and create conditions suitable for the drug storage of complementary properties. The molecular design has the potential of a locally controlled, site-specific drug release on a beyond-nanomolar scale. Generalized, the design may contribute to facile developments of personalized medicine.

Title: Free Majorana Fermion Meets Gauged Ising Conformal Field Theory on the Fuzzy Sphere
Authors: Zheng Zhou, Davide Gaiotto, Yin-Chen He
Abstract: The fuzzy sphere regularisation is a powerful tool to study conformal field theories (CFT) in three spacetime dimensions. In this paper, we extend its scope to CFTs with local fermionic operators. We realise the free Majorana fermion CFT on a setup with one flavour of bosons and one flavour of fermions on the lowest Landau level with a $1/2$ angular momentum mismatch. We allow conversion between two bosons and two fermions, and use a relative chemical potential as the tuning parameter. On the phase diagram, we find three gapped phases, viz. a fermionic integer quantum Hall phase, an $f$-wave chiral topological superconductor, and a bosonic Pfaffian phase. They are separated by two continuous transitions described respectively by a free Majorana fermion and a gauged Ising CFT. We numerically confirm their emergent conformal symmetry through the operator spectrum. We also study the two-point correlation function of the Majorana fermion, and the topological Wilson line defect of the gauged Ising CFT. Our work represents a step towards studying interacting fermionic CFTs and regularising quantum field theories on the fuzzy sphere.

Title: Quantum complexity of topological phases. Or lack thereof
Authors: Alberto Giuseppe Catalano, Sven Benjamin Kožić, Gianpaolo Torre, Carola Ciaramelletti, Simone Paganelli, Fabio Franchini, Salvatore Marco Giampaolo
Abstract: Topological phases are expected to carry enhanced computational power, stemming from the long-range entanglement that characterizes them. Here we investigate whether this advantage is reflected in quantum magic, quantified through stabilizer Rényi entropies (SREs). We analyze one-dimensional models with an exact duality between a symmetry-protected topological phase and a trivial one. Surprisingly, a finite (parameters dependent) asymmetry appears only when boundary conditions break the duality, and emerges as well in the transverse-field Ising chain, which lacks topological order. These results show that magic is unable to detect topological phases, indicating that either an additional resource is required to capture their unique quantum contribution, or that not all forms of long-range entanglement constitute a genuine computational resource.

Title: Free Cumulants and Full Eigenstate Thermalization from Boundary Scrambling
Authors: Felix Fritzsch, Gabriel O. Alves, Michael A. Rampp, Pieter W. Claeys
Abstract: Out-of-time-order correlation functions (OTOCs) and their higher-order generalizations present important probes of quantum information dynamics and scrambling. We introduce a solvable many-body quantum model, which we term boundary scrambling, for which the full dynamics of higher-order OTOCs is analytically tractable. These dynamics support a decomposition into free cumulants and unify recent extensions of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis with predictions from random quantum circuit models. We obtain exact expressions for (higher-order) correlations between matrix elements and show these to be stable away from the solvable point. The solvability is enabled by the identification of a higher-order Markovian influence matrix, capturing the effect of the full system on a local subsystem. These results provide insight into the emergence of random-matrix behavior from structured Floquet dynamics and show how techniques from free probability can be applied in the construction of exactly-solvable many-body models.

Title: DDNet: A Unified Physics-Informed Deep Learning Framework for Semiconductor Device Modeling
Authors: Roberto Riganti, Matteo G. C. Alasio, Enrico Bellotti, Luca Dal Negro
Abstract: The accurate modeling of semiconductor devices plays a critical role in the development of new technology nodes and next-generation devices. Semiconductor device designers largely rely on advanced simulation software to solve the drift-diffusion equations, a coupled system of nonlinear partial differential equations that describe carrier transport in semiconductor devices. While these tools perform well for forward modeling, they are not suitable to address inverse problems, for example, determining doping profiles, material, and geometrical parameters given a desired device performance. Meanwhile, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have grown in popularity in recent years thanks to their ability to efficiently and accurately solve inverse problems at minimal computational cost compared to forward problems. In this study, we introduce the Drift-Diffusion Network (DDNet), a unified physics-informed deep learning solver for the forward and inverse mesh-free solutions of the drift-diffusion equations of semiconductor device modeling. Using prototypical device configurations in one- and two spatial dimensions, we show that DDNet achieves low absolute and relative error compared to traditional simulation software while additionally solving user-defined inverse problems with minimal computational overhead. We expect that DDNet will benefit semiconductor device modeling by facilitating exploration and discovery of novel device structures across comprehensive parameter sets in a fully automated way.

Title: Electronic Fluctuations and Ionic Dynamics in Molten Silver Iodide
Authors: Harender S. Dhattarwal, Richard C. Remsing
Abstract: Molten salts are high-temperature ionic liquids whose unique combination of strong Coulombic interactions, large polarizabilities, and high ionic conductivities makes them central to energy storage, metallurgy, and nuclear technology. Understanding their delicate balance of Coulomb forces, short-range repulsion, and electronic polarization, particularly regarding the role that electronic fluctuations play in their structure and dynamics, is critical to predictively designing molten salts for applications of interest. We investigate the importance of electronic fluctuations in molten AgI using density functional theory, a universal machine learning model (Orb), and a classical, empirical pairwise model of interionic interactions. We find that directional polarization fluctuations of iodide ions enhance Ag+ diffusion, manifesting as enhanced force fluctuations and structure in the time-dependent friction experienced by the cations. The coupling between iodide polarization fluctuations and silver diffusion creates a dynamic asymmetry; Ag+ motion is tightly linked to the instantaneous polarization of neighboring I-, whereas I- dynamics are relatively unperturbed by electronic fluctuations. For all structural and dynamic quantities investigated, the Orb model is in excellent agreement with density functional theory-based simulations, highlighting the ability of this universal neural network potential to capture many-body polarization effects. In contrast, the empirical force field fails to reproduce key structural and dynamic quantities involving cations, ultimately because it neglects dynamic electronic fluctuations. Our findings connect liquid=state ionic dynamics with the "electronic paddle-wheel" mechanism of ionic diffusion in superionic solids and motivate further exploration of polarization fluctuation effects in complex electrolytes and ionic liquids.

Title: Disordered Charged Horizons
Authors: Daniel Arean, Sebastian Grieninger, Pau G. Romeu
Abstract: We construct fully backreacted charged black brane solutions with a spatially disordered chemical potential in asymptotically AdS$_3$ and AdS$_4$, providing holographic duals of strongly coupled disordered systems. At intermediate temperatures these geometries display highly inhomogeneous horizons, though their geometric averages reproduce the clean BTZ and Reissner-Nordström solutions. The low temperature behavior, however, differs sharply between dimensions. In AdS$_3$, inhomogeneities decay and the horizon flows to the clean charged BTZ fixed point, rendering disorder irrelevant in the infrared. In AdS$_4$, horizon inhomogeneities persist: while the averaged geometry flows to the clean AdS$_2\times \mathbb{R}^2$ throat, the disordered horizon induces a finite residual resistivity. These results show that disorder can qualitatively alter the IR physics of holographic metals and indicate violations of the Harris criterion in strongly coupled systems.

Title: Comparing Machine Learning and Physics-Based Nanoparticle Geometry Determinations Using Far-Field Spectral Properties
Authors: Mengqi Sun, Zixu Huang, Muammer Y. Yaman, Maxim Ziatdinov, Sergei V. Kalinin, David S. Ginger
Abstract: Anisotropic metal nanostructures exhibit polarization-dependent light scattering. This property has been widely exploited to determine geometries of subwavelength structures using far-field microscopy. Here, we explore the use of variational autoencoders (VAEs) to determine the geometries of gold nanorods (NRs) such as in-plane orientation and aspect ratio under linearly polarized dark-field illumination in an optical microscope. We input polarized dark-field scattering spectra and electron microscopy images into a dual-branch multimodal VAE with a single shared latent space trained on paired spectra-image data, using a learnable linear adapter. We achieve prediction of Au NRs using only polarized dark-field scattering spectra input. We determine geometrical parameters of orientational angle and aspect ratio quantitatively via both dual-VAE and physics-based analysis. We show that orientational angle prediction by dual-VAE performs well with only a small (300 particle) training set, yielding a mean absolute error (MAE) of 14.4 and a concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) of 0.95. This performance is only marginally worse than the physics-based cos(2theta) fitting approach between the scattering intensity and the polarizing angle, which achieves MAE of 8.78 and CCC of 0.99. Aspect ratio determination is also similar for the dual-VAE and physics-based fitting comparison (MAE of 0.21 vs. 0.23 and CCC of 0.53 vs. 0.68). By learning a shared latent manifold linking spectra and morphology, the model can generate NR images with accurate orientation and aspect ratio with spectra-only input in the small-data regime (300 particles), suggesting a general recipe for inverse nano-optical problems requiring both structure and orientation information.

Title: Cepstral Strain Mapping for Small Pixel-Count Detectors
Authors: Harikrishnan KP, Dasol Yoon, Yu-Tsun Shao, Zhaslan Baraissov, Luigi Mele, Christoph Mitterbauer, Erik Kieft, Stefano Vespucci, David A. Muller
Abstract: With the decreasing sizes of integrated-circuit components, the semiconductor industry is in growing need of high-throughput strain mapping techniques that offer high precision and spatial resolution, with desired industry goals of 0.01-0.1% and 1 nm respectively. As the fundamental limitation on the measurement precision is set by the Poisson noise, pixel array detectors with high saturation current, high dynamic range and fast readout are ideally suited for this purpose. However, due to the limited pixel count on these detectors, they do not work well with traditional strain mapping algorithms that were optimized to work on datasets with a large pixel count. Here, we evaluate the cepstral transform that was designed to address this problem, with the precision determined by the convergence, collection angles and dose while remaining insensitive to the pixel count. We test the performance of our method on silicon wedges and Si-SiGe multilayers, and using datasets collected at different conditions, we show how the measured strain precision scales as a function of dose, aperture size and sample thickness. Using precession gives a further improvement in precision by about 1.5-2x, whereas energy filtering does not have a significant impact on the cepstral method for device-relevant sample thickness ranges.

Title: How Does Incubation Affect Laser Material Processing?
Authors: Matthias Lenzner, Jörn Bonse
Abstract: In the last decades, the subject of laser-induced damage (LID) moved from a topic of scientific interest toward laser material processing for technical applications. When using pulsed lasers, the cumulative effect known as incubation is one of the most fundamental features of the processing event. Incubation manifests by the fact that the critical fluence for LID (known as laser-induced damage threshold, LIDT) depends on the number of pulses N exciting one spot on the sample. In most cases, the threshold fluence decreases with N starting from the single-shot ablation threshold and remains constant for large N. No ablation or damage occurs for any N, if the fluence is kept below the multiple-pulse threshold. In contrast, examples where the LIDT increases with N have been reported. The latter effect is known as laser conditioning and is advantageously used when ramping up the power of high-power laser systems. Incubation has been described for many types of solids; the motivation for these comprehensive efforts is twofold. Firstly, one tries to prevent the damage of optical materials in the beam path of high-energy or high-peak-power lasers. Secondly, one deliberately uses this damage for the sculpting of components. In this chapter, we introduce the reader to the mechanisms of incubation. We are going to look at the parameters controlling LID and highlight the peculiarity of the parameter "number of pulses". We will give an overview of the experimental work done in a variety of materials. There are several physical and chemical mechanisms proposed that govern incubation, and there are several mathematical models to describe the behavior of threshold fluence and ablation rate in dependence on the number of pulses. In a few cases, the two classes of mechanisms are even related to each other. Eventually, we will show the implications that incubation has on real-world laser machining.

Title: System size and boundaries determine the patterning dynamics of attracting active particles
Authors: Jan Rombouts, Michael L Zhao, Alexander Aulehla, Anna Erzberger
Abstract: Pattern formation often occurs in confined systems, yet how boundaries shape patterning dynamics is unclear. We develop techniques to analyze confinement effects in nonlocal advection-diffusion equations, which generically capture the collective dynamics of active self-attracting particles. We identify a sequence of size-controlled transitions that generate characteristic slow modes, leading to exponential increase of patterning timescales. Experimental measurements of multicellular dynamics confirm our predictions.

Title: Spectral Transitions of the Entanglement Hamiltonian in Monitored Free Fermions
Authors: Karim Chahine, Michael Buchhold
Abstract: We numerically investigate measurement-induced phase transitions in monitored free fermions through the spectral and eigenstate properties of the entanglement Hamiltonian. By analyzing entanglement scaling, we identify three non-trivial fixed points, for which the entanglement follows exact analytical scaling forms: chaotic unitary dynamics at infinitesimal monitoring, characterized by a Gaussian Page law; a Fermi-liquid fixed point at moderate monitoring, defining a metallic phase with logarithmic entanglement growth and emergent space-time invariance; and a quantum Lifshitz fixed point marking the measurement-induced phase transition into a localized area-law phase. Adopting a random-matrix perspective on the entanglement Hamiltonian, we show that short-range spectral correlations, such as the adjacent gap ratio $\langle \tilde r\rangle$ and the Kullback-Leibler divergence $KL_1$, sharply detect an ergodic to non-ergodic phase transition at the quantum Lifshitz fixed point, and yield precise estimates of the critical point and correlation length exponent. Long-range probes, including the spectral form factor and the associated Thouless time, corroborate this picture, while the variant $KL_2$ uncovers signatures of a possible non-ergodic extended (multifractal) regime at intermediate monitoring strengths. Together, these results establish the entanglement Hamiltonian as a powerful framework for diagnosing metallic, localized, and multifractal regimes in monitored quantum dynamics, and highlight unexpected scaling structures, Fermi-liquid and Lifshitz criticality, that lie beyond current field-theoretic approaches.

Title: Cat states in one- and two-mode $\mathbb{Z}_3$ Rabi models
Authors: Anatoliy I. Lotkov, Denis V. Kurlov, Valerii K. Kozin, Jelena Klinovaja, Daniel Loss
Abstract: We investigate one- and two-mode variants of the $\mathbb{Z}_3$-symmetric quantum Rabi model, which describe the interaction of a qutrit with one or two bosonic modes and are directly relevant for circuit-QED and spin-qudit platforms. We find a canonical transformation that allows one to obtain the spectrum of the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ Rabi model using perturbation theory in a magnetic field. We show that in a certain parameter regime (deep-strong-coupling and a small magnetic field) the three lowest eigenstates become $\mathbb{Z}_3$ qutrit-boson cat states. In order to characterize these states we introduce a joint qutrit-boson Wigner function and derive its closed-form expression for the qutrit-boson cat states. Numerical calculations across a wide range of coupling strengths show that the proposed Wigner function is a useful tool that allows one to unambiguously identify the $\mathbb{Z}_{3}$ qutrit-boson cat states.

Title: A Unified Symmetry-Constrained Framework for Band Inversions in Photonic Crystals with $C_n$ Symmetry
Authors: Ze Tao, Fujun Liu
Abstract: The lack of a unified theoretical framework for characterizing band inversions across different crystal symmetries hinders the rapid development of topological photonic band engineering. To address this issue, we have constructed a framework constrained by symmetry $k \cdot p$ that universally models bands near high-symmetry points for symmetric photonic crystals $C_6$, $C_4$, $C_3$, and $C_2$. This framework enables a coefficient-free quantitative diagnosis of band topology. We have demonstrated the power of this framework by systematically engineering band inversions. In $C_6$ crystals, we induce a reopening of the linear gap at $\Gamma$. In $C_4$ systems, mirror symmetry enforces a characteristic quadratic coupling leading to distinct spectral features. Our analysis further reveals that a lone $E$ doublet prevents inversion at the $\Gamma$ point in $C_3$ symmetry, while $C_2$ symmetry facilitates a unique inversion of $Y$ pointsints with anisotropic gap. This symmetry-first, fit-free approach establishes a direct link between experimental band maps and the extraction of fundamental topological parameters. It offers a universal tool for inversion and coupling-order identification.

Title: Far-field axisymmetric solution of the Brinkman equation for a point force near a no-slip wall
Authors: Abdallah Daddi-Moussa-Ider, Andrej Vilfan
Abstract: We derive the far-field solution for the Green's function of a point force acting perpendicular to a no-slip wall in a Brinkman fluid, focusing on the regime where the distance between the force and the wall is much smaller than the screening length. The general solution is obtained in closed form up to a single integral and can be systematically expanded in a Taylor series in both the far-field and near-field limits. The flow can then be expressed as a series of source-multipole singularities with an additional, analytically known, correction in the proximity of the wall. Comparisons with numerical integration demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of the asymptotic expansions. The results are also applicable to the unsteady Stokes flow driven by a localized assembly of forces, such as a beating cilium protruding from a flat surface.

Title: Interplay of strong correlations and covalency in ionic band insulators
Authors: Nagamalleswararao Dasari, Sujan K. K., Juana Moreno, N. S. Vidhyadhiraja
Abstract: We address the role of electronic correlations in different kinds of band insulators by using the two-orbital Hubbard model within the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). An intriguing finding is that electronic correlations turn a metal into a band insulator when ionicity and covalency are equal in this http URL conclude that the electronic correlations favour metallicity when the covalency is smaller than the ionicity, while they favour insulating behaviour when the covalency is greater than ionicity.

Title: Stable non-Fermi liquid fixed point at the onset of incommensurate $2k_F$ charge density wave order
Authors: Ipsita Mandal
Abstract: We consider the emergence of a non-Fermi liquid fixed point in a two-dimensional metal, at the onset of a quantum phase transition from a Fermi liquid state to an incommensurate charge density wave (CDW) ordered phase. The momentum of the CDW boson is centred at the wavevector $ \boldsymbol{ \mathcal Q} $, which connects a single pair of antipodal points on the Fermi surface with antiparallel tangent vectors. We employ the dimensional regularization technique in which the co-dimension of the Fermi surface is extended to a generic value, while keeping the dimension of the Fermi surface itself fixed at one. Although the system is strongly coupled at dimension $d=2$, the interactions become marginal at the upper critical dimension $d=d_c$, whose value is found to be $ 5/2$. Using a controlled perturbative expansion in the parameter $\epsilon = d_c - d $, we compute the critical exponents of the stable infrared fixed point characterizing the quantum critical point. The scalings of the original theory are determined by setting $\epsilon =1/2$, where the fermion self-energy is seen to scale with the frequency with a fractional power law of $2/3$, which is the telltale signature of a typical non-Fermi liquid phase.

Title: Patterns of active dipolar particles in external magnetic fields
Authors: Vitali Telezki, Stefan Klumpp
Abstract: Active particles with a (magnetic) dipole moment are of interest for steering self-propelled motion, but also result in novel collective effects due to their dipole-dipole interaction. Here systems of active dipolar particles are studied with Brownian dynamics simulations to systematically characterize the different patterns they form, specifically in the presence of an external (magnetic) field. The combination of three types of order - clustering, orientational alignment and chain formation - is used to classify the patterns observed in these systems. In the presence of an external field, oriented chains and bands are found to be dominant. These structures show some similarities with columnar cluster seen in (passive) ferrofluids and display columnar spacing and number of lanes per cluster that both decrease with increasing field strength.

Title: Possible Sliding Regimes in Twisted Bilayer WTe$_2$
Authors: Yi-Ming Wu, Chaitanya Murthy, Steven A. Kivelson
Abstract: Inspired by the observation of increasingly one-dimensional (1D) behavior with decreasing temperature in small-angle twisted bilayers of WTe$_2$ (tWTe$_2$), we theoretically explore the exotic sliding regimes that could be realized in tWTe$_2$. At zero displacement field, while hole-doped tWTe$_2$ can be thought of as an array of weakly coupled conventional two-flavor 1D electron gases (1DEGs), the electron-doped regime is equivalent to coupled four-flavor 1DEGs , due to the presence of an additional "valley'' degree of freedom. In the decoupled limit, the electron-doped system can thus realize phases with a range of interesting ordering tendencies, including $4k_F$ charge-density-wave and charge-$4e$ superconductivity. Dimensional crossovers and cross-wire transport due to inter-wire couplings of various kinds are also discussed. We find that a sliding Luther-Emery liquid with small inter-wire couplings is probably most consistent with current experiments on hole-doped tWTe$_2$.

Title: Strange metal at the Lifshitz transition
Authors: Yi-Hui Xing, Wu-Ming Liu, Xiao-Tian Zhang
Abstract: Strange metals are ubiquitously observed in a variety of strongly correlated materials, among which high temperature cuprates\cite{Greene2020} and twisted bilayer graphenes\cite{Cao2020} are the most prominent examples. The prevailing consensus is that the strange metal emerges within a finite temperature fan, mediated by a quantum critical point(QCP) where the pseudogap phase terminates\cite{keimer2015quantum,Michon2019}. A growing number of experiments\cite{Benhabib2015,DoironLeyraud2017,Horio2018} suggests that, in most cuprates, the QCP nearly coincides with a Lifshitz transition point. However, the nature of the QCP\cite{Zhu2022} and the significance of van Hove singularity(VHS) in driving quantum critical phenomena remain largely unexplored\cite{Horio2018,Shen2022}. Here we investigate quantum critical transport at Lifshitz transition in two dimensions(2D), where the Fermi surface geometry undergoes a convex-to-concave transition. The VHS saddle points is coupled to critical bosons via spatially uniform Yukawa interactions. At zero temperature, the interplay between extra scattering channel at Lifshitz transition and the impurity scattering gives rise to a linear-in-$\omega$ optical conductivity. At finite temperatures, we demonstrate a persistant linear-in-$T$ \emph{dc} resistivity in the quantum-critical temperature range down to $T\rightarrow 0$, which gives in to the saturation in non-universal higher temperature regime. For the spatially random Yukawa interaction, we show that the linear-in-$T$ resistivity unexpectedly extends even into the non-universal high-$T$ regime.

Title: Emergent dipole field theory in atomic ladders
Authors: Hernan B. Xavier, Poetri Sonya Tarabunga, Marcello Dalmonte, Rodrigo G. Pereira
Abstract: We study the dynamics of hard-core bosons on ladders, in the presence of strong kinetic constrains akin to those of the Bariev model. We use a combination of analytical methods and numerical simulations to establish the phase diagram of the model. The model displays a paired Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid phase featuring an emergent dipole symmetry, which encodes the local pairing constraint into a global, nonlocal quantity. We scrutinize the effect of such emergent low-energy symmetry during quench dynamics including single-particle defects. We observe that, despite being approximate, the dipole symmetry still leads to very slow relaxation dynamics, which we model via an effective field theory. The model we discuss is amenable to realization in both cold atoms in optical lattices and Rydberg atom arrays with dynamics taking place solely in the Rydberg manifold. To observe the unusual dynamics of excitations in such experimental platforms, we propose a two-step protocol, which starts with the quasi-adiabatic preparation of low-energy states, followed by the local creation of defects and their study under quench dynamics.

Title: Ge-based Clinopyroxene series: first principles and experimental local probe study

Abstract: The structural and electronic properties of the CaMnGe$_2$O$_6$ and SrMnGe$_2$O$_6$ clinopyroxene systems have been investigated by means of perturbed angular correlation (PAC) measurements, performed at ISOLDE, combined with $ab-initio$ electronic structure calculations within the density functional theory (DFT) framework. The partial density of states (PDOS) of the CaMnGe$_2$O$_6$ and SrMnGe$_2$O$_6$ stable compounds has been determined, and it has been observed that the requirement of including an on-site Hubbard-$U$ potential was necessary in order to describe the highly correlated Mn $3d$-states. By considering $U_{eff}$=4 eV, we obtained a band gap width of 1.82 eV and 1.70 eV, for the CaMnGe$_2$O$_6$ and SrMnGe$_2$O$_6$, respectively. Combining electric field gradient (EFG) first principles calculations, using a supercell scheme, with experimental PAC results, we were able to infer that the Cd probe can replace either the $A$ (Ca, Sr) or the Mn sites in the crystalline structures. We also showed that Cd substitution is expected to lead to a reduction in the width of the band gap in these systems, evidencing opportunities for potential band-gap engineering.

Title: SR-CLD: Spatially Resolved Chord Length Distributions for Statistical Description and Visualization of Non-uniform Microstructures
Authors: Sheila E. Whitman, Marat I. Latypov
Abstract: This study introduces the calculation of spatially-resolved chord length distribution (SR-CLD) as an efficient approach for quantifying and visualizing non-uniform microstructures in heterogeneous materials. SR-CLD enables detailed analysis of spatial variation of microstructures in different directions that can be overlooked with traditional descriptions. We present the calculation of SR-CLD using efficient scan-line algorithm that counts pixels in constituents along pixel rows or columns of microstructure images for detailed, high-resolution SR-CLD maps. We demonstrate the application of SR-CLD in three case studies: on synthetic polycrystalline microstructures with known and intentionally created uniform and gradient spatial distributions of grain size; on non-uniform microstructures from welding simulations; and on experimental images of two-phase microstructures of additively manufactured Ti alloys with significant spatially non-uniform distributions of laths of one of the phases.

Title: Anomalous-Hall Neel textures in altermagnetic materials
Authors: Rui-Chun Xiao, Hui Li, Hui Han, Wei Gan, Mengmeng Yang, Ding-Fu Shao, Shu-Hui Zhang, Yang Gao, Mingliang Tian, Jianhui Zhou
Abstract: Recently, the altermagnets, a new kind of collinear antiferromagnet with nearly zero net magnetization and momentum-dependent spin-splitting of bands, have sparked great interest. Despite simple magnetic structures, these altermagnets exhibit intriguing and intricate dependence of anomalous Hall effect (AHE) on the Néel vector, in contrast to the conventional perpendicular configuration of Hall current with magnetization in ferromagnets. However, the fundamental relationship between the AHE and the Néel vector remains largely elusive. Here, we reveal all the unconventional anomalous Hall textures in the Néel vector space, dubbed anomalous-Hall Néel textures (AHNTs) for altermagnets. Specifically, we identify 10 types across four categories of AHNTs for all altermagnets. Notably, we find that AHNTs resemble the known spin textures in momentum space, and further reveal their symmetry origin. Meanwhile, we examine our key discoveries in prototypical altermagnets. Our work offers a thorough understanding of AHE in altermagnets and a complete and pictorial classification of altermagnets based on the geometry of response functions.

Title: Rational Control of Magnonic and Electronic Band Splittings
Authors: Subhadeep Bandyopadhyay, Anoop Raj, Philippe Ghosez, Sumiran Pujari, Sayantika Bhowal
Abstract: We provide a theoretical demonstration of controllable non-relativistic spin splitting in both electronic and magnonic bands via targeted structural distortions tied to specific phonon modes. Using MnF$_2$ as a model system, we identify a $d$-wave magnon band splitting between magnon modes of specific handedness, directly correlated with the non-relativistic spin splitting observed in the electronic structure. Crucially, we show that structural distortions associated with the A$_{2u}$ and A$_{1g}$ phonon modes (8.52 and 9.74 THz) modulate these splittings without altering the antiferromagnetic order. The effect originates from changes in the nonmagnetic ligand environment, highlighting the key role of lattice degrees of freedom in governing spin dynamics. Our findings establish a novel route for structure-mediated control of spin splitting, opening possibilities for tunable magnonic and spintronic functionalities in antiferromagnetic materials.

Title: C-R-T Fractionalization in the First Quantized Hamiltonian Theory
Authors: Yang-Yang Li, Zheyan Wan, Juven Wang, Shing-Tung Yau, Yi-Zhuang You
Abstract: Recent research has revealed that the CRT symmetry for fermions exhibits a fractionalization distinct from the $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\mathcal{C}}\times\mathbb{Z}_2^{\mathcal{R}}\times\mathbb{Z}_2^{\mathcal{T}}$ for scalar bosons. In fact, the CRT symmetry for fermions can be extended by internal symmetries such as fermion parity, thereby forming a group extension of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ direct product. Conventionally, a Majorana fermion is defined by one Dirac fermion with trivial charge conjugation. However, when the spacetime dimension $d+1=5,6,7\bmod8$, the real dimension of Majorana fermion (dim$_{\mathbb{R}}\chi_{\mathcal{C}\ell(d,0)}$) aligns with the real dimension of Dirac fermion (dim$_{\mathbb{R}}\psi_{\mathcal{C}\ell(d)}$), rather than being half, which necessitates the introduction of a symplectic Majorana fermion, defined by two Dirac fermions with trivial charge conjugation. To include these two types of Majorana fermions, we embed the theory in $n_{\mathbb{R}}$ and define the Majorana fermion field as a representation of the real Clifford algebra with 8-fold periodicity. Within the Hamiltonian formalism, we identify the 8-fold CRT-internal symmetry groups across general dimensions. Similarly, Dirac fermion field is defined as a representation of the complex Clifford algebra with 2-fold periodicity. Interestingly, we discover that the CRT-internal symmetry groups exhibit an 8-fold periodicity that is distinct from that of the complex Clifford algebra. In certain dimensions where distinct mass terms can span a mass manifold, the CRT-internal symmetries can act non-trivially upon this mass manifold. Employing domain wall reduction method, we are able to elucidate the relationships between symmetries across different dimensions.

Title: Relativistic Lévy processes
Authors: Lucas G. B. de Souza, M. G. E. da Luz, E. P. Raposo, Evaldo M. F. Curado, G. M. Viswanathan
Abstract: We study sums of independent and identically distributed random velocities in special relativity. We show that the resulting one-dimensional velocity distributions are not only stable under relativistic velocity addition but define a genuinely new class of stochastic processes--relativistic Lévy processes. Given a system, this allows identifying distinct relativistic regimes in terms of the distribution's concavity at the origin and the probability of measuring relativistic velocities. These features provide a protocol to assess the relevance of stochastic relativistic effects in actual experiments. As supporting evidence, we find agreement with previous results about heavy-ion diffusion and show that our findings are consistent with the distribution of momentum deviations observed in measurements of antiproton cooling.

Title: Quantum Many-Body Lattice C-R-T Symmetry: Fractionalization, Anomaly, and Symmetric Mass Generation
Authors: Yang-Yang Li, Juven Wang, Yi-Zhuang You
Abstract: Charge conjugation (C), mirror reflection (R), and time reversal (T) symmetries, along with internal symmetries, are essential for massless Majorana and Dirac fermions. These symmetries are sufficient to rule out potential fermion bilinear mass terms, thereby establishing a gapless free fermion fixed point phase, pivotal for symmetric mass generation (SMG) transition. In this work, we systematically study the anomaly of C-R-T-internal symmetry in all spacetime dimensions by analyzing the projective representation (i.e. the fractionalization) of the C-R-T-internal symmetry group in the quantum many-body Hilbert space on the lattice. By discovering the fermion-flavor-number-dependent C-R-T-internal symmetry's anomaly structure, we demonstrate an alternative way to derive the minimal flavor number for SMG, which shows consistency with known results from Kähler-Dirac fermion or cobordism classification. Our findings reveal that, in general spatial dimensions, either 8 copies of staggered Majorana fermions or 4 copies of staggered Dirac fermions admit SMG. By directly searching for 4-fermion interactions that form commuting stabilizers respecting all symmetry constraints, we can prove the explicit SMG gapping retained a unique ground state in the codespace. Furthermore, we establish the correspondence between the symmetry operators of staggered fermions and free fermions, which is instrumental in facilitating the analysis of symmetry fractionalization at the field theory level.

Title: Symmetric tensor scars with tunable entanglement from volume to area law
Authors: Bhaskar Mukherjee, Christopher J. Turner, Marcin Szyniszewski, Arijeet Pal
Abstract: Teleportation of quantum information over long distances requires robust entanglement on the macroscopic scale. The construction of highly energetic eigenstates with tunable long-range entanglement can provide a new medium for information transmission. Using a symmetric superposition of the antipodal triplet states, we construct polynomially many exact zero-energy eigenstates for a class of non-integrable spin-1/2 Hamiltonians with two-body interactions. These states exhibit non-thermal correlations, hence, are genuine quantum many-body scars. By tuning the distribution of triplets we induce extensive, logarithmic, or area-law entanglement, and can observe a second-order entanglement phase transition. Quasiparticle excitations in this manifold converge to be exact quantum many-body scars in the thermodynamic limit. This framework has a natural extension to higher dimensions, where entangled states controlled by lattice geometry and internal symmetries can result in new classes of correlated out-of-equilibrium quantum matter. Our results provide a new avenue for entanglement control and quantum state constructions.

Title: Anderson transition symmetries at the band-edge of a correlated Sn/Si monolayer
Authors: Mathieu Lizée, Mohammadmehdi Torkzadeh, François Debontridder, Marie Hervé, Christophe Brun, Igor Burmistrov, Tristan Cren
Abstract: The interplay between Anderson localization and Coulomb repulsion reveals deep connections to superconductivity and many-body localization in quantum systems. In this study, we investigate a tin monolayer on silicon, a material known for its likely antiferromagnetic Mott-correlated ground-state. From the spatial correlations of local density of states (LDOS) maps measured by scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we precisely identify the mobility edge between extended and localized states at the valence band-edge. Using theoretical analysis to explain the energy-dependent LDOS fluctuations, we estimate the system's conductivity change across this effective metal-insulator transition. Then, we compute the multifractal spectra of iso-energy LDOS maps and show that they follow an exact symmetry relation based on the algebraic structure of nonlinear sigma-models (NL$\sigma$Ms) - the field theory of mesoscopic electronic systems. This observation suggests that NL$\sigma$Ms are valid even in a strongly correlated 2D system, down to conductivity levels as low as g ~ 0.1. We anticipate that the relation may be different in the chiral-superconducting phase reported for p-doped Sn/Si monolayer. Finally, we point out that multifractal analysis could equally be applied to universal conductance fluctuations in magneto-transport experiments.

Title: Single-band square lattice Hubbard model from twisted bilayer C568
Authors: Toshikaze Kariyado, Ashvin Vishwanath, Zhu-Xi Luo
Abstract: We propose twisted homobilayer of a carbon allotrope, C$_{568}$, to be a promising platform to realize controllable square lattice single-band extended Hubbard model. This setup has the advantage of a widely tunable $t'/t$ ratio without adding external fields, and the intermediate temperature $t\ll T\ll U$ regime can be easily achieved. We first analyze the continuum model obtained from symmetry analysis and first-principle calculations, and calculate the band structures. Subsequently, we derive the corresponding tight-binding models and fit the hopping parameters as well as the Coulomb interactions. When displacement field is applied, anisotropic nearest neighbor hoppings can further be achieved. If successfully fabricated, the device could be an important stepping stone towards understanding high-temperature superconductivity.

Title: Spontaneous magnon decay in two-dimensional altermagnets
Authors: Niklas Cichutek, Peter Kopietz, Andreas Rückriegel
Abstract: We show that magnons in two-dimensional altermagnets can spontaneously decay at zero temperature. The decay rate is determined by quantum fluctuations and scattering processes involving the decay of a single magnon into three. These processes are kinematically allowed due to the convexity of the altermagnetic magnon dispersion. For small wavevectors $k$ the decay rate is proportional to $k^5$ with a direction-dependent prefactor which is maximal along the diagonals of the Brillouin zone. Moreover, for a given momentum only magnons with one specific chirality can spontaneously decay.

Title: Efficient plane-wave approach to generalized Kohn-Sham density-functional theory of solids with mixed deterministic/stochastic exchange
Authors: Tucker Allen, Barry Y. Li, Tim Duong, Kajsa Williams, Daniel Neuhauser
Abstract: An efficient mixed deterministic/sparse-stochastic plane-wave approach is developed for bandstructure calculations of large supercell periodic generalized-Kohn-Sham density functional theory, for any hybrid-exchange density functional. The method works for very large elementary cells and supercells, and we benchmark it on covalently bonded solids and molecular crystals with nonbonded interactions, for supercells of up to 33,000 atoms. Memory and CPU requirements scale with supercell size quasi-linearly.

Title: Yang-Lee Zeros of 2D Nearest-Neighbor Antiferromagnetic Ising Models: A Numerical Linked Cluster Expansion Study
Authors: Mahmoud Abdelshafy, Muhammad Sedik
Abstract: We study Yang-Lee zeros in the thermodynamic limit of the 2D nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic Ising model on square and triangular lattices. We employ the Numerical Linked Cluster Expansion (NLCE) equipped with Exact Enumeration (EE) of the partition function to estimate the Laplacian of the free energy, which is proportional to the zeros density. Using a modified NLCE, where the expansion can be carried directly on the Yang-Lee zeros of the involved clusters, we estimate the density of Yang-Lee zeros in the thermodynamic limit. NLCE gives significantly more zeros than EE in the complex field plane providing more insights on how the root curves look in the thermodynamic limit. For the square lattice at $T \ll T_c$, the results suggest that two vertical lines at $\pm h_c(T)$ in the complex field plane (i.e two concentric circles in the complex fugacity plane) are the thermodynamic root curves. A similar picture is expected for the triangular lattice for phase transitions at large values of magnetic field while further study is needed for phase transitions at smaller values of magnetic field. The convergence of the NLCE and (EE) calculations of the partition function to the thermodynamic limit is studied in both lattices and the temperature-field phase diagram is obtained from Yang-Lee zeros using both methods. This NLCE-based approach will facilitate the study of different types of phase transitions using Yang-Lee zeros in future research.

Title: Signatures of exceptional points in multiterminal superconductor-normal metal junctions
Authors: Oliver Solow, Karsten Flensberg
Abstract: We study a non-Hermitian, multiterminal superconducting-normal system in order to identify experimental signatures of exceptional points. We focus on a minimal setting with a single spinful level, spin-dependent normal leads, and a noncollinear magnetic field. This system hosts both topologically-protected, as well as symmetry-protected exceptional points. Using an exact transport formalism, we show that the exceptional points leave signatures visible through spectroscopy of the Andreev states, but that they have a minor effect on the Josephson current. We also argue that these findings hold with interactions.

Title: Antiferromagnetism and spin excitations in a two-dimensional non-Hermitian Hatano-Nelson flux model
Authors: Eduard Naichuk, Ilya M. Eremin, Jeroen van den Brink, Flavio S. Nogueira
Abstract: The one-dimensional Hatano-Nelson model with non-reciprocal hoppings is a prominent example of a relatively simple non-Hermitian quantum-mechanical system, which allows to study various phenomena in open quantum systems without adding extra gain and loss terms. Here we propose to use it as a building block to construct a correlated non-Hermitian Hamiltonian in two dimensions. It has the characteristic form of a flux model with clock-anticlockwise non-reciprocal hopping on each plaquette. Adding the on-site Hubbard type interaction we analyze the formation of the longe-range antiferromagnetic order and its spin excitations. Such a model is non-Hermitian, but $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric, which leads to the existence of two regions: a region of unbroken $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry (real-valued spectrum) and a region of broken $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry with exceptional lines and complex-valued energy spectrum. The transition from one region to another is controlled by the value of the on-site interaction parameter and coincides with the metal-insulator transition. We also analyze the spin wave spectrum, which is characterized by two diffusive d-wave type of modes corresponding to gain and loss.

Title: Role of the Direct-to-Indirect Bandgap Crossover in the 'Reverse' Energy Transfer Process
Authors: Gayatri, Mehdi Arfaoui, Debashish Das, Tomasz Kazimierczuk, Sabrine Ayari, Natalia Zawadzka, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Adam Babinski, Saroj K. Nayak, Maciej R. Molas, Arka Karmakar
Abstract: Energy transfer (ET) is a dipole-dipole interaction, mediated by the virtual photon. Traditionally, ET happens from the higher (donor) to lower bandgap (acceptor) material. However, in some rare instances, a 'reverse' ET can happen from the lower-to-higher bandgap material, depending on the strong overlap between the acceptor photoluminescence (PL) and the donor absorption spectra. In this work, we report a reverse ET process from the lower bandgap MoS2 to the higher bandgap WS2, due to a near 'resonant' overlap between the MoS2 B and WS2 A excitonic levels. Changing the MoS2 bandgap from direct to indirect by increasing the layer number results in a reduced ET rate, evidenced by the quenching of the WS2 PL emission. Our work shows at 300 K, the ET timescale of ~33 fs is faster than the reported thermalization of the MoS2 excitonic intervalley scattering (K to K') time and competing with the ultrafast charge transfer timescale. Thus, allowing to open a new direction in understanding the competing inter/intralayer processes.

Title: Normal state quantum geometry, non-locality and superconductivity
Authors: Florian Simon
Abstract: We investigate aspects of the relation between the quantum geometry of the normal state (NS) and the superconducting phase, through the lens of non-locality. By relating band theory to quantum estimation theory, we derive a direct momentum-dependent relation between quantum geometry and the quantum fluctuations of the position operator. We then investigate two effects of the NS quantum geometry on superconductivity. On the one hand, we present a physical interpretation of the conventional and geometric contributions to the superfluid weight in terms of two different movements of the normal state charge carriers forming the Cooper pairs. The first contribution stems from their center-of-mass motion while the second stems from their zero-point motion, thereby explaining its persistence in flat-band systems. On the other hand, we phenomenologically derive an emergent Darwin term driven by the NS quantum metric. We show its form in one and two-body problems, derive the effective pairing potential in $s$-wave superconductors, and explicit its form in the case of two-dimensional massive Dirac fermions. We thus show that the NS quantum metric screens the pairing interaction and weakens superconductivity, which could be tested experimentally by doping a superconductor. Our work reveals the ambivalent relationship between non-interacting quantum geometry and superconductivity, and possibly in other correlated phases.

Title: Towards a $\cos(2φ)$ Josephson element using aluminum junctions with well-transmitted channels

Abstract: We introduce a novel method for fabricating all-aluminum Josephson junctions with highly transmitted conduction channels. Such properties are typically associated with structures requiring intricate fabrication processes, such as atomic contacts or hybrid junctions based on semiconducting nanowires and 2D materials. In contrast, our approach relies solely on standard nanofabrication techniques. The resulting devices exhibit a key signature of high-transmission junctions - Multiple Andreev Reflections (MAR) - in their current-voltage characteristics. Furthermore, we propose a straightforward superconducting circuit design based on these junctions, enabling the implementation of a parity-protected qubit.

Title: Pressure and strain effects on the $\textit{ab initio}$ $GW$ electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$
Authors: Jean-Baptiste de Vaulx, Quintin N. Meier, Pierre Toulemonde, Andrés Cano, Valerio Olevano
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at a critical temperature above 80~K points to a non-conventional pairing mechanism in nickelates as in cuprates, possibly due to electronic correlations. We have calculated from first principles the electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under the effect of pressure and epitaxial strain including correlations by the $GW$ approximation to the many-body self-energy. We find that the Fermi surface is composed of a characteristic cuprate-shape sheet $\beta$ plus a nickelate-specific cylinder $\alpha$, both from Ni $e_g$ orbitals, with a non-negligible drop in the quasiparticle weight and an effective 1D character. This topology results from a delicate balance between the Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ hole pocket $\gamma$, which is suppressed by correlations, and an emerging La-5$d_{x^2-y^2}$ electron pocket induced by both correlation and pressure/strain effects and whose role at low energy has been neglected so far. Unlike cuprates, the electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is already correctly described from ab initio and in agreement with the experiment without the need to introduce Hubbard $U$ adjustable parameters or to invoke a strongly correlated physics.

Title: Two lock-in amplifiers based $3ω$ technique: a practical guide for thermal conductivity experiments in bulk samples
Authors: Alexandre Henriques, Murilo Santoma, Steffen Wirth, Julio Larrea Jiménez, Valentina Martelli
Abstract: The accurate determination of thermal conductivity $\kappa(T)$ in bulk materials at room temperature and above is crucial for evaluating their compatibility for specific applications. The 3$\omega$ technique is an established methodology for studying the thermal conductivity of thin films, becoming particularly suitable in the case of bulk specimens for $T\gtrsim$300K, where standard stationary techniques require significant corrections for radiative losses. Although this method has been employed in several works, it remains not widely adopted because its implementation demands considerable sophistication, including experiment design, thin film deposition techniques, and choices of the geometry of the current/heat transducer, electronics, and analytical treatment of the signals. Based on a critical review of the technique's key technical aspects, this work provides practical support for a rapid and user-friendly implementation, from the design phase through to execution and analysis. We release a Python-based graphical user interface that supports a quantitative estimation of the investigated temperature profiles based on the geometrical parameters (width/length) of the deposited transducer (heater/thermometer metal line) before an experiment, guaranteeing an optimal design of the experimental conditions for each given material under scrutiny.

Title: Observation of average topological phase in disordered Rydberg atom array
Authors: Zongpei Yue, Yu-Feng Mao, Xinhui Liang, Zhen-Xing Hua, Peiyun Ge, Yu-Xin Chao, Kai Li, Chen Jia, Meng Khoon Tey, Yong Xu, Li You
Abstract: Topological phases have been extensively studied over the past two decades, primarily in quantum pure states, where they are protected by exact symmetries. Recently, numerous studies have theoretically demonstrated the existence of average symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in mixed quantum states, which naturally arise in real systems due to decoherence or disorder. Despite extensive experimental observations of exact SPT phases in various systems, ranging from solid-state materials to synthetic matters, average SPT phases are yet to be observed until this work. Here we report direct observations of disorder-induced many-body interacting average SPT phase in an atom array at half-filling, whereby random offsets to tweezer locations forming a lattice implement structural disorder, resulting in fluctuating long-range dipolar interactions between tweezer confined single atoms. The induced topological phase is vindicated by the spatially resolved atom-atom correlation functions for different forms of dimer compositions. The ground state degeneracy in disordered configurations is detected and compared to the regular lattice without disorder. By probing the quench dynamics of a highly excited state, we observe markedly slower decay of edge spin magnetization in comparison to the bulk spin, consistent with the presence of topologically protected edge modes in disordered lattices.

Title: Thermoelectric processes of quantum normal-superconductor interfaces
Authors: L. Arrachea, A. Braggio, P. Burset, E. J. H. Lee, A. Levy Yeyati, R. Sánchez
Abstract: Superconducting interfaces have recently been demonstrated to contain a rich variety of effects that give rise to sizable thermoelectric responses and unexpected thermal properties, despite traditionally being considered poor thermoelectrics due to their intrinsic electron-hole symmetry. We review different mechanisms driving this response in hybrid normal-superconducting junctions, depending on the dimensionality of the mesoscopic interface. In addition to discussing heat to power conversion, cooling and heat transport, special emphasis is put on physical properties of hybrid devices that can be revealed by the thermoelectric effect.

Title: Exact Expansion Formalism for Transport Properties of Heterogeneous Materials Characterized by Arbitrary Continuous Random Fields
Authors: Liyu Zhong, Sheng Mao
Abstract: We derive an exact contrast-expansion formalism for the effective conductivity of heterogeneous materials (media) with local properties described by arbitrary continuous random fields, significantly generalizing the widely used binary-field models. The theory produces a rapidly convergent Neumann-series that, upon Gaussian closure via a Hermite expansion, yields closed-form first-, second- and third-order approximations, which achieve percent-level accuracy at first order for isotropic media. For anisotropic media, second-order approximations achieve sub-2% accuracy across a wide range of local property contrasts and correlations. Our formalism provides mathematically rigorous structure-property closures, with significant implications for the discovery and design of novel graded and architected materials with tailored transport properties.

Title: Superconducting Acoustogalvanic Effect in Twisted Transition Metal Dichalcogenides
Authors: Tsugumi Matsumoto, Ryotaro Sano, Youichi Yanase, Akito Daido
Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals superconductors are attracting much attention owing to their rich phase diagrams including possible unconventional superconductivity. However, they suffer from a lack of reliable methods for identifying their nontrivial pairing symmetries and quantum geometry. In this study, we propose nonlinear responses driven by surface acoustic waves as a novel probe to access exotic Bogoliubov quasiparticles in such superconductors. Our approach is particularly suitable for addressing the superconducting gap structure as the gap energies in these systems typically lie within the frequency range of surface acoustic waves, and thus paves the way toward the experimental identification of exotic superconducting states especially in low-$T_c$ superconductors.

Title: Chiral Anomaly Induced Transverse Planar Transport Phenomena in Three Dimensional Spin-Orbit Coupled Metals
Authors: Rishi G. Gopalakrishnan, Binayyak B. Roy, Gargee Sharma, Sumanta Tewari
Abstract: We investigate linear and nonlinear transverse planar transport phenomena (viz. linear and nonlinear Hall and Nernst coefficients) induced by chiral anomaly in three-dimensional spin-orbit coupled metallic systems. Unlike Weyl semimetals, these systems do not possess multiple Weyl nodes located at isolated points in the momentum space but instead host a pair of Fermi surfaces characterized by opposite Berry curvature fluxes enclosing the same band-degeneracy point. Using semiclassical Boltzmann transport formalism within the relaxation time approximation, we derive first- and second-order transverse planar transport coefficients induced by electrical and thermal gradients in the presence of an in-plane magnetic field. Our analysis reveals distinctive angular dependencies of the transport coefficients, along with characteristic scaling behavior with the magnetic field strength. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the anomaly-induced transport coefficients exhibit an exponential temperature dependence. This unconventional behavior leads to the violations of the Mott relation at comparatively low temperatures, highlighting unique thermoelectric signatures that can be probed experimentally in 3D spin-orbit coupled metallic systems.

Title: Hydrogen defects and band alignment in metal-organic frameworks
Authors: Khang Hoang
Abstract: Band alignment, namely the prediction of band-edge positions of semiconductors and insulators in aqueous solutions, is an important problem in physics and chemistry. Such a prediction is especially challenging for complex materials. Here we present an approach to align band structure of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) on an absolute energy scale which can be used for direct comparison with experiments. Hydrogen defects are used as probes into the chemical bonding of the covalently bonded hybrid materials. An effective defect energy level, defined as the average of the charge-state transition levels of the defects at the linker and at the secondary building unit, is identified as a charge neutrality level to align band structures. This level captures subtle chemical details at both the organic and inorganic building blocks and provides results that are in agreement with experiments in a wide range of different MOFs. We also compare with results obtained from using other approaches involving surface calculations and average pore-center electrostatic potentials.

Title: Decoding the Stability of Transition-Metal Alloys with Theory-infused Deep Learning
Authors: Yang Huang, Shih-Han Wang, Shuyi Cao, Luke E. K. Achenie, Hongliang Xin
Abstract: We introduce an interpretable deep learning framework that predicts the cohesive energy of transition-metal alloys (TMAs) by embedding cohesion theory within graph neural networks (GNNs). Beyond accurate prediction of cohesive energy, a key indicator of thermodynamic stability, the model offers mechanistic insights by disentangling energy contributions into physically meaningful components. These data-driven interpretations reveal periodic trends and stability principles governing transition metals. We apply the model to single-atom alloys (SAAs) to assess their thermodynamic resilience against two destabilizing processes: agglomeration (adatom clustering) and segregation (migration into the subsurface). Our analysis shows that these phenomena are governed by distinct physical factors-agglomeration is primarily influenced by localized d-orbital coupling, while segregation is dictated by delocalized effects such as wavefunction renormalization. This model thus serves as an explainable AI tool for understanding and guiding the design of stable TMAs, with implications for catalysis and materials discovery.

Abstract: The face-centered-cubic lattice is composed of edge-sharing tetrahedra, making it a leading candidate host for strongly frustrated magnetism, but relatively few face-centered frustrated materials have been investigated. In the hydroxide double perovskite CuSn(OH)$_6$, magnetic frustration of the Cu$^{2+}$ quantum spins is partially relieved by strong Jahn-Teller distortions. Nevertheless, the system shows no signs of long-range magnetic order down to 45 mK and instead exhibits broad thermodynamic anomalies in specific heat and magnetization, indicating short-range dynamical spin correlations-a behavior typical of quantum spin liquids. We propose that such an unusual robustness of the spin-liquid-like state is a combined effect of quantum fluctuations of the quantum spins $S=\frac{1}{2}$, residual frustration on the highly distorted face-centered Cu$^{2+}$ sublattice, and correlated proton disorder. Similar to the disorder-induced spin-liquid mimicry in YbMgGaO$_4$ and herbertsmithite, proton disorder destabilizes the long-range magnetic order by introducing randomness into the magnetic exchange interaction network. However, unlike the quenched substitutional disorder on the magnetic sublattice, which is difficult to control, proton disorder can in principle be tuned through pressure-driven proton ordering transitions. This opens up the prospect of tuning the degree of disorder in a magnetic system to better understand its influence on the magnetic ground state.

Title: Coherent coupling between YBCO superconducting resonators and sub-micrometer-thick YIG films
Authors: Alberto Ghirri, Mattia Cavani, Claudio Bonizzoni, Marco Affronte
Abstract: In cavity magnonics, magnon-photon hybridization has been widely investigated for both fundamental studies and applications. Planar superconducting resonators operating at microwave frequencies have demonstrated the possibility to achieve high couplings with magnons by exploiting the confinement of the microwave field in a reduced volume. Here we report a study of the coupling of high-$T_c$ YBCO superconducting waveguides with 104-nm-thick YIG magnetic films. We study the evolution of mode frequencies as a function of temperature and extract the coupling strength of hybrid magnon-photon modes. We show that the experimental results can be reproduced using a simple model in which the temperature dependence of the penetration depth accounts for the evolution of the polaritonic spectrum.

Title: Decomposition of general grain boundaries
Authors: Wei Wan, Junwen Deng, Changxin Tang
Abstract: As a central part of microstructure evolution, grain boundary (GB) migration is believed to be both monolithic and unidirectional. But here, we introduce the concept of GB decomposition: one GB separates into two new GBs by exerting differential Peach-Koehler forces on its disconnections. Molecular dynamics simulation is used to reveal the disconnection mechanisms and direction-dependent motion behaviors associated with the reversible decomposition of a nickel {\Sigma}7 general GB. We also observed a decomposition-like process in a high-energy diffraction microscopy (HEDM) dataset of high purity nickel polycrystal (Science 2021, 374, 189-193), and performed HEDM-data-based simulations to confirm it. The decomposition should be considered as a new GB kinetic behavior, based on its particularity and potential universality.

Title: Magnetotransport in two-dimensional interacting massless-massive fermion mixtures
Authors: Yuping Huang, D. S. Eliseev, V. M. Kovalev, O. V. Kibis, Yu. Yu. Illarionov, I. G. Savenko
Abstract: The presence of two types of holes, namely the Dirac holes and the massive holes, in a two-dimensional sample exposed to an external permanent magnetic field leads to the emergence of the temperature and magnetic field--dependent contribution to the resistivity due to their interactions. Taking a HgTe-based two-dimensional semimetal as a testbed, we develop a theoretical model describing the role of interactions between the degenerate massive and massless Dirac particles for the magnetoconductivity and resistivity in the presence of a classical magnetic field. If only the Dirac holes are present in the system, the magnetoconductivity acquires a finite interaction-induced contribution which would be vanishing for the parabolic spectrum. It demonstrates $T^4\ln(1/T)$ behavior at low temperatures for short-range interhole interaction potential, and $T^2$-like behavior in case of long-range interhole interaction potential. However, the magnetoresistivity and the Hall effect are not affected by the Dirac holes interparticle correlations. In contrast to this, the presence of two types of holes provides a finite contribution to the magnetoconductivity, magnetoresistivity, and the classical Hall effect resistivity. The temperature behavior of the magnetoconductivity here is $\sim T^2$ in the case of the short-range constant interparticle interaciton potential and $T^2\ln(1/T)$ for the bare unscreened Coulomb interaction. A classically strong magnetic field suppresses the interaction-induced corrections to magnetoresistivity of massless-massive hole gas mixture.

Title: Magnetocalorics of singlet ground state induced moment magnets
Authors: Peter Thalmeier
Abstract: In f-electron materials like Pr or U compounds with non-Kramers states of the f-shell the ground state may be a nonmagnetic singlet due to the action of the crystalline electric field. Nevertheless these compounds can order magnetically. They develop a ground state moment and long range order due to the spontaneous admixture of the excited state into the ground state caused by inter-site exchange. This mechanism can establish magnetic order if a control parameter exceeds a critical value defining the quantum critical point between disordered and magnetic phase. Here we investigate the magnetocaloric properties of such quantum magnets where the entropy release at low temperature is due to a competition between thermal depopulation and spontaneous order effects. We determine field and temperature dependence of specific heat for ferro- and antiferromagnetic order and also calculate the adiabatic magneto- and barocaloric cooling rates. As a model application we discuss the magnetic specific heat of the new induced ferromagnet PrIr3. Furthermore we analyze the excitation spectrum of the singlet induced moment magnets in an external field with particular emphasis on field and temperature dependence of the critical soft mode. We find that the latter is fragile and exists only at specific points in the phase diagram.

Title: How transparent is graphene? A surface science perspective on remote epitaxy
Authors: Zach LaDuca, Anshu Sirohi, Quinn Campbell, Jason K Kawasaki
Abstract: Remote epitaxy is the synthesis of a single crystalline film on a graphene-covered substrate, where the film adopts epitaxial registry to the substrate as if the graphene is transparent. Despite many exciting applications for flexible electronics, strain engineering, and heterogeneous integration, an understanding of the fundamental synthesis mechanisms remains elusive. Here we offer a perspective on the synthesis mechanisms, focusing on the foundational assumption of graphene transparency. We identify challenges for quantifying the strength of the remote substrate potential that permeates through graphene, and propose Fourier and beating analysis as a bias-free method for decomposing the lattice potential contributions from the substrate, from graphene, and from surface reconstructions, each at different frequencies. We highlight the importance of graphene-induced reconstructions on epitaxial templating, drawing comparison to moiré epitaxy. We highlight the role of the remote potential in tuning surface diffusion and adatom kinetics on graphene, which are crucial for navigating the competition between remote epitaxy and defect-seeded mechanisms like pinhole epitaxy. In light of this weak remote potential, we re-evaluate the current state-of-the-art experimental evidence, highlighting why it remains challenging to experimentally validate a ``remote'' epitaxy mechanism that cannot be explained by alternatives, such as pinhole-seeded epitaxy or serial van der Waals epitaxy. We end with one experimental example that, to out knowledge, cannot be explained by competing mechanisms: a different long-range epitaxial relationship for GdPtSb films grown on graphene/sapphire, compared to direct epitaxy on sapphire. We suggest for future experiments that directly measure the remote potential and impact of tunable growth kinetics.

Title: Memory in strain-tuned insulator-metal-insulator sequence of transitions after photoexcitation in the Mott material V2O3
Authors: O. Yu. Gorobtsov, Y. Kalcheim, Z. Shao, A. Shabalin, N. Hua, D. Weinstock, R. Bouck, M. Seaberg, D. Zhu, O. G. Shpyrko, I. K. Schuller, A. Singer
Abstract: Memory effects during metal-insulator transitions in quantum materials reveal complex physics and potential for novel electronics mimicking biological neural systems. Nonetheless, understanding of memory and nonlinearity in sequential non-equilibrium transitions remains elusive as the full chain of transitions can involve features lasting anywhere from femtoseconds to microseconds. Here, we extend time-resolved x-ray Bragg diffraction to the dynamic range of timescales spanning 9 orders of magnitude to fully trace the pathways of photoexcited insulator-metal transition and the following relaxation through non-equilibrium metal-insulator transitions in epitaxial films of V2O3, a promising Mott material. We find 5 orders of magnitude variation in metal-insulator transition time, from nanoseconds to hundreds of microseconds, depending on pre-excitation phase state. We provide a theoretical explanation and simulations based on strain feedback to domain nucleation. The lingering transition is stretched in time by memory of spatial and energy heterogeneity and, contrary to known memory effects in vanadium oxides commonly described by power laws, follows an extremely (factor below 0.2) stretched exponential. The induced dramatic slowdown in the light-driven highly correlated system signifies unusually high heterogeneity of transition barriers similar to biological systems, and demonstrates importance of non-local correlations of structure in evolution of transitional phases in quantum materials.

Title: Collective ballistic motion explains fast aggregation in adhesive active matter
Authors: Emanuel F. Teixeira, Pablo de Castro, Carine P. Beatrici, Heitor C. M. Fernandes, Leonardo G. Brunnet
Abstract: Inspired by motile cells in tissue formation, we find that active systems of self-aligning adhesive particles undergo ballistic aggregation through a flocking transition. This kinetic regime emerges when the cluster persistence length grows faster with cluster mass than the intercluster distance does. We also identify and explain distinct non-collective kinetic regimes, including biologically relevant long-lived transients. Our analytical and numerical results offer a unified framework explaining the broad range of experimentally observed aggregation exponents in cellular systems and reveal physical principles potentially critical for timely tissue organization.

Title: Phase field modelling of the growth and detachment of bubbles in a hydrogen electrolyzer
Authors: Carlos Uriarte, Marco A. Fontelos, Manuel Arrayás
Abstract: We develop and implement numerically a phase field model for the growth and detachment of a gas bubble resting on an electrode and being filled with hydrogen produced by water electrolysis. The bubble is surrounded by a viscous liquid, has a prescribed static contact angle and is also subject to gravitational forces. We compute, as a function of the static contact angle, the time at which the bubble detaches from the substrate and what volume it has at that time. We also investigate de dependence of the detachment time on other parameters such as the applied voltage and the hydrogen ion concentration at the fluid bulk.

Title: Bosonization in $R$-paraparticle Luttinger models
Authors: Dennis F. Salinel, Kristian Hauser A. Villegas
Abstract: We reintroduce the parafermion-paraboson classification in $R$-paraparticles in terms of their average occupation numbers, analogous to Green's parastatistics. The notion of $p$-order in $R$-parafermions is also redefined as the maximum number of particles that can occupy a quantum state. An example of an order-$2$ $R$-parafermion with $m=2$ internal degrees of freedom is presented, which obeys an exclusion principle that is not Pauli's. The interacting $R$-parafermions are studied in the context of bosonization. Specifically, we show that while density waves are generally bosonic in nature and that flavor-charge separation naturally occurs for any one-dimensional $R$-parafermion system described by the Luttinger model, flavor waves do not always satisfy bose statistics. Comparison of the partition functions further show that only $(p=1)$-ordered $R$-parafermions are compatible with the bosonization procedure in the low-energy limit. Based from these results, we discuss a potential realization of $R$-parafermion signatures in one-dimensional systems.

Title: Extracting Phonon Quasiparticles from Molecular Dynamics Simulations
Authors: Wenjing Li, Yong Lu, Fawei Zheng
Abstract: Phonon anharmonicity is ubiquitous in real materials and is crucial for understanding thermal properties and phase stability. In this work, we show that phonon quasiparticles are optimally described by modes with maximum lifetimes, and prove that information about these quasiparticles is contained in two small matrices $\mathcal{S}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$, which can be constructed directly from molecular dynamics simulations. Based on these knowledge, we proposed an optimization scheme, which allows us to efficiently determine temperature-dependent phonon modes along with their frequencies and lifetimes. We verified this method by applying it to silicon and cubic CaSiO$_3$, where it successfully captured their temperature-dependent phonon behaviors and the well-known phonon softening in cubic CaSiO$_3$. This theory provides a convenient tool for investigating phonon quasiparticles and can be extended to study other quasiparticles, such as electrons, holes, and magnons.

Title: The Thermodynamic Limit of Extreme First-Passage Times
Authors: Talia Baravi, Eli Barkai
Abstract: The statistics of the slowest first-passage time among a large population of $N$ searchers is crucial for determining the completion time of many stochastic processes. Classical extreme-value theory predicts that for diffusing particles in a finite domain of size $L$, the slowest first passage time follows a Gumbel distribution, but a Fréchet distribution in an infinite domain. Here, we study the physically relevant thermodynamic limit where both $N$ and $L$ diverge while the density $\rho = N/L$ remains constant. We obtain an explicit solution for the extreme value in the thermodynamic limit, which recovers the Fréchet and Gumbel distributions in the low- and high-density limits, respectively, and reveals new, nontrivial behavior at intermediate densities. We then extend the framework to compact diffusion on fractal domains, showing that the walk dimension $d_w$ and fractal dimension $d_f$ control the extreme-value statistics via geometry-dependent scaling. The theory yields the full set of moments and finite-density corrections, providing a unified description of slowest-arrival times in confined Euclidean and fractal media.

Title: Fast phase prediction of charged polymer blends by white-box machine learning surrogates
Authors: Clayton Ellis, Xinyi Fang, Christopher Balzer, Timothy Quah, M. Scott Shell, Glenn H. Fredrickson, Mengyang Gu
Abstract: Compatibilized polymer blends are a complex, yet versatile and widespread category of material. When the components of a binary blend are immiscible, they are typically driven towards a macrophase-separated state, but with the introduction of electrostatic interactions, they can be either homogenized or shifted to microphase separation. However, both experimental and simulation approaches face significant challenges in efficiently exploring the vast design space of charge-compatibilized polymer blends, encompassing chemical interactions, architectural properties, and composition. In this work, we introduce a white-box machine learning approach integrated with polymer field theory to predict the phase behavior of these systems, which is significantly more accurate than conventional black-box machine learning approaches. The random phase approximation (RPA) calculation is used as a testbed to determine polymer phases. Instead of directly predicting the polymer phase output of RPA calculations from a large input space by a machine learning model, we build a parallel partial Gaussian process model to predict the most computationally intensive component of the RPA calculation that only involves polymer architecture parameters as inputs. This approach substantially reduces the computational cost of the RPA calculation across a vast input space with nearly 100% accuracy for out-of-sample prediction, enabling rapid screening of polymer blend charge-compatibilization designs. More broadly, the white-box machine learning strategy offers a promising approach for dramatic acceleration of polymer field-theoretic methods for mapping out polymer phase behavior.

Title: An $ab\;initio$ answer to long-debated questions about superconducting Nb$_3$Sn
Authors: Alessio Cucciari, Lilia Boeri
Abstract: We present the first fully $ab\;initio$ microscopic description of cubic and tetragonal Nb$_3$Sn. We compute the anharmonic free energy surface, phonon spectra, and solve the full-bandwidth anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg equations for the superconducting gap of the two phases. Our results show that anharmonic effects are crucial to stabilize both the cubic and tetragonal structures, yielding phonon spectra in excellent agreement with neutron scattering data. We find that the martensitic transition is weakly first-order and that the superconducting gap is strongly anisotropic yet fully-open, with contributions from both longitudinal and transverse Nb $d$-orbitals, revealing an unexpected three-dimensional pairing mechanism. We also find that the experimentally observed reduction of the upper critical field $H_{c2}$ across the transition is explained by a combination of overall weaker electron-phonon coupling and a redistribution of Fermi velocities, which shifts parts of the Fermi surface to longer coherence lengths and limits $H_{c2}$. Based on these insights, we propose that Sn-site doping could enhance transverse-state coupling and gap isotropy, potentially improving both $T_c$ and $H_{c2}$, while Nb-site doping reinforce $H_{c2}$ at the cost of lowering $T_c$.

Title: Rediscovery of Cooper pair factor
Authors: M. Porforough
Abstract: In superconductivity, the Cooper pair \cite{Ref1} is a bound state of a pair of weakly interacting electrons in a metal which forces us to insert a factor of $2e$ (instead of $e$) in the phase of the wave function in the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect. We claim that the existence of such a factor is universal. In \cite{Ref2}, we proposed an explanation for the AB effect (or equivalently, a supersymmetric Dirac monopole) based on SUSY. It is shown that this model opens a path to recapture this factor without the need for arguments related to attractive pairs. The idea is also applied to the case of a nonlinear sigma model (NLSM) when it is coupled to $\mathcal{N}=1$, supergravity.

Title: Phase field modelling of the detachment of bubbles from a solid substrate
Authors: Carlos Uriarte, Marco A. Fontelos, Manuel Arrayás
Abstract: We develop and implement numerically a phase field model for the evolution and detachment of a gas bubble resting on a solid substrate and surrounded by a viscous liquid. The bubble has a static contact angle $\theta $ and will be subject to gravitational forces. We compute, as a function of the static contact angle, the cricital Bond number over which bubbles detach from the substrate. Then, we perform similar studies for bubble resting on inclined substrates and bubbles under the action of an external flow. We provide approximate formulas for the critical Bond number under all these circumstances. Our method is also able to resolve the pinchoff of the bubble and the possible appearence of satellites.

Title: Impurity-induced counter skin-effect and linear modes in non-Hermitian systems
Authors: Nico G. Leumer, Dario Bercioux
Abstract: Non-reciprocal lattice systems are among the simplest non-Hermitian systems, exhibiting several key features absent in their Hermitian counterparts. In this study, we investigate the Hatano-Nelson model with impurity and unveil how the impurity influences the intrinsic non-Hermitian skin effect of the system. We present an exact analytical solution to the problem under open and periodic boundary conditions, irrespective of the impurity's position and strength. Numerical simulations thoroughly validate this exact solution. Our analysis reveals a distinctive phenomenon where a specific impurity strength, determined by the non-reciprocal hopping parameters, induces a unique skin state at the impurity site. This impurity state exhibits a skin effect that counterbalances the boundary-induced skin effect, a phenomenon we term the \emph{impurity-induced counter skin-effect}. These findings offer insights into the dynamics of non-Hermitian systems with impurities, elucidating the complex interplay between impurities and the system's non-reciprocal nature. We propose a possible implementation of this system for a non-Hermitian discrete-time quantum walk, and we demonstrate that an impurity-induced counter skin-effect also exists in multi-band models.

Title: Phase Transition in Long-Range $q-$state Models via Contours. Clock and Potts Models with Fields
Authors: Lucas Affonso, Rodrigo Bissacot, Gilberto Faria, Kelvyn Welsch
Abstract: Using the group structure of the state space of $q-$state models, a new definition of contour for long-range spin-systems in $\Z^d$ ($d\geq 2$), and a multidimensional version of Fröhlich-Spencer contours, we prove phase transition for a class of ferromagnetic long-range systems which includes the Clock and Potts models. Our arguments work for the entire region of exponents of regular power-law interactions, namely $\alpha > d$, and for any $q \geq 2$. As an application, we prove phase transition for Potts models with decaying fields when the field decays fast enough and in the presence of a random external field.

Title: Holographic Non-Hermitian Lattices and Junctions and their RG Flows
Authors: Daniel Arean, David Garcia-Fariña
Abstract: We construct and study inhomogeneous non-Hermitian strongly coupled holographic field theories. We consider two models: a lattice where in each site there is some inflow/outflow of matter and a Hermitian/non-Hermitian/Hermitian junction. By tuning a complex external gauge field, we find a non-Hermitian model which can be mapped to a Hermitian one via a complexified U(1) gauge transformation. On the other hand, in the absence of the gauge field we find non-Hermitian solutions with a purely imaginary current. Despite this, all expectation values respect PT symmetry and thus we expect the system to feature unitary time evolution. Nonetheless, we have not found a map bringing these solutions to a Hermitian description. We study the RG flows of solutions with imaginary current finding that in the IR they can be mapped to a Hermitian conformal fixed point via a complexified U(1) transformation. Remarkably, we also obtain solutions where the null energy condition is violated near the boundary of the dual geometry.

Title: Soft gravitons as Goldstone modes of spontaneously broken asymptotic symmetries in de Sitter spacetimes
Authors: Martin S. Sloth
Abstract: I demonstrate that soft graviton modes in de Sitter spacetimes are the Goldstone modes of the spontaneously broken asymptotic symmetry group of de Sitter space. I then show that any local measurement, including the effects of the environment, will collapse the symmetric state onto the broken state in the large volume limit. In any discussion involving observers, de Sitter spacetimes are, therefore, best described globally by the broken phase, while local observers, in the small volume limit, can not discriminate between different degenerate global vacuum states and are therefore best described by the symmetric state. As a consequence, a small Hubble-sized local region initially in the symmetric state will, after a time scale corresponding to the Page time of de Sitter space, have expanded to a large region in the broken state. This illuminates the physical nature of soft graviton modes in de Sitter spacetimes.

Title: User-friendly TWA for dissipative spin dynamics
Authors: Hossein Hosseinabadi, Oksana Chelpanova, Jamir Marino
Abstract: We put forward a user-friendly framework of the truncated Wigner approximation (TWA) for dissipative quantum many-body systems. Our approach is computationally affordable and it features a straightforward implementation. The leverage of the method can be ultimately traced to an intimate connection between the TWA and the semi-classical limit of the quantum Langevin equation, which we unveil by resorting to a path integral representation of the Lindbladian. Our approach allows us to explore dynamics from early to late times in a variety of models at the core of modern AMO research, including lasing, central spin models, driven arrays of Rydbergs and correlated emission in free space. Notably, our TWA approach outperforms the cumulant expansion method in certain models and performs comparably well in others, all while offering significantly lower computational costs and a much simpler formulation of the dynamical equations. We therefore argue that TWA could become in the near future a primary tool for a fast and efficient first exploration of driven-dissipative many-body dynamics on consumer grade computers.

Title: Contagion mean field model for transport in urban traffic networks
Authors: Arturo Berrones Santos, Gerardo Palafox Castillo, Sareé González Huesca, Carlos Alberto Aldana Sandoval
Abstract: Theoretical arguments and empirical evidence for the emergence of macroscopic epidemic type behavior, in the form of Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) or Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) processes in urban traffic congestion from microscopic network flows is given. Moreover, it's shown that the emergence of SIS/SIR implies a relationship between traffic flow and density, which is consistent with observations of the so called \emph{Fundamental Diagram of Traffic} (FDT), which is a characteristic signature of vehicle movement phenomena that spans multiple scales. Our results put in more firm grounds recent findings that indicate that traffic congestion at the aggregate level can be modeled by simple contagion dynamics.

Title: Circuit structure-preserving error mitigation for High-Fidelity Quantum Simulations
Authors: Ruizhe Shen, Tianqi Chen, Ching Hua Lee
Abstract: Developing methods to accurately characterize and mitigate the impact of noise is crucial for enhancing the fidelity of quantum simulations on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. In this work, we present a circuit structure-preserving error mitigation framework for parameterized quantum circuits. A key advantage of our approach lies in its ability to retain the original circuit architecture while effectively characterizing and mitigating gate errors, enabling robust and high-fidelity simulations. This makes it particularly well suited for small-scale circuits that require repeated execution at large sampling rates. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we perform variational quantum simulations of a non-Hermitian ferromagnetic transverse-field Ising chain on IBM Quantum processors. The mitigated result shows excellent agreement with exact theoretical predictions across a range of noise levels. Our strategy offers a practical solution for addressing gate-induced errors and significantly broadens the scope of feasible quantum simulations on current quantum hardware.

Title: Bridging the classical and quantum regimes in a dissipative Ising chain
Authors: Zhenming Zhang, Haowei Li, Wei Yi
Abstract: We study the long-time dynamics of a dissipative Ising chain with varying quantum correlation. Invoking an ensemble-average formalism, and assuming spatial translation symmetry, we show that the dynamics can be described by a Lindblad master equation with an interpolated coherent Hamiltonian. In the classical limit, the interpolation Hamiltonian leads to a set of nonlinear equations of motion, where limit cycles can emerge in the long-time dynamics. In the quantum limit, by contrast, the system approaches a ferromagnetic steady state at long times. In between the two extremes, the discrete spatial translation symmetry can be spontaneously broken, as an antiferromagnetic steady state emerges, bridging the classical and quantum regimes. In particular, we illustrate how the classical limit-cycle behavior gradually disappears with the increase of quantum correlation. Since our model in the two extremes respectively applies to a dissipative Rydberg gas in the high- and zero-temperature limits, we expect it to provide a qualitatively correct description of dissipative Rydberg gases at interim temperatures, and shed light on the fate of limit cycles in a quantum open system.

Title: Dynamics of Vortex Clusters on a Torus
Authors: Aswathy K R, Udaya Maurya, Surya Teja Gavva, Rickmoy Samanta
Abstract: We investigate the collective dynamics of multivortex assemblies in a two dimensional (2D) toroidal fluid film of distinct curvature and topology. The incompressible and inviscid nature of the fluid allows a Hamiltonian description of the vortices, along with a self-force of geometric origin, arising from the standard Kirchhoff-Routh regularization procedure. The Hamiltonian dynamics is constructed in terms of $q$-digamma functions $\Psi_q(z)$, closely related to the Schottky-Klein prime function known to arise in multiply connected domains. We show the fundamental motion of the two-vortex system and identify five classes of geodesics on the torus for the special case of a vortex dipole, along with subtle distinctions from vortices in quantum superfluids. In multivortex assemblies, we observe that a randomly initialized cluster of vortices of the same sign and strength (chiral cluster) remains geometrically confined on the torus, while undergoing an overall drift along the toroidal direction, exhibiting collective dynamics. A cluster of fast and slow vortices also show the collective toroidal drift, with the fast ones predominantly occupying the core region and the slow ones expelled to the periphery of the revolving cluster. Vortex clusters of mixed sign but zero net circulation (achiral cluster) show unconfined dynamics and scatter all over the surface of the torus. A chiral cluster with an impurity in the form of a single vortex of opposite sign also show similar behavior as a pure chiral cluster, with occasional ``jets" of dipoles leaving and re-entering the revolving cluster. The work serves as a step towards analysis of vortex clusters in models that incorporate harmonic velocities in the Hodge decomposition.

Title: High to low temperature: $O(N)$ model at large $N$
Authors: Justin R. David, Srijan Kumar
Abstract: We study the $O(N)$ vector model for scalars with quartic interaction at large $N$ on $S^1\times S^2$ without the singlet constraint. The non-trivial fixed point of the model is described by a thermal mass satisfying the gap equation at large $N$. We obtain the free energy and the energy density for the model as a series at low temperature in units of the radius of the sphere. We show these results agree with the Borel-Padé extrapolations of the high temperature expansions of the free energy and energy density obtained in our previous work. This agreement validates both the expansions and demonstrates that low temperature expansions obtained here correspond to the same fixed point studied earlier at high temperature. We obtain the ratio of the free energy of the theory at the non-trivial fixed point to that of the Gaussian theory at all values of temperature. This ratio begins at $4/5$ when the temperature is infinity, decreases to a minimum value of $0.760937$, then increases and approaches unity as the temperature is decreased.

Title: Violation of kinetic uncertainty relation in maser heat engines: Role of spontaneous emission
Authors: Varinder Singh, Euijoon Kwon, Jae Sung Lee
Abstract: We investigate the kinetic uncertainty relation (KUR)-a fundamental trade-off between dynamical activity and current fluctuations-in two configurations of a maser heat engine. We find that KUR violations arise only in one model. This asymmetry originates from spontaneous emission, which breaks the structural symmetry between the configurations and modifies their coherence dynamics. While we analyze several contributing factors-including statistical signatures such as the Fano factor and the ratio of dynamical activity to current-our results show that the decisive mechanism is the slower decoherence in one configuration, which enables quantum violations of the classical steady-state KUR bound. By contrast, the faster coherence decay in the other configuration suppresses such violations, driving it closer to classical behavior. These findings highlight the critical role of decoherence mechanisms in determining fundamental thermodynamic bounds and provide insights for the design of quantum heat engines in which the control of decoherence is central to suppressing fluctuations and enhancing reliable performance.

Title: A recursive formula for the $n^\text{th}$ survival function and the $n^\text{th}$ first passage time distribution for jump and diffusion processes. Applications to the pricing of $n^\text{th}$-to-default CDS
Authors: Alessio Lapolla
Abstract: We derive some rather general, but complicated, formulae to compute the survival function and the first passage time distribution of the $n^\text{th}$ coordinate of a many-body stochastic process in the presence of a killing barrier. First we will study the case of two coordinates and then we will generalize the results to three or more coordinates. Even if the results are difficult to implement, we will provide examples of their use applying them to a physical system, the single file diffusion, and to the financial problem of pricing a $n^\text{th}$-to-default credit default swap ($n^\text{th}$-CDS)

Title: Simulation of one and two qubit superconducting quantum gates under the non-Markovian $1/f$ noise
Authors: Yinjia Chen, Shuocang Zhang, Qiang Shi
Abstract: Non-Markovian $1/f$ noise consists a dominant source of decoherence in superconducting qubits, yet its slow nature poses a significant challenge for accurate simulation. Here we develop a hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) framework that enables efficient and reliable modeling of qubit dynamics and gate operations under $1/f$ noise. By using the approach, it is first shown that perturbative quantum master equations may fail to reproduce the correct dephasing dynamics of a qubit coupled to slow baths. We then analyze dynamical decoupling sequences by including effects of finite pulse duration. It is found that different pulse sequences results in different behavior in error accumulation: all X-CPMG sequences exhibit linear scaling with parity effects, Y-CPMG follows quadratic growth, and alternating XY-type sequences can suppress the error accumulation significantly. Finally, we extend the framework to two-qubit cross-resonance (CR) gates, reconstructing the full Choi matrix and Pauli Transfer Matrix (PTM) to identify the incoherent error induced by $1/f$ noise. Together, these results establish HEOM as a robust methodology for simulating the environmental noise in superconducting circuits and provide new insights into error mechanisms in both single- and two-qubit gates.
