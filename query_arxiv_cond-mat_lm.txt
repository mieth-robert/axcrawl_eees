Title: Meissner-Ochsenfeld effect in semiconductor nanostructures with negative-U shells
Authors: N.T. Bagraev, N.A. Dovator, L.E. Klyachkin, A.M. Malyarenko
Abstract: The Meissner-Ochsenfeld effect is demonstrated for the first time at room temperature. The diamagnetic response of a silicon nanostructure with edge channels covered by chains of negative U dipole boron centers is studied when put in (removed from) an external magnetic field. Measurements of the diamagnetic response were carried out by recording the values of magnetization and generation currents. There is good agreement between the results of measurements of the generated internal magnetic field obtained using a ferroprobe and recording the EMF induced by the occurrence of generation currents in an external magnetic field, which determines the conditions of the mechanism of the nondissipative transport in the edge channels at room temperature, which is caused by their interactions with single carriers through negative U dipole boron centers. The interrelation of the magnetization hysteresis and the magnitude of the EMF induced by the occurrence of generation currents indicates the possibilities of the electrical registration of the Meissner-Ochsenfeld effect in nanostructures manufactured within the framework of the Hall geometry.

Authors: N.T. Bagraev, L.E. Klyachkin, S.A. Kukushkin, A.M. Malyarenko, A.V. Osipov, V.V. Romanov, N.I. Rul, K.B. Taranets
Abstract: The electrical, magnetic and optical properties of edge channels consisting of spin circuits that contain single carriers in nanostructures of silicon, silicon carbide and cadmium fluoride are investigated. It is demonstrated that due to the presence of chains of negative-U dipole centers at the boundaries of the spin circuits, the latter are Andreev molecules for generating terahertz radiation.

Title: Fixed-grid sharp-interface numerical solutions to the three-phase spherical Stefan problem
Authors: Yavkreet Swami, Jacob Barajas, Amneet Pal Singh Bhalla
Abstract: Many metal manufacturing processes involve phase change phenomena, which include melting, boiling, and vaporization. These phenomena often occur concurrently. A prototypical 1D model for understanding the phase change phenomena is the Stefan problem. There is a large body of literature discussing the analytical solution to the two-phase Stefan problem that describes only the melting or boiling of phase change materials (PCMs) with one moving interface. Density-change effects that induce additional fluid flow during phase change are generally neglected in the literature to simplify the math of the Stefan problem. In our recent work [1], we provide analytical and numerical solutions to the three-phase Stefan problem with simultaneous occurrences of melting, solidification, boiling, and condensation in Cartesian coordinates. Our current work builds on our previous work to solve a more challenging problem: the three-phase Stefan problem in spherical coordinates for finite-sized particles. There are three moving interfaces in this system: the melt front, the boiling front, and the outer boundary which is in contact with the atmosphere. Although an analytical solution could not be found for this problem, we solved the governing equations using a fixed-grid sharp-interface method with second-order spatio-temporal accuracy. Using a small-time analytical solution, we predict a reasonably accurate estimate of temperature (in the three phases) and interface positions and velocities at the start of the simulation. Our numerical method is validated by reproducing the two-phase nanoparticle melting results of Font et al. [2]. Lastly, we solve the three-phase Stefan problems numerically to demonstrate the importance of kinetic energy terms during phase change of smaller (nano) particles. In contrast, these effects diminish for large particles (microns and larger).

Title: Average Categorical Symmetries in One-Dimensional Disordered Systems
Authors: Yabo Li, Meng Cheng, Ruochen Ma
Abstract: We study one-dimensional disordered systems with average non-invertible symmetries, where quenched disorder may locally break part of the symmetry while preserving it upon disorder averaging. A canonical example is the random transverse-field Ising model, which at criticality exhibits an average Kramers-Wannier duality. We consider the general setting in which the full symmetry is described by a $G$-graded fusion category $\mathcal{B}$, whose identity component $\mathcal{A}$ remains exact, while the components with nontrivial $G$-grading are realized either exactly or only on average. We develop a topological holographic framework that encodes the symmetry data of the 1D system in a 2D topological order $\mathcal{Z}[\mathcal{A}]$ (the Drinfeld center of $\mathcal{A}$), enriched by an exact or, respectively, average $G$ symmetry. Within this framework, we obtain a complete classification of anomalies and average symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases: when the components with nontrivial $G$-grading are realized only on average, the symmetry is anomaly-free if and only if $\mathcal{Z}[\mathcal{A}]$ admits a magnetic Lagrangian algebra that is invariant under the permutation action of $G$ on anyons. When an anomaly is present, we show that the ground state of a single disorder realization is long-range entangled with probability one in the thermodynamic limit, and is expected to exhibit power-law Griffiths singularities in the low-energy spectrum. Finally, we present an explicit, exactly solvable lattice model based on a symmetry-enriched string-net construction. It yields trivial ground state ensemble in the anomaly-free case, and exhibits exotic low-energy behavior in the presence of an average anomaly.

Title: Predicting magnetism with first-principles AI
Authors: Max Geier, Liang Fu
Abstract: Computational discovery of magnetic materials remains challenging because magnetism arises from the competition between kinetic energy and Coulomb interaction that is often beyond the reach of standard electronic-structure methods. Here we tackle this challenge by directly solving the many-electron Schrödinger equation with neural-network variational Monte Carlo, which provides a highly expressive variational wavefunction for strongly correlated systems. Applying this technique to transition metal dichalcogenide moiré semicondutors, we predict itinerant ferromagnetism in WSe$_2$/WS$_2$ and an antiferromagnetic insulator in twisted $\Gamma$-valley homobilayer, using the same neural network without any physics input beyond the microscopic Hamiltonian. Crucially, both types of magnetic states are obtained from a single calculation within the $S_z=0$ sector, removing the need to compute and compare multiple $S_z$ sectors. This significantly reduces computational cost and paves the way for faster and more reliable magnetic material design.

Title: Anomalous spin transport in integrable random quantum circuits
Authors: Songlei Wang, Chenguang Liang, Hongzheng Zhao, Zhi-Cheng Yang
Abstract: High-temperature spin transport in integrable quantum spin chains exhibits a rich dynamical phase diagram, including ballistic, superdiffusive, and diffusive regimes. While integrability is known to survive in static and periodically driven systems, its fate in the complete absence of time-translation symmetry, particularly in interacting random quantum circuits, has remained unclear. Here we construct integrable random quantum circuits built from inhomogeneous XXZ R-matrices. Remarkably, integrability is preserved for arbitrary sequences of gate layers, ranging from quasiperiodic to fully random, thereby explicitly breaking both continuous and discrete time-translation symmetry. Using large-scale time-dependent density-matrix renormalization group simulations at infinite temperature and half filling, we map out the resulting spin-transport phase diagram and identify ballistic, superdiffusive, and diffusive regimes controlled by the spectral parameters of the R-matrices. The spatiotemporal structure of spin correlations within each regime depends sensitively on the inhomogeneity, exhibiting spatial asymmetry and sharp peak structures tied to near-degenerate quasiparticle velocities. To account for these findings, we develop a generalized hydrodynamics framework adapted to time-dependent integrable circuits, yielding Euler-scale predictions for correlation functions, Drude weights, and diffusion bounds. This approach identifies the quasiparticles governing transport and quantitatively captures both the scaling exponents and fine structures of the correlation profiles observed numerically. Our results demonstrate that exact Yang-Baxter integrability is compatible with stochastic quantum dynamics and establish generalized hydrodynamics as a predictive framework for transport in time-dependent integrable systems.

Title: Negative Hybridization: a Potential Cure for Braiding with Imperfect Majorana Modes
Authors: Cole Peeters, Themba Hodge, Stephan Rachel
Abstract: Majorana zero modes, the elementary building blocks for the quantum bits of topological quantum computers, are known to suffer from hybridization as their wavefunctions begin to overlap. This breaks the ground state degeneracy, splitting their energy levels and leading to an accumulation of error when performing topological quantum gates. Here we show that the energy splitting of the Majorana zero modes can become negative, which can be utilized to reduce the average hybridization energy of the total gate. We present two illustrative examples where negative hybridization suppresses gate errors to such an extent that they remain below the fault-tolerance threshold. As an intrinsic property of Majorana zero modes, negative hybridization enables systems based on imperfect Majorana zero modes to regain functionality for quantum information processing.

Title: Majorana zero modes in superconductor-magnet heterostructures with d-wave order
Authors: Bastien Fajardo, T. Pereg-Barnea, Arun Paramekanti, Kartiek Agarwal
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions in proximity to superconductors offer a route to engineering topological superconductivity due to the synthetic spin-orbit coupling engendered by the spin twist of the skyrmion texture. Previous theoretical works show that this leads to Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in skyrmion-vortex pairs for s-wave superconductors. Here we investigate this mechanism in fully gapped d+is and d+id superconductors. We find the surprising result that while stable MZMs are found in large parts of the phase diagram, strongly enhanced d-wave pairing or stronger skyrmion-induced spin twisting can in fact destroy topology unlike in s-wave superconductors. This effect can be understood from the non-trivial spatial structure of the d-wave pairing, and mixing of odd and even angular-momentum pairing channels in a rotated frame which untwists the skyrmion texture. Our results inform the feasibility of realizing MZMs with unconventional superconductors in such heterostructures.

Title: Scaling of poroelastic coarsening and elastic arrest in crosslinked gels
Authors: Samuel A. Safran
Abstract: Recent experiments on crosslinked gels quenched from solvent-rich to solvent-poor conditions, show solvent-rich domains surrounded by gel-rich regions that coarsen followed by kinetic arrest at micron scales that persists for hours before full drainage to macroscopic equilibrium occurs on day timescales. Motivated by this, we present a general model for both coarsening and eventual arrest of pressure-driven coarsening in gels with solvent flow driven by interfacial tension of the solvent-rich domains and the gel. In gels in their viscoelastic time regime, this capillary force is dissipated by solvent transport through crosslinked polymers where the polymers develop transient elastic stresses due to solvent flow. At longer times, the long-ranged, elastic response of the gel provides a deterministic force which balances the capillary force thus arresting pressure-driven coarsening at a stiffness-dependent length. For a melt-like, polymer-rich gel, the coarsening length $\sim t^{1/4}$ where $t$ is the time, with an amplitude $ \sim G^{-1/2}$, where $G$ is the shear modulus. The arrest length in this regime also scales $\sim G^{-1/2}$. For low polymer fractions where the dominant length scale is the mesh size, the coarsening length can scale as $t^{1/3}$ varying with $G^{-1/3}$ (as does the arrest length). Our predictions for the arrest-length scaling with $\sim G^{-1/2}$ for the melt-like gel are consistent with the measurements.

Title: Chiral Polar Eu2(SeO3)2(SO4)(H2O)2: A Pathway Toward Narrow Optical Linewidths and Microsecond Lifetimes for Quantum Memory Candidates
Authors: Uchenna Chinaegbomkpa, Ebube Oyeka, Xudong Huai, Ramesh Kumar, Mingli Liang, Jakoah Brgoch, Hugo Sanabria, Thao T. Tran
Abstract: Stoichiometric materials of Eu(III) offer a promising platform for quantum memories attributable to their unique capability to display a distinctive, nondegenerate J = 0 transition, which enables precise mapping of optical quantum states into their hyperfine structure for reliable storage and retrieval on demand. However, placing Eu(III) into chiral polar structures, which are necessary for achieving narrow spectral linewidths and long optical lifetimes, is a daunting task. Here, we discover Eu2(SeO3)2(SO4)(H2O)2, a rare Eu(III) material that exhibits chiral polar symmetries encompassing both local and global structures. This unique structure is shaped by an appropriate combination of asymmetric ligands. The chirality fosters dipole-dipole interactions and J-mixing, as characterized by second-harmonic generation, photoluminescence, and magnetic susceptibility. The broken inversion symmetry is supported by the phase-matching behavior of second-harmonic generation. The J = 0 transition is observed at 578 nm with a narrow linewidth at 78 K and a microsecond-scale optical lifetime. The analysis of magnetic susceptibility data using Van Vleck theory results in an effective magnetic moment of 3.33 {\mu}B/Eu3+ and J-mixing. Heat capacity data reveal underlying phonon dynamics in the material. This study demonstrates a pathway toward realizing new stoichiometric Eu3+ compounds with potential for optically addressable quantum memory applications.

Title: Coherence Protection for Mobile Spin Qubits in Silicon
Authors: Jan A. Krzywda, Yuta Matsumoto, Maxim De Smet, Larysa Tryputen, Sander L. de Snoo, Sergey V. Amitonov, Evert van Nieuwenburg, Giordano Scappucci, Lieven M.K. Vandersypen
Abstract: Mobile spin qubit architectures promise flexible connectivity for efficient quantum error correction and relaxed device layout constraints, but their viability rests on preserving spin coherence during transport. While shuttling transforms spatial disorder into time-dependent noise, its net impact on spin coherence remains an open question. Here we demonstrate systematic noise mitigation during spin shuttling in a linear $^{28}$Si/SiGe quantum dot device. First, by passively reducing magnetic field gradients, we minimize charge-noise coupling to the spin and double the spatially averaged dephasing time $T_2^*(x_n)$ from $4.4$ to $8.5\,\mu\text{s}$. Next, we exploit motional narrowing by periodically shuttling the qubit, achieving a further enhancement in coherence time up to $T_{2}^{*,sh} = 11.5\,\mu\text{s}$. Finally, we incorporate dynamical decoupling techniques while periodically shuttling over distances exceeding $200\,\text{nm}$, reaching $T_\text{2}^{H,sh}= 32\,\mu\text{s}$. For the same setup, we demonstrate that dressed-state shuttling provides robust protection against low-frequency noise with a decay time $T_R^{\text{sh}} = 21\,\mu\text{s}$, without the overhead of pulsed control and allowing protection during one-way spin transport. By preserving coherence over timescales exceeding typical gate and readout operations, the demonstrated strategies establish mobile spin qubits as a viable solution for scalable silicon quantum processors.

Title: Adsorption of Water on Pristine Graphene: A van der Waals Density Functional Study with the vdW-C09 Approach
Authors: Aline Oliveira Santos, Bruno H. S. Mendonça, Elizane E. de Moraes
Abstract: Understanding how water interacts with graphene at the molecular level is essential for advancing nanomaterial applications in filtration, catalysis, and environmental technologies. This study establishes a quantitative baseline for assessing how structural defects, dopants, or surface functionalization may enhance water adsorption, providing insights for the rational design of graphene-based materials in water purification, sensing, and nanofluidic applications. In this work, we employed density functional theory (DFT) with the vdW-C09 functional to investigate the adsorption of a single water molecule on pristine graphene, accurately accounting for long-range dispersion forces. Three high-symmetry adsorption sites-the center of the hexagonal ring, the C-C bond, and the top site-were explored in combination with three molecular orientations: Down, H-bond, and Up configurations. The calculated adsorption energies range from -93 to -145 meV (milli-electron volts), indicating that the interaction is dominated by weak van der Waals forces characteristic of physisorption. The most stable configuration corresponds to the Down orientation above the center of the hexagonal ring, with an adsorption energy of -145 meV and an equilibrium distance of 3.27 A (angstrom), defined as the vertical separation between the oxygen atom of the water molecule and the graphene plane. These results are in close agreement with previous theoretical studies and confirm the non-reactive and hydrophobic nature of pristine graphene.

Title: A parameterised equation of state, glass transition and jamming of the hard sphere system
Authors: Hongqin Liu
Abstract: A Gamma-distribution based potential energy landscape (PEL) theory has recently been proposed for supercooled liquids and glasses. This new PEL theory introduces a singularity term in the equation of state (EoS) suitable for representing the pressure of a glassy or jammed system. Using this framework, a parameterised EoS, Z(eta J), is developed with the random-jammed-packing fraction, eta J, as an input. This EoS is capable of accurately calculating the compressibility (pressure) across the entire metastable and glassy region from eta J=0.62 to 0.66, while seamlessly passing through the stable fluid region. Two special cases (paths) are examined in detail. The first path exhibits a singularity at the random close packing eta J=eta rcp=0.64, traversing the metastable region explored by most simulations. Various thermodynamic properties calculated are compared to simulation data, showing excellent agreements. The second case addresses the first analytical EoS for the ideal glass transition in the hard sphere system. Finally, the transport properties of the hard sphere fluid are modeled using the Arrhenius law and the excess entropy scaling law. It is found that both laws fail (with slope changing) at eta=0.555, where the heat capacity peaks and the contributions of inherent structures and jamming effects begin to emerge.

Title: Stress-Induced Ferroelectricity in Hafnium Oxide Core-Shell Nanoparticles
Authors: Anna N. Morozovska, Eugene A. Eliseev, Richard (Yu)Liu, Sergei V. Kalinin, Dean R. Evans
Abstract: In contrast to hafnium oxide (HfO2) thin films, where the appearance of switchable ferroelectric polarization can be induced by strain engineering, reliable methods of ferroelectricity control are absent in HfO2 nanoparticles. Direct experimental observations of ferroelectric hysteresis and/or ferroelectric domains, and appropriate modelling of stress-induced ferroelectric states in the nanoparticles are absent too. In this work we study the influence of chemical stresses on phase diagrams and polar properties of spherical HfO2 core-shell nanoparticles using the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire free energy functional with higher powers, trilinear and biquadratic couplings of polar, antipolar and nonpolar order parameters. It appeared that the ferroelectric phase can be reentrant with respect to the size of nanoparticles, because the spontaneous polarization exists in the limited range of core radii R_c, namely R_cr^min<R_c<R_cr^max. The minimal critical radius R_cr^min is mainly determined by the size dependence of the depolarization field and correlation effects. The maximal critical radius R_cr^max is mainly determined by the size dependence of chemical stresses, which are induced by the elastic defects in the shell. Analytical expressions derived for the critical radii can be generalized for hafnium-zirconium oxide nanoparticles, providing that corresponding parameters of the free energy are known from the first principles calculations.

Title: Deformation potential driven photostriction in layered ferroelectrics
Authors: S. Puri, R. Rodriguez, C. Dansou, L. Bouric, A. Sheibani, C. Paillard, L. Bellaiche, H. Nakamura
Abstract: The coupling between electronic excitations and lattice deformation in van der Waals ferroelectrics is governed by a competition between the electron deformation potential and the inverse piezoelectric effect. While theory predicts that piezoelectric screening should drive a polar-axis contraction in monolayer group-IV monochalcogenides, we demonstrate that in multilayer SnS, the deformation potential provides the dominant contribution, driving a polar-axis expansion even within ferroelectric domains. By correlating polarization-resolved second-harmonic generation microscopy with ultrafast reflectance spectroscopy and first-principles calculations, we resolve the anisotropic lattice response and disentangle intrinsic photostrictive strain from extrinsic thin-film interference artifacts. These results establish a microscopic hierarchy of photostrictive mechanisms and position stacking-engineered SnS as a platform for ultrafast optomechanical transduction.

Title: Confinement and shear effects on the rotational diffusion of a minimal virus-inspired colloidal particle
Authors: Karen Gonzales-Flores, Ramón Castañeda-Priego, Francisco Alarcón
Abstract: The rotational diffusion of a rigid spherical body decorated with dimers in an explicit fluid environment is reported. This model acts as a simplified representation of an enveloped virus bearing peplomers immersed in a coarse-grained fluid. Using dissipative particle dynamics, we explicitly study the hydrodynamic effects on the rotational diffusion of this virus-inspired particle subjected to oscillatory shear flow and confined between two solid-like surfaces. Since the rotational response depends on the type of imposed flow, we first characterize the oscillatory shear, identifying distinct flow regimes in terms of the so-called Péclet number, $Pe$. Our findings indicate that, under confinement, the rotational diffusivity is strongly modulated by the oscillatory flow amplitude and only weakly affected by the number of peplomers, since their effect is mainly determined by their dimeric structure and associated effective size. For high $Pe$, the rotational diffusion coefficient, $D_{r}$, tends to decrease as the number of peplomers ($N_{s}$) increases, whereas at low $Pe$, rotational diffusion becomes weakly dependent on the number of peplomers. However, at intermediate values of $Pe$, the interplay between oscillatory forcing and thermal fluctuations prevents the emergence of a clear trend between $D_{r}$ and $N_{s}$. Our results provide a clear picture of how, in confined environments, the interplay between fluid flow and thermal fluctuations affects the rotational diffusion of spiked particles, thereby helping to explain how fluid conditions can modify the alignment of peplomers with their potential targets.

Title: How Far Can You Grow? Characterizing the Extrapolation Frontier of Graph Generative Models for Materials Science
Authors: Can Polat, Erchin Serpedin, Mustafa Kurban, Hasan Kurban
Abstract: Every generative model for crystalline materials harbors a critical structure size beyond which its outputs quietly become unreliable -- we call this the extrapolation frontier. Despite its direct consequences for nanomaterial design, this frontier has never been systematically measured. We introduce RADII, a radius-resolved benchmark of ${\sim}$75,000 nanoparticle structures (55-11,298 atoms) that treats radius as a continuous scaling knob to trace generation quality from in-distribution to out-of-distribution regimes under leakage-free splits. RADII provides frontier-specific diagnostics: per-radius error profiles pinpoint each architecture's scaling ceiling, surface-interior decomposition tests whether failures originate at boundaries or in bulk, and cross-metric failure sequencing reveals which aspect of structural fidelity breaks first. Benchmarking five state-of-the-art architectures, we find that: (i) all models degrade by ${\sim}13\%$ in global positional error beyond training radii, yet local bond fidelity diverges wildly across architectures -- from near-zero to over $2\times$ collapse; (ii) no two architectures share the same failure sequence, revealing the frontier as a multi-dimensional surface shaped by model family; and (iii) well-behaved models obey a power-law scaling exponent $\alpha \approx 1/3$ whose in-distribution fit accurately predicts out-of-distribution error, making their frontiers quantitatively forecastable. These findings establish output scale as a first-class evaluation axis for geometric generative models. The dataset and code are available at this https URL.

Title: Real-space topology and charge order in the Haldane-Holstein Model
Authors: Sebastião dos Anjos Sousa-Júnior, Julián Faúndez, Tarik P. Cysne, Richard T. Scalettar, Rubem Mondaini
Abstract: We study the half-filled Haldane-Holstein model, where a paradigmatic Chern insulator is coupled to fully dynamical phonons, and provide an unbiased characterization of how retarded electron-phonon interactions destabilize Chern topology. Using determinant quantum Monte Carlo, we find that increasing the coupling drives an abrupt, first-order transition from a Chern insulator to a staggered charge-density wave that acts as a dynamical sublattice (Semenoff) mass. The transition is simultaneously signaled by a nearly quantized many-body Bott index and a real-space local Chern marker constructed from the interacting Green's function, both of which collapse as the charge order parameter becomes extensive. Spectral and open-boundary calculations reveal concomitant gap closing and the loss of boundary spectral weight at the critical coupling. Despite the generic phase problem induced by broken time-reversal symmetry, we show that it remains mild in the low-frequency regime and that the average phase factor sharply tracks the CI-CDW boundary. Our results establish a concrete route by which electron-phonon coupling can trigger a discontinuous collapse of Chern topology and provide experimentally relevant signatures for correlated topological platforms.

Title: Interplay of Quantum Size Effect and Tensile Strain on Surface Morphology of Sn(100) Islands
Authors: Bing Xia, Xiaoyin Li, Hongyuan Chen, Bo Yang, Jie Cai, Stephen Paolini, Zihao Wang, Zi-Jie Yan, Hao Yang, Xiaoxue Liu, Liang Liu, Dandan Guan, Shiyong Wang, Yaoyi Li, Canhua Liu, Hao Zheng, Cui-Zu Chang, Feng Liu, Jinfeng Jia
Abstract: The quantum size effect (QSE) and strain effect are two key factors influencing the surface morphology of thin films, which can increase film surface roughness through QSE-induced thickness oscillation and strain-induced island formation, respectively. Surface roughness usually manifests in the early stages of film growth and diminishes beyond a critical thickness. In this work, we employ molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) to grow Sn(100) islands with varying thickness N on bilayer graphene-terminated 6H-SiC(0001) substrates. Scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy measurements reveal an inverse surface roughness effect that highlights the interplay of QSE and misfit strain in shaping the surface morphology of Sn(100) islands. For N =< 10, the islands exhibit flat surfaces, while for N >= 26, the island surfaces become corrugated and patterned. For the intermediate range, i.e., 12 =< N =<24, both flat and patterned surfaces coexist, with the percentage coverage of the patterned surface oscillating as a function of N. By performing density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate that the unusual surface pattern evolution in our MBE-grown Sn(100) islands is a result of the interplay between QSE-induced surface roughing and tensile strain-induced smoothening effect.

Title: Surface-State-Driven Anomalous Hall Effect in Altermagnetic MnTe Films
Authors: Ling-Jie Zhou, Zi-Jie Yan, Hongtao Rong, Yufei Zhao, Pu Xiao, Lok-Kan Lai, Zhiyuan Xi, Ke Wang, Tibendra Adhikari, Ganesh P. Tiwari, Zhong Lin, Pascal Manue, Fabio Orlandi, Dmitry Khalyavin, Alexander J. Grutter, Chao-Xing Liu, Binghai Yan, Cui-Zu Chang
Abstract: Altermagnets have recently emerged as a new class of magnetic materials that combine compensated magnetic order with spin-split electronic band structures. In this work, we employ molecular beam epitaxy to grow MnTe thin films with controlled thickness on InP(111)A substrates. By performing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements, we observe a large spin splitting of ~230 meV for bulk bands well below the Fermi level and identify surface states that cross the Fermi level. Electrical transport measurements reveal that a robust anomalous Hall (AH) effect persists down to 2 K and an AH sign reversal occurs near 175 K. By systematically tuning film thickness, growth conditions, and interfacial structure, we demonstrate that the AH response in MnTe films originates from the Berry curvature of surface states rather than from bulk bands. Our first-principles calculations reveal that this surface-state-driven AH effect is imprinted by the bulk altermagnetic order and remains unchanged for terminations with opposite Mn magnetic orientations. Our results establish a unique surface transport probe of bulk altermagnetism, demonstrate interface engineering as an effective route to generate and control the AH effect in altermagnets, and provide a unified understanding of the AH response in altermagentic MnTe films.

Title: Induction of p-wave and d-wave order parameters in s-wave superconductors with light pulses
Authors: Hennadii Yerzhakov, Alexander Balatsky
Abstract: We construct a generalized time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau model to demonstrate the possibility of inducing p- and d-wave components in an originally pure s-wave centrosymmetric superconductor via microwave radiation. In this framework, specializing to $O_h$ point-group symmetry, we introduce gradient terms that couple the s-wave superconducting order parameter with other symmetry-allowed components. The singlet-to-singlet gradient terms are quadratic in spatial derivatives, while, in the presence of spin-orbit coupling, linear-in-derivatives terms coupling singlet and triplet order parameters are also permitted. Through the minimal substitution procedure, these terms enable coupling between different superconducting order parameters via the vector potential, thereby leading to the generation of p-wave, d-wave, and other symmetry-allowed components. Such a manipulation of the superconducting state locally via a microwave beam could be considered as one more facet of the concept of quantum printing.

Title: Three-dimensional real-space electron dynamics in graphene driven by strong laser fields
Authors: S. Li, M. Tani, A. Hashmi, K. L. Ishikawa
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the three-dimensional (3D) electron dynamics of graphene in real space under strong laser fields using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). We successfully reproduce the reversal of current direction originating from the cancellation of two oppositely directed residual currents, as previously predicted by Morimoto et al. [Y. Morimoto et al., New J. Phys. 24, 033051 (2022)]. By distinguishing contributions from individual orbitals, our results validate the two-level system approximation and also emphasize that the first-principles approach agrees better with experimental results for light-driven residual current, especially in extremely strong fields. Furthermore, our 3D model reveals that the real-space atomic-scale current induced by strong laser fields is concentrated slightly above and below the graphene basal plane, rather than strictly within it. The two oppositely directed currents exhibit a pronounced height separation in the out-of-plane direction, indicating that the ring current is not confined to the graphene plane but forms a rotating 3D circulation loop which is absent in the reduced-dimensional model.

Title: Nodal-Surface and Flat-Band Driven Large Anomalous Nernst Effect in Epitaxial Ferromagnetic Weyl Metal Fe5Si3
Authors: Shubhashish Pati, Sonali Srotaswini Pradhan, Nanhe Kumar Gupta, Abhay Pandey, Nikita Sharma, Nakul Kumar, Saurav Singh, Yuya Sakuraba, V. Kanchana, Sujeet Chaudhary
Abstract: Magnetic topological materials such as Weyl and Dirac magnets exhibit unconventional electronic properties arising from the interplay between magnetic order and band topology, leading to remarkable thermomagnetic and thermoelectric effects. Here, we investigate the ANE in epitaxial thin films of the Weyl ferromagnet candidate Fe5Si3. A pronounced transverse Nernst response exceeding approximately 1.50 microvolt per kelvin is observed at room temperature, together with a giant anomalous Nernst angle of about 0.56, indicating highly efficient conversion between thermal gradients and transverse electric fields. Beyond the anomalous contribution, a sizable topological Nernst signal of approximately 0.43 microvolt per kelvin persists above room temperature, suggesting the possible presence of real-space Berry curvature associated with nontrivial spin textures. First-principles density functional theory calculations combined with symmetry analysis reveal an unconventional electronic structure in which Weyl nodal lines, nodal surfaces, and nearly flat bands coexist near the Fermi level. This rare concurrence of multiple topological band features produces a strongly enhanced and sharply energy-dependent Berry curvature, which governs both the magnitude and temperature evolution of the observed Nernst response. The close quantitative agreement between calculated anomalous Nernst conductivity and experimental results establishes the topological electronic structure as the dominant origin of the observed thermomagnetic transport, highlighting Fe5Si3 as a chemically simple, low-cost binary topological magnet for exploring both real-space and momentum-space Berry-curvature-driven thermoelectric phenomena.

Title: Realistic tight-binding model for V2Se2O-family altermagnets
Authors: Xingkai Cheng, Yifan Gao, Junjie Pengand Junwei Liu
Abstract: Following earlier theoretical prediction, intercalated V2Se2O-family altermagnets such as RbV2Te2O and KV2Se2O have now been experimentally confirmed as d-wave altermagnets, representing the only known van der Waals layered altermagnetic systems. By combining crystal-symmetry-paired spin-momentum locking (CSML) with the layered structure, the V2Se2O-family offers a suitable platform for studying low-dimensional spintronic responses and exploring the interplay among multiple quantum degrees of freedom. To establish a concrete theoretical foundation for understanding and utilizing these materials, we investigate six representative members of the V2Se2O-family and construct a realistic tight-binding model parameterized by first-principles calculations, which is benchmarked by experimental measurements. This model accurately captures essential altermagnetic electronic properties, including CSML and noncollinear spin-conserved currents. It further incorporates strain-coupling parameters, enabling the simulation of strain-tunable responses such as the piezo-Hall effects. This realistic model allows systematic exploration of multiple degrees of freedom (like spin, valley, and layer) within a single system, and lays the groundwork for understanding their coupling with other quantum materials, such as topological insulators and superconductors, thereby advancing both the fundamental understanding and potential device applications of this novel class of layered altermagnets.

Title: Field-Dependent Qubit Flux Noise Simulated from Materials-Specific Disordered Exchange Interactions Between Paramagnetic Adsorbates
Authors: Keith G. Ray, Yaniv Rosen, Jonathan L Dubois, Vincenzo Lordi
Abstract: Superconducting quantum devices, from qubits and magnetometers to dark matter detectors, are influenced by magnetic flux noise originating from paramagnetic surface defects and impurities. These spin systems can feature complex dynamics, including a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition, that depend on the lattice, interactions, external fields, and disorder. However, the disorder included in typical models is not materials-specific, diminishing the ability to accurately capture measured flux noise phenomena. We present a first principles-based simulation of a spin lattice consisting of paramagnetic O$_2$ molecules on an Al$_2$O$_3$ surface, a likely flux noise source in superconducting qubits, to elucidate opportunities to mitigate flux noise. We simulate an ensemble of surface adsorbates with disordered orientations and calculate the orientation-dependent exchange couplings using density functional theory. Thus, our spin simulation has no free parameters or assumed functional form of the disorder, and captures correlation in the defect landscape that would appear in real systems. We calculate a range of exchange interactions between electron pairs, with the smallest values, 0.016 meV and -0.023 meV, being in the range required to act as a two-level system and couple to GHz resonators. We calculate the flux noise frequency, temperature, and applied external magnetic field dependence, as well as the susceptibility-flux noise cross-correlation. Calculated trends agree with experiment, demonstrating that a surface harboring paramagnetic adsorbates arranged with materials-specific disorder and interactions captures the various properties of magnetic flux noise observed in superconducting circuits. In addition, we find that an external electric field can tune the spin-spin interaction strength and reduce magnetic flux noise.

Abstract: Non-collinear Kagome antiferromagnets (AFMs) Mn3X (X = Sn, Ga, Ge, Ir, Pt) can generate an anomalous Hall effect (AHE) despite vanishing net magnetization, enabled by broken time-reversal and inversion symmetries. However, strong in-plane anisotropy has limited studies of the AFM-AHE and electronic applications to coplanar spin configurations. Non-coplanar spin textures in these systems have been realized only in low temperature spin-glass states or at interfaces with heavy metals. Here, we report an intrinsic non-coplanar spin configuration persisting up to 400 K in cubic-phase Mn3Ge, originating from coexisting symmetric and antisymmetric exchange interactions. Competing magnetic states associated with this non-coplanar spin configuration give rise to an unconventional AHE with a magnetic-field-induced sign reversal and a hump-like feature. Our findings establish a platform for non-coplanar magnetism in AFM spintronics.

Title: Finite integration time can shift optimal sensitivity away from criticality
Authors: Sahel Azizpour, Viola Priesemann, Johannes Zierenberg, Anna Levina
Abstract: Sensitivity to small changes in the environment is crucial for many real-world tasks, enabling living and artificial systems to make correct behavioral decisions. It has been shown that such sensitivity is maximized when a system operates near the critical point of a phase transition. However, proximity to criticality introduces large fluctuations and diverging timescales. Hence, to leverage the maximal sensitivity, it would require impractically long integration periods. Here, we analytically and computationally demonstrate how the optimal tuning of a recurrent neural network is determined given a finite integration time. Rather than maximizing the theoretically available sensitivity, we find networks attain different sensitivities depending on the available time. Consequently, the optimal dynamic regime can shift away from criticality when integration times are finite, highlighting the necessity of incorporating finite-time considerations into studies of information processing.

Title: Origin of Moiré Potentials in WS$_2$/WSe$_2$ Heterobilayers: Contributions from Lattice Reconstruction and Interlayer Charge Transfer
Authors: Youwen Wang, Nanya Gao, Qingjun Tong
Abstract: Moiré superlattices formed in WS$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterobilayers have emerged as an exciting platform to explore the quantum many-body physics. The key mechanism is the introduction of moiré potentials for the band-edge carriers induced by the lateral modulation of interlayer interactions. This trapping potential results in the formation of flat bands, which enhances the strong correlation effect. However, a full understanding of the origin of this intriguing potential remains elusive. In this paper, we present a comprehensive investigation of the origin of moiré potentials in both R-type and H-type moiré patterns formed in WS$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterobilayers. We show that both lattice reconstruction and interlayer charge transfer contribute significantly to the formation of moiré potentials. In particular, the lattice reconstruction induces a nonuniform local strain, which creates an energy modulation of 200 meV for the conduction band-edge state located at WS$_2$ layer and 20 meV for the valence band-edge state located at WSe$_2$ layer. In addition, the lattice reconstruction also introduces a piezopotential energy, whose amplitude ranges from 40 meV to 90 meV depending on the stacking and band-edge carrier. The interlayer charge transfer induces a built-in electric field, resulting in an energy modulation of 80 meV for an R-type moiré and 40 meV for an H-type moiré. Taking into account both effects from lattice reconstruction and interlayer charge transfer, the formation of moiré potential is well understood for both R-type and H-type moirés. This trapping potential localizes the wavefunctions of conduction and valence bands around the same moiré site for an R-type moiré, while around different moiré site for an H-type one.

Title: Interaction-driven spin polaron in itinerant flat-band ferromagnetism
Authors: Wei-Tao Zhou, Zhao-Yang Dong, Jian-Xin Li
Abstract: Interaction effects are dramatically enhanced in flat-band systems due to quenched kinetics, facilitating the binding of single excitations into composite quasiparticles. In this work, we present a comprehensive study of spin polarons over the entire momentum and energy space within the Mielke-Tasaki model using projected exact diagonalization. We identify distinct low-energy spin polarons at momenta q=0 and q=\pi, and also find multiple high-energy branches of spin polaron. It is demonstrated that the interaction-induced Hartree dispersion plays a decisive role in determining the momentum sector of low-energy spin polarons. Furthermore, by introducing a finite bandwidth, we unravel the underlying binding mechanisms: the formation of low-energy spin polarons is governed by the conventional virtual exchange mechanism, whereas the high-energy spin polarons arise from a joint effect of the effective attraction and virtual exchange. Our results suggest promising avenues for realizing spin polaron crystals and exploring novel superconducting pairing mechanisms in moiré materials like twisted WSe2 and MoTe2.

Title: Scattering theory of spin waves by lattice dislocation defects
Authors: Cristobal Larronde, Ignacio Castro, Alvaro S. Nunez, Roberto E. Troncoso, Nicolas Vidal-Silva
Abstract: We investigate spin-wave propagation in magnetic insulators in the presence of lattice dislocations. Within a continuum magnetoelastic framework, we show that the strain fields generated by dislocations induce equilibrium magnetic textures. The morphology of these textures depends sensitively on the dislocation type and acts as a localized scattering potential for spin-wave excitations. As a result, the scattering response exhibits pronounced asymmetries and interference effects governed by the magnetoelastic coupling and the dislocation type. By combining numerical simulations with analytical scattering theory, we compute differential cross sections and frequency-dependent transmission coefficients. Furthermore, analysis of the effective potential landscape reveals that the defect forms a barrier that modulates spin-wave transport and, crucially, breaks the intrinsic reflectionless nature of magnetic domain walls. Our findings identify lattice dislocations as tunable scattering centers, opening new avenues for defect engineering in magnonic devices.

Title: Chiralometer: Direct Torque Detection of Crystal Chirality
Authors: Nikolai Peshcherenko, Ning Mao, Claudia Felser, Yang Zhang
Abstract: Chirality governs phenomena ranging from chemical reactions to the topology of quasiparticle charge carriers. However, a direct macroscopic probe for crystal chirality remains a significant challenge, especially in time reversal symmetric systems with weak circular dichroism signal. Here, we propose the ``Chiralometer'', a mechanical detection method that probes chirality by driving angular momentum carriers out of equilibrium. Using first-principles calculations and semiclassical transport theory, we demonstrate that a temperature gradient in insulators or an electric field in metals induces uncompensated angular momentum in phonons and electrons, respectively. This imbalance generates a macroscopic mechanical torque ($\tau \sim 10^{-11} N \cdot m$) well within the sensitivity of modern torque magnetometry and cantilever-based sensors. We identify robust signatures in chiral crystals such as Te, SiO$_2$, and the topological semimetal CoSi. Our work establishes mechanical torque as a fundamental order parameter for chirality, offering a transformative tool for orbitronics and chiral quantum materials.

Title: Modeling bacterial flow field with regularized singularities
Authors: Yaochen Yang, Daiki Matsunaga, Da Wei, Fanlong Meng
Abstract: The flow field generated by a swimming bacterium serves as a fundamental building block for understanding hydrodynamic interactions between bacteria. Although the flow field generated by a force dipole (stresslet) well captures the fluid motion in the far field limit, the stresslet description does not work in the near-field limit, which can be important in microswimmer interactions. Here we propose the model combining an anisotropically regularized stresslet with an isotropically regularized source dipole, and it nicely reproduces the flow field around a swimming bacterium, which is validated by the experimental measurements of the flow field around \textit{E. coli} and our boundary-element-method simulations of a helical microswimmer, in both cases of the free space and the confined space with a no-slip wall. This work provides a practical tool for obtaining the flow field of the bacterium, and can be utilised to study the collective responses of bacteria in dense suspensions.

Title: Optical conductivity signatures of strong correlations and multiband superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelates
Authors: Woo Jin Kim, Kyuho Lee, Eun Kyo Ko, Jaeseok Son, Yonghun Lee, Yijun Yu, Soon Jae Moon, Tae Won Noh, Harold Y. Hwang
Abstract: Since the discovery of superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelates, there have been extensive efforts to unravel their electronic structure and pairing mechanism. In particular, understanding how the electronic structure evolves with doping is essential for clarifying theoretical models of superconductivity in nickelates. Here we present studies of the optical conductivity of Nd1-xSrxNiO2 thin films spanning the full phase diagram 0.025 < x < 0.30 using spectroscopic ellipsometry. The data are consistent with a two-band Drude model, which allows the decomposition of the intraband response into distinct contributions. One is from a "narrow" Drude term which we associate with electron bands, and the other a "broad" Drude term linked to the hole band with strong correlations. Increasing Sr doping leads to an expansion of the hole band spectral weight, and a corresponding reduction in the electron band, indicative of the multiband electronic structure and a doping-dependent reconstruction of the Fermi surface. Both doping and temperature-dependent optical spectra display significant spectral weight transfer from high to low energy, a hallmark of strong electronic correlations. In the superconducting state at optimal doping (x = 0.15), both electron and hole bands contribute to the superconducting condensate, signifying multiband superconductivity.

Title: Topological constraints suppress shear localization in granular chain ensembles
Authors: Palash Sarate, Mohd. Ilyas Bhat, Tejas G. Murthy, Prerna Sharma
Abstract: Entangled granular systems exhibit mechanical rigidity and resistance to deformation, reminiscent of cohesive materials, due to their reduced degrees of freedom and contact friction. A quantitative understanding of how classical granular phenomena, such as shear localization and plastic flow, appear in such geometrically cohesive systems remains unknown. Here, we investigate this using granular chain ensembles subjected to direct shear tests. Our experiments reveal that chains longer than four beads exhibit pronounced shear hardening, which is nearly independent of the applied normal stress and is accompanied by the complete suppression of shear localization. The volume dilation of the long chain ensembles also does not vanish in the steady state. We complement this phenomenology, which is distinct from that of typical frictional granular ensembles, with DEM simulations. The simulations reveal that tensile forces are generated due to particles being locally jammed, characterized by a high non-covalent coordination number. Consequently, this leads to a deformation that shows a very diffuse region of localization and enhanced shear hardening. Overall, our study highlights that granular chains provide a systematic route to map how connectivity constraints impact flow properties and mechanical rigidity.

Title: Dynamic Bidirectional Coupling of Membrane Morphology and Rod Organization in Flexible Vesicles
Authors: Stijn van der Ham, André F. V. Matias, Marjolein Dijkstra, Hanumantha Rao Vutukuri
Abstract: The ordering of rod-like particles in soft, deformable containers emerges from the interplay of anisotropic interactions, geometric confinement, and boundary compliance. This competition couples internal particle organization to container morphology and is central to biological processes such as cell motility, division, and encapsulation, in which cytoskeletal filaments confined by lipid membranes actively reshape cells. Using a minimal model combining experiments and simulations of colloidal rods encapsulated in lipid vesicles, we show that soft confinement drives a bidirectional coupling between internal order and vesicle shape. This interplay gives rise to a phase diagram in which elongated vesicles promote nematic alignment at lower packing fractions, whereas higher packing fractions induce smectic-like ordering that reshapes vesicles into plate-like morphologies with increased bending energy. Furthermore, by controlling vesicle volume and membrane area, we demonstrate that these boundary conditions enable reversible tuning of both vesicle shape and internal rod organization. This study establishes a promising route for dynamically controlling colloidal self-assembly in soft containers and for mimicking ordering in cell-like compartments.

Title: Understanding critical currents in super-conducting cuprate tapes
Authors: Charles Simon
Abstract: One of the key challenges in the fabrication of superconducting coils using cuprate tapes is understanding their critical currents and their dependence on magnetic field, temperature, and angle. Recent discussions at the Magnet Technology Conference (MT29) in Boston (2025) highlighted the need for standardized characterization of these tapes. Without a shared understanding of the physical phenomena governing critical currents, progress in this area remains difficult. We propose to analyze existing data using a model that explains most observed features. Although the model proposed by P. Mathieu and Y. Simon was published 20 years ago, it remains relatively unknown among engineers in the field, despite many physicists being convinced of its validity, a consensus not reflected in the literature. The Mathieu Simon (MS) model emphasizes the importance of surface pinning mechanisms, which dominate critical currents across the entire phase diagram of YBaCuO. Unlike strong and weak pinning mechanisms, which are commonly assumed to be dominant, the MS model accurately predicts the order of magnitude of experimentally measured values, suggesting it should at least be considered as the dominant mechanism. The results of calculations based on this model are presented and compared with experimental data, offering directions for the development of new materials.

Title: Cavity control of multiferroic order in single-layer NiI$_2$
Authors: Chongxiao Fan, Emil Viñas Boström, Xinle Cheng, Lukas Grunwald, Zhuquan Zhang, Dante M. Kennes, Dmitri N. Basov, Angel Rubio
Abstract: Controlling materials through their interactions with electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations is an emergent frontier in material engineering. Although recent experiments have demonstrated dark cavity effects for electronic material phases, like superconductivity, ferroelectricity and charge density waves, a smoking gun experiment for magnetic systems is lacking. Largely, this comes from the focus on phase transitions, where a large critical light-matter coupling is needed to observe cavity modifications. Here, we propose spiral magnets, where even a small cavity-mediated change in magnetic interactions is reflected in a change of the spiral wavelength, as a promising platform to observe cavity effects. We focus on the single-layer multiferroic NiI$_2$, interacting with electric field fluctuations from surface phonon polaritons of the paraelectric substrate SrTiO$_3$. With decreasing substrate-material distance, the ratio of nearest and third nearest neighbor exchange interactions reduces, leading to an increase of the spiral wavelength and an eventual transition into a ferromagnetic state. Our work identifies a realistic platform to observe cavity vacuum renormalization effects in magnetic systems.

Title: Pressure-induced superconductivity beyond magnetic quantum criticality in a Kondo ferromagnet
Authors: Yanan Zhang, Yongjun Zhang, Jiawen Zhang, Kaixin Ye, Dajun Su, Yanen Huang, Zhaoyang Shan, Jiyuan Li, Rui Li, Ye Chen, Xin Lu, Lin Jiao, Yu Liu, Michael Smidman, Frank Steglich, Huiqiu Yuan
Abstract: Quantum phase transitions are an established setting for emergent phenomena driven by strong electronic correlations, including strange metals and unconventional superconductivity. These have been explored extensively in Kondo lattice materials tuned to an antiferromagnetic quantum critical point (QCP), but superconductivity emerging near ferromagnetic quantum criticality is not yet observed, and the conditions under which it occurs in proximity to ferromagnetism are undetermined. Here, we report a new setting for superconductivity in the ferromagnetic Kondo-lattice material Ce5CoGe2, where there is a ferromagnetic ground state at ambient pressure, which evolves to antiferromagnetism under applied pressures. The antiferromagnetic transition is suppressed to a zero-temperature QCP, which is accompanied by strange-metal behavior. Superconductivity does not occur at the QCP, but instead appears at pressures beyond the magnetic instability. These findings suggest that Ce5CoGe2 represents a distinct class of correlated materials exhibiting a unique scenario for the emergence of superconductivity, likely associated with unconventional pairing mechanisms beyond spin-fluctuations.

Title: Direct Visualization of Room-temperature Stair-stepped Quantum Spin Hall States in Bi4Br4
Authors: Zhiqiang Hu, Yuqi Zhang, Yuyang Wang, Kebin Xiao, Xiang Li, Zhiwei Wang, Huaixin Yang, Yugui Yao, Qi-Kun Xue, Wei Li
Abstract: Topological insulators host exotic quantum phenomena such as the quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect, which enables dissipationless one-dimensional edge conduction. Realizing such states at room temperature and on a macroscopic scale is essential for energy-efficient electronics and quantum technologies, yet remains a fundamental challenge due to material limitations. Here, using microwave impedance microscopy, we directly visualize robust QSH states persisting up to 300 K in {\alpha}-Bi4Br4 nanowires. This stability and scalability are enabled by a stair stepped stacking configuration, a multilayer geometry in which QSH edge states from individual layers remain spatially decoupled. This configuration circumvents the stringent alignment and layer number constraints of previous proposals, allowing robust stair-stepped QSH (SS-QSH) conduction in structures several micrometers long and hundreds of nanometers high. Magnetic field and temperature dependent measurements confirm their intrinsic topological nature. Crucially, the SS-QSH and bulk signals scale with nanowire height, verifying the stair stepped origin. Our results are also successfully reproduced by finite-element analysis simulations. This work establishes {\alpha} Bi4Br4 as a practical platform for high temperature topological electronics and demonstrates a generalizable stacking strategy for designing scalable QSH systems.

Title: Toroidal Confinement and Beyond: Vorticity-Defined Morphologies of Dipolar $^{164}$Dy Quantum Droplets
Authors: S. Sanjay, S. Saravana Veni, Boris A. Malomed
Abstract: We investigate the formation, stability, and dynamics of 3D ring-shaped and multipole vortical quantum droplets (QDs) in non-rotating dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates held in a toroidal trapping potential. The QD dynamics are investigated in the framework of the extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation, which includes long-range dipole-dipole interactions (DDI) and the beyond-mean-field Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) term, revealing the emergence of self-bound states. Stable stationary solutions for multipole QDs with different values of the topological charge (vorticity $S$) are shaped as necklace-like modes, with the number of \textquotedblleft beads" (multipole's order) $n=2S$, up to $S=6$. The stability area of the multipoles shrinks with the increase of $S$. For higher values of $S$ the centrifugal effect associated with the phase winding destabilizes the annular density and drives the formation of fragmented multipole droplet states. The dependence of the chemical potential, total energy and peak density on the norm (number of particles) and $S$ is produced. These findings uncover the stabilizing effect of the LHY correction and DDI anisotropy in maintaining complex QD states in the non-rotating configurations.

Title: High Photovoltaic Efficiency in Bulk-Stacked One-Dimensional GeSe$_{2}$ van der Waals Crystal
Authors: Seoung-Hun Kang, Youngjae Kim, Bo Gyu Jang, Sejoong Kim
Abstract: Germanium diselenide (GeSe$_{2}$) has recently attracted substantial interest as a rare example of one-dimensional (1D) van der Waals material. Here, we investigate the photovoltaic potential of bulk-stacked GeSe$_{2}$ chains using first-principles calculations within the $GW0$ approximation and the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) to capture quasiparticle and excitonic effects. The bulk GeSe$_{2}$ exhibits indirect GW band gaps of 1.92 eV (type-I) and 1.08 eV (type-II). Optical calculations show markedly stronger visible-light absorption in type-II, yielding a spectroscopically limited maximum efficiency (SLME) of ~25.6% at a 0.5 $\mu$m thickness. Phonon and room-temperature ab initio molecular dynamics analyses indicate that type-II is dynamically stable, whereas type-I shows imaginary phonon modes, suggesting a propensity for structural distortion. These results identify type-II GeSe2 as a promising stable absorber for thin-film photovoltaics with enhanced flexibility compared to typical 2D vdW systems.

Title: Microstructural origin of the simultaneous enhancements in strength and ductility of a nitrogen-doped high-entropy alloy
Authors: Xiaoxiang Wu, Zhujun Sun, Wenqi Guo, Chang Liu, Yong-Qiang Yan, Yan-Ning Zhang, Yuji Ikeda, Fritz Körmann, Jörg Neugebauer, Zhiming Li, Baptiste Gault, Ge Wu
Abstract: As one of the most abundant interstitial elements, nitrogen (N) is effective in improving yield strength of metallic materials, due to interstitial solid solution strengthening. Doping N can substantially enhance the yield strength but often leads to a decreased ductility, revealing a strength-ductility trade-off phenomenon. Here, we simultaneously enhance the strength and ductility in a non-equiatomic CrMnFeCoNi high-entropy alloy via N alloying and unravel the underlying microscopic mechanisms. The N-doped alloy (1 at.% N) shows an excellent combination of higher yield strength (104% increase) and larger ductility (38% increase), with a two-stage strain hardening behavior, compared to the N-free alloy. Detailed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis reveals that N-doping introduces short-range order (SRO) domains within the microstructure, leads to pronounced planar slip, and promotes the formation of nano-spaced (6-15 nm) stacking faults and deformation twins. Continuous generation and interaction of the fine-spaced SFs act as a strong barrier for dislocation movement and provide ample room for dislocation storage. The interaction of SRO with dislocations and the evolution of SFs ascribe to the first strain hardening stage, and the disordering of the SRO along with the activation of deformation twins are attributed to the second strain hardening stage. Our work shows that N-doping is effective in simultaneously improving the strength-ductility synergy and provides novel insights into alloy design with slightly elevating the SFE, and manipulating the ordered structure within the HEA.

Title: Raman Spectroscopic Investigation of Kitaev Quantum Spin Liquids
Authors: Vivek Kumar, Pradeep Kumar
Abstract: Quantum spin liquids, a highly topologically entangled, dynamically correlated state where quantum fluctuations preclude any long-range ordering down to absolute zero. In the search for a topologically robust qubit, the scientific community has been in continuous hunt for real quantum spin liquid systems. Alexei Kitaev in his exactly solvable model for a spin-1/2 two-dimensional honeycomb lattice, presented a system that hosts a topologically protected state (Majorana zero-modes). Under an applied external field, the Kitaev spin liquids turn into a topologically non-trivial chiral spin-liquid state with non-abelian anionic excitations, which is crucial for quantum computing. Earlier theoretical predictions advocated that Kitaev physics can be realized in spin-orbit-coupled Mott insulators such as honeycomb irradiates and ruthenates. However, the experimental findings continuously challenge the theoretical aspects, indicating the presence of non-Kitaev interactions in real materials, where the dimensionality, disorder (vacancy), chemical composition, generalized spin-S, and external perturbations (pressure, magnetic field, temperature) can actively tune the Kitaev interactions and the ground state excitations. In this review article, a comprehensive discussion is included with an updated literature survey in the context of the potential of Raman spectroscopy as a probe for Kitaev quantum spin liquids.

Title: Pressure dependent topological, superconducting, optoelectronic and thermophysical properties of Ta2Se chalcogenide: Theoretical insights
Authors: Tauhidur Rahman, Jubair Hossan Abir, Sourav Kumar Sutradhar, Sraboni Saha Moly, Mst. Maskura Khatun, Md. Asif Afzal, Saleh Hasan Naqib
Abstract: Tetragonal Ta2Se is a layered, Ta-rich chalcogenide that departs from conventional MX2 transition-metal dichalcogenides by hosting dense Ta-Ta networks capped by Se square-net layers. Here, we present a unified first-principles investigation of hydrostatic-pressure tuning in Ta2Se from 0 to 10 GPa, connecting the structural response, mechanical stability, thermophysical indicators, bonding evolution, electronic and optical behavior, lattice dynamics and superconductivity within a single framework. The derived thermophysical descriptors corroborate a pressure-stiffened lattice: density increases, Debye temperature rises, melting temperature is elevated and minimum thermal conductivity increases, whereas the Grüneisen parameter remains within a narrow window, suggesting no anomalous anharmonic softening. Bond population metrics and electron-density-difference analysis revealed a mixed metallic-covalent bonding picture dominated by a robust Ta-Ta metallic backbone, accompanied by pressure-strengthened Ta-Se hybridization. Electronic-structure calculations show persistent metallicity under compression; pressure broadens bands, reduces density of states at the Fermi level, reshapes the Fermi surface and points to a possible Lifshitz-type reconstruction without symmetry breaking. The optical response remained metallic with Drude-like low-energy behavior and pressure-tunable spectral features. The phonon dispersions exhibit no imaginary modes, confirming dynamical stability. Electron-phonon coupling calculations classify Ta2Se as a weak-coupling, phonon-mediated superconductor with Tc around 3.9 K, consistent with available experiments and establish pressure as a practical control knob for stability and superconductivity-relevant descriptors in this metal-rich layered platform.

Title: How Geometry Tames Disorder in Lattice Fracture
Authors: Matthaios Chouzouris, Leo de Waal, Antoine Sanner, Alessandra Lingua, David S. Kammer, Marcelo A. Dias
Abstract: We investigate the fracture behavior of pre-cracked triangular beam-lattices whose elements have failure stresses drawn from a Weibull distribution. Through a statistical analysis and numerical simulations, we identify and verify the existence of three distinct failure regimes: (i) disorder is effectively suppressed, (ii) disorder manifests locally near the crack tip, modifying the crack morphology, and (iii) disorder manifests globally, leading to initially diffuse failure. Our model naturally reveals the key parameters governing this behavior: the Weibull modulus, quantifying the spread in failure thresholds, and a geometric quantity termed the Slenderness Ratio. We also reproduce the disorder-induced toughening reported in previous experimental and numerical studies, further demonstrating that its manifestation depends non-monotonically on disorder. Crucially, our results indicate that this toughening cannot be simply connected to the amount of damage in the lattice, challenging interpretations that attribute increased fracture energy solely to enhanced crack tortuosity or diffuse failure. Overall, our results establish geometry as a powerful control parameter for regulating how disorder is expressed during fracture in beam-lattices, with broader implications for the disorder-induced toughening in engineered materials.

Title: High-Harmonic Spin and Charge Pumping in Altermagnets
Authors: Ousmane Ly
Abstract: We report the emergence of highly nonlinear spin and charge pumping in an altermagnetic system driven by magnetic dynamics. The nonrelativistic spin-momentum coupling inherent to altermagnets generates a giant momentum dependent spin splitting, leading to strong spin-flip scattering in the presence of a precessing magnetic order driving the altermagnetic system out of equilibrium. Our simulations reveal the emission of hundreds of harmonics under realistic conditions, with amplitudes far exceeding those obtained in light-driven schemes. Notably, in contrast to ferromagnetic and conventional antiferromagnetic systems, where nonlinear emission typically requires additional spin-orbit coupling, altermagnets intrinsically support high-harmonic spin and charge pumping. These results identify altermagnetic systems as a promising platform for efficient THz emitters and highly nonlinear spintronic devices.

Title: MoireStudio: A Universal Twisted Electronic Structure Calculation Package
Authors: Junxi Yu, Yichen Liu, Cheng-Cheng Liu
Abstract: Twistronics is an emerging and captivating field in condensed matter physics and material science. However, accurately and efficiently calculating the electronic structures of twisted systems remains a significant challenge. To address this, we have developed MoireStudio, a universal Python-based computational package for twisted electronic structures. Its functionalities include commensurate structure search, structure generation, parameterization, and construction for tight-binding models and continuum models, and the precise incorporation of full relaxation effects. The package is applicable to arbitrary combinations of two-dimensional materials, including rectangular lattices and heterostructures. User-friendly and easy to use, MoireStudio supports parallel large-scale computations, provides visualization capabilities, and offers interfaces with third-party software. It is poised to become a convenient and powerful tool for researchers in twistronics fields.

Title: Exceptional nodal rings emerging in spinful Rice-Mele chains
Authors: E. S. Ma, Z. Song
Abstract: The Weyl exceptional nodal lines usually occur in 3D topological semimetals, but also emerge in the parameter space of 1D systems. In this work, we study the impact of dissipation on the nodal ring in a 3D topological semimetal. We find that the energy spectrum becomes fully complex in the presence of dissipation, and the original nodal ring is split into two exceptional rings. We introduce a vortex field in the momentum space, which is generated from the spectrum, to characterize the topology of the exceptional rings. This provides a clear physical picture of the topological structure. The two exceptional rings act as two vortex filaments of a free vortex flow with opposite circulations. In this context, the 3D topological semimetal is the boundary separating two quantum phases identified by two configurations of exceptional rings. We also propose a 1D model that has the same topological feature in the parameter space. It provides a simple way to measure the topological invariant in a low-dimensional system. Numerical simulations indicate that the topological invariant is robust under the random perturbations of the system parameters.

Title: Stabilization of $α$-UH$_3$ in U-Hf Hydrides: Structural, Magnetic, Thermodynamic, and Transport Properties
Authors: Shanmukh Veera Venkata Uday Kumar Devanaboina, Oleksandra Koloskova, Silvie Maskova-Cerna, Ladislav Havela
Abstract: Hf substitution stabilizes the metastable body-centered cubic (bcc) $\alpha$-UH$3$ phase in uranium hydrides, enabling systematic measurements of its magnetic, thermodynamic, and transport properties. (UH$3$)${1-x}$Hf$x$ hydrides ($x = 0.10, 0.15, 0.30, 0.40$) were obtained by hydrogenation of U${1-x}$Hf$x$ precursor alloys. Powder X-ray diffraction shows a progressive suppression of $\beta$-UH$3$ phase with increasing $x$, with $\alpha$-UH$3$ domination at $x = 0.30$ and $\beta$-UH$3$ nearly fully suppressed at $x = 0.40$. Magnetization measurements show ferromagnetic behavior for all compositions with Curie temperatures in the range $T\mathrm{C} \approx 178$--$185$ K and a maximum near $x = 0.15$; however, the spontaneous magnetization is strongly reduced with Hf content, decreasing from $1.0,\mu\mathrm{B}$/U in pure $\beta$-UH$3$ to $0.46,\mu\mathrm{B}$/U for (UH$3$)${0.60}$Hf${0.40}$. Specific-heat data show a broadened Curie anomaly in the $\alpha$-UH$3$ rich hydride samples, consistent with a distribution of $T\mathrm{C}$ values arising from ferromagnetic inhomogeneities. Specific heat also reveals a monotonic decrease in the Sommerfeld coefficient with increasing Hf concentration, reflecting a reduction in the electronic density of states at the Fermi level, especially in (UH$3$)${0.60}$Hf${0.40}$. The resistivity of (UH$3$)${0.60}$Hf${0.40}$ is very large, exhibits a robust negative temperature coefficient over 2--300 K, and shows only weak magnetoresistance, placing transport in a strongly incoherent, disorder-dominated regime.

Title: Giant thermopower changes related to the resistivity maximum and colossal magnetoresistance in EuCd2P2
Authors: Judith Grafenhorst, Sarah Krebber, Kristin Kliemt, Cornelius Krellner, Elena Hassinger, Ulrike Stockert
Abstract: We present the thermopower of EuCd2P2, a material which exhibits a large resistivity peak with significant magnetic field dependence in the temperature range of 10-25 K. In the same region we observe a highly unusual behavior of the thermopower with two sign changes and giant extrema. The overall variation of the thermopower exceeds 4 000 muV/K and takes place in an extremely narrow temperature region of less than 5 K. The anomaly is suppressed completely in a small magnetic field of 0.5 T. We discuss this observation using a simple drift-diffusion picture and taking into account that the temperature gradient inducing the thermopower voltage is accompanied by a gradient of the electrical resistivity. Our simple estimation yields the correct magnitude, shape, and field dependence of the thermopower anomaly observed in EuCd2P2. These results open a new route to giant thermopower values via gradients of electronic properties.

Title: Metallic mean quasicrystals and their topological invariants
Authors: Anuradha Jagannathan
Abstract: Topological invariants govern many important physical properties in condensed matter systems. In this work, we obtain the complete set of topological invariants for a family of one-dimensional quasicrystals. The first and best-studied member of the family is the Fibonacci chain, while the successive ones are known in the literature as silver, bronze... and collectively as the metallic mean chains. By considering rational approximants, and by making use of the relationship between these chains and two dimensional Quantum Hall problems, we write down a gap labeling scheme for finite systems, and extend it to the quasiperiodic limit. We show, by numerical computations on open chains, that the proposed scheme correctly yields the winding numbers of edge states in each of the gaps, in all of the quasicrystals. In the strict 1D limit, we discuss properties of a simplified Hofstadter ``butterfly" diagram, with the analogues of Landau levels appearing in the asymptotic limit.

Title: Exciton fine structure in CdSe nanoplatelets using a quasi-2D screened configuration-interaction framework
Authors: Sumanti Patra, Gabriel Bester
Abstract: We compute exciton binding energies and fine-structure splittings in CdSe nanoplatelets with two zincblende geometries and one wurtzite geometry, finding that the wurtzite structure exhibits the largest bright-bright splitting due to its intrinsic in-plane anisotropy, while the zincblende structures show smaller but finite splittings arising from atomistic symmetry breaking at edges and corners. These results are obtained using a theoretical framework that we developed, which combines DFT single-particle states with screened configuration interaction, a quasi-2D dielectric screening model, and an efficient Coulomb-cutoff scheme that eliminates periodic-image interactions and enables accurate Coulomb and exchange integrals at low computational cost. This methodology provides a transferable and practical route for studying excitons in CdSe nanoplatelets and other quasi-two-dimensional nanomaterials.

Title: Multiple Layer-Selective Polar Charge Density Waves in ${\rm{EuTe}}_{4}$
Authors: Wen-Han Dong, Wenhui Duan, Yong Xu, Peizhe Tang
Abstract: ${\rm{EuTe}}_{4}$ is a polar charge density wave (CDW) material, with giant thermal hysteresis and non-volatile state switching under electric and optical fields, attracting great attention in recent years. However, the in-depth understanding of these anomalous phenomena remains elusive. Herein, via first-principles calculations, we reveal that the polar CDW state in ${\rm{EuTe}}_{4}$ hosts a novel layer-selective nature, wherein multiple energetically close CDW configurations coexist and exhibit low interconversion energy barriers. Monte Carlo simulations indicate that the giant thermal hysteresis in ${\rm{EuTe}}_{4}$ originates from a phase transition mainly driven by the change of configurational entropy, around which the material hosts a metastable CDW state characterized by diverse local polar configurations breaking the out-of-plane translational symmetry. The configurational composition of this metastable CDW state can be effectively controlled by electric and optical fields, thereby enabling non-volatile state switching. Our theoretical findings align well with recent experimental observations in ${\rm{EuTe}}_{4}$ and pave the way for exploring the emerging phenomena and applications of polar CDW in multilayered systems.

Title: Refined DFT recipe and renormalisation of band-edge parameters for electrons in monolayer MoS$_2$ informed by the measured spin-orbit splitting
Authors: Igor Rozhansky, Michele Masseroni, Ricardo Pisoni, Suad Alshammari, Xue Li, Thomas Ihn, Klaus Ensslin, James McHugh, Vladimir Fal'ko
Abstract: Conduction band-edge spin-orbit splitting (SOS) in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides determines a competition between bright and dark excitons and sets conditions for spintronics applications of these semiconductors. Here, we report the SOS measurement for electrons in monolayer MoS$_2$, found from the threshold density, $n_*$, for the upper spin-orbit-split band population, which exceeds by an order of magnitude the values expected from the conventional density functional theory (DFT). Theoretically, half of the observed value can be attributed to the exchange enhancement of SOS in a finite-density electron gas, but explaining the rest requires refining the DFT approach. As the conduction band SOS in MoS$_2$ is set by a delicate balance between the contribution of sulphur $p_x$ and $p_y$ orbitals and $d_{z^2}-d_{xz}$ and $d_{z^2}-d_{yz}$ mixing in molybdenum, we use a DFT+U+V framework for fine-tuning the orbital composition of the relevant band-edge states. An optimised choice of Hubbard U/V parameters produces close agreement with the experimentally observed conduction band SOS in MoS$_2$, simultaneously resulting in the valence-band SOS and the quasi-particle band gap which are closer to their values established in the earlier-published experiments.

Title: Logarithmically slow heat propagation in a clean Josephson-junction chain
Authors: Angelo Russomanno
Abstract: We consider a clean Josephson-junction chain coupled by one of its extremities to a thermal bath through a resistance. Considering the Langevin dynamics in the classical regime, in the case of Josephson energy much smaller than charging energy, we find that heat propagates logarithmically slowly through the system, rather than diffusively, as highlighted by the logarithmic increase in time of a thermalization length we define and by the logarithmically slow increase in time of the energy. This behavior -- typical of quantum Anderson or many-body localized systems -- is observed here also in a clean classical glassy Hamiltonian system. We argue that this phenomenon might imply strong robustness to the effect of ergodic inclusions for the nonergodic behavior in the charge-quantized regime.

Title: Disentangling orbital and confinement contributions to $g$-factor in Ge/SiGe hole quantum dots

Abstract: Spin qubits are typically operated in the lowest orbital of a quantum dot to minimize interference from nearby states. In valence-band hole systems, strong spin-orbit coupling links spin and orbital degrees of freedom, strongly influencing the hole $g$-factor, a key parameter for qubit control. We investigate the out-of-plane $g$-factor in Ge quantum dots using excitation (single-particle) and addition (many-body) spectra. Excitation spectra allow us to distinguish the pure Zeeman $g$-factor from orbital contributions to the magnetic field splitting of states despite the strong spin-orbit coupling. This distinction clarifies discrepancies between $g$-factors extracted with the two methods, for different orbital states and different hole numbers. Furthermore, we find gate-tunability of $g$-factors at the level of 15%, highlighting its relevance for all-electric qubit manipulation.

Title: The chiral random walk: A quantum-inspired framework for odd diffusion
Authors: Jan Wójcik, Erik Kalz
Abstract: Chirality in active and passive fluids gives rise to odd transport properties, most notably the emergence of robust edge currents that defy standard dissipative dynamics. While these phenomena are well-described by continuum hydrodynamics, a microscopic framework connecting them to their topological origins has remained elusive. Here, we present a lattice model for an isotropic chiral random walk that bridges the gap between classical stochastic diffusion and unitary quantum evolution. By equipping the walker with an internal degree of freedom and a tunable chirality parameter, $p$, we interpolate between a standard diffusive random walk and a deterministic, topologically non-trivial quantum walk. We show that the topological protection characteristic of the unitary limit ($p=1$) remarkably persists into the dissipative regime ($p<1$). This correspondence allows us to theoretically ground the robustness of edge flows in classical chiral systems using the bulk-boundary correspondence of Floquet topological insulators. Our results provide a discrete microscopic description for odd diffusion, offering a powerful toolkit to predict transport in confined geometries and disordered chiral media.

Title: Long-Range Machine Learning of Electron Density for Twisted Bilayer Moiré Materials
Authors: Zekun Lou, Alan M. Lewis, Mariana Rossi
Abstract: Moiré superlattices in two-dimensional (2D) materials exhibit rich quantum phenomena, but ab initio modelling of these systems remains computationally prohibitive. Existing machine learning methods for accelerating density-functional theory (DFT) can target the prediction of different quantities and often rely on the locality assumption. Here we train a Gaussian process regression SALTED model exclusively on the electron densities of small displaced bilayer structures and then extrapolate electron density prediction to the large supercells required to describe small twist angles between these bilayers. We show the necessity of long-range descriptors to yield reliable band structures and electrostatic properties of large twisted bilayer structures, when these are derived from predicted densities. We demonstrate that the choice of descriptor determines the distribution of residual density errors, which in turn affects the downstream electronic properties. We apply our models to twisted bilayer graphene, hexagonal boron nitride, and transition metal dichalcogenides, focusing on the model's capacity to predict complex phenomena, including flat band formation, bandwidth narrowing, domain-wall electric fields, and spin-orbit coupling effects. Beyond moiré materials, this approach provides a general methodology for electronic structure prediction in large-scale systems with substantial long-range phenomena related to non-local geometric information.

Title: Relativistic Effects in LaBi$_2$ Thin Films
Authors: Reiley Dorrian, Sungmin Song, Jinwoong Kim, Mizuki Ohno, Seung-Hoon Jhi, Nicholas Kioussis, Joseph Falson
Abstract: Chemical substitution in crystalline quantum materials is a powerful way to explore the consequences of strong spin-orbit coupling on their structural and electronic properties. In this work, we present an investigation of thin films of the La$\textit{Pn}_2$ ($\textit{Pn}$~=~Sb, Bi) class of layered square-net intermetallics. We report the growth of LaBi$_2$ with a pristine layer-by-layer growth mode, classifying it as a good metal displaying superconductivity at $\sim$0.55~K. Compared to LaSb$_2$, we attribute the enhanced metallic behavior and improved growth dynamics of LaBi$_2$ to significant relativistic corrections to its electronic band structure and the resulting impact on both surface energy and intrinsic phonon scattering.

Title: Ground-state phases of $S = 1/2$ Heisenberg models on the body-centered cubic lattice
Authors: Rajah P. Nutakki, Filippo Vicentini
Abstract: Simulating low-temperature properties of three-dimensional frustrated quantum magnets is challenging due to the sign problem and the system sizes required to mitigate substantial finite-size effects. However, there are many experimental examples of three-dimensional crystals that could host exotic low-temperature states of matter, such as quantum spin liquids. We calculate the ground-state phase diagrams of frustrated quantum spin models on the body-centered cubic lattice using neural quantum states. First, we study the antiferromagnetic $J_1-J_2$ model where we find a direct first-order phase transition between Néel and collinear long-range-ordered phases at $(J_2/J_1)_c = 0.705$, consistent with previous studies. Then, in a tetragonally-distorted variant, proposed as a minimal model of NaCa$_2$Cu$_2$(VO$_4$)$_3$, we find no evidence of a quantum paramagnetic ground state, with a first-order phase transition between Néel and chain phases at $(J_{2ab}/J_1)_c = 1.0375$. Therefore, the ground state of the tetragonally-distorted model does not reproduce the low-temperature magnetic properties of NaCa$_2$Cu$_2$(VO$_4$)$_3$, and the inclusion of other effects is necessary to rationalize experimental observations.

Abstract: Among the recognized sources of decoherence in superconducting qubits, the spatial inhomogeneity of the superconducting state and the possible presence of magnetic-flux vortices remain comparatively underexplored. Niobium is commonly used as a structural material in transmon qubits that host Josephson junctions, and excess dissipation anywhere in the transmon can become a bottleneck that limits overall quantum performance. The metal/substrate interfacial layer may simultaneously host pair-breaking loss channels (e.g., two-level systems, TLS) and control thermal transport, thereby affecting dissipation and temperature stability. Here, we use quantitative magneto-optical imaging of the magnetic-flux distribution to characterize the homogeneity of the superconducting state and the critical current density, $j_{c}$, in niobium films fabricated under different sputtering conditions. The imaging reveals distinct flux-penetration regimes, ranging from a nearly ideal Bean critical state to strongly nonuniform thermo-magnetic dendritic avalanches. By fitting the measured magnetic-induction profiles, we extract $j_{c}$ and correlate it with film physical properties and with measured qubit internal quality factors. Our results indicate that the Nb/Si interlayer can be a significant contributor to decoherence and should be considered an important factor that must be optimized.

Title: Multiscale Modeling of Metal/Oxide/Metal Conductive Bridging Random Access Memory Cells: from Ab Initio to Finite Element Calculations
Authors: Jan Aeschlimann, Fabian Durch, Christoph Weilenmann, Alexandros Emboras, Mathieu Luisier, Juerg Leuthold
Abstract: We present a multiscale simulation framework to compute the current vs. voltage (I-V ) characteristics of metal/oxide/metal structures building the core of conductive bridging random access memory (CBRAM) cells and to shed light on their resistance switching properties. The approach relies on a finite element model whose input material parameters are extracted either from ab initio or from machine-learned empirical calculations. The applied techniques range from molecular dynamics and nudged elastic band to electronic and thermal quantum transport. Such an approach drastically reduces the number of fitting parameters needed and makes the resulting modeling environment more accurate than traditional ones. The developed computational framework is then applied to the investigation of an Ag/a-SiO2/Pt CBRAM, reproducing experimental data very well. Moreover, the relevance of Joule heating is assessed by considering various cell geometries. It is found that self-heating manifests itself in devices with thin conductive filaments with few-nanometer diameters and at current concentrations in the 10s-microampere range. With the proposed methodology it is now possible to explore the potential of not-yet fabricated memory cells and to reliably optimize their design.

Title: Early warning signals for phase transitions in networks
Authors: A. V. Goltsev, S. N. Dorogovtsev
Abstract: The percolation phase transition in complex network systems attracts much attention and has numerous applications in various research fields. Finite size effects smooth the transition and make it difficult to predict the critical point of appearance or disappearance of the giant connected component. For this end, we introduce the susceptibility of arbitrary random undirected and directed networks and show that a strong increase of the susceptibility is the early warning signal of approaching the transition point. Our method is based on the introduction of `observers', which are randomly chosen nodes monitoring the local connectivity of a network. To demonstrate efficiency of the method, we derive explicit equations determining the susceptibility and study its critical behavior near continuous and mixed-order phase transitions in uncorrelated random undirected and directed networks, networks with dependency links, and $k$-cores of networks. The universality of the critical behavior is supported by the phenomenological Landau theory of phase transitions.

Title: PySlice: Routine Vibrational Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy Prediction with Universal Interatomic Potentials
Authors: Harrison A. Walker, Thomas W. Pfeifer, Paul M. Zeiger, Jordan A. Hachtel, Sokrates T. Pantelides, Eric R. Hoglund
Abstract: Vibrational spectroscopy in the electron microscope can reveal phonon excitations with nanometer spatial resolution, yet routine prediction remains out of reach due to fragmented workflows requiring specialized expertise. Here we introduce PySlice, the first publicly available implementation of the Time Autocorrelation of Auxiliary Wavefunction (TACAW) method, providing an automated framework that produces momentum- and energy-resolved vibrational electron energy-loss spectra directly from atomic structures. By integrating universal machine learning interatomic potentials with TACAW, PySlice eliminates the bottleneck of per-system potential development. Users input atomic structures and obtain phonon dispersions, spectral diffraction patterns, and spectrum images through a unified workflow spanning molecular dynamics, GPU-accelerated electron scattering, and frequency-domain analysis. We outline the formulation behind the code, demonstrate its application to canonical systems in materials science, and discuss its use for advanced analysis and materials exploration. The modular Python architecture additionally supports conventional electron microscopy simulations, providing a general-purpose platform for imaging and diffraction calculations. PySlice makes vibrational spectroscopy prediction routine rather than specialized, enabling computational screening for experimental design, systematic exploration of phonon physics across materials families, and high-throughput generation of simulated data for training of future machine learning models.

Title: Orbital piezomagnetic polarizability of pure insulating altermagnets in two dimensions
Authors: Beryl Bell, Jörn W. F. Venderbos
Abstract: The distinctive symmetry properties of pure altermagnets make them natural candidates for piezomagnetism. Previous work motivated by the piezomagnetic properties of altermagnets has primarily focused on the spin magnetization response to applied strain. In this paper we study orbital piezomagnetic effects--the orbital magnetization response to applied strain--in minimal lattice models of pure insulating altermagnets in two dimensions. We obtain general microscopic expressions for the orbital magnetization in the presence of strain, as well as the orbital piezomagnetic polarizability, i.e., the defining response characteristic of pure altermagnets. We apply these expressions to three specific tetragonal lattice models, two corresponding to $d$-wave altermagnets and one describing a $g$-wave altermagnet. Whereas the $d$-wave altermagnets are associated with a linear piezomagnetic polarizability, the $g$-wave altermagnet exhibits a nonlinear piezomagnetic effect. Our analysis reveals how the polarizabilities are related to and determined by the Berry curvature of the occupied bands. Connections to materials of current interest are discussed.

Title: Canonical strong coupling spin wave expansion of Kondo lattice magnets. II. Itinerant ferromagnets and topological magnon bands
Authors: M. Frakulla, J. Strockoz, D. S. Antonenko, J. W. F. Venderbos
Abstract: In this paper we apply the canonical spin wave theory developed for itinerant Kondo lattice magnets in the strong coupling regime to Kondo ferromagnets, and address two general questions pertaining to their magnetic excitations. First, we compute corrections to the strong coupling (i.e., double-exchange) spin wave dispersion of itinerant ferromagnets. We show that the spin wave dispersion beyond the strong coupling limit can be mapped to the spin wave dispersion of a Heisenberg ferromagnet with farther neighbor exchange couplings, and discuss how this affects instabilities towards antiferromagnetism. Second, we examine the effect of including electronic spin-orbit coupling in the spin wave theory of Kondo ferromagnets. Including spin-orbit coupling is natural and straightforward in the formulation of the canonical spin wave expansion. Our key result is to demonstrate that the linear spin wave Hamiltonian of the itinerant Kondo ferromagnet can be mapped to the spin wave Hamiltonian of a Heisenberg ferromagnet with easy-axis Ising anisotropy and antisymmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya exchange interaction. We show that in the case of the Kane-Mele honeycomb lattice Kondo ferromagnet this leads to topological magnon bands, and discuss the implications of this result for itinerant ferromagnets more broadly.

Title: Simulating superconductivity in mixed-dimensional $t_\parallel$-${J}_\parallel$-${J}_\perp$ bilayers with neural quantum states
Authors: Hannah Lange, Ao Chen, Antoine Georges, Fabian Grusdt, Annabelle Bohrdt, Christopher Roth
Abstract: Motivated by the recent discovery of superconductivity in the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (LNO) under pressure, we study a mixed-dimensional (mixD) bilayer $t_\parallel$-$J_\parallel$-$J_\perp$ model, which has been proposed as an effective low-energy description of LNO. Using neural quantum states (NQS), and in particular Gutzwiller-projected Hidden Fermion Pfaffian State, we access the ground-state properties on large lattices up to $8\times 8\times 2$ sites. We show that this model exhibits superconductivity across a wide range of dopings and couplings, and analyze the pairing behavior in detail. We identify a crossover from tightly bound, Bose-Einstein-condensed interlayer pairs at strong interlayer exchange to more spatially extended Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer-like pairs as the interlayer exchange is decreased. Furthermore, upon tuning the intralayer exchange, we observe a sharp transition from interlayer $s$-wave pairing to intralayer $d$-wave pairing, consistent with a first-order change in the pairing symmetry. We verify that our simulations are accurate by comparing with matrix product state simulations on coupled ladders. Our results represent the first simulation of a fermionic multi-orbital system with NQS, and provide the first evidence for superconductivity in two-dimensonal bilayers using high-precision numerics. These findings provide insight into superconductivity in bilayer nickelates and cold atom quantum simulation platforms.

Title: Topologically Protected Surface Altermagnetism on Antiferromagnets
Authors: Valentin Leeb, Peru d'Ornellas, Fernando de Juan, Adolfo G. Grushin
Abstract: Altermagnetism (AM) and its associated spin-transport phenomena are typically linked to spin-split electronic band structures in bulk materials. However, the crystal surface has a reduced symmetry with respect to the bulk, which can induce AM at the surface of conventional antiferromagnets (AFMs) -- a local effect which cannot be detected using bulk properties. In this work we define the symmetry conditions necessary for surface AM and show how it can be topologically protected, rendering it a robust effect. We provide a minimal model for one trivial and two topological examples of surface AM. We show that the spin spectral density, accessible by spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, can exhibit a $d$-wave-like altermagnetic character at the surface, even when the full band structure is completely spin degenerate. Our topological model describes the Dirac semimetal CuMnAs, which provides an existing realization of our theory. Our results identify crystal surfaces as a platform to realize robust, topology- and symmetry-driven unconventional magnetism beyond the bulk classification of magnetic materials.

Title: Model Reduction of Multivariate Geometric Brownian Motions and Localization in a Two-State Quantum System
Authors: C. Chen, M. Colangeli, M. H. Duong, M. Serva
Abstract: We develop a systematic framework for the model reduction of multivariate geometric Brownian motions (GBMs), a fundamental class of stochastic processes with broad applications in mathematical finance, population biology, and statistical physics. Our approach leverages the interplay between the method of invariant manifolds and adiabatic elimination to derive closed-form reduced equations for the deterministic drift. An extended formulation of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem is subsequently employed to characterize the stochastic component of the reduced description. As a concrete application, we apply our reduction scheme to a GBM arising from a two-state quantum system, showing that the reduced dynamics accurately capture the localization properties of the original model while significantly simplifying the analysis.

Title: A complete phase-field fracture model for brittle materials subjected to thermal shocks
Authors: Bo Zeng, John E. Dolbow
Abstract: Brittle materials subjected to thermal shocks experience strong temperature gradients that in turn give rise to mechanical stresses that can be large enough to induce fracture. This work presents a complete model for phase-field fracture for coupled thermo-mechanical problems, wherein the bulk material properties, the material strength, and the fracture toughness are specified independently. The capabilities of the model are assessed across a wide span of scenarios in thermo-mechanical fracture, from the propagation of large pre-existing cracks to crack nucleation under spatially uniform states of stress. In particular, we revisit the controlled quenching of glass plates, and demonstrate how the model captures experimentally observed crack patterns across a range of thermal loads. Ceramic disks subjected to infrared radiation are also examined, with the model reproducing both straight cracks in notched specimens and branching in intact specimens. Finally, ceramic pellets subjected to rapid power pulses are examined, with the model explaining experimental transitions from intact to fractured pellets and the important role of material strength. The results demonstrate that the complete phase-field model unifies the treatment of distinct fracture scenarios under thermal shock, surpassing classical approaches and enabling more reliable prediction of brittle fracture in extreme environments.

Title: TC/TCL and NETFD Correspondence Principles for Information Backflow: A Structural Monotonicity Theorem and Minimal Phase Diagrams
Authors: Koichi Nakagawa
Abstract: We propose a unified structural framework for information backflow in minimal non-Markovian relaxation processes. The central idea is to interpret non-Markovianity as an embedding phenomenon in which observable degrees of freedom exchange information with hidden auxiliary sectors. Our approach is based on two standard formalisms in nonequilibrium physics: (i) the time-convolution (TC) and time-convolutionless (TCL) projection-operator master equations, and (ii) the correspondence principle of non-equilibrium thermo field dynamics (NETFD), which provides a doubling construction equivalent to an embedding of density-operator dynamics into a vector evolution in an enlarged space. We define a general information-backflow functional N_I associated with an information quantity I(t) and derive sufficient conditions for the absence of backflow (N_I = 0) in terms of divisibility properties of the instantaneous TCL generator. We further introduce a decomposition of backflow into classical and intrinsic thermo-field entanglement contributions, leading to a classification of transient overshoot and revival phenomena in a model-independent manner. Minimal classical and quantum two-state models are discussed as analytically tractable examples, recovering Mittag-Leffler fractional relaxation as a universal envelope. We also provide a constructive TC-to-TCL algorithm for extracting effective rates and producing phase diagrams of backflow.

Title: Volume-law protection of metrological advantage
Authors: Piotr Wysocki, Jan Chwedeńczuk, Marcin Płodzień
Abstract: Although entanglement can boost metrological precision beyond the standard quantum limit, the advantage often disappears with particle loss. We demonstrate that scrambling safeguards precision by dispersing information about the encoded parameter into many-body correlations. For Haar-random scrambling unitaries, we derive exact formulas for the average quantum Fisher information (QFI) of the reduced state after tracing out lost particles. The result exhibits a threshold; any remaining subsystem larger than $N/2$ recovers the full QFI, while smaller subsystems contain negligible information. We link this threshold to the scrambling-induced transition from area-law to volume-law entanglement and the associated growth of the Schmidt rank. We outline two realizations -- a brickwork circuit and chaotic XX-chain evolution -- and demonstrate the protection of one-axis-twisted probes against the loss of up to half of the particles.

Title: Eigenstate Thermalization for Local versus Translationally Invariant Observables
Authors: Rohit Patil, Marcos Rigol
Abstract: Local observables and their translationally invariant counterparts are generally thought as providing the same predictions for experimental measurements. This is used in the context of their expectation values, which are indeed the same in clean systems (up to finite-size effects), but also in the context of their correlation functions, which need not be the same. We examine this intuition from the perspective of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Specifically, we explore the diagonal matrix elements and the spectral functions of local and translationally invariant observables in the spin-1 tilted field Ising chain with periodic and open boundary conditions. We discuss in which ways those observables are different and in which contexts they can be thought as being the same. Furthermore, we unveil a novel form of off-diagonal eigenstate thermalization in translationally invariant systems that applies to pairs of energy eigenstates with different quasimomenta.

Title: Universality classes split by strong and weak symmetries
Authors: Jongjun M. Lee, Myung-Joong Hwang, Igor Boettcher
Abstract: Dissipative phase transitions are strongly shaped by the symmetries of the Liouvillian, yet the quantitative impact of weak and strong symmetries on critical behavior has remained unclear. We study a squeezed-photon model with single- and two-photon losses, realizing weak and strong symmetries in the simplest possible setting. The two symmetries exhibit identical Gaussian static fluctuations, whereas the order parameter and the asymptotic decay rate display distinct scaling behaviors. Our one-loop Keldysh analysis, together with cumulant-expansion numerics, reveals sharply different critical scaling with respect to the thermodynamic scaling parameter. This establishes that weak and strong symmetries lead to distinct dynamical universality classes despite originating from the same symmetry group in the closed system. Our results provide a clear quantitative demonstration that strong symmetries fundamentally reshape dissipative criticality.

Title: Generalized Families of QFTs
Authors: T. Daniel Brennan, Kenneth Intriligator
Abstract: RG flows and IR phases of QFTs can be constrained by generalized symmetries and their anomalies. Broken symmetries act on the space of coupling constants of families of theories, and can also have IR-constraining family anomalies. We generalize family anomaly considerations to cases of broken generalized/categorical symmetries, including higher-group and non-invertible symmetries. We consider the anomaly inflow and SymTFTs of such generalized families of QFTs, and their implications for RG flows and constraints on the IR phases. As examples, we apply family anomalies to study the IR phases of $4d$ QCD-like theories deformed by irrelevant, multi-fermion interactions.

Title: Boltzmann Reinforcement Learning for Noise resilience in Analog Ising Machines
Authors: Aditya Choudhary, Saaketh Desai, Prasad Iyer
Abstract: Analog Ising machines (AIMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for combinatorial optimization, utilizing physical dynamics to solve Ising problems with high energy efficiency. However, the performance of traditional optimization and sampling algorithms on these platforms is often limited by inherent measurement noise. We introduce BRAIN (Boltzmann Reinforcement for Analog Ising Networks), a distribution learning framework that utilizes variational reinforcement learning to approximate the Boltzmann distribution. By shifting from state-by-state sampling to aggregating information across multiple noisy measurements, BRAIN is resilient to Gaussian noise characteristic of AIMs. We evaluate BRAIN across diverse combinatorial topologies, including the Curie-Weiss and 2D nearest-neighbor Ising systems. We find that under realistic 3\% Gaussian measurement noise, BRAIN maintains 98\% ground state fidelity, whereas Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods degrade to 51\% fidelity. Furthermore, BRAIN reaches the MCMC-equivalent solution up to 192x faster under these conditions. BRAIN exhibits $\mathcal{O}(N^{1.55})$ scaling up to 65,536 spins and maintains robustness against severe measurement uncertainty up to 40\%. Beyond ground state optimization, BRAIN accurately captures thermodynamic phase transitions and metastable states, providing a scalable and noise-resilient method for utilizing analog computing architectures in complex optimizations.

Title: Quantum Correlation Dynamics Subjected to Quantum Reset-Driven Environment
Authors: R. Jafari, Ali Asadian, Mehdi Biderang, Alireza Akbari
Abstract: We study two central qubits interacting with a transverse-field Ising chain that serves as their environment. The environment is driven linearly in time across its quantum critical points (QCPs) and, during the evolution, is subjected to quantum reset (QR), where it is returned at random times to its initial state. We investigate how such QR of the environmental spin chain modifies the dynamics of entanglement and quantum discord between the qubits. Our results show that in the strong-coupling regime, entanglement and discord exhibit pronounced revivals within the interval bounded by the Ising QCPs, but these revivals diminish as the QR rate increases. In contrast, weak coupling leads to a monotonic reduction of quantum correlations. Numerically, we find that the revival peaks of concurrence decay and scale exponentially with the QR rate, while quantum discord shows no clear scaling behavior. In the weak-coupling regime without QR, the correlations decay monotonically as the driven field crosses the second QCP. When QR is applied, however, both entanglement and discord undergo oscillatory suppression, with the oscillation period increasing as either the QR rate or the ramp time scale is reduced.

Title: Non-Hermitian stealthy hyperuniformity
Authors: Gitae Lee, Seungmok Youn, Ikbeom Lee, Kunwoo Park, Duhwan Hwang, Xianji Piao, Namkyoo Park, Sunkyu Yu
Abstract: Symmetry-driven wave physics in open systems, exemplified by parity-time (PT) symmetry, has extended the landscape of crystalline phases in materials science to include gain-loss media. Given the growing interest in engineering disorder for wave manipulation, such non-Hermitian crystals motivate the extension of non-Hermitian frameworks into the realm of correlated disorder. Here, we propose hyperuniformity and stealthiness in non-Hermitian systems as a generalization of PT-symmetric crystals to correlated disorder. We extend the scattering-microstructure correspondence to open systems, formulating non-Hermitian hyperuniformity and stealthiness that encompass their Hermitian counterparts. This approach, incorporating a statistical crystallography framework for non-Hermitian materials, demonstrates that real-imaginary cross-correlations of the material potential are irrelevant for achieving hyperuniformity but are essential for characterizing stealthiness, revealing unidirectional scattering phases that are inaccessible in Hermitian materials and in non-Hermitian crystals. By analysing the microstructural statistics of the resulting materials, our results, building on non-Hermitian wave physics, establish a connection to materials science, encompassing conventional descriptors of correlated disorder.

Title: Background-free Tracking of Ultrafast Hole and Electron Dynamics with XUV Transient Grating Spectroscopy
Authors: Vincent Eggers, Rafael Quintero-Bermudez, Kevin Gulu Xiong, Stephen R. Leone
Abstract: Extreme ultraviolet (XUV) transient absorption (TA) and transient reflectivity (TR) spectroscopies enable element-specific insights into attosecond-timescale processes in solids. XUV transient grating spectroscopy (TGS) is an emerging tool that combines the advantages of both absorption and reflectivity while offering intrinsically background-free detection. Here, we implement XUV-TGS by generating a transient grating in germanium solid using two few-cycle near-infrared pulses and probing it with an attosecond XUV pulse, produced via tabletop high-harmonic generation. The spectrally resolved, diffracted XUV pulses directly visualize the separate ultrashort decay times of both photoexcited electrons and holes, without the need for iterative deconvolution. By combining XUV-TA and -TG spectroscopy, we extract the evolution of the complex refractive index, ñ, without the need for Kramers-Kronig reconstruction, as required in XUV-TR, allowing us to extract the roots of the induced optical response. We find reflectivity changes of up to 34% via the real part of ñ, whereas changes in the imaginary part only result in a variation in reflectivity of around 0.5%.

Authors: Shozo Yamada, Akihiro Hokkyo, Masahito Ueda
Abstract: Thermalization in isolated quantum many-body systems can be nonmonotonic, with its process dependent on an initial state. We propose a numerical method to construct a low-entangled initial state that creates a ``burst''$\unicode{x2013}\unicode{x2013}$a transient deviation of an observable from its thermal equilibrium value$\unicode{x2013}\unicode{x2013}$at a designated time. We apply this method to demonstrate that a burst of magnetization can be realized for a nonintegrable mixed-field Ising chain on a timescale comparable to the onset of quantum scrambling. Contrary to the typical spreading of information in this regime, the created burst is accompanied by a slow or even negative entanglement growth. Analytically, we show that a burst becomes probabilistically rare after a long time. Our results suggest that a nonequilibrium state is maintained for an appropriately chosen initial state until scrambling becomes dominant. These predictions can be tested with programmable quantum simulators.

Title: Topology and higher-order global synchronization on directed and hollow simplicial and cell complexes
Authors: Runyue Wang, Timoteo Carletti, Ginestra Bianconi
Abstract: Higher-order networks encode the many-body interactions of complex systems ranging from the brain to biological transportation networks. Simplicial and cell complexes are ideal higher-order network representations for investigating higher-order topological dynamics where dynamical variables are not only associated with nodes, but also with edges, triangles, and higher-order simplices and cells. Global Topological Synchronization (GTS) refers to the dynamical state in which identical oscillators associated with higher-dimensional simplices and cells oscillate in unison. On standard unweighted and undirected complexes this dynamical state can be achieved only under strict topological and combinatorial conditions on the underlying discrete support. In this work we consider generalized higher-order network representations including directed and hollow complexes. Based on an in depth investigation of their topology defined by their associated algebraic topology operators and Betti numbers, we determine under which conditions GTS can be observed. We show that directed complexes always admit a global topological synchronization state independently of their topology and structure. However, we demonstrate that for directed complexes this dynamical state cannot be asymptotically stable. While hollow complexes require more stringent topological conditions to sustain global topological synchronization, these topologies can favor both the existence and the stability of global topological synchronization with respect to undirected and unweighted complexes.

Title: A 4D-STEM Tomographic Framework Assisted by Object Tracking for Nanoparticle Structure Solution
Authors: Saleh Gholam, Arno Annys, Irina Skvortsova, Erica Cordero Oyonarte, Amirhossein Hajizadeh, Philippe Boullay, Johan Hofkens, Johan Verbeeck, Joke Hadermann
Abstract: Three-dimensional electron diffraction (3D ED) has emerged as a powerful method for solving the structures of sub-micron-sized particles down to nanoparticles. However, it faces technical challenges when applied to beam-sensitive samples or conglomerated and agglomerated nanoparticles. This study presents a novel approach that combines 4D-STEM tomography with object tracking and segmentation algorithms to overcome these limitations and achieve single-crystalline 3D ED datasets from nanopowder samples. The method and data quality are assessed on brookite TiO2 nanorods and beam-sensitive CsPbBr3 nanoparticles. To finely sample the reciprocal-space, the data acquisition was automated to acquire hundreds of 4D-STEM scans using a slightly convergent beam and at fine tilt steps. The proposed method provides enhanced signal-to-noise ratio, low illumination time for reducing beam damage, and the ability to analyze multiple particles from a single tomographic dataset. The procedure is optimized to be feasible using commercially available desktops and detectors. This extends the method applicability in the community to the systems and samples that were previously inaccessible for conventional 3D ED methods, particularly breaking the technical challenges for the data acquisition.

Title: Symmetric preferences, asymmetric outcomes: Tipping dynamics in an open-city segregation model
Authors: Fabio van Dissel, Tuan Minh Pham, Wout Merbis
Abstract: Schelling's model of segregation demonstrates that even in the absence of social or governmental interventions, individuals with mild in-group preferences can self-organize into strongly segregated neighborhoods. Many variants of this celebrated model have been proposed by assuming agents tend to increase their satisfaction. Complementary to this traditional, utility-based approach, we model residential moves using satisfaction-independent reaction rates in a spatially extended chemical reaction network. The resulting model exhibits a counter-intuitive phenomenon: despite symmetric in-group preferences, the system undergoes a tipping transition at a critical preference level, beyond which one agent type dominates. We characterize this asymmetric phase transition in details using mean-field analysis, numerical simulations and finite size scaling methods. We find that while the transition shares key features with the Ising universality class, such as $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry breaking and similar exponent ratios, the full set of critical exponents does not match any known universality class.

Title: A dialog between cell adhesion and topology at the core of morphogenesis
Authors: Adrian Aguirre-Tamaral, Elisa Floris, Bernat Corominas-Murtra
Abstract: During the development of an organism, cells must coordinate and organize to generate the correct shape, structure, and spatial patterns of tissues and organs, a process known as morphogenesis. The morphogenesis of embryonic tissues is supported by multiple processes that induce the precise physical deformations required for tissues to ultimately form organs with complex geometries. Among the most active players shaping the morphogenetic path are fine-tuned changes in cell adhesion. In this paper, we show that a local, pair-wise property defined at the cell-cell contact level has important global consequences for embryonic tissue topology, being determinant in defining both the geometric and material properties of early embryo tissues.

Title: Framework for (non-)adiabatic chiral state conversion: from non-Hermitian Hamiltonians to Liouvillians
Authors: Elna Svegborn, Shishir Khandelwal
Abstract: Adiabatic chiral state conversion (CSC) is one of the many counterintuitive effects associated with non-Hermitian physics. In quantum systems, numerous works have demonstrated this phenomenon under both non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and Lindblad evolution. However, despite considerable progress, the physical mechanism behind it has been a subject of debate. In this work, we present a unified framework that explains CSC in any non-Hermitian system, encompassing non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, Lindblad, and hybrid settings. Our framework relies on perturbative, non-adiabatic corrections to adiabatic evolution and consistently predicts CSC with only the lowest-order corrections. We demonstrate its efficacy with models of single and coupled dissipative qubits, obtaining analytical solutions for the conversion fidelity. Our analysis further reveals the role of non-perturbative dynamics, which can be present even in apparently slow trajectories. We show that this property can be utilised to considerably enhance state conversion. Finally, we demonstrate that CSC can be observed in a model without the presence of exceptional points.

Title: Universal Foundations of Thermodynamics: Entropy and Energy Beyond Equilibrium and Without Extensivity
Authors: Gian Paolo Beretta
Abstract: Thermodynamics is commonly presented as a theory of macroscopic systems in stable equilibrium, built upon assumptions of extensivity and scaling with system size. In this paper, we present a universal formulation of the elementary foundations of thermodynamics, in which entropy and energy are defined and employed beyond equilibrium and without assuming extensivity. The formulation applies to all systems -- large and small, with many or few particles -- and to all states, whether equilibrium or nonequilibrium, by relying on carefully stated operational definitions and existence principles rather than macroscopic idealizations. Key thermodynamic concepts, including adiabatic availability and available energy, are developed and illustrated using the energy-entropy diagram representation of nonequilibrium states, which provides geometric insight into irreversibility and the limits of work extraction for systems of any size. A substantial part of the paper is devoted to the analysis of entropy transfer in non-work interactions, leading to precise definitions of heat interactions and heat-and-diffusion interactions of central importance in mesoscopic continuum theories of nonequilibrium behavior in simple and complex solids and fluids. As a direct consequence of this analysis, Clausius inequalities and the Clausius statement of the second law are derived in forms explicitly extended to nonequilibrium processes. The resulting framework presents thermodynamics as a universal theory whose concepts apply uniformly to all systems, large and small, and provides a coherent foundation for both teaching and modern applications.

Title: Effectiveness of Binary Autoencoders for QUBO-Based Optimization Problems
Authors: Tetsuro Abe, Masashi Yamashita, Shu Tanaka
Abstract: In black-box combinatorial optimization, objective evaluations are often expensive, so high quality solutions must be found under a limited budget. Factorization machine with quantum annealing (FMQA) builds a quadratic surrogate model from evaluated samples and optimizes it on an Ising machine. However, FMQA requires binary decision variables, and for nonbinary structures such as integer permutations, the choice of binary encoding strongly affects search efficiency. If the encoding fails to reflect the original neighborhood structure, small Hamming moves may not correspond to meaningful modifications in the original solution space, and constrained problems can yield many infeasible candidates that waste evaluations. Recent work combines FMQA with a binary autoencoder (bAE) that learns a compact binary latent code from feasible solutions, yet the mechanism behind its performance gains is unclear. Using a small traveling salesman problem as an interpretable testbed, we show that the bAE reconstructs feasible tours accurately and, compared with manually designed encodings at similar compression, better aligns tour distances with latent Hamming distances, yields smoother neighborhoods under small bit flips, and produces fewer local optima. These geometric properties explain why bAE+FMQA improves the approximation ratio faster while maintaining feasibility throughout optimization, and they provide guidance for designing latent representations for black-box optimization.

Title: Nonreciprocal lensing and backscattering suppression via magneto-optical nonlocality
Authors: Dmitry Vagin, Maxim A. Gorlach
Abstract: We introduce a special kind of nonreciprocal electromagnetic response which gives rise to backscattering suppression in the bulk, a long-sought feature in topological photonics, as well as nonreciprocal lensing - an effect when the same structure focuses light incident from one direction and defocuses light propagating in the opposite way. We predict this response in spin spirals and in specially designed metamaterials, validating the key predictions.

Title: Theory for enzymatic degradation of semi-crystalline polymer particles
Authors: Michael Schindler, Hernan Garate, Ludwik Leibler
Abstract: In enzymatic recycling or biodegradation of semi-crystalline plastic waste, crystalline spherulites embedded into an amorphous matrix hinder and slow down depolymerisation. When the enzymatic depolymerisation temperature exceeds the glass transition temperature, these spherulites tend to grow. The depolymerisation process is thus controlled by a competition between erosion of the amorphous matrix from the particle surface and the growth of recalcitrant spherulites within the particle bulk and at its surface. We present a geometric model that captures this competition, together with an algorithm to solve the equations numerically. Our algorithm introduces a new extension of Voronoi/Delaunay tessellation in space. We extract the parameters for the model from experimental data on the enzymatic depolymerization by hydrolase LCC-ICCG of PET bottle flakes and textile waste, in order to make a prediction of the observed degradation yield as a function of time. Both the final yield and the degradation kinetics are correctly predicted. Most importantly, the model clarifies how and to which extent nucleating agents, impurities, additives, and/or rapid crystal growth present in the waste can undermine pretreatment efforts aiming to initiate depolymerisation from a material with a low initial crystallinity.

Title: Anyon Permutations in Quantum Double Models through Constant-depth Circuits
Authors: Yabo Li, Zijian Song
Abstract: We provide explicit constant-depth local unitary circuits that realize general anyon permutations in Kitaev's quantum double models. This construction can be naturally understood through a correspondence between anyon permutation symmetries of two-dimensional topological orders and self-dualities in one-dimensional systems, where local gates implement self-duality transformations on the boundaries of microscopic regions. From this holographic perspective, general anyon permutations in the $D(G)$ quantum double correspond to compositions of three classes of one-dimensional self-dualities, including gauging of certain subgroups of $G$, stacking with $G$ symmetry-protected topological phases, and outer automorphisms of the group $G$. We construct circuits realizing the first class by employing self-dual unitary gauging maps, and present transversal circuits for the latter two classes.

Title: Canonical partition function and distance dependent correlation functions of a quasi-one-dimensional system of hard disks
Authors: V.M. Pergamenshchik, T. Bryk, A. Trokhymchuk
Abstract: The canonical NLT partition function of a quasi-one dimensional (q1D) one-file system of equal hard disks [J. Chem Phys. 153, 144111 (2020)] provides an analytical description of the thermodynamics and ordering in this system (a pore) as a function of linear density Nd/L where d is the disk diameter. We derive the analytical formulae for the distance dependence of the translational pair distribution function and the distribution function of distances between next neighbor disks, and then demonstrate their use by calculating the translational order in the pore. In all cases, the order is found to be of a short range and to exponentially decay with the disks' separation. The correlation length presented for different pore widths and densities shows a non-monotonic dependence with a maximum at Nd/L=1 and tends to the 1D value for a vanishing pore width. The results indicate a special role of this density when the pore length L is equal exactly to N disk diameters. A comparison between the theoretical results for an infinite system and the results of a molecular dynamics simulation for a finite system with periodic boundary conditions is presented and discussed.

Title: Gauging on the lattice and gapped/gapless topological phases
Authors: Takamasa Ando
Abstract: In this work, we explore topological phases of matter obtained by effectively gauging or fermionizing a system, where the Gauss law constraint is only enforced energetically. In contrast to conventional gauging or fermionization, the symmetry that is effectively gauged at low energies still generates a global symmetry that acts on the whole Hilbert space faithfully. This symmetry turns out to protect a nontrivial topological phase together with other symmetries, or it can carry a nontrivial emergent 't Hooft anomaly. We provide a precise formula for the topological response action involving these symmetries in a general setup, as well as a formula for 't Hooft anomalies. As an application, we apply the general treatment of the procedure to gapless systems and find various new gapless SPT phases, such as the one carrying the Gu-Wen fermionic anomalies at low energy.

Title: A journey on self-$G$-ality
Authors: Takamasa Ando
Abstract: We explore topological manipulations in one spatial dimension, which are defined for a system with a global symmetry and map the system to another one with a dual symmetry. In particular, we discuss fusion category symmetries enhanced by the invariance of the actions of topological manipulations, i.e., self-$G$-alities for topological manipulations. Based on the self-$G$-ality conditions, we provide LSM-type constraints on the ground states of many-body Hamiltonians. We clarify the relationship between different enhanced symmetries and introduce the notion of $\textit{codimension-two transitions}$. We explore concrete lattice models for such self-$G$-alities and find how the self-$G$-ality structures match the IR critical theories.

Title: Intermediate scattering function of a gravitactic circle swimmer
Authors: Regina Rusch, Oleksandr Chepizhko, Thomas Franosch
Abstract: We analyze gravitaxis of a Brownian circle swimmer by deriving and characterizing analytically the experimentally measurable intermediate scattering function (ISF). To solve the associated Fokker-Planck equation we use a spectral-theory approach and find formal expressions in terms of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the overdamped-noisy-driven-pendulum problem. We further perform a Taylor series of the ISF in the wavevector to read off the cumulants up to the fourth order. We focus on the skewness and kurtosis analyzed for four observation directions in the 2D-plane. Validating our findings involves conducting Langevin-dynamics simulations and interpreting the results using a harmonic approximation. The skewness and kurtosis are amplified as the orienting torque approaches the intrinsic angular drift of the circle swimmer from above, highlighting deviations from Gaussian behavior. Transforming the ISF to the comoving frame, again a measurable quantity, reveals gravitactic effects and diverse behaviors spanning from diffusive motion at low wavenumbers to circular motion at intermediate and directed motion at higher wavenumbers.

Title: Semiclassical model of magnons in double-layered antiferromagnets
Authors: Seo-Jin Kim, Zdeněk Jirák, Jiří Hejtmánek, Karel Knížek, Helge Rosner, Kyo-Hoon Ahn
Abstract: The stability and magnonic properties of double-layered antiferromagnets are investigated using two model systems, a linear chain (LC) and a more complex chain of railroad trestle (RT) geometry, and the results are confronted with properties of the real material CrN. The spin-paired order ($\cdots{+}{+}{-}{-}\cdots$) in LC requires alternating ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic (AFM) exchanges, whereas in RT, an analogous order remains stable even when all interactions are AFM within certain analytical constraints. The rock-salt structure of CrN evokes clear magnetic frustration since Cr atoms in a face-centered cubic lattice form links to twelve nearest neighbors (NNs) all equivalent and AFM. Nonetheless, the magnetostructural transition to an orthorhombically distorted phase below $T_\text{N} = 287~\text{K}$ leads to four different NN Cr-Cr distances and consequently, to a large diversification of the exchange strength, which suppresses the frustration and allows for stable double-layered AFM order of CrN. This behavior originates from a competition at each NN link between Cr-Cr direct exchange and 90$^\circ$ Cr-N-Cr superexchange, both exhibiting specific power-law dependences on the interatomic distance. Finally, based on the $\textit{ab initio}$ calculated exchange parameters, the magnon spectrum and temperature evolution of ordered magnetic moments are derived.

Title: Direction-dependent linear response for gapped nodal-line semimetals in planar-Hall configurations
Authors: Fasil Hussain Rather, Firdous Haidar, Muhammed Jaffar A., Ipsita Mandal
Abstract: We compute the magnetoelectric conductivity for ideal nodal-line semimetals (NLSMs), with a finite but tiny mass-gap, in distinct planar-Hall set-ups. Each differing configuration results from the relative orientation of the nodal-ring's plane with respect to the plane spanned by the electric ($\mathbf E $) and magnetic ($\mathbf B$) fields. The net conductivity tensor has components comprising the Drude, anomalous-Hall, in-plane (with $\mathbf E$ and $\mathbf B$) longitudinal and transverse, and Lorentz-force-operator-induced parts. Our results feature the signatures of the inherent topology of a gapped NLSM, revealed through nonzero values of the Berry curvature and the orbital magnetic moment. In particular, we show that both of these vector fields, arising in the momentum space, give rise to terms of comparable magnitudes in the resulting response. Our explicit theoretical expressions will help identify unique signatures of NLSMs in contemporary experiments.

Title: The Role of Hydrogen and Oxygen Interstitial Defects in Crystalline Si cells: Mechanism of Device Degradation in Humid Environment
Authors: Bo Li, Feifei Zhang, Yu Pang, Jinyu Hu, Huiyan Zhao, Guocai Liu, Chao He, Xingtao An
Abstract: The efficiency of silicon solar cells gradually decreases in various environments, with humidity being a key factor contributing to this decline through moisture-induced degradation (MID) involving multiple mechanisms including encapsulant hydrolysis and metal ion migration. Among these mechanisms, the role of water-derived hydrogen and oxygen interstitial defects represents an underexplored yet fundamental degradation pathway. This study employs density functional theory and quantum transport theory to investigate hydrogen and oxygen interstitial defects as a novel perspective for understanding MID mechanisms. Results reveal that neutral hydrogen interstitials at bond-center sites exhibit low diffusion barriers (0.96 eV) and act as deep-level recombination centers, while oxygen interstitials face higher diffusion barriers (2.2 eV) with limited trapping capability. Device simulations demonstrate that hydrogen defects cause substantially more pronounced photovoltaic current degradation through enhanced non-radiative recombination. Critically, under humid conditions, hydrogen from water molecules readily penetrates silicon lattices forming active recombination centers, while oxygen incorporation remains kinetically limited with negligible impact. This interstitial defect perspective provides novel understanding of MID mechanisms, explaining why moisture exposure primarily degrades silicon solar cells through hydrogen rather than oxygen incorporation, offering fundamental insights for developing targeted mitigation strategies.

Title: Generalized Lotka-Volterra model with sparse interactions: non-Gaussian effects and topological multiple-equilibria phase
Authors: Tommaso Tonolo, Maria Chiara Angelini, Sandro Azaele, Amos Maritan, Giacomo Gradenigo
Abstract: We study the equilibrium phases of a generalized Lotka-Volterra model characterized by a species interaction matrix which is random, sparse and symmetric. Dynamical fluctuations are modeled by a demographic noise with amplitude proportional to the effective temperature T. The equilibrium distribution of species abundances is obtained by means of the cavity method and the Belief Propagation equations, which allow for an exact solution on sparse networks. Our results reveal a rich and non-trivial phenomenology that deviates significantly from the predictions of fully connected models. Consistently with data from real ecosystems, which are characterized by sparse rather than dense interaction networks, we find strong deviations from Gaussianity in the distribution of abundances. In addition to the study of these deviations from Gaussianity, which are not related to multiple-equilibria, we also identified a novel topological glass phase, present at both finite temperature, as shown here, and at T=0, as previously suggested in the literature. The peculiarity of this phase, which differs from the multiple-equilibria phase of fully-connected networks, is its strong dependence on the presence of extinctions. These findings provide new insights into how network topology and disorder influence ecological networks, particularly emphasizing that sparsity is a crucial feature for accurately modeling real-world ecological phenomena.

Title: Critical Probability Distributions of the order parameter at two loops II: $O(n)$ universality class
Authors: Sankarshan Sahu
Abstract: We show how to compute the probability distributions of the order parameter of the $O(n)$ model at two-loop order of perturbation theory generalizing the methods developed for computing the same in case of the Ising model \cite{Sahu:2025bkp}. We show that even for the $O(n)$ model, there exists not one but a family of these probability distribution functions indexed by $\zeta$ which is the ratio of system size $L$ to the bulk correlation length $\xi_{\infty}$. We also compare these PDFs to the Monte-Carlo simulations and the existing FRG results for the $O(2)$ and $O(3)$ models.

Title: Perfect supercurrent diode efficiency in chiral nanotube-based weak links
Authors: Joseph J. Cuozzo, François Léonard
Abstract: The supercurrent diode effect (SDE) describes superconducting systems where the magnitude of the superconducting-to-normal state switching current differs for positive and negative current bias. Despite the ubiquity of such diode effects in Josephson devices, the fundamental conditions to observe a diode effect in a Josephson junction and achieve perfect diode efficiency remain unclear. In this work, we analyze the supercurrent diode properties of a chiral nanotube-based Josephson junction within a Ginzburg-Landau theory. We find a diode effect and anomalous phase develop across the junction when a magnetic field is applied parallel to the tube despite the absence of spin-orbit interactions in the system. Unexpectedly, the SDE in the junction is independent of the anomalous phase. Alternatively, we determine a non-reciprocal persistent current that is protected by fluxoid quantization can activate SDE, even in the absence of higher-order pair tunneling processes. We show this new type of SDE can lead to, in principle, a perfect diode efficiency, highlighting how persistent currents can be used to engineer high efficiency supercurrent diodes.

Title: Eppur si muove: Shape of topological defects -- and consequent motion -- in active nematics
Authors: Giacomo Marco La Montagna, Sumeja Burekovic, Ananyo Maitra, Cesare Nardini
Abstract: Topological defects in systems with liquid-crystalline order are crucial in determining their large-scale properties. In active systems, they are known to have properties impossible at equilibrium: for example, $+1/2$ defects in nematically-ordered systems self-propel. While some previous theoretical descriptions relied on assuming that the defect shape remains unperturbed by activity, we show that this assumption can lead to inconsistent predictions. We compute the shape of $-1/2$ defects and show that the one of $+1/2$ is intimately related to their self-propulsion speed. Our analytical predictions are corroborated via numerical simulations of a generic active nematic theory.

Title: Rare Trajectories in a Prototypical Mean-field Disordered Model: Insights into Landscape and Instantons
Authors: Patrick Charbonneau, Giampaolo Folena, Enrico M. Malatesta, Tommaso Rizzo, Francesco Zamponi
Abstract: For disordered systems within the random first-order transition (RFOT) universality class, such as structural glasses and certain spin glasses, the role played by activated relaxation processes is rich to the point of perplexity. Over the last decades, various efforts have attempted to formalize and systematize such processes in terms of instantons similar to the nucleation droplets of first-order phase transitions. In particular, Kirkpatrick, Thirumalai, and Wolynes proposed in the late '80s an influential nucleation theory of relaxation in structural glasses. Already within this picture, however, the resulting structures are far from the compact objects expected from the classical droplet description. In addition, an altogether different type of single-particle hopping-like instantons has recently been isolated in molecular simulations. Landscape studies of mean-field spin glass models have further revealed that simple saddle crossing does not capture relaxation in these systems. We present here a landscape-agnostic study of rare dynamical events, which delineates the richness of instantons in these systems. Our work not only captures the structure of metastable states, but also identifies the point of irreversibility, beyond which activated relaxation processes become a fait accompli. An interpretation of the associated landscape features is articulated, thus charting a path toward a complete understanding of RFOT instantons.

Title: Localization behavior in a Hermitian and non-Hermitian Raman lattice
Authors: Entong Zhao, Yu-Jun Liu, Ka Kwan Pak, Peng Ren, Mengbo Guo, Chengdong He, Gyu-Boong Jo
Abstract: We propose a flexible Raman lattice system for alkaline-earth-like atoms to theoretically investigate localization behaviors in a quasi-periodic lattice with controllable non-Hermiticity. Our analysis demonstrates that critical phases and mobility edges can arise by adjusting spin-dependence of the incommensurate potentials in the Hermitian regime. With non-Hermiticity introduced by spin-selective atom loss, our calculations reveal that critical localization behaviour in this system can be suppressed by dissipation. Our work provides insights into interplay between quasi-periodicity and non-Hermitian physics, offering a new perspective on localization phenomena.

Title: Error-resilient Reversal of Quantum Chaotic Dynamics Enabled by Scramblons
Authors: Yu-Chen Li, Tian-Gang Zhou, Shengyu Zhang, Ze Wu, Liqiang Zhao, Haochuan Yin, Xiaoxue An, Hui Zhai, Pengfei Zhang, Xinhua Peng, Jiangfeng Du
Abstract: The emergence of the arrow of time in quantum many-body systems stems from the inherent tendency of Hamiltonian evolution to scramble quantum information and increase entanglement. While, in principle, one might counteract this temporal directionality by engineering a perfectly inverted Hamiltonian to reverse entanglement growth, such a scenario is fundamentally unstable because even minor imperfections in the backward evolution can be exponentially amplified, a hallmark of quantum many-body chaos. Therefore, successfully reversing quantum many-body dynamics demands a deep understanding of the underlying structure of quantum information scrambling and chaotic dynamics. In this letter, by using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance on a macroscopic ensemble of randomly interacting spins, we measure the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) and validate key predictions of scramblon theory, a universal theoretical framework for information scrambling. Crucially, this theory enables us to isolate and mitigate errors in the OTOC caused by imperfections in the backward evolution. As a result, this protocol uncovers the anticipated exponential behavior of quantum many-body chaos and extracts the quantum Lyapunov exponent in a many-body experimental system for the first time. Our results push the fundamental limits of dynamical reversibility of complex quantum systems, with implications for quantum simulation and metrology.

Title: Mapping Phase Diagrams of Quantum Spin Systems through Semidefinite-Programming Relaxations
Authors: David Jansen, Donato Farina, Luke Mortimer, Timothy Heightman, Andreas Leitherer, Pere Mujal, Jie Wang, Antonio Acín
Abstract: Identifying quantum phase transitions poses a significant challenge in condensed matter physics, as this requires methods that both provide accurate results and scale well with system size. In this work, we demonstrate how relaxation methods can be used to generate the phase diagram for one- and two-dimensional quantum systems. To do so, we formulate a relaxed version of the ground-state problem as a semidefinite program, which we can solve efficiently. Then, by taking the resulting vector of moments for different model parameters, we identify all phase transitions based on their cosine similarity. Furthermore, we show how spontaneous symmetry breaking is naturally captured by bounding the corresponding observable. Using these methods, we reproduce the phase transitions for the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model and the two-dimensional frustrated bilayer Heisenberg model. We also illustrate how the phase diagram of the latter changes when a next-nearest-neighbor interaction is introduced. Overall, our work demonstrates how relaxation methods provide a novel framework for studying and understanding quantum phase transitions.

Title: Ultrafast optical manipulation of magnetic skyrmions
Authors: Xingdi Wang, Haiming Dong, Kai Chang
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the inertial dynamics of magnetic skyrmions driven by circularly polarized light (CPL) via the inverse Faraday effect (IFE). By incorporating an inertial mass term into the Thiele equation and analytically deriving the optically induced magnetic fields and forces, we demonstrate fundamentally distinct dynamical regimes under continuous-wave (CW) versus pulsed excitation. Skyrmion inertia qualitatively transforms trajectories from smooth spirals to polygonal orbits under continuous driving, while enabling sustained post-pulse gyration that reveals the system's intrinsic relaxation dynamics. The handedness of the trajectory is determined by the topological charge and light helicity: left-circularly polarized (LCP) light attracts skyrmions toward the beam center, while right-circularly polarized (RCP) light repels them. Systematic parameter analysis reveals how Gilbert damping, optical intensity, frequency, and skyrmion mass control the transition between oscillatory and overdamped dynamical phases. Our work identifies inertia, topological charge, and light helicity as essential factors in ultrafast all-optical skyrmion manipulation and provides a theoretical model for designing topological spin textures with ultrafast light.

Title: Fluctuation response of a superconductor with temporally correlated noise
Authors: V. Plastovets
Abstract: We discuss how a finite noise correlation time, which can arise through coupling to engineered nonthermal environments, affects the fluctuation-driven response in a superconductor above its critical temperature. Using the phenomenological time-dependent Ginzburg--Landau model, we formulate the stochastic dynamics within the path-integral framework. Our analysis reveals that the transport response can be enhanced when the noise correlation time becomes comparable to the intrinsic relaxation time of the superconductor. The magnitude and character of this resonant-like effect depend strongly on the system's dimensionality.

Title: Superconducting Dome in $\mathrm{La}_{3-x}\mathrm{Sr}_{x}\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{7-δ}$ Thin Films
Authors: Maosen Wang, Bo Hao, Wenjie Sun, Shengjun Yan, Shengwang Sun, Hongyi Zhang, Zhengbin Gu, Yuefeng Nie
Abstract: The ambient-pressure superconductivity in $\mathrm{La}_{3}\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{7}$ thin films via compressive epitaxial strain provides a highly accessible platform for diverse characterization techniques, facilitating the studies of high-temperature superconductivity. Here, we systematically map the phase diagram and reveal the superconducting dome with an electron-hole crossover in compressively strained $\mathrm{La}_{3-x}\mathrm{Sr}_{x}\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{7-\delta}$ thin films by simultaneously tuning Sr doping and oxygen content. The maximum transition temperature (${T}_{c}$) coincides with an anomalous sign change in the Hall coefficient (${R}_{H}$), reminiscent of electron-doped cuprates, which may signal a Fermi surface reconstruction. Beyond the superconducting dome, a $\ln1/T$ insulating regime and a $T$-linear resistivity regime are also resolved, resembling behaviors observed in cuprates and infinite-layer nickelates. This work reveals a dome-shaped relationship between ${T}_{c}$ and ${R}_{H}$ and establishes a key framework for understanding unconventional superconductivity in nickelate systems.

Title: Polymer translocation through extended patterned pores in two dimensions: scaling of the total translocation time
Authors: Andri Sharma, Abhishek Chaudhuri, Rajeev Kapri
Abstract: We study the translocation of a flexible polymer through extended patterned pores using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We consider cylindrical and conical pore geometries that can be controlled by the angle of the pore apex $\alpha$. We obtained the average translocation time $\langle \tau \rangle$ for various chain lengths $N$ and the length of the pores $L_p$ for various values $\alpha$ and found that $\langle \tau \rangle$ scales as $\langle \tau \rangle \sim N^\gamma \mathcal{F}\left( L_p N^\phi \right)$ with exponents $\gamma = 3.00\pm0.05$ and $\phi = 1.50\pm0.05$ for both patterned and unpatterned pores.

Title: Incompressible quantum liquid on the four-dimensional sphere
Authors: Junwen Zhao, Xue Meng, Wei Zhu, Congjun Wu
Abstract: The study of quantum Hall effect (QHE) is a foundation of topological physics, inspiring extensive explorations of its high-dimensional generalizations. Notably, the four dimensional (4D) QHE has been experimentally realized in synthetic quantum systems, including cold atoms, photonic lattices, and metamaterials. However, the many-body effect in the 4D QHE system remains poorly understood. In this study, we explore this problem by formulating the microscopic wavefunctions inspired by Laughlin's seminal work. Employing a generalized pseudo-potential framework, we derive an exact microscopic Hamiltonian consisting of two-body projectors that annihilate the microscopic wavefunctions. Diagonalizations on a small size system show that the quasi-hole states remain zero energy while the quasi-particle states exhibit a finite gap, in consistency with an incompressible state. Furthermore, the pairing distribution is calculated to substantiate the liquid-like nature of the wavefunction. Our work provides a preliminary understanding to the fractional topological states in high dimension.

Abstract: We report transient highly strained structural states in individual palladium (Pd) nanocrystals, electronically heated using an optical laser, which precede their uniform thermal expansion. Using an X-ray free-electron laser probe, the evolution of individual 111 Bragg peaks is measured as a function of delay time at various laser fluences. Above a laser fluence threshold at a sufficient pump-probe delay, the Bragg peak splits into multiple peaks, indicating heterogeneous strain, before returning to a single peak, corresponding to even heat distribution throughout the lattice expanded crystal. Our findings are supported by a lattice displacement and strain model of a single nanocrystal at different delay times, which agrees with the experimental data. Our observations have implications for understanding femtosecond laser interactions with metals and the potential photo-catalytic performance of Pd.

Title: A flat-band perspective on the boson peak in amorphous solids
Authors: Shivam Mahajan, Long-Zhou Huang, Cunyuan Jiang, Yun-Jiang Wang, Massimo Pica Ciamarra, Jie Zhang, Matteo Baggioli
Abstract: The boson peak is a characteristic anomaly of amorphous solids broadly defined as a low-energy excess in the density of states and heat capacity compared to the textbook predictions of Debye theory. The origin of this anomaly has long been the subject of ongoing debate and remains a topic of active controversy. We propose that the boson peak may have a defining dynamical feature: the accumulation of vibrational spectral weight within a narrow frequency window that is only weakly dependent on wavevector. In this perspective, the boson peak reflects a flat or weakly dispersive band in the dynamical structure factor rather than a propagating excitation. We revisit both experimental and simulation data from the literature through this lens and conduct further simulations in 2D and 3D amorphous systems. Taken together, these analyses provide compelling converging evidence for this interpretation and sharply constrain the space of viable theoretical descriptions of the boson peak.

Title: Magnetic-Field-Induced Geometric Response of Mean-Field Projectors: Streda Formula and Orbital Magnetization
Authors: Jihang Zhu, Chunli Huang
Abstract: We study the magnetic-field response of interacting electron systems within mean-field theory using perturbation theory. We show that the linear response of the mean-field density-matrix to a weak magnetic field is purely geometric: it depends only on wavefunction derivatives, the Berry connections linking the occupied and unoccupied subspaces, and is independent of the interaction potential and the quasiparticle dispersion. This leads to compact, gauge-invariant projector expressions for both the Středa formula and the formula for orbital magnetization. Our calculation explicitly elucidates the role of exchange and self-consistency in defining current vertices for orbital magnetization calculations. Our work establishes a direct connection between mean-field theory, quantum geometry and the non-interacting topological band theory.

Title: Rigidity transition in polydisperse shear-thickening suspensions
Authors: Sourav Kumar Singh, Vishant Tyagi, Aritra Santra
Abstract: Shear thickening suspensions of non-Brownian polydisperse particles are simulated in 2D using a discrete element method based algorithm (LF-DEM) at high packing fractions ($\phi$) and large non-dimensional stresses ($\sigma$). Rigidity analysis of the stress induced particle clusters is carried out using \textit{pebble game} algorithm for polydisperse suspensions and compared with the statistically equivalent bidisperse systems. A critical value of the packing fraction, $\phi_c$, close to the shear jamming transition, $\phi_J^{\mu}$, ($\phi_c<\phi_J^{\mu}$) is obtained where rigid particle clusters begin to grow sharply. The growth is found to be characterized by a critical transition of an order parameter ($f_\text{rig}$), defined by the fraction of particles in rigid clusters which scales as, $f_\text{rig}\sim (\phi-\phi_c)^{\beta}$ for $\phi>\phi_c$, and by the susceptibility scaling, $\chi_\text{rig}\sim|\phi-\phi_c |^{-\gamma}$, with exponents having values consistent with the critical exponents in 2D percolation transition. The variations of $f_\text{rig}$ and $\chi_\text{rig}$ in polydisperse suspensions are found to be identical to that of the statistically equivalent bidisperse suspensions. Finite size scaling analysis shows a divergence of correlation length near $\phi_{c_\infty}$ following critical exponent $\nu\approx 1.33$, in agreement with the 2D percolation theory. Furthermore, $\phi_c$ and $\phi_J^{\mu}$ are found to vary non-monotonically with polydispersity index and depend on the particle stiffness.

Title: Screening novel cathode materials from the Energy-GNoME database using MACE machine learning force field and DFT
Authors: Nada Alghamdi, Paolo de Angelis, Pietro Asinari, Eliodoro Chiavazzo
Abstract: The development of new battery materials, particularly novel cathode chemistries, is essential for enabling next generation energy storage technologies. In this work, we employ a multi-fidelity screening protocol combining the Energy-GNoME confident criteria, foundational MACE machine-learning force fields (MLFF), and physically motivated heuristic filters to identify novel intercalation cathodes for post-lithium batteries, namely: Na-, K-, Mg-, and Ca-ion batteries. Foundational MACE models are used to efficiently asses dynamical stability, thermodynamical stability, average voltage, and theoretical specific energy, enabling a rapid screening of candidates. For the most promising cathodes, voltage predictions are refined using DFT+U calculations. This work delivers three key outcomes: i) establishing and validating a robust high-throughput screening approach for cathode materials with foundational MLFF models; ii) suggestions for cathode candidates for the development of next-generation of batteries; iii) a fair comparison between the MACE predictions and the readily available figures of merit reported in the Energy-GNoME database on the examined materials.

Title: First-Principles Investigation of X2NiH6 (X = Ca, Sr, Ba) Hydrides for Hydrogen Storage Applications
Authors: K. Aafi, Z. El Fatouaki, A. Jabar, A. Tahiri, M. Idiri
Abstract: First-principles DFT calculations on the hydrides Ca2NiH6, Sr2NiH6, and Ba2NiH6 reveal key thermodynamic properties. These compounds exhibit increasing entropy and heat capacity with temperature, and are thermodynamically stable at elevated temperatures due to negative free energies. The kinetics of hydrogen storage is influenced by entropy changes during hydrogen adsorption and desorption. Optically, Ba2NiH6 shows a high refractive index at low energies. Mechanical assessments indicate Sr2NiH6 is incompressible with moderate malleability, Ca2NiH6 has the highest resistance to deformation, while Ba2NiH6 is most compressible. Formation energies and hydrogen storage capacities (4.005 wt% for Ca2NiH6, 2.548 wt% for Sr2NiH6, and 1.750 wt% for Ba2NiH6) highlight Ca2NiH6 as the most promising candidate for hydrogen storage technology.

Title: Fluorine-substitution-dependent phase diagram and superconducting properties of Sm-based oxypnictides synthesized by a high-pressure growth technique
Authors: Mohammad Azam, Tatiana Zajarniuk, Ryszard Diduszko, Taras Palasyuk, Cezariusz Jastrzebski, Andrzej Szewczyk, Hiraku Ogino, Shiv J. Singh
Abstract: A series of SmFeAsO1-xFx (Sm1111) bulk samples (x = 0.05 to 0.40) are synthesized by an in-situ cubic-anvil high-pressure technique at 4 GPa and systematically characterized through structural, microstructural, Raman, transport, and magnetic measurements. Structural analysis confirms that the tetragonal Sm1111 phase remains dominant across the entire substitution range, with lattice parameters decreasing smoothly as fluorine content increases, demonstrating effective incorporation of F even in the overdoped regime (x = 0.4). Raman spectroscopy provides complementary, local-phase-sensitive evidence that supports the structural analysis and confirms fluorine substitution in the main Sm1111 phase. In the underdoped region, the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) is enhanced by 10-17 K and the critical current density (Jc) is increased by up to an order of magnitude compared with conventionally synthesized samples at the ambient pressure. The upper critical field, estimated using the WHH model, reaches values approaching 200 T, reflecting strong paramagnetic limitation and multiband effects. TAFF analysis reveals a power-law field dependence of the activation energy, consistent with collective vortex pinning in polycrystalline iron-based superconductors. The superconducting phase diagram constructed from Tc and Jc versus fluorine content reveals a dome-like trend, with a maximum Tc of 57 K and Jc of 10^4 A cm^-2 at the optimal doped region. Comparison with conventionally synthesized Sm1111 samples demonstrates that high-pressure growth significantly extends the effective fluorine substitution range and enhances the superconducting performance, particularly in the underdoped regime. These results establish high-pressure fluorine substitution as an effective materials-engineering approach for tuning the phase diagram and optimizing the superconducting properties of Sm1111.

Title: Wave energy conversion by floating and submerged piezoelectric bimorph plates
Authors: Zachary J. Wegert, Ben Wilks, Ngamta Thamwattana, Vivien J. Challis, Santanu Koley, Michael H. Meylan
Abstract: Gaining insight into the interaction between flexible piezoelectric structures and ocean waves can inform the development of compact, high-efficiency wave-energy converters that harvest renewable energy from the marine environment. In this paper, the problem of wave energy absorption by floating and submerged piezoelectric plates is investigated. The equations of motion for a plate consisting of two piezoelectric layers separated by an elastic substrate are derived in dimensional form from the full piezoelectric constitutive laws. A solution using a modal expansion method is proposed, in which the component radiation and diffraction problems are reduced to hypersingular integral equations and solved numerically using a constant panel method. The method is general and can solve the equations of motion for submerged rigid, flexible elastic or flexible piezoelectric plates. Extensive numerical results for the energy absorption and efficiency are given for a range of parameters, including different piezoelectric materials: polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and lead zirconate titanate (PZT-5H). Importantly, greater energy absorption is obtained for submerged plates when compared to plates floating on the surface. Furthermore, clamped boundary conditions give slightly larger energy absorption compared to the simply supported case. Our open-source code is provided at this https URL.

Title: Collective excitations in chiral spin liquid: chiral roton and long-wavelength nematic mode
Authors: Hongyu Lu, Wei Zhu, Wang Yao
Abstract: Chiral spin liquid (CSL) is a magnetic analogue of the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) liquid. Collective excitations play a vital role in shaping our understanding of these exotic quantum phases of matter and their quantum phase transitions. While the magneto-roton and long-wavelength chiral graviton modes in the FQH liquids have been extensively explored, the collective excitations of CSLs remain elusive. Here we explore the collective excitations in the SU(2) symmetric CSL phase of the spin-1/2 square-lattice $J_1-J_2-J_\chi$ model, where an intriguing quantum phase diagram was recently revealed. Combining exact diagonalization and time-dependent variational principle calculations, we observe two spin-singlet collective modes: a chiral p-wave (low-energy) roton mode at finite momentum and a elliptically polarized d-wave (higher-energy) nematic mode at zero momentum, both of which are prominent across the CSL phase. Such exotic modes exhibit fingerprints distinct from those of FQH liquids, and to the best of our knowledge, are reported for the first time. By tuning $J_2$, we find the nematic mode to be pronouncedly soft, together with the spin-triplet two-spinon bound states, potentially promoting strong nematic and spin stripe instabilities. Our work paves the way for further understanding CSL from the dynamical perspective and provides new spectroscopic signatures for future experiments of CSL candidates.

Title: Bayesian Parameter Estimation for Predictive Modeling of Illumination-Dependent Current-Voltage Curves
Authors: Eunchi Kim, Thomas Kirchartz
Abstract: Machine learning enables rapid estimation of material parameters in solar cells via neural-network-based surrogate models. However, the reliability of extracted parameters depends on underlying assumptions such as the choice of one-dimensional drift-diffusion model and selection of free material parameters. To validate the inferred parameters, we perform predictive modeling of light-intensity-dependent current-voltage (JV) characteristics. Well-known physical effects, including the influence of external resistance and recombination dynamics on illumination-dependent device performance, are reflected in parameter estimation and prediction workflow. We show that correct treatment of dark shunt resistance and emphasizing shifted current (J + Jsc) during fitting enhances prediction accuracy at low to intermediate illumination level. Additionally, we analyze the information content of various input JV curve combinations, demonstrating that including at least one illuminated JV, preferably not under high illumination due to series resistance effects, is critical for reliable parameter estimation and device performance prediction.

Title: Anomalous Non-Hermitian Topological Anderson Insulator
Authors: Mina Ren, Xi Shi, Haitao Jiang, Feng Liu, Hong Chen, Yong Sun
Abstract: Strong disorder drives conventional Hermitian systems into Anderson insulating states, suppressing all topological phases. Here, we unveil symmetry-protected, anomalous topological phases in the strong disorder limit of a non-Hermitian system, characterized by a scale-invariant merging of zero-energy modes. Using the maximally symmetric Jx lattice as an ideal platform and introducing specifically engineered (ABBA-type) symmetry-preserving non-Hermitian disorder, we observe a sequence of disorder-induced phase transitions: from a trivial insulator into and through a non-Hermitian topological Anderson insulator (TAI) phase, culminating in a stable anomalous non-Hermitian TAI phase characterized by a quantized polarization P_x \approx 0.25. Within this anomalous phase protected by the mobility gap, the zero-energy modes exhibit a distinct (N/2)-mode coalescence that scales with system size. Our findings demonstrate that non-Hermitian disorder engineered to preserve symmetry can induce and protect novel topological order inaccessible to conventional Hermitian disorder, thereby advancing the fundamental understanding of topological phenomena mediated by the interplay of disorder and non-Hermiticity.

Title: The impact of spurious imaginary phonon modes on thermal properties of Metal-organic Frameworks
Authors: Prathami Divakar Kamath, Kristin A. Persson
Abstract: Metal-organic Frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as potential candidates for direct air capture (DAC) of green house gases and water. Thermal properties of MOFs, such as their heat capacity, are used to determine the energy penalty associated with the adsorbent retrieval during the Temperature Swing Adsorption process. To aid exploration of the vast experimental design space of MOFs for such applications, computational methods like Density Functional Theory (DFT) or surrogate machine learning models trained on DFT data have been developed for obtaining phonon-derived heat capacities of MOFs. However, the high cost of explicit phonon computation in large and flexible nanoporous MOFs often necessitates the use of small supercells or lower convergence criteria which decrease predictive accuracy. These approximations often result in spurious imaginary phonon modes which are commonly ignored in practice. At present, there is no clear consensus in the literature on what magnitude of negative frequency or what fraction of imaginary modes can be considered acceptable. Here, we systematically demonstrate that spurious imaginary phonon modes can introduce substantial errors in heat capacity estimates, leading to incorrect ranking of MOFs in thermal-property-based screening. We further show that benchmarking machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) against DFT datasets containing spurious imaginary modes can misrepresent models that predict physically meaningful phonon spectra for dynamically stable MOFs. Finally, we introduce a simple, rapid post-processing workflow that can be applied to standard phonon calculations to effectively correct heat capacity estimates and account for spurious imaginary modes in MOFs.

Title: From equivalent Lagrangians to inequivalent open quantum system dynamics
Authors: Anirudh Gundhi, Oliviero Angeli, Angelo Bassi
Abstract: Lagrangians can differ by a total derivative without altering the equations of motion, thus encoding the same physics. This is true both classically and quantum mechanically. We show, however, that in the context of open quantum systems, two Lagrangians that differ by a total derivative can lead to inequivalent reduced dynamics. While these Lagrangians are connected via unitary transformations at the level of the global system-plus-environment description, the equivalence breaks down after tracing out the environment. We argue that only those Lagrangians for which the canonical and mechanical momenta of the system coincide lead to operationally meaningful dynamics. Applying this insight to quantum electrodynamics (QED), we derive the master equation for bremsstrahlung due to an accelerated non-relativistic electron upto second order in the interaction. The resulting reduced dynamics predicts decoherence in the position basis and closely matches the Caldeira-Leggett form, thus resolving previous discrepancies in the literature. Our findings have implications for both QED and gravitational decoherence, where similar ambiguities arise.

Title: Data-efficient and Interpretable Inverse Materials Design using a Disentangled Variational Autoencoder
Authors: Cheng Zeng, Zulqarnain Khan, Nathan L. Post
Abstract: Inverse materials design has proven successful in accelerating novel material discovery. Many inverse materials design methods use unsupervised learning where a latent space is learned to offer a compact description of materials representations. A latent space learned this way is likely to be entangled, in terms of the target property and other properties of the materials. This makes the inverse design process ambiguous. Here, we present a semi-supervised learning approach based on a disentangled variational autoencoder to learn a probabilistic relationship between features, latent variables and target properties. This approach is data efficient because it combines all labelled and unlabelled data in a coherent manner, and it uses expert-informed prior distributions to improve model robustness even with limited labelled data. It is in essence interpretable, as the learnable target property is disentangled out of the other properties of the materials, and an extra layer of interpretability can be provided by a post-hoc analysis of the classification head of the model. We demonstrate this new approach on an experimental high-entropy alloy dataset with chemical compositions as input and single-phase formation as the single target property. High-entropy alloys were chosen as example materials because of the vast chemical space of their possible combinations of compositions and atomic configurations. While single property is used in this work, the disentangled model can be extended to customize for inverse design of materials with multiple target properties.

Title: Optimal quantum algorithm for Gibbs state preparation
Authors: Cambyse Rouzé, Daniel Stilck França, Álvaro M. Alhambra
Abstract: It is of great interest to understand the thermalization of open quantum many-body systems, and how quantum computers are able to efficiently simulate that process. A recently introduced disispative evolution, inspired by existing models of open system thermalization, has been shown to be efficiently implementable on a quantum computer. Here, we prove that, at high enough temperatures, this evolution reaches the Gibbs state in time scaling logarithmically with system size. The result holds for Hamiltonians that satisfy the Lieb-Robinson bound, such as local Hamiltonians on a lattice, and includes long-range systems. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results rigorously establishing the rapid mixing property of high-temperature quantum Gibbs samplers, which is known to give the fastest possible speed for thermalization in the many-body setting. We then employ our result to the problem of estimating partition functions at high temperature, showing an improved performance over previous classical and quantum algorithms.

Title: Single-Photon Advantage in Quantum Cryptography Beyond QKD
Authors: Daniel A. Vajner, Koray Kaymazlar, Fenja Drauschke, Lucas Rickert, Martin von Helversen, Hanqing Liu, Shulun Li, Haiqiao Ni, Zhichuan Niu, Anna Pappa, Tobias Heindel
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) can be used to establish a secret key between trusted parties. Many practical use-cases in communication networks, however, involve parties who do not trust each other. A fundamental cryptographic building block for such distrustful scenarios is quantum coin flipping, which has been investigated only in few experimental studies to date, all of which used probabilistic quantum light sources imposing fundamental limitations. Here, we experimentally implement a quantum strong coin flipping protocol using single-photon states and demonstrate a quantum advantage compared to both classical realizations and implementations using faint laser pulses. We achieve this by employing a state-of-the-art deterministic quantum dot light source in combination with fast, random polarization-state encoding enabling sufficiently low quantum bit error ratio. By demonstrating a single-photon quantum advantage in a cryptographic primitive beyond QKD, our work represents a major advance towards the implementation of complex cryptographic tasks in a future quantum internet.

Title: Quantum correlation beyond entanglement: Holographic discord and multipartite generalizations
Authors: Takato Mori
Abstract: While entanglement is a cornerstone of quantum theory and holography, quantum correlations arising from superposition, such as quantum discord, offer a broader perspective that has remained largely unexplored in holography. We construct gravity duals of quantum discord and classical correlation. In both holographic systems and Haar random states, discord exceeds entanglement, revealing an additional quantum correlation linked to the Markov gap and non-distillable entanglement, suggesting holographic states are intrinsically non-bipartite. In black hole setups, discord can increase despite decoherence and persists beyond the sudden death of distillable entanglement. Motivated by the holographic formula, we define reflected discord -- an optimization-free boundary quantity based on reflected entropy -- which remains effective even outside the holographic regime. We also propose several multipartite generalizations of correlation measures. It includes holography-inspired correlations based on multi-entropy, which are shown to be UV-finite and reduce to bipartite measures in the bipartite limit. These results provide new tools for quantifying quantum correlations beyond entanglement in strongly coupled many-body systems and offer a novel approach to multipartite correlation measures.

Title: Connecting phases of matter to the flatness of the loss landscape in analog variational quantum algorithms
Authors: Kasidit Srimahajariyapong, Supanut Thanasilp, Thiparat Chotibut
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) promise near-term quantum advantage, yet parametrized quantum states commonly built from the digital gate-based approach often suffer from scalability issues such as barren plateaus, where the loss landscape becomes flat. We study an analog VQA ansätze composed of $M$ quenches of a disordered Ising chain, whose dynamics is native to several quantum simulation platforms. By tuning the disorder strength we place each quench in either a thermalized phase or a many-body-localized (MBL) phase and analyse (i) the ansätze's expressivity and (ii) the scaling of loss variance. Numerics shows that both phases reach maximal expressivity at large $M$, but barren plateaus emerge at far smaller $M$ in the thermalized phase than in the MBL phase. Exploiting this gap, we propose an MBL initialisation strategy: initialise the ansätze in the MBL regime at intermediate quench $M$, enabling an initial trainability while retaining sufficient expressivity for subsequent optimization. The results link quantum phases of matter and VQA trainability, and provide practical guidelines for scaling analog-hardware VQAs.

Title: Cosmic structure from the path integral of classical mechanics and its comparison to standard perturbation theory
Authors: Marvin Sipp, Hannes Heisler, Matthias Bartelmann
Abstract: We investigate cosmic structure formation in the framework of a path-integral formulation of an $N$-particle ensemble in phase space, dubbed Resummed Kinetic Field Theory (RKFT), up to one-loop perturbative order. In particular, we compute power spectra of the density contrast, the divergence and curl of the momentum density and arbitrary $n$-point cumulants of the stress tensor. In contrast to earlier works, we propose a different method of sampling initial conditions, with a Gaussian initial phase-space density. Doing so, we exactly reproduce the corresponding results from Eulerian standard perturbation theory (SPT) at one-loop order, showing that formerly found deviations can be fully attributed to inconsistencies in the previous sampling method. Since, in contrast to SPT, the full phase-space description does not assume a truncation of the Vlasov hierarchy, our findings suggest that nonperturbative techniques are required to accurately capture the physics of cosmic structure formation.

Title: Quantitative analysis of the effectiveness of mid-anneal measurement in quantum annealing
Authors: Keita Takahashi, Shu Tanaka
Abstract: Quantum annealing is a promising metaheuristic for solving constrained combinatorial optimization problems. However, parameter tuning difficulties and hardware noise often prevent optimal solutions from being properly encoded as the ground states of the problem Hamiltonian. This study investigates mid-anneal measurement as a mitigation approach for such situations, analyzing its effectiveness and underlying physical mechanisms. We introduce a quantitative metric to evaluate the effectiveness of mid-anneal measurement and apply it to the graph bipartitioning problem and the quadratic knapsack problem. Our findings reveal that mid-anneal measurement is most effective when the energy difference between desired solutions and ground states is small, with effectiveness strongly governed by the energy structure. Furthermore, the effectiveness increases as the Hamming distance between the ground and excited states gets small, highlighting the role of state similarity. Analysis of fully-connected Ising models demonstrates that the effectiveness of mid-anneal measurement persists with increasing system size, indicating its scalability and practical applicability to large-scale quantum annealing.

Title: Quantum metrology through spectral measurements in quantum optics
Authors: Alejandro Vivas-Viaña, Carlos Sánchez Muñoz
Abstract: Continuously monitored quantum systems are emerging as promising platforms for quantum metrology, where a central challenge is to identify measurement strategies that optimally extract information about unknown parameters encoded in the complex quantum state of emitted radiation. Different measurement strategies effectively access distinct temporal modes of the emitted field, and the resulting choice of mode can strongly impact the information available for parameter estimation. While a ubiquitous approach in quantum optics is to select frequency modes through spectral filtering, the metrological potential of this technique has not yet been systematically quantified. We develop a theoretical framework to assess this potential by modeling spectral detection as a cascaded quantum system, allowing us to reconstruct the full density matrix of frequency-filtered photonic modes and to compute their associated Fisher information. This framework provides a minimal yet general method to benchmark the performance of spectral measurements in quantum optics, allowing to identify optimal filtering strategies in terms of frequency selection, detector linewidth, and metrological gain accessible through higher-order frequency-resolved correlations and mean-field engineering. These results lay the groundwork for identifying and designing optimal sensing strategies in practical quantum-optical platforms.

Title: Entanglement and optimization within autoregressive neural quantum states
Authors: Andrew Jreissaty, Hang Zhang, Jairo C. Quijano, Juan Carrasquilla, Roeland Wiersema
Abstract: Neural quantum states (NQSs) are powerful variational ansätze capable of representing highly entangled quantum many-body wavefunctions. While the average entanglement properties of ensembles of restricted Boltzmann machines are well understood, the entanglement structure of autoregressive NQSs such as recurrent neural networks and transformers remains largely unexplored. We perform large-scale simulations of ensembles of random autoregressive wavefunctions for chains of up to $256$ spins and uncover signatures of transitions in their average entanglement scaling, entanglement spectra, and correlation functions. We show that the standard softmax normalization of the wavefunction suppresses entanglement and fluctuations, and introduce a square modulus normalization function that restores them. Finally, we connect the insights gained from our entanglement and activation function analysis to initialization strategies for finding the ground states of strongly correlated Hamiltonians via variational Monte Carlo.

Title: Variational approach to open quantum systems with long-range competing interactions
Authors: Dawid A. Hryniuk, Marzena H. Szymańska
Abstract: Competition between short- and long-range interactions underpins many emergent phenomena in nature. Despite rapid progress in their experimental control, computational methods capable of accurately simulating open quantum many-body systems with complex long-ranged interactions at scale remain scarce. Here, we address this limitation by introducing an efficient and scalable approach to dissipative quantum lattices in one and two dimensions, combining matrix product operators and time-dependent variational Monte Carlo. We showcase the versatility, effectiveness, and unique methodological advantages of our algorithm by simulating the non-equilibrium dynamics and steady states of spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ lattices with competing algebraically-decaying interactions for as many as $N=200$ sites, revealing the emergence of spatially-modulated magnetic order far from equilibrium. This approach offers promising prospects for advancing our understanding of the complex non-equilibrium properties of a diverse variety of experimentally-realizable quantum systems with long-ranged interactions, including Rydberg atoms, ultracold dipolar molecules, and trapped ions.

Title: Local fermion density in inhomogeneous free-fermion chains: a discrete WKB approach
Authors: Martín Zapata, Federico Finkel, Artemio González-López
Abstract: We introduce a novel analytical approach for studying free-fermion (XX) chains with smoothly varying, site-dependent hoppings and magnetic fields. Building on a discrete WKB-like approximation applied directly to the recurrence relation for the single-particle eigenfunctions, we derive a closed-form expression for the local fermion density profile as a function of the Fermi energy, which is valid for arbitrary fillings, hopping amplitudes and magnetic fields. This formula reproduces the depletion and saturation effects observed in previous studies of inhomogeneous free-fermion chains, and provides a theoretical framework to understand entanglement entropy suppression in these models. We demonstrate the accuracy of our asymptotic formula in several chains with different hopping and magnetic field profiles. Our findings are thus the first step towards an analytical treatment of entanglement in free-fermion chains beyond the reach of conventional field-theoretic techniques.

Title: Unitary and Nonunitary A-D-E minimal models: Coset graph fusion algebras, defects, entropies, SREEs and dilogarithm identities
Authors: Paul A. Pearce, Jared Heymann, Thomas Quella
Abstract: We consider both unitary and nonunitary A-D-E minimal models on the cylinder with topological defects along the non-contractible cycle of the cylinder. We define the coset graph $A \otimes G/\mathbb{Z}_2$ and argue that it encodes not only the (i) coset graph fusion algebra, but also (ii) the Affleck-Ludwig boundary g-factors; (iii) the defect g-factors (quantum dimensions) and (iv) the relative symmetry resolved entanglement entropy. By studying A-D-E restricted solid-on-solid models, we find that these boundary conformal field theory structures are also present on the lattice: defects (seams) are implemented by face weights with special values of the spectral parameter. Integrability allows the study of lattice transfer matrix T- and Y-system functional equations to reproduce the fusion algebra of defect lines. The effective central charges and conformal weights are expressed in terms of dilogarithms of the braid and bulk asymptotics of the Y-system expressed in terms of the quantum dimensions.

Title: Quantum dynamics of perfect fluids
Authors: Walter D. Goldberger, Petar Tadić
Abstract: We study the quantum field theory of zero temperature perfect fluids. Such systems are defined by quantizing a classical field theory of scalar fields $\phi^I$ that act as Lagrange coordinates on an internal spatial manifold of fluid configurations. Invariance under volume preserving diffeomorphisms acting on these scalars implies that the long-wavelength spectrum contains vortex (transverse modes) with an exact $\omega_T=0$ dispersion relation. As a consequence, physically interpreting the results obtained via perturbative quantization of this theory has proven to be challenging. In this paper, we show that correlators evaluated in a class of semi-classical (Gaussian) initial states prepared at $t=0$ are well-defined and accessible via perturbation theory. The width of the initial state effectively acts as an infrared regulator without explicitly breaking diffeomorphism invariance of the classical action. As an application, we compute the stress tensor two-point correlators and show that vortex modes give a non-trivial contribution to the response function, non-local in both space and time.

Title: From Disorder to Function: Entropy-Engineered Broadband Photonics with Ion-Transport-Stabilized Spectral Fidelity

Abstract: The high-entropy halide-perovskite field has expanded rapidly, yet a key gap remains: configurational entropy is not yet a reliable, designable lever to co-deliver expanded photonic functionality and operational robustness with a composition-transferable mechanistic basis. Here we develop entropy-engineered rare-earth halide double-perovskite single crystals, Cs2Na(Sb, RE)Cl6 (RE3+ = Sc3+, Er3+, Yb3+, Tm3+), that simultaneously expand near-infrared (NIR) functionality and establish a mechanistic stability rule. Near-equiatomic B(III)-site alloying yields a single-phase high-entropy solid solution (Delta_Sconfig about 1.6R). Sb3+ serves as a sensitizer that unifies excitation and cooperatively activates multiple lanthanide channels, transforming the parent single-mode response into a broadband NIR output (~850-1600 nm) with three spectrally orthogonal fingerprint bands at 996, 1220, and 1540 nm. This tri-peak, self-referenced output enables redundancy-based ratiometric solvent identification and quantitative mixture sensing with reduced susceptibility to intensity drift. Accelerated aging under humidity and oxygen shows improved phase and emission stability versus single-component analogues. DFT and molecular dynamics attribute the robustness to strongly suppressed RE$^{3+}$/Cl$^-$ self-diffusion despite comparable H$_2$O/O$_2$ adsorption, kinetically impeding ion-migration-assisted reconstruction and degradation. Integration into a phosphor-converted LED delivers spectrally stable, broadband NIR illumination, establishing entropy engineering as a practical handle to couple expanded photonic functionality with mechanistically accountable durability in metal-halide photonics.

Title: Localizable Entanglement as an Order Parameter for Measurement-Induced Phase Transitions
Authors: Sourav Manna, Arul Lakshminarayan, Vaibhav Madhok
Abstract: We identify localizable entanglement (LE) as an order parameter for measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPT). LE exhibits universal finite-size scaling with critical exponents that match previous MIPT results and gives a nice operational interpretation connecting MIPTs to classical percolation. Remarkably, we find that LE decays exponentially with distance in the area-law phase as opposed to being essentially constant for the volume-law phase thereby, discover an intrinsic length scale $\xi_E$ that diverges at the critical measurement probability $p_c$. While classical percolation transition captures successful transport across a network, MIPT as characterized by LE can be interpreted as quantifying the amount of quantum teleportation between two given nodes in a quantum circuit. Building on this insight, we propose a two-ancilla protocol that provides an experimentally accessible readout of entanglement redistribution across the transition.

Authors: Enrico Ventura, Beatrice Achilli, Luca Ambrogioni, Carlo Lucibello
Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is the de facto standard for conditional sampling in diffusion models, yet it often leads to a loss of diversity in generated samples. We formalize this phenomenon as generative distortion, defined as the mismatch between the CFG-induced sampling distribution and the true conditional distribution. Considering Gaussian mixtures and their exact scores, and leveraging tools from statistical physics, we characterize the onset of distortion in a high-dimensional regime as a function of the number of classes. Our analysis reveals that distortions emerge through a phase transition in the effective potential governing the guided dynamics. In particular, our dynamical mean-field analysis shows that distortion persists when the number of modes grows exponentially with dimension, but vanishes in the sub-exponential regime. Consistent with prior finite-dimensional results, we further demonstrate that vanilla CFG shifts the mean and shrinks the variance of the conditional distribution. We show that standard CFG schedules are fundamentally incapable of preventing variance shrinkage. Finally, we propose a theoretically motivated guidance schedule featuring a negative-guidance window, which mitigates loss of diversity while preserving class separability.

Abstract: this http URL addresses a need to gain scientific insights from 1D scientific spectra in model independent ways. A powerful approach for this is to take differences between pairs of spectra and look for meaningful changes that might indicate underlying chemical, structural, or other modifications. The challenge is that the difference curve may contain uninteresting differences such as experimental inconsistencies and benign physical changes such as the effects of thermal expansion. diffpy$.$morph allows researchers to apply simple transformations, or "morphs", to one of the datasets to remove the unwanted differences revealing, when they are present, non-trivial differences. diffpy$.$morph is an open-source Python package available on the Python Package Index and conda-forge. Here, we describe its functionality and apply it to solve a range of experimental challenges on diffraction and PDF data from x-rays and neutrons, though we note that it may be applied to any 1D function in principle.

Title: MSP-LLM: A Unified Large Language Model Framework for Complete Material Synthesis Planning
Authors: Heewoong Noh, Gyoung S. Na, Namkyeong Lee, Chanyoung Park
Abstract: Material synthesis planning (MSP) remains a fundamental and underexplored bottleneck in AI-driven materials discovery, as it requires not only identifying suitable precursor materials but also designing coherent sequences of synthesis operations to realize a target material. Although several AI-based approaches have been proposed to address isolated subtasks of MSP, a unified methodology for solving the entire MSP task has yet to be established. We propose MSP-LLM, a unified LLM-based framework that formulates MSP as a structured process composed of two constituent subproblems: precursor prediction (PP) and synthesis operation prediction (SOP). Our approach introduces a discrete material class as an intermediate decision variable that organizes both tasks into a chemically consistent decision chain. For OP, we further incorporate hierarchical precursor types as synthesis-relevant inductive biases and employ an explicit conditioning strategy that preserves precursor-related information in the autoregressive decoding state. Extensive experiments show that MSP-LLM consistently outperforms existing methods on both PP and SOP, as well as on the complete MSP task, demonstrating an effective and scalable framework for MSP that can accelerate real-world materials discovery.
