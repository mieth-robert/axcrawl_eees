Title: Echo State and Band-pass Networks with aqueous memristors: leaky reservoir computing with a leaky substrate
Authors: T.M. Kamsma, J.J. Teijema, R. van Roij, C. Spitoni
Abstract: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are extensively employed for processing sequential data such as time series. Reservoir computing (RC) has drawn attention as an RNN framework due to its fixed network that does not require training, making it an attractive for hardware based machine learning. We establish an explicit correspondence between the well-established mathematical RC implementations of Echo State Networks and Band-pass Networks with Leaky Integrator nodes on the one hand and a physical circuit containing iontronic simple volatile memristors on the other. These aqueous iontronic devices employ ion transport through water as signal carriers, and feature a voltage-dependent (memory) conductance. The activation function and the dynamics of the Leaky Integrator nodes naturally materialise as the (dynamic) conductance properties of iontronic memristors, while a simple fixed local current-to-voltage update rule at the memristor terminals facilitates the relevant matrix coupling between nodes. We process various time series, including pressure data from simulated airways during breathing that can be directly fed into the network due to the intrinsic responsiveness of iontronic devices to applied pressures. This is done while using established physical equations of motion of iontronic memristors for the internal dynamics of the circuit.

Title: An adaptive, data-driven multiscale approach for dense granular flows
Authors: B. Siddani, Weiqun Zhang, Andrew Nonaka, John Bell, Ishan Srivastava
Abstract: The accuracy of coarse-grained continuum models of dense granular flows is limited by the lack of high-fidelity closure models for granular rheology. One approach to addressing this issue, referred to as the hierarchical multiscale method, is to use a high-fidelity fine-grained model to compute the closure terms needed by the coarse-grained model. The difficulty with this approach is that the overall model can become computationally intractable due to the high computational cost of the high-fidelity model. In this work, we describe a multiscale modeling approach for dense granular flows that utilizes neural networks trained using high-fidelity discrete element method (DEM) simulations to approximate the constitutive granular rheology for a continuum incompressible flow model. Our approach leverages an ensemble of neural networks to estimate predictive uncertainty that allows us to determine whether the rheology at a given point is accurately represented by the neural network model. Additional DEM simulations are only performed when needed, minimizing the number of additional DEM simulations required when updating the rheology. This adaptive coupling significantly reduces the overall computational cost of the approach while controlling the error. In addition, the neural networks are customized to learn regularized rheological behavior to ensure well-posedness of the continuum solution. We first validate the approach using two-dimensional steady-state and decelerating inclined flows. We then demonstrate the efficiency of our approach by modeling three-dimensional sub-aerial granular column collapse for varying initial column aspect ratios, where our multiscale method compares well with the computationally expensive computational fluid dynamics (CFD)-DEM simulation.

Title: The evolution of invasion patterns due to surfactant adsorption in anomalous pore distribution: Role of Mass Transfer and Laplace Pressure
Authors: Debanik Bhattacharjee, Guy Z. Ramon, Yaniv Edery
Abstract: Here, we develop a time-dependent pore network model (PNM) to simulate the effects of surfactant-induced IFT reduction on immiscible displacement driven by constant inlet pressure, with pressure drops across the network calculated using a random resistor network and mass conservation equations. Node-specific flux and velocity are derived using the Hagen-Poiseuille equation, and surfactant adsorption is modeled using the Langmuir isotherm, capturing its impact on fluid-fluid and solid-fluid interfaces within the invaded path. Since the evolution of the invasion pattern comprises the cooperative mechanisms of surfactant mass transfer to the interfaces and the resulting changes in capillary and Laplace pressures, we employ two strategies to quantify this complex feedback behavior: mass transfer-based, introducing a mass transfer timescale, and Laplace pressure-based, scaling with the inlet pressure. Results reveal that an anomalous or heavy-tailed pore throat distribution accelerates the onset of secondary invasions, which enhances the dominance of Laplace pressure. As the distribution becomes less anomalous or more symmetric, mass transfer becomes the dominant mechanism. This interplay highlights the intricate balance between mass transfer and capillary effects in governing the spatio-temporal evolution of immiscible fluid invasion.

Title: Drainage front width in a three-dimensional random porous medium under gravitational and capillary effects
Authors: Paula Reis, Knut Jørgen Måløy
Abstract: A theoretical approach to estimating stable drainage front widths in three-dimensional random porous media under gravitational and capillary effects is presented. Based on the frontier of the infinite cluster in gradient percolation, we propose an expression for the 3D front width dependent on the pore-network topology, the distribution of capillary pressure thresholds for the pore throats, the stabilizing capillary pressure gradient, the average pore size, and the correlation length critical exponent from percolation in three dimensions. Theoretical predictions are successfully compared to numerical results obtained with a bond invasion-percolation model for a wide range of drainage flow parameters.

Title: Long-term microgravity experiments reveal a new mechanism for particle aggregation in suspension
Authors: Fabian Kleischmann, Bernhard Vowinckel, Eckart Meiburg, Paolo Luzzatto-Fegiz
Abstract: Microgravity experiments on board the International Space Station, combined with particle-resolved direct numerical simulations, were conducted to investigate the long-term flocculation behavior of clay suspensions in saline water in the absence of gravity. After an initial homogenization of the suspensions, different clay compositions were continuously monitored for 99 days, allowing a detailed analysis of aggregate growth through image processing. The results indicate that the onboard oscillations (g-jitter) may have accelerated the aggregation process. Aggregate growth driven by these oscillations is found to occur at a faster rate than aggregation caused by Brownian motion. This effect is further confirmed by numerical simulations, which also demonstrated that parameters such as the oscillation amplitude and the solid volume fraction influence growth acceleration. These findings highlight that oscillations may act as a previously unrecognized mechanism that contributes to particle aggregation in fluids.

Title: Genetic Algorithm-Accelerated Computational Discovery of Liquid Crystal Polymers with Enhanced Optical Properties
Authors: Jianing Zhou, Yuge Huang, Arman Boromand, Keian Noori, Lafe Purvis, Chulwoo Oh, Lu Lu, Zachary W. Ulissi, Vahe Gharakhanyan, Xinyue Zhang
Abstract: Liquid crystal polymers with exceptional optical properties are highly promising for next-generation virtual, augmented, and mixed reality (VR/AR/MR) technologies, serving as high-performance, compact, lightweight, and cost-effective optical components. However, the growing demands for optical transparency and high refractive index in advanced optical devices present a challenge for material discovery. In this study, we develop a novel approach that integrates first-principles calculations with genetic algorithms to accelerate the discovery of liquid crystal polymers with low visible absorption and high refractive index. By iterating within a predefined space of molecular building blocks, our approach rapidly identifies reactive mesogens that meet target specifications. Additionally, it provides valuable insights into the relationships between molecular structure and properties. This strategy not only accelerates material screening but also uncovers key molecular design principles, offering a systematic and scalable alternative to traditional trial-and-error methods.

Title: Evaluation of the Influence of Structural Parameters on the Mechanical Properties of Foam Glasses via In-Situ Micro-CT Mechanical Testing
Authors: Mateus Gruener Lima, Tobias Günther, Thu Trang Võ, Eduardo Inocente Jussiani, Dirk Enke, Urs A. Peuker, Ralf B. Wehrspohn, Juliana Martins de Souza e Silva
Abstract: Foam glass made from waste glass has high chemical and mechanical stability and flexible structural properties, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. To ensure its reliability, it is essential to understand its mechanical properties and fracture mechanisms. In this study, we investigated morphological features related to pore structure alongside mechanical properties, specifically Young's modulus and compressive strength, of three different monolithic foam glass samples using micro-computed tomography combined with ex-situ and in-situ uniaxial compression experiments and Digital Volume Correlation (DVC) analysis. The foam glasses exhibit an inverse relationship between mechanical strength and factors such as wall thickness, porosity, pore size and irregularity, with the compressive strength following a power-law correlation with the proportion of large pores. The multi-peak behavior of the stress-strain curves indicates micro-cracking within the porous lattice. Micro-CT data show that damage is concentrated at the upper and lower extremes of the specimens, and that the applied strain induces changes in the porosity, mean pore diameter, and pore sphericity, driven by deformation and collapse of the pore structures. DVC analysis quantitatively validated these observations.

Title: Impact of Acid Hydrolysis on Morphology, Rheology, Mechanical Properties, and Processing of Thermoplastic Starch
Authors: Saffana Kouka, Veronika Gajdosova, Beata Strachota, Ivana Sloufova, Radomir Kuzel, Zdenek Stary, Miroslav Slouf
Abstract: We modified native wheat starch using 15, 30, and 60 min of acid hydrolysis (AH). The non-modified and AH-modified starches were converted to highly-homogeneous thermo-plastic starches (TPS) using our two-step preparation protocol consisting of solution cast-ing and melt-mixing. Our main objective was to verify if the AH can decrease the pro-cessing temperature of TPS. All samples were characterized in detail by microscopic, spectroscopic, diffraction, thermomechanical, rheological, and micromechanical methods, including in situ measurements of torque and temperature during the final melt-mixing step. The experimental results showed that: (i) the AH decreased the average molecular weight preferentially in the amorphous regions, (ii) the lower-viscosity matrix in the AH-treated starches resulted in slightly higher crystallinity, and (iii) all AH-modified TPS with less viscous amorphous phase and higher content of crystalline phase exhibited similar properties. The effect of the higher crystallinity predominated at laboratory tem-perature and low deformations, resulting in slightly stiffer material. The effect of the low-er-viscosity dominated during the melt mixing, where the shorter molecules acted as a lubricant and decreased the in situ measured processing temperature. The AH-induced decrease in the processing temperature could be beneficial for energy savings and/or pos-sible temperature-sensitive admixtures to TPS systems.

Title: Polymer Data Challenges in the AI Era: Bridging Gaps for Next-Generation Energy Materials
Authors: Ying Zhao, Guanhua Chen, Jie Liu
Abstract: The pursuit of advanced polymers for energy technologies, spanning photovoltaics, solid-state batteries, and hydrogen storage, is hindered by fragmented data ecosystems that fail to capture the hierarchical complexity of these materials. Polymer science lacks interoperable databases, forcing reliance on disconnected literature and legacy records riddled with unstructured formats and irreproducible testing protocols. This fragmentation stifles machine learning (ML) applications and delays the discovery of materials critical for global decarbonization. Three systemic barriers compound the challenge. First, academic-industrial data silos restrict access to proprietary industrial datasets, while academic publications often omit critical synthesis details. Second, inconsistent testing methods undermine cross-study comparability. Third, incomplete metadata in existing databases limits their utility for training reliable ML models. Emerging solutions address these gaps through technological and collaborative innovation. Natural language processing (NLP) tools extract structured polymer data from decades of literature, while high-throughput robotic platforms generate self-consistent datasets via autonomous experimentation. Central to these advances is the adoption of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles, adapted to polymer-specific ontologies, ensuring machine-readability and reproducibility. Future breakthroughs hinge on cultural shifts toward open science, accelerated by decentralized data markets and autonomous laboratories that merge robotic experimentation with real-time ML validation. By addressing data fragmentation through technological innovation, collaborative governance, and ethical stewardship, the polymer community can transform bottlenecks into accelerants.

Title: Simulating non-Brownian suspensions with non-homogeneous Navier slip boundary conditions
Authors: Daniela Moreno-Chaparro, Florencio Balboa Usabiaga, Nicolas Moreno, Marco Ellero
Abstract: Fluid-structure interactions are commonly modeled using no-slip boundary conditions. However, small deviations from these conditions can significantly alter the dynamics of suspensions and particles, especially at the micro and nano scales. This work presents a robust implicit numerical method for simulating non-colloidal suspensions with non-homogeneous Navier slip boundary conditions. Our approach is based on a regularized boundary integral formulation, enabling accurate and efficient computation of hydrodynamic interactions. This makes the method well-suited for large-scale simulations. We validate the method by comparing computed drag forces on homogeneous and Janus particles with analytical results. Additionally, we consider the effective viscosity of suspensions with varying slip lengths, benchmarking against available analytical no-slip and partial-slip theories.

Title: Autonomous nanoparticle synthesis by design
Authors: Andy S. Anker, Jonas H. Jensen, Miguel Gonzalez-Duque, Rodrigo Moreno, Aleksandra Smolska, Mikkel Juelsholt, Vincent Hardion, Mads R. V. Jorgensen, Andres Faina, Jonathan Quinson, Kasper Stoy, Tejs Vegge
Abstract: Controlled synthesis of materials with specified atomic structures underpins technological advances yet remains reliant on iterative, trial-and-error approaches. Nanoparticles (NPs), whose atomic arrangement dictates their emergent properties, are particularly challenging to synthesise due to numerous tunable parameters. Here, we introduce an autonomous approach explicitly targeting synthesis of atomic-scale structures. Our method autonomously designs synthesis protocols by matching real time experimental total scattering (TS) and pair distribution function (PDF) data to simulated target patterns, without requiring prior synthesis knowledge. We demonstrate this capability at a synchrotron, successfully synthesising two structurally distinct gold NPs: 5 nm decahedral and 10 nm face-centred cubic structures. Ultimately, specifying a simulated target scattering pattern, thus representing a bespoke atomic structure, and obtaining both the synthesised material and its reproducible synthesis protocol on demand may revolutionise materials design. Thus, ScatterLab provides a generalisable blueprint for autonomous, atomic structure-targeted synthesis across diverse systems and applications.

Title: Interplay of magnetic textures with spin-orbit coupled substrates
Authors: Zachary Llewellyn, Eric Mascot, Oleg A. Tretiakov, Stephan Rachel
Abstract: Magnetic textures such as skyrmions in thin films grown on substrates possess significant technological potential. Inhomogeneous magnetic structures can be described as homogeneous ferromagnetic order in the presence of anisotropic spin-orbit coupling (SOC). It remains unexplored, however, how this {\it induced} SOC stemming from the magnetic textures interacts with the SOC of the substrate. Here we show that these two contributions to SOC are in general {\it not} additive. We demonstrate this by employing a spintronics gauge theory. We further compute local currents which, when considered in the proper frame, match the spintronics gauge theory results. Finally, we analyze global transport quantities and show that they substantiate our previous results quantitatively. The implications for skyrmionics as well as topological superconductivity are discussed.

Title: String-Membrane-Nets from Higher-Form Gauging: An Alternate Route to $p$-String Condensation
Authors: Pranay Gorantla, Abhinav Prem, Nathanan Tantivasadakarn, Dominic J. Williamson
Abstract: We present a new perspective on the $p$-string condensation procedure for constructing 3+1D fracton phases by implementing this process via the gauging of higher-form symmetries. Specifically, we show that gauging a 1-form symmetry in 3+1D that is generated by Abelian anyons in isotropic stacks of 2+1D topological orders naturally results in a 3+1D $p$-string condensed phase, providing a controlled non-perturbative construction that realizes fracton orders. This approach clarifies the symmetry principles underlying $p$-string condensation and generalizes the familiar connection between anyon condensation and one-form gauging in two spatial dimensions. We demonstrate this correspondence explicitly in both field theories and lattice models: in field theory, we derive the foliated field theory description of the $\mathbb{Z}_N$ X-Cube model by gauging a higher-form symmetry in stacks of 2+1D $\mathbb{Z}_N$ gauge theories; on the lattice, we show how gauging a diagonal 1-form symmetry in isotropic stacks of $G$-graded string-net models leads to string-membrane-nets hosting restricted mobility excitations. This perspective naturally generalizes to spatial dimensions $d \geq 2$ and provides a step towards building an algebraic theory of $p$-string condensation.

Title: Quasiparticles and optical conductivity in the mixed state of Weyl superconductors with unconventional pairing
Authors: Zhihai Liu, Luyang Wang
Abstract: Previous investigations have revealed that the Weyl superconductor (WeylSC) and the two-dimensional (2D) nodal superconductor, realized through a topological insulator-superconductor heterostructure, can exhibit a Dirac-like Landau level (LL) structure that scales with $\sqrt{n}$ in the presence of a vortex lattice, where $n$ is the index of the LLs. Here, we investigate the excitation spectrum in the mixed state of WeylSCs with unconventional pairing and find that, unlike in the spin-singlet case, QP bands for the spin-triplet pairing show surprising dispersion, except for the chiral symmetry-protected, dispersionless zeroth Landau level (ZLL). Different pairing symmetries in WeylSCs also result in distinct magneto-optical responses, manifested as characterized magneto-optical conductivity curves. We also reveal that, compared to the topologically protected, charge-neutral, localized Majorana zero mode (MZM), the chiral symmetry-protected ZLL is non-charge-neutral and delocalized. Both of these zero modes may be observed in the vortex of a superconductor heterostructure.

Title: Bootstrapping Nonequilibrium Stochastic Processes
Authors: Minjae Cho
Abstract: We show that bootstrap methods based on the positivity of probability measures provide a systematic framework for studying both synchronous and asynchronous nonequilibrium stochastic processes on infinite lattices. First, we formulate linear programming problems that use positivity and invariance property of invariant measures to derive rigorous bounds on their expectation values. Second, for time evolution in asynchronous processes, we exploit the master equation along with positivity and initial conditions to construct linear and semidefinite programming problems that yield bounds on expectation values at both short and late times. We illustrate both approaches using two canonical examples: the contact process in 1+1 and 2+1 dimensions, and the Domany-Kinzel model in both synchronous and asynchronous forms in 1+1 dimensions. Our bounds on invariant measures yield rigorous lower bounds on critical rates, while those on time evolutions provide two-sided bounds on the half-life of the infection density and the temporal correlation length in the subcritical phase.

Title: Classical Criticality via Quantum Annealing
Authors: Pratik Sathe, Andrew D. King, Susan M. Mniszewski, Carleton Coffrin, Cristiano Nisoli, Francesco Caravelli
Abstract: Quantum annealing provides a powerful platform for simulating magnetic materials and realizing statistical physics models, presenting a compelling alternative to classical Monte Carlo methods. We demonstrate that quantum annealers can accurately reproduce phase diagrams and simulate critical phenomena without suffering from the critical slowing down that often affects classical algorithms. To illustrate this, we study the piled-up dominoes model, which interpolates between the ferromagnetic 2D Ising model and Villain's fully frustrated ``odd model''. We map out its phase diagram and for the first time, employ finite-size scaling and Binder cumulants on a quantum annealer to study critical exponents for thermal phase transitions. Our method achieves systematic temperature control by tuning the energy scale of the Hamiltonian, eliminating the need to adjust the physical temperature of the quantum hardware. This work demonstrates how, through fine-tuning and calibration, a quantum annealer can be employed to apply sophisticated finite-size scaling techniques from statistical mechanics. Our results establish quantum annealers as robust statistical physics simulators, offering a novel pathway for studying phase transitions and critical behavior.

Title: Single-photon detection enabled by negative differential conductivity in moiré superlattices
Authors: Krystian Nowakowski, Hitesh Agarwal, Sergey Slizovskiy, Robin Smeyers, Xueqiao Wang, Zhiren Zheng, Julien Barrier, David Barcons Ruiz, Geng Li, Riccardo Bertini, Matteo Ceccanti, Iacopo Torre, Bert Jorissen, Antoine Reserbat-Plantey, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Lucian Covaci, Milorad V. Milošević, Vladimir Fal'ko, Pablo Jarillo-Herrero, Roshan Krishna Kumar, Frank H. L. Koppens
Abstract: Detecting individual light quanta is essential for quantum information, space exploration, advanced machine vision, and fundamental science. Here, we introduce a novel single photon detection mechanism using highly photosensitive non-equilibrium electron phases in moiré materials. Using tunable bands in bilayer graphene/hexagonal-boron nitride superlattices, we engineer negative differential conductance and a sensitive bistable state capable of detecting single photons. Operating in this regime, we demonstrate single-photon counting at mid-infrared (11.3 microns) and visible wavelengths (675 nanometres) and temperatures up to 25 K. This detector offers new prospects for broadband, high-temperature quantum technologies with CMOS compatibility and seamless integration into photonic integrated circuits (PICs). Our analysis suggests the mechanism underlying our device operation originates from negative differential velocity, and represents an important milestone in the field of high-bias transport in two-dimensional moiré quantum materials.

Title: Boundary-condition-assisted chiral-symmetry protection of the zeroth Landau level on a two-dimensional lattice
Authors: A. Donís Vela, C.W.J. Beenakker
Abstract: The massless two-dimensional Dirac equation in a perpendicular magnetic field B supports a B-independent "zeroth Landau level", a dispersionless zero-energy-mode protected by chiral symmetry. On a lattice the zero-mode becomes doubly degenerate with states of opposite chirality, which removes the protection and allows for a broadening when the magnetic field is non-uniform. It is known that this fundamental obstruction can be avoided by spatially separating the doubly degenerate states, adjoining +B and -B regions in a system of twice the size. Here we show that the same objective can be achieved without doubling the system size. The key ingredients are 1) a chirality-preserving "tangent fermion" discretization of the Dirac equation; and 2) a boundary condition that ensures the zero-mode contains only states of a single chirality.

Title: Symmetry-Driven Trimer Formation in Kagome Correlated Electron Materials
Authors: Varsha Kumari, Julia Bauer, Alexandru B. Georgescu
Abstract: Correlated electron materials with molecular orbital states extending over transition metal clusters can host multiferroicity, spin frustration, and unconventional insulating phases. However, the fundamental criteria that govern cluster formation and stability remain unclear. Here, we identify a symmetry, correlation, and electron filling driven criteria that stabilize triangular metal trimers in materials displaying transition metal kagome patterns. Using density functional theory and chemical bonding analysis, we show that trimer formation emerges when 6 to 8 electrons occupy molecular orbitals derived from transition metal d-states, achieving near complete filling of bonding states while avoiding antibonding occupation, and correlations are of intermediate strength. This principle explains the stability of Nb$_3$X$_8$ (X = Cl, Br, I), and more broadly, our findings offer a general design rule to obtain quantum materials with quantum states extended across transition metal clusters.

Title: Combined tight-binding and configuration interaction study of unfolded electronic structure of G-color center in Si
Authors: Jakub Valdhans, Petr Klenovský
Abstract: We have theoretically studied the G-center in bulk silicon material using the empirical tight-binding model for calculations of unfolded band structures with configuration interaction correction for the exciton at $\Gamma$ point of the Brillouin zone. The G-center in B configuration (emissive) being a candidate structure as the telecom single- and entangled-photon source has two substitutional carbons and one interstitial atom embedded into the bulk in six equally possible configurations. Taking the advantage of the low computation effort of the tight-binding and unfolding approach, it is possible to calculate and analyze the behavior of a variety of the electronic configurations. Our tight-binding model is able to describe not only the behavior of the G-center in the silicon bulk but using the unfolding approach it can also pinpoint the contributions of different elements of the supercell on the final pseudo-band structure. Moreover, the configuration interaction correction with single-particle basis states computed by our unfolded tight-binding model predicts a very small fine-structure splitting of the ground state exciton both for bright and dark doublet in the studied system. That underscores the possibility of the silicon G-center to become a very good emitter of single and entangled photons for quantum communication and computation applications.

Title: Temperature dependence of coercivity for isolated Ni nanowires unraveled by high-sensitivity micromagnetometry
Authors: Evelyn A. Escudero Bruna, Federico Romá, Fernando Meneses, Paula. G. Bercoff, Moira I. Dolz
Abstract: Magnetic nanowires are critical components in fields such as data storage and spintronics, where precise control of their magnetic properties is essential for device optimization. In particular, the behavior of isolated nanowires is often different from that of an ensemble, offering an opportunity to explore the role that dipolar and magnetoelastic interactions play in the latter system. Unfortunately, the comparison between a collection of nanowires and single ones is often poorly characterized, as measuring individual nanowires with weak magnetic signals is a challenging task. In this work, we employ a highly-sensitive micromechanical torsional oscillator to measure the magnetic response of few individual Ni nanowires with 72 +/- 5 nm average diameter, fabricated by electrodeposition in anodic aluminum oxide templates as an array and subsequently released from this membrane. When comparing the magnetic properties as a function of temperature between single nanowires and the array, we show that coercivity values of individual nanowires are at least twice as large as for the array in the range 5 K - 200 K. Also, we characterize the differences in the hysteresis loops, which are more squared for isolated nanowires, with a high magnetic remanence close to 80 % of the saturation value. Our results highlight the crucial role of dipolar and mechanical interactions in modifying the magnetic behavior of nanowires arrays, providing valuable insights for the design and application of nanowires-based magnetic devices.

Title: Solving Lyapunov equations for electrically driven ternary electrolytes -- application to long-range van der Waals interactions
Authors: Guangle Du, Bing Miao, David S. Dean
Abstract: Stochastic density functional theory (SDFT) has been widely used to study the out of equilibrium properties of electrolyte solutions. Examples include investigations of electrical conductivity -- both within and beyond linear response -- and modifications of thermal van der Waals interactions in driven electrolytes. Within the approximation scheme derived from linearizing SDFT for fluctuations around mean densities, the steady state correlation functions between the $N$ ionic species are governed by linear Lyapunov equations of degree $N(N+1)/2$. Consequently, the system's complexity increases significantly when transitioning from binary to ternary electrolytes, and few analytical results exist for the latter. In this paper, we demonstrate how -- for the specific case of electrolytes -- the Lyapunov equations can be reduced to a system of $N$ linear equations. We apply this reduction to compute the long-range component of the van der Waals interaction between two slabs containing a ternary electrolyte under an applied electric field parallel to the slabs. Unlike the binary electrolyte case, we show that the resulting van der Waals interaction for a ternary electrolyte depends on the ionic species' diffusion coefficients, highlighting its inherently out of equilibrium nature.

Title: Early Stages of Self-Healing at Tungsten Grain Boundaries from Ab Initio Machine Learning Simulations
Authors: Jorge Suárez-Recio, Pablo M. Piaggi, Francisco J. Domínguez-Gutiérrez, Raquel Gonzalez-Arrabal, Roberto Iglesias
Abstract: Nanostructured tungsten has been reported as a possible alternative plasma-facing material due to its potential ability to self-heal radiation-induced defects, a property that is attributed to its high density of grain boundaries (GB). Here, we study the initial stages of self-healing at tungsten interfaces with molecular dynamics simulations driven by a machine-learning interatomic potential tailored to one of the most common GBs found in experiments. Our model accurately reproduces the ab initio potential energy surface derived from density functional theory (DFT) calculations and outperforms previously reported empirical interatomic potentials in predicting defect energetics. The simulations reveal low-temperature defect migration to GBs driven by rapid dumbbell-like ordering and subsequent accommodation along GB grooves. In contrast to empirical potentials, which predict unexpected GB degradation at high temperatures after defect migration, our model maintains stable GB motifs over the investigated temperature range. The temperature-dependent defect counts, evaluated using an Arrhenius-like fit, yield an average interstitial migration energy of 0.048 eV, in agreement with experiment. This work underscores the capabilities of ab initio machine learning simulations in accurately modeling defect-GB interactions and highlights their potential to contribute to the development of radiation tolerant materials.

Title: Probing and Tuning Strain-localized Exciton Emission in 2D Material Bubbles at Room Temperature
Authors: Junze Zhou, John Thomas, Thomas P. Darlington, Edward S. Barnard, Atsushi Taguchi, Adam Schwartzberg, Alexander Weber-Bargioni
Abstract: Excitons in 2D material bubbles-nanoscale deformations in atomically thin materials, typically exhibiting a dome-like shape-are confined by the strain effect, exhibiting extraordinary emission properties, such as single photon generation, enhanced light emission, and spectrally tunable excitonic states. While the strain profiles of these bubbles have been extensively studied, this work provides an approach (1) to directly visualize the associated exciton properties, revealing an intrinsic emission wavelength shift of approximately 40 nm, and (2) actively modify local strain, enabling further exciton emission tuning over a range of 50 nm. These are achieved by emission mapping and nanoindentation using a dielectric near-field probe, which enables the detection of local emission spectra and emission lifetimes within individual bubbles. Statistical analysis of 67 bubbles uncovers an emission wavelength distribution centered around 780 nm. Furthermore, saturation behavior in the power-dependent studies and the associated lifetime change reveal the localized nature of the strain-induced states. These findings provide direct insights into the strain-localized emission dynamics in bubbles and establish a robust framework for non-destructive, reversible, and predictable nanoscale emission control, presenting a potential avenue for developing next-generation tunable quantum optical sources.

Title: Active-Spin-State-Derived Descriptor for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction Catalysis
Authors: Yu Tan, Lei Li, Zi-Xuan Yang, Tao Huang, Qiao-Ling Wang, Tao Zhang, Jing-Chun Luo, Gui-Fang Huang, Wangyu Hu, Wei-Qing Huang
Abstract: Spin states are pivotal in modulating the electrocatalytic activity of transition-metal (TM)-based compounds, yet quantitatively evaluating the activity-spin state correlation remains a formidable challenge. Here, we propose an 'activity index n' as a descriptor, to assess the activity of the spin states for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). n descriptor integrates three key electronic parameters: the proportion (P), broadening range (R) and center cc of active spin state, which collectively account for the electronic structure modulation induced by both the intrinsic active site and its local coordination environment. Using 1T-phase ZrSe2-anchored TM atoms (TM=Sc to Ni) as prototypes, we reveal that the correlation between Gibbs free energy and the n value follows a linear relation, namely, the vGH reduces as the n decreases. Notably, ZrSe2-Mn exhibits the optimal n value (-0.56), corresponding the best HER activity with a vGH of 0.04 eV closer to the thermoneutral ideal value (0 eV) than even Pt (vGH = -0.09 eV). This relationship suggests that n is the effective descriptor of active spin state for HER of TM-based catalysts. Our study brings fundamental insights into the HER activity-spin state correlation, offering new strategies for HER catalyst design.

Title: Substrate Effect on Electronic Band Structure and Topological Property in Monolayer V2O3 Magnetic Topological Insulator
Authors: Zheng Wang, Kaixuan Chen, Shu-Shen Lyu
Abstract: Monolayer V2O3, a two-dimensional magnetic topological insulator with intrinsic ferromagnetic order and a nontrivial band gap, offers a promising platform for realizing quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) states. Using first-principles density functional theory calculations, we systematically investigate the impact of substrate selection on its electronic and topological properties. By modeling heterostructures with van der Waals (vdW) substrates, we demonstrate that non-magnetic substrates such as h-BN preserve the QAH phase with a Chern number C = 1, maintaining gapless chiral edge states. In contrast, ferromagnetic substrates induce extra electrons, destroying the topological order by shifting the Fermi level. These findings establish substrate engineering as a pivotal strategy for experimental realization of dissipationless edge transport in V2O3-based vdW heterostructures, advancing their potential applications as low-power topological electronics.

Title: Lorentz force on superconducting vortices near line defects
Authors: Ruby A. Shi
Abstract: In type-II superconductors, magnetic flux penetrates in the form of quantized vortices whose dissipative motion, driven by the Lorentz force, can degrade superconductivity. Understanding vortex dynamics in both homogeneous regions and near unavoidable structural defects is crucial for superconducting applications. This study examines a scenario in which a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) scans across a thin-film superconductor containing line defects. We first estimate the radial Lorentz force on a vortex in a homogeneous region using both analytical methods and numerical simulations based on the fast Fourier transform algorithm. For a film with a Pearl length of 400 micrometers and a SQUID height of 4 micrometers, we find that the SQUID tip can exert a force of approximately 3 femtonewtons on a vortex. We then evaluate the Lorentz force on vortices near two parallel line defects. Our results show that the Lorentz force is enhanced for vortices pinned on or between line defects. Vortices pinned on the line defects experience force enhancement predominantly perpendicular to the defects, while vortices in between experience enhancement along the defect direction. These findings enable more accurate estimation of Lorentz forces on vortices near line defects in thin-film superconductors and contribute to the broader understanding of vortex pinning and dynamics in defect-engineered superconductors. The methods can be extended to bulk superconductors and generalized to other defect geometries.

Title: Experimental and theoretical studies of WO3-Vulcan XC-72 electrocatalyst enhanced H2O2 yield ORR performed in acid and alkaline medium
Authors: João Paulo C Moura, Lanna EB Lucchetti, Caio M Fernandes, Aline B Trench, Camila N Lange, Bruno L Batista, James M Almeida, Mauro C Santos
Abstract: The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) plays a pivotal role in clean energy generation and sustainable chemical production, particularly in the synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H\textsubscript{2}O\textsubscript{2}). In this study, WO\textsubscript{3}/Vulcan-XC72 electrocatalysts were synthesized and characterized for ORR applications, evaluating the WO\textsubscript{3} to Vulcan-XC72 ratio and examining electrolyte pH effects across acidic and alkaline media. Structural characterization confirmed successful synthesis of monoclinic WO\textsubscript{3} with nanoflower morphology, which enhanced surface hydrophilicity and oxygen functional groups. Electrochemical tests demonstrated WO\textsubscript{3}/C's superior H\textsubscript{2}O\textsubscript{2} selectivity compared to pure Vulcan-XC72 in both media, revealing a pH-dependent ORR mechanism. Using WO\textsubscript{3}/C gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs), we achieved 862,mg,L\textsuperscript{-1} H\textsubscript{2}O\textsubscript{2} accumulation after 120,min at 100,mA,cm\textsuperscript{-2}. The enhanced performance stems from increased oxygen functional groups, improved hydrophilicity, and WO\textsubscript{3} nanoflower synergistic effects, as supported by theoretical calculations, establishing WO\textsubscript{3}/Vulcan as a promising catalyst for electrochemical H\textsubscript{2}O\textsubscript{2} production.

Title: Deeply Nonlinear Magnonic Directional Coupler
Authors: Xu Ge, Roman Verba, Philipp Pirro, Andrii V. Chumak, Qi Wang
Abstract: Dipolar coupling between closely spaced magnetic waveguides enables the design of magnonic directional couplers - universal devices capable of functioning as signal combiners, power splitters, demultiplexers, and more. The wavelength-dependent coupling, combined with the weak nonlinear variation of a spin wave's wavelength at constant-frequency, introduces power-dependent characteristics of directional couplers. This property has been leveraged in the development of magnonic logic elements and other applications. Here, we explore another nonlinear phenomenon in a directional coupler arising purely from the nonlinear frequency shift of spin waves. We show that a strong nonlinear frequency shift causes the coupler to behave as if composed of nonidentical waveguides, suppressing the energy transfer between the waveguides. The transition from complete to negligible energy transfer exhibits a sharp threshold behavior, where the critical power is determined by the coupling strength and nonlinear frequency shift parameter. Based on these findings, a switchable directional coupler as a critical component for future integrated magnonic circuits is designed and validated by micromagnetic simulations.

Title: Physics-Guided Sequence Modeling for Fast Simulation and Design Exploration of 2D Memristive Devices
Authors: Benjamin Spetzler, Elizaveta Spetzler, Saba Zamankhani, Dilara Abdel, Patricio Farrell, Kai-Uwe Sattler, Martin Ziegler
Abstract: Modeling hysteretic switching dynamics in memristive devices is computationally demanding due to coupled ionic and electronic transport processes. This challenge is particularly relevant for emerging two-dimensional (2D) devices, which feature high-dimensional design spaces that remain largely unexplored. We introduce a physics-guided modeling framework that integrates high-fidelity finite-volume (FV) charge transport simulations with a long short-term memory (LSTM) artificial neural network (ANN) to predict dynamic current-voltage behavior. Trained on physically grounded simulation data, the ANN surrogate achieves more than four orders of magnitude speedup compared to the FV model, while maintaining direct access to physically meaningful input parameters and high accuracy with typical normalized errors <1%. This enables iterative tasks that were previously computationally prohibitive, including inverse modeling from experimental data, design space exploration via metric mapping and sensitivity analysis, as well as constrained multi-objective design optimization. Importantly, the framework preserves physical interpretability via access to detailed spatial dynamics, including carrier densities, vacancy distributions, and electrostatic potentials, through a direct link to the underlying FV model. Our approach establishes a scalable framework for efficient exploration, interpretation, and model-driven design of emerging 2D memristive and neuromorphic devices.

Title: Significant Enhancement of Carrier Mobility in Finite vs. Infinite Square Quantum Wells: A Comparative Study of GaAs/In$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$As/GaAs Heterostructures
Authors: Truong Van Tuan, Nguyen Dung Chinh, Tran Trong Tai, Vo Van Tai, Nguyen Duy Vy
Abstract: The geometry of quantum wells (QWs) critically influences carrier mobility, yet systematic comparisons between finite and infinite square QWs remain scarce. We present a comprehensive study of GaAs/In$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$As/GaAs heterostructures using a variational-subband-wave-function model, analyzing key scattering mechanisms: remote impurities (RI), alloy disorder (AD), surface roughness (SR), acoustic (ac) and piezoelectric (PE) phonons, and longitudinal optical (LO) phonons. The mobility ratio $R=\mu_{fin}/\mu_{inf}$ reveals distinct trends: $R_{RI}$ and $R_{LO}<$ 1 (long-range Coulomb/inelastic scattering), while $R_{AD}$, $R_{ac}$, $R_{PE}$, $R_{SR}>$ 1 (static potentials). Finite QWs achieve higher mobility at low temperatures (77 K), narrow widths ($<$ 100 Å), and low densities, enhanced by high indium content. Conversely, infinite QWs outperform at 300 K due to dominant LO scattering. These findings provide actionable guidelines for optimizing QW-based devices such as HEMTs and lasers across operational regimes.

Title: Modulating Thermometric Performance via Dopant Concentration and Morphology in Luminescence Thermometer Exhibiting Dual Structural Phase Transitions
Authors: Malgorzata Kubicka, Maja Szymczak, Maciej Ptak, Damian Szymanski, Vasyl Kinzhybahlo, Marek Drozd, Lukasz Marciniak
Abstract: Expanding the operational range of luminescent thermometers that utilize thermally induced structural phase transitions in lanthanide-doped materials necessitates the exploration of novel host matrices with diverse thermal behaviors. In line with this objective, the present study offers a comprehensive analysis of the temperature-dependent spectroscopic properties of Li3Sc2(PO4)3:Eu3+. The findings reveal that the studied material undergoes two reversible phase transitions: {\gamma}LT - {\alpha}/\b{eta} phase transition at approximately 160 K, followed by an \b{eta} HT transition around 550 K. These transitions are evidenced by notable alterations in the emission spectra and luminescence decay kinetics of Eu3+ ions. By employing an appropriate luminescence intensity ratio, the sensitivity was determined to be 7.8 % K-1 at 160 K for 0.1%Eu3+ and 0.65 % K-1 at 550 K for 0.5%Eu3+. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that the phase transition temperature in Li3Sc2(PO4)3:Eu3+ can be modulated through variations in dopant ion concentration and annealing conditions, which in turn influence the material's morphology. These strategies enable the fine-tuning of thermometric performance in phase transition-based luminescent thermometers. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first report in the literature of a luminescent thermometer exhibiting dual thermal operating ranges.

Title: Micromagnetic Study of the Dipolar-Exchange Spin Waves in Antiferromagnetic Thin Films
Authors: Jiongjie Wang, Jiang Xiao
Abstract: In antiferromagnets, dipolar coupling is often disregarded due to the cancellation of magnetic moments between the two sublattices, leaving spin-wave dispersion predominantly determined by exchange interactions. However, antiferromagnetic spin waves typically involve a slight misalignment of the magnetic moments on the sublattices, giving rise to a small net magnetization that enables long-range dipolar coupling. In this paper, we investigate the role of this dipolar coupling in spin-wave excitations and its influence on the spin-wave dispersion. Our findings show that: (i) when the Néel vector is perpendicular to the film plane or lies within the film plane and parallel to the wave vector, the dispersion branches can be divided into two groups -- those unaffected by the dipolar field and those influenced by it. In these cases, the total magnetic moment remains linearly polarized, but the polarization directions differ between the two types of branches; (ii) when the Néel vector lies in the film plane and is perpendicular to the wave vector, the dipolar interactions affect both types of dispersion branches, leading to their hybridization. This hybridization alters the polarization of the magnetic moment, resulting in elliptical polarization.

Title: Hybridized and Localized 4f Electronic States of Nd-based Intermetallic Compounds in Cubic Symmetry Probed by High-Energy Photoemission

Abstract: We have performed soft and hard X-ray photoemission spectroscopies on NdTi2Al20 and NdBe13 which show antiferromagnetic ordering at low temperatures. The Nd 3d core-level photoemission and Nd 3d-4f valence-band resonant photoemission spectra show finite 4f4 initial-state components in addition to the 4f3 configurations attributed to the c-f hybridization effects in NdTi2Al20, while the 4f3 initial-state components with localized character are dominant in NdBe13. These results imply the emergence of overscreening channel due to the two-channel Kondo effect in NdTi2Al20 through the the strong c-f hybridization effect.

Title: Van der Waals devices for surface-sensitive experiments

Abstract: In-operando characterization of van der Waals (vdW) devices using surface-sensitive methods provides critical insights into phase transitions and correlated electronic states. Yet, integrating vdW materials in functional devices while maintaining pristine surfaces is a key challenge for combined transport and surface-sensitive experiments. Conventional lithographic techniques introduce surface contamination, limiting the applicability of state-of-the-art spectroscopic probes. We present a stencil lithography-based approach for fabricating vdW devices, producing micron-scale electrical contacts, and exfoliation in ultra-high vacuum. The resist-free patterning method utilizes a shadow mask to define electrical contacts and yields thin flakes down to the single-layer regime via gold-assisted exfoliation. As a demonstration, we fabricate devices from 1$T-$TaS$_2$ flakes, achieving reliable contacts for application of electrical pulses and resistance measurements, as well as clean surfaces allowing for angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. The approach provides a platform for studying the electronic properties of vdW systems with surface-sensitive probes in well-defined device geometries.

Title: Electrical, Thermal and Thermoelectric transport in open long-range Kitaev Chain
Authors: Averi Banerjee, Syeda Rafisa Rahaman, Nilanjan Bondyopadhaya
Abstract: We study electrical, thermal and thermoelectric transport in a hybrid device consisting of a long-range Kitaev chain coupled to two metallic leads at two ends. Electrical and thermal currents are calculated in this device under both voltage and thermal bias conditions. We find that the transport characteristics of the long-range Kitaev chain are distinguishably different from its short-range counterpart, which is well known for hosting zero energy Majorana edge modes under some specific range of values of the model parameters. The emergence of massive Dirac fermions, the absence of gap closing at the topological phase transition point and some special features of the energy spectrum which are unique to the long-range Kitaev chain, significantly alter electrical/thermal current vs. voltage/temperature bias characteristics in comparison with that of the short-range Kitaev chain. These novel transport characteristics of the long-range Kitaev model can be helpful in understanding nontrivial topological phases of the long-range Kitaev chain.

Title: Semiregular tessellation of electronic lattices in untwisted bilayer graphene under anisotropic strain gradients
Authors: Zeyu Liu, Xianghua Kong, Zhidan Li, Zewen Wu, Linwei Zhou, Cong Wang, Wei Ji
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) moiré superlattices have emerged as a versatile platform for uncovering exotic quantum phases, many of which arise in bilayer systems exhibiting Archimedean tessellation patterns such as triangular, hexagonal, and kagome lattices. Here, we propose a strategy to engineer semiregular tessellation patterns in untwisted bilayer graphene by applying anisotropic epitaxial tensile strain (AETS) along crystallographic directions. Through force-field and first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that AETS can induce a rich variety of semiregular tessellation geometries, including truncated hextille, prismatic pentagon, and brick-phase arrangements. The characteristic electronic bands (Dirac and flat bands) of the lattice models associated with these semiregular tessellations are observed near the Fermi level, arising from interlayer interactions generated by the redistribution of specific stacking registries (AB, BA, and SP). Furthermore, the electronic kagome, distorted Lieb, brick-like, and one-dimensional stripe lattices captured in real-space confirm the tunable nature of the semiregular tessellation lattices enabled by AETS. Our study identifies AETS as a promising new degree of freedom in moiré engineering, offering a reproducible and scalable platform for exploring exotic electronic lattices in moiré systems.

Title: Theoretical investigation of interface atomic structure of graphene on NiFe alloy substrate
Authors: Naohiro Matsumoto, Ryusuke Endo, Mitsuharu Uemoto, Tomoya Ono
Abstract: Two processes have been proposed to fabricate graphene/NiFe alloy interfaces for tunneling magnetoresistance devices. One is the transfer of graphene and the other is the evaporation of alloys onto graphene. The formation energy of a NiFe alloy substrate and the adsorption energy of graphene on the NiFe alloy substrate are investigated by a density functional theory calculations to reveal the difference in the atomic structure of the interface between the two processes. It is found that Ni-rich surfaces are preferable for the bare substrate, whereas Fe surfaces are stable for the graphene adsorbed on the substrate. This result indicates that the composition ratio of the surface layer depends on the interface fabrication process.

Title: Non-monotonic dependence of $T_c$ on the c axis compression in the HTSC cuprate La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$
Authors: I. A. Makarov (1), S. G. Ovchinnikov (1) ((1) Kirensky Institute of Physics, Federal Research Center KSC SB RAS, Russia, Krasnoyarsk)
Abstract: The effect of the the $c$ axis compression on the electronic structure and superconducting properties of the HTSC cuprate La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ at different doping is investigated. The electronic structure of quasiparticle excitations is obtained within the effective five-band Hubbard model using the equation of motion method for Green's functions builded on the Hubbard operators. The superconducting gap and ${T_c}$ are calculated taking into account the exchange pairing mechanism involving not only the Zhang-Rice singlet but also excited two-hole triplet and singlet states. The energy of the $a_{1g}$ orbitals increases with increasing compression and the $a_{1g}$ quasiparticle bands begin to strongly interact with the $b_{1g}$ bands at the top of the valence band. The reconstruction of the region of states determining the superconducting properties results in the high density of states near the Fermi level. This mechanism leads to an increase in $T_c$ in the underdoped region with increasing compression. The pairing constants renormalizations under compression results in ${T_c}$ decreasing. The competition of these two effects leads to non-monotonic behavior of $T_c$ under the $c$-axis compression near optimal doping.

Title: Carrier Thermalization and Biexciton Formation in a Polar ZnO/Zn$_{\mathbf{0.84}}$Mg$_{\mathbf{0.16}}$O Quantum Well Probed by Ultrafast Broadband Spectroscopy
Authors: Daniel O. Siebadji Tchuimeni, Marc Ziegler, Olivier Crégut, Pierre Gilliot, Christian Morhain, Andrea Balocchi, Mathieu Gallart
Abstract: We investigate the ultrafast dynamics of excitons in a 2.6 nm-thick $\mathrm{ZnO/Zn_{0.84}Mg_{0.16}O}$ quantum well grown on a \textbf{c}-axis sapphire substrate, using non-degenerate time-resolved pump-probe spectroscopy. A pump pulse at 266 nm generates photocarriers within the ZnMgO barriers, and their dynamics is monitored through time-resolved differential reflectance measurements using a supercontinuum probe spanning the 345-400 nm spectral range. Photocarriers generated in the barriers rapidly relax into the quantum well, where they form excitons within sub-picosecond timescales. These excitons quickly thermalize and become localized, likely due to interface disorder or well-width fluctuations, as supported by photoluminescence measurements showing a clear Stokes shift and the absence of free exciton emission. A phonon-assisted absorption process, leading to the effective thermalization of excitons, is observed and analyzed. We identify moreover a negative differential reflectance feature as a photoinduced absorption into a biexciton state, with a binding energy ranging from 18 to 22 meV depending on temperature.

Title: Scalable alloy-based sputtering of high-conductivity PdCoO2 for advanced interconnects
Authors: Takayuki Harada, Zuin Ping Lily Ang, Yuki Sakakibara, Takuro Nagai, Yasushi Masahiro
Abstract: As integrated circuits continue to scale down, the search for new metals is becoming increasingly important due to the rising resistivity of traditional copper-based interconnects. A layered oxide PdCoO2 is one of the candidate materials for interconnects, having bulk ab-plane conductivity exceeding that of elemental Al. Despite its potential, wafer-scale vacuum deposition of PdCoO2, crucial for interconnect applications, has not yet been reported. In this study, we succeeded in the scalable growth of c-axis oriented PdCoO2 thin films via reactive sputtering from Pd-Co alloy targets. Our method paves the way to harness the unique properties of PdCoO2 in semiconductor devices.

Title: Reactive Glass Metal Interaction under Ambient Conditions Enables Surface Modification of Gold Nanoislands

Abstract: Stabilizing gold nanoparticles with tunable surface composition via reactive metal support interactions under ambient conditions remains a significant challenge. We discovered that a reactive glass metal interaction (RGMI) under ambient conditions, driven by the intrinsic catalytic activity of gold nanoislands (GNIs) and the unique properties of sodium aluminophosphosilicate glass, including its chemical composition, molar volume, and high Na ion mobility, enables the formation of robustly anchored GNIs with altered surface compositions. Comprehensive characterization reveals that the adsorption of Na and P at the GNI surfaces induces lattice distortions in the Au(111) planes. Additionally, a smooth GNI glass interface significantly influences the hot carrier dynamics of the GNIs. Altogether, RGMI presents a versatile strategy for engineering stable, multi element nanostructures with potential applications in heterogeneous catalysis, sensing, and optoelectronics.

Title: Atomic Topology and Magnetic Microstructure of Highly Mobile Type I and Supermobile Type II Twin Boundaries in 10M Ni-Mn-Ga Single Crystal
Authors: Ladislav Straka, Marek Vronka, Jan Maňák, Petr Veřtát, Hanuš Seiner, Oleg Heczko
Abstract: The atomic topology and magnetic microstructure of individual, highly mobile Type I and Type II twin boundaries in 10M Ni-Mn-Ga martensite were investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The twin boundaries established in a bulk single crystal showed twinning stresses of ~1 MPa for Type I and ~0.1 MPa for Type II twin boundaries. TEM lamellae with a (010) cross-section, their c-axis (easy-magnetization direction) lying in-plane, were prepared by focused ion-beam milling, each containing a single twin boundary of specific type. High-resolution TEM confirmed an atomically sharp Type I twin boundary oriented along the rational (101) plane. The Type II boundary was also atomically sharp, apart from occasional single-atomic-plane steps. This contrasts with previous suggestions of its diffuse nature. Lorentz TEM showed 180° domain walls within martensite variants. The magnetic induction reorients sharply on both twin boundaries, forming 90°-like magnetic domain walls that follow the c-axis easy-magnetization direction.

Title: Relating thermodynamic quantities of convex-hard-body fluids to the body's shape
Authors: Thomas Franosch, Cristiano De Michele, Rolf Schilling
Abstract: For a fluid of convex hard particles, characterized by a length scale $\sigma_\text{min}$ and an anisotropy parameter $\epsilon$, we develop a formalism allowing one to relate thermodynamic quantities to the body's shape. In a first step its thermodynamics is reduced to that of spherical particles. The latter have a hard core of diameter $\sigma_\text{min }$ and a soft shell with a thickness $\epsilon \sigma_\text{min}/2$. Besides their hard core repulsion at $\sigma_\text{min }$ they interact by effective entropic forces which will be calculated. Based on this mapping, a second step provides a perturbative method for the systematic calculation of thermodynamic quantities with the shape anisotropy $\epsilon$ as smallness parameter. In leading order in $\epsilon $, the equation of state is derived as a functional of the particle's shape. To illustrate these findings, they are applied to a one- and two-dimensional fluid of ellipses and compared with results from different analytical approaches, and our computer simulations. The mapping to spherical particles also implies that any phase transition of spherical particles, e.g., the liquid-hexatic transition, also exists for the nonspherical ones, and shifts linearly with $\epsilon $ for weak shape anisotropy. This is supported by our Monte-Carlo simulation.

Title: Spin-Meissner effect in systems of coupled polariton condensates
Authors: I. Yu. Chestnov, A. Kudlis, A. V. Nalitov, I. A. Shelykh
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the interplay between Zeeman splitting and TE-TM-induced spin-flip tunneling in coupled exciton-polariton condensates systems and its impact on the spin-Meissner effect. We demonstrate that although a single condensate exhibits the effect of full paramagnetic screening via spin-anisotropic interactions, the inter-site spin-flip tunneling can dramatically alter this behavior. The geometry of the system is shown to play a crucial role. In particular, in a dyad, the chemical potential reveals quadratic scaling with the magnetic field. In a triangle, the competition between Zeeman and TE-TM splittings produces a rich phase diagram that features asymmetric polarization states corresponding to both positive and negative magnetic susceptibility. In a square configuration, the symmetry of the network can restore the spin-Meissner effect, so that the condensate emission frequency becomes magnetic field independent in an extended parameter range. These findings not only shed light on the fundamental physics of polariton lattices but also suggest promising avenues for engineering robust spin-controlled photonic devices and polaritonic simulators.

Title: Large, ultra-flat optical traps for uniform quantum gases
Authors: Kai Frye-Arndt, Matthew Glaysher, Marius Glaeser, Matthias Koch, Stefan Seckmeyer, Holger Ahlers, Waldemar Herr, Naceur Gaaloul, Christian Schubert, Ernst Rasel
Abstract: Ultracold atomic gases with uniform density can be created by flat-bottom optical traps. These gases provide an ideal platform to study many-body physics in a system that allows for simple connections with theoretical models and emulation of numerous effects from a wide range of fields of physics. In Earth-bound laboratories the trap sizes, number of species and states, as well as the range of physical effects are largely restricted by the adopted levitation technique. Homogeneous ultracold gases in microgravity simulators and space however offer an interesting perspective which is actively being pursued. To exploit the full potential of any gravity-compensated laboratory the box potentials created need to be as large as possible. By using two orthogonally aligned acousto-optic deflectors, we create large time-averaged optical potentials with trapping volumes a thousandfold larger than conventional setups, described by power-law scalings with exponents of up to $152$. We verify the performance of our setup by simulating the mean-field behaviour of a quantum gas ground state in conjunction with dynamical excitations due to the realistic time-dependent painting potentials. The implementation of this setup may open new directions at the interface with condensed matter, few-body Efimov physics or the exploration of critical, non-equilibrium phenomena.

Title: Poleval: A Python package for HAXPES analysis
Authors: Robin Yoël Engel, Patrick Lömker
Abstract: POLEVAL provides a software toolbox for collaborative, persistent and reproducible analysis of XPS experiments. It allows to treat, analyse and visualise the results of an extended experimental campaign in a single python notebook in a consistent manner. Managing experimental data in adequate objects enables experimentalists to process and analyse measurements in very few lines of code, so as to provide decision aids through online data analysis during e.g. beamtime experiments. The persistent and self-documentary style of the notebook-based analysis allows for easy communication of intermediate results and enables progressive refinements into publishable figures or exporting the results to other programs. The toolbox facilitates various routines for data treatment (normalization, cropping, etc.) and aggregation of spectra into groups to analyse trends. It also enables quantitative analysis with three major functions: First, normalization to the photoionization cross-section and probability of emission into the analyser cone allows for quantitative comparisons between intensities from different core levels. The integrated haxquantpy package allows easy retrieval of literature values for this purpose. Second, an extensive fitting functionality is implemented to treat groups of spectra together, rather than spectrum-by-spectrum. This grouping allows reinforcing the fit algorithm with prior knowledge, such as the equivalence of peak widths or positions between spectra, which enables for more consistent, and importantly, more confident fit results for sets of potentially noisy spectra. Third, a simple formalism to estimate the thickness of adsorbate layers based on the ratio between the substrate's and adsorbate's XPS signal is implemented.

Title: Parallel Exploration of the Optoelectronic Properties of (Sb,Bi)(S,Se)(Br,I) Chalcohalides

Abstract: Chalcohalides are an emerging family of semiconductors with irresistible material properties, shaped by the intricate interplay between their unique structural chemistry and vibrational dynamics. Despite their promise for next-generation solar energy conversion devices, their intrinsic optoelectronic properties remain largely unexplored. Here, we focus on the (Sb,Bi)(S,Se)(Br,I) system, a subset of compounds that share the same quasi-1D crystal structure. Using a two-step physical vapor deposition (PVD) process, we synthesize the eight ternary chalcohalide compounds, demonstrating bandgaps ranging from 1.38 to 2.08 eV with sharp, single-component photoluminescence (PL) peaks. In a parallel exploration of carrier dynamics and intrinsic electron-phonon interactions -- comprehensively studied using power-, temperature-dependent, and time-resolved PL measurements -- we map their direct impact on optoelectronic performance. Supported by first-principles density functional theory (DFT) defect calculations, we establish clear structure-property relations, identifying solid-solutions engineering as an effective means to fine-tune the native phonon structures and further suppress non-radiative recombination. This study provides a blueprint for optimizing chalcohalides as high-efficiency materials across a wide range of optoelectronic applications.

Title: Quantum stochastic resonance in a single-photon emitter
Authors: H. Mannel, J. Zöllner, E. Kleinherbers, M. Zöllner, N. Schwarz, F. Rimek, A. D. Wieck, A. Ludwig, A. Lorke, J. König, M. Geller
Abstract: Stochastic resonance is a phenomenon in which fluctuations enhance an otherwise weak signal. It has been found in many different systems in paleoclimatology, biology, medicine, and physics. The classical stochastic resonance due to thermal noise has recently been experimentally extended to the quantum regime, where the fundamental randomness of individual quantum events provides the noise source. Here, we demonstrate quantum stochastic resonance in the single-electron tunneling dynamics of a periodically driven single-photon emitter, consisting of a self-assembled quantum dot that is tunnel-coupled to an electron reservoir. Such highly-controllable quantum emitters are promising candidates for future applications in quantum information technologies. We monitor the charge dynamics by resonant optical excitation and identify quantum stochastic resonance with the help of full counting statistics of tunneling events in terms of the Fano factor and extend the statistical evaluation to factorial cumulants to gain a deeper understanding of this far-reaching phenomenon.

Title: Topological electron and phonon flat bands in novel kagome superconductor XPd5 (X=Ca, Sr, Ba)
Authors: Jiefeng Ye, Zhigao Huang, Xianxin Wu, Jian-Min Zhang
Abstract: Fermionic and bosonic localized states induced by geometric frustration in the kagome lattice provide a distinctive research platform for investigating emergent exotic quantum phenomena in strongly correlated systems. Here, we report the discovery of coexisting electronic and phononic flat bands induced by geometric frustration in a novel kagome superconductor XPd5 (X=Ca, Sr, Ba). The electronic flat band is located around the Fermi level and possesses a nontrivial topological invariant with Z2=1. Additionaly, we identify multiple van Hove singularities (vHS) arise from the kagome Pd d orbitals with distinct dispersion and sublattice features, including conventional, higher-order vHS and p-type, m-type vHS. Specifically, our investigation of the vibrational modes of the phononic flat band reveals that its formation originates from destructive interference between adjacent kagome lattice sites with antiphase vibrational modes. A spring-mass model of phonons is established to probe the physical mechanism of the phononic flat bands. Furthermore, the calculations of electron-phonon coupling in the XPd5 reveal superconducting ground states with critical temperatures (Tc) of 4.25 K, 2.75 K, and 3.35 K for CaPd5, SrPd5, and BaPd5, respectively. This work provides a promising platform to explore the Fermion-boson many-body interplay and superconducting states, while simultaneously establishing a novel analytical framework to elucidate the origin of phononic flat bands in quantum materials.

Title: A General Algorithm For Determining The Conductivity Zeros In Large Molecular Nanostructures: Applications To Rectangular Graphene Sheets
Authors: Marian Nita, Mugurel Tolea, Catalina Marinescu
Abstract: We propose an algorithm for determining the zeros of the electric conductivity in large molecular nanonstructures such as graphene sheets. To this end, we employ the inverse graph method, whereby non-zeros of the Green's functions are represented graphically by a segment connecting two atomic sites, to visually signal the existence of a conductance zero as a line that is missing. In rectangular graphene structures the topological properties of the inverse graph determine the existence of two types of Green's function zeros that correspond to absolute conductance cancellations with distinct behavior in the presence of external disorder. We discuss these findings and their potential applications in some particular cases.

Abstract: Accounting for nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) can significantly alter material properties at finite temperatures. Atomic modeling using the path-integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) method can fully account for such effects, but requires computationally efficient and accurate models of interatomic interactions. Empirical potentials are fast but may lack sufficient accuracy, whereas quantum-mechanical calculations are highly accurate but computationally expensive. Machine-learned interatomic potentials offer a solution to this challenge, providing near-quantum-mechanical accuracy while maintaining high computational efficiency compared to density functional theory (DFT) calculations. In this context, an interface was developed to integrate moment tensor potentials (MTPs) from the MLIP-2 software package into PIMD calculations using the i-PI software package. This interface was then applied to active learning of potentials and to investigate the influence of NQEs on material properties, namely the temperature dependence of lattice parameters and thermal expansion coefficients, as well as radial distribution functions, for lithium hydride (LiH) and silicon (Si) systems. The results were compared with experimental data, quasi-harmonic approximation calculations, and predictions from the universal machine learning force field MatterSim. These comparisons demonstrated the high accuracy and effectiveness of the MTP-PIMD approach.

Title: In-situ observation of elastic instability of stress-induced B19$^\prime$ martensite in thin NiTi wires
Authors: Petr Sedlák (1), Miroslav Frost (1), Martin Ševčík (1), Lukáš Kadeřávek (2), Hanuš Seiner (1) ((1) Institute of Thermomechanics, Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, (2) FZÚ - Institute of Physics, Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague)
Abstract: A laser-ultrasonic approach was used to measure elastic properties of a superelastic nickel-titanium wire with the aim to evaluate their evolution with stress and temperature in stress-induced martensite. It was observed that this evolution can be well described by a single smooth surface in the stress-temperature space, with the values of Young's modulus ranging from 30 to 50 GPa. The evolution of the modulus was then monitored in-situ with further heating under fixed strain, that is, during the shape setting. The results revealed that the martensite phase experienced further softening during this process, reaching Young's modulus of nearly 10 GPa at high temperatures and high stresses. In addition, the measurement enabled a direct detection of the initiation and termination temperatures of the shape setting from the elasticity data, which was used to show that it occurs in the same temperature interval for tension-induced and torsion-induced martensite.

Title: Insight into the Correlation of Shape and Magnetism of Hematite Nanospindles
Authors: Juri Kopp, Gerald Richwien, Markus Heidelmann, Soma Salamon, Benoît Rhein, Annette M. Schmidt, Joachim Landers
Abstract: It is established that the Morin transition, a spin reorientation in hematite, is shifted to lower temperatures with decreasing nanoparticle volume. However, our findings indicate an opposite effect in a series of hematite nanospindles: The particles, synthesized by hydrothermal decomposition of iron(III) chloride solution, with aspect ratios $p$ between $1.0$ and $5.2$ (long axis ca. $70$--$290$ nm) display decreasing Morin transition temperatures $T_{\text{Morin}}$ upon increasing $p$, despite the volume increase. Their inner morphology, determined via (HR)STEM and XRD, shows that they are formed by the epitactical fusion of primary particles, perfectly aligned in terms of crystallographic orientation. Combining magnetometry and Mössbauer spectroscopy, we uncover the correlation between particle shape, magnetic properties, and in particular the Morin transition: While more spherical particles undergo said transition at about $200$ K, $T_{\text{Morin}}$ decreases upon higher nanospindle elongation, while also being broadened and showing a wider thermal hysteresis. Our measurements reveal complete suppression of the Morin transition beyond a critical threshold $p \gtrapprox 1.5$, indicating stabilization of the weak ferromagnetic (WFM) state with net particle magnetic moment within the hematite basal plane, despite such behavior being unexpected based on shape anisotropy considerations. For the correlated, magnetic field-dependent spin-flop transition, a comparable trend in particle aspect ratio is detected. We have demonstrated the presence of intermediate spin alignment states that deviate both from the low-temperature antiferromagnetic (AFM) and high-temperature WFM spin structure for slightly elongated particles, likely being connected to the suppression of the Morin transition observed for $p \gtrapprox 1.5$.

Title: Charge and magnetic orders in a two-band model with long-range interactions for infinite-layer nickelates NdNiO$_2$
Authors: Tharathep Plienbumrung, Jean-Baptiste Morée, Andrzej M. Oleś, Maria Daghofer
Abstract: We present an effective two-band model for infinite-layer nickelates NdNiO$_2$ that consisting of a $d$ band centered at Ni site and an interstitial $s$-like band centered at Nd site. To the large extent of the wave functions, we find intersite Coulomb interactions to be substantial. We then use the variational cluster approach together with mean-field theory to investigate magnetic and charge ordering. While tendencies towards charge modulation are found, they are weak and might be due to finite-size effects. Magnetic order is determined mostly by the filling of the $d$ band and hardly affected by including longer-ranged interactions. For a $d$-band density consistent with density-functional theory, magnetic ordering vanishes once quantum fluctuations are included to a sufficient spatial extent. Apart from self-doping, $d$ and $s$ bands remain largely uncoupled despite the presence of inter-orbital Coulomb interaction and (small) inter-orbital hopping.

Title: Infrared markers of topological phase transitions in quantum spin Hall insulators
Authors: Paolo Fachin, Francesco Macheda, Paolo Barone, Francesco Mauri
Abstract: Using first principles techniques, we show that infrared optical response can be used to discriminate between the topological and the trivial phases of two-dimensional quantum spin Hall insulators (QSHI). We showcase germanene and jacutingaite, of recent experimental realization, as prototypical systems where the infrared spectrum is discontinuous across the transition, due to sudden and large discretized jumps of the value of Born effective charges (up to 2). For these materials, the topological transition can be induced via the application of an external electrostatic potential in the field-effect setup. Our results are rationalized in the framework of a low-energy Kane-Mele model and are robust with respect to dynamical effects which come into play when the energy gap of the material is of the same order of the infrared active phonon frequency. In the small gap QSHI germanene, due to dynamical effects, the in-plane phonon resonance in the optical conductivity shows a Fano profile with remarkable differences in the intensity and the shape between the two phases. Instead, the large gap QSHI jacutingaite presents several IR-active phonon modes whose spectral intensities drastically change between the two phases.

Title: Localization versus hybridization of $f$ states in actinide and lanthanide dioxides probed in core-level photoemission spectra
Authors: Sergei M. Butorin
Abstract: The degrees of the localization and hybridization of the valence $f$ states/covalency of the chemical bonding in actinide and lanthanide dioxides were investigated using the atomic, crystal-field multiplet and Anderson impurity model (AIM) approaches to calculate actinide $5d$ and lanthanide $3d$ x-ray photoemission spectra (XPS). The actinide $5d$ XPS can be largely described within atomic, crystal-field multiplet theory due to an extended multiplet structure as a result of the strong interaction of $5f$ electrons with a $5d$ core hole. The multiplet structure was found to be quite sensitive to the oxidation state of actinides. In turn, the lanthanide $3d$ XPS description requires the AIM-type of calculations due to significant $4f-$O $2p$ hybridization effects. As a result derived from the analysis of the XPS spectra, an increase in the $f$-shell occupancy in the ground state due to the $f-$O $2p$ hybridization and covalency of the chemical bonding appears to be higher in lanthanide dioxides as compared to actinide dioxides.

Title: Spin relaxation in a single-electron bilayer graphene quantum dot
Authors: Lin Wang, Guido Burkard
Abstract: We study the spin relaxation in a single-electron bilayer graphene quantum dot due to the spin-orbit coupling. The spin relaxation is assisted by the emission of acoustic phonons via the bond-length change and deformation potential mechanisms and $1/f$ charge noise. In the perpendicular magnetic-field dependence of the spin relaxation rate $T_1^{-1}$, we predict a monotonic increase of $T_1^{-1}$ at higher fields where the electron-phonon coupling via the deformation potential plays a dominant role in spin relaxation. We show a less pronounced dip in $T_1^{-1}$ at lower magnetic fields due to the competition between the electron-phonon coupling due to bond-length change and $1/f$ charge noise. Finally, detailed comparisons of the magnetic-field dependence of the spin relaxation with the existing experiments by Banszerus et al. [Nat. Commun. 13, 3637 (2022)] and Gächter et al. [PRX Quantum 3, 020343 (2022)] are reported.

Title: Water-rich amorphous state from drying mixed-metal sulfate solutions
Authors: Christiaan T. van Campenhout, Romane Le Dizès Castell, Tess Heeremans, Sander Woutersen, Daniel Bonn, Noushine Shahidzadeh
Abstract: Amorphous and glassy materials are important for many advanced applications, from flexible solar cells to drug delivery systems. To this end, new glasses are in high demand, but precise chemical design of amorphous materials remains challenging. By studying the crystallization of mixed salt solutions, we have discovered an entirely new type of amorphous material: water-rich amorphous mixed sulfates. Specifically, we show that drying of sulfate salt mixtures of both mono- and higher valency cations almost exclusively yields a glassy or amorphous state, where the stability of the amorphous state depends on the cations present and ranges from seconds to months. Furthermore, we show that the glassy state is viscoelastic, behaves like a soft solid (G' 10^5 - 10^6 Pa), retains a large amount of water (30 to 40 weight percent), and is X-ray amorphous. Additionally, confocal Raman microspectroscopy reveals disordered sulfate orientations and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy highlights increased hydrogen bonding during drying, which together with strong cation hydration is hypothesized to prevent crystallization. These results provide insights for the production of a new class of amorphous materials, and help to elucidate the mystery of the high abundance of such amorphous salts found on Mars.

Title: Freezing line of polydisperse hard spheres via direct-coexistence simulations
Authors: Antoine Castagnède, Laura Filion, Frank Smallenburg
Abstract: In experimental systems, colloidal particles are virtually always at least somewhat polydisperse, which can have profound effects on their ability to crystallize. Unfortunately, accurately predicting the effects of polydispersity on phase behavior using computer simulations remains a challenging task. As a result, our understanding of the equilibrium phase behavior of even the simplest colloidal model system, hard spheres, remains limited. Here, we present a new approach to map out the freezing line of polydisperse systems that draws on direct-coexistence simulations in the semi-grand canonical ensemble. We use this new method to map out the conditions where a hard-sphere fluid with a Gaussian size distribution becomes metastable with respect to partial crystallization into a face-centered-cubic crystal. Consistent with past predictions, we find that as the polydispersity of the fluid increases, the coexisting crystal becomes increasingly size-selective, exhibiting a lower polydispersity and larger mean particle size than the fluid phase. Interestingly, for sufficiently high polydispersity, this leads to a crystal phase with a lower number density than that of the coexisting fluid. Finally, we exploit our direct-coexistence simulations to examine the characteristics of the fluid-crystal interface, including the surface stress and interfacial absorption.

Title: phaser: An all-in-one package for (multislice) electron ptychography
Authors: Colin Gilgenbach, James M. LeBeau
Abstract: Electron ptychography is a groundbreaking technique for the advanced characterization of materials. Successful ptychography relies on robust implementations of reconstruction algorithms with process raw data into phase images. Current software has enabled deep sub-angstrom multislice electron ptychographic reconstructions, but reconstructions remain challenging and computationally expensive. In addition, current software generally lacks the modularity to act as a platform for the development and testing of new solver components and algorithms. For instance, algorithms based on gradient descent and autodifferentiation promise faster reconstructions with higher quality, but it is difficult to implement these algorithms in existing software. Here, we present \texttt{phaser}, an open source Python package which provides a unified interface to both conventional and gradient descent based ptychographic algorithms. Reconstructions are specified in a declarative format, and can be run from a command line, Jupyter notebook, or web interface. Multiple computational backends are supported to provide maximum flexibility. With the JAX computational backend, a 6x improvement in iteration speed is achieved over a state-of-the-art package, \texttt{fold\_slice}. Additionally, \texttt{phaser}'s gradient descent solver achieves improved reconstruction quality.

Title: Role of Friction on the Formation of Confined Granular Structures
Authors: Vinícius Pereira da S. Oliveira, Danilo S. Borges, Erick M. Franklin, Jorge Peixinho
Abstract: Metastable systems of fluidized grains can auto-defluidize after some time, the settling particles forming either a glass- or crystal-like structure. We carried out experiments using different polymer spheres, of known friction and roughness, fluidized in water. We show that the level of velocity fluctuations is higher for the high friction material. A diagram was obtained for the settled particles when the coefficient of friction is of the order of 0.1, and their structure is characterized through an analysis of the nearest neighbors' angles. For the lower friction values, we find that the number of defects is smaller, the contact chains being longer and aligned. Our results bring new insights for understanding the formation of glass- and crystal-like structures based on the material surface properties.

Title: Reference lattice, sound, stiffness, and magnetic transitions of Ising monolayers
Authors: John M. Davis, Amador Garcia-Fuente, Jaime Ferrer, Salvador Barraza-Lopez
Abstract: A reference lattice, away from which elastic distortions induced by the spin texturing of 2D magnets take hold, is motivated from a picture of pairwise Biot-Savart interactions among identical solenoids that either elongate or compress a (``zero-current'') spring lattice. Applied to a paradigmatic CrSiTe$_3$ monolayer (ML), the reference is given by the average between the atomic positions of FM and Néel AFM lattices; such an atomic disposition permits understanding structural distortions and elastic energies due to magnetism readily. Furthermore, the anisotropic speed of sound in the magnetic ground state explains an observed anisotropy of vibrational frequencies on similar magnets. Elastic stiffness constants are reported, too. Magnetic energies in four Ising structural configurations were calculated, and the strain needed for those 2D magnets to undergo an AFM to FM quantum phase transition was determined as well.

Title: Thermal conductivity of boron arsenide above 2100 watts per meter per Kelvin at room temperature
Authors: Ange Benise Niyikiza, Zeyu Xiang, Fanghao Zhang, Fengjiao Pan, Chunhua Li, David Broido, Ying Peng, Bolin Liao, Zhifeng Ren
Abstract: Boron arsenide (BAs) single crystals had been previously reported to have thermal conductivity of 1500 W/mK at room temperature. Now we achieved thermal conductivity above 2100 W/mK at room temperature in BAs crystals due to much lower concentration of impurities Si, C, and O grown from purified arsenic. We also observed a T-1.8 dependence of the thermal conductivity, suggesting a more significant contribution from four-phonon scatterings than suggested by previous theory. We found that our experimental result can be fit with a modified theoretical calculation by tuning down the three-phonon scattering for phonons in the 4-8 THz range, although current phonon transport theory cannot provide a physical explanation. Such an advance will not only attract more effort on growing BAs single crystals and studying their practical applications but also stimulate theoretical work to predict more materials with possibly even higher thermal conductivities.

Title: Influence of microscopic parameters on phase behavior of a cell model with Curie-Weiss interaction
Authors: O.A. Dobush, M.P. Kozlovskii, I.V. Pylyuk, Yu.O. Plevachuk
Abstract: We have investigated the effect of changing two microscopic parameters in a cell model with Curie-Weiss-type interaction on its phase behavior, namely the cell volume and ratio between repulsion and attraction intensities. The results are based on an exact solution previously derived for this model in the grand canonical ensemble. At sufficiently low temperatures, the cell model exhibits multiple first-order phase transitions. Varying the cell volume and the repulsion-to-attraction ratio, we represent a quantitative comparison of the chemical potential and pressure isotherms, as well as the pressure-temperature and temperature-density phase diagrams. The analysis of provided data shows that altering microscopic parameters does not lead to qualitative changes in the overall phase behavior of the cell model.

Title: Spin Pumping into two-dimensional systems
Authors: Yuya Ominato, Masaki Yama, Ai Yamakage, Mamoru Matsuo, Takeo Kato
Abstract: In this review, we present recent theoretical developments on spin transport phenomena probed by ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) modulation in two-dimensional systems coupled to magnetic materials. We first address FMR linewidth enhancements induced by spin pumping at interfaces, emphasizing their potential as sensitive probes of superconducting pairing symmetries in two-dimensional superconductors. We then examine FMR modulation due to spin pumping into two-dimensional electron gases formed in semiconductor heterostructures, where the interplay of Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit interactions enables gate-controlled spin transport and persistent spin textures. Finally, we investigate spin pumping in monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides, where spin-valley coupling and Berry curvature effects lead to valley-selective spin excitations and a spin-current Hall effect. These developments demonstrate that the spin pumping technique provides a versatile tool for probing spin transport and spin-dependent phenomena in low-dimensional systems, offering a basis for future spintronics applications.

Title: Acidity-Mediated Metal Oxide Heterointerfaces: Roles of Substrates and Surface Modification
Authors: Gyu Rac Lee, Thomas Defferriere, Jinwook Kim, Han Gil Seo, Yeon Sik Jung, Harry L. Tuller
Abstract: Although strong modulation of interfacial electron concentrations by the relative acidity of surface additives has been suggested, direct observation of corresponding changes in surface conductivity, crucial for understanding the role of local space charge, has been lacking. Here, we introduce a model platform comprising well-aligned mixed ionic-electronic conducting $\mathrm{Pr}_{0.2}\mathrm{Ce}_{0.8}\mathrm{O}_{2-\delta}$ nanowire arrays ($\mathrm{PCO}_{\mathrm{NA}}$) to show that acidity-modulated heterointerfaces predict electron depletion or accumulation, resulting in tunable electrical properties. We confirm three orders of magnitude increased $\mathrm{PCO}_{\mathrm{NA}}$ conductivity with basic $\mathrm{Li}_{2}\mathrm{O}$ infiltration. Moreover, the relative acidity of the insulating substrate supporting the $\mathrm{PCO}_{\mathrm{NA}}$ strongly influences its electronic properties as well. This strategy is further validated in purely ionic-conducting nanostructured ceria as well as $\mathrm{PCO}_{\mathrm{NA}}$. We suggest that observed conductivity changes stem not only from acidity-mediated space charge potentials at heterointerfaces but also from grain boundaries, chemically-modulated by cation in-diffusion. These findings have broad implications for how substrate and surface treatment choices can alter the conductive properties of nanostructured functional oxides.

Title: Influence of active breathing on rheology and jamming of amorphous solids: insights from microscopic and mesoscale analysis
Authors: Sayantan Ghosh, Magali Le Goff, Pinaki Chaudhuri, Kirsten Martens
Abstract: We study the flow behavior and unjamming transition in dense assemblies of actively deforming particles that periodically change size, a process that we refer to as breathing. Using extensive molecular dynamics simulations and a complementary mesoscale elasto-plastic model, we explore how this internal activity influences plasticity and rheology. At low amplitudes of breathing, the system remains jammed and displays localized, reversible rearrangements. As the amplitude of the breathing increases beyond a critical threshold, the system undergoes an activity-induced fluidization marked by a surge in plastic events and a drop in yield stress. The flow curve analysis reveals a transition from yield-stress behavior to Newtonian flow at high activity. The mesoscale model captures these trends and provides insight into the role of stress redistribution due to local active deformations. Our findings highlight the potential of internal active driving to tune the mechanical state of amorphous materials without external forcing.

Title: Pressure Waves During Granular Flows in Varying Gravity Environments
Authors: Abigail Tadlock, Lori McCabe, Kerstin Nordstrom
Abstract: We present results of LAMMPS Molecular Dynamics simulations of 2D gravity-driven flows of 30,000 soft uniform spheres through a vertical silo. We vary the gravitational field (g), elastic modulus of the particles (E), and silo outlet diameter (D). We present results on upwards pressure waves observed in the system. We compare our results with previous work on granular acoustics. Despite the typical particle speed being substantially less than the measured wave speed, we posit these are nonlinear shock waves, as observed in other systems near jamming. We demonstrate that the wave speeds in all systems appear to follow a power law that is distinct from linear wave expectations.

Title: Electrical manipulation of magnetic domain structure in van der Waals ferromagnetic Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ using ferroelectric PMN-PT single crystal
Authors: Riku Iimori, Yuta Kodani, Shaojie Hu, Takashi Kimura
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnets have emerged as promising materials for spintronic applications due to their unique magnetic properties and tunability. Controlling ferromagnetism via external stimuli is critical for both fundamental research and device integration. In particular, modulation of magnetic anisotropy and exchange interactions through strain offers a viable pathway for functional control. Owing to their weak interlayer coupling, vdW ferromagnets exhibit pronounced sensitivity to strain, enabling effective tuning of their magnetic states. In this study, we investigate electric-field-induced magnetoelectric coupling in the above-room-temperature vdW ferromagnet Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ integrated on a ferroelectric PMN-PT substrate. We demonstrate that application of an electric field leads to a substantial reduction in coercive force along with dynamic reconfiguration of the magnetic domain structure. These effects are attributed to electric-field-induced modulation of the vdW interlayer gap and enhancement of the DzyaloshinskiiMoriya interaction. Our findings reveal a strong interplay between electric fields and magnetism in vdW systems, offering a viable route toward the development of low-power, multifunctional magnetic devices. This work establishes a foundation for the electric-field control of magnetic properties in vdW ferromagnets and highlights their potential in next-generation spintronic technologies.

Title: Dynamic correlations of frustrated quantum spins from high-temperature expansion
Authors: Ruben Burkard, Benedikt Schneider, Björn Sbierski
Abstract: For quantum spin systems in equilibrium, the dynamic structure factor (DSF) is among the most feature-packed experimental observables. However, from a theory perspective it is often hard to simulate in an unbiased and accurate way, especially for frustrated and high-dimensional models at intermediate temperature. We address this challenge by introducing a dynamic extension of the high-temperature expansion as an efficient numerical approach to the DSF for arbitrary lattices. We focus on the nearest-neighbor Heisenberg model and spin-lengths S=1/2 and 1. We present a user-friendly numerical implementation and provide comprehensive benchmarks on spin chains. As applications we treat a variety of frustrated two- and three dimensional antiferromagnets. In particular we shed new light on the anomalous intermediate temperature regime of the S=1/2 triangular lattice model and reproduce the DSF measured recently for a S=1 pyrochlore material.

Title: Interplay between altermagnetic order and crystal symmetry probed using magnetotransport in epitaxial altermagnet MnTe
Authors: Himanshu Bangar, Polychronis Tsipas, Prasanna Rout, Lalit Pandey, Alexei Kalaboukhov, Akylas Lintzeris, Athanasios Dimoulas, Saroj P. Dash
Abstract: Altermagnets are a new class of magnetic materials characterized by fully compensated spins arranged in alternating local structures, allowing for spin-split bands similar to those found in ferromagnets without net magnetism. Recently, MnTe has emerged as a prototypical altermagnetic material exhibiting spin-polarized electronic bands and anomalous transport phenomena. Although recent work has explored the magnetic and structural properties of MnTe, detailed experimental investigations into the relationship between altermagnetic order and crystal symmetry are lacking. Here, we report the relationship between altermagnetic order and crystal symmetry by investigating magnetotransport properties of MnTe epitaxial altermagnetic thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. We observe a spontaneous anomalous Hall effect and show the control of Hall response with the altermagnetic order using the magnetic field and the crystallographic angle dependence. Detailed measurements establish that both the longitudinal and transverse electronic responses depend on the relative orientation of the applied current and Néel vector as well as on the crystal orientation and altermagnetic order. These results provide new insights into the interplay between crystal symmetry and altermagnetism for future device applications.

Title: Superconducting properties of thin film $\mathrm{Nb_{1-x}Ti_xN}$ studied via the NMR of implanted $^8$Li

Abstract: We report measurements of the normal-state and superconducting properties of thin-film $\mathrm{Nb_{1-x}Ti_xN}$ using $^{8}$Li $\beta$-detected nuclear magnetic resonance ($\beta$-NMR). In these experiments, radioactive $^{8}$Li$^{+}$ probes were implanted $\sim21$ nm below the surface of a $\mathrm{Nb_{1-x}Ti_xN}$(91 nm) film in $\mathrm{Nb_{0.75}Ti_{0.25}N}$(91 nm)/AlN(4 nm)/Nb and its NMR response recorded (via $^{8}$Li's $\beta$-emissions) between 4.6 K and 270 K in a 4.1 T field applied normal to its surface. Resonance measurements reveal wide, symmetric lineshapes at all temperatures, with significant additional broadening below the film's superconducting transition temperature $T_\mathrm{c}(0 \; \mathrm{T}) = 15.4 \pm 0.7$ K due to vortex lattice formation. Fits to a broadening model find a magnetic penetration depth $\lambda(0 \; \mathrm{K})= 180.57 \pm 0.30$ nm and upper critical field $B_\mathrm{c2}(0 \; \mathrm{K})= 18 \pm 4$ T, consistent with literature estimates. Spin-lattice relaxation (SLR) measurements find a Korringa response at low temperatures, with dynamic (i.e., thermally activated) contributions dominating above $\sim100$ K. Below $T_\mathrm{c}$, we observe a small Hebel-Slichter coherence peak characterized by a superconducting energy gap $\Delta(0 \; \mathrm{K}) = 2.60 \pm 0.12$ meV and modest Dynes-like broadening. Our measurements suggest a gap ratio $2\Delta(0 \; \mathrm{K})/k_\mathrm{B}T_\mathrm{c}(0 \; \mathrm{T}) = 3.92 \pm 0.25$, consistent with strong-coupling behavior. Sources for the dynamic high-$T$ relaxation are suggested.

Title: Impact of Surfactant and Flow Rate on the Electrical Properties of Activated Carbon Black Suspensions
Authors: KangJin Lee, Jesse S. Wainright, Christopher L. Wirth
Abstract: Carbon black slurries are a key component in redox flow batteries as the large surface area provided by the particles allows an increase in the battery capacity without facing limitations posed by many solid-state batteries such as safety hazard or cost. However, these conductive slurries often have complex mechanical and electrical responses because of the heterogeneous nature of the suspensions. Utilization of these slurries in a redox flow battery requires understanding of how additives impact the material responses and associated battery performance. This work focuses on the electrochemical performance of the slurry at flow rate conditions matching those of battery operation. In addition, the impact of a nonionic surfactant (Triton X-100) on the conductivity and capacitance of the slurry was measured. Experimental results show that the full capacitive contribution of the carbon black particles can only be measured at low flow rates and low scan rates, while the conductive contribution can be measured at all scan rates in flowing conditions. Upon the addition of surfactants, there is a gradual decrease in the electrochemical performance with increasing surfactant concentration until the surface of the carbon black particle is saturated. Once saturated, the conductive carbon particles no longer contribute to the electronic conductivity of the slurry. Results presented herein on the electrochemical response of the slurry to the addition of surfactant are in stark contrast to the mechanical response. While previous work has shown a smaller change in the response, followed by a step-change at a critical surfactant concentration, electrochemical data shows a gradual transition. Comparison of these behaviors suggests a difference in the mechanisms for how mechanical networks form in comparison to charge transfer networks for this particular slurry chemistry.

Title: Engineering the Kondo impurity problem with alkaline-earth atom arrays
Authors: Adriano Amaricci, Andrea Richaud, Massimo Capone, Nelson Darkwah Oppong, Francesco Scazza
Abstract: We propose quantum simulation experiments of the Kondo impurity problem using cold alkaline-earth(-like) atoms (AEAs) in a combination of optical lattice and optical tweezer potentials. Within an ab initio model for atomic interactions in the optical potentials, we analyze hallmark signatures of the Kondo effect in a variety of observables accessible in cold-atom quantum simulators. We identify additional terms not part of the textbook Kondo problem, mostly ignored in previous works and giving rise to a direct competition between spin and charge correlations--strongly suppressing Kondo physics. Crucially, we show that the Kondo effect can be restored by locally adjusting the chemical potential on the impurity site. We identify realistic parameter regimes and preparation protocols suited to current experiments with AEA arrays. Our work paves the way for novel quantum simulations of the Kondo problem and offers new insights into Kondo physics in unconventional regimes.

Title: Magnetised Bounds for Conformal Field Theories
Authors: Christopher P. Herzog, William H. Pannell, Biswajit Sahoo, Andreas Stergiou
Abstract: Aspects of parity-preserving, three-dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs) with a global $U(1)$ symmetry in the presence of a background magnetic field are investigated. A local effective action is constructed to four-derivative order, based on an assumption that the magnetic field drives the theory into a gapped phase. This action is evaluated in a variety of backgrounds, and is used to obtain one- and two-point functions of the conserved current and stress-energy tensor. Dispersive arguments are developed and shown to impose powerful constraints on the Wilson coefficients of the effective action, leading to universal predictions for the CFT response at large magnetic field and the scaling dimensions of background monopole operators. These general results are further examined through explicit calculations in the free complex scalar, free Dirac fermion, and a holographic Einstein-Hilbert-Maxwell model.

Title: Real-time dynamics with bead-Fourier path integrals I: Bead-Fourier CMD
Authors: Nathan London, Mohammad R. Momeni
Abstract: Developing new methods for the accurate and efficient calculations of real-time quantum correlation functions is deemed one of the most challenging problems of modern condensed matter theory. Many popular methods, such as centroid molecular dynamics (CMD), make use of Feynman path integrals (PIs) to efficiently introduce nuclear quantum effects into classical dynamical simulations. Conventional CMD methods use the discretized form of the PI formalism to represent a quantum particle using a series of replicas, or "beads", connected with harmonic springs to create an imaginary time ring polymer. The alternative Fourier PI methodology, instead, represents the imaginary time path using a Fourier sine series. Presented as an intermediary between the two formalisms, bead-Fourier PIs (BF-PIs) have been shown to reduce the number of beads needed to converge equilibrium properties by including a few terms of the Fourier series. Here, a new CMD method is presented where the effective potential is calculated using BF-PIs as opposed to the typical discretized PIs. We demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of this new BF-CMD method for a series of 1D model systems and show that at low temperatures, one can achieve a 4-fold reduction in the number of beads with the addition of a single Fourier component. The developed methodology is general and can be extended to other closely related methods, such as ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD), as well as non-adiabatic PI methods.

Title: A new scale anomaly in Dirac matter
Authors: Matteo Baggioli, Maxim N. Chernodub, Karl Landsteiner, Alessandro Principi, María A. H. Vozmediano
Abstract: The dynamics of Dirac semimetals is modeled at low energies by the massless Dirac Hamiltonian with the Fermi velocity replacing the velocity of light. The classical action is scale invariant. In 3D materials, Coulomb interactions induce a conformal anomaly associated to the charge renormalization already known in quantum field theory. In this work, we describe a new conformal anomaly induced by the running of the Fermi velocity that applies to Dirac semimetals in two and three dimensions. The case of graphene is particularly interesting. We analyze the anomaly and explore its thermodynamic and hydrodynamic consequences. The anomaly modifies the propagation speed of hydrodynamic sound waves, alters the thermodynamic equation of state, and induces a non-vanishing bulk viscosity proportional to the beta function of the Fermi velocity.

Title: A novel variant of rhombic Penrose tiling
Authors: Nobuhisa Fujita, Komajiro Niizeki
Abstract: We present a novel variant of a planar quasiperiodic tiling with tenfold symmetry, employing the same thick and thin rhombuses as the celebrated rhombic Penrose tiling. Despite its distinct visual appearance, this new tiling shares several key features with its predecessor, including similar vertex environments, polygonal acceptance domains based on regular pentagons, and an inflation/deflation symmetry associated with the golden mean as its fundamental scaling ratio. Additional complexities arise from an increased number of prototiles and a dual grid pattern that incorporates folded lines alongside ordinary straight lines. This tiling exhibits a high density of a compact decagonal motif forming a two-tiered, five-petaled flower pattern, which spans a substantial portion of the tiling. We identify a slightly enhanced degree of hyperuniform order compared to the standard rhombic Penrose tiling.

Title: Revealing Information from Weak Signal in Electron Energy-Loss Spectroscopy with a Deep Denoiser
Authors: Yifan Wang, Mai Tan, Carlos Fernandez-Granda, Peter A. Crozier
Abstract: Electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) coupled with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) is a powerful technique to determine materials composition and bonding with high spatial resolution. Noise is often a limitation especially with the increasing sophistication of EELS experiments. The signal characteristics from direct electron detectors provide a new opportunity to design superior denoisers. We have developed a CNN based denoiser, the unsupervised deep video denoiser (UDVD), which can be applied to EELS datasets acquired with direct electron detectors. We described UDVD and explained how to adapt the denoiser to energy-loss spectral series. To benchmark the performance of the denoiser on EELS datasets, we generated and denoised a set of simulated spectra. We demonstrate the charge spreading effect associated with pixel interfaces on direct electron detectors, which leads to artifacts after denoising. To suppress such artifacts, we propose some adjustments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the denoiser using two challenging real data examples: mapping Gd dopants in $CeO_2$ nanoparticles and characterizing vibrational modes in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) with atomic resolution.

Title: Quantum and Critical Casimir Effects: Bridging Fluctuation Physics and Nanotechnology
Authors: Roberto Passante, Lucia Rizzuto, Peter Schall, Emanuele Marino
Abstract: Fluctuation-induced forces, primarily represented by quantum and critical Casimir effects, play a pivotal role at the nanoscale. This review explores the theoretical and experimental landscapes of these forces, offering a comprehensive analysis of their similarities and distinctions. We emphasize the effects of material properties, geometry, and temperature in shaping these forces and their roles in various nanoscale systems, both colloidal and solid-state. We devote special attention to the Casimir torque, the influence of magnetism on the Casimir force, and the use of Casimir effects for the generation of optical resonators. Through this comparative study, we elucidate the underlying physics of these phenomena, fostering insights that advance applications in nanomechanics, optomechanics, and quantum technologies.

Title: Functional bottlenecks can emerge from non-epistatic underlying traits
Authors: Anna Ottavia Schulte, Samar Alqatari, Saverio Rossi, Francesco Zamponi
Abstract: Protein fitness landscapes frequently exhibit epistasis, where the effect of a mutation depends on the genetic context in which it occurs, \textit{i.e.}, the rest of the protein sequence. Epistasis increases landscape complexity, often resulting in multiple fitness peaks. In its simplest form, known as global epistasis, fitness is modeled as a non-linear function of an underlying additive trait. In contrast, more complex epistasis arises from a network of (pairwise or many-body) interactions between residues, which cannot be removed by a single non-linear transformation. Recent studies have explored how global and network epistasis contribute to the emergence of functional bottlenecks - fitness landscape topologies where two broad high-fitness basins, representing distinct phenotypes, are separated by a bottleneck that can only be crossed via one or a few mutational paths. Here, we introduce and analyze a simple model of global epistasis with an additive underlying trait. We demonstrate that functional bottlenecks arise with high probability if the model is properly calibrated. Our results underscore the necessity of sufficient heterogeneity in the mutational effects selected by evolution for the emergence of functional bottlenecks. Moreover, we show that the model agrees with experimental findings, at least in small enough combinatorial mutational spaces.

Title: Nanoconfined superionic water is a molecular superionic
Authors: Samuel W. Coles, Amir Hajibabaei, Venkat Kapil, Xavier R. Advincula, Christoph Schran, Stephen J. Cox, Angelos Michaelides
Abstract: Superionic ice, where water molecules dissociate into a lattice of oxygen ions and a rapidly diffusing 'gas' of protons, represents an exotic state of matter with broad implications for planetary interiors and energy applications. Recently, a nanoconfined superionic state of water has been predicted which, in sharp contrast to bulk ice, is comprised of intact water molecules. Here, we apply machine learning and electronic structure simulations to establish how nanoconfined water can be both molecular and superionic. We also explore what insights this material offers for superionic materials and behavior more generally. Similar to bulk ice and other superionic materials, nanoconfined water conducts via concerted chain-like proton migrations which cause the rapid propagation of defects. However, unlike other molecular phases of water, its exceptional conductivity arises from the activation of the Grotthuss mechanism by (i) low barriers to proton transfer and (ii) a flexible hydrogen-bonded network. We propose that these are two key characteristics of fast ionic conduction in molecular superionics. The insights obtained here establish design principles for the discovery of other molecular superionic materials, with potential applications in energy storage and beyond.

Title: From the perceptron to the cerebellum
Authors: Nicolas Brunel, Vincent Hakim, Jean-Pierre Nadal
Abstract: The perceptron has served as a prototypical neuronal learning machine in the physics community interested in neural networks and artificial intelligence, which included Gérard Toulouse as one of its prominent figures. It has also been used as a model of Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, a brain structure involved in motor learning, in the early influential theories of David Marr and James Albus. We review these theories, more recent developments in the field, and highlight questions of current interest.

Title: On entanglement c-functions in confining gauge field theories
Authors: Niko Jokela, Jani Kastikainen, Carlos Nunez, José Manuel Penín, Helime Ruotsalainen, Javier G. Subils
Abstract: Entanglement entropy has proven to be a powerful tool for probing renormalization group (RG) flows in quantum field theories, with c-functions derived from it serving as candidate measures of the effective number of degrees of freedom. While the monotonicity of such c-functions is well established in many settings, notable exceptions occur in theories with a mass scale. In this work, we investigate entanglement c-functions in the context of holographic RG flows, with a particular focus on flows across dimensions induced by circle compactifications. We argue that in spacetime dimensions $d \geq 4$, standard constructions of c-functions, which rely on higher derivatives of the entanglement entropy of either a ball or a cylinder, generically lead to non-monotonic behavior. Working with known dual geometries, we argue that the non-monotonicity stems not from any pathology or curvature singularity, but from a transition in the holographic Ryu--Takayanagi surface. In compactifications from four to three dimensions, we propose a modified construction that restores monotonicity in the infrared, although a fully monotonic ultraviolet extension remains elusive. Furthermore, motivated by entanglement entropy inequalities, we conjecture a bound on the cylinder entanglement c-function, which holds in all our examples.

Title: Phonon Mean Free Path Spectroscopy By Raman Thermometry

Abstract: In this work, we exemplify on a bulk silicon sample that Raman thermometry is capable of phonon mean free path (PMFP) spectroscopy. Our experimental approach is similar to the variation of different characteristic length scales $l_{c}$ during thermal reflectance measurements in the time or frequency domain and transient thermal grating spectroscopy. In place of $l_{c}$, we vary the laser focus spot size ($w_{e}$) and the light penetration depth ($h_{\alpha}$) during one-laser Raman thermometry (1LRT) measurements. For our largest $w_{e}$ values, the derived effective thermal conductivities $\kappa_{eff}$ converge towards the bulk thermal conductivity $\kappa_{bulk}$ for silicon. However, towards smaller $w_{e}$ values, we observe a pronounced increase for the $\kappa_{eff}$ values, which amounts up to a factor of 5.3 at 293K and even 8.3 at 200K. We mainly assign this phenomenon to quasi-ballistic phonon transport. As a result, we can compare our measured $\kappa_{eff}(w_{e})$ trends with the thermal accumulation function $\kappa_{cum}$ and its dependence on the phonon mean free path $l_{ph}$, which we derive from ab initio solutions of the linearized phonon Boltzmann transport equation (BTE). Since the variation of $w_{e}$ can be experimentally cumbersome, we also suggest varying $h_{\alpha}(\lambda)$ via the applied Raman laser wavelength $\lambda$ during 1LRT. In this regard, we present proof-of-principle 1LRT measurements, yielding a step-like $\kappa_{eff}(\lambda)$ trend for four different $\lambda$ values, which we also interpret in terms of quasi-ballistic phonon transport. Our results shall seed future PMFP spectroscopy based on 1LRT, which can directly be benchmarked against state-of-art theory by comparison of $\kappa_{\text{cum}}$ trends and not only $\kappa$ values, aiming to test our understanding of the intricate phonon transport physics.

Title: Pontus-Mpemba effects
Authors: Andrea Nava, Reinhold Egger
Abstract: Mpemba effects occur after a sudden quench of control parameters if for ''far'' (or ''hot'') initial states with respect to a final target state, the relaxation time toward the target state is shorter than for ''close'' (or ''cold'') initial states. Following a strategy of fishermen in Pontus described by Aristotle, we introduce the Pontus-Mpemba effect as a two-step protocol which includes the time needed for preparing the system in the ''far'' initial state. For Markovian (classical or quantum) systems coupled to multiple reservoirs, all possible Pontus-Mpemba effects fall into three classes. The theory is applied to open two-state systems where all three classes can be realized.

Title: Skyrmion stacking in stray field-coupled ultrathin ferromagnetic multilayers
Authors: N. J. Dubicki, V. V. Slastikov, A. Bernand-Mantel, C. B. Muratov
Abstract: This paper explores the energy landscape of ferromagnetic multilayer heterostructures that feature magnetic skyrmions -- tiny whirls of spins with non-trivial topology -- in each magnetic layer. Such magnetic heterostructures have been recently pursued as possible hosts of room temperature stable magnetic skyrmions suitable for the next generation of low power information technologies and unconventional computing. The presence of stacked skyrmions in the adjacent layers gives rise to a strongly coupled nonlinear system, whereby the induced magnetic field plays a crucial stabilizing role. Starting with the micromagnetic modeling framework, we derive a general reduced energy functional for a fixed number of ultrathin ferromagnetic layers with perpendicular magnetocrystalline anisotropy. We next investigate this energy functional in the regime in which the energy is dominated by the intralayer exchange interaction and formally obtain a finite-dimensional description governed by the energy of a system of one skyrmion per layer as a function of the position, radius and the rotation angle of each of theses skyrmions. For the latter, we prove that energy minimizers exist for all fixed skyrmion locations. We then focus on the simplest case of stray field-coupled ferromagnetic bilayers and completely characterize the energy minimizers. We show that the global energy minimizers exist and consist of two stray field-stabilized Néel skyrmions with antiparallel in-plane magnetization components. We also calculate the energy of two skyrmions of equal radius as a function of their separation distance.

Title: Chaotic percolation in the random geometry of maximum-density dimer packings
Authors: Ritesh Bhola, Kedar Damle
Abstract: Maximum-density dimer packings (maximum matchings) of non-bipartite site-diluted lattices, such as the triangular and Shastry-Sutherland lattices in $d=2$ dimensions and the stacked-triangular and corner-sharing octahedral lattices in $d=3$, generically exhibit a nonzero density of monomers (unmatched vertices). Following a construction in the recent literature, we use the structure theory of Gallai and Edmonds to decompose the disordered lattice into ``${\mathcal R}$-type'' regions which host the monomers of any maximum matching, and perfectly matched ``${\mathcal P}$-type'' regions from which such monomers are excluded. When the density $n_v$ of quenched vacancies lies well within the low-$n_v$ geometrically percolated phase of the disordered lattice, we find that the random geometry of these regions exhibits unusual {\em Gallai-Edmonds percolation} phenomena. In $d=2$, we find two phases separated by a critical point, namely a phase in which all ${\mathcal R}$-type and ${\mathcal P}$-type regions are small, and a percolated phase that displays a striking lack of self-averaging in the thermodynamic limit: Each sample has a single percolating region which is of type ${\mathcal R}$ with probability $f_{\mathcal R}$ and type ${\mathcal P}$ with probability $1-f_{\mathcal R}$, where $f_{\mathcal R} \approx 0.50(2)$ is independent of $n_v$ (away from the critical region). In this regime, microscopic changes in the vacancy configuration lead to chaotic changes in the large-scale structure of ${\mathcal R}$-type and ${\mathcal P}$-type regions. In $d=3$, apart from a phase with small ${\mathcal R}$-type and ${\mathcal P}$-type regions, the thermodynamic limit exhibits {\em four} distinct percolated phases separated by critical points at successively lower $n_v$, two of which again display unusual violations of self-averaging. Physical consequences are also discussed.

Title: Human-machine collaboration: ordering mechanism of rank-2 spin liquid on breathing pyrochlore lattice
Authors: Nicolas Sadoune, Ke Liu, Han Yan, Ludovic D.C. Jaubert, Nic Shannon, Lode Pollet
Abstract: Machine learning algorithms thrive on large data sets of good quality. Here we show that they can also excel in a typical research setting with little data of limited quality, through an interplay of insights coming from machine, and human researchers. The question we address is the unsolved problem of ordering out of a spin-liquid phase described by an emergent rank-2 U(1) gauge theory, as described by [H. Yan et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 127203 (2020)]. Published Monte Carlo simulations for this problem are consistent with a strong first-order phase transition, but were too noisy for the form of low-temperature order to be identified. Using a highly-interpretable machine learning approach based on a support vector machine with a tensorial kernel (TKSVM), we re-analyze this Monte Carlo data, gaining new information about the form of order that could in turn be interpreted by traditionally-trained physicists. We find that the low-temperature ordered phase is a form of magnetic order analogous to a smectic liquid crystal. This arises due to a subtle thermal order-by-disorder mechanism, that can be understood from the fluctuations of the tensor electric field of the parent rank-2 gauge theory. These results were obtained by a back-and-forth process which closely resembles a collaboration between human researchers and machines. We argue that this "collaborative" approach may provide a blueprint for solving other problems that have not yielded to human insights alone.

Title: Active drive towards elastic spinodals
Authors: Ayan Roychowdhury, Madan Rao, Lev Truskinovsky
Abstract: Active matter, exemplified by adaptive living materials such as the actomyosin cytoskeleton, can navigate material parameter space dynamically, leading to unconventional mechanical responses. In particular, it can self-drive toward elastic spinodal regimes, where inhomogeneous floppy modes induce elastic degeneracy and enable a controlled interplay between rigidity loss and recovery. Proximity to such marginal states leads to stress localization and the formation of force chains that can be actively assembled and disassembled. Here, we extend the classical notion of spinodal states to active solids and demonstrate how these extreme mechanical regimes can be actively accessed. Moreover, we show that in a nonlinear setting, crossing elastic spinodals generates new energy wells and makes force channeling an intrinsic feature of the emerging microstructure.

Title: Quantum many-body spin ratchets
Authors: Lenart Zadnik, Marko Ljubotina, Žiga Krajnik, Enej Ilievski, Tomaž Prosen
Abstract: Introducing a class of SU(2) invariant quantum unitary circuits generating chiral transport, we examine the role of broken space-reflection and time-reversal symmetries on spin transport properties. Upon adjusting parameters of local unitary gates, the dynamics can be either chaotic or integrable. The latter corresponds to a generalization of the space-time discretized (Trotterized) higher-spin quantum Heisenberg chain. We demonstrate that breaking of space-reflection symmetry results in a drift in the dynamical spin susceptibility. Remarkably, we find a universal drift velocity given by a simple formula which, at zero average magnetization, depends only on the values of SU(2) Casimir invariants associated with local spins. In the integrable case, the drift velocity formula is confirmed analytically based on the exact solution of thermodynamic Bethe ansatz equations. Finally, by inspecting the large fluctuations of the time-integrated current between two halves of the system in stationary maximum-entropy states, we demonstrate violation of the Gallavotti-Cohen symmetry, implying that such states cannot be regarded as equilibrium ones. We show that the scaled cumulant generating function of the time-integrated current instead obeys a generalized fluctuation relation.

Title: Excitonic topology and quantum geometry in organic semiconductors
Authors: Wojciech J. Jankowski, Joshua J.P. Thompson, Bartomeu Monserrat, Robert-Jan Slager
Abstract: Excitons drive the optoelectronic properties of organic semiconductors which underpin devices including solar cells and light-emitting diodes. Here we show that excitons can exhibit topologically non-trivial states protected by inversion symmetry and identify a family of organic semiconductors realising the predicted excitonic topological phases. We also demonstrate that the topological phase can be controlled through experimentally realisable strains and chemical functionalisation of the material. Appealing to quantum Riemannian geometry, we predict that topologically non-trivial excitons have a lower bound on their centre-of-mass spatial spread, which can significantly exceed the size of a unit cell. Furthermore, we show that the dielectric environment allows control over the excitonic quantum geometry. The discovery of excitonic topology and excitonic Riemannian geometry in organic materials brings together two mature fields and suggests many new possibilities for a range of future optoelectronic applications.

Title: A solvable embedding mechanism for one-dimensional spinless and Majorana fermions in higher-dimensional spin-1/2 magnets
Authors: Sumiran Pujari
Abstract: We write down a class of two-dimensional quantum spin-1/2 Hamiltonians whose eigenspectra are exactly solvable via the Jordan-Wigner transformation. The general structure corresponds to a suitable grid composed of XY or XX-Ising spin chains and ZZ-Ising spin chains and is generalizable to higher dimensions. They can host stacks of one-dimensional spinless fermion liquids with gapless excitations and power-law correlations coexisting with ordered spin moments (localized spinless fermions). Bond-dependent couplings thus can be an alternate mechanism than geometric frustration of SU(2)-symmetric couplings to obtain spinless fermionic excitations. Put in a different way, bond-dependent couplings allow for an embedding of one-dimensional spinless fermion (Tomonoga-Luttinger) liquids and solids and also Majorana excitations in higher dimensions. They can accommodate a simpler set of site-local conserved quantities apart from the more intricate, interlocked set of plaquette-local or bond-local conserved quantities in Kitaev's honeycomb model with Majorana excitations. The proposed grid structure may provide an architecture for quantum engineering with controllable qubits.

Title: Free energy barrier and thermal-quantum behavior of sliding bilayer graphene
Authors: Jean Paul Nery, Lorenzo Monacelli, Francesco Mauri
Abstract: In multilayer graphene, the stacking order of the layers plays a crucial role in the electronic properties and the manifestation of superconductivity. By applying shear stress, it is possible to induce sliding between different layers, altering the stacking order. Here, focusing on bilayer graphene, we analyze how ionic fluctuations alter the free energy barrier between different stacking equilibria. We calculate the free energy barrier through the state-of-the-art self-consistent harmonic approximation, which can be evaluated at unstable configurations. We find that above 100 K there is a large reduction of the barrier of more than 30% due to thermal vibrations, which significantly improves the agreement between previous first-principles theoretical work and experiments in a single graphite crystal. As the temperature increases, the barrier remains nearly constant up to around 500 K, with a more pronounced decrease only at higher temperatures. Our approach is general and paves the way for systematically accounting for thermal effects in free energy barriers of other macroscopic systems.

Title: Optical Absorption and Emission from Wannier-Stark Spectra of Moiré Superlattices
Authors: Vo Tien Phong, Francisco Guinea, Cyprian Lewandowski
Abstract: Using a formalism based on the non-Abelian Berry connection, we explore quantum geometric signatures of Wannier-Stark spectra in two-dimensional superlattices. The Stark energy can be written as \textit{intraband} Berry phases, while Zener tunneling is given by \textit{interband} Berry connections. We suggest that the gaps induced by interband hybridization can be probed by THz optical absorption and emission spectroscopy. This is especially relevant to modern moiré materials wherein mini-bands are often spectrally entangled, leading to strong interband hybridization in the Wannier-Stark regime. Furthermore, owing to their large superlattice constants, both the low-field and high-field regimes can be accessed in these materials using presently available technology. Importantly, even at moderate electric fields, we find that stimulated emission can dominate absorption, raising the possibility of lasing at practically relevant parameter regimes.

Title: A convolutional neural network technique for online tracking of the radius evolution of levitating evaporating microdroplets of pure liquids, liquid mixtures and suspensions
Authors: Kwasi Nyandey, Gennadiy Derkachov, Daniel Jakubczyk
Abstract: We have used convolutional neural network in a classification task to track the radius evolution of levitating evaporating microdroplets of pure diethylene glycol, diethylene glycol water polystyrene microparticles suspension, dipropylene glycol water mixture and dipropylene glycol water silica nanoparticles suspension. We discretized a wider radii range into short radii segments, labeled them with class numbers and generated theoretically light scattering patterns from Mie theory. Then the network was trained on the theoretical images and used to classify unlabeled experimentally recorded Mie scattering patterns from the evaporating microdroplets. A plot of the class average radii versus the camera s time step revealed the profile of the entire droplet radius evolution. We were able to work with approximately 1500 classes and showed that the technique has the potential to distinguish droplet size difference of 5 nm. We expect it to be applicable for online or real time tracking of droplet evaporation.

Title: Coexistence of high electron-mobility, unpaired spins, and superconductivity at high carrier density SrTiO$_3$-based interfaces
Authors: Thor Hvid-Olsen, Christina H. Christoffersen, Damon J. Carrad, Nicolas Gauquelin, Dags Olsteins, Johan Verbeeck, Nicolas Bergeal, Thomas S. Jespersen, Felix Trier
Abstract: The $t_{2g}$ band-structure of SrTiO$_3$-based two-dimensional electron gasses (2DEGs), have been found to play a role in features such as the superconducting dome, high-mobility transport, and the magnitude of spin-orbit coupling. This adds to the already very diverse range of phenomena, including magnetism and extreme magnetoresistance, exhibited by this particular material platform. Tuning and/or combining these intriguing attributes could yield significant progress within quantum and spintronics technologies. Doing so demands precise control of the parameters, which requires a better understanding of the factors that affect them. Here we present effects of the $t_{2g}$ band-order inversion, stemming from the growth of spinel-structured $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$ onto perovskite SrTiO$_3$. Electronic transport measurements show that with LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ as the reference, the carrier density and electron mobility are enhanced, and the sample displays a reshaping of the superconducting dome. Additionally, unpaired spins are evidenced by increasing Anomalous Hall Effect with decreasing temperature, entering the same temperature range as the superconducting transition, and a Kondo-like upturn in the sheet resistance. Finally, it is argued that the high-mobility $d_{xz/yz}$-band is more likely than the $d_{xy}$-band to host the supercurrent.

Title: Emergent inductors in non-helical magnets
Authors: Takahiro Anan, Takahiro Morimoto
Abstract: The emergent inductor, which is a concept of an inductor employing quantum mechanics on helical magnets, has been studied actively from both theoretical and experimental aspects. Interestingly, finite inductance has been observed not only in spiral magnetic phases but also across various other magnetic phases although the underlying mechanism behind emergent inductance in non-helical magnets remains unresolved. In this study, we broaden the concept of emergent inductance to encompass non-helical magnets and establish a comprehensive formalism of the emergent inductance generated by magnetization dynamics. Using a diagrammatic approach, we derive the linear response of current density mediated by magnetization dynamics and formulate impedance and inductance for general magnetic materials. We reveal that the emergent inductance is composed of two distinct components, each contributing positively or negatively. Notably, the positive inductance arises from Ohmic dissipation including the effect of the emergent electric field (Berry phase in real space) while the negative inductance arises from the polarization of itinerant electrons (Berry curvature in $k$-$t$ space). We also apply the present method to quasi 1D models and show the numerical results of the inductance, the spin dynamics, the impedance, and the Q-value.

Title: Fully nonequilibrium Hall response from Berry curvature
Authors: Shouvik Sur, Lei Chen, Yiming Wang, Chandan Setty, Silke Paschen, Qimiao Si
Abstract: In topological materials, Berry curvature leads to intrinsic Hall responses. Focusing on time-reversal symmetric systems with broken inversion symmetry, a spontaneoous (zero magnetic field) Hall effect is expected to develop under an applied electric field. Motivated by recent developments in Weyl-Kondo semimetals, here we advance a fully nonequilibrium (FNE) Hall response due to the Berry curvature. In particular, we show that, while the spontaneous Hall current is quadratic in the previously described regime of weak electric field, due to the contribution from the dipole moment of the Berry curvature, the FNE Hall response for non-perturbative electric fields is not controlled by the Berry curvature dipole. Remarkably, the FNE Hall response resembles what happens in systems that break the microscopic time-reversal symmetry. We illustrate the universality of these results by comparing them with their counterparts in systems with any higher-multipole of the Berry curvature. The implications of our results for the understanding of strongly correlated topological semimetals are discussed.

Title: Hole subband dispersions and strong `spin'-orbit coupling in a cylindrical Ge nanowire
Authors: Rui Li
Abstract: Quasi-one-dimensional hole gas is achievable in a semiconductor Ge nanowire. The lowest two subband dispersions of the hole gas are just two shifted parabolic curves with an anticrossing at $k_{z}=0$. This peculiar low-energy subband structure manifests the existence of a strong `spin' (pseudo spin)-orbit coupling. Based on the Luttinger-Kohn Hamiltonian in the axial approximation, we show two sets of combined dispersions that not only isolated from each other but also with strong `spin'-orbit coupling are obtainable in the presence of strong magnetic field. Realistic calculations are performed for three representative nanowire growth directions [001], [111], and [110]. These results are further confirmed via constructing the low-energy effective Hamiltonian of the hole gas. We also calculate the external electric field induced spin splitting for comparison with the magnetic field induced spin splitting.

Title: Non-linear Transport in Non-centrosymmetric Systems: From Fundamentals to Applications
Authors: Manuel Suárez-Rodríguez, Fernando De Juan, Ivo Souza, Marco Gobbi, Fèlix Casanova, Luis E. Hueso
Abstract: Ohm's law has been a cornerstone of electronics since its experimental discovery. This law establishes that in a conductive system, the voltage is directly proportional to the current. Even when time-reversal symmetry is disrupted, leading to the emergence of magnetoresistance and Hall effects, the linear relationship between voltage and current remains intact. However, recent experiments have demonstrated a breakdown of Ohm's law in non-centrosymmetric structures. In these systems, non-linear transport effects are permitted with quadratic scaling between voltages and currents. Here, we review the main demonstrations of non-linear transport in non-centrosymmetric systems, analyzing the connection between non-linear behavior and the system's symmetry. Additionally, we delve into the microscopic mechanisms driving these effects, such as Berry curvature dipole and Berry connection polarizability. Finally, we highlight potential applications of non-linear transport in spintronics and energy harvesting.

Title: Impurity effects in twisted carbon nanotubes
Authors: Yuriy G. Pogorelov, Volodymyr Turkowski, Vadim M. Loktev
Abstract: We consider electronic spectra of twisted carbon nanotubes and their perturbation by impurity atoms absorbed at different positions on nanotube surface within the framework of Anderson hybrid model. A special attention is given to the cases when 1D Weyl (massless Dirac) modes are present in the nanotube spectrum and their hybridization with localized impurity states produces, with growing impurity concentration c, onset of a mobility gap near the impurity level and then opening, at yet higher c, of some narrow range of delocalized states within this mobility gap. Such behaviors are compared with similar effects in the previously studied 2D graphene, carbon nanoribbons, and non-twisted carbon nanotubes. Some possible practical applications are discussed.

Authors: Pavel Marton, Marek Paściak, Mauro Gonçalves, Ondřej Novák, Jiří Hlinka, Richard Beanland, Marin Alexe
Abstract: Domain structures play a crucial role in the electric, mechanical and other properties of ferroelectric materials. In this study, we uncover the physical origins of the enigmatic zigzag domain structure in the prototypical multiferroic material BiFeO$_3$. Using phase-field simulations within the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire framework, we demonstrate that spatially-homogeneous defect charges result in domain structures that closely resemble those observed experimentally. The acquired understanding of the underlying physics of pyramidal-domain formation may enable the engineering of new materials with self-assembled domain structures exhibiting defined domain periodicity at the nanometre scale, opening avenues for advanced applications.

Title: Super-enhanced Sensitivity in Non-Hermitian Systems at Infernal Points
Authors: Shu-Xuan Wang, Zhongbo Yan
Abstract: The emergence of exceptional points in non-Hermitian systems represents an intriguing phenomenon characterized by the coalescence of eigenenergies and eigenstates. When a system approaches an exceptional point, it exhibits a heightened sensitivity to perturbations compared to the conventional band degeneracy observed in Hermitian systems. This sensitivity, manifested in the splitting of the eigenenergies, is amplified as the order of the exceptional point increases. Infernal points constitute a unique subclass of exceptional points, distinguished by their order escalating with the expansion of the system's size. In this paper, we show that, when a non-Hermitian system is at an infernal point, a perturbation of strength $\epsilon$, which couples the two opposing boundaries of the system, causes the eigenenergies to split according to the law $\sqrt[k]{\epsilon}$, where $k$ is an integer proportional to the system's size. Utilizing the perturbation theory of Jordan matrices, we demonstrate that the exceptional sensitivity of the eigenenergies at infernal points to boundary-coupling perturbations is a ubiquitous phenomenon, irrespective of the specific form of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. Notably, we find that this phenomenon remains robust even when the system deviates substantially from the infernal point. The universal nature and robustness of this phenomenon suggest potential applications in enhancing sensor sensitivity.

Title: Measurement of parity-dependent energy-phase relation of the low-energy states in a potential artificial Kitaev chain utilizing a transmon qubit

Abstract: Artificial Kitaev chains have emerged as a promising platform for realizing topological quantum computing. Once the chains are formed and the Majorana zero modes are braided/fused, reading out the parity of the chains is essential for further verifying the non-Abelian property of the Majorana zero modes. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of using a superconducting transmon qubit, which incorporates an end of a four-site quantum dot-superconductor chain based on a Ge/Si nanowire, to directly detect the singlet/doublet state, and thus the parity of the entire chain. We also demonstrate that for multiple-dot chains there are two types of 0-{\pi} transitions between different charging states: the parity-flip 0-{\pi} transition and the parity-preserved 0-{\pi} transition. Furthermore, we show that the inter-dot coupling, hence the strengths of cross Andreev reflection and elastic cotunneling of electrons, can be adjusted by local electrostatic gating in chains fabricated on Ge/Si core-shell nanowires. Our exploration would be helpful for the ultimate realization of topological quantum computing based on artificial Kitaev chains.

Title: Tailoring Synthetic Gauge Fields in Ultracold Atoms via Spatially Engineered Vector Beams
Authors: Huan Wang, Shangguo Zhu, Yun Long, Mingbo Pu, Xiangang Luo
Abstract: Ultracold atoms, typically manipulated by scalar beams with uniform polarization, have propelled advances in quantum simulation, computation, and metrology. Yet, vector beams (VBs) -- structured light with spatially varying polarization -- remain unexplored in this context, despite their enhanced tunability and broad optical applications. Here, we demonstrate a novel scheme to generate synthetic gauge fields in ultracold atoms via VB-mediated coupling of internal states. This approach enables angular stripe phases across an expanded parameter range, achieving a three-order-of-magnitude enhancement in the phase diagram and facilitating experimental observation. We further present an all-optical method to create topologically nontrivial giant skyrmions in spin space, with tunable topology governed by VB parameters. Our findings establish VBs as powerful tools for quantum control and the exploration of exotic quantum states and phases.

Title: Fluctuation Dissipation Relations for the Non-Reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard Model
Authors: Martin Kjøllesdal Johnsrud, Ramin Golestanian
Abstract: Recent results demonstrate how deviations from equilibrium fluctuation-dissipation theorem can be quantified for active field theories by deriving exact fluctuations dissipation relations that involve the entropy production [M. K. Johnsrud and R. Golestanian, arXiv:2409.14977]. Here we develop and employ diagrammatic tools to perform perturbative calculations for a paradigmatic active field theory, the Non-Reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard (NRCH) model. We obtain analytical results, which serve as an illustration of how to implement the recently developed framework to active field theories, and help to illuminate the specific non-equilibrium characteristics of the NRCH field theory.

Due to the parabolic nature of the spectra, caused by quadratic-in-momentum dependence, there exist evanescent waves, which decay exponentially as we move away from the junction represented by the location of the delta-function potential. Investigating the possibility of the appearance of bound states, we find that their energies appear as pairs of $\pm |E_b |$, reflecting the presence of the imaginary-valued wavevectors at both positive and negative values of energies of the propagating quasiparticles.

Title: Enhancement of temperature of quantum anomalous Hall effect in two-dimensional germanene/magnetic semiconductor heterostructures
Authors: Qing-Han Yang, Jia-Wen Li, Xin-Wei Yi, Xiang Li, Jing-Yang You, Gang Su, Bo Gu
Abstract: Quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) is significant for future low-power electronics devices, where a main challenge is realizing QAHE at high temperatures. In this work, based on experimentally reported two-dimensional (2D) germanene and magnetic semiconductors Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ and Cr$_2$Si$_2$Te$_6$, and the first principle calculations, germanene/magnetic semiconductor heterostructures are investigated. Topologically nontrivial edge states and quantized anomalous Hall conductance are demonstrated. It is shown that the QAHE temperature can be enhanced to approximately 62 K in germanene/monolayer (ML) Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ with 2.1\% tensile strain, 64 K in germanene/bilayer (BL) Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ with 1.4\% tensile strain, and 50 K in germanene/ML Cr$_2$Si$_2$Te$_6$ with 1.3\% tensile strain. With increasing tensile strain of these heterostructures, the band gap decreases and the Curie temperature rises, and the highest temperature of QAHE is obtained. Since these 2D materials were discovered in recent experiments, our results provide promising materials for achieving high-temperature QAHE.

Title: Kitaev interaction and proximate higher-order skyrmion crystal in the triangular lattice van der Waals antiferromagnet NiI2

Abstract: Topological spin textures, such as magnetic skyrmions, are a spectacular manifestation of magnetic frustration and anisotropy. Most known skyrmion systems are restricted to a topological charge of one, require an external magnetic field for stabilization, and are only reported in a few materials. Here, we investigate the possibility that the Kitaev anisotropic-exchange interaction stabilizes a higher-order skyrmion crystal in the insulating van der Waals magnet NiI2. We unveil and explain the incommensurate static and dynamic magnetic correlations across three temperature-driven magnetic phases of this compound using neutron scattering measurements, simulations, and modeling. Our parameter optimisation yields a minimal Kitaev-Heisenberg Hamiltonian for NiI2 which reproduces the experimentally observed magnetic excitations. Monte Carlo simulations for this model predict the emergence of the higher-order skyrmion crystal but neutron diffraction and optical experiments in the candidate intermediate temperature regime are inconclusive. We discuss possible deviations from the Kitaev-Heisenberg model that explains our results and conclude that NiI2, in addition to multiferroic properties in the bulk and few-layer limits, is a Kitaev bulk material proximate to the finite temperature higher-order skyrmion crystal phase.

Title: Dynamics of soft interacting particles on a comb
Authors: Davide Venturelli, Pierre Illien, Aurélien Grabsch, Olivier Bénichou
Abstract: We study the dynamics of overdamped Brownian particles interacting through soft pairwise potentials on a comb-like structure. Within the linearized Dean-Kawasaki framework, we characterize the particle density fluctuations by computing their one- and two-point correlation functions. For a tracer particle constrained to move along the comb backbone, we determine the spatial correlation profile between its position and the density of surrounding bath particles. Furthermore, we derive the correction to the diffusion coefficient of the tracer due to interactions with other particles, validating our results through numerical simulations.

Title: Rapid low-temperature synthesis of graphene-coated SiC substrates for remote and van der Waals epitaxy
Authors: Se H. Kim, Hanjoo Lee, Dong Gwan Kim, Donghan Kim, Seugki Kim, Hyunho Yang, Yunsu Jang, Jangho Yoon, Hyunsoo Kim, Seoyong Ha, ByoungTak Lee, Jung-Hee Lee, Roy Byung Kyu Chung, Hongsik Park, Sungkyu Kim, Tae Hoon Lee, Hyun S. Kum
Abstract: Non-conventional epitaxial techniques, such as van der Waals epitaxy (vdWE) and remote epitaxy, have attracted substantial attention in the semiconductor research community for their capability to repeatedly produce high-quality free-standing films from a single mother wafer. Successful implementation of these epitaxial techniques depends on creating a robust, uniform two-dimensional (2D) material surface. The conventional method for fabricating graphene on silicon carbide (SiC) is high-temperature graphitization. However, the extremely high temperature required for silicon sublimation (typically above 1500 °C) causes step-bunching of the SiC surface, forming non-uniform multilayer graphene stripes and an unfavorable surface morphology for epitaxial growth. Here, we developed a wafer-scale graphitization technique that allows fast synthesis of single-crystalline graphene at ultra-low temperatures by metal-assisted graphitization (MAG). We found annealing conditions that enable SiC dissociation while avoiding silicide formation, producing uniform single-crystalline graphene while maintaining the surface morphology of the substrate. The graphene thickness can be controlled by varying the metal thickness or annealing temperature, enabling remote epitaxy or vdWE. We successfully produced freestanding single-crystalline III-N (AlN, GaN) films on graphene/SiC via the 2D material-based layer transfer technique. Our results show that low-temperature graphene synthesis via MAG offers a promising route to producing large-scale ultra-wide bandgap free-standing crystalline membranes.

Title: On the possibility of chiral symmetry breaking in liquid hydrogen peroxide
Authors: Roberto Menta, Pablo G. Debenedetti, Roberto Car, Pablo M. Piaggi
Abstract: Molecular chirality is a key concept in chemistry with implications for the origin of life and the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals. Previous simulations of a chiral molecular model with an energetic bias towards homochiral interactions show a spontaneous symmetry-breaking transition from a supercritical racemic liquid into a subcritical liquid enriched in one of the two enantiomers. Here, we employ molecular dynamics simulations in order to test the possible existence of this phenomenon in hydrogen peroxide, the smallest chiral molecule. For this purpose, we study the fluid phase of this substance between 100 K and 1500 K, and from $10^{-4}$ GPa to 1 GPa. We find a glass transition and we suggest that hydrogen bonds play a central role in such behavior. We also test the possibility of observing chiral symmetry breaking by performing both constant temperature and cooling simulations at multiple pressures, and we do not observe the phenomenon. An analysis of the structure of the liquid shows negligible differences between homochiral and heterochiral interactions, supporting the difficulty in observing chiral symmetry breaking. If hydrogen peroxide manifests spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking, it likely takes place significantly below room temperature and is hidden by other phenomena, such as the glass transition or crystallization. More broadly, our results, and recent experimental observations, suggest that greater molecular complexity is needed for spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in the liquid phase to occur.

Title: Predicting Heteropolymer Phase Separation Using Two-Chain Contact Maps
Authors: Jessica Jin, Wesley Oliver, Michael A. Webb, William M. Jacobs
Abstract: Phase separation in polymer solutions often correlates with single-chain and two-chain properties, such as the single-chain radius of gyration, Rg, and the pairwise second virial coefficient, B22. However, recent studies have shown that these metrics can fail to distinguish phase-separating from non-phase-separating heteropolymers, including intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Here we introduce an approach to predict heteropolymer phase separation from two-chain simulations by analyzing contact maps, which capture how often specific monomers from the two chains are in physical proximity. Whereas B22 summarizes the overall attraction between two chains, contact maps preserve spatial information about their interactions. To compare these metrics, we train phase-separation classifiers for both a minimal heteropolymer model and a chemically specific, residue-level IDP model. Remarkably, simple statistical properties of two-chain contact maps predict phase separation with high accuracy, vastly outperforming classifiers based on Rg and B22 alone. Our results thus establish a transferable and computationally efficient method to uncover key driving forces of IDP phase behavior based on their physical interactions in dilute solution.

Title: Crystallization of the transdimensional electron liquid
Authors: Igor V. Bondarev, Alexandra Boltasseva, Jacob B. Khurgin, Vladimir M. Shalaev
Abstract: Wigner crystallization of free electrons at room temperature is explored for a new class of metallic ultrathin (transdimensional) materials whose properties can be controlled by their thickness. Our calculations of the critical electron density, temperature and the melting curve show that by reducing the material thickness one can Wigner-crystallize free electrons at room temperature to get them pinned onto a two-dimensional triangular lattice of a supersolid inside of the crystalline material. Such a solid melts and freezes reversibly with increase and decrease of electron doping or temperature, whereby its resistivity behaves opposite to the free electron gas model predictions.

Title: $3d$ flat bands and coupled $4f$ moments in the kagome-honeycomb permanent magnet Sm$_{2}$Co$_{17}$

Abstract: Rare earth permanent magnets (REPMs) with both localized moments and itinerant conduction bands are not only important for fundamental research but also have significant technological applications. In particular, Sm$_{\rm 2}$Co$_{\rm 17}$ is a prototypical high-temperture REPM, where the Co atoms form a kagome-honeycomb stacked lattice. Here we report synthesis of epitaxial Sm$_{\rm 2}$Co$_{\rm 17}$ films using molecular beam epitaxy and measurements of their momentum-resolved electronic structure from \textit{in-situ} angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Our results unveil two flat bands from Co $3d$ orbitals near the Fermi level ($E_F$), one at $\sim$\,--300\,meV and another right at $E_F$, which arise from orbital-selective destructive interference and strong electron correlations, respectively. In addition, our results reveal that Sm $4f$ states are far away from $E_F$ (hence mostly localized) and exhibit an anomalous temperature dependence, caused by the $3d$-$4f$ magnetic coupling. Our findings provide direct spectroscopic insights to understand the strong uniaxial ferromagnetism in Sm$_{\rm 2}$Co$_{\rm 17}$ (and REPMs alike). Our work also opens avenues to explore flat-band physics near $E_F$ and emergent phenomena in correlated kagome-honeycomb lattices.

Title: Incommensurate and commensurate antiferromagnetic orders in the kagome compound UV$_{6}$Sn$_{6}$

Abstract: We report on the synthesis of single crystals of the kagome compound, UV$_6$Sn$_6$, and present the results of magnetization, electrical resistivity, heat capacity, x-ray, and neutron diffraction experiments to characterize the structure and magnetic properties. UV$_6$Sn$_6$ crystallizes in a large supercell of the HfFe$_6$Ge$_6$ parent structure with an hexagonal symmetry in which some of the U atoms are shifted by $c/2$ in an ordered fashion. Below $T_{N1}\approx$ 29 K, an incommensurate magnetic structure with a temperature-dependent wave vector $(0,0,k_z)$ is observed. Below $T_{N2}=$ 23.5 K, the wave vector locks in to $(0,0,0.5)$, forming an antiferromagnetic ground state. The U moments align along the $c$ axis retaining a large magnetic anisotropy. These findings highlight the role of the $5f$ orbitals from uranium in this structural family in driving both magnetic ordering and structural modulation and distinguish UV$_6$Sn$_6$ from its lanthanide-based analogs.

Title: Synthesis of intrinsic magnetic topological insulator MnBi2nTe3n+1 family by chemical vapor transport method with feedback regulation
Authors: Heng Zhang, Yiying Zhang, Yong Zhang, Bo Chen, Jingwen Guo, Yu Du, Jiajun Li, Hangkai Xie, Zhixin Zhang, Fuwei Zhou, Tianqi Wang, Wuyi Qi, Xuefeng Wang, Fucong Fei, Fengqi Song
Abstract: MnBi2nTe3n+1 (MBT) is a representative family of intrinsic magnetic topological insulators, in which numerous exotic phenomena such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect are expected. The high-quality crystal growth and magnetism manipulation are the most essential processes. Here we develop a modified chemical vapor transport method using a feedback-regulated strategy, which provides the closed-loop control of growth temperature within +/- 0.1 degree Celsius. Single crystals of MnBi2Te4, MnBi4Te7, and MnBi6Te10 are obtained under different temperature intervals respectively, and show variable tunability on magnetism by finely tuning the growth temperatures. Specifically, the cold-end temperatures not only vary the strength of antiferromagnetic coupling in MnBi2Te4, but also induce magnetic ground state transitions from antiferromagnetism to ferromagnetism in MnBi4Te7 and MnBi6Te10. In MnBi2Te4 with optimized magnetism, quantized transport with Chern insulator state is also realized at the low field of 3.7 T. Our results provide a systematic picture for the crystal growth and the rich magnetic tunability of MBT family, providing richer platforms for the related researches combining magnetism and topological physics.

Title: Non-Hermitian Multipole Skin Effects Challenge Localization
Authors: Jacopo Gliozzi, Federico Balducci, Taylor L. Hughes, Giuseppe De Tomasi
Abstract: We study the effect of quenched disorder on the non-Hermitian skin effect in systems that conserve a U(1) charge and its associated multipole moments. In particular, we generalize the Hatano-Nelson argument for a localization transition in disordered, non-reciprocal systems to the interacting case. When only U(1) charge is conserved, we show that there is a transition between a skin effect phase, in which charges cluster at a boundary, and a many-body localized phase, in which charges localize at random positions. In the dynamics of entanglement, this coincides with an area to volume law transition. For systems without boundaries, the skin effect becomes a delocalized phase with a unidirectional current. If dipoles or higher multipoles are conserved, we show that the non-Hermitian skin effect remains stable to arbitrary disorder. Counterintuitively, the system is therefore always delocalized under periodic boundary conditions, regardless of disorder strength.

Title: A Strong-Coupling-Limit Study on the Pairing Mechanism in the Pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$
Authors: Jia-Heng Ji, Chen Lu, Zhi-Yan Shao, Zhiming Pan, Fan Yang, Congjun Wu
Abstract: Recently, the bilayer perovskite nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has been reported to exhibit high-temperature superconductivity near $80$ K under a moderate pressure of about $14$GPa. To investigate the underlying pairing mechanism and symmetry in this complex system, we propose and analyze a mixed spin-$1$ and spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ bilayer $t$-$J$ model in the strong coupling regime. This model explicitly incorporates the crucial role of strong Hund's coupling, which favors the formation of local spin-triplet states from the two onsite $E_g$ orbital electrons at half-filling. We further investigate the model using both slave-particle mean-field theory and the density matrix renormalization group method. Our simulation results reveal that the dominate pairing channel is the interlayer one in the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. The Hund's coupling is shown to enhance superconductivity within a reasonable physical range. Moreover, electron doping strengthens superconductivity by increasing carrier density; in contrast, hole doping weakens superconductivity. These findings offer critical insights into the unconventional superconductivity of pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and underline the important role of orbital-selective behavior and Hund's rule.

Title: Analytic solution for the nonlinear response of magnetic nanoparticles to large-amplitude oscillatory fields
Authors: Patrick Ilg
Abstract: Nonlinear responses of physical systems to strong perturbations are notoriously difficult to tackle analytically. Here, we present analytic results for the nonlinear response of magnetic nanoparticles to large amplitude oscillatory magnetic fields based on a particular model for the magnetization dynamics. A number of characteristic features of the in-phase and out-of-phase higher-harmonic response are found and analyzed. In particular we find that the magnitude of higher harmonic contributions Rn depends on the field amplitude and frequency only via a single scaling variable that combines the two quantities. The decrease of |Rn|with increasing order nof harmonics is a key quantity monitored in biomedical applications such as magnetic particle spectroscopy and magnetic particle imaging. Except for the first few harmonics, we find that this decrease is exponential with a rate that depends on the scaling variable only. For not too high frequencies and not loo large amplitudes, we find that these exact results for one particular model of magnetization dynamics hold approximately also for other, more frequently used models. Our results therefore offer not only deeper insight into strongly nonlinear responses of magnetic nanoparticles, especially for higher harmonics that are very difficult to determine numerically, but also suggest analyzing data in terms of a scaling variable.

Title: Shot-noise in strongly-correlated double quantum spin Hall edges
Authors: Andreas Tsantilas, Trithep Devakul, Julian May-Mann
Abstract: We consider the effects of interactions on the edges of "double" quantum spin Hall insulators (DQSHIs), motivated by recent experiments on moiré twisted metal dichalcogenides. Without interactions, a DQSHI can be understood as two identical copies of a conventional quantum spin Hall insulator. If interactions are present and $s^z$-spin is conserved, we show that there are two possible phases for the DQSHI edge. First is a weakly-correlated edge which has two pairs of helical modes and is adiabatically equivalent to two conventional quantum spin Hall edges. Second is a strongly-correlated edge with only one pair of helical modes. The strongly-correlated edge also has a gap to single-electrons, but is gapless to pairs of electrons. In a quantum point contact geometry, this single-electron gap leads to a Fano factor of $2$ in shot noise measurements, compared to a Fano factor of $1$ for a weakly-correlated edge.

Title: Oxyfluoride glasses obtained through incorporation of CaF$_2$ into photovoltaic cover glass melts

Abstract: The glass industry has limited options to mitigate its environmental footprint, and the demand for cover glass to produce photovoltaic panels is increasing. Currently, the majority of this special type of glass is not being recycled, and in this work, we propose to reuse it as raw material to obtain oxyfluoride glasses. The incorporation of CaF$_2$ and the increasing Na$_2$CO$_3$ content resulted in a melting temperature of about 1200$^o$C, significantly lower than in soda-lime glasses, which adds up to the environmental benefits of reusing end-of-life cover glass. The obtained samples show high transparency and thermal stability, allowing the cover glass to make up to 80\% of its weight. XRF analysis was employed to determine the elemental composition of the samples, while XRD and Raman indicated that by adding CaF$_2$, the glass network was depolymerized. In situ XRD as a function of temperature showed the formation of a few crystalline phases in these oxyfluoride samples, evidencing that it can be explored as a matrix to obtain different glass-ceramics. The combination of the glass properties indicates that this method and the resulting material can contribute to reducing the environmental impact of the glass industry, by creating new glass or glass-ceramic materials that can be obtained at a reduced temperature compared to the soda-lime glass, while cover glass being the primary raw material could reduce the need to extract minerals from nature.

Title: Tunable and Persistent Polarization in Centrosymmetric Oxides

Abstract: Introducing symmetry breaking in materials enables the emergence of functionalities. This can be microscopically and macroscopically driven by applying external stimuli such as mechanical stress, electric field, temperature, and chemical modification. For instance, non-zero net dipole moments are formed in a material with the presence of local charged defects or their clusters, which can alter the crystal structure, charge states, and electrostatic potential across the material. Here, we demonstrate a conceptual approach to defects-mediated symmetry breaking that allows for built-in polarization in a centrosymmetric oxide, $\mathrm{Gd}_x\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x}\mathrm{O}_{2-\delta}$ (CGO) films, via creating a macroscopic charge asymmetry. Our results show that switchable and enduring polarization in CGO films is governed by the redistribution of oxygen vacancies. This leads to notable and persistent pyroelectric effects with coefficient of approximately 180 $\mu\mathrm{C}\cdot\mathrm{m}^{-2}\cdot\mathrm{K}^{-1}$. Our findings highlight the potential to develop high-performance, sustainable, environmentally friendly polar film materials by manipulating ionic defects from their centrosymmetric ground states. This approach provides new opportunities to expand polar materials in current and future energy and electronic applications.

Title: Achieving accurate entropy and melting point by ab initio molecular dynamics and zentropy theory: Application to fluoride and chloride molten salts
Authors: Shun-Li Shang, Nigel L. E. Hew, Rushi Gong, Cillian Cockrell, Paul A. Bingham, Xiaofeng Guo, Qi-Jun Hong, Zi-Kui Liu
Abstract: We have recently developed a breakthrough methodology for rapidly computing entropy in both solids and liquids by integrating a multiscale entropy approach (known as zentropy theory) with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. This approach enables entropy estimation from a single MD trajectory by analyzing the probabilities of local structural configurations and atomic distributions, effectively addressing the long-standing challenge of capturing configurational entropy. Here, we demonstrate the power of this method by predicting entropies, enthalpies, and melting points for 25 binary and ternary chlorite- and fluoride-based molten salts using ab initio MD (AIMD) simulations. The strong agreement between our predictions and experimental data underscores the potential of this approach to transform computational thermodynamics, offering accurate, efficient, and direct predictions of thermodynamic properties across both solid and liquid phases.

Title: Delayed Active Swimmer in a Velocity Landscape
Authors: Viktor Holubec, Alexander Fischer, Giovanni Volpe, Frank Cichos
Abstract: Self-propelled active particles exhibit delayed responses to environmental changes, modulating their propulsion speed through intrinsic sensing and feedback mechanisms. This adaptive behavior fundamentally determines their dynamics and self-organization in active matter systems, with implications for biological microswimmers and engineered microrobots. Here, we investigate active Brownian particles whose propulsion speed is governed by spatially varying activity landscapes, incorporating a temporal delay between environmental sensing and speed adaptation. Through analytical solutions derived for both short-time and long-time delay regimes, we demonstrate that steady-state density and polarization profiles exhibit maxima at characteristic delays. Significantly, we observe that the polarization profile undergoes sign reversal when the swimming distance during the delay time exceeds the characteristic diffusion length, providing a novel mechanism for controlling particle transport without external fields. Our theoretical predictions, validated through experimental observations and numerical simulations, establish time delay as a crucial control parameter for particle transport and organization in active matter systems. These findings provide insights into how biological microorganisms might use response delays to gain navigation advantages and suggest design principles for synthetic microswimmers with programmable responses to heterogeneous environments.

Title: Pull-off force prediction in viscoelastic adhesive Hertzian contact by physics augmented machine learning
Authors: Ali Maghami, Merten Stender, Antonio Papangelo
Abstract: Understanding and predicting the adhesive properties of viscoelastic Hertzian contacts is crucial for diverse engineering applications, including robotics, biomechanics, and advanced material design. The maximum adherence force of a Hertzian indenter unloaded from a viscoelastic substrate has been studied with analytical and numerical models. Analytical models are valid within their assumptions, numerical methods offer precision but can be computationally expensive, necessitating alternative solutions. This study introduces a novel physics-augmented machine learning (PA-ML) framework as a hybrid approach, bridging the gap between analytical models and data-driven solutions, which is capable of rapidly predicting the pull-off force in an Hertzian profile unloaded from a broad band viscoelastic material, with varying Tabor parameter, preload and retraction rate. Compared to previous models, the PA-ML approach provides fast yet accurate predictions in a wide range of conditions, properly predicting the effective surface energy and the work-to-pull-off. The integration of the analytical model provides critical guidance to the PA-ML framework, supporting physically consistent predictions. We demonstrate that physics augmentation enhances predictive accuracy, reducing mean squared error (MSE) while increasing model efficiency and interpretability. We provide data-driven and PA-ML models for real-time predictions of the adherence force in soft materials like silicons and elastomers opening to the possibility to integrate PA-ML into materials and interface design. The models are openly available on Zenodo and GitHub.

Title: Unveiling the thermal transport properties of Biphenylene nanotubes: A molecular dynamics study
Authors: Jhionathan de Lima, Cristiano F. Woellner
Abstract: Biphenylene nanotubes (BPNNTs) represent a novel class of carbon-based nanomaterials, constructed by rolling a biphenylene network (BPN) monolayer into a one-dimensional tubular structure. In this study, the thermal transport properties of BPNNTs are investigated using reverse non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. At room temperature, the lattice thermal conductivity of armchair and zigzag BPNNTs is found to be approximately 100 W/m.K and 90 W/m.K, respectively. These values are at least one order of magnitude lower than those of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). This significant reduction is attributed to the unique atomic arrangement of BPNNTs, which promotes enhanced phonon scattering and significantly lower phonon group velocity. Furthermore, the effects of nanotube length, diameter, and temperature on thermal transport are systematically analyzed. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying the geometry- and temperature-dependent thermal behavior, a comprehensive analysis of phonon dispersion relations, vibrational density of states, and phonon group velocities is conducted. This study offers valuable insight into the thermal transport properties of BPNNTs, with implications for thermal management and energy-related applications.

Title: Emergence of the electronic states by quantum charge fluctuations in electron-doped high-$T_c$ cuprate superconductors
Authors: Hiroshi Yamaguchi, Yudai Miyai, Yuki. Tsubota, Masashi Atira, Hitoshi Sato, Dongjoon Song, Kiyoshia Tanakae, Kenya Shimada, Shin-ichiro Ideta
Abstract: The origin of electron-boson interactions is a key to understanding the mechanism of high-$T_c$ superconductivity in cuprates. While interactions with phonons and magnetic fluctuations are widely considered to mediate electron pairing in cuprates, the role of charge fluctuations, which is one of the fundamental degrees of freedom, remains unclear. Here, we performed angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and angle-resolved inverse photoemission spectroscopy (AR-IPES) to investigate the electronic structure of the occupied and unoccupied states, respectively, in the electron-doped high-$T_c$ cuprate superconductor Nd$_{2-x}$Ce$_x$CuO$_4$. We found emergent spectral features in both the occupied (ARPES) and unoccupied states (AR-IPES), which are likely induced by charge fluctuations. The present study paves the way for a deeper understanding of the relationship between quantum charge fluctuations and superconductivity.

Title: Characterization of phospholipid-cholesterol bilayers as self-assembled amphiphile block polymers that contain headgroups
Authors: Xiaoyuan Wang, Fredric S. Cohen, Shixin Xu, Yongqiang Cai
Abstract: Cholesterol is known to modulate the structure and function of biological membranes. In this study, we use self-consistent field theory (SCFT) to investigate phospholipid/cholesterol bilayer membranes modeled with two types of diblock copolymers. These copolymer-based bilayers serve as biomimetic platforms with applications in areas such as drug delivery. Our simulations identify a minimum free energy configuration characterized by phospholipid tails tilted relative to the membrane normal. The model quantitatively captures the well-known area condensation effect as cholesterol concentration increases, along with membrane thickening and reduced tilt angle. Thermodynamically, we observe a linear dependence between cholesterol's chemical potential and its concentration within the 37-50% range, consistent with experimental results. Additionally, we analyze the effects of block copolymer length and headgroup interactions on bilayer structure. Interactions between phospholipid headgroups and the solvent emerge as the most influential. This work provides a theoretical framework for understanding cholesterol's regulatory role in membrane structure and mechanics.

Title: Emergence of cross-layer composite spins in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ under pressure and possible routes to enhance its superconductivity
Authors: Ruoshi Jiang, Zhiyu Fan, Bartomeu Monserrat, Wei Ku
Abstract: Trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ has been recently found to exhibit superconductivity in its high-pressure phase, similar to the previously discovered bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, but with a notably lower transition temperature. To date the pressure effects on the electronic correlations beneficial for unconventional superconductivity remains unclear, as well as the potential similarities or differences compared to the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. We use a multi-energy-scale derivation of the inter-layer electron dynamics to identify the dominant emergent spin-charge correlations in trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. Similar to the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, we find fractionalization of ionic spins in the high-pressure phase that results in cuprate-like spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ ions correlated with itinerant carriers. This suggests a similar superconducting mechanism in other nickelate and cuprate superconductors. Interestingly, extra composite spins emerge as cross-layer trimers in the trilayer system, whose suppression of ionic spin fluctuations naturally explains the weaker superconductivity observed in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, and indicates that lowering layer symmetry is a viable strategy to improve superconductivity in this trilayer nickelate.

Title: Mesoscopic Hamiltonian for Josephson travelling-wave parametric amplifiers
Authors: T.H.A. van der Reep
Abstract: We present a theory describing parametric amplification in a Josephson junction embedded transmission line. We will focus on the process of four-wave mixing under the assumption of an undepleted pump. However, the approach taken is quite general, such that a different parametric process or the process under different assumptions is easily derived. First the classical theory of the coupled-mode equations as presented by O'Brien et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. $\mathbf{113}:157001$] is shortly reviewed. Then a derivation of the full quantum theory is given using mesoscopic quantisation techniques in terms of discrete mode operators. This results in a Hamiltonian that describes the process of parametric amplification. We show that the coupled-mode equations can be derived from this Hamiltonian in the classical limit and elaborate on the validity of the theory.

Title: Protecting information in a parametrically driven hybrid quantum system
Authors: Siddharth Tiwary, Harsh Sharma, Himadri Shekhar Dhar
Abstract: The transfer and storage of quantum information in a hybrid quantum system, consisting of an ensemble of atoms or spins interacting with a cavity, is adversely affected by the inhomogeneity of the spins, which negates the coherent exchange of excitations between the physical components. Using a full quantum treatment based on variational renormalization group, we show how quantum information encoded in the states of a parametrically driven hybrid system is strongly protected against any decoherence that may arise due to the inhomogeneity in the spin-ensemble.

Title: Extracting topological orders of generalized Pauli stabilizer codes in two dimensions
Authors: Zijian Liang, Yijia Xu, Joseph T. Iosue, Yu-An Chen
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an algorithm for extracting topological data from translation invariant generalized Pauli stabilizer codes in two-dimensional systems, focusing on the analysis of anyon excitations and string operators. The algorithm applies to $\mathbb{Z}_d$ qudits, including instances where $d$ is a nonprime number. This capability allows the identification of topological orders that differ from the $\mathbb{Z}_d$ toric codes. It extends our understanding beyond the established theorem that Pauli stabilizer codes for $\mathbb{Z}_p$ qudits (with $p$ being a prime) are equivalent to finite copies of $\mathbb{Z}_p$ toric codes and trivial stabilizers. The algorithm is designed to determine all anyons and their string operators, enabling the computation of their fusion rules, topological spins, and braiding statistics. The method converts the identification of topological orders into computational tasks, including Gaussian elimination, the Hermite normal form, and the Smith normal form of truncated Laurent polynomials. Furthermore, the algorithm provides a systematic approach for studying quantum error-correcting codes. We apply it to various codes, such as self-dual CSS quantum codes modified from the 2d honeycomb color code and non-CSS quantum codes that contain the double semion topological order or the six-semion topological order.

Title: Further results on the power-law decay of the fraction of the mixed eigenstates in kicked-top model with mixed-type classical phase space
Authors: Hua Yan, Qian Wang, Marko Robnik
Abstract: By using the Krylov subspace technique to generate the spin coherent states in kicked top model, a prototype model for studying quantum chaos, the accessible system size for studying the Husimi functions of eigenstates can be much larger than that reported in the literature and our previous study Phys. Rev. E 108, 054217 (2023) [arXiv:2308.04824]. In the fully chaotic kicked top, we find that the mean Wehrl entropy localization measure approaches the prediction given by the Circular Unitary Ensemble. In the mixed-type case, we identify mixed eigenstates by the overlap of the Husimi function with regular and chaotic regions in classical compact phase space. Numerically, we show that the fraction of mixed eigenstates scales as $j^{-\zeta}$, a power-law decay as the system size $j$ increases, across nearly two orders of magnitude. This provides supporting evidence for the principle of uniform semiclassical condensation of Husimi functions and the Berry-Robnik picture in the semiclassical limit.

Title: Strict area law entanglement versus chirality
Authors: Xiang Li, Ting-Chun Lin, John McGreevy, Bowen Shi
Abstract: Chirality is a property of a gapped phase of matter in two spatial dimensions that can be manifested through non-zero thermal or electrical Hall conductance. In this paper, we prove two no-go theorems that forbid such chirality for a quantum state in a finite dimensional local Hilbert space with strict area law entanglement entropies. As a crucial ingredient in the proofs, we introduce a new quantum information-theoretic primitive called instantaneous modular flow, which has many other potential applications.

Title: Modeling Structured Data Learning with Restricted Boltzmann Machines in the Teacher-Student Setting
Authors: Robin Thériault, Francesco Tosello, Daniele Tantari
Abstract: Restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM) are generative models capable to learn data with a rich underlying structure. We study the teacher-student setting where a student RBM learns structured data generated by a teacher RBM. The amount of structure in the data is controlled by adjusting the number of hidden units of the teacher and the correlations in the rows of the weights, a.k.a. patterns. In the absence of correlations, we validate the conjecture that the performance is independent of the number of teacher patters and hidden units of the student RBMs, and we argue that the teacher-student setting can be used as a toy model for studying the lottery ticket hypothesis. Beyond this regime, we find that the critical amount of data required to learn the teacher patterns decreases with both their number and correlations. In both regimes, we find that, even with a relatively large dataset, it becomes impossible to learn the teacher patterns if the inference temperature used for regularization is kept too low. In our framework, the student can learn teacher patterns one-to-one or many-to-one, generalizing previous findings about the teacher-student setting with two hidden units to any arbitrary finite number of hidden units.

Title: Nonlinear semiclassical spectroscopy of ultrafast molecular polariton dynamics
Authors: Michael Reitz, Arghadip Koner, Joel Yuen-Zhou
Abstract: We introduce a theoretical framework that allows for the systematic and efficient description of the ultrafast nonlinear response of molecular polaritons, i.e., hybrid light-matter states, in the collective regime of large numbers of molecules $\mathcal N$ coupled to the cavity photon mode. Our approach is based on a semiclassical, mean-field evolution of the molecular Hamiltonian and the cavity field, which is complemented by a perturbative expansion of both light and matter counterparts in the input fields entering the cavity. In addition, expansion in terms of the pulse phases enables us to disentangle different excitation pathways in Liouville space, thereby distinguishing contributions to the nonlinear response. The formalism extends traditional free-space nonlinear spectroscopy by incorporating the feedback of matter onto the light field via the induced polarization. We demonstrate the utility of the framework by applying it to the calculation of pump-probe polariton spectra and show how, by storing the pulses, the cavity facilitates additional excitation pathways, which can be used to isolate purely bright state contributions. Our method, which does not scale with $\mathcal N$, is broadly applicable and can be extended to model a wide range of current experiments investigating the dynamical nonlinear response of hybrid light-matter states.

Title: Measurement-induced entanglement and complexity in random constant-depth 2D quantum circuits
Authors: Max McGinley, Wen Wei Ho, Daniel Malz
Abstract: We analyse the entanglement structure of states generated by random constant-depth two-dimensional quantum circuits, followed by projective measurements of a subset of sites. By deriving a rigorous lower bound on the average entanglement entropy of such post-measurement states, we prove that macroscopic long-ranged entanglement is generated above some constant critical depth in several natural classes of circuit architectures, which include brickwork circuits and random holographic tensor networks. This behaviour had been conjectured based on previous works, which utilize non-rigorous methods such as replica theory calculations, or work in regimes where the local Hilbert space dimension grows with system size. To establish our lower bound, we develop new replica-free theoretical techniques that leverage tools from multi-user quantum information theory, which are of independent interest, allowing us to map the problem onto a statistical mechanics model of self-avoiding walks without requiring large local Hilbert space dimension. Our findings have consequences for the complexity of classically simulating sampling from random shallow circuits, and of contracting tensor networks: First, we show that standard algorithms based on matrix product states which are used for both these tasks will fail above some constant depth and bond dimension, respectively. In addition, we also prove that these random constant-depth quantum circuits cannot be simulated by any classical circuit of sublogarithmic depth.

Title: Quantum thermal machine regimes in the transverse-field Ising model
Authors: Vishnu Muraleedharan Sajitha, Bodhaditya Santra, Matthew J. Davis, L. A. Williamson
Abstract: We identify and interpret the possible quantum thermal machine regimes with a transverse-field Ising model as the working substance. In general, understanding the emergence of such regimes in a many-body quantum system is challenging due to the dependence on the many energy levels in the system. By considering infinitesimal work strokes, we can understand the operation from equilibrium properties of the system. We find that infinitesimal work strokes enable both heat engine and accelerator operation, with the output and boundaries of operation described by macroscopic properties of the system, in particular the net transverse magnetization. At low temperatures, the regimes of operation and performance can be understood from quasiparticles in the system, while at high temperatures an expansion of the free energy in powers of inverse temperature describes the operation. The understanding generalises to larger work strokes when the temperature difference between the hot and cold reservoirs is large. For hot and cold reservoirs close in temperature, a sufficiently large work stroke can enable refrigerator and heater regimes. Our results and method of analysis will prove useful in understanding the possible regimes of operation of quantum many-body thermal machines more generally.

Title: Picocavity-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy of Physisorbed H$_2$ and D$_2$ Molecules
Authors: Akitoshi Shiotari, Shuyi Liu, George Trenins, Toshiki Sugimoto, Martin Wolf, Mariana Rossi, Takashi Kumagai
Abstract: We report on tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy of H2 and D2 molecules physisorbed within a plasmonic picocavity at 10 K. The intense Raman peaks resulting from the rotational and vibrational transitions are observed at subnanometer gap distances of the junction formed by an Ag tip and an Ag(111) surface, where a picocavity-enhanced field plays a crucial role. A significant redshift of the H-H stretch frequency is observed as the gap distance decreases, while the D-D stretch frequency is unaffected. Density functional theory, path-integral molecular dynamics, and quantum anharmonic vibrational energy calculations suggest that this unexpected isotope effect is explained by a different molecular density between H2 and D2 on the surface.

Title: On symmetry-resolved generalized entropies
Authors: Fei Yan, Sara Murciano, Pasquale Calabrese, Robert Konik
Abstract: Symmetry-resolved entanglement, capturing the refined structure of quantum entanglement in systems with global symmetries, has attracted a lot of attention recently. In this manuscript, introducing the notion of symmetry-resolved generalized entropies, we aim to develop a computational framework suitable for the study of excited state symmetry-resolved entanglement as well as the dynamical evolution of symmetry-resolved entanglement in symmetry-preserving out-of-equilibrium settings. We illustrate our framework using the example of (1+1)-d free massless compact boson theory, and benchmark our results using lattice computation in the XX chain. As a byproduct, our computational framework also provides access to the probability distribution of the symmetry charge contained within a subsystem and the corresponding full counting statistics.

Title: Lattice random walks and quantum A-period conjecture
Authors: Li Gan
Abstract: We derive explicit closed-form expressions for the generating function $C_N(A)$, which enumerates classical closed random walks on square and triangular lattices with $N$ steps and a signed area $A$, characterized by the number of moves in each hopping direction. This enumeration problem is mapped to the trace of powers of anisotropic Hofstadter-like Hamiltonian and is connected to the cluster coefficients of exclusion particles: exclusion strength parameter $g = 2$ for square lattice walks, and a mixture of $g = 1$ and $g = 2$ for triangular lattice walks. By leveraging the intrinsic link between the Hofstadter model and high energy physics, we propose a conjecture connecting the above signed area enumeration $C_N(A)$ in statistical mechanics to the quantum A-period of associated toric Calabi-Yau threefold in topological string theory: square lattice walks correspond to local $\mathbb{F}_0$ geometry, while triangular lattice walks are associated with local $\mathcal{B}_3$.

Title: Spacing ratios in mixed-type systems
Authors: Hua Yan
Abstract: The distribution of the consecutive level-spacing ratio is now widely used as a tool to distinguish integrable from chaotic quantum spectra, mostly due to its avoiding of the numerical spectral unfolding. Similar to the use of the Rosenzweig-Porter approach to obtain the Berry-Robnik distribution of level-spacings in mixed-type systems, in this work we extend this approach to derive analytically the distribution of spacing ratios, for random matrices comprised of independent integrable blocks and chaotic blocks. We have numerically confirmed this analytical result using random matrix theory in paradigmatic models such as the quantum kicked rotor and the Hénon-Heiles system.

Title: Analysis of a voter model with an evolving number of opinion states
Authors: Jeehye Choi, Byungjoon Min, Tobias Galla
Abstract: In traditional voter models, opinion dynamics are driven by interactions between individuals, where an individual adopts the opinion of a randomly chosen neighbor. However, these models often fail to capture the emergence of entirely new opinions, which can arise spontaneously in real-world scenarios. Our study introduces a novel element to the classic voter model: the concept of innovation, where individuals have a certain probability of generating new opinions independently of their neighbors' states. This innovation process allows for a more realistic representation of social dynamics, where new opinions can emerge and old ones may fade over time. Through analytical and numerical analysis, we find that the balance between innovation and extinction shapes the number of opinions in the steady state. Specifically, for low innovation rates, the system tends toward near-consensus, while higher innovation rates lead to greater opinion diversity. We also show that network structure influences opinion dynamics, with greater degree heterogeneity reducing the number of opinions in the system.

Title: Quantum Phase diagrams and transitions for Chern topological insulators
Authors: Ralph M. Kaufmann, Mohamad Mousa, Birgit Wehefritz-Kaufmann
Abstract: Topological invariants such as Chern classes are by now a standard way to classify topological phases. Introducing and varying parameters in such systems leads to phase diagrams, where the Chern classes may jump when crossing a critical locus. These systems appear naturally when considering slicing of higher dimensional systems or when considering systems with parameters. As the Chern classes are topological invariants, they can only change if the "topology breaks down". We give a precise mathematical formulation of this phenomenon and show that synthetically any phase diagram of Chern topological phases can be designed and realized by a physical system, using covering, aka. winding maps. Here we provide explicit families realizing arbitrary Chern jumps. The critical locus of these maps is described by the classical rose curves. These realize the lower bound on the number of Dirac points necessary obtained from viewing them as local charges. We treat several concrete models and show that they have the predicted generic behavior. In particular, we focus on different types of lattices and tight-binding models, and show that effective winding maps, and thus higher Chern numbers, can be achieved using k-th nearest neighbors. We give explicit formulas for a family of 2D lattices using imaginary quadratic field extensions and their norms. Our study includes the square, triangular, honeycomb and Kagome lattices.

Title: $N$-ality symmetry and SPT phases in (1+1)d
Authors: Jun Maeda, Tsubasa Oishi
Abstract: Duality symmetries have been extensively investigated in various contexts, playing a crucial role in understanding quantum field theory and condensed matter theory. In this paper, we extend this framework by studying $N$-ality symmetries, which are a generalization of duality symmetries and are mathematically described by $\mathbb{Z}_N$-graded fusion categories. In particular, we focus on an $N$-ality symmetry obtained by gauging a non-anomalous subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}_N\times\mathbb{Z}_N\times\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry with a type III anomaly. We determine the corresponding fusion rules via two complementary approaches: a direct calculation and a representation-theoretic method. As an application, we study the symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases associated with the $N$-ality symmetry. We classify all such SPT phases using the SymTFT framework and explicitly construct lattice Hamiltonians for some of them.
