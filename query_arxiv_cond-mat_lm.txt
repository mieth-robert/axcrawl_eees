Title: Comment on arXiv:2501.17230 and arXiv:2502.00103 "Phonon-mediated electron attraction in SrTiO3 via the generalized Frohlich and deformation potential mechanisms" and "Theory of ab initio downfolding with arbitrary range electron-phonon coupling"
Authors: Jonathan Ruhman
Abstract: This comment critically examines the claims made in arXiv papers arXiv:2501.17230 and arXiv:2502.00103, which argue that a multiplicity of polar optical phonons can generate a long-range attractive interaction via a generalized Frohlich coupling. I identify a fundamental flaw in their derivation, showing that their result relies on an unphysical assumption--specifically, neglecting the intermode Coulomb interactions between different polar optical phonons. By restoring these missing interactions I show the screened Coulomb interaction is always repulsive in the static limit.

Title: Understanding Floquet Resonances in Ultracold Gas Scattering
Authors: Christoph Dauer, Axel Pelster, Sebastian Eggert
Abstract: Scattering by a short-range potential with time-periodic interaction strength is investigated with a Floquet-scattering theory. Sharp resonances occur, at which the s-wave scattering length can be tuned to large positive and negative values. We show that the shape of these resonances is described by a simple formula, and find that both resonance position and prefactor can be altered by the driving strength. Our approach allows to identify the physical origin of the scattering resonances as Floquet bound states with positive energies, which are dynamically created by the drive. This insight is valuable for a detailed analysis and uncovers a general resource for enhanced or reduced scattering in Floquet systems.

Title: Anomalies of Coset Non-Invertible Symmetries
Authors: Po-Shen Hsin, Ryohei Kobayashi, Carolyn Zhang
Abstract: Anomalies of global symmetries provide important information on the quantum dynamics. We show the dynamical constraints can be organized into three classes: genuine anomalies, fractional topological responses, and integer responses that can be realized in symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. Coset symmetry can be present in many physical systems including quantum spin liquids, and the coset symmetry can be a non-invertible symmetry. We introduce twists in coset symmetries, which modify the fusion rules and the generalized Frobenius-Schur indicators. We call such coset symmetries twisted coset symmetries, and they are labeled by the quadruple $(G,K,\omega_{D+1},\alpha_D)$ in $D$ spacetime dimensions where $G$ is a group and $K\subset G$ is a discrete subgroup, $\omega_{D+1}$ is a $(D+1)$-cocycle for group $G$, and $\alpha_{D}$ is a $D$-cochain for group $K$. We present several examples with twisted coset symmetries using lattice models and field theory, including both gapped and gapless systems (such as gapless symmetry-protected topological phases). We investigate the anomalies of general twisted coset symmetry, which presents obstructions to realizing the coset symmetry in (gapped) symmetry-protected topological phases. We show that finite coset symmetry $G/K$ becomes anomalous when $G$ cannot be expressed as the bicrossed product $G=H\Join K$, and such anomalous coset symmetry leads to symmetry-enforced gaplessness in generic spacetime dimensions. We illustrate examples of anomalous coset symmetries with $A_5/\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, with realizations in lattice models.

Title: Reconstructive martensitic phase transitions: intermittency, anti-trasformation, plasticity, irreversibility
Authors: Edoardo Arbib, Noemi Barrera, Paolo Biscari, Giovanni Zanzotto
Abstract: We study the mechanics of temperature-driven reconstructive martensitic transformations in crystalline materials, within the framework of nonlinear elasticity theory. We focus on the prototypical case of the square-hexagonal transition in 2D crystals, using a modular Ericksen-Landau-type strain energy whose infinite and discrete invariance group originates from the full symmetry of the underlying lattice. In the simulation of quasi-static thermally-driven transitions we confirm the role of the valley-floor network in establishing the strain-field transition-pathways on the symmetry-moulded strain energy landscape of the crystal. We also observe the phase change to progress through abrupt microstructure reorganization via strain avalanching under the slow driving. We reveal at the same time the presence of assisting anti-transformation activity, which locally goes against the overall transition course. Both transformation and anti-transformation avalanches exhibit Gutenberg-Richter like heavy-tailed size statistics. A parallel analysis shows agreement of these numerical results with their counterparts in empirical observations on temperature-induced martensitic transformations. The simulation furthermore shows that, in the present case of a reconstructive transformation, strain avalanching mostly involves lattice-invariant shears (LIS). As a consequence, microstructure evolution is accompanied by slip-induced defect nucleation and movement in the lattice. LIS activity also leads to the development of polycrystal grain-like lattice-homogeneity domains exhibiting high boundary segmentation in the body. All these effects ultimately lead to transformation irreversibility.

Title: Exploring Three-Atom-Thick Gold Structures as a Benchmark for Atomic-Scale Calibration of Break-Junction Systems
Authors: J.P. Cuenca, T. de Ara, A. Martinez-Garcia, E. Guzman, C. Sabater
Abstract: We present an in-depth study of electronic transport in atomic-sized gold contacts using Break-Junction (BJ) techniques under cryogenic and ambient conditions. Our experimental results, supported by classical molecular dynamics (CMD) simulations and ab initio calculations, provide compelling evidence for the formation of three-atom-thick structures in gold nanocontacts under tensile stress. These findings extend previous studies that confirmed the existence of one- and two-atom-thick chains. Beyond identifying these novel atomic configurations, we introduce a fast and robust calibration method for Break-Junction systems, leveraging the characteristic length of these structures to convert piezo displacement into absolute distance in angstroms. Our approach presents a novel and robust method for calibrating atomic distances in atomic conductor systems at both cryogenic and room temperatures. The results also enable the assessment of electrode sharpness, even at room conditions.

Title: Particle Trajectory Prediction in Discrete Element Simulations using a Graph-Based Interaction-Aware Model
Authors: Abhishek Setty, Lukas Morand, Poojitha Ramachandra, Claas Bierwisch
Abstract: This study explores the applicability of a graph-based interaction-aware trajectory prediction model, originally developed for the transportation domain, to forecast particle trajectories in three-dimensional discrete element simulations. The model and our enhancements are validated at two typical particle simulation use cases: (i) particle flow in a representative unit cell with periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) in combination with sinusoidal velocity profile and (ii) shear flow in a representative unit cell with Lees\texttt{-}Edwards boundary conditions (LEBCs). For the models to learn the particle behavior subjected to these boundary conditions requires additional data transformation and feature engineering, which we introduce. Furthermore, we introduce and compare two novel training procedures for the adapted prediction model, which we call position\texttt{-}centric training (PCT) and velocity\texttt{-}centric training (VCT). The results show that the models developed for the transportation domain can be adapted to learn the behavior of particles in discrete element simulations.

Title: Robust and tunable oxide nanoscrolls for solar-driven H$_2$ generation and storage
Authors: Adway Gupta, Arunima Singh
Abstract: Hydrogen gas is a promising alternative to fossil fuels due to its high energy output and environmentally safe byproducts. Various morphologies of photocatalytic materials have been explored for high-efficiency H$_2$ production, for instance, quasi-1D nanoscroll structures that provide larger surface-to-volume ratio. Recently, we predicted layer-by-layer formation of stable oxide nanoscrolls directly from dichalcogenide precursors, eliminating the need for costly formation of two-dimensional oxides for a roll-up synthesis of nanoscrolls. In this study, we evaluate the suitability of those oxide nanoscroll materials MoO$_3$, WO$_3$, PdO$_2$, HfO$_2$, and GeO$_2$ for solar-driven photocatalytic H$_2$ production and storage. Using excited state theory simulations we discern their electronic properties as a function of interlayer scroll spacing and find them to possess electronic properties that are suitable for photocatalysis. Additionally, using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations we show that they are also suitable for H$_2$ storage as the nanoscrolls exhibit effective trapping of hydrogen, even in the presence of defects and vacancies in the oxides. This work thus demonstrates the discovery of robust and tunable oxide nanoscrolls as novel materials for advancing solar-driven hydrogen technologies.

Title: A Study of Superconducting Behavior in Ruthenium Thin Films
Authors: Bernardo Langa Jr., Brooke Henry, Ivan Lainez, Richard Haight, Kasra Sardashti
Abstract: Ruthenium (Ru) is a promising candidate for the next-generation of electronic interconnects due to its low resistivity, small mean free path, and superior electromigration reliability at nanometer scales. Additionally, Ru exhibits superconductivity below 1 K, with resistance to oxidation, low diffusivity, and a small superconducting gap, making it a potential material for superconducting qubits and Josephson Junctions. Here, we investigate the superconducting behavior of Ru thin films (11.9 - 108.5 nm thick), observing transition temperatures from 657.9 mK to 557 mK. A weak thickness dependence appears in the thinnest films, followed by a conventional inverse thickness dependence in thicker films. Magnetotransport studies reveal type-II superconductivity in the dirty limit ({\xi} >> l), with coherence lengths ranging from 13.5 nm to 27 nm. Finally, oxidation resistance studies confirm minimal RuOx growth after seven weeks of air exposure. These findings provide key insights for integrating Ru into superconducting electronic devices.

Title: Accuracy and capacity of Modern Hopfield networks with synaptic noise
Authors: Sharba Bhattacharjee, Ivar Martin
Abstract: We study the retrieval accuracy and capacity of modern Hopfield networks of with two-state (Ising) spins interacting via modified Hebbian $n$-spin interactions. In particular, we consider systems where the interactions deviate from the Hebb rule through additive or multiplicative noise or through clipping or deleting interactions. We find that the capacity scales as $N^{n-1}$ with the number of spins $N$ in all cases, but with a prefactor reduced compared to the Hebbian case. For $n=2$ our results agree with the previously known results for the conventional $n = 2$ Hopfield network.

Title: Current-driven collective control of helical spin texture in van der Waals antiferromagnet
Authors: Kai-Xuan Zhang, Suik Cheon, Hyuncheol Kim, Pyeongjae Park, Yeochan An, Suhan Son, Jingyuan Cui, Jihoon Keum, Joonyoung Choi, Younjung Jo, Hwiin Ju, Jong-Seok Lee, Youjin Lee, Maxim Avdeev, Armin Kleibert, Hyun-Woo Lee, Je-Geun Park
Abstract: Electrical control of quantum magnetic states is essential in spintronic science. Initial studies on the ferromagnetic state control were extended to collinear antiferromagnets and, more recently, noncollinear antiferromagnets. However, electrical control mechanisms of such exotic magnetic states remain poorly understood. Here, we report the first experimental and theoretical example of the current control of helical antiferromagnets, arising from the competition between collinear antiferromagnetic exchange and interlayer Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in new van-der-Waals (vdW) material Ni1/3NbS2. Due to the intrinsic broken inversion symmetry, an in-plane current generates spin-orbit torque that, in turn, interacts directly with the helical antiferromagnetic order. Our theoretical analyses indicate that a weak ferromagnetic order coexists due to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, mediating the spin-orbit torque to collectively rotate the helical antiferromagnetic order. Our Ni1/3NbS2 nanodevice experiments produce current-dependent resistance change consistent with the theoretical prediction. This work widens our understanding of the electrical control of helical antiferromagnets and promotes vdW quantum magnets as interesting material platforms for electrical control.

Title: Pressure Tuning of Layer-hybridized Excitons in Trilayer WSe2
Authors: Xuan Zhao, Jing Song, Wenqi Xiong, Qianying Hu, Yuxuan Song, Xin He, Tianzhong Yang, Song Liu, Shengjun Yuan, Hongyi Yu, Yang Xu
Abstract: We demonstrate dynamic pressure tuning (0-6.6 GPa) of layer-hybridized excitons in AB-stacked trilayer WSe$_2$ via diamond-anvil-cell-integrated reflectance spectroscopy. Pressure-controlled interlayer coupling manifests in enhanced energy-level anti-crossings and oscillator strength redistribution, with Stark shift analysis revealing a characteristic dipole moment reduction of 11%. Notably, the hybridization strength between the intra- and interlayer excitons triples from $\sim$10 meV to above $\sim$30 meV, exhibiting a near-linear scaling of 3.5$\pm$0.2 meV/GPa. Spectral density simulations resolve four distinct components, i.e., intralayer ground/excited and interlayer ground/excited excitons, with their relative weights transitioning from one component dominant to strongly hybridized at higher pressures. Our findings highlight the potential for controlling excitonic properties and engineering novel optoelectronic devices through interlayer compression.

Title: Exploring 2D/Quasi-2D Ruddlesden-Popper Perovskite A$_{n+1}$Hf$_n$S$_{3n+1}$ (A = Ca, Sr, and Ba; n = 1-3) for Optoelectronics using Many-Body Perturbation Theory
Authors: Surajit Adhikari, Aksaj Bharatwaj, Priya Johari
Abstract: Dimensionality engineering in A$_{n+1}$B$_n$X$_{3n+1}$ Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) perovskite phases has emerged as a promising strategy to enhance optoelectronic properties. These properties are highly material-dependent, requiring detailed exploration of electronic, optical, excitonic, transport, and polaronic characteristics. However, the absence of comprehensive studies continues to impede the rational design of high-performance materials. In this work, we investigate the excitonic and polaronic effects in A$_{n+1}$Hf$_n$S$_{3n+1}$ (A = Ca, Sr, and Ba; n = 1-3) RP phases, examining their relative stability and optoelectronic properties using several first-principles based methodologies within the framework of density functional theory and many-body perturbation theory (GW and BSE). Our study suggests that these compounds are mechanically stable and feature G$_0$W$_0$@PBE bandgaps ranging from 1.43 to 2.14 eV, which are smaller than those of their bulk counterparts. BSE and model-BSE (mBSE) calculations indicate that these RP phases display notable optical anisotropy, with the exciton binding energy decreasing as the thickness of the perovskite layer increases. In addition, intermediate to strong carrier-phonon scattering is observed in these compounds, confirmed through the Fröhlich mechanism near room temperature. Using the Feynman polaron model, the polaron parameters of these RP phases are also computed, and it is found that charge-separated polaronic states are less stable than bound excitons. Finally, a significant increase in electron mobilities is observed in RP phases compared to their bulk counterparts. Overall, the insights gained from this study will enable the rational design of layered perovskite phases for applications in solar cells and other optoelectronic devices.

Title: Role of seed layer in growing atomically flat TiTe2/Sb2Te3 heterostructure thin films at the wafer scale
Authors: Chao Nie, Xueyang Shen, Junying Zhang, Chenyu Wen, Yuxin Du, Yazhi Xu, Riccardo Mazzarello, En Ma, Xiaozhe Wang, Wei Zhang, Jiang-Jing Wang
Abstract: Chalcogenide phase-change materials (PCMs) are a leading candidate for advanced memory and computing applications. Epitaxial-like growth of chalcogenide thin films at the wafer scale is important to guarantee the homogeneity of the thin film but is challenging with magnetron sputtering, particularly for the growth of phase-change heterostructure (PCH), such as TiTe2/Sb2Te3. In this work, we report how to obtain highly textured TiTe2/Sb2Te3 heterostructure thin films with atomically sharp interfaces on standard silicon substrates. By combining atomic-scale characterization and ab initio simulations, we reveal the critical role of the Sb2Te3 seed layer in forming a continuous Si-Sb-Te mixed transition layer, which provides a wafer-scale flat surface for the subsequent epitaxial-like growth of TiTe2/Sb2Te3 thin film. By gradually reducing the thickness of the seed layer, we determine its critical limit to be ~2 nm. Non-negligible in-plane tensile strain was observed in the TiTe2 slabs due to the lattice mismatch with the adjacent Sb2Te3 ones, suggesting that the chemical interaction across the structural gaps in the heterostructure is stronger than a pure van der Waals interaction. Finally, we outline the potential choices of chalcogenides for atomically flat seed layers on standard silicon substrates, which can be used for wafer-scale synthesis of other high-quality PCM or PCH thin films.

Title: Cryogen-free low-temperature photoemission electron microscopy for high-resolution nondestructive imaging of electronic phases
Authors: Chen Wang, Shaoshan Wang, Chuan Guo, Chengjian Yu, Qi Fu, Xiaopeng Xie, Changxi Zheng
Abstract: Quantum materials exhibit phases such as superconductivity at low temperatures, yet imaging their phase transition dynamics with high spatial resolution remains challenging due to conventional tools' limitations - scanning tunneling microscopy offers static snapshots, while transmission electron microscopy lacks band sensitivity. Photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) can resolve band structures in real/reciprocal spaces rapidly, but suffering from insufficient resolution for (near)atomic-scale quantum physics due to the unstable cooling designs. Here, we developed cryogen-free low-temperature PEEM (CFLT-PEEM) achieving 21.1 K stably. CFLT-PEEM attains a record-breaking resolution of 4.48 nm without aberration correction, enabling direct visualization of surface-state distribution characteristics along individual atomic steps. The advancement lies in narrowing the segment of band structures for imaging down to 160 meV, which minimizes the chromatic aberration of PEEM. CFLT-PEEM enables rapid, nondestructive high-resolution imaging of cryogenic electronic structures, positioning it as a powerful tool for physics and beyond.

Title: Zeeman split Kramers doublets in spin-supersolid candidate Na$_{2}$BaCo(PO$_{4}$)$_{2}$
Authors: T. I. Popescu, N. Gora, F. Demmel, Z. Xu, R. Zhong, T. J. Williams, R. J. Cava, G. Xu, C. Stock
Abstract: Na$_{2}$BaCo(PO$_{4}$)$_{2}$ is a triangular antiferromagnet that displays highly efficient adiabatic demagnetization cooling (J. Xiang $\textit{et al.}$ Nature ${\bf{625}}$, 270 (2024)) near a quantum critical point at $\mu_{0}H_{c}\sim 1.6$ T, separating a low-field magnetically disordered from a high-field fully polarized ferromagnetic phase. We apply high resolution backscattering neutron spectroscopy in an applied field to study the magnetic excitations near $\mu_{0}H_{c}$. At large fields we observe ferromagnetic fluctuations that gradually transition to being overdamped in energy below $\mu_{0}H_{c}$ where the magnetism is spatially disordered. We parameterize the excitations in the high field polarized phase in terms of coupled Zeeman split Kramers doublets originating from the presence of spin-orbit coupling. On reducing the field, the splitting between the Kramers doublets is reduced and if done adiabatically, provides a mechanism for reducing temperature. On lowering the applied field through the $\mu_{0}H_{c}$ the excitations characterize a textured phase that we suggest is inefficient for cooling. Low temperature disordered frustrated magnets built on Kramers doublets with nearby quantum critical points provide a route for efficient magnetocalorics.

Title: Theoretical Exploration of Phase Transitions in a Cavity-BEC System with Two Crossed Optical Pumps
Authors: Wei Qin, Dong-Chen Zheng, Zhao-Di Wu, Yuan-Hong Chen, Renyuan Liao
Abstract: We consider a Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) inside an optical cavity and two crossed coherent pump fields. We determine the phase boundary separating the normal superfluid phase and the superradiance phase, perturbatively. In the regime of negative cavity detuning, we map out the phase diagrams both for an attractive and a repulsive optical lattice. It turns out that the situation is quite different in two cases. Specifically, in the case of attractive lattice, if a system is in the superradiant phase with one pump laser, adding another pump does not drive the system out of the superradiance phase. While for the repulsive lattice, increasing another pump potential have suppressive effects on the superradiance. We also find that, in the case of attractive lattice, equally increasing two pump lattice potentials can induce a transition from the normal phase to the superradiance phase. In stark contrast, for the repulsive lattice, the system will remain in the normal phase as the pump depths are tuned within a wide range, independent of the cavity detuning and the decay rate.

Title: Mediated Interactions and Damping Effects in Superfluid Mixtures of Bose and Fermi Gases
Authors: Dong-Chen Zheng, Yu-Xin Liao, Wen Lin, Renyuan Liao
Abstract: We investigate the homogeneous superfluid mixtures of Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer~(BCS) superfluid originating from pairing two-species fermionic atoms and superfluidity stemming from condensation of bosonic atoms. By integrating out the freedoms associated with the BCS superfluid, we derive the fermion-mediated interactions between bosons, which is attractive and can be tuned from long range in the BCS region to short range in the region of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of molecular dimers. By analyzing the Bogoliubov spectrum and the damping rate of bosonic superfluid, we map out the phase diagram spanned by the boson-fermion mass ratio and the boson-fermion coupling strength, which consists of a phase separation region and two phase mixing regions with and without Landau damping. The three different phases can coexist at a tricritical point, which moves toward low boson-fermion mass ratio and high boson-fermion scattering length as the fermion-fermion interaction strength is tuned up on the BCS side.

Title: Condensation energy of superconducting BEC of non-interacting Cooper pairs in multilayers
Authors: I. Chávez, P. Salas, J.J. Valencia, M.A. Solís
Abstract: Boson-Fermion models of superconductivity are getting attention as they are able to explain some of the high temperature superconductor's properties. Here we report on the condensation energy of a 3D non-interacting mixture of paired fermions (electrons) as Cooper pairs assumed to be composite bosons, which are responsible for carrying superconductivity, plus unpaired fermions both trapped in a periodic multilayer structure like that of the cuasi-two dimensional High-Temperature superconductor planes, generated by applying an external Dirac's comb potential in the direction perpendicular to the planes where superconductivity preferably occurs, while in the other two directions parallel to the planes the mixture moves freely. For bosons we give the Bose-Einstein condensation critical temperature, which we assume is equal to the superconducting critical one, while for both bosons and fermions we give the chemical potential, the internal energy and the entropy, all of them as functions of temperature, in order to calculate the Helmholtz free energy, which we use to obtain the condensation energy of a mixture of $N_F$ ideal fermions (electrons), which after turning on the attractive pair interaction become $N_B = N_{F}/2$ ideal bosons. For several plane impenetrability magnitudes, we calculate the condensation energy as the difference between the free energies of the fermions which are in the normal state minus that of the bosons in the condensed state, where we observe that as the plane impenetrability increases: the condensation energy increases; the critical temperature decreases, as expected for example for cuprate superconductors, and the behavior of the entropy and the internal energy show a dimensional crossover from 3D to 2D.

Title: Air-stable lithiation engineering of $\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$ for direct-bandgap multilayers
Authors: Qi Fu, Yichi Zhang, Jichuang Shen, Siyuan Hong, Jie Wang, Chen Wang, Jingyi Shen, Wei Kong, Guolin Zheng, Jun Yan, Jie Wu, Changxi Zheng
Abstract: Due to its sizable direct bandgap and strong light-matter interactions, the preparation of monolayer $\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$ has attracted significant attention and intensive research efforts. However, multilayer $\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$ is largely overlooked because of its optically inactive indirect bandgap caused by interlayer coupling. It is highly desirable to modulate and decrease the interlayer coupling so that each layer in multilayer $\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$ can exhibit a monolayer-like direct-gap behavior. Here, we demonstrate the nanoprobe fabrication of $\mathrm{Li}_{x}\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$-based multilayers exhibiting a direct bandgap and strong photoluminescence emission from tightly bound excitons and trions. The fabrication is facilitated by our newly developed Li-ion platform, featuring tip-induced Li intercalation, air stability and rewritability. Raman characterizations reveal that controlled Li intercalation effectively transforms multilayer $\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$ into the stack of multiple monolayers, leading to a 26-fold enhancement of photoluminescence, compared to a monolayer. This intercalation result is different from existing observations of transforming $\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$ multilayers into metallic phases.

Title: Field-driven band asymmetry and non-reciprocal transport in a helimagnet
Authors: Darius-Alexandru Deaconu, Aneesh Agarwal, Rodion Vladimirovich Belosludov, Robert-Jan Slager, Mohammad Saeed Bahramy
Abstract: Helimagnets exhibit noncollinear spin arrangements characterized by a periodic helical modulation, giving rise to emergent chiral properties. These materials have attracted significant interest due to their potential applications in spintronics, particularly for robust information storage and the realization of topological spin textures such as skyrmions. In this work, we focus on Yoshimori-type helimagnets, where competing exchange interactions mediated by conduction electrons stabilize helical spin structures without requiring Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. We introduce a minimal model describing the electronic structure of a one-dimensional helimagnet in the presence of an external magnetic field and investigate its impact on non-reciprocal transport. We demonstrate how band asymmetry emerges in the conical phase induced by the external field, leading to a nonzero second-order electronic conductivity and injection photoconductivity. Our results provide insight into the interplay between the real space magnetic texture and electronic properties, paving the way for future studies on chirality-driven transport phenomena in centrosymmetric helimagnets.

Title: Magnetic order and spin dynamics across the ferromagnetic quantum critical point in Ni\boldmath{$_{1-x}$}Mo\boldmath{$_{x}$}
Authors: H. K. Dara, S. S. Islam, A. Magar, D. Patra, H. Luetkens, T. Shiroka, R. Nath, D. Samal
Abstract: Realizing a quantum critical point (QCP) in clean ferromagnetic (FM) metals has remained elusive due to the coupling of magnetization to the electronic soft modes that drive the transition to be of first order. However, by introducing a suitable amount of quenched disorder, one can still establish a QCP in ferromagnets. In this study, we ascertain that the itinerant ferromagnet Ni$_{1-x}$Mo$_{x}$ exhibits a FM QCP at a critical doping of $x_c \simeq 0.125$. Through magnetization and muon-spin relaxation measurements, we demonstrate that the FM ordering temperature is suppressed continuously to zero at $x_c$, while the magnetic volume fraction remains $100\%$ up to $x_c$, indicating a second-order phase transition. The QCP is accompanied by a non-Fermi liquid behavior, as evidenced by the logarithmic divergence of the specific heat and the linear temperature dependence of the low-temperature resistivity. Our findings reveal a minimal effect of disorder on the critical spin dynamics of Ni$_{1-x}$Mo$_{x}$ at $x_c$, highlighting it as one of the rare systems to exhibit a clean FM QCP.

Title: Theoretical and Experimental Investigations of High-Performance Sr2CoNbO6-delta Double Perovskite for IT-SOFC Cathode Applications
Authors: Jyotsana Kalaa, Vicky Dhongde, Suddhasatwa Basu, Brajesh Kumar Mani, M. Ali Haider
Abstract: Enhancing the transport of oxygen anions in the cathode while maintaining surface stability is essential for improving the performance of intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs). This study investigates a novel cathode material candidate, Sr2CoNbO6-delta (SCNO), using density functional theory, molecular dynamics, and experimental characterization. The redox active Co cation at B-site and less reducible Nb cation at the B'-site together enhance both surface stability and electrocatalytic performance. SCNO is observed to have a higher concentration of oxygen vacancies and increased oxygen diffusivity on the surface. The surface stability of SCNO is further improved when simulated under compressive strain due to the GDC electrolyte substrate. These findings offer new insights into controlling Sr segregation in SCNO, contributing to a better understanding of its enhanced oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and high surface stability. Subsequently, SCNO was synthesized to evaluate its potential as a cathode material in SOFCs. To assess its performance, symmetric cells with uniform dense thin films of varying thicknesses (40 and 80 nm) were fabricated using the pulsed laser deposition technique. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and distributed relaxation time analysis indicate that bulk oxygen ion diffusion is a limiting factor for the ORR in SCNO. The polarization resistance for the 40 and 80 nm dense thin film symmetric cells ranged between 0.329 - 0.241 ohm cm2 and 1.095 - 0.438 ohm cm2, respectively, within the temperature range of 773 - 973 K in an air atmosphere. The full cell configuration of NiO-GDC|GDC|SCNO demonstrated a significantly high peak power density of 0.633 W/cm2 at 973 K. This theory-guided design and experimental study suggest that SCNO is a promising candidate for IT-SOFC cathode materials.

Title: The Dynamics in Vibro-fluidized Beds: A Diffusing Wave Spectroscopy Study
Authors: Marlo Kunzner, Christopher Mayo, Matthias Sperl, Jan Philipp Gabriel
Abstract: We demonstrate the densification of a granular model system of polystyrene spheres over time by shaking with varying excitation amplitudes or effective temperatures. This densification is quantified by the mean square displacement (MSD), which is measured by diffuse wave spectroscopy (DWS) of a sinusoidally excited vibrating fluidized granular bed. The DWS method also extracts the inherent heterogeneous dynamics of the system in the bulk and at the wall. Through an empirical model-based extraction we obtain the ballistic and diffusive time constants, as well as caging sizes, which were found to depend on temperature and density. The results obtained from this study reveal a sub-diffusive power-law behavior in the MSD, indicating an arrest of motion and potentially a glassy system, especially in cases where the excitation is low to moderate compared to gravity. The extracted MSD caging sizes are two orders smaller than the Lindeman length found in colloidal systems.

Abstract: Photonic technologies continue to drive the quest for new optical materials with unprecedented responses. A major frontier in this field is the exploration of nonlocal (spatially dispersive) materials, going beyond the local, wavevector-independent assumption traditionally made in optical material modeling. On one end, the growing interest in plasmonic, polaritonic and quantum materials has revealed naturally occurring nonlocalities, emphasizing the need for more accurate models to predict and design their optical responses. This has major implications also for topological, nonreciprocal, and time-varying systems based on these material platforms. Beyond natural materials, artificially structured materials--metamaterials and metasurfaces--can provide even stronger and engineered nonlocal effects, emerging from long-range interactions or multipolar effects. This is a rapidly expanding area in the field of photonic metamaterials, with open frontiers yet to be explored. In the case of metasurfaces, in particular, nonlocality engineering has become a powerful tool for designing strongly wavevector-dependent responses, enabling enhanced wavefront control, spatial compression, multifunctional devices, and wave-based computing. Furthermore, nonlocality and related concepts play a critical role in defining the ultimate limits of what is possible in optics, photonics, and wave physics. This Roadmap aims to survey the most exciting developments in nonlocal photonic materials, highlight new opportunities and open challenges, and chart new pathways that will drive this emerging field forward--toward new scientific discoveries and technological advancements.

Title: Is directed percolation class for synchronization transition robust with multi-site interactions?
Authors: Manoj C. Warambhe, Prashant M. Gade
Abstract: Coupled map lattice with pairwise local interactions is a well-studied system. However, in several situations, such as neuronal or social networks, multi-site interactions are possible. In this work, we study the coupled Gauss map in one dimension with 2-site, 3-site, 4-site and 5-site interaction. This coupling cannot be decomposed in pairwise interactions. We coarse-grain the variable values by labeling the sites above $x^{\star}$ as up spin (+1) and the rest as down spin (-1) where $x^{\star}$ is the fixed point. We define flip rate $F(t)$ as the fraction of sites $i$ such that $s_{i}(t-1) \neq s_{i}(t)$ and persistence $P(t)$ as the fraction of sites $i$ such that $s_{i}(t')=s_{i}(0)$ for all $t' \le t$. The dynamic phase transitions to a synchronized state is studied above quantifiers. For 3 and 5 sites interaction, we find that at the critical point, $F(t) \sim t^{-\delta}$ with $\delta=0.159$ and $P(t) \sim t^{-\theta}$ with $\theta=1.5$. They match the directed percolation (DP) class. Finite-size and off-critical scaling is consistent with DP class. For 2 and 4 site interactions, the exponent $\delta$ and behavior of $P(t)$ at critical point changes. Furthermore, we observe logarithmic oscillations over and above power-law decay at the critical point for 4-site coupling. Thus multi-site interactions can lead to new universality class(es).

Title: Tailoring of charge carriers with deposition temperature in pulsed laser deposited BiFeO3 thin films
Authors: Viswajit R S, Jinesh K.B, Ashok K
Abstract: This research investigates the structural, topological, electrical and optical properties of pulsed laser deposited polycrystalline BiFeO3 thin films on silicon and glass substrate at varying deposition temperatures ranging from 400 degC to 700 degC. X-ray diffraction confirm rhombohedral phase and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals stoichiometric BiFeO3 films. The optical bandgap of thin films obtained from absorption spectra increases with the substrate temperature. Photoluminescence emission spectrum reveals the defects and Atomic Force Microscopy analysis bring out the surface topography and crystallinity improvement with temperature. The charge transport studies reveal a transition in conductivity from n-type at lower deposition temperature to p-type at higher deposition temperature, attributed to oxygen and bismuth vacancies respectively. The intricate understanding of conductivity tuning and the leaky nature of BiFeO3 thin film opens avenues for applications in nonvolatile memories, particularly neuromorphic devices.

Title: Modelling the non-linear viscoelastic behaviour of brain tissue in torsion
Authors: G. Small, F. Ballatore, C. Giverso, V. Balbi
Abstract: Brain tissue accommodates non-linear deformations and exhibits time-dependent mechanical behaviour. The latter is one of the most pronounced features of brain tissue, manifesting itself primarily through viscoelastic effects such as stress relaxation. To investigate its viscoelastic behaviour, we performed ramp-and-hold relaxation tests in torsion on freshly slaughtered cylindrical ovine brain samples ($25\,\,\text{mm}$ diameter and $\sim 10\,\,\text{mm}$ height). The tests were conducted using a commercial rheometer at varying twist rates of $\{40,240,400\}\,\,\text{rad}\,\,\text{m}^{-1}\,\,\text{s}^{-1}$, with the twist remaining fixed at $\sim 88\,\,\text{rad}\,\,\text{m}^{-1}$, which generated two independent datasets for torque and normal force. The complete set of viscoelastic material parameters was estimated via a simultaneous fit to the analytical expressions for the torque and normal force predicted by the modified quasi-linear viscoelastic model. The model's predictions were further validated through finite element simulations in FEniCS. Our results show that the modified quasi-linear viscoelastic model -- recently reappraised and largely unexploited -- accurately fits the experimental data. Moreover, the estimated material parameters are in line with those obtained in previous studies on brain samples under torsion. When coupled with bespoke finite element models, these material parameters could enhance our understanding of the forces and deformations involved in traumatic brain injury and contribute to the design of improved headgear for sports such as boxing and motorsports. On the other hand, our novel testing protocol offers new insights into the mechanical behaviour of soft tissues other than the brain.

Title: Correlated hopping induced topological order in an atomic mixture
Authors: Ashirbad Padhan, Luca Barbiero, Tapan Mishra
Abstract: The large majority of topological phases in one dimensional many-body systems are known to inherit from the corresponding single-particle Hamiltonian. In this work, we go beyond this assumption and find a new example of topological order induced through specific interactions couplings. Specifically, we consider a fermionic mixture where one component experiences a staggered onsite potential and it is coupled through density dependent hopping interactions to the other fermionic component. Crucially, by varying the sign of the staggered potential, we show that this latter fermionic component can acquire topological properties. Thanks to matrix product state simulations, we prove this result both at the equilibrium by extracting the behavior of correlation functions and in an out-of-equilibrium scheme by employing a Thouless charge pumping. Notably, we further discuss how our results can be probed in quantum simulators made up of ultracold atoms. Our results reveal an important and alternative mechanism that can give rise to topological order.

Title: Statistical Mechanics of Semantic Compression
Authors: Tankut Can
Abstract: The basic problem of semantic compression is to minimize the length of a message while preserving its meaning. This differs from classical notions of compression in that the distortion is not measured directly at the level of bits, but rather in an abstract semantic space. In order to make this precise, we take inspiration from cognitive neuroscience and machine learning and model semantic space as a continuous Euclidean vector space. In such a space, stimuli like speech, images, or even ideas, are mapped to high-dimensional real vectors, and the location of these embeddings determines their meaning relative to other embeddings. This suggests that a natural metric for semantic similarity is just the Euclidean distance, which is what we use in this work. We map the optimization problem of determining the minimal-length, meaning-preserving message to a spin glass Hamiltonian and solve the resulting statistical mechanics problem using replica theory. We map out the replica symmetric phase diagram, identifying distinct phases of semantic compression: a first-order transition occurs between lossy and lossless compression, whereas a continuous crossover is seen from extractive to abstractive compression. We conclude by showing numerical simulations of compressions obtained by simulated annealing and greedy algorithms, and argue that while the problem of finding a meaning-preserving compression is computationally hard in the worst case, there exist efficient algorithms which achieve near optimal performance in the typical case.

Title: Flowing menisci: coupled dynamics and liquid exchange with soap films
Authors: Alexandre Vigna-Brummer, Antoine Monier, Isabelle Cantat, Christophe Brouzet, Christophe Raufaste
Abstract: Liquid foams exhibit menisci whose lengths range from hundreds of microns in microfoams to several centimeters in macroscopic bubble arrangements. These menisci thin under gravity until reaching a steady thickness profile, where hydrostatic and capillary pressures are balanced. While these menisci are in contact with soap films, dynamical liquid exchanges between them are neglected in current drainage models, which assume thin films provide a negligible liquid reservoir. Using controlled experiments, we systematically measure the shape of an isolated meniscus placed in a vertical soap film. By increasing the film thickness, we identify a flowing regime in which the flux from the adjacent film significantly enlarges the meniscus. We present an analytical model that extends the drainage equation to incorporate this film flux and introduce a gravito-exchange length, which sets the minimum meniscus thickness. The model is in quantitative agreement with experiments, capturing the transition between hydrostatic and flowing menisci. This study has implications for flowing or rearranging foams, where thick films are commonly observed.

Title: Topological phenomena in artificial quantum materials revealed by local Chern markers
Authors: Catalin D. Spataru, Wei Pan, Alexander Cerjan
Abstract: A striking example of frustration in physics is Hofstadter's butterfly, a fractal structure that emerges from the competition between a crystal's lattice periodicity and the magnetic length of an applied field. Current methods for predicting the topological invariants associated with Hofstadter's butterfly are challenging or impossible to apply to a range of materials, including those that are disordered or lack a bulk spectral gap. Here, we demonstrate a framework for predicting a material's local Chern markers using its position-space description and validate it against experimental observations of quantum transport in artificial graphene in a semiconductor heterostructure, inherently accounting for fabrication disorder strong enough to close the bulk spectral gap. By resolving local changes in the system's topology, we reveal the topological origins of antidot-localized states that appear in artificial graphene in the presence of a magnetic field. Moreover, we show the breadth of this framework by simulating how Hofstadter's butterfly emerges from an initially unpatterned 2D electron gas as the system's potential strength is increased, and predict that artificial graphene becomes a topological insulator at the critical magnetic field. Overall, we anticipate that a position-space approach to determine a material's Chern invariant without requiring prior knowledge of its occupied states or bulk spectral gaps will enable a broad array of fundamental inquiries and provide a novel route to material discovery, especially in metallic, aperiodic, and disordered systems.

Title: Relativistic Spin-Lattice Interaction Compatible with Discrete Translation Symmetry in Solids
Authors: Bumseop Kim, Noejung Park, Kyoung-Whan Kim
Abstract: Recent interest in orbital angular momentum has led to a rapid expansion of research on spin-orbit coupling effects in solids, while also highlighting significant technical challenges. The breaking of rotational symmetry renders the orbital angular momentum operator ill-defined, causing conceptual and computational issues in describing orbital motion. To address these issues, here we propose an alternative framework. Based on the Bloch representation of the full relativistic interaction, we derive a field that directly couples to electron spins while preserving discrete translational symmetry, thereby eliminating the need for the position operator. Our approach is fully compatible with existing first-principles computational frameworks for both static and time-dependent density functional theory. We demonstrate that this method offers a more effective description of the Edelstein and spin Hall effects compared to conventional orbital angular momentum formalisms.

Title: Two-dimensional transverse-field $XY$ model with the in-plane anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction: Anisotropy-driven transition
Authors: Yoshihiro Nishiyama (Okayama university)
Abstract: The two-dimensional (2D) quantum spin-$S=1/2$ $XY$ model with the transverse-field $H$, in-plane-anisotropy $\gamma$, and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) $D$ interactions was investigated by means of the exact diagonalization method, which enables us to treat the $D$-mediated complex-valued Hermitian matrix elements. According to the preceding real-space renormalization group analysis at $H=0$, the $\gamma$-driven phase transition occurs generically for $D\ne 0$ in contrast to the 1D $XY$ model where both $\gamma$- and $D$-induced phases are realized for $\gamma>D$ and $ \gamma <D$, respectively. In this paper, we evaluated the $\beta$ function $\beta(\gamma)$, namely, the differential of $\gamma$ with respect to the concerned energy scale, and from its behavior in proximity to $\gamma=0$, we observed an evidence of the $\gamma$-driven phase transition; additionally, $\gamma$'s scaling dimension is estimated from $\beta(\gamma)$'s slope. It was also determined how the value of the DM interaction influences the order-disorder phase boundary $H_c(\gamma)$ around the multi-critical point, $\gamma \to 0$.

Title: $\textit{In situ}$ time-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy of shock-loaded magnesiosiderite

Abstract: Carbonate minerals are important in Earth's system sciences and have been found on Mars and in meteorites and asteroids, highlighting the importance of impacts in planetary processes. While extensively studied under static compression, the behavior of carbonates under shock compression remains underexplored, with no $\textit{in situ}$ X-ray investigations reported so far. Here we investigate natural magnesiosiderite (Fe$_{0.6}$Mg$_{0.4}$CO$_{3}$) under nanosecond laser-driven shock compression at pressures up to 150 GPa, coupled with $\textit{in situ}$ ultrafast synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The interpretation of the experimental spectra is complemented using first-principles absorption cross-section calculations performed on crystalline phases at different pressures and on a dense liquid phase obtained using density functional theory-based molecular dynamics (DFT-MD) simulations. Under laser-driven shock compression, the magnesiosiderite crystal phase remains unchanged up to the melt. Under shock reverberation, the absorption spectra show changes similar to those attributed to a high-spin to low-spin transition observed under static compression. At higher pressures, the laser shock induces the formation of CO$_4$ tetrahedral units in the melt. Upon unloading from the shocked state, only a few nanoseconds later, the original magnesiosiderite phase is recovered.

Title: Possible quantum spin liquid state of CeTa$_7$O$_{19}$
Authors: N. Li, A. Rutherford, Y. Y. Wang, H. Liang, Y. Zhou, Y. Sun, D. D. Wu, P. F. Chen, Q. J. Li, H. Wang, W. Xie, E. S. Choi, S. Z. Zhang, M. Lee, H. D. Zhou, X. F. Sun
Abstract: CeTa$_7$O$_{19}$ is a recently found two-dimensional triangular lattice antiferromagnet without showing magnetic order. We grew high-quality CeTa$_7$O$_{19}$ single crystals and studied the low-temperature magnetic susceptibility, specific heat and thermal conductivity. The dc magnetic susceptibility and magnetization reveal its nature of effective spin-1/2, easy axis anisotropy, and antiferromagnetic spin coupling. The ultralow-temperature ac susceptibility and specific heat data indicate the absence of any phase transition down to 20 mK. The ultralow-temperature thermal conductivity ($\kappa$) at zero magnetic field exhibits a non-zero residual term $\kappa_0/T =$ 0.0056 W/K$^2$m. Although the magnetic field dependence of $\kappa$ is rather weak, the 14 T thermal conductivity shows an essential zero residual term. All these results point to a possible ground state of quantum spin liquid.

Title: A two-dimensional semiconductor-semimetal drag hybrid
Authors: Yingjia Liu, Kaining Yang, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Wencai Ren, Zheng Vitto Han, Siwen Zhao
Abstract: Lateral charge transport of a two-dimensional (2D) electronic system can be much influenced by feeding a current into another closely spaced 2D conductor, known as the Coulomb drag phenomenon -- a powerful probe of electron-electron interactions and collective excitations. Yet the materials compatible for such investigations remain limited to date. Especially, gapped 2D semiconductors with inherently large correlations over a broad gate range have been rarely accessible at low temperatures. Here, we show the emergence of a large drag response (drag resistance $R_{\text{drag}}$ at the order of k$\Omega$, with a passive-to-active drag ratio up to $\sim$ 0.6) in a semiconductor-semimetal hybrid, realized in a graphene-MoS$_{2}$ heterostructure isolated by an ultrathin 3 nm hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) dielectric. We observe a crossover of $T$ to $T^{2}$ dependence of $R_{\text{drag}}$, separated by a characteristic temperature $T_{d} \sim E_{F}/k_{F}d$ ($d$ being the interlayer distance), in echo with the presence of a metal-insulator transition in the semiconducting MoS$_{2}$. Interestingly, the current nanostructure allows the decoupling of intralayer interaction-driven drag response by varying density in one layer with that in the other layer kept constant. A large Wigner-Seitz radius $r_{s}$ ($>$ 10 within the density range of 1 to $4 \times 10^{12}~\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$) in the massive Schrödinger carriers in MoS$_{2}$ is thus identified to dominate the quadratic dependence of total carriers in the drag system, while the massless Dirac carriers in graphene induce negligible drag responses as a function of carrier density. Our findings establish semiconductor-semimetal hybrid as a platform for studying unique interaction physics in Coulomb drag systems.

Title: Uniaxial Ordering by Self-Assembly of Isotropic Octahedral Junctions
Authors: Kazuya Saito
Abstract: We demonstrate that isotropic octahedral (sixfold branched) junctions with three diagonal endpoint pairs of different colors almost inevitably form a macroscopic assembly of uniaxial order, exhibiting the perfect order of a single color. Monte Carlo simulations of the antiferromagnetic three-state Potts model on the tripartite reo net, consisting of corner-sharing regular octahedrons, confirm this counterintuitive prediction, while showcasing switching self-assembly upon an ordering phase transition. The possible inequivalence of three directions, i.e., more symmetry breaking than uniaxiality, is found and discussed for the ordered phase of this model at finite temperatures. Some additional analyses of the model are provided, including the possibility of a metastable isotropic order, which aligns better with intuition.

Title: Electrical switching of Chern insulators in moire rhombohedral heptalayer graphene
Authors: Zhiyu Wang, Qianling Liu, Xiangyan Han, Zhuoxian Li, Wenjun Zhao, Zhuangzhuang Qu, Chunrui Han, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Zheng Vitto Han, Sicheng Zhou, Bingbing Tong, Guangtong Liu, Li Lu, Jianpeng Liu, Fengcheng Wu, Jianming Lu
Abstract: In orbital Chern insulators, the chemical potential acts as a tuning knob to reverse chirality in dissipationless edge currents, enabling electric-field control of magnetic order-key for future quantum electronics. Despite the rise of orbital Chern insulators, electrically switchable quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) remains rare, necessitating further investigation. Here, we demonstrate electric-field-induced reversal of orbital Chern insulators in a moire superlattice composed of rhombohedral heptalayer graphene (r-7LG) aligned with hexagonal boron nitride. At one electron per moire unit cell, two emerging Chern insulating phases - one pointing away from and the other toward graphene's charge neutrality point in the phase diagram of carrier density (n) versus magnetic field (B) - exhibit energetic competition modulated by both n and B. This switchable QAHE chirality in r-7LG demonstrates a layer-number dependent response: similar phenomena in moire r-6LG require much higher magnetic fields and are absent in thinner rhombohedral graphene. Our findings establish moire-engineered rhombohedral graphene as a promising platform for exploring topological quantum materials with electrically controllable chiral edge modes and magnetic order.

Title: Two-Dimensional Graphene-like BeO Sheet: A Promising Deep-Ultraviolet Nonlinear Optical Materials System with Strong and Highly Tunable Second Harmonic Generation
Authors: Linlin Liu, Congwei Xie, Abudukadi Tudi, Keith Butler, Zhihua Yang
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials with large band gaps and strong and tunable second-harmonic generation (SHG) coefficients play an important role in the miniaturization of deep-ultraviolet (DUV) nonlinear optical (NLO) devices. Despite the existence of numerous experimentally synthesized 2D materials, none of them have been reported to meet DUV NLO requirements. Herein, to the first time, an experimentally available graphene-like BeO monolayer only formed by NLO-active [BeO3] unit is suggested as a promising 2D DUV NLO material due to its ultrawide band gap (6.86 eV) and a strong SHG effect (\{chi}_"22" ^((2))(2D) = 6.81 Å\times pm/V) based on the first-principles calculations. By applying stacking, strain, and twist engineering methods, several 2D BeO sheets have been predicted, and the flexible structural characteristics endow them with tunable NLO properties. Remarkably, the extremely stress-sensitive out-of-plane \{chi}_"15" ^((2))(2D) and \{chi}_"33" ^((2))(2D) (exceptional 30% change) and the robust in-plane \{chi}_"22" ^((2))(2D) against large strains can be achieved together in AC-, AAC-, AAE, and ACE-stacking BeO sheets under in-plane biaxial strain, exhibiting emergent phenomena uniquely not yet seen in other known 2D NLO materials. Our present results reveal that 2D BeO systems should be a new option for 2D DUV NLO materials.

Title: Self-Consistent Field Theory for Semiflexible Gaussian Chain Model
Authors: Yutaka Oya, Toshihiro Kawakatsu
Abstract: Self-consistent field theory (SCFT) is one of the useful methods to simulate phase separated structures of multi-component polymer systems. In this article, we propose an SCFT for semiflexible polymer melts, where the basic equations for the SCFT are derived by introducing a bending stiffness into a flexible Gaussian bead-spring model and taking its continuous limit. Our SCFT is described by a coupled modified diffusion equations for the statistical weight of the chain conformation (path integral), which is a perturbation to semiflexible chains from the flexible Gaussian chain model. Using our modified diffusion equations, we investigated the influences of the bending stiffness on the conformations of symmetric semiflexible diblock copolymer in a strongly segregated lamellar structures and on the order-disorder transition.

Title: Inefficiency of the orbit Hall effect on spin torque in transition metal/ferromagnet bilayers
Authors: Yizhuo Song, Jialin Tian, Fanxing Zheng, Jianting Dong, Meng Zhu, Jia Zhang
Abstract: Electric field or current induced spin torque is crucial for spintronic devices, for instance the spin-orbit torque MRAM (magnetic random access memory). In this work, we systematically investigate the spin torque in transition metals(TM)/ferromagnets(FM) bilayers by using first-principles calculations. In order to examine the spin and orbital Hall contribution, the studied transition metals includes heavy metal Pt, W, Au as well as light metals Ti, V, Cr, Cu etc. The ferromagnets have been chosen to be CoFe and Ni, with the former being relevant for SOT-MRAM and the latter may exhibit large orbital Hall contribution. We found that in TM/CoFe bilayers with typical 3d and 5d transition metals, the spin torque on CoFe mainly originates from spin Hall mechanism with the magnitude and sign of spin torque efficiency consistent with the spin Hall conductivity. In TM/Ni bilayers, the spin Hall effect in bulk TM and Ni itself are account for the origin of spin torque. In both systems, we do not see effective contribution from orbital Hall effect in transition metals on the spin torque in TM/FM bilayers.

Title: Temperature Measurement via Time Crystal Frequencies in One-Dimensional Quantum Droplets
Authors: Saurab Das, Jagnyaseni Jogania, Jayanta Bera, Ajay Nath
Abstract: We propose a method for temperature measurement by analyzing the frequency of generated time crystals in one-dimensional (1D) quantum droplets. The system consists of a binary Bose-Einstein condensate mixture confined in a driven quasi-periodic optical lattice (QOL) with repulsive cubic effective mean-field and attractive quadratic beyond-mean-field interactions. By solving the 1D extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation, we derive the exact analytical wavefunction and investigate the droplet dynamics under different driving conditions. Specifically, we examine three cases: (i) constant driving frequency with linearly increasing QOL depth, (ii) constant QOL depth with linearly varying driving frequency, and (iii) constant driving frequency with sinusoidally modulated QOL depth. Fast Fourier Transform analysis reveals harmonic density oscillations, confirming time crystal formation. Additionally, we establish a non-trivial correlation between time crystal frequency and system temperature, demonstrating that an increase in time crystal frequency leads to oscillatory variations in the magnitude of the droplet's negative temperature. Finally, numerical stability analysis confirms that the obtained solutions remain robust, ensuring their feasibility for experimental realization.

Title: Extended Haldane model -- a modern gateway to topological insulators
Authors: Tanay Nag, Saptarshi Mandal
Abstract: The seminal Haldane model brings up a paradigm beyond the quantum Hall effect to look for a plethora of topological phases in the honeycomb and other lattices. Here we dwell into this model considering a full parameter space in the presence of spin-orbit interaction as well as Zeeman field such that the flavour of Kane-Mele model is invoked. Adopting this extended Haldane model as an example, we elucidate, in a transparent manner, a number of topological features in a pedagogical manner. First, we describe various first order topological insulator phases and their characterizations while explaining various anomalous quantum Hall effects and quantum spin Hall effects in the extended Haldane model. Second, we demonstrate the concepts of higher order topological insulator phases along with the topological invariants in the anisotropic limit of the extended Haldane model. At the end, we discuss various open issues involving \textcolor{black}{emergent or extended} symmetries that might lead to a broader understanding of various topological phases and the associated criteria behind their emergence.

Title: Direct Summation of the Madelung Constant using Axial Multipoles
Authors: Joven V. Calara (1), Jan D. Miller (2) ((1) Dept of Engineering, Salt Lake Community College, Salt Lake City, Utah (2) Dept of Metallurgy, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah)
Abstract: A direct summation method for the Madelung constant calculation is presented where a crystal lattice is constructed from linear arrays of charges or axial multipoles. An array is designed to have vanishing low order electric moments such that its potential at the origin from a distance $r$ decays at least as fast as $r^{-5}$, but preferably as fast as $r^{-13}$. High potential decay rates render the summation absolutely convergent in up to 6 dimensions. Convergence speed increases with higher decay rates. It is also shown that the limit approached by the summation is independent of the growth geometry. Madelung constants for NaCl bulk, surface, and edge lattice points are calculated, as well as on off-lattice points such as interstitial positions and external neighborhoods of surfaces. In addition, bulk CsCl Madelung constant was calculated. In 1D, 2D, and 3D, accuracy of 13 decimal places are attained within 40 nearest neighbor distance from the reference ion.

Title: LLM-Fusion: A Novel Multimodal Fusion Model for Accelerated Material Discovery
Authors: Onur Boyar, Indra Priyadarsini, Seiji Takeda, Lisa Hamada
Abstract: Discovering materials with desirable properties in an efficient way remains a significant problem in materials science. Many studies have tackled this problem by using different sets of information available about the materials. Among them, multimodal approaches have been found to be promising because of their ability to combine different sources of information. However, fusion algorithms to date remain simple, lacking a mechanism to provide a rich representation of multiple modalities. This paper presents LLM-Fusion, a novel multimodal fusion model that leverages large language models (LLMs) to integrate diverse representations, such as SMILES, SELFIES, text descriptions, and molecular fingerprints, for accurate property prediction. Our approach introduces a flexible LLM-based architecture that supports multimodal input processing and enables material property prediction with higher accuracy than traditional methods. We validate our model on two datasets across five prediction tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness compared to unimodal and naive concatenation baselines.

Title: Brownian-motion approach to statistical mechanics: Langevin equations, fluctuations, and timescales
Authors: Sushanta Dattagupta, Aritra Ghosh
Abstract: We briefly review the problem of Brownian motion and describe some intriguing facets. The problem is first treated in its original form as enunciated by Einstein, Langevin, and others. Then, utilizing the problem of Brownian motion as a paradigm and upon using the Langevin equation(s), we present a brief exposition of the modern areas of stochastic thermodynamics and fluctuation theorems in a manner accessible to a non-expert. This is followed by an analysis of non-Markovian Brownian dynamics via generalized Langevin equation(s) in which we particularly shed light onto its derivation, the emergence of the fluctuation-dissipation relation, and the recently-discovered effective-mass framework.

Title: Ruddlesden-Popper defects act as a free surface: role in formation and photophysical properties of CsPbI3
Authors: Weilun Li, Qimu Yuan, Yinan Chen, Joshua R. S. Lilly, Marina R. Filip, Laura M. Herz, Michael B. Johnston, Joanne Etheridge
Abstract: The perovskite semiconductor, CsPbI3, holds excellent promise for solar cell applications due to its suitable bandgap. However, achieving phase-stable CsPbI3 solar cells with high power conversion efficiency remains a major challenge. Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) defects have been identified in a range of perovskite semiconductors, including CsPbI3. However, there is limited understanding as to why they form or their impact on stability and photophysical properties. Here we increase the prevalence of RP defects with increased Cs-excess in vapour-deposited CsPbI3 thin films and observe superior structural stability but inferior photophysical properties. Significantly, using electron microscopy, we find that the atomic positions at the planar defect are comparable to those of a free surface, revealing their role in phase stabilisation. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the RP planes are electronically benign, however, antisites observed at RP turning points are likely to be malign. We therefore propose that increasing RP planes while reducing RP turning points could offer a breakthrough for improving both phase stability and photophysical performance. The formation mechanism revealed here may well apply more generally to RP structures in other perovskite systems.

Title: Optimizing GaAs/AlGaAs Growth on GaAs (111)B for Enhanced Nonlinear Efficiency in Quantum Optical Metasurfaces
Authors: T. Blaikie (1), M. C. Tam (1), S. Stich (2), M. Belkin (2), Z. R. Wasilewski (1 and 3 and 4) ((1) Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, (2) Walter Schottky Institute Technical University of Munich, (3) Physics and Astronomy, University of Waterloo, (4) Waterloo Institute for Nanotechnology)
Abstract: This study is an optimization of GaAs and Al$_{0.55}$Ga$_{0.45}$As growth on GaAs (111)B substrates with a surface misorientation of 2° towards [$\bar{2}$11], aiming to enhance surface morphology. For quantum optical metasurfaces (QOMs) the change from (001) growth to (111) growth will increase the efficiency of the nonlinear process of spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC). This work identifies key factors affecting surface roughness, including the detrimental effects of traditional thermal oxide desorption, which prevented growth of smooth surfaces. A novel Ga-assisted oxide desorption method using Ga flux "pulses" was developed, successfully removing oxides while preserving surface quality. In-situ characterization techniques, including reflection high energy electron diffraction (RHEED) and a novel technique called Diffuse Laser Scattering (DLS), were employed to monitor and control the oxide removal process. Mounting quarter wafers with sapphire substrates as optical diffusers improved surface uniformity by mitigating temperature gradients. The uniformity of the growths was clearly visualized by an in-house technique called black box scattering (BBS) imaging. Indium (In) was tested as a surfactant to promote step-flow growth in GaAs, which resulted in atomic-scale flatness with root mean square (RMS) roughness as low as 0.256 nm. In combination with a higher growth temperature, the RMS roughness of Al$_{0.55}$Ga$_{0.45}$As layers was reduced to 0.302 nm. The optimized growth methods achieved acceptable roughness levels for QOM fabrication, with ongoing efforts to apply these techniques to various devices based on GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures with (111) orientation.

Title: Synthesized Kuramoto potential via optomechanical Floquet engineering
Authors: Motoki Asano, Hajime Okamoto, Hiroshi Yamaguchi
Abstract: Synchronization is a ubiquitous scientific phenomenon in various physical systems. Here, we examine the feasibility of generating multistable and dynamically tunable synchronization by using the technique of Floquet engineering. Applying a periodically modulated laser light to optomechanical oscillators allows for stable and precise control of oscillator couplings. This enables us not only to explore the physics of quantized integer and fractional phase slips but also synthesize multioctave synchronizations of mechanical oscillators that exhibit tailorable multistability. Furthermore, the dynamically manipulated synchronizations lead to an exotic topology wherein the phase trajectories have a nontrivial winding number and giant non-reciprocity. This scheme could help to elucidate the dynamics of complicated oscillator networks like biological systems and to mimic their highly efficient information processing.

Title: Contactless measurements of the elastic modulus of living cells using thermal fluctuations of AFM cantilever
Authors: Hao Zhang, Zaicheng Zhang, Etienne Harte, Francoise Argoul, Abdelhamid Maali
Abstract: We present a contactless method for measuring the elastic modulus of living cells (human triple-negative breast cancer, MDA-MB-231) from the thermal fluctuations of an atomic force microscope (AFM) cantilever. By analyzing the power spectral density (PSD) of the cantilevers thermal fluctuations, we obtain the resonance frequencies of its first three modes at various cell to cantilever separation distances. By comparing measurements on living cells with those on a rigid borosilicate sphere of the same size, we extract the frequency shift caused by the elasto-hydrodynamic coupling between the cantilever fluctuations and the deformations of the cells. We then fit this frequency shift using an elasto-hydrodynamic model that integrates hydrodynamic forces and cell deformation. This approach allows us to determine the elastic modulus values of the living cells for the first three resonant frequencies of the cantilever.

Title: An interpretable continuum framework for decision-making: nonreciprocal field theory of the shepherding control problem
Authors: Andrea Lama, Mario di Bernardo, Sabine H. L. Klapp
Abstract: Field theories for complex systems traditionally focus on collective behaviors emerging from simple, reciprocal pairwise interaction rules. However, many natural and artificial systems exhibit behaviors driven by microscopic decision-making processes that introduce both nonreciprocity and many-body interactions, challenging these conventional approaches. We develop a theoretical framework to incorporate decision-making into field theories using the shepherding control problem as a paradigmatic example, where agents (herders) must coordinate to confine another group of agents (targets) within a prescribed region. By introducing continuous approximations of two key decision-making elements - target selection and trajectory planning - we derive field equations that capture the essential features of distributed control. Our theory reveals that different decision-making strategies emerge at the continuum level, from random to highly selective choices, and from undirected to goal-oriented motion, driving transitions between homogeneous and confined configurations. The resulting nonreciprocal field theory not only describes the shepherding problem but provides a general framework for incorporating decision-making into continuum theories of collective behavior, with implications for applications ranging from robotic swarms to crowd management systems.

Title: Probing $p$-wave effects in spin-density separation of Bose mixtures by dynamic structure factor
Authors: Xiaoran Ye, Zhaoxin Liang
Abstract: Quantum mixtures of Bose gases with tunable $s$- and $p$-wave interactions offer a versatile platform to explore strongly correlated phases and exotic phenomena. While repulsive interactions often drive phase separation, the interplay of $p$-wave interactions with spin-density decoupling remains underexplored. In this work, we employ the path integal field theory to investigate the role of $p$-wave interactions in three-dimensional two-component Bose gas. We derive the Lee-Huang-Yang corrections to the ground-state energy and quantum depletion, revealing how $p$-wave interactions modify equations of state of the model system. Furthermore, we demonstrate that $p$-wave interactions predominantly renormalize the spin-sector effective mass in the language of decoupling the density and spin-density degrees of freedom. This effect manifests in the dynamic structure factor, computed via hydrodynamic theory, where Bragg spectroscopy can detect a tunable splitting between spin and density modes. Our results bridge theoretical predictions with experimental observables, offering insights into anisotropic interaction effects in quantum gases and their implications for probing emergent phases.

Title: Interfacial strong coupling and negative dispersion of propagating polaritons in freestanding oxide membranes
Authors: Brayden Lukaskawcez, Shivasheesh Varshney, Sooho Choo, Sang Hyun Park, Dongjea Seo, Liam Thompson, Devon Uram, Hayden Binger, Steve Koester, Sang-Hyun Oh, Tony Low, Bharat Jalan, Alexander McLeod
Abstract: Membranes of complex oxides like perovskite SrTiO3 extend the multi-functional promise of oxide electronics into the nanoscale regime of two-dimensional materials. Here we demonstrate that free-standing oxide membranes supply a reconfigurable platform for nano-photonics based on propagating surface phonon polaritons. We apply infrared near-field imaging and -spectroscopy enabled by a tunable ultrafast laser to study pristine nano-thick SrTiO3 membranes prepared by hybrid molecular beam epitaxy. As predicted by coupled mode theory, we find that strong coupling of interfacial polaritons realizes symmetric and antisymmetric hybridized modes with simultaneously tunable negative and positive group velocities. By resolving reflection of these propagating modes from membrane edges, defects, and substrate structures, we quantify their dispersion with position-resolved nano-spectroscopy. Remarkably, we find polariton negative dispersion is both robust and tunable through choice of membrane dielectric environment and thickness and propose a novel design for in-plane Veselago lensing harnessing this control. Our work lays the foundation for tunable transformation optics at the nanoscale using polaritons in a wide range of freestanding complex oxide membranes.

Title: Huge Stress-induced Adiabatic Temperature Change in a High-Toughness All-d-metal Heusler Alloy
Authors: Rui Cai, Zhiyang Wei, Hongjie Ren, Hanyang Qian, Xinyu Zhang, Yao Liu, Xiang Lu, Wen Sun, Meng Gao, Enke Liu, Jian Liu, Guowei Li
Abstract: The elastocaloric effect (eCE), referring to the thermal effect triggered by a uniaxial stress, provides a promising and versatile routine for green and high efficient thermal management. However, current eCE materials generally suffer from relatively low eCE and poor mechanical properties, hindering their practical applications. Here, we report a exceptionally huge eCE with a directly measured adiabatic temperature change of up to 57.2 K in a dual-phase all-d-metal Heusler Mn50Ni37.5Ti12.5 polycrystalline alloy, revealing an extra contribution to the latent heat during the stress-induced martensitic transformation from B2 to L10, and breaking the record of adiabatic temperature change for elastocaloric alloys. Moreover, thanks to the combined strengthening effect of d-d hybridization and well-dispersed secondary cubic {\gamma} phase, the alloy can endure a uniaxial stress up to 1760 MPa. Such an abnormal huge eCE is attributed to the combination of the enhanced entropy change associated with a stress-induced B2 to L10 martensitic transformation under higher stress, in contrast with the thermally induced B2 to 5-layer modulated structure one, and the high transformation fraction due to the multi-point nucleation facilitated by the {\gamma} phase dispersed in the main phase. This work provides insight into making full use of the transformation heat to enhance the caloric effect for high-efficient thermal management systems.

Title: Do chain topology and polydispersity affect the two-stage heteropolymer coil-globule transition?
Authors: Thoudam Vilip Singh, Lenin S. Shagolsem
Abstract: The thermodynamic behavior of collapse transition in a fully flexible coarse-grained model of energy polydisperse polymer (EPP), a statistical model of random heteropolymer, is investigated in an implicit solvent by means of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Each monomer has interaction energy, $\varepsilon_i$, randomly drawn from a Gaussian distribution, and is characterised by polydispersity index, $\delta$ = standard deviation/mean, where the mean is fixed at $\langle \varepsilon \rangle$ = 2.5. Polymers of different chain topologies assume an expanded coil conformation at high temperature, and undergo a melting transition called a coil-globule transition when temperature is lowered. They collapse into molten globules. Further decrease in temperature results in a liquid-solid transition called a freezing transition, thus, creating crystallite structures at very low temperatures. The current study investigates the effect of chain topology and energy polydispersity in this regard from thermodynamic point of view.

Title: Deconfined criticality as intrinsically gapless topological state in one dimension
Authors: Sheng Yang, Fu Xu, Da-Chuan Lu, Yi-Zhuang You, Hai-Qing Lin, Xue-Jia Yu
Abstract: Deconfined criticality and gapless topological states have recently attracted growing attention, as both phenomena go beyond the traditional Landau paradigm. However, the deep connection between these two critical states, particularly in lattice realization, remains insufficiently explored. In this Letter, we reveal that certain deconfined criticality can be regarded as an intrinsically gapless topological state without gapped counterparts in a one dimensional lattice model. Using a combination of field-theoretic arguments and large-scale numerical simulations, we establish the global phase diagram of the model, which features deconfined critical lines separating two distinct spontaneous symmetry breaking ordered phases. More importantly, we unambiguously demonstrate that the mixed anomaly inherent to deconfined criticality enforces topologically robust edge modes near the boundary, providing a general mechanism by which deconfined criticality manifests as a gapless topological state. Our findings not only offer a new perspective on deconfined criticality but also deepen our understanding of gapless topological phases of matter.

Title: Experimentally achieving minimal dissipation via thermodynamically optimal transport
Authors: Shingo Oikawa, Yohei Nakayama, Sosuke Ito, Takahiro Sagawa, Shoichi Toyabe
Abstract: Optimal transport theory, originally developed in the 18th century for civil engineering, has since become a powerful optimization framework across disciplines, from generative AI to cell biology. In physics, it has recently been shown to set fundamental bounds on thermodynamic dissipation in finite-time processes. This extends beyond the conventional second law, which guarantees zero dissipation only in the quasi-static limit and cannot characterize the inevitable dissipation in finite-time processes. Here, we experimentally realize thermodynamically optimal transport using optically trapped microparticles, achieving minimal dissipation within a finite time. As an application to information processing, we implement the optimal finite-time protocol for information erasure, confirming that the excess dissipation beyond the Landauer bound is exactly determined by the Wasserstein distance - a fundamental geometric quantity in optimal transport theory. Furthermore, our experiment achieves the bound governing the trade-off between speed, dissipation, and accuracy in information erasure. To enable precise control of microparticles, we develop scanning optical tweezers capable of generating arbitrary potential profiles. Our work establishes an experimental approach for optimizing stochastic thermodynamic processes. Since minimizing dissipation directly reduces energy consumption, these results provide guiding principles for designing high-speed, low-energy information processing.

Title: Insight into interplay between bandstructure and Coulomb interaction via quasiparticle interference
Authors: Garima Goyal, Dheeraj Kumar Singh
Abstract: Quasiparticle interference has been used frequently for the purpose of unraveling the electronic states in the vicinity of the Fermi level as well as the nature of superconducting gap in the unconventional superconductors. Using the metallic spin-density wave state of iron pnictides as an example, we demonstrate that the quasiparticle interference can also be used as a probe to provide crucial insight into the interplay of the electronic bandstructure and correlation effects in addition to bringing forth the essential features of electronic states in the vicinity of the Fermi level. Our study reveals that the features of quasiparticle interference pattern can help us narrowing down the interaction parameter window and choose a more realistic tight-binding model.

Title: Pre-training Graph Neural Networks with Structural Fingerprints for Materials Discovery
Authors: Shuyi Jia, Shitij Govil, Manav Ramprasad, Victor Fung
Abstract: In recent years, pre-trained graph neural networks (GNNs) have been developed as general models which can be effectively fine-tuned for various potential downstream tasks in materials science, and have shown significant improvements in accuracy and data efficiency. The most widely used pre-training methods currently involve either supervised training to fit a general force field or self-supervised training by denoising atomic structures equilibrium. Both methods require datasets generated from quantum mechanical calculations, which quickly become intractable when scaling to larger datasets. Here we propose a novel pre-training objective which instead uses cheaply-computed structural fingerprints as targets while maintaining comparable performance across a range of different structural descriptors. Our experiments show this approach can act as a general strategy for pre-training GNNs with application towards large scale foundational models for atomistic data.

Title: Non-trivial phonon dynamics and significant electron-phonon coupling of the high frequency modes in a Dirac semimetal
Authors: Debasmita Swain, Akash Dey, Anushree Roy, Kush Saha, Sitikantha D. Das
Abstract: Using finite temperature Raman spectroscopy, we investigate the electron-phonon interactions (EPI) and phonon-phonon scattering dynamics in the Dirac semimetal Cd3As2 in different fre quency regimes. Strong softening of the Raman shifts below 200 K is observed for almost all the phonon modes with a marked deviation from the standard anharmonic behavior. The experimen tally observed Raman linewidth seems to be captured well by a combination of EPI, relevant at low temperature (LT) and phonon-phonon scattering, which is predominant at high temperatures (HT), leading to an observable minima in the thermal evolution of the linewidth. While this fea ture is most prominently observed in the highest-frequency Raman mode (196 cm-1), its intensity gradually diminishes as the Raman frequency decreases. Computation of the electronic contribution to the phonon linewidth, for both the high and low frequency modes, from the phonon self-energy shows that it qualitatively mimics the experimental observations. It is found that phonon-induced interband scattering results in the presence of a maxima in phonon linewidth that crucially depends on the finiteness of the chemical potential.

Title: Effects of the three-dimensional interplanar coupling on the centrosymmetric skyrmion crystal formation in the frustrated stacked-triangular Heisenberg model
Authors: R. Osamura, K. Aoyama, K. Mitsumoto, H. Kawamura
Abstract: Effects of the three-dimensional (3D) interplanar coupling on centrosymmetric skyrmion crystal (SkX) formation is investigated via extensive Monte Carlo simulations on the frustrated isotropic Heisenberg model on a stacked-triangular lattice in both cases of the ferromagnetic (F) and the antiferromagnetic (AF) nearest-neighbor interplanar coupling $J_{1c}$. The SkX phase is stabilized at finite fields and at finite temperatures for both F and AF $J_{1c}$, although it is destabilized by modestly weak AF $J_{1c}$. The magnetic phase diagram of the 3D short-range model is more or less similar to those of the 2D short-range model and of the 2D long-range RKKY model. We find that an intriguing phenomenon of replica-symmetry breaking, popular in glass physics and recently identified in the SkX phase of the 3D long-range RKKY model [K. Mitsumoto and H. Kawamura, Phys. Rev. B {\bf 104}, 184432 (2021)], does not arise in the 3D short-range model, suggesting that the long-range nature of interaction might be necessary to realize the RSB in centrosymmetric SkX state.

Title: Magnon damping and mode softening in quantum double-exchange ferromagnets without Jahn-Teller phonons
Authors: A. Moreo, E. Dagotto, G. Alvarez, T. Tohyama, M. Mierzejewski, J. Herbrych
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the magnetic excitations and electronic properties of fully quantum double-exchange ferromagnets, i.e., systems where ferromagnetic ordering emerges from the competition between spin, charge, and orbital degrees of freedom, but without the canonical approximation of using classical localized spins. Specifically, we investigate spin excitations within the Kondo lattice-like model, as well as a two-orbital Hubbard Hamiltonian in proximity to the orbital-selective Mott phase. Computational analysis of the magnon dispersion, damping, and spectral weight within these models reveals unexpected phenomena, such as magnon mode softening and the anomalous decoherence of magnetic excitations as observed in earlier experimental efforts, but explained here without the use of the phononic degrees of freedom. We show that these effects are intrinsically linked to incoherent spectral features near the Fermi level, which arise due to the quantum nature of the local (on-site) triplets. This incoherent spectrum leads to a Stoner-like continuum on which spin excitations scatter, governing magnon lifetime and strongly influencing the dynamical spin structure factor. Our study explores the transition from coherent to incoherent magnon spectra by varying the electron density. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the magnitude of the localized spin mitigates decoherence by suppressing the incoherent spectral contributions near the Fermi level. We also discuss the effective $J_1$-$J_2$ spin Hamiltonian, which can accurately describe the large doping region characterized by the magnon-mode softening. Finally, we show that this behavior is also present in multiorbital models with partially filled orbitals, namely, in systems without localized spin moments, provided that the model is in a strong coupling regime.

Title: Predicting the Néel temperatures in general helimagnetic materials: a comparison between mean field theory, random phase approximation, renormalized spin wave theory and classical Monte Carlo simulations
Authors: Varun Rajeev Pavizhakumari, Thomas Olsen
Abstract: The critical temperature for magnetic order comprises a crucial property of any magnetic material and ranges from a few Kelvin in certain antiferromagnets to 1400 K in ferromagnetic Co. However, the prediction of critical temperatures based on, for example, a spin wave dispersion is in general non-trivial. For ferromagnets and simple collinear antiferromagnets, estimates may be obtained from the Heisenberg model using either renormalized spin wave theory or the Green's function random phase approximation (RPA), but a systematic assessment of the accuracy of such approaches seems to be lacking in the literature. In this work, we propose generalizations of both renormalized spin wave theory and RPA to calculate the critical temperatures of single-$Q$ helimagnetic ground states, which include ferromagnets and antiferromagnets as special cases. We compare the methods to classical Monte Carlo simulations and Mean field theory, using experimental exchange parameters for a wide range of materials; MnO and NiO (single site Néel ground states), MnF$_2$ (altermagnet), Cr$_2$O$_3$ and Fe$_2$O$_3$ (two site Néel states) and Ba$_3$NbFe$_3$Si$_2$O$_{14}$ (incommensurate helimagnet). In all cases, we observe that predictions from RPA are in excellent agreement with experimental values and RPA thus constitutes a rather reliable all-purpose method for calculating critical temperatures.

Title: Encounter-based model of a run-and-tumble particle with stochastic resetting
Authors: Paul C Bressloff
Abstract: In this paper we analyze the effects of stochastic resetting on an encounter-based model of an unbiased run-and-tumble particle (RTP) confined to the half-line $[0,\infty)$ with a partially absorbing wall at $x=0$. The RTP tumbles at a constant rate $\alpha$ between the velocity states $\pm v$ with $v>0$. Absorption occurs when the number of collisions with the wall (discrete local time) exceeds a randomly generated threshold $\widehat{\ell}$ with probability distribution $\Psi(\ell)$. The extended RTP model has three state variables, namely, particle position $X(t)\in [0,\infty)$, the velocity direction $\sigma(t)\in\{-1, 1\}$, and the discrete local time $L(t)\in {\mathbb N}$. We initially assume that only $X(t)$ and $\sigma(t)$ reset at a Poisson rate $r$, whereas $L(t)$ is not changed. This implies that resetting is not governed by a renewal process. We use the stochastic calculus of jump processes to derive an evolution equation for the joint probability distribution of the triplet $(X(t),\sigma(t),L(t))$. This is then used to calculate the mean first passage time (MFPT) by performing a discrete Laplace transform of the evolution equation with respect to the local time. We thus find that the MFPT's only dependence on the distribution $\Psi$ is via the mean local time threshold. We also identify parameter regimes in which the MFPT is a unimodal function of both the resetting and tumbling rates. Finally, we consider conditions under which resetting is given by a renewal process and show how the MFPT in the presence of local time resetting depends on the full statistics of $\Psi$.

Title: Diffusion-mediated adsorption versus absorption at partially reactive targets: a renewal approach
Authors: Paul C Bressloff
Abstract: Renewal theory is finding increasing applications in non-equilibrium statistical physics. One example relates the probability density and survival probability of a Brownian particle or an active run-and-tumble particle with stochastic resetting to the corresponding quantities without resetting. A second example is so-called snapping out Brownian motion, which sews together diffusions on either side of an impermeable interface to obtain the corresponding stochastic dynamics across a semi-permeable interface. A third example relates diffusion-mediated surface adsorption-desorption (reversible adsorption) to the case of irreversible adsorption. In this paper we apply renewal theory to diffusion-mediated adsorption processes in which an adsorbed particle may be permanently removed (absorbed) prior to desorption. We construct a pair of renewal equations that relate the probability density and first passage time (FPT) density for absorption to the corresponding quantities for irreversible adsorption. We first consider the example of diffusion in a finite interval with a partially reactive target at one end. We use the renewal equations together with an encounter-based formalism to explore the effects of non-Markovian adsorption/desorption on the moments and long-time behaviour of the FPT density for absorption. We then analyse the corresponding renewal equations for a partially reactive semi-infinite trap and show how the solutions can be expressed in terms of a Neumann series expansion. Finally, we construct higher-dimensional versions of the renewal equations and derive general expression for the FPT density using spectral decompositions.

Title: An exact formula for the contraction factor of a subdivided Gaussian topological polymer
Authors: Jason Cantarella, Tetsuo Deguchi, Clayton Shonkwiler, Erica Uehara
Abstract: We consider the radius of gyration of a Gaussian topological polymer $G$ formed by subdividing a graph $G'$ of arbitrary topology (for instance, branched or multicyclic). We give a new exact formula for the expected radius of gyration and contraction factor of $G$ in terms of the number of subdivisions of each edge of $G'$ and a new weighted Kirchhoff index for $G'$. The formula explains and extends previous results for the contraction factor and Kirchhoff index of subdivided graphs.

Title: Coexistence of topological surface states and superconductivity in Dirac semimetal NiTe$_2$
Authors: Chen He, Jian-Zhou Zhao, Mei Du, Luo-Zhao Zhang, Jia-Ying Zhang, Kuo Yang, Noah F. Q. Yuan, Aleksandr Seliverstov, Ewald Janssens, Jun-Yi Ge, Zhe Li
Abstract: The coexistence of topological bands around the Fermi level ($E_F$) and superconductivity provides a fundamental platform for exploring their interplay. However, few materials inherently display both properties. In this study, we demonstrate the coexistence of topological surface states at the $E_F$ and superconductivity in NiTe$_2$ single crystals, a material hitherto not recognized as superconducting. Quasiparticle interference measurements performed via scanning tunneling microscopy suggest the presence of topological surface states at the $E_F$, which is further corroborated by density functional theory simulations. Experimental evidence for superconductivity is provided via electronic transport measurements and specific heat capacity analyses. Our results suggest that NiTe$_2$ represents a promising platform for investigating the rich interplay between topological states and superconductivity.

Title: Ultrafast dynamics of carriers, coherent acoustic phonons and strain pulses in BiSbTe1.5Se1.5 topological insulator thin films
Authors: Anupama Chauhan, Sidhanta Sahu, Poulami Ghosh, Dheerendra Singh, Sambhu G Nath, Anjan Kumar N M, P.K. Panigrahi, Chiranjib Mitra, N. Kamaraju
Abstract: We Investigate the ultrafast carrier, coherent acoustic phonons (CAPs), and acoustic strain pulse dynamics in topological insulator BiSbTe1.5Se1.5 (BSTS) thin films of varying thickness using degenerate pump-probe reflection spectroscopy. Here, Sapphire has been chosen as the main substrate due to its maximum acoustic reflectivity at the BSTS-sapphire interface compared to BSTS-GaAs, BSTS-Si, and BSTS-MgO interfaces. For the films with thickness more than twice the penetration depth, the transient reflectivity data predominantly exhibits travelling acoustic strain pulses (TASP) on the top of single-exponential electronic decay (~ 2 ps). In contrast, films with thickness less than penetration depth are dominated by CAPs and a bi exponential electronic background with decay times of ~ 2 ps and ~ 260-380 ps. The observed TASP dynamics are well-described by a theoretical acoustic strain model. Further, to elucidate the underlying physical mechanisms governing the behavior of photo-excited carriers, CAPs, and strain pulses, we performed carrier density and temperature-dependent (7-294 K) studies on BSTS films with thicknesses of 22 nm and 192 nm. In the 22 nm film, the both fast and slow decay processes increase with carrier density at room temperature but decrease with temperature at a carrier density of 1.7*10^{19} cm^{-3}. A detailed analysis suggests that the faster decay arises from electron-phonon scattering and carrier diffusion, while the slower decay likely results from defect-assisted and phonon-assisted recombination. Furthermore, increasing the sample temperature leads to anharmonic decay induced softening of ~ 14 % in the phonon frequency and an anomalous ~ 48 % decrease in the phonon damping parameter due to reduced Dirac surface electron and acoustic phonon scattering.

Title: Haldane Fractional Statistics for 1D Heisenberg Spin XXX Chain
Authors: Wei-Jia Liu, Jia-Jia Luo, Xi-Wen Guan
Abstract: Haldane's fractional exclusion statistics (FES) describes a generalized Pauli exclusion statistics, which can be regarded as an emergent quantum statistics induced by the intrinsic dynamical interaction. A non-mutual FES has been identified at the quantum criticality of the one-dimensional (1D) and 2D interacting Bose Gas [Nat. Sci. Rev. 9, nwac027 (2022)]. It is naturally asked if such a non-mutual FES can be induced by the spin-spin interaction in the antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 XXX chain? In this article, we first represent the Bethe ansatz equations of spin strings in terms of the FES equations of different species. Then we show that the 1D spin XXX chain remarkably possesses the non-mutual FES in the critical region. We observe that the equation of state in terms of the FES gives rises to full statistical properties of the model at quantum criticality, which are in good agreement with the results obtained from the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz (TBA) equations of the model. From the non-mutual FES, we also precisely determine the quantum scaling functions, which further agree well with the previous TBA results [Phys. Rev. B 96, 220401(R) (2017)]. Finally, we also build up an exact mapping between the scaling functions of the Lieb-Liniger model and the spin Heisenberg spin chain at quantum criticality. Our method provides deep insights into the critical phase of matter from quantum FES point of view.

Title: Modulating Optical Properties through Cation Substitution: Composition-Property Relationships in $M^I_3$$M^{III}$P$_3$O$_9$N:Eu$^{2+}$ ($M^I$=Na, K; $M^{III}$=Al, Ga, In)
Authors: Nakyung Lee, Justyna Zeler, Małgorzata Sójka, Eugeniusz Zych, Jakoah Brgoch
Abstract: Developing phosphors with narrow photoluminescence emission peaks and high chromatic stability holds significant importance in light-emitting diode (LED) display technologies, where a wide color gamut is essential to achieve the Rec. 2020 specifications. This research focuses on the optical properties of a solid solution: $M^I_{2.97}$Eu$_{0.015}$$M^{III}$P$_3$O$_9$N [$M^I$=Na, K; $M^{III}$=Al, (Al$_{0.75}$Ga$_{0.25}$), (Al$_{0.5}$Ga$_{0.5}$), (Al$_{0.25}$Ga$_{0.75}$), Ga, (Ga$_{0.75}$In$_{0.25}$), (Ga$_{0.5}$In$_{0.5}$)] to understand how the narrow-emitting photoluminescence in K$_3$AlP$_3$O$_9$N:Eu$^{2+}$ can evolve during host structure cation substitution. Photoluminescence measurements at low temperature (15 K) support that Eu$^{2+}$ replaces three crystallographically independent Na$^+$ sites in Na$_{2.97}$Eu$_{0.015}$AlP$_3$O$_9$N, similar to the parent K$^+$ phosphor, but substituting Ga$^{3+}$ and In$^{3+}$ for Al$^{3+}$ leads to a change in Eu$^{2+}$ site preference, narrowing the full-width-at-half-maximum (fwhm) of the emission peak. The chromatic stability and photoluminescence quantum yield are also enhanced with higher Ga$^{3+}$ content in the host but not with In$^{3+}$. Thermoluminescence analysis indicates the relationship between trap states and the enhanced quantum yield with Ga$^{3+}$ leads to the series' best performance. The analysis of the $M^I_{2.97}$Eu$_{0.015}$$M^{III}$P$_3$O$_9$N series offers insight into the potential method for modulating optical properties with cation substitution in the host structure.

Title: Statistical physics analysis of graph neural networks: Approaching optimality in the contextual stochastic block model
Authors: O. Duranthon, L. Zdeborová
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are designed to process data associated with graphs. They are finding an increasing range of applications; however, as with other modern machine learning techniques, their theoretical understanding is limited. GNNs can encounter difficulties in gathering information from nodes that are far apart by iterated aggregation steps. This situation is partly caused by so-called oversmoothing; and overcoming it is one of the practically motivated challenges. We consider the situation where information is aggregated by multiple steps of convolution, leading to graph convolutional networks (GCNs). We analyze the generalization performance of a basic GCN, trained for node classification on data generated by the contextual stochastic block model. We predict its asymptotic performance by deriving the free energy of the problem, using the replica method, in the high-dimensional limit. Calling depth the number of convolutional steps, we show the importance of going to large depth to approach the Bayes-optimality. We detail how the architecture of the GCN has to scale with the depth to avoid oversmoothing. The resulting large depth limit can be close to the Bayes-optimality and leads to a continuous GCN. Technically, we tackle this continuous limit via an approach that resembles dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) with constraints at the initial and final times. An expansion around large regularization allows us to solve the corresponding equations for the performance of the deep GCN. This promising tool may contribute to the analysis of further deep neural networks.

Title: Quasiparticle picture of topological phase transitions induced by interactions
Authors: S. S. Krishtopenko, A. V. Ikonnikov, F. Hartmann, S. Höfling, B. Jouault, F. Teppe
Abstract: We present a general recipe to describe topological phase transitions in condensed matter systems with interactions. We show that topological invariants in the presence of interactions can be efficiently calculated by means of a non-Hermitian quasiparticle Hamiltonian introduced on the basis of the Green's function. As an example analytically illustrating the application of the quasiparticle concept, we consider a topological phase transition induced by the short-range electrostatic disorder in a two dimensional system described by the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model. The latter allows us to explicitly demonstrate the change in the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant and explain the quantized values of the longitudinal conductance in a certain range of the Fermi energy and the disorder strength found previously in numerical calculations.

Title: Conductance, continuity, and ferromagnetic percolation thresholds in thin films
Authors: Gregory Kopnov, Alexander Gerber
Abstract: Classical percolation models predict the metal-insulator transition and the onset of the long-range ferromagnetic order at the same topological continuity threshold. We tested this prediction in thin films of ferromagnetic CoPd and found a dramatic difference between the conductance and magnetic thresholds. While the long-range ferromagnetic phase develops at or very close to the continuity threshold, the transition from the metal-like to insulator-like conductance develops in films several times thinner. We argue that atomically narrow low resistance gaps intersecting the fractal network of metallic clusters provide a consistent explanation of the effect. We identify the conduction threshold as the point in discontinuous films at which the resistance of intergranular junctions exceeds the quantum resistance mark.

Title: Efficient shortcuts-to-adiabaticity for loading an ultracold Fermi gas into higher orbital bands of one-dimensional optical lattice
Authors: Hang Yu, Haoyi Zhang, Bolong Jiao, Qinxuan Peng, Liao Sun, Jiaming Li, Le Luo
Abstract: We propose an experimental scheme to load ultracold Fermi gases from the ground orbital band of a one-dimensional optical lattice into the first excited orbital band. Unlike the narrow momentum distribution of a Bose-Einstein Condensate, Fermi gases exhibit a broad momentum distribution. To address this, we define the average loading efficiency across all quasi-momentum states and theoretically perform the loading operation simultaneously for each Bloch state. Using a multiparameter global optimization method, we determine the loading efficiency at various lattice depths. We can enhance the loading efficiency by adjusting the phase of the lattice, which leverages the different symmetries of Bloch wavefunctions in various optical lattice orbitals. We also identified that the primary factor hindering higher loading efficiency in the Fermi gas is the multiple occupancy of the quasi-momentum states. Our simulations of various occupancies revealed a decreasing trend in mean loading efficiency as the number of occupied quasi-momentum states increases. Finally, we compare our method with other loading techniques and assess its experimental feasibility.

Title: Temporal Correlations and Inelastic Dynamics in a Vibrated Binary Granular Mixture
Authors: Rameez Farooq Shah, Syed Rashid Ahmad, Shikha Kumari
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of binary mixtures of inelastic particles through event-driven molecular dynamics simulations, focusing on velocity autocorrelation functions (VACFs). The study examines two distinct particle types under varying inelasticity conditions, systematically analyzing coefficients of restitution (CoR) ranging from 0.80 to 0.95. Like-particle interactions (AA and BB) maintain equal CoR values, while unlike-particle interactions (AB) are assigned the average CoR. The simulation framework incorporates a vibrating base system to maintain energy input and system stability. Our analysis reveals significant differences in VACF decay rates between Type 1 and Type 2 particles, demonstrating non-equipartition of energy within the binary mixture. The degree of this disparity is strongly influenced by the coefficient of restitution, with lower CoR values leading to more pronounced differences between particle types. These findings provide insights into the complex dynamics of granular gases and the role of inelasticity in energy distribution within binary mixtures. Our study contributes to the understanding of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics in granular systems and has potential implications for industrial processes involving particulate materials, such as fluidized beds and pneumatic conveying systems.

Title: Beyond Born-Oppenheimer Green's function theories: absolute and relational
Authors: Ville J. Härkönen
Abstract: We consider quantum field theoretic many-body Green's function approach to solve the Coulomb many-body problem. The earlier beyond Born-Oppenheimer Green's function theories are absolute in nature and are based on the non-reduced Hamiltonian. Motivated by the issues following this approach we have developed a reduced Green's function theory which is relational in nature. The central differences between these approaches trace back to the relational-absolute debate, which has continued for over two thousand years since the time of Aristotle and still persists today. We highlight that these aspects of the theories are connected to several areas of modern physics, including relational quantum mechanics, quantum reference frames, superselection rules, the separation of different types of motion and spontaneous symmetry breaking. The starting point of any such exact theory must be absolute, given that the global conservation laws hold. However, for the observables to be meaningful, they must be defined with respect to the relative space. Approximations, such as the one introduced by Born and Oppenheimer, can break global symmetries and make certain parts of the absolute description well-defined. We highlight that spontaneous symmetry breaking is not necessary to explain the existence of solids, but entities such as phonons can be naturally explained within the relational theory.

Title: The emergent dynamics of double-folded randomly branching ring polymers
Authors: Elham Ghobadpour, Max Kolb, Ivan Junier, Ralf Everaers
Abstract: The statistics of randomly branching double-folded ring polymers are relevant to the secondary structure of RNA, the large-scale branching of plectonemic DNA (and thus bacterial chromosomes), the conformations of single-ring polymers migrating through an array of obstacles, as well as to the conformational statistics of eukaryotic chromosomes and melts of crumpled, non-concatenated ring polymers. Double-folded rings fall into different dynamical universality classes depending on whether the random tree-like graphs underlying the double-folding are quenched or annealed, and whether the trees can undergo unhindered Brownian motion in their spatial embedding. Locally, one can distinguish (i) repton-like mass transport around a fixed tree, (ii) the spontaneous creation and deletion of side branches, and (iii) displacements of tree node, where complementary ring segments diffuse together in space. Here we employ dynamic Monte Carlo simulations of a suitable elastic lattice polymer model of double-folded, randomly branching ring polymers to explore the mesoscopic dynamics that emerge from different combinations of the above local modes in three different systems: ideal non-interacting rings, self-avoiding rings, and rings in the melt state. We observe the expected scaling regimes for ring reptation, the dynamics of double-folded rings in an array of obstacles, and Rouse-like tree dynamics as limiting cases. Of particular interest, the monomer mean-square displacements of $g_1\sim t^{0.4}$ observed for crumpled rings with $\nu=1/3$ are similar to the subdiffusive regime observed in bacterial chromosomes. In our analysis, we focus on the question to which extent contributions of different local dynamical modes to the emergent dynamics are simply additive. Notably, we reveal a non-trivial acceleration of the dynamics of interacting rings, when all three types of local motion are present.

Title: Leap into the future: shortcut to dynamics for quantum mixtures
Authors: Pablo Capuzzi, Zehra Akdeniz, Patrizia Vignolo
Abstract: The study of the long-time dynamics of quantum systems can be a real challenge, especially in systems like ultracold gases, where the required timescales may be longer than the lifetime of the system itself. In this work, we show that it is possible to access the long-time dynamics of a strongly repulsive atomic gas mixture in shorter times. The shortcut-to-dynamics protocol that we propose does not modify the fate of the observables, but effectively jumps ahead in time without changing the system's inherent evolution. Just like the fast-forward button in a movie player that allows to quickly reach the part of the movie one wants to watch, it is a leap into the future.

Title: Tail-induced equilibration in long-range interacting quantum lattices
Authors: Wei-Han Li
Abstract: We examine the relation between inter-particle interactions and real-time equilibration in one-dimensional lattice systems with hard-core constraints. Focusing on the roles of interactions, our results demonstrate that in the presence of interaction tails, any power-law exponent (including the limit ones) can encode the random particle configurations to the Hamiltonian, leaving the latter characterized by random matrices. Through an experimental-accessible setup using dipolar-interacting particles in optical lattices, the quenched relaxations are demonstrated resulting in equilibrium, and the relation between eigenstate thermalization is confirmed. Our study directly unveiled the role of inter-particle interactions in quantum many-body dynamics, offering a new scheme to address equilibration in closed quantum many-body problem based on the manifesting of random particle configurations in the model Hamiltonian.

Title: Confinement-induced unatomic trimer states in mass-imbalanced systems
Authors: Rafael M. Francisco, D. S. Rosa, T. Frederico, M. T. Yamashita, G. Krein
Abstract: As resonantly interacting trimers of the type AAB are progressively squeezed from $D=3$ to $D=2$, unatomic states emerge. We calculated the contacts from the high momentum tail of the single particle densities. The sharp increase of the contacts serves as a signature of the transition between the Efimov and unatomic regimes, characterized by the emergence of continuous scale invariance when the system reaches a critical dimension, $D_c$. This continuous scale invariance starts to dominate the behavior of the system at the dimension $\overline{D}<D_c$, below which the trimers momentum distribution tails exhibit a power-law behavior signaling the unatomic regime. To illustrate our findings, we studied compounds of the forms $^{7}$Li$-^{23}$Na$_{2}$, $^{7}$Li$-^{87}$Rb$_{2}$ and $^{7}$Li$-^{133}$Cs$_{2}$. The increase in the mass-imbalance of the trimers reduces the interval between $D_c$ and $\overline{D}$. The emergence of unatomic states can be experimentally verified by observing the two-body contact parameter, which is a quantity directly related to the thermodynamic properties of the gas.

Title: Dynamical exponents as an emergent property at interacting topological quantum critical points
Authors: Fan Yang, Zheng-Cheng Gu, Fei Zhou
Abstract: In standard studies of quantum critical points (QCPs), the dynamical exponent $z$ is introduced as a fundamental parameter along with global symmetries to identify universality classes. Often, the dynamical exponent $z$ is set to be one as the most natural choice for quantum field theory representations, which further implies emergence of higher space-time symmetries near QCPs in many condensed matter systems. In this article, we study a family of topological quantum critical points (tQCPs) where the $z=1$ quantum field theory is prohibited in a fundamental representation by a protecting symmetry, resulting in tQCPs with $z=2$. We further illustrate that when strong interactions are properly taken into account, the stable weakly interacting gapless tQCPs with $z=2$ can further make a transition to another family of gapless tQCPs with dynamical exponent $z=1$, without breaking the protecting symmetry. Our studies suggest that dynamical exponents, as well as the degrees of freedom in fermion fields, can crucially depend on interactions in topological quantum phase transitions; in tQCPs, to a large extent, they are better thought of as emergent properties.

Title: Universal whirling magnetic orders in non-Heisenberg Tsai-type quasicrystal approximants
Authors: Farid Labib, Kazuhiro Nawa, Yusuke Nambu, Hiroyuki Takakura, Yoichi Ikeda, Kazuhiko Deguchi, Masato Matsuura, Asuka Ishikawa, Ryoichi Kajimoto, Kazuhiko Ikeuchi, Taku J. Sato, Ryuji Tamura
Abstract: Magnetic orders of non-Heisenberg Tsai-type 1/1 approximant crystals (ACs) in the Au-Ga-Dy system were studied through bulk magnetization, neutron diffraction, and inelastic neutron scattering techniques. The results uncovered noncoplanar, ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin configurations whirling along [111] crystallographic axis, which is analogous to those observed in the Tb- and Ho-contained counterparts. The crystal electric field excitations similar to those in the Tb-based counterpart are also observed indicating the strong Ising-like magnetic anisotropy. These comprehensive experiments and analyses have revealed the existence of a universal mechanism that stabilizes noncoplanar FM and AFM structures in non-Heisenberg Tsai-type ACs, independent of the rare-earth species (Tb, Dy, Ho); FM intra-cluster interactions and strong Ising-like anisotropy.

Title: A multi-component phase-field model for T1 precipitates in Al-Cu-Li alloys
Authors: Ali Reza Safi, Elizabeth Mathew, Rupesh Chafle, Benjamin Klusemann
Abstract: In this study, the role of elastic and interfacial energies in the shape evolution of T1 precipitates in Al-Cu-Li alloys is investigated using phase-field modeling. We employ a formulation considering the stoichiometric nature of the precipitate phase explicitly, including coupled equation systems for various order parameters. Inputs such as elastic properties are derived from DFT calculations, while chemical potentials are obtained from CALPHAD databases. This methodology provides a framework that is consistent with the derived chemical potentials to study the interplay of thermodynamic, kinetic, and elastic effects on T1 precipitate evolution in Al-Cu-Li alloys. It is shown that diffusion-controlled lengthening and interface-controlled thickening are important mechanisms to describe the growth of T1 precipitates. Furthermore, the study illustrates that the precipitate shape is significantly influenced by the anisotropy in interfacial energy and linear reaction rate, however, elastic effects only play a minor role.

Title: "Half-Bogoliubons" as the intermediate states for the phase coherence in underdoped cuprates
Authors: Han Li, Zhaohui Wang, Shengtai Fan, Jiaseng Xu, Huan Yang, Hai-Hu Wen
Abstract: Superconductivity is achieved by the pairing of electrons and phase coherence between the Cooper pairs. According to the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory, the quasiparticles with Bogoliubov dispersion exists and reveal particle-hole symmetric coherence peaks on the single particle tunneling spectrum. Here we report the observation of two kinds of tunneling spectra showing only one side of the "coherence peak" but with symmetric energies (about +-11 meV) in underdoped cuprate superconductor Bi2Sr2-xLaxCuO6 single crystals (p=0.114) with fractional superconductivity. Merging these two kinds of spectra can mimic the complete Bogoliubov dispersion, thus we name the electronic states associated with these half-peaked spectrum as "half Bogoliubons". In previous studies, it was shown that two doped holes may bind into a local pair within the 4a0 x 4a0 plaquette of CuO bonds (a0: distance between nearest Cu atoms). We attribute the "half-Bogoliubons" to the intermediate states for the phase coherence, and they correspond to the three-hole and one-hole states as the excited ones from the local pairing state of two holes. An entanglement of these two "half-Bogoliubons" would mean the dynamic hopping of charge freedom resulting in the phase coherence between the local paired states. Our results unravel a unique process for establishing the phase coherence through exchanging a charge between the regions with local pairs.

Title: Tracking Cluster Continuity and Dynamics in Time-Series Data: Application to Chromatin Polymer Simulations
Authors: Ryo Nakanishi, Koji Hukushima
Abstract: This study presents an enhanced method for analyzing cluster dynamics, with a particular focus on tracking clusters' continuity over time using time-series data from molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The proposed method was applied to spatio-temporal cluster data obtained from a non-equilibrium MD simulation of a chromatin polymer model. In this model, clusters are formed on the polymer by binding molecules that stochastically and temporarily bind to the polymer segments at finite rates. Our analysis successfully tracked the dynamics of clusters, including merging and splitting events, and revealed that clusters exhibit a percolation transition in both spatial and temporal domains. This suggests that clusters in the chromatin polymer model can persist even under finite rates of attractive interactions, demonstrating that the method can capture complex cluster dynamics over time.

Title: Giant non-reciprocal band structure effect in a multiferroic material
Authors: Srdjan Stavrić, Giuseppe Cuono, Baishun Yang, Álvaro R. Puente-Uriona, Julen Ibañez-Azpiroz, Paolo Barone, Andrea Droghetti, Silvia Picozzi
Abstract: Multiferroic materials, characterized by the coexistence of ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism, may unveil band structures suggestive of complex phenomena and new functionalities. In this Letter, we analyze the band structure of EuO in its multiferroic phase. Using density functional theory calculations and detailed symmetry analysis, we reveal a previously overlooked non-reciprocal band structure effect, where the electronic energy bands exhibit asymmetry along opposite directions with respect to the special points in the Brillouin zone. This effect, which is enabled by spin-orbit coupling, is giant for the top valence Eu $4f$ bands, and can be switched by external electric or magnetic fields. Furthermore, this results in an enhanced bulk photovoltaic effect. Specifically, our predictions indicate the emergence of a large injection current response to linearly polarized light, resulting in a photoconductivity value several orders of magnitude higher than that reported in any other oxide material. Ultimately, this non-reciprocal band structure effect and the associated large bulk photovoltaic response may be general phenomena emerging not just in EuO but also in other multiferroics or magnetoelectrics, potentially providing new cross-functionalities.

Title: Flat bands and temperature-driven phase transition in quasi-one-dimensional zigzag chains
Authors: Jisong Gao, Haijun Cao, Xuegao Hu, Hui Zhou, Zhihao Cai, Qiaoxiao Zhao, Dong Li, Zhicheng Gao, Shin-ichiro Ideta, Kenya Shimada, Peng Cheng, Lan Chen, Kehui Wu, Sheng Meng, Baojie Feng
Abstract: Flat-band materials have garnered extensive attention due to their captivating properties associated with strong correlation effects. While flat bands have been discovered in several types of 2D materials, their existence in 1D systems remains elusive. Here, we propose a 1D frustrated lattice, specifically the 1D zigzag lattice, as a platform for hosting flat bands. This lattice can be experimentally realized by growing CuTe chains on Cu(111). The presence of flat bands was confirmed by tight-binding model analysis, first-principles calculations, and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements. In addition, we discovered a temperature-driven phase transition at approximately 250 K. Detailed analyses demonstrate that the system has a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid behavior, accompanied by spin-charge separation effects. Our work unveils new prospects for investigating strongly correlated electron behaviors and topological properties in the 1D limit.

Title: Self-interacting processes via Doob conditioning
Authors: Francesco Coghi, Juan P. Garrahan
Abstract: We connect self-interacting processes, that is, stochastic processes where transitions depend on the time spent by a trajectory in each configuration, to Doob conditioning. In this way we demonstrate that Markov processes with constrained occupation measures are realised optimally by self-interacting dynamics. We use a tensor network framework to guide our derivations. We illustrate our general results with new perspectives on well-known examples of self-interacting processes, such as random walk bridges, excursions, and forced excursions.

Title: First-principles Hubbard parameters with automated and reproducible workflows
Authors: Lorenzo Bastonero, Cristiano Malica, Eric Macke, Marnik Bercx, Sebastian P. Huber, Iurii Timrov, Nicola Marzari
Abstract: We introduce an automated, flexible framework (aiida-hubbard) to self-consistently calculate Hubbard $U$ and $V$ parameters from first-principles. By leveraging density-functional perturbation theory, the computation of the Hubbard parameters is efficiently parallelized using multiple concurrent and inexpensive primitive cell calculations. Furthermore, the intersite $V$ parameters are defined on-the-fly during the iterative procedure to account for atomic relaxations and diverse coordination environments. We demonstrate the scalability and reliability of the framework by computing in high-throughput fashion the self-consistent onsite $U$ and intersite $V$ parameters for 115 Li-containing bulk solids. Our analysis of the Hubbard parameters calculated reveals a significant correlation of the onsite $U$ values on the oxidation state and coordination environment of the atom on which the Hubbard manifold is centered, while intersite $V$ values exhibit a general decay with increasing interatomic distance. We find, e.g., that the numerical values of $U$ for Fe and Mn 3d orbitals can vary up to 3 eV and 6 eV, respectively; their distribution is characterized by typical shifts of about 0.5 eV and 1.0 eV upon change in oxidation state, or local coordination environment. For the intersite $V$ a narrower spread is found, with values ranging between 0.2 eV and 1.6 eV when considering transition metal and oxygen interactions. This framework paves the way for the exploration of redox materials chemistry and high-throughput screening of $d$ and $f$ compounds across diverse research areas, including the discovery and design of novel energy storage materials, as well as other technologically-relevant applications.

Title: Is Triboelectricity Confusing, Confused or Complex?
Authors: Karl P. Olson, Laurence D. Marks
Abstract: In this report, we look at the fundamental physics of triboelectricity, charge transfer due to contact and sliding. While much of the report focuses upon recent advances such as the incorporation of flexoelectric contributions, we also include older work, some from centuries ago, which only now can be understood in a general sense. Basic concepts and theories ranging from elements of tribology and contact mechanics through semiconductor built-in potentials, electromechanical terms, mechanochemistry and trap states are briefly described, linking to established surface science and interface physics. We then overview the main models that have been proposed, showing that they all fall within conventional electrostatics combined with other established science. We conclude with some suggestions for the future. Based upon this overview, our conclusion is that triboelectricity is a slightly complex combination of standard electrostatic phenomena that can be understood using the generalized Ampere's law connecting the electric displacement field with both Coulomb and polarization contributions, and the free carrier density, that is Grad.D=rho. Triboelectricity may be confusing, it is not really confused if care is taken, but it is complex.

Title: Nonuniform superconducting states caused by odd-frequency Cooper pairs
Authors: Takumi Sato, Satoru Hayami, Shingo Kobayashi, Yasuhiro Asano
Abstract: We discuss the origin of a nonuniform superconducting state in which Cooper pairs have a finite center of mass momentum. The instability to such a nonuniform superconducting state is analyzed by a pole of the pair fluctuation propagator for weak coupling superconductors. The results show that odd(even)-frequency Cooper pairs stabilize a nonuniform (uniform) superconducting phase below the transition temperature. We provide a theoretical framework that explains the reasons for appearing the nonuniform superconducting states.

Title: Exchange-phase erasure in anyonic Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometry
Authors: Sushanth Varada, Christian Spånslätt, Matteo Acciai
Abstract: Two-particle interferometry is an important tool for extracting the exchange statistics of quantum particles. We theoretically investigate the prospects of such interferometry to probe the statistics of point-like anyonic excitations injected in a Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) setup based on a quantum point contact device in the fractional quantum Hall regime. We compute the standard HOM ratio, i.e., the ratio of tunneling noises for two- and one-particle injections, and find that for point-like anyons, it only depends on the temperature and the anyon scaling dimension. Importantly, the latter is not necessarily related to the exchange phase. In fact, we establish that the HOM ratio does not reveal the exchange phase of the injected anyons: For injection-time delays that are small compared to the thermal time scale, we find that the exchange phase accumulated due to time-domain braiding between injected and thermally activated anyons is erased due to two mutually canceling sub-processes. In contrast, for time delays large compared to the thermal time, only a single sub-process contributes to the braiding, but the accumulated phase is canceled in the HOM ratio. These findings suggest caution when interpreting HOM interferometry experiments with anyons and approaches beyond the standard HOM ratio are thus necessary to extract anyonic statistics with two-particle interferometry experiments.

Title: Hydrogen bond-driven interactions between chitosan and biobased surfactants: A study of bulk behavior and surface adsorption
Authors: Ana Puente-Santamaria, Josselyn N. Molina-Basurto, Eva Gerardin, Francisco Ortega, Ramon G. Rubio, Eduardo Guzman
Abstract: This study explores the hydrogen bond-mediated association between chitosan (CHI) and alkyl polyglucoside (APG), a bio-based surfactant, in acidic conditions with varying ionic strengths. Unlike conventional polyelectrolyte-surfactant interactions that depend on electrostatic forces, the association in this system relies purely on non-ionic interactions. Using UV visible spectroscopy, phase diagrams, and quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D), the bulk phase behavior and adsorption characteristics of CHI-APG mixtures on negatively charged surfaces was studied. Results demonstrate that APG concentration controls the phase behavior, with moderate levels inducing coacervate formation, while higher ionic strengths promote this coacervation through enhanced hydrogen bonding interactions. This shift leads to the formation of a phase separated morphology, with micronsized coacervate droplets observable in solution. Zeta potential measurements suggest that these droplets adopt a core shell structure, characterized by a hydrophobic core due to the surfactant s alkyl chains and a hydrophilic shell formed by chitosan. Additionally, the coacervation process significantly enhances the adsorption of CHI APG complexes onto solid substrates, a feature with potential applications in targeted delivery and controlled release systems. Overall, this study provides critical insights into the design of bio-based, sustainable formulations and expands the understanding of hydrogen bond-driven, nonelectrostatic coacervation, relevant for applications in cosmetics, biomedical coatings, and environmentally friendly materials.

Title: Doping-Driven Modulation of Spin-Orbit Coupling, Spin Textures, and Rashba-Edelstein Response in Chiral Tellurium: A First-Principles Study
Authors: Sonam Phuntsho
Abstract: Chiral semiconductors such as elemental tellurium (Te) exhibit unconventional spin textures and large charge-to-spin conversion efficiencies, yet the influence of doping on these properties remains underexplored. Here, we address this gap by investigating how substituting Te with lighter (S, Se) or heavier (Sb) elements systematically modifies the spin-orbit-driven phenomena in chiral Te, including the band structure, spin Berry curvature, and Rashba-Edelstein response. The objective is to determine whether doping strategies can be leveraged to optimize collinear spin textures, enhance spin accumulation, and possibly extend spin lifetimes-all crucial aspects for magnet-free spintronics. Using density functional theory calculations implemented in Quantum ESPRESSO, combined with tight-binding interpolation in PAOFLOW, we map out the doping-dependent electronic states and quantify their associated spin transport coefficients. Our findings reveal that lighter dopants shift the Fermi level to regions of pronounced spin splitting, thereby increasing the magnitude of spin current conversion, whereas heavier dopants can introduce or remove near-degenerate bands that strongly affect spin-orbit coupling. In both scenarios, the fundamental chirality of Te remains robust, preserving the radial or "collinear" spin-momentum locking. These results not only confirm that doping is a potent and feasible route for tuning spin-orbit phenomena but also offer practical guidelines for experimental efforts aiming to engineer chiral semiconductors for spin devices. By correlating dopant identity with specific spin-texture enhancements, this study paves the way for rationally designing next-generation spintronic components free from external magnetic fields.

Title: Mesoscopic scale study of lateral dynamics of Sn-intercalation of the buffer layer on SiC
Authors: Benno Harling, Zamin Mamiyev, Christoph Tegenkamp, Martin Wenderoth
Abstract: The dynamics of Sn intercalation of the buffer layer on SiC was investigated with a frozen-in diffusion front using Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy. The technique allows to laterally distinguish between intercalated regions and the pristine buffer layer. Comparing topography features with the surface potential on the mesoscopic scale confirms that surface steps act as transport barriers. The results show a distinct pin hole mechanism for the material flow from terrace to terrace of the vicinal substrate surface. Nucleation and the formation of tin intercalated phase on terraces happen at steps. This results in a mesoscopic growth against the macroscopic diffusion direction.

Title: Dynamics of single Au nanoparticles on graphene simultaneously in real- and diffraction space by time-series convergent beam electron diffraction
Authors: Sara Mustafi, Rongsheng Cai, Sam Sullivan-Allsop, Matthew Smith, Nicholas J. Clark, Matthew Lindley, Ding Peng, Kostya S. Novoselov, Sarah J. Haigh, Tatiana Latychevskaia
Abstract: Convergent beam electron diffraction (CBED) on two-dimensional materials allows simultaneous recording of the real-space image (tens of nanometers in size) and diffraction pattern of the same sample in one single-shot intensity measurement. In this study, we employ time-series CBED to visualize single Au nanoparticles deposited on graphene. The real-space image of the probed region, with the amount, size, and positions of single Au nanoparticles, is directly observed in the zero-order CBED disk, while the atomic arrangement of the Au nanoparticles is available from the intensity distributions in the higher-order CBED disks. From the time-series CBED patterns, the movement of a single Au nanoparticle with rotation up to 4° was recorded. We also observed facet diffraction lines - intense bright lines formed between the CBED disks of the Au nanoparticle, which we explain by diffraction at the Au nanoparticle's facets. This work showcases CBED as a useful technique for studying adsorbates on graphene using Au nanoparticles as a model platform, and paves the way for future studies of different objects deposited on graphene.

Title: Investigation of O interstitial diffusion in $β$-Ga$_2$O$_3$: direct approach via master diffusion equations
Authors: Grace McKnight, Channyung Lee, Elif Ertekin
Abstract: Monoclinic $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$, a promising wide band gap semiconducting material, exhibits complex, anisotropic diffusional characteristics and mass transport behavior as a results of its low symmetry crystal structure. From first-principles calculations combined with master diffusion equations, we determine three-dimensional diffusion tensors for neutral ($\text{O}_{\text{i}}^{0}$) and 2- charged oxygen interstitials ($\text{O}_{\text{i}}^{2-}$). Systematic exploration of the configurational space identifies stable configurations in these two dominant charge states and their corresponding formation energies. By connecting every pair of low-energy configurations considering both interstitial or interstitialcy hops, we construct three-dimensional diffusion networks and evaluate hopping barriers of all transition pathways in networks. Combining the collection of (i) defect configurations and their formation energies and (ii) the hopping barriers that link them, we construct and solve the master diffusion equations for $\text{O}_{\text{i}}^{0}$ and $\text{O}_{\text{i}}^{2-}$ separately through the Onsager approach, resulting in respective three-dimensional diffusion tensors D$_{\text{O}_{\text{i}}}^{0}$ and D$_{\text{O}_{\text{i}}}^{2-}$. Both $\text{O}_{\text{i}}^{0}$ and $\text{O}_{\text{i}}^{2-}$ present the fastest diffusion along the $b$-axis, demonstrating significant anisotropy. The predicted self-diffusivities along [100] and [$\overline{2}01$] align well with previously reported values from isotopically labeled oxygen tracer experiments, highlighting the reliability of the approach in capturing complex diffusion mechanisms.

Title: Growth dynamics of graphene buffer layer formation on ultra-smooth SiC(0001) surfaces

Abstract: In this study the growth process of epitaxial graphene on SiC was investigated systematically. The transition from the initial buffer layer growth to the formation of the first monolayer graphene domains was investigated by various techniques: atomic force microscopy, low energy electron diffraction, low energy electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, scanning tunneling spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The data show that the buffer layer formation goes along with a simultaneous SiC decomposition which takes place as a rapid step retraction of one specific type of SiC bilayer in good agreement with the step retraction model. Once the buffer layer coverage is completed, the resulting characteristic regular repeating terrace and step height pattern of one and two SiC bilayers turned out to be very stable against further SiC decomposition. The following initial growth of monolayer graphene domains occurs, interestingly, only along the two bilayer high terrace edges. This behavior is explained by a preferential SiC decomposition at the higher step edges and it has some potential for spatial graphene growth control. The corresponding earlier graphene growth on one terrace type can explain the different scanning tunneling spectroscopy nanoscale resistivities on these terraces.

Title: Kelvin waves in nonequilibrium universal dynamics of relativistic scalar field theories
Authors: Viktoria Noel, Thomas Gasenzer, Kirill Boguslavski
Abstract: We investigate the different degrees of freedom underlying far-from-equilibrium scaling behaviour in a relativistic, single-component $\mathrm{O}(1)$ scalar field theory in two and three spatial dimensions. In such a strongly correlated many-body system, identifying the respective roles of nonlinear wave excitations and defect dynamics is a prerequisite for understanding the universal character of time evolution far from equilibrium and thus the different possible universality classes of nonthermal fixed points. Using unequal-time two-point correlation functions, we extract information about the dominant infrared excitations and study their connections to the turbulent dynamics of topological defects created in the system. In three dimensions, the primary excitations are identified as kelvon quasiparticles, which are quantised Kelvin waves propagating along vortex lines, while in two dimensions, vortices are point defects, and the infrared dynamics is dominated by bound-state like excitations similar to Kelvin waves. In both cases, the kelvon excitations are found to be characterised by distinct time-evolving dispersion relations, subject to the coarsening dynamics close to the respective nonthermal fixed point and, thus, to the decay of superfluid turbulence in the system. Our results underline the role of topological defects and their influence on the universal dynamics of strongly correlated systems near nonthermal fixed points, complementing the analysis of large-$N$ models in $\mathrm{O}(N)$ systems.

Title: The Coherent Forward Scattering peak: a probe of non-ergodicity and symmetries in a quantum chaotic system

Abstract: The Coherent Backscattering (CBS) peak is a well-known interferential signature of weak localization in disordered or chaotic systems. Recently, it was realized that another interferential peak, the Coherent Forward Scattering (CFS) peak, emerges in the presence of strong localization. This peak has never been observed directly to date. We report the first direct observation of the CFS peak and demonstrate its dual role as signature of non-ergodicity and as probe of symmetries in quantum chaotic systems. Using a shaken rotor model realized with a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of ultracold atoms in a modulated optical lattice, we investigate dynamical localization in momentum space. The CFS peak emerges in the position distribution as a consequence of non-ergodic dynamics, while its growth timescale depends critically on the localization scale. By finely tuning the modulation, we control the symmetries of the dynamics (time-reversal and parity) and measure their impact on both CFS and CBS peaks. Our results highlight the strong link of CFS and its temporal growth with symmetry and localization properties, establishing CFS as a robust quantitative marker of non-ergodicity. This work opens new avenues for characterizing non-ergodicity and symmetries in quantum chaotic or disordered systems, with possible applications in many-body localization and many-body chaos.

Title: Negative exchange interaction in Si quantum dot arrays via valley-phase induced $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field
Authors: Benjamin D. Woods
Abstract: The exchange interaction $J$ offers a powerful tool for quantum computation based on semiconductor spin qubits. However, the exchange interaction in two-electron systems in the absence of a magnetic field is usually constrained to be non-negative $J \geq 0$, which inhibits the construction of various dynamically corrected exchange-based gates. In this work, we show that negative exchange $J < 0$ can be realized in two-electron Si quantum dot arrays in the absence of a magnetic field due to the presence of the valley degree of freedom. Here, valley phase differences between dots produce a non-trivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field in the low-energy effective theory, which in turn can lead to a negative exchange interaction. In addition, we show that this $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field can break Nagaoka ferromagnetism and be engineered by altering the occupancy of the dot array. Therefore, our work uncovers new tools for exchange-based quantum computing and a novel setting for studying quantum magnetism.

Title: A projected complex Langevin sampling method for bosons in the canonical and microcanonical ensembles
Authors: Ethan C. McGarrigle, Hector D. Ceniceros, Glenn H. Fredrickson
Abstract: We introduce a projected complex Langevin (CL) numerical sampling method -- a fictitious Langevin dynamics scheme that uses numerical projection to sample a constrained stationary distribution with highly oscillatory character. Despite the complex-valued degrees of freedom and associated sign-problem, the projected CL method succeeds as a natural extension of real-valued projected Langevin processes. In the new proposed method, complex-valued Lagrange multipliers are determined to enforce constraints to machine precision at each iteration. To illustrate the efficacy of this approach, we adapt the projected CL method to sample coherent state quantum field theories describing interacting Bose gases, which are realized in modern cold-atom experiments. We apply projected CL to two scenarios with holomorphic constraints, the canonical and microcanonical ensembles, and show that projected CL reproduces the correct thermodynamic observables. We further observe improved numerical stability and accuracy at larger timesteps when compared to the previous state-of-the-art method for performing constrained CL sampling.

Title: Intrinsic exciton transport and recombination in single-crystal lead bromide perovskite
Authors: Zhixuan Bi, Yunfei Bai, Ying Shi, Tao Sun, Heng Wu, Haochen Zhang, Yubin Wang, Miao-Ling Lin, Yaxian Wang, Ping-Heng Tan, Sheng Meng, Qihua Xiong, Luyi Yang
Abstract: Photogenerated carrier transport and recombination in metal halide perovskites are critical to device performance. Despite considerable efforts, sample quality issues and measurement techniques have limited the access to their intrinsic physics. Here, by utilizing high-purity CsPbBr3 single crystals and contact-free transient grating spectroscopy, we directly monitor exciton diffusive transport from 26 to 300 K. As the temperature (T) increases, the carrier mobility ({\mu}) decreases rapidly below 100 K wtih a {\mu}~T^{-3.0} scaling, and then follows a more gradual {\mu}~T^{-1.7} trend at higher temperatures. First-principles calculations perfectly reproduce this experimental trend and reveal that optical phonon scattering governs carrier mobility shifts over the entire temperature range, with a single longitudinal optical mode dominating room-temperature transport. Time-resolved photoluminescence further identifies a substantial increase in exciton radiative lifetime with temperature, attributed to increased exciton population in momentum-dark states caused by phonon scattering. Our findings unambiguously resolve previous theory-experiment discrepancies, providing benchmarks for future optoelectronic design.

Title: $\mathbb{Z}_2$-gauging and self-dualities of the $XX$ model and its cousins
Authors: Lei Su
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the one-dimensional $XX$ lattice model and its cousins through the lens of momentum and winding $U(1)$ symmetries. We distinguish two closely related $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries based on their relation to the $U(1)$ symmetries, and establish a web of $\mathbb{Z}_2$-gauging relations among these models, rooted in two fundamental seeds: the $ XY \pm YX$ models. These two seeds, each self-dual under gauging of the respective $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetries, possess manifestly symmetric conserved charges, making transparent the connection between the noninvertible symmetries and the Kramers-Wannier duality. By leveraging the self-dualities of these two seed models, we derive the self-dualities of their cousins, including the $XX$ model and the Levin-Gu model, through appropriate gauging procedures. Moreover, under these gauging schemes, the lattice T-duality matrices take the form of the identity matrix. Finally, we unify the mapping structures of local conserved charges across these models, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding their symmetries and dualities.

Title: Impact of charge transfer excitons on unidirectional exciton transport in lateral TMD heterostructures
Authors: Roberto Rosati, Sai Shradha, Julian Picker, Andrey Turchanin, Bernhard Urbaszek, Ermin Malic
Abstract: Lateral heterostructures built of monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are characterized by a thin 1D interface exhibiting a large energy offset. Recently, the formation of spatially separated charge-transfer (CT) excitons at the interface has been demonstrated. The technologically important exciton propagation across the interface and the impact of CT excitons has remained in the dark so far. In this work, we microscopically investigate the spatiotemporal exciton dynamics in the exemplary hBN-encapsulated WSe$_2$-MoSe$_2$ lateral heterostructure and reveal a highly interesting interplay of energy offset-driven unidirectional exciton drift across the interface and efficient capture into energetically lower CT excitons at the interface. This interplay triggers a counterintuitive thermal control of exciton transport with a less efficient propagation at lower temperatures - opposite to the behavior in conventional semiconductors. We predict clear signatures of this intriguing exciton propagation both in far- and near-field photoluminescence experiments. Our results present an important step toward a microscopic understanding of the technologically relevant unidirectional exciton transport in lateral heterostructures.

Title: The "double" square-root law: Evidence for the mechanical origin of market impact using Tokyo Stock Exchange data
Authors: Guillaume Maitrier, Grégoire Loeper, Kiyoshi Kanazawa, Jean-Philippe Bouchaud
Abstract: Understanding the impact of trades on prices is a crucial question for both academic research and industry practice. It is well established that impact follows a square-root impact as a function of traded volume. However, the microscopic origin of such a law remains elusive: empirical studies are particularly challenging due to the anonymity of orders in public data. Indeed, there is ongoing debate about whether price impact has a mechanical origin or whether it is primarily driven by information, as suggested by many economic theories. In this paper, we revisit this question using a very detailed dataset provided by the Japanese stock exchange, containing the trader IDs for all orders sent to the exchange between 2012 and 2018. Our central result is that such a law has in fact microscopic roots and applies already at the level of single child orders, provided one waits long enough for the market to "digest" them. The mesoscopic impact of metaorders arises from a "double" square-root effect: square-root in volume of individual impact, followed by an inverse square-root decay as a function of time. Since market orders are anonymous, we expect and indeed find that these results apply to any market orders, and the impact of synthetic metaorders, reconstructed by scrambling the identity of the issuers, is described by the very same square-root impact law. We conclude that price impact is essentially mechanical, at odds with theories that emphasize the information content of such trades to explain the square-root impact law.

Title: Time-Irreversible Quantum-Classical Dynamics of Molecular Models in the Brain
Authors: Alessandro Sergi, Antonino Messina, Rosalba Saija, Gabriella Martino, Maria Teresa Caccamo, Min-Fang Kuo, Michael A. Nitsche
Abstract: This manuscript aims to illustrate a quantum-classical dissipative theory (suited to be converted to effective algorithms for numerical simulations) within the long-term project of studying molecular processes in the brain. Other approaches, briefly sketched in the text, have advocated the need to deal with both quantum and classical dynamic variables when studying the brain. At variance with these other frameworks, the manuscript's formalism allows us to explicitly treat the classical dynamical variables. The theory must be dissipative not because of formal requirements but because brain processes appear to be dissipative at the molecular, physiological, and high functional levels. We discuss theoretically that using Brownian dynamics or the Nosè-Hoover-Chain thermostat to perform computer simulations provides an effective way to introduce an arrow of time for open quantum systems in a classical environment. In the future, We plan to study classical models of neurons and astrocytes, as well as their networks, coupled to quantum dynamical variables describing, e.g., nuclear and electron spins, HOMO and LUMO orbitals of phenyl and indole rings, ion channels, and tunneling protons.

Title: Invariant Tokenization of Crystalline Materials for Language Model Enabled Generation
Authors: Keqiang Yan, Xiner Li, Hongyi Ling, Kenna Ashen, Carl Edwards, Raymundo Arróyave, Marinka Zitnik, Heng Ji, Xiaofeng Qian, Xiaoning Qian, Shuiwang Ji
Abstract: We consider the problem of crystal materials generation using language models (LMs). A key step is to convert 3D crystal structures into 1D sequences to be processed by LMs. Prior studies used the crystallographic information framework (CIF) file stream, which fails to ensure SE(3) and periodic invariance and may not lead to unique sequence representations for a given crystal structure. Here, we propose a novel method, known as Mat2Seq, to tackle this challenge. Mat2Seq converts 3D crystal structures into 1D sequences and ensures that different mathematical descriptions of the same crystal are represented in a single unique sequence, thereby provably achieving SE(3) and periodic invariance. Experimental results show that, with language models, Mat2Seq achieves promising performance in crystal structure generation as compared with prior methods.

Title: Determination of Mid-Infrared Refractive Indices of Superconducting Thin Films Using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
Authors: Dip Joti Paul, Tony X. Zhou, Karl K. Berggren
Abstract: In this work, we present a technique to determine the mid-infrared refractive indices of thin superconducting films using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). In particular, we performed FTIR transmission and reflection measurements on 10-nm-thick NbN and 15-nm-thick MoSi films in the wavelength range of 2.5 to 25 $\mu$m, corresponding to frequencies of 12-120 THz or photon energies of 50-500 meV. To extract the mid-infrared refractive indices of the thin films from FTIR measurements, we used the Drude-Lorentz oscillator model to represent the dielectric functions of the films and implemented an optimization algorithm to fit these oscillator parameters, minimizing the error between the measured FTIR spectra and the simulated spectra calculated using the dielectric functions of the films. To evaluate the consistency of the extracted dielectric functions, we compared the refractive index values extrapolated from these dielectric functions in the UV to near-infrared wavelengths with the values separately measured using spectroscopic ellipsometry. For further validation, we calculated the sheet resistance of the films from their extracted Drude oscillator parameters and compared with the experimental values. This FTIR-based refractive index measurement approach can be extended to measure the refractive indices of thin films at wavelengths beyond 25 $\mu$m, which will be useful for designing highly efficient photon detectors and photonic devices with enhanced optical absorption in the mid- and far-infrared wavelengths.

Title: Observation and mitigation of microwave echoes from dielectric defects in Josephson traveling wave amplifiers
Authors: Matteo Boselli, Joel Grebel, Ambroise Peugeot, Rémy Dassonneville, Benjamin Huard, Audrey Bienfait
Abstract: Amplifying microwave signals with a noise close to the minimum imposed by quantum mechanics is now routinely performed with superconducting quantum devices. In particular, Josephson-based Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifiers (JTWPA) have shown record bandwidth with added noise close to the quantum limit. In this work, we report the appearance of echo signals emitted by JTWPAs driven by trains of high-power pulses exceeding their dynamical range. we explore the case of weak signals generated through high power pulses. By sending a train of such high-power pulses, beyond the 1 dB compression point of such amplifiers, we observe the appearance of echoes, solely due to the JTWPA. These echoes have micro-second coherence and we attribute their origin to microscopic defects in the amplifier dielectric layer. By analyzing the power and the coherence of the echo signal as a function of temperature, we estimate the dielectric loss brought by these defects, and their impact on the JTWPA quantum efficiency. We introduce a mitigation technique (BLAST) to prevent the appearance of these echoes, consisting in an additional high-power tone sent concurrently with each pulse. We demonstrate that it suppresses the spurious defect signals and we recover the typical gain and noise figure within 95% of their low-power values in 300 ns. These results can help to extend the use of JTWPAs in experiments where fast high-power sequences are necessary to generate weak microwave responses from the system under study, and also provide a path towards characterizing in-situ the dielectric losses of these devices.

Title: Survival of the fastest -- algorithm-guided evolution of light-powered underwater microrobots
Authors: Mikołaj Rogóż, Zofia Dziekan, Piotr Wasylczyk
Abstract: Depending on environmental conditions, lightweight soft robots can exhibit various modes of locomotion that are difficult to model. As a result, optimizing their performance is complex, especially in small-scale systems characterized by low Reynolds numbers, when multiple aero- and hydrodynamical processes influence their movement. In this work, we study underwater swimmer locomotion by applying experimental results as the fitness function in two evolutionary algorithms: particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithm. Since soft, light-powered robots with different characteristics (phenotypes) can be fabricated quickly, they provide a great platform for optimisation experiments, using physical robots competing to improve swimming speed over consecutive generations. Interestingly, just like in natural evolution, unexpected gene combinations led to surprisingly good results, including several hundred percent increase in speed or the discovery of a self-oscillating underwater locomotion mode.

Title: Characterizing dynamical behaviors in topological open systems with boundary dissipations
Authors: Zhen-Yu Zheng, Xueliang Wang, Shu Chen
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with boundary dissipations described by Lindblad master equations and unravel distinct dynamical features in the topologically different phases of the underlying Hamiltonian. By examining the long-time damping dynamics, we uncover a dynamical duality phenomenon between the weak and strong dissipation region, which exists only in the topologically non-trivial phase, linked to the structure of the Liouvillian spectra,particularly the stripe closest to the steady state. When dissipation is confined to a single boundary, the dynamical duality phenomenon still exists. Under this condition, the Liouvillian gap fulfills an exponential size scaling relation in the topologically non-trivial phase and a power-law size scaling relation in the topologically trivial phase. Within the topologically non-trivial region, we identify the existence of boundary-localized dark states in the thermodynamical limit, which is responsible for the exponential size decay of Liouvillian gap.

Title: Entanglement transition and suppression of critical phase of thermofield double state in monitored quantum circuit with unitary $R$ matrix gates
Authors: Shi-Kang Sun, Shu Chen
Abstract: We study quantum circuits with gates composed randomly of identity operators, projectors, or a kind of $R$ matrices which satisfy the Yang-Baxter equation and are unitary and dual-unitary. This enables us to translate the quantum circuit into a topological object with distinguished overcrossings and undercrossings. The circuit corresponds to a classical loop model when an overcrossings and undercrossing coincides. The entanglement entropy between the final state and initial state is given by the spanning number of the classical model, and they share the same phase diagram. Whenever an overcrossing and undercrossing differ, the circuit extends beyond the classical model. Considering a specific case with $R$ matrices randomly replaced by swap gates, we demonstrate that the topological effect dominates, and only the area-law phase remains in the thermodynamic limit, regardless of how small the replacement probability is. We also find evidence of an altered phase diagram for non-Clifford cases.

Title: Rapid morphology characterization of two-dimensional TMDs and lateral heterostructures based on deep learning
Authors: Junqi He, Yujie Zhang, Jialu Wang, Tao Wang, Pan Zhang, Chengjie Cai, Jinxing Yang, Xiao Lin, Xiaohui Yang
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials and heterostructures exhibit unique physical properties, necessitating efficient and accurate characterization methods. Leveraging advancements in artificial intelligence, we introduce a deep learning-based method for efficiently characterizing heterostructures and 2D materials, specifically MoS2-MoSe2 lateral heterostructures and MoS2 flakes with varying shapes and thicknesses. By utilizing YOLO models, we achieve an accuracy rate of over 94.67% in identifying these materials. Additionally, we explore the application of transfer learning across different materials, which further enhances model performance. This model exhibits robust generalization and anti-interference ability, ensuring reliable results in diverse scenarios. To facilitate practical use, we have developed an application that enables real-time analysis directly from optical microscope images, making the process significantly faster and more cost-effective than traditional methods. This deep learning-driven approach represents a promising tool for the rapid and accurate characterization of 2D materials, opening new avenues for research and development in material science.

Title: Generating Generalised Ground-State Ansatzes from Few-Body Examples
Authors: Matt Lourens, Ilya Sinayskiy, Johannes N. Kriel, Francesco Petruccione
Abstract: We introduce a method that generates ground state ansatzes for quantum many-body systems which are both analytically tractable and accurate over wide parameter regimes. Our approach leverages a custom symbolic language to construct tensor network states (TNS) via an evolutionary algorithm. This language provides operations that allow the generated TNS to automatically scale with system size. Consequently, we can evaluate ansatz fitness for small systems, which is computationally efficient, while favouring structures that continue to perform well with increasing system size. This ensures that the ansatz captures robust features of the ground state structure. Remarkably, we find analytically tractable ansatzes with a degree of universality, which encode correlations, capture finite-size effects, accurately predict ground state energies, and offer a good description of critical phenomena. We demonstrate this method on the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model (LMG) and the quantum transverse-field Ising model (TFIM), where the same ansatz was independently generated for both. The simple structure of the ansatz allows us to restore broken symmetries and obtain exact expressions for local observables and correlation functions. We also point out an interesting connection between this ansatz and a well-studied sequence in analytical number theory and the one-dimensional classical Ising model.

Title: Periodic Materials Generation using Text-Guided Joint Diffusion Model
Authors: Kishalay Das, Subhojyoti Khastagir, Pawan Goyal, Seung-Cheol Lee, Satadeep Bhattacharjee, Niloy Ganguly
Abstract: Equivariant diffusion models have emerged as the prevailing approach for generating novel crystal materials due to their ability to leverage the physical symmetries of periodic material structures. However, current models do not effectively learn the joint distribution of atom types, fractional coordinates, and lattice structure of the crystal material in a cohesive end-to-end diffusion framework. Also, none of these models work under realistic setups, where users specify the desired characteristics that the generated structures must match. In this work, we introduce TGDMat, a novel text-guided diffusion model designed for 3D periodic material generation. Our approach integrates global structural knowledge through textual descriptions at each denoising step while jointly generating atom coordinates, types, and lattice structure using a periodic-E(3)-equivariant graph neural network (GNN). Extensive experiments using popular datasets on benchmark tasks reveal that TGDMat outperforms existing baseline methods by a good margin. Notably, for the structure prediction task, with just one generated sample, TGDMat outperforms all baseline models, highlighting the importance of text-guided diffusion. Further, in the generation task, TGDMat surpasses all baselines and their text-fusion variants, showcasing the effectiveness of the joint diffusion paradigm. Additionally, incorporating textual knowledge reduces overall training and sampling computational overhead while enhancing generative performance when utilizing real-world textual prompts from experts.

Title: Quantum Lamb model
Authors: Dennis P. Clougherty, Nam H. Dinh
Abstract: H. Lamb considered the classical dynamics of a vibrating particle embedded in an elastic medium before the development of quantum theory. Lamb was interested in how the back-action of the elastic waves generated can damp the vibrations of the particle. We propose a quantum version of Lamb's model. We show that this model is exactly solvable by using a multimode Bogoliubov transformation. We show that the exact system ground state is a multimode squeezed vacuum state, and we obtain the exact Bogoliubov frequencies by numerically solving a nonlinear integral equation. A closed-form expression for the damping rate of the particle is obtained, and we find that it agrees with the result obtained by perturbation theory for coupling strength below a critical value. The model is found to break down for coupling strength above the critical value where the lowest Bogoliubov frequency vanishes. We show that the addition of an anharmonic elastic term is sufficient to stabilize the system in this strong coupling regime.

Title: Compactfying Electronic Wavefunctions I: Error-Mitigated Transcorrelated DMRG
Authors: Bruna G. M. Araújo, Antonio M S Macedo
Abstract: Transcorrelation (TC) techniques effectively enhance convergence rates in strongly correlated fermionic systems by embedding electron-electron cusp into the Jastrow factor of similarity transformations, yielding a non-Hermitian, yet iso-spectral, Hamiltonian. This non-Hermitian nature introduces significant challenges for variational methods such as the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG). To address these, existing approaches often rely on computationally expensive methods prone to errors, such as imaginary-time evolution. We introduce an Error-Mitigated Transcorrelated DMRG (EMTC-DMRG), a classical variational algorithm that overcomes these challenges by integrating existing techniques to achieve superior accuracy and efficiency. Key features of our algorithm include: (a) an analytical formulation of the transcorrelated Fermi-Hubbard Hamiltonian; (b) a numerically exact, uncompressed Matrix Product Operator (MPO) representation developed via symbolic optimization and the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm; and (c) a time-independent DMRG with a two-site sweep algorithm; (d) we use Davidson solver even for a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Our method significantly enhances computational efficiency and accuracy in determining ground-state energies for the two-dimensional transcorrelated Fermi-Hubbard model with periodic boundary conditions. Additionally, it can be adapted to compute both ground and excited states in molecular systems.

Title: Stress, Strain, or Displacement? A Novel Machine Learning Based Framework to Predict Mixed Mode I/II Fracture Toughness
Authors: Amir Mohammad Mirzaei
Abstract: Accurate prediction of fracture toughness under complex loading conditions, like mixed mode I/II, is essential for reliable failure assessment. This paper aims to develop a machine learning framework for predicting fracture toughness and crack initiation angles by directly utilizing stress, strain, or displacement distributions represented by selected nodes as input features. Validation is conducted using experimental data across various mode mixities and specimen geometries for brittle materials. Among stress, strain, and displacement fields, it is shown that the stress-based features, when paired with Multilayer Perceptron models, achieve high predictive accuracy with R2 scores exceeding 0.86 for fracture load predictions and 0.94 for angle predictions. A comparison with the Theory of Critical Distances (Generalized Maximum Tangential Stress) demonstrates the high accuracy of the framework. Furthermore, the impact of input parameter selections is studied, and it is demonstrated that advanced feature selection algorithms enable the framework to handle different ranges and densities of the representing field. The framework's performance was further validated for datasets with a limited number of data points and restricted mode mixities, where it maintained high accuracy. The proposed framework is computationally efficient and practical, and it operates without any supplementary post-processing steps, such as stress intensity factor calculations.

Title: Impact of Fasteners on the Radar Cross-Section performance of Radar Absorbing Air Intake Duct
Authors: Vijay Kumar Sutrakar, Anjana P K
Abstract: An aircraft consists of various cavities including air intake ducts, cockpit, radome, inlet and exhaust of heat exchangers, passage for engine bay/other bay cooling etc. These cavities are prime radar cross-section (RCS) contributors of aircraft. The major such cavity is air intake duct, and it contributes significantly to frontal sector RCS of an aircraft. The RCS reductions of air intake duct is very important to achieve a low RCS (or stealthy) aircraft configuration. In general, radar absorbing materials (RAM) are getting utilized for RCS reduction of air intake duct. It can also be noticed that a large number of fasteners are used for integration of air intake duct with the aircraft structures. The installation of fasteners on RAS may lead to degradation of RCS performance of air intake. However, no such studies are reported in the literature on the impact of rivets on the RCS performance of RAS air intake duct. In this paper, radar absorbing material of thickness 6.25 mm is designed which givens more than -10 dB reflection loss from 4 to 18GHz of frequencies. Next, the effect of rivet installation on these RAS is carried out using three different rivet configurations. The RCS performance of RAS is evaluated for duct of different lengths from 1 to 18GHz of frequencies. In order to see the RCS performance, five different air intake cases are considered The RCS performance with increase in percentage surface area of rivet heads to RAS is reported in detail. At the last, an open-source aircraft CAD model is considered and the RCS performance of RAS air intake with and without rivets is evaluated.

Title: Longitudinal conductivity at integer quantum Hall transitions
Authors: Giovanna Marcelli, Lorenzo Pigozzi, Marcello Porta
Abstract: We compute the longitudinal conductivity for a wide class of two-dimensional tight-binding models, whose Hamiltonian displays conical intersections of the Bloch bands at the Fermi level. Our setting allows to consider generic transitions between quantum Hall phases. We obtain an explicit expression for the longitudinal conductivity, completely determined by the number of conical intersections and by the shape of the cones. In particular, the formula reproduces the known quantized values obtained for graphene and for the critical Haldane model.

Title: Ballistic electron transport described by a fourth order Schrödinger equation
Authors: Giulia Elena Aliffi, Giovanni Nastasi, Vittorio Romano
Abstract: A fourth order Schrödinger equation for the description of charge transport in semiconductors in the ballistic regime is proposed with the inclusion of non parabolic effects in the dispersion relation in order to go beyond the simple effective mass approximation. Similarly to the standard (second order) Schrödinger equation, the problem is reduced to a finite spatial domain with appropriate transparent boundary conditions to simulate charge transport in a quantum coupler, where an active region representing an electron device is coupled to leads which take the role of reservoirs. Some analytical properties are investigated and a generalized formula for the current is obtained. Numerical results show the main features of the solutions of the new model. In particular, an effect of interference appears due to a richer wave structure than that arising for the Schrödinger equation in the effective mass approximation.

Title: Capping agent control over the physicochemical and antibacterial properties of ZnO nanoparticles
Authors: David Rutherford, Marketa Slapal Barinkova, Thaiskang Jamatia, Pavol Suly, Martin Cvek, Bohuslav Rezek
Abstract: Life science research has largely benefited from the use of nanoparticles (NPs), yet fundamental issues such as colloidal stability and control over NP size and shape affect NP properties and functions in biomedical applications. Here we show that including capping agents directly into zinc oxide (ZnO) NP synthesis can lead to better control of these properties and their enhanced functionality. A systematic study of the influence capping agents has on the physicochemical and antibacterial properties of ZnO NP synthesized using the microwave (MW)-assisted polyol method is presented. Primary NP size (10-20 nm) was controlled by zinc precursor concentration, and NP shape was influenced by capping agent type. Capping agents enabled control over the surface charge and water interaction properties of ZnO for further investigations involving bacteria. The superior antibacterial effect was observed using positively charged, hydrophilic HMTA-capped ZnO, yet negatively charged hydrophobic OA-capped ZnO still exhibited an antibacterial effect. These observations suggest different underlying mechanisms, and we discuss these differences with particular reference to the specific surface area of ZnO, and how this is key to bacteria-nanoparticle interactions. Appropriate selection of capping agents is crucial for the synthesis of potent ZnO NPs intended for antibacterial applications, specifically for combating resistance.

Title: Poromechanical modelling of responsive hydrogel pumps
Authors: Joseph J. Webber, Thomas D. Montenegro-Johnson
Abstract: Thermo-responsive hydrogels are smart materials that rapidly switch between hydrophilic (swollen) and hydrophobic (shrunken) states when heated past a threshold temperature, resulting in order-of-magnitude changes in gel volume. Modelling the dynamics of this switch is notoriously difficult, and typically involves fitting a large number of microscopic material parameters to experimental data. In this paper, we present and validate an intuitive, macroscopic description of responsive gel dynamics and use it to explore the shrinking, swelling and pumping of responsive hydrogel displacement pumps for microfluidic devices. We finish with a discussion on how such tubular structures may be used to speed up the response times of larger hydrogel smart actuators and unlock new possibilities for dynamic shape change.

Title: Limit theorems and lack thereof for a multilayer random walk mimicking human mobility
Authors: Alessandra Bianchi, Marco Lenci, Françoise Pène
Abstract: We introduce a continuous-time random walk model on an infinite multilayer structure inspired by transportation networks. Each layer is a copy of $\mathbb{R}^d$, indexed by a non-negative integer. A walker moves within a layer by means of an inertial displacement whose speed is a deterministic function of the layer index and whose direction and duration are random, but with a timescale that depends on the layer. After each inertial displacement, the walker may randomly shift level, up or down, independently of its past. The multilayer structure is hierarchical, in the sense that the speed is a nondecreasing function of the layer index. Our primary focus is on the diffusive properties of the system. Under a natural condition on the parameters of the model, we establish a functional central limit theorem for the $\mathbb{R}^d$-coordinate of the process. By contrast, in a class of examples where this condition is violated, we are able to determine the correct scaling of the process while proving that no limit theorem holds.

Title: Topology of the simplest gene switch
Authors: Aleksandra Nelson, Peter Wolynes, Evelyn Tang
Abstract: Complex gene regulatory networks often display emergent simple behavior. Sometimes this simplicity can be traced to a nearly equivalent energy landscape, but not always. Here we show how topological theory for stochastic and biochemical networks can predict phase transitions between dynamical regimes, where the simplest landscape paradigm fails. We demonstrate the utility of this topological approach for a simple gene network, revealing a new oscillatory regime in addition to previously recognized bistable and monostable phases. We show how local winding numbers predict the steady-state locations in the bistable and monostable phases, and a flux analysis predicts the respective strengths of steady-state peaks.

Title: When Can You Get Away with Low Memory Adam?
Authors: Dayal Singh Kalra, John Kirchenbauer, Maissam Barkeshli, Tom Goldstein
Abstract: Adam is the go-to optimizer for training modern machine learning models, but it requires additional memory to maintain the moving averages of the gradients and their squares. While various low-memory optimizers have been proposed that sometimes match the performance of Adam, their lack of reliability has left Adam as the default choice. In this work, we apply a simple layer-wise Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) analysis to quantify when second-moment tensors can be effectively replaced by their means across different dimensions. Our SNR analysis reveals how architecture, training hyperparameters, and dataset properties impact compressibility along Adam's trajectory, naturally leading to $\textit{SlimAdam}$, a memory-efficient Adam variant. $\textit{SlimAdam}$ compresses the second moments along dimensions with high SNR when feasible, and leaves when compression would be detrimental. Through experiments across a diverse set of architectures and training scenarios, we show that $\textit{SlimAdam}$ matches Adam's performance and stability while saving up to $98\%$ of total second moments. Code for $\textit{SlimAdam}$ is available at this https URL.

Title: Eigenstate thermalization in spin-1/2 systems with SU(2) symmetry
Authors: Rohit Patil, Marcos Rigol
Abstract: We study the diagonal and off-diagonal matrix elements of observables in the eigenstates of the extended spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain, which exhibits the non-Abelian SU(2) symmetry. We explore integrable and nonintegrable regimes, and consider observables that preserve the SU(2) symmetry of the Hamiltonian as well as observables that break it. We study in detail the low-frequency behavior of the off-diagonal matrix elements at and away from integrability. In the nonintegrable regime, we test the non-Abelian eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, paying special attention to the effect of the spin, which is the novel conserved quantity introduced by the SU(2) symmetry.

Title: Surface Morphology Assisted Trapping of Strongly Coupled Electron-on-Neon Charge States
Authors: Kaiwen Zheng, Xingrui Song, Kater W. Murch
Abstract: Single electrons confined to a free neon surface and manipulated through the circuit quantum electrodynamics (circuit QED) architecture is a promising novel quantum computing platform. Understanding the exact physical nature of the electron-on-neon (eNe) charge states is important for realizing this platform's potential for quantum technologies. We investigate how resonator trench depth and substrate surface properties influence the formation of eNe charge states and their coupling to microwave resonators. Through experimental observation supported by modeling, we find that shallow-depth etching of the resonator features maximizes coupling strength. By comparing the trapping statistics and surface morphology of devices with altered trench roughness, our work reveals the role of fabrication-induced surface features in the formation of strongly coupled eNe states.

Title: Light-induced anomalous Hall conductivity in massive 3D Dirac semimetal Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$
Authors: Naotaka Yoshikawa, Shun Okumura, Yoshua Hirai, Kazuma Ogawa, Kohei Fujiwara, Junya Ikeda, Akihiro Ozawa, Takashi Koretsune, Ryotaro Arita, Aditi Mitra, Atsushi Tsukazaki, Takashi Oka, Ryo Shimano
Abstract: Weyl semimetals can emerge from Dirac semimetals when the time-reversal or spatial-inversion symmetries are broken. Recently, it has been proposed based on the Floquet theory that Dirac semimetals can be converted into Weyl semimetals even by shining circularly polarized light (CPL). Here we have investigated the possibility of such a Dirac-Weyl conversion by measuring the CPL-induced anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) in a massive 3D Dirac semimetal Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ in the paramagnetic phase using ultrafast mid-infrared pump-terahertz Faraday rotation probe spectroscopy. We find that the field-strength and driving frequency dependence of the observed AHC is well accounted for by CPL-induced nonzero Berry curvature associated with the splitting of the Dirac bands as predicted by the Floquet theory. The estimated splitting of the Dirac bands reaches about 60 % of the mass gap and the calculated CPL-induced AHC quantitatively reproduces the experimental observation, demonstrating a promising route toward the realization of Floquet-Weyl states from massive Dirac semimetals.

Title: Ab-initio study of phononic thermal conduction in ScAgC half-Heusler
Authors: Vinod Kumar Solet, Sudhir Kumar Pandey
Abstract: We present a first-principles lattice calculations to comprehend the thermal expansion $\alpha(T)$ and lattice thermal conductivity $\kappa_{ph}$ of ScAgC. The obtained positive frequencies of phonon dispersion shows the dynamical stability of ScAgC in FCC structure. The estimated $\alpha(T)$ from quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA) at 300(1200) K is $\sim$4(4.6)$\times$$10^{-6}$ K$^{-1}$. The predicted value of total $\kappa_{ph}$ from phonon-phonon interaction (PPI) at 300(1200) K is $\sim$7.4(1.8) Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$. The highest group velocity for acoustic $\&$ optical branches (AB $\&$ OB) is $\sim$6.7 and $\sim$3.5 km/s, respectively. The predicted average phonon lifetime ($\tau_{\lambda}$) for AB(OB) is $\sim$2.5(1.65) ps at 300 K, whereas it is $\sim$0.6(0.4) ps at 1200 K. The estimated highest heat capacity ($C_{\lambda}$) at 200 K for AB(OB) is $\sim$23.5 (19.5) meV/K. We fitted the equation $A_{\kappa}$T$^{-x_{\kappa}}$($A_{\tau}$T$^{-x_{\tau}}$) in the $\kappa_{ph}$($\tau_{\lambda}$) curve to gain a thorough understanding of temperature-dependent $\kappa_{ph}$ trend. The $x_{\kappa}$ for total branches is calculated to be $\sim$1.02. The $x_{\tau}$ value due to total AB(OB) is estimated to be $\sim$1.04(1.02), while it is $\sim$1.03 for total branches. The calculated $x_{\kappa}$ for total AB(OB) is $\sim$1.04(0.95), implying that AB contributes more to the total $\kappa_{ph}$. This research could be important for enhancing the properties of ScAgC regarding thermoelectric and photovoltaic applications.

Title: Nonlinear breathers with crystalline symmetries
Authors: Frank Schindler, Vir B. Bulchandani, Wladimir A. Benalcazar
Abstract: Nonlinear lattice models can support "discrete breather" excitations that stay localized in space for all time. By contrast, the localized Wannier states of linear lattice models are dynamically unstable. Nevertheless, symmetric and exponentially localized Wannier states are a central tool in the classification of band structures with crystalline symmetries. Moreover, the quantized transport observed in nonlinear Thouless pumps relies on the fact that -- at least in a specific model -- discrete breathers recover Wannier states in the limit of vanishing nonlinearity. Motivated by these observations, we investigate the correspondence between nonlinear breathers and exponentially localised Wannier states for a family of discrete nonlinear Schrödinger equations with crystalline symmetries. We develop a formalism to analytically predict the breathers' spectrum, center of mass and symmetry data, and apply this to nonlinear generalizations of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain and the breathing kagome lattice.

Title: Integration of graphene-based superconducting quantum circuits in 3D cavity
Authors: Kuei-Lin Chiu, Youyi Chang, Avishma J. Lasrado, Cheng-Han Lo, Yung-Hsiang Chen, Tao-Yi Hsu, Yen-Chih Chen, Yi-Chen Tsai, Samina, Yen-Hsiang Lin, Chung-Ting Ke
Abstract: Integrating 2D materials into circuit quantum electrodynamics (c-QED) devices is an emerging filed in recent years. This integration not only facilitates the exploration of potential applications in quantum information processing but also enables the study of material's fundamental properties using microwave techniques. While most studies employ 2D coplanar architectures with scalability potential, 3D cavity based c-QED devices, due to their simpler design, offer the advantage of a quicker turnaround to probe the composite Josephson junctions (JJs). Here, we construct the first flux-tunable, 3D cavity-compatible superconducting quantum circuit based on 2D materials, featuring a graphene superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) shunted by a capacitor that is accessible by both DC and microwave probes. We have shown how flux-modulated cavity frequency can be linked to the SQUID critical current under the influence of Fraunhofer pattern. In addition, we extracted the symmetry information of the SQUIDs based on DC analysis, and correlated this with the flux-modulated cavity frequency observed in microwave measurements. Our platform can extend to topological materials, holding the prospect of establishing valid topological JJs with DC probe while allowing fast microwave probe to avoid quasiparticle poisoning.

Title: Mg$_{2}$Si and Ca$_{2}$Si semiconductors for photovoltaic applications: Calculations based on density-functional theory and the Bethe-Salpeter equation
Authors: Vinod Kumar Solet, Sudhir K. Pandey
Abstract: We conduct a comprehensive assessment of the electronic and optical properties, as well as photovoltaic (PV) performance parameters for Mg$_{2}$Si and Ca$_{2}$Si using density-functional theory and Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) based methods. The band-gap for Mg$_{2}$Si (Ca$_{2}$Si) is found to be in the range of 0.25-0.6 (0.57-0.96) eV when PBE, PBEsol and mBJ functionals are used. In the independent-particle approximation (IPA), the real and imaginary parts of dielectric function show maximum values of 50 (16.3) at 2.6 (1.0) eV and 61 (16.2) at $\sim$3.24 (3.4) eV, respectively. Within BSE, these respective values change to 59 (17) at 2.5 (0.86) eV and 65 (16.6) at 2.68 (3.1) eV. The excitonic effect is found to be crucial in understanding the experimental optical spectra of Mg$_{2}$Si. However, this effect is relatively weaker in Ca$_{2}$Si. Present study highlights the importance of different levels of theoretical approximations for obtaining the optical spectroscopy data of silicides with a high level of accuracy. Finally, we have evaluated PV efficiency by using spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency (SLME) calculation. On the top of radiative recombination, we have also incorporated non-radiative carrier recombination at a defect trap state via Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) mechanism to evaluate the efficiency. Among the studied defects, the interstitial Mg (Si) is identified as the most stable in Mg$_{2}$Si (Ca$_{2}$Si) and this provides SRH lifetime of 2 $\mu s$ (11.3 $ms$). The estimated maximum SLME using BSE absorption spectrum is 1.3 (31.2)\%, which decreases to 1.2 (28.5)\% due to SRH recombination. The present study suggests that Ca$_{2}$Si (Mg$_{2}$Si) is a potential candidate for single-junction (bottom cell in multi-junction) thin-film PV devices.

Title: Long-range translational order and hyperuniformity in two-dimensional chiral active crystal
Authors: Yuta Kuroda, Takeshi Kawasaki, Kunimasa Miyazaki
Abstract: We numerically study two-dimensional athermal chiral active particles at high densities. The particles in this system perform the circular motion with frequency $\Omega$. We show that the system crystallizes at high densities even in two dimensions, accompanied by the true long-range translational order. This is due to the anomalous suppression of displacement fluctuations associated with hyperuniformity. These findings can be explained using an active elastic theory quantitatively. Surprisingly, the crystals become unstable and melt in the limit of $\Omega=0$, for the spatial dimension of four or less. This result can be explained by a mechanism akin to quenched random systems for which the lower critical dimension is four.

Title: Thermopower probing emergent local moments in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene
Authors: Ayan Ghosh, Souvik Chakraborty, Ranit Dutta, Adhip Agarwala, K. Watanabe, T. Taniguchi, Sumilan Banerjee, Nandini Trivedi, Subroto Mukerjee, Anindya Das
Abstract: Recent experiments on magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBLG) have revealed the formation of flatbands, suggesting that correlation effects are likely to dominate in this system. Yet, a global transport measurement showing distinct signatures of strong correlations like local moments arising from the flatbands is missing. Utilizing thermopower as a sensitive global transport probe for measuring entropy, we unveil the presence of emergent local moments through their impact on entropy. Remarkably, in addition to sign changes at the Dirac point ($\nu = 0$) and full band filling ($\nu = \pm 4$), the thermopower of MATBLG demonstrates additional sign changes at the location, $\nu_{cross} \sim \pm 1$, which do not vary with temperature from $5K$ to $\sim 60K$. This is in contrast to sensitive temperature-dependent crossing points seen in our study on twisted bilayer graphene devices with weaker correlations. Further, we have investigated the effect of magnetic field ($B$) on the thermopower, both $B_{\parallel}$ and $B_{\perp}$. Our results show a $30\%$ and $50\%$ reduction, respectively, that is consistent with suppression seen in the layered oxide due to the partial polarization of the spin entropy. The observed robust crossing points, together with suppression in a magnetic field, cannot be explained solely from the contributions of band fermions; instead, our data is consistent with the dominant contribution arising from the entropy of the emergent localized moments of a strongly correlated flatband.

Title: Numerical evidence for spin chirality emerging from itinerant ferromagnets in bands with Berry curvature
Authors: Shuai Yang, Zhiyu Dong, Yan Chen
Abstract: The behavior of strongly interacting electrons in bands with Berry curvature is a problem of wide interest. In this paper, we study this problem by numerically studying a fluxed Hubbard-type model on square lattice. Using this model, we demonstrate a metallic ferromagnet in electron bands equipped with Berry curvature can develop non-coplanar spin order in which spin polarization axes at different position span finite solid angles. We find spin chirality can emerge in this setting by doping or adding gauge flux on top of a collinear ferromagnet. This result supports the prediction of spin chirality occurring through an emergent spin orbital interaction. Meanwhile, our result shows that, on top a ferromagnetic background, the spin chirality emerges at a finite threshold value of orbital magnetization, resembling the predicted behavior in theory.

Title: Variational Mapping of Chern Bands to Landau Levels: Application to Fractional Chern Insulators in Twisted MoTe$_2$
Authors: Bohao Li, Fengcheng Wu
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of mapping between Chern bands and generalized Landau levels in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ ($t$MoTe$_2$), where fractional Chern insulators down to zero magnetic fields have been observed. We construct an exact Landau-level representation of moiré bands, where the basis functions, characterized by a uniform quantum geometry, are derived from Landau-level wavefunctions dressed by spinors aligned or antialigned with the layer pseudospin skyrmion field. We further generalize the dressed zeroth Landau level to a variational wavefunction with an ideal yet nonuniform quantum geometry and variationally maximize its weight in the first moiré band. The variational wavefunction has a high overlap with the first band and quantitatively captures the exact diagonalization spectra of fractional Chern insulators at hole-filling factors $\nu_h=2/3$ and $3/5$, providing a clear theoretical mechanism for the formation and properties of the fractionalized states. Our work introduces a variational approach to studying fractional states by mapping Chern bands to Landau levels, with application to other systems beyond $t$MoTe$_2$ also demonstrated.

Title: Average-exact mixed anomalies and compatible phases
Authors: Yichen Xu, Chao-Ming Jian
Abstract: The quantum anomaly of a global symmetry is known to strongly constrain the allowed low-energy physics in a clean and isolated quantum system. However, the effect of quantum anomalies in disordered systems is much less understood, especially when the global symmetry is only preserved on average by the disorder. In this work, we focus on disordered systems with both average and exact symmetries $A\times K$, where the exact symmetry $K$ is respected in every disorder configuration, and the average $A$ is only preserved on average by the disorder ensemble. When there is a mixed quantum anomaly between the average and exact symmetries, we argue that the mixed state representing the ensemble of disordered ground states cannot be featureless. While disordered mixed states smoothly connected to the anomaly-compatible phases in clean limit are certainly allowed, we also found disordered phases that have no clean-limit counterparts, including the glassy states with strong-to-weak symmetry breaking, and average topological orders for certain anomalies. We construct solvable lattice models to demonstrate each of these possibilities. We also provide a field-theoretic argument to provide a criterion for whether a given average-exact mixed anomaly admits a compatible average topological order.

Title: Anomalous rheology of puller-type microswimmer suspensions
Authors: Haruki Hayano, Akira Furukawa
Abstract: We explore the mechanism underlying the anomalous rheology of puller-type microswimmer suspensions through direct hydrodynamic simulations. Puller-type swimmers generate contractile flow fields along their swimming direction, leading to hydrodynamic interactions that cause the swimmers to align vertically. Our simulations reveal that this alignment effect, along with the resultant orientational order of swimming motion, becomes particularly pronounced near boundary walls, where local swimmer density is amplified, predominantly controlling the overall swimming dynamics and rheological properties of the suspension. These findings contrast with our previous simulations of pusher-type swimmers, which hydrodynamically interact through extensile flow fields, whereby they exhibit weak orientational order in the bulk region, which primarily determines their steady-state properties. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the steady-state behavior near the walls is strongly influenced by the aspect ratio of the microswimmers and the degree of confinement between the walls. Our results highlight the crucial role of microswimmer characteristics, such as shape and swimming mechanisms, in determining the rheological properties of active suspensions.

Title: Catalogue of $C$-paired spin-momentum locking in antiferromagnetic systems
Authors: Mengli Hu, Xingkai Cheng, Zhenqiao Huang, Junwei Liu
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic materials (AFMs) have been gaining lots of attentions due to its great potential in spintronics devices and the recently discovered novel spin structure in the momentum space, i.e., $C$-paired spin-valley or spin-momentum locking (CSVL/CSML), where spins and valleys/momenta are locked to each other due to the crystal symmetry guaranteeing zero magnetization. Here, we systematically studied CSMLs and proposed a general theory and algorithm using little co-group and coset representatives, which reveals that 12 elementary kinds of CSMLs, determined by the geometric relation of spins and valleys and the essential symmetry guaranteeing zero magnetization, are sufficient to fully represent all possible CSMLs. By combining the proposed algorithm and high-throughput first-principles calculations, we predicted 38 magnetic point groups and identified 142 experimentally verified AFMs that can realize CSML. Besides predicting new materials, our theory can naturally reveal underlying mechanisms of CSMLs' responses to external fields. As an example, two qualitatively different types of piezomagnetism via occupation imbalance or spin tilting were predicted in RbV$_2$Te$_2$O. The algorithm and conclusions can be directly extended to the locking between valley/momentum and any other pseudo-vector degree of freedom, e.g., Berry curvature, as exemplified in RbV$_2$Te$_2$O and the new proposed piezo-Hall effect, where a strain can induce a non-zero anomalous Hall conductance. In addition, the proposed concept and methodology can be straightforwardly applied to other symmetry groups, such as spin group.

Title: Speed-accuracy relations for the diffusion models: Wisdom from nonequilibrium thermodynamics and optimal transport
Authors: Kotaro Ikeda, Tomoya Uda, Daisuke Okanohara, Sosuke Ito
Abstract: We discuss a connection between a generative model, called the diffusion model, and nonequilibrium thermodynamics for the Fokker-Planck equation, called stochastic thermodynamics. Based on the techniques of stochastic thermodynamics, we derive the speed-accuracy relations for the diffusion models, which are inequalities that relate the accuracy of data generation to the entropy production rate, which can be interpreted as the speed of the diffusion dynamics in the absence of the non-conservative force. From a stochastic thermodynamic perspective, our results provide a quantitative insight into how best to generate data in diffusion models. The optimal learning protocol is introduced by the geodesic of space of the 2-Wasserstein distance in optimal transport theory. We numerically illustrate the validity of the speed-accuracy relations for the diffusion models with different noise schedules and the different data. We numerically discuss our results for the optimal and suboptimal learning protocols. We also show the inaccurate data generation due to the non-conservative force, and the applicability of our results to data generation from the real-world image datasets.

Title: Fate of transient order parameter domain walls in ultrafast experiments
Authors: Lingxian Kong, Ryuichi Shindou, Zhiyuan Sun
Abstract: In ultrafast experiments, an optical pump pulse often generates transient domain walls of the order parameter in materials with spontaneous symmetry breaking, due to either a finite penetration depth of light on a three-dimensional (3D) material, or a finite spot size on a two-dimensional (2D) material. We show that the domain wall decays due to unstable order parameter fluctuations. We study a generic system with $U(1)$-symmetric order, and those with an additional weak $Z_2$ ($U(1)$-symmetry-breaking) term, representing the charge-density-wave (CDW) orders in recent experiments. During the first stage of the decay dynamics, exponentially growing thermal fluctuations convert the domain wall into an interface with randomly distributed topological defects. In the second stage, the topological defects undergo a coarsening dynamics within the interface. For a 2D interface in a 3D system, the coarsening dynamics leads to a diffusive growth of the correlation length. For a one-dimensional (1D) interface in a 2D system with the weak $Z_2$ term, the correlation-length growth shows a crossover from diffusive to sub-diffusive behavior.

Title: Competitive helical bands and highly efficient diode effect in F/S/TI/S/F hybrid structures
Authors: T. Karabassov, I. V. Bobkova, V. S. Stolyarov, V. M. Silkin, A. S. Vasenko
Abstract: The diode effect in superconducting materials has been actively investigated in recent years. Plenty of different devices have been proposed as a platform to observe the superconducting diode effect. In this work we discuss the possibility of a highly efficient superconducting diode design with controllable polarity. We propose the mesoscopic device that consists of two separated superconducting islands with proximity induced ferromagnetism deposited on top of the three-dimensional topological insulator. Using the quasiclassical formalism of the Usadel equations we demonstrate that the sign of the diode efficiency can be controlled by magnetization tuning of a single superconducting island. Moreover, we show that the diode efficiency can be substantially increased in such device. We argue that the dramatic increase of the diode efficiency is due to competing contribution of the two superconducting islands to the supercurrent with single helical bands linked through the topological insulator surface.

Title: Impact of Ge, Ga, and Al doping on the mechanical and electronic properties of Cr$_3$Si: insights from first-principles calculations
Authors: Siavash Karbasizadeh, Mohammad Amirabbasi
Abstract: This study systematically investigates the effects of Ge, Ga, and Al doping on the mechanical and electronic properties of cubic Cr$_3$Si using first-principles density functional theory (DFT). Doping increases lattice constants from 4.50 Å for undoped Cr$_3$Si to 4.51-4.53 Å (Ge), 4.52-4.54 Å (Ga), and 4.51-4.54 Å (Al) as doping concentrations increase from 12.5 $\%$ to 50 $\%$. Negative formation enthalpies across all configurations confirm thermodynamic stability, with values ranging from -0.35 eV/atom for undoped Cr$_3$Si to -0.33 eV/atom (Ge), -0.31 eV/atom (Al), and -0.25 eV/atom (Ga) at 50 $\%$ doping. Mechanical properties exhibit significant degradation with increased doping: bulk modulus decreases from 248.7 GPa for undoped Cr$_3$Si to 241 GPa (12.5 $\%$), 238 GPa (25 $\%$), 235 GPa (37.5 $\%$), and 231 GPa (50 $\%$) for Ge doping, with similar trends for Ga (230 GPa at 50 $\%$) and Al (232 GPa at 50 $\%$). Shear modulus and Young's modulus follow similar reductions, with shear modulus going from 158.9 GPa to 147 GPa (Ge), 145 GPa (Ga), and 147 GPa (Al) at 50 $\%$ doping. Elastic anisotropy increases notably with Al and Ga doping, while Ge maintains a relatively isotropic behavior. The wave velocities and Debye temperatures decrease for all dopants, with Debye temperature dropping from 720 K for undoped Cr$_3$Si to 700 K (Ge), 685 K (Ga), and 690 K (Al) at 50 $\%$ doping, reflecting a softer lattice and diminished thermal conductivity. While Al and Ga doping introduce higher anisotropy and reduce mechanical rigidity, Ge doping preserves isotropic mechanical behavior, making it the most suitable dopant for applications requiring balanced mechanical and thermal properties. These findings offer critical insights into tailoring Cr$_3$Si-based alloys for high-performance applications, highlighting trade-offs between stiffness, anisotropy, and thermal performance.

Title: Short-range order and hidden energy scale in geometrically frustrated magnets
Authors: Arthur P. Ramirez, Sergey Syzranov
Abstract: In geometrically frustrated (GF) magnets, conventional long-range order is suppressed due to the presence of primitive triangular structural units, and the nature of the ensuing ground state remains elusive. One class of candidate states, extensively sought in experiments and vigorously studied theoretically, is the quantum spin liquid (QSL), a magnetically-disordered state in which all spins participate in a quantum-coherent many-body state. Randomly located impurities, present in all materials, may prevent QSL formation and instead lead to the formation of a spin-glass state. In this article, we review available data on the specific heat, magnetic susceptibility, and neutron scattering in GF materials. Such data show that a pure GF magnet possesses a characteristic ``hidden energy scale'' significantly exceeded by the other microscopic energy scales in the material. When cooled down to a temperature below the hidden energy scale, a GF material develops significant short-range order that dominates its properties and, in particular, dictates the spin-glass transition temperature for experimentally accessible impurity densities. We review the manifestations of short-range order in the commonly observed thermodynamics quantities in GF materials, possible scenarios for the hidden energy scale, and related open questions.

Title: Finite-momentum superconductivity in two-dimensional altermagnets with a Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling
Authors: Kohei Mukasa, Yusuke Masaki
Abstract: We theoretically study finite-momentum superconductivity in two-dimensional (2D) altermagnets with a Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling (RSOC). We show the phase diagrams obtained by solving a linearized gap equation, considering two directions of the Néel vector of the 2D altermagnet: parallel to the $xy$ plane (in-plane) and perpendicular to the $xy$ plane (out-of-plane). For the in-plane Néel vector, we find two different finite-momentum $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave superconducting states distinguished by a dominant pairing channel: an inter-band pairing or an intra-band pairing. Furthermore, it is shown that an anisotropic deformation of Fermi surfaces caused by spin-splitting effects due to the in-plane Néel vector and the RSOC can contribute to the stabilization of the finite-momentum superconductivity. We also perform the self-consistent calculations, and verify the existence of these superconducting states in addition to identifying other possible superconducting states and transition lines away from the phase boundary. For the out-of-plane Néel vector, the finite-momentum superconductivity is realized only in the inter-band pairing mechanism, which is in contrast to the in-plane case.

Title: Bose-Fermi $N$-polaron state emergence from correlation-mediated blocking of phase separation
Authors: Felipe Gómez-Lozada, Hoshu Hiyane, Thomas Busch, Thomás Fogarty
Abstract: We study $N$ fermionic impurities in a one-dimensional lattice bosonic bath at unit filling. Using DMRG and mixed boundary conditions-periodic for bosons, open for fermions -- we find an $N$-polaron ground state replacing phase separation at high interspecies repulsion. This tightly bound state of clustered particles emerges due to strong impurity-bath correlations, which induce large impurity-impurity correlations that we quantify via the von Neumann entropy and bipartite mutual information, respectively. This system also reveals a fermionic self-localization effect from a Mott insulator background due to local correlations between the impurities and the bath. The growth of long-range correlations breaks this Mott phase, resulting in the transition to impurity clusters delocalized along the system. Finally, we show that there is a critical impurity number, which depends on intraspecies bosonic interaction, beyond which phase separation is recovered.

Title: Nonequilibrium chemical short-range order in metallic alloys
Authors: Mahmudul Islam, Killian Sheriff, Yifan Cao, Rodrigo Freitas
Abstract: Metallic alloys are routinely subjected to nonequilibrium processes during manufacturing, such as rapid solidification and thermomechanical processing. It has been suggested in the high-entropy alloy literature that chemical short-range order (SRO) could offer a ''new knob'' to tailor materials properties. While evidence of the effect of SRO on materials properties accumulates, the state of SRO evolution during alloy manufacturing remains obscure. Here, we employ high-fidelity atomistic simulations to track SRO evolution during the solidification and thermomechanical processing of alloys. Our investigation reveals that alloy processing can lead to nonequilibrium steady-states of SRO that are different from any equilibrium state. The mechanism behind nonequilibrium SRO formation is shown to be an inherent ordering bias present in nonequilibrium events. These results demonstrate that conventional manufacturing processes provide pathways for tuning SRO that lead to a broad nonequilibrium spectrum of SRO states beyond the equilibrium design space of alloys.

Title: Post-Transition Metal Sn-Based Chalcogenide Perovskites: A Promising Lead-Free and Transition Metal Alternative for Stable, High-Performance Photovoltaics
Authors: Surajit Adhikari, Sankhasuvra Das, Priya Johari
Abstract: Chalcogenide perovskites (CPs) have emerged as promising materials for optoelectronic applications due to their stability, non-toxicity, small bandgaps, high absorption coefficients, and defect tolerance. Although transition metal-based CPs, particularly those incorporating Zr and Hf, have been well-studied, they often exhibit higher bandgaps, lower charge carrier mobility, and reduced efficiency compared to lead-based halide perovskites (HPs). Tin (Sn), a post-transition metal with a similar oxidation state (+4) as Zr and Hf in ABX$_{3}$ structures but with different valence characteristics, remains underexplored in CPs. Given the influence of valence states on material properties, Sn-based CPs are of great interest. This study employs density functional theory (DFT), density functional perturbation theory (DFPT), and many-body perturbation theory (GW and BSE) to investigate a series of distorted Sn-based CPs (ASnX$_{3}$, A = Ca, Sr, Ba; X = S, Se). Our results demonstrate that these perovskites are mechanically stable and exhibit lower direct G$_{0}$W$_{0}$ bandgaps (0.79-1.50 eV) compared to their Zr- and Hf-based counterparts. Analysis of carrier-phonon interactions reveals that the charge-separated polaronic state is less stable than the bound exciton state in these materials. Additionally, polaron-assisted charge carrier mobilities for electrons (21.33-416.02 cm^{2}V^{-1}s^{-1}) and holes (7.02-260.69 cm^{2}V^{-1}s^{-1}) are comparable to or higher than those in lead-based HPs and significantly exceed those of Zr- and Hf-based CPs, owing to reduced carrier-phonon coupling. The estimated spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency (24.2%-31.2%)-confirmed through perovskite solar cell (PSC) simulations using SCAPS-1D software-indicates that these materials are promising candidates for photovoltaic applications.

Title: Emergent multi-loop nested point gap in a non-Hermitian quasiperiodic lattice
Authors: Yi-Qi Zheng, Shan-Zhong Li, Zhi Li
Abstract: We propose a geometric series modulated non-Hermitian quasiperiodic lattice model, and explore its localization and topological properties. The results show that with the ever-increasing summation terms of the geometric series, multiple mobility edges and non-Hermitian point gaps with high winding number can be induced in the system. The point gap spectrum of the system has a multi-loop nested structure in the complex plane, resulting in a high winding number. In addition, we analyze the limit case of summation of infinite terms. The results show that the mobility edges merge together as only one mobility edge when summation terms are pushed to the limit. Meanwhile, the corresponding point gaps are merged into a ring with winding number equal to one. Through Avila's global theory, we give an analytical expression for mobility edges in the limit of infinite summation, reconfirming that mobility edges and point gaps do merge and will result in a winding number that is indeed equal to one.

Title: Macroscopic degeneracy of ground state in the frustrated Heisenberg diamond chain
Authors: D. V. Dmitriev, V. Ya. Krivnov
Abstract: The spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg diamond chain with ferro- and antiferromagnetic exchange interactions is studied. The phase boundary in the parametric space of these interactions is determined, where the transition between the ferromagnetic and other (singlet or ferrimagnetic) ground state phases occurs. On this phase boundary there is a dispersionless (flat) energy band in the one-magnon spectrum and these states can be represented as localized magnons in the trapping cells between neighboring diamonds. The ground state consists of the localized magnons and special magnon complexes and it is macroscopically degenerate. A remarkable feature of the model is the existence, on a certain part of the phase boundary, of two- and three-magnon localized states, forming flat bands in two- and three-magnon spectrum. All these localized states also belong to the ground state manifold, which turns out to be exactly the same as for the system of independent spins-$\frac{3}{2}$. This implies a large macroscopic degeneracy of the ground state $4^n$ ($n$ is number of diamonds in the chain) and a high residual entropy per spin $s_{0}=\frac{2}{3}\ln 2$.

Title: Optimizing search processes in systems with state toggling: exact condition delimiting the efficacy of stochastic resetting strategy
Authors: Hillol kumar Barman, Amitabha Nandi, Dibyendu Das
Abstract: Will the strategy of resetting} help a stochastic process to reach its target efficiently, with its environment continually toggling between a strongly favourable and an unfavourable (or weakly favourable) state? A diffusive run-and-tumble motion, transport of molecular motors on or off a filament, and motion under flashing optical traps are special examples of such state toggling. For any general process with toggling under Poisson reset, we derive a mathematical condition for continuous transitions where the advantage rendered by resetting vanishes. For the case of diffusive motion with linear potentials of unequal strength, we present exact solutions which reveal that there is quite generically a re-entrance of the advantage of resetting as a function of the strength of the strongly favourable potential. This result is shown to be valid for quadratic potential traps by using the general condition of transition.

Title: Topological Chiral Edge States in a Synthetic Dimension of Atomic Trap States
Authors: David G. Reid, Christopher Oliver, Patrick Regan, Aaron Smith, Thomas Easton, Grazia Salerno, Giovanni Barontini, Nathan Goldman, Hannah M. Price
Abstract: A key hallmark of quantum Hall physics is the existence of topological chiral states at the system boundary. Signatures of these edge states have been experimentally observed in cold atoms by using different approaches, including notably that of ``synthetic dimension'' in which internal states are coupled together and reinterpreted as sites along an artificial spatial dimension. However, previous atomic synthetic dimension implementations have been limited to relatively small system sizes with inflexible boundaries. In this paper, we propose instead how to use a synthetic dimension of atomic trap states to observe chiral edge states in a large quantum Hall system with a tunable edge. We present numerical simulations for relevant experimental parameters, showing how this scheme may be used to probe the properties and robustness of the edge states to defects. Our work opens the way for future experiments in topological physics with synthetic dimensions, while also providing new ways to manipulate and control highly-excited trap states.

Title: Dynamic Tuning of Single-Photon Emission in Monolayer WSe2 via Localized Strain Engineering
Authors: Yi Yu, Junyu Ge, Manlin Luo, In Cheol Seo, Youngmin Kim, John J. H. Eng, Kunze Lu, Tian-Ran Wei, Seok Woo Lee, Weibo Gao, Hong Li, Donguk Nam
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials have emerged as promising candidates for next-generation integrated single-photon emitters (SPEs). However, significant variability in the emission energies of 2D SPEs presents a major challenge in producing identical single photons from different SPEs, which may become crucial for various quantum applications including quantum information processing. Although various approaches to dynamically tuning the emission energies of 2D SPEs have been developed to address the issue, the practical solution to matching multiple individual SPEs in a single 2D flake is still scarce. In this work, we demonstrate a precise emission energy tuning of individual SPEs in a WSe2 monolayer. Our approach utilizes localized strain fields near individual SPEs, which we control independently by adjusting the physical volume of an SU-8-based stressor layer via focused laser annealing. This technique allows continuous emission energy tuning of up to 15 meV while maintaining the qualities of SPEs. Additionally, we showcase the precise spectral alignment of three distinct SPEs in a single WSe2 monolayer to the same wavelength. The tunability of 2D SPEs represents a solid step towards the on-chip integrated photonics with 2D materials for quantum technologies.

Title: Intrinsic Nernst effect of the magnon orbital moment in a honeycomb ferromagnet
Authors: Daehyeon An, Se Kwon Kim
Abstract: The Nernst effect of the magnon orbital moment is theoretically investigated in a honeycomb ferromagnet, whose Hamiltonian contains the Heisenberg exchange, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya, the Kitaev, and the Zeeman interactions. More specifically, we obtain the magnon band structure, the Berry curvature, the magnon orbital moment Berry curvature, and the magnon orbital moment Nernst conductivity (MOMNC) for the Hamiltonian within the linear spin-wave theory in the polarized phase. We found the magnon orbital moment Berry curvature is largely independent of the sign of the Chern number of the band. For an experimental proposal, we estimate MOMNC of $\mathrm{CrI}_{3}$ for the Heisenberg-Kitaev-$\Gamma$-Zeeman model and Heisenberg-Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya-Zeeman model for a perpendicular external magnetic field. We found that certain Kitaev materials provide us with a broad tunability of the MOMNC through a magnetic field. We envision that our findings lead to further investigations of the novel transport properties of the magnon orbital moment.

Title: Subleading logarithmic behavior in the parquet formalism

Abstract: The Fermi-edge singularity in x-ray absorption spectra of metals is a paradigmatic case of a logarithmically divergent perturbation series. Prior work has thoroughly analyzed the leading logarithmic terms. Here, we investigate the perturbation theory beyond leading logarithms and formulate self-consistent equations to incorporate all leading and next-to-leading logarithmic terms. This parquet solution of the Fermi-edge singularity goes beyond the previous first-order parquet solution and sheds new light on the parquet formalism regarding logarithmic behavior. We present numerical results in the Matsubara formalism and discuss the characteristic power laws. We also show that, within the single-boson exchange framework, multi-boson exchange diagrams are needed already at the leading logarithmic level.

Title: From $G_2$ to $SO(8)$: Emergence and reminiscence of supersymmetry and triality
Authors: Zhi-Qiang Gao, Congjun Wu
Abstract: We construct a (1+1)-dimension continuum model of 4-component fermions incorporating the exceptional Lie group symmetry $G_2$. Four gapped and five gapless phases are identified via the one-loop renormalization group analysis. The gapped phases are controlled by four different stable $SO(8)$ Gross-Neveu fixed points, among which three exhibit an emergent triality, while the rest one possesses the self-triality, i.e., invariant under the triality mapping. The gapless phases include three $SO(7)$ critical ones, a $G_2$ critical one, and a Luttinger liquid. Three $SO(7)$ critical phases correspond to different $SO(7)$ Gross-Neveu fixed points connected by the triality relation similar to the gapped SO(8) case. The $G_2$ critical phase is controlled by an unstable fixed point described by a direct product of the Ising and tricritical Ising conformal field theories with the central charges $c=\frac{1}{2}$ and $c=\frac{7}{10}$, respectively, while the latter one is known to possess spacetime supersymmetry. In the lattice realization with a Hubbard-type interaction, the triality is broken into the duality between two $SO(7)$ symmetries and the supersymmetric $G_2$ critical phase exhibits the degeneracy between bosonic and fermionic states, which are reminiscences of the continuum model.

Title: Exactly characterizing critical states: invariance in both position and momentum spaces
Authors: Tong Liu
Abstract: The critical state of disordered systems is an intriguing and popular topic in condensed matter physics, known for its non-ergodic properties such as multifractal structure and self-similarity. However, exactly characterizing critical states continues to pose a significant challenge so far. In this work, we propose an Ansatz for the critical state, and argue that critical states exhibit invariance in both position and momentum spaces, leading to their delocalization in both dual spaces. Furthermore, keeping pace with the idea of Liu-Xia criterion, we demonstrate that physical quantities being directly observed in experiments, such as the inverse participation ratio and information entropy, also exhibit invariance in both position and momentum spaces. Subsequent numerical simulations verify the correctness of this invariance, thereby establishing a robust foundation for future experimental validation of critical states.

Title: A variational formulation of the free energy of mixed quantum-classical systems: coupling classical and electronic density functional theories
Authors: Guillaume Jeanmairet, Emmanuel Giner
Abstract: Combining classical density functional theory (cDFT) with quantum mechanics (QM) methods offers a computationally efficient alternative to traditional QM/molecular mechanics (MM) approaches for modeling mixed quantum-classical systems at finite temperatures. However, both QM/MM and QM/cDFT rely on somewhat ambiguous approximations. This paper aims to develop an exact theoretical framework that allows us to clarify the approximations involved in the QM/cDFT formulation and serves as a starting point for further development. We therefore establish a comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) framework for mixed quantum-classical systems within the canonical ensemble. We start with the adiabatic equilibrium density matrix for a system comprising N qm quantum and N mm classical particles and, based on this, we propose a variational formulation of the Helmholtz free energy in terms of the full QM/MM density matrix. Taking advantage of permutational symmetry and thanks to constrained-search methods, we reformulate the computation of the Helmholtz free energy using only the quantum and classical one-body densities, thus generalizing both cDFT and electronic DFT (eDFT) for QM/MM systems. We then reformulate the functional in order to explicitly make appear the eDFT and cDFT Levy-Lieb functionals, together with a new universal correlation functional for QM/MM systems. A mean-field approximation is finally introduced in the context of solvation problems and we discuss its connection with several existing mixed cDFT-eDFT schemes.

Title: Absorbing state dynamics of stochastic gradient descent
Authors: Guanming Zhang, Stefano Martiniani
Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a fundamental tool for training deep neural networks across a variety of tasks. In self-supervised learning, different input categories map to distinct manifolds in the embedded neural state space. Accurate classification is achieved by separating these manifolds during learning, akin to a packing problem. We investigate the dynamics of ``neural manifold packing'' by employing a minimal model in which SGD is applied to spherical particles in physical space. In this model, SGD minimizes the system's energy (classification loss) by stochastically reducing overlaps between particles (manifolds). We observe that this process undergoes an absorbing phase transition, prompting us to use the framework of biased random organization (BRO), a nonequilibrium absorbing state model, to describe SGD behavior. We show that BRO dynamics can be approximated by those of particles with linear repulsive interactions under multiplicative anisotropic noise. Thus, for a linear repulsive potential and small kick sizes (learning rates), we find that BRO and SGD become equivalent, converging to the same critical packing fraction $\phi_c \approx 0.64$, despite the fundamentally different origins of their noise. This equivalence is further supported by the observation that, like BRO, near the critical point, SGD exhibits behavior consistent with the Manna universality class. Above the critical point, SGD exhibits a bias towards flatter minima of the energy landscape, reinforcing the analogy with loss minimization in neural networks.

Title: Emergence of the 3D diluted Ising model universality class in a mixture of two magnets
Authors: J. J. Ruiz-Lorenzo, M. Dudka, M. Krasnytska, Yu. Holovatch
Abstract: Usually, the impact of structural disorder on the magnetic phase transition in the 3D Ising model is analyzed within the framework of quenched dilution by a non-magnetic component, where some lattice sites are occupied by Ising spins, while others are non-magnetic. This kind of quenched dilution, according to the Harris criterion, leads to a change in the critical exponents that govern the asymptotics in the vicinity of the phase transition point. However, the inherent reason for the emergence of a new, random Ising model universality class is not the presence of a non-magnetic component but the disorder in structure of spin arrangement. To demonstrate this fact, in this paper, we set up extensive Monte Carlo simulations of a random mixture of two Ising-like magnets that differ in spin length $s$ and concentration $c$. In doing so, we analyze the effect of structural disorder \textit{per se} without appealing to the presence of a non-magnetic component. We support our numerical simulations with renormalization group calculations. Our results demonstrate the emergence of the 3D randomly diluted Ising model universality class in a random mixture of two Ising magnets. While the asymptotic critical exponents coincide with those known for the site-diluted 3D Ising model, the effective critical behavior is triggered by parameters $s$ and $c$. The impact of their interplay is a subject of detailed analysis.

Title: Larger grains in high-Tc superconductors synthesized by the solid-state reaction route
Authors: D.M. Gokhfeld, M.I. Petrov, S.V. Semenov, A.D. Balaev, I.V. Nemtsev, A.D. Vasiliev, M.S. Molokeev
Abstract: Solid-state synthesis is widely used in exploratory research to study various structural modifications that affect the properties (critical temperature, critical current density, irreversibility field, etc.) of superconductors. The popularity of this method is due to its relative simplicity and availability of the necessary equipment. Combining solid-state synthesis and top-seeded melt growth allows us to increase the grain size in a Tm- and Nd-based 1-2-3 superconductor. Samples with a grain size up to 0.1 mm have been obtained. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and magnetization measurements have been used for investigating this superconducting material. The magnetization width {\Delta}M has increased significantly in the synthesized samples. However the temperature dependence of the intragrain critical current density and the pinning force scaling give evidences that the pinning mechanism in the obtained superconductor is essentially the same as in polycrystalline superconductors synthesized by standard solid-state technology. The increase in grain size in the synthesized samples is the main reason for the high values of {\Delta}M.

Title: Two-body interaction induced phase transitions and intermediate phases in nonreciprocal non-Hermitian quasicrystals
Authors: Yalun Zhang, Longwen Zhou
Abstract: Non-Hermitian phenomena, such as exceptional points, non-Hermitian skin effects, and topologically nontrivial phases have attracted continued attention. In this work, we reveal how interactions and nonreciprocal hopping could collectively influence the behavior of two interacting bosons on quasiperiodic lattices. Focusing on the Bose-Hubbard model with Aubry-André-Harper quasiperiodic modulations and hopping asymmetry, we discover that interactions could enlarge the localization transition point of the noninteracting system into an intermediate mobility edge phase, in which localized doublons formed by bosonic pairs can coexist with delocalized states. Under the open boundary condition, the bosonic doublons could further show non-Hermitian skin effects, realizing doublon condensation at the edges, and their direction of skin-localization can be flexibly tuned by the hopping parameters. A framework is developed to characterize the spectral, localization, and topological transitions accompanying these phenomena. Our work advances the understanding of localization and topological phases in non-Hermitian systems, particularly in relation to multiparticle interactions.

Title: Ising phase transitions and thermodynamics of correlated fermions in a two-dimensional spin-dependent lattice potential
Authors: Zhuotao Xie, Yu-Feng Song, Yuan-Yao He
Abstract: We present a {\it numerically exact} study of the Hubbard model with spin-dependent anisotropic hopping on the square lattice using auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo method. At half filling, the system undergoes Ising phase transitions upon cooling, leading to the formation of Ising-type antiferromagnetic order for repulsive interactions and charge-density wave order for attractive interactions at finite temperatures. By elegantly implementing the sign-problem-free condition and Hubbard-Stratonovich transformations, we achieve significant improvements in precision control of the numerical calculations and obtain highly accurate results of the transition temperatures from weak to strong interactions across representative anisotropies. We further characterize the system by examining the temperature dependence of various thermodynamic properties, including the energy, double occupancy, specific heat and charge susceptibility. Specifically, we provide unbiased numerical results of the entropy map on temperature-interaction plane, the critical entropy, and the spin, singlon and doublon correlations, all of which are directly measurable in optical lattice experiments. Away from half filling, we explore the behavior of the sign problem and investigate the possible emergence of stripe spin-density wave order in the system with repulsive interaction.

Title: ALATDYN: a set of Anharmonic LATtice DYNamics codes to compute thermodynamic and thermal transport properties of crystalline solids
Authors: Keivan Esfarjani, Harold Stokes, Safoura Nayeb Sadeghi, Yuan Liang, Bikash Timalsina, Han Meng, Junichiro Shiomi, Bolin Liao, Ruoshi Sun
Abstract: We introduce a lattice dynamics package which calculates elastic, thermodynamic and thermal transport properties of crystalline materials from data on their force and potential energy as a function of atomic positions. The data can come from density functional theory (DFT) calculations or classical molecular dynamics runs performed in a supercell. First, the model potential parameters, which are anharmonic force constants are extracted from the latter runs. Then, once the anharmonic model is defined, thermal conductivity and equilibrium properties at finite temperatures can be computed using lattice dynamics, Boltzmann transport theories, and a variational principle respectively. In addition, the software calculates the mechanical properties such as elastic tensor, Gruneisen parameters and the thermal expansion coefficient within the quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA). Phonons, elastic constants and thermodynamic properties results applied to the germanium crystal will be illustrated. Using the force constants as a force field, one may also perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in order to investigate the combined effects of anharmonicity and defect scattering beyond perturbation theory.

Title: Interactive Multiscale Modeling to Bridge Atomic Properties and Electrochemical Performance in Li-CO$_2$ Battery Design
Authors: Mohammed Lemaalem, Selva Chandrasekaran Selvaraj, Ilias Papailias, Naveen K. Dandu, Arash Namaeighasemi, Larry A. Curtiss, Amin Salehi-Khojin, Anh T. Ngo
Abstract: Li-CO$_2$ batteries show promise as energy storage solutions, offering high theoretical energy density and CO$_2$ fixation. Their operation is based on the formation and decomposition of Li$_2$CO$_3$/C during discharge and charge cycles, respectively. We used a multiscale modeling framework that integrates Density Functional Theory (DFT), Ab-Initio Molecular Dynamics (AIMD), classical Molecular Dynamics (MD), and Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to investigate atomic and cell-level properties. The considered Li-CO$_2$ battery consists of a lithium metal anode, an ionic liquid electrolyte, and a carbon cloth porous cathode with Sb$_{0.67}$Bi$_{1.33}$Te$_3$ as a catalyst. DFT and AIMD determined the electrical conductivities of Sb$_{0.67}$Bi$_{1.33}$Te$_3$ and Li$_2$CO$_3$ using the Kubo-Greenwood formalism and studied the CO$_2$ reduction mechanism on the cathode catalyst. MD simulations calculated the CO$_2$ diffusion coefficient, Li$^+$ transference number, ionic conductivity, and Li$^+$ solvation structure. The FEA model, incorporating results from atomistic simulations, reproduced experimental voltage-capacity profiles at 1 mA/cm$^2$ and revealed spatio-temporal variations in Li$_2$CO$_3$/C deposition, porosity, and CO$_2$ concentration dependence on discharge rates in the cathode. Accordingly, Li$_2$CO$_3$ can form large and thin film deposits, leading to dispersed and local porosity changes at 0.1 mA/cm$^2$ and 1 mA/cm$^2$, respectively. The capacity decreases exponentially from 81,570 mAh/g at 0.1 mA/cm$^2$ to 6,200 mAh/g at 1 mA/cm$^2$, due to pore clogging from excessive discharge product deposition that limits CO$_2$ transport to the cathode interior. Therefore, the performance of Li-CO$_2$ batteries can be improved by enhancing CO$_2$ transport, regulating Li$_2$CO$_3$ deposition, and optimizing cathode architecture.

Title: Grain boundary interstitial segregation in substitutional binary alloys
Authors: Zuoyong Zhang, Chuang Deng
Abstract: Grain boundary (GB) segregation is a powerful approach for optimizing the thermal and mechanical properties of metal alloys. In this study, we report significant GB interstitial segregation in a representative substitutional binary alloy system (Al-Ni) through atomistic simulations, challenging prevailing assumptions in the literature. Our findings show that Ni atoms preferentially segregate to interstitial sites within numerous kite-like GB structures in the Al bicrystals. An intriguing interplanar interstitial segregation pattern was also observed and analyzed. Additionally, interstitial segregation can induce unexpected GB transitions, such as kite transitions and nano-faceting, due to the existence of small interstitial sites. Building upon these observations, we developed a robust method to systematically identify the interstitial candidate sites for accommodating solutes at GBs. This approach combines site detection with structural filtering to produce distributions of interstitial sites that closely match atomistic simulation results. Applied to nanocrystalline alloys, this method enabled the calculation of interstitial segregation energies, significantly improving GB segregation predictions for the Al-Ni system. Furthermore, machine learning models using smooth overlap of atomic positions descriptors successfully predicted per-site interstitial segregation energy. This study highlights the critical role of GB interstitial segregation in advancing our understanding of solute behavior and provides valuable insights for designing next-generation alloys.

Title: Green's Function Approach to Josephson Dot Dynamics and Application to Quantum Mpemba Effects
Authors: Kateryna Zatsarynna, Andrea Nava, Reinhold Egger, Alex Zazunov
Abstract: We develop a Green's function approach for the nonequilibrium dynamics of multi-level quantum dots coupled to multiple fermionic reservoirs in the presence of a bosonic environment. Our theory is simpler than the Keldysh approach and goes beyond scattering state constructions. In concrete terms, we study Josephson junctions containing a quantum dot and coupled to an electromagnetic environment. In the dot region, spin-orbit interactions, a Zeeman field, and in principle also Coulomb interactions can be included. We then study quantum Mpemba effects, assuming that the average phase difference across the Josephson junction is subject to a rapid quench. For a short singlechannel junction, we show that both types of quantum Mpemba effects allowed in open quantum systems are possible. We also study an intermediate-length junction, where spin-orbit interactions and a Zeeman field are included. Again quantum Mpemba effects are predicted.

Title: Glassforming liquid crystalline equimolar mixtures of MHPOBC and fluorinated compounds -- structural, optical, and dielectric properties
Authors: Aleksandra Deptuch, Anna Paliga, Anna Drzewicz, Michał Czerwiński, Ewa Juszyńska-Gałązka
Abstract: Three liquid crystalline equimolar mixtures are formulated, each containing the MHPOBC compound and the homolog from the 3FmHPhF6 series with m = 4, 5, and 6. The properties of the mixtures are investigated by differential scanning calorimetry, polarizing optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction, electro-optic measurements, and UV-Vis-NIR and dielectric spectroscopies. In all mixtures, the smectic A*, smectic C*, and smectic C$_A$* phases are observed. Each mixture can be supercooled and forms the glass of smectic C$_A$* at 225-238 K. The glass transition temperature decreases with the increasing C$_m$H$_{2m}$ chain length in the 3FmHPhF6 molecule. The tilt angle in the smectic C$_A$* phase reaches 36.5-37.5°. The selective reflection of light in the visible and near-infrared spectral ranges is observed, with a strong dependence of the reflected light's wavenumber on temperature.

Title: Symmetry-breaking induced surface magnetization in non-magnetic RuO$_2$
Authors: Dai Q. Ho, D. Quang To, Ruiqi Hu, Garnett W. Bryant, Anderson Janotti
Abstract: Altermagnetism is a newly identified phase of magnetism distinct from ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. RuO$_2$ has been considered a prototypical metallic altermagnet with a critical temperature higher than room temperature. Previous interpretations of the unusual magnetic properties of RuO$_2$ relied on the theoretical prediction that local moments on two Ru sublattices, which are connected by four-fold rotational symmetry, are quite significant (approximately 1 $\mu_B$), leading to long-range antiferromagnetic order. However, accumulated experimental data suggest that local moments on Ru in RuO$_2$ are vanishingly small, indicating that the bulk material is likely non-magnetic. This observation is consistent with the delocalized nature of the 4$d$ electrons of Ru and the strong screening effect in the metallic state. In this work, we show that despite the non-magnetic bulk, the RuO$_2$(110) surface exhibits spontaneous magnetization. We attribute this effect to the breaking of local symmetry, which results in electronic redistribution and magnetic moment enhancement. The emergence of surface magnetism gives rise to interesting spectroscopic phenomena, including spin-polarized surface states, spin-polarized scanning probe microscopy images, and potentially spin-dependent transport effects. These findings highlight the important role of surface magnetic structures in the otherwise non-magnetic bulk RuO$_2$.

Title: Linear-limit aging times of three monoalcohols
Authors: Jan Philipp Gabriel, Jeppe C. Dyre, Tina Hecksher
Abstract: This paper presents data for the physical aging of the three monoalcohols 2-ethyl-1-butanol, 5-methyl-2-hexanol, and 1-phenyl-1-propanol. Aging is studied by monitoring the dielectric loss at a fixed frequency in the kHz range following temperature jumps of a few Kelvin's magnitude, starting from states of equilibrium. The three alcohols differ in the Debye relaxation strength and how much the Debye process is separated from the $\alpha$ process. We first demonstrate that single-parameter aging describes all data well and proceed to utilize this fact to identify the linear-limit normalized aging relaxation functions. From the Laplace transform of these functions, the linear-limit aging loss-peak angular frequency defines the inverse of the linear aging relaxation time. This allows for a comparison to the temperature dependence of the Debye and $\alpha$ dielectric relaxation times of the three monoalcohols. We conclude that the aging response for 5-methyl-2-hexanol and 2-ethyl-1-butanol follows the $\alpha$ relaxation, not the Debye process, while no firm conclusion can be reached for 1-phenyl-1-propanol because its Debye and $\alpha$ processes are too close to be reliably distinguished.

Title: Dynamical Spreading and Memory Retention Under Power Law Potential
Authors: Ido Fanto, Yuval Rosenblum, Ori Harel, Naomi Oppenheimer
Abstract: Power law potentials dictate interactions across scales and matter, controlling the structure and dynamics of inanimate, and living systems. Though the equilibrium distributions of particles with a power law repulsion were extensively studied, their unconfined dynamical evolution gained far less attention -- Yet, living matter is inherently out of equilibrium and is seldom static. Here, we investigate the overdamped dynamic spreading of a dense suspension of particles under repulsive pair-potential of the form $1/r^k$. Coarse graining the pair interactions, we predict that the suspension spreads in a self-similar form, with its radius growing in time as $t^{1/(k+2)}$, independent of the spatial dimension ($d$). We confirm this prediction experimentally in quasi-two dimensions using perpendicularly magnetized colloids with dipolar repulsion ($k=3$). Numerical simulations corroborate the experiments for the $k=3$ case and further predict a categorically different behavior at a critical power law: when $k<d-2$, the initial distribution is no longer concentrated at the origin. Instead, particles accumulate at the perimeter and retain a long-lived memory of their original pattern. We demonstrate that below this threshold, the initial distribution seeds the resulting pattern, encoding the future structure of an unconfined, and dynamically evolving system.

Title: Uncertainty Quantification for Misspecified Machine Learned Interatomic Potentials
Authors: Danny Perez, Aparna P. A. Subramanyam, Ivan Maliyov, Thomas D. Swinburne
Abstract: The use of high-dimensional regression techniques from machine learning has significantly improved the quantitative accuracy of interatomic potentials. Atomic simulations can now plausibly target quantitative predictions in a variety of settings, which has brought renewed interest in robust means to quantify uncertainties on simulation results. In many practical settings, encompassing both classical and a large class of machine learning potentials, the dominant form of uncertainty is currently not due to lack of training data but to misspecification, namely the inability of any one choice of model parameters to exactly match all ab initio training data. However, Bayesian inference, the most common formal tool used to quantify uncertainty, is known to ignore misspecification and thus significantly underestimates parameter uncertainties. Here, we employ a recent misspecification-aware regression technique to quantify parameter uncertainties, which is then propagated to a broad range of phase and defect properties in tungsten via brute force resampling or implicit differentiation. The propagated misspecification uncertainties robustly envelope errors to direct \textit{ab initio} calculation of material properties outside of the training dataset, an essential requirement for any quantitative multi-scale modeling scheme. Finally, we demonstrate application to recent foundational machine learning interatomic potentials, accurately predicting and bounding errors in MACE-MPA-0 energy predictions across the diverse materials project database. Perspectives for the approach in multiscale simulation workflows are discussed.

Title: Dendrite suppression in fast-charging high-energy metal-ion batteries: a Bayesian optimization approach
Authors: Hamed Taghavian, Viktor Vanoppen, Erik Berg, Peter Broqvist, Jens Sjölund
Abstract: Metal anodes provide the highest possible energy density in batteries. However, challenges associated with electrode/electrolyte interface side reactions and dendrite growth remain unsolved, especially under fast-charging conditions. In this paper, we consider a phase-field model of electrodeposition and optimize its parameters for suppressing dendrite growth and accelerating charging speed under constant voltage. We identify interfacial mobility as a key parameter, which should be maximized to inhibit dendrites without compromising the charging speed. The proposed approach provides a versatile tool for designing battery cells by optimizing an arbitrary objective function using an arbitrary set of parameters. This approach is based on Bayesian optimization and explores the parameters space with a high sample efficiency and a low computation complexity. The results are verified using extended simulations of dendrite evolution in charging half cells with lithium-metal anodes.

Title: Spin wave interactions in the pyrochlore Heisenberg antiferromagnet with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions
Authors: V. V. Jyothis, Kallol Mondal, Himanshu Mavani, V. Ravi Chandra
Abstract: We study the effect of magnon interactions on the spin wave spectra of the all-in-all-out phase of the pyrochlore nearest neighbour antiferromagnet with a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction ($D$). The leading order corrections to spin wave energies indicate a significant renormalisation for commonly encountered strengths of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya term. For low values of $D$ we find a potential instability of the phase itself, indicated by the renormalisation of magnon frequencies to negative values. We have also studied the renormalized spectra in the presence of magnetic fields along three high symmetry directions of the lattice, namely the $[111]$, $[100]$ and $[110]$ directions. Generically, we find that for a fixed value of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction renormalized spectra for the lowest band decrease with an increasing strength of the field. We have also analyzed the limits of the two magnon continuum and probed the possibility of magnon decay. For a range of $D$ and the field strength we identify possible parameter regimes where the decay of the higher bands of the system are kinematically allowed.

Title: Site-Decorated Model for Unconventional Frustrated Magnets: Ultranarrow Phase Crossover and Spin Reversal Transition
Authors: Weiguo Yin
Abstract: The site-decorated Ising model is introduced to advance the understanding and experimental realization of the recently discovered one-dimensional finite-temperature ultranarrow phase crossover in an external magnetic field, while mitigating the geometric complexities of traditional bond-decorated models. Furthermore, although higher-dimensional Ising models in an external field remain unsolved, an exact solution for a novel spin-reversal transition -- driven by an exotic, hidden ``half-ice, half-fire'' state induced by site decoration -- is derived. This transition, triggered by a slight variation in temperature or magnetic field even in the weak-field limit, offers a promising route toward energy-efficient applications such as data storage and processing. The results establish site decoration as a compelling new avenue for materials and device design, particularly in systems such as mixed $d$-$f$ compounds, optical lattices, and neural networks.

Title: Predicted versatile topological nodal magnons in the icosahedral quasicrystal 1/1 approximants
Authors: Rintaro Eto, Masahito Mochizuki, Shinji Watanabe
Abstract: Using a recenly-estabilished band representation analysis, we discover two distinct types of topological nodal magnons in the real-space antiferroic ordering of whirling spin arrangements in the icosahedral quasicrystal 1/1 approximants, both of which originate from a composite band representation $A\uparrow P_In\bar{3}(24)$ and its constituent ${}^1E_g\uparrow P_In\bar{3}(8)$ (or ${}^2E_g\uparrow P_In\bar{3}(8)$). The first type is doubly-degenerate nodal line network and nodal planes associated with two-dimensional irreducible band representation, while the second type is a nodal line network due to accidental band inversions. Since our analysis, which relies solely on magnetocrystalline symmetry, is valid for a wide range of materials and spin textures belonging to the same magnetic space group irrespective of composition, these findings offer new universal insights into the research of quasicrystals and their approximants as well as a contribution to broadening the range of topological magnon-hosting materials.

Title: Asymptotic Freedom of Two Heavy Impurities in a Bose-Einstein Condensate
Authors: Dong-Chen Zheng, Lin Wen, Renyuan Liao
Abstract: We consider two heavy impurities immersed in a Bose-Einstein condensate, and calculate the self-energy using the Wilsonian renormalization. The polaron energy, quasiparticle residue and damping rate are extracted from the self-energy. We demonstrate that various effective potentials emerge from the polaron energy under the specific conditions. In the limit of large separation between the impurities, the polaron spectrum converges to the results for a single impurity, exhibiting an attractive-repulsive crossover across the Feshbach resonance. The boundary of this crossover is identified through the analysis of the damping rate. We highlight that repulsive-dominant polarons can exist as long as the impurities are sufficiently close, even when the impurity-boson interactions are attractive. Additionally, we observe that the two impurities become asymptotically free in the repulsive polaron regime. These results are verifiable and offer a fresh perspective on the interaction dynamics between two polarons.

Abstract: Following electronic processes in molecules and materials at the level of the quantum mechanical electron wavefunction with angstrom-level spatial resolution and with full access to its femtosecond temporal dynamics is at the heart of ultrafast condensed matter physics. A breakthrough invention allowing experimental access to electron wavefunctions was the reconstruction of molecular orbitals from angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy data in 2009, termed photoemission orbital tomography (POT). This invention puts ultrafast three-dimensional (3D) POT in reach, with many new prospects for the study of ultrafast light-matter interaction, femtochemistry and photo-induced phase transitions. Here, we develop a synergistic experimental-algorithmic approach to realize the first 3D-POT experiment using a short-pulse extreme ultraviolet light source. We combine a new variant of photoelectron spectroscopy, namely ultrafast momentum microscopy, with a table-top spectrally-tunable high-harmonic generation light source and a tailored algorithm for efficient 3D reconstruction from sparse, undersampled data. This combination dramatically speeds up the experimental data acquisition, while at the same time reducing the sampling requirements to achieve complete 3D information. We demonstrate the power of this approach by full 3D imaging of the frontier orbitals of a prototypical organic semiconductor absorbed on pristine Ag(110).

Title: Enhancing Magnetic Coupling in MN4-Graphene via Strain Engineering
Authors: Mahnaz Rezaei, Jahanfar Abouie, Fariba Nazari
Abstract: MN4-embedded graphene (MN4-G) layers, incorporating transition metal elements (M), represent a class of experimentally accessible two-dimensional materials with significant potential for stable nanoscale magnetization. In these systems, magnetic exchange interactions are primarily governed by Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) coupling, exhibiting an anomalously prolonged decay of r to the power of (-n), where r is the M-M separation distance and n is between 0.5 and 2. This study investigates the impact of strain on the electronic and magnetic properties of MN4-G layers using ab-initio density functional theory (DFT). A novel strain-engineering approach is developed by applying controlled tension or compression to the layers. Our findings reveal that strain significantly modulates the strength, amplitude, and decay rate of the RKKY coupling. Notably, the CoN4-G layer demonstrates a pronounced enhancement in RKKY coupling strength, oscillation amplitude, and reduced decay rate under strain. Conversely, the CuN4-G layer exhibits distinct behavior, maintaining decoupled spin chains and invariant electronic and magnetic properties despite applied strain. This work underscores the tunability of magnetic interactions in MN4-G layers via strain engineering, providing insights into the design of strain-controlled magnetic materials for next-generation spintronic applications.

Title: A generalized calculation of the rate independent single crystal yield surface
Authors: Matthew Kasemer, Paul R. Dawson
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss a method to calculate the topology of the rate independent single crystal yield surface for materials with arbitrary slip systems and arbitrary slip strengths. We describe the general problem, as motivated by Schmid's law, and detail the calculation of hyperplanes in deviatoric stress space, $\mathbb{D}^5$, which describe the criteria for slip on individual slip systems. We focus on finding the intersection of five linearly independent hyperplanes which represent stresses necessary to satisfy the criteria for general plastic deformation. Finally, we describe a method for calculating the inner convex hull of these intersection points, which describe the vertices of the five dimensional polytope that represents the single crystal yield surface. Our method applies to arbitrary crystal structure, allowing for an arbitrary number and type of slip systems and families, considers plastic anisotropy via inter- and intra-family strength anisotropy, and further considers strength anisotropy between slip in the positive and negative direction. We discuss the calculation and possible applications, and share a computational implementation of the calculation of the single crystal yield surface.

Abstract: We investigated the electrical properties of the liquid crystal compound, known as an RM734, exhibiting a ferroelectric nematic phase. The influence of alternating (AC) and direct (DC) current electric fields on the switching process of the polarization vector and dielectric constant of planarly aligned ferronematic and nematic phases were examined. The decrease of the real part of electric permittivity in the ferronematic phase and the creation of ferroelectric order in the nematic phase under the DC field were demonstrated. The analysis of the results reveals the latching of the ferroelectric state. The applied DC field created a ferroelectric mode in the nematic phase. A new model of collective and molecular relaxations considering the domain structure of the ferronematic phase was proposed. The temperature and DC field dependence of dielectric properties were shown. The spontaneous polarization was measured using the field reversal technique. The spontaneous polarization value exhibits a maximum at the fixed temperature.

Title: How human-derived brain organoids are built differently from brain organoids derived from genetically-close relatives: A multi-scale hypothesis
Authors: Tao Zhang, Sarthak Gupta, Madeline A. Lancaster, J. M. Schwarz
Abstract: How genes affect tissue scale organization remains a longstanding biological puzzle. As experimental efforts aim to quantify gene expression, chromatin organization, cellular structure, and tissue structure, computational modeling lags behind. To address this gap, we merge a cellular-based tissue model with a nuclear model that includes a deformable lamina shell and chromatin to test multiscale hypotheses linking chromatin and tissue scales. We propose a multiscale hypothesis focusing on brain organoids to explain structural differences between brain organoids built from induced-pluripotent human stem cells and induced-pluripotent gorilla and chimpanzee cells. Recent experiments discover that a cell fate transition from neuroepithelial to radial glial cells includes a new intermediate state delayed in human organoids, which narrows and lengthens cells on the apical side. Experiments show that the transcription factor ZEB2 plays a major role in the emergence of this intermediate state with ZEB2 mRNA levels peaking. We postulate that the enhancement of ZEB2 expression is potentially due to chromatin reorganization in response to mechanical deformations of the nucleus. A larger critical mechanical strain triggers reorganization in human-derived stem cells, causing delayed ZEB2 upregulation compared with genetically close relatives. We test this by exploring how slightly different initial configurations of chromatin reorganize under applied strain, with greater representing less genetically-close relatives. We find that larger configuration discrepancies produce increased differences in the magnitude of chromatin displacement that rise faster than linearly yet slower than exponentially. Changes in chromatin strain and contact maps can reveal species-specific differences, aiding our understanding of how one species differs in structure from another.

Title: BCS Critical Temperature on Half-Spaces
Authors: Barbara Roos, Robert Seiringer
Abstract: We study the BCS critical temperature on half-spaces in dimensions $d=1,2,3$ with Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions. We prove that the critical temperature on a half-space is strictly higher than on $\mathbb{R}^d$, at least at weak coupling in $d=1,2$ and weak coupling and small chemical potential in $d=3$. Furthermore, we show that the relative shift in critical temperature vanishes in the weak coupling limit.

Title: Quantum time dynamics mediated by the Yang-Baxter equation and artificial neural networks
Authors: Sahil Gulania, Yuri Alexeev, Stephen K. Gray, Bo Peng, Niranjan Govind
Abstract: Quantum computing shows great potential, but errors pose a significant challenge. This study explores new strategies for mitigating quantum errors using artificial neural networks (ANN) and the Yang-Baxter equation (YBE). Unlike traditional error mitigation methods, which are computationally intensive, we investigate artificial error mitigation. We developed a novel method that combines ANN for noise mitigation combined with the YBE to generate noisy data. This approach effectively reduces noise in quantum simulations, enhancing the accuracy of the results. The YBE rigorously preserves quantum correlations and symmetries in spin chain simulations in certain classes of integrable lattice models, enabling effective compression of quantum circuits while retaining linear scalability with the number of qubits. This compression facilitates both full and partial implementations, allowing the generation of noisy quantum data on hardware alongside noiseless simulations using classical platforms. By introducing controlled noise through the YBE, we enhance the dataset for error mitigation. We train an ANN model on partial data from quantum simulations, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating errors in time-evolving quantum states, providing a scalable framework to enhance quantum computation fidelity, particularly in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) systems. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach by performing quantum time dynamics simulations using the Heisenberg XY Hamiltonian on real quantum devices.

Title: Solute transport due to Periodic Loading in a Soft Porous Material
Authors: Matilde Fiori, Satyajit Pramanik, Christopher W. MacMinn
Abstract: In soft porous media, deformation drives solute transport via the intrinsic coupling between flow of the fluid and rearrangement of the pore structure. Solute transport driven by periodic loading, in particular, can be of great relevance in applications including the geomechanics of contaminants in the subsurface and the biomechanics of nutrient transport in living tissues and scaffolds for tissue engineering. However, the basic features of this process have not previously been systematically investigated. Here, we fill this hole in the context of a 1D model problem. We do so by expanding the results from a companion study, in which we explored the poromechanics of periodic deformations, by introducing and analysing the impact of the resulting fluid and solid motion on solute transport. We first characterise the independent roles of the three main mechanisms of solute transport in porous media -- advection, molecular diffusion, and hydrodynamic dispersion -- by examining their impacts on the solute concentration profile during one loading cycle. We next explore the impact of the transport parameters, showing how these alter the relative importance of diffusion and dispersion. We then explore the loading parameters by considering a range of loading periods -- from slow to fast, relative to the poroelastic timescale -- and amplitudes -- from infinitesimal to large. We show that solute spreading over several loading cycle increases monotonically with amplitude, but is maximised for intermediate periods because of the increasing poromechanical localisation of the flow and deformation near the permeable boundary as the period decreases.

Title: Grover's algorithm in a four-qubit silicon processor above the fault-tolerant threshold
Authors: Ian Thorvaldson, Dean Poulos, Christian M. Moehle, Saiful H. Misha, Hermann Edlbauer, Jonathan Reiner, Helen Geng, Benoit Voisin, Michael T. Jones, Matthew B. Donnelly, Luis F. Pena, Charles D. Hill, Casey R. Myers, Joris G. Keizer, Yousun Chung, Samuel K. Gorman, Ludwik Kranz, Michelle Y. Simmons
Abstract: Spin qubits in silicon are strong contenders for realizing a practical quantum computer. This technology has made remarkable progress with the demonstration of single and two-qubit gates above the fault-tolerant threshold and entanglement of up to three qubits. However, maintaining high fidelity operations while executing multi-qubit algorithms has remained elusive, only being achieved for two spin qubits to date due to the small qubit size, which makes it difficult to control qubits without creating crosstalk errors. Here, we use a four-qubit silicon processor with every operation above the fault tolerant limit and demonstrate Grover's algorithm with a ~95% probability of finding the marked state, one of the most successful implementations to date. Our four-qubit processor is made of three phosphorus atoms and one electron spin precision-patterned into 1.5 nm${}^2$ isotopically pure silicon. The strong resulting confinement potential, without additional confinement gates that can increase cross-talk, leverages the benefits of having both electron and phosphorus nuclear spins. Significantly, the all-to-all connectivity of the nuclear spins provided by the hyperfine interaction not only allows for efficient multi-qubit operations, but also provides individual qubit addressability. Together with the long coherence times of the nuclear and electron spins, this results in all four single qubit fidelities above 99.9% and controlled-Z gates between all pairs of nuclear spins above 99% fidelity. The high control fidelities, combined with >99% fidelity readout of all nuclear spins, allows for the creation of a three-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state with 96.2% fidelity, the highest reported for semiconductor spin qubits so far. Such nuclear spin registers can be coupled via electron exchange, establishing a path for larger scale fault-tolerant quantum processors.

Title: Imaginary-Stark Skin Effect
Authors: Heng Lin, Jinghui Pi, Yunyao Qi, Wei Qin, Franco Nori, Gui-Lu Long
Abstract: A unique phenomenon in non-Hermitian systems is the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), namely the boundary localization of continuous-spectrum eigenstates. However, studies on the NHSE in systems without translational invariance are still limited. Here, we unveil a new class of NHSE, dubbed the imaginary-Stark skin effect (ISSE), in a one-dimensional lossy lattice with a spatially increasing loss rate. This ISSE is beyond the framework of non-Bloch band theory and exhibits intriguing properties significantly different from the conventional NHSE. Specifically, the energy spectrum of our model has a T-shaped feature, with approximately half of the eigenstates localized at the left boundary. Furthermore, each skin mode can be expressed as a single stable, exponentially-decaying wave within the bulk region. Such peculiar behaviors are analyzed via the transfer-matrix method, whose eigendecomposition quantifies the formation of the ISSE. Our work provides new insights into the NHSE in systems without translational symmetry and contributes to the understanding of non-Hermitian systems.

Title: Schwinger-Keldysh nonperturbative field theory of open quantum systems beyond the Markovian regime: Application to spin-boson and spin-chain-boson models
Authors: Felipe Reyes-Osorio, Federico Garcia-Gaitan, David J. Strachan, Petr Plechac, Stephen R. Clark, Branislav K. Nikolic
Abstract: Open quantum systems with many interacting degrees of freedom pose a formidable challenge for presently available theoretical methods, especially when dissipative environment imposes non-Markovian dynamics on them with memory effects and revival of genuine quantum properties. Even the archetypical spin-boson model, where a single spin-1/2 interacts with an infinite bosonic bath, requires switching between methods for different choice of system and bath parameters. Here, we construct a field-theoretic framework as a single methodology that can handle many mutually interacting quantum spins of arbitrary value S, spatial dimensionality, system-bath coupling, bath temperature and spectral properties of the bath. Our framework combines Schwinger-Keldysh field theory (SKFT) with two-particle irreducible (2PI) action resumming a class of Feynman diagrams to an infinite order originating from 1/N expansion, where N is the number of Schwinger bosons to which the spin is mapped. Remarkably, the SKFT+2PI approach closely tracks numerically exact benchmarks for spin-boson in the non-Markovian regime obtained from hierarchical equations of motion or tensor network methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of our SKFT+2PI framework to compute two-spin correlators of an antiferromagnetic quantum spin chain whose edge spins are coupled to a set of three bosonic baths (one for each spin component) at different temperatures. The favorable numerical cost of solving integro-differential equations produced by SKFT+2PI framework with increasing number of spins, time steps or spatial dimensionality makes it a promising route for simulation of driven-dissipative systems in quantum computing or quantum magnonics and quantum spintronics in the presence of a single or multiple dissipative environments.

Title: Measurement of Many-Body Quantum Correlations in Superconducting Circuits
Authors: Kamal Sharma, Wade DeGottardi
Abstract: Recent advances in superconducting circuit technology have made the fabrication of large, customizable circuits routine. This has led to their application to areas beyond quantum information and, in particular, to their use as quantum simulators. A key challenge in this effort has been the identification of the quantum states realized by these circuits. Here, we propose a probe circuit capable of reading out many-body correlations in an analog quantum simulator. Our measurement scheme, designed for many-photon states, exploits the non-linearity of the Josephson junction to measure two-point (and potentially higher-order) correlation functions of the superconducting phase operator. We demonstrate the capabilities of this design in the context of an LC-ladder with a quantum impurity. The proposed probe allows for the measurement of inherently quantum correlations, such as squeezing, and has the potential to significantly expand the scope of analog quantum simulations using superconducting circuits.

Title: Quantum origin of Ohm's reciprocity relation and its violation: conductivity as inverse resistivity
Authors: Giorgio Frangi, Sašo Grozdanov
Abstract: Conventional wisdom teaches us that the electrical conductivity in a material is the inverse of its resistivity. In this work, we show that when both of these transport coefficients are defined in linear response through the Kubo formulae as two-point correlators of conserved currents in quantum field theory, this Ohm's reciprocity relation is generically violated in theories with dynamical electromagnetism. We then elucidate how in certain special limits (e.g., in the DC limit in the presence of thermal effects, in certain 2+1$d$ conformal theories, and in holographic supersymmetric theories) the reciprocity relation is reinstated as an emergent property of conductive and resistive transport. We also show that if the response of a material is measured with respect to the total electric field that includes quantum corrections, then the reciprocity relation is satisfied by definition. However, in that case, the transport coefficients are given by the photon vacuum polarisation and not the correlators of conserved currents that dominate the hydrodynamic macroscopic late-time transport.

Title: Dark matter droplets
Authors: Ian G Moss
Abstract: A new model for dark matter is put forward which consists of uniform droplets of Bose Einstein condensate. In this model, structure forms rapidly, shortly after the hot big bang plasma de-ionises. The model also produces modifications to the expansion rate before droplet formation that affect the measurement of cosmological parameters from Cosmic Microwave Background data. The model could contribute to explaining why observations at high redshift see anomalously high structure formation and predict low values for the Hubble constant.

Title: Multi-block chemometric approaches to the unsupervised spectral characterization of geological samples
Authors: Beatriz Galindo-Prieto, Ian S. Mudway, Johan Linderholm, Paul Geladi
Abstract: As an example for the potential use of multi-block chemometric methods to provide improved unsupervised characterization of compositionally complex materials through the integration of multi-modal spectrometric data sets, we analysed spectral data derived from five field instruments (one XRF, two NIR, and two FT-Raman), collected on 76 bedrock samples of diverse composition. These data were analysed by single- and multi- block latent variable models, based on principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares (PLS). For the single-block approach, PCA and PLS models were generated; whilst hierarchical partial least squares (HPLS) regression was applied for the multi-block modelling. We also tested whether dimensionality reduction resulted in a more computationally efficient muti-block HPLS model with enhanced model interpretability and geological characterization power using the variable influence on projection (VIP) feature selection method. The results showed differences in the characterization power of the five spectrometer data sets for the bedrock samples based on their mineral composition and geological properties; moreover, some spectroscopic techniques under-performed for distinguishing samples by composition. The multi-block HPLS and its VIP-strengthened model yielded a more complete unsupervised geological aggrupation of the samples in a single parsimonious model. We conclude that multi-block HPLS models are effective at combining multi-modal spectrometric data to provide a more comprehensive characterization of compositionally complex samples, and VIP can reduce HPLS model complexity, while increasing its data interpretability. These approaches have been applied here to a geological data set, but are amenable to a broad range of applications across chemical and biomedical disciplines.

Title: Optimal Protocols for Continual Learning via Statistical Physics and Control Theory
Authors: Francesco Mori, Stefano Sarao Mannelli, Francesca Mignacco
Abstract: Artificial neural networks often struggle with catastrophic forgetting when learning multiple tasks sequentially, as training on new tasks degrades the performance on previously learned tasks. Recent theoretical work has addressed this issue by analysing learning curves in synthetic frameworks under predefined training protocols. However, these protocols relied on heuristics and lacked a solid theoretical foundation assessing their optimality. In this paper, we fill this gap by combining exact equations for training dynamics, derived using statistical physics techniques, with optimal control methods. We apply this approach to teacher-student models for continual learning and multi-task problems, obtaining a theory for task-selection protocols maximising performance while minimising forgetting. Our theoretical analysis offers non-trivial yet interpretable strategies for mitigating catastrophic forgetting, shedding light on how optimal learning protocols modulate established effects, such as the influence of task similarity on forgetting. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings with experiments on real-world data.

Title: Failure of the large-N expansion in a Bosonic Tensor Model
Authors: Aidan Herderschee, Michael Winer
Abstract: We study the tensor model generalization of the quantum $p$-spherical model in the large-$N$ limit. While the tensor model has the same large-$N$ expansion as the disordered quantum $p$-spherical model, its ground state is superextensive, in contradiction with large-$N$ perturbation theory. Therefore, the large-$N$ expansion of this model catastrophically fails at arbitrarily large-$N$, without any obvious signal in perturbation theory.

Title: Probing the Latent Hierarchical Structure of Data via Diffusion Models
Authors: Antonio Sclocchi, Alessandro Favero, Noam Itzhak Levi, Matthieu Wyart
Abstract: High-dimensional data must be highly structured to be learnable. Although the compositional and hierarchical nature of data is often put forward to explain learnability, quantitative measurements establishing these properties are scarce. Likewise, accessing the latent variables underlying such a data structure remains a challenge. In this work, we show that forward-backward experiments in diffusion-based models, where data is noised and then denoised to generate new samples, are a promising tool to probe the latent structure of data. We predict in simple hierarchical models that, in this process, changes in data occur by correlated chunks, with a length scale that diverges at a noise level where a phase transition is known to take place. Remarkably, we confirm this prediction in both text and image datasets using state-of-the-art diffusion models. Our results show how latent variable changes manifest in the data and establish how to measure these effects in real data using diffusion models.

Title: Machine-learned nodal structures of Fermion systems
Authors: William Freitas, B. Abreu, S. A. Vitiello
Abstract: Simulating strongly correlated fermionic systems remains a fundamental challenge in quantum physics, largely due to the sign problem in quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods. We present a neural network-based variational Monte Carlo (NN-VMC) approach, leveraging a flexible neural network ansatz to represent the many-body wavefunction. Focusing on quantum dots with up to 30 electrons, we demonstrate that NN-VMC significantly reduces variational bias and achieves ground-state energies surpassing those of fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC). A key feature is that the neural network adaptively learns and optimizes nodal structures during energy minimization. We provide qualitative insights into the nodal structure of fermionic wavefunctions by comparing the nodal structures generated by NN-VMC with those obtained from traditional trial functions. Additionally, we reveal spin-resolved radial distributions and electron density profiles, highlighting the versatility and accuracy of NN-VMC. This work underscores the potential of machine learning to advance quantum simulations and deepen our understanding of strongly correlated systems.

Title: Probing the limitations of multimodal language models for chemistry and materials research
Authors: Nawaf Alampara, Mara Schilling-Wilhelmi, Martiño Ríos-García, Indrajeet Mandal, Pranav Khetarpal, Hargun Singh Grover, N. M. Anoop Krishnan, Kevin Maik Jablonka
Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have sparked interest in scientific assistants that could support researchers across the full spectrum of scientific workflows, from literature review to experimental design and data analysis. A key capability for such systems is the ability to process and reason about scientific information in both visual and textual forms - from interpreting spectroscopic data to understanding laboratory setups. Here, we introduce MaCBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating how vision-language models handle real-world chemistry and materials science tasks across three core aspects: data extraction, experimental understanding, and results interpretation. Through a systematic evaluation of leading models, we find that while these systems show promising capabilities in basic perception tasks - achieving near-perfect performance in equipment identification and standardized data extraction - they exhibit fundamental limitations in spatial reasoning, cross-modal information synthesis, and multi-step logical inference. Our insights have important implications beyond chemistry and materials science, suggesting that developing reliable multimodal AI scientific assistants may require advances in curating suitable training data and approaches to training those models.

Title: Chemical potential and variable number of particles control the quantum state: Quantum oscillators as a showcase
Authors: Benedikt M. Reible, Ana Djurdjevac, Luigi Delle Site
Abstract: Despite their simplicity, quantum harmonic oscillators are ubiquitous in the modeling of physical systems. They are able to capture universal properties that serve as reference for the more complex systems found in nature. In this spirit, we apply a model of a Hamiltonian for open quantum systems in equilibrium with a particle reservoir to ensembles of quantum oscillators. By treating (i) a dilute gas of vibrating particles and (ii) a chain of coupled oscillators as showcases, we demonstrate that the property of varying number of particles leads to a mandatory condition on the energy of the system. In particular, the chemical potential plays the role of a parameter of control that can externally manipulate the spectrum of a system and the corresponding accessible quantum states.

Title: Multi-scale physics of cryogenic liquid helium-4: Inverse coarse-graining properties of smoothed particle hydrodynamics
Authors: Satori Tsuzuki
Abstract: Our recent numerical studies on cryogenic liquid helium-4 strongly indicate the features of multiscale physics that can be identified using the Landau's two-fluid model. This study presents the possibility that two-fluid models based on classical and quantum hydrodynamics have a relationship between the scale transformation using filtering in large eddy simulations (LES) and the inverse scale transformation using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). We show that the spin angular momentum conservation term, which we previously introduced into the two-fluid model as a quantum mechanical correction, formally corresponds to the subgrid-scale (SGS) model, which can be derived from the scale transformation of the two-fluid model from quantum to classical hydrodynamics. Our theoretical analysis shows that solving the two-fluid model based on classical hydrodynamics using SPH can reproduce the microscopic fluctuations even at the macroscopic scale because the truncation errors owing to the smoothing kernel approximation can substitute the microscopic fluctuations. In particular, the fluctuations can be amplified according to the size of the kernel radius at the macroscopic scale. Our further theoretical analysis shows that the Condiff viscosity model can serve as an SGS model and incorporate the quantum vortex interactions into the two-fluid model. Our results and discussion provide new insights into the microscopic composition of the cryogenic liquid helium-4 within a multiscale framework. First, a normal fluid can be a mixture of inviscid and viscous fluid particles. Second, a flow identified as a normal fluid on the microscopic scale because of the presence of molecular viscosity is still classified as an inviscid fluid on the hydrodynamic scale because its viscosity is insufficient to produce eddy viscosity.

Title: Radiation sputtering of hydrocarbon ices at Europa-relevant temperatures
Authors: Sankhabrata Chandra, Bryana L. Henderson, Murthy S. Gudipati
Abstract: The surfaces of some icy moons, such as Jupiter's moon Europa, are heavily bombarded by energetic particles that can alter the surface materials and affect the composition of its exosphere. Detection of CO2 on Europa's surface indicate that Europa's interior may be transporting freshly exposed carbon-containing material to the surface. It is unknown whether this CO2 is a product of radiation of carbon-containing precursors or whether it is present in the initial deposits. Regardless, further radiolysis by high-energy electrons or ions can sputter CO2 (and organic fragments if present) into Europa's exosphere. In this study, we investigate the radiation sputtering of CO2 and organic fragments from hydrocarbon water ice mixtures at different Europa-relevant surface temperatures to identify how its sputtering products evolve over time. This study shows that the sputtering of hydrocarbon water ice leads to the production of mostly CO2, CO, and fragmented hydrocarbons. The onset of sputtered hydrocarbons is immediate, and quickly reaches a steady state, whereas CO2 and CO are formed more gradually. It is found that higher temperatures cause more sputtering, and that there are some notable differences in the distribution of species that are sputtered at different temperatures, indicating local heterogeneity of sputtering yields depending on the surface temperature.

Title: Observation of the quantum equivalence principle for matter-waves
Authors: Or Dobkowski, Barak Trok, Peter Skakunenko, Yonathan Japha, David Groswasser, Maxim Efremov, Chiara Marletto, Ivette Fuentes, Roger Penrose, Vlatko Vedral, Wolfgang P. Schleich, Ron Folman
Abstract: Einstein's general theory of relativity is based on the principle of equivalence - in essence, dating back to Galileo - which asserts that, locally, the effect of a gravitational field is equivalent to that of an accelerating reference frame, so that the local gravitational field is eliminated in a freely-falling frame. Einstein's theory enables this principle to extend to a global description of relativistic space-time, at the expense of allowing space-time to become curved, realising a consistent frame-independent description of nature at the classical level. Einstein's theory has been confirmed to great accuracy for astrophysical bodies. However, in the quantum domain the equivalence principle has been predicted to take a unique form involving a gauge phase that is observable if the wavefunction - fundamental to quantum descriptions - allows an object to interfere with itself after being simultaneously at rest in two differently accelerating frames, one being the laboratory (Newtonian) frame and the other in the freely-falling (Einsteinian) frame. To measure this gauge phase we realise a novel cold-atom interferometer in which one wave packet stays static in the laboratory frame while the other is in free fall. We follow the relative-phase evolution of the wave packets in the two frames, confirming the equivalence principle in the quantum domain. Our observation is yet another fundamental test of the interface between quantum theory and gravity. The new interferometer also opens the door for further probing of the latter interface, as well as to searches for new physics.

Title: Spin-$s$ $Q$-systems: Twist and Open Boundaries
Authors: Yi-Jun He, Jue Hou, Yi-Chao Liu, Zi-Xi Tan
Abstract: In integrable spin chains, the spectral problem can be solved by the method of Bethe ansatz, which transforms the problem of diagonalization of the Hamiltonian into the problem of solving a set of algebraic equations named Bethe equations. In this work, we systematically investigate the spin-$s$ XXX chain with twisted and open boundary conditions using the rational $Q$-system, which is a powerful tool to solve Bethe equations. We establish basic frameworks of the rational $Q$-system and confirm its completeness numerically in both cases. For twisted boundaries, we investigate the polynomiality conditions of the rational $Q$-system and derive physical conditions for singular solutions of Bethe equations. For open boundaries, we uncover novel phenomena such as hidden symmetries and magnetic strings under specific boundary parameters. Hidden symmetries lead to the appearance of extra degeneracies in the Hilbert space, while the magnetic string is a novel type of exact string configuration, whose length depends on the boundary magnetic fields. These findings, supported by both analytical and numerical evidences, offer new insights into the interplay between symmetries and boundary conditions.
