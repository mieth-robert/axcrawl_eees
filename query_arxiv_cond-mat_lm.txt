Abstract: The transmission of 2-keV electrons through a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) nanocapillary with a diameter of 800 nm and a length of 10 {\mu}m is studied. The transmitted electrons are detected using a microchannel plate (MCP) with a phosphor screen. It is found that the transmission rate for the transmitted electrons at the incident energy can reach up to 10% for an aligned capillary in the beam direction, but drops to less than 1% when the tilt angle exceeds the geometrically allowable angle. The transmitted electrons with the incident energy do not move with changes in the tilt angle, so the incident electrons are not guided in the insulating capillary, which is different from the behavior of positive ions. In the final stage of transmission, the angular distribution of the transmitted electrons within the geometrically allowable angle splits into two peaks along the observation angle perpendicular to the tilt angle. The time evolution of the transmitted complete angular distribution shows that when the beam is turned on, the transmission profile forms a single peak. As the incident charge and time accumulate, the transmission profile begins to stretch in the plane perpendicular to the tilt angle and gradually splits into two peaks. When the tilt angle of the nanocapillary exceeds the geometrically allowable angle, this splitting tends to disappear. Simulation of charge deposition in the capillary directly exposed to the beam indicates the formation of positive charge patches, which are not conducive to guiding, unlike positive ions. Based on the simulation results, we can explain our data and discuss the possible reasons for the splitting of the transmission angular profiles.

Title: Instability of the critical Ngai's coupling and two-boson mechanism in metals
Authors: Phu Nguyen, Vladyslav Kozii
Abstract: We study the properties of a Fermi liquid coupled to a quantum critical boson via the two-boson interaction known as Ngai's coupling. We find that the original quantum critical point is generally unstable, resulting in a finite-momentum spatially modulated state unless two conditions are satisfied: (i) the critical boson is polar and transverse, and (ii) the ratio of the Fermi velocity to the transverse-boson velocity is sufficiently large. If these conditions hold and the uniform state remains stable, we demonstrate that the system enters a strong-coupling regime below a certain energy scale. In this regime, we discuss a self-consistent solution at criticality in two-dimensional systems and show that the critical boson field develops a nontrivial anomalous dimension, $\eta=1/2$. Our findings highlight the significant role of two-boson coupling in critical theories, challenging the conventional view that its effects are subdominant to linear coupling.

Abstract: Moiré superlattices in semiconductors are predicted to exhibit a rich variety of interaction-induced topological states. However, experimental demonstrations of such topological states, apart from MoTe2 superlattices, have remained scarce. Here, we report the first optical detection of quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) states in twisted WSe2 homobilayer (tWSe2). Specifically, we employ polarization-resolved attractive polaron spectroscopy on a dual-gated, 2 degree tWSe2 and observe direct signatures of spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking at hole filling {\nu} = 1. Together with a Chern number (C) measurement via Streda formula analysis, we identify this magnetized state as a topological state, characterized by C = 1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these topological and magnetic properties are tunable via a finite displacement field, between a QAH ferromagnetic state and an antiferromagnetic state. Our findings position tWSe2 as a highly versatile, stable, and optically addressable platform for investigating topological order and strong correlations in two-dimensional landscapes.

Title: Reconstructions and Dynamics of $β$-Lithium Thiophosphate Surfaces
Authors: Hanna Türk, Davide Tisi, Michele Ceriotti
Abstract: Lithium thiophosphate (LPS) is a promising solid electrolyte for next-generation lithium-ion batteries due to its superior energy storage, high ionic conductivity, and low-flammability components. Despite its potential, the high reactivity of LPS with common contaminants such as atmospheric water, preparation solvents, and electrode materials poses significant challenges for commercialization. The lack of understanding regarding the structure, morphology, and chemical behavior of LPS's surface slows down the search for solutions to these issues. Here, we utilize a machine learning interatomic potential to achieve a fundamental, atomistic understanding of the mechanical and chemical properties of the $\beta$-Li$_3$PS$_4$ surfaces. Employing molecular dynamics simulations, we identify relevant surface complexions formed by surface reconstructions, determine their surface energies and compute the Wulff shape of $\beta$-LPS. The most stable complexions exhibit properties distinctly different from the bulk, including amorphization, increased density, decreased conductivity and large deformation of the structure building blocks. We demonstrate that these surfaces are not static, but undergo significant dynamical activity which is clearly identified by an analysis featuring a time-averaged structural descriptor. Finally, we examine the changes of the electronic structure induced by the surface complexions, which provides us with details on changes in surface reactivity and active sites, underlining the importance to investigate surface complexions under realistic conditions.

Title: Dynamical electronic correlation and chiral magnetism in van der Waals magnet Fe4GeTe2
Authors: Md. Nur Hasan, Nastaran Salehi, Felix Sorgenfrei, Anna Delin, Igor Di Marco, Anders Bergman, Manuel Pereiro, Patrik Thunström, Olle Eriksson, Debjani Karmakar
Abstract: Among the quasi-2D van der Waals magnetic systems, Fe4GeTe2 imprints a profound impact due to its near-room temperature ferromagnetic behaviour and the complex magnetothermal phase diagram exhibiting multiple phase transformations, as observed from magnetization and magnetotransport measurements. A complete analysis of these phase transformations in the light of electronic correlation and its impact on the underlying magnetic interactions remain unattended in the existing literature. Using first-principles methodologies, incorporating the dynamical nature of electron correlation, we have analysed the interplay of the direction of magnetization in the easy-plane and easy-axis manner with the underlying crystal symmetry, which reveals the opening of a pseudogap feature beyond the spin-reorientation transition (SRT) temperature. The impact of dynamical correlation on the calculated magnetic circular dichroism and x-ray absorption spectrum of the L-edge of the Fe atoms compared well with the existing experimental observations. The calculated intersite Heisenberg exchange interactions display a complicated nature, depending upon the pairwise interactions among the two inequivalent Fe sites, indicating a RKKY-like behaviour of the magnetic interactions. We noted the existence of significant anisotropic and antisymmetric exchanges interactions, resulting into a chirality in the magnetic behaviour of the system. Subsequent investigation of the dynamical aspects of magnetism in Fe4GeTe2 and the respective magnetothermal phase diagram reveal that the dynamical nature of spins and the decoupling of the magnetic properties for both sites of Fe is crucial to explain all the experimentally observed phase transformations.

Title: X-ray scattering investigation of hydride surface segregation in epitaxial Nb films
Authors: David A. Garcia-Wetten, Philip J. Ryan, Jong Woo Kim, Dominic P Goronzy, Roger J. Reinertsen, Mark C. Hersam, Michael J. Bedzyk
Abstract: Hydride precipitation in niobium-based, superconducting circuits is a damaging side-effect of hydrofluoric acid treatments used to clean and thin the Nb surface oxides and Si oxides. The precipitate microstructure is difficult to probe because of the high hydrogen mobility in the niobium matrix. In particular, destructive techniques used to prepare samples for elemental depth profiling can change the hydride structure. Here, we use X-ray surface scattering to non-destructively probe the depth distribution of precipitates in hydrided, epitaxial, niobium thin films. We find that the niobium hydride is confined within the top ten nm of the surface.

Title: A statistical understanding of oxygen vacancies in distorted high-entropy oxides
Authors: Adam Potter, Yifan Wang, Dongjae Kong, Yuzhe Li, Jian Qin, Xiaolin Zheng
Abstract: High entropy perovskite oxides (HEPOs) have emerged as a promising family of stable electrode materials for high-temperature water splitting. The concentration of oxygen vacancies in HEPOs significantly influences critical properties, such as the ionic conductivity and thermal expansion coefficient. However, predicting their concentration in HEPOs remains a challenge due to the complex and high-entropic arrangements of metal cations. Here, we employ a combined experimental, computational, and theoretical approach to quantify the oxygen vacancy concentration and understand its dependence on the A-site cation compositions of HEPOs. While we found that the concentration of the A-site 2+ cation influences the oxygen vacancy concentration, as expected, this factor alone is insufficient. Our findings reveal that variations in A-site cation size constitute another crucial factor in affecting the oxygen vacancy concentration. We investigated this dependence through atomistic simulations using a machine-learned universal interatomic potential, demonstrating that the lattice distortions from A-site size variations result in a broadened distribution of oxygen vacancy formation energies. Our theoretical analysis, grounded in statistical thermodynamics, further provides formulations for the enthalpy and entropy of oxygen vacancy formation as functions of variance in oxygen bonding energy. Overall, our experimental, computational, and theoretical findings consistently highlight the significant impact of A-site cation site variations on the oxygen vacancy concentration in perovskites, providing a new approach to adjusting the oxygen vacancy concentrations in these materials.

Title: On the microplasticity and dynamic strain aging in an FeAlCrMo complex-concentrated alloy
Authors: Tomáš Tayari, Michal Knapek, Eliška Jača, Peter Minárik, Josef Pešička
Abstract: We show by acoustic emission analysis that FeAlCrMo complex-concentrated alloy (CCA) exhibits signatures of self-organization of deformation processes during both microplasticity and serrated flow (dynamic strain aging). Due to complex microstructures of CCAs and scarcity of literature data, these novel alloys are a prominent subject of future research efforts.

Title: Relation of Continuous Chirality Measure to Spin and Orbital Polarization, and Chiroptical Properties in Solids
Authors: Andrew Grieder, Shihao Tu, Yuan Ping
Abstract: Chirality introduces intriguing topological, electronic, and optical properties to molecules and solids. In this work, we investigate the influence of structural chirality on spin and orbital polarization as well as optical activity through first-principles calculations and continuous chirality measure (CCM). By using chiral selenium (Se) and 2D hybrid perovskites as examples, we demonstrate that chirality continuously modifies spin-orbit splitting and orbital angular momentum (OAM) polarization. We establish a direct relation between chirality transfer across organic-inorganic interfaces and inversion symmetry breaking, which induces Rashba-Dresselhaus spin splitting in hybrid perovskites. Additionally, we examine the effects of chirality on circular dichroism (CD) and the circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE), demonstrating how the continuous tuning of chirality dictates their magnitude and anisotropy. Our findings highlight that applying hydrostatic pressure can effectively tune the CCM, thereby enhancing the chirality-induced effects such as spin selectivity. By integrating CCM with electronic structure calculations, we present a predictive strategy for designing chiral materials with tailored optical and spintronic functionalities.

Title: Identifying high performance spectrally-stable quantum defects in diamond
Authors: Yihuang Xiong, Yizhi Zhu, Shay McBride, Sinéad M. Griffin, Geoffroy Hautier
Abstract: Point defects in semiconductors are becoming central to quantum technologies. They can be used as spin qubits interfacing with photons, which are fundamental for building quantum networks. Currently, the most prominent quantum defect in diamond is the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center. However, it suffers from spectral diffusion that negatively impacts optical coherence and is due to the coupling of the emission energy with uncontrolled electric fields. The group IV vacancy complexes on the other hand have shown to be significantly more spectrally-stable as they are centrosymmetric and thus immune to the linear Stark shift. They however suffer from several issues ranging from low operation temperature to low optical efficiency due to dark states and difficulty in stabilizing the right defect charge state. Here we search for alternative to the group IV vacancy complex in diamond by systematically evaluating all possible vacancy complex using high-throughput first-principles computational screening. We identify the defects that combine centrosymmetry, emission in the visible range, as well as favorable and achievable electronic structure promoting higher operation temperature and defect levels well within the band gap. We find Zn$V^{-2}$ to be especially appealing.

Title: Practical considerations for crystallographic and microstructure mapping with direct electron detector-based electron backscatter diffraction
Authors: Tianbi Zhang, Ruth Birch, Graeme Francolini, Ebru Karakurt Uluscu, Ben Britton
Abstract: Compact direct electron detectors are becoming increasingly popular in electron microscopy applications including electron backscatter diffraction, as they offer an opportunity for low cost and accessible microstructural analysis. In this work, we explore how one of these commercial devices based on the Timepix chip can be optimized to obtain high quality data quickly and easily, through careful systematic analysis of a variety of samples, including: semiconductor silicon, commercially pure nickel, a dual phase titanium-molybdenum alloy, and a silicon carbide ceramic matrix composite. Our findings provide strategies for very fast collection of orientation maps, including at low voltage (5-10 keV) and low beam current conditions. Additionally, strategies for collection of very high quality EBSD patterns are demonstrated that have significant potential for advanced EBSD applications (e.g. elastic strain mapping).

Title: Uncertainty Quantification in Multiscale Modeling of Polymer Composite Materials Using Physically Recurrent Neural Networks
Authors: N. Kovács (1, 2), I.B.C.M. Rocha (2), F.P. van der Meer (2), C. Furtado (1), P.P. Camanho (1) ((1) INEGI, Faculdade de Engenharia, Universidade do Porto, (2) Delft University of Technology, Department of Civil Engineering and Geosciences)
Abstract: This study investigates whether Physically Recurrent Neural Networks (PRNNs), a recent surrogate model for heterogeneous materials, trained on a micromodel with fixed material parameters, can maintain accuracy for varying material properties without retraining, and propagate uncertainty in a multiscale framework. Unlike conventional RNNs, where parameter changes require training or explicit inclusion of material properties as extra input features, PRNNs embeds material models in their material layer that allow for modification of material parameters after training. When adjusting material properties dynamically according to the input during testing, PRNN shows high accuracy across a wide range of parameters. Therefore the surrogate can be applied to multiscale uncertainty quantification (UQ). Compared to the full-order simulations on an overly coarse mesh, the PRNN-driven model reduces simulation time by over 7000 times while accurately capturing highly nonlinear evolution of the probability density for the macroscopic response as a result of a given distribution for microscale material parameters. A PRNN-driven UQ is demonstrated on a more accurate finer mesh that would be computationally infeasible with the full-order model.

Authors: Joel Bobadilla, Marcelo J. Rozenberg, Alberto Camjayi
Abstract: We investigate the magnetotransport properties of the half-filled antiferromagnetic (AF) one-band Hubbard model under an external magnetic field using the single-site dynamical mean-field approximation (DMFT). Particular attention is paid to the mechanisms driving the magnetoresistivity behavior. We analyze the dependence of magnetoresistivity on temperature and the strength of the applied magnetic field, providing insights into the interplay between magnetic fluctuations and transport properties in AF systems.

Title: Towards High-Voltage Cathodes for Zinc-Ion Batteries: Discovery Pipeline and Material Design Rules
Authors: Roberta Pascazio (1 and 2), Qian Chen (1,2 and 3), Haoming Howard Li (1 and 2), Aaron D. Kaplan (2), Kristin A. Persson (1 and 2) ((1) University of California, Berkeley, (2) Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (3), Toyota Research Institute of North America)
Abstract: Efficient energy storage systems are crucial to address the intermittency of renewable energy sources. As multivalent batteries, Zn-ion batteries (ZIBs), while inherently low voltage, offer a promising low cost alternative to Li-ion batteries due to viable use of zinc as the anode. However, to maximize the potential impact of ZIBs, rechargable cathodes with improved Zn diffusion are needed. To better understand the chemical and structural factors influencing Zn-ion mobility within battery electrode materials, we employ a high-throughput computational screening approach to systematically evaluate candidate intercalation hosts for ZIB cathodes, expanding the chemical search space on empty intercalation hosts that do not contain Zn. We leverage a high-throughput screening funnel to identify promising cathodes in ZIBs, integrating screening criteria with DFT-based calculations of Zn$^{2+}$ intercalation and diffusion inside the host materials. Using this data, we identify the design principles that favor Zn-ion mobility in candidate cathode materials. Building on previous work on divalent ion cathodes, this study broadens the chemical space for next-generation multivalent energy storage systems.

Title: Predominant Electronic Order Parameter for Structural Chirality -- Role of Spinless Electronic Toroidal Multipoles
Authors: Rikuto Oiwa, Hiroaki Kusunose
Abstract: We discuss predominant order parameters for structural chirality, and demonstrate that time-reversal-even axial-quadrupole plays a key role in stabilizing a chiral structure. Using the symmetry-adapted closest Wannier model of the trigonal Te and Se, we quantify the evolution of the spin-independent (spinless) and spin-dependent (spinful) electric toroidal (ET) (axial) multipole moments across the transition from an achiral to a chiral structure. Our results clearly identify that a spin-independent off-diagonal real hopping between $p$ orbitals, which corresponds to the bond-cluster spinless ET quadrupole of $(3z^{2}-r^{2})$ type $G_{u}$, is the predominant order parameter in stabilizing helical structures. We further elucidate that the above itinerant spinless ET quadrupole induces a monopole-like orbital angular momentum texture in the momentum space, which can be observed via circular-dichroism in soft x-ray photoemission spectroscopy measurement. Our findings highlight a critical role of the orbital angular momentum in chiral materials rather than less dominant spin angular momentum arising from the relativistic spin-orbit coupling.

Title: Velocity Distribution and Diffusion of an Athermal Inertial Run-and-Tumble Particle in a Shear-Thinning Medium
Authors: Sayantan Mondal, Prasenjit Das
Abstract: We study the dynamics of an athermal inertial active particle moving in a shear-thinning medium in $d=1$. The viscosity of the medium is modeled using a Coulomb-tanh function, while the activity is represented by an asymmetric dichotomous noise with strengths $-\Delta$ and $\mu\Delta$, transitioning between these states at a rate $\lambda$. Starting from the Fokker-Planck~(FP) equation for the time-dependent probability distributions $P(v,-\Delta,t)$ and $P(v,\mu\Delta,t)$ of the particle's velocity $v$ at time $t$, moving under the influence of active forces $-\Delta$ and $\mu\Delta$ respectively, we analytically derive the steady-state velocity distribution function $P_s(v)$, explicitly dependent on $\mu$. Also, we obtain a quadrature expression for the effective diffusion coefficient $D_e$ for the symmetric active force case~($\mu=1$). For a given $\Delta$ and $\mu$, we show that $P_s(v)$ exhibits multiple transitions as $\lambda$ is varied. Subsequently, we numerically compute $P_s(v)$, the mean-squared velocity $\langle v^2\rangle(t)$, and the diffusion coefficient $D_e$ by solving the particle's equation of motion, all of which show excellent agreement with the analytical results in the steady-state. Finally, we examine the universal nature of the transitions in $P_s(v)$ by considering an alternative functional form of medium's viscosity that also capture the shear-thinning behavior.

Title: Epitaxial formation of ultrathin HfO2 on graphene by sequential oxidation
Authors: Zhenjing Liu, Qian Mao, Varun Kamboj, Rishabh Kothari, Paul Miller, Kate Reidy, Adri C. T. van Duin, R. Jaramillo, Frances M. Ross
Abstract: We demonstrate the formation of epitaxial, ultrathin hafnia (HfO2) on graphene. Monoclinic hafnia (m-HfO2) forms as the end of a series of sequential oxidation reactions. Starting from Hf metal grown epitaxially on graphene, oxidation leads first to an amorphous suboxide (a-HfOx), then to a crystalline, hexagonal suboxide (h-HfOx) in epitaxial relationship with the substrate, and finally to m-HfO2 that is also epitaxial. We use scanning transmission electron microscopy to characterize the epitaxial relationships and to investigate the structure of h-HfOx. We propose a series of displacive transformations that relate the different crystalline phases and are consistent with the observed epitaxial relationships with the graphene substrate. ReaxFF based reactive molecular dynamics simulations confirm our model of the oxide phase sequencing, and illustrate the role of graphene in promoting oxide crystallization. Our results suggest a way to achieve heteroepitaxial integration of high-performance, crystalline dielectrics with two dimensional (2D) semiconductors with an atomically sharp interface, which is also relevant to hafnia phase engineering.

Title: Ideal antiferroelectricity with large digital electrostrain in PbZrO3 epitaxial thin films

Abstract: Antiferroelectrics exhibit reversible antipolar-polar phase transitions under electric fields, yielding large electrostrain suitable for electromechanical devices. Nevertheless, in thin-film form, the antiferroelectric behavior is often obscured by competing ferroic orders, resulting in slanted hysteresis loops with undesired remnant polarization, subsequently posing challenges in obtaining ideal antiferroelectricity and understanding their intrinsic electrical behavior. Here, atomistic models for controllable antiferroelectric-ferroelectric phase transition pathways are unveiled along specific crystallographic directions. Guided by the anisotropic phase transition and orientation design, we achieved ideal antiferroelectricity with square double hysteresis loop, large saturated polarization (~60 {\mu}C/cm2), near-zero remnant polarization, fast response time (~75 ns), and near-fatigue-free performance (~10^10 cycles) in (111)P-oriented PbZrO3 epitaxial thin films. Moreover, a bipolar and frequency-independent digital electrostrain (~0.83%) were demonstrated in this architype antiferroelectric system. In-situ X-ray diffraction studies further reveal that the large digital electrostrain results from intrinsic field-induced antiferroelectric-ferroelectric structural transition. This work demonstrates the anisotropic phase transition mechanism and ideal antiferroelectricity with large digital electrostrain in antiferroelectric thin films, offering a new avenue for applications of antiferroelectricity in nanoelectromechanical systems.

Title: Spectroscopic evidence for possible quantum spin liquid behavior in a two-dimensional Mott insulator
Authors: Haiyang Chen, Fo-Hong Wang, Qiang Gao, Xue-Jian Gao, Zhenhua Chen, Yaobo Huang, Kam Tuen Law, Xiao Yan Xu, Peng Chen
Abstract: Mott insulators with localized magnetic moments will exhibit a quantum spin liquid (QSL) state when the quantum fluctuations are strong enough to suppress the ordering of the spins. Such an entangled state will give rise to collective excitations, in which spin and charge information are carried separately. Our angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements on single-layer 1T-TaS2 show a flat band around the zone center and a gap opening of about 200 meV in the low temperature, indicating 2D Mott insulating nature in the system. This flat band is dispersionless in momentum space but shows anomalously broad width around the zone center and the spectral weight decays rapidly as momentum increases. The observation is described as a spectral continuum from electron fractionalization, corroborated by a low energy effective this http URL intensity of the flat band is reduced by surface doping with magnetic adatoms and the gap is closing, a result from the interaction between spin impurities coupled with spinons and the chargons, which gives rise to a charge redistribution. Doping with nonmagnetic impurities behaves differently as the chemical potential shift dominates. These findings provide insight into the QSL states of strongly correlated electrons on 2D triangular lattices.

Title: Efficient spin-orbit torque driven magnetization switching of GdFe using phosphorus-implanted platinum layers
Authors: Kazuki Shintaku, Arun Jacob Mathew, Akihisa Iwamoto, Mojtaba Mohammadi, Hiroyuki Awano, Hironori Asada, Yasuhiro Fukuma
Abstract: The capability of the spin-orbit torque (SOT) generated via phenomena such as the spin Hall effect in heavy metals, in switching the magnetization of an adjacent magnetic material, has been studied extensively over the last decade. The efficiency of SOT generation is commonly quantified in terms of the spin Hall angle {\theta}_SH. In this work, we demonstrate experimentally that implanting platinum (Pt) with phosphorus (P), resulting in Pt (P) d, where d denotes the implantation dose, increases {\theta}_SH by a factor of 7, from 0.06 (d = 0) to 0.43 (d = 10*10^16 ions/cm^2). The enhanced {\theta}_SH, along with factors such as perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and resistivity, lead to reduction of the critical current density for switching the perpendicular magnetization of ferrimagnetic rare earth-transition metal alloy Gd26Fe74, by a factor of nearly 27, from 4.0*1011 A/m^2 (d = 0) to 1.5*10^10 A/m^2 (d = 10*10^16 ions/cm^2). Further, the switching current density at zero thermal fluctuations and thermal stability factor were evaluated and found to be 2.0*10^10 A/m^2 and 61.4 (d = 10*10^16 ions/cm^2), with the latter being sufficiently above the required threshold for commercial memory applications. Our results suggest that Pt (P) could be a strong candidate in realizing efficient SOT driven magnetization switching leading to the development of improved memory and logic devices in the future.

Title: Phase Separation in Active Binary Mixtures With Chemical Reaction
Authors: Sayantan Mondal, Prasenjit Das
Abstract: We study motility-induced phase separation~(MIPS) in active AB binary mixtures undergoing the chemical reaction $A \rightleftharpoons B$. Starting from the evolution equations for the density fields $\rho_i(\vec r, t)$ describing MIPS, we phenomenologically incorporate the effects of the reaction through the reaction rate $\Gamma$ into the equations. The steady-state domain morphologies depend on $\Gamma$ and the relative activity of the species, $\Delta$. For a sufficiently large $\Gamma$ and $\Delta\ne 1$, the more active component of the mixture forms a droplet morphology. We characterize the morphology of domains by calculating the equal-time correlation function $C(r, t)$ and the structure factor $S(k, t)$, exhibiting scaling violation. The average domain size, $L(t)$, follows a diffusive growth as $L(t)\sim t^{1/3}$ before reaching the steady state domain size, $L_{\rm ss}$. Additionally, $L_{\rm ss}$ shows the scaling relation $L_{\rm ss}\sim\Gamma^{-1/4}$, independent of $\Delta$.

Title: Density-field structures in a few systems undergoing velocity ordering
Authors: Subir K. Das, Sohini Chatterjee, Wasim Akram, Subhajit Paul, Saikat Chakraborty, Arabinda Bera
Abstract: We consider two (off-lattice) varieties of out-of-equilibrium systems, viz., granular and active matter systems, that, in addition to displaying velocity ordering, exhibit fascinating pattern formation in the density field, similar to those during vapor-liquid phase transitions. In the granular system, velocity ordering occurs due to reduction in the normal components of velocities, arising from inelastic collisions. In the active matter case, on the other hand, velocity alignment occurs because of the inherent tendency of the active particles to follow each other. Inspite of this difference, the patterns, even during density-field evolutions, in these systems can be remarkably similar. This we have quantified via the calculations of the two-point equal time correlation functions and the structure factors. These results have been compared with the well studied case of kinetics of phase separation within the framework of the Ising model. Despite the order-parameter conservation constraint in all the cases, in the density field, the quantitative structural features in the Ising case is quite different from those for the granular and active matters. Interestingly, the correlation function for the latter varieties, particularly for an active matter model, quite accurately describes the structure in a real assembly of biologically active particles.

Abstract: The stability of hydrogenated monolayer graphene was investigated via X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) for two different environmental conditions: ultra-high vacuum (UHV) and ambient pressure. The study is carried out by measuring the C 1s line shape evolution for two hydrogenated samples one kept in the UHV chamber and the other progressively exposed to air. In particular, the $sp^3$ relative intensity in the C 1s core-level spectrum, represented by the area ratio $\frac{sp^3}{sp^2+sp^3}$, was used as a marker for the hydrogenation-level and it resulted to vary by (4 $\pm$ 2)$\%$ in UHV after four months. Thus, a long-term stability of hydrogenated monolayer graphene was found, that indicates this material as a good candidate for hydrogen (or tritium) storage as long as it is kept in vacuum. On the other hand, the C 1s spectrum of the sample exposed to air shows a significant oxidation. A rapid growth up to saturation of the carbon oxides was observed with a time constant $\tau$ = 1.8 $\pm$ 0.2 hours. Finally, the re-exposure of the oxidised sample to atomic hydrogen was found to be an effective method for the recovery of hydrogenated graphene. This process was studied by carrying out both XPS and electron energy loss spectroscopy, the latter exploited to observe the CH stretching mode as a direct footprint of re-hydrogenation.

Authors: Yihan Shi, Qingrui Pan, Jitao Li, Xiaoze Shi, Youchang Wang, Peng Xiao
Abstract: This work presents a comprehensive study on the aging behavior of 18650-type lithium-ion batteries, focusing on the uneven intercalation of lithium ions during fast charging processes. It introduces a novel approach using color visual recognition technology to analyze color changes in the graphite anode, indicative of lithiation levels. The study employs X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Distribution of Relaxation Time (DRT) techniques to validate and analyze the observations. The study emphasizes the significance of electrode impedance, the positioning of battery tabs, and electrolyte distribution in influencing the aging dynamics of lithium-ion batteries. Furthermore, the paper presents an innovative impedance Transport-Line Model, specifically developed to capture the evolution of polarization impedance over time.

Title: Twist Grain Boundary phases in proper ferroelectric liquid crystals realm
Authors: Damian Pociecha, Jadwiga Szydlowska, Katarzyna Kwiatkowska, Marijus Juodka, Julian Spiess, John MD Storey, Corrie T Imrie, Rebecca Walker, Ewa Gorecka
Abstract: The twist-grain-boundary (TGB) phases, characterized by a periodic, helical arrangement of blocks made of polar smectic phases, SmAF and SmCF, have been discovered. They have been observed for rod-like molecules with a strong longitudinal dipole moment, featuring an (S)-2-methylbutyl end group having only weak twisting power, and emerge below the antiferroelectric SmAAF phase, where the lamellar structure is already well established. It is suggested that the structure is governed by electrostatic interactions amplified by weak chiral forces, in striking contrast to the mechanism of TGB phase formation found in non-polar materials. The TGB phases exhibit light selective reflection in the visible range, while the value of electric polarization confirms an almost perfectly ordered dipole alignment.

Title: Understanding the evolution of the magnetic ground state in Ba$_4$NaRu$_3$O$_{12}$
Authors: Shruti Chakravarty, Pascal Manuel, Antonio Cervellino, Sunil Nair
Abstract: We report a comprehensive investigation of the quadruple perovskite Ba$_4$NaRu$_3$O$_{12}$, in which we discover a robust spin-lattice coupled ground state characterized by a long-range antiferromagnetic ordering at $T_N \sim$ 257 K. The system's unique structural motif of three symmetrically distinct magnetic ions, including Ru dimers separated by non-magnetic layers, is intimately correlated with its magnetic behavior, as evidenced by temperature-dependent diffraction measurements and specific heat data. The powder neutron diffraction patterns at 13 K showed that the spins within the dimers are antiparallel, leading to a net zero moment contribution and a staggered arrangement of the triangular layers formed by the Ru moments within the corner-shared octahedra along the $c$-axis. The low-temperature specific heat revealed an extra boson peak contribution from optical modes with a maximum vibrational energy of $\sim$55cm$^{-1}$. The charge transport exhibited variable-range hopping (VRH) behaviour below $T_N$, with a stronger energy-dependence than expected from the Efros-Shklovskii model, suggesting the presence of multiparticle correlation effects.

Title: Quantum Optical Spanner: Twisting Superconductors with Vortex Beam via Higgs Mode
Authors: Daemo Kang, Sota Kitamura, Takahiro Morimoto
Abstract: Light carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM)--known as vortex beams--has broadened the scope of understanding and applications of light's angular momentum. Optical tweezers using OAM, often referred to as optical spanners, have significantly expanded the tunability of optical manipulation. A key frontier now lies in understanding how vortex beams interact with quantum states of matter. In this work, we numerically investigate the dynamics of a superconductor under vortex beam illumination and demonstrate the transfer of angular momentum from light to the superconducting collective mode, resulting in mechanical rotation. Our findings open a pathway for optical manipulation in the quantum regime, which we term the quantum optical spanner.

Title: Training and synchronizing oscillator networks with Equilibrium Propagation
Authors: Théophile Rageau, Julie Grollier
Abstract: Oscillator networks represent a promising technology for unconventional computing and artificial intelligence. Thus far, these systems have primarily been demonstrated in small-scale implementations, such as Ising Machines for solving combinatorial problems and associative memories for image recognition, typically trained without state-of-the-art gradient-based algorithms. Scaling up oscillator-based systems requires advanced gradient-based training methods that also ensure robustness against frequency dispersion between individual oscillators. Here, we demonstrate through simulations that the Equilibrium Propagation algorithm enables effective gradient-based training of oscillator networks, facilitating synchronization even when initial oscillator frequencies are significantly dispersed. We specifically investigate two oscillator models: purely phase-coupled oscillators and oscillators coupled via both amplitude and phase interactions. Our results show that these oscillator networks can scale successfully to standard image recognition benchmarks, such as achieving nearly 98\% test accuracy on the MNIST dataset, despite noise introduced by imperfect synchronization. This work thus paves the way for practical hardware implementations of large-scale oscillator networks, such as those based on spintronic devices.

Title: Dirac Representation for Lattice Spin Operators: Spin-$1/2$ and Spin-$1$ cases
Authors: Maseim Bassis Kenmoe
Abstract: A novel quantum representation of lattice spin operators (LSOs) is achieved by mapping quantum spins onto their classical analogues for spin size $S=1/2$ and $S=1$. The "braket" representations of LSOs are attained thanks to a profound inspection into the binary/ternary distribution of classical bits/trits in non-negative integers. We claim the possility of getting the $j$th digit of a positive integer without performing any binary/ternary decomposition. Analytical formulas returning the $j$th bits/trits of an integer are presented. Impacts of our achievements in Physics are highlighted by revisiting the $1D$ spin-$1/2$ {XXZ} Heisenberg model with open boundaries in a magnetic field in both absence (uniform magnetic field) and presence of disorder (random magnetic field). In the absence of disorder (clean system), we demonstrate that the corresponding eigenvalues problem can be reduced to a tight-binding problem on a graph and solved without resorting to any spinless transformation nor the Bethe Anzath. In the presence of disorder, a convergent perturbation theory is elaborated. Our analytical results are compared with data from exact diagonalization for relatively large spin systems ($K\leq 18$ spins with $K$ denoting the total number of spins) obtained by implementing both the global $U(1)$ symmetry to block-diagonalize the Hamiltonian and the spin-inversion symmetry for two-fold block-diagonalization in the sector with total magnetization $\mathcal{J}^z=0$. We observe a good agreement between both results.

Title: Dissecting coupled orders in a terahertz-driven electron-doped cuprate

Ponomaryov, Igor Ilyakov, Fei Yang, Yongbo Lv, Yuheng Guo, Kilian Srowik, Steffen Danzenbacher, Moritz Niethammer, Sergey Kovalev, Jan-Christoph Deinert, Stefan Kaiser, Richard L. Greene, Hao Chu
Abstract: The interplay between superconductivity and charge density wave has often been studied from an equilibrium point of view. For example, using static tuning knobs such as doping, magnetic field and pressure, superconductivity can be enhanced or suppressed. The resulting effect on the co-existing charge density wave order, if any, is judged by variations in its ground state properties such as the ordering temperature or the spatial correlation. Such an approach can be understood as coordinated static displacements of two coupled order parameters within a Ginzburg-Landau description, evincing their interplay as either co-operative or competing but does not provide further microscopic information about the interaction. In order to assess such information, we dynamically perturb both orders from equilibrium and observe their coupling directly in the time-domain. We show that high-field multicycle terahertz pulses drive both the Higgs amplitude fluctuations of the superconducting order as well as collective fluctuations of the charge order in an electron-doped cuprate, resulting in characteristic third harmonic generation. A notable time delay is manifested between their respective driven dynamics. We propose that this may signify the important energy scale describing their coupling or imply a terahertz field-depinned charge density wave that destroys macroscopic superconductivity. Our work demonstrates a holistic approach for investigating coupled superconducting and charge density wave orders, which may shed novel light on their intertwined presence and widespread fluctuations in many classes of unconventional superconductors.

Title: Unified Multipole Bott Indices for Non-Hermitian Skin Effect in Different Orders
Authors: Wuping Yang, H. Huang
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems exhibit a distinctive phenomenon known as the non-Hermitian skin effect, where an extensive number of eigenstates become localized at the boundaries of a lattice with open boundaries. While the spectral winding number under periodic boundary conditions is a well-established topological indicator for predicting the skin effect in one-dimensional non-Hermitian systems, a suitable topological invariant to diagnose higher-order skin effects remains elusive. In this Letter, we propose a unified non-Hermitian multipole characterization framework that generalizes the concept of spectral winding to higher-order skin effects. Specifically, we develop a set of non-Hermitian multipole Bott indices capable of diagnosing skin effects of different orders. Our approach provides a comprehensive understanding of both first- and higher-order skin effects in non-Hermitian systems, offering new perspectives for exploring topological phenomena in non-Hermitian systems.

Title: Giant Exciton Transport in hBN/2D-Perovskite Heterostructures
Authors: Sara Darbari, Paul Bittorf, Leon Multerer, Fatemeh Chahshouri, Parsa Darman, Pavel Ruchka, Harald Giessen, Masoud Taleb, Yaser Abdi, Nahid Talebi
Abstract: Two-dimensional perovskites, such as Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites, exhibit outstanding optical properties and high exciton binding energies but are highly susceptible to degradation under photo- and electron-beam exposure. To overcome this limitation, we encapsulate the perovskites with mechanically exfoliated hexagonal boron nitride flakes, forming hexagonal boron nitride/perovskite heterostructures. Cathodoluminescence spectroscopy reveals that these heterostructures exhibit significantly reduced electron-beam-induced degradation, enhanced luminescence intensity, a narrower emission bandwidth, and an extended exciton decay time. Moreover, leveraging the scanning capability of our fiber-based cathodoluminescence spectroscopy technique, we demonstrate ultra-long-range exciton transport over distances of approximately 150 micrometers, attributed to exciton-defect coupling. This exciton-defect interaction not only enhances luminescence but also highlights the potential of hexagonal boron nitride/perovskite heterostructures as hybrid van-der-Waals systems with long-range exciton transport and slow radiative decay rates, paving the way for robust and efficient optoelectronic applications.

Title: Integrating Neural Networks and Tensor Networks for Computing Free Energy
Authors: Hanyan Cao, Yijia Wang, Feng Pan, Pan Zhang
Abstract: Computing free energy is a fundamental problem in statistical physics. Recently, two distinct methods have been developed and have demonstrated remarkable success: the tensor-network-based contraction method and the neural-network-based variational method. Tensor networks are accu?rate, but their application is often limited to low-dimensional systems due to the high computational complexity in high-dimensional systems. The neural network method applies to systems with general topology. However, as a variational method, it is not as accurate as tensor networks. In this work, we propose an integrated approach, tensor-network-based variational autoregressive networks (TNVAN), that leverages the strengths of both tensor networks and neural networks: combining the variational autoregressive neural network's ability to compute an upper bound on free energy and perform unbiased sampling from the variational distribution with the tensor network's power to accurately compute the partition function for small sub-systems, resulting in a robust method for precisely estimating free energy. To evaluate the proposed approach, we conducted numerical experiments on spin glass systems with various topologies, including two-dimensional lattices, fully connected graphs, and random graphs. Our numerical results demonstrate the superior accuracy of our method compared to existing approaches. In particular, it effectively handles systems with long-range interactions and leverages GPU efficiency without requiring singular value decomposition, indicating great potential in tackling statistical mechanics problems and simulating high-dimensional complex systems through both tensor networks and neural networks.

Title: Periodic Potential for Point Defects in a 2D Hexagonal Colloidal Lattice
Authors: Huang Xicheng, Liu Zefei, Chen Yong-Cong, Yang Guohong, Ao Ping
Abstract: We explore the statistical nature of point defects in a two-dimensional hexagonal colloidal crystal from the perspective of stochastic dynamics. Starting from the experimentally recorded trajectories of time series, the underlying drifting forces along with the diffusion matrix from thermal fluctuations are extracted. We then employ a deposition in which the deterministic terms are split into diffusive and transverse components under a stochastic potential with the lattice periodicity to uncover the dynamic landscape as well as the transverse matrix, two key structures from limited ranges of measurements. The analysis elucidates some fundamental dichotomy between mono-point and di-point defects of paired vacancies or interstitials. Having large transverse magnitude, the second class of defects are likely to break the detailed balance, Such a scenario was attributed to the root cause of lattice melting by experimental observations. The constructed potential can in turn facilitate large-scale simulation for the ongoing research.

Title: No equivalence between hydrodynamic and dispersive mass of the charged polaron
Authors: Krzysztof Myśliwy, Piotr Wysocki, Krzysztof Jachymski
Abstract: We consider the problem of a charged impurity exerting a weak, slowly decaying force on its surroundings, treating the latter as an ideal compressible fluid. In the semiclassical approximation, the ion is described by the Newton equation coupled to the Euler equation for the medium. After linearization, we obtain a simple closed formula for the effective mass of the impurity, depending on the interaction potential, the mean medium density, and sound velocity. Thus, once the interaction and the equation of state of the fluid is known, an estimate of the hydrodynamic effective mass can be quickly provided. Going beyond the classical case, we show that replacing the Newton with Schrödinger equation can drastically change the behavior of the impurity. In particular, the scaling of the Fermi polaron effective mass with the medium density is opposite in quantum and classical scenario. Our results are relevant for experimental systems featuring low energy impurities in Fermi or Bose systems, such as ions immersed in neutral atomic gases.

Title: Fluctuation induced network patterns in active matter with spatially correlated noise
Authors: Sebastian Fehlinger, Kai Cui, Arooj Sajjad, Heinz Koeppl, Benno Liebchen
Abstract: Fluctuations play a central role in many fields of physics, from quantum electrodynamics to statistical mechanics. In active matter physics, most models focus on thermal fluctuations due to a surrounding solvent. An alternative but much less explored noise source can occur due to fluctuating external fields, which typically feature certain spatial correlations. In this work, we introduce a minimal model to explore the influence of spatially correlated but temporally uncorrelated noise on the collective behavior of active particles. We find that specifically in chiral active particles such fluctuations induce the formation of network patterns, which neither occur for spatially (uncorrelated) thermal noise, nor in the complete absence of fluctuations. These networks show (i) a percolated structure, (ii) local alignment of the contained particles, but no global alignment, and (iii) hardly coarsen. We perform a topological data analysis to systematically characterize the topology of the network patterns. Our work serves as a starting point to explore the role of spatially correlated fluctuations and presents a route towards noise-induced phenomena in active matter.

Title: Effect of pressure, doping and magnetism on electronic structure and phonon dispersion of FeSe
Authors: Abyay Ghosh, Piotr Chudzinski, Myrta Grüning
Abstract: We present a Density Functional Theory (DFT) based first-principles study on iron chalcogenides superconductor FeSe, systematically investigating pressure and doping induced modifications to its electronic, magnetic, and lattice dynamical properties. Our constrained-DFT calculations in striped antiferromagnetic and staggered dimer phase reveal a non-trivial dependence of the electronic structure on the local magnetic moment at all pressures. Sulpher (S) and tellurium (Te) doping exert opposing effects on the electronic structure, attributable to their contrasting chemical pressure effects (negative for S, positive for Te). Lattice dynamics calculations divulge distinct dependence of different phonon modes on local magnetic moment in different magnetic phases. We identify pressure and magnetic moment-dependent dynamical instability in certain magnetic phases, underscoring the intricate interplay of structural, electronic, and magnetic properties in this system. Investigation of spin-phonon coupling for different phonon modes shows the presence of strong magneto-elastic coupling in FeSe with pressure distinctly affecting prominent optical phonon modes -- pure iron derived $B_{1g}$ and pure selenium derived $A_{1g}$. A clear indication of the change in spin-phonon coupling with pressure is visible, especially for the $B_{1g}$ mode.

Title: Impact of spin correlations on resistivity and microwave absorption of Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_2$As$_2$
Authors: Yu.I.Talanov, I.I.Gimazov, D.E.Zhelezniakova
Abstract: The results of studies of BaFe$_2$As$_2$ single crystals doped with cobalt by means of resistivity and microwave absorption measurement are reported. A theoretical description of the behavior of the microwave absorption amplitude is made taking into account the temperature dependence of resistivity, magnetic susceptibility and the lifetime of spin fluctuations. An assumption has been made that the deviation from the linear dependence of resistivity on temperature at $T<100$ K is not related to the electron-electron scattering mechanism, but it is due to the appearance of nematic fluctuations. Estimates of the rate of scattering by spin fluctuations indicate their nematic nature at temperatures near the structural transition.

Title: Resonant x-ray scattering study of charge-density wave correlations in YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{6+x}$ under uniaxial stress
Authors: S. Nakata, D. Betto, E. Schierle, S. Hameed, Y. Liu, H.-H. Kim, S. M. Souliou, T. Lacmann, K. Fürsich, T. Loew, E. Weschke, A. P. Mackenzie, C. W. Hicks, M. Le Tacon, B. Keimer, M. Minola
Abstract: We report a comprehensive study of the uniaxial stress response of charge-density-wave (CDW) correlations in detwinned single crystals of the high temperature superconductor YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$ (YBCO$_{6+x}$) with $0.40 \leq x \leq 0.93$ (hole-doping levels $0.072 \leq p \leq 0.168$) by means of Cu $L_3$-edge resonant energy-integrated x-ray scattering (REXS). We show that the influence of uniaxial stress is strongly doping dependent: the quasi-two-dimensional CDW is enhanced by in-plane uniaxial stress in a wide hole doping range ($0.45 \leq x \leq 0.80$), but only barely affected in the most underdoped and optimally doped samples ($x = 0.40$ and 0.93), where the CDW correlation length is minimal. A stress-induced three-dimensionally long-range ordered (3D) CDW was observed only in YBCO$_{6.50}$ and YBCO$_{6.67}$. The temperature dependence of the 3D CDW clearly indicates a strong competition with superconductivity. Based on the systematic strain-, doping-, and temperature-dependent REXS measurements reported here, we discuss the relationship between charge order and superconductivity in YBCO$_{6+x}$ and other cuprates.

Title: Vibration-assisted tunneling through single Au adatoms on two-dimensional WSe2
Authors: Hitesh Kumar, Yu-Chuan Lin, Joshua A. Robinson, Stefan Fölsch
Abstract: Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) at 5 K was used to study individual Au atoms adsorbed on the surface of a WSe2 layer grown on epitaxial graphene. In line with theoretical predictions, scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements reveal that the weakly bound adatom gives rise to an electronic state within the energy band gap of the WSe2 layer. Adatoms in different surface locations show different gap-state energy values that follow a random distribution around the Fermi level of the sample with a standard deviation of ~50 meV. The location-dependent shift is attributed to spatial variations in disorder potential. Tunneling via the gap state is accompanied by vibrational excitations as apparent from pronounced sideband peaks in the conductance spectra with Poisson-distributed intensities indicating significant electron-phonon coupling with a Huang-Rhys factor of S=2.8. STM tunneling through single Au adatoms on two-dimensional WSe2 constitutes a model case of resonant double-barrier tunneling accompanied by strong coupling to vibrational degrees of freedom.

Title: Pressure-tuned spin chains in brochantite, Cu$_4$SO$_4$(OH)$_6$
Authors: Victoria A. Ginga, Bin Shen, Ece Uykur, Nico Giordano, Philipp Gegenwart, Alexander A. Tsirlin
Abstract: Using high-pressure single-crystal x-ray diffraction combined with thermodynamic measurements and density-functional calculations, we uncover the microscopic magnetic model of the mineral brochantite, Cu$_4$SO$_4$(OH)$_6$, and its evolution upon compression. The formation of antiferromagnetic spin chains with the effective intrachain coupling of $J\simeq 100$\,K is attributed to the occurrence of longer Cu--Cu distances and larger Cu--O--Cu bond angles between the structural chains within the layers of the brochantite structure. These zigzag spin chains are additionally stabilized by ferromagnetic couplings $J_2$ between second neighbors and moderately frustrated by several antiferromagnetic couplings that manifest themselves in the reduced Néel temperature of the material. Pressure tuning of the brochantite structure keeps its monoclinic symmetry unchanged and leads to the growth of antiferromagnetic $J$ with the rate of 3.2\,K/GPa, although this trend is primarily caused by the enhanced ferromagnetic couplings $J_2$. Our results show that the nature of magnetic couplings in brochantite and in other layered Cu$^{2+}$ minerals is controlled by the size of the lattice translation along their structural chains and by the extent of the layer buckling.

Title: Unconventional and anomalous magnetic field distribution in a bilayer superconductor with geometric constraints
Authors: Takashi Yanagisawa
Abstract: We investigate the magnetic field distribution in multi-component superconductors. We examine a layered superconductor and a two-component one-layer superconductor. We evaluate the field distribution in the presence of a half-flux quantum vortex with a kink structure in the phase space of gap functions. We also examine the magnetic field distribution of a knot soliton which is formulated in a two-component superconductor. We investigate the effect of geometric constraints for multi-component superconductors, where the geometric constraint means that the system is compactified in one direction so that the current in this direction becomes vanishingly small. This corresponds to the gauge fixing in this direction. An unconventional magnetic field distribution takes place; here the unconventional means that the magnetic field is screened incompletely which would be called the anomalous Meissner effect. We argue that this anomalous behavior creates a massless gauge field.

Title: Coincident onset of charge order and pseudogap in a homogeneous high-temperature superconductor
Authors: D. Betto, S. Nakata, F. Pisani, Y. Liu, S. Hameed, M. Knauft, C. Lin, R. Sant, K. Kummer, F. Yakhou, N. B. Brookes, B. Keimer, M. Minola
Abstract: Understanding high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates requires knowledge of the metallic phase it evolves from, particularly the pseudogap profoundly affecting the electronic properties at low carrier densities. A key question is the influence of chemical disorder, which is ubiquitous but exceedingly difficult to model. Using resonant x-ray scattering, we identified two-dimensional charge order in stoichiometric YBa$_2$Cu$_4$O$_8$ ($T_c$ = 80 K), which is nearly free of chemical disorder. The charge order amplitude shows a concave temperature dependence and vanishes sharply at $T^*$ = 200 K, the onset of a prominent pseudogap previously determined by spectroscopy, suggesting a causal link between these phenomena. The gradual onset of charge order in other cuprates is thus likely attributable to an inhomogeneous distribution of charge ordering temperatures due to disorder induced by chemical substitution. The relationship between the pseudogap and the disorder-induced gradual freeze-out of charge carriers remains a central issue in research on high-$T_c$ superconductors.

Title: Max-Cut graph-driven quantum circuit design for planar spin glasses
Authors: Seyed Ehsan Ghasempouri, Gerhard W. Dueck, Stijn De Baerdemacker
Abstract: Finding the ground state of spin glasses is a challenging problem with broad implications. Many hard optimization problems, including NP-complete problems, can be mapped, for instance, to the Ising spin glass model. We present a graph-based approach that allows for accurate state initialization of a frustrated triangular spin-lattice with up to 20 sites that stays away from barren plateaus. To optimize circuit efficiency and trainability, we employ a clustering strategy that organizes qubits into distinct groups based on the maximum cut technique, which divides the lattice into two subsets maximally disconnected. We provide evidence that this Max-Cut-based lattice division offers a robust framework for optimizing circuit design and effectively modeling frustrated systems at polynomial cost. All simulations are performed within the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) formalism, the current paradigm for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ), but can be extended beyond. Our results underscore the potential of hybrid quantum-classical methods in addressing complex optimization problems.

Title: Magnetic Pair Distribution Function and Half Polarized Neutron Powder Diffraction at the HB-2A Powder Diffractometer
Authors: Raju Baral, Danielle R. Yahne, Malcolm J. Cochran, Matthew Powell, Joseph W. Kolis, Haidong Zhou, Stuart Calder
Abstract: Local magnetic order and anisotropy are often central for understanding fundamental behavior and emergent functional properties in quantum materials and beyond. Advances in neutron powder diffraction experiments and analysis tools now allow for quantitative determination. We demonstrate this here with complementary total neutron scattering and polarized neutron measurements on the HB-2A neutron powder diffractometer at the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR). In recent years, magnetic pair distribution function (mPDF) analysis has emerged as a powerful technique for probing local magnetic spin ordering of magnetic materials. This method can be broadly applied to any magnetic material but is particularly effective for studying systems with short-range magnetic order, such as materials with reduced dimensionality, geometrically frustrated magnets, thermoelectrics, multiferroics, and correlated paramagnets. Magnetic anisotropy often underpins the short-range order adopted. Half-polarized neutron powder diffraction (pNPD) can be used to determine the local susceptibility tensor on the magnetic sites to quantify the magnetic anisotropy. Combining the techniques of mPDF and pNPD can therefore provide valuable insights into local magnetic behavior. A series of measurements optimized for these techniques are presented as exemplar cases focused on frustrated materials where short-range order dominates, these include measurements to ultra-low temperature (<100 mK) not typically accessible for such experiments.

Title: Interface, bulk and surface structure of heteroepitaxial altermagnetic α-MnTe films grown on GaAs(111)
Authors: Sara Bey, Maksym Zhukovskyi, Tatyana Orlova, Shelby Fields, Valeria Lauter, Haile Ambaye, Anton Ievlev, Steven P. Bennett, Xinyu Liu, Badih A. Assaf
Abstract: Epitaxial MnTe films have recently seen a spur of research into their altermagnetic semiconducting properties. However, those properties may be extremely sensitive to structural and chemical modifications. We report a detailed investigation of the synthesis of the altermagnet {\alpha}-MnTe on GaAs(111) which reveals the bulk defect structure of this material, the mechanism by which it releases strain from the underlying substrate and the impact of oxidation on its surface. X-ray diffraction measurements show that {\alpha}-MnTe layers with thicknesses spanning 45nm to 640nm acquire lattice parameters different from bulk mostly due to thermal strain caused by the substrate rather than strain from the lattice mismatch. Through high resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurement, we then unveil a misfit dislocation array at the interface, revealing the mechanism by which lattice strain is relaxed. TEM also reveals a stacking fault in the bulk, occurring along a glide plane parallel to the interface. The combination of TEM with polarized neutron reflectometry measurements finally reveals the impact of oxidation on the chemistry of the surface of uncapped MnTe. Our findings highlight the subtle role of epitaxy in altering the structure of {\alpha}-MnTe providing potential opportunities to tune the altermagnetic properties of this material.

Title: A Strong-Coupling-Limit Study on the Pairing Mechanism in the Pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$
Authors: Jia-Heng Ji, Chen Lu, Zhi-Yan Shao, Zhiming Pan, Fan Yang, Congjun Wu
Abstract: Recently, the bilayer perovskite nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has been reported to exhibit high-temperature superconductivity (SC) near $80$K under a moderate pressure of about $14$GPa. To investigate the underlying pairing mechanism and symmetry in this complex system, we propose and analyze a mixed spin-$1$ and spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ bilayer $t$-$J$ model in the strong coupling regime. This model explicitly incorporates the crucial role of strong Hund's coupling, which favors the formation of local spin-triplet states from the two onsite $E_g$ orbital electrons at half-filling. We further investigate the model using both slave-particle mean-field theory and the density matrix renormalization group method. Our simulation results reveal that the dominate pairing channel is the interlayer one in the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. The Hund's coupling is shown to enhance SC within a reasonable physical range. Moreover, electron doping strengthens SC by increasing carrier density; in contrast, hole doping weakens SC. These findings offer critical insights into the unconventional SC of pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and underline the important role of orbital-selective behavior and Hund's rule.

Title: Energy Cascades in Driven Granular Liquids : A new Universality Class? I : Model and Symmetries
Authors: O. Coquand
Abstract: This article deals with the existence and scaling of an energy cascade in steady granular liquid flows between the scale at which the system is forced and the scale at which it dissipates energy. In particular, we examine the possible origins of a breaking of the Kolmogorov Universality class that applies to Newtonian liquids under similar conditions. In order to answer these questions, we build a generic field theory of granular liquid flows and, through a study of its symmetries, show that indeed the Kolmogorov scaling can be broken, although most of the symmetries of the Newtonian flows are preserved.

Title: Elastic wave propagation in magneto-active fibre composites
Authors: Harold Berjamin, Stephan Rudykh
Abstract: Fibre-reinforced elastomers are lightweight and strong materials that can sustain large deformations. When filled with magnetic particles, their effective mechanical response can be modified by an external magnetic field. In the present study, we propose an effective theory of fibre-reinforced composite, based on a neo-Hookean elastic response and a linear magnetic law in each phase. The theory is shown suitable to describe the motion of composite cylinders. Furthermore, it is found appropriate for the modelling of fibre-reinforced composites subjected to a permanent magnetic field aligned with the fibres. To reach this result, we use the incremental theory ('small on large'), in combination with homogenisation theory and the Bloch-Floquet method. This way, we show that wave directivity is sensitive to the application of a permanent magnetic field, whereas the frequency range in which wave propagation is forbidden is not modified by such a load (the band gaps are invariant). In passing, we describe a method to deduce the total stress in the material based on the measurement of two wave speeds. Furthermore, we propose an effective energy function for the description of nonlinear composites made of Yeoh-type generalised neo-Hookean fibres within a neo-Hookean matrix.

Title: Spin stiffnesses and stability of magnetic order in the lightly doped two-dimensional Hubbard model
Authors: Demetrio Vilardi, Pietro M. Bonetti, Walter Metzner
Abstract: We analyze the density dependence of the spin stiffnesses and the stability of magnetic order with respect to quantum fluctuations in the two-dimensional Hubbard model close to half-filling. The stiffnesses are computed from the spin susceptibility obtained from a random phase approximation in a magnetically ordered state. For a sizable next-to-nearest neighbor hopping amplitude and a moderate Hubbard interaction, the mean-field ground state is a Néel antiferromagnet in the electron doped regime at and above half-filling, and a planar circular spiral state in the hole doped regime below half-filling. Upon electron doping, the Néel stiffness decreases smoothly and not very steeply. By contrast, the in-plane and out-of-plane stiffnesses in the spiral state drop abruptly at half-filling. The out-of-plane stiffness even drops to zero, and then increases again very slowly upon increasing hole doping. At finite temperatures, the Néel-to-spiral transition is shifted into the hole doped regime, the stiffnesses are continuous functions of the density, and they vanish at the transition. For small hole doping, the spin stiffnesses describe the quantum fluctuations only in a small momentum range, which shrinks to zero upon approaching half-filling. Using the above results, we show that the quantum ground state of the lightly electron doped Hubbard model remains Néel ordered, while quantum fluctuations probably destroy the spiral long-range order in the hole doped regime, giving rise to a quantum disordered state with a spin gap.

Title: Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction and Dipole-Exchange Curvature Effects on the Spin-Wave Spectra of Magnetic Nanotubes
Authors: B. Mimica-Figari, P. Landeros, R. A. Gallardo
Abstract: This work explores spin-wave dynamics in magnetic nanotubes, focusing on the influence of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and curvature. The study uses analytical methods to examine how these factors influence the emergence of nonreciprocity and azimuthal standing waves in nanotubes with longitudinal magnetization along the axis or with a vortex-like magnetization. The interplay between exchange, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya, and dipolar couplings in determining the chirality of spin waves is discussed. When the magnetization is saturated along an axis, the spin waves propagating along it are symmetric under the inversion of the wave vector. However, magnetochirality, mainly driven by exchange and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya couplings, is observed in the azimuthal standing modes. In the vortex state, frequency nonreciprocity occurs for waves propagating along the tube, while the azimuthal modes remain reciprocal. For positive Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, and depending on the helicity of the vortex, the asymmetry induced by the dipolar interaction is reinforced, whereas a negative coupling opposes this asymmetry. The influence of radial anisotropy is also examined. It is found that radial anisotropy reduces the frequency of the modes and shifts the dispersion minimum to a finite wave vector in the vortex state. The properties of modes near zero frequency offer insight into the emergence of chiral magnetic textures.

Title: Exotic Quantum States in Spin-1 Bose-Einstein Condensate with Spin-Orbit Coupling in Concentric Annular Traps
Authors: Yun Liu, Zu-Jian Ying
Abstract: We explore the exotic quantum states emerging in the ground state (GS) of a strongly-correlated spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate confined in two-dimensional concentric annular traps with a spin-orbit coupling (SOC). In the antiferromagnetic case, the GS density manifests various patterns of distributions, including facial-makeup states, petal states, topological fissure states, multiple-half-ring states and property-distinguished vertical and horizonal stripe states. We notice a peculiar phenomenon of density-phase separation in the sense that the variations of density and phase tend to be independent. In ferromagnetic case, the GS exhibits a semi-circular or half-disk status of density embedded with vortices and anti-vortices. The spin distribution can self-arrange into an array of half-skyrmions and we also find a half-antiskyrmion fence separating vortex-antivortex pairs. Our study indicates that one can manipulate the emergence of exotic quantum states via the interplay of the SOC, interaction and potential geometry and the abundant state variations might also provide potential resources for quantum metrology.

Title: Electric field tunable spin-orbit gap in a bilayer graphene/WSe$_{2}$ quantum dot
Authors: Hubert Dulisch, David Emmerich, Eike Icking, Katrin Hecker, Samuel Möller, Leonie Müller, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Christian Volk, Christoph Stampfer
Abstract: We report on the investigation of proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in a heterostructure of bilayer graphene (BLG) and tungsten diselenide (WSe$_2$). A BLG quantum dot (QD) in the few-particle regime acts as a sensitive probe for induced SOC. Finite bias and magnetotransport spectroscopy measurements reveal a significantly enhanced SOC that decreases with the applied displacement field, distinguishing it from pristine BLG. We attribute this tunability to an increased layer localization of the QD states on the BLG layer distant to the WSe$_2$. Furthermore, our measurements demonstrate a reduced valley $g$-factor at larger displacement fields, consistent with a weaker lateral confinement of the QD. Our findings show evidence of the influence of WSe$_2$ across BLG layers, driven by reduced real-space confinement and increased layer localization at higher displacement fields. This study demonstrates the electrostatic tunability of spin-orbit gap in BLG/WSe$_2$ heterostructures, which is especially relevant for the field of spintronics and future spin qubit control in BLG QDs.

Title: On the effective magnetostrictive properties of anisotropic magneto-active elastomers in the small-deformation limit
Authors: Connor D. Pierce, Kathryn H. Matlack
Abstract: Magneto-active elastomers (MAEs) are composite materials comprising an elastomer matrix with embedded magnetic particles, endowing the composite with coupled effective magneto-mechanical responses. It is widely reported that anisotropic MAEs exhibit much stronger magneto-mechanical coupling than isotropic MAEs. However, most efforts to model effective magneto-mechanical properties of MAEs via homogenization focused on isotropic microstructures or those with large separations between particles, to use analytical solutions. In this work, we introduce a periodic homogenization approach to compute effective magneto-mechanical properties of anisotropic MAEs, and analyze microstructural features that enhance the magneto-mechanical coupling. Using the finite element method, we numerically determine the effect of particle shape, gap, and voids on the effective stiffness, permeability, and magneto-mechanical coupling tensors for chain-like periodic microstructures. Using insights gained from the full-field simulations, we derive an analytical expression for the magneto-mechanical coupling in the chain direction, in terms of the volume fraction, gap size, and properties of the matrix and particles. Results show that the overall magnetostriction of anisotropic MAEs is most sensitive to the gap between particles and the waviness of the particle chains, with smaller gap sizes and straighter chains yielding higher overall magnetostriction. Simulations also show that while isotropic MAEs elongate in a uniform magnetic field, anisotropic MAEs contract with much larger strain amplitudes, a result of the attractive forces between particles being much stronger in anisotropic MAEs than in isotropic MAEs. Results provide fundamental insights into the mechanisms that govern magneto-mechanical coupling in anisotropic MAEs, and constitute a toolbox of homogenized MAE material properties.

Title: Optimal flock formation induced by agent heterogeneity
Authors: Arthur N. Montanari, Ana Elisa D. Barioni, Chao Duan, Adilson E. Motter
Abstract: The study of flocking in biological systems has identified conditions for self-organized collective behavior, inspiring the development of decentralized strategies to coordinate the dynamics of swarms of drones and other autonomous vehicles. Previous research has focused primarily on the role of the time-varying interaction network among agents while assuming that the agents themselves are identical or nearly identical. Here, we depart from this conventional assumption to investigate how inter-individual differences between agents affect the stability and convergence in flocking dynamics. We show that flocks of agents with optimally assigned heterogeneous parameters significantly outperform their homogeneous counterparts, achieving 20-40% faster convergence to desired formations across various control tasks. These tasks include target tracking, flock formation, and obstacle maneuvering. In systems with communication delays, heterogeneity can enable convergence even when flocking is unstable for identical agents. Our results challenge existing paradigms in multi-agent control and establish system disorder as an adaptive, distributed mechanism to promote collective behavior in flocking dynamics.

Title: Projectively implemented altermagnetism in an exactly solvable quantum spin liquid
Authors: Avedis Neehus, Achim Rosch, Johannes Knolle, Urban F. P. Seifert
Abstract: Altermagnets are a new class of symmetry-compensated magnets with large spin splittings. Here, we show that the notion of altermagnetism extends beyond the realm of Landau-type order: we study exactly solvable $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin(-orbital) liquids (QSL), which simultaneously support magnetic long-range order as well as fractionalization and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order. Our symmetry analysis reveals that in this model three distinct types of ``fractionalized altermagnets (AM$^*$)'' may emerge, which can be distinguished by their residual symmetries. Importantly, the fractionalized excitations of these states carry an emergent $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge charge, which implies that they transform \emph{projectively} under symmetry operations. Consequently, we show that ``altermagnetic spin splittings'' are now encoded in a momentum-dependent particle-hole asymmetry of the fermionic parton bands. We discuss consequences for experimental observables such as dynamical spin structure factors and (nonlinear) thermal and spin transport.

Title: Control-driven critical fluctuations across quantum trajectories
Authors: Haining Pan, Thomas Iadecola, E. M. Stoudenmire, J. H. Pixley
Abstract: Monitored quantum circuits in which entangling unitary dynamics compete with projective local measurements can host measurement-induced phase transitions witnessed by entanglement measures at late times. Adding feedback conditioned on the measurement outcomes gives rise to another type of phase transition witnessed by local order parameters and correlation functions. These transitions, known as control or absorbing-state transitions, generically occur within the area-law entanglement phase and are thought to be governed by classical physics in that their critical exponents match those of the classical limit of the model. In this work, we examine quantum features of these transitions, focusing on a Bernoulli circuit model with a well-defined classical limit. First we demonstrate that, in the local basis defined by the absorbing state, the steady-state quantum coherence undergoes a phase transition at the control transition, where its logarithm changes discontinuously from volume- to area-law scaling. Second, we analyze the control transition from the perspective of fluctuations in observables, which carry two contributions: classical fluctuations over circuit realizations (present in the classical limit), and quantum fluctuations over trajectories and states (both absent in the classical limit). Both contributions can be estimated in experiments without post-selection. The circuit-to-circuit fluctuations, the dominant contribution, carry the critical behavior of the classical limit. However, the subleading quantum fluctuations that represent fluctuations between different quantum "worlds" also go critical at the control transition. These critical quantum fluctuations at the control transition also occur in other models, and we discuss how they can be measured experimentally without post-selection.

Title: Morphologic Evolution in Simulated Wood Densification
Authors: Alessia Ferrara, Júlio O. Amando de Barros, Sophie Marie Koch, Falk K. Wittel
Abstract: This study investigates the radial densification of spruce wood using explicit Finite Element Method simulations, focusing on the effects of various densification protocols. These protocols include quasi-static compression, oscillatory excitation, and self-densification through shrinking hydrogel fillings and their impact on the morphogenesis of folding patterns across different tissue types. The simulations incorporate the an isotropic mechanical behavior of wood tracheid walls and account for moisture and delignification effects using a hierarchical approach. Our results reveal the technological potential of targeted densification in creating tailored density profiles that enhance stiffness and strength. These insights offer valuable guidance for optimizing densification processes in practical applications.

Title: Infinite Stability in Disordered Systems
Authors: Andrew C. Yuan, Nick Crawford
Abstract: In quenched disordered systems, the existence of ordering is generally believed to be only possible in the weak disorder regime (disregarding models of spin-glass type). In particular, sufficiently large random fields is expected to prohibit any finite temperature ordering. Here, we prove that this is not necessarily true, and show rigorously that for physically relevant systems in $\mathbb{Z}^d$ with $d\ge 3$, disorder can induce ordering that is \textit{infinitely stable}, in the sense that (1) there exists ordering at arbitrarily large disorder strength and (2) the transition temperature is asymptotically nonzero in the limit of infinite disorder. Analogous results can hold in 2 dimensions provided that the underlying graph is non-planar (e.g., $\mathbb{Z}^2$ sites with nearest and next-nearest neighbor interactions).

Title: Robust Markov stability for community detection at a scale learned based on the structure
Authors: Samin Aref, Sanchaai Mathiyarasan
Abstract: Community detection, the unsupervised task of clustering nodes of a graph, finds applications across various fields. The common approaches for community detection involve optimizing an objective function to partition the nodes into communities at a single scale of granularity. However, the single-scale approaches often fall short of producing partitions that are robust and at a suitable scale. The existing algorithm, PyGenStability, returns multiple robust partitions for a network by optimizing the multi-scale Markov stability function. However, in cases where the suitable scale is not known or assumed by the user, there is no principled method to select a single robust partition at a suitable scale from the multiple partitions that PyGenStability produces. Our proposed method combines the Markov stability framework with a pre-trained machine learning model for scale selection to obtain one robust partition at a scale that is learned based on the graph structure. This automatic scale selection involves using a gradient boosting model pre-trained on hand-crafted and embedding-based network features from a labeled dataset of 10k benchmark networks. This model was trained to predicts the scale value that maximizes the similarity of the output partition to the planted partition of the benchmark network. Combining our scale selection algorithm with the PyGenStability algorithm results in PyGenStabilityOne (PO): a hyperparameter-free multi-scale community detection algorithm that returns one robust partition at a suitable scale without the need for any assumptions, input, or tweaking from the user. We compare the performance of PO against 29 algorithms and show that it outperforms 25 other algorithms by statistically meaningful margins. Our results facilitate choosing between community detection algorithms, among which PO stands out as the accurate, robust, and hyperparameter-free method.

Title: Infrared Imaging of Photochromic Contrast in Thiazolothiazole-Embedded Polymer Films
Authors: Nuren Z. Shuchi, Tyler J. Adams, Naz F. Tumpa, Dustin Louisos, Glenn D. Boreman, Michael G. Walter, Tino Hofmann
Abstract: The increasing demand for optical technologies with dynamic spectral control has driven interest in chromogenic materials, particularly for applications in tunable infrared metasurfaces. Phase-change materials such as vanadium dioxide and germanium-antimony-tellurium, for instance, have been widely used in the infrared regime. However, their reliance on thermal and electrical tuning introduces challenges such as high power consumption, limited emissivity tuning, and slow modulation speeds. Photochromic materials may offer an alternative approach to dynamic infrared metasurfaces, potentially overcoming these limitations through rapid, light-induced changes in optical properties. This manuscript explores the potential of thiazolothiazole-embedded polymers, known for their reversible photochromic transitions and strong infrared absorption changes, for tunable infrared metasurfaces. The material exhibits low absorption and a strong photochromic contrast in the spectral range from 1500 cm-1 to 1700 cm-1, making it suitable for dynamic infrared light control. This manuscript reports on infrared imaging experiments demonstrating photochromic contrast in thiazolothiazole-embedded polymer and thereby provides compelling evidence for their potential applications for dynamic infrared metasurfaces.

Title: Gas-solid Reaction Dynamics on Li$_6$PS$_5$Cl Surfaces: A Case Study of the Influence of CO$_2$ and CO$_2$/O$_2$ Atmospheres Using AIMD and MLFF Simulations
Authors: Zicun Li, Xinguo Ren, Jinbin Li, Ruijuan Xiao, Hong Li
Abstract: In recent years, rapid progress has been made in solid-state lithium batteries. Among various technologies, coating the surface of electrodes or electrolytes has proven to be an effective method to enhance interfacial stability and improve battery cycling performance. Recent experimental studies showed that gas-solid reactions offer a convenient approach to form modified coating layers on the solid electrolyte. Here, we performed computational simulations to investigate this surface reaction process. Specifically, we simulated the gas-solid reactions of Li$_6$PS$_5$Cl(LPSC) solid-state electrolytes in pure CO$_2$ and in mixed CO$_2$/O$_2$ atmospheres using ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) and machine-learning force fields (MLFF)-accelerated molecular dynamics (MD) approaches. In the former case, LPSC surfaces primarily form Li$_2$CO$_2$S because it is difficult to dissociate another oxygen atom from the second CO$_2$ molecule. While in CO$_2$/O$_2$ mixed atmosphere, O$_2$ molecules preferentially adsorb onto LPSC, which supplies oxygen sites for subsequent CO$_2$ adsorption to form carbonate -CO$_3$ units. This reaction pathway ultimately generates an interfacial product dominated by Li$_2$CO$_3$. These coatings exhibit distinct electronic and ionic conductivity characteristics, allowing the possibility to control coating compositions and configurations by adjusting the gas-solid reactions. Key criteria for applying this strategy are extracted from the current research.

Title: Refractive Index, Its Chromatic Disper-sion, and Thermal Coefficients of Four Less Common Glycols
Authors: Anastasiya Derkachova, Daniel Jakubczyk, Gennadiy Derkachov, Kwasi Nyandey
Abstract: We report comprehensive measurements of the refractive index as a function of wavelength and temperature for four less commonly studied glycols: pentaethylene glycol, hexaethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol (mixture of isomers), and tripropylene glycol. The measurements cover the spectral range of 390-1070 nm and temperatures from 1°C to 45°C. The data were modeled using a two-pole Sellmeier equation, with temperature dependence captured by wavelength-dependent thermal coefficients. The resulting fit parameters are provided in tabulated form. Experimental uncertainties in refractive index, wavelength, and temperature were rigorously evaluated and incorporated into the analysis. The influence of sample purity - including residual water content and manufacturer-reported impurities - was assessed and accounted for in the uncertainty estimates. To our knowledge, this is the first dataset to systematically characterize both chromatic dispersion and thermal variation of the refractive index for these glycols over such a broad spectral and temperature range. The validated fitting equations and parameters are suitable for use in optical modeling, materials characterization, and related applications. All raw data are available in a publicly accessible repository.

Title: Bloch phonon-polaritons with anomalous dispersion in polaritonic Fourier crystals
Authors: Sergey G. Menabde, Yongjun Lim, Alexey Y. Nikitin, Pablo Alonso González, Jacob T. Heiden, Heerin Noh, Seungwoo Lee, Min Seok Jang
Abstract: The recently suggested concept of a polaritonic Fourier crystal (PFC) is based on a harmonically-corrugated mirror substrate for a thin pristine polaritonic crystal layer. The propagating polaritons in PFC experience a harmonic and mode-selective momentum modulation leading to a manifestation of Bloch modes with practically zero inter-mode scattering. PFC was first demonstrated for the hyperbolic phonon-polaritons in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) within its Type II Reststrahlen band (RB-II) where the in-plane components of the dielectric permittivity tensor are isotropic and negative, while the out-of-plane component is positive. By contrast, a Type I Reststrahlen band (RB-I) is characterized by negative out-of-plane and positive in-plane permittivity components, and consequently, the inversion of field symmetry of phonon-polaritons compared to RB-II. Behavior of such RB-I modes in a polaritonic crystal is yet to be explored. Here, we employ a biaxial crystal alpha-phase molybdenum trioxide ({\alpha}-MoO3) and near-field imaging to study polaritonic Bloch modes in a one-dimensional PFC within the RB-I where the mid-infrared phonon-polaritons in {\alpha}-MoO3 have anomalous dispersion and negative phase velocity. Surprisingly, we observe a manifestation of Bloch waves as a dispersionless near-field pattern across the first Brillouin zone, in contrast to RB-II case demonstrated with in-plane isotropic hBN. We attribute this difference to the opposite field symmetry of the lowest-order phonon-polariton mode in the two RBs, leading to a different momentum modulation regime in the polaritonic Fourier crystal. Our results reveal the importance of mode symmetry for polaritonic crystals in general and for the emerging field of Fourier crystals in particular, which promise new ways to manipulate the nanolight.

Title: Non-orientable Exceptional Points in Twisted Boundary Systems
Authors: Jung-Wan Ryu, Jae-Ho Han, Moon Jip Park, Hee Chul Park, Chang-Hwan Yi
Abstract: Non-orientable manifolds, such as the Möbius strip and the Klein bottle, defy conventional geometric intuition through their twisted boundary conditions. As a result, topological defects on non-orientable manifolds give rise to novel physical phenomena. We study the adiabatic transport of exceptional points (EPs) along non-orientable closed loops and uncover distinct topological responses arising from the lack of global orientation. Notably, we demonstrate that the cyclic permutation of eigenstates across an EP depends sensitively on the loop orientation, yielding inequivalent braid representations for clockwise and counterclockwise encirclement; this is a feature unique to non-orientable geometries. Orientation-dependent geometric quantities, such as the winding number, cannot be consistently defined due to the absence of a global orientation. However, when a boundary is introduced, such quantities become well defined within the local interior, even though the global manifold remains non-orientable. We further demonstrate the adiabatic evolution of EPs and the emergence of orientation-sensitive observables in a Klein Brillouin zone, described by an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian that preserves momentum-space glide symmetry. Finally, we numerically implement these ideas in a microdisk cavity with embedded scatterers using synthetic momenta.

Title: Epstein zeta method for many-body lattice sums
Authors: Andreas A. Buchheit, Jonathan K. Busse
Abstract: Many-body interactions arise naturally in the perturbative treatment of classical and quantum many-body systems and play a crucial role in the description of condensed matter systems. In the case of three-body interactions, the Axilrod-Teller-Muto (ATM) potential is highly relevant for the quantitative prediction of material properties. The computation of the resulting energies in d-dimensional lattice systems is challenging, as a high-dimensional lattice sum needs to be evaluated to high precision. This work solves this long-standing issue. We present an efficiently computable representation of many-body lattice sums in terms of singular integrals over products of Epstein zeta functions. For three-body interactions in 3D, this approach reduces the runtime for computing the ATM lattice sum from weeks to minutes. Our approach further extends to a broad class of n-body lattice sums. We demonstrate that the computational cost of our method only increases linearly with n, evading the exponential increase in complexity of direct summation. The evaluation of 51-body interactions on a two-dimensional lattice, corresponding to a 100-dimensional sum, can be performed within seconds on a laptop. We discuss techniques for computing the arising singular integrals and compare the accuracy of our results against computable benchmarks, achieving full precision for exponents greater than the system dimension. Finally, we apply our method to study the stability of a three-dimensional lattice system with Lennard-Jones two-body interactions under the inclusion of an ATM three-body term at finite pressure, finding a transition from the face-centered-cubic to the body-centered-cubic lattice structure with increasing ATM coupling strength. This work establishes the mathematical foundation for an ongoing investigation into the influence of many-body interactions on the stability of matter.

Title: Non-Markovian Quantum Master and Fokker-Planck Equation for Gravitational Systems and Gravitational Decoherence
Authors: Hing-Tong Cho, Bei-Lok Hu
Abstract: A quantum master equation describing the stochastic dynamics of a quantum massive system interacting with a quantum gravitational field is useful for the investigation of quantum gravitational and quantum informational issues such as the quantum nature of gravity, gravity-induced entanglement and gravitational decoherence. Studies of the decoherence of quantum systems by an electromagnetic field shows that a lower temperature environment is more conducive to successful quantum information processing experiments. Likewise, the quantum nature of (perturbative) gravity is far better revealed at lower temperatures than high, minimizing the corruptive effects of thermal noise. In this work, generalizing earlier results of the Markovian ABH master equation [1,2] which is valid only for high temperatures, we derive a non-Markovian quantum master equation for the reduced density matrix, and the associated Fokker-Planck equation for the Wigner distribution function, for the stochastic dynamics of two masses following quantum trajectories, interacting with a graviton field, including the effects of graviton noise, valid for all temperatures. We follow the influence functional approach exemplified in the derivation of the non-Markovian Hu-Paz-Zhang master equation [62,64] for quantum Brownian motion. We find that in the low temperature limit, the off-diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix decrease in time logarithmically for the zero temperature part and quadratically in time for the temperature-dependent part, which is distinctly different from the Markovian case. We end with a summary of our findings and a discussion on how this problem studied here is related to the quantum stochastic equation derived in [77] for gravitational self force studies, and to quantum optomechanics where experimental observation of gravitational decoherence and entanglement may be implemented.

Title: Refining the Understanding of Operator Size Dynamics in Open Quantum Systems
Authors: Haolin Jiang, Pengfei Zhang
Abstract: Information scrambling refers to the phenomenon in which local quantum information in a many-body system becomes dispersed throughout the entire system under unitary evolution. It has been extensively studied in closed quantum systems, where it is quantified by operator size growth, revealing deep connections between condensed matter physics, high-energy physics, and quantum information. However, when extending the study of operator size dynamics to open quantum systems, two different definitions of operator size distributions emerge. These definitions are based on different treatments of the bath. In this work, we aim to establish a unified picture for operator size dynamics in open quantum systems, using the solvable Brownian SYK models at generic system size. In particular, we provide the conditions under which the signature of scrambling transition, discovered using one particular definition, appears in operator size dynamics under the other definition. Additionally, we extend previous studies by exploring finite-size effects that are not captured by the scramblon theory. Our results provide a refined understanding of operator size dynamics in open quantum systems.

Title: Logarithmic Spectral Distribution of a non-Hermitian $β$-Ensemble
Authors: Gernot Akemann, Francesco Mezzadri, Patricia Päßler, Henry Taylor
Abstract: We introduce a non-Hermitian $\beta$-ensemble and determine its spectral density in the limit of large $\beta$ and large matrix size $n$. The ensemble is given by a general tridiagonal complex random matrix of normal and chi-distributed random variables, extending previous work of two of the authors. The joint distribution of eigenvalues contains a Vandermonde determinant to the power $\beta$ and a residual coupling to the eigenvectors. A tool in the computation of the limiting spectral density is a single characteristic polynomial for centred tridiagonal Jacobi matrices, for which we explicitly determine the coefficients in terms of its matrix elements. In the low temperature limit $\beta\gg1$ our ensemble reduces to such a centred matrix with vanishing diagonal. A general theorem from free probability based on the variance of the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial allows us to obtain the spectral density when additionally taking the large-$n$ limit. It is rotationally invariant on a compact disc, given by the logarithm of the radius plus a constant. The same density is obtained when starting form a tridiagonal complex symmetric ensemble, which thus plays a special role. Extensive numerical simulations confirm our analytical results and put this and the previously studied ensemble in the context of the pseudospectrum.

Title: Dynamics of localized states in the stochastic discrete nonlinear Schrödinger equation
Authors: Mahdieh Ebrahimi, Barbara Drossel, Wolfram Just
Abstract: We reconsider the dynamics of localized states in the deterministic and stochastic discrete nonlinear Schrödinger equation. Localized initial conditions disperse if the strength of the nonlinear part drops below a threshold. Localized states are unstable in a noisy environment. As expected, an infinite temperature state emerges when multiplicative noise is applied, while additive noise yields unbounded dynamics since conservation of normalization is violated.

Title: Characterisation of single microdischarges during plasma electrolytic oxidation of aluminium and titanium
Authors: Jan-Luca Gembus, Vera Bracht, Florens Grimm, Nikita Bibinov, Lars Schücke, Peter Awakowicz, Andrew R. Gibson
Abstract: Plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) is a technique used to create oxide-ceramic coatings on lightweight metals, such as aluminium, magnesium, and titanium. PEO is known for producing coatings with high corrosion resistance and strong adhesion to the substrate. The process involves generating short-lived microdischarges on the material surface through anodic dielectric breakdown in a conductive aqueous solution. To investigate single microdischarges during PEO, a single microdischarge setup was developed, where the active anode surface is reduced to the tip of a wire with a diameter of 1 mm. In this work the focus is on the effect of electrolyte concentration, anode material, and electrical parameters on the microdischarges. The electrolyte is composed of distilled water with varying concentrations of potassium hydroxide (0.5 - 4 g/l). High-speed optical measurements are conducted to gain insights into the formation and temporal evolution of individual microdischarges and the induced gas bubble formation. Optical emission spectroscopy is used to estimate surface and electron temperatures by fitting Bremsstrahlung and Planck's law to the continuum spectrum of the microdischarges. To evaluate the impact of the microdischarges on coating morphology, the resulting oxide layers on the metal tips are analysed using scanning electron microscopy. The study demonstrates that microdischarge behaviour is significantly influenced by the substrate material, treatment time, and electrolyte concentration, all of which impact the coating morphology. Under the conditions studied in this work, aluminium exhibits longer microdischarge and bubble lifetimes, with fewer cracks on the top layer of the coating, whereas titanium showed faster, shorter-lived bubbles due to more rapid microdischarge events.

Title: Nonequilibrium physics of brain dynamics
Authors: Ramón Nartallo-Kaluarachchi, Morten L. Kringelbach, Gustavo Deco, Renaud Lambiotte, Alain Goriely
Abstract: Information processing in the brain is coordinated by the dynamic activity of neurons and neural populations at a range of spatiotemporal scales. These dynamics, captured in the form of electrophysiological recordings and neuroimaging, show evidence of time-irreversibility and broken detailed balance suggesting that the brain operates in a nonequilibrium stationary state. Furthermore, the level of nonequilibrium, measured by entropy production or irreversibility appears to be a crucial signature of cognitive complexity and consciousness. The subsequent study of neural dynamics from the perspective of nonequilibrium statistical physics is an emergent field that challenges the assumptions of symmetry and maximum-entropy that are common in traditional models. In this review, we discuss the plethora of exciting results emerging at the interface of nonequilibrium dynamics and neuroscience. We begin with an introduction to the mathematical paradigms necessary to understand nonequilibrium dynamics in both continuous and discrete state-spaces. Next, we review both model-free and model-based approaches to analysing nonequilibrium dynamics in both continuous-state recordings and neural spike-trains, as well as the results of such analyses. We briefly consider the topic of nonequilibrium computation in neural systems, before concluding with a discussion and outlook on the field.

Title: Hardness of observing strong-to-weak symmetry breaking
Authors: Xiaozhou Feng, Zihan Cheng, Matteo Ippoliti
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) is the cornerstone of our understanding of quantum phases of matter. Recent works have generalized this concept to the domain of mixed states in open quantum systems, where symmetries can be realized in two distinct ways dubbed strong and weak. Novel intrinsically mixed phases of quantum matter can then be defined by the spontaneous breaking of strong symmetry down to weak symmetry. However, proposed order parameters for strong-to-weak SSB (based on mixed-state fidelities or purities) seem to require exponentially many copies of the state, raising the question: is it possible to efficiently detect strong-to-weak SSB in general? Here we answer this question negatively in the paradigmatic cases of $Z_2$ and $U(1)$ symmetries. We construct ensembles of pseudorandom mixed states that do not break the strong symmetry, yet are computationally indistinguishable from states that do. This rules out the existence of efficient state-agnostic protocols to detect strong-to-weak SSB.

Title: Liouvillean Spectral Transition in Noisy Quantum Many-Body Scars
Authors: Jin-Lou Ma, Zexian Guo, Yu Gao, Zlatko Papić, Lei Ying
Abstract: Understanding the behavior of quantum many-body systems under decoherence is essential for developing robust quantum technologies. Here, we examine the fate of weak ergodicity breaking in systems hosting quantum many-body scars when subject to local pure dephasing -- an experimentally relevant form of environmental noise. Focusing on a large class of models with an approximate su(2)-structured scar subspace, we show that scarred eigenmodes of the Liouvillean exhibit a transition reminiscent of spontaneous $\mathbb{PT}$-symmetry breaking as the dephasing strength increases. Unlike previously studied non-Hermitian mechanisms, this transition arises from a distinct quantum jump effect. Remarkably, in platforms such as the XY spin ladder and PXP model of Rydberg atom arrays, the critical dephasing rate shows only weak dependence on system size, revealing an unexpected robustness of scarred dynamics in noisy quantum simulators.

Title: The Frequency Shift and Q of Disordered Superconducting RF Cavities
Authors: Hikaru Ueki, Mehdi Zarea, J. A. Sauls
Abstract: Niobium superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) cavities for high energy accelerator applications have been greatly improved in terms of the quality factor $Q$ by techniques such as Nitrogen doping. However, the mechanisms leading improvement in $Q$ are still not fully understood. Quite recently the SRF group at Fermilab measured anomalies in the frequency shift of N-doped SRF Niobium cavities near the transition temperature. Here we report our theoretical analysis of these results based on the microscopic theory of superconductivity that incorporates anisotropy of the superconducting gap and inhomogeneous disorder in the screening region of the SRF cavities. We are able to account for frequency shift anomalies very close to $T_c$ of the order of fractions of a kHz. Our results for the frequency shift and Q are in good agreement with the experimental data reported for all four N-doped Nb SRF cavities by Bafia et al. We also compare our theory with an earlier report of on a Nb sample measured at 60 GHz. We also show that the quality factor calculated theoretically has a peak of upper convexity with the largest $Q$ at intermediate levels of disorder. For strong disorder, i.e. the dirty limit, pair breaking in the presence of disorder and screening currents limits the $Q$.

Title: Understanding spin textures in PT-broken systems through universal symmetry-constrained rules
Authors: Wei Tan, Jianfeng Wang, Yang Li, Bing Huang
Abstract: The current understanding of spin-polarization phenomena in crystals relies heavily on the development of specific k.p Hamiltonians. A more fundamental and symmetry-driven understanding, based solely on crystalline symmetries, remains largely incomplete. In this work, we develop a universal theory consisting of five symmetry-constrained rules to capture the key framework of diverse spin textures (STs) in PT-broken systems. These rules comprehensively classify spatial operations and their combinations with anti-unitary operation T in symmetry-preserved k-invariant subspaces. The theory allows us to address puzzling STs and facilitates the ab initio design of unconventional STs in spin-orbit coupled crystals. Key examples include the identification of vertex-like and windmill-like STs in materials with Dn and Cnv point groups, extending beyond the currently known Radial and Rashba STs. By integrating different types of antiferromagnetic configurations, we also achieve radial STs and the Dresselhaus effect in centrosymmetric systems, challenging the long-standing assumption that these effects exist solely in non-centrosymmetric systems. When combined with topological band theory, we further propose that symmetry-constrained three-dimensional persistent STs can widely exist in two types of non-symmorphic crystals, effectively resolving the ongoing debate regarding their existence.

Abstract: Planar Josephson junctions (JJs) have emerged as a promising platform for the realization of topological superconductivity and Majorana zero modes. To obtain robust quasi one-dimensional (1D) topological superconducting states using planar JJs, limiting the number of 1D Andreev bound states' subbands that can be present, and increasing the size of the topological superconducting gap, are two fundamental challenges. It has been suggested that both problems can be addressed by properly designing the interfaces between the JJ's normal region and the superconducting leads. We fabricated Josephson junctions with periodic hole structures on the superconducting contact leads on InAs heterostructures with epitaxial superconducting Al. By depleting the chemical potential inside the hole region with a top gate, we observed an enhancement of the supercurrent across the junction. Such an enhancement is reproduced in theoretical simulations. The theoretical analysis shows that the enhancement of the JJ's critical current is achieved when the hole depletion is such to optimize the matching of quasiparticles' wave-function at the normal/superconductor interface. These results show how the combination of carefully designed patterns for the Al coverage, and external gates, can be successfully used to tune the density and wave functions' profiles in the normal region of the JJ, and therefore open a new avenue to tune some of the critical properties, such as number of subbands and size of the topological gap, that must be optimized to obtain robust quasi 1D superconducting states supporting Majorana bound states.

Title: Scaling of the Integrated Quantum Metric in Disordered Topological Phases
Authors: Jorge Martínez Romeral, Aron W.Cummings, Stephan Roche
Abstract: We report a study of a disorder-dependent real-space representation of the quantum geometry in topological systems. Thanks to the development of an efficient linear-scaling numerical methodology based on the kernel polynomial method, we can explore nontrivial behavior of the integrated quantum metric and Chern number in disordered systems with sizes reaching the experimental scale. We illustrate this approach in the disordered Haldane model, examining the impact of Anderson disorder and vacancies on the trivial and topological phases captured by this model.

Title: Emergence of a Fermi-surface in the current-driven Hidden state of 1T-TaS$_2$
Authors: Yuval Nitzav, Roni Gofman, Ilay Mangel, Abigail Dishi, Nitzan Ragoler, Sajilesh K.P., Yaron Jarach, Alex Louat, Matthew D. Watson, Cephise Cacho, Irena Feldman, Amit Kanigel
Abstract: The origin of the insulating state in 1T-TaS$_2$ has long been a subject of debate. A short current pulse transforms this insulating state into a metastable metallic phase. Using micro-ARPES, we investigate the electronic structure of this phase and uncover spatially dependent modifications caused by the current pulse. In some regions of the sample, a Fermi surface emerges, while others remain gapped. Detailed band structure analysis reveals that the metallic regions exhibit an electronic structure similar to that observed in the high-temperature phase of 1T-TaS$_2$, characterized by suppressed energy gaps and bands crossing the Fermi level. Furthermore, the metallic and insulating regions display distinct dispersions along the out-of-plane direction. These observations suggest a scenario in which the current pulse breaks the star-of-David dimers characteristic of the insulating phase, implicating these dimers as the likely origin of the insulating behavior in 1T-TaS$_2$.

Title: Exact moments for a run and tumble particle in a harmonic trap with a finite tumble time
Authors: Aoran Sun, Fangfu Ye, Rudolf Podgornik
Abstract: We study the problem of a run and tumble particle in a harmonic trap, with a finite run and tumble time, by a direct integration of the equation of motion. An exact 1D steady state distribution, diagram laws and a programmable Volterra difference equation are derived to calculate any order of moments in any other dimension, both for steady state as well as the Laplace transform in time for the intermediate states. We also use the moments to infer the distribution by considering a Gaussian quadrature for the corresponding measure, and from the scaling law of high order moments.

Title: A numerical study of the zeros of the grand partition function of $k$-mers on strips of width $k$
Authors: Soumyadeep Sarma
Abstract: We study numerically, the distribution of the zeros of the grand partition function of $k$-mers on a $k \times L$ strip in the complex activity (z) plane. Using transfer matrix methods, we find that our results match the analytical predictions of Heilmann and Leib for $k = 2$. However, for $k = 3$, the zeros are confined within a bounded region, suggesting a fundamental difference in critical behavior. This indicates that trimers belong to a distinct universality class in some finite geometries. We observe that the density of zeros along multiple line segments in the complex plane reveals a richer structure than in the dimer case. {Our findings emphasize the role of geometric constraints in shaping the statistical mechanics of $k$-mer models and set the stage for further studies in higher-dimensional lattices.

Title: Active nematic response to a deformable body or boundary: elastic deformations and anchoring-induced flow
Authors: Thomas G. J. Chandler, Saverio E. Spagnolie
Abstract: A body immersed in a nematic liquid crystal disturbs the fluid's preferred molecular configuration and increases its stored elastic energy. In an active nematic, the fluid components also generate a stress in the bulk fluid. By introducing either an immersed body or boundary, a fluid flow can be triggered due to anchoring boundary conditions alone -- a global pressure built by active stresses at equilibrium is instantly released everywhere. The fluid then imposes viscous, elastic, and active stresses on such surfaces, which, if compliant, may result in a surface deformation. We study the deformations and stress in a linearly elastic body placed in an active nematic in two-dimensions. Using complex variables techniques, exact expressions for the fluid flow, director field, surface tractions, and body deformation are derived. Qualitative differences between elastic and active stress-driven deformations are identified, depending on an active Ericksen number, anchoring conditions, and body material properties, thereby suggesting a new method for measuring mechanical stresses in active anisotropic environments. Flow profiles, external confinement, and anchoring-induced stirring are also addressed.

Title: Charge density wave solutions of the Hubbard model in the composite operator formalism
Authors: Anurag Banerjee, Emile Pangburn, Chiranjit Mahato, Amit Ghosal, Catherine Pépin
Abstract: We investigate the charge density wave phase in the strongly correlated Hubbard model without any other broken symmetry phase. Starting from the atomic Hamiltonian with no hopping, we generate quasiparticle operators corresponding to holons and doublons in the strongly correlated limit of the repulsive Hubbard model. We develop a real space composite operator formalism using the equation of motion technique to include the intersite hopping perturbatively. Our fully self-consistent calculation stabilizes multiple unidirectional translation symmetry broken states within the doping range $\delta=0.07$ to $0.2$. The charge-ordered states become increasingly unfavorable with hole-doping. The unidirectional density waves manifest as periodic modulations of half-filled Mott regions separated by hole-rich regions. Notably, density wave solutions with periods of $3$ to $8$ lattice spacing remain energetically higher than those with larger periods. Quenched disorder on the charge-ordered states induces the merging of the Mott regions and, consequently, forms short-ranged charge modulations. The density of states shows signatures of strongly correlated Mott regions, potentially relevant to the physics of underdoped cuprates.

Title: KPROJ: A Program for Unfolding Electronic and Phononic Bands
Authors: Jiaxin Chen, M. Weinert, Mingxing Chen
Abstract: We introduce a program named KPROJ that unfolds the electronic and phononic band structure of materials modeled by supercells. The program is based on the $\textit{k}$-projection method, which projects the wavefunction of the supercell onto the ${\textbf{k}}$-points in the Brillouin zone of the artificial primitive cell. It allows for obtaining an effective "local" band structure by performing partial integration over the wavefunctions, e.g., the unfolded band structure with layer-projection for interfaces and the weighted band structure in the vacuum for slabs. The layer projection is accelerated by a scheme that combines the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and the inverse FFT algorithms. It is now interfaced with a few first-principles codes based on plane waves such as VASP, Quantum Espresso, and ABINIT. In addition, it also has interfaces with ABACUS, a first-principles simulation package based on numerical atomic basis sets, and PHONOPY, a program for phonon calculations.

Title: Nonequilibrium Fluctuation-Response Relations: From Identities to Bounds
Authors: Timur Aslyamov, Krzysztof Ptaszyński, Massimiliano Esposito
Abstract: In nonequilibrium steady states of Markov jump processes, we derive exact Fluctuation-Response Relations (FRRs) that express the covariance between any pair of currents in terms of static responses in a notably simple form, thus generalizing the fluctuation-dissipation theorem far from equilibrium. We begin by considering perturbations in the symmetric part of the rates. We demonstrate that FRRs imply a hierarchy of thermodynamic bounds. These hierarchies prove the recently conjectured Response Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation (R-TUR), which bounds the ratio between any current's response and its variance by the entropy production rate (EPR). We furthermore strengthen this bound in two distinct ways, using partial EPR in one case and pseudo-EPR in the other. For perturbations in the antisymmetric part of the rates, we show that the ratio between any current's response and its variance is bounded by traffic, a metric representing the total number of transitions per unit time in the system. As an application, we use FRRs to explain the origin of positive correlations between currents in Coulomb-blockaded systems previously observed in experiments.

Authors: Christopher J. Ho, Simon M. Fischer, Gevorg Martirosyan, Sebastian J. Morris, Jiří Etrych, Christoph Eigen, Zoran Hadzibabic
Abstract: We revisit the classic Joule-expansion experiments, now with a quantum-degenerate atomic Bose gas. In contrast to the classical-gas experiments, where no temperature change was measured, here we observe and quantitatively explain both cooling and heating effects, which arise, respectively, due to quantum statistics and inter-particle interactions.

Title: Universal finite-size scaling in the extraordinary-log boundary phase of three-dimensional $O(N)$ model
Authors: Francesco Parisen Toldin, Abijith Krishnan, Max A. Metlitski
Abstract: Recent advances in boundary critical phenomena have led to the discovery of a new surface universality class in the three-dimensional $O(N)$ model. The newly found ``extraordinary-log" phase can be realized on a two-dimensional surface for $N< N_c$, with $N_c>3$, and on a plane defect embedded into a three-dimensional system, for any $N$. One of the key features of the extraordinary-log phase is the presence of logarithmic violations of standard finite-size scaling. In this work we study finite-size scaling in the extraordinary-log universality class by means of Monte Carlo simulations of an improved lattice model. We simulate the model with open boundary conditions, realizing the extraordinary-log phase on the surface for $N=2,3$, as well as with fully periodic boundary conditions and in the presence of a plane defect for $N=2,3,4$. In line with theory predictions, renormalization-group invariant observables studied here exhibit a logarithmic dependence on the size of the system. We numerically access not only the leading term in the $\beta$-function governing these logarithmic violations, but also the subleading term, which controls the evolution of the boundary phase diagram as a function of $N$.

Title: Cavity-Vacuum-Induced Chiral Spin Liquids in Kagome Lattices: Tuning and Probing Topological Quantum Phases via Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics
Authors: Chenan Wei, Liu Yang, Qing-Dong Jiang
Abstract: Topological phases in frustrated quantum magnetic systems have captivated researchers for decades, with the chiral spin liquid (CSL) standing out as one of the most compelling examples. Featured by long-range entanglement, topological order, and exotic fractional excitations, the CSL has inspired extensive exploration for practical realizations. In this work, we demonstrate that CSLs can emerge in a kagome lattice driven by vacuum quantum fluctuations within a single-mode chiral cavity. The chiral cavity imprints quantum fluctuations with time-reversal symmetry breaking, fostering chiral interactions among electrons and stabilizing a robust CSL phase without external laser excitation. Moreover, we identify experimentally accessible observables -- such as average photon number and transport properties -- that reveal connections between photon dynamics and the emergent chiral order. Our findings establish a novel pathway for creating, controlling, and probing topological and symmetry-breaking quantum phases in strongly correlated systems.

Title: Martingale properties of entropy production and a generalized work theorem with decoupled forward and backward processes
Authors: Xiangting Li, Tom Chou
Abstract: By decoupling forward and backward stochastic trajectories, we construct a family of martingales and work theorems for both overdamped and underdamped Langevin dynamics. Our results are made possible by an alternative derivation of work theorems that uses tools from stochastic calculus instead of path-integration. We further strengthen the equality in work theorems by evaluating expectations conditioned on an arbitrary initial state value. These generalizations extend the applicability of work theorems and offer new interpretations of entropy production in stochastic systems. Lastly, we discuss the violation of work theorems in far-from-equilibrium systems.

Title: Ultrafast room-temperature valley manipulation in silicon and diamond
Authors: Adam Gindl, Martin Čmel, František Trojánek, Petr Malý, Martin Kozák
Abstract: Some semiconductors have more than one degenerate minimum of the conduction band in their band structure. These minima-known as valleys-can be used for storing and processing information, if it is possible to generate a difference in their electron populations. However, to compete with conventional electronics, it is necessary to develop universal and fast methods for controlling and reading the valley quantum number of the electrons. Even though selective optical manipulation of electron populations in inequivalent valleys has been demonstrated in two-dimensional crystals with broken time-reversal symmetry, such control is highly desired in many technologically important semiconductor materials, including silicon and diamond. We demonstrate an ultrafast technique for the generation and read-out of a valley-polarized population of electrons in bulk semiconductors on subpicosecond timescales. The principle is based on the unidirectional intervalley scattering of electrons accelerated by an oscillating electric field of linearly polarized infrared femtosecond pulses. Our results are an advance in the development of potential room-temperature valleytronic devices operating at terahertz frequencies and compatible with contemporary silicon-based technology.

Title: Finite-size scaling on the torus with periodic projected entangled-pair states
Authors: Gleb Fedorovich, Lukas Devos, Jutho Haegeman, Laurens Vanderstraeten, Frank Verstraete, Atsushi Ueda
Abstract: An efficient algorithm is constructed for contracting two-dimensional tensor networks under periodic boundary conditions. The central ingredient is a novel renormalization step that scales linearly with system size, i.e. from $L \to L+1$. The numerical accuracy is comparable to state-of-the-art tensor network methods, while giving access to much more data points, and at a lower computational cost. Combining this contraction routine with the use of automatic differentiation, we arrive at an efficient algorithm for optimizing fully translation invariant projected entangled-pair states on the torus. Our benchmarks show that this method yields finite-size energy results that are comparable to those from quantum Monte Carlo simulations. When combined with field-theoretical scaling techniques, our approach enables accurate estimates of critical properties for two-dimensional quantum lattice systems.

Title: Efficient Generation of Spin Currents in Altermagnets via Magnon Drag
Authors: Konstantinos Sourounis, Aurélien Manchon
Abstract: Altermagnets, a recently identified class of magnetic materials, possess a spin-split Fermi surface that results in the so-called spin splitter effect, enabling the generation of a spin current transverse to the injection direction and whose polarization lies along the Néel vector. In this study, we investigate how magnons interact with electrons in an altermagnetic metal. We find that while the electron-magnon interaction does not perturb the magnon dispersion, a charge current flowing in the material can induce a transverse magnon spin current, analogous to the electronic spin splitter effect. This spin current possesses both electronic and magnonic characteristics, i.e., a chemical potential dependence and a strong temperature dependence. This effect realizes the efficient generation of spin currents via magnons without depending on the material's spin-orbit coupling.

Abstract: The simultaneous application of high magnetic fields and high pressures for controlling magnetic ground states is important for testing our understanding of many-body quantum theory. However, the implementation for neutron scattering experiments presents a technical challenge. To overcome this challenge we present an optimized pressure-cell design with a novel bullet shape, which is compatible with horizontal-field magnets, in particular the high-field magnet operating at the Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin. The cell enabled neutron diffraction and spectroscopy measurements with the combination of three extreme conditions: high pressures, high magnetic fields, and dilution temperatures, simultaneously reaching 0.7 GPa, 25.9 T, and 200 mK. Our results demonstrate the utility of informed material choices and the efficiency of finite-element analysis for future pressure-cell designs to be used in combination with magnetic fields and dilution temperatures for neutron scattering purposes.

Title: Enhanced nonlinear Hall effect by Cooper pairs near superconductor criticality
Authors: Zi-Hao Dong, Hui Yang, Yi Zhang
Abstract: Unlike the linear Hall effect that requires broken time-reversal symmetry, the nonlinear Hall effect may occur in time-reversal symmetric systems as long as there exists a non-zero Berry curvature dipole in the absence of inversion symmetry. Interestingly, the presence of time-reversal symmetry is consistent with and thus allows a direct transition into a superconducting phase. Indeed, superconductivity has been established in various nonlinear Hall materials, such as WTe$_2$ and MoTe$_2$, at sufficiently low temperatures. We find that the nonlinear Hall response should be significantly enhanced near the superconducting criticality, dominated by the Aslamazov-Larkin (AL) contributions augmented by superconducting fluctuations, which we attribute to the Berry curvature dipole and a divergent lifetime $\tau\sim (T-T_c)^{-1}$ of the Cooper pairs, instead of the single electrons. Such a controlled enhancement brings the nonlinear Hall effect into various simple experimental observations and practical applicational potentials.

Title: Critical exponents at the Nishimori point
Authors: Gesualdo Delfino
Abstract: The Nishimori point of the random bond Ising model is a prototype of renormalization group fixed points with strong disorder. We show that the exact correlation length and crossover critical exponents at this point can be identified in two and three spatial dimensions starting from properties of the Nishimori line. These are the first exact exponents for frustrated random magnets, a circumstance to be also contrasted with the fact that the exact exponents of the Ising model without disorder are not known in three dimensions. Our considerations extend to higher dimensions and models other than Ising.

Title: Nonreciprocal ballistic transport in multi-layer Weyl semimetal films with surface engineering
Authors: M. H. Zou, R. Ma, S. J. Xu, W. Chen, H. Geng, L. Sheng, D. Y. Xing
Abstract: Weyl semimetal (WSM) thin films exhibit distinct electronic properties compared to their bulk counterparts. In this study, we theoretically investigate the nonreciprocal ballistic transport phenomena arising in WSM thin films due to surface modifications. Our analysis demonstrates that the nonreciprocity is sub-band-resolved, where the surface states provide the dominant contribution to the nonreciprocity, whereas the bulk states introduce a negative correction. Calculations further reveal a quantum size effect: overall, the nonreciprocal signal decreases with increasing film thickness, but it undergoes discontinuities as the Fermi energy approaches the bottom of a sub-band. Moreover, we observe that the density of states (DOS) in such multi-layer systems exhibits a thickness-independent pattern, which can be effectively explained by a single-variable theory.

Title: Rubber wear on concrete: dry and in-water conditions
Authors: R. Xu, N. Miyashita, B.N.J. Persson
Abstract: Rubber wear results from the removal of small (micrometer-sized) rubber particles through crack propagation. In this study, we investigate the wear behavior of Styrene-Butadiene Rubber (SBR) and Natural Rubber (NR) sliding on two different concrete surfaces under dry and wet (in water) conditions. Experiments are conducted at low sliding speeds ($\approx 3 \ {\rm mm/s}$) to minimize frictional heating and hydrodynamic effects. For two SBR compounds, we observe significantly higher wear rates in water compared to the dry state, with enhancement factors of $1.5-2.5$ for a low-glass-transition-temperature SBR compound ($T_{\rm g} = -50^\circ {\rm C}$) and approximately $4$ for a higher-glass-transition compound ($T_{\rm g} = -7^\circ {\rm C}$). In contrast, the NR compound showed no wear in water at low nominal contact pressures ($\sigma_0 \approx 0.12$, $0.16$, and $0.25 \ {\rm MPa}$), while at higher pressures ($\sigma_0 \approx 0.36$ and $0.49 \ {\rm MPa}$), the wear rates in dry and in-water states are similar. The findings provide insights into the mechanisms of rubber wear under varying environmental and mechanical conditions, highlighting the influence of material properties, interfacial effects, and applied pressures on wear behavior.

Title: Gate Tunable Josephson Diode Effect in Josephson Junctions made from InAs Nanosheets
Authors: Shili Yan, Yi Luo, Haitian Su, Han Gao, Xingjun Wu, Dong Pan, Jianhua Zhao, Ji-Yin Wang, Hongqi Xu
Abstract: We report the observation of Josephson diode effect (JDE) in hybrid devices made from semiconductor InAs nanosheets and superconductor Al contacts. By applying an in-plane magnetic field ($B_{\mathrm{xy}}$), we detect non-reciprocal superconducting switching current as well as non-reciprocal superconducting retrapping current. The strength of the JDE depends on the angle between the in-plane magnetic field and the bias current ($I_{\mathrm{b}}$), reaching its maximum when $B_{\mathrm{xy}} \perp I_{\mathrm{b}}$ and dropping to nearly zero when $B_{\mathrm{xy}}\parallel I_{\mathrm{b}}$. Additionally, the diode efficiency is tunable via an electrostatic gate with a complete suppression at certain gate voltages. Our findings indicate that the observed JDE in InAs nanosheet-based Josephson junctions most likely arises from the Rashba spin-orbit interaction (SOI) in the nanosheets. Such gate-tunable JDE in Josephson junctions made from semiconductor materials with SOI is useful not only for constructing advanced superconducting electronics but also for detecting novel superconducting states.

Title: Scale-free localization versus Anderson localization in unidirectional quasiperiodic lattices
Authors: Yu Zhang, Luhong Su, Shu Chen
Abstract: Scale-free localization emerging in non-Hermitian physics has recently garnered significant attention. In this work, we explore the interplay between scale-free localization and Anderson localization by investigating a unidirectional quasiperiodic model with generalized boundary conditions. We derive analytical expressions of Lyapunov exponent from the bulk equations. Together with the boundary equation, we can determine properties of eigenstates and spectrum and establish their exact relationships with the quasiperiodic potential strength and boundary parameter. While eigenstates exhibit scale-free localization in the weak disorder regime, they become localized in the strong disorder regime. The scale-free and Anderson localized states satisfy the boundary equation in distinct ways, leading to different localization properties and scaling behaviors. Generalizing our framework, we design a model with exact energy edges separating the scale-free and Anderson localized states via the mosaic modulation of quasiperiodic potentials. Our models can be realized experimentally in electric circuits.

Title: Probing $p$-wave effects in spin-density separation of Bose mixtures with the dynamic structure factor
Authors: Xiaoran Ye, Zhaoxin Liang
Abstract: Quantum mixtures of Bose gases with tunable $s$- and $p$-wave interactions offer a versatile platform to explore strongly correlated phases and exotic phenomena. While repulsive interactions often drive phase separation, the interplay of $p$-wave interactions with spin-density decoupling remains underexplored. In this work, we employ the path integal field theory to investigate the role of $p$-wave interactions in three-dimensional two-component Bose gas. We derive the Lee-Huang-Yang corrections to the ground-state energy and quantum depletion, revealing how $p$-wave interactions modify equations of state of the model system. Furthermore, we demonstrate that $p$-wave interactions predominantly renormalize the spin-sector effective mass in the language of decoupling the density and spin-density degrees of freedom. This effect manifests in the dynamic structure factor, computed via hydrodynamic theory, where Bragg spectroscopy can detect a tunable splitting between spin and density modes. Our results bridge theoretical predictions with experimental observables, offering insights into anisotropic interaction effects in quantum gases and their implications for probing emergent phases.

Title: Giant spin shift current in two-dimensional altermagnetic multiferroics VOX$\mathrm{_2}$
Authors: Yao Yang, Jinxiong Jia, Longjun Xiang, Fuming Xu, Hao Jin
Abstract: Altermagnets, which exhibit spin-split electronic bands without net magnetization, provide an appealing platform for exploring unconventional spin and ferroic physics. Through symmetry analyses and first-principles calculations, we show that monolayer \(\mathrm{VOX_2}\) (\(\mathrm{X = Cl, Br, I}\)) is a two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectric altermagnet (FEAM). The spin splitting in its electronic band structure can be precisely tuned by ferroelectric polarization and magnetic order, accompanied by a giant magnetoelectric coupling coefficient. Owing to the absence of inversion symmetry, this material also exhibits pronounced nonlinear optical responses. The altermagnetic \(\mathrm{VOI_2}\) monolayer show an exceptionally large spin shift current of up to \(330.072\,\mu\mathrm{A}/\mathrm{V}^2\), which is switchable by reversing the magnetic order. These results uncover a strong interplay between magnetic and ferroelectric orders, offering a route toward electrically and magnetically tunable nonlinear spin photocurrents in 2D multiferroic systems.

Title: On Tailoring Structural and Optoelectronic Properties of TiO2 Thin Films Synthesized via 'Room' Temperature High Power Impulse Magnetron Sputtering (HiPIMS)
Authors: Aarati Chacko, Erwin Hack, Sebastian Lohde, Robin Bucher, Oguz Yildirim, Arnold Mueller, Michel Calame, Hans J. Hug, Mirjana Dimitrievska
Abstract: Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is a key material in optoelectronic and energy conversion technologies, including solar cells and photocatalysis. However, integrating TiO2 into flexible or temperature-sensitive devices requires deposition techniques that avoid high-temperature processing while maintaining control over both phase composition and crystallinity. In this work, we demonstrate the synthesis of nanocrystalline TiO2 thin films using High Power Impulse Magnetron Sputtering (HiPIMS) at nearroom temperature. By systematically varying total pressure and oxygen flow, we achieve tunable anatase to rutile phase ratios and control over crystalline quality, as evidenced by Raman and photoluminescence trends. The observed optical trends in both refractive index and emission are directly linked to the underlying structural evolution, with compositional analysis verifying stoichiometric consistency across all deposition conditions. Our findings establish HiPIMS as a powerful low temperature method for tailoring TiO2 thin films and enabling their application in flexible photovoltaics, photoelectrochemical water splitting, and other energy-related systems.

Title: Impact of the Sagnac Effect on Thermodynamic and Magnetocaloric Properties of a Rotating Two-Dimensional Electron Gas
Authors: Cleverson Filgueiras, Moises Rojas, Vinicius T. Pieve, Edilberto O. Silva
Abstract: This work investigates the impact of the Sagnac effect on the thermodynamic properties of a non-interacting two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in a rotating sample under the influence of a uniform magnetic field. We derive an analytical expression for the energy spectrum using an effective Hamiltonian that incorporates inertial forces, and then apply canonical ensemble statistical mechanics to evaluate thermodynamic quantities. The results show that rotation modifies the energy levels, the application of a magnetic field leads to the formation of Landau levels further altered by rotation and gravitational mass, and thermodynamic quantities (internal energy, specific heat, free energy, entropy, magnetization, and magnetocaloric effect) exhibit a strong dependence on these parameters. In particular, the difference between effective mass $m^*$ and gravitational mass $m_G$ influences magnetization and the magnetocaloric effect, with negative rotations potentially inducing a cooling effect when these masses are distinct. We conclude that rotational effects and effective mass properties are crucial for understanding the thermodynamics of electronic systems under magnetic fields, with implications for thermal modulation in semiconductor materials.

Title: Non-equilibrium Dynamics and Universality of 4D Quantum Vortices and Turbulence
Authors: Wei-can Yang
Abstract: The study of quantum vortices provides critical insights into non-equilibrium dynamics across diverse physical systems. While previous research has focused on point-like vortices in two dimensions and line-like vortices in three dimensions, quantum vortices in four spatial dimensions are expected to take the form of extended vortex surfaces, thereby fundamentally enriching dynamics. Here, we conduct a comprehensive numerical study of 4D quantum vortices and turbulence. Using a special visualization method, we discovered the decay of topological numbers that does not exist in low dimensions, as well as the high-dimensional counterpart of the vortex reconnection process. We further explore quench dynamics across phase transitions in four dimensions and verify the applicability of the higher-dimensional Kibble-Zurek mechanism. Our simulations provide numerical evidence of 4D quantum turbulence, characterized by universal power-law behavior. These findings reveal universal principles governing topological defects in higher dimensions, offering insights for future experimental realizations using synthetic dimensions.

Title: Superconductivity, Anomalous Hall Effect, and Stripe Order in Rhombohedral Hexalayer Graphene
Authors: Erin Morissette, Peiyu Qin, Hai-Tian Wu, Naiyuan J. Zhang, K. Watanabe, T. Taniguchi, J.I.A. Li
Abstract: Unconventional superconducting phases are distinguished by broken symmetries in their order parameters. Here, we report the discovery of an exotic superconducting phase in rhombohedral hexalayer graphene at high displacement fields, marked by its coexistence with both a stripe charge order and the anomalous Hall effect. In angle-resolved transport measurements, the onset of stripe order is manifested as thermally activated insulating behavior along one axis, with highly conductive transport along the orthogonal direction. Upon cooling, superconductivity emerges exclusively along the high-conductivity axis, forming one-dimensional-like superconducting channels. This anisotropic superconducting phase exhibits multiple first-order hysteretic transitions. Pronounced thermal hysteresis-between warming and cooling across the superconducting transition-suggests a melting transition of the underlying stripe phase. Additionally, magnetic-field-induced switching-similar to phenomena reported in tetra- and pentalayer graphene-supports the chiral nature of the superconducting state. Together, these findings identify a previously unrecognized quantum phase: a chiral superconductor embedded within a stripy Hall crystal.

Title: Non-Hermitian Numerical Renormalization Group: Solution of the non-Hermitian Kondo model
Authors: Phillip C. Burke, Andrew K. Mitchell
Abstract: Non-Hermitian (NH) Hamiltonians describe open quantum systems, nonequilibrium dynamics, and dissipative processes. Although a rich range of single-particle NH physics has been uncovered, many-body phenomena in strongly correlated NH systems have been far less well studied. The Kondo effect, an important paradigm for strong correlation physics, has recently been considered in the NH setting. Here we develop a NH generalization of the numerical renormalization group (NRG) and use it to solve the NH Kondo model. Our non-perturbative solution applies beyond weak coupling, and we uncover a nontrivial phase diagram. The method is showcased by application to the NH pseudogap Kondo model, which we show supports a completely novel phase with a genuine NH stable fixed point and complex eigenspectrum. Our NH-NRG code, which can be used in regimes and for models inaccessible to, e.g., perturbative scaling and Bethe ansatz, is provided open source.

Title: Mechanical Amorphization of Glass-Forming Systems Induced by Oscillatory Deformation: The Energy Absorption and Efficiency Control
Authors: Baoshuang Shang, Xinxin Li, Pengfei Guan, Weihua Wang
Abstract: The kinetic process of mechanical amorphization plays a central role in tailoring material properties. Therefore, a quantitative understanding of how this process depends on loading parameters is critical for optimizing mechanical amorphization and tuning material performance. In this study, we employ molecular dynamics simulations to investigate oscillatory deformation-induced amorphization in three glass-forming intermetallic systems, addressing two unresolved challenges: (1) the relationship between amorphization efficiency and mechanical loading, and (2) energy absorption dynamics during crystal-to-amorphous (CTA) transitions. Our results demonstrate a decoupling between amorphization efficiency--governed by work rate and described by an effective temperature model--and energy absorption, which adheres to the Herschel-Bulkley constitutive relation. Crucially, the melting enthalpy emerges as a key determinant of the energy barrier, establishing a thermodynamic analogy between mechanical amorphization and thermally induced melting. This relationship provides a universally applicable metric to quantify amorphization kinetics. By unifying material properties and loading conditions, this work establishes a predictive framework for controlling amorphization processes. These findings advance the fundamental understanding of deformation-driven phase transitions and offer practical guidelines for designing materials with tailored properties for ultrafast fabrication, ball milling, and advanced mechanical processing techniques.

Title: Deep Variational Multivariate Information Bottleneck -- A Framework for Variational Losses
Authors: Eslam Abdelaleem, Ilya Nemenman, K. Michael Martini
Abstract: Variational dimensionality reduction methods are widely used for their accuracy, generative capabilities, and robustness. We introduce a unifying framework that generalizes both such as traditional and state-of-the-art methods. The framework is based on an interpretation of the multivariate information bottleneck, trading off the information preserved in an encoder graph (defining what to compress) against that in a decoder graph (defining a generative model for data). Using this approach, we rederive existing methods, including the deep variational information bottleneck, variational autoencoders, and deep multiview information bottleneck. We naturally extend the deep variational CCA (DVCCA) family to beta-DVCCA and introduce a new method, the deep variational symmetric information bottleneck (DVSIB). DSIB, the deterministic limit of DVSIB, connects to modern contrastive learning approaches such as Barlow Twins, among others. We evaluate these methods on Noisy MNIST and Noisy CIFAR-100, showing that algorithms better matched to the structure of the problem like DVSIB and beta-DVCCA produce better latent spaces as measured by classification accuracy, dimensionality of the latent variables, sample efficiency, and consistently outperform other approaches under comparable conditions. Additionally, we benchmark against state-of-the-art models, achieving superior or competitive accuracy. Our results demonstrate that this framework can seamlessly incorporate diverse multi-view representation learning algorithms, providing a foundation for designing novel, problem-specific loss functions.

Title: W-Kernel and Its Principal Space for Frequentist Evaluation of Bayesian Estimators
Authors: Yukito Iba
Abstract: Evaluating the variability of posterior estimates is a key aspect of Bayesian model assessment. In this study, we focus on the posterior covariance matrix W, defined using the log-likelihood of each observation. Previous studies have examined the role of the principal space of W in Bayesian sensitivity analysis, notably MacEachern and Peruggia (2002) and Thomas et al. (2018). In this work, we show that the principal space of W is also relevant for frequentist evaluation, using the recently proposed Bayesian infinitesimal jackknife (IJ) approximation Giordano and Broderick (2023) as a key tool. We next consider the relationship between the matrix W and the Fisher kernel. We show that the Fisher kernel can be regarded as an approximation to W; the matrix W, in itself, can be interpreted as a reproducing kernel, which we refer to as the W-kernel. Based on this connection, we examine the dual relationship between the W-kernel formulation in the data space and the classical asymptotic formulation in the parameter space. These ideas suggest a form of Bayesian-frequentist duality that emerges through the dual structure of kernel PCA, where posterior and frequentist covariances serve as inner products in their respective spaces. As an application, we consider an approximate bootstrap of posterior means based on posterior samples generated by MCMC. We show that the projection onto the principal space of W facilitates frequentist evaluation, particularly of the higher-order term in this procedure. In one of the appendices, we introduce incomplete Cholesky decomposition as an efficient method for computing the principal space of W and discuss the related concept of representative subsets of the observations.

Title: Mining higher-order triadic interactions
Authors: Marta Niedostatek, Anthony Baptista, Jun Yamamoto, Ben MacArthur, Jurgen Kurths, Ruben Sanchez Garcia, Ginestra Bianconi
Abstract: Complex systems often involve higher-order interactions which require us to go beyond their description in terms of pairwise networks. Triadic interactions are a fundamental type of higher-order interaction that occurs when one node regulates the interaction between two other nodes. Triadic interactions are found in a large variety of biological systems, from neuron-glia interactions to gene-regulation and ecosystems. However, triadic interactions have so far been mostly neglected. In this article, we propose a theoretical model that demonstrates that triadic interactions can modulate the mutual information between the dynamical state of two linked nodes. Leveraging this result, we propose the Triadic Interaction Mining (TRIM) algorithm to mine triadic interactions from node metadata, and we apply this framework to gene expression data, finding new candidates for triadic interactions relevant for Acute Myeloid Leukemia. Our work reveals important aspects of higher-order triadic interactions that are often ignored, yet can transform our understanding of complex systems and be applied to a large variety of systems ranging from biology to the climate.

Title: Compressing Hamiltonians with ab initio downfolding for simulating strongly-correlated materials on quantum computers
Authors: Antonios M. Alvertis, Abid Khan, Norm M. Tubman
Abstract: The accurate first-principles description of strongly-correlated materials is an important and challenging problem in condensed matter physics. Ab initio downfolding has emerged as a way of deriving compressed many-body Hamiltonians that maintain the essential physics of strongly-correlated materials. The solution of these material-specific models is still exponentially difficult to generate on classical computers, but quantum algorithms allow for a significant speed-up in obtaining the ground states of these compressed Hamiltonians. Here we demonstrate that utilizing quantum algorithms for obtaining the properties of downfolded Hamiltonians can indeed yield high-fidelity solutions. By combining ab initio downfolding and variational quantum eigensolvers, we correctly predict the antiferromagnetic state of one-dimensional cuprate $\text{Ca}_2\text{CuO}_3$, the excitonic ground state of monolayer $\text{WTe}_2$, and the charge-ordered state of correlated metal $\text{SrVO}_3$. Numerical simulations utilizing a classical tensor network implementation of variational quantum eigensolvers allow us to simulate large models with up to $54$ qubits and encompassing up to four bands in the correlated subspace, which is indicative of the complexity that our framework can address. Through these methods we demonstrate the potential of classical pre-optimization and downfolding techniques for enabling efficient materials simulation using quantum algorithms.

Title: Exploring Intrinsic Bond Orbitals in Solids
Authors: Benjamin Wöckinger, Alexander Rumpf, Tobias Schäfer
Abstract: We present a study of the construction and spatial properties of localized Wannier orbitals in large supercells of insulating solids using plane waves as the underlying basis. The Pipek-Mezey (PM) functional in combination with intrinsic atomic orbitals (IAOs) as projectors is employed, resulting in so-called intrinsic bond orbitals (IBOs). Independent of the bonding type and band gap, a correlation between orbital spreads and geometric properties is observed. As a result, comparable sparsity patterns of the Hartree-Fock exchange matrix are found across all considered bulk 3D materials, exhibiting covalent bonds, polar covalent bonds, and ionic bonds. Recognizing the considerable computational effort required to construct localized Wannier orbitals for large periodic simulation cells, we address the performance and scaling of different solvers for the localization problem. This includes the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS), Conjugate-Gradient (CG), Steepest Ascent (SA) as well as the Direct Inversion in the Iterative Subspace (DIIS) method. Each algorithm performs a Riemannian optimization under unitary matrix constraint, efficiently reaching the optimum in the "curved parameter space" on geodesics. We hereby complement the quantum chemistry and materials science literature with an introduction to this topic along with key references. The solvers have been implemented both within the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) and as a standalone open-source software package. Furthermore, we observe that the construction of Wannier orbitals for supercells of metal oxides presents a significant challenge, requiring approximately one order of magnitude more iteration steps than other systems studied.

Title: More About the Lattice Hamiltonian for Adjoint QCD$_2$
Authors: Ross Dempsey, Silviu S. Pufu, Benjamin T. Søgaard, Igor R. Klebanov
Abstract: In our earlier work arXiv:2311.09334, we introduced a lattice Hamiltonian for Adjoint QCD$_2$ using staggered Majorana fermions. We found the gauge invariant space of states explicitly for the gauge group $\text{SU}(2)$ and used them for numerical calculations of observables, such as the spectrum and the expectation value of the fermion bilinear. In this paper, we carry out a more in-depth study of our lattice model, extending it to any compact and simply-connected gauge group $G$. We show how to find the gauge invariant space of states and use it to study various observables. We also use the lattice model to calculate the mixed 't Hooft anomalies of Adjoint QCD$_2$ for arbitrary $G$. We show that the matrix elements of the lattice Hamiltonian can be expressed in terms of the Wigner 6$j$-symbols of $G$. For $G = \text{SU}(3)$, we perform exact diagonalization for lattices of up to six sites and study the low-lying spectrum, the fermion bilinear condensate, and the string tension. We also show how to write the lattice strong coupling expansion for ground state energies and operator expectation values in terms of the Wigner 6$j$-symbols. For $\text{SU}(3)$ we carry this out explicitly and find good agreement with the exact diagonalizations, and for $\text{SU}(4)$ we give expansions that can be compared with future numerical studies.

Title: Local Clustering and Global Spreading of Receptors for Optimal Spatial Gradient Sensing
Authors: Albert Alonso, Robert G. Endres, Julius B. Kirkegaard
Abstract: Spatial information from cell-surface receptors is crucial for processes that require signal processing and sensing of the environment. Here, we investigate the optimal placement of such receptors through a theoretical model that minimizes uncertainty in gradient estimation. Without requiring a priori knowledge of the physical limits of sensing or biochemical processes, we reproduce the emergence of clusters that closely resemble those observed in real cells. On perfect spherical surfaces, optimally placed receptors spread uniformly. When perturbations break their symmetry, receptors cluster in regions of high curvature, massively reducing estimation uncertainty. This agrees with mechanistic models that minimize elastic preference discrepancies between receptors and cell membranes. We further extend our model to motile receptors responding to cell-shape changes and external fluid flow, demonstrating the relevance of our model in realistic scenarios. Our findings provide a simple and utilitarian explanation for receptor clustering at high-curvature regions when high sensing accuracy is paramount.

Title: Flow-Based Sampling for Entanglement Entropy and the Machine Learning of Defects
Authors: Andrea Bulgarelli, Elia Cellini, Karl Jansen, Stefan Kühn, Alessandro Nada, Shinichi Nakajima, Kim A. Nicoli, Marco Panero
Abstract: We introduce a novel technique to numerically calculate Rényi entanglement entropies in lattice quantum field theory using generative models. We describe how flow-based approaches can be combined with the replica trick using a custom neural-network architecture around a lattice defect connecting two replicas. Numerical tests for the $\phi^4$ scalar field theory in two and three dimensions demonstrate that our technique outperforms state-of-the-art Monte Carlo calculations, and exhibit a promising scaling with the defect size.

Title: Noise-based Local Learning using Stochastic Magnetic Tunnel Junctions
Authors: Kees Koenders, Leo Schnitzpan, Fabian Kammerbauer, Sinan Shu, Gerhard Jakob, Mathis Kläui, Johan Mentink, Nasir Ahmad, Marcel van Gerven
Abstract: Brain-inspired learning in physical hardware has enormous potential to learn fast at minimal energy expenditure. One of the characteristics of biological learning systems is their ability to learn in the presence of various noise sources. Inspired by this observation, we introduce a novel noise-based learning approach for physical systems implementing multi-layer neural networks. Simulation results show that our approach allows for effective learning whose performance approaches that of the conventional effective yet energy-costly backpropagation algorithm. Using a spintronics hardware implementation, we demonstrate experimentally that learning can be achieved in a small network composed of physical stochastic magnetic tunnel junctions. These results provide a path towards efficient learning in general physical systems which embraces rather than mitigates the noise inherent in physical devices.

Abstract: Fixed-node diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (FN-DMC) is a widely-trusted many-body method for solving the Schrödinger equation, known for its reliable predictions of material and molecular properties. Furthermore, its excellent scalability with system complexity and near-perfect utilization of computational power makes FN-DMC ideally positioned to leverage new advances in computing to address increasingly complex scientific problems. Even though the method is widely used as a computational gold standard, reproducibility across the numerous FN-DMC code implementations has yet to be demonstrated. This difficulty stems from the diverse array of DMC algorithms and trial wave functions, compounded by the method's inherent stochastic nature. This study represents a community-wide effort to address the titular question, affirming that: Yes, FN-DMC is reproducible (when handled with care). Using the water-methane dimer as the canonical test case, we compare results from eleven different FN-DMC codes and show that the approximations to treat the non-locality of pseudopotentials are the primary source of the discrepancies between them. In particular, we demonstrate that, for the same choice of determinantal component in the trial wave function, reliable and reproducible predictions can be achieved by employing the T-move (TM), the determinant locality approximation (DLA), or the determinant T-move (DTM) schemes, while the older locality approximation (LA) leads to considerable variability in results. This work lays the foundation to establish accurate and reproducible FN-DMC estimates for all future studies across applications in materials science, physics, chemistry, and biology.

Title: First Measurement of Entanglement Dynamics in the SYK Model using Quantum Computers
Authors: Talal Ahmed Chowdhury, Kwangmin Yu, Raza Sabbir Sufian
Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, fundamental to quantum chaos, many-body physics, and holographic duality, exhibits both maximal chaos and exact solvability, yet its entanglement entropy has never been measured experimentally. Here, we present the first measurement of entanglement entropy growth under the SYK Hamiltonian using IBM's superconducting quantum computer as a programmable quantum platform. We implement an optimized swap-based many-body interference protocol tailored for limited qubit connectivity to measure entanglement entropy. Additionally, we enhance the randomized measurement protocol for entropy measurement by expanding the unitary ensemble, which increases the circuit volume and pushes the capability of the near-term devices. However, we tackle this challenge by employing a quantum multi-programming strategy that parallelizes circuit execution. This work paves the way for exploring chaotic quantum dynamics and establishes scalable methods for investigating complex entanglement growth on current quantum platforms.
