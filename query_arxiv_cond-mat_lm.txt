Title: Dynamic Plastic Deformation Delocalization in FCC Solid Solution Metals
Authors: Dhruv Anjaria, Milan Heczko, Daegun YoU, Mathieu Calvat, Shuchi Sanandiya, Maik Rajkowski, Aditya Srinivasan Tirunilai, Huseyin Sehitoglu, Guillaume Laplanche, J.C. Stinville
Abstract: Metallic materials undergo irreversible deformation under mechanical loading, leading to intense local plastic localization that reduces their mechanical performance. We identify a new mechanism of plastic deformation localization that dynamically promotes the homogenization of plasticity in face-centered cubic solid solution-strengthened metallic alloys. We observe that this mechanism occurs within a narrow range of stacking fault energies and involves competing deformation between nanoscale twinning and slip. This phenomenon is attributed to a new mechanism referred to as dynamic plastic deformation delocalization, which opens a new design space for enhancing the mechanical performance of metallic materials. We demonstrate that the activation of this mechanism has a significant impact on fatigue properties, greatly enhancing fatigue strength when it occurs.

Title: Grain Size and Temperature-Dependent Response of 5-mol% Gd-Doped Ceria to Swift Heavy Ion Irradiation with 80 MeV Ag and 120 MeV Au Ions
Authors: Waseem Ul Haq, V. Grover, Sanjay Kedia, Santanu Ghosh
Abstract: The response of 5-mol% Gd-doped ceria to swift heavy ion beam irradiation has been studied to observe the effects of changes in ion energies and environmental temperature. The study involved irradiating two different grain sizes (nano and bulk) with two different ion energies: 80 MeV Ag and 120 MeV Au. Additionally, a comprehensive analysis of Gd-doped ceria's response to ion beam irradiation at high temperatures (1000 K) was conducted, taking into account the effect of grain size dependency. Based on GIXRD and Raman spectroscopy, it is evident that electronic excitation from 80 MeV Ag and 120 MeV Au ions at a fluence $1 \times 10^{14}$ ions/cm$^2$ caused damage to Gd-doped ceria samples. However, bulk grain size shows significant stability against SHI in all cases. These findings align with thermal spike simulations and indicate the formation of ion tracks due to electronic excitation by Swift Heavy Ion beam irradiation.

Title: The Symmetry Taco: Equivalences between Gapped, Gapless, and Mixed-State SPTs
Authors: Marvin Qi, Ramanjit Sohal, Xie Chen, David T. Stephen, Abhinav Prem
Abstract: Symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT), or topological holography, offers a unifying framework for describing quantum phases of matter and phase transitions between them. While this approach has seen remarkable success in describing gapped and gapless pure-state phases in $1+1$d, its applicability to open quantum systems remains entirely unexplored. In this work, we propose a natural extension of the SymTFT framework to mixed-state phases by introducing the \textit{symmetry taco}: a bilayer topological order in $2+1$d whose folded geometry naturally encapsulates both strong and weak symmetries of the $1+1$d theory. We use this perspective to identify a series of correspondences, including a one-to-one map between intrinsically gapless SPTs (igSPTs) and certain gapped SPTs, and a mapping between igSPTs and intrinsically average SPTs (iASPTs) arising in $1+1$d mixed states. More broadly, our framework yields a classification of short-range correlated $G$-symmetric Choi states in $1+1$d, provides a route for systematically generating mixed-state SPTs via local decoherence of igSPTs, and allows us to identify a new mixed-state ``anomaly". Besides folding in mixed-state phases into the SymTFT paradigm, the symmetry taco opens new avenues for exploring dualities, anomalies, and non-equilibrium criticality in mixed-state quantum matter.

Title: Thermal SU(2) lattice gauge theory for the pseudogap and the transition to $d$-wave superconductivity in the cuprates
Authors: Harshit Pandey, Maine Christos, Pietro M. Bonetti, Ravi Shanker, Sayantan Sharma, Subir Sachdev
Abstract: We study a square lattice SU(2) gauge theory with link variables $U$, formulated to describe the intermediate temperature pseudogap metal phase of underdoped cuprates of hole density $p$, and its evolution into nodal $d$-wave superconductivity upon cooling. The theory features two fermionic matter sectors: one consists of SU(2)-gauge-neutral, electron-like quasiparticles forming hole pockets; the other is a critical quantum spin liquid composed of electrically neutral spinons, carrying spin $S = 1/2$, Dirac nodes, and transforming in the fundamental representation of the SU(2) gauge group. These sectors interact via a Yukawa coupling to a spinless Higgs boson $B$, which carries electric charge $+e$ and also transforms under the fundamental representation of SU(2). The theory arises from a canonical transformation of the square lattice Hubbard model and a pair of ancilla qubits on each site, along with a specific choice of the spin liquid. We employ a Born-Oppenheimer-type approximation: thermal fluctuations of the bosons $B$ and $U$ are treated classically, while the fermions are fully quantum. Monte Carlo simulations of an effective boson energy functional are consistent with a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition involving $h/(2e)$ vortices, driving the onset of $d$-wave superconductivity. Each vortex is surrounded by a halo of charge order, consistent with scanning tunneling microscopy observations by Hoffman et al. (arXiv:cond-mat/0201348). Above the transition, the electron spectral function exhibits "Fermi arcs", in agreement with ARPES data by Norman et al. (arXiv:cond-mat/9710163) and Shen et al. (Science 307, 901 (2005)). Our model also displays quantum oscillations with area $p/8$ under a magnetic field, aligning with recent evidence via the Yamaji effect by Chan et al. (arXiv:2411.10631).

Title: Topological phase diagram of twisted bilayer graphene as a function of the twist angle
Authors: Leonardo A. Navarro-Labastida, Pierre A. Pantaleon, Francisco Guinea, Gerardo G. Naumis
Abstract: Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) hosts a rich landscape of electronic phases arising from the interplay between strong electron-electron interactions and nontrivial band topology. While the flat bands near zero energy are central to many correlated phenomena, their interaction with higher-energy remote bands remains less understood. Here, we investigate these hybridization processes as a function of the twist angle and analyze their impact on the charge distribution, topological properties such as Chern number, quantum metric, and orbital magnetic energy. We identify multiple topological phase transitions between magic angles, driven by band inversions at high-symmetry points in momentum space. Notably, the central bands can exhibit phases with Chern numbers C = 2, revealing previously unreported topological states in TBG.

Title: Symmetry-determined generalized ferromagnetism in multi-valley electron fluids
Authors: Vladimir Calvera, Erez Berg, Steven A. Kivelson
Abstract: Quantum electronic fluids with spin and valley degrees of freedom have a correlation driven tendency to flavor polarization (generalized ferromagnetism). To first order in the long-range Coulomb interactions -- i.e. in the Hartree-Fock approximation -- spin and valley polarization exhibit a spurious degeneracy. We show that to second order -- or more generally in the random-phase approximation -- this degeneracy is lifted in a way that depends only on the underlying symmetry relating the two valleys. In two spatial dimensions, if the valleys are related by an $n-$fold rotation ($n>2$) or by mirror reflection and each valley is invariant under $C_2$ or time reversal (as is the case in AlAs quantum wells) then valley polarization is preferred. If the valleys are related by time reversal or by $C_2$ rotation symmetry (as in multilayer graphene systems) then spin order is selected.

Title: Interaction-enhanced quantum to classical crossover temperature in a Luttinger liquid
Authors: Yen-Wen Lu, Michael Mulligan
Abstract: We study electrical and thermal transport in a one-dimensional Luttinger liquid coupled to a three-dimensional acoustic phonon in both the ``clean" (umklapp scattering) and ``dirty" (disorder scattering) limits using the memory matrix formalism. By explicitly incorporating the Debye cutoff on phonon frequencies, we consider the low and high temperature transport regimes. We find the crossover temperature separating these two regimes to be interaction-dependent, with repulsive interactions increasing the crossover temperature by at most an order of magnitude. This provides an illustration for how interactions can enhance the low-temperature scattering regime in an interacting Fermi system.

Title: Jammed disks of two sizes in a channel: segregation driven by steric forces
Authors: Dan Liu, Michael Karbach, Gerhard Müller
Abstract: Disks of two sizes are confined to a long and narrow channel. The axis and the plane of the channel are horizontal. The channel is closed off by pistons that freeze jammed microstates out of loose disk configurations, agitated randomly at calibrated intensity and subject to moderate pressure. Disk sizes and channel width are such that under jamming no disks remain loose and all disks touch one wall. The protocol permits disks to move past each other prior to jamming, which facilitates randomness in the sequence of large and small disks. We present exact results for the characterization of jammed macrostates including volume and entropy for given fractions of small and large disks as functions of energy parameters which depend on the jamming protocol. Our analysis divides the disk sequence of jammed microstates into overlapping tiles out of which we construct 17 species of statistically interacting quasiparticles. Jammed macrostates then depend on the fractions of small and large disks and on a dimensionless control parameter inferred from measures for expansion work against the pistons and intensity of random agitations. Two models are introduced for comparison of key technical aspects: one model emphasizes symmetry and the other mechanical stability. We distinguish regimes for the energy parameters that either enhance or suppress mixing of disk sizes in jammed macrostates. The latter case, if realizable, is a manifestation of grain segregation driven by steric forces alone, without directional bias.

Title: Model-based study of a nanowire heating and dynamic axisymmetric necking by surface electromigration
Authors: Mikhail Khenner
Abstract: Axisymmetric solid-state necking of a single-crystal metallic nanowire in a thermal contact with a substrate and subjected to a surface electromigration current is accompanied by a local current crowding and a sharp rise of a resistivity of a wire material in a thinning neck. This results in a temperature spike at the neck, which feedback affects the necking via thermomigration and the temperature-dependent surface diffusivity of the adatoms. A model that incorporates these effects and couples the nonlinear dynamics of a wire temperature and a wire radius for a necking wire is presented. Conditions on the physical parameters are derived that ensure a straight wire is in the solid state prior to an onset of a morphological instability that ultimately breaks a wire via a pinch-off. The impacts of a wire radius and a wire length on the temperature spike at the break junction are studied.

Title: Electronic transport and anti-super-Klein tunneling in few-layer black phosphorous
Authors: Jorge Alfonso Lizarraga-Brito, Armando Arciniega-Gutiérrez, Yonatan Betancur-Ocampo, Thomas Stegmann
Abstract: The electronic transport in few-layer black phosphorus (FLBP) nanoribbons is studied theoretically. The system is modeled on the basis of band-structures, which have been measured recently by $\mu$-ARPES experiments. We show that the anisotropic bands of FLBP leads to highly anisotropic transport properties; while the current in one direction can be rather focused, it can be strongly disperse in the orthogonal direction. The low-energy current is carried mainly in the central layer due to the vertical confinement of the electrons. In FLBP pn junctions, generated by the electrostatic potential of a gate contact in a certain region of the system, the electrons pass through the interface of the junction, if it is oriented along the zigzag direction of FLBP. If the junction is rotated by 90 degree and oriented along the armchair direction, the current is reflected completely for all angles of incidence and for a wide range of electron energies. This omni-directional total reflection is named anti-super-Klein tunneling as it is due to opposite pseudo-spins of the electrons in the two region of the pn junction. The effect of oxidation of the top layer of FLBP pn junctions is investigated and it is found that, while the current flow in the top layers is strongly suppressed, the anti-super-Klein tunneling persists.

Title: Fast nanothermometry based on direct electron detection of electron backscattering diffraction patterns
Authors: Ryan Gnabasik, Razan O. Nughays, Ashlynn Overholser, Vijay Kumar, Shantal Adajian, Nicolò Maria della Ventura, Daniel S. Gianola, Bolin Liao
Abstract: Accurate temperature measurement at the nanoscale is crucial for thermal management in next-generation microelectronic devices. Existing optical and scanning-probe thermometry techniques face limitations in spatial resolution, accuracy, or invasiveness. In this work, we demonstrate a fast and non-contact nanothermometry method based on temperature-induced changes in electron backscattering diffraction (EBSD) patterns captured by a high-performance direct electron detector within a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Using dynamical electron simulations, we establish the theoretical temperature sensitivity limits for several semiconductors (Si, Ge, GaAs, and GaN), showing that thermal diffuse scattering (TDS) leads to a measurable smearing of Kikuchi bands in the EBSD patterns. We develop a Fourier analysis method that captures these subtle changes across the full diffraction pattern, achieving a simulated temperature sensitivity of approximately 0.15\% per K. Experimental results on silicon confirm a sensitivity of 0.14\% per K and achieve a 13-K temperature uncertainty with a 10-second acquisition time, and enable spatial temperature mapping under thermal gradients. Our approach offers a pathway toward practical and high-resolution thermal mapping directly in SEMs, expanding the toolbox for device-level thermal diagnostics.

Title: Proximity effect and p-wave superconductivity in s-wave superconductor/helimagnet heterostructures
Authors: G. A. Bobkov, A. V. Kornev, A. M. Bobkov, I. V. Bobkova
Abstract: It is known that in contrast to homogeneous ferromagnetism helical magnetism is compatible with superconductivity and causes only weak suppressive effect on superconducting critical temperature. Despite this fact it induces p-wave triplet superconducting correlations in homogeneous superconducting systems with intrinsic helical magnetism. The combination of these two facts indicates a high potential for the application of such systems in disspationless spintronics. For this reason here we investigate the proximity effect in atomically thin superconductor/helical (conical) magnet heterostructures (SC/HM). It is shown that in SC/HM heterostructures the strength of the proximity effect and, in particular, amplitude of p-wave triplet superconductivity and the degree of superconductivity suppression are complex functions of the magnet exchange field and filling factors of the magnet and the superconductor. Further we demonstrate that $p$-wave correlations ensure transport spin supercurrent flow in the SC/HM heterostructure with conical magnets and unveil the physical relationship between the transport spin supercurrent, degree of the magnet conicity and internal structure of p-wave correlations in the momentum space.

Title: MBFormer: A General Transformer-based Learning Paradigm for Many-body Interactions in Real Materials
Authors: Bowen Hou, Xian Xu, Jinyuan Wu, Diana Y. Qiu
Abstract: Recently, radical progress in machine learning (ML) has revolutionized computational materials science, enabling unprecedentedly rapid materials discovery and property prediction, but the quantum many-body problem -- which is the key to understanding excited-state properties, ranging from transport to optics -- remains challenging due to the complexity of the nonlocal and energy-dependent interactions. Here, we propose a symmetry-aware, grid-free, transformer-based model, MBFormer, that is designed to learn the entire many-body hierarchy directly from mean-field inputs, exploiting the attention mechanism to accurately capture many-body correlations between mean-field states. As proof of principle, we demonstrate the capability of MBFormer in predicting results based on the GW plus Bethe Salpeter equation (GW-BSE) formalism, including quasiparticle energies, exciton energies, exciton oscillator strengths, and exciton wavefunction distribution. Our model is trained on a dataset of 721 two-dimensional materials from the C2DB database, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a low prediction mean absolute error (MAE) on the order of 0.1-0.2 eV for state-level quasiparticle and exciton energies across different materials. Moreover, we show explicitly that the attention mechanism plays a crucial role in capturing many-body correlations. Our framework provides an end-to-end platform from ground states to general many-body prediction in real materials, which could serve as a foundation model for computational materials science.

Title: The role of electron interactions in a failed insulator revealed by shot noise
Authors: Mateusz Szurek, Hanqiao Cheng, Zilu Pang, Yiou Zhang, Sergei Urazhdin
Abstract: In materials known as failed insulators, electrical resistivity increases as temperature decreases, yet does not diverge - a phenomenon inconsistent with single-particle theories. We investigate the origin of this behavior by measuring shot noise in nanojunctions of nitrogen-doped beta-Ta, a prototypical failed insulator. Junctions as short as 8 nanometers exhibit hot-electron shot noise, indicating strong electron interactions. We show that charge hopping mediated by these interactions explains the anomalous electronic properties. Our findings open new avenues for exploiting electron interactions in spin-orbitronic and superconducting applications of failed insulators.

Title: Revealing the Void-Size Distribution of Silica Glass using Persistent Homology
Authors: Achraf Atila, Yasser Bakhouch, Zhuocheng Xie
Abstract: Oxide glasses have proven to be useful across a wide range of technological applications. Nevertheless, their medium-range structure has remained elusive. Previous studies focused on the ring statistics as a metric for the medium-range structure, which, however, provides an incomplete picture of the glassy structure. Here, we use atomistic simulations and state-of-the-art topological analysis tools, namely persistent homology (PH), to analyze the medium-range structure of the archetypal oxide glass (Silica) at ambient temperatures and with varying pressures. PH presents an unbiased definition of loops and voids, providing an advantage over other methods for studying the structure and topology of complex materials, such as glasses, across multiple length scales. We captured subtle topological transitions in medium-range order and cavity distributions, providing new insights into glass structure. Our work provides a robust way for extracting the void distribution of oxide glasses based on persistent homology.

Title: Nonvolatile Nematic Order Manipulated by Strain and Magnetic Field in a Layered Antiferromagnet
Authors: Zili Feng, Weihang Lu, Tao Lu, Fangyan Liu, Joseph R. Sheeran, Mengxing Ye, Jing Xia, Takashi Kurumaji, Linda Ye
Abstract: The operation mechanism of nematic liquid crystals lies in the control of their optical properties by the orientation of underlying nematic directors. In analogy, electronic nematicity refers to a state whose electronic properties spontaneously break rotation symmetries of the host crystalline lattice, leading to anisotropic electronic properties. In this work, we demonstrate that the layered antiferromagnet CoTa$_3$S$_6$ exhibits a switchable nematic order, evidenced by the emergence of both resistivity anisotropy and optical birefringence. This nematic state sets in at a temperature $T^*$ distinct from that of the antiferromagnetic transitions in the system, indicating a separate symmetry-breaking mechanism. The nematic order can be manipulated either by an in-plane rotation symmetry-breaking strain or in-plane magnetic field, with the latter exhibiting a pronounced non-volatile memory effect. Remarkably, we find that the broken three-fold rotation symmetry in electronic transport is restored with a moderate out-of-plane field. We hypothesize that the nematicity is of electronic origin and emerges from instabilities associated with van Hove singularities. The resulting phase diagram points to an intertwined interplay between the electronic nematicity and the proposed underlying collinear and non-coplanar spin orders. Our findings establish CoTa$_3$S$_6$ as a versatile antiferromagnetic platform with highly tunable functionalities arising from the breaking of rotational, time-reversal, and inversion symmetries.

Title: Elementary Steps of Energy Conversion in Strongly Correlated Systems: Beyond Single Quasiparticles and Rigid Bands
Authors: V. Moshnyaga, Ch. Jooss P. E. Blöchl, V. Bruchmann-Bamberg, A. Dehning, L. Allen-Rump, C. Hausmann, M. Krüger, A. Rathnakaran, S. Rajpurohit, D. Steil, C. Flathmann, J. Hoffmann, M. Seibt, C. Volkert
Abstract: Energy conversion in materials can be considered as a sequence of elementary steps initiated by a primary excitation. While these steps are quite well understood in classical semiconductors in terms of quasiparticle (QP) excitations and interactions, their understanding in strongly correlated materials is still elusive. Here, we review the progress which has been achieved over recent years by studies of manganite perovskite oxides as a model system for materials with strong correlations. They show a subtle interplay of different types of correlations, i.e., electron-phonon, electron-electron and spin-spin, resulting in rich physical phenomena due to competition between different ground states accompanied by temperature- and field-induced phase transitions. They strongly impact various types of energy conversion and transport processes including friction at surfaces, thermal transport, time-, energy- and power-dependent optical excitations as well as photovoltaic energy conversion. The underlying microscopic processes can be broken down to the behavior of the low-energy thermal and high-energy optical excitations, their interactions, transport and conversion which are theoretically analyzed by using models of interacting and tunable QPs: Their nature and interactions can change during excitation, transport and phase transitions, thus modifying electronic structure. At sufficiently high stimulation, QP excitations can even induce or actuate phase transitions. As a result, we obtained a comprehensive understanding of energy conversion steps going far beyond single QP pictures and rigid band approximations well-known for conventional semiconductors.

Title: Identifying Exceptional Points in Two-Dimensional Excitons Coupled to an Open Optical Cavity
Authors: Ben Johns, Nitin Yadav, Anand Vinod, Kuljeet Kaur, Jino George
Abstract: Strong coupling in the conventional sense requires that the Rabi cycling process between two interacting states is faster than other dissipation rates. Some recent experimental findings show intriguing properties that were attributed to polaritonic states (e.g., plexcitons) even though the above criterion is not satisfied. Here, we theoretically predict and provide experimental evidence of polariton-like behavior in a system that does not show Rabi splitting. The photoluminescence of an exciton-cavity system consisting of a two-dimensional exciton monolayer (tungsten disulfide, WS2) coupled to a planar, open, one-mirror optical cavity configuration is studied. We experimentally observed a transition from the weak coupling regime crossing an exceptional point to form polariton-like states by varying the coupling strength and the cavity loss. Our observations are fully in agreement with a theoretical quasi-normal mode analysis, which predicts this transition and confirms the presence of exceptional points in the system. These results provide evidence that polaritonic effects can be experimentally observed even when the conventional strong coupling condition is not satisfied.

Title: Putative non-trivial topology in YNiSn$_{2}$ Dirac semimetal

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the properties of single-crystalline YNiSn$_{2}$ through x-ray powder diffraction, elemental analysis, electrical resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and specific heat measurements. YNiSn$_{2}$ crystallizes in an orthorhombic structure within the Cmcm space group (63), forming plate-like crystals with the $b$ axis oriented out of the plane. The compound exhibits weak Pauli paramagnetism with a susceptibility of $\chi_{0} = 2(3) \times 10^{-5}$ emu/mol-Oe and a small Sommerfeld coefficient of $\gamma = 4$ mJ/mol$\cdot$K$^{2}$, indicating a low density of states at the Fermi level. Notably, at 1.8 K, YNiSn$_{2}$ displays a giant positive magnetoresistance of nearly 1000\%, which increases quasi-linearly with the magnetic field up to $B = 16$ T, alongside a field-induced metal-insulator-like crossover under applied magnetic fields $>$ 3 T. Furthermore, highly anisotropic dHvA quantum oscillations suggest a two-dimensional electronic band character from which a low effective mass and a high Fermi velocity could be extracted.

Title: Revealing THz optical signatures of Shiba-state-induced gapped and gapless superconductivity
Authors: F. Yang, R. Y. Fang, S. L. Zhang, L. Q. Chen
Abstract: Understanding the interplay of superconductivity and magnetic disorder has been a long-standing challenge. Here we report a fully self-consistent calculation of the complex renormalization by exchange interactions and hence the complete phase diagram of conventional $s$-wave superconductors with magnetic impurities as well as the related physical properties including the optical response. We show that a small amount of magnetic disorder can drive the system into a gapless superconducting state, where the single-particle excitation gap vanishes whereas the superconducting order parameter $\Delta_0$ remains finite. In this phase, the linear optical conductivity exhibits a finite absorption over the low-frequency regime, particularly for photon energies below the conventional threshold $2|\Delta_0|$, even at low temperatures, in sharp contrast to the gapped state. The nonlinear response, however, remains coherent and is dominated by the Higgs-mode dynamics rather than gapless quasiparticle background. These findings reveal a fundamental distinction between dissipative single-particle excitations and coherent collective dynamics of the condensate, a feature likely general to other gapless superconductors, and introduces a fundamentally different detection scheme, using THz spectroscopy to probe the signatures of Shiba states.

Title: Altermagnetism-induced non-collinear superconducting diode effect and unidirectional superconducting transport
Authors: F. Yang, L. Q. Chen
Abstract: Current studies of non-reciprocal superconducting (SC) transport have centered on the forward-backward asymmetry of the critical current measured along a single axis. In most realizations, this diode effect is achieved via introducing ferromagnetism or applying an external magnetic field, which drives system into an effective Fulde-Ferrell (FF) state but often at the cost of severely suppressing the SC gap and thus compromising device robustness. Here we propose and theoretically demonstrate that coupling a conventional $s$-wave SC thin film to a $d$-wave altermagnet offers a more resilient alternative. The momentum-dependent spin splitting inherent to altermagnets induces a non-collinear SC-diode effect in the BCS state, with the critical-current anisotropy exhibiting a fourfold ($C_4$) symmetry. Upon entering the FF state at large splitting, this anisotropy gradually evolves into a unidirectional ($C_1$) pattern. Crucially, the FF pairing momentum locks to the discrete crystal axes, eliminating the rotational Goldstone mode and preserving a sizable SC gap without any abrupt or significant suppression. These combined features make the altermagnetic proximity an appealing platform to engineer symmetry-protected, energy-efficient and programmable SC diodes for next-generation electronic devices.

Title: Direct observation of the compression behavior of polystyrene microbeads in a diamond anvil cell
Authors: Haruto Moriguchi, Ken Niwa, Masashi Hasegawa, Yusuke Koide, Takato Ishida, Takashi Uneyama, Yuichi Masubuchi
Abstract: The pressure dependence of the bulk modulus of glassy polystyrene (PS) was measured in the relatively high-pressure regime, up to 6 GPa, at ambient temperature. For the measurements, PS microbeads were immersed in a pressure medium consisting of a mixture of methanol and ethanol, and the sample was placed in a diamond anvil cell capable of generating high and hydrostatic pressure. The volume change of the PS beads was observed under an optical microscope. The results demonstrated that the volume change in this study is consistent with an equation of state determined from the earlier studies in the low-pressure range up to 0.2 GPa. The bulk modulus was obtained as the derivative of the microbead volume with respect to pressure, and compared with the earlier data obtained from Brillouin spectroscopy.

Title: Self-organized first-order transition from foreshock to mainshock in earthquake sequences induced by heat, fluid pressure, and porosity
Authors: Takehito Suzuki, Hiroshi Matsukawa
Abstract: Earthquake cycles are studied by taking into account the interactions among slip, fluid pressure, temperature, and porosity on the fault planes, which are known to play a crucial role in earthquake dynamics. The spring-block model with a single block is employed. A first-order transition from foreshock to mainshock occurring spontaneously in earthquake sequences is discovered both analytically and numerically. This transition is induced by these interactions. It is shown that the function of the slip distance $u$, $F(u)$, defined as the sum of the difference between the energies stored in the driving spring before and after the slippage, and the energy dissipated during the slippage, governs the transition. The equation, $F(u)=0$, represents the energy balance before and after the slippage, and the solution $u=u_f$ describes the realized slip distance for each slippage event. The solutions discontinuously transition from small to large slippages in the sequence of earthquakes. This transition can be interpreted to be a self-organized first-order transition from small to large slippages. The former slippage is governed by pore generation, whereas the latter is governed by thermal pressurization. A phase diagram of the foreshocks and mainshocks, which is also considered a phase diagram of slow and fast earthquakes, is obtained.

Title: On void formation during the simulated tensile testing of polymer-filler particle composites
Authors: John J. Karnes, Supun S. Mohottalalage, Amitesh Maiti, Andrew P. Saab, Todd H. Weisgraber
Abstract: We simulate a series of model polymer composites, composed of linear polymer strands and spherical, monodisperse filler particles (FP). These molecular dynamics simulations implement a coarse-grained, bead-spring force field and we vary several formulation parameters to study their respective influences on material properties. These parameters include FP radius, FP volume fraction, temperature, and the polymer-polymer, FP-FP, and polymer-FP interaction potentials. Uniaxial extension of the simulation cells allows direct comparison of mechanical reinforcement (or weakening) provided by the FP. We focus on the formation of microscopic voids during simulated tensile testing of glassy polymer composites and quantify how the characteristic spatial and morphological arrangement of these voids is a function of interaction potentials used in the simulation. We discuss the implications of these findings in the context of polymer composite design and formulation.

Title: Revisiting Multi-Wave Resonance in Classical Lattices: Quasi-Resonances, Not Exact Resonance, Govern Energy Redistribution
Authors: Wei Lin, Yong Zhang, Hong Zhao
Abstract: The multi-wave exact resonance condition is a fundamental principle for understanding energy transfer in condensed matter systems, yet the dynamical evolution of waves satisfying this condition remains unexplored. Here, we reveal that the multi-wave resonant kinetic equations possess distinctive symmetry properties that preferentially induce energy equalization between counter-propagating waves of identical frequency. This initial equalization disrupts the exact resonance condition, rendering it dynamically invalid. We further demonstrate that nonlinearity-mediated multi-wave quasi-resonances--not exact resonances--overn energy transfer and drive the system toward thermalization. Crucially, the strength of exact resonances decays with increasing system size, while quasi-resonance strength grows. Moreover, exact resonance strength remains independent of nonlinearity, whereas quasi-resonance strength diminishes with reduced nonlinearity. These observations provide additional evidence supporting the aforementioned conclusion while elucidating the size-dependent thermalization characteristics in lattice systems.

Title: MP-ALOE: An r2SCAN dataset for universal machine learning interatomic potentials
Authors: Matthew C. Kuner, Aaron D. Kaplan, Kristin A. Persson, Mark Asta, Daryl C. Chrzan
Abstract: We present MP-ALOE, a dataset of nearly 1 million DFT calculations using the accurate r2SCAN meta-generalized gradient approximation. Covering 89 elements, MP-ALOE was created using active learning and primarily consists of off-equilibrium structures. We benchmark a machine learning interatomic potential trained on MP-ALOE, and evaluate its performance on a series of benchmarks, including predicting the thermochemical properties of equilibrium structures; predicting forces of far-from-equilibrium structures; maintaining physical soundness under static extreme deformations; and molecular dynamic stability under extreme temperatures and pressures. MP-ALOE shows strong performance on all of these benchmarks, and is made public for the broader community to utilize.

Title: Direct observation of locally modified excitonic effect within a moiré unit cell in twisted bilayer graphene
Authors: Ming Liu, Ryosuke Senga, Masanori Koshino, Yung-Chang Lin, Kazu Suenaga
Abstract: Bilayer graphene, forming moiré superlattices, possesses distinct electronic and optical properties derived from the hybridization of energy band and the emergence of van Hove singularities depending on its twist angle. Extensive research has been conducted on the global characteristics of moiré superlattice induced by long-range periodicity. However, limited attention has been given to the local properties within a moiré unit cell, which undoubtedly differ due to the variations in three-dimensional atomic arrangement. Here we demonstrate the highly localized excitations of carbon 1s electrons to unoccupied van Hove singularities in a twisted bilayer graphene using an electron energy loss spectroscopy based on a monochromated transmission electron microscope. The core-level excitations associated with the van Hove singularities show a systematic twist angle dependence which is analogous to the optical excitations. Furthermore, local variations in those core-level van Hove singularity peaks within a moiré unit cell have been corroborated for the first time, which can originate from core-exciton lifetimes and band modifications influenced by the local stacking geometry.

Title: Spin transport phenomena in junctions composed of a compensated ferrimagnet and a normal metal
Authors: Xin Theng Lee, Takahiro Misawa, Mamoru Matsuo, Takeo Kato
Abstract: Altermagnets and compensated ferrimagnets have attracted considerable attention as key building blocks in spintronics devices, owing to their dual advantages of ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. In particular, compensated ferrimagnets exhibit isotropic spin splitting in their electronic and magnon dispersions, despite having zero net magnetization. This characteristic feature enables spin transport phenomena analogous to those in ferromagnets. However, quantitative evaluations of such spin transport phenomena, particularly in comparison to conventional ferromagnets, remain unexplored. Here we investigate spin pumping and spin Seebeck effects in a junction between a compensated ferrimagnet and a normal metal using the non-equilibrium Green's function method. We find that the isotropic spin splitting in magnon dispersions gives rise to spin transport phenomena similar to those observed in ferromagnets. Our results provide a solid theoretical foundation for the applications of exotic collinear antiferromagnets with spin splitting to spintronics devices.

Title: Uncovering coupled ionic-polaronic dynamics and interfacial enhancement in Li$_x$FePO$_4$
Authors: Fengyu Xie, Yuxiang Gao, Ruoyu Wang, Zhicheng Zhong
Abstract: Understanding and controlling coupled ionic-polaronic dynamics is crucial for optimizing electrochemical performance in battery materials. However, studying such coupled dynamics remains challenging due to the intricate interplay between Li-ion configurations, polaron charge ordering, and lattice vibrations. Here, we develop a fine-tuned machine-learned force field (MLFF) for Li$_x$FePO$_4$ that captures coupled ion-polaron behavior. Our simulations reveal picosecond-scale polaron flips occurring orders of magnitude faster than Li-ion migration, featuring strong correlation to Li configurations. Notably, polaron charge fluctuations are further enhanced at Li-rich/Li-poor phase boundaries, suggesting a potential interfacial electronic conduction mechanism. These results demonstrate the capability of fine-tuned MLFFs to resolve complex coupled transport and provide insight into emergent ionic-polaronic dynamics in multivalent battery cathodes.

Title: Defect migration and phase transformations in 2D iron chloride inside bilayer graphene
Authors: Qiunan Liu, Haiming Sun, Yung-Chang Lin, Mahdi Ghorbani-Asl, Silvan Kretschmer, Chi-Chun Cheng, Po-Wen Chiu, Hiroki Ago, Arkady V. Krasheninnikov, Kazu Suenaga
Abstract: The intercalation of metal chlorides, and particularly iron chlorides, into graphitic carbon structures has recently received lots of attention, as it can not only protect this two-dimensional (2D) magnetic system from the effects of the environment, but also substantially alter the magnetic, electronic, and optical properties of both intercalant and host material. At the same time, the intercalation can result in the formation of structural defects, or defects can appear under external stimuli, which can affect materials performance. These aspects have received so far little attention in the dedicated experiments. In this study, we investigate the behavior of atomic-scale defects in iron chlorides intercalated into bilayer graphene (BLG) by using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and first-principles calculations. We observe transformations between the FeCl2 and FeCl3 phases and elucidate the role of defects in the transformations. Specifically, three types of defects are identified: Fe vacancies in FeCl2 domains, Fe adatoms and interstitials in FeCl3 domains, each exhibiting distinct dynamic behaviors. We also observed a crystalline phase with an unusual stoichiometry of Fe5Cl18 which has not been reported before. Our findings not only advance the understanding of intercalation mechanism of 2D materials but also highlight the profound impact of atomic-scale defects on their properties and potential technological applications.

Title: Unified Statistical Theory of Heat Conduction in Nonuniform Media
Authors: Yi Zeng, Jianjun Dong
Abstract: We present a theory of heat conduction that encompasses and extends the classical paradigm defined by Fourier law and the Kapitza interfacial conductance model. Derived from the Zwanzig projection operator formalism, our approach introduces a spatiotemporal kernel function of heat conduction, which governs the spatiotemporal response of the local heat flux in nonuniform media to surrounding temperature gradients while incorporating temporal memory effects. Our statistical analysis shows that memory, nonlocality, and interfacial temperature discontinuities emerge naturally from the microscopic coupling between two classes of irrelevant degrees of freedom: flux mode and nonlocal mode variables. Although these irrelevant variables are not directly observable at the macroscopic level, their integrated influence on the heat flux is fully encoded in the kernel function. In the diffusive limit, the kernel recovers and generalizes Fourier law by replacing the thermal conductivity with an infinite hierarchy of position dependent higher order tensors that capture nanoscale nonlocality. We also outline atomistic strategies for computing the spatiotemporal kernel in various classes of material media, enabling predictive modeling of heat transport in structurally complex and compositionally inhomogeneous systems. These include nanostructured, anisotropic, and interfacial materials where classical local models break down. Finally, the kernel function formalism is extensible to electronic, spin, or magnetic systems, providing a broadly applicable platform for next generation transport theory at ultrafast and nanoscale regimes.

Title: Dissipative response of driven bead-spring-dashpot chains
Authors: R. Kailasham
Abstract: The work dissipated in pulling a polymer chain with internal friction is numerically calculated by considering a sequence of $N$ bead-spring-dashpots tethered at one end and being pulled at the other using a harmonic trap via linear and symmetric protocols. The variation of the dissipation with the chain length, pulling trap stiffness, and the internal friction parameter are examined in detail for both the protocols. In the limit of high trap stiffness: (i) the dissipation $decreases$ with $N$ for chains with internal friction, keeping all other parameters constant, and (ii) the relationship between the dissipation and internal friction parameter deviates from linearity as $N$ is increased. Consequently, a closed-form expression between the dissipated work in driving a chain of spring-dashpots and the damping coefficient of a single dashpot can be written only for the case of $N = 1$ [as shown in Phys. Rev. Res. $\mathbf{2}$, 013331 (2020)] and not for the general case of $N > 1$.

Title: Surface Reduction Boosts Free Electron Concentration in MXene for Enhanced Photothermal Performance
Authors: Haoming Ding, Xiao Tong, Yong Zhang
Abstract: The photothermal properties of MXenes originate from their high free electron concentration, which drives localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). However, their intrinsic electron concentration is limited by suboptimal d-orbital occupancy, while electronegative surface terminations actively deplete free electrons through orbital-selective withdrawal. Herein, we report a sodium (Na)-mediated surface reduction strategy in molten salts to transform Ti3C2Clx into electronically tunable Ti3C2. Specifically, Na atoms remove -Cl terminations to eliminate electron withdrawal and simultaneously inject electrons into the MXene lattice via a reduction reaction. This dual effect saturates Ti 3d-orbital vacancies while reducing surface coordination sites, achieving an increase in carrier concentration to 4.92-fold, an increase in mobility to 2.63-fold, and an enhancement in conductivity to 12.96-fold. Consequently, the optimized reduced MXene achieves a record photothermal conversion efficiency of 92.36% under 808 nm laser irradiation. As a proof-of-concept, a photothermal antibacterial woundplast with ultralow MXene content demonstrates a 91.39% bacterial kill rate. This work not only shows an effective way to tune the photothermal properties of MXenes but also inspires applications that require high electron concentration, such as energy storage, sensors, and electromagnetic interference shielding.

Title: Revisiting the configurations of hydrogen impurities in SrTiO3: Insights from first-principles local vibration mode calculations
Authors: Cai Zenghua, Ma Chunlan
Abstract: The specific configurations of hydrogen impurities in SrTiO3 (STO) are still ambiguous. In this study, we systematically investigate the configurations and vibrational properties of hy-drogen impurities in cubic STO using first-principles local vibration mode calculations. Em-ploying the appropriate hybrid exchange correlation functional with the fraction of exact ex-change setting to 0.2, we revisit the interstitial hydrogen (Hi), Hi complexes (2Hi), and various intrinsic cation vacancy complexes with Hi, including VSr-Hi, VSr-2Hi, VTi-Hi, and VTi-2Hi. Comparison of the computed vibrational frequencies with experimental infrared absorption bands reveals that Hi, with a frequency of 3277 cm-1, is unlikely to account for the dominant absorption bands near 3500 cm-1. Instead, strontium vacancy complexes with interstitial hydro-gen (VSr-Hi and VSr-2Hi) exhibit vibrational frequencies that align with the main absorption bands, whereas titanium vacancy complex with two interstitial hydrogen (VTi-2Hi) corresponds to additional absorption bands around 3300 cm-1. These findings provide insights into the im-portance of hydrogen-related complexes in governing the electronic properties of STO, and meanwhile underscore the necessity of employing accurate exchange correlation functionals for reliable theoretical predictions of vibrational properties.

Title: Real-space titration and manipulation of particle-like correlated electrons in doped Mott insulator
Authors: Yanyan Geng, Haoyu Dong, Renhong Wang, Zilu Wang, Jianfeng Guo, Shuo Mi, Yan Li, Fei Pang, Rui Xu, Li Huang, Hong-Jun Gao, Wei Ji, Shancai Wang, Weichang Zhou, Zhihai Cheng
Abstract: The localized (particle-like) correlated electrons deserve particular attention as they govern various exotic quantum phenomena, such as quantum spin liquids, Wigner crystals, and Mott insulators in correlated systems. However, direct observation and manipulation of these particle-like electrons at the atomic or single-electron scale remain highly challenging. Here, we successfully realize and directly visualize particle-like correlated electrons in 1T-TaS2 through hole doping. The potential-dependent local electronic structure of single particle-like electron is revealed by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) combined with theoretical calculations. The complex correlated interactions including nearest-neighbor attractive interactions and many-body repulsive interactions are further demonstrated and discussed based on the spatial distribution of particle-like electrons. Furthermore, the tentative manipulation of the particle-like electrons is successfully achieved by the energy-excitation mechanism. Our results not only provide profound insights into particle-like electrons in correlated systems, but also establish a versatile platform for designing and controlling quantum states at the atomic scale.

Title: Proxitaxis: an adaptive search strategy based on proximity and stochastic resetting
Authors: Giuseppe Del Vecchio Del Vecchio, Manas Kulkarni, Satya N. Majumdar, Sanjib Sabhapandit
Abstract: We introduce \emph{proxitaxis}, a simple search strategy where the searcher has only information about the distance from the target but not the direction. The strategy consists of three crucial components: (i) local adaptive moves with distance-dependent hopping rate, (ii) intermittent long range returns via stochastic resetting to a certain location $\vec{R}_0$, and (iii) an inspection move where the searcher dynamically updates the resetting position $\vec{R}_0$. We compute analytically the capture probability of the target within this strategy and show that it can be maximized by an optimal choice of the control parameters of this strategy. Moreover, the optimal strategy undergoes multiple phase transitions as a function of the control parameters. These phase transitions are generic and occur in all dimensions.

Title: Quantum vortex dipole as a probe of the normal component distribution
Authors: Andrea Barresi, Piotr Magierski, Gabriel Wlazłowski
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of quantum vortex dipoles in a strongly interacting, spin-imbalanced Fermi superfluid at zero temperature. Using fully microscopic time-dependent density functional theory, we demonstrate that the dipole trajectory is strongly influenced by the spatial distribution of spin polarization. The resulting forces on the vortices include both longitudinal (dissipative) and transverse components, leading to deflection and shrinking of the dipole during propagation. For moderate polarization, vortex dipoles are deflected and lose energy, while for larger imbalances, they are rapidly annihilated. Our findings provide compelling evidence that spin-imbalanced Fermi gases contain a spatially nonuniform normal component even at zero temperature. We show that vortex dipoles serve as sensitive probes of this component, offering a route to indirectly detect exotic superfluid phases such as the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state and related inhomogeneous condensates.

Title: Strong acoustic phonon suppression leads to ultralow thermal conductivity and enhanced thermoelectric performance in BaCuGdTe$_3$
Authors: Jyoti Duhan, Chris Wolverton, Koushik Pal
Abstract: Excitations and scatterings among the quantized lattice vibrations, i.e., phonons, govern the lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_l$) in crystalline solids. Therefore, effective modulation of $\kappa_l$ can be achieved through selective manipulation of phonon modes that strongly participate in the heat transport mechanisms. Here, combining accurate first-principles density functional theory calculations and Boltzmann transport theory, we report a layered quaternary chalcogenide semiconductor, BaCuGdTe$_3$, which exhibits unusually low $\kappa_l$ ($\sim$ 0.14 W/mK at room temperature) despite its ordered crystalline structure. Our analysis reveals that the ultralow $\kappa_l$ arises mainly from a strong suppression of acoustic phonon modes induced by local distortion, shear vibrations among the layers, and large acoustic-optical avoided-crossing between phonons, which collectively enhances the phonon-scattering rates. Further calculations of the electrical transport properties with explicit consideration of electron-phonon interactions reveal a high thermoelectric figure of merit exceeding unity for this compound at moderate temperature (400-700 K) and carrier concentration $(1\text{--}5 \times 10^{19}\ \text{cm}^{-3})$ ranges. Our theoretical predictions warrant experimental investigations of the intriguing phonon dynamics, thermal transport mechanisms, and thermoelectric properties in this compound. Moreover, insights from our analysis can be used to design and engineer compounds with ultralow $\kappa_l$.

Title: Chiral superconductivity in a semiconducting wire induced by helical magnetic order
Authors: Florinda Viñas Boström, Emil Viñas Boström
Abstract: Chiral superconductors are sought after for their promising but elusive Majorana zero modes. We show that a one-dimensional semiconductor in proximity to a conventional superconductor and a helical magnet can exhibit chiral superconductivity, without the need for external magnetic fields or intrinsic spin-orbit coupling. The effective proximity-induced gap and the triplet gap arising from magnon fluctuations can be made to interfere constructively. The heterostructure can be tuned into a topological regime with Majorana zero modes at its ends, over a range of chemical potentials proportional to the spin-electron coupling.

Title: Detecting Lifshitz Transitions Using Nonlinear Conductivity in Bilayer Graphene
Authors: Tanweer Ahmed, Harsh Varshney, Bao Q. Tu, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Marco Gobbi, Fèlix Casanova, Amit Agarwal, Luis E. Hueso
Abstract: The second-order nonlinear electrical response (NLER) is an intrinsic property of inversion symmetry-broken systems which can provide deep insights into the electronic band structures of atomically thin quantum materials. However, the impact of Fermi surface reconstructions, also known as Lifshitz transitions, on the NLER has remained elusive. We investigated NLER in bilayer graphene (BLG), where the low-energy bands undergo Lifshitz transitions. Here, NLER undergoes a sign change near the Lifshitz transitions even at elevated temperatures $T\gtrsim10~$K. At the band edge, NLER in BLG is modulated by both extrinsic scattering and interfacial-strain-induced intrinsic Berry curvature dipole, both of which can be finely tuned externally by varying doping and interlayer potential. Away from the band edge, BLG exhibits second-order conductivity exceeding $30~\mu$mV$^{-1}\Omega^{-1}$ at 3K higher than any previous report. Our work establishes NLER as a reliable tool to probe Lifshitz transitions in quantum materials.

Title: Janus-faced influence of oxygen vacancy in high entropy oxide films with Mott electrons
Authors: Suresh Chandra Joshi, Nandana Bhattacharya, Manav Beniwal, Jyotirmay Maity, Prithwijit Mandal, Hua Zhou, Christoph Klewe, Srimanta Middey
Abstract: Contrary to traditional approaches, high entropy oxides (HEOs) strategically employ cationic disorder to engineer tunable functionalities. This disorder, stemming from multiple elements at the same crystallographic site, disrupts local symmetry and induces local distortions. By examining a series of single-crystalline [La$_{0.2}$Pr$_{0.2}$Nd$_{0.2}$Sm$_{0.2}$Eu$_{0.2}$]NiO$_{3-\delta}$ thin films, we demonstrate herein that the creation of oxygen vacancies (OVs) further offers a powerful means of tailoring electronic behavior of HEOs by concurrently introducing disorder in the oxygen sublattice and doping electrons into the system. Increasing OV concentration leads to a monotonic increase in room-temperature sheet resistance. A striking feature is the Janus-faced response of the metal-insulator transition (MIT) to OVs due to the interplay among correlation energy scales, electron doping, and disorder. Unlike the monotonous influence of OV observed for the MIT in VO$_2$ and V$_2$O$_3$, initial OV doping lowers the MIT temperature here, whereas higher OV levels completely suppress the metallic phase. Magnetotransport measurements further reveal weak localization, strong localization as a function of $\delta$. Moreover, the disorder on both $RE$ and oxygen sublattices is responsible for the Mott-Anderson insulator state. These findings surpass the scope of the recently featured `electron antidoping' effect and demonstrate the promising opportunity to utilize OV engineering of HEOs for Mottronics and optoelectronics applications.

Title: Excess dissipation shapes symmetry breaking in non-equilibrium currents
Authors: Matteo Sireci, Luca Peliti, Daniel Maria Busiello
Abstract: Most natural thermodynamic systems operate far from equilibrium, developing persistent currents and organizing into non-equilibrium stationary states (NESSs). Yet, the principles by which such systems self-organize, breaking equilibrium symmetries under external and internal constraints, remain unclear. Here, we establish a general connection between symmetry breaking and dissipation in mesoscopic stochastic systems described by Langevin dynamics. Using a geometric framework based on the inverse diffusion matrix, we decompose the velocity field into excess (gradient) and housekeeping (residual) components. This provides a natural entropy production split: the excess part captures internal reorganization under non-equilibrium conditions, while the housekeeping part quantifies detailed-balance violation due to external forces. We derive an exact equality linking the two, along with an inequality identifying accessible thermodynamics. A weak-noise expansion of the stationary solution reveals the general geometry of the NESS velocity field, enabling a unified classification of steady states. We apply this framework to systems ranging from molecular machines to coupled oscillators, showing how symmetry breaking in trajectory space constrains NESS organization. We further extend our approach to systems with multiplicative noise, deriving how additional symmetry breaking relates to curved (space-dependent) metrics. Finally, we show that both the NESS velocity field and stationary distribution can be derived through variational functionals based on excess dissipation. This work sheds light on the intimate connection between geometric features, dissipative properties, and symmetry breaking, uncovering a classification of NESSs that reflects how emergent organization reflects physical non-equilibrium conditions.

Title: Oscillation-Induced Frequency Generation in 1D Quantum Droplets under Harmonic-Gaussian Confinements
Authors: Jagnyaseni Jogania, Saurab Das, Ajay Nath, Jayanta Bera
Abstract: We explore the dynamical behavior of one-dimensional quantum droplets (QDs) governed by the extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation, under harmonic confinement supplemented by a static or time-dependent Gaussian spike (Gs) potential. Employing both variational analytical techniques and numerical simulations, we investigate the evolution of the root-mean-square (RMS) size, excitation spectrum, and phase-space dynamics of QDs. Our study reveals that while the harmonic trap sets the primary confinement, the Gs potential enables precise frequency tuning and control over droplet oscillations. A static Gs amplitude modifies the fundamental oscillation frequency depending on its sign, while a time-modulated Gs induces nonlinear dynamics, including higher harmonics and frequency mixing. Our analysis reveals that the resulting frequency spectrum is strongly influenced by inter- and intra-species interactions as well as by the parameters of the external trap. Notably, we establish a relationship between the frequency shift and the amplitude of the Gaussian spike. Wigner phase-space analysis further uncovers coherent rotational behavior, offering insights into hidden phase dynamics not apparent in real-space density profiles.

Title: Design and optimization of in situ self-functionalizing stress sensors
Authors: Olga Vasiljevic, Nicolas Harmand, Antoine Hubert, Lydia Kebbal, Volker Bormuth, Clara Hayn, Jonathan Fouchard, Marie Anne Breau, Lea-Laetitia Pontani
Abstract: Mechanical forces are crucial regulators of diverse biological processes, yet their in vivo measurement remains challenging due to limitations of current techniques, that can be destructive or require complex dedicated setups. This study introduces a novel class of biocompatible, self-functionalizing stress sensors based on inverted emulsions, that can be used to measure mechanical stresses inside tissues but can also locally perturb the biological environment through specific binder presentation or drug delivery. We engineered an optimal design for these inverted emulsions, focusing on finding the perfect balance between the two contradictory constraints: achieving low surface tension for deformability while maintaining emulsion instability for efficient self-functionalization and drug release. Proof-of-concept experiments in both agarose gels and complex biological systems, including brain organoids and zebrafish embryos, confirm the droplets ability to deform in response to mechanical stress applied on the tissue, to self-functionalize and to release encapsulated molecules locally. These versatile sensors offer a method for non-invasive stress measurements and targeted chemical delivery within living biological tissues, overcoming current technical barriers in biophysical measurements.

Title: Evaluating non-equilibrium trajectories via mean back relaxation: Dependence on length and time scales
Authors: Gabriel Knotz, Till M. Muenker, Timo Betz, Matthias Krüger
Abstract: The mean back relaxation (MBR) relates the value of a stochastic process at three different time points. It has been shown to detect broken detailed balance under certain conditions. For experiments of probe particles in living and passivated cells, MBR was found to be related to the so called effective energy, which quantifies the violation of the fluctuation dissipation theorem. In this manuscript, we discuss the dependence on the length and time parameters that enter MBR, both for cells as well as for a model system, finding qualitative agreement between the two. For the cell data, we extend the phenomenological relation between MBR and effective energy to a larger range of time parameters compared to previous work, allowing to test it in systems with limited resolution. We analyze the variance of back relaxation (VBR) in dependence of the mentioned parameters, relevant for the statistical error in MBR evaluation. For Gaussian systems, the variance is found analytically in terms of the mean squared displacement, and we determine its absolute minimum as a function of the length and time parameters. Comparing VBR from cell data to a Gaussian prediction demonstrates a non-Gaussian process.

Title: Light Induced Half-Metallic Phase in Insulators and Correlated Metals
Authors: Suryashekhar Kusari, Arnab Das, H. R. Krishnamurthy, Arti Garg
Abstract: Non-equilibrium control of electronic properties in condensed matter systems can result in novel phenomena. In this work, we provide a novel non-equilibrium route to realize half-metallic phases. We explore the periodically driven Hubbard model on a bipartite lattice and demonstrate that a periodic drive can transform a weakly interacting metal into a ferrimagnetic half-metal. We consider a Fermi-Hubbard model with only nearest-neighbour hopping and stabilize the elusive phase simply by driving the site potentials periodically. The drive induces staggered second and third-neighbor hopping and a staggered potential between two sublattices in the Floquet Hamiltonian, whose ground state is explored in this work. Close to the dynamical freezing point, due to the suppression of nearest neighbor hopping in the driven system, an effective enhancement of various terms in the Floquet Hamiltonian, including the e-e interactions, occurs. This helps in stabilizing a broad ferrimagnetic half-metallic phase for a wide range of system parameters. The half-metallic phase achieved in the presence of high drive frequency should be stable for exponentially large time scales in drive frequency and could be perpetually stable beyond a strong enough drive amplitude owing to dynamical freezing. It can hence have potential applications in stable spintronics and other upcoming quantum technologies.

Title: Influence of interphase boundary coherency in high-entropy alloys on their hydrogen storage performance
Authors: Shivam Dangwal, Kaveh Edalati
Abstract: High-entropy alloys (HEAs) have potential for storing hydrogen reversibly at room temperature due to their tunable thermodynamics; however, they usually suffer from the issue of difficult activation. This study shows that while interphase boundaries are effective in activating some HEAs, some other dual-phase HEAs still require extra high-temperature activation. To understand why interphase boundaries are not always effective for activation, microstructural features and hydrogen storage performance of six HEAs with dual phases are compared. Detailed analysis confirms that interphase boundaries are effective for hydrogen absorption without the need for activation treatment, provided that: (i) their fraction is high enough, and (ii) they are not coherent. These findings are discussed in terms of free volume and boundary energy. Coherent interphase boundaries are associated with lower free volume and thus do not act as fast hydrogen diffusion paths. Moreover, the boundary energy of coherent boundaries is lower than incoherent boundaries, making them less favorable sites for heterogeneous hydride nucleation. This research thus suggests that the introduction of incoherent interphase boundaries with a proper fraction is a solution for activating hydrogen storage materials.

Title: Coherent superposition of emitted and resonantly scattered photons from a two-level system driven by an even-$π$ pulse
Authors: I.V. Krainov, A.I. Galimov, M.V. Rakhlin, A.A. Toropov, T.V. Shubina
Abstract: We report the observation of a bunching of ~3 photon states, which is a coherent superposition of emitted photons and resonantly scattered laser photons, arising upon excitation by even-$\pi$ pulses of a two-level system represented by a charged quantum dot in a microcavity. This phenomenon emerges because the exciting laser pulse contains several tens of photons whose quantum amplitude distribution creates such a superposition, and the polarization of the scattered photons is changed by the interaction with the charged resonant system. Such a beam is a high-order member of the Fock space, promising for quantum technologies.

Title: A simpler probe of the quantum Mpemba effect in closed systems
Authors: Filiberto Ares, Colin Rylands, Pasquale Calabrese
Abstract: We study the local relaxation of closed quantum systems through the relative entropy between the reduced density matrix and its long time limit. We show, using analytic arguments combined with numerical checks, that this relative entropy can be very well approximated by an entropy difference, affording a significant computational advantage. We go on to relate this to the entanglement asymmetry of the subsystem with respect to time translation invariance. In doing this, we obtain a simple probe of the relaxation dynamics of closed many-body systems and use it to re-examine the quantum Mpemba effect, wherein states can relax faster if they are initially further from equilibrium. We reproduce earlier instances of the effect related to symmetry restoration as well as uncover new cases in the absence of such symmetries. For integrable models, we obtain the criteria for this to occur using the quasiparticle picture. Lastly, we show that, in models obeying the entanglement membrane picture, the quantum Mpemba effect cannot occur for a large class of initial states.

Title: A Hydrodynamic Theory for Non-Equilibrium Full Counting Statistics in One-Dimensional Quantum Systems
Authors: David X. Horvath, Benjamin Doyon, Paola Ruggiero
Abstract: We study the dynamics of charge fluctuations after homogeneous quantum quenches in one-dimensional systems with ballistic transport. For short but macroscopic times where the non-trivial dynamics is largely dominated by long-range correlations, a simple expression for the associated full counting statistics can be obtained by hydrodynamic arguments. This formula links the non-equilibrium charge fluctuation after the quench to the fluctuations of the associated current after a charge-biased inhomogeneous modification of the original quench which corresponds to the paradigmatic partitioning protocol. Under certain assumptions, the fluctuations in the latter case can be expressed by explicit closed form formulas in terms of thermodynamic and hydrodynamic quantities via the Ballistic Fluctuations Theory. In this work, we identify precise physical conditions for the applicability of a fully hydrodynamic theory, and provide a detailed analysis explicitly demonstrating how such conditions are met and how this leads to such hydrodynamic treatment. We discuss these conditions at length in non-relativistic free fermions, where calculations become feasible and allow for cross-checks against exact results. In physically relevant cases, strong long-range correlations can complicate the hydrodynamic picture, but our formula still correctly reproduces the first cumulants.

Title: Statistical properties of stochastic functionals under general resetting
Authors: V. Méndez, R. Flaquer-Galmés
Abstract: We derive the characteristic function of stochastic functionals of a random walk whose position is reset to the origin at random times drawn from a general probability distribution. We analyze the long-time behavior and obtain the temporal scaling of the first two moments of any stochastic functional of the random walk when the resetting time distribution exhibits a power-law tail. When the resetting times PDF has finite moments, the probability density of any functional converges to a delta function centered at its mean, indicating an ergodic phase. We explicitly examine the case of the half-occupation time and derive the ergodicity breaking parameter, the first two moments, and the limiting distribution when the resetting time distribution follows a power-law tail, for both Brownian and subdiffusive random walks. We characterize the three different shapes of the limiting distribution as a function of the exponent of the resetting distribution. Our theoretical findings are supported by Monte Carlo simulations, which show excellent agreement with the analytical results.

Title: Chladni states in Ising Spin Lattices
Authors: Giulio Iannelli, Pablo Villegas
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking is the core concept for understanding the emergence of collective order. In finite-dimensional systems, however, the nature of the broken phase is often constrained by the compatibility between spontaneous order and the microscopic symmetries of the underlying lattice. Here, we propose the topological substratum on which Ising spin lattices exhibit long-range order when cooled under non-ergodic conditions. Our topological decomposition, tantamount to resonating sand plates, enables monitoring and control of the dynamical evolution in systems surfing complex energy landscapes with multiple metastable patterns.

Title: Second-Order Conductivity Probes a Cascade of Singularities in a Moiré Superlattice
Authors: Tanweer Ahmed, Bao Q. Tu, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Marco Gobbi, Fèlix Casanova, Luis E. Hueso
Abstract: Systems lacking inversion symmetry inherently demonstrate a nonlinear electrical response (NLER) to an applied electric bias, emerging through extrinsic mechanisms. This response is highly sensitive to the electronic band structure, which can be engineered with remarkable precision in moiré superlattices formed from atomically thin quantum materials. Moiré superlattices host complex Fermi surface reconstructions near van Hove singularities (vHSs) in the electronic density of states. However, the role of these reconstructions in shaping NLER remains insufficiently understood. In this work, we systematically explore NLER in moiré superlattices of twisted double bilayer graphene (tDBLG) by tuning the Fermi level across multiple moiré bands on both sides of the charge neutrality point. We observe sharp variations and sign reversals in the NLER appearing via extrinsic pathways near mid-band vHSs. The second-order conductivity close to the vHSs demonstrates a much higher value than previous reports of extrinsic NLER in any other material. Our results demonstrate that NLER can serve as a sensitive probe of Fermi surface reconstructions and establish tDBLG as a versatile and highly efficient platform for generating and controlling the nonlinear electrical response.

Title: Generating single- and many-body quantum magnonic states
Authors: Violet Williams, Jayakrishnan M. P. Nair, Yaroslav Tserkovnyak, Benedetta Flebus
Abstract: The growing interest in quantum magnonics is driving the development of advanced techniques for generating, controlling, and detecting non-classical magnonic states. Here, we explore the potential of an ensemble of solid-state spin defects coupled to a shared magnetic bath as a source of such states. We establish a theoretical framework to characterize the quantum correlations among magnons emitted by the ensemble into the bath and investigate how these correlations depend on experimentally tunable parameters. Our findings show that the emitted magnons retain the quantum correlations inherent to the solid-state emitters, paving the way for the deterministic generation of quantum many-body magnonic states.

Title: Static treatment of dynamic interactions in correlated electron systems
Authors: Anton Pauli, Akshat Mishra, Malte Rösner, Erik G.C.P. van Loon
Abstract: Correlated electron physics is intrinsically a multiscale problem, since high-energy electronic states screen the interactions between the correlated electrons close to the Fermi level, thereby reducing the magnitude of the interaction strength and dramatically shortening its range. Thus, the handling of screening is an essential ingredient in the first-principles modelling of correlated electron systems. Screening is an intrinsically dynamic process and the corresponding downfolding methods such as the constrained Random Phase Approximation indeed produce a dynamic interaction. However, many low-energy methods require an instantaneous interaction as input, which makes it necessary to map the fully dynamic interaction to an effective instantaneous interaction strength. It is a priori not clear if and when such an effective model can capture the physics of the one with dynamic interaction and how to best perform the mapping. Here, we provide a systematic benchmark relevant to correlated materials, in the form of the Anderson impurity model. Overall, we find that a moment-based approach recently proposed by Scott and Booth performs well. We also identify physical regimes, especially under doping, where an instantaneous interaction cannot capture all of the relevant physics.

Title: Fractional Brownian Motion with Negative Hurst Exponent
Authors: Baruch Meerson, Pavel V. Sasorov
Abstract: Fractional Brownian motion (fBm) is an important scale-invariant Gaussian non-Markovian process with stationary increments, which serves as a prototypical example of a system with long-range temporal correlations and anomalous diffusion. The fBm is traditionally defined for the Hurst exponent $H$ in the range $-1/2<H<0$. Here we extend this definition to the strongly anti-persistent regime $-1/2<H<0$. The extended fBm is not a pointwise process, so we regularize it via a local temporal averaging with a narrow filter. The extended fBm turns out to be stationary, and we derive its autocorrelation function. The stationarity implies a complete arrest of diffusion in this region of $H$. We also determine the variance of a closely related Gaussian process: the stationary fractional Ornstein--Uhlenbeck (fOU) process, extended to the range $-1/2<H<0$ and smoothed in the same way as the fBm. Remarkably, the smoothed fOU process turns out to be insensitive to the strength of the confining potential. Finally, we determine the optimal paths of the conditioned fBm and fOU processes for $-1/2<H<0$. In the marginal case $H=0$, our results match continuously with known results for the traditionally defined fBm and fOU processes.

Abstract: Critical phenomena on scale-free networks with a degree distribution $p_k \sim k^{-\lambda}$ exhibit rich finite-size effects due to its structural heterogeneity. We systematically study the finite-size scaling of percolation and identify two distinct crossover routes to mean-field behavior: one controlled by the degree exponent $\lambda$, the other by the degree cutoff $K \sim V^{\kappa}$, where $V$ is the system size and $\kappa \in [0,1]$ is the cutoff exponent. Increasing $\lambda$ or decreasing $\kappa$ suppresses heterogeneity and drives the system toward mean-field behavior, with logarithmic corrections near the marginal case. These findings provide a unified picture of the crossover from heterogeneous to homogeneous criticality. In the crossover regime, we observe rich finite-size phenomena, including the transition from vanishing to divergent susceptibility, distinct exponents for the shift and fluctuation of pseudocritical points, and a numerical clarification of previous theoretical debates.

Title: Cluster-diagrammatic D-TRILEX approach to non-local electronic correlations
Authors: Félix Fossati, Evgeny A. Stepanov
Abstract: In this work, we extend the theoretical approach known as "D-TRILEX", developed for solving correlated electronic systems, to a cluster reference system for the diagrammatic expansion. This framework allows us to consistently combine the exact treatment of short-range correlation effects within the cluster, with an efficient diagrammatic description of the long-range charge and spin collective fluctuations beyond the cluster. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to the one-dimensional nano-ring Hubbard model, where the low dimensionality enhances non-local correlations. Our results show that the cluster extension of D-TRILEX accurately reproduces the electronic self-energy at momenta corresponding to the Fermi energy, in good agreement with the numerically exact quantum Monte Carlo solution of the problem, and outperforms significantly more computationally demanding approach based on the parquet approximation. We show that the D-TRILEX diagrammatic extension drastically reduces the periodization ambiguity of cluster quantities when mapping back to the original lattice, compared to cluster dynamical mean-field theory (CDMFT). Furthermore, we identify the CDMFT impurity problem as the main source of the translational-symmetry breaking and propose the computational scheme for improving the starting point for the cluster-diagrammatic expansion.

Title: Liquid-Gas Criticality of Hyperuniform Fluids
Authors: Shang Gao, Hao Shang, Hao Hu, Yu-Qiang Ma, Qun-Li Lei
Abstract: In statistical physics, a well-accepted knowledge is that liquid-gas (LG) phase transition with diverging critical fluctuations lies in the universality class of Ising model. Yet, whether non-equilibrium effect alone can alter this conclusion remains an open question. Here, we study the LG criticality of a hyperuniform (HU) fluid composed of active spinners, where phase separation is induced by dissipative collisions. Strikingly, at the LG critical point, the HU fluid exhibits normal Gaussian density fluctuations instead of the diverging fluctuations. Through hydrodynamic field theory and renormalization-group analysis, we demonstrate that hyperuniformity reduces the upper critical dimension from d_c = 4 (classical fluids) to d_c = 2 due to an emerging long-range correlation induced by center-of-mass conservation. Large-scale stochastic field simulations confirm this dimensional reduction, and reveal diverging response function along with anomalous zero-range correlation function at the critical point, indicating the absence of an effective fluctuation-dissipation relationship in the system. The simulation also identifies anomalous finite-size scaling in density fluctuation, energy fluctuation, and Binder cumulant. Furthermore, HU fluid also exihibits non-classical spinodal decomposition dynamics with diverging decomposition time but non-diverging decomposition length scale. Our results provide an exception to the classical paradigms of LG critical phenomena and highlight how non-equilibrium effect can reshape universality classes of classical phase transitions.

Title: Spin properties in droplet epitaxy-grown telecom quantum dots
Authors: Marius Cizauskas, Elisa M. Sala, Jon Heffernan, A. Mark Fox, Manfred Bayer, Alex Greilich
Abstract: We investigate the spin properties of InAs/InGaAs/InP quantum dots grown by metalorganic vapor-phase epitaxy (MOVPE) deposition using droplet epitaxy, which emit in the telecom C-band. Using pump-probe Faraday ellipticity measurements, we determine electron and hole $g$-factors of $|g_e| = 0.934$ and $|g_h| = 0.471$, with the electron $g$-factor being nearly twice as low as typical molecular beam epitaxy Stranski-Krastanov (SK) grown samples. Most significantly, we measure a longitudinal spin relaxation time $T_1 = 2.95\,\mu s$, representing an order of magnitude improvement over comparable MBE SK grown samples. Despite significant electron $g$-factor anisotropy, we observed that it is reduced relative to similar material composition samples grown with MBE or MOVPE SK methods. We attribute these g-factor anisotropy and spin lifetime improvements to the enhanced structural symmetry achieved via MOVPE droplet epitaxy, which mitigates the inherent structural asymmetry in strain-driven growth approaches for InAs/InP quantum dots. These results demonstrate that MOVPE droplet epitaxy-grown InAs/InGaAs/InP quantum dots exhibit favorable spin properties for potential implementation in quantum information applications.

Title: New universality classes govern the critical and multicritical behavior of an active Ising model
Authors: Matthew Wong, Chiu Fan Lee
Abstract: The Ising model is one of the most well known models in statistical physics, with its critical behavior governed by the Wilson-Fisher universality class (UC). When active motility is incorporated into the Ising model by, e.g., dictating that the spins' directional movements follow their orientations, the spin number density necessarily constitutes a soft mode in the hydrodynamic description, and can therefore modify the scaling behavior of the system. Here, we show that this is indeed the case in a critical active Ising model in which density can impede the system's collective motion. Specifically, we use a perturbative dynamic renormalization group method to the one-loop level to uncover three new UCs, one of which supersedes the Wilson-Fisher UC to become the generic UC that governs the critical behavior of the active Ising model.

Title: Irreversibility in scalar active turbulence: The role of topological defects
Authors: Byjesh N. Radhakrishnan, Francesco Serafin, Thomas L. Schmidt, Etienne Fodor
Abstract: In many active systems, swimmers collectively stir the surrounding fluid to stabilize some self-sustained vortices. The resulting nonequilibrium state is often referred to as active turbulence, by analogy with the turbulence of passive fluids under external stirring. Although active turbulence clearly operates far from equilibrium, it can be challenging to pinpoint which emergent features primarily control the deviation from an equilibrium reversible dynamics. Here, we reveal that dynamical irreversibility essentially stems from singularities in the active stress. Specifically, considering the coupled dynamics of the swimmer density and the stream function, we demonstrate that the symmetries of vortical flows around defects determine the overall irreversibility. Our detailed analysis leads to identifying specific configurations of defect pairs as the dominant contribution to irreversibility.

Title: Dynamical and structural properties of an absorbing phase transition: a case study from granular systems
Authors: Raphael Maire, Andrea Plati, Frank Smallenburg, Giuseppe Foffi
Abstract: We investigate the dynamical and structural properties of absorbing phase transitions (APTs) within granular systems. Specifically, we examine a model for vibrofluidized systems of spherical grains, which transition from a state of pure vertical motion to a horizontal diffusive state upon increased density. Depending on the details of the system, we observe both continuous and discontinuous transitions in numerical simulations. We explain this using a theoretical analysis based on kinetic theory applied to a coarse-grained model, which elucidates the role of a synchronization effect in determining the nature of the transition. A fluctuating hydrodynamic theory, which quantitatively describes the structural and dynamical properties of the active state such as hyperuniformity is derived from the microscopic dynamics, together with an equilibrium-like assumption concerning the noises on the hydrodynamic fields. This work expands on previous studies by providing a comprehensive examination of the APT characteristics and proposing new theoretical models to interpret the observed behaviors.

Abstract: Cesium lead halide nanocrystals and quantum dots are prominent materials for different types of applications because of their remarkable photophysical properties. However, they are also known to exhibit the same effects observed for non-perovskite colloidal semiconductor quantum dots such as blinking, photobleaching, delayed luminescence, etc. In this study we reveal the correlations between fast and delayed emission components for both the intensity and characteristic decay time for single CsPbBr$_3$ nanocrystals. In order to explain the phenomena observed, we propose a novel model of single CsPbBr$_3$ nanocrystals luminescence blinking based on the hypothesis of slow variations in the electron-phonon coupling.

Title: Reference compositions for bismuth telluride thermoelectric materials for low-temperature power generation
Authors: Nirma Kumari, Jaywan Chung, Seunghyun Oh, Jeongin Jang, Jongho Park, Ji Hui Son, SuDong Park, Byungki Ryu
Abstract: Thermoelectric (TE) technology enables direct heat-to-electricity conversion and is gaining attention as a clean, fuel-saving, and carbon-neutral solution for industrial, automotive, and marine applications. Despite nearly a century of research, apart from successes in deep-space power sources and solid-state cooling modules, the industrialization and commercialization of TE power generation remain limited. Since the new millennium, nanostructured bulk materials have accelerated the discovery of new TE systems. However, due to limited access to high-temperature heat sources, energy harvesting still relies almost exclusively on BiTe-based alloys, which are the only system operating stably near room temperature. Although many BiTe-based compositions have been proposed, concerns over reproducibility, reliability, and lifetime continue to hinder industrial adoption. Here, we aim to develop reference BiTe-based thermoelectric materials through data-driven analysis of Starrydata2, the world's largest thermoelectric database. We identify Bi0.46Sb1.54Te3 and Bi2Te2.7Se0.3 as the most frequently studied ternary compositions. These were synthesized using hot pressing and spark-plasma sintering. Thermoelectric properties were evaluated with respect to the processing method and measurement direction. The results align closely with the median of reported data, confirming the representativeness of the selected compositions. We propose these as reference BiTe materials, accompanied by transparent data and validated benchmarks. Their use can support the standardization of TE legs and modules while accelerating performance evaluation and industrial integration. We further estimated the performance of a thermoelectric module made from the reference composition, which gives the power output of over 2.51 W and an efficiency of 3.58% at a temperature difference of 120 K.

Title: A Comprehensive MARTINI Coarse-Grained Framework for Phyllosilicate Clay/Polymer Nanocomposites: From Atomistic Validation to Mesoscale Insights
Authors: Ankit Patidar, Gaurav Goel
Abstract: Phyllosilicate clays have diverse applications in packaging industries and are found highly suitable for formulation, including thermoplastic starch (TPS), polyethylene (PE), or their combination. We developed CG MARTINI-3 parameters of the pyrophyllite using Lifshitz theory and experimental surface tension data. These initial bead assignments of pyrophyllite and periodic tetramethylammonium-montmorillonite (TMA-MMT) sheet were fine-tuned using optimal reproduction of structural, thermodynamic, and dynamic properties obtained via all-atom (AA) simulation of TPS with a periodic pyrophyllite sheet. These developed models predicted the correct AA radial distribution function and two-body excess entropy for polymer-sorbitol pairs, showcasing the robustness of the developed CG model in predicting the properties not used in parameterization. These composite simulations revealed acceleration (for pyrophyllite) or retardation (for TMA-MMT) of khun segment dynamics (compared to melt) with the depletion of polymer near the surface. The developed CG parameters were used to investigate the long-time behavior of TPS-polyethylene (PE) melt and their Cloisite-15A-based composite systems. The coordination number indicated compatibilization of the TPS-PE phase, achieved by binding TPS through its bare polar surface and PE via alkyl-mediated interactions, which consequently reduced the TPS-PE interfacial surface tension from 45 mN/m to 13.06 mN/m. Additionally, high TPS-clay coordination, sustained localization of clay at the TPS-PE interface, and clay aggregation observed in CG simulation closely agree with experimental observations. Further, the CG model effectively captured the clay-mediated variation in the overall morphology of the TPS-PE system and their direct impact on chain conformational properties, making this CG model highly suitable for a material design perspective.

Title: "Ideal" Topological Heavy Fermion Model in Two-dimensional Moiré Heterostructures with Type-II Band Alignment
Authors: Yunzhe Liu, Anoj Aryal, Dumitru Calugaru, Zhenyao Fang, Kaijie Yang, Haoyu Hu, Qimin Yan, B. Andrei Bernevig, Chao-xing Liu
Abstract: Topological flat bands play an essential role in inducing exotic interacting physics, ranging from fractional Chern insulators to superconductivity, in moiré materials. When topological flat bands possess concentrated quantum geometry, a topological heavy fermion (THF) model was proposed as the starting point to describe the interacting moiré physics. In this work, we propose a design principle for realizing "ideal" THF model, which can host an exact flat band with "ideal quantum geometry", namely the trace of Fubini-Study metric equals to the Berry curvature, in a class of two-dimensional moiré heterostructures with type-II band alignment. We first introduce a moiré Chern-band model to describe this system and show that topological flat bands can be realized in this model when the moiré superlattice potential is stronger than the type-II atomic band gap of the heterostructure. Next, we map this model into a THF model that consists of a localized orbital for "f-electron" and a conducting band for "c-electron". We find that both the flatness and quantum geometry of the mini-bands in this THF model depend on the energy gap between c-electron and f-electron bands at $\Gamma$ which is experimentally controllable via external gate voltages. This tunability will allow us to realize an "ideal" topological flat band with zero band-width and "ideal quantum geometry" in this THF model. Our design strategy of topological flat bands is insensitive of twist angle. We also discuss possible material candidates for moiré heterostructures with type-II band alignment.

Title: Bridging Machine Learning and Glassy Dynamics Theory for Predictive Polymer Modeling
Authors: Anh D. Phan, Ngo T. Que, Nguyen T. T. Duyen, Phan Thanh Viet, Quach K. Quang, Baicheng Mei
Abstract: Understanding and predicting the glassy dynamics of polymers remain fundamental challenges in soft matter physics. While the Elastically Collective Nonlinear Langevin Equation (ECNLE) theory has been successful in describing relaxation dynamics, its practical application to polymers depends on a thermal mapping to connect theory with experiment, which in turn requires detailed thermodynamic data. Such data may not be available for chemically complex or newly designed polymers. In this work, we propose a simple approach that integrates machine learning-predicted glass transition temperatures (Tg) with a simplified thermal mapping based on an effective thermal expansion coefficient to overcome these limitations. This approach can provide quantitatively accurate predictions of relaxation dynamics across a broad range of polymers. Rather than replacing the original thermal mapping, our method complements it by trading formal rigor for computational efficiency and broader applicability in high-throughput screening and materials with limited available data. Moreover, we introduce a physically motivated modification to the thermal mapping that resolves discrepancies in the description of low-Tg polymers. Our results establish a generalizable approach for predictive modeling of glassy polymer dynamics and point toward new directions for theory-guided materials discovery.

Title: Ontological differentiation as a measure of semantic accuracy
Authors: Pablo Garcia-Cuadrillero, Fabio Revuelta, Jose Angel Capitan
Abstract: Understanding semantic relationships within complex networks derived from lexical resources is fundamental for network science and language modeling. While network embedding methods capture contextual similarity, quantifying semantic distance based directly on explicit definitional structure remains challenging. Accurate measures of semantic similarity allow for navigation on lexical networks based on maximizing semantic similarity in each navigation jump (Semantic Navigation, SN). This work introduces Ontological Differentiation (OD), a formal method for measuring divergence between concepts by analyzing overlap during recursive definition expansion. The methodology is applied to networks extracted from the Simple English Wiktionary, comparing OD scores with other measures of semantic similarity proposed in the literature (cosine similarity based on random-walk network exploration). We find weak correlations between direct pairwise OD scores and cosine similarities across $\sim$~2 million word pairs, sampled from a pool representing over 50\% of the entries in the Wiktionary lexicon. This establishes OD as a largely independent, definition-based semantic metric, whose orthogonality to cosine similarity becomes more pronounced when low-semantic-content terms were removed from the dataset. Additionally, we use cumulative OD scores to evaluate paths generated by vector-based SN and structurally optimal Shortest Paths (SP) across networks. We find SN paths consistently exhibit significantly lower cumulative OD scores than shortest paths, suggesting that SN produces trajectories more coherent with the dictionary's definitional structure, as measured by OD. Ontological Differentiation thus provides a novel, definition-grounded tool for analyzing semantic structure and validating navigation processes in lexical networks.

Title: Harmonic emission as a probe to coherent transitions in the topological superconductors
Authors: Nivash R., S. Srinidhi, Jayendra N. Bandyopadhyay, Amol R. Holkundkar
Abstract: We investigate the dynamical behavior of a topological superconducting system, demonstrating that its static configuration undergoes a transition driven by an intrinsic supercurrent. By analyzing the band population, we confirm the quasiparticle nature of the system both in the presence and absence of an external laser field. Under laser driving, we observe an enhancement in static emission forming a plateau-like structure, accompanied by multiple coherent transitions in the population. These transitions exhibit Rabi-like oscillations, attributed to the presence of Majorana bound states (MBS), further reinforcing the quasiparticle character of the model. Our results highlight the efficacy of laser driving as a probe of the system's topological and dynamical stability.

Title: Topological Holography for Mixed-State Phases and Phase Transitions
Authors: Ran Luo, Yi-Nan Wang, Zhen Bi
Abstract: We extend the symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT) framework to open quantum systems. Using canonical purification, we embed mixed states into a doubled (2+1)-dimensional topological order and employ the slab construction to study (1+1)-dimensional mixed-state phases through condensable algebras in the doubled SymTFT. Hermiticity and positivity of the density matrix impose additional constraints on allowable anyon condensations, enabling a systematic classification of mixed-state phases - including strong-to-weak symmetry breaking (SWSSB) and average symmetry-protected topological (ASPT) phases. We present examples of mixed-state phase transitions involving SWSSB and show how gauging within the open SymTFT framework reveals connections among different mixed-state phases.

Title: Physics-Informed Graph Neural Networks to Reconstruct Local Fields Considering Finite Strain Hyperelasticity
Authors: Manuel Ricardo Guevara Garban, Yves Chemisky, Étienne Prulière, Michaël Clément
Abstract: We propose a physics-informed machine learning framework called P-DivGNN to reconstruct local stress fields at the micro-scale, in the context of multi-scale simulation given a periodic micro-structure mesh and mean, macro-scale, stress values. This method is based in representing a periodic micro-structure as a graph, combined with a message passing graph neural network. We are able to retrieve local stress field distributions, providing average stress values produced by a mean field reduced order model (ROM) or Finite Element (FE) simulation at the macro-scale. The prediction of local stress fields are of utmost importance considering fracture analysis or the definition of local fatigue criteria. Our model incorporates physical constraints during training to constraint local stress field equilibrium state and employs a periodic graph representation to enforce periodic boundary conditions. The benefits of the proposed physics-informed GNN are evaluated considering linear and non linear hyperelastic responses applied to varying geometries. In the non-linear hyperelastic case, the proposed method achieves significant computational speed-ups compared to FE simulation, making it particularly attractive for large-scale applications.

Title: The Neural Networks with Tensor Weights and the Corresponding Fermionic Quantum Field Theory
Authors: Guojun Huang, Kai Zhou
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a theoretical connection between complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) and fermionic quantum field theory (QFT), bridging a fundamental gap in the emerging framework of neural network quantum field theory (NN-QFT). While prior NN-QFT works have linked real-valued architectures to bosonic fields, we demonstrate that CVNNs equipped with tensor-valued weights intrinsically generate fermionic quantum fields. By promoting hidden-to-output weights to Clifford algebra-valued tensors, we induce anticommutation relations essential for fermionic statistics. Through analytical study of the generating functional, we obtain the exact quantum state in the infinite-width limit, revealing that the parameters between the input layer and the last hidden layer correspond to the eigenvalues of the quantum system, and the tensor weighting parameters in the hidden-to-output layer map to dynamical fermionic fields. The continuum limit reproduces free fermion correlators, with diagrammatic expansions confirming anticommutation. The work provides the first explicit mapping from neural architectures to fermionic QFT at the level of correlation functions and generating functional. It extends NN-QFT beyond bosonic theories and opens avenues for encoding fermionic symmetries into machine learning models, with potential applications in quantum simulation and lattice field theory.

Title: Redundancy Channels in the Conformal Bootstrap
Authors: Stefanos R. Kousvos, Andreas Stergiou
Abstract: A method for obstructing symmetry enhancement in numerical conformal bootstrap calculations is proposed. Symmetry enhancement refers to situations where bootstrap studies initialised with a certain symmetry end up allowing theories with higher symmetry. In such cases, it is shown that redundant operators in the less symmetric theory can descend from primary scaling operators of the more symmetric one, motivating the imposition of spectral gaps that are justified in the former but not the latter. The same mechanism can also be used to differentiate between decoupled and fully coupled theories which otherwise have the same global symmetry. A systematic understanding of this mechanism is developed and applied to distinguish the cubic from the $O(3)$ model in three dimensions, where a strip of disallowed parameter space, referred to as the cubic redundancy channel, emerges once a gap associated with a redundant operator of the cubic theory is imposed. The channel corresponds precisely to the region of parameter space where the assumed cubic symmetry would be enhanced to $O(3)$.

Title: SymTFT Approach for Mixed States with Non-Invertible Symmetries
Authors: Sakura Schafer-Nameki, Apoorv Tiwari, Alison Warman, Carolyn Zhang
Abstract: We develop a general framework for studying phases of mixed states with strong and weak symmetries, including non-invertible or categorical symmetries. The central idea is to consider a purification of the mixed state density matrix, which lives in a doubled Hilbert space. We propose a systematic classification of phases in this doubled Hilbert space, relying crucially on the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) approach. This framework applies not only to group symmetries but also, importantly, to non-invertible symmetries. We illustrate the approach in 1+1d to classify phases with strong (non-)invertible symmetries, which include strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB) phases and mixed strong/weak symmetry-protected topological phases (SPTs). We also develop an approach for studying symmetries that involve a combination of strong and weak symmetries. A noteworthy example of this has weak non-invertible Kramers-Wannier duality symmetry and strong $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. The continuum description is complemented by a lattice model analysis informed by the SymTFT framework.

Title: Looking elsewhere: improving variational Monte Carlo gradients by importance sampling
Authors: Antoine Misery, Luca Gravina, Alessandro Santini, Filippo Vicentini
Abstract: Neural-network quantum states (NQS) offer a powerful and expressive ansatz for representing quantum many-body wave functions. However, their training via Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) methods remains challenging. It is well known that some scenarios - such as sharply peaked wave functions emerging in quantum chemistry - lead to high-variance gradient estimators hindering the effectiveness of variational optimizations. In this work we investigate a systematic strategy to tackle those sampling issues by means of adaptively tuned importance sampling. Our approach is explicitly designed to (i) target the gradient estimator instead of the loss function, (ii) not introduce additional hyperparameters and (iii) be computationally inexpensive. We benchmarked our approach across the ground-state search of a wide variety of hamiltonians, including frustrated spin systems and ab-initio quantum chemistry. We also show systematic improvements on the infidelity minimization in the context of neural projected quantum dynamics. Overall, our approach can reduce the computational cost of vanilla VMC considerably, up to a factor of 100x when targeting highly peaked quantum chemistry wavefunctions.

Title: Probing Defects with Quantum Simulator Snapshots
Authors: Abhijat Sarma, Nayan Myerson-Jain, Roger G. Melko, Cenke Xu
Abstract: Snapshots, i.e. projective measurements of local degrees of freedom, are the most standard data taken in experiments on quantum simulators. Snapshots are usually used to probe local physics. In this work we propose a simple protocol to experimentally probe physics of defects with these snapshots. Our protocol relies only on snapshots from the bulk system, without introducing the defect explicitly; as such, the physics of different kinds of defects can be probed using the same dataset. In particular, we demonstrate that with snapshots of local spin configurations of, for example, the $1d$ Rydberg atom realization of the quantum Ising criticality, we can (1) extract the ``defect entropy", and (2) access the continuous line of fixed points of effective defect conformal field theory, which was recently discussed in the context of the ``weak-measurement altered criticality".

Title: Adaptive Variation-Resilient Random Number Generator for Embedded Encryption
Authors: Furqan Zahoor, Ibrahim A. Albulushi, Saleh Bunaiyan, Anupam Chattopadhyay, Hesham ElSawy, Feras Al-Dirini
Abstract: With a growing interest in securing user data within the internet-of-things (IoT), embedded encryption has become of paramount importance, requiring light-weight high-quality Random Number Generators (RNGs). Emerging stochastic device technologies produce random numbers from stochastic physical processes at high quality, however, their generated random number streams are adversely affected by process and supply voltage variations, which can lead to bias in the generated streams. In this work, we present an adaptive variation-resilient RNG capable of extracting unbiased encryption-grade random number streams from physically driven entropy sources, for embedded cryptography applications. As a proof of concept, we employ a stochastic magnetic tunnel junction (sMTJ) device as an entropy source. The impact of variations in the sMTJ is mitigated by employing an adaptive digitizer with an adaptive voltage reference that dynamically tracks any stochastic signal drift or deviation, leading to unbiased random bit stream generation. The generated unbiased bit streams, due to their higher entropy, then only need to undergo simplified post-processing. Statistical randomness tests based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) test suite are conducted on bit streams obtained using simulations and FPGA entropy source emulation experiments, validating encryption-grade randomness at a significantly reduced hardware cost, and across a wide range of process-induced device variations and supply voltage fluctuations.

Title: Universal Long-Time Behavior of the Quantum Fisher Information in Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions
Authors: J. Mumford, R. J. Lewis-Swan
Abstract: We investigate dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) in quantum systems that possess well-defined classical limits, focusing on the spinor Bose-Einstein condensate and the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model. We diagnose the DQPTs with the long-time average of the quantum Fisher information (QFI) showing that it abruptly changes at the transition point. Using mean-field and semiclassical approximations, we demonstrate that the long-time average of the QFI reveals universal behavior that persists across different systems.

Title: Sensing with Broken Symmetry: Revisiting Bound States in the Continuum
Authors: Brijesh Kumar, Elizaveta Tsiplakova, Samuel John, Parul Sharma, Nikolay Solodovchenko, Andrey Bogdanov, Shriganesh S. Prabhu, Abhishek Kumar, Anshuman Kumar
Abstract: Metasurface with bound states in the continuum (BICs) offer exceptional potential for optical sensing due to their inherently high quality (Q) factors. However, the detection of symmetry-protected BICs remains experimentally challenging due to their non-radiative nature. Introducing slight asymmetry makes these resonances observable, though it reduces the Q-factor. In real devices, intrinsic material losses further affect the resonance behavior and sensing performance. While it is often assumed that sensing is optimized at the critical coupling when radiative and non-radiative losses are balanced, the precise conditions for achieving the best limit of detection (LOD) and figure-of-merit (FOM) remain under active discussion. In this work, we experimentally and theoretically investigate BIC-based sensing in the terahertz (THz) range. We demonstrate that the LOD exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on asymmetry, reaching an unexpected optimum where radiative and non-radiative losses are not equal. Moreover, we show that this optimum differs between reflection and transmission sensing schemes. Our results provide practical guidelines for optimizing Q-factor, sensitivity, and signal amplitude together, and contribute to a deeper understanding of the fundamental limits of BIC-based sensing.

Title: Concurrent Skin-scale-free Localization and Criticality under Möbius Boundary Conditions in a Non-Hermitian Ladder
Authors: Shu Long, Linhu Li
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems possess exotic localization phenomena beyond their Hermitian counterparts, exhibiting massive accumulation of eigenstates at the system boundaries with different scaling behaviors. In this study, we investigate two weakly coupled non-Hermitian Hatano-Nelson chains under Möbius boundary conditions (MBCs), and reveal the coexistence of two distinct localization behaviors for eigenstates. Namely, eigenstates exhibit non-Hermitian skin effect in one chain and scale-free localization in the other. Notably, the localization characteristics of eigenstates can exchange between the two chains depending on their eigenenergies. This phenomenon is found to emerge from the critical behaviors induced by the weak interchain coupling, which can even be enhanced by MBCs in comparison \red{to} the system under other boundary conditions. Our findings deepen the understanding of non-Hermitian localization and criticality, and offer new insights into engineering tunable edge-localized states in synthetic quantum systems.

Title: Metamaterials and Negative Refractive Index
Authors: D. R. Smith, J. B. Pendry, M. C. K. Wiltshire
Abstract: Recently, artificially constructed metamaterials have become of considerable interest, as these materials can exhibit electromagnetic characteristics unlike any conventional materials. Artificial magnetism and negative refractive index are two specific types of behavior that have been demonstrated over the past few years, illustrating the new physics and new applications possible when we expand our view as to what constitutes a material. In this review, we describe recent advances in metamaterials research, and discuss the potential that these materials may hold for realizing new and seemingly exotic electromagnetic phenomena.

Title: Dynamical scheme for computing the mass parameter of a system in a medium
Authors: Agata Zdanowicz, Daniel Pęcak, Piotr Magierski, Gabriel Wlazłowski
Abstract: We present a new method for extracting a mass parameter using time-dependent density functional theory for an arbitrary physical system, provided the adiabatic limit is achievable. This approach works for collective variables also in the presence of a medium, in particular for the nuclei interacting with a neutron background. We apply the method to extract mass parameters of impurities in the neutron star crust, like their inertial masses and quadrupole mass parameters. The extracted mass parameters at various depths of the inner crust are compared with other methods, including the hydrodynamic approach. The presented method opens avenues for the construction of an effective model of neutron star crust grounded in microscopic calculations.

Title: Tailored-light photocurrent spectroscopy for probing time-reversal symmetry-broken phases
Authors: Daniel M. B. Lesko, Tobias Weitz, Simon Wittigschlager, Selina Nöcker, Weizhe Li, Peter Hommelhoff, Ofer Neufeld
Abstract: Light-field-driven photocurrents represent a powerful tool for generating photocurrents without external bias in light-matter systems that lack inversion symmetry. While these photocurrents are used in electronic applications, such as current sources, switches, and photovoltaics, their presence can also be used to probe material properties in and out of equilibrium, such as this http URL we advance this path of light-field-driven photocurrent spectroscopy by utilizing tailored laser fields for ultrafast photocurrent generation. We employ combinations of bichromatic linearly-polarized laser beams that individually respect mirror and time-reversal symmetry (TRS). Hence they do not lead to a field-driven photocurrent individually, but when superposed can break individual symmetries and generate photocurrents. For unique choices of the relative polarization angle and two-color phase the tailored light exhibits TRS while breaking all other crystal symmetries, which imposes a forbidden photocurrent selection rule in TRS-invariant systems as we show both theoretically and experimentally. We employ state-of-the-art \textit{ab-initio} simulations to validate this physical mechanism, and, crucially, predict its breaking in materials with intrinsically-broken TRS, creating a background free signal for magnetism and Chern physics. Our work paves way for probing TRS-broken phases of matter in an ultrafast time-resolved manner, not requiring the application of external magnetic fields or even circularly-polarized electric fields.

Title: Emergent dynamical scaling in the inviscid limit of 3D stochastic Navier-Stokes equation with thermal noise
Authors: Liubov Gosteva, Marc Brachet, Léonie Canet
Abstract: Spectrally truncated three-dimensional (3D) Euler flows reach an absolute equilibrium. Yet they show non-trivial temporal correlations, similar to the ones of turbulent flows. In this work, we investigate Navier-Stokes equation in equilibrium conditions, both at finite viscosity and in the inviscid limit. We determine the space-time velocity correlations, using functional renormalisation group and direct numerical simulations. We characterise the crossover in the dynamical scaling from $\tau\sim 1/(\nu k^2)$ at finite viscosity to $\tau\sim 1/(u_{\rm rms}k)$ in the inviscid limit, where $\tau$ is the decorrelation time. We show that, although the static properties of spectrally truncated Euler flows radically differ from their hydrodynamical limit, they share a similar emergent $k^{-1}$ dynamical scaling.

Authors: Pietro Marabotti, Simone Melesi, Piotr Pińkowski, Bartłomiej Pigulski, Sonia Peggiani, Alice Cartoceti, Patrick Serafini, Barbara Rossi, Valeria Russo, Sławomir Szafert, Carlo Spartaco Casari
Abstract: We report the first synthesis of halogenated organic molecules via pulsed laser ablation in liquid, specifically halopolyynes, i.e., carbon atomic wires terminated by halogen atoms, and the first Raman characterization of long halogenated wires. Using dichloromethane and a dibromomethane-containing solution, we produced a polydisperse mixtures of monohalogeanted (HC$_n$X) and dihalogenated (XC$_n$X) polyynes (X=Cl, Br; n=6-20). High-performance liquid chromatography enabled us to separate and analyze these compounds, while chemical derivatization and mass spectroscopy confirmed their molecular structures. Their formation mechanism involves carbon chain polymerization and termination by halogen atoms from atomized solvent molecules during the plasma phase. UV-Vis absorption and synchrotron-based UV Resonance Raman spectroscopy revealed that halogen terminations act as weak electron donors, slightly affecting conjugation, bond length alternation, and moderately redshifting vibronic absorption and vibrational modes. Resonance Raman spectra show selective overtone enhancement, an emerging signature behavior of carbyne-like systems. Vibrational anharmonicity measurements confirm that halopolyynes follow the universal anharmonicity law previously proposed for carbyne-like materials, solidifying their classification within this family. These findings not only expand the synthetic toolbox for carbon atomic wires but also establish halopolyynes as a versatile platform for tailoring wire terminations and developing novel materials with tunable electronic and optical properties.

Title: Exploring the Growth Dynamics of Size-selected Carbon Atomic Wires with in situ UV Resonance Raman Spectroscopy
Authors: Pietro Marabotti, Sonia Peggiani, Simone Melesi, Barbara Rossi, Alessandro Gessini, Andrea Li Bassi, Valeria Russo, Carlo Spartaco Casari
Abstract: Short carbon atomic wires, the prototypes of the lacking carbon allotrope carbyne, represent the fundamental one-dimensional system and the first stage in carbon nanostructure growth, which still exhibits many open points regarding their growth and stability. We introduce an in situ UV resonance Raman approach for real-time monitoring of the growth of carbon atomic wires during pulsed laser ablation in liquid without perturbing the synthesis environment. We track single-chain species' growth dynamics, achieving size selectivity by exploiting the peculiar optoelectronic properties of carbon wires and the tunability of synchrotron radiation. We systematically explore diverse solvents, finding size- and solvent-dependent production rates linked to the solvent's C/H ratio and carbonization tendency. Carbon atomic wires' growth dynamics reveal a complex interplay between formation and degradation, leading to an equilibrium. Water, lacking in carbon atoms and reduced polyynes' solubility, yields fewer wires with rapid saturation. Organic solvents exhibit enhanced productivity and near-linear growth, attributed to additional carbon from solvent dissociation and low relative polarity. Exploring the dynamics of the saturation regime provides new insights into advancing carbon atomic wires' synthesis via PLAL. Understanding carbon atomic wires' growth dynamics can contribute to optimizing PLAL processes for nanomaterial synthesis.

Title: Wave/particle duality in monitored Jaynes--Cummings resonances
Authors: Th. K. Mavrogordatos
Abstract: We operationally uncover aspects of wave/particle duality for the open driven Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model in its strong-coupling limit. We lay special emphasis on the vacuum Rabi resonance, and determine the corresponding normalized intensity-field correlation function via mapping to ordinary resonance fluorescence. We demonstrate that temporal wave-particle fluctuations of light emanating from an established vacuum Rabi resonance are explicitly non-classical, while the limit of vanishing spontaneous emission restores detailed balance. When photon blockade sets in, individual realizations show a rapidly increasing frequency of fluctuations towards the two-photon resonance, arising as a direct consequence of a resolved JC spectrum. About the two-photon resonance peak, spontaneous emissions are more likely to revive a high-frequency quantum beat in the conditioned electromagnetic field amplitude than photons escaping out of the cavity mode. The beat originates from a coherent superposition of the first excited JC couplet states, and sets the background against which nonclassical phase shifts are observed in the conditioned quadrature amplitudes. We also find that the onset of steady-state bimodality reduces the variation of the normalized intensity-field correlation, at the expense of its temporal symmetry.

Title: Synthetic Turbulence via an Instanton Gas Approximation
Authors: Timo Schorlepp, Katharina Kormann, Jeremiah Lübke, Tobias Schäfer, Rainer Grauer
Abstract: Sampling synthetic turbulent fields as a computationally tractable surrogate for direct numerical simulations (DNS) is an important practical problem in various applications, and allows to test our physical understanding of the main features of real turbulent flows. Reproducing higher-order Eulerian correlation functions, as well as Lagrangian particle statistics, requires an accurate representation of coherent structures of the flow in the synthetic turbulent fields. To this end, we propose in this paper a systematic coherent-structure based method for sampling synthetic random fields, based on a superposition of instanton configurations - an instanton gas - from the field-theoretic formulation of turbulence. We discuss sampling strategies for ensembles of instantons, both with and without interactions and including Gaussian fluctuations around them. The resulting Eulerian and Lagrangian statistics are evaluated numerically and compared against DNS results, as well as Gaussian and log-normal cascade models that lack coherent structures. The instanton gas approach is illustrated via the example of one-dimensional Burgers turbulence throughout this paper, and we show that already a canonical ensemble of non-interacting instantons without fluctuations reproduces DNS statistics very well. Finally, we outline extensions of the method to higher dimensions, in particular to magnetohydrodynamic turbulence for future applications to cosmic ray propagation.

Title: Sliding of a liquid spherical drop in an external fluid: a generalization of the Hadamard-Rybczynski equation
Authors: Peter Lebedev-Stepanov
Abstract: An analytical solution is obtained for the problem of the slow movement of a small drop of liquid in another immiscible liquid in an infinitely large reservoir with the boundary condition of partial slip at the liquid-liquid interface. That generalizes the conventional Navier condition of partial slip that given at the liquid-solid interface, since the solid (rigid) state can be considered as a liquid with infinite viscosity. A generalized Hadamard-Rybczynski equation (HRE) is obtained. If slip length {\lambda}=0 that equation transforms into the conventional HRE. For infinite viscosity of the droplet, generalized HRE becomes a well-known relation generalizing the Stokes drag force for a solid sphere, taking into account the boundary condition of partial slip. At certain {\lambda}, we arrive at a model with continuity of the all components of the viscous stress tensor at the interface of two fluids, including diagonal tensor components. Generalized HRE is applied to the interpretation of the experiment in which the velocity of falling of a spherical droplet of silicate oil in the castor oil is investigated. Streamlines have been built corresponding to both the Hadamard-Rybczynski model and the partial slip approach. Presumably, the best applicability of the generalized HRE should be expected for the interface of hydrophobic liquid and hydrophilic one (water - hydrocarbons, water - higher alcohols, in general: aqueous emulsions, water - lipophilic organic liquids and oils, etc.). These are quite important emulsions in practical terms, for example, for the oil industry and medicine. Experimental methods for determining the slip length are discussed.

Title: Spin-Based Modeling of Perception as Emergent from contextualized Internal Evaluation
Authors: Laura Fanfarillo, Gustavo Diez, Victor Gómez Mayordomo, Miguel Bosch, J. Ricardo Arias-Gonzalez, Belén Valenzuela
Abstract: We develop a microscopic model of perception of an interoceptive sensation in which spin-like variables encode an organism's internal evaluation of embodied vital norms associated with the sensation. Spins can take positive, negative, or neutral values. These local valorizations interact on a lattice embedded in the environmental context, and their collective configuration gives rise to a macroscopic perceptual state. By applying a coarse-graining procedure to a family of symmetric spin models, we derive a macroscopic Landau-type functional that makes explicit the mechanism by which key phenomenological features of perception, emerge from microscopic evaluative interactions. A central result is that the inclusion of a neutral evaluative state fundamentally alters the structure of the perceptual landscape, enhancing entropy, lowering the critical threshold, and increasing sensitivity to contextual input. These results establish a principled link between microscopic evaluative processes and large-scale perceptual organization, offering a flexible framework for integrating perceptual regulation and neurobiological modeling. The model integrates notions of neuroscience and cognitive science using the formalism of condensed matter field theory and providing novel theoretical insights and experimental predictions for conditions such as mental disorders and chronic pain.

Title: On-chip magnon polaritons in the ultrastrong coupling regime
Authors: Shugo Yoshii, Manuel Müller, Ryo Ohshima, Matthias Althammer, Yuichiro Ando, Hans Huebl, Masashi Shiraishi
Abstract: Light-matter interactions underpin the quantum technologies from quantum information processing to quantum sensing. When the coupling strength of light-matter interactions approaches the resonance frequencies of light and matter - the ultrastrong coupling regime - antiresonant (counter-rotating) processes, in which a photon and a matter excitation are simultaneously created or annihilated, induce non-negligible ground-state quantum entanglement between light and matter. Ultrastrong coupling thus provides a robust platform for noise-tolerant quantum entanglement, essential for reliable quantum technologies. However, the diamagnetic term typically counteracts antiresonant interactions, inhibiting intriguing phenomena such as thermal equibilium superradiant phase this http URL, we present an on-chip platform consisting of a superconducting resonator and thin ferromagnetic films achieving ultrastrong magnon-photon coupling system (magnon polaritons) via collective magnetic-dipole interactions, significantly circumventing the diamagnetic term. We experimentally demonstrate a pronounced Bloch-Siegert shift of about 60 MHz - direct evidence of antiresonant interactions - and observe cooperative enhancement of the effective coupling strength through increasing the number of remote magnon elements coupling with one photon mode. This scalable platform facilitates exploration of exotic quantum phenomena driven by antiresonant interactions, bridging spintronics and quantum optics, and enabling noise-tolerant quantum technological applications.

Title: A kinetic model to simulate charge flow through an electrochemical half cell
Authors: Diego Veloza-Diaz (1), Friederike Schmid (1), Robinson Cortes-Huerto (2), Pietro Ballone (2), Nancy C. Forero-Martinez (1) ((1) Institut für Physik, Johannes Gutenberg-Universität Mainz, Germany (2) Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research, Mainz, Germany)
Abstract: A kinetic model of the electron transfer at the electrode / electrolyte solution interface is developed, implemented in a Monte Carlo framework, and applied to simulate this process in idealised systems consisting of the primitive model of electrolyte solutions limited by an impenetrable conducting surface. In the present implementation, a charged, spherical interface surrounding an equally spherical sample of electrolyte solution is introduced to model a single-electrode system, providing the computational analog to the conceptual half-cell picture that is widely used in electrochemistry. The electron transfer itself is described as a simple surface hopping process underlying a first order reaction corresponding to one of the coupled M/M$^+$ and X$^-$/X half reactions. Then, the electron transfer at the interface is combined with the self-diffusion of ions in the electrolyte solutions whose role is to supply reagents and disperse products, allowing the system to settle in a stationary non-equilibrium state. Simulations for the primitive model of electrolyte in contact with a charged impenetrable surface show that, after a brief transient, the samples sustain a steady current through the electrolyte solution. The results quantify the dependence of the current on: the overall charge of the electrode, the electrolyte concentration, the solvent viscosity and the kinetic parameter $k_e$ that represents the rate of the electron transfer for each ion in contact with the electrode. Since the simulated interface is very idealised, strategies to overcome the limitations of the present model are outlined and briefly discussed.

Title: Surface-Code Hardware Hamiltonian
Authors: Xuexin Xu, Kuljeet Kaur, Chloé Vignes, Mohammad H. Ansari, John M. Martinis
Abstract: We present a scalable framework for accurately modeling many-body interactions in surface-code quantum processor units (QPUs). Combining a concise diagrammatic formalism with high-precision numerical methods, our approach efficiently evaluates high-order, long-range Pauli string couplings and maps complete chip layouts onto exact effective Hamiltonians. Applying this method to surface-code architectures, such as Google's Sycamore lattice, we identify three distinct operational regimes: computationally stable, error-dominated, and hierarchy-inverted. Our analysis reveals that even modest increases in residual qubit-qubit crosstalk can invert the interaction hierarchy, driving the system from a computationally favorable phase into a topologically ordered regime. This framework thus serves as a powerful guide for optimizing next-generation high-fidelity surface-code hardware and provides a pathway to investigate emergent quantum many-body phenomena.

Abstract: We perform a numerical study of a new microcanonical polymer model on the three dimensional cubic lattice, consisting of ideal chains whose range and number of nearest-neighbor contacts are fixed to given values. Our simulations suggest an interesting exact relation concerning the internal energy per monomer of the Interacting Self-Avoiding Walk at the $\theta-$point.

Robinson, Mauricio Terrones, Archana Raja, Adam Schwartzberg, D. Frank Ogletree, Jeffrey B. Neaton, Michael F. Crommie, Francesco Allegretti, Willi Auwärter, Eli Rotenberg, Alexander Weber-Bargioni
Abstract: Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) behavior in one-dimensional systems has been predicted and shown to occur at semiconductor-to-metal transitions within two-dimensional materials. Reports of one-dimensional defects hosting a Fermi liquid or a TLL have suggested a dependence on the underlying substrate, however, unveiling the physical details of electronic contributions from the substrate require cross-correlative investigation. Here, we study TLL formation within defectively engineered WS$_2$ atop graphene, where band structure and the atomic environment is visualized with nano angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, and non-contact atomic force microscopy. Correlations between the local density of states and electronic band dispersion elucidated the electron transfer from graphene into a TLL hosted by one-dimensional metal (1DM) defects. It appears that the vertical heterostructure with graphene and the induced charge transfer from graphene into the 1DM is critical for the formation of a TLL.

Title: Investigating Josephson plasmons in layered cuprates via nonlinear terahertz spectroscopy
Authors: Jacopo Fiore, Niccolò Sellati, Francesco Gabriele, Claudio Castellani, Goetz Seibold, Mattia Udina, Lara Benfatto
Abstract: Josephson plasmons in layered superconductors represent a natural source of optical non-linearity, thanks to their intrinsically anharmonic nature. Here we derive the selection rules behind non-linear plasmonics showing its dependence on plasmonic branches hidden to other spectroscopies, like RIXS. We benchmark our results for the case of layered cuprates, showing how in a layered system the combined effect of plasmon dispersion and light polarization can move the resonance of the bilayer system away from the plasma edge measured in linear spectroscopy. Our results demonstrate the dependence of the non-linear THz response on the convoluted plasmon dispersion in a momentum region complementary to RIXS, and offer a possible perspective for the generation of THz pulses by artificially designed Josephson heterostructures.

Title: Emergent criticality in a constrained boson model
Authors: Anirudha Menon, Anwesha Chattopadhyay, K. Sengupta, Arnab Sen
Abstract: We show, via explicit computation on a constrained bosonic model, that the presence of subsystem symmetries can lead to a quantum phase transition (QPT) where the critical point exhibits an emergent enhanced symmetry. Such a transition separates a unique gapped ground state from a gapless one; the latter phase exhibits a broken $Z_2$ symmetry which we tie to the presence of the subsystem symmetries in the model. The intermediate critical point separating these phases exhibits an additional emergent $Z_2$ symmetry which we identify. This emergence leads to a critical theory which seems to be different from those in the Ising universality class. Instead, within the data obtained from finite-size scaling analysis, we find the critical theory to be not inconsistent with Ashkin-Teller universality in the sense that the transitions of the model reproduces a critical line with variable correlation length exponent $\nu$ but constant central charge $c$ close to unity. We verify this scenario via explicit exact-diagonalization computations, provide an effective Landau-Ginzburg theory for such a transition, and discuss the connection of our model to the PXP model describing Rydberg atom arrays.

Title: Strong Temperature Dependence of Thermal Conductivity in High-Purity Cubic Boron Arsenide

Abstract: Materials with high thermal conductivity are needed to conduct heat away from hot spots in high power electronics and optoelectronic devices. Cubic boron arsenide (c-BAs) has a high thermal conductivity due to its special phonon dispersion relation. Previous experimental studies of c-BAs report a room-temperature thermal conductivity between 1000 and 1300 W m-1 K-1. We synthesized high purity isotopically enriched c-BAs single crystals with room-temperature thermal conductivity of around 1500 W m-1 K-1. Using time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR), we measured thermal conductivity and found a 1/T2 temperature dependence between 300 K and 600 K - slightly stronger than predictions from state-of-the-art theoretical models. Brillouin and Raman scattering revealed minimal changes in phonon frequencies over the same temperature range, suggesting that the observed 1/T2 dependence is not caused by temperature dependent changes in phonon dispersion. To probe defect densities in the BAs crystals we studied, we conducted transient reflectivity microscopy (TRM) measurements of absorption at sub-bandgap photon energies. We observe a correlation between TRM signal intensity and thermal conductivity. Notably, samples with thermal conductivity near 1500 W m-1 K-1 still exhibited nonzero TRM signals, suggesting the presence of defects despite the high thermal conductivity.

Title: Tailoring the Morphology of Cellulose Nanocrystals via Controlled Aggregation
Authors: Kévin Ballu, Jia-Hui Lim, Thomas G. Parton, Richard M. Parker, Bruno Frka-Petesic, Alexei A. Lapkin, Yu Ogawa, Silvia Vignolini
Abstract: Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) are elongated nanoparticles derived from natural cellulose, with potential applications ranging from rheological modifiers and emulsion stabilizers to photonic pigments and sensors. For most applications, precise control over CNC morphology and surface chemistry is essential, but the relationship between process parameters, CNC characteristics, and their resulting behavior is poorly understood. Here, we investigate the impact of centrifugation and ionic strength on CNC morphology after dialysis using transmission electron microscopy, small-angle X-ray scattering and scanning electron diffraction. We find that the centrifugation step commonly applied during CNC purification promotes the formation of compact composite nanoparticles made of aligned crystallites, referred to as 'bundles', that are associated preferentially along their hydrophobic faces. In stark contrast, transient exposure to high ionic strength leads to fractal-like, irregular composite nanoparticles. We then examine the consequence of these morphological differences on the cholesteric self-organization of the CNCs: aligned bundles reduce the cholesteric pitch in suspension, causing a blue-shift in the color of dish-cast photonic films, while misaligned particles promote gelation, producing colorless films. This study reveals the importance of sample history, in particular, the often-disregarded purification steps, on CNC characteristics and their ensemble behavior, thereby unlocking new routes for tailoring this promising nanomaterial.

Title: Fingerprints of a charge ice state in the doped Mott insulator Nb$_3$Cl$_8$
Authors: Evgeny A. Stepanov
Abstract: The interplay between strong electronic correlations and the inherent frustration of certain lattice geometries is a common mechanism for the formation of nontrivial states of matter. In this work, we theoretically explore the collective electronic effects in the monolayer Nb$_3$Cl$_8$, a recently discovered triangular lattice Mott insulator. Our advanced many-body numerical simulations predict the emergence of a phase separation region upon doping this material. Notably, in close proximity to the phase separation, the static charge susceptibility undergoes a drastic change and reveals a distinctive bow-tie structure in momentum space. The appearance of such a fingerprint in the context of spin degrees of freedom would indicate the formation of a spin ice state. This finding allows us to associate the observed phase separation to a charge ice state, a state with a remarkable power law dependence of both the effective exchange interaction and correlations between electronic densities in real space.

Title: Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer State Representation and Pairing in the Fermionic Tonks-Girardeau Gas
Authors: Francesc Sabater, Abel Rojo-Francàs, Grigori E. Astrakharchik, Bruno Juliá-Díaz
Abstract: We introduce an alternative expression for the ground state wave function of the fermionic Tonks-Girardeau gas. Our wave function is constructed based on the occupation numbers and natural orbitals of the one-body density matrix. We demonstrate that the newly found wave function describes the ground state of the fermionic Tonks-Girardeau gas under any external potential. By expressing the proposed wave function in the framework of second quantization, we show that the ground state of the fermionic Tonks-Girardeau gas is a number-conserving Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) state. We provide explicit expressions for the corresponding coefficients that describe the fermionic Tonks-Girardeau gas as a number-conserving BCS state. Additionally, the suitable form of the proposed wave function in second quantization allows us to derive the necessary expectation values to experimentally detect pairing in the fermionic Tonks-Girardeau gas. With this, we prove and show how to detect that the fermionic Tonks-Girardeau gas not only exhibits non-trivial quantum correlations but is also a paired state.

Title: Scale locality of information flow in shell models of turbulence
Authors: Tomohiro Tanogami
Abstract: Turbulent fluctuations exhibit universal scaling laws that are independent of large-scale statistics. It is often explained that such universality is caused by the loss of information about large-scale statistics during the cascade process. In our previous study [T. Tanogami and R. Araki, Phys. Rev. Research 6, 013090 (2024)], we applied information thermodynamics to turbulence and proved that information of large-scale turbulent fluctuations is propagated to small scales. As a first step toward understanding how universality emerges at small scales under the influence of the information flow from large scales, here we investigate the scale locality of the information flow for shell models. First, we analytically show that the information flow can be decomposed into scale-local and scale-nonlocal parts. Then, by assuming the Kolmogorov hypothesis for the Kolmogorov multiplier, we prove that the scale-nonlocal part can be ignored compared to the scale-local part. This result implies that the information transfer from large to small scales occurs mainly through scale-local interactions, which is consistent with the scale locality of the energy cascade.

Title: Coadjoint-orbit bosonization of a Fermi surface in a weak magnetic field
Authors: Mengxing Ye, Yuxuan Wang
Abstract: We present a bosonized effective field theory for a 2d Fermi surface in a weak magnetic field using the coadjoint orbit approach, which was recently developed as a nonlinear bosonization method in phase space for Fermi liquids and non-Fermi liquids. We show that by parametrizing the phase space with the guiding center and the mechanical momentum, and by using techniques in noncommutative field theory, the physics of Landau levels and Landau level degeneracy ($N_{\Phi}$) naturally arises. For a parabolic dispersion, the resulting theory describes $N_{\Phi}$ flavors of free chiral bosons propagating in \emph{momentum space}. In addition, the action contains a linear term in the bosonic field, which upon mode expansion becomes a topological $\theta$-term. By properly quantizing this theory, we reproduce the well-known thermal and magnetic responses of a Fermi surface, including linear-in-$T$ specific heat, Landau diamagnetism, and the de Haas-van Alphen effect. {In particular, the de Haas-van Alphen effect is shown to be a direct consequence of the topological $\theta$-term.} Our theory paves the way toward understanding correlated gapless fermionic systems in a magnetic field using the powerful approach of bosonization.

Title: Plasmon Mode Engineering with Electrons on Helium
Authors: C.A. Mikolas, N.R. Beysengulov, A.J. Schleusner, D.G. Rees, C. Undershute, J. Pollanen
Abstract: An ensemble of electrons trapped above superfluid helium offers a paradigm system for investigating and controlling collective charge dynamics in low-dimensional electronic matter. Of particular interest is the ability to spatially control and engineer surface plasmons for integration with hybrid quantum systems and circuit quantum electrodynamic device architectures. Here we present experiments using an electron-on-helium microchannel device that hosts microwave-frequency plasmons, generated via local microwave excitation in an electrostatically defined central channel. By precisely varying the electron density, we demonstrate tunability of plasmon mode frequencies over several GHz. Additionally, we find that the power dependence of these modes can be used to investigate both homogeneous and inhomogeneous sources of spectral broadening. These results demonstrate the versatility of electrons on helium for probing collective excitations in low-dimensional Coulomb liquids and solids, and demonstrate a path for integrating engineered plasmons in electrons on helium with hybrid circuit quantum electrodynamic systems.

Title: Slip-dominated structural transitions
Authors: Kanka Ghosh, Oguz Umut Salman, Sylvain Queyreau, Lev Truskinovsky
Abstract: We use molecular dynamics to show that plastic slip is a crucial component of the transformation mechanism of a square-to-triangular structural transition. The latter is a stylized analog of many other reconstructive phase transitions. To justify our conclusions we use a novel atomistically-informed mesoscopic representation of the field of lattice distortions in molecular dynamics simulations. Our approach reveals a hidden alternating slip distribution behind the seemingly homogeneous product phase which points to the fact that lattice invariant shears play a central role in this class of phase transformations. While the underlying pattern of anti-parallel displacements may be also interpreted as microscopic shuffling, its precise crystallographic nature strongly suggests the plasticity-centered interpretation.

Title: LiV2O4: Hund-Assisted Orbital-Selective Mottness
Authors: Martin Grundner, Fabian B. Kugler, Olivier Parcollet, Ulrich Schollwöck, Antoine Georges, Alexander Hampel
Abstract: We show that the remarkably small Fermi-liquid coherence scale and large effective mass observed in LiV$_2$O$_4$ are due to the proximity of a Hund-assisted orbital-selective Mott state. Our work is based on an ab initio dynamical mean-field approach, combining several quantum impurity solvers to capture the physics from high to very low temperature. We find that the Hund coupling plays a crucial role in rearranging the orbital populations and in generating the heavy mass and low coherence scale. The latter is found to be approximately 1-2 Kelvin, even though the most correlated orbital is found to be significantly doped ~10% away from half-filling. A flat quasiparticle band appears near the Fermi level as a result of the strong electronic correlations. Finally, we discuss our results in comparison to experiments.

Title: Synthetic Mutual Gauge Field in Microwave-Shielded Polar Molecular Gases
Authors: Bei Xu, Fan Yang, Ran Qi, Hui Zhai, Peng Zhang
Abstract: The recent breakthrough of realizing the Bose-Einstein condensate of polar molecules and degenerate Fermi molecules in three dimensions relies crucially on the microwave shielding technique, which strongly suppresses the collision loss between molecules. In this letter, we show that the cooperation of microwave shielding and dipolar interaction naturally leads to the emergence of a synthetic gauge field. Unlike that studied in cold atoms before, this gauge field couples to the relative motion of every two molecules instead of single-particle motion, therefore being a mutual gauge field. In this case, every molecule carrying a synthetic charge sees the other molecule as carrying the source of the magnetic field, and the spatial distribution of the magnetic field is reminiscent of a solenoid attached to the molecule. In other words, in addition to microwave-shielded interaction, another part of the interaction between two molecules behaves as a charge interacting with a solenoid, which was missed in the previous discussion. We argue that the physical manifestation of this gauge field is breaking time-reversal symmetry in the collective spatial motion of molecules. Finally, we discuss the challenges in quantitatively studying such a quantum many-body system.

Title: The transition from homeostasis to stochasticity induced catastrophe
Authors: Rudro R. Biswas, Charles S. Wright, Kunaal Joshi, Srividya Iyer-Biswas
Abstract: What are the signatures of the onset of catastrophe? Here we present the rich system physics characterizing the transition from homeostasis to stochasticity driven breakdown in an experimentally motivated minimal model. Recent high-precision experiments on individual bacterial cells, growing and dividing repeatedly in a variety of environments, have revealed a previously unknown intergenerational scaling law which not only uniquely determines the stochastic map governing homeostasis, but also, as we show here, offers quantitative insights into the transition from the "conspiracy principle" regime (homeostasis) to the "catastrophe principle" regime and then to system breakdown. In fact, upon closer examination, the stochastic map turns out to be a one-dimensional Kesten process; these transitions occur as a single parameter, the strength of the multiplicative noise term, is continuously tuned. Emergence of asymptotically scale invariant distributions with quantifiable power law tails, outlier driven extremal behavior and reverse monotonicity of the conditional exceedance distribution characterize this transition to catastrophe. In turn, prevention of rapid increase in the extremal event-driven rate of failure, in the interest of system preservation, causes the catastrophe regime to be strategically unfavorable.

Title: Supersymmetry dynamics on Rydberg atom arrays
Authors: Shuo Liu, Zhengzhi Wu, Shi-Xin Zhang, Hong Yao
Abstract: Spacetime supersymmetry (SUSY) that interchanges fermions and bosons is of great theoretical importance but has not yet been revealed experimentally in particle physics. It has also been desired to explore quantum-mechanical SUSY in microscopic lattice models. Inspired by the recent experiments of Floquet engineering of Rydberg atom arrays, we propose to simulate quantum mechanical supersymmetric model and realize quantum mechanical SUSY in Floquet Rydberg atom arrays. Moreover, we utilize the supercharge dynamics to demonstrate the SUSY property of the model under investigation: the expectation value of supercharge freezes under time evolution for supersymmetric lattice models in contrast to the trivial oscillation for generic nonsupersymmetric lattice models. The proposal is validated on direct simulation of Rydberg atom arrays' dynamics and ready for experiments. This work sheds light on the future experimental exploration of SUSY with the help of Rydberg atom arrays.

Title: Non-equilibrium coexistence between a fluid and a hotter or colder crystal of granular hard disks
Authors: R. Maire, A. Plati, F. Smallenburg, G. Foffi
Abstract: Non-equilibrium phase coexistence is commonly observed in both biological and artificial systems, yet understanding it remains a significant challenge. Unlike equilibrium systems, where free energy provides a unifying framework, the absence of such a quantity in non-equilibrium settings complicates their theoretical understanding. Granular materials, driven out of equilibrium by energy dissipation during collisions, serve as an ideal platform to investigate these systems, offering insights into the parallels and distinctions between equilibrium and non-equilibrium phase behavior. For example, the coexisting dense phase is typically colder than the dilute phase, a result usually attributed to greater dissipation in denser regions. In this article, we demonstrate that this is not always the case. Using a simple numerical granular model, we show that a hot solid and a cold liquid can coexist in granular systems. This counterintuitive phenomenon arises because the collision frequency can be lower in the solid phase than in the liquid phase, consistent with equilibrium results for hard-disk systems. We further demonstrate that kinetic theory can be extended to accurately predict phase temperatures even at very high packing fractions, including within the solid phase. Our results highlight the importance of collisional dynamics and energy exchange in determining phase behavior in granular materials, offering new insights into non-equilibrium phase coexistence and the complex physics underlying granular systems.

Title: Emergent facilitation by random constraints in a facilitated random walk model of glass
Authors: Leo S.I. Lam, Hai-Yao Deng, Wei-Bing Zhang, Udoka Nwankwo, Chu Xiao, Cho-Tung Yip, Chun-Shing Lee, Haihui Ruan, Chi-Hang Lam
Abstract: The physics of glass has been a significant topic of interest for decades. Dynamical facilitation is widely believed to be an important characteristic of glassy dynamics, but the precise mechanism is still under debate. We propose a lattice model of glass called the facilitated random walk (FRW). Each particle performs continuous time random walk in the presence of its own random local kinetic constraints. The particles do not interact energetically. Instead, they interact kinetically with a hopping rate resampling rule under which motions of a particle can randomly perturb the local kinetic constraints of other particles. This dynamic interaction is reversible, following a rate restoration rule. A step-by-step reversal of the particle motions exactly restore the previous constraints, modeling randomness quenched in the configuration space of glass. The model exhibits stretched exponential relaxation and dynamical heterogeneity typical of glasses. Despite the lack of explicit facilitation rule, the FRW shows facilitation behaviors closely analogous to those of the kinetically constrained models (KCM). The FRW is a coarse-grained version of the distinguishable particle lattice model (DPLM) and this exemplifies that compatible defect and atomistic models can complement each other on the study of glass.

Title: Odd-frequency pairing due to Majorana and trivial Andreev bound states
Authors: Eslam Ahmed, Shun Tamura, Yukio Tanaka, Jorge Cayao
Abstract: Majorana and trivial Andreev bound states are predicted to appear in superconductor-semiconductor hybrid systems, but their identification is still a challenging task. Here we consider superconducting junctions with Rashba spin-orbit coupling and explore the signatures of Majorana and trivial Andreev bound states in the emergent superconducting correlations when the systems are subjected to an external Zeeman field. We first show that robust zero-energy Andreev bound states naturally appear due to confinement and helicity when the normal sector of the junction becomes helical. These Andreev states can evolve into Majorana states, developing alike oscillations around zero energy as a function of Zeeman field. Unlike Majorana states located at both ends, helical Andreev states are located at the interface. We then demonstrate that the emergent superconducting correlations are locally composed of even-frequency spin-singlet even-parity and odd-frequency spin-triplet even-parity pair amplitudes, which coexist due to the interplay of spin-orbit coupling, Zeeman field, and spatial translation invariance breaking. In the helical regime, trivial Andreev states enhance odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing, which decays in the superconductor and has a homogeneous long-range profile in the normal region. At zero frequency, however, odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing vanishes in the helical regime. In the topological phase, Majorana states enhance odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing, producing a long-range homogeneous leakage into the normal region. Interestingly, we discover that when Majorana states are truly zero-energy modes, odd-frequency pairing develops a divergent low-frequency profile, which we interpret as the unambiguous self-conjugated Majorana signature. Our results help understand Majorana and trivial Andreev states from a superconducting correlations perspective in Majorana devices.

Title: Competing phases of HfO$_2$ from unstable flat phonon bands of an unconventional high-symmetry structure
Authors: Yubo Qi, Karin M. Rabe
Abstract: We carry out first-principles calculations to demonstrate that the complex energy landscape and competing phases of HfO$_2$ can be understood from the four unstable flat phonon bands of an unconventional high-symmetry structure of HfO$_2$ with the space group $Cmma$. We consider structures generated from the $Cmma$ reference structure by all possible combinations of the zone center and zone boundary modes belonging to the unstable flat phonon branches. We find 12 distinct locally-stable structures, of which 5 correspond to well-known phases. We also show that 8 of these 12 structures can be described as period-2 superlattices of the ferroelectric $Pca2_1$ (oIII), ferroelectric $Pnm2_1$ (oIV), monoclinic $P2_1/c$ (m) and distorted monoclinic $P2_1/c$ (dm) structures. We demonstrate how the unstable flat phonon bands can explain the atomically thin grain boundaries in the various types of superlattices. Finally, we point out that arbitrary-period HfO$_2$ superlattices derived from the 6 different types of period-2 superlattices are expected to form based on the flatness of the unstable phonon branches. The organizing principle provided by this work deepens our understanding of the underlying physics in the phase stability of HfO$_2$ and provides guidance for functional phase stabilization.

Title: Wannier states and spin supersolid physics in the triangular antiferromagnet K$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$
Authors: M. Zhu, Leandro M. Chinellato, V. Romerio, N. Murai, S. Ohira-Kawamura, Christian Balz, Z. Yan, S. Gvasaliya, Yasuyuki Kato, C. D. Batista, A. Zheludev
Abstract: We combine ultra-high-resolution inelastic neutron scattering and quantum Monte Carlo simulations to study thermodynamics and spin excitations in the spin-supersolid phase of the triangular lattice XXZ antiferromagnet K$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$ under zero and non-zero magnetic field. BKT transitions signaling the onset of Ising and supersolid order are clearly identified, and the Wannier entropy is experimentally recovered just above the supersolid phase. At low temperatures, with an experimental resolution of about 23 $\mu$eV, no discrete coherent magnon modes are resolved within a broad scattering continuum. Alongside gapless excitations, a pseudo-Goldstone mode with a 0.06 meV gap is observed. A second, higher-energy continuum replaces single-spin-flip excitations of the Ising model. Under applied fields, the continuum evolves into coherent spin waves, with Goldstone and pseudo-Goldstone sectors responding differently. The experiments and simulations show excellent quantitative agreement.

Title: Subnanometric control of coupling between WS$_2$ monolayers with a molecular spacer
Authors: Sara A. Elrafei, Tom T. C. Sistermans, Alberto G. Curto
Abstract: Stacking monolayer semiconductors into heterostructures allows for control of their optical and electronic properties, offering advantages for nanoscale electronics, optoelectronics, and photonics. Specifically, adding a thin spacer between monolayers can yield bulk materials that retain interesting monolayer properties, such as a direct bandgap and a high emission quantum efficiency. The interaction mechanisms between monolayers, including interlayer coupling, charge transfer, and energy transfer, might be tuned through subnanometric control over the spacer thickness. Traditional spacer materials like bulk oxides or other layered materials can suffer from poor material interfaces or inhomogeneous thickness over large areas. Here, we use a spin-cast organic molecular spacer to adjust interlayer coupling in WS$_2$ monolayer stacks. We vary the molecular spacer thickness to tune the interlayer distance, significantly altering the optical properties of the resulting organic-inorganic heterostructures. Additionally, we demonstrate a dependence of the valence-band splitting on molecular spacer thickness manifested as a change in the energy difference between A and B excitons resulting from spin-orbit coupling and interlayer interactions. Our results illustrate the potential of molecular spacers to tailor the properties of monolayer heterostructures. This accessible approach opens new routes to advance atomically thin devices and could enable sensing technologies at the subnanometer scale.

Title: Quantum many-body dynamics for fermionic t-J model simulated with atom arrays
Authors: Ye-Bing Zhang, Xin-Chi Zhou, Bao-Zong Wang, Xiong-Jun Liu
Abstract: The fermionic t-J model has been widely recognized as a canonical model for broad range of strongly correlated phases, particularly the high-Tc superconductor. Simulating this model with controllable quantum platforms offers new possibilities to probe high-Tc physics, yet suffering challenges. Here we propose a novel scheme to realize a highly-tunable extended t-J model in a programmable Rydberg-dressed tweezer array. Through engineering the Rydberg-dressed dipole-dipole interaction and inter-tweezer couplings, the fermionic t-J model with independently tunable exchange and hopping couplings is achieved. With the high tunability, we explore quantum many-body dynamics in the large J/t limit, a regime well beyond the conventional optical lattices and cuprates, and predict an unprecedented many-body self-pinning effect enforced by local quantum entanglement with emergent conserved quantities. The self-pinning effect leads to novel nonthermal quantum many-body dynamics, which violates eigenstate thermalization hypothesis in Krylov subspace. Our prediction opens a new horizon in exploring exotic quantum many-body physics with t-J model, and shall also make a step towards simulating the high-Tc physics in neutral atom systems.

Title: Inferring Higher-Order Couplings with Neural Networks
Authors: Aurélien Decelle, Alfonso de Jesús Navas Gómez, Beatriz Seoane
Abstract: Maximum entropy methods, rooted in the inverse Ising/Potts problem from statistical physics, are widely used to model pairwise interactions in complex systems across disciplines such as bioinformatics and neuroscience. While successful, these approaches often fail to capture higher-order interactions that are critical for understanding collective behavior. In contrast, modern machine learning methods can model such interactions, but their interpretability often comes at a prohibitive computational cost. Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) provide a computationally efficient alternative by encoding statistical correlations through hidden units in a bipartite architecture. In this work, we introduce a method that maps RBMs onto generalized Potts models, enabling the systematic extraction of interactions up to arbitrary order. Leveraging large-$N$ approximations, made tractable by the RBM's structure, we extract effective many-body couplings with minimal computational effort. We further propose a robust framework for recovering higher-order interactions in more complex generative models, and introduce a simple gauge-fixing scheme for the effective Potts representation. Validation on synthetic data demonstrates accurate recovery of two- and three-body interactions. Applied to protein sequence data, our method reconstructs contact maps with high fidelity and outperforms state-of-the-art inverse Potts models. These results establish RBMs as a powerful and efficient tool for modeling higher-order structure in high-dimensional categorical data.

Title: The origin of anomalous non-linear microwave absorption in Josephson junction qubits: mysterious nature of two level systems or their dynamic interaction?
Authors: Alexander L. Burin
Abstract: Quantum two-level systems (TLSs) commonly found at low temperature in amorphous and disordered materials are responsible for decoherence in superconducting Josephson junction qubits particularly because they absorb energy of coherent qubit oscillations in the microwave frequency range. In planar Josephson resonators with oxide interfaces this absorption is characterized by an anomalously weak loss tangent dependence on the field in the non-linear regime that conflicts with the theoretical expectations and the observations in amorphous dielectrics. It was recently suggested that this anomalous absorption is due to TLS dynamic interactions. Here we show that such interactions cannot lead to the observed loss-tangent field dependence and suggest the alternative explanation assuming that TLS dipole moments $p$ are distributed according to the specific power law $P(p) \propto 1/p^{3-\eta}$ ($0\leq \eta <1$). This assumption, indeed, results in the observed loss tangent behavior. The hypothesis of a power law distribution is supported both by the recent measurements of individual TLS dipole moments and the theoretical model of TLS formation due to the long-range dipole-dipole interaction, thus connecting the anomalous absorption with the possible solution of the long-standing problem of the nature of TLSs.

Title: Classical representation of the dynamics of quantum spin chains
Authors: Tony Jin
Abstract: Since the advent of quantum mechanics, classical probability interpretations have faced significant challenges. A notable issue arises with the emergence of negative probabilities when attempting to define the joint probability of non-commutative observables. In this work, we propose a resolution to this dilemma for quantum spin chains, by introducing an exact representation of their dynamics in terms of classical continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs). These CTMCs effectively model the creation, annihilation, and propagation of pairs of classical particles and antiparticles. The quantum dynamics then emerges by averaging over various realizations of this classical process.

Title: Interplay of superconducting, metallic, and crystalline states of composite fermions at $ν{=}1/6$ in wide quantum wells
Authors: Ajit C. Balram, Anirban Sharma, J. K. Jain
Abstract: Evidence for developing fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) at filling fraction $\nu{=}1/6$ and $1/8$ has recently been reported in wide GaAs quantum wells [Wang \emph{et al.}, PRL {\bf 134}, 046502 (2025)]. In this article, we theoretically investigate the nature of the state at $\nu{=}1/6$ as a function of the quantum well width and the density by considering composite-fermion (CF) crystals, CF Fermi sea, and various kinds of paired CF states. The $f$-wave paired state has the lowest energy among the paired CF states. However, for parameters of interest, the energies of the CF crystal, the CF Fermi liquid, and the $f$-wave paired CF state are too close to call. We, therefore, predict that {\it if} the FQHE at $\nu{=}1/6$ is experimentally confirmed, this state would be an $f$-wave paired state of CFs, which can be verified by measurement of its thermal Hall conductance. Exact diagonalization studies for systems with up to 8 electrons show that the ground states at $\nu{=}n/(6n{\pm} 1)$ are incompressible for all widths and densities we have considered and well described by the corresponding Laughlin and Jain states. We propose a phase diagram for large quantum well widths and densities in which at zero disorder, incompressible FQHE states are stabilized at $\nu{=}n/(6n{\pm} 1)$ and $\nu{=}1/6$, but in between these fillings the CF crystal is stabilized. With disorder, which creates a spatial variation in the filling factor, two regimes are identified: (i) for small disorder, when the incompressible states percolate at the special fillings, FQHE with quantized Hall plateaus and vanishing longitudinal resistance should occur; and (ii) for larger disorder, when the CF crystal percolates, the longitudinal resistance rises with decreasing temperature but the domains of FQHE liquid produce minima at the special filling factors. The experiments are consistent with the latter scenario.

Title: Stochastically bistable growth and decay in the Togashi-Kaneko model
Authors: Jeremy R. Worsfold, Richard G. Morris
Abstract: The two-state Togashi-Kaneko model demonstrates how, at finite system sizes, autocatalysis can lead to noise-induced bistability between the cellular concentrations of different molecular species. Here, we show that, in the biologically relevant scenario of species-dependent export rates, the nascent stochastic switching between molecular species also drives a concomitant switching between periods of growth or decay in the total population size. We demonstrate this behavior using stochastic simulations as well as the numerical integration of a Fokker-Planck equation that approximates the finite system-size limit. By combining piecewise-deterministic-Markov and linear-noise approximations, we further find analytic expressions for the stationary distributions of the different molecular species when stochastic switching is faster than the dynamics in the total population size. We envisage that other models in the voter class -- including spin systems, flocking and opinion dynamics -- may also exhibit aperiodic growth and decay in population size, as well as be amenable to similar techniques.

Title: Bosonized one-dimensional quantum systems through enhanced event-chain Monte Carlo
Authors: Oscar Bouverot-Dupuis, Alberto Rosso, Manon Michel
Abstract: We design an enhanced Event-Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to study 1D quantum dissipative systems, using their bosonized representation. Expressing the bosonized Hamiltonian as a path integral over a scalar field enables the application of Monte Carlo algorithms developed for classical systems. Specifically, we focus on a dissipative XXZ spin chain, exhibiting critical slowing down, minima degeneracy and long-range interactions. Addressing all three bottlenecks, we design an algorithm that combines local persistent Event-Chain Monte Carlo moves with global cluster moves, in a O(1)-complexity implementation. Through systematic performance analysis, we show that such an algorithm outperforms traditional Metropolis algorithms by more than a magnitude factor and is competitive with current state-of-the-art Quantum Monte Carlo algorithms. We then use this approach to determine the dissipative spin chain's phase diagram, thereby reinforcing prior analytical predictions.

Title: Spinor ice correlation in flat-band electronic states on kagome and pyrochlore lattices with spin-orbit coupling
Authors: Hiroki Nakai, Masafumi Udagawa, Chisa Hotta
Abstract: We investigate the emergence and transformation of pinch-point singularities in the excitation spectrum of electronic flat band systems on kagome and pyrochlore lattices with spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and Coulomb interactions. While pinch points are widely recognized as signatures of classical spin liquids, they also appear in electronic flat-band systems when there exists a singular band-touching point to dispersive bands. We explore how SOC modifies the pinch-point structure in the chiral spin flat-band metallic state, which we term spinor-ice. The pinch point profile can rotate or redistribute its spectral weight, governed by a prefactor in the spectral function that primarily depends on the direction of the ground-state spin polarization, where we show that SOC flat bands could be experimentally probed by rotating the spin polarization of the injected electron to infer internal magnetic structures. These observations are discussed in conjunction with the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and the application to the potential SOC flat-band material $\rm CsW_2O_6$. We also demonstrate the persistent residual pinch-point features under Coulomb interactions and deviations from the ideal flat-band limit.

Title: Exactly solvable diffusions from space-time transformations
Authors: Costantino Di Bello, Édgar Roldán, Ralf Metzler
Abstract: We consider a general one-dimensional overdamped diffusion model described by the Itô stochastic differential equation (SDE) ${dX_t=\mu(X_t,t)dt+\sigma(X_t,t)dW_t}$, where $W_t$ is the standard Wiener process. We obtain a specific condition that $\mu$ and $\sigma$ must fulfil in order to be able to solve the SDE via mapping the generic process, using a suitable space-time transformation, onto the simpler Wiener process. By taking advantage of this transformation, we obtain the propagator in the case of open, reflecting, and absorbing \emph{time-dependent\/} boundary conditions for a large class of diffusion processes. In particular, this allows us to derive the first-passage time statistics of such a large class of models, some of which were so far unknown. While our results are valid for a wide range of non-autonomous, non-linear and non-homogeneous processes, we illustrate applications in stochastic thermodynamics by focusing on the propagator and first-passage-time statistics of isoentropic processes that were previously realized in the laboratory with Brownian particles trapped with optical tweezers.

Title: Subleading-order theory for condensation transitions in large deviations of sums of independent and identically distributed random variables
Authors: Naftali R. Smith
Abstract: We study the full distribution $P_{N}\left(A\right)$ of sums $A = \sum_{i=1}^N$ where $x_1, \dots, x_N$ are $N \gg 1$ independent and identically distributed random variables each sampled from a given distribution $p(x)$ with a subexponential $x \to \infty$ tail. We consider two particular cases: (I) the one-sided stretched exponential distribution $p(x) \propto e^{-x^\alpha}$ where $0 < x < \infty$, (II) the two-sided stretched exponential distribution $p(x) \propto e^{-|x|^\alpha}$ where $-\infty < x < \infty$. We assume $0 < \alpha < 1$ (in both cases). As follows immediately from known theorems, for both cases (i) typical fluctuations of $\Delta A = A - \left\langle A\right\rangle $ are described by the central-limit theorem, (ii) the tail $A \to \infty$ is described by the big-jump principle $P_{N}\left(A\right) \simeq N p\left(A\right)$, and (iii) in between these two regimes there is a nontrivial intermediate regime which displays anomalous scaling $P_{N}\left(A\right) \sim e^{-N^\beta f(\Delta A/N^\gamma)}$ with anomalous exponents $\beta,\gamma \in (0,1)$ and large-deviation function $f(y)$ that are all exactly known. In practice, although these theoretical predictions of $P_{N}\left(A\right)$ work very well in regimes (i) and (ii), they often perform quite poorly in the intermediate regime (ii), with errors of several orders of magnitude for $N$ as large as $10^4$. We calculate subleading order corrections to the theoretical predictions in the intermediate regime. We find that for $0 < \alpha < \alpha_c$, these corrections scale as power laws in $N$, while for $\alpha_c < \alpha < 1$ they scale as stretched exponentials, where the threshold value is $\alpha_c = 1/2$ in case (I) and $\alpha_c = 2/3$ in case (II). This difference between the two cases is a result of the mirror symmetry $p(x) = p(-x)$ which holds only in the latter case.

Title: Forces and symmetry breaking of a living meso-swimmer
Authors: Rafael A. Lara, N. Sharadhi, Anna A. L. Huttunen, Lotta Ansas, Ensio J. G. Rislakki, Guilherme M. Bessa, Matilda Backholm
Abstract: Swimming is ubiquitous in nature and crucial for the survival of a wide range of organisms. The physics of swimming at the viscosity-dominated microscale and inertia-dominated macroscale is well studied. However, in between lies a complicated mesoscale with swimmers affected by non-linear and time-dependent fluid mechanics. The intricate motility strategies and complex and periodically changing body shapes add extra challenges for accurate meso-swimming modelling. Here, we have further developed the micropipette force sensor to directly probe the swimming forces of the meso-organism Artemia. We present a universal scaling law for a wide range of micro- to meso-organisms with different body shapes, swimming strategies, and level of inertia at the mesoscale. Through deep neural network-based image analysis, we discover that Artemia achieves an increased propulsive force by increasing its level of time-reversal symmetry breaking. These results capture fundamental aspects of biological meso-swimming dynamics and provide guidance for future biomimicking meso-robot designs.

Title: Intertwined geometries in collective modes of two dimensional Dirac fermions
Authors: Ankan Biswas, Avraham Klein
Abstract: It is well known that the time-dependent response of a correlated system can be inferred from its spectral correlation functions. As a textbook example, the zero sound collective modes of a Fermi liquid appear as poles of its particle-hole susceptibilities. However, the Fermi liquid's interactions endow these response functions with a complex analytic structure, so that this time/frequency relationship is no longer straightforward. We study how the geometry of this structure is modified by a nontrivial band geometry, via a calculation of the zero sound spectrum of a Dirac cone in two dimensions. We find that the chiral wavefunctions, that encode the band geometry, fundamentally change the analytic structure of the response functions, which encode its Riemannian geometry. As a result, isotropic interactions can give rise to a variety of unconventional zero sound modes, that, due to the geometry of the functions in frequency space, can only be identified via time-resolved probes. These modes are absent in a conventional Fermi liquid with similar interactions, so that these modes can be used as a sensitive probe for the existence of Dirac points in a band-structure.

Title: Minimal mechanism for flocking in phoretically interacting active colloids
Authors: Arvin Gopal Subramaniam, Sagarika Adhikary, Rajesh Singh
Abstract: Collective motion as a flock is a widely observed phenomenon in active matter systems. Finding possible mechanisms of attaining a global polar order via dynamical mechanisms - without any explicit alignment interaction - is an area of active current research. We report a novel flocking transition mechanism in a system of chemically interacting active colloidal particles sustained purely by chemo-repulsive torques at low to medium densities. The basic requirements to maintain the polar liquid flock are excluded volume repulsions and deterministic long-ranged net repulsive torques. The mechanism we report requires that the time scale individual colloids move a unit length to be dominant with respect to the time they deterministically sense chemicals. This can be equivalently interpreted as pair colloids sliding a minimal unit length before deterministically rotating due to chemical interactions. Switching on the translational repulsive forces renders the flock a crystalline structure. We complement these results with an analysis of a continuum hydrodynamic model, with the transition corresponding to destabilization of the flocking state. Finally, we present simulations for flocking in an agent-based model consisting of local update rules of colloidal pairs that slide and rotate upon collision.

Title: Berry curvature-induced transport signature for altermagnetic order
Authors: T. Farajollahpour, R. Ganesh, K. V. Samokhin
Abstract: Altermagnetism has been detected in several materials using spin-sensitive probes. These measurements require rather complex setups that make it challenging to track variations in altermagnetic order, e.g., to identify a temperature-tuned altermagnetic phase transition. We propose a simple transport measurement that can probe the order parameter for $d$-wave altermagnetism. We suggest magnetoconductivity anisotropy -- the difference between the two principal values of the magnetoconductivity tensor. This quantity can be easily measured as a function of temperature, without any spin-selective apparatus. It acquires a nonzero value in a $C_4K$ phase, where $C_4$ rotations and time reversal $K$ are not symmetries but their combination is. This effect can be traced to the modification of phase space density due to Berry curvature, which we demonstrate using semiclassical equations of motion for band electrons. As an illustration, we build a minimal tight-binding model with altermagnetic order that breaks $C_4$ and $K$ symmetries while preserving $C_4K$.

Title: Hidden Bose-Einstein Singularities in Correlated Electron Systems: II. Pseudogap Phase in the Weakly Attractive Hubbard Model
Authors: Takafumi Kita
Abstract: The hidden Bose-Einstein singularities of correlated electron systems, whose possible existence has been pointed out in a previous paper based on quantum field theory of ordered phases [T. Kita, J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. {\bf 93}, 124704 (2024)], are studied in more detail in terms of the attractive Hubbard model, for which the mean-field theory predicts that spin-singlet superconductivity is realized at low enough temperatures for any band structure and interaction strength. It is shown that incorporating correlation effects should change the mean-field superconducting solution substantially and qualitatively even in the weak coupling, implying that the system lies in the strong-coupling region perturbatively. The hidden singularity is found to be present around the mean-field superconducting temperature $T_{{\rm c}0}$, below which the standard self-consistent treatment by quantum field theory cannot be used due to divergences in the zero Matsubara frequency branch obeying Bose-Einstein statistics. Our method to recover the applicability with a Lagrange multiplier predicts that the singularity is a physical entity signaling the threshold of a pseudogap phase with a characteristic V-shape structure in the density of states near zero energy, which lies above the superconducting phase and originates from the emerging one-particle-reducible structure in the self-energy.

Title: Superconducting gap structure and bosonic mode in La2PrNi2O7 thin films at ambient pressure
Authors: Shengtai Fan, Mengjun Ou, Marius Scholten, Qing Li, Zhiyuan Shang, Yi Wang, Jiasen Xu, Huan Yang, Ilya M. Eremin, Hai-Hu Wen
Abstract: The recent discovery of high temperature superconductivity in nickelate systems has generated tremendous interests in the field of superconductivity. The core issue to understand the superconductivity mechanism is about the superconducting gap and its symmetry. By using the substrate of SrLaAlO4(00l), we have successfully synthesized the superconducting thin film of La2PrNi2O7 with Tc(onset) = 41.5 K. Superconducting tunneling spectra are successfully measured on the terraces after we expose the superconducting layer by using the tip-excavation technique. The spectrum shows a two-gap structure with Delta1=19 meV, Delta2=6-8 meV, and fittings based on the Dynes model indicate that the dominant gap should have an anisotropic s-wave structure, this allows us to put the priority in selecting the s+- among the two arguable pairing models: s+- and d-wave. Furthermore, a clear bosonic mode with energy Omega=30+-2 meV is observed, which further supports a sign reversal gap. Our results shed new light in understanding the mystery of superconductivity in bilayer nickelate superconductors.

Title: Only the Ambidextrous Can Flock: Two-dimensional Chiral Malthusian Flocks, Time Cholesterics, and the KPZ Equation
Authors: Leiming Chen, Chiu Fan Lee, John Toner
Abstract: We study two-dimensional chiral dry Malthusian flocks; that is, chiral polar-ordered active matter with neither number nor momentum conservation. In the absence of fluctuations, these form a ``time cholesteric", in which the velocity rotates uniformly in time at a fixed frequency. Fluctuations are described by the (2+1)-Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation, which implies short-ranged orientational order. For weak chirality, the system is in the linear regime of the KPZ equation for a wide range of length scales, over which it exhibits quasi-long-ranged orientational order. Our predictions for velocity and density correlations are testable in both simulations and experiments.

Title: Embrittling bulk metals into hydride in acidic medium
Authors: Ankang Chen, Zihao Huo, Jiewen Liu, Chuang Liu, Yongming Sui, Xuan Liu, Qingkun Yuan, Bao Yuan, Yan Li, Defang Duan, Bo Zou
Abstract: Hydrogen embrittlement (HE), in which the hydrogen infiltrates metal lattices to form hydrides, typically causes catastrophic failure. Inspired by HE effects, we synthesized 18 high-purity metal hydrides (MgH2, ScH2, YH2, LaH2, LaH2.3, SmH2, LuH2, TiH2, {\delta}-ZrH1.6, {\epsilon}-ZrH2, HfH1.7, HfH2, VH0.8, VH2, NbH, NbH2, Ta2H, and TaH) , using bulk metal foils as precursors and sulfuric/oleic acid as hydrogen donors. Through high-pressure experiments and theoretical calculations, the physical critical pressure ({\Delta}Pph) and equivalent pressure ({\Delta}Peq) concept were introduced to elucidate the mechanisms of the synthesizing and stabilizing metal hydrides. Quantitative analysis of 18 metal hydrides establishes that the criterion |{\Delta}Peq| > {\Delta}Pph governs HE-driven hydride synthesis. Conversely, when |{\Delta}Peq| < {\Delta}Pph , hydrogen-induced brittle fracture initiates. This mechanism enables the synthesis of challenging hydrides (LiH) while concurrently explaining failure modes in metals such as Fe. Our approach successfully converts HE from a primary culprit of material failure to an effective contributor in hydride synthesis.

Title: Beyond one-loop: higher-order effects on Gross-Neveu-Yukawa tensorial criticality
Authors: SangEun Han, Igor F. Herbut
Abstract: We study the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa field theory for the SO($N$) symmetric traceless rank-two tensor order parameter coupled to Majorana fermions using the $\epsilon$-expansion around upper critical dimensions of $3+1$ to two loops. Previously we established in the one-loop calculation that the theory does not exhibit a critical fixed point for $N \geq 4$, but that nevertheless the stable fixed point inevitably emerges at a large number of fermion flavors $N_f$. For $N_f < N_{f,c1} \approx N/2$, no critical fixed point exists; for $N_{f,c1} < N_f < N_{f,c2}$, a real critical fixed point emerges from the complex plane but fails to satisfy the additional stability conditions necessary for a continuous phase transition; and finally only for $N_f > N_{f,c2} \approx N$, the fixed point satisfies the stability conditions as well. In the present work we compute the $O(\epsilon)$ (two-loop) corrections to the critical flavour numbers $N_{f,c1} $ and $N_{f,c2}$. Most importantly, we observe a sharp decrease in $N_{f,c2}$ from its one-loop value, which brings it closer to the point $N_f =1$ relevant to the standard Gross-Neveu model. Some three-loop results are also presented and discussed.

Title: Dissipation engineering of fermionic long-range order beyond Lindblad
Authors: Silvia Neri, François Damanet, Andrew J. Daley, Maria Luisa Chiofalo, Jorge Yago Malo
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of engineering dissipatively long-range order that is robust against heating in strongly interacting fermionic systems, relevant for atoms in cavity QED. It was previously shown [Tindall et al. this http URL. 123, 030603 (2019)] that it is possible to stabilize long-range order in a Hubbard model by exploiting a dissipative mechanism in the Lindblad limit, this latter being valid for spectrally unstructured baths. Here, we first show that this mechanism still holds when including additional spin-exchange interactions in the model, that is for the tUJ model. Moreover, by means of a Redfield approach that goes beyond the Lindblad case, we show how the stability of the engineered state depends crucially on properties of the bath spectral density and discuss the feasibility of those properties in an experiment.

Title: Floquet-Engineering Weyl Points and Linked Fermi Arcs from Straight Nodal Lines
Authors: Dongling Liu, Zheng-Yang Zhuang, Zhongbo Yan
Abstract: Floquet engineering provides a powerful and flexible method for modifying the band structures of quantum materials. While circularly polarized light has been shown to convert curved nodal lines in three-dimensional semimetals into Weyl points, such a transformation is forbidden for an isolated straight nodal line. In this work, we uncover a dramatic shift in this paradigm when multiple straight nodal lines intersect. We observe that circularly polarized light not only gaps them into Weyl points but also induces unprecedented surface-state Fermi arcs that extend across the entire surface Brillouin zone and form a linked topological structure. These findings advance our fundamental understanding of light-driven transitions in topological semimetals and unveil a unique Weyl semimetal phase defined by linked Fermi arcs. We discuss potential exotic phenomena arising from this phase, applications of our predictions to spin-splitting antiferromagnets, and the extension of this Weyl semimetal phase to classical systems.

Title: DFT-Guided Operando Raman Characterization of Ni-Based Phases Relevant to Electrochemical Systems
Authors: Harol Moreno Fernández, Siavash Karbasizadeh, Esmaeil Adabifiroozjaei, Leopoldo Molina-Luna, Jan P. Hofmann, Mohammad Amirabbasi
Abstract: We present a phase-resolved investigation of Ni-based oxides and hydroxides relevant to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), combining ground-state DFT+U calculations with operando and in situ Raman spectroscopy, supported by high-resolution TEM. Five crystalline phases-cubic and hexagonal NiO, monoclinic and trigonal Ni(OH)2, and NiOOH-are systematically characterized in terms of their vibrational and electronic structure. Although the DFT models are idealized (0 K, defect-free, no solvation), they serve as clean, phase-specific references for interpreting complex experimental spectra. Cubic NiO is confirmed to be dynamically and electronically stable, consistent with dominant Raman modes observed experimentally. Despite dynamic instabilities in phonon dispersions, hexagonal NiO is structurally verified via TEM, suggesting substrate- or defect-stabilized metastability. Ni(OH)2 polymorphs are both vibrationally stable semiconductors, with the trigonal phase exhibiting stronger spin polarization. NiOOH exhibits spin-polarized electronic states across the Brillouin zone, consistent with its asymmetric band structure under ferromagnetic ordering. Independently, phonon calculations reveal soft modes near the Gamma-point, indicating dynamic instability under idealized conditions, yet operando Raman spectra align closely with calculated zone-center modes. However, introducing 0.03 Angstrom symmetry-breaking displacements relaxes the NiOOH lattice off its saddle point, removing imaginary phonon modes and stabilizing the phase. This integrated framework demonstrates how idealized DFT can reveal intrinsic fingerprints that anchor the interpretation of vibrational and electronic responses in catalytically active, dynamically evolving Ni-based materials.

Title: Machine Learning Study of the Surface Reconstructions of Cu$_{2}$O(111) Surface
Authors: Payal Wadhwa, Michael Schmid, Georg Kresse
Abstract: The atomic structure of the most stable reconstructed surface of cuprous oxide (Cu$_{2}$O)(111) surface has been a longstanding topic of debate. In this study, we develop on-the-fly machine-learned force fields (MLFFs) to systematically investigate the various reconstructions of the Cu$_{2}$O(111) surface under stoichiometric as well as O- and Cu-deficient or rich conditions, focusing on both ($\sqrt{3}$$\times$$\sqrt{3}$)R30° and (2$\times$2) supercells. By utilizing parallel tempering simulations supported by MLFFs, we confirm that the previously described nanopyramidal and Cu-deficient (1$\times$1) structures are the lowest energy structures from moderately to strong oxidizing conditions. In addition, we identify two promising nanopyramidal reconstructions at highly reducing conditions, a stoichiometric and a Cu-rich one. Surface energy calculations performed using spin-polarized PBE, PBE+U, r$^{2}$SCAN, and HSE06 functionals show that the previously known Cu-deficient configuration and nanopyramidal configurations are at the convex hull (and, thus, equilibrium structures) for all functionals, whereas the stability of the other structures depends on the functional and is therefore uncertain. Our findings demonstrate that on-the-fly trained MLFFs provide a simple, efficient, and rapid approach to explore the complex surface reconstructions commonly encountered in experimental studies, and also enhance our understanding of the stability of Cu$_{2}$O(111) surfaces.

Title: Particle-scale origin of quadrupolar non-affine displacement fields in granular solids
Authors: Evan P. Willmarth, Weiwei Jin, Dong Wang, Amit Datye, Udo D. Schwarz, Mark D. Shattuck, Corey S. O'Hern
Abstract: In this work, we identify the local structural defects that control the non-affine displacement fields in jammed disk packings subjected to athermal, quasistatic (AQS) simple shear. While complex non-affine displacement fields typically occur during simple shear, isolated effective quadrupoles are also observed and their probability increases with increasing pressure. We show that the emergence of an isolated effective quadrupole requires the breaking of an interparticle contact that is aligned with low-frequency, spatially extended vibrational modes. Since the Eshelby inhomogeneity problem gives rise to quadrupolar displacement fields in continuum materials, we reformulate and implement Eshelby's equivalent inclusion method (EIM) for jammed disk packings. Using EIM, we show that we can reconstruct the non-affine displacement fields for jammed disk packings in response to applied shear as a sum of discrete Eshelby-like defects that are caused by mismatches in the local stiffnesses of triangles formed from Delaunay triangulation of the disk centers.

Title: Nambu-Covariant Many-Body Theory I: Perturbative Approximations
Authors: M. Drissi, A. Rios, C. Barbieri
Abstract: Symmetry-breaking considerations play an important role in allowing reliable and accurate predictions of complex systems in quantum many-body simulations. The general theory of perturbations in symmetry-breaking phases is nonetheless intrinsically more involved than in the unbroken phase due to non-vanishing anomalous Green's functions or anomalous quasiparticle interactions. In the present paper, we develop a formulation of many-body theory at non-zero temperature which is explicitly covariant with respect to a group containing Bogoliubov transformations. Based on the concept of Nambu tensors, we derive a factorisation of standard Feynman diagrams that is valid for a general Hamiltonian. The resulting factorised amplitudes are indexed over the set of un-oriented Feynman diagrams with fully antisymmetric vertices. We argue that, within this framework, the design of symmetry-breaking many-body approximations is simplified.

Title: Nambu-Covariant Many-Body Theory II: Self-Consistent Approximations
Authors: M. Drissi, A. Rios, C. Barbieri
Abstract: The theory of Self-Consistent Green's Function (SCGF) is reformulated in an explicit Nambu-covariant fashion for applications to many-body systems at non-zero temperature in symmetry-broken phases. This is achieved by extending the Nambu-covariant formulation of perturbation theory, presented in the first part of this work, to non-perturbative schemes based on self-consistently dressed propagators and vertices. We work out in detail the self-consistent ladder approximation, motivated by a trade-off between numerical complexity and many-body phenomenology. Taking a complex general Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) propagator as a starting point, we also formulate and prove a sufficient condition on the stability of the HFB self-energy to ensure the convergence of the initial series of ladders at any energy. The self-consistent ladder approximation is written purely in terms of spectral functions and the resulting set of equations, when expressed in terms of Nambu tensors, are remarkably similar to those in the symmetry-conserving case. This puts the application of the self-consistent ladder approximation to symmetry-broken phases of infinite nuclear matter within reach.

Title: Free energy in multi-species mixed $p$-spin spherical models
Authors: Erik Bates, Youngtak Sohn
Abstract: We prove a Parisi formula for the limiting free energy of multi-species spherical spin glasses with mixed $p$-spin interactions. The upper bound involves a Guerra-style interpolation and requires a convexity assumption on the model's covariance function. Meanwhile, the lower bound adapts the cavity method of Chen so that it can be combined with the synchronization technique of Panchenko; this part requires no convexity assumption. In order to guarantee that the resulting Parisi formula has a minimizer, we formalize the pairing of synchronization maps with overlap measures so that the constraint set is a compact metric space. This space is not related to the model's spherical structure and can be carried over to other multi-species settings.

Title: Crisanti-Sommers formula and simultaneous symmetry breaking in multi-species spherical spin glasses
Authors: Erik Bates, Youngtak Sohn
Abstract: There is a rich history of expressing the limiting free energy of mean-field spin glasses as a variational formula over probability measures on $[0,1]$, where the measure represents the similarity (or "overlap") of two independently sampled spin configurations. At high temperatures, the formula's minimum is achieved at a measure which is a point mass, meaning sample configurations are asymptotically orthogonal up to a magnetic field correction. At low temperatures, though, a very different behavior emerges known as replica symmetry breaking (RSB). The deep wells in the energy landscape create more rigid structure, and the optimal overlap measure is no longer a point mass. The exact size of its support remains in many cases an open problem. Here we consider these themes for multi-species spherical spin glasses. Following a companion work in which we establish the Parisi variational formula, here we present this formula's Crisanti-Sommers representation. In the process, we gain new access to a problem unique to the multi-species setting. Namely, if RSB occurs for one species, does it necessarily occur for other species as well? We provide sufficient conditions for the answer to be yes. For instance, we show that if two species share any quadratic interaction, then RSB for one implies RSB for the other. Moreover, the level of symmetry breaking must be identical, even in cases of full RSB. In the presence of an external field, any type of interaction suffices.

Title: Large Deviations Theory of Increasing Returns
Authors: Simone Franchini, Riccardo Balzan
Abstract: An influential theory of increasing returns has been proposed by the economist W. B. Arthur in the '80s to explain the lock-in phenomenon between two competing commercial products. In the most simplified situation there are two competing products that gain customers according to a majority mechanism: each new customer arrives and asks which product they bought to a certain odd number of previous customers, and then buy the most shared product within this sample. It is known that one of these two companies reaches monopoly almost surely in the limit of infinite customers. Here we consider a generalization [G. Dosi, Y. Ermoliev, Y. Kaniovsky, J. Math. Econom. 23, 1-19 (1994)] where the new customer follows the indication of the sample with some probability, and buy the other product otherwise. Other than economy, this model can be reduced to the urn of Hill, Lane and Sudderth, and includes several models of physical interest as special cases, like the Elephant Random Walk, the Friedman's urn and other generalized urn models. We provide a large deviation analysis of this model at the sample-path level, and give a formula that allows to find the most likely trajectories followed by the market share variable. Interestingly, in the parameter range where the lock-in phase is expected, we observe a whole region of convergence where the entropy cost is sub-linear. We also find a non-linear differential equation for the cumulant generating function of the market share variable, that can be studied with a suitable perturbations theory.

Title: Mott's law for the v.r.h. random resistor network and for Mott's random walk
Authors: Alessandra Faggionato
Abstract: Mott's variable range hopping (v.r.h.) is the phonon-induced hopping of electrons in disordered solids (such as doped semiconductors) within the regime of strong Anderson localization. It was introduced by N.~Mott to explain the anomalous low temperature conductivity decay in dimension $d\geq 2$, corresponding now to the so called Mott's law. We provide a rigorous derivation of this Physics law for two effective models of Mott v.r.h.: the random resistor network for v.r.h. of \cite[Section~IV]{AHL} and Mott's random walk. We also determine the constant multiplying the power of the inverse temperature in the exponent in Mott's law, which was an open problem also on a heuristic level.

Title: Neuromorphic weighted sums with magnetic skyrmions
Authors: Tristan da Câmara Santa Clara Gomes, Yanis Sassi, Dédalo Sanz-Hernández, Sachin Krishnia, Sophie Collin, Marie-Blandine Martin, Pierre Seneor, Vincent Cros, Julie Grollier, Nicolas Reyren
Abstract: Integrating magnetic skyrmions into neuromorphic computing could help improve hardware efficiency and computational power. However, developing a scalable implementation of the weighted sum of neuron signals - a core operation in neural networks - has remained a challenge. Here, we show that weighted sum operations can be performed in a compact, biologically-inspired manner by using the non-volatile and particle-like characteristics of magnetic skyrmions that make them easily countable and summable. The skyrmions are electrically generated in numbers proportional to an input with an efficiency given by a non-volatile weight. The chiral particles are then directed using localized current injections to a location where their presence is quantified through non-perturbative electrical measurements. Our experimental demonstration, which currently has two inputs, can be scaled to accommodate multiple inputs and outputs using a crossbar array design, potentially nearing the energy efficiency observed in biological systems.

Title: Quantum Enhanced Sensitivity through Many-Body Bloch Oscillations
Authors: Hassan Manshouri, Moslem Zarei, Mehdi Abdi, Sougato Bose, Abolfazl Bayat
Abstract: We investigate the sensing capacity of non-equilibrium dynamics in quantum systems exhibiting Bloch oscillations. By focusing on the resource efficiency of the probe, quantified by quantum Fisher information, we find different scaling behaviors in two different phases, namely localized and extended. Our results provide a quantitative ansatz for quantum Fisher information in terms of time, probe size, and the number of excitations. In the long-time regime, the quantum Fisher information is a quadratic function of time, touching the Heisenberg limit. The system size scaling drastically depends on the phase changing from quantum-enhanced scaling in the extended phase to size-independent behavior in the localized phase. Furthermore, increasing the number of excitations always enhances the precision of the probe, although, in the interacting systems the enhancement becomes less eminent than the non-interacting probes. This is due to the induced localization by increasing the interaction between the excitations. We show that a simple particle configuration measurement together with a maximum likelihood estimation can closely reach the ultimate precision limit in both single- and multi-particle probes.

Title: The Structure of the Majorana Clifford Group
Authors: Valérie Bettaque, Brian Swingle
Abstract: In quantum information science, Clifford operators and stabilizer codes play a central role for systems of qubits (or qudits). In this paper, we study their analogues for systems composed of Majorana fermions. In this case, a crucial role is played by fermion parity symmetry, which is an unbreakable symmetry present in any system with fundamentally fermionic degrees of freedom. We prove that the subgroup of parity-preserving Majorana Cliffords can be represented by the orthogonal group over the binary field $\F$, and we show how it can be generated by braiding operators and used to construct any (even-parity) Majorana stabilizer code. We also analyze the frame potential for this so-called p-Clifford group when acting on a fixed-parity sector of the Hilbert space, proving that it is equivalent to the frame potential of the ordinary Clifford group acting on the same sector.

Title: Universal thermalization dynamics in (1+1)d QFTs
Authors: Richard A. Davison, Luca V. Delacretaz
Abstract: We identify the universal mechanism behind the thermalization of (1+1)d QFTs at high and low temperatures. Viewing these theories as CFTs perturbed by relevant or irrelevant deformations, we show that conformal perturbation theory in the thermal state breaks down at late times allowing for the emergence of hydrodynamics. This breakdown occurs universally due to the unsuppressed exchange of stress tensors near the lightcone. Furthermore, for theories with central charge $c\rightarrow\infty$ we solve for the emergent hydrodynamic theory to all orders in the gradient expansion by arguing that all transport parameters appearing in two-point functions have universal expressions in terms of the scaling dimension $\Delta$ of the perturbation. The radius of convergence of the hydrodynamic dispersion relations provides an early time cutoff for hydrodynamics, which agrees with the time scale at which conformal perturbation theory breaks down.

Title: Quantum jumps in amplitude bistability: tracking a coherent and invertible state localization
Authors: Th. K. Mavrogordatos
Abstract: We investigate the nature of quantum jumps occurring between macroscopic metastable states of light in the open driven Jaynes-Cummings model. We find that, in the limit of zero spontaneous emission considered in [H. J. Carmichael, Phys. Rev. X 5, 031028 (2015)], the jumps from a high-photon state to the vacuum state entail two stages. The first part is coherent and modelled by the localization of a state superposition, in the example of a null-measurement record predicted by quantum trajectory theory. The underlying evolution is mediated by an unstable state (which often splits to a complex of states), identified by the conditioned density matrix and the corresponding quasiprobability distribution of the cavity field. The unstable state subsequently decays to the vacuum to complete the jump. Coherence in the localization allows for inverting the null-measurement photon average about its initial value, to account for the full switch which typically lasts a small fraction of the cavity lifetime. This mechanism is contrasted to the jumps leading from the vacuum to the high-photon state in the bistable signal. Spontaneous emission degrades coherence in the localization, and prolongs the jumps.

Title: Adsorb-Agent: Autonomous Identification of Stable Adsorption Configurations via Large Language Model Agent
Authors: Janghoon Ock, Radheesh Sharma Meda, Tirtha Vinchurkar, Yayati Jadhav, Amir Barati Farimani
Abstract: Adsorption energy is a key reactivity descriptor in catalysis. Determining adsorption energy requires evaluating numerous adsorbate-catalyst configurations, making it computationally intensive. Current methods rely on exhaustive sampling, which does not guarantee the identification of the global minimum energy. To address this, we introduce Adsorb-Agent, a Large Language Model (LLM) agent designed to efficiently identify stable adsorption configurations corresponding to the global minimum energy. Adsorb-Agent leverages its built-in knowledge and reasoning to strategically explore configurations, significantly reducing the number of initial setups required while improving energy prediction accuracy. In this study, we also evaluated the performance of different LLMs, including GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, and DeepSeek-Chat, as the reasoning engine for Adsorb-Agent, with GPT-4o showing the strongest overall performance. Tested on twenty diverse systems, Adsorb-Agent identifies comparable adsorption energies for 84% of cases and achieves lower energies for 35%, particularly excelling in complex systems. It identifies lower energies in 47% of intermetallic systems and 67% of systems with large adsorbates. These findings demonstrate Adsorb-Agent's potential to accelerate catalyst discovery by reducing computational costs and enhancing prediction reliability compared to exhaustive search methods.

Title: Fast, accurate, and error-resilient variational quantum noise spectroscopy
Authors: Nanako Shitara, Andrés Montoya-Castillo
Abstract: Detecting and characterizing decoherence-inducing noise sources is critical for developing robust quantum technologies and deploying quantum sensors operating at molecular scales. However, current noise spectroscopies rely on severe approximations that sacrifice accuracy and precision. We propose a novel approach to overcome these limitations. It self-consistently extracts noise spectra that characterize the interactions between a quantum sensor and its environment from commonly performed dynamical decoupling-based coherence measurements. Our approach adopts minimal assumptions and is resilient to measurement errors. We quantify confidence intervals and sensitivity measures to identify experiments that improve spectral reconstruction. We employ our method to reconstruct the noise spectrum of a nitrogen-vacancy sensor in diamond, resolving previously undetected nuclear species at the diamond surface and revealing that previous measurements had overestimated the strength of low-frequency noise by an order of magnitude. Our method uncovers previously hidden structure with unprecedented accuracy, setting the stage for precision noise spectroscopy-based quantum metrology.

Title: Entanglement asymmetry in periodically driven quantum systems
Authors: Tista Banerjee, Suchetan Das, K. Sengupta
Abstract: We study the dynamics of entanglement asymmetry in periodically driven quantum systems. Using a periodically driven XY chain as a model for a driven integrable quantum system, we provide semi-analytic results for the behavior of the dynamics of the entanglement asymmetry, $\Delta S$, as a function of the drive frequency. Our analysis identifies special drive frequencies at which the driven XY chain exhibits dynamic symmetry restoration and displays quantum Mpemba effect over a long timescale; we identify an emergent approximate symmetry in its Floquet Hamiltonian which plays a crucial role for realization of both these phenomena. We follow these results by numerical computation of $\Delta S$ for the non-integrable driven Rydberg atom chain and obtain similar emergent-symmetry-induced symmetry restoration and quantum Mpemba effect in the prethermal regime for such a system. Finally, we provide an exact analytic computation of the entanglement asymmetry for a periodically driven conformal field theory (CFT) on a strip. Such a driven CFT, depending on the drive amplitude and frequency, exhibits two distinct phases, heating and non-heating, that are separated by a critical line. Our results show that for $m$ cycles of a periodic drive with time period $T$, $\Delta S \sim \ln mT$ [$\ln (\ln mT)$] in the heating phase [on the critical line] for a generic CFT; in contrast, in the non-heating phase, $\Delta S$ displays small amplitude oscillations around it's initial value as a function of $mT$. We provide a phase diagram for the behavior of $\Delta S$ for such driven CFTs as a function of the drive frequency and amplitude.

Title: A high optical access cryogenic system for Rydberg atom arrays with a 3000-second trap lifetime
Authors: Zhenpu Zhang, Ting-Wei Hsu, Ting You Tan, Daniel H. Slichter, Adam M. Kaufman, Matteo Marinelli, Cindy A. Regal
Abstract: We present an optical tweezer array of $^{87}$Rb atoms housed in an cryogenic environment that successfully combines a 4 K cryopumping surface, a <50 K cold box surrounding the atoms, and a room-temperature high-numerical-aperture objective lens. We demonstrate a 3000 s atom trap lifetime, which enables us to optimize and measure losses at the $10^{-4}$ level that arise during imaging and cooling, which are important to array rearrangement. We perform both ground-state qubit manipulation with an integrated microwave antenna and two-photon coherent Rydberg control, with the local electric field tuned to zero via integrated electrodes. We anticipate that the reduced blackbody radiation at the atoms from the cryogenic environment, combined with future electrical shielding, should decrease the rate of undesired transitions to nearby strongly-interacting Rydberg states, which cause many-body loss and impede Rydberg gates. This low-vibration, high-optical-access cryogenic platform can be used with a wide range of optically trapped atomic or molecular species for applications in quantum computing, simulation, and metrology.

Title: Motion and hydrodynamic resistance of an elastic bead confined in a square microchannel
Authors: Charles Paul Moore, Hiba Belkadi, Brouna Safi, Gabriel Amselem, Charles N. Baroud
Abstract: Cells and other soft particles are often forced to flow in confined geometries in both laboratory and natural environments, where the elastic deformation induces an additional drag and pressure drop across the particle. In contrast with other multiphase flows, the physical parameters that determine this additional pressure are still not known. Here we start by measuring the pressure drop across a single spherical hydrogel particle as it flows in a microfluidic comparator. This pressure is found to depend on the amount of confinement, elastic modulus, fluid viscosity and velocity. A model for the force balance on the particle is then proposed, by incorporating the above ingredients and relying on simulations of bead geometry and lubrication flow considerations. The final model collapses the force measurements forces onto a single scaling law spanning several decades, while providing physical insights by recalling elements from classic multiphase flows and contact mechanics.

Title: Decoherence of Schrödinger cat states in light of wave/particle duality
Authors: Th. K. Mavrogordatos
Abstract: We challenge the standard picture of decohering Schrödinger cat states as an ensemble average obeying a Lindblad master equation, brought about locally from an irreversible interaction with an environment. We generate self-consistent collections of pure system states correlated with specific environmental records, corresponding to the function of the wave-particle correlator first introduced in Carmichael {\it et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. 85, 1855 (2000)]. In the spirit of Carmichael {\it et al.} [Coherent States: Past, Present and Future, pp. 75--91, World Scientific (1994)], we find that the complementary unravelings evince a pronounced disparity when the ``position'' and ``momentum'' of the damped cavity mode -- an explicitly open quantum system -- are measured. Intensity-field correlations may largely deviate from a monotonic decay, while Wigner functions of the cavity state display contrasting manifestations of quantum interference when conditioned on photon counts sampling a continuous photocurrent. In turn, the conditional photodetection events mark the contextual diffusion of both the net charge generated at the homodyne detector, and the electromagnetic field amplitude in the resonator.

Title: Scalable Discrete Diffusion Samplers: Combinatorial Optimization and Statistical Physics
Authors: Sebastian Sanokowski, Wilhelm Berghammer, Martin Ennemoser, Haoyu Peter Wang, Sepp Hochreiter, Sebastian Lehner
Abstract: Learning to sample from complex unnormalized distributions over discrete domains emerged as a promising research direction with applications in statistical physics, variational inference, and combinatorial optimization. Recent work has demonstrated the potential of diffusion models in this domain. However, existing methods face limitations in memory scaling and thus the number of attainable diffusion steps since they require backpropagation through the entire generative process. To overcome these limitations we introduce two novel training methods for discrete diffusion samplers, one grounded in the policy gradient theorem and the other one leveraging Self-Normalized Neural Importance Sampling (SN-NIS). These methods yield memory-efficient training and achieve state-of-the-art results in unsupervised combinatorial optimization. Numerous scientific applications additionally require the ability of unbiased sampling. We introduce adaptations of SN-NIS and Neural Markov Chain Monte Carlo that enable for the first time the application of discrete diffusion models to this problem. We validate our methods on Ising model benchmarks and find that they outperform popular autoregressive approaches. Our work opens new avenues for applying diffusion models to a wide range of scientific applications in discrete domains that were hitherto restricted to exact likelihood models.

Title: Multipartite Entanglement Structure of Fibered Link States
Authors: Vijay Balasubramanian, Charlie Cummings
Abstract: We study the patterns of multipartite entanglement in Chern-Simons theory with compact simple gauge group $G$ and level $k$ for states defined by the path integral on ``link complements'', i.e., compact manifolds whose boundaries consist of $n$ topologically linked tori. We focus on link complements which can be described topologically as fibrations over a Seifert surface. We show that the entanglement structure of such fibered link complement states is controlled by a topological invariant, the monodromy of the fibration. Thus, the entanglement structure of a Chern-Simons link state is not simply a function of the link, but also of the background manifold in which the link is embedded. In particular, we show that any link possesses an embedding into some background that leads to Greenberger--Horne--Zeilinger state (GHZ)-like entanglement. Furthermore, we demonstrate that all fibered links with periodic monodromy have GHZ-like entanglement, i.e., a partial trace on any link component produces a separable state. These results generalize to any three dimensional topological field theory with a dual chiral rational conformal field theory.

Title: Study of double kicked top: a classical and quantum perspective
Authors: Avadhut V. Purohit, Udaysinh T. Bhosale
Abstract: We study the double kicked top (DKT), which is an extension of the standard quantum kicked top (QKT) model. The model allows us to study the transition from time-reversal symmetric to broken time-reversal symmetric dynamics. Our transformation in the kick strength parameter space $(k, k') \to (k_r, k_\theta)$ reveals interesting features. The transformed kicked strength parameter $k_r$ drives a higher growth of chaos and is equivalent to the standard QKT, whereas the other transformed kicked strength parameter $k_\theta$ leads to a weaker growth. We discuss the fixed points, their stability, and verify results obtained by computing the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE) and the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy (KSE). We exactly solve 2- to 4-qubit versions of DKT by obtaining its eigenvalues, eigenvectors and the entanglement dynamics. Furthermore, we find the criteria for periodicity of the entanglement dynamics. We investigate measures of quantum correlations from two perspectives: the deep quantum and the semi-classical regime. Signatures of phase-space structure are numerically shown in the long-time averages of the quantum correlations. Our model can be realised experimentally as an extension of the standard QKT.

Title: Probing the Topological Anderson Transition in Quasiperiodic Photonic Lattices via Chiral Displacement and Wavelength Tuning
Authors: Abhinav Sinha, Trideb Shit, Avinash Tetarwal, Diptiman Sen, Sebabrata Mukherjee
Abstract: The interplay of topology and disorder in quantum dynamics has recently attracted significant attention across diverse platforms, including solid-state devices, ultracold atoms, and photonic systems. Here, we report on a topological Anderson transition caused by quasiperiodic modulation of the stronger intra-cell couplings in photonic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattices. As the quasiperiodic strength is varied, the system exhibits a reentrant transition from a trivial phase to a topological phase and back to a trivial phase, accompanied by the closing and reopening of the band gap around zero energy. Unlike the traditional detection of photonic topological edge modes, we measure the mean chiral displacement from the transport of light in the bulk of the lattices. In our photonic lattices with a fixed length, the propagation dynamics is retrieved by varying the wavelength of light, which tunes the inter-waveguide couplings.

Title: Controlled bit-flip of period-doubling and discrete time crystalline states in open systems
Authors: Roy D. Jara Jr., Phatthamon Kongkhambut, Hans Keßler, Andreas Hemmerich, Jayson G. Cosme
Abstract: In this work, we explore the robustness of a bit-flip operation against thermal and quantum noise for bits represented by the symmetry-broken pairs of the period-doubled (PD) states in a classical parametric oscillator and discrete time crystal (DTC) states in a fully-connected open spin-cavity system, respectively. The bit-flip operation corresponds to switching between the two PD and DTC states induced by a defect in a periodic drive, introduced in a controlled manner by linearly ramping the phase of the modulation of the drive. In the absence of stochastic noise, strong dissipation results in a more robust bit-flip operation in which slight changes to the defect parameters do not significantly lower the success rate of bit-flips. The operation remains robust even in the presence of stochastic noise when the defect duration is sufficiently large. The fluctuations also enhance the success rate of the bit-flip below the critical defect duration needed to induce a switch. By considering parameter regimes in which the DTC states in the spin-cavity system do not directly map to the PD states, we reveal that this robustness is due to the system being quenched by the defect towards a new phase that has enough excitation to suppress the effects of the stochastic noise. This allows for precise control of the bit-flip operations by tuning into the preferred intermediate state that the system will enter during a bit-flip operation. We demonstrate this in a modified protocol based on precise quenches of the driving frequency.

Title: Frustration, dynamics and catalysis
Authors: R. Gonzalo Parra, Diego U. Ferreiro
Abstract: The controlled dissipation of chemical potentials is the fundamental way cells make a living. Enzyme-mediated catalysis allows the various transformations to proceed at biologically relevant rates with remarkable precision and efficiency. Theory, experiments and computational studies coincide to show that local frustration is a useful concept to relate protein dynamics with catalytic power. Local frustration gives rise to the asperities of the energy landscapes that can harness the thermal fluctuations to guide the functional protein motions. We review here recent advances into these relationships from various fields of protein science. The biologically relevant dynamics is tuned by the evolution of protein sequences that modulate the local frustration patterns to near optimal values.
