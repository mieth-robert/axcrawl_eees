Title: A comprehensive semi-automated fabrication system for quartz tuning fork AFM probe with real-time resonance frequency monitoring and Q-factor control
Authors: Hankyul Koh, Joon-Hyuk Ko, Wonho Jhe
Abstract: Quartz tuning fork-based atomic force microscopy (QTF-AFM) has become a powerful tool for high-resolution imaging of both conductive and insulating samples, including semiconductor structures and metal-coated surfaces as well as soft matter under ambient conditions, while also enabling measurements in more demanding environments including ultrahigh vacuum and cryogenic conditions where conventional cantilever-based AFM often encounters limitations. However, the broader adoption of QTF-AFM has been constrained by the difficulty of attaching a cantilever tip to a quartz tuning fork (QTF) with the positional and angular precision required for repeatable and reproducible probe fabrication. For stable operation, the tip must be placed precisely at the midline of a single tine, aligned parallel to the prong axis, and rigidly secured. Even slight lateral offsets or angular deviations disrupt the intrinsic antisymmetric flexural mode, induce torsional coupling, and ultimately lead to systematic image distortions and reduced measurement integrity. In this work, we present a comprehensive, semi-automated QTF-tip fabrication system that integrates precision alignment, real-time frequency-sweep monitoring, and controlled Q-factor tuning within a single workflow. Experimental characterization demonstrates consistent probe preparation across multiple trials, preservation of sharp and well-defined resonance responses with deliberately adjustable damping, and high-fidelity, high-resolution imaging in practical scanning tests. This integrated approach provides a reproducible framework to QTF-based probe fabrication, lowering the technical barrier to QTF-AFM implementation and broadening its applicability across diverse sample types and operating environments.

Title: Synergy of fivefold boost SOT efficiency and field-free magnetization switching with broken inversion symmetry: Toward neuromorphic computing
Authors: Badsha Sekh, Hasibur Rahaman, Subhakanta Das, Mitali, Ramu Maddu, Kesavan Jawahar, S.N. Piramanayagam
Abstract: Non-volatile Neuromorphic Computing (NC) elements utilizing Spin Orbit Torque (SOT) provide a viable solution to alleviate the memory wall bottleneck in contemporary computing systems. However, the two challenges, low SOT efficiency and the need for in plane symmetry breaking field for perpendicular magnetization switching, greatly limit its practical implementation. In this work, the enhanced SOT efficiency of Platinum (Pt) SOT layer and field free perpendicular magnetization switching are achieved by integrating thin Ruthenium Oxide (RuO2) layer in our material stack. The optimal RuO2 thickness (0.5 nm) enhances 5.2 times Damping Like (DL) SOT efficiency compared with pure SOT layer (Pt), as determined by hysteresis loop shift measurements, with a relatively low resistivity (90 micro-Ohm-cm). Moreover, we achieve 3 times reduction of critical magnetization switching current density compared to reference sample. Our experimental findings also demonstrate Rashba-induced substantial field-free magnetization switching in the presence of an emergent built-in interfacial field. Notably, reliable multi resistance synaptic states are achieved by tailoring the synergistic effects of enhanced SOT and interfacial magnetism. The functionality of synaptic states has been further evaluated by implementing an artificial neural network and achieved image recognition accuracies of approximately 95% and 87% on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets, respectively. This systematic study paves the way to energy-efficient, field-free SOT synapses for practical NC applications.

Title: Multistability of graphene nanobubbles
Authors: Alexander V. Savin
Abstract: Using the example of Ar, Kr, and Xe atoms, it is shown that graphene nanobubbles on flat substrates are multistable systems. A nanobubble can have many stable stationary states, each characterized by the number of layers, $l$, within the cluster of internal atoms. The layers are circular in shape, concentrically stacked on top of each other, forming an $l$-stepped pyramid with a flat top. The covering of this pyramid with a graphene sheet is achieved through its local stretching. The valence bonds of the sheet stretch only over the group of internal atoms; outside the coverage zone, the sheet remains undeformed and lies flush against the substrate. The maximum possible number of layers, $l_m$, increases monotonically with the number of atoms $N$ ($l_m=6$ for $N=4000$). The graphene sheet, interacting with the substrate, compresses the internal atom cluster against it, generating an internal pressure of $P\sim 1$ GPa. Numerical simulations of thermal vibrations reveal that among all $l$-layer configurations of a nanobubble, there is always one "ground"\ state. Upon heating, this ground state smoothly transitions into a layerless liquid state. All other stationary states transform into this ground state once a certain temperature is reached (for $N=4000$, the ground state corresponds to state with $l=4$). The coexistence of several stable states with different numbers of layers at low temperatures leads to the absence of a universal shape for the nanobubbles. In this scenario, the height-to-radius ratio, $H/R$, can vary from 0 to 0.24, depending on the number of layers.

Title: A modified Lindblad equation for a Rabi driven electron-spin qubit with tunneling to a Markovian lead
Authors: Emily Townsend, Joshua Pomeroy, Garnett W. Bryant
Abstract: We derive a modified Lindblad equation for the state of quantum dot tunnel coupled to a Markovian lead when the spin state of the dot is driven by an oscillating magnetic field. We show that the equation is a completely positive, trace-preserving map and find the jump operators. This is a driven-dissipative regime in which coherent driving is relevant to the tunneling and cannot be treated as simply a rotation modifying the system with a bath derived under a static magnetic field. This work was motivated by an experimental desire to determine the Zeeman splitting of an electron spin on a quantum dot (a spin qubit), and in a related work we show that this splitting energy can be found by measuring the charge occupancy of the dot while sweeping the frequency of the driving field \ arXiv:2503.17481. Here we cover the full derivation of the equation and give the jump operators. These jump operators are potentially useful for describing the stochastic behavior of more complex systems with coherent driving of a spin capable of tunneling on or off of a device, such as in electron spin resonance scanning tunneling microscopy. The jump operators have the interesting feature of combining jumps of electrons onto and off of the device.

Title: Towards a single-junction non-concentrator metal halide perovskite hot carrier solar cell: review of current gaps and opportunities in understanding slow hot carrier cooling
Authors: Gabriel J. Man
Abstract: The photovoltaic solar cell is a mature technology, with silicon-based technologies deployed at scale, yet current technologies are limited by the Shockley-Queisser thermodynamic limit, known since the early 1960s. The single-junction non-concentrator hot carrier solar cell operating at ambient temperature - with its theoretically predicted ultimate power conversion efficiency limit of nearly 70% that is twice the Shockley-Queisser limit and is higher than what can be achieved with even n=6 multijunction solar cells - has remained an elusive yet hot research target since the early 1980s. Metal halide perovskite semiconductors were discovered in the late 1970s and photovoltaic applications have been intensively researched and developed since the early 2010s. Current technology development of perovskite solar cells is heavily motivated by their expected cheap processing costs relative to other Shockley-Queisser limited technologies. History has shown that very few absorber materials develop into viable solar cell technologies, and it has been recognized that given the declining costs of silicon-based technologies, a new material must offer potential for both lower cost and higher efficiencies than the Shockley-Queisser limit. Slow cooling of photocarriers with energy in excess of the band edges (hot carriers), which is the first prerequisite of a solar absorbing material for building a hot carrier solar cell technology, has been reported in perovskites since the 2010s. The goal of this review is to illuminate the path towards a single-junction perovskite hot carrier solar cell technology by emphasizing uncertainties in understanding slow hot carrier cooling and recommending approaches to resolve them.

Title: Thermally-Activated Epitaxy of NbO
Authors: Sandra Glotzer, Jeong Rae Kim, Joseph Falson
Abstract: We demonstrate a thermally-activated epitaxy window for the growth of NbO at temperatures exceeding 1000 $^o$C. NbO films grown in this mode display superior structural and transport properties, which are reproducible across a window of oxygen partial pressure. Through comprehensive analysis, we propose the prototypical electrical properties of NbO, for which a consensus has not yet been made. This study unequivocally demonstrates the utility of high temperatures in the thin film synthesis of refractory metal compounds.

Title: Optical probing of Wigner crystallization in monolayer WSe$_2$ via diffraction of longitudinal excitons
Authors: Artem N. Abramov, Emil Chiglintsev, Tatiana Oskolkova, Maria Titova, Mikhail Kashchenko, Denis Bandurin, Alexander Chernov, Vasily Kravtsov, Ivan V. Iorsh
Abstract: Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are characterized by relatively large carrier effective masses and suppressed screening of the Coulomb interaction, which substantially enhances the correlation effects in these structures. The direct band gap allows to effectively optically probe these correlations. Here, we present an experimental observation of Wigner crystallization in monolayer $\mathrm{WSe}_2$ probed by the measurement of the exciton diffraction on the Wigner crystal (WC) periodic potential. We observe the formation of the WC phase in the absence of external magnetic fields at temperature range $T<26~\mathrm{K}$ and carrier concentrations $n$ $<2\times10^{11}~\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$. The direct observation of the exciton diffraction is enabled by the strong exciton longitudinal-transverse splitting induced by the long-range intervalley exchange interaction, leading to the large detuning between main exciton peak and first diffraction peak. Our findings highlight that the valley degree of freedom of charge carriers in TMDs facilitates optical probing of correlated electron phases in these structures.

Title: Controlled Switching of Bose-Einstein Condensation in a Mixture of Two Species of Polaritons
Authors: Hassan Alnatah, Shuang Liang, Qiaochu Wan, Jonathan Beaumariage, Ken West, Kirk Baldwin, Loren N. Pfeiffer, David W. Snoke
Abstract: We report temperature-dependent switching between lower and upper polariton condensation in a GaAs/AlGaAs microcavity when both of these species have comparable populations in a mixture. Using angle-resolved photoluminescence, we observe that at low temperatures, condensation occurs in the lower polariton branch, while at elevated temperatures, the upper polariton branch can become favored. At an intermediate temperature, we observe instability in the condensate formation, characterized by metastable correlations of the fluctuations in intensity and linewidth of the lower and upper polariton branches.

Title: Nuclear quadrupole interaction and zero first-order Zeeman transitions of $^{167}$Er$^{3+}$ in CaWO$_4$
Authors: Lewin Marsh, Yikai Yang, Cesare Mattiroli, Mikhael T. Sayat, Đàm Minh Trí, Henrik M. Rønnow, Jevon J. Longdell, Jian-Rui Soh
Abstract: We report microwave spectroscopy of $^{167}$Er$^{3+}$ doped in CaWO$_4$ which reveals the hyperfine splitting of the erbium electronic ground state ($Z_1$, $J_\mathrm{eff.}$=15/2) induced by the $I$=7/2 nuclear spin. From spectra measured below$\sim$50 mK in magnetic fields up to 200 mT, we extract spin Hamiltonian parameters including the electron $\textbf{g}$, hyperfine $\textbf{A}$, and nuclear electric quadrupolar $\textbf{Q}$ tensors. Crucially, our analysis demonstrate unambiguously, that the previously unobserved nuclear electric quadrupolar moment is essential to reproduce the experimental data. With these refined parameters, we identify zero first-order Zeeman (ZEFOZ) transitions at zero magnetic field. Extending the analysis to finite fields, we uncover that ZEFOZ points lie either along the $c$ axis or within the $a$-$b$ plane. These results establish CaWO$_4$ as a promising host for long lifetime quantum memories.

Title: Magnetic structure of EuZn$_2$Sb$_2$ single-crystal thin-film
Authors: Yu Wei Soh, Hsiang Lee, Eugen Weschke, Shinichi Nishihaya, Mikhael T. Sayat, Masaki Uchida, Jian-Rui Soh
Abstract: Magnetic topological materials are a class of compounds which can host massless electrons controlled by the magnetic order. One such compound is EuZn$_2$Sb$_2$, which has recently garnered interest due to its strong interplay between the Eu magnetism and charge carriers. However the topology of the electronic band structure, which depends on the ground state magnetic configuration of the europium sublattice, has not been determined. Based on our \textit{ab-initio} calculations, we find that an in-plane and out-of-plane \textit{A}-type antiferromagnetic (AFM) order generates a topological crystalline insulator and Dirac semimetal respectively, whereas a ferromagnetic (FM) order stabilizes a Weyl semimetal. Our resonant x-ray elastic scattering measurements of single-crystal thin film EuZn$_2$Sb$_2$ reveal both a sharp magnetic peak at $\textit{\textbf{Q}}$=$(0,0,\frac{1}{2})$ and broad $\textit{\textbf{Q}}$=$(0,0,1)$ below $T_{\mathrm{N}}=12.9$\,K, which is associated with an \textit{A}-type AFM and FM order, respectively. Our measurements indicate that the FM and AFM layers are spatially separated along the crystal $c$ axis, with the former limited to the top three atomic layers. We propose that EuZn$_2$Sb$_2$ behaves as a Weyl semimetal in the surface FM layers, and as a topological crystalline insulator in the lower AFM layers.

Title: Energy Eigenstates of Electrons, Magnons and Phonons in Fe$_3$O$_4$ (magnetite), MnFe$_2$O$_4$ (jacobsite), and mixed Mn-Zn ferrites
Authors: Deepak Dhariwal, Michael R. von Spakovsky, William T. Reynolds Jr
Abstract: We report first-principles calculations of the electronic structure, magnon excitations, and phonons in magnetite (Fe$_3$O$_4$), jacobsite (MnFe$_2$O$_4$), and mixed manganese-zinc ferrites (Mn$_{x}$,Zn$_{1-x}$)Fe$_2$O$_4$ for representative compositions ($0\le x \le 1$) and A/B-site cation arrangements. Electronic structures are computed using density functional theory (DFT) augmented by rotationally invariant DFT+U+J, with on-site Hubbard and Hund's parameters, $U$ and $J$, respectively, determined self-consistently by spin-polarized linear-response perturbations of the chosen correlated subspaces (including, where applied, the ligand $2p$ subspace). A classical Heisenberg spin Hamiltonian is parameterized by mapping DFT+U+J total energies for multiple collinear spin configurations onto nearest-neighbor exchange couplings, which are then used to obtain magnon dispersions and magnon densities of states within linear spin-wave theory. Phonon spectra and densities of states are obtained from finite-displacement force constants and dynamical matrices computed on the same DFT+U+J-relaxed structures. Overall, the workflow provides a consistent, composition- and configuration-aware route to electronic, vibrational, and magnetic excitation spectra across the Mn/Zn ferrite space.

Title: Ab Initio Many Body Quantum Embedding and Local Correlation in Crystalline Materials using Interpolative Separable Density Fitting
Authors: Junjie Yang, Ning Zhang, Shunyue Yuan, Jincheng Yu, Hong-Zhou Ye, Garnet Chan
Abstract: We present an efficient implementation of ab initio many-body quantum embedding and local correlation methods for infinite periodic systems through translational symmetry adapted interpolative separable density fitting, an approach which reduces the scaling of the calculations to only linear with the number of k-points. Employing this methodology, we compute correlated ground-state coupled cluster energies within density matrix embedding and local natural orbital correlation frameworks for both weakly and strongly correlated solids, using up to 1000 k-points. By extrapolating the local correlation domains and k-point sampling we further obtain estimates of the full coupled cluster with singles, doubles, and perturbative triples ground-state energies in the thermodynamic limit.

Title: Fluctuation-Response Theory for Nonequilibrium Langevin Dynamics
Authors: Hyun-Myung Chun, Euijoon Kwon, Hyunggyu Park, Jae Sung Lee
Abstract: We establish a unified fluctuation-response relation for Langevin dynamics. By exploiting the common mathematical structures underlying fluctuations and responses of empirical density and current, we derive a unified identity that generalizes the fluctuation-dissipation theorem from equilibrium to nonequilibrium settings. This relation connects global fluctuations of observables with their local responses to perturbations in force, mobility, and temperature. We further derive finite-time fluctuation-response inequalities, leading to response uncertainty relations that complement the identity by providing more practical bounds. These derivations establish a unified theoretical framework linking the fluctuation-dissipation theorem and thermodynamic uncertainty relations. Using the $F_1$-ATPase molecular motor model, we illustrate how these response-based bounds constrain the long-time diffusion coefficient.

Title: Emergence of Kondo-assisted Néel order in a Kondo necklace model
Authors: Hironori Yamaguchi, Shunsuke C. Furuya, Yu Tominaga, Takanori Kida, Koji Araki, Masayuki Hagiwara
Abstract: The interplay between Kondo screening and magnetic order has long been a central issue in the physics of strongly correlated systems. While the Kondo effect has traditionally been understood to suppress magnetism through the formation of local singlets, recent studies suggest that Kondo interactions may enhance magnetic order under certain conditions. However, these scenarios often rely on complex electronic structures, including orbital and charge degrees of freedom, making the essential mechanisms difficult to isolate. Here we report the realization of a spin-(1/2,1) Kondo necklace model in a Ni-based complex-a minimal spin-only analog of the Kondo lattice that isolates quantum spin correlations by eliminating charge degrees of freedom. Thermodynamic measurements identify a magnetic phase transition and a field-induced quantum phase transition. Perturbative analysis reveals that the Kondo coupling mediates effective antiferromagnetic interactions between the spin-1 sites, stabilizing the Néel order across the entire chain. Our results establish a universal boundary in Kondo physics, where coupling to spin-1/2 moments yields singlets, but to spin-1 and higher stabilizes magnetic order.

Title: Realization of a triangular spin necklace in a verdazyl-based Ni complex
Authors: Itsuki Shimamura, Risa Yagura, Takanori Kida, Masayuki Hagiwara, Koji Araki, Yoshiki Iwasaki, Yuko Hosokoshi, Kenta Kimura, Hironori Yamaguchi
Abstract: We successfully synthesized a verdazyl-based complex, ($m$-Py-V)$_3$[Ni(NO$_3$)$_2$], in which Ni$^{2+}$ ions and verdazyl radicals form a one-dimensional, triangular spin necklace consisting of spin-1/2 and spin-1 units. Molecular orbital calculations reveal strong antiferromagnetic (AF) interactions between inversion-related radical pairs that form spin-1/2 singlet dimers. The remaining verdazyl and Ni$^{2+}$ spins form frustrated triangular units, creating a distinctive spin network. Magnetic susceptibility and specific heat measurements identify a phase transition to an AF order. The application of magnetic fields suppresses the phase transition signal, suggesting field-induced decoupling of the spin-1 moments. Electron spin resonance measurements are used to evaluate the easy-axis anisotropy of spin-1, which may promote the AF order. This work provides a rare example of a geometrically frustrated quantum spin chain realized via molecular design, thereby offering a platform for exploring frustration-driven quantum phases in low-dimensional materials.

Title: Accelerating dynamical mean-field theory convergence by preconditioning with computationally cheaper quantum embedding methods
Authors: E. M. Makaresz, O. Gingras, Tsung-Han Lee, Nicola Lanatà, B. J. Powell, Henry L. Nourse
Abstract: Dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) is a cornerstone technique for studying strongly correlated electronic systems. However, each DMFT step is computationally demanding, and many iterations can be required to achieve convergence. Here, we accelerate the convergence of DMFT by initializing its self-consistent cycle with solutions from computationally cheaper and more approximate methods. We compare the initialization with the non-interacting solution to a range of quantum embedding compatible approaches: Hartree-Fock, the Hubbard-I approximation, rotationally invariant slave bosons (RISB), and its ghost extension (g-RISB). We find that these initializations can reduce the number of DMFT iterations by up to an order of magnitude, with g-RISB providing the most effective and reliable benefits. In most regimes, initializing with g-RISB and performing a single DMFT iteration suffices to recover the full dynamical structure. The improvement in convergence is controlled by the initial solution's accuracy in the low-energy part of the self-energy, on the scale of the non-interacting bandwidth. This strategy is especially effective at the Mott insulator-metal transition, where an initialization from the non-interacting limit can lead to a breakdown of DMFT due to the sign problem. Our results establish the usage of accurate yet cheaper quantum embedding methods as a powerful means to substantially reduce the computational cost of DMFT, particularly in regimes where convergence is slow or prone to failure.

Title: Diffusive and hydrodynamic magnetotransport around a density perturbation in a two-dimensional electron gas
Authors: P. S. Parashar, M. M. Fogler
Abstract: We study current flow around a circular density depletion in a two-dimensional electron gas in the presence of a strong magnetic field. The depletion is parametrized by a power-law tail with an exponent $\beta > 2$. We show that current and electrochemical potential are exponentially suppressed inside a surrounding area much larger than the geometric size of the depletion region. The corresponding ``no-go'' radius grows as a certain power of the magnetic field. Residual current and potential exhibit spiraling patterns inside the no-go region. Outside of it, they acquire corrections inversely proportional to the distance, which is known as the Landauer resistivity dipole. The Landauer dipole is rotated by the angle $\pi (1 - 1 / \beta)$ with respect to the direction of the average electric field. We also consider the effect of electron viscosity and show that the variation of the no-go radius with magnetic field becomes more rapid if viscosity is large enough. In that regime the size of the Landauer dipole is set by the Gurzhi length, which is much larger than the no-go radius, which is in turn much larger than the geometric size of the depletion. Our results may be useful for interpreting nanoimaging of current distribution in graphene and other two-dimensional systems.

Title: Photoinduced metastable cation disorder in metal halide double perovskites

Abstract: Lead-free perovskites have emerged as environmentally benign alternatives to lead-halide counterparts for optoelectronics. Among them, the double perovskite Cs2AgInCl6 family exhibits remarkable white-light emission with proper composition engineering, enabled by strong electron-phonon coupling and the formation of self-trapped excitons (STEs). Despite these advantages, the fundamental photo- and structural dynamics governing their excited-state behavior remain poorly understood. Here, we report a long-lived metastable phase in the Cs2AgInCl6 double perovskite family and unravel this process and the concomitant electronic and structural evolution using a suite of tools including transient optical spectroscopy, time-resolved X-ray diffraction (TR-XRD) and X-ray absorption (TR-XAS). We show that the photoinduced, transient metastable phase is associated with B-site (Ag-In) disorder, which induces a dramatically reduced optical bandgap. Supported by TR-XRD and first-principles calculations, the Ag-In disorder drives the formation of Ag-rich and In-rich domains with millisecond lifetimes, with lifetimes increasing at lower temperatures. TR-XAS further reveals that photogenerated STEs oxidize Ag+ to Ag2+, facilitating this highly temporally asymmetric order-disorder transition. Our findings demonstrate a new mechanism, mediated by hole-localized STE formation, that enables prolongation of transient light-induced states to the multi-millisecond regime in double perovskites, opening possibilities to harvesting the functional properties of metastable phases of these materials.

Title: Anharmonic thermodynamics redefines metastability and parent phases in ferroelectric HfO2
Authors: Yiheng Shen, Chang Liu, Wei Xie, Wei Ren
Abstract: Hafnia (HfO2) is a silicon-compatible dielectric material, yet stabilizing its desired but metastable ferroelectric phase remains challenging. Phase stability predictions by density functional theory (DFT) have provided crucial guidance, but most simulations neglected or only treated finite temperature effects with (quasi-)harmonic approximation due to high computational cost of DFT. Here, we develop a machine learning force field and perform thermodynamic calculations for HfO2 using self-consistent phonon theory to address growing evidence of anharmonicity. Our results reveal that the ferroelectric orthorhombic phase oIII exhibits metastability below 0.1kBT under most conditions within the simulated regime of temperature and pressure (600 K <= T <= 1500 K and 0 <= p <= 7.5 GPa), contradicting previous harmonic predictions of metastability above 1500 K at ambient pressure. We further report evidence for temperature- and pressure-dependent ferroelectric parent phase despite efforts to identify a universal one. This study highlights the importance of anharmonicity and provides an effective approach for its treatment in the design of HfO2-based ferroelectrics.

Abstract: We present a theory for the interaction between active particles and a passive flexible membrane. By explicitly solving for the pressure exerted by the active particles, we show that they reduce the membrane tension and bending modulus and introduce novel non-local contributions to the membrane mechanics. This theory predicts activity-induced instabilities and their morphology are in agreement with recent experimental and simulation data.

Title: Distinguishing Hot-Electron and Optomechanical Pathways at Metal-Molecule Interfaces
Authors: Bing Gao, Jameel Damoah, Wassie M. Takele, Terefe G. Habteyes
Abstract: Energy and charge transfer between molecules and metal surfaces underpin heterogeneous catalysis, surface-enhanced spectroscopies and plasmon-driven chemistry, yet the microscopic origins of vibrational excitation at metal interfaces remain unresolved. Here we use temperature-dependent surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) to directly distinguish plasmon-vibration optomechanical coupling from hot-electron-driven this http URL probing thionine adsorbed on gold nanostructures at 295 K and 3.5 K, we show that pronounced anti-Stokes scattering at cryogenic temperature arises from optical pumping of vibrational populations, whereas room-temperature spectra are governed by thermal population. Bromide co-adsorbates play a decisive role by guiding molecular alignment, inducing surface atom displacements, and enabling transient adsorption geometries that activate otherwise Raman-inactive vibrational modes. In the absence of bromide, distinct excitation pathways emerge, reflecting competition between optomechanical coupling and charge-transfer processes associated with molecular polarization along the optical field or orientation relative to the metal surface. These results establish molecular optomechanics as a sensitive probe of surface-molecule interactions and demonstrate how anion-mediated surface dynamics regulate energy flow at plasmonic interfaces.

Title: Effect of Electron Correlation on the Integer Quantum Hall Effect
Authors: Daniel Staros, Christopher Lane, Roxanne Tutchton, Jian-Xin Zhu
Abstract: We numerically investigate the effect of electron correlation on the integer quantum Hall effect in a square lattice. Increasing the correlation strength via the effective onsite repulsion parameter $U$ degrades the quantization of $\nu = 1$ transverse conductance due to the interplay of correlation and the external magnetic field, which together induce periodic modulations in renormalized hopping parameters and site energies. Overall, this work demonstrates that the strength of electron correlation can significantly impact conductivity in the integer quantum Hall regime.

Title: Simulations of High Temperature Decomposition of Metal-Organic Frameworks to form Amorphous Catalysts
Authors: Connor W. Edwards, Oliver M. Linder-Patton, Jack D. Evans
Abstract: Metal-organic framework (MOF) derived materials formed through high temperature processes show great potential as catalysts. However, understanding of structure-property relationships between the initial MOF and the resulting MOF-derived catalyst is limited because the amorphous nature of the catalyst challenges standard structural characterization methods. Neural network approaches that learn interatomic potentials from density functional theory offer a promising solution. We simulated the pyrolysis of UiO-66, UiO-67 and MIP-206 using both foundational and fine-tuned machine learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs). To mimic experimental conditions, an atmosphere of CO2 and H2 was introduced and the structures were doped with 20 wt% copper to probe the effect of copper on the structural evolution of MOFs. These simulations provide atomistic insights into gas evolution, metal nanoparticle formation, and linker decomposition that were compared to available experimental data. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of MLIPs to accurately model high temperature MOF dynamics under experimentally relevant conditions and guide the design of new catalytic materials.

Title: Superconductivity in non-centrosymmetric rhombohedral NbSe2

Abstract: Crystal stacking offers a powerful yet underexplored route to engineer symmetry in layered superconductors. Here we report superconductivity in rhombohedral-stacked NbSe2 (3R-NbSe2), a non-centrosymmetric polytype in which global inversion symmetry is removed by stacking alone. Using comprehensive structural, transport, magnetic, and thermodynamic measurements, we establish superconductivity as a bulk property of the 3R phase and find that the in-plane upper critical field exceeds the Pauli paramagnetic limit, indicating the persistence of strong Ising-type spin-orbit coupling. Unlike the thickness-dependent superconductivity in centrosymmetric 2H-NbSe2, the superconducting transition temperature in 3R-NbSe2 shows little dependence on layer number but exhibits an unusually strong sensitivity to disorder. We further observe strongly enhanced nonlinear optical and electrical responses near the superconducting transition, consistent with stacking-induced inversion-symmetry breaking. Our results identify 3R-NbSe2 as a single-phase platform in which stacking engineering reshapes superconductivity and enables nonlinear transport phenomena in layered materials.

Title: A low-tech solution to process entire metal/molecule heterostructure stacks into vertical nanopillar electronic devices

Abstract: Quantum technologies aim to assemble devices whose operation is controlled by the quantum state of individual atoms. Achieving this level of control in a practical, scalable design remains, however, a major obstacle to mass societal adoption. By working at the level of interatomic bonding, molecular engineering has enabled exquisite control over the electronic properties of individual atoms and their interactions with neighboring atoms. This positions molecular electronics as a potentially disruptive quantum technology, but serious technological challenges have prevented it from being included in technical road maps. The main obstacle is that conventional, mass scalable nanodevice technologies utilize resists and solvents that can degrade molecules. Some approaches involve exposing junction interfaces to contaminants (e.g. air, resist etc...), which can be particularly problematic for spintronics. In this technical paper, we present our decade-long work into building a nanotechnological chain that can process entire metal/molecule heterostructures into vertical nanopillars electronic devices. We discuss the advantages and pitfalls of the various iterations of this process that were implemented. We also discuss outlooks for this unique technology.

Title: Electrically Accessible Metamagnetic Transition via a Doping-Induced Low-Energy Magnetic State in Antiferromagnetic Insulator RFeO3
Authors: Wanting Yang, Haohuan Peng, Ziming Wang, Xiaoxuan Ma, Baojuan Kang, Chang Xue, Rongrong Jia, Jun-Yi Ge, Jinrong Cheng, Shixun Cao
Abstract: Low-energy antiferromagnetic phase transitions offer an appealing platform for low-power spintronic functionalities, yet their direct electrical access in insulating antiferromagnets remains challenging, particularly in the low-field regime where subtle Neeel vector reorientations dominate. Here, we demonstrate that targeted rare-earth-site engineering enables an electrically accessible metamagnetic transition in the insulating orthoferrite Ho0.5Dy0.5FeO3. By combining the distinct spin-reorientation sequences of DyFeO3 and HoFeO3, Dy substitution stabilizes a dual spin-reorientation pathway, hosting an intermediate state with a reduced energy barrier. This low-energy antiferromagnetic state can be tuned into the weak-ferromagnetic state under low magnetic fields. The critical field decreases with increasing temperature, providing a favorable window for functional manipulation. Both longitudinal and transverse spin Hall magnetoresistance channels exhibit clear and reproducible signatures of the metamagnetic transitions. Owing to the enhanced sensitivity of the transverse channel, additional low-field features are resolved, reflecting the projection of the Neel vector onto the spin-accumulation direction. Electrical transport measurements correlate directly with the magnetically determined phase boundaries, establishing a purely electrical access to low-energy phase transitions and to illustrate a viable pathway for exploring low-power spin dynamics in insulating oxide antiferromagnets.

Abstract: Recent dielectric and magnetic studies of (Ca0.5Mn1.5)MnWO6 ceramics [A.A. Belik, Chem. Mater. 36, 7604 (2024)] have classified this material as a rare hybrid multiferroic, with both antiferromagnetic and (anti)ferroelectric ordering occurring at the same temperature of 22 K. The pronounced dielectric anomaly observed at this temperature indicated that the structural change is primarily induced by a phonon soft mode and not by a spin arrangement, as is usually the case in type II multiferroics. However, our comprehensive investigation involving new ceramic samples as well as the sample from the above-mentioned reference does not support this conclusion. Low-temperature polarization measurements revealed no evidence of either ferroelectric or antiferroelectric order in both sample series. The dielectric permittivity exhibits only a slight change at the antiferromagnetic transition, and phonon modes observed in IR and Raman spectra show no indication of a symmetry change at low temperatures. In the new samples the Neel temperature is shifted to TN = 18 K. XRD, SEM, EDS and WDS analyses confirmed the composition (Ca0.5Mn1.5)MnWO6 of both ceramics, but also indicated a small amount (percentage points) of MnO and CaO impurities in the sample from the previous publication and Mn3O4, CaWO4 secondary phases (<4%) in the new ceramics. The differences in dielectric and magnetic properties of the two samples can therefore be explained by their different chemical purity. The small dielectric anomaly of the new sample at the antiferromagnetic transition temperature is explained by a spin-phonon coupling. We conclude that (Ca0.5Mn1.5)MnWO6 is not a multiferroic, but a paraelectric antiferromagnet.

Title: Bosonization Solution to Spin-Valley Kondo Problem: Finite-Size Spectrum and Renormalization Group Analysis
Authors: Yi-Jie Wang, Geng-Dong Zhou, Hyunsung Jung, Seongyeon Youn, Seung-Sup B. Lee, Zhi-Da Song
Abstract: Spin-valley Anderson impurities (SVAIM) with (anti-)Hund's splitting provide a natural explanation to the origin of pairing potential and pseudogap in the magic-angle graphene. In this work, we derive and analytically solve the low-energy Kondo theories for SVAIM at half-filling, with especial focus on the two anti-Hund's regimes: the impurity is either dominated by a valley doublet, or a trivial singlet. In the doublet regime, we reveal that a novel pair Kondo scattering $\lambda_x$ is required to flip the valley doublet, which involves a quartic operator of bath electrons. Our renormalization group (RG) calculation based on the Coulomb gas analog shows $\lambda_x$ drives a phase transition of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless type. One side of the transition is an anisotropic doublet phase, characterized by non-universal phase shifts of bath electrons and non-analytic impurity susceptibilities, while the other is a Fermi liquid formed by pair-Kondo resonance. The finite-size many-body spectrum, thermodynamic quantities, and correlation functions for both phases are analytically solved. Remarkably, the solution in the pair-Kondo Fermi liquid is achieved via the constructive approach of bosonization-refermionization along a solvable fixed line, where the many-body interaction $\lambda_x$ is mapped into a pseudo-fermion bilinear in a rigorous manner. Finally, we also apply the RG analysis to the singlet regime, and identify a second-order phase transition between the Kondo Fermi liquid and a local singlet phase.

Title: Mobile charges in MoS2/high-k oxide transistors: from abnormal instabilities to memory-like dynamics
Authors: Shaokai Zhou, Haihui Cai, Yehao Wu, Yufeng Min, Renchen Yuan, Yezhu Lv, Jianming Huang, Yuanyuan Shi, Yury Yuryevich Illarionov
Abstract: MoS$_2$ field-effect transistors (FETs) with high-\textit{k} oxides currently lag behind silicon standards in bias and temperature stability due to ubiquitous border oxide traps that cause clockwise (CW) hysteresis in gate transfer characteristics. While suppressing this effect is typically mandatory for logic FETs, here we explore an alternative strategy where the initial CW hysteresis can be dynamically overcome by stronger counterclockwise (CCW) hysteresis towards memory-like dynamics. We systematically compare hysteresis in similar back-gated MoS$_2$/HfO$_2$ and MoS$_2$/Al$_2$O$_3$ FETs up to 275\textdegree C. At room temperature, both devices initially show sizable CW hysteresis. However, at 175\textdegree C MoS$_2$/HfO$_2$ FETs exhibit dominant CCW dynamics coupled with self-doping and negative differential resistance (NDR) effects. Our compact model suggests that this behavior is caused by the drift of mobile oxygen vacancies (\textit{V}\({}_{\mathrm{O}}^{+}\) or \textit{V}\({}_{\mathrm{O}}^{2+}\)) within HfO$_2$ which also causes negative $V_{\mathrm{th}}$ shift under a constant positive bias stress. This alternative mechanism effectively overrides the initial CW hysteresis and enables intrinsic memory functionality that can be enhanced by using narrower gate bias sweep ranges. In contrast, the MoS$_2$/Al$_2$O$_3$ FETs display only minor CCW dynamics even at 275\textdegree C due to higher drift activation energies for the same vacancies, thereby maintaining superior stability. Our results reveal an insulators selection paradigm: Al$_2$O$_3$ layers are better suited to suppress detrimental negative $V_{\mathrm{th}}$ shifts in MoS$_2$ logic FETs at high temperatures, whereas their HfO$_2$ counterparts can serve as active memory layers that would exploit these abnormal instabilities.

Title: Electronic structure, phase stability, and transport properties of the AlTiVCr lightweight high-entropy alloy: A computational study
Authors: Christopher D. Woodgate, Hubert J. Naguszewski, Nicolas F. Piwek, David Redka
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamics and phase stability of the AlTiVCr lightweight high-entropy alloy using a combination of ab initio electronic structure calculations, a concentration wave analysis, and atomistic Monte Carlo simulations. In alignment both with experimental data and with results obtained using other computational approaches, we predict a $\textrm{B2}$ (CsCl) chemical ordering emerging in this alloy at comparatively high temperatures, which is driven by Al and Ti moving to separate sublattices, while V and Cr express weaker site preferences. The impact of this $\textrm{B2}$ chemical ordering on the electronic transport properties of the alloy is investigated within a Kubo-Greenwood linear response framework and it is found that, counter-intuitively, the alloy's residual resistivity increases as the material transitions from the $\textrm{A2}$ (disordered bcc) phase to our predicted $\textrm{B2}$ (partially) ordered structure. This is understood to result primarily from a reduction in the density of electronic states at the Fermi level induced by the chemical ordering. At low temperatures, our atomistic Monte Carlo simulations then reveal subsequent sublattice orderings, with the ground-state configuration predicted to be a fully-ordered, single-phase structure with vanishing associated residual resistivity. These results give fresh, insight into the atomic-scale structure and consequent physical properties of this well-studied, technologically relevant material.

Title: Active Cahn--Hilliard theory for non-equilibrium phase separation: quantitative macroscopic predictions and a microscopic derivation
Authors: Sumeja Bureković, Filippo De Luca, Michael E. Cates, Cesare Nardini
Abstract: Phase-separating active systems can display phenomenology that is impossible in equilibrium. The binodal densities are not solely determined by a bulk (effective) free energy, but also affected by gradient terms, while capillary waves and Ostwald processes are determined by three distinct interfacial tensions. These and related phenomena were so far explained at continuum level using a top-down minimal theory (Active Model B+). This theory, by Taylor-expanding in the scalar order parameter (or density), effectively assumes that phase separation is weak, which is not true across most of the phase diagram. Here we develop a quantitative account of active phase separation, by introducing an active counterpart of Cahn-Hilliard theory, constructing the density current from all possible terms with up to four spatial derivatives without Taylor-expanding in the density. From this O(grad^4) theory, we show how to compute binodals and interfacial tensions for arbitrary choices of the five density-dependent 'coefficient functions' that specify the theory (replacing the four constant coefficients of Active Model B+). We further consider a particle model composed of thermal quorum-sensing active particles (tQSAPs) yielding a fully specified example of the O(grad^4) theory upon coarse-graining. We find that to coarse-grain consistently at O(grad^4) requires a novel procedure, based on multiple-scale analysis, to systematically eliminate fast-evolving orientational moments. Using this, we calculate from microscopic physics all five coefficient functions of the active Cahn-Hilliard theory for tQSAPs. We identify contributions that were missed in previous continuum theories, and show how neglecting them becomes justified only in the limit of large quorum-sensing range parameter. Comparison with particle simulations of tQSAPs shows that our O(grad^4) theory improves on previous continuum models [...]

Title: Synergistic effects of ferromagnetic elements and LAGP solid electrolyte in suppressing and trapping polysulfide shuttle transfers in lithium-sulfur batteries
Authors: Giovanni Ceccio, Jiri. Vacík, Mykhailo Drozdenko, Romana Mikšová, Josef Novak, Eva Štěpanovská, Mayur Khan
Abstract: The large - scale commercialization of promising lithium - sulfur (Li - S) batteries remains limited by the polysulfide shuttle effect, which causes rapid capacity fading and poor cycle life. In this study, we present a scalable strategy to mitigate this challenge by modifying polyethylene (PE) separators with ferromagnetic and solid - state ionic coatings. Thin films of nickel (Ni), cobalt (Co), and the Li - ion - conducting ceramic Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 (LAGP) were deposited via ion beam sputtering, while Ni ion implantation was also employed to modify the PE substrate. The electrochemical performance of pristine and modified separators was evaluated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and staircase voltammetry (SV) in liquid electrolyte within H - cell configurations. Surface morphology and elemental composition were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS). The results show that LAGP-based coatings significantly enhance separator stability and effectively suppress polysulfide diffusion, leading to lower redox peak intensities and improved cycling performance. In contrast, Ni coatings exhibited poor long - term stability, likely due to parasitic reactions or delamination during its life time. The combined LAGP/Co architecture provided the most effective suppression of the polysulfide shuttle, attributed to synergistic ionic and catalytic effects that promote interfacial stability and selective ion transport. Ni implantation into PE showed only a negligible effect. This study highlights the potential of integrating solid ionic conductors with ferromagnetic layers to design multifunctional separators for high-performance Li - S batteries.

Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions and related topological spin textures have emerged as a central topic in condensed-matter physics, combining fundamental significance with potential for transformative applications in spintronics, magnonics, and beyond. Over the past decade, advances in material platforms, imaging techniques, theoretical modeling, and device concepts have established skyrmionics as a rapidly expanding field. At the same time, challenges remain in stabilizing, controlling, and integrating such textures into functional architectures, while novel phenomena such as antiskyrmions, higher-order skyrmions, hopfions, and antiferromagnetic textures arise. The 2026 Skyrmionics Roadmap represents a collective effort of many authors, providing a comprehensive perspective on the current state-of-the-art and the outlook for the coming years. In 33 focused sections, each co-authored by two researchers, we chart progress in theory and modeling, material systems, skyrmion dynamics, and skyrmion technologies. By offering a consolidated vision, this Roadmap aims to guide both fundamental research and application-driven efforts, accelerating the transition of skyrmionics from conceptual breakthroughs toward practical technologies.

Title: Enhanced Terahertz Photoresponse via Acoustic Plasmon Cavity Resonances in Scalable Graphene
Authors: Domenico De Fazio, Sebastián Castilla, Karuppasamy P. Soundarapandian, Tetiana Slipchenko, Ioannis Vangelidis, Simone Marconi, Riccardo Bertini, Vlad Petrica, Yang Hao, Alessandro Principi, Elefterios Lidorikis, Roshan K. Kumar, Luis Martín-Moreno, Frank H. L. Koppens
Abstract: Precise control and nanoscale confinement of terahertz (THz) fields are essential requirements for emerging applications in photonics, quantum technologies, wireless communications, and sensing. Here, we demonstrate a polaritonic cavity enhanced THz photoresponse in an antenna coupled device based on chemical vapor deposited (CVD) monolayer graphene. The dipole antenna lobes simultaneously serve as two gate electrodes, concentrate the impinging THz field, and efficiently launch acoustic graphene plasmons (AGPs), which drive a strong photo-thermoelectric (PTE) signal. Between 6 and 90 K, the photovoltage exhibits pronounced peaks, modulating the PTE response by up to 40\%, that we attribute to AGPs forming a Fabry Pérot THz cavity in the full or half graphene channel. Combined full wave and transport thermal simulations accurately reproduce the gate controlled plasmon wavelength, spatial absorption profile, and the resulting nonuniform electron heating responsible for the PTE response. The lateral and vertical maximum confinement factors of the AGP wavelength relative to the incident wavelength are 165 and 4000, respectively, for frequencies from 1.83 to 2.52 THz. These results demonstrate that wafer scalable CVD graphene, without hBN encapsulation, can host coherent AGP resonances and exhibit an efficient polaritonic enhanced photoresponse under appropriate gating, antenna coupling, and AGP cavity design, opening a route to scalable, polarization and frequency selective, liquid nitrogen cooled, and low power consumption THz detection platforms based on plasmon thermoelectric transduction.

Title: Role of defects in the thermodynamic stability of grain boundary phases at asymmetric tilt boundaries in copper
Authors: Swetha Pemma, Lena Langenohl, Saba Saood, Yoonji Choi, Rebecca Janisch, Christian H. Liebscher, Gerhard Dehm, Tobias Brink
Abstract: Grain boundaries can exist as different grain boundary phases (also called complexions) with individual atomic structures. The thermodynamics of these defect phases in high-angle grain boundaries were studied mostly with atomistic and phase field computer simulations, but almost exclusively for special, symmetric boundaries. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations combined with structure search methods, as well as scanning transmission electron microscopy experiments to take a step towards understanding more general grain boundaries. Using the example of $\Sigma$37c $[11\overline{1}]$ tilt boundaries in Cu, we show how the grain boundary phase transition on a symmetric boundary plane is changed by the geometrically necessary defects introduced in inclined, asymmetric boundaries. We analyze the disconnections - which are dislocation-like line defects of grain boundaries - both in the simulations, as well as in experimental Cu and Al samples. A main finding is that defect energies can have a major influence on the stability of grain boundary phases, even at small inclinations. Furthermore, some defects are not able to effect large inclinations. At that point, defective asymmetric GB phases compete with grain boundaries faceting into the adjacent symmetric GB phases.

Title: $d$-wave FFLO state and charge-2e supersolidity in the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model under Zeeman fields
Authors: Xing-Zhou Qu, Dai-Wei Qu, Qiaoyi Li, Wei Li, Gang Su
Abstract: Unconventional superconductivity under strong Zeeman fields--particularly beyond the Pauli paramagnetic limit--remains a central challenge in condensed matter physics. The exotic Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, in particular, remains in need of definitive study within fundamental electronic models. Here we employ state-of-the-art finite-temperature and ground-state tensor network approaches to systematically explore the superconducting (SC) phase diagram of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model subjected to Zeeman fields. We find that zero-momentum $d$-wave superconductivity persists until the spin gap closes, coexisting with charge density waves. A novel $d$-wave FFLO phase emerges under a higher Zeeman field even above the Pauli limit, concomitant with a field-enhanced spin density waves. We identify these phases, characterized by the simultaneous presence of pairing condensate and density wave orders, as charge-2e supersolids. Analysis of Matsubara Green's function reveals that the FFLO pairing momentum is locked to the underlying Fermi surface. Our results provide microscopic insights into field-induced unconventional pairing mechanisms and reveal the long-sought FFLO state in a fundamental correlated electron model, offering a promising route for its realization in ultracold atom optical lattice.

Title: Current-induced magnetization control in dipolar-coupled nanomagnet pairs and artificial spin ice
Authors: A. Pac, G. M. Macauley, J. A. Brock, A. Hrabec, A. Kurenkov, V. Raposo, E. Martinez, L. J. Heyderman
Abstract: Exploiting current-induced spin-orbit torques (SOTs) to manipulate the magnetic state of dipolar-coupled nanomagnet systems with in-plane magnetic anisotropy, such as artificial spin ices, provides a route to local, electrically-programmable control of the magnetization, with relevance for applications including neuromorphic computing. Here, we demonstrate how the orientation of a nanomagnet relative to the direction of an applied electrical current impacts the threshold current density needed for all-electrical magnetization switching, and how dipolar coupling between the nanomagnets influences the switching of interacting pairs and ensembles of nanomagnets. Using a material system designed to generate SOTs in response to electrical currents, we find that the current required to switch the magnetization of isolated nanomagnets varies non-monotonically as the angle between the nanomagnet long axis and the current increases. In small artificial spin ice systems, we observe similar angular dependence of the switching current, which can be used to control the magnetization orientation of specific subsets of nanomagnets. These experimental results are supported by micromagnetic modeling, which illustrates how the various current induced torques can be exploited to control magnetization switching in nanomagnetic systems. These results establish SOT switching as a practical method for programmable manipulation of dipolar nanomagnetic systems.

Title: Microscopic Origin of Piezomagnetism in Mn$_3$Sn: A Dual Real- and $k$-Space Picture
Authors: Soichiro Kikuchi, Yuki Yanagi, Thi Ngoc Huyen Vu, Michi-To Suzuki
Abstract: We present a comprehensive first-principles study on the origin of the piezomagnetic effect in the non-collinear antiferromagnet Mn$_3$Sn, a material known for exhibiting a large anomalous Hall effect. We investigate strain-induced variations of electronic and magnetic states and elucidate the mechanism of the piezomagnetic effect from both real-space and momentum-space perspectives. In real space, the emergence of piezomagnetism is understood to arise from rotations of the magnetic moments at specific Mn sites, which directly couple to the strain. Through detailed electronic structure analysis, we identify the Fermi surfaces that play a crucial role in the emergence of piezomagnetism. Our results reveal that specific Fermi surface features undergo pseudo-degeneracy lifting under applied strain, which significantly contributes to the induced net magnetization. By combining these complementary real-space and momentum-space pictures, our dual-space analysis provides deep insight into the microscopic origins of strain-driven magnetization in Mn$_3$Sn.

Title: Hard disks confined within a narrow channel
Authors: J. M. Brader, E. Di Bernardo, S. M. Tschopp
Abstract: We employ inhomogeneous integral equation theory to investigate the equilibrium properties of hard disks confined to a channel of width $L$ by hard parallel walls. If the channel width is narrowed below two disk diameters, then the system enters a quasi one-dimensional regime for which the particles cannot move past each other. In the limit when $L$ is equal to one particle diameter the system reduces to the one-dimensional bulk along the center of the channel. We study first the dimensional crossover properties of the inhomogeneous Percus-Yevick (PY) integral equation as $L$ is reduced and then investigate the behaviour of a quasi one-dimensional system as the packing of the particles is increased for a fixed value of $L$. We find that the inhomogeneous PY equation is highly accurate for situations of quasi one-dimensional confinement and that it predicts the onset of a structural transition to a zigzag state at higher packing. The excellent performance of this integral equation method and the ease with which it handles confinement-induced dimensional crossover is a consequence of the improved resolution which comes from treating explicitly the inhomogeneous two-body correlation functions.

Title: Simulation of the carbon dioxide hydrate-water interfacial energy
Authors: Jesús Algabaa Esteban Acuña, José Manuel Míguez, Bruno Mendiboure, Iván M. Zerón, Felipe J. Blas
Abstract: Carbon dioxide hydrates are ice-like nonstoichiometric inclusion solid compounds with importance to global climate change, and gas transportation and storage. The thermodynamic and kinetic mechanisms that control carbon dioxide nucleation critically depend on hydrate-water interfacial free energy. Interfacial energies show large uncertainties due to the conditions at which experiments are performed. Under these circumstances, we hypothesize that accurate molecular models for water and carbon dioxide combined with computer simulation tools can offer an alternative but complementary way to estimate interfacial energies at coexistence conditions from a molecular perspective. We have evaluated the interfacial free energy of carbon dioxide hydrates at coexistence conditions (three-phase equilibrium or dissociation line) implementing advanced computational methodologies, including the novel Mold Integration methodology. Our calculations are based on the definition of the interfacial free energy, standard statistical thermodynamic techniques, and the use of the most reliable and used molecular models for water (TIP4P/Ice) and carbon dioxide (TraPPE) available in the literature. We find that simulations provide an interfacial energy value, at coexistence conditions, consistent with the experiments from its thermodynamic definition. Our calculations are reliable since are based on the use of two molecular models that accurately predict: (1) The ice-water interfacial free energy; and (2) the dissociation line of carbon dioxide hydrates. Computer simulation predictions provide alternative but reliable estimates of the carbon dioxide interfacial energy. Our pioneering work demonstrates that is possible to predict interfacial energies of hydrates from a truly computational molecular perspective and opens a new door to the determination of free energies of hydrates.

Title: Observation of an isolated flat band in the van der Waals crystal NbOCl$_2$
Authors: Changhua Bao, Vincent Eggers, Manuel Meierhofer, Jakob Helml, Lasse Münster, Suguru Ito, Leon Machtl, Sarah Zajusch, Giacomo Inzani, Ludwig Wittmann, Marlene Liebich, Robert Wallauer, Ulrich Höfer, Rupert Huber
Abstract: Dispersionless electronic bands lead to an extremely high density of states and suppressed kinetic energy, thereby increasing electronic correlations and instabilities that can shape emergent ordered states, such as excitonic, ferromagnetic, and superconducting phases. A flat band that extends over the entire momentum space and is well isolated from other dispersive bands is, therefore, particularly interesting. Here, the band structure of the van der Waals crystal NbOCl$_2$ is revealed by utilizing photoelectron momentum microscopy. We directly map out an electronic band that is flat throughout the entire Brillouin zone and features a width of only $\sim$100 meV. This band is well isolated from both the conduction and remote valence bands. Moreover, the quasiparticle band gap shows a high tunability upon the deposition of caesium atoms on the surface. By combining the single-particle band structure with the optical transmission spectrum, the optical gap is identified. The fully isolated flat band in a van der Waals crystal provides a qualitatively new testbed for exploring flat-band physics.

Title: AI-enhanced discovery and accelerated synthesis of metal phosphosulfides
Authors: Javier Sanz Rodrigo, Nicholas A. Kryger-Nelson, Lena A. Mittmann, Eugène Bertin, Ivano E. Castelli, Andrea Crovetto
Abstract: Metal phosphosulfides have emerged as unique multifunctional materials, but they present unique synthesis challenges compared to more established material classes such as oxides and nitrides. As a consequence, experimental development and theoretical understanding of phosphosulfides have focused on individual compounds rather than on accelerated broad-range exploration. In this work, we first evaluate the synthesizability and band gaps of 909 hypothetical ternary phosphosulfides by density functional theory. We find 19 previously unknown thermodynamically stable compounds, including the first Si- and Ge-based phosphosulfides. For rapid band gap prediction, we then develop a multi-fidelity machine learning model to translate semilocal density functional theory band gaps into experimentally calibrated band gaps. Importantly, we extend the accelerated material development workflow to the experimental domain by demonstrating a route to high-throughput synthesis and characterization of virtually any phosphosulfide material system. The method is based on thin-film combinatorial libraries and yields over 100 unique compositions in each experiment, enabling us to synthesize four distinct phosphosulfide compounds in only four combinatorial experiments without prior synthesis recipes and without compromising on material quality. Thus, we argue that accelerated materials development workflows combining theory, artificial intelligence, synthesis, and characterization can be viable even for experimentally challenging inorganic materials.

Title: Control of helix orientation in chiral magnets via lateral confinement
Authors: Maurice Colling, Mariia Stepanova, Mario Hentschel, Somasree Bhattacharjee, Erik Lysne, Kasper Hunnestad, Naoya Kanazawa, Yoshinori Tokura, Jan Masell, Dennis Meier
Abstract: Helimagnetic materials offer a versatile platform for spin-based device concepts owing to their long-range, tunable spiral order. Here, we demonstrate controlled manipulation of the helimagnetic propagation vector q by geometrical confinement, using FeGe as a model DMI-driven chiral magnet. Micromagnetic simulations based on the nonlinear sigma model reveal that open boundaries give rise to a chiral surface twist acting as an effective surface anisotropy, which dictates the preferred helix orientation in the absence of magnetostatic shape effects. This geometry-induced anisotropy is quantitatively captured by an analytical model derived from the DMI boundary condition. Magnetic force microscopy measurements on focused-ion-beam structured FeGe confirm the predicted orientation behavior and establish geometry-controlled helimagnetic order as a robust, tunable mechanism for steering DMI-stabilized spin-spiral states. The concept provides a general route toward device-level control of chiral magnetic order in of non-centrosymmetric systems.

Title: Shear-Induced Wobbling and Motility Suppression in Swimming Bacteria
Authors: Wei Feng, Fanglong Dang, Hao Luo, Alan C. H. Tsang, Yanan Liu, Guangyin Jing
Abstract: The intricate wobbling motion of flagellated bacteria, characterized by the periodic precession of the cell body, is a determinant factor in their motility and navigation within complex fluid environments. While well-studied in quiescent fluids, bacterial wobbling under ubiquitous flow conditions remains unexplored. In this work, we investigate the wobbling dynamics of \textit{Escherichia coli} swimming near surfaces under steady shear flow. Our experiments reveal that the wobbling amplitude intensifies with flow strength before reaching a plateau, with this amplification exhibiting a strong dependence on the swimming orientation relative to the flow direction. It turns out that the enhanced wobbling remains governed by the misalignment between the cell body and the flagellar bundle. Furthermore, we observe that the wobbling frequency increases monotonically with flow strength, and that shorter bacteria exhibit more pronounced variations in both amplitude and frequency. By linking the wobbling motion to the intrinsic body-flagella misalignment, we attribute the flow-enhanced precession to a combination of shear- and chirality-induced torques acting on the flexible flagellar hook. This mechanical coupling ultimately suppresses the net migration velocity as the flow rate increases. These findings elucidate the elastohydrodynamic mechanisms by which shear flow modifies bacterial locomotion near surfaces, with implications for microbial transport in physiological and ecological environments.

Title: Engineering the electronic structure of TiO$_2$ by transition metal doping: A First Principles DFT Study
Authors: Vikash Mishra, Shashi Pandey, Swaroop Ganguly, Alok Shukla
Abstract: By means of first-principles density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, we perform a comparative analysis of the electronic and magnetic properties of transition metal-doped TiO$_2$. The electronic band gaps of Ti$_x$M$_{1-x}$O$_2$, where M represents 3d-transition metals such as Sc, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn have been determined using the PBE functional within the generalized-gradient approximation (GGA) scheme, and also using the hybrid HSE06 functional. In the context of pure TiO$_2$, the partial density of states (PDOS) reveals that the electronic band gap emerges between the O-2p and Ti-3d orbitals. It is suggested that the Ti-3d ($t_{2g}$) states play a more prominent role in bonding compared to the Ti-3d ($e_g$) states. We performed DFT calculations to investigate the impact of doping with other 3d transition metal atoms, leading to the emergence of impurity states within the band gap. The hybridization between the oxygen 2p orbitals and the titanium 3d orbitals in TiO$_2$ is altered by the introduction of doping with 3d transition metals because of the change in the oxidation state of titanium, shifting from solely 4+ to a combination of 4+ and 3+ states. The calculation of spin-polarized density demonstrates the emergence of ferromagnetic properties, particularly in titanium dioxide doped with chromium (Cr), manganese (Mn), and iron (Fe) with large magnetic moments. Our work demonstrates the significant impact of doping transition metals on TiO$_2$, allowing for the precise manipulation of electrical and magnetic properties, and thus holds great potential for the development of spin-based memory devices with possible neuromorphic applications.

Title: Controlling Mixed Mo/MoS$_2$ Domains on Si by Molecular Beam Epitaxy for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction
Authors: Eunseo Jeon, Vincent Masika Peheliwa, Marie Hrůzová Kratochvílová, Tim Verhagen, Yong-Kul Lee
Abstract: Molybdenum disulfide (MoS$_2$) is a prototypical layered transition-metal dichalcogenide whose electrocatalytic performance is governed by a delicate balance between crystallinity, defect density, and electronic conductivity. Here we report a systematic molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) study in which annealing temperature, deposition cycle number, and Mo/S thickness ratio were independently varied to control the structural and electronic properties of MoS$_2$ thin films. The successful epitaxial growth of atomically uniform MoS$_2$ directly on Si substrates enables strong interfacial coupling and efficient charge transfer, offering a viable route toward semiconductor-integrated catalytic architectures. X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray absorption analyses reveal that higher annealing temperatures and excessive deposition cycles enhance crystallinity but reduce edge-site density and electrical conductivity, leading to diminished hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity. In contrast, intermediate cycle numbers and sulfur-deficient growth conditions yield heterostructures composed of MoS$_2$ with residual metallic Mo and sulfur vacancies, which activate otherwise inert basal planes while providing conductive pathways. These defect-engineered films deliver the best catalytic performance, achieving overpotentials as low as -0.33 V at -10 mA cm$^{-2}$, enlarged electrochemical surface area (ECSA) up to 8.0 cm$^2$, and mass-based turnover frequencies exceeding 23 mmol H$_2$ g$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$, more than double those of stoichiometric counterparts. Our findings establish sulfur stoichiometry and growth kinetics as powerful levers to tune the interplay between structural order and catalytic activity in MBE-grown MoS$_2$ and point toward a broader strategy for engineering layered catalysts at the atomic scale.

Title: Negative Pressure and Cavitation Dynamics in Plant-like Structures
Authors: Olivier Vincent
Abstract: It is well known that a solid (e.g. wood or rubber) can be put under tensile stress by pulling on it. Once a critical stress is overcome, the solid breaks, leaving an empty space. Similarly, due to internal cohesion, a liquid can withstand tension (i.e. negative pressure), up to a critical point where a large bubble spontaneously forms, releasing the tension and leaving a void (the bubble). This process is known as cavitation. While water at negative pressure is metastable, such a state can be long-lived. In fact, water under tension is found routinely in the plant kingdom, as a direct effect of dehydration, e.g. by evaporation. In this chapter, we provide a brief overview of occurrences of water stress and cavitation in plants, then use a simple thermodynamic and fluid mechanical framework to describe the basic physics of water stress and cavitation. We focus specifically on situations close to those in plants, that is water at negative pressure nested within a structure that is solid, but porous and potentially deformable. We also discuss insights from these simple models as well as from experiments with artificial structures mimicking some essential aspects of the structures found within plants.

Abstract: Despite major experimental progresses in time-resolved and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, a quantitative, microscopic framework for interpreting exciton-induced modifications of electronic band structures -- applicable even beyond the low-density limit -- is still lacking. Here we close this gap by introducing a unified approach that links the dynamics of coherent and incoherent excitons to distinct and experimentally observable excitonic sidebands. Our central result is a general, first-principles formula for time-resolved photoemission spectra, applicable across a broad range of temperatures, excitation densities, and pump-probe delays. This advance provides a predictive tool for quantitatively tracking excitonic dynamics in complex materials.

Title: Zoology of Altermagnetic-type Non-collinear Magnets on the Maple Leaf Lattice
Authors: Pratyay Ghosh, Ronny Thomale
Abstract: We define unconventional non-collinear magnetic ground states on the maple leaf lattice (MLL) distinguished by the selective breaking or preservation of time reversal ($\mathcal{T}$) and parity ($\mathcal{P}$). Depending on the nature of $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-breaking, linear spin-wave theory reveals momentum-dependent non-relativistic magnon spin splitting at different high symmetry points in the Brillouin zone. From a mean-field analysis of the Hubbard model at weak coupling, we reveal itinerant $\mathcal{P}$-preserving $q=0$ altermagnetic (A$l$M)-type order, while we expect $\mathcal{P}$-broken canted-$120^\circ$ A$l$M-type order at strong coupling. Our findings establish the MLL as a prime platform for exploring phase transitions and frustration phenomena emanating from competing non-collinear A$l$M-type orders.

Title: One-dimensional asymmetrically interacting quantum droplets in Bose-Bose mixtures
Authors: Huiyun Xiao, Xinran Zhang, Junli Liu, Xucong Du, Xiao-Long Chen, Yunbo Zhang
Abstract: We theoretically investigate ground-state properties and collective excitations of one-dimensional quantum droplets in asymmetric Bose-Bose mixtures with unequal intraspin interactions. Using the extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation supported by variational and sum-rule methods, we show that the intraspin interaction ratio substantially alters the droplet's density profile, driving a transition from Gaussian-like to flat-top shapes. By examining two experimentally relevant parameter regions, we analyze density profiles, radii, peak densities, and excitation spectra to distinguish quantum phases and to depict phase diagrams in the space of asymmetric interaction ratio and total atom number. We carefully study the frequencies of both well-known dipole and breathing modes and less-explored spin dipole and spin breathing modes. The breathing mode frequency decreases monotonically with interaction ratio, approaching asymptotically the result of a conventional weakly interacting Bose gas. It varies non-monotonically with total atom number, peaking at a critical point that highlights the crucial role of quantum fluctuations. In contrast, spin modes display distinct temporal spin density distributions and reveal in-phase and out-of-phase relative dynamics between components. Their frequencies depend instead monotonically on the interaction ratio and atom number. Our results provide a comprehensive understanding of asymmetric quantum droplets and link to experimentally accessible regimes in ultracold $^{39}$K atomic gases.

Title: Non-Abelian fusion and braiding in many-body parton states
Authors: Koyena Bose
Abstract: Fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states host fractionally charged anyons with exotic exchange statistics. Of particular interest are FQH phases supporting non-Abelian anyons, which can encode topologically protected quantum information. In this work, we construct quasihole bases for a broad family of non-Abelian FQH states using parton wave functions, which reproduces the fusion-space dimensionality expected from their underlying conformal field theory, consistent with level-rank duality across the parton family. As an application, we numerically compute braiding matrices for representative parton states for large systems, providing a general framework for diagnosing non-Abelian characteristics in candidate FQH states.

Title: Pressure-induced superconductivity in topological insulator Ge2Bi2Te5 and the evolution with Mn doping
Authors: Shangjie Tian, Qi Wang, Yuqing Cao, Ying Ma, Xiao Zhang, Yanpeng Qi, Hechang Lei, Shouguo Wang
Abstract: Introducing superconductivity (SC) or magnetism into topological insulators (TIs) can give rise to novel quantum states and exotic physical phenomena. Here, we report a high-pressure transport study on the TI Ge2Bi2Te5 and its Mn-doped counterparts. The application of pressure induces a SC in Ge2Bi2Te5, which shows a dome-shape phase diagram with the maximum Tc of 7.6 K at 23 GPa. Doping Mn into Ge2Bi2Te5 introduces an antiferromagnetic order at ambient pressure and strongly weakens the pressure-induced SC, demonstrating that magnetism and SC compete in this material system. Present study provides a new platform for investigating the interplay among band topology, magnetism, and SC.

Title: Superconducting density of states and vortex lattice of LaRu$_2$P$_2$ observed by Scanning Tunneling Spectroscopy
Authors: Marta Fernández-Lomana, Paula Obladen Aguilera, Beilun Wu, Edwin Herrera, Hermann Suderow, Isabel Guillamón
Abstract: We provide the superconducting density of states of the iron based superconductor LaRu2P2 (Tc= 4.1 K), measured using millikelvin Scanning Tunneling Microscopy. From the tunneling conductance, we extract a density of states which shows the opening of a s-wave single superconducting gap. The temperature dependence of the gap also follows BCS theory. Under magnetic fields, vortices present Caroli de Gennes Matricon states, although these are strongly broadened by defect scattering. From the vortex core size we obtain a superconducting coherence length of {\xi} = 50 nm, compatible with the value extracted from macroscopic Hc2 measurements. We discuss the comparison between s-wave LaRu2P2 and pnictide unconventional multiple gap and strongly correlated Fe based superconductors.

Title: Intermediate Field Spin(on) Dynamics in $α$-RuCl$_3$

Abstract: We present comprehensive inelastic neutron spectroscopic maps of the magnetic field-induced disordered phase of the Kitaev quantum spin liquid candidate material $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. For fields along both in-plane high-symmetry directions we observe that the spin excitation spectrum at and above a magnetic field of 8~T is gapped. Excitation modes then sharpen for increasing field but are consistently broader than experimental resolution even at 13.5~T. The out-of-plane dispersion diminishes in the 7-10~T regime, signifying enhanced two-dimensional behavior as the in-plane liquid correlations are established. In this regime, excitations are very broad and largely flat for all accessible energy-momenta, which is kinematically at odds with a magnon-decay picture. By contrast, a continuum of fractionalized excitations naturally yields a broad continuum response, which crucially may be accompanied by sharper modes of bound states of fractionalized excitations. Their damping by the continuum accounts for the observed spectral broadening and field dependence. Our results provide strong evidence for the existence of fractionalized excitations in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ in a magnetic field.

Title: Twisted bilayer graphene from first-principles: structural and electronic properties
Authors: Albert Zhu, Daniel Bennett, Daniel T. Larson, Mohammed M. Al Ezzi, Efstratios Manousakis, Efthimios Kaxiras
Abstract: We present a comprehensive first-principles study of twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) for a wide range of twist angles, with a focus on structural and electronic properties. By employing density functional theory (DFT) with an optimized local basis set, we simulate tBLG, obtaining fully relaxed commensurate structures for twist angles down to 0.987°. For all angles the lattice relaxation agrees well with continuum elastic models. For angles accessible to plane-wave DFT (VASP), we provide a detailed comparison with our local basis DFT (SIESTA) calculations, demonstrating excellent agreement in both the atomic and electronic structure. The dependence of the Fermi velocity and band width on the twist angle shows qualitative agreement with results from an `exact' $\mathbf{k \cdot p}$ continuum model, but reveals a small twist angle offset. Additionally, we provide details of the low-energy wavefunction character, band inversion and symmetries. Our results provide an ab initio reference point for the microscopic structure and electronic properties of tBLG which will serve as the foundation for future studies incorporating many-body effects.

Title: Charting the Landscape of Oxygen Ion Conductors: A 60-Year Dataset with Interpretable Regression Models
Authors: Seong-Hoon Jang, Shin Kiyohara, Hitoshi Takamura, Yu Kumagai
Abstract: Oxygen ion conductors are indispensable materials for such as solid oxide fuel cells, sensors, and membranes. Despite extensive research across diverse structural families, systematic data enabling comparative analysis remain scarce. Here, we present a curated dataset of oxygen ion conductors compiled from $84$ experimental reports spanning $60$ years, covering $483$ materials. Each record includes activation energy ($E_a$) and prefactor ($A$) derived from Arrhenius plots, alongside detailed metadata on structure, composition, measurement method, and data source. When the original papers derive these using an erroneous Arrhenius equation $\sigma_T=A\exp{\left(-\frac{E_a}{RT}\right)}$, where ($\sigma_T$ is the oxygen ion conductivity at temperature $T$ and $R$ is the gas constant), we replotted these using the correct one, $\sigma_{T}T=A\exp{\left(-\frac{E_a}{RT}\right)}$. To illustrate how the database can be used, we constructed interpretable regression models for predicting oxygen ionic conductivity. Two symbolic regression models for E_a and A suggest that oxygen ion transport is primarily governed by local coordination environment and the electrostatic interactions, respectively. This dataset establishes a reliable foundation for data-driven discovery and predictive modeling of next-generation oxygen ion conductors.

Title: Statistical mechanics of a 2D material in a gas reservoir
Authors: Moon-ki Choi, Ellad B Tadmor
Abstract: We derive and validate a partition function for low-dimensional systems interacting with a heat bath, addressing the general issue of thermodynamic modeling of nanoscale systems. In contrast to bulk systems in the canonical (NVT) ensemble where the partition function is solely determined by the Hamiltonian of the system and the temperature of the heat bath, our formulation demonstrates that accounting for the interactions with the heat bath is essential for describing the statistical mechanics of low-dimensional materials. To validate our theoretical findings, we develop a molecular dynamics (MD) algorithm for directly modeling the heat bath as a gas reservoir. We first validate our approach using a 1D harmonic oscillator, calculating its length distribution through explicit numerical integration and confirming these results with MD simulations. We then extend our method to investigate the out-of-plane fluctuations of a 2D graphene monolayer immersed in a gas at finite temperature and pressure. Comparisons with conventional NVT ensemble simulations controlled by a thermostat reveal that environmental interactions significantly influence the properties of the 2D material system.

Title: Magnetosomes in Nature, Biomedicine and Physics
Authors: N.A. Usov
Abstract: Magnetotactic bacteria synthesize linear chains of magnetite nanoparticles within their bodies, which allow the bacteria to navigate the Earth's magnetic field in search of the best habitat. Biogenic magnetite particles, called magnetosomes, are very promising for use in biomedicine. Magnetosome chains have also been found in ancient fossils and sediments. The study of magnetofossils provides valuable information about the Earth's biological past. The presence of biogenic magnetite in ancient rock samples can be detected by measuring ferromagnetic resonance spectra, first-order magnetization reversal curves, or quasi-static hysteresis loops. Theoretical analyses of these experiments generally assume that magnetosomes are spherical nanoparticles, although the shape of some types of magnetosomes is close to spheroidal one. In this work, simple formulas for describing the magneto-dipole interaction of oriented spheroids are obtained and quasi-static hysteresis loops of randomly oriented magnetosome chain assembly consisting of elongated spheroids are calculated.

Title: Interaction Induced Magnetotransport in a 2D Dirac-Heavy Hole Hybrid Band System
Authors: G. M. Gusev, A. D. Levin, V. A. Chitta, Z. D. Kvon, N. N. Mikhailov
Abstract: While electron-electron (e-e) interactions are known to influence resistivity in non-Galilean invariant two-dimensional (2D) systems, their effect on magnetotransport is not fully understood. Conventional models for simple bands often predict a vanishing magnetoresistivity from e-e interactions alone. In this work, we investigate magnetotransport in a gapless 6.3 nm HgTe quantum well, a hybrid 2D band system that hosts coexisting holes with both linear (Dirac-like) and parabolic energy bands. Focusing on the high temperature regime where particle-particle collisions dominate scattering, we observe significant corrections to both the magnetoresistivity and the Hall effect. The high temperature transport coefficients are in good agreement with the theoretical model describing transport in massive-massless fermion mixtures governed by a frictional mechanism and intervalley scattering. Our findings provide strong experimental validation for this theoretical framework, demonstrating that collisions between particles with different dispersions are a key mechanism governing magnetotransport in hybrid band semimetals.

Title: Universal classical and quantum fluctuations in the large deviations of current of noisy quantum systems: The case of QSSEP and QSSIP
Authors: Mathias Albert, Denis Bernard, Tony Jin, Stefano Scopa, Shiyi Wei
Abstract: We study the fluctuation statistics of integrated currents in noisy quantum diffusive systems, focusing on the Quantum Symmetric Simple Exclusion and Inclusion Processes (QSSEP/QSSIP). These one-dimensional fermionic (QSSEP) and bosonic (QSSIP) models feature stochastic nearest-neighbor hopping driven by Brownian noise, together with boundary injection and removal processes. They provide solvable microscopic settings in which quantum coherence coexists with diffusion. Upon noise averaging, their dynamics reduce to those of the classical SSEP/SSIP. We show that the cumulant generating function of the integrated current, at large scales, obeys a large deviation principle. To leading order in system size and for each noise realization, it converges to that of the corresponding classical process, establishing a classical typicality of current fluctuations in these noisy quantum systems. We further demonstrate a direct connection with Macroscopic Fluctuation Theory (MFT), showing that the large-scale equations satisfied by biased quantum densities coincide with the steady-state Hamilton equations of MFT, thereby providing a microscopic quantum justification of the MFT framework in these models. Finally, we identify the leading finite-size corrections to the current statistics. We show the existence of subleading contributions of purely quantum origin, which are absent in the corresponding classical setting, and provide their explicit expressions for the second and third current cumulants. These quantum corrections are amenable to direct experimental or numerical verification, provided sufficient control over the noise realizations can be achieved. Their presence points toward the necessity of a quantum extension of Macroscopic Fluctuation Theory.

Title: Doping-dependent orbital magnetism in Chromium pnictides
Authors: Henri G. Mendonça, George B. Martins, Lauro B. Braz
Abstract: We present results for the phase diagram of the parent compound LaCrAsO under electron doping using the matrix random-phase approximation. At low doping levels, the system stabilizes an antiferromagnetic state in which different Cr sublattices carry opposite spins, consistent with experimental observations. As the doping concentration increases, a stripe-type antiferromagnetic phase becomes favored. At even higher doping, the system repeats the two former magnetic states, but with incommensurate magnetic ordering vectors. The commensurate magnetic phases are associated with more localized electrons in the Cr $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital, whereas the incommensurate phases are linked to the $d_{xy}$ orbital, whose stronger overlap favors itinerant-electron magnetism.

Title: Strong Spin-Lattice Interaction in Layered Antiferromagnetic CrCl$_\textrm{3}$

Abstract: Understanding the coupling between lattice vibrations and magnetic order is crucial for controlling properties of two-dimensional magnetic materials. Here, we investigate the vibrational properties of bulk and thick-flake CrCl$_\textrm{3}$ using polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy, complemented by photoluminescence, photoluminescence excitation, and optical absorption measurements. Symmetry analysis, supported by first-principles phonon calculations, enables the unambiguous assignment of all eight Raman-active modes, four $\textrm{A}_\textrm{g}$ and four $\textrm{E}_\textrm{g}$, previously predicted only theoretically. Excitation-energy-dependent measurements reveal that the strong enhancement of selected phonon modes originates primarily from interference effects rather than resonant Raman scattering. Temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy further reveals pronounced signatures of spin-phonon coupling across the transition from a fully antiferromagnetic phase, through an intermediate regime with local, domain-like ferromagnetic order, to the paramagnetic phase, accompanied by a clear rhombohedral-to-monoclinic structural transition. Together, these results demonstrate how lattice, electronic, and magnetic degrees of freedom collectively govern the Raman response of CrCl$_\textrm{3}$.

Title: Connecting bond switching to fracture toughness of calcium aluminosilicate glasses
Authors: Sidsel Mulvad Johansen, Tao Du, Johan F. S. Christensen, Anders K. R. Christensen, Xuan Ge, Theany To, Lars R. Jensen, Morten M. Smedskjaer
Abstract: Fracture toughness is a critical mechanical property of glasses, but a detailed understanding of its link to composition and structure is still missing. Here, focusing on the industrially important family of calcium aluminosilicate glasses, we measure the fracture toughness of two glass series using the single-edge precracked beam method, one based on tectosilicate compositions with varying silica contents and the other covering both percalcic and peraluminous compositions with varying Al/Ca ratio. To elucidate the structural origins of the variation in fracture toughness, we perform X-ray total scattering measurements and molecular dynamics simulations. Our findings show that local coordination changes of especially Al atoms, so-called bond switching, feature an overall positive correlation with fracture toughness. We also compare this variation with that in other mechanical properties, including elastic moduli, hardness, and crack initiation resistance. We find that various structural aspects need to be considered to describe and understand the mechanical properties of calcium aluminosilicate glasses.

Title: Atomically Resolved Acoustic Dynamics Coupled with Magnetic Order in a van der Waals Antiferromagnet

G. Santos, Ting Cao, Jiun-Haw Chu, Stephan O. Hruszkewycz, Nuh Gedik, Di Xiao, Hyunjung Kim, Xiaodong Xu, Haidan Wen
Abstract: Magnetoelastic coupling in van der Waals (vdW) magnetic materials enables a unique interplay between the spin and lattice degrees of freedom. Characterizing the elastic responses with atomic and femtosecond resolution across the magnetic transition is essential for guiding the design of magnetically tunable actuators and strain-mediated spintronic devices. Here, ultrafast x-ray diffraction employed at a free-electron laser reveals that the atomic displacements, wave vectors, and dispersion relations of acoustic phonon modes in a vdW antiferromagnet FePS$_3$ are coupled with the magnetic order, by tracking both in-plane and out-of-plane Bragg peaks upon optical excitation across the Néel temperature (T$_N$). One transverse mode shows that a quasi-out-of-plane atomic displacement undergoes a significant directional change across T$_N$. Its quasi-in-plane wave vector is derived by the comparison between the measured sound velocity and the first-principles calculations. The other transverse mode is an interlayer shear acoustic mode whose amplitude is strongly enhanced in the antiferromagnetic phase, exhibiting eight times stronger amplitude than the longitudinal acoustic mode below T$_N$. The atomically resolved characterization of acoustic phonon dynamics that couple with magnetic ordering opens opportunities for harnessing unique magnetoelastic coupling in vdW magnets on ultrafast timescales.

Title: Boundary critical phenomena in the quantum Ashkin-Teller model
Authors: Yifan Liu, Natalia Chepiga, Yoshiki Fukusumi, Masaki Oshikawa
Abstract: We investigate the boundary critical phenomena of the one-dimensional quantum Ashkin-Teller model using boundary conformal field theory and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations. Based on the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-orbifold of the $c=1$ compactified boson boundary conformal field theory, we construct microscopic lattice boundary terms that renormalize to the stable conformal boundary conditions,, utilizing simple current extensions and the underlying $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ symmetry to explicitly characterize the four-state Potts point. We validate these theoretical identifications via finite-size spectroscopy of the lattice energy spectra, confirming their consistency with $D_4$ symmetry and Kramers-Wannier duality. Finally, we discuss the boundary renormalization group flows among these identified fixed points to propose a global phase diagram for the boundary criticality.

Title: Tunable Edelstein effect in intrinsic two-dimensional ferroelectric metal PtBi$_{2}$
Authors: Weiyi Pan, Jaroslav Fabian
Abstract: The Edelstein effect, which enables charge-to-spin conversion and is therefore highly promising for future spintronic devices, can be realized and non-volatilely manipulated in ferroelectric materials owing to their broken inversion symmetry and switchable polarization states. To date, most ferroelectric systems reported to exhibit the Edelstein effect are semiconductors, requiring extrinsic doping for functionality. In contrast, the Edelstein effect has rarely been reported in metallic ferroelectric systems, where doping is unnecessary. Using first-principles calculations, we predict that a pronounced Edelstein effect can be realized in the recently proposed intrinsic two-dimensional ferroelectric metal PtBi$_{2}$ monolayer, where the sign of the Edelstein coefficient is coupled to the direction of ferroelectric polarization through the polarization-switching-induced reversal of spin textures, thereby enabling non-volatile control of charge-spin conversion. The Edelstein effect reaches a magnitude of $10^{11}~\hbar/(\textup{A} \cdot \textup{cm})$, which is sizable compared to previously reported ferroelectric systems. Microscopically, the Edelstein effect in a PtBi$_2$ monolayer originates from competing contributions of inner Rashba-like electron pockets and outer hole pockets with opposite signs; an upward shift of the Fermi level alters their balance and can reverse the sign of the Edelstein effect. Upon applying biaxial strain, the Fermi-surface electronic structure is strongly modified, resulting in a pronounced change of the Edelstein effect: a 2 \% compressive strain suppresses the Edelstein effect by about 50 \%. Our results not only identify a promising material platform for tunable charge-spin conversion but also provide new insights into the functional potential of metallic ferroelectric systems.

Title: Fractional Order Thermo Piezoelectric Modelling of qP Wave Interaction and Energy Partition at Welded Interface
Authors: Hriticka Dhiman, Soniya Chaudhary
Abstract: An analytical model is developed to investigate the interaction of quasi longitudinal (qP) waves with a perfectly bonded interface between a thermo piezoelectric half space and a functionally graded piezoelectric half space. The formulation is based on the fractional order Lord Shulman generalized thermoelasticity theory, which provides an enhanced description of coupled thermo electro mechanical wave behaviour. Rotational effects are incorporated into the constitutive relations and equations of motion for both media, while the lower half space is assumed to be subjected to initial stress. Closed form solutions for reflection and transmission coefficients are obtained, together with associated energy partition factors, allowing a comprehensive assessment of interface wave characteristics. Numerical simulations carried out using MATLAB demonstrate that the reflection and transmission responses are strongly influenced by initial stress, fractional order parameter, and thermal relaxation time. The calculated energy ratios of scattered waves satisfy the energy conservation condition, confirming the mathematical consistency of the formulation. The findings of this study are relevant to the design and analysis of smart sensors, rotating and aerospace structures, vibration control systems, and energy harvesting devices employing functionally graded thermo piezoelectric materials under fractional order effects.

Title: D-MODD: A Diffusion Model of Opinion Dynamics Derived from Online Data
Authors: Ixandra Achitouv, David Chavalarias
Abstract: We present the first empirical derivation of a continuous-time stochastic model for real-world opinion dynamics. Using longitudinal social-media data to infer users opinion on a binary climate-change topic, we reconstruct the underlying drift and diffusion functions governing individual opinion updates. We show that the observed dynamics are well described by a Langevin-type stochastic differential equation, with persistent attractor basins and spatially sensitive drift and diffusion terms. The empirically inferred one-step transition probabilities closely reproduce the transition kernel generated from the D-MODD model we introduce. Our results provide the first direct evidence that online opinion dynamics on a polarized topic admit a Markovian description at the operator level, with empirically reconstructed transition kernels accurately reproduced by a data-driven Langevin model, bridging sociophysics, behavioral data, and complex-systems modeling.

Title: Quantum Cellular Automata on a Dual-Species Rydberg Processor
Authors: Ryan White, Vikram Ramesh, Alexander Impertro, Shraddha Anand, Francesco Cesa, Giuliano Giudici, Thomas Iadecola, Hannes Pichler, Hannes Bernien
Abstract: As quantum devices scale to larger and larger sizes, a significant challenge emerges in scaling their coherent controls accordingly. Quantum cellular automata (QCAs) constitute a promising framework that bypasses this control problem: universal dynamics can be achieved using only a static qubit array and global control operations. We realize QCAs on a dual-species Rydberg array of rubidium and cesium atoms, leveraging independent global control of each species to perform a myriad of quantum protocols. With simple pulse sequences, we explore many-body dynamics and generate a variety of entangled states, including GHZ states, 96.7(1.7)%-fidelity Bell states, 17-qubit cluster states, and high-connectivity graph states. The versatility and scalability of QCAs offers compelling routes for scaling quantum information systems with global controls, as well as new perspectives on quantum many-body dynamics.

Title: Multi-invariants in stabilizer states
Authors: Sriram Akella, Abhijit Gadde, Jay Pandey
Abstract: Multipartite entanglement is a natural generalization of bipartite entanglement, but is relatively poorly understood. In this paper, we develop tools to calculate a class of multipartite entanglement measures - known as multi-invariants - for stabilizer states. We give an efficient numerical algorithm that computes multi-invariants for stabilizer states. For tripartite stabilizer states, we also obtain an explicit formula for any multi-invariant using the GHZ-extraction theorem. We then present a counting argument that calculates any Coxeter multi-invariant of a q-partite stabilizer state. We conjecture a closed form expression for the same. We uncover hints of an interesting connection between multi-invariants, stabilizer states and topology. We show how our formulas are further simplified for a restricted class of stabilizer states that appear as ground states of interesting models like the toric code and the X-cube model.

Title: Vacuum structure of gapped QCD$_2$ theories from the infinite Hamiltonian lattice
Authors: Ross Dempsey, Anna-Maria E. Glück, Silviu S. Pufu, Benjamin T. Søgaard
Abstract: Gapped two-dimensional gauge theories with massless fermions generically have rich vacuum structures consisting of many degenerate vacua related by the action of topological line operators. The algebra of such operators has been used to calculate ratios of vacuum expectation values of local operators and to predict nontrivial particle-soliton degeneracies. In this paper, we use recently-developed tensor network methods to study several examples of such theories via their Hamiltonian lattice descriptions. Our lattice results agree with all previously-made predictions. Furthermore, we identify the lattice strong-coupling states that can be adiabatically continued to the degenerate vacua in the continuum limit. We conjecture a procedure, referred to as a lattice decay rule, for how this identification works in general. This rule allows us to compute the continuum vacuum degeneracy by studying the lattice Hamiltonian in the strong-coupling limit.

Title: Experimental observation of conformal field theory spectra
Authors: Xiangkai Sun, Yuan Le, Stephen Naus, Richard Bing-Shiun Tsai, Lewis R. B. Picard, Sara Murciano, Michael Knap, Jason Alicea, Manuel Endres
Abstract: Conformal field theories (CFTs) feature prominently in high-energy physics, statistical mechanics, and condensed matter. For example, CFTs govern emergent universal properties of systems tuned to quantum phase transitions, including their entanglement, correlations, and low-energy excitation spectra. Much of the rich structure predicted by CFTs nevertheless remains unobserved in experiment. Here we directly observe the energy excitation spectra of emergent CFTs at quantum phase transitions -- recovering universal energy ratios characteristic of the underlying field theories. Specifically, we develop and implement a modulation technique to resolve a Rydberg chain's finite-size spectra, variably tuned to quantum phase transitions described by either Ising or tricritical Ising CFTs. We also employ local control to distinguish parities of excitations under reflection and, in the tricritical Ising chain, to induce transitions between distinct CFT spectra associated with changing boundary conditions. By utilizing a variant of the modulation technique, we furthermore study the dynamical structure factor of the critical system, which is closely related to the correlation of an underlying Ising conformal field. Our work not only probes the emergence of CFT features in a quantum simulator, but also provides a technique for diagnosing a priori unknown universality classes in future experiments.

Title: Active learning for photonics
Authors: Ryan Lopez, Charlotte Loh, Rumen Dangovski, Marin Soljačić
Abstract: Active learning for photonic crystals explores the integration of analytic approximate Bayesian last layer neural networks (LL-BNNs) with uncertainty-driven sample selection to accelerate photonic band gap prediction. We employ an analytic LL-BNN formulation, corresponding to the infinite Monte Carlo sample limit, to obtain uncertainty estimates that are strongly correlated with the true predictive error on unlabeled candidate structures. These uncertainty scores drive an active learning strategy that prioritizes the most informative simulations during training. Applied to the task of predicting band gap sizes in two-dimensional, two-tone photonic crystals, our approach achieves up to a 2.6x reduction in required training data compared to a random sampling baseline while maintaining predictive accuracy. The efficiency gains arise from concentrating computational resources on high uncertainty regions of the design space rather than sampling uniformly. Given the substantial cost of full band structure simulations, especially in three dimensions, this data efficiency enables rapid and scalable surrogate modeling. Our results suggest that analytic LL-BNN based active learning can substantially accelerate topological optimization and inverse design workflows for photonic crystals, and more broadly, offers a general framework for data efficient regression across scientific machine learning domains.

Title: Does Gravity Care About Electric Charge? A Minimalist Model and Experimental Test
Authors: Renato Vieira dos Santos
Abstract: Does gravity care about electric charge? Precision tests of the weak equivalence principle achieve remarkable sensitivity but deliberately minimize electric charge on test masses, leaving this fundamental question experimentally open. We present a minimalist framework coupling electromagnetism to linearized gravity through conservation of a complex charge-mass current, predicting charge-dependent violations $\Delta a/g = \kappa(q/m)$. Remarkably, this prediction occupies unexplored experimental territory precisely because precision gravity tests avoid charge variation. We identify this as a significant gap and propose a modified torsion balance experiment where $q/m$ is treated as a controlled variable. Such an experiment could test whether gravitational acceleration depends on electric charge, probing physics in genuinely new parameter space. This work exemplifies how theoretical minimalism can reveal overlooked opportunities in fundamental physics.

Title: Reducing TLS loss in tantalum CPW resonators using titanium sacrificial layers
Authors: Zachary Degnan, Chun-Ching Chiu, Yi-Hsun Chen, David Sommers, Leonid Abdurakhimov, Lihuang Zhu, Arkady Fedorov, Peter Jacobson
Abstract: We demonstrate a substantial reduction in two-level system loss in tantalum coplanar waveguide resonators fabricated on high-resistivity silicon substrates through the use of an ultrathin titanium sacrificial layer. A 0.2nm titanium film, deposited atop pre-sputtered {\alpha}-tantalum, acts as a solid-state oxygen getter that chemically modifies the native Ta oxide at the metal-air interface. After device fabrication, the titanium layer is removed using buffered oxide etchant, leaving behind a chemically reduced Ta oxide surface. Subsequent high-vacuum annealing further suppresses two-level system loss. Resonators treated with this process exhibit internal quality factors Qi exceeding an average of 1.5 million in the single-photon regime across ten devices, over three times higher than otherwise identical devices lacking the titanium layer. These results highlight the critical role of interfacial oxide chemistry in superconducting loss and reinforce atomic-scale surface engineering as an effective approach to improving coherence in tantalum-based quantum circuits. The method is compatible with existing fabrication workflows applicable to tantalum films, offering a practical route to further extending T1 lifetimes in superconducting qubits.

Title: Gluing Randomness via Entanglement: Tight Bound from Second Rényi Entropy
Authors: Wonjun Lee, Hyukjoon Kwon, Gil Young Cho
Abstract: The efficient generation of random quantum states is a long-standing challenge, motivated by their diverse applications in quantum information processing tasks. In this work, we identify entanglement as the key resource that enables local random unitaries to generate global random states by effectively gluing randomness across the system. Specifically, we demonstrate that approximate random states can be produced from an entangled state $|\psi\rangle$ through the application of local random unitaries. We show that the resulting ensemble forms an approximate state design with an error saturating as $\Theta(e^{-\mathcal{N}_2(\psi)})$, where $\mathcal{N}_2(\psi)$ is the second Rényi entanglement entropy of $|\psi\rangle$. Furthermore, we prove that this tight bound also applies to the second Rényi entropy of coherence when the ensemble is constructed using coherence-free operations. These results imply that, when restricted to resource-free gates, the quality of the generated random states is determined entirely by the resource content of the initial state. Notably, we find that among all $\alpha$-Rényi entropeis, the second Rényi entropy yields the tightest bounds. Consequently, these second Rényi entropies can be interpreted as the maximal capacities for generating randomness using resource-free operations. Finally, moving beyond approximate state designs, we utilize this entanglement-assisted gluing mechanism to present a novel method for generating pseudorandom states in multipartite systems from a locally entangled state via pseudorandom unitaries in each of parties.

Abstract: Phase-field simulations are a practical but also expensive tool to calculate microstructural evolution. This work aims to compare explicit time integrators for a broad class of phase-field models involving coupling between the phase-field and concentration. Particular integrators are adapted to constraints on the phase-field as well as storage scheme implications. Reproducible benchmarks are defined with a focus on having exact sharp interface solutions, allowing for identification of dominant error terms. Speedups of 4 to 114 over the classic forward Euler integrator are achievable while still using a fully explicit scheme without appreciable accuracy loss. Application examples include final stage sintering with pores slowing down grain growth as they move and merge over time.

Title: Generalized Integrable Boundary States in XXZ and XYZ Spin Chains
Authors: Xin Qian, Xin Zhang
Abstract: We investigate integrable boundary states in the anisotropic Heisenberg chain under periodic or twisted boundary conditions, for both even and odd system lengths. Our work demonstrates that the concept of integrable boundary states can be readily generalized. For the XXZ spin chain, we present a set of factorized integrable boundary states using the KT-relation, and these states are also applicable to the XYZ chain. It is shown that a specific set of eigenstates of the transfer matrix can be selected by each boundary state, resulting in an explicit selection rule for the Bethe roots.

Title: Z2 Lattice Gauge Theory on Non-trivial Topology and Its Quantum Simulation
Authors: Jiaqi Hu, Shu Tian, Xiaopeng Cui, Rebing Wu, Man-Hong Yung, Yu Shi
Abstract: Wegner duality is essential for Z2 lattice gauge theory, yet the duality on non-trivial topologies has remained implicit. We extend Wegner duality to arbitrary topology and dimension, obtaining a new class of Ising models, in which topology is encoded in non-local domain-wall patterns. Without the overhead of gauge constraints, simulating this model on an L*L torus requires only L*L qubits with two-body couplings, halving the conventional four-body coupled 2L*L qubits, enabling full experimental realization of Z2 lattice gauge theory on near-term devices.

Title: Observation of polaritonic flat-band bound states in the continuum in a 2D magnet
Authors: Fuhuan Shen, Jiahao Ren, Zhiyi Yuan, Kai Wu, Sai Yan, Kunal Parasad, Hai Son Nguyen, Rui Su
Abstract: Flat-band bound states in the continuum (BICs) are topological states with suppressed group velocity and robustness against radiation loss, offering a powerful platform for the exploration of non-Hermitian, nonlinear, topological phenomena and device applications. Van der Waals (vdW) metasurfaces have recently emerged as promising candidates for sustaining BICs and hybridizing with material transitions. However, the realization of flat-band BICs remains elusive. Here, we experimentally demonstrate polaritonic high-order BICs on a wide-angle flat band utilizing a subwavelength metasurface made of a vdW magnet CrSBr. The large oscillator strength of direct excitons in CrSBr enables near ultrastrong coupling with BICs, leading to strongly suppressed polaritonic angular dispersions. Remarkably, second-order polaritonic BICs become flat-band across a wide angular range, with corresponding Q factors exceeding 1500. Additionally, we find that these polaritonic BICs vanish in the transverse magnetic configuration, while leading to fascinating surface hyperbolic exciton-polaritons within the Reststrahlen band. Our findings underscore CrSBr as an exceptional platform for exploring flat-band photonics and polaritonics, paving the new avenue for advances in next-generation optical and quantum technologies.

Title: Constrained Symplectic Quantization I: the Quantum Harmonic Oscillator
Authors: Martina Giachello, Francesco Scardino, Giacomo Gradenigo
Abstract: Symplectic quantization is a functional approach to quantum field theory that allows sampling of quantum fluctuations directly in Minkowski space-time by means of a generalized microcanonical ensemble similar to the one of the standard microcanonical approach to lattice field theory. In a previous paper we showed that, for an interacting scalar field theory in 1+1-dimensions, this formalism allows to capture numerically some crucial real-time features inaccessible to any Euclidean approach to lattice field theory. Yet, the new approach was plagued by two main limitations: an ill-defined non-interacting limit and the absence of a direct formal correspondence between its correlation functions and those generated by the Feynman path integral approach. In this paper, we introduce the new \emph{"constrained symplectic quantization"} approach, for which the perfect equivalence with the Feynman path integral is proved and which is perfectly well defined for the free theory. This new approach is characterized by the analytical continuation of all fields and of the action from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{C}$ and the presence of some constraints which guarantee the stability of the generalized Hamiltonian dynamics and the convergence of the corresponding generalized microcanonical partition function, hence the name of the theory. We show the application of this formalism to the quantum harmonic oscillator on a Minkowskian-time lattice, finding perfect agreement between one- and two-point numerical correlators and the exact quantum-mechanical results. We observe genuine real-time features such as the oscillatory propagator and the discrete excited-state energy spectrum. Our results provide strong numerical evidence that constrained symplectic quantization can sample real-time quantum-mechanical observables, offering a concrete route to overcome the limitations of Euclidean-time importance sampling.

Title: A Scalable Measure of Loss Landscape Curvature for Analyzing the Training Dynamics of LLMs
Authors: Dayal Singh Kalra, Jean-Christophe Gagnon-Audet, Andrey Gromov, Ishita Mediratta, Kelvin Niu, Alexander H Miller, Michael Shvartsman
Abstract: Understanding the curvature evolution of the loss landscape is fundamental to analyzing the training dynamics of neural networks. The most commonly studied measure, Hessian sharpness ($\lambda_{\max}^H$) -- the largest eigenvalue of the loss Hessian -- determines local training stability and interacts with the learning rate throughout training. Despite its significance in analyzing training dynamics, direct measurement of Hessian sharpness remains prohibitive for Large Language Models (LLMs) due to high computational cost. We analyze $\textit{critical sharpness}$ ($\lambda_c$), a computationally efficient measure requiring fewer than $10$ forward passes given the update direction $\Delta \mathbf{\theta}$. Critically, this measure captures well-documented Hessian sharpness phenomena, including progressive sharpening and Edge of Stability. Using this measure, we provide the first demonstration of these sharpness phenomena at scale, up to $7$B parameters, spanning both pre-training and mid-training of OLMo-2 models. We further introduce $\textit{relative critical sharpness}$ ($\lambda_c^{1\to 2}$), which quantifies the curvature of one loss landscape while optimizing another, to analyze the transition from pre-training to fine-tuning and guide data mixing strategies. Critical sharpness provides practitioners with a practical tool for diagnosing curvature dynamics and informing data composition choices at scale. More broadly, our work shows that scalable curvature measures can provide actionable insights for large-scale training.

Title: Measurement-Induced Phase Transitions in Informational Active Matter
Authors: Bryan VanSaders, Michel Fruchart, Vincenzo Vitelli
Abstract: Various biological and synthetic media out of equilibrium can be viewed as many-ratchet systems that rectify environmental noise through local measurements and information processing, like in Maxwell's prototypical demon. These systems pose a challenge to standard coarse-graining approaches because they are better described in terms of decision-making protocols similar to computer programs rather than force laws. Here, we study a many-body generalization of the Maxwell demon problem: a fluid composed of adaptive particles that achieve collective behavior by biasing noise-driven scattering events subject to measurements. Using a combination of information-theoretic, kinetic, and hydrodynamic tools, we elucidate how microscopic decision-making protocols, rather than microscopic forces, generate macroscopic active states sustained by continuous measurements. These include an informational version of flocking whose order parameter is bounded by the information measured, and the onset of which may be viewed as a measurement-induced phase transition. We find that the signature of such microscopic choices is an `informational activity' that selectively compresses phase space, without work, and causes deviations from equilibrium scaling with the magnitude of environmental noise. We envision applications to noise-induced patterning performed by collections of microrobots guided by reinforcement learning or programmable phoretic colloids in turbulent flows that exploit local measurements and control actions to counteract the scrambling of information by chaos.

Title: Bootstrapping, autonomous testing, and initialization system for Si/Si$_x$Ge$_{1-x}$ multi-quantum-dot devices
Authors: Tyler J. Kovach, Daniel Schug, M. A. Wolfe, E. R. MacQuarrie, Patrick J. Walsh, Owen M. Eskandari, Jared Benson, Mark Friesen, M. A. Eriksson, Justyna P. Zwolak
Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dot (QD) devices have become central to advancements in spin-based quantum computing. However, the increasing complexity of modern QD devices makes calibration and control -- particularly at elevated temperatures -- a bottleneck to progress, highlighting the need for robust and scalable autonomous solutions. A major hurdle arises from trapped charges within the oxide layers, which induce random offset voltage shifts on gate electrodes, with a standard deviation of approximately 83 mV of variation within state-of-the-art present-day devices. Efficient characterization and tuning of large arrays of QD qubits depend on choices of automated protocols. Here, we introduce a physically intuitive framework for a bootstrapping, autonomous testing, and initialization system (BATIS) designed to streamline QD device evaluation and calibration. BATIS navigates high-dimensional gate voltage spaces, automating essential steps such as leakage testing, formation of all current channels, and gate characterization in the presence of trapped charges. For forming the current channels, BATIS follows a non-standard approach that requires a single set of measurements regardless of the number of channels. Demonstrated at 1.3 K on a quad-QD Si/Si$_x$Ge$_{1-x}$ device, BATIS eliminates the need for deep cryogenic environments during initial device diagnostics, significantly enhancing scalability and reducing setup times. By requiring only minimal prior knowledge of the device architecture, BATIS represents a platform-agnostic solution, adaptable to various QD systems, which bridges a critical gap in QD autotuning.

Title: Nonreciprocity of hydrodynamic electron transport in noncentrosymmetric conductors
Authors: E. Kirkinis, L. Bonds, A. Levchenko, A. V. Andreev
Abstract: We show that the nonreciprocity of hydrodynamic electron transport in noncentrosymmetric conductors with broken time-reversal symmetry (TRS) is significantly enhanced compared to the disorder-dominated regime. This enhancement is caused by the linear dependence of the viscosity of the electron liquid on the flow velocity, which is allowed in the absence of TRS and Galilean invariance. The resulting nonlinear flows break dynamical similarity and must be characterized by two dimensionless parameters: the Reynolds number and the emergent nonreciprocity number. The latter is linear in velocity but independent of system size. We determine the nonlinear conductance of a Hall bar and show that the nonreciprocal correction to the current can be of comparable magnitude to its reciprocal counterpart.

Title: Robust spin-qubit control in a natural Si-MOS quantum dot using phase modulation

Abstract: Silicon quantum dots are one of the most promising candidates for practical quantum computers because of their scalability and compatibility with the well-established complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technology. However, the coherence time is limited in industry-standard natural silicon because of the $^{29}$Si isotopes, which have non-zero nuclear spin. Here, we protect an isotopically natural silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor (Si-MOS) quantum dot spin qubit from environmental noise via electron spin resonance with a phase-modulated microwave (MW) drive. This concatenated continuous drive (CCD) method extends the decay time of Rabi oscillations from 1.2 $\mathrm{\mu s}$ to over 200 $\mathrm{\mu s}$. Furthermore, we define a protected qubit basis and propose robust gate operations. We find the coherence time measured by Ramsey sequence is improved from 143 ns to 40.7 $\mu$s compared to that of the bare spin qubit. The single qubit gate fidelity measured with randomized benchmarking is improved from 95% to 99%, underscoring the effectiveness of the CCD method. The method shows promise for improving control fidelity of noisy qubits, overcoming the qubit variability for global control, and maintaining qubit coherence while idling.

Title: Defects and Impurity Properties of VN precipitates in ARAFM Steels: Modelling using a Universal Machine Learning Potential and Experimental Validation
Authors: R. S. Stroud, C. Reynolds, T. Melichar, J. Haley, M. Carter, M. Moody, C. Hardie, D. Bowden, D.Nguyen-Manh, M. R. Wenman
Abstract: VN precipitates used to strengthen ARAFM steels for fusion applications dissolve under high Fe ion irradiation (100 dpa at 10^-3 dpa s^-1, 600 C). This study examined point defects and solute substitutions using atom probe tomography, machine learning interatomic potentials, and density functional theory. Combined with transmission electron microscopy, results show N-vacancies and substitutional Cr exist in VN precipitates before irradiation. Monte Carlo simulations and collision cascade simulations confirm ordered vacancies at operating temperatures help mitigate irradiation damage. However, solute additions disrupt vacancy ordering and enhance irradiation-induced damage, potentially accelerating dissolution.

Title: The microwave phase locking in Bloch transistor
Authors: Ilya Antonov, Rais Shaikhaidarov, Kyung Ho Kim, Dmitry Golubev, Sven Linzen, Evgeni V. Il'ichev, Vladimir N. Antonov, Oleg V. Astafiev
Abstract: Recent experimental demonstration of the quantum coherent phase slip and current quantization in the superconductors, the fundamental phenomena dual to the coherent Cooper pair tunnelling and voltage quantization (Shapiro steps), enables the development of a new quantum device, the Bloch transistor (BT). BT has a unique functionality: it can deliver quantized non-dissipative current to the quantum circuit. BT consists of two coupled Josephson Junctions (JJ) in the regime of coherent quantum phase slip. At the heart of the BT operation is a new mechanism for phase-locking the Bloch oscillations in JJs to microwaves via induced charge. The charge phase locking allows not only quantization of current but also gate voltage control of this quantisation through the Aharonov-Casher effect. We study the operation of the BT and analyse its parameters. BT technology is scalable and compatible with other superconducting quantum devices, making it part of an emerging cryogenic quantum technology platform

Title: Highly Hydrogenated Monolayer Graphene with Wide Band Gap Opening

Abstract: A thorough spectroscopic characterisation of two samples of highly hydrogenated monolayer graphene transferred on nickel grids is herein reported. With X ray photoemission spectroscopy on the C 1s core-level, a 100$\%$ $sp^3$ distortion was observed after the hydrogenation of a more $sp^3$-like defected graphene, while a flatter, more $sp^2$-arranged, graphene reached a 62$\%$ $sp^3$ saturation. Electron energy loss spectroscopy showed the $\pi$-plasmon excitation quenching for the 100$\%$ $sp^3$ sample and a significant reduction for the other one. The high loading levels of hydrogenation led to the opening of a wide optical band gap (6.3 and 6.2 eV). The C-H stretching vibrational mode was also observed, as a direct footprint of graphene hydrogenation. Finally, valence band measurements of the 62$\%$ saturated sample suggest the coexistence of one-side and two-side hydrogenation morphologies.

Title: Steady-state heat engines driven by finite reservoirs
Authors: Iago N. Mamede, Saulo V. Moreira, Mark T. Mitchison, Carlos E. Fiore
Abstract: We provide a consistent thermodynamic analysis of stochastic thermal engines driven by finite-size reservoirs, which are in turn coupled to infinite-size reservoirs. We consider a cyclic operation mode, where the working medium couples sequentially to hot and cold reservoirs, and a continuous mode with both reservoirs coupled simultaneously. We derive an effective temperature for the finite-size reservoirs determining the entropy production for two-state engines in the sequential coupling scenario, and show that finite-size reservoirs can meaningfully affect the power when compared to infinite-size reservoirs in both sequential and simultaneous coupling scenarios. We also investigate a three-state engine comprising two interacting units and optimize its performance in the presence of a finite reservoir. Notably, we show that the efficiency at maximum power can exceed the Curzon-Ahlborn bound with finite reservoirs. Our work introduces tools to optimize the performance of nanoscale engines under realistic conditions of finite reservoir heat capacity and imperfect thermal isolation.

Title: Bubble formation in active binary mixture model
Authors: Kyosuke Adachi
Abstract: Phase separation, the spontaneous segregation of density, is a ubiquitous phenomenon observed across diverse physical and biological systems. Within a crowd of motile elements, active phase separation emerges from the interplay of activity (i.e., self-propulsion) and density interactions. A striking feature of active phase separation is the persistent formation of dilute-phase bubbles within the dense phase, which has been explored in theoretical models. However, the fundamental parameters that systematically control bubble formation remain unclear in conventional self-propelled particle models. Here, we introduce an active binary mixture model in which solutes and solvents dynamically exchange positions on a lattice; both solutes and solvents are self-propelled particles, but solvents play a role analogous to empty space in typical dry active matter. Within this model, we find that spontaneous bubble formation of solvents can be tuned by activity asymmetry, which is the difference between the solute and solvent activities. Numerical simulations reveal that moderate solvent activity enhances bubble formation, while larger solvent activity, comparable to solute activity, suppresses it. By employing mean-field theory, which captures essential phase behaviors, we consider the mechanism for the enhancement of bubble formation induced by solvent activity. Beyond these findings, when solute and solvent activities are equal, we apply the finite-size scaling analysis to estimate the critical exponents for active phase separation under the suppression of bubbles. Our findings establish activity asymmetry as a key control parameter for active matter phase transitions, offering new insights into universality in nonequilibrium systems.

Title: A new angle on stacking faults: Overcoming the edge-on limit in high-resolution defect analysis
Authors: Nicolas Karpstein, Lukas Müller, Andreas Bezold, Michael J. Mills, Steffen Neumeier, Erdmann Spiecker
Abstract: The nature of stacking faults - whether intrinsic or extrinsic - plays a pivotal role in defect-mediated processes in crystalline materials. Yet, current electron microscopy techniques for their reliable analysis remain limited to either conventional fringe-contrast imaging of inclined faults or atomic-resolution imaging of edge-on configurations. Here, we overcome this dichotomy by introducing a high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM) method that enables full structural discrimination of inclined stacking faults, as demonstrated for various faults in fcc, $L1_2$, and sphalerite crystals. This approach eliminates a long-standing geometric constraint on high-resolution analysis, providing comprehensive access to stacking faults on all glide planes along the widely used [001] and [110] zone axes. We demonstrate the robustness of the method in a CoNi-based superalloy, achieving clear discrimination of fault types even for overlapping configurations and foil thicknesses exceeding 100 nm. The analysis of bounding dislocations, revealing the fault's formation mechanism, is also presented for inclined geometries. Simulations reveal that fault-induced de-channeling is key to contrast formation and is strongly governed by the fault's depth within the sample. Leveraging this effect, we further establish a route to artificially generate ultrathin TEM lamellae - bounded by the stacking fault itself - thereby enhancing contrast for atomic-scale studies of long-range ordering, compositional fluctuations, and nanoclustering.

Title: Quantum criticality and tunable Griffiths phase in superconducting twisted trilayer graphene
Authors: Phanibhusan S. Mahapatra, Haining Pan, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, J. H. Pixley, Eva Y. Andrei
Abstract: When dimensionality is reduced, enhanced quantum fluctuations can destroy long-range phase coherence, driving a superconductor insulator transition, SIT, where disorder and electronic correlations give rise to novel many-body states. Here, we report the first observation of a magnetic field tuned SIT in mirrorsymmetric twisted trilayer graphene, TTG. Remarkably, signatures of quantum criticality persist over an exceptionally broad range of magnetic fields and are well described by the formation of a quantum Griffiths phase, a regime in which rare spatially extended regions develop local order within a globally disordered phase. This leads to a quantum phase transition governed by an infinite-randomness fixed point and characterized by ultraslow relaxation dynamics. Near the quantum critical region, transport measurements reveal strongly nonlinear electrical behavior, including a current-driven reentrant transition from insulating to superconducting transport, providing direct evidence of local superconducting order. By tilting the magnetic field, we are able to collapse the broad Griffiths regime into a single quantum critical point, QCP, demonstrating a striking level of control over disorder induced quantum dynamics. Our results further show that TTG strongly violates the Pauli limit and establishes twisted trilayer graphene as a tunable platform for exploring quantum phase fluctuations, Cooper pair localization, and unconventional superconductivity.

Title: Higher-Order Fermion Interactions in BCS Theory
Authors: Diego Rodriguez-Gomez, Jorge G. Russo
Abstract: We investigate the impact of higher-order fermionic deformations in multiflavor Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory. Focusing specifically on the 6- and 8-fermion interactions, we show that these terms can have significant consequences on the dynamics of the system. In certain regions of parameter space, the theory continues to exhibit second-order phase transitions with mean-field critical exponents and the same critical temperature; however, the temperature dependence of the superconducting gap can deviate markedly from conventional BCS behavior. In other regions, the theory exhibits first-order phase transitions or second-order phase transitions with non-mean field exponents. We conclude by discussing potential phenomenological applications of these theories.

Title: Lee-Yang-zero ratio method in three-dimensional Ising model
Authors: Tatsuya Wada, Masakiyo Kitazawa, Kazuyuki Kanaya
Abstract: By performing Monte Carlo simulations of the three-dimensional Ising model, we apply the recently proposed Lee-Yang-zero ratio (LYZR) method to determine the location of the critical point in this model. We demonstrate that the LYZR method is as powerful as the conventional Binder-cumulant method in studying the critical point, while the LYZR method has the advantage of suppressing the violation of the finite-size scaling and non-linearity near the critical point. We also achieve a precise determination of the values of the LYZRs at the critical point, which are universal numbers. In addition, we propose an alternative method that uses only a single Lee-Yang zero and show that it is also useful for the search for the critical point.

Title: Orbital Ordering in the Charge Density Wave Phases of BaNi$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$
Authors: Tom Lacmann, Robert Eder, Igor Vinograd, Michael Merz, Mehdi Frachet, Philippa Helen McGuinness, Kurt Kummer, Enrico Schierle, Amir-Abbas Haghighirad, Sofia-Michaela Souliou, Matthieu Le Tacon
Abstract: We use resonant X-ray scattering at the nickel L$_{2,3}$ edges to investigate the interplay between orbital degrees of freedom and charge density waves (CDW) in the superconductor BaNi$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$. Both the incommensurate and commensurate CDWs in this system exhibit strong resonant enhancement with distinct energy and polarization dependencies, indicative of orbital ordering. Azimuthal-angle-dependent measurements reveal a lowering of the local Ni site symmetry, consistent with monoclinic or lower point group symmetry. The scattering signatures of both CDWs are dominated by contributions from Ni $d_{xz,yz}$ orbitals, with similar orbital character despite their distinct wave vectors. These findings point to a shared orbital-driven formation mechanism and provide new insight into the symmetry breaking and orbital/nematic fluctuations in the high-temperature regime of the superconductor BaNi$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$.

Title: Random singlet physics in the $S = \frac{1}{2}$ pyrochlore antiferromagnet NaCdCu$_2$F$_7$
Authors: Andrej Kancko, Hironori Sakai, Cinthia Antunes Corrêa, Petr Proschek, Jan Prokleška, Tetiana Haidamak, Marc Uhlarz, Adam Berlie, Yo Tokunaga, Ross Harvey Colman
Abstract: We report a random singlet ground state in the $S=\frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg pyrochlore antiferromagnet NaCdCu$_2$F$_7$. Cationic Na$^+$/Cd$^{2+}$ disorder on the pyrochlore $A$ site generates a broad distribution of Cu$^{2+}$--F$^-$--Cu$^{2+}$ exchange couplings, introducing intrinsic magnetic bond disorder. Despite strong antiferromagnetic interactions ($\theta_{\mathrm{CW}}=-72$~K), no magnetic order or global spin freezing is observed in DC and AC susceptibility, specific heat or $^{23}$Na nuclear magnetic resonance to 120 mK, with muon spin relaxation experiments confirming persistent spin dynamics to 58 mK. $T$-linear specific heat, a Curie-like susceptibility tail, and power-law scaling with data collapse in $\chi(T)$, $M(H)$, $C_{\mathrm{mag}}/T$, $^{23}$Na $(1/T_1T)$ and the muon spin polarization $P(t)$ reveal a disorder-driven network of random singlets and orphan spins. Scaling across multiple bulk and local probes is consistent with a broad distribution of exchange energies, $P[\mathcal{J}] \sim \mathcal{J}^{-\alpha}$. This behavior contrasts with previously-studied Na$A''B_2$F$_7$ pyrochlore fluorides, where magnetic bond disorder precipitates spin-glass freezing, underscoring the crucial role of strong $S=\frac{1}{2}$ quantum fluctuations in NaCdCu$_2$F$_7$.

Title: Valley-dependent topological interface states in biased armchair nanoribbons of gapless single-layer graphene for transport applications
Authors: Zheng-Han Huang, Jing-Yuan Lai, Yu-Shu G. Wu
Abstract: Valley-dependent topological physics offers a promising avenue for designing nanoscale devices based on gapless single-layer graphene. To demonstrate this potential, we investigate an electrical bias-controlled topological discontinuity in valley polarization within a two-segment armchair nanoribbon of gapless single-layer graphene. This discontinuity is created at the interface by applying opposite in-plane, transverse electrical biases to the two segments. An efficient tight-binding theoretical formulation is developed to calculate electron states in the structure. In a reference configuration, we obtain energy eigenvalues and probability distributions that feature interface-confined electron eigenstates induced by the topological discontinuity. Moreover, to elucidate the implications of interface confinement for electron transport, a modified configuration is introduced to transform the eigenstates into transport-active, quasi-localized ones. We show that such states result in Fano "anti-resonances" in transmission spectra. The resilience of these quasi-localized states and their associated Fano fingerprints is examined with respect to fluctuations. Finally, a proof-of-concept band-stop electron energy filter is presented, highlighting the potential of this confinement mechanism and, more broadly, valley-dependent topological physics in designing nanoscale devices in gapless single-layer graphene.

Title: First-principles calculation of electronic and topological properties of low-dimensional tellurium
Authors: Gabriel Elyas Gama Araujo, Andreia Luisa da Rosa
Abstract: We present a comprehensive first-principles investigation of the structural, electronic, vibrational, and topological properties of tellurium across its dimensional hierarchy, including bulk trigonal Te-I, two-dimensional tellurene polymorphs, and one-dimensional helical nanowires. Using density functional theory with full inclusion of spin-orbit coupling, we confirm that bulk Te-I is a narrow-gap semiconductor hosting Weyl nodes arising from broken inversion symmetry and degenerate phonon modes suggestive of chiral phonon behavior. In contrast, two-dimensional alpha and beta-tellurene are found to be topologically trivial, with no spin-orbit-driven band inversion in the occupied manifold. Beyond these established phases, we find that buckled kagome and buckled square tellurene lattices exhibit a nontrivial two-dimensional topology of the occupied electronic bands, indicating incipient quantum spin Hall character in metallic systems. In contrast, one-side hydrogen-passivated hexagonal tellurene realizes a fully gapped quantum spin Hall phase with a robust Z2 = 1 invariant, preserved under applied strain and chemical functionalization. In the one-dimensional limit, helical tellurium nanowires preserve chirality and host edge-localized states accompanied by pronounced anisotropy in carrier effective masses. These results establish tellurium as a highly tunable platform for engineering topological phenomena across dimensionality, bridging three-dimensional Weyl physics, two-dimensional quantum spin Hall and incipient Z2 phases, and one-dimensional helical systems.

Title: Mind the Gap -- Imaging Buried Interfaces in Twisted Oxide Moirés
Authors: Harikrishnan KP, Xin Wei, Chia-Hao Lee, Dasol Yoon, Yonghun Lee, Kevin J. Crust, Yu-Tsun Shao, Ruijuan Xu, Jong-Hoon Kang, Ce Liang, Jiwoong Park, Harold Y. Hwang, David A. Muller
Abstract: The ability to tune electronic structure in twisted stacks of two-dimensional (2D) materials has motivated the exploration of similar moiré physics with twisted oxide membranes. Due to the intrinsic three-dimensional nature of bonding in many oxides, achieving atomic-level coupling is significantly more challenging than with van der Waals materials. Although clean interfaces with atomic-level proximity have been demonstrated in ceramic bicrystals using high-temperature and high-pressure processing to facilitate atomic diffusion that flattens rough interfaces, such conditions are not readily accessible when bonding oxide membranes. This study shows how topographic mismatch due to surface roughness of the membranes can restrict atomic-scale proximity at the interface to isolated patches even after contaminants and amorphous interlayers are eliminated. In interfaces between 2D materials and oxide membranes the reduced ability of the 2D material to conform to the membrane's step-terrace topography also limits atomic-scale contact. When imaging stacked membranes in projection, we find conventional through-focal imaging to be relatively insensitive to the buried interface, whereas electron ptychography detects structural variations on the order of a nanometer. These findings highlight interface roughness as a key challenge for the field of oxide twistronics and emphasize the need for reliable characterization methods, both in cross-section and projection.

Title: Tunable Luminescence From a Single Free-Base Porphyrin Molecule By Controlled Access to Optically Active States
Authors: Eve Ammerman, Nils Krane, Bruno Schuler
Abstract: Scanning tunneling microscopy-induced luminescence (STML) provides access to optical properties of individual molecules through a cascade of relaxation processes between many-body states. Insufficient charge attachment energies quench the relaxation cascade via optically excited states, causing even intrinsically bright molecules to remain dark in STML. Here, we leverage substrate work function control and tip-induced gating of the double barrier tunnel junction to induce an energy shift of the ionic transition state of a single free-base tetrabenzoporphyrin (H2TBP) to control access to optically excited states and bright exciton emission. The experimental observations are validated by a rate equation and polaron model considering the relaxation energy of the NaCl decoupling layer upon charging of the molecule.

Title: Hysteresis in the freeze-thaw cycle of emulsions and suspensions
Authors: Wilfried Raffi, Jochem G. Meijer, Detlef Lohse
Abstract: Freeze-thaw cycles can be regularly observed in nature in water and are essential in industry and science. Objects present in the medium will interact with either an advancing solidification front during freezing or a retracting solidification front, i.e., an advancing melting front, during thawing. It is well known that objects show complex behaviours when interacting with the advancing solidification front, but the extent to which they are displaced during the retraction of the solid-liquid interface is less well understood. To study potential hysteresis effects during freeze-thaw cycles, we exploit experimental model systems of oil-in-water emulsions and polystyrene (PS) particle suspensions, in which a water-ice solidification front advances and retracts over an individual immiscible (and deformable) oil droplet or over a solid PS particle. We record several interesting hysteresis effects, resulting in non-zero relative displacements of the objects between freezing and thawing. PS particles tend to migrate further and further away from their initial position, whereas oil droplets tend to return to their starting positions during thawing. We rationalize our experimental findings by comparing them to our prior theoretical model of Meijer, Bertin & Lohse, Phys. Rev. Fluids (2025), yielding a qualitatively good agreement. Additionally, we look into the reversibility of how the droplet deforms and re-shapes throughout one freeze-thaw cycle, which will turn out to be remarkably robust.

Title: Multimode Jahn-Teller Effect in Negatively Charged Nitrogen-Vacancy Center in Diamond
Authors: Jianhua Zhang, Jun Liu, Z. Z. Zhu, K. M. Ho, V. V. Dobrovitski, C. Z. Wang
Abstract: We present a first-principles study of the multimode Jahn-Teller (JT) effect in the exctied $^{3}E$ state of the negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond. Using density functional theory combined with an intrinsic distortion path (IDP) analysis, we resolve the full activation pathways of the JT distortion and quantitatively decompose the distortion into contributions from individual vibrational modes. We find that multiple vibrational modes participate cooperatively in the JT dynamics, giving rise to a shallow adiabatic potential energy surface with low barriers, consistent with thermally activated pseudorotation. The dominant JT-active modes are found to closely correspond to vibrational features observed in two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES), in agreement with recent ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Our results establish a microscopic, mode-resolved picture of vibronic coupling in the excited-state NV center and provide new insight into dephasing, relaxation, and optically driven dynamics relevant to solid-state quantum technologies.

Abstract: A multifractal model is used to analyze neutron evolution within a reactor. For chain reactions, various characteristics of multifractal neutron behavior have been determined. These include the dimension of the multifractal carrier, information and correlation dimensions, the entropy of the fractal set, maximum and minimum dimension values, and the multifractal spectrum function. The geometric features of a multifractal allow for the description of a stochastic system consisting of hierarchically subordinate statistical ensembles, which are characterized by Cayley trees. A stationary distribution over hierarchical levels is established, which follows the Tsallis power law. The text also points out some potential applications of fractal patterns in nuclear reactor theory. The chance of percolation, which is when we see a state in the Bethe lattice where there's at least one continuous path through neighboring conducting nodes all the way across, is similar to the likelihood of a self-sustaining fission chain reaction happening. When this probability hits a critical point, we get a (conditionally) infinite cluster of neutrons forming. The percolation probability, influenced by how long the reactor has been running and its size, is linked to the reactor's criticality. We take a look at how the neutron multiplication factor behaves over time. We especially focus on the early stages of a self-sustaining nuclear fission chain reaction. We also highlight the ways to identify the boundaries of the critical region.

Title: Dynamic redundancy and mortality in stochastic search
Authors: Samantha Linn, Aanjaneya Kumar
Abstract: Search processes are a fundamental part of natural and artificial systems. In such settings, the number of searchers is rarely constant: new agents may be recruited while others can abandon the search. Despite the ubiquity of these dynamics, their combined influence on search efficiency remains unexplored. Here we present a general framework for stochastic search in which independent agents progressively join and leave the process, a mechanism we term dynamic redundancy and mortality (DRM). Under minimal assumptions on the underlying search dynamics, this framework yields exact first-passage time statistics. It further reveals surprising connections to stochastic resetting, including a regime in which the resetting mean first-passage time emerges as a universal lower bound for DRM, as well as regimes in which DRM search is faster. We illustrate our results through a detailed analysis of one-dimensional Brownian DRM search. Altogether, this work provides a rigorous foundation for studying first-passage processes with a fluctuating number of searchers, with direct relevance across physical, biological, and algorithmic systems.

Title: Finite-temperature topological transitions in the presence of quenched uncorrelated disorder
Authors: Claudio Bonati, Ettore Vicari
Abstract: We address issues related to the presence of defects at finite-temperature topological transitions, in particular when defects are modeled in terms of further variables associated with a quenched disorder, corresponding to the limit in which the defect dynamics is very slow. As a paradigmatic model, we consider the classical three-dimensional lattice ${\mathbb Z}_2$ gauge model in the presence of quenched uncorrelated disorder associated with the plaquettes of the lattice, whose topological transitions are characterized by the absence of a local order parameter. We study the critical behaviors in the presence of weak disorder. We show that they belong to a new topological universality class, different from that of the lattice ${\mathbb Z}_2$ gauge models without disorder, in agreement with the Harris criterium for the relevance of uncorrelated quenched disorder when the pure system undergoes a continuous transition with positive specific-heat critical exponent.

Title: Electric Charge Transport and Dielectric Properties of the Barium Titanate Ceramics Obtained by Spark-Plasma Sintering with Different Carbon Content

Abstract: Barium titanate (BaTiO3) ceramics with a different content of carbon were synthesized by spark-plasma sintering (SPS) at the temperature of 1100 C in vacuum under pressure. The concentration and distribution of carbon impurity inside the samples is estimated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The resistivity vs temperature and electric field dependences of the SPS ceramics with different carbon concentration have been studied. It is shown that their conduction is determined by the variable range hopping mechanism and obeys the Mott law. The density of localized states and localization radius of the electron wave function are determined. The difference in low-temperature resistivity of the SPS ceramics is caused by carbon concentration and connected with it variation of the dielectric permittivity. The relative dielectric permittivity of the SPS ceramics is colossal and reaches the values of 10^5 - 10^6 order. The larger carbon concentration is, the smaller the permittivity and resistivity are within the Mott hopping conduction temperature range. In the range from 250 K to 408 K one observes that the dielectric permittivity strongly increases forming a maximum in all samples, which may be related to the phase transition. Along with this, resistivity manifests a simultaneous sharp decrease. The decrease of resistivity along with the characteristic dependence of resistivity vs dielectric permittivity in the Mott conduction temperature range, evidences the validity of Heywang model for the description of SPS ceramics conduction mechanisms. The resistivity strongly decreases with increasing frequency in the AC regime, which agrees both with models of hopping conduction and effects based on the Maxwell-Wagner model. The studied SPS BaTiO3 ceramics are attractive for applications in energy storage and sensorics.

Title: Confinement-Tunable Synthetic Gauge Fields and Floquet Topological Phenomena in a Driven Quantum Wire Qubit
Authors: Feulefack Ornela Claire, Dongmo Tedo Lynsia Saychele, Danga Jeremie Edmond, Keumo Tsiaze Roger Magloire, Fridolin Melong, Kenfack-Sadem Christian, Fotue Alain Jerve, Mahouton Norbert Hounkonnou, Lukong Cornelius Fai
Abstract: Theoretical analysis demonstrates that a spin qubit in a parabolic quantum wire, when driven by a bichromatic field, exhibits a confinement-tunable synthetic gauge field leading to novel Floquet topological phenomena. The underlying mechanism for topological protection of qubit states against time-periodic perturbations is presented. The analysis reveals a confinement-induced topological Landau-Zener transition, characterized by a shift from preserved symmetries to chiral interference patterns in Landau-Zener-St$\ddot{u}$ckelberg-Majorana interferometry. The emergence of non-Abelian geometric phases under cyclic evolution in curved confinement and phase-parameter space is identified, enabling holonomic quantum computation. Furthermore, the prediction of unconventional Floquet-Bloch oscillations in the quasi-energy and resonance transition probability spectra as a function of the biharmonic phase indicates exotic properties, such as fractal spectra and fractional Floquet tunnelling. These phenomena provide direct evidence of coherent transport in the synthetic dimension. Concrete experimental pathways for realizing these effects in semiconductor heterostructures are proposed, and the framework is extended to multi-qubit entanglement generation with a quantitative analysis of its inherent resilience to decoherence. Collectively, these findings position quantum wire materials as a versatile and scalable platform for Floquet engineering, topological quantum control, and fault-tolerant quantum information processing.

Title: To infinity and back -- $1/N$ graph expansions of light-matter systems
Authors: Andreas Schellenberger, Kai P. Schmidt
Abstract: We present a method for performing a full graph expansion for light-matter systems, utilizing the linked-cluster theorem. This method enables us to explore $1/N$ corrections to the thermodynamic limit $N\to \infty$ in the number of particles, giving us access to the mesoscopic regime. While this regime is yet largely unexplored due to the challenges of studying it with established approaches, it incorporates intriguing features, such as entanglement between light and matter that vanishes in the thermodynamic limit. As a representative application, we calculate physical quantities of the low-energy regime for the paradigmatic Dicke-Ising chain in the paramagnetic normal phase by accompanying the graph expansion with both exact diagonalization (NLCE) and perturbation theory (pcst++), benchmarking our approach against other techniques. We investigate the ground-state energy density and photon density, showing a smooth transition from the microscopic to the macroscopic regime up to the thermodynamic limit. Around the quantum critical point, we extract the $1/N$ corrections to the ground-state energy density to obtain the critical point and critical exponent using extrapolation techniques.

Title: Hysteretic Excitation in Non-collinear Antiferromagnetic Spin-Torque Oscillators: A Terminal Velocity Motion Perspective
Authors: Hao-Hsuan Chen, Ching-Ming Lee
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for non-collinear antiferromagnetic spin torque oscillators (NC-AFM STO) by unifying spin dynamics under the Poisson Bracket formalism. Shifting from traditional torque-based descriptions to an operational symmetry perspective, we develop two complementary viewpoints: a vector perspective identifying infinite degenerate Rigid Body Precession (RBP) states where exchange energy depends solely on the total magnetic momentum, and a particle perspective decomposing dynamics into Center-of-Mass (CM) translation and Relative Motion (RM) oscillation. Using time-dependent rotational and translational transformation techniques, we analytically resolve the rapid (~10 ps) transient evolution into a stable RBP state driven by SOT and damping. We demonstrate that the out-of-plane anisotropy (OPA) lifts the exchange degeneracy, triggering a long-term (~1 ns) oscillatory decay toward a steady state characterized by uniform spin z-components and a 120-degree inter-spin locking angle. This state is accurately governed by our Terminal Velocity Motion (TVM) model [arXiv:2305.14013], where exchange coupling transforms into kinetic energy with a light effective mass. The model precisely predicts SOT-driven transients, hysteretic excitation, and the dynamic phase diagram. Finally, we account for the sub-critical current regime mismatch by identifying a 'Rigid-Body Breaking' effect: a surge in effective friction caused by the self-resonance of RM variables induced by CM translation, mediated by the in-plane anisotropy (IPA).

Title: Continuous-wave all-optical single-photon transistor based on a Rydberg-atom ensemble
Authors: Iason Tsiamis, Oleksandr Kyriienko, Anders S. Sørensen
Abstract: Continuous-wave (cw) architectures provide a promising route to interface disparate quantum systems by relaxing the need for precise synchronization. While essential cw components, including microwave single-photon transistors and microwave-optical converters, have been explored, an all-optical cw single-photon transistor has remained a missing piece. We propose a high-efficiency, high-gain implementation using Rydberg atoms, in which a control photon disrupts the transmission of a continuous probe beam via the van der Waals interaction. This device completes the set of components required for cw processing of quantum signals and paves the way for all-optical processing at the quantum level.

Title: Continuous-wave quantum light control via engineered Rydberg-induced dephasing
Authors: Iason Tsiamis, Oleksandr Kyriienko, Anders S. Sørensen
Abstract: We analyze several implementations of all-optical single-photon transistors (SPTs) operating in the continuous-wave (cw) regime, as presented in the companion paper [Phys. Rev. A 113, L011701 (2026)]. The devices rely on ensembles of Rydberg atoms interacting via van der Waals interactions. Under electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), a weak probe field is fully transmitted through the atomic ensemble in the absence of control photons. Exciting a collective Rydberg state with a single control photon breaks the EIT condition, thereby strongly suppressing the probe transmission. We show how collective Rydberg interactions in an atomic ensemble, confined either in an optical cavity or in free space, give rise to two distinct probe-induced dephasing mechanisms. These processes localize the control excitations, extend their lifetimes, and increase the device efficiency. We characterize the SPTs in terms of control-photon absorption probability and probe gain, supported by numerical simulations of realistic one- and three-dimensional ensembles. The proposed cw devices complement previously demonstrated SPTs and broaden the toolbox of quantum light manipulation circuitry.

Title: Hybrid III-V/Silicon Quantum Photonic Device Generating Broadband Entangled Photon Pairs
Authors: J. Schuhmann, L. Lazzari, M. Morassi, A. Lemaitre, I. Sagnes, G. Beaudoin, M.I. Amanti, F. Boeuf, F. Raineri, F. Baboux, S. Ducci
Abstract: The demand for integrated photonic chips combining the generation and manipulation of quantum states of light is steadily increasing, driven by the need for compact and scalable platforms for quantum information technologies. While photonic circuits with diverse functionalities are being developed in different single material platforms, it has become crucial to realize hybrid photonic circuits that harness the advantages of multiple materials while mitigating their respective weaknesses, resulting in enhanced capabilities. Here, we demonstrate a hybrid III-V/Silicon quantum photonic device combining the strong second-order nonlinearity and direct bandgap of the III-V semiconductor platform with the high maturity and CMOS compatibility of the silicon photonic platform. Our device embeds the spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) of photon pairs into an AlGaAs source and their vertical routing to an adhesively-bonded silicon-on-insulator circuitry, within an evanescent coupling scheme managing both polarization states. This enables the on-chip generation of broadband (> 40 nm) telecom photons by type 0 and type 2 SPDC from the hybrid device, at room temperature and with internal pair generation rates exceeding $10^5$ $s^{-1}$ for both types, while the pump beam is strongly rejected. Two-photon interference with 92% visibility (and up to 99% upon 5 nm spectral filtering) proves the high energy-time entanglement quality of the produced quantum state, thereby enabling a wide range of quantum information applications on-chip, within an hybrid architecture compliant with electrical pumping and merging the assets of two mature and highly complementary platforms in view of out-of-the-lab deployment of quantum technologies.

Title: Integral Transforms for Finite Gauge Theory
Authors: Jackson Van Dyke
Abstract: This paper shows that quantization of $\pi$-finite spaces, as a functor out of a higher category of spans, is equivariant in two ways: Symmetries of a given polarization/Lagrangian always induce coherent symmetries of the quantization. On the other hand, symmetries of the entire phase space a priori only induce projective symmetries, with an invertible once-categorified theory, the anomaly theory, encoding the projectivity. We give projective symmetries of three-dimensional finite gauge theories a concrete description via a twice-categorified analogue of Blattner-Kostant-Sternberg kernels and the associated integral transforms, such as the Fourier transform. This establishes an analogy between certain instances of the $\pi$-finite quantization procedure considered herein and the geometric quantization of a symplectic vector space.

Title: Exact Duality at Low Energy in a Josephson Tunnel Junction Coupled to a Transmission Line
Authors: Luca Giacomelli, Michel H. Devoret, Cristiano Ciuti
Abstract: We theoretically explore the low-energy behavior of a Josephson tunnel junction coupled to a finite-length, charge-biased transmission line and compare it to its flux-biased counterpart. For transmission lines of increasing length, we show that the low-energy charge-dependent energy bands of the charge-biased configuration can be exactly mapped onto those of the flux-biased system via a well-defined duality transformation of circuit parameters. In the limit of an infinitely long transmission line, the influence of boundary conditions vanishes, and both circuits reduce to a resistively shunted Josephson junction. This convergence reveals the system's intrinsic self-duality and critical behavior. Our exact formulation of charge-flux duality provides a foundation for generalizations to more complex superconductor-insulator phase transitions.

Title: Narrowline cooling of dysprosium atoms in an optical tweezer array
Authors: Giulio Biagioni, Britton Hofer, Nathan Bonvalet, Damien Bloch, Antoine Browaeys, Igor Ferrier-Barbut
Abstract: We perform narrowline cooling of single dysprosium atoms trapped in a 1D optical tweezers array, employing the narrow single-photon transition at 741 nm. At the trapping wavelength of 532 nm, the excited state is less trapped than the ground state. To obtain efficient cooling performances, we chirp the frequency of the cooling beam to subsequently address the red sidebands of different motional states. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the cooling protocol through Raman thermometry, which we characterize for our experimental conditions. We obtain an array of 75 atoms close to the motional ground state in the radial direction of the tweezers. Our results demonstrate the possibility to manipulate the motional degree of freedom of dysprosium in optical tweezers arrays, a key ingredient to exploit the potential of lanthanide-based tweezers platforms for quantum science.

Title: Robustly optimal dynamics for active matter reservoir computing
Authors: Mario U. Gaimann, Miriam Klopotek
Abstract: Information processing abilities of active matter are studied in the reservoir computing (RC) paradigm to infer the future state of a chaotic signal. We uncover an exceptional regime of agent dynamics that has been overlooked previously. It appears robustly optimal for performance under many conditions, thus providing valuable insights into computation with physical systems more generally. The key to forming effective mechanisms for information processing appears in the system's intrinsic relaxation abilities. These are probed without actually enforcing a specific inference goal. The dynamical regime that achieves optimal computation is located just below a critical damping threshold, involving a relaxation with multiple stages, and is readable at the single-particle level. At the many-body level, it yields substrates robustly optimal for RC across varying physical parameters and inference tasks. A system in this regime exhibits a strong diversity of dynamic mechanisms under highly fluctuating driving forces. Correlations of agent dynamics can express a tight relationship between the responding system and the fluctuating forces driving it. As this model is interpretable in physical terms, it facilitates re-framing inquiries regarding learning and unconventional computing with a fresh rationale for many-body physics out of equilibrium.

Title: Disentangling Boltzmann brains, the time-asymmetry of memory, and the second law
Authors: David Wolpert, Carlo Rovelli, Jordan Scharnhorst
Abstract: Are your perceptions, memories and observational data, a statistical fluctuation out of the thermal equilibrium of the universe, having no correlation with the actual past state of the universe? Arguments are given in the literature for and against this "Boltzmann brain" hypothesis. Complicating these arguments have been the many subtle -- and very often implicit -- joint dependencies among these arguments and others that have been given for the past hypothesis, the second law, and even for Bayesian inference of the reliability of experimental data. These dependencies can easily lead to circular reasoning. To avoid this problem, since all of these arguments involve the stochastic properties of the dynamics of the universe's entropy, we begin by formalizing that dynamics as a time-symmetric, time-translation invariant Markov process, which we call the entropy conjecture. Crucially, like all stochastic processes, the entropy conjecture does not specify any time(s) which it should be conditioned on in order to infer the stochastic dynamics of our universe's entropy. Any such choice of conditioning times and associated entropy values must be introduced as an independent assumption. This observation allows us to disentangle the standard Boltzmann brain hypothesis, its "1000CE" variant, the past hypothesis, the second law, and the reliability of our experimental data, all in a fully formal manner. In particular, we show that these all make an arbitrary assumption that the dynamics of the universe's entropy should be conditioned on a single event at a single moment in time, differing only in the details of their assumptions. In this aspect, the Boltzmann brain hypothesis and the second law are equally legitimate (or not).

Title: The sphere free energy of the vector models to order $1/N$
Authors: Ludo Fraser-Taliente
Abstract: We calculate the large-$N$ expansion of the sphere free energy $F=-\log Z_{S^d}$ of the O(N) $\phi^4$ and the Gross-Neveu $(\bar{\psi} \psi)^2$ CFTs to order $1/N$. Analytic regularization of these theories requires consistently shifting the UV scaling dimension of the auxiliary field: this can only be done by modifying its kinetic term. This modification combines with the counterterms to give the result that matches the $\epsilon$-expansion, resolving a puzzle raised by Tarnopolsky in arXiv:1609.09113. These $F$s can be written compactly in terms of the anomalous dimensions, for both the short-range and the long-range versions of these CFTs. We also provide various technical results including a computation of the counterterms on the sphere and a neat derivation of the sphere free energy of a free conformal field. Finally, we observe that the long-range CFT becomes the short-range CFT at exactly the point where its $\tilde{F} =-\sin \tfrac{\pi d}{2} F$ is maximized as a function of the vector's scaling dimension.

Title: Information Propagation in Predator-Prey Dynamics of Turbulent Plasma
Authors: Tomohiro Tanogami, Makoto Sasaki, Tatsuya Kobayashi
Abstract: Magnetically confined fusion plasmas exhibit predator-prey-like cyclic oscillations through the self-regulating interaction between drift-wave turbulence and zonal flow. To elucidate the detailed mechanism and causality underlying this phenomenon, we construct a simple stochastic predator-prey model that incorporates intrinsic fluctuations and analyze its statistical properties from an information-theoretic perspective. We first show that the model exhibits persistent fluctuating cyclic oscillations called quasi-cycles due to amplification of intrinsic noise. This result suggests the possibility that the previously observed periodic oscillations in a toroidal plasma are not limit cycles but quasi-cycles, and that such quasi-cycles may be widely observed under various conditions. For this model, we further prove that information of the zonal flow is propagated to turbulence. This result suggests that turbulence behavior may be predictable to a certain extent based on zonal flow characteristics.

Title: Continuous-wave, high-resolution, ultra-broadband mid-infrared nonlinear spectroscopy with tunable plasmonic nanocavities
Authors: Zhiyuan Xie, Nobuaki Oyamada, Francesco Ciccarello, Wen Chen, Christophe Galland
Abstract: Vibrational sum- and difference-frequency generation (SFG and DFG) spectroscopy probes the nonlinear response of interfaces at mid-infrared (MIR) wavelengths while detecting upconverted signals in the visible. Recent work has moved from large-area films and colloids to nanoscale structures using dual-resonant plasmonic nanocavities that co-confine light and matter in deep-subwavelength volumes. Here we implement high-resolution ($<1$~cm$^{-1}$), continuous-wave ultrabroadband vSFG, vDFG, and four-wave mixing (FWM) coherent spectroscopy from 860 to 1670~cm$^{-1}$ on dual-resonant antennas under ambient conditions. Using a commercial, broadly tunable quantum-cascade laser and eliminating geometric phase matching simplify acquisition and expand spectral reach. The resulting spectra exhibit coherent interference between resonant (vibrational) and nonresonant (electronic) contributions to the effective $\chi^{(2)}$, previously accessible only under fs/ps excitation. Simultaneous measurement of SFG and DFG enables a {ratiometric} analysis that suppresses common-mode drifts and helps reveal vibrational resonances. We demonstrate versatility and reproducibility across several analytes that span distinct relative strengths of vibrational vs. electronic nonlinearities. Together, these capabilities position our approach as a scalable route to multiplexed, high-resolution MIR sensing and a practical basis for chip-level, label-free coherent spectroscopy. It opens a feasible path toward single- and few-molecule optomechanical studies using nanoscale trapping strategies.

Title: Modified rational six vertex model on a rectangular lattice : new formula, homogeneous and thermodynamic limits
Authors: Matthieu Cornillault, Samuel Belliard
Abstract: We continue the work of Belliard, Pimenta and Slavnov (2024) studying the modified rational six vertex model. We find another formula of the partition function for the inhomogeneous model, in terms of a determinant that mix the modified Izergin one and a Vandermonde one. This expression enables us to compute the partition function in the homogeneous limit for the rectangular lattice, and then to study the thermodynamic limit. It leads to a new result, we obtain the first order of free energy with boundary effects in the thermodynamic limit.

Title: From motifs to Lévy flights: Modeling urban mobility in Bogotá's public transport system
Authors: Juan F. Alayón-Martínez, Alejandro P. Riascos
Abstract: In this paper, we study two years of access card validation records from Bogotá's multimodal public transport system, comprising over 2.3 billion trips across bus rapid transit, feeder buses, dual-service buses, and an aerial cable network. From user trajectories constructed exclusively from access records, we derive motifs that reveal recurrent mobility patterns extending beyond simple two-location visits. This approach enables the construction of an integrated origin-destination (OD) matrix covering 2,828 urban zones. Similarity analysis using the Jensen-Shannon divergence confirms the temporal stability of mobility structures across semesters, despite infrastructure changes and fare policy adjustments. From the obtained OD matrices, we derive transition probabilities between zones and uncover a robust power-law relationship with geographical distance, consistent with Lévy flight dynamics. We validate our model using Monte Carlo simulations showing that reproduces both local and long-range displacements, with similar scaling exponents across time. These findings demonstrate that Bogotá's public transport mobility can be effectively modeled through Lévy processes, providing a novel framework for analyzing complex transportation systems based solely on user access records.

Title: Water wave scattering by a surface-mounted rectangular anisotropic elastic plate
Authors: Ben Wilks, Michael H. Meylan, Zachary J. Wegert, Vivien J. Challis, Ngamta Thamwattana
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of water wave scattering by a rectangular anisotropic elastic plate mounted on the ocean surface, with either free, clamped or simply-supported edges. The problem is obtained as an expansion over the dry modes of the elastic plate, which are computed using a Rayleigh--Ritz method. In turn, the component diffraction and radiation problems are solved by formulating a boundary integral equation and solving numerically using a constant panel method. The results are presented to highlight the resonant responses of the plate under different forcing scenarios. In particular, we illustrate how the excitation of certain modes can be forbidden due to symmetry.

Title: Local spreading of stabilizer Rényi entropy in a brickwork random Clifford circuit
Authors: Somnath Maity, Ryusuke Hamazaki
Abstract: Nonstabilizerness, or magic, constitutes a fundamental resource for quantum computation and a crucial ingredient for quantum advantage. Recent progress has substantially advanced the characterization of magic in many-body quantum systems, with stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE) emerging as a computable and experimentally accessible measure. In this work, we investigate the spreading of SRE in terms of single-qubit reduced density matrices, where an initial product state that contains magic in a local region evolves under brickwork random Clifford circuits. For the case with Haar-random local Clifford gates, we find that the spreading profile exhibits a diffusive structure within a ballistic light cone when viewed through a normalized version of single-qubit SRE, despite the absence of explicit conserved charges. We further examine the robustness of this non-ballistic behavior of the normalized single-qubit SRE spreading by extending the analysis to a restricted Clifford circuit, where we unveil a superdiffusive spreading. Finally, we discuss that a similar non-ballistic spreading within the light cone is found for another indicator of the magic, i.e., the robustness of magic.

Title: Geometric Categories for Continuous Gauging
Authors: Devon Stockall, Matthew Yu
Abstract: We develop a unified categorical framework for gauging both continuous and finite symmetries in arbitrary spacetime dimensions. Our construction applies to geometric categories i.e. categories internal to stacks. This generalizes the familiar setting of fusion categories, which describe finite group symmetries, to the case of Lie group symmetries. Within this framework, we obtain a functorial Symmetry Topological Field Theory together with its natural boundaries, allowing us to compute associated endomorphism categories and Drinfeld centers in a uniform way. For a given symmetry group $G$, our framework recovers the electric and magnetic higher-form symmetries expected in $G$-gauge theory. Moreover, it naturally encodes electric breaking symmetry in the presence of charged matter, reproducing known physical phenomena in a categorical setting.

Title: Exploring the Infrared Landscape of the SYK Model
Authors: Weam Abou Hamdan, Damián A. Galante
Abstract: We analyse a class of SYK models whose Hamiltonian is the sum of two SYK Hamiltonians with different numbers of fermions $q, \tilde q$ in each interaction. We consider both Euclidean and Lorentzian probes of the quantum system in the large $N$ limit. In the strong coupling phase, the entropy provides a diagnostic of the thermal renormalisation group flow. Under certain conditions, two parametrically separated regimes of near-conformal behaviour emerge. The first reproduces the standard linear-in-temperature scaling characteristic of the single SYK model. The system then flows to another near-fixed point whose entropy scaling depends on the ratio $n = q/\tilde q$. For $n<3/2$, the entropy exhibits anomalous, stronger-than-linear scaling in temperature. At $n=3/2$, there is an additional logarithmic enhancement. Using conformal perturbation theory, we argue that in the infrared regime of the SYK model, there may exist disordered conformal operators with dimensions $1 < \Delta \leq 3/2$. In Lorentzian signature, we study the out-of-time-ordered correlator and show that these deformed theories exhibit near-maximal chaos in both regimes (when they exist). We comment on the relation between the anomalous scalings found here and those observed in certain near-extremal black holes in two and higher dimensions.

Title: Nature is stingy: Universality of Scrooge ensembles in quantum many-body systems
Authors: Wai-Keong Mok, Tobias Haug, Wen Wei Ho, John Preskill
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum simulators allow direct experimental access to ensembles of pure states generated by measuring part of an isolated quantum many-body system. These projected ensembles encode fine-grained information beyond thermal expectation values and provide a new window into quantum thermalization. In chaotic dynamics, projected ensembles exhibit universal statistics governed by maximum-entropy principles, known as deep thermalization. At infinite temperature this universality is characterized by Haar-random ensembles. More generally, physical constraints such as finite temperature or conservation laws lead to Scrooge ensembles, which are maximally entropic distributions of pure states consistent with these constraints. Here we introduce Scrooge $k$-designs, which approximate Scrooge ensembles, and use this framework to sharpen the conditions under which Scrooge-like behavior emerges. We first show that global Scrooge designs arise from long-time chaotic unitary dynamics alone, without measurements. Second, we show that measuring a complementary subsystem of a scrambled global state drawn from a global Scrooge $2k$-design induces a local Scrooge $k$-design. Third, we show that a local Scrooge $k$-design arises from an arbitrary entangled state when the complementary system is measured in a scrambled basis induced by a unitary drawn from a Haar $2k$-design. These results show that the resources required to generate approximate Scrooge ensembles scale only with the desired degree of approximation, enabling efficient implementations. Complementing our analytical results, numerical simulations identify coherence, entanglement, non-stabilizerness, and information scrambling as essential ingredients for the emergence of Scrooge-like behavior. Together, our findings advance theoretical explanations for maximally entropic, information-stingy randomness in quantum many-body systems.

Title: Quantum Extreme Reservoir Computing for Phase Classification of Polymer Alloy Microstructures
Authors: Arisa Ikeda, Akitada Sakurai, Kae Nemoto, Mayu Muramatsu
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) is expected to offer new opportunities to process high-dimensional data efficiently by exploiting the exponentially large state space of quantum systems. In this work, we apply quantum extreme reservoir computing (QERC) to the classification of microstructure images of polymer alloys generated using self-consistent field theory (SCFT). While previous QML efforts have primarily focused on benchmark datasets such as MNIST, our work demonstrates the applicability of QERC to engineering data with direct materials relevance. Through numerical experiments, we examine the influence of key computational parameters-including the number of qubits, sampling cost (the number of measurement shots), and reservoir configuration-on classification performance. The resulting phase classifications are depicted as phase diagrams that illustrate the phase transitions in polymer morphology, establishing an understandable connection between quantum model outputs and material behavior. These results illustrate QERC performance on realistic materials datasets and suggest practical guidelines for quantum encoder design and model generalization. This work establishes a foundation for integrating quantum learning techniques into materials informatics.
