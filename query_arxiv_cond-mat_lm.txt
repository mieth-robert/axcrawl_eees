Title: Phonon-mediated electron attraction in SrTiO$_3$ via the generalized Fr\"ohlich and deformation potential mechanisms
Authors: Norm M. Tubman, Christopher J.N. Coveney, Chih-En Hsu, Andres Montoya-Castillo, Marina R. Filip, Jeffrey B. Neaton, Zhenglu Li, Vojtech Vlcek, Antonios M. Alvertis
Abstract: Superconductivity in doped SrTiO$_3$ was discovered in 1964, the first superconducting transition observed in a doped semiconductor. However, the mechanism behind electron pairing in SrTiO$_3$ remains a subject of debate. By developing a theoretical framework to incorporate dynamical lattice screening in the electronic Coulomb interactions of semiconductors and insulators, we demonstrate analytically that long-range electron-phonon interactions described by a generalized multi-phonon Fröhlich mechanism result in phonon-mediated electron-electron attraction in SrTiO$_3$. Moreover, by combining our theory with first-principles calculations, we reveal an additional attractive interaction between electrons in SrTiO$_3$ due to the deformation potential mechanism, arising from the mixed ionic-covalent character of the Ti-O bond. Our results may have implications for the emergence of phonon-mediated electron attraction and superconductivity in a broader range of materials.

Title: Emergent multifractality in power-law decaying eigenstates
Authors: Adway Kumar Das, Anandamohan Ghosh, Ivan M. Khaymovich
Abstract: Eigenstate multifractality is of significant interest with potential applications in various fields of quantum physics. Most of the previous studies concentrated on fine-tuned quantum models to realize multifractality which is generally believed to be a critical phenomenon and fragile to random perturbations. In this work, we propose a set of generic principles based on the power-law decay of the eigenstates which allow us to distinguish a fractal phase from a genuine multifractal phase. We demonstrate the above principles in a 1d tight-binding model with inhomogeneous nearest-neighbor hopping that can be mapped to the standard quantum harmonic oscillator via energy-coordinate duality. We analytically calculate the fractal dimensions and the spectrum of fractal dimensions which are in agreement with numerical simulations.

Title: A novel Gapless Quantum Spin Liquid in the S = 1 4d4-honeycomb material Cu3LiRu2O6
Authors: Sanjay Bachhar, Nashra Pistawala, S. Kundu, Maneesha Barik, M. Baenitz, Jorg Sichelschmidt, Koji Yokoyama, P. Khuntia, Surjeet Singh, A.V. Mahajan
Abstract: We report the discovery of a novel gapless quantum spin liquid in the S=1 honeycomb system Cu3LiRu2O6 with Ru4+ (4d4) where moments remain dynamic down to 50 mK. Heat capacity measurements show no sign of magnetic ordering down to 60 mK in spite of a Curie-Weiss temperature = -222 K indicating a strong antiferromagnetic interaction. In zero field, magnetic heat capacity shows a linear T-dependence with Sommerfeld coefficient = 107 mJ/mol K2 is much larger than that found in typical Fermi liquids. Our local probe 7Li nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements find a significant temperature-independent 7Li NMR shift (and hence a non-zero spin susceptibility) at low-T and a linear T-variation of the 7Li NMR spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T1 at low-T reminiscent of fermionic excitations. Muon spin relaxation measurements detect neither long-range ordering nor spin freezing down to 50 mK and the temperature variation of the muon depolarization rate shows a gradual increase with decreasing temperature and a leveling off below about 1 K evincing a persistent spin dynamics common to several spin liquid candidates. Our results provide strong signatures of a quantum spin liquid in the titled honeycomb material.

Title: Linear-time classical approximate optimization of cubic-lattice classical spin glasses
Authors: Adil A. Gangat
Abstract: Computing low-energy configurations (i.e., approximate optimization) of classical spin glasses is of relevance to both condensed matter and combinatorial optimization. Recent theoretical work opens the possibility to make its time complexity with quantum annealing generically polynomial, and D-Wave experiments can now achieve approximate optimization of cubic-lattice classical Ising spin glasses with $\sim$$10^4$ spins. It is therefore timely to ask which short-range classical spin glasses are good candidates for demonstrating quantum advantage in the time complexity of approximate optimization. One intuition is to consider models with very rugged energy landscapes in configuration space, where optimization is extremely slow with state-of-the-art Monte-Carlo methods. However, here we provide evidence that short-range classical spin glasses may be approximately optimized in linear time and space with a very simple deterministic tensor-network heuristic regardless of ruggedness. On the cubic lattice with up to 50$\times$50$\times$50 spins, we obtain energy errors of $\lesssim$3\% for the $\pm J$ model used in recent D-Wave experiments, and $\lesssim$5\% for much harder planted-solution instances, all in less than one hour per instance. For cubic-lattice-Ising reductions of unweighted Max-Cut on random 3-regular graphs with up to 300 vertices, we find energy errors of $<$1\% and approximation ratios of about 72-88\%. These results inform the search for quantum advantage and suggest an efficient classical method for generating warm starts for other spin-glass optimization algorithms. Our algorithm is amenable to massive parallelization and may also allow for low-power, accelerated implementations with photonic matrix-multiplication hardware.

Title: On the first positive position of a random walker
Authors: Claude Godrèche, Jean-Marc Luck
Abstract: The distribution of the first positive position reached by a random walker starting from the origin is fundamental for understanding the statistics of extremes and records in one-dimensional random walks. We present a comprehensive study of this distribution, focusing particularly on its moments and asymptotic tail behaviour, in the case where the step distribution is continuous and symmetric, encompassing both diffusive random walks and Lévy flights.

Title: Engineering Point Defects in MoS2 for Tailored Material Properties using Large Language Models
Authors: Abdalaziz Al-Maeeni, Denis Derkach, Andrey Ustyuzhanin
Abstract: The tunability of physical properties in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) through point defect engineering offers significant potential for the development of next-generation optoelectronic and high-tech applications. Building upon prior work on machine learning-driven material design, this study focuses on the systematic introduction and manipulation of point defects in MoS2 to tailor their properties. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset generated via density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we explore the effects of various defect types and concentrations on the mate rial characteristics of TMDCs. Our methodology integrates the use of pre-trained large language models to generate defect configurations, enabling efficient predictions of defect-induced property modifications. This research differs from traditional methods of material generation and discovery by utilizing the latest advances in transformer model architecture, which have proven to be efficient and accurate discrete predictors. In contrast to high-throughput methods where configurations are generated randomly and then screened based on their physical properties, our approach not only enhances the understanding of defect-property relationships in TMDCs but also provides a robust framework for designing materials with bespoke properties. This facilitates the advancement of materials science and technology.

Title: Nonequilibrium Green's Function Formalism Applicable to Discrete Impurities in Semiconductor Nanostructures
Authors: Nobuyuki Sano
Abstract: A new theoretical framework for the nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) scheme is presented to account for the discrete nature of impurities doped in semiconductor nanostructures. The short-range part of impurity potential is included as scattering potential in the self-energy due to spatially localized impurity scattering, and the long-range part of impurity potential is treated as the self-consistent Hartree potential by coupling with the Poisson equation. The position-dependent impurity scattering rate under inhomogeneous impurity profiles is systematically derived so that its physical meaning is clarified. The position dependence of the scattering rate turns out to be represented by the `center of mass' coordinates in the Wigner coordinates, rather than the real-space coordinates. Consequently, impurity scattering is intrinsically nonlocal in space. The proposed framework is applied to cylindrical thin wires under the quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) approximation. We show explicitly how the discrete nature of impurities affects the transport properties such as electrostatic potential, local density of states, carrier density, scattering rates, and mobility.

Title: Phase transition in quasi-flat band superconductors
Authors: A. A. Zyuzin, A. Yu. Zyuzin
Abstract: We investigate superconductivity in a two-dimensional material described by a two-band heavy-fermion model, where hybridization between a dispersive band and a flat band introduces a quasi-flat dispersion to the otherwise localized flat-band electrons. The enhanced density of states in the quasi-flat band raises the crossover temperature for an inhomogeneous preformed Cooper pair state. The superconducting phase stiffness and the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) temperature are governed by the Fermi surface contribution induced by hybridization. We compute the crossover and BKT temperatures, revealing a dome-like dependence on doping. When the pairing amplitude exceeds the energy width of the quasi-flat band, superconductivity is suppressed, and the inhomogeneous pairing regime expands linearly with increasing interaction strength. However, in the opposite case, the BKT temperature reaches a maximum value that is only numerically less than the energy width of the quasi-flat band. We also discuss our results in the context of superconductivity in graphene-based systems.

Title: L\'evy noise effects on Josephson junctions
Authors: Claudio Guarcello
Abstract: We review three different approaches to investigate the non-equilibrium stochastic dynamics of a Josephson junction affected by Lévy-distributed current fluctuations. First, we study the lifetime in the metastable superconducting state of current-biased short and long junctions, in the presence of Gaussian and Lévy noise sources. We highlight the noise-induced nonmonotonic behavior of the mean switching time as a function of noise intensity and driving frequency, that is the noise enhanced stability and the stochastic resonant activation, respectively. Then, we characterize the Lévy noise source through the average voltage drop across a current-biased junction. The voltage measurement versus the noise intensity allows to infer the value of the stability index that characterizes Lévy-distributed fluctuations. The numerical calculation of the average voltage drop across the junction well agrees with the analytical estimate of the average velocity for Lévy-driven escape processes from a metastable state. Finally, we look at the distribution of switching currents out of the zero-voltage state, when a Lévy noise signal is added to a linearly ramped bias current. The analysis of the cumulative distribution function of the switching currents gives information on both the Lévy stability index and the intensity of fluctuations. We present also a theoretical model to catch the features of the Lévy signal from a measured distribution of switching currents. The phenomena discussed in this work can pave the way for an effective and reliable Josephson-based scheme to characterize Lévy components eventually embedded in an unknown noisy signal.

Title: Two-dimensional talc as a natural hyperbolic material
Authors: Flávio H. Feresa, Francisco C. B. Maia, Shu Chen, Rafael A. Mayer, Maximillian Obst, Osama Hatem, Lukas Wehmeier, Tobias Nörenberg, Matheus S. Queiroz, Victor Mazzotti, J. Michael Klopf, Susanne C. Kehr, Lukas M. Eng, Alisson R. Cadore, Rainer Hillenbrand, Raul O. Freitas, Ingrid D. Barcelos
Abstract: This study demonstrates that two-dimensional talc, a naturally abundant mineral, supports hyperbolic phonon-polaritons (HPhPs) at mid-infrared wavelengths, thus offering a low-cost alternative to synthetic polaritonic materials. Using scattering scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM) and synchrotron infrared nano spectroscopy (SINS), we reveal tunable HPhP modes in talc flakes of a long lifetime. These results highlight the potential of natural 2D talc crystals to constituting an effective platform for establishing scalable optoelectronic and photonic devices.

Title: Role of interface mixing on coherent heat conduction in periodic and aperiodic superlattices
Authors: Theodore Maranets, Evan Doe, Yan Wang
Abstract: Superlattices (SLs) can induce phonon coherence through the periodic layering of two or more materials, enabling tailored thermal transport properties. While most theoretical studies assume atomically sharp, perfect interfaces, real SLs often feature atomic interdiffusion spanning approximately a single atomic layer or more. Such interface mixing can significantly influence phonon coherence and transport behavior. In this study, we employ atomistic wave-packet simulations to systematically investigate the effects of interface mixing on coherent heat conduction. Our analysis identifies two competing mechanisms that govern phonon transport across mixed interfaces: (1) Interface mixing disrupts coherent mode-conversion effects arising from the interface arrangement. (2) The disorder enhances the potential for interference events, generating additional coherent phonon transport pathways. The second mechanism enhances the transmission of Bragg-reflected modes in periodic SLs and most phonons in aperiodic SLs, which otherwise lack coherent mode-conversion in perfect structures. Conversely, the first mechanism dominates in periodic SLs for non-Bragg-reflected modes, where transmission is already high due to substantial mode-conversion. These findings provide insights into the interplay between interface imperfections and phonon coherence.

Title: Singularity and universality from von Neumann to R\'enyi entanglement entropy and disorder operator in Motzkin chains
Authors: Jianyu Wang, Zenan Liu, Zheng Yan, Congjun Wu
Abstract: The Rényi entanglement entropy is widely used in studying quantum entanglement properties in strongly correlated systems, whose analytic continuation as $n \to 1$ is often believed to give rise to the celebrated von Neumann entanglement entropy. However, this process for the colored Motzkin spin chain exhibits a singularity that yields different scaling behaviors of $\sim \sqrt{l}$ and $\sim \log{l}$ for the von Neumann and Rényi entropies, respectively. It can be understood by the exponential increasing desity of states in its entanglement spectrum. We have also employed disorder operators under various symmetries to study such a system. The analytical and numerical results reveal that the scaling of disorder operators is also $\log{l}$ in the leading term, the same as the Rényi entanglement entropy. We propose that the coefficient of the term $\log{l}$ $l$ is a universal constant, both in Rényi entropies and disorder operators, which could be used to identify the constraint physics of Motzkin walks.

Title: Anomalous proximity effect of a spin-singlet superconductor with a spin-orbit interaction
Authors: Jaechul Lee, Satoshi Ikegaya, Yasuhiro Asano
Abstract: The anomalous proximity effect of a spin-triplet p-wave superconductor has been known as a part of the Majorana physics. We demonstrate that a spin-singlet d-wave superconductor exhibits the anomalous proximity effect in the presence of a specific spin-orbit interaction. The results show the quantization of the zero-bias conductance in a dirty normal-metal/superconductor junction. We also discuss a relation between our findings and results in an experiment on a CoSi_2/TiSi_2 junction.

Title: Photo-induced spall failure of (111) twist grain boundaries in Ni bicrystals
Authors: Mewael Isiet, Mauricio Ponga
Abstract: Spall failure, a complex failure mechanism driven by tensile stress wave interactions, has been extensively studied in single-crystal FCC metals, revealing a precursor stage involving dislocation emission along closed-packed directions. Here we investigate the photo-induced spall failure of Ni bicrystals under a two-pulse laser configuration, exploring various misorientation angles through two-temperature molecular dynamics (MD) simulations including electronic effects to simulate light-matter interaction. Our findings demonstrate that light-matter interactions can induce spall failure at the sample center, similar to conventional plate-impact methods, when two laser-pulses are applied to the front and back surfaces of the sample. The study reveals the significant influence of misorientation angles on dislocation activity and spall behavior, where grain boundaries (GBs) play pivotal roles, either promoting or impeding dislocation interactions. Furthermore, our work highlights the potential for enhancing spall resistance by tailoring materials through misorientation angle variation.

Title: Quantitative Modeling of Point Defects in $\beta$-Ga2O3 Combining Hybrid Functional Energetics with Semiconductor and Processes Thermodynamics
Authors: Khandakar Aaditta Arnab, Megan Stephens, Isaac Maxfield, Channyung Lee, Elif Ertekin, Ymir K. Frodason, Joel B. Varley, Michael A. Scarpulla
Abstract: B-gallium oxide (B-Ga2O3) is of high interest for power electronics because of its unique combination of melt growth, epitaxial growth, n-type dopability, ultrawide bandgap, and high critical field. Optimization of crystal growth processes to promote beneficial defects and suppress harmful ones requires accurate quantitative modelling of both native and impurity defects. Here we quantitatively model defect concentrations as a function of bulk crystal growth conditions and demonstrate the necessity of including effects such as bandgap temperature dependence, chemical potentials from thermochemistry, and defect vibrational entropy in modelling based on defect formation energies computed by density functional theory (DFT) with hybrid functionals. Without these contributions, grossly-erroneous and misleading predictions arise, e.g. that n-type doping attempts would be fully compensated by Ga vacancies. Including these effects reproduces the experimental facts that melt-grown Sn-doped B-Ga2O3 crystals are conductive with small compensation while annealing the same crystals in O2 at intermediate temperatures renders them insulating. To accomplish this modeling, we developed a comprehensive modelling framework (KROGER) based on calculated defect formation energies and flexible thermodynamic conditions. These capabilities allow KROGER to capture full and partial defect equilibria amongst native defects and impurities occurring during specific semiconductor growth or fabrication processes. We use KROGER to model 873 charge-states of 259 defects involving 19 elements in conditions representing bulk crystal growth by edge-fed growth (EFG) and annealing in O2. Our methodology is transferrable to a wide range of materials beyond B-Ga2O3. Integration of thermodynamic and first-principles modelling of point defects provides insight into optimization of point defect populations in growth and processing.

Title: Describing Self-organized Criticality as a continuous phase transition
Authors: S. S. Manna
Abstract: Can the concept of self-organized criticality, exemplified by models such as the sandpile model, be described within the framework of continuous phase transitions? In this paper, we provide extensive numerical evidence supporting an affirmative answer. Specifically, we explore the BTW and Manna sandpile models as instances of percolation transitions from disordered to ordered phases. To facilitate this analysis, we introduce the concept of drop density, a continuously adjustable control variable that quantifies the average number of particles added to a site. By tuning this variable, we observe a transition in the sandpile from a sub-critical to a critical phase. Additionally, we define the scaled size of the largest avalanche occurring from the beginning of the sandpile as the order parameter for the self-organized critical transition and analyze its scaling behavior. Furthermore, we calculate the correlation length exponent and note its divergence as the critical point is approached. The finite size scaling analysis of the avalanche size distribution works quite well at the critical point of the BTW sandpile.

Title: Chiral Altermagnon in MnTe
Authors: Daniel Jost, Resham B. Regmi, Samuel Sahel-Schackis, Monika Scheufele, Marcel Neuhaus, Rachel Nickel, Flora Yakhou, Kurt Kummer, Nicholas Brookes, Lingjia Shen, Georgi L. Dakovski, Nirmal J. Ghimire, Stephan Geprägs, Matthias F. Kling
Abstract: Altermagnetism has surfaced as a novel magnetic phase, bridging the properties of ferro- and anti-ferromagnetism. The momentum-dependent spin-splitting observed in these materials reflects their unique symmetry characteristics which also establish the conditions for chiral magnons to emerge. Here we provide the first direct experimental evidence for a chiral magnon in the altermagnetic candidate MnTe, revealed by circular-dichroism resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (CD-RIXS). This mode which we term chiral altermagnon exhibits a distinct momentum dependence consistent with the proposed altermagnetic $g-$wave symmetry of MnTe. Our results reveal a new class of magnetic excitations, demonstrating how altermagnetic order shapes spin dynamics and paves the way for advances in spintronic and quantum technologies.

Title: Effect of metal (Ti) interlayer on fracture toughness of TiN thin films
Authors: Nidhin George Mathews, Aloshious Lambai, Marcus Hans, Jochen M. Schneider, Gaurav Mohanty, Balila Nagamani Jaya
Abstract: Titanium Nitride (TiN) is widely used as a protective coating due to its high hardness, but suffers from inherent brittleness and low fracture toughness, limiting its applicability. The layering of Titanium Nitride films with metallic Titanium (Ti) improves the overall fracture behavior of system by modifying the crack driving force due to elastic-plastic mismatch between the layers. Microcantilever fracture tests were carried out on bilayer (Ti-TiN, TiN-Ti) and trilayer (Ti-TiN-Ti) systems to determine the fracture toughness and study the fundamental crack growth behavior. The initiation fracture toughness in bilayer system with crack in Ti layer is almost 70% higher when compared to crack in TiN layer. In Ti-TiN bilayer the crack propagated catastrophically post linear elastic deformation, whereas the crack was arrested at the TiN/Ti interface in both TiN-Ti and Ti-TiN-Ti systems due to plastic energy dissipation in the Ti layer. Incorpration of crack tip plasticity due to the metallic layer increased the total resistance to fracture by around eight times compared to the Ti-TiN bilayer.

Title: Spin-forbidden excitations in the magneto-optical spectra of CrI$_3$ tuned by covalency
Authors: Connor A. Occhialini, Luca Nessi, Luiz G. P. Martins, Ahmet Kemal Demir, Qian Song, Vicky Hasse, Chandra Shekhar, Claudia Felser, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Valentina Bisogni, Jonathan Pelliciari, Riccardo Comin
Abstract: Spin-forbidden ($\Delta S \neq 0$) multiplet excitations and their coupling to magnetic properties are of increasing importance for magneto-optical studies of correlated materials. Nonetheless, the mechanisms for optically brightening these transitions and their generality remain poorly understood. Here, we report magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopy on the van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnet (FM) CrI$_3$. Previously unreported spin-forbidden ($\Delta S = 1$) ${}^4A_{2\mathrm{g}} \to{}^2E_\mathrm{g}/{}^2T_{1\mathrm{g}}$ Cr${}^{3+}$ $dd$ excitations are observed near the ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) excitation threshold. The assignment of these excitations and their Cr$^{3+}$ multiplet character is established through complementary Cr $L_3$-edge resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) measurements along with charge transfer multiplet (CTM) calculations and chemical trends in the chromium trihalide series (CrX$_3$, X = Cl, Br, I). We utilize the high sensitivity of MCD spectroscopy to study the thickness dependent optical response. The spin-forbidden excitations remain robust down to the monolayer limit and exhibit a significant magnetic field tunability across the antiferromagnetic to FM transition in few-layer samples. This behavior is associated to changes in the metal-ligand covalency with magnetic state, as supported by our CTM analysis. Our results clarify the magneto-optical response of CrI$_3$ and identify covalency as a central mechanism for the brightening and field-tunability of spin-forbidden multiplet excitations.

Title: Diagonal superexchange in a simple square CuO$_2$ lattice
Authors: V. A. Gavrichkov, S. I. Polukeev, S. G. Ovchinnikov
Abstract: Many microscopic models with interaction between the next-nearest neighbours as a key parameter to cuprate physics inspired us to study here the diagonal superexchange interaction in the CuO$_2$ layer. Our investigation shows the models with extended hopping give a correct representation of magnetic interactions only in a hypothetical square CuO$_2$ layer, where the diagonal superexchange interaction with the next-nearest neighbours neighbors always has the AFM nature. The conclusions are based on the presence of a symmetry prohibition on the FM contribution to the total diagonal superexchange between the next-nearest neighbors for a simple square CuO$_2$ layer, but not for the real CuO$_2$ layer. We actually confirm also there are justified reasons to consider magnetic frustrations and high sensitivity of spin nanoinhomogeneity to a breaking square symmetry.

Title: Enhancement of superconductivity on thin film of Sn under high pressure
Authors: Misaki Sasaki, Masahiro Ohkuma, Ryo Matsumoto, Toru Shinmei, Tetsuo Irifune, Yoshihiko Takano, Katsuya Shimizu
Abstract: We investigated the pressure effects of a superconductivity on thin films of Sn. Elemental superconductor Sn with a body-centered tetragonal structure, $\beta$-Sn, exhibits superconductivity below the superconducting transition temperature ($T_{\rm c}=3.72$ K) at ambient pressure. $T_{\rm c}$ of Sn increases with lowering dimension such as in thin film and nanowire growth, or by high-pressure application. For thin films, $T_{\rm c}$ exhibits a slight increase up to approximately 4 K compared to the bulk value, attributable to the crystalline size and lattice disorder. By applying pressure on a bulk Sn, $T_{\rm c}$ decreases with increasing pressure from 3.72 K to 5.3 K with the structural transformation into $\gamma$-Sn around 10 GPa. However, the combination of these effects on thin films of Sn, namely, thin-film growth and pressure effects, remains underexplored. In this study, we combined film-growth and pressure-application techniques to further increase $T_{\rm c}$ using a diamond anvil cell with boron-doped diamond electrodes. The drop of the electrical resistance suggesting the onset of $T_{\rm c}$ on the thin film reached above 6 K in $\gamma$-Sn phase. Further, the upper critical magnetic field was drastically enhanced. Atomic force microscopy suggests that the refinement of the grain size of the thin film under the non-hydrostatic pressure conditions contributes to stabilizing the higher $T_{\rm c}$ of $\gamma$-Sn.

Title: Magnetic metastability driven Anomalous Hall Effect in Fe$_{x}$TaS$_2$
Authors: Mohamad Numan, Prasanta Chowdhury, Sanat Adhikary, Saurav Giri, Jhuma Sannigrahi, Matthias Gutmann, Souvik Chatterjee, Subham Majumdar
Abstract: We have investigated the magnetic and transport properties of Fe-intercalated TaS$2$ single crystals. The material exhibits ferromagnetic order with very high anisotropy, with the $c$-axis as the easy axis. The magnetic moments of the compound become arrested during field cooling in magnetic fields above 500 Oe. As a result, it retains thermoremanent magnetization (TRM) up to the transition temperature ($T_C$). Fe$_{x}$TaS$_2$ displays a large anomalous Hall effect (AHE) with a pronounced hysteresis loop, similar to the isothermal magnetization. Our key observation suggests that the presence of TRM breaks the time-reversal symmetry below $T_C$, producing an AHE in zero applied field with the same value as that obtained from typical field variation. Scaling analysis indicates that skew scattering is the primary mechanism for the observed AHE.

Title: Third-order rectification in centrosymmetric metals
Authors: Sanjay Sarkar, Amit Agarwal
Abstract: Rectification, the conversion of AC fields into DC currents, is crucial for optoelectronic applications such as energy harvesting and wireless communication. However, it is conventionally absent in centrosymmetric systems due to vanishing second-order optical responses. Here, we demonstrate significant rectification and photogalvanic currents in centrosymmetric metals via third-order nonlinear optical responses, driven by finite Fermi surface and disorder-induced contributions. We unveil distinct band geometric mechanisms -- including Berry curvature quadrupole, Fermi surface injection, and shift effects -- and classify all symmetry-allowed rectification responses. Using graphene as an example, we illustrate rectification tunability via light polarization and helicity, enabling rectification engineering in centrosymmetric materials for energy-efficient photodetection and terahertz applications.

Title: Direct Observation of Vortices and Antivortices Generation in Phase-Separated Superconductor Sn-Pb Solder
Authors: Hiroto Arima, Takumi Murakami, Yuto Kinoshita, Hossein Sepehri-Amin, Masashi Tokunaga, Tsutomu Nojima, Yoshikazu Mizuguchi
Abstract: Quantized vortices in type-II superconductors provide insights into the mechanisms of superconductivity. However, the generation of antivortices, characterized by magnetization antiparallel to the external magnetic field, remains less understood. In this study, we investigate Sn-Pb solder, a superconductor with phase-separated Sn and Pb phases, and report the observation of both vortices and antivortices. Scanning SQUID (superconducting quantum interference device) microscopy revealed the presence of both vortices and antivortices, while magneto-optical imaging demonstrated flux avalanches. Our results demonstrate that Sn in Sn-Pb solder behaves as a type-II superconductor when magnetic fluxes are trapped, despite bulk Sn being a type-I superconductor with a transition temperature (TcSn) of 3.7 K. Our findings suggest that the size effect and proximity effect with Pb contribute synergistically to induce type-II superconductivity in Sn Notably, vortices were observed at temperatures as high as 5 K, exceeding the bulk TcSn. Furthermore, the interplay between the type-I superconducting Pb phase and the type-II superconducting Sn phase results in the generation of antivortices, providing a mechanism to accommodate excess magnetic flux. This study shed light on new research on composites combining type-I and type-II superconductors.

Title: Bacterial dimensions sensitively regulate surface diffusivity and residence time
Authors: Premkumar Leishangthem, Xuan Wang, Junan Chen, Shengqi Yang, Xinliang Xu
Abstract: Run-and-tumble is a common but vital strategy that bacteria employ to explore environment suffused with boundaries, as well as to escape from entrapment. In this study we reveal how this strategy and the resulting dynamical behavior can be sensitively regulated by bacterial dimensions. Our results demonstrate that the logarithm of the surface residence time for bacteria with constant tumble bias is linearly related to a dimensionless parameter of bacterial intrinsic size characteristics, where a small variation in bacterial dimensions, which is natural in a suspension, reproduces well the experimentally observed large variation in bacterial residence time. Furthermore, our results predict that the optimal tumble bias corresponding to the maximum surface diffusivity depends strongly on bacterial dimensions, where the same small variation in bacterial dimensions gives rise to a strongly diversified optimal tumble bias and an order of magnitude change in surface diffusivity.

Title: Electron trapping via magnetic and laser fields in gapped graphene quantum dots
Authors: Ahmed Bouhlal, Mohammed El Azar, Aotmane En Naciri, Elmustapha Feddi, Ahmed Jellal
Abstract: We study electron scattering in graphene quantum dots (GQDs) under the combined influence of a magnetic field, an energy gap, and circularly polarized laser irradiation. Using the Floquet approach and the Dirac equation, we derive the energy spectrum solutions. The scattering coefficients are calculated explicitly by matching the eigenspinors at the GQD interfaces, revealing a dependence on several physical parameters. In addition, we compute the scattering efficiency, the electron density distribution, and the lifetime of the quasi-bound states. Our numerical results show that the presence of an energy gap and circularly polarized laser irradiation enhances the localization of the electron density within the GQDs, leading to an increase in the lifetime of the quasi-bound states. In particular, the intensity and polarization of the light influence the scattering process, allowing the manipulation of the electron confinement state. These results highlight the importance of combining magnetic fields and polarized light to control electronic transport in graphene nanostructures.

Title: Quasi-two-dimensional Fermi surfaces of the antiferromagnet U$_2$RhIn$_8$ revealed by de Haas-van Alphen measurements
Authors: D. Aoki, Y. Homma, H. Harima, I. Sheikin
Abstract: We report temperature-dependent Hall effect and low-temperature de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) effect measurements of the antiferromagnetic heavy-fermion compound U$_2$RhIn$_8$. Temperature dependence of the Hall resistivity suggests a considerable reduction of the carrier density in the antiferromagnetic phase. The observed angular dependence of the dHvA frequencies suggests the existence of three almost ideally two-dimensional Fermi surfaces one of which is quite large. The measured effective masses range from 2$m_0$ to 14$m_0$ for the field applied along the $c$ axis. Local density approximation band-structure calculations performed for the paramagnetic ground state reveal more three-dimensional Fermi surfaces than those observed in the experiment. On the other hand, Fermi surfaces obtained for the antiferromagnetic ground state by band folding are more two dimensional. These calculations account reasonably well for the experimental results assuming a slight modification of the calculated Fermi surfaces.

Title: Selective Fabrication of Monolayer 1H- and 1T'-WTe2
Authors: Ryuichi Ando, Katsuaki Sugawara, Tappei Kawakami, Takashi Takahashi, Takafumi Sato
Abstract: We selectively fabricated monolayers of octahedral (1H) and distorted trigonal (1T') WTe2 on graphene/SiC(0001) by controlling the substrate temperature during epitaxy. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, combined with first-principles band-structure calculations, has revealed several drastic differences between these two polymorphs. The 1T' phase exhibits a semiconducting character with a nearly-zero energy gap, while the 1H phase shows a large band gap and the band splitting at the K/K' point. The present results pave a pathway toward developing nanoelectronic devices based with WTe2.

Title: Unusual temperature dependence of the band structure associated with local atomic distortion in monolayer 1T'-WTe2
Authors: Ryuichi Ando, Katsuaki Sugawara, Tappei Kawakami, Koki Yanagizawa, Ken Yaegashi, Takashi Takahashi, Takafumi Sato
Abstract: The ground state of monolayer 1T'-WTe2 has been a target of intensive debate on whether or not it is a two-dimensional topological insulator (2D TI) associated with exciton formation. We investigated the band structure of an epitaxial monolayer 1T'-WTe2 film grown on graphene/SiC(0001) in a wide temperature range of T = 40 - 400 K by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). We observed an electron band above the Fermi level (EF) slightly away from the {\Gamma} point, together with four hole bands below EF just at the {\Gamma} point. This signifies an indirect band gap exceeding 0.1 eV in support of the 2D-TI phase with the inverted band structure. We uncovered an unexpectedly large downward shift of valence bands upon cooling, accompanied with an upward shift of the conduction band. Comparison of the ARPES-derived band structure with first-principles band calculations suggests that the observed band shift is ascribed to the systematic local atomic distortion of tungsten atoms, which should be incorporated into the interpretation of unusual transport properties of 1T'-WTe2.

Title: Quantifying the amplitudes of ultrafast magnetization fluctuations in Sm$_{0.7}$Er$_{0.3}$FeO$_{3}$ using femtosecond noise correlation spectroscopy
Authors: M. A. Weiss, F. S. Herbst, G. Skobjin, S. Eggert, M. Nakajima, D. Reustlen, A. Leitenstorfer, S. T. B. Goennenwein, T. Kurihara
Abstract: Spin fluctuations are an important issue for the design and operation of future spintronic devices. Femtosecond noise correlation spectroscopy (FemNoC) was recently applied to detect ultrafast magnetization fluctuations. FemNoC gives direct access to the spontaneous fluctuations of the magnetization in magnetically ordered materials. In FemNoC experiments, the magnetic fluctuations are imprinted on the polarization state of two independent femtosecond probe pulses upon transmission through a magnetic sample. Using a subharmonic demodulation scheme, the cross-correlation of the signals from both pulse trains is calculated. Here, we quantitatively link the FemNoC output signal to an optical polarization rotation, and then in turn to the magnitude of the inherent spin fluctuations. To this end, three different calibration protocols are presented and compared in accuracy. Ultimately, we quantitatively determine both the variance of optical polarization noise in rad$^2$, and that of the ultrafast magnetization fluctuations in (A/m)$^2$.

Title: Mechanism of Oleic Acid-Mediated Sulfur Vacancy Healing in monolayer WS$_2$
Authors: Leon Daniel, Dedi Sutarma, Osamah Kharsah, Charleen Lintz, Peter Kratzer, Marika Schleberger
Abstract: We uncover the mechanism behind the enhancement of photoluminescence yield in monolayer WS$_2$ through oleic acid treatment, a promising scalable strategy for defect healing. By inducing sulfur vacancies through thermal treatment and monitoring the changes in photoluminescence yield and emission spectra, we demonstrate that oleic acid heals the sulfur vacancy by providing substitutional oxygen. Using density functional theory calculations, we provide insight into the underlying mechanism governing the oleic acid-mediated sulfur vacancy healing process. Our findings suggest that effective defect passivation by oxygen doping can be achieved through chemical treatment, opening a pathway for oxygen doping in transition metal dichalcogenides. However, we also highlight the limitations of chemical treatment, which may only lead to small increases in photoluminescence yield beyond a certain point.

Title: Magnetic Phase Diagram of YbRh$_{2}$Si$_{2}$: the Influence of Hyperfine Interactions
Authors: Jan Knapp, Lev V. Levitin, Jan Nyeki, Brian Cowan, John Saunders, Manuel Brando, Christoph Geibel, Kristin Kliemt, Cornelius Krellner
Abstract: We report the determination of the magnetic phase diagram of the heavy fermion metal YbRh\textsubscript{2}Si\textsubscript{2} in magnetic fields up to 70\,mT applied perpendicular to the crystallographic c-axis. By a combination of heat capacity, magneto-caloric, and magneto-resistance measurements we map two antiferromagnetic phases: the electronic AFM1 below 70\,mK and electro-nuclear AFM2 below 1.5\,mK. The measurements extend into the microkelvin regime to explore the quantum phase transitions in this system. We demonstrate how the hyperfine interaction significantly modifies the phase diagram and the putative field-tuned quantum critical point. The determination of the rich magnetic properties of YbRh\textsubscript{2}Si\textsubscript{2} is essential to understanding the interplay of the two magnetic orders and superconductivity in this compound.

Title: Anomalous Raman scattering in layered AgCrP$_2$Se$_6$: Helical modes and excitation energy-dependent intensities
Authors: Rahul Rao, Jie Jiang, Ruth Pachter, Thuc T. Mai, Valentine Mohaugen, Maria F. Muñoz, Ryan Siebenaller, Emmanuel Rowe, Ryan Selhorst, Andrea N. Giordano, Angela R. Hight Walker, Michael A. Susner
Abstract: Structural anisotropy in layered two-dimensional materials can lead to highly anisotropic optical absorption which, in turn, can profoundly a^ect their phonon modes. These e^ects include lattice orientation-dependent and excitation energy-dependent mode intensities that can enable new phononic and optoelectronic applications. Here, we report anomalous Raman spectra in single-crystalline AgCrP$_2$Se$_6$, a layered antiferromagnetic material. Density functional theory calculations and experimental measurements reveal several unique features in the Raman spectra of bulk and exfoliated AgCrP$_2$Se$_6$ crystals including three helical vibrational modes. These modes exhibit large Raman optical activities (circular intensity di^erences) in bulk AgCrP$_2$Se$_6$, which progressively decrease with thickness. We also observe strong excitation energy dependent peak intensities as well as a decrease in anti-Stokes peak intensities at room temperature with increasing excitation energy, resulting in an apparent cooling by up to 220 K. All of these anomalies in bulk and exfoliated flakes are attributed to the unique ABC layer stacking structure of AgCrP$_2$Se$_6$ and to the smaller unit cell volume that causes hybridization between the Se and Ag/Cr electron densities, resulting in charge transfer and strongly a^ecting the electron-phonon coupling. This work thus positions AgCrP$_2$Se$_6$ as an exciting new 2D material for optical and phononic applications.

Title: Microscopic Observation of Non-Ergodic States in Two-Dimensional Non-Topological Bubble Lattices

Abstract: Disordered 2D lattices, including hexatic and various glassy states, are observed in a wide range of 2D systems including colloidal nanoparticle assemblies and fluxon lattices. Their disordered nature determines the stability and mobility of these systems, as well as their response to the external stimuli. Here we report on the controlled creation and characterization of a disordered 2D lattice of non-topological magnetic bubbles in the non-centrosymmetric ferrimagnetic alloy Mn$_{1.4}$PtSn. By analyzing the type and frequency of fundamental lattice defects, such as dislocations, the orientational correlation, as well as the induced motion of the lattice in an external field, a non-ergodic glassy state, stabilized by directional application of an external field, is revealed.

Title: Field-induced upward bending of a magnetoelastomer cantilever residing on a horizontal plane: an unconventional cilium
Authors: O. V. Stolbov, G. V. Stepanov, Yu. L. Raikher
Abstract: The mechanical response of a cantilever made of a magnetoactive elastomer (MAE) that is positioned on a solid plane surface and is subjected to a uniform magnetic field is studied. The MAE is of the magnetically soft type, i.e., its filler particles become magnetized only in the presence of external field. Test observations with the applied field normal to the plane reveal two possible perturbed configurations of the cantilever: either its free end just bends upward or the cantilever folds into an arc, so that its free end does not detach from the supporting plane. The tests evidence that under cyclic variation of the field both deformation modes exhibit quite a wide bistability region, i.e., a magnetomechanical hysteresis takes place. Theoretical analysis shows that the cantilever bending scenario is indeed similar to that of the first-order transition. However, unlike the customary case, hereby the initial state never ceases to exist and remains stable against infinitesimal perturbations under arbitrary strong fields. Although this conclusion is valid only for an ideal situation, its nontrivial consequence is that the field value under which the transition to the bent state occurs is, in fact, unpredictable. The discovered effect is essentially different from the previously investigated behaviour of MAE cantilevers under an in-plane field; there the transition is of the second-order kind and is completely reversible. Finally, if to consider a horizontal MAE cantilever as an element of an assembly of magnetic cilia, it turns out that it behaves in the way opposite to that of conventional systems where in the initial state the MAE cilia stand normally to the supporting surface.

Title: Intermittent molecular motion and first passage statistics for the NMR relaxation of confined water
Authors: Simon Gravelle, Benoit Coasne, Christian Holm, Alexander Schlaich
Abstract: The structure and dynamics of fluids confined in nanoporous media differ from those in bulk, which can be probed using NMR relaxation measurements. We here show, using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of water in a slit nanopore, that the behavior of the NMR relaxation rate, R1, with varying surface interaction and confinement strength can be estimated from the exchange statistics of fluid molecules between the adsorbed surface layer and the bulk region, where molecules undergo intermittent dynamics. We employ first return passage time calculations to quantify the molecular exchange statistics, thereby linking microscopic parameters of the confined fluid-such as adsorption time, pore size, and diffusion coefficient-to the NMR relaxation rate. This approach allows to predict and interpret the molecular relaxation of fluids at interfaces using merely concepts of statistical mechanics and can be generalized to closed and open geometries.

Title: Effect of bismuth crystal orientations in Nernst thermomagnetic devices
Authors: Alessandro Sola, Elena Sonia Olivetti, Adriano Di Pietro, Luca Martino, Vittorio Basso
Abstract: In this work we report Nernst effect measurements in single crystal bismuth samples, with special emphasis on the characterization of the Nernst coefficient when the magnetic field, heat current and generated voltage are aligned along specific directions relative to the crystal axes. We found significant differences between the different orientations, reflecting the highly anisotropic electronic structure of bismuth and compatible with the Nernst characteristics obtained from polycrystalline samples. These results not only complement the experimental works published in the past but also underline the role of crystalline orientation in the context of transverse thermoelectric effects, towards an efficient design of thermomagnetic devices like the ordinary-Nernst-effect-based energy harvesters.

Title: Universal transport at Lifshitz metal-insulator transitions in two dimensions
Authors: Harry Tomlins, Jan M. Tomczak
Abstract: We study the charge transport across a band-tuned metal-insulator transition in two dimensions. For high temperatures $T$ and chemical potentials $\mu$ far from the transition point, conduction is ballistic and the resistance $R(T)$ verifies a simple one-parameter scaling relation. Here, we explore the limits of this semi-classical behaviour and study the quantum regime beyond, where scaling breaks down. We derive an analytical formula for the simplest Feynman diagram of the linear-response conductivity $\sigma=1/R$ of a parabolic band endowed with a finite lifetime. Our formula shows excellent agreement for experiments for a field-tuned MoTe$_2$/WSe$_2$ moiré bilayer, and can capture the quantum effects responsible for breaking the one-parameter scaling. We go on to discuss a fascinating prediction of our model: The resistance at the quantum-critical band-tuned Lifshitz point ($\mu=T=0$) has the universal value, $R_L=(2 \pi h)/e^2$, per degree of freedom and this value is found to be compatible with experiment. Furthermore, we investigate whether two dimensional metal-insulator transitions driven by strong electron correlations or disorder can also be classified by their quantum-critical resistance and find that $R_L$ may be useful in identifying predominantly interaction driven transitions.

Title: Keldysh field theory approach to direct electric and thermoelectric currents in quantum dots coupled to superconducting leads
Authors: Marco Uguccioni, Luca Dell'Anna
Abstract: We study the transport properties of a quantum dot contacted to two superconducting reservoirs by means of the Keldysh field theory approach. We determine the direct current occurring at equilibrium and the electric and thermoelectric currents triggered when the system is driven out of equilibrium by a voltage or a temperature bias, also for a normal-quantum dot-superconductor junction. In particular, we derive and present for the first time the explicit expression of the thermoelectric current in a superconductor-quantum dot-superconductor junction for any values of the temperature difference between the superconducting leads. We show that in the linear response regime, in addition to the Josephson current, a weakly phase-dependent thermoelectric contribution occurs, providing that electron-hole symmetry is broken. Far from linearity, instead, other contributions arise which lead to thermoelectric effects, dominant at weak coupling, also in the presence of particle-hole symmetry.

Title: Flexoelectricity causes surface piezoelectric-like effects in dielectrics
Authors: H. Mohammadi, F. Greco, D. Codony, I. Arias
Abstract: In this paper we study the surface effects that bulk flexoelectric models in finite samples exhibit. We first show that when the body is infinite, flexoelectric materials do not exhibit electromechanical response under homogeneous loading. However, when the size of the body is finite, due to the symmetry-breaking nature of surfaces, homogeneous loading (mechanical or electrical) can cause an electromechanical response near the surfaces. We obtain closed-form solutions for finite samples under different electromechanical loading conditions, and show that the electromechanical response caused by the bulk flexoelectric effect is reminiscent of surface piezoelectricity, causing boundary layers in certain components of the strains and/or electric fields near the free surfaces.

Title: Supercurrent Diode Effect in Josephson Interferometers with Multiband Superconductors
Authors: Yuriy Yerin, Stefan-Ludwig Drechsler, A. A. Varlamov, Francesco Giazotto, Mario Cuoco
Abstract: We investigate nonreciprocal supercurrent phenomena in superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) that integrate Josephson junctions with single and multiband order parameters, which may exhibit time-reversal symmetry breaking. Our results show that the magnetic field can independently control both the amplitude and direction of supercurrent rectification, depending on the multiband characteristics of the superconductors involved. We analyze the effects of zero and antiphase ({\pi}) pairing among different bands on the development of nonreciprocal effects and find that the rectification is not influenced by {\pi}-pairing. Furthermore, we demonstrate that incorporating multiband superconductors that break time-reversal symmetry produces significant signatures in rectification. The rectification exhibits an even parity dependence on the magnetic field and the average rectification amplitude across quantum flux multiples does not equal zero. These findings indicate that magnetic flux pumping can be accomplished with time-reversal symmetry broken multiband superconductors by adjusting the magnetic field. Overall, our findings provide valuable insights for identifying and utilizing phases with broken time-reversal symmetry in multiband superconductors.

Title: Bounding multifractality by observables
Authors: Tuomas I. Vanhala, Niklas Järvelin, Teemu Ojanen
Abstract: Fractal dimensions have been used as a quantitative measure for structure of eigenstates of quantum many-body systems, useful for comparison to random matrix theory predictions or to distinguish many-body localized systems from chaotic ones. For chaotic systems at midspectrum the states are expected to be ``ergodic'', infinite temperature states with all fractal dimensions approaching 1 in the thermodynamic limit. However, when moving away from midspectrum, the states develop structure, as they are expected to follow the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, with few-body observables predicted by a finite-temperature ensemble. We discuss how this structure of the observables can be used to bound the fractal dimensions from above, thus explaining their typical arc-shape over the energy spectrum. We then consider how such upper bounds act as a proxy for the fractal dimension over the many-body localization transition, thus formally connecting the single-particle and Fock space pictures discussed in the literature.

Title: Topological Signatures of the Optical Bound on Maximal Berry Curvature: Applications to Two-Dimensional Time-Reversal-Symmetric Insulators
Authors: Pok Man Chiu
Abstract: Unlike broken time-reversal symmetric (TRS) systems with a defined Chern number, directly measuring the bulk $Z_{2}$ invariant and Berry curvature (if nonzero) in topological insulators and their higher-order topological families remains an unsolved problem. Here, based on the refined trace-determinant inequality (TDI) involving the trace and determinant of the quantum metric and maximal Berry curvature (MBC), we establish an optical bound on the MBC for two-dimensional TRS insulators. By utilizing (certain energy range of) experimental data on optical conductivity, one can identify topological signatures using the integrated optical bound. We illustrate our approach using three representative topological models: the Kane-Mele model, mirror-protected insulator, and quadrupole insulator. We find that the resulting momentum integration of the refined TDI provides an intrinsic relationship between quantum volume (QV) variations and topological phase transitions. We argue that double QV can be treated as an upper bound on the number of boundary states. Our findings offer a method for extracting the topological signatures of TRS insulators using optical conductivity data.

Title: Topological insulator constrictions -- Dirac particles in a magneto-chiral box
Authors: Michael Barth, Maximilian Fürst, Raphael Kozlovsky, Klaus Richter, Cosimo Gorini
Abstract: We study magneto-transport through topological insulator nanowires shaped in the form of a constriction, as can be obtained by etching techniques. The magnetic field is coaxial, potentially turning the nanowire into a magneto-chiral junction. We show in a detailed analytical and numerical study that two main transport regimes emerge, depending on the central narrow region being short or long as compared to the magnetic length at the junction entrance and exit. In both cases the central region hosts Dirac-particle-in-a-box states due to magnetic confinement, whose conductance properties are strongly influenced by Landau levels at the ends of the constriction. Notably, in the low-energy regime only chiral states with a specific handedness can transport charge across the junction. Based on these properties and general symmetry considerations we argue that the shaped nanowire should exhibit strong magneto-chiral non-reciprocal transport beyond linear response. We employ a numerical tight-binding implementation of an effective 2D model on a non-homogeneous grid, capable of simulating samples of realistic sizes, and test its soundness against full simulations for scaled-down 3D topological insulator wires.

Title: Bulk superconductivity in pressurized trilayer nickelate Pr4Ni3O10 single crystals
Authors: Enkang Zhang, Di Peng, Yinghao Zhu, Lixing Chen, Bingkun Cui, Xingya Wang, Wenbin Wang, Qiaoshi Zeng, Jun Zhao
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in pressurized bilayer and trilayer nickelates have generated significant interest. However, their superconducting properties are often dependent on sample quality and pressure conditions, complicating the interpretation of the underlying physics. Finding new systems with optimized bulk superconducting properties is therefore important for advancing our understanding of these materials. Unlike cupates, where trilayer compounds typically exhibit the highest transition temperature (Tc), the bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7 has thus far outperformed the trilayer La4Ni3O10 in reported Tc. Whether the trilayer nickelates have achieved the optimal Tc remains unclear, with various scenarios suggesting different possibilities. Here, we report the discovery of bulk superconductivity in pressurized Pr4Ni3O10 single crystals, achieving a maximum onset Tc of 40.5 K at 80.1 GPa, significantly exceeding the 30 K observed in La4Ni3O10. The bulk nature of superconductivity is confirmed by zero resistance and a strong diamagnetic response bellow Tc with a superconducting volume fraction exceeding 80%. These findings establish trilayer nickelates as genuine bulk high-temperature superconductors, provide new insights into the mechanisms driving superconductivity, and point to a promising route toward further enhancing superconducting properties in nickelates.

Title: Single crystal growth and physical characterization to fine tune YbIn1-xTxCu4 (T = Au, Ag) towards the critical endpoint of the valence transition
Authors: Michelle Ocker, Bereket Ghebretinsae, Jan-Niklas Zimmermann, Sophie Würtele, Bernd Wolf, Alexandr Virovets, Michael Lang, Kristin Kliemt, Cornelius Krellner
Abstract: Pure as well as Ag- and Au-substituted YbInCu$_4$ single crystals were structurally and chemically characterized and investigated by means of heat capacity, magnetization, resistivity and ultrasonic measurements. We studied the influence of different compositions of the initial melt as well as of Au and Ag substitutions on the valence change and investigated whether this change occurs via a first-order phase transition or via crossover. We constructed a phase diagram of YbInCu$_4$ as a function of various substitutions and show that the position of the critical endpoint of the valence transition depends on the substituent and on the conditions under which the samples were grown. Multiple thermal cycles through the first-order transition lead to a significant modification of the physical properties which clearly demonstrated the influence of defects in substituted YbInCu$_4$.

Title: Equilibrium and nonequilibrium behaviours of the Ising ferromagnetic thick cubic shell
Authors: Ishita Tikader, Muktish Acharyya
Abstract: We have studied the equilibrium and nonequilibrium behaviours of the Ising ferromagnetic thick cubic shell by Monte Carlo simulation. Our goal is to find the dependence of the responses on the thickness of the shell. In the equilibrium results, we found that the pseudo-critical temperature of ferro-para phase transition of thick cubic shell increases with the increase of the thickness following a hyperbolic tangent relation. In the nonequilibrium studies, the relaxation time has been found to decrease with the increase of the thickness of the cubic shell. Here three different regimes are found, namely rapid fall, plateau and linear region. The metastable behaviour has been studied also as another kind of non-equilibrium response. The metastable lifetime has been studied as function of the thickness of the cubic shell. A non-monotonic variation of metastable lifetime with the thickness of the shell is observed. A specified thickness for longest-lived metastability has been identified.

Title: Dynamic Competition between Cooper-Pair and Spin-Density-Wave Condensation

Abstract: Quantum matter phases may co-exist microscopically even when they display competing tendencies. A fundamental question is whether such a competition can be avoided through the elimination of one phase while the other one condenses into the ground state. Here, we present a high-resolution neutron spectroscopy study of the low-energy spin excitations in the high-temperature superconductor La1.855Sr0.145CuO4. In the normal state, we find low-energy magnetic fluctuations at incommensurate reciprocal lattice positions where spin-density-wave order emerges at lower Sr concentration or at high magnetic fields. While these spin excitations are largely suppressed by the emergence of the superconducting spin gap, some low-energy magnetic fluctuations persist deep inside the superconducting state. We interpret this result in terms of a dynamic competition between superconductivity and magnetism, where superconductivity impedes the condensation of low-energy magnetic fluctuations through the formation of magnetically-mediated Cooper pairs.

Title: Cell Deformation Signatures along the Apical-Basal Axis: A 3D Continuum Mechanics Shell Model
Authors: Jairo M. Rojas, Mayisha Z. Nakib, Vivian W. Tang, William M. Brieher, Sascha Hilgenfeldt
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) mechanical models of confluent tissues have related the mechanical state of a monolayer of cells to the average perimeter length of the cell cross sections, predicting floppiness or rigidity of the material. For the well-studied system of in-vitro MDCK epithelial cells, however, we find experimentally that cells in mechanically rigid tissues display long perimeters characteristic of a floppy state in 2D models. We suggest that this discrepancy is due to mechanical effects in the third (apical-basal) dimension, including those caused by actin stress fibers near the basal membrane. To quantitatively understand cell deformations in 3D, we develop a continuum mechanics model of epithelial cells as elastic cylindrical shells, with appropriate boundary conditions reflecting both the passive confinement of neighboring cells and the active stress of actomyosin contractility. This formalism yields analytical solutions predicting cell cross sections along the entire cylinder axis. Deconvolution microscopy experimental data confirm the significant and systematic change in cell shape parameters in this apical-basal direction. In addition to providing a wealth of detailed information on deformation on the subcellular scale, the results of the approach alter our understanding of how active tissues balance requirements of their stiffness and integrity, suggesting they are more robust against loss of rigidity than previously inferred.

Title: A machine-learning study of phase transitions in Ising, Blume-Capel, and Ising-metamagnet models
Authors: Vasanth Kumar Babu, Rahul Pandit
Abstract: We combine machine-learning (ML) techniques with Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and finite-size scaling (FSS) to study continuous and first-order phase transitions in Ising, Blume-Capel, and Ising-metamagnet spin models. We go beyond earlier studies that had concentrated on obtaining the correlation-length exponent $\nu$. In particular, we show (a) how to combine neural networks (NNs), trained with data from MC simulations of Ising-type spin models on finite lattices, with FSS to obtain both thermal magnetic exponents $y_t = 1/\nu$ and $y_h$, respectively, at both critical and tricritical points, (b) how to obtain the NN counterpart of two-scale-factor universality at an Ising-type critical point, and (c) FSS at a first-order transition. We also obtain the FSS forms for the output of our trained NNs as functions of both the temperature and the magnetic field.

Title: Quantum oscillations in a dipolar excitonic insulator
Authors: Phuong X. Nguyen, Raghav Chaturvedi, Bo Zou, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Allan H. MacDonald, Kin Fai Mak, Jie Shan
Abstract: Quantum oscillations in magnetization or resistivity are a defining feature of metals subject to an external magnetic field. The phenomenon is generally not expected in insulators without a Fermi surface. The observations of quantum oscillations in Kondo insulating materials have provided a rare counterexample and attracted much theoretical interest. However, the magnetic oscillations in correlated insulators remain poorly understood. Here we report the observations of resistivity quantum oscillations in an excitonic insulator realized in Coulomb-coupled electron-hole double layers with gate-tunability that allows the phenomenon to be explored in a more controllable fashion than in bulk materials. When the cyclotron energy of the electrons or holes is tuned to be comparable to or larger than the exciton binding energy, recurring transitions between excitonic insulators and electron-hole decoupled quantum Hall states are observed. Compressibility measurements show an oscillatory exciton binding energy as a function of magnetic field and electron-hole pair density. Coulomb drag measurements further reveal the formation of excitons with finite angular momentum. Our results are qualitatively captured by mean-field theory calculations. The study demonstrates a new platform for studying quantum oscillations in correlated insulators.

Title: Thermal properties revisited in displacive ferroelectrics
Authors: G.D. Zhao, F. Yang, L.Q. Chen
Abstract: The collective amplitude mode of the order parameter in displacive ferroelectrics, termed the ferron, represents the amplitude fluctuations of long-range ordered polarization. At temperatures well below phase transition temperature $T_c$, the energy of ferron excitation is significantly gapped in the long-wavelength limit. As $T_c$ is approached, this gap softens dramatically to minimal or gapless values, thereby should lead to a substantial contribution to thermal properties. In this context, we explore the role of ferrons in heat capacity and thermal transport by incorporating a microscopic self-consistent phase-transition theory for displacive ferroelectricity in contrast to the conventional treatment of attributing thermal properties solely to acoustic phonons. Using ferroelectric $\rm{PbTiO}_{3}$ as a case study, we show that the softening of ferrons near the phase transition is essential to accurately capturing the experimental temperature and electric-field dependencies of thermal properties.

Title: Unveiling Symmetry Instability induced by Topological Phase Transitions
Authors: Liang Luo, Boqun Song, Genda Gu, Martin Mootz, Yongxin Yao, Ilias E. Perakis, Qiang Li, Jigang Wang
Abstract: The symmetry-topology interplay dictates how to define order parameters and classify material ordered phases. However, current understanding of this interplay has been predominately approached from a one-sided perspective, with topological states being classified within the constraints imposed by specific fixed symmetries. Here we complete this full circle by demonstrating spontaneous symmetry breaking that results from a periodic alteration of topological phases induced by light in a centrosymmetric Dirac material ZrTe$_5$. The distinguishing feature is the observation of robust correlation and striking anomalies in the fluence and temperature dependence of key transport this http URL, both shift current $J_{\text{s}}$ and displacement current $J_{\text{d}}$, arising from interband transition and infrared phonon driving, respectively, along with charge carrier pumping, exhibit similar behaviors. Second, they all peak at similar low pump fluence, followed by a subsequent reduction as the fluence further increases. This behavior cannot be explained by conventional energetically allowed, direct excitations. Third, all the three observables exhibit anomalies when they approach the topological phase transition temperature. These results highlight the unique low-energy pumping behaviors in ZrTe$_5$, characterized by reversible fluence dependence and a 'hinge-like' interaction that connects various electronic and lattice observables, including phonons, charge carriers, and currents. Our findings, supported by model analysis, provide key insights into the fragility of crystalline (inversion) and time-reversal symmetries during the dynamics of topological phase transitions. This fragility drives spontaneous symmetry breaking, evidenced by the synchronized emergence of off-resonant infrared phonons and broken-symmetry photocurrents.

Title: Self-organised dynamics and emergent shape spaces of active isotropic fluid surfaces
Authors: Da Gao, Huayang Sun, Rui Ma, Alexander Mietke
Abstract: Theories of self-organised active fluid surfaces have emerged as an important class of minimal models for the shape dynamics of biological membranes, cells and tissues. Here, we develop and apply a variational approach for active fluid surfaces to systematically study the nonlinear dynamics and emergent shape spaces such theories give rise to. To represent dynamic surfaces, we design an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian parameterizations for deforming surfaces. Exploiting the symmetries imposed by Onsager relations, we construct a variational formulation that is based on the entropy production in active surfaces. The resulting dissipation functional is complemented by Lagrange multipliers to relax nonlinear geometric constraints, which allows for a direct computation of steady state solutions of surface shapes and flows. We apply this framework to study the dynamics of open fluid membranes and closed active fluid surfaces, and characterize the space of stationary solutions that corresponding surfaces and flows occupy. Our analysis rationalizes the interplay of first-order shape transitions of internally and externally forced fluid membranes, reveals degenerate regions in stationary shape spaces of mechanochemically active surfaces and identifies a mechanism by which hydrodynamic screening controls the geometry of active surfaces undergoing cell division-like shape transformations.

Title: Study of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein by Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy and Transmission Electron Microscopy
Authors: Monika Ghalawat, Virendra Kumar Meena, Sharda Prasad, Pankaj Poddar, Atanu Basu (ICMR-National Institute of Virology, CSIR-National Chemical Laboratory)
Abstract: The spike protein (SP) of SARS-CoV-2 is the major molecular target for making diagnostic tests, vaccines, and therapeutic development. We used a combination of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and surface enhanced Raman microscopy (SERS) to study its structure. Using SERS on an aluminum substrate, we were able to detect a characteristic spectrum of SP mostly due to vibration of three aromatic amino acids producing Raman shifts at 466 cm-1, 524 cm-1, 773 cm-1, 831 cm-1, 1048 cm-1, 1308 cm-1, 1457 cm-1, and 1610 cm-1. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) of the SP showed periodic 2D-lattice orientation. The findings from this study have translational values for developing surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) based detectors for screening and testing SARS-CoV-2 signatures in diagnostic settings and contamination tracking.

Title: Euclidean gravity is hot
Authors: Mustafa Saeed, Diya Batool, Muhammad Muzammil, Nomaan X
Abstract: We study the behavior of Ising spins on Euclidean spacetime backgrounds to determine which properties of the background - curvature, the presence of a horizon, or temperature - play a role in phase transitions. We construct Ising-like models on Euclidean Schwarzschild, Rindler, extremal Reissner-Nördstrom (ERN), Anti deSitter (AdS), and deSitter (dS) backgrounds. Among these, Rindler is flat, AdS does not have a horizon, and both AdS and ERN have zero temperatures. We find second-order phase transitions as the metric parameter is varied in all cases except for Rindler. Specifically, we find that the transition from order to disorder occurs as the curvature - or Euclidean gravity - increases. This supports our conjecture that Euclidean gravity is an essential ingredient for these phase transitions, as opposed to the presence of a horizon or temperature.

Title: Multiplexed color centers in a silicon photonic cavity array
Authors: Lukasz Komza, Xueyue Zhang, Hanbin Song, Yu-Lung Tang, Xin Wei, Alp Sipahigil
Abstract: Entanglement distribution is central to the modular scaling of quantum processors and establishing quantum networks. Color centers with telecom-band transitions and long spin coherence times are suitable candidates for long-distance entanglement distribution. However, high-bandwidth memory-enhanced quantum communication is limited by high-yield, scalable creation of efficient spin-photon interfaces. Here, we develop a silicon photonics platform consisting of arrays of bus-coupled cavities. The coupling to a common bus waveguide enables simultaneous access to individually addressable cavity-enhanced T center arrays. We demonstrate frequency-multiplexed operation of two T centers in separate photonic crystal cavities. In addition, we investigate the cavity enhancement of a T center through hybridized modes formed between physically distant cavities. Our results show that bus-coupled arrays of cavity-enhanced color centers could enable efficient on-chip and long-distance entanglement distribution.

Authors: Haotian Su, Yuan-Mau Lee, Tara Peña, Sydney Fultz-Waters, Jimin Kang, Çağıl Köroğlu, Sumaiya Wahid, Christina J. Newcomb, Young Suh Song, H.-S. Philip Wong, Shan X. Wang, Eric Pop
Abstract: Amorphous oxide semiconductors are gaining interest for logic and memory transistors compatible with low-temperature fabrication. However, their low thermal conductivity and heterogeneous interfaces suggest that their performance may be severely limited by self-heating, especially at higher power and device densities. Here, we investigate the high-field breakdown of amorphous indium tin oxide (ITO) transistors with scanning thermal microscopy (SThM) and multiphysics simulations. The ITO devices break irreversibly at channel temperatures of ~180 °C and ~340 °C on SiO${_2}$ and HfO${_2}$ substrates, respectively, but failure appears primarily caused by thermally-induced compressive strain near the device contacts. Combining SThM measurements with simulations allows us to estimate a thermal boundary conductance (TBC) of 35 ${\pm}$ 12 MWm${^-}$${^2}$K${^-}$${^1}$ for ITO on SiO${_2}$, and 51 ${\pm}$ 14 MWm${^-}$${^2}$K${^-}$${^1}$ for ITO on HfO${_2}$. The latter also enables significantly higher breakdown power due to better heat dissipation and closer thermal expansion matching. These findings provide valuable insights into the thermo-mechanical limitations of ITO devices, paving the way for more reliable and high-performance amorphous oxide transistors.

Title: System-environmental entanglement in critical spin systems under $ZZ$-decoherence and its relation to strong and weak symmetries
Authors: Yoshihito Kuno, Takahiro Orito, Ikuo Ichinose
Abstract: Open quantum many-body system exhibits nontrivial behavior under decoherence. In particular, system-environmental entanglement is one of quantities to characterize mixed state properties under decoherence. In this study, we investigate the behavior of the system-environmental entanglement for critical spin chains under nearest-neighbor $ZZ$ -decoherence. We numerically find that the system-environmental entanglement exhibits a specific scaling law including a system-independent universal term ("$g$-function"). For the critical XXZ model, transition to strong-to-weak spontaneously symmetry breaking mixed state takes place. In that case, the $g$-function changes its value at decoherent transition point and gets double the value of system under single-site $Z$-decoherence, which was recently studied by conformal field theory. By studying Shannon entropy, we clarify origin of this $g$-function behavior.

Title: Entanglement-informed Construction of Variational Quantum Circuits
Authors: Alina Joch, Götz S. Uhrig, Benedikt Fauseweh
Abstract: The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is a promising tool for simulating ground states of quantum many-body systems on noisy quantum computers. Its effectiveness relies heavily on the ansatz, which must be both hardware-efficient for implementation on noisy hardware and problem-specific to avoid local minima and convergence problems. In this article, we explore entanglement-informed ansatz schemes that naturally emerge from specific models, aiming to balance accuracy with minimal use of two-qubit entangling gates, allowing for efficient use of techniques such as quantum circuit cutting. We focus on three models of quasi-1D Hamiltonians: (i) systems with impurities acting as entanglement barriers, (ii) systems with competing long-range and short-range interactions transitioning from a long-range singlet to a quantum critical state, and (iii) random quantum critical systems. For the first model, we observe a plateau in the ansatz accuracy, controlled by the number of entangling gates between subsystems. This behavior is explained by iterative capture of eigenvalues in the entanglement spectrum. In the second model, combining long-range and short-range entanglement schemes yields the best overall accuracy, leading to global convergence in the entanglement spectrum. For the third model, we use an renormalization group approach to build the short- and long-range entanglement structure of the ansatz. Our comprehensive analysis provides a new perspective on the design of ansätze based on the expected entanglement structure of the approximated state.

Title: Measurement induced phase transition in a quantum Ising model by periodic measurements
Authors: Paranjoy Chaki, Protyush Nandi, Ujjwal Sen, Subinay Dasgupta
Abstract: Measurement-induced phase transitions are often studied in random quantum circuits, with local measurements performed with a certain probability. We present here a model where a global measurement is performed with certainty at every time-step of the measurement protocol. Each time step, therefore, consists of evolution under the transverse Ising Hamiltonian for a time $\tau$, followed by a measurement that provides a ``yes/no'' answer to the question, ``Are all spins up?''. The survival probability after $n$ time-steps is defined as the probability that the answer is ``no'' in all the $n$ time-steps. For various $\tau$ values, we compute the survival probability, entanglement in bipartition, and the generalized geometric measure, a genuine multiparty entanglement, for a chain of size $L \sim 26$, and identify a transition at $\tau_c \sim 0.2$ for field strength $h=1/2$. We then analytically derive a recursion relation that enables us to calculate the survival probability for system sizes up to 1000, which provides evidence of a scaling $\tau_c \sim 1/\sqrt{L}$. The transition at finite \(\tau_c\) for \(L \sim 28\) seems therefore to recede to \(\tau_c = 0\) in the thermodynamic limit. Additionally, at large time-steps, survival probability decays logarithmically only when the ground state of the Hamiltonian is paramagnetic. Such decay is not present when the ground state is ferromagnetic.

Title: Periodic Boundary Conditions for Bosonic Path Integral Molecular Dynamics
Authors: Jacob Higer, Yotam M. Y. Feldman, Barak Hirshberg
Abstract: We develop an algorithm for bosonic path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) simulations with periodic boundary conditions (PBC) that scales quadratically with the number of particles. Path integral methods are a powerful tool to simulate bosonic condensed phases, which exhibit fundamental physical phenomena such as Bose--Einstein condensation and superfluidity. Recently, we developed a quadratic scaling algorithm for bosonic PIMD, but employed an ad hoc treatment of PBC. Here we rigorously enforce PBC in bosonic PIMD. It requires summing over the spring energies of all periodic images in the partition function, and a naive implementation scales exponentially with the system size. We present an algorithm for bosonic PIMD simulations of periodic systems that scales only quadratically. We benchmark our implementation on the free Bose gas and a model system of cold atoms in optical lattices. We also study an approximate treatment of PBC based on the minimum-image convention, and derive a numerical criterion to determine when it is valid.

Title: Mie-resonant silicon waveguide for efficient coupling with excitonic emitters in InSe
Authors: Timofey V. Antipov, Alexandra D. Gartman, Dmitry N. Gulkin, Lyubov Kotova, Aidar Galimov, Bogdan Borodin, Ilya Eliseyev, Alexander S. Shorokhov, Maxim Rakhlin, Andrey A. Fedyanin
Abstract: Enhancement of radiative coupling efficiency between out-of-plane excitonic emitters in an indium selenide (InSe) film and an integrated waveguide formed by silicon (Si) Mie-resonant nanodisks is experimentally studied. Photoluminescence power at the resonant waveguide output is increased by~2.5 times at 950~nm in comparison with the case of a conventional rib waveguide of the same geometrical parameters due to the efficient excitation of Mie-type magnetic dipole resonances in individual nanoparticles. These results show inspiring possibilities for creating new on-chip light emitters for various integrated photonics applications.

Title: Thermal Radiation Force and Torque on Moving Nanostructures with Anisotropic Optical Response
Authors: Juan R. Deop-Ruano, Alejandro Manjavacas
Abstract: Nanoscale objects moving relative to a thermal radiation bath experience a drag force due to the imbalance in their interaction with the blue- and redshifted components of the electromagnetic field. Here, we show that, in addition to this drag force, moving nanostructures with an anisotropic optical response experience a lateral force and a torque that substantially modify their trajectory. These phenomena emerge from the additional coupling between the electromagnetic field components polarized parallel and perpendicular to the trajectory, enabled by the anisotropic response of the nanostructure. This work unveils the intricate dynamics of anisotropic nanostructures moving in a thermal radiation bath.

Title: Recyclable Thin-Film Soft Electronics for Smart Packaging and E-Skins
Authors: Manuel Reis Carneiro, Anibal T. de Almeida, Mahmoud Tavakoli, Carmel Majidi
Abstract: Despite advances in soft, sticker_like electronics, few efforts have dealt with the challenge of electronic waste. Here, this is addressed by introducing an eco friendly conductive ink for thin_film circuitry composed of silver flakes and a water_based polyurethane dispersion. This ink uniquely combines high electrical conductivity (1.6 x 105 S m_1), high resolution digital printability, robust adhesion for microchip integration, mechanical resilience, and recyclability. Recycling is achieved with an ecologically friendly processing method to decompose the circuits into constituent elements and recover the conductive ink with a decrease of only 2.4 per cent in conductivity. Moreover, adding liquid metal enables stretchability of up to 200 per cent strain, although this introduces the need for more complex recycling steps. Finally, on_skin electrophysiological monitoring biostickers along with a recyclable smart package with integrated sensors for monitoring safe storage of perishable foods are demonstrated.

Title: A trilinear quantum dot architecture for semiconductor spin qubits
Authors: R. Li, V. Levajac, C. Godfrin, S. Kubicek, G. Simion, B. Raes, S. Beyne, I. Fattal, A. Loenders, W. De Roeck, M. Mongillo, D. Wan, K. De Greve
Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dot spin qubits hold significant potential for scaling to millions of qubits for practical quantum computing applications, as their structure highly resembles the structure of conventional transistors. Since classical semiconductor manufacturing technology has reached an unprecedented level of maturity, reliably mass-producing CMOS chips with hundreds of billions of components, conventional wisdom dictates that leveraging CMOS technologies for quantum dot qubits can result in upscaled quantum processors with thousands or even millions of interconnected qubits. However, the interconnect requirements for quantum circuits are very different from those for classical circuits, where for each qubit individual control and readout wiring could be needed. Although significant developments have been demonstrated on small scale systems, qubit numbers remain limited, to a large extent due to the lack of scalable qubit interconnect schemes. Here, we present a trilinear quantum dot array that is simple in physical layout while allowing individual wiring to each quantum dot. By means of electron shuttling, the trilinear architecture provides qubit connectivity that is equivalent to or even surpasses that of 2D square lattice. Assuming the current qubit fidelities of small-scale devices can be extrapolated to large-scale arrays, medium-length shuttling arrays on the order of tens of microns would allow million-scale qubit systems, while maintaining manageable overheads. We also present a scalable control scheme, where the qubit chip is 3D-integrated with a low-power switch-based cryoCMOS circuit for parallel qubit operation with limited control inputs. As our trilinear quantum dot array is fully compatible with existing semiconductor technologies, this qubit architecture represents one possible framework for future research and development of large-scale spin qubit systems.

Title: Holographic Fluctuation-Dissipation Relations in Finite Density Systems
Authors: Shivam K. Sharma
Abstract: Using real-time holography, we investigate fluctuation-dissipation relations in holographic systems at finite density. In the bulk, it corresponds to the study of scattering of charged scalar field against a charged black hole background and derives an exterior field theory outside the AdS Reissner-Nordström black hole. This theory captures dissipation (from infalling Quasi-normal modes) and fluctuations (from Hawking radiation). Here, we also develop a Witten diagrammatic framework for computing $n$-point functions for interacting charged scalars. From the boundary perspective, it gives real-time correlations of the dual CFT held at finite temperature and finite chemical potential. Our results yield (non)-linear holographic fluctuation-dissipation relations at finite density, which are shown to recover the correct behaviour in the zero-density limit.

Title: Anti-scarring from eigenstate stacking in a chaotic spinor condensate
Authors: Zhongling Lu, Anton M. Graf, Eric J. Heller, Joonas Keski-Rahkonen, Ceren B. Dag
Abstract: The early-time dynamics of many-body quantum chaotic systems is typically considered non-universal due to the divergence from the predictions of random matrix theory. The eigenstate stacking theorem, on the other hand, asserts uniformity in a phase space for the cumulative probability density of eigenstates that fall within a sufficiently large energy window, opening a route to universality in early times. This fact must hold even in many-body systems. Here, we study a chaotic spinor Bose-Einstein condensate, whose quantum scar dynamics has recently been observed in the laboratory. Quantum scars, living densely near an unstable periodic orbit, must be compensated by anti-scarred states populating sparsely there by the virtue of stacking theorem. We find that such anti-scarring is present in this many-particle system by extending the applicability of stacking theorem. Our work uncovers how the quantum scarring of some eigenstates affects the rest of the chaotic and thermal spectrum in quantum systems with many particles.

Title: A cryogenic memory element based on an anomalous Josephson junction
Authors: C. Guarcello, F.S. Bergeret
Abstract: We propose a non-volatile memory element based on a lateral ferromagnetic Josephson junction with spin-orbit coupling and out-of-plane magnetization. The interplay between the latter and the intrinsic exchange field of the ferromagnet leads to a magnetoelectric effect that couples the charge current through the junction and its magnetization, such that by applying a current pulse the direction of the magnetic moment in F can be switched. The two memory states are encoded in the direction of the out-of-plane magnetization. With the aim to determine the optimal working temperature for the memory element, we explore the noise-induced effects on the averaged stationary magnetization by taking into account thermal fluctuations affecting both the Josephson phase and the magnetic moment dynamics. We investigate the switching process as a function of intrinsic parameters of the ferromagnet, such as the Gilbert damping and strength of the spin-orbit coupling, and proposed a non-destructive readout scheme based on a dc-SQUID. Additionally, we analyze a way to protect the memory state from external perturbations by voltage gating in systems with a both linear-in-momentum Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling.

Title: Eigenvalues of random matrices with generalised correlations: a path integral approach
Authors: Joseph W. Baron, Thomas Jun Jewell, Christopher Ryder, Tobias Galla
Abstract: Random matrix theory allows one to deduce the eigenvalue spectrum of a large matrix given only statistical information about its elements. Such results provide insight into what factors contribute to the stability of complex dynamical systems. In this letter, we study the eigenvalue spectrum of an ensemble of random matrices with correlations between any pair of elements. To this end, we introduce an analytical method that maps the resolvent of the random matrix onto the response functions of a linear dynamical system. The response functions are then evaluated using a path integral formalism, enabling us to make deductions about the eigenvalue spectrum. Our central result is a simple, closed-form expression for the leading eigenvalue of a large random matrix with generalised correlations. This formula demonstrates that correlations between matrix elements that are not diagonally opposite, which are often neglected, can have a significant impact on stability.

Title: Breakdown of random-matrix universality in persistent Lotka-Volterra communities
Authors: Joseph W. Baron, Thomas Jun Jewell, Christopher Ryder, Tobias Galla
Abstract: The eigenvalue spectrum of a random matrix often only depends on the first and second moments of its elements, but not on the specific distribution from which they are drawn. The validity of this universality principle is often assumed without proof in applications. In this Letter, we offer a pertinent counterexample in the context of the generalized Lotka-Volterra equations. Using dynamic mean-field theory, we derive the statistics of the interactions between species in an evolved ecological community. We then show that the full statistics of these interactions, beyond those of a Gaussian ensemble, are required to correctly predict the eigenvalue spectrum and therefore stability. Consequently, the universality principle fails in this system. We thus show that the eigenvalue spectra of random matrices can be used to deduce the stability of ``feasible'' ecological communities, but only if the emergent non-Gaussian statistics of the interactions between species are taken into account.

Title: Dynamics of self-dual kagome metamaterials and the emergence of fragile topology
Authors: Pegah Azizi, Siddhartha Sarkar, Kai Sun, Stefano Gonella
Abstract: Recent years have seen the discovery of systems featuring fragile topological states. These states of matter lack certain protection attributes typically associated with topology and are therefore characterized by weaker signatures that make them elusive to observe. Moreover, they are typically confined to special symmetry classes and, in general, rarely studied in the context of phononic media. In this Letter, we theoretically predict the emergence of fragile topological bands in the spectrum of a twisted kagome elastic lattice with three-fold rotational symmetry, in the so-called self-dual configuration. A necessary requirement is that the lattice is a structural metamaterial, in which the role of the hinges is played by elastic finite-thickness ligaments. The interplay between the edge modes appearing in the bandgaps bounding the fragile topological states is also responsible for the emergence of corner modes at selected corners of a finite hexagonal domain, which qualifies the lattice as a second-order topological insulator. We demonstrate our findings through a series of experiments via 3D Scanning Laser Doppler Vibrometry conducted on a physical prototype. The selected configuration stands out for its remarkable geometric simplicity and ease of physical implementation in the panorama of dynamical systems exhibiting fragile topology.

Title: Simulating Bloch points using micromagnetic and Heisenberg models
Authors: Thomas Brian Winkler, Marijan Beg, Martin Lang, Mathias Kläui, Hans Fangohr
Abstract: Magnetic Bloch points (BPs) are highly confined magnetization configurations, that often occur in transient spin dynamics processes. However, opposing chiralities of adjacent layers for instance in a FeGe bilayer stack can stabilize such magnetic BPs at the layer interface. These BPs configurations are metastable and consist of two coupled vortices (one in each layer) with same circularity and opposite polarity. Each vortex is stabilized by opposite sign Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. This stabilization mechanism potentially opens the door towards BP-based spintronic applications. An open question, from a methodological point of view, is whether the Heisenberg (HB) model approach (atomistic model) as to be used to study such systems or if the -- computationally more efficient -- micromagnetic (MM) models can be used and still obtain robust results. We are modelling and comparing the energetics and dynamics of a stable BP obtained using both HB and MM approaches. We find that an MM description of a stable BP leads qualitatively to the same results as the HB description, and that an appropriate mesh discretization plays a more important role than the chosen model. Further, we study the dynamics by shifting the BP with an applied in-plane field and investigating the relaxation after switching the filed off abruptly. The precessional motion of coupled vortices in a BP state can be drastically reduced compared to a classical vortex, which may be also an interesting feature for fast and efficient devices. A recent study has shown that a bilayer stack hosting BPs can be used to retain information [1].

Title: Effects of Co substitution on the structural and magnetic properties of Sr(Ni$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_2$P$_2$
Authors: Juan Schmidt, Guilherme Gorgen-Lesseux, Raquel A. Ribeiro, Sergey L. Bud'ko, Paul C. Canfield
Abstract: Although SrNi$_2$P$_2$ adopts the common ThCr$_2$Si$_2$ structure for $T\geq 325$ K, being in an uncollapsed tetragonal state, on cooling below 325 K it adopts a one-third collapsed orthorhombic phase where one out of every three P rows bond across the Sr layers. On the other hand, SrCo$_2$P$_2$ only exhibits the uncollapsed ThCr$_2$Si$_2$ structure from room temperature down to 1.8 K. Neither SrNi$_2$P$_2$ nor SrCo$_2$P$_2$ manifests magnetic transitions down to 50 mK and 2 K, respectively. In this work we report the effects of Co substitution in Sr(Ni$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_2$P$_2$, which allows for tuning the transition between the one-third collapsed and the uncollapsed structure. We find a rapid decrease of the one-third collapsed structural transition temperature with increasing Co fraction, until reaching full suppression for $x \geq 0.1$. Substitution levels in the range $0.11\leq x\leq 0.58$ show no signs of any transition down to 1.8 K in the magnetization or resistance measurements in the range $1.8\ \text{K}\leq T\leq 300\ \text{K}$. However, different magnetically ordered states emerge for $x\geq 0.65$, and disappear for $x\geq 0.99$, recovering the known paramagnetic properties of the parent compound SrCo$_2$P$_2$. These results are summarized in a phase diagram, built upon the characterization done on single crystals with different Co fraction. Both the magnetic and structural properties are compared to other systems with ThCr$_2$Si$_2$ structure that exhibit magnetic ordering and collapsed tetragonal transitions. The magnetic ordering and moment formation are well described by Takahashi's spin fluctuation theory of itinerant electron magnetism.

Title: Detection of a coherent excitonic state in the layered semiconductor BiI$_{3}$
Authors: Valentina Gosetti, Jorge Cervantes-Villanueva, Davide Sangalli, Alejandro Molina-Sánchez, Vadim F. Agekyan, Claudio Giannetti, Luigi Sangaletti, Selene Mor, Stefania Pagliara
Abstract: The measurement and manipulation of the coherent dynamics of excitonic states constitute a forefront research challenge in semiconductor optics and in quantum coherence-based protocols for optoelectronic technologies. Layered semiconductors have emerged as an ideal platform for the study of exciton dynamics with accessible and technologically relevant energy and time scales. Here, we investigate the sub-picosecond exciton dynamics in a van-der-Waals semiconductor upon quasi-resonant excitation, and achieve to single out an incipient coherent excitonic state. Combining broadband transient reflectance spectroscopy and simulations based on many-body perturbation theory, we reveal a transient enhancement of the excitonic line intensity that originates from the photoinduced coherent polarization that is phase-locked with the interacting electromagnetic field. This finding allows us to define the spectral signature of a coherent excitonic state and to experimentally track the dynamical crossover from coherent to incoherent exciton, unlocking the prospective optical control of an exciton population on the intrinsic quantum-coherence timescale.

Title: Omnidirectional domain wall modes protected by fragile topological states
Authors: Pegah Azizi, Siddhartha Sarkar, Kai Sun, Stefano Gonella
Abstract: So-called fragile topological states of matter challenge our conventional notion of topology by lacking the robustness typically associated with topological protection, thereby displaying elusive manifestations that are difficult to harness for wave control. In this Letter, we leverage the recent discovery of fragile topological states in special classes of structural kagome lattices to document the availability of domain wall elastic wave modes that are directly traceable to fragile topology and, yet, exhibit remarkably strong signatures that support omni-directionality. We design twisted kagome bi-domains comprising two topologically distinct sublattices - one trivial and the other fragile topological - sharing a common bandgap and meeting at a domain wall. The two phases are achieved via carefully engineered surface cut patterns that modify the band landscape of the underlying lattices in complementary fashions, leading to dichotomous irreps landscapes. Under these circumstances, a domain wall-bound mode emerges within the shared bandgap and displays remarkable stability against domain wall orientation and introduced defects. We corroborate these findings via $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ Hamiltonian and Jackiw-Rabbi analysis and validate them experimentally through laser vibrometry tests on a prototype endowed with water jet-induced perforation patterns.

Title: Vacancies in generic Kitaev spin liquids
Authors: Ihor Yatsuta, David F. Mross
Abstract: The Kitaev honeycomb model supports gapless and gapped quantum spin liquid phases. Its exact solvability relies on extensively many locally conserved quantities. Any real-world manifestation of these phases would include imperfections in the form of disorder and interactions that break integrability. We show that the latter qualitatively alters the properties of vacancies in the gapless Kitaev spin liquid: (i) Isolated vacancies carry a magnetic moment, which is absent in the exactly solvable case. (ii) Pairs of vacancies on even/opposite sublattices gap each other with distinct power laws that reveal the presence of emergent gauge flux.

Title: Shell-Shaped Quantum Droplet in a Three-Component Ultracold Bose Gas
Authors: Yinfeng Ma, Xiaoling Cui
Abstract: Shell-shaped Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) is a typical quantum system in curved geometry. Here we propose a new type of shell-shaped BEC with self-bound character, thereby liberating it from stringent conditions such as microgravity or fine-tuned trap. Specifically, we consider a three-component (1,2,3) ultracold Bose gas where (1,2) and (2,3) both form quantum droplets. The two droplets are mutually immiscible due to strong 1-3 repulsion, while still linked by component-2 to form a globally self-bound object. The outer droplet then naturally develops a shell structure without any trapping potential. It is shown that the shell structure can significantly modify the equilibrium density of the core, and lead to unique collective excitations highlighting the core-shell correlation. All results have been demonstrated in a realistic $^{23}$Na-$^{39}$K-$^{41}$K mixture. By extending quantum droplets from flat to curved geometries, this work paves the way for future exploring the interplay of quantum fluctuations and non-trivial real-space topologies in ultracold gases.

Title: Temporal Contrastive Learning through implicit non-equilibrium memory
Authors: Martin J. Falk, Adam T. Strupp, Benjamin Scellier, Arvind Murugan
Abstract: The backpropagation method has enabled transformative uses of neural networks. Alternatively, for energy-based models, local learning methods involving only nearby neurons offer benefits in terms of decentralized training, and allow for the possibility of learning in computationally-constrained substrates. One class of local learning methods constrasts the desired, clamped behavior with spontaneous, free behavior. However, directly contrasting free and clamped behaviors requires explicit memory. Here, we introduce `Temporal Contrastive Learning', an approach that uses integral feedback in each learning degree of freedom to provide a simple form of implicit non-equilibrium memory. During training, free and clamped behaviors are shown in a sawtooth-like protocol over time. When combined with integral feedback dynamics, these alternating temporal protocols generate an implicit memory necessary for comparing free and clamped behaviors, broadening the range of physical and biological systems capable of contrastive learning. Finally, we show that non-equilibrium dissipation improves learning quality and determine a Landauer-like energy cost of contrastive learning through physical dynamics.

Title: Field-orientation-dependent magnetic phases in GdRu$_2$Si$_2$ probed with muon-spin spectroscopy
Authors: B. M. Huddart, A. Hernández-Melián, G. D. A. Wood, D. A. Mayoh, M. Gomilšek, Z. Guguchia, C. Wang, T. J. Hicken, S. J. Blundell, G. Balakrishnan, T. Lancaster
Abstract: Centrosymmetric GdRu$_2$Si$_2$ exhibits a variety of multi-Q magnetic states as a function of temperature and applied magnetic field, including a square skyrmion-lattice phase. The material's behavior is strongly dependent on the direction of the applied field, with different phase diagrams resulting for fields applied parallel or perpendicular to the crystallographic $c$ axis. Here, we present the results of muon-spin relaxation ($\mu^+$SR) measurements on single crystals of GdRu$_2$Si$_2$. Our analysis is based on the computation of muon stopping sites and consideration of zero-point motion effects, allowing direct comparison with the underlying spin textures in the material. The muon site is confirmed experimentally, using angle-dependent measurements of the muon Knight shift. Using transverse-field $\mu^+$SR with fields applied along either the [001] or [100] crystallographic directions, we distinguish between the magnetic phases in this system via their distinct muon response, providing additional evidence for the skyrmion and meron-lattice phases, while also suggesting the existence of RKKY-driven muon hyperfine coupling. Zero-field $\mu^+$SR provides clear evidence for a transition between two distinct magnetically-ordered phases at 39 K.

Title: Helical Ribbons: Simple Chiral Sedimentation
Authors: Elias Huseby, Josephine Gissinger, Fabien Candelier, Nimish Pujara, Gautier Verhille, Bernhard Mehlig, Greg Voth
Abstract: We investigate the sedimentation of chiral particles in viscous fluid flow. We identify helical ribbons as simple particles with strong translation-rotation coupling whose symmetry ensures that the centers of mass, buoyancy, resistance, and mobility coincide. Experimental measurements of both relevant mobility tensors show excellent agreement with simulations of ribbons made of interacting spheres. We observe quasi-periodic angular dynamics causing complex spatial trajectories. In tilt-spin phase space, orbits are closed due to time-reversal and reflection symmetry. Changing the helical ribbon length reveals a bifurcation at which the stable sedimentation orientations switch.

Title: Revealing Symmetry-Broken Superconducting Configurations by Density Functional Theory
Authors: Zi-Kui Liu, Shun-Li Shang
Abstract: A coherent theory for the superconductivity of both conventional and unconventional superconductors is currently lacking. Here we show that superconductivity arises from the formation of a symmetry-broken superconducting configuration (SCC) due to atomic perturbation of the normal conducting configuration (NCC). This perturbation creates straight one-dimensional tunnels (SODTs) for charge density of electrons and/or holes as revealed by the calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). The SODTs act as resistance-free superhighways and are correlated to the Cooper pairs in the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory. The formation of SODTs implies that the electron-phonon interaction in the BCS theory can be represented by the difference in charge densities between SCC and NCC predicted by DFT. The present work highlights that in conventional superconductors, SODTs are embedded within the bulk materials and are easily destroyed by phonon vibrations, resulting in a low critical superconducting temperature (T_C). Conversely, in unconventional superconductors such as YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO7), SODTs are protected by a layered pontoon structure with very weak bonding to the bulk materials, maintaining SODTs' stability at higher temperatures and leading to a much higher T_C. The present approach is validated for 13 conventional superconductors of 18 pure elements examined in this work, including the presently predicted superconductivity in Cu, Ag, Au, Sb, and Bi at 0 K and 0 GPa, and one unconventional superconductor of YBCO7. Our discovery indicates that DFT can be a practical tool for predicting superconductors, enabling a systematic search for new superconducting materials in the future.

Title: Rotational Superradiance in a Time-Reversal Symmetry-Broken Quantum Gas inside an Optical Cavity
Authors: Natalia Masalaeva, Farokh Mivehvar
Abstract: Appearance of quantized vortices in a superfluid and a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) stems from their nontrivial response to broken time-reversal symmetry (TRS). Here we show that breaking of the TRS by, for example, rotation or an external synthetic magnetic field in a transversely-driven BEC coupled to a single mode of an optical cavity modifies drastically Dicke-superradiance and self-ordering phenomena in this system. In particular, photon scattering from the pump laser into the cavity is amplified by the rotational motion of the BEC, leading to so-called 'rotational superradiance' - in a loose analogy to black-hole physics - with distinct critical scaling properties. Another notable finding is that cavity photons mediate long-range, periodic attractive interactions among the vortices, which compete with pair-wise logarithmic repulsive vortex interactions and deform the Abrikosov triangular vortex lattice favoring a stripe-like pattern. Remarkably, the rotation of the BEC and topological properties of the vortex lattice can be monitored nondestructively through the cavity output field.

Title: Nonreciprocity of supercurrent along applied magnetic field
Authors: Filippo Gaggioli, Yasen Hou, Jagadeesh S. Moodera, Akashdeep Kamra
Abstract: Nonreciprocal current responses arise in a broad range of systems, from magnons and phonons to supercurrents, due to an interplay between spatial and temporal symmetry breakings. These find applications in devices, such as circulators and rectifiers, as well as in probing the interactions and states that underlie the nonreciprocity. An established symmetry argument anticipates emergence of nonreciprocal currents along a direction perpendicular to the applied magnetic field that breaks the time-reversal symmetry. Here, motivated by recent experiments, we examine the emergence of nonreciprocity in vortex-limited superconducting critical currents along an applied magnetic field. Employing London's equations for describing the Meissner response of a superconducting film, we find that an additional symmetry breaking due to a preferred vortex axis enables nonreciprocal critical currents along the applied magnetic field, consistent with the so far unexplained experimental observation. Building on our concrete theoretical model for supercurrents, we discuss a possible generalization of the prevailing symmetry consideration to encompass nonreciprocal currents along the time-reversal symmetry breaking direction.

Title: Non-local twist sequences in floppy kagome chains
Authors: Pegah Azizi, Stefano Gonella
Abstract: The twisted kagome family comprises a spectrum of configurations that can be realized through the sweep of a single configurational degree of freedom known as a twist angle. Recently, it was shown that certain pairs of configurations along this sweep were linked by duality transformations and displayed matching phonon spectra. In this work, we introduce an intercell-connection system that spreads the lattice in the dimension orthogonal to the tessellation plane. The resulting three-dimensional character of the lattice allows us to sweep the entirety of the twist-angle spectrum, including all the compact configurations featuring overlapping triangles that, in a strictly two-dimensional space, are forbidden. Duality provides precious guidance for interpreting the availability of floppy mechanisms arising in the compact configurations through the one-to-one correspondence with their expanded counterparts. Our focus is on the compact configuration corresponding to a null twist angle, where the lattice degenerates to a chain. From the perspective of the chain, several of the local connections between neighboring lattice cells play the role of nonlocal long-range interactions between cells of the chain. We demonstrate experimentally some peculiar behavior that results from such nonlocality, including a selective activation of floppy sequences that is informed by the direction of loading.

Title: Structure and dynamics of electron-phonon coupled systems using neural quantum states
Authors: Ankit Mahajan, Paul J. Robinson, Joonho Lee, David R. Reichman
Abstract: In this work, we use neural quantum states (NQS) to describe the high-dimensional wave functions of electron-phonon coupled systems. We demonstrate that NQS can accurately and systematically learn the underlying physics of such problems through a variational Monte Carlo optimization of the energy with minimal incorporation of physical information even in highly challenging cases. We assess the ability of our approach across various lattice model examples featuring different types of couplings. The flexibility of our NQS formulation is demonstrated via application to ab initio models parametrized by density functional perturbation theory consisting of electron or hole bands coupled linearly to dispersive phonons. We compute accurate real-frequency spectral properties of electron-phonon systems via a novel formalism based on NQS. Our work establishes a general framework for exploring diverse ground state and dynamical phenomena arising in electron-phonon systems, including the non-perturbative interplay of correlated electronic and electron-phonon effects in systems ranging from simple lattice models to realistic models of materials parametrized by ab initio calculations.

Title: Machine learning Hubbard parameters with equivariant neural networks
Authors: Martin Uhrin, Austin Zadoks, Luca Binci, Nicola Marzari, Iurii Timrov
Abstract: Density-functional theory with extended Hubbard functionals (DFT+$U$+$V$) provides a robust framework to accurately describe complex materials containing transition-metal or rare-earth elements. It does so by mitigating self-interaction errors inherent to semi-local functionals which are particularly pronounced in systems with partially-filled d and f electronic states. However, achieving accuracy in this approach hinges upon the accurate determination of the on-site $U$ and inter-site $V$ Hubbard parameters. In practice, these are obtained either by semi-empirical tuning, requiring prior knowledge, or, more correctly, by using predictive but expensive first-principles calculations. Here, we present a machine learning model based on equivariant neural networks which uses atomic occupation matrices as descriptors, directly capturing the electronic structure, local chemical environment, and oxidation states of the system at hand. We target here the prediction of Hubbard parameters computed self-consistently with iterative linear-response calculations, as implemented in density-functional perturbation theory (DFPT), and structural relaxations. Remarkably, when trained on data from 12 materials spanning various crystal structures and compositions, our model achieves mean absolute relative errors of 3% and 5% for Hubbard $U$ and $V$ parameters, respectively. By circumventing computationally expensive DFT or DFPT self-consistent protocols, our model significantly expedites the prediction of Hubbard parameters with negligible computational overhead, while approaching the accuracy of DFPT. Moreover, owing to its robust transferability, the model facilitates accelerated materials discovery and design via high-throughput calculations, with relevance for various technological applications.

Title: Landau-Lifshitz damping from Lindbladian dissipation in quantum magnets
Authors: Götz S. Uhrig
Abstract: As of now, the phenomenological classical Landau-Lifshitz (LL) damping of magnetic order is not conceptually linked to the quantum theory of dissipation of the Lindbladian formalism which is unsatisfactory for the booming research on magnetic dynamics. Here, it is shown that LL dynamics can be systematically derived from Lindbladian dynamics in a local mean-field theory for weak external fields. The derivation also extends the LL dynamics beyond the orientation $\vec{m}/|\vec{m}|$ to the length $|\vec{m}|$ of the magnetization. A key assumption is that the Lindbladian dissipation adapts to the non-equilibrium $H(t)$ instantaneously to lower its expectation value.

Title: Borromean supercounterfluids at finite temperatures
Authors: Alexandru Golic, Igor Timoshuk, Egor Babaev, Boris Svistunov
Abstract: While the properties of standard (single-component) superfluids are well understood, principal differences arise in a special type of multicomponent systems -- the so-called Borromean supercounterfluids -- in which (i) supertransport is possible only in the counterflow regime and (ii) there are three or more counterflowing components. Borromean supercounterfluids's correlation and topological properties distinguish them from their single- and two-component counterparts. The component-symmetric case characterized by a distinctively different universality class of the supercounterfluid-to-normal phase transition is especially interesting. Using the recently introduced concept of compact-gauge invariance as the guiding principle, we develop the finite-temperature description of Borromean supercounterfluids in terms of an asymptotically exact long-wave effective action. We formulate and study Borromean XY and loop statistical models, capturing the universal long-range properties and allowing us to perform efficient worm algorithm simulations. Numeric results demonstrate perfect agreement with analytic predictions. Particularly instructive is the two-dimensional case, where the Borromean nature of the system is strongly manifested while allowing for an asymptotically exact analytic description.

Title: Photon counting statistics in Gaussian bosonic networks
Authors: Kalle S. U. Kansanen, Pedro Portugal, Christian Flindt, Peter Samuelsson
Abstract: The statistics of transmitted photons in microwave cavities play a foundational role in microwave quantum optics and its technological applications. By utilizing quantum mechanical phase-space methods, we here develop a general theory of the photon counting statistics in Gaussian bosonic networks consisting of driven cavities with beamsplitter interactions and two-mode-squeezing. The dynamics of the network can be captured by a Lyapunov equation for the covariance matrix of the cavity fields, which generalizes to a Riccati equation, when counting fields are included. By solving the Riccati equation, we obtain the statistics of emitted and absorbed photons as well as the time-dependent correlations encoded in waiting time distributions and second-order coherence functions. To illustrate our theoretical framework, we first apply it to a simple linear network consisting of two coupled cavities, for which we evaluate the photon cross-correlations and discuss connections between the photon emission statistics and the entanglement between the cavities. We then consider a bosonic circulator consisting of three coupled cavities, for which we investigate how a synthetic flux may affect the direction of the photon flow, similarly to recent experiments. Our general framework paves the way for systematic investigations of the photon counting statistics in Gaussian bosonic networks.

Title: Exploring van der Waals cuprate superconductors using a hybrid microwave circuit
Authors: Haolin Jin, Giuseppe Serpico, Yejin Lee, Tommaso Confalone, Christian N. Saggau, Flavia Lo Sardo, Genda Gu, Berit H. Goodge, Edouard Lesne, Domenico Montemurro, Kornelius Nielsch, Nicola Poccia, Uri Vool
Abstract: The advent of two-dimensional van der Waals materials is a frontier of condensed matter physics and quantum devices. However, characterizing such materials remains challenging due to the limitations of bulk material techniques, necessitating the development of specialized methods. In this study, we investigate the superconducting properties of Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x flakes by integrating them with a hybrid superconducting microwave resonator. The hybrid resonator is significantly modified by the interaction with the flake while maintaining a high quality factor. We also observe a significant upshift of the resonator frequency with increasing temperature, as well as a positive nonlinearity. These effects originate from a presently unknown microscopic mechanism within the flake, and can be modeled as a two-level system bath interacting with the resonant mode. Our findings open a path for high quality hybrid circuits with van der Waals flakes for exploring novel materials and developing new devices for quantum technology.

Title: Electric field induced second-order anomalous Hall transport in unconventional Rashba systems
Authors: Ankita Bhattacharya, Annica M. Black-Schaffer
Abstract: Nonlinear responses in transport experiments may unveil information and generate new phenomena in materials that are not accessible at linear order due to symmetry constraints. While the linear anomalous Hall response strictly requires the absence of time-reversal symmetry, the second-order, thus nonlinear, Hall response needs broken inversion symmetry. Recently, much effort has been made to obtain a second-order Hall voltage in response to a longitudinal ac driving current, both to obtain information about band geometric quantities and for its useful technological applications, including rectification and frequency doubling. Typically, additional material engineering is required in noncentrosymmetric systems to obtain second-order responses since it obeys a stringent crystallographic symmetry constraint. To circumvent this, an alternative route is to apply a dc electric field. In this Letter, we uncover an electric field induced second-order anomalous Hall effect in inversion-broken systems possessing experimentally accessible unconventional Rashba bands. We establish that the quantum metric, a geometrical feature of electronic wave functions providing information on the nontrivial structure of Bloch bands, is responsible for providing the nonlinear Hall response

Title: Nature of temperature chaos in spin glasses
Authors: Hongze Li, Jiaming He, Raymond L. Orbach
Abstract: Temperature chaos (TC) in spin glasses has been claimed to exist no matter how small the temperature change, $\Delta T$. However, experimental studies have exhibited a finite value of $\Delta T$ for a transition to TC. This paper explores the onset of TC with much higher resolution than before and over a larger temperature range. We find that TC is always present, though small at the smallest $\Delta T$ that we can reliably measure. However, it grows rapidly as $\Delta T$ increases, the region of rapid growth coinciding with the $\Delta T$ predicted from renormalization group arguments and observed experimentally. We are able to transcend the full range of TC, from the completely reversible state to one that is maximally decorrelated from the initially prepared state.

Title: Magnetic hardness of hexagonal and orthorhombic Fe$_{3}$C, Co$_{3}$C, (Fe-Co)$_{3}$C, and their alloys with boron, nitrogen, and transition metals: A first-principles study
Authors: Justyn Snarski-Adamski, Mirosław Werwiński, Justyna Rychły-Gruszecka
Abstract: In this study, we considered a large set of materials that are closely related to orthorhombic Fe$_3$C (cementite) with the aim of characterizing trends in their intrinsic magnetic properties and identifying alloys that are optimal for applications. A comprehensive analysis was conducted on the full concentration ranges of hexagonal ($\epsilon$) and orthorhombic ($\theta$) phases of (Fe-Co)$_3$C, (Fe-Co)$_3$(B-C), (Fe-Co)$_3$(C-N), and their alloys with 3$d$, 4$d$ and 5$d$ transition metals. The calculations were performed using the density functional theory implemented in the full-potential local-orbital code (FPLO). Calculated properties included formation energies, Curie temperatures, magnetic moments, magnetocrystalline anisotropy energies (MAE), and magnetic hardnesses. The considered compositions exhibit a range of magnetic properties, including soft, semi-hard, and hard magnetic. The materials most promising for hard-magnetic applications are orthorhombic Co$_3$C compound, together with selected Co-rich orthorhombic (Fe,Co)$_3$C and hexagonal (Fe,Co)$_3$C alloys. The calculation results do not indicate that substituting with transition metals increases the potential of the alloys for permanent magnet applications. A significant drawback of alloying orthorhombic $\theta$-Fe$_3$C (cementite) with transition metals is the notable decline in the Curie temperature. We found that a considerable proportion of the orthorhombic Co$_3$(B-C-N) alloys are magnetically hard, of which boron substitution raises the Curie temperature and improves stability. By mapping the dependence of MAE on the concentration of elements covering both the 3$d$ (from Fe to Co) and 2$p$ (from B, through C, to N) positions, we have demonstrated for the first time the near isoelectronic nature of MAE. The latter observation may be particularly useful in designing compositions of new magnetically hard materials.

Title: Insights from the exact analytical solution of periodically driven transverse field Ising chain
Authors: Pritam Das, Anirban Dutta
Abstract: We derive an exact analytical expression at stroboscopic intervals for the time-dependent wave function of a class of integrable quantum many-body systems, driven by the periodic delta-kick protocol. To investigate long-time dynamics, we use the wave function to obtain an exact analytical expression for the expectation values of the defect density, magnetization, residual energy, fidelity, and the correlation function after the $n$th drive cycle. Periodically driven integrable closed quantum systems absorb energy, and the long-time universal dynamics are described by the periodic generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE). We demonstrate that the expectation values of all observables are divided into two parts: one highly oscillatory term that depends on the drive cycle n, and the rest of the terms are independent of it. Typically, the $n$-independent part constitutes the saturation at large n and periodic GGE. The contribution from the highly oscillatory term vanishes in large $n$. We also generalize our formalism to include square pulse and sinusoidal driving protocols.

Title: Winding Topology of Multifold Exceptional Points
Authors: Tsuneya Yoshida, J. Lukas K. König, Lukas Rødland, Emil J. Bergholtz, Marcus Stålhammar
Abstract: Despite their ubiquity, a systematic classification of multifold exceptional points, $n$-fold spectral degeneracies (EP$n$s), remains a significant unsolved problem. In this article, we characterize the Abelian eigenvalue topology of generic EP$n$s and symmetry-protected EP$n$s for arbitrary $n$. The former and the latter emerge in a $(2n-2)$- and $(n-1)$-dimensional parameter space, respectively. By introducing topological invariants called resultant winding numbers, we elucidate that these EP$n$s are stable due to topology of a map from a base space (momentum or parameter space) to a sphere defined by resultants. In a $D$-dimensional parameter space ($D\geq c$), the resultant winding number topologically characterize a $(D-c)$-dimensional manifold of generic [symmetry-protected] EP$n$s whose codimension is $c=2n-2$ [$c=n-1$]. Our framework implies fundamental doubling theorems for both generic EP$n$s and symmetry-protected EP$n$s in $n$-band models.

Title: Noninvertible operators in one, two, and three dimensions via gauging spatially modulated symmetry
Authors: Hiromi Ebisu, Bo Han
Abstract: Spatially modulated symmetries have emerged since the discovery of fractons, which characterize unconventional topological phases with mobility-constrained quasiparticle excitations. On the other hand, non-invertible duality defects have attracted substantial attention in communities of high energy and condensed matter physics due to their deep insight into quantum anomalies and exotic phases of matter. However, the connection between these exotic symmetries and defects has not been fully explored. In this paper, we construct concrete lattice models with non-invertible duality defects via gauging spatially modulated symmetries and investigate their exotic fusion rules. Specifically, we construct spin models with subsystem symmetries or dipole symmetries on one, two, and three-dimensional lattices. Gauging subsystem symmetries leads to non-invertible duality defects whose fusion rules involve $0$-form subsystem charges in two dimensions and higher-form operators that correspond to ``lineon'' excitations (excitations which are mobile along one-dimensional line) in three dimensions. Gauging dipole symmetries leads to non-invertible duality defects with dipole algebras that describe a hierarchical structure between global and dipole charges. Notably, the hierarchical structure of the dual dipole charges is inverted compared with the original ones. Our work provides a unified and systematic analytical framework for constructing exotic duality defects by gauging relevant symmetries.

Title: Fate of pseudo mobility-edge and multiple states in non-Hermitian Wannier-Stark lattice
Authors: Yu-Jun Zhao, Han-Ze Li, Xuyang Huang, Shan-Zhong Li, Jian-Xin Zhong
Abstract: The interaction between non-reciprocity and disorder-free localization has emerged as a fascinating open question. Here, we explore the effects of pseudo mobility edges (MEs) along with different types of eigenstates in a one-dimensional (1D) lattice subjected to a non-reciprocal finite-height Wannier-Stark ladder. Utilizing the transfer matrix method, we analytically investigate the pseudo mobility edges under non-reciprocity, which accurately describe the boundary between ergodic and non-ergodic states. The ergodic states, under nonreciprocity, form topological point gaps in the complex plane, with the corresponding eigenstates localized at the boundaries. The localization of mixed states induced by the skin effect and Wannier-Stark ladder is further amplified under non-reciprocity. Through similarity transformations, the fate of multiple eigenstates under non-reciprocal transitions can be captured. Finally, we use wave packet dynamics as a means to detect these emerging states. Our findings broaden the understanding of disorder-free localization in non-Hermitian systems.

Title: Analytic approach to thermoelectric transport in double quantum dots
Authors: Nahual Sobrino, David Jacob, Stefan Kurth
Abstract: A recently proposed analytical solution for the equations of motion of the one-body Green function of the double quantum dot is extended to the out-of-equilibrium situation. By solving a linear system for the density correlators, not only the local occupations but also charge and heat currents as well as transport coefficients and the figure of merit are analytically derived in terms of system parameters and external driving forces. The emerging regions of stable occupation and finite currents are explained in terms of addition and removal energies, corresponding to the poles of the Green function. The analytical results are validated against the hierarchical equations of motion method, showing excellent agreement.

Title: Nonequilibrium thermodynamic foundation of the grand-potential phase field model
Authors: Jin Zhang, James A. Warren, Peter W. Voorhees
Abstract: Choosing the correct free energy functional is critical when developing thermodynamically consistent phase field models. We show that the grand-potential phase field model minimizes the Helmholtz free energy when mass conservation is imposed. While both functionals are at a minimum at equilibrium, the Helmholtz free energy decreases monotonically with time in the grand-potential phase field model, whereas the grand potential does not. Minimizing the grand potential implies a different problem where a system can exchange mass with its surroundings at every point, leading to a condition of isochemical potential and invalidating mass conservation of the system.

Title: Magnon spectroscopy in the electron microscope

Abstract: The miniaturisation of transistors is approaching its limits due to challenges in heat management and information transfer speed. To overcome these obstacles, emerging technologies such as spintronics are being developed, which leverage the electron's spin in addition to its charge. Local phenomena at interfaces or structural defects will greatly influence the efficiency of spin-based devices, making the ability to study and control spin wave propagation at the nano- and atomic scales a key challenge. The development of high-spatial-resolution tools to probe spin waves, also called magnons, at relevant lengthscales is thus essential to understand how their properties are affected by such local features. Here, we show the first experimental detection of bulk magnons at the nanoscale using scanning transmission electron microscopy. By employing high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy with hybrid-pixel direct electron detectors optimized for low acceleration voltages, we successfully overcome the challenges posed by weak signals and identify magnon excitations in a thin NiO nanocrystal. Advanced inelastic electron scattering simulations corroborate our findings. These results open new avenues for detecting magnons, exploring their dispersions and their modifications arising from nanoscale structural or chemical defects. This marks an important milestone in magnonics and presents exciting opportunities for the future development of spintronic devices.

Title: Observation of the spiral spin liquid in a triangular-lattice material

Abstract: The spiral spin liquid (SSL) is a highly degenerate state characterized by a continuous contour or surface in reciprocal space spanned by a spiral propagation vector. Although the SSL state has been predicted in a number of various theoretical models, very few materials are so far experimentally identified to host such a state. Via combined single-crystal wide-angle and small-angle neutron scattering, we report observation of the SSL in the quasi-two-dimensional delafossite AgCrSe$_2$. We show that it is a very close realization of the ideal Heisenberg $J_1$--$J_2$--$J_3$ frustrated model on the triangular lattice. By supplementing our experimental results with microscopic spin-dynamics simulations, we demonstrate how such exotic magnetic states are driven by thermal fluctuations and exchange frustration.

Title: Temporal reversibility of reactive systems out of equilibrium: Molecular dynamics simulation
Authors: O. Politano, Alejandro L. Garcia, F. Baras, M. Malek Mansour
Abstract: The second law of thermodynamics states that entropy production in macroscopic systems is non-negative, reaching zero only at thermodynamic equilibrium. As a corollary, this implies that the state trajectory of macroscopic systems is inherently time-irreversible under out-of-equilibrium conditions. However, over the past half-century, various studies have shown that this principle does not universally apply to the composition sample paths of certain isothermal reactive systems. Theoretical frameworks leading to this surprising observation primarily focus on perfectly homogeneous systems (often referred to as zero-dimensional systems), which inherently exclude the effects of local fluctuations. This oversimplification may account for the paradoxical theoretical predictions. In the absence of relevant experimental data, this paper seeks to explore this phenomenon through microscopic simulations.

Title: Static and Dynamical Spin Correlations in the Kitaev Model at Finite Temperatures via Green's Function Equation of Motion
Authors: Hibiki Takegami, Takao Morinari
Abstract: The Kitaev model, renowned for its exact solvability and potential to host non-Abelian anyons, remains a focal point in the study of quantum spin liquids and topological phases. While much of the existing literature has employed Majorana fermion techniques to analyze the model, particularly at zero temperature, its finite-temperature behavior has been less thoroughly explored via alternative approaches. In this paper, we investigate the finite-temperature properties of the Kitaev model using the spin Green's function formalism. This approach enables the computation of key physical quantities such as spin correlations, magnetic susceptibility, and the dynamical spin structure factor, offering crucial insights into the system's thermal dynamics. In solving the equation of motion for the spin Green's function, we truncate the hierarchy of multi-spin Green's functions using a decoupling approximation, which proves to be particularly accurate at high temperatures. Our results show several similarities with Majorana-based numerical simulations, though notable differences emerge. Specifically, both static and dynamical spin-spin correlation functions capture not only $\mathbb{Z}_2$ flux excitations but also simple spin-flip excitations, with the latter overshadowing the former. Interestingly, without explicitly assuming fractionalization, our results for the spin susceptibility and spin relaxation rate still suggest the presence of fermionic degrees of freedom at low temperatures. This study provides a complementary approach to understanding the thermal properties of the Kitaev model, which could be relevant for future experiments and theoretical investigations.

Title: Topological Quantum Spin Hall Semimetals with Light
Authors: Karyn Le Hur
Abstract: We introduce a quantum spin Hall semimetal or Fermi liquid characterized with a Z2 topological invariant, measurable through circularly polarized light. We propose its engineering through two topological metallic band structures in crystals on the honeycomb lattice, with spin-orbit interaction, realizable through the interplay of a charge or spin density wave substrate and Zeeman effects, in between a quantum spin Hall and a quantum anomalous Hall insulator. These systems show topologically protected helical edge or photo-induced currents.

Title: Nonclassical heat flow in passive chiral solids is third rank, not odd
Authors: Roderic Lakes
Abstract: Chiral, directionally isotropic gyroid lattices are observed to exhibit nonclassical thermal effects incompatible with an asymmetric ("odd") second rank conductivity tensor but consistent with a third rank tensor property that provides a curl term. The lattices are passive materials so no driving torques are needed to obtain transverse flow. A method for determination of the length scale associated with chirality is provided. The polymer gyroid lattice made by 3D printing is a metamaterial which allows chirality that is tunable by geometry.

Title: Quantum transport theory for unconventional magnets; interplay of altermagnetism and p-wave magnetism with superconductivity
Authors: Tim Kokkeler, Ilya Tokatly, F. Sebastian Bergeret
Abstract: We present a quantum transport theory for generic magnetic metals, in which magnetism occurs predominantly due to exchange interactions, such as ferromagnets, antiferromagnets, altermagnets and p-wave magnets. Our theory is valid both for the normal and the superconducting state. We derive the effective low-energy action for each of these materials, where the spin space groups are used to determine the form of the tensor coefficients appearing in the action. The transport equations, which are obtained as the saddle point equations of this action, describe a wider range of phenomena than the usual quasiclassical equations. In ferromagnets, in addition to the usual exchange field and spin relaxation effects, we identify a spin-dependent renormalization of the diffusion coefficient, which provides a description of spinpolarized currents in both the normal and superconducting equal spin-triplet states. In the normal state, our equations provide a complete description of the spin-splitting effect in diffusive systems, recently predicted in ideal clean altermagnets. In the superconducting state, our equations predict a proximity induced magnetization, the appearance of a spontaneous magnetic moment in hybrid superconductor-altermagnet systems. The distribution and polarization direction of this magnetic moment depend on the symmetry of the structure, thus measurements of such polarization reveal the underlying microscopic symmetry of the altermagnet. Finally, for inversionsymmetry broken antiferromagnets, such as the p-wave magnet, we show that spin-galvanic effects which are distinguishable from the spin-galvanic effect induced by spin-orbit coupling only in the superconducting state. Besides these examples, our model applies to arbitrary magnetic systems, providing a complete theory for nonequilibrium transport in diffusive nonconventional magnets at arbitrary temperatures.

Title: Orbital-Selective Diffuse Magnetic Fluctuations in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$: a Unified Theoretical Picture
Authors: Maria Chatzieleftheriou, Alexander N. Rudenko, Yvan Sidis, Silke Biermann, Evgeny A. Stepanov
Abstract: The quasi-two-dimensional material Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ is a paradigmatic example of a correlated system that exhibits unconventional superconductivity and intriguing magnetic properties. The interplay between these two effects and the resulting strength and nature of spin fluctuations and their role for the properties of the compound have sparked significant debates. Here, elaborating a theory that self-consistently incorporates spatial magnetic fluctuations into a realistic many-body description, we show that these fluctuations significantly reduce many-body correlations in the system, thereby preventing magnetic ordering in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, in agreement with experimental observations. Our conclusion is supported by a theoretical calculation of the spin susceptibility that closely matches the experimental results. We obtain finite peaks at the incommensurate wave vectors, a broad dome-shaped structure centered around the $\Gamma$ point and a diminished magnetic response at the edges of the BZ. We identify the orbital character of the unusual dome structure as resulting predominantly from the 2D-like $xy$-orbital, which is believed to be responsible for the superconductivity.

Title: Rigorous bound on hydrodynamic diffusion for chaotic open spin chains
Authors: Dimitrios Ampelogiannis, Benjamin Doyon
Abstract: The emergence of diffusion is one of the deepest physical phenomena observed in many-body interacting, chaotic systems. But establishing rigorously that correlation functions, say of the spin, expand diffusively, remains one of the most important problems of mathematical physics. We establish for the first time, with Lindbladian evolution, a lower bound on spin diffusion in chaotic, translation-invariant, nearest-neighbor open quantum spin-$1/2$ chain satisfying a local detailed-balance condition and strong conservation of magnetisation. The bound is strictly positive if and only if the local quantum jumps transport spin. Physically, the bound comes from the spreading effects of initial-state macroscopic fluctuations, a mechanism which occurs whenever spin is an interacting ballistic mode. Chaoticity means that the Hilbert space of extensive charges is spanned by magnetisation; we expect this to be generic. Our main tool is the Green-Kubo formula, the mathematical technique of projection over quadratically extensive charges, and appropriate correlation decay bounds recently established. Because Lindbladian dynamics is not reversible, the Green-Kubo spin diffusion strength includes a contribution due to irreversibility, which we interpret as encoding the hydrodynamic entropy production that may occur in the forgotten environment. This, we show, vanishes for certain choices of interaction parameters, for which the Lindbladian dynamics becomes reversible. Our methods can be extended to finite or short ranges, higher spins, and other non-Hamiltonian systems such as quantum circuits. As we argue, according to the theory of nonlinear fluctuating hydrodynamics, we further expect these systems to display superdiffusion, and thus have {\em infinite} diffusivity; however this is still beyond the reach of mathematical rigour.

Title: Principled model selection for stochastic dynamics
Authors: Andonis Gerardos, Pierre Ronceray
Abstract: Complex dynamical systems, from macromolecules to ecosystems, are often modeled by stochastic differential equations. To learn such models from data, a common approach involves sparse selection among a large function library. However, we show that overfitting arises - not just from individual model complexity, but also from the combinatorial growth of possible models. To address this, we introduce Parsimonious Stochastic Inference (PASTIS), a principled method combining likelihood-estimation statistics with extreme value theory to suppress superfluous parameters. PASTIS outperforms existing methods and reliably identifies minimal models, even with low sampling rates or measurement error. It extends to stochastic partial differential equations, and applies to ecological networks and reaction-diffusion dynamics.

Title: Band Structure and Pairing Nature of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ Thin Film at Ambient Pressure
Authors: Zhi-Yan Shao, Yu-Bo Liu, Min Liu, Fan Yang
Abstract: Recently, evidences of superconductivity (SC) with onset $T_c$ above the McMillan limit have been detected in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ ultrathin film grown on the LaSrAlO$_4$ substrate at ambient pressure. This progress opens a new era in the field of the nickelate superconductors. Here we perform a density-functional-theory (DFT) based calculation for the band structure of this material. The obtained DFT+$U$ band structure has the feature that the bonding $d_{z^2}$ band crosses the Fermi level, forming the hole pocket $\gamma$, consistent with the angle-resolved-photo-emission-spectrum (ARPES). Taking the low-energy Ni-$(3d_{z^2},3d_{x^2-y^2})$ orbitals placed on the tetragonal lattice structure, we construct a 2D bilayer four-band tight-binding model which well captures the main features of the DFT+$U$ band structure. Then considering the multi-orbital Hubbard interaction, we adopt the random-phase approximation (RPA) approach to investigate the pairing nature. The obtained pairing symmetry is $s^{\pm}$ or $d_{xy}$ for the hole-doping level $\delta$ below or above 0.12, induced by the different Fermi surface nesting situations. For the realistic $\delta=0.21$ measured by the ARPES, our RPA calculations obtain the next-nearest-neighbor pairing $d_{xy}$-wave SC dominated by the $d_{z^2}$ orbital, consistent with the experimental observation that the $T_c$ enhances with the shrinking of the in-plane lattice constants and is insensitive to the c-axis one. This pairing state is induced by the nesting between the different patches within the $\gamma$ pocket. Our results appeal for experimental verifications.

Title: Almost Strong Zero Modes at Finite Temperature
Authors: Niklas Tausendpfund, Aditi Mitra, Matteo Rizzi
Abstract: Interacting fermionic chains exhibit extended regions of topological degeneracy of their ground states as a result of the presence of Majorana or parafermionic zero modes localized at the edges. In the opposite limit of infinite temperature, the corresponding non-integrable spin chains, obtained via generalized Jordan-Wigner mapping, are known to host so-called Almost Strong Zero Modes, which are long-lived with respect to any bulk excitations. Here, we study the fairly unexplored territory that bridges these two extreme cases of zero and infinite temperature. We blend two established techniques for states, the Lanczos series expansion and a tensor network ansatz, uplifting them to the level of operator algebra. This allows us to efficiently simulate large system sizes for arbitrarily long timescales and to extract the temperature-dependent decay rates. We observe that for the Kitaev-Hubbard model, the decay rate of the edge mode depends exponentially on the inverse temperature $\beta$, and on an effective energy scale $\Delta_{\rm eff}$ that is greater than the thermodynamic gap of the system $\Delta$.

Title: Dynamic Metal-Support Interaction Dictates Cu Nanoparticle Sintering on Al$_2$O$_3$ Surfaces
Authors: Jiayan Xu, Shreeja Das, Amar Deep Pathak, Abhirup Patra, Sharan Shetty, Detlef Hohl, Roberto Car
Abstract: Nanoparticle sintering remains a critical challenge in heterogeneous catalysis. In this work, we present a unified deep potential (DP) model for Cu nanoparticles on three Al$_2$O$_3$ surfaces ($\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$(100), $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$(110), and $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$(0001)). Using DP-accelerated simulations, we reveal striking facet-dependent nanoparticle stability and mobility patterns across the three surfaces. The nanoparticles diffuse several times faster on $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$(0001) than on $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$(100) at 800 K while expected to be more sluggish based on their larger binding energy at 0 K. Diffusion is facilitated by dynamic metal-support interaction (MSI), where the Al atoms switch out of the surface plane to optimize contact with the nanoparticle and relax back to the plane as the nanoparticle moves away. In contrast, the MSI on $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$(100) and on $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$(110) is dominated by more stable and directional Cu-O bonds, consistent with the limited diffusion observed on these surfaces. Our extended long-time MD simulations provide quantitative insights into the sintering processes, showing that the dispersity of nanoparticles (the initial inter-nanoparticle distance) strongly influences coalescence driven by nanoparticle diffusion. We observed that the coalescence of Cu$_{13}$ nanoparticles on $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$(0001) can occur in a short time (10 ns) at 800 K even with an initial inter-nanoparticle distance increased to 30 Å, while the coalescence on $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$(100) is inhibited significantly by increasing the initial inter-nanoparticle distance from 15 Å to 30 Å. These findings demonstrate that the dynamics of the supporting surface is crucial to understanding the sintering mechanism and offer guidance for designing sinter-resistant catalysts by engineering the support morphology.

Title: Optimizing the Critical Temperature and Superfluid Density of a Metal-Superconductor Bilayer
Authors: Yutan Zhang, Philip M. Dee, Benjamin Cohen-Stead, Thomas A. Maier, Steven Johnston, Richard Scalettar
Abstract: A promising path to realizing higher superconducting transition temperatures $T_c$ is the strategic engineering of artificial heterostructures. For example, quantum materials exhibiting some but not all of the characteristics necessary for a robust superconducting state could, in principle, be coupled with other materials in a way that alleviates their intrinsic shortcomings. In this work, we add numerical support to the hypothesis that a strongly interacting superconductor weakened by phase fluctuations can boost its $T_c$ by hybridizing the system with a metal. Using determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC), we simulate a two-dimensional bilayer composed of an attractive Hubbard model and a metallic layer in two regimes of the interaction strength $-|U|$. In the strongly interacting regime, we find that increasing the interlayer hybridization $t_\perp$ results in a nonmonotonic enhancement of $T_c$, with an optimal value comparable to the maximum $T_c$ observed in the single-layer attractive Hubbard model, confirming trends inferred from other approaches. In the intermediate coupling regime, when $-|U|$ is close to the value associated with the maximum $T_c$ of the single-layer model, increasing $t_\perp$ tends to decrease $T_c$, implying that the correlated layer was already optimally tuned. Importantly, we demonstrate that the mechanism behind these trends is related to enhancement in the superfluid stiffness, as was initially proposed by Kivelson [Physica B: Condensed Matter 318, 61 (2002)].

Title: A generative material transformer using Wyckoff representation
Authors: Pierre-Paul De Breuck, Hashim A. Piracha, Gian-Marco Rignanese, Miguel A. L. Marques
Abstract: Materials play a critical role in various technological applications. Identifying and enumerating stable compounds, those near the convex hull, is therefore essential. Despite recent progress, generative models either have a relatively low rate of stable compounds, are computationally expensive, or lack symmetry. In this work we present Matra-Genoa, an autoregressive transformer model built on invertible tokenized representations of symmetrized crystals, including free coordinates. This approach enables sampling from a hybrid action space. The model is trained across the periodic table and space groups and can be conditioned on specific properties. We demonstrate its ability to generate stable, novel, and unique crystal structures by conditioning on the distance to the convex hull. Resulting structures are 8 times more likely to be stable than baselines using PyXtal with charge compensation, while maintaining high computational efficiency. We also release a dataset of 3 million unique crystals generated by our method, including 4,000 compounds verified by density-functional theory to be within 0.001 eV/atom of the convex hull.

Title: Protecting Intercavity Polaritons in Strongly Coupled Cavities
Authors: Rodrigo Sánchez-Martínez, Yesenia A. García-Jomaso, David Ley-Domínguez, César L. Ordóñez-Romero, Hugo A. Lara-García, Giuseppe Pirruccio, Arturo Camacho-Guardian
Abstract: We theoretically designed and experimentally demonstrated a mechanism to protect a spatially segregated mixed light-matter state, known as intercavity exciton-polariton in strongly coupled optical cavities. This excitation, shared across the coupled cavity array, exhibits remarkable robustness over a wide momentum range, without compromising photon-exciton mixing or the spatial separation of its photonic and excitonic components, which also enables a tunable heavy mass. Additionally, we unveil a direct connection between the transparency window, characteristic of slow-light experiments, and the protection of the intercavity polariton nature. Both phenomena originate from the strategic design of an energy-level landscape featuring a $\Lambda$-scheme, opening new avenues for exploring and utilizing these unique optical excitations in advanced photonic applications.

Title: The foot, the fan, and the cuprate phase diagram: Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions
Authors: Subir Sachdev
Abstract: A Fermi liquid with a `large' Fermi surface (FL) can have a quantum phase transition to a spin density wave state (SDW) with reconstructed `small' Fermi pockets. Both FL and SDW phases obey the Luttinger constraints on the volume enclosed by the Fermi surfaces. The critical spin fluctuations lead to spin-singlet $d$-wave pairing, as observed in the cuprates. Studies of the influence of spatial disorder on the SDW-FL quantum phase transition predict an extended quantum-critical Griffiths-type phase at low temperatures on the large Fermi surface side. These computations agree with the `foot' seen in transport, and recent low temperature neutron scattering observations on La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$. However, this theory cannot explain the higher temperature pseudogap and the `fan' of strange metal of the hole-doped cuprates. Here we need to consider underlying Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions without symmetry breaking. Then the small Fermi surface phase does not obey the Luttinger constraint, and is instead a `fractionalized Fermi liquid' (FL*). A theory of FL* in single band models describes photoemission observations in the pseudogap phase. The FL*-FL quantum phase transition, and the influence of spatial disorder, is described by an analysis inspired by the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. This theory successfully describes linear-in-temperature resistivity, optical conductivity and thermopower observations. The crossovers connecting these lower and higher temperature descriptions are also discussed.

Title: Pair Wavefunction Symmetry in UTe2 from Zero-Energy Surface State Visualization
Authors: Qiangqiang Gu, Shuqiu Wang, Joseph P. Carroll, Kuanysh Zhussupbekov, Christopher Broyles, Sheng Ran, Nicholas P. Butch, Shanta Saha, Johnpierre Paglione, Xiaolong Liu, J.C. Séamus Davis, Dung-Hai Lee
Abstract: Although nodal spin-triplet topological superconductivity appears probable in UTe2, its superconductive order-parameter $\Delta_k$ remains unestablished. In theory, a distinctive identifier would be the existence of a superconductive topological surface band (TSB), which could facilitate zero-energy Andreev tunneling to an s-wave superconductor, and also distinguish a chiral from non-chiral $\Delta_k$ via enhanced s-wave proximity. Here we employ s-wave superconductive scan-tips and detect intense zero-energy Andreev conductance at the UTe2 (0-11) termination surface. Imaging reveals sub-gap quasiparticle scattering interference signatures with a-axis orientation. The observed zero-energy Andreev peak splitting with enhanced s-wave proximity, signifies that $\Delta_k$ of UTe2 is a non-chiral state: B1u, B2u or B3u. However, if the quasiparticle scattering along the a-axis is internodal, then a non-chiral B3u state is the most consistent for UTe2.

Title: Dispersal-induced instability in complex ecosystems
Authors: Joseph W. Baron, Tobias Galla
Abstract: In his seminal work in the 1970s, Robert May suggested that there is an upper limit to the number of species that can be sustained in stable equilibrium by an ecosystem. This deduction was at odds with both intuition and the observed complexity of many natural ecosystems. The so-called stability-diversity debate ensued, and the discussion about the factors contributing to ecosystem stability or instability continues to this day. We show in this work that dispersal can be a destabilising influence. To do this, we combine ideas from Alan Turing's work on pattern formation with May's random-matrix approach. We demonstrate how a stable equilibrium in a complex ecosystem with trophic structure can become unstable with the introduction of dispersal in space, and we discuss the factors which contribute to this effect. Our work highlights that adding more details to the model of May can give rise to more ways for an ecosystem to become unstable. Making May's simple model more realistic is therefore unlikely to entirely remove the upper bound on complexity.

Title: Krylov complexity and Trotter transitions in unitary circuit dynamics
Authors: Philippe Suchsland, Roderich Moessner, Pieter W. Claeys
Abstract: We investigate many-body dynamics where the evolution is governed by unitary circuits through the lens of `Krylov complexity', a recently proposed measure of complexity and quantum chaos. We extend the formalism of Krylov complexity to unitary circuit dynamics and focus on Floquet circuits arising as the Trotter decomposition of Hamiltonian dynamics. For short Trotter steps the results from Hamiltonian dynamics are recovered, whereas a large Trotter step results in different universal behavior characterized by the existence of local maximally ergodic operators: operators with vanishing autocorrelation functions, as exemplified in dual-unitary circuits. These operators exhibit maximal complexity growth, act as a memoryless bath for the dynamics, and can be directly probed in current quantum computing setups. These two regimes are separated by a crossover in chaotic systems. Conversely, we find that free integrable systems exhibit a nonanalytic transition between these different regimes, where maximally ergodic operators appear at a critical Trotter step.

Title: Improvement of Heatbath Algorithm in LFT using Generative models
Authors: Ali Faraz, Ankur Singha, Dipankar Chakrabarti, Shinichi Nakajima, Vipul Arora
Abstract: The Heatbath Algorithm is commonly used for sampling in local lattice field theories, but performing exact updates or sampling from the local density is challenging when dealing with continuous variables. Heatbath methods rely on rejection-based sampling at each site, which can suffer from low acceptance rates if the proposal distribution is not optimally chosen a nontrivial task. In this work, we propose a novel, straightforward approach for generating proposals at each lattice site for the phi4 and XY models using generative AI models. This method learns a conditional local distribution, without requiring training samples from the target, conditioned on both neighboring sites and action parameter values.

Title: Bosonized Momentum Distribution of a Fermi Gas via Friedrichs Diagrams
Authors: Sascha Lill
Abstract: Recently, Benedikter and the author proved an approximate formula for the momentum distribution of a 3d fermionic gas interacting by a short-range pair potential in the mean-field regime, within a trial state close to the ground state. Here, we derive an exact formula for the momentum distribution in this trial state, using a diagrammatic formalism due to Friedrichs. We further demonstrate how the formula of Benedikter and the author arises from a restriction of the contributing diagrams to those corresponding to a bosonization approximation.

Title: Strain activation of localized states in WSe2
Authors: Oguzhan Yücel, Denis Yagodkin, Jan N. Kirchhof, Abhijeet Kumar, Adrian Dewambrechies, Sviatoslav Kovalchuk, Yuefeng Yu, Kirill I. Bolotin (Freie Universität Berlin)
Abstract: Single-photon emission centers generated by controlled atomic force microscopy (AFM) indentation in monolayer WSe\(_2\) on a flexible polymer substrate are explored for applications in quantum technologies. Here, we study the response of these emitters to the polymer substrate's strain state, which is controlled by selecting the indentation force and by gradually thermally annealing the samples. In the indented areas, we observe sharp new photoluminescence (PL) peaks in the regions 1.62--1.68 eV and 1.70--1.73 eV, characterized by sublinear power dependence and spectral wandering. We find that these peaks arise only when the indentation force exceeds a few \(\mu\)N and generally redshift as the applied force increases. Conversely, after thermal annealing (\(T < 60^{\circ}\)C), WSe\(_2\) experiences strain relaxation, leading to a blueshift of the peaks' spectral position and their ultimate disappearance. Our analysis of the peaks' positions vs. strain allows us to draw several conclusions about the nature of these emission. Specifically, we elucidate the roles of excitonic confinement and hybridization between free excitons and defect-related states, a process activated by the strain level. Overall, our approach suggests that the energy of localized emitters may be controlled via strain engineering.

Title: Practical Few-Atom Quantum Reservoir Computing
Authors: Chuanzhou Zhu, Peter J. Ehlers, Hendra I. Nurdin, Daniel Soh
Abstract: Quantum Reservoir Computing (QRC) harnesses quantum systems to tackle intricate computational problems with exceptional efficiency and minimized energy usage. This paper presents a QRC framework that utilizes a minimalistic quantum reservoir, consisting of only a few two-level atoms within an optical cavity. The system is inherently scalable, as newly added atoms automatically couple with the existing ones through the shared cavity field. We demonstrate that the quantum reservoir outperforms traditional classical reservoir computing in both memory retention and nonlinear data processing through two tasks, namely the prediction of time-series data using the Mackey-Glass task and the classification of sine-square waveforms. Our results show significant performance improvements with an increasing number of atoms, facilitated by non-destructive, continuous quantum measurements and polynomial regression techniques. These findings confirm the potential of QRC as a practical and efficient solution to addressing complex computational challenges in quantum machine learning.

Title: Quantum fingerprints of self-organization in spin chains coupled to a Kuramoto model
Authors: V. M. Bastidas
Abstract: Floquet theory is a widely used framework to describe the dynamics of periodically-driven quantum systems. The usual set up to describe such kind of systems is to consider the effect of an external control with a definite period in time that can act either globally or locally on the system of interest. However, besides the periodicity, there is no classical correlation or other well defined structures in the drive. In this work, we consider drives that exhibit self-organization phenomena reaching periodic steady states with emergent symmetries. To substantiate our results, we consider two examples of a one-dimensional quantum spin chains in a transverse field coupled to a classical Kuramoto model. In the case of all-to-tall coupling, the Kuramoto model drives the Ising chain into a time-periodic steady state with an emergent translational symmetry. For a Kuramoto model in a Zig-zag lattice, the XX spin chain is trimerized and the dynamics exhibit topological behavior that can be exploited to perform topological pumping. Our results can be experimentally implemented in near-term quantum devices in digital and analog platforms.

Title: Confinement-Higgs and deconfinement-Higgs transitions in three-dimensional $Z(2)$ LGT
Authors: B. Allés, O. Borisenko, A. Papa
Abstract: We re-examine by numerical simulation the phase structure of the three-dimensional Abelian lattice gauge theory (LGT) with $Z(2)$ gauge fields coupled to $Z(2)$-valued Higgs fields. Concretely, we explore two different order parameters which are able to distinguish the three phases of the theory: (i) the Fredenhagen-Marcu operator used to discriminate between deconfinement and confinement/Higgs phases and (ii) the Greensite-Matsuyama overlap operator proposed recently to distinguish confinement and Higgs phases. The latter operator is an analog of the overlap Edwards-Anderson order parameter for spin-glasses. According to it, the Higgs phase is realized as a glassy phase of the gauge system. For this reason standard tricks for simulations of spin-glass phases are utilized in this work, namely tempered Monte Carlo and averaging over replicas. In addition, we also present results for a certain definition of distance between Higgs field configurations. Finally, we calculate various gauge-invariant correlation functions in order to extract the corresponding masses.

Title: Beyond CCSD(T) accuracy at lower scaling with auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo
Authors: Ankit Mahajan, James H. Thorpe, Jo S. Kurian, David R. Reichman, Devin A. Matthews, Sandeep Sharma
Abstract: We introduce a black-box auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) approach to perform highly accurate electronic structure calculations using configuration interaction singles and doubles (CISD) trial states. This method consistently provides more accurate energy estimates than coupled cluster singles and doubles with perturbative triples (CCSD(T)), often regarded as the gold standard in quantum chemistry. This level of precision is achieved at a lower asymptotic computational cost, scaling as $O(N^6)$ compared to the $O(N^7)$ scaling of CCSD(T). We provide numerical evidence supporting these findings through results for challenging main group and transition metal-containing molecules.

Title: Singularity of Levy walks in the lifted Pomeau-Manneville map
Authors: Samuel Brevitt, Alexander Schulz, Dominic Pegler, Holger Kantz, Rainer Klages
Abstract: Since groundbreaking works in the 1980s it is well-known that simple deterministic dynamical systems can display intermittent dynamics and weak chaos leading to anomalous diffusion. A paradigmatic example is the Pomeau-Manneville (PM) map which, suitably lifted onto the whole real line, was shown to generate superdiffusion that can be reproduced by stochastic Levy walks (LWs). Here we report that this matching only holds for parameter values of the PM map that are of Lebesgue measure zero in its two-dimensional parameter space. This is due to a bifurcation scenario that the map exhibits under variation of one parameter. Constraining this parameter to specific singular values at which the map generates superdiffusion by varying the second one, as has been done in previous literature, we find quantitative deviations between deterministic diffusion and diffusion generated by stochastic LWs in a particular range of parameter values, which cannot be cured by simple LW modifcations. We also explore the effect of aging on superdiffusion in the PM map and show that this yields a profound change of the diffusive properties under variation of the aging time, which should be important for experiments. Our findings demonstrate that even in this simplest well-studied setting, a matching of deterministic and stochastic diffusive properties is non-trivial.

Title: Space-Time-Coupled Qubits for Enhanced Superconducting Quantum Computing
Authors: Sajjad Taravati
Abstract: The pursuit of scalable and robust quantum computing necessitates innovative approaches to overcome the inherent challenges of qubit connectivity, decoherence, and susceptibility to noise and crosstalk. Conventional monochromatic qubit coupling architectures, constrained by nearest-neighbor interactions and limited algorithmic flexibility, exacerbate these issues, hindering the realization of practical large-scale quantum processors. In this work, we introduce a paradigm leveraging a space-time-modulated cryogenic-compatible Josephson metasurface to enable polychromatic qubit coupling. This metasurface facilitates frequency-selective interactions, transforming nearest-neighbor connectivity into all-to-all qubit interactions, while significantly enhancing coherence, noise robustness, and entanglement fidelity. Our proposed approach capitalizes on the unique capabilities of space-time-modulated Josephson metasurfaces, including dynamic four-dimensional wave manipulation, nonreciprocal state transmission, and state-frequency conversion, to mediate multi-frequency qubit interactions. By isolating qubit couplings into distinct spectral channels, the cryogenic-compatible metasurface mitigates crosstalk and environmental decoherence, extending coherence times and preserving quantum state fidelity. Full-wave simulations and quantum performance analyses demonstrate a significant enhancement in the operational efficiency of a superconducting qubit array, showcasing improved connectivity, robustness, and entanglement stability. This study establishes the potential of space-time-modulated cryogenic-compatible Josephson metasurfaces as a transformative platform for next-generation quantum computing, addressing critical bottlenecks and paving the way for scalable, high-performance quantum processors.
