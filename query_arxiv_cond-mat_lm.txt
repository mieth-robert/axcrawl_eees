Title: Introduction to some of the simplest topological phases of matter
Authors: Frank Schindler
Abstract: These lecture notes explain the classification of some simple fermionic topological phases of matter in a pedestrian manner, with an aim to be maximally pedagogical = doing things in excruciating detail. We focus on a many-body perspective, even if many of the models we work with are non-interacting. We start out with symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases of free fermions that are protected by U(1) symmetry = topological insulators. We then look at fermion topological phases that don't even need a symmetry = topological superconductors, and explain how their classification changes in presence of spinless time-reversal symmetry. We close by perturbatively checking which of the 1D topological phases we had found are stable to interactions.

Title: Artificial ferroelectric-like hysteresis in antiferroelectrics with non-uniform disorder
Authors: Yi Zhang, Xinyu Zhang, Zihao Zheng, Jiyang Xie, Jing Lou, Jiayi Qin, Shanhu Wang, Yang He, Yifeng Du, Bin Yang, Xin Huang, Huiping Han, Yilin Wu, Shuya Liu, Afzal Kjan, Zhidong Li, Qianxu Ye, Sheng'an Yang, Ji Ma, Hui Zhang, Xiang Liu, Qingming Chen, Wanbiao Hu, Jing Ma, Jianhong Yi, Jinming Guo, Shou Peng, Hao Pan, Liang Wu, Ce-Wen Nan
Abstract: Antiferroelectrics exhibit unique double-hysteresis polarization loops, which have garnered significant attention due to their potential applications such as energy storage, electromechanical transduction, as well as synapse devices. However, numerous antiferroelectric materials have been reported to display signs of hysteresis loops resembling those of ferroelectric materials, and a comprehensive understanding remains elusive. In this work, we provide a phenomenological model that reproduces such widely observed artificial ferroelectric hysteresis with a superposition of numerous disordered antiferroelectric loops that have varying antiferroelectric-to-ferroelectric transition fields, particularly when these field ranges intersect. Experimentally, we realized such artificial ferroelectric-like hysteresis loops in the prototypical antiferroelectric PbZrO$_3$ and PbHfO$_3$ thin films, by introducing non-uniform local disorder (e.g., defects) via fine-tuning of the film growth conditions. These ferroelectric-like states are capable of persisting for several hours prior to transitioning back into the thermodynamically stable antiferroelectric ground state. Those results provide insights into the fundamental impact of disorder on the AFE properties and new possibilities of disorder-tailored functions.

Title: Dynamical localization of interacting ultracold atoms in one-dimensional quasi-periodic potentials
Authors: Attis V. M. Marino, M. A. Caracanhas, V. S. Bagnato, B. Chakrabarti
Abstract: We present numerically exact non-equilibrium dynamics of a one-dimensional Bose gas in quasi-periodic lattice that plays an intermediate role between the long-ranged order and truly disordered systems exhibiting unusual correlated phases. Precision control over lattice depth, interaction strength and filling factor enables the exploration of various correlated phases in a finite periodic lattice. We investigate the system dynamics when the secondary incommensurate lattice is abruptly switched on. To solve the many-body Schroedinger equation, we employ the multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree method for bosons (MCTDHB). The many-body dynamics are analyzed through distinct measures of the Glauber correlation functions and dynamical fragmentation. Our study reveals four distinct scenarios of localization process in the non-equilibrium dynamics. Weakly interacting non-fragmented superfluid of incommensurate filling in the primary lattice exhibits collapse-revival dynamics of localization. In contrast, a fragmented superfluid with commensurate filling exhibits dynamical Mott localization. A strongly correlated, fully fragmented Mott state shows a subtle competition with localization introduced by the secondary lattice that merely melts the Mott correlations. Interestingly, in the fermionized Mott regime, where the density in each well is fragmented, the intra-dimer correlations exhibit unexpected robustness. These findings provide new insights into many-body correlation dynamics and novel localization mechanisms in quasi-periodic lattices, paving the way for engineering exotic quantum behaviors in ultracold atomic systems.

Title: Unifying framework for non-Hermitian and Hermitian topology in driven-dissipative systems
Authors: Clara C. Wanjura, Andreas Nunnenkamp
Abstract: Recently, a one-to-one correspondence between non-trivial non-Hermitian topology and directional amplification has been demonstrated, theoretically and experimentally, for the case of one complex band. Here, we extend our framework to multiple bands and higher spatial dimension. This proves to be far from trivial. Building on the singular value decomposition, we introduce a new quantity that we dub generalised singular spectrum (GSS). The GSS allows us to define physically meaningful bands related to the system's scattering behaviour and to define invariants for novel notions of point gaps (non-Hermitian topology) and line gaps (Hermitian-like topology), respectively. For both invariants, we prove a bulk-boundary correspondence and show that they give rise to two different kinds of topological edge modes. We illustrate our results with a 1D non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model and a 2D non-Hermitian model that features corner-to-corner amplification. Our work is relevant for many state-of-the-art experimental platforms and it sets the stage for applications such as novel directional amplifiers and non-reciprocal sensors.

Title: Dynamical correlation effects in twisted bilayer graphene under strain and lattice relaxation
Authors: Lorenzo Crippa, Gautam Rai, Dumitru Călugăru, Haoyu Hu, Jonah Herzog-Arbeitman, B. Andrei Bernevig, Roser Valentí, Giorgio Sangiovanni, Tim Wehling
Abstract: We study the impact of lattice effects due to heterostrain and relaxation on the correlated electron physics of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene, by applying dynamical mean-field theory to the topological heavy fermion model. Heterostrain is responsible for splitting the 8-fold degenerate flat bands into two 4-fold degenerate subsets, while relaxation breaks the particle-hole symmetry of the unperturbed THF model. The interplay of dynamical correlation effects and lattice symmetry breaking enables us to satisfactorily reproduce a wide set of experimentally observed features: splitting the flat band degeneracy has observable consequences in the form of a filling-independent maximum in the spectral density away from zero bias, which faithfully reproduces scanning tunneling microscopy and quantum twisting microscopy results alike. We also observe an overall reduction in the size and degeneracy of local moments upon lowering the temperature, in agreement with entropy measurements. The absence of particle-hole symmetry has as a consequence the stronger suppression of local moments on the hole-doped side relatively to the electron-doped side, and ultimately causes the differences in existence and stability of the correlated phases for negative and positive doping. Our results show that even fine-level structures in the experimental data can now be faithfully reproduced and understood.

Title: Quantum Dynamics of Electron Scattering from Skyrmions
Authors: Hareram Swain, Arijit Mandal, S. Satpathy, B.R.K. Nanda
Abstract: Scattering of electrons from chiral spin textures such as the skyrmions is an emerging research area due to its richness in topological quantum transport, which is significant for spintronic devices. We study the dynamical process of scattering of the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles in the form of Gaussian wavepackets from skyrmions with the aid of the non-relativistic time-dependent Schrödinger equation. The scattering cross section shows a rich angular dependence and is deterministically influenced by the iterative flipping of the spin state inside the skyrmion. The latter leads to a set of non-trivial outcomes which include finite transmission and reflection probabilities irrespective of interaction strength, formation of secondary wavefronts associated with back-converted spin components, and a long-lived quasi-bound state at the scattering center. In addition to the rich and intriguing physics, the numerical recipe developed here can be easily adopted for any arbitrary spin texture, which will prepare a playground to explore tunable spin transport.

Title: There and Back Again: A Gauging Nexus between Topological and Fracton Phases
Authors: Pranay Gorantla, Abhinav Prem, Nathanan Tantivasadakarn, Dominic J. Williamson
Abstract: Coupled layer constructions are a valuable tool for capturing the universal properties of certain interacting quantum phases of matter in terms of the simpler data that characterizes the underlying layers. In the study of fracton phases, the X-Cube model in 3+1D can be realized via such a construction by starting with a stack of 2+1D Toric Codes and turning on a coupling which condenses a composite "particle-string" object. In a recent work [arXiv:2505.13604], we have demonstrated that in fact, the particle-string can be viewed as a symmetry defect of a topological 1-form symmetry. In this paper, we study the result of gauging this symmetry in depth. We unveil a rich gauging web relating the X-Cube model to symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases protected by a mix of subsystem and higher-form symmetries, subsystem symmetry fractionalization in the 3+1D Toric Code, and non-trivial extensions of topological symmetries by subsystem symmetries. Our work emphasizes the importance of topological symmetries in non-topological, geometric phases of matter.

Title: Electrical detection of magnons with nanoscale magnetic tunnel junctions
Authors: Christopher Heins, Zeling Xiong, Attila Kákay, Joo-Von Kim, Thibaut Devolder, Aleksandra Titova, Johannes Müller, René Hübner, Andreas Worbs, Ryszard Narkowicz, Jürgen Fassbender, Katrin Schultheiss, Helmut Schultheiss
Abstract: Present information and communication technologies are largely based on electronic devices, which suffer from heat generation and high power consumption. Alternatives like spintronics and magnonics, which harness the spin degree of freedom, offer compelling pathways to overcome these fundamental limitations of charge-based electronics. Magnonics relies on spin waves, the collective excitations of magnetic moments in magnetically ordered materials, to achieve processing and transport of information at microwave frequencies without relying on charge currents. However, efficient means for all-electrical, high-resolution, semiconductor-compatible readout of information encoded in spin waves are still missing. Here, we demonstrate the electrical detection of spin waves using a nanoscale magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) cell fabricated in a state-of-the-art complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) production line. By engineering the dynamic coupling between spin waves and the magnetization state of the MTJ, we demonstrate transduction of spin-wave excitations into measurable electrical signals with high fidelity. Moreover, through these measurements, we find spectral line widths, associated with nonlinear processes, down to a few hundreds of kHz, which opens up new perspectives for spin waves as quantum transducers.

Title: Reaction/Diffusion Competition Drives Anomalous Relaxation of Vitrimers
Authors: Makayla R. Branham-Ferrari, Shinian Cheng, Alexei P. Sokolov, David S. Simmons
Abstract: Vitrimers are an emerging class of crosslinked polymer networks in which dynamic covalent bonds can exchange and rearrange, without any significant change in population of bonded states.1 Because these bonds can rearrange at high temperatures without disintegration of the network, vitrimers could combine the mechanical stability of traditional permanently crosslinked networks with the recyclability of glasses and physical networks. However, unlike classical transient/physical networks, vitrimers can relax at a rate that is decoupled from the mobility of their polymer segments. This challenges our fundamental understanding of how dynamic covalent networks relax and deform. Here we combine simulations, theory, and experiments to show that vitrimer dynamics exhibit two very different regimes: (i) a high temperature regime controlled by the local bond-exchange reaction rate and (ii) a low temperature regime controlled by segmental diffusion. This fundamental difference from traditional physical networks explains why vitrimers can exhibit Arrhenius dynamics, providing a foundation for their rational design.

Title: Ramp Josephson junctions of Al/Ti/Sr2RuO4: Observation of single-domain quantum oscillations and the detection of chiral edge current
Authors: Zixuan Li, Yiqun Alex Ying, Brian M. Zakrzewski, Yan Xin, Yu Wang, Zhiqiang Mao, Ying Liu
Abstract: The spontaneous breaking of time-reversal symmetry (TRS), one of the hallmarks of unconventional superconductivity, has been observed in the superconducting state of Sr2RuO4 by muon spin rotation in several independent studies. However, the chiral edge current expected in such a superconductor has not yet been established experimentally. In addition, the angle dependence of the phase of the superconducting order parameter (OP) in Sr2RuO4, which would enable determination of the full symmetry properties of the OP, has been determined only for a couple of angles. Both issues can be addressed by preparing high-quality Josephson junctions between Sr2RuO4 and a conventional s-wave superconductor with varying orientations relative to the crystal axes. Here we report the successful fabrication of ramp Josephson junctions of Al/Ti/ Sr2RuO4 on thin single crystals of Sr2RuO4 obtained by mechanical exfoliation. These junctions exhibit high-quality quantum oscillations as a function of magnetic field. Moreover, the junction resistance was found to be extremely sensitive to the current flowing in the Sr2RuO4 crystal, a feature that was used in this work to show that the chiral edge current. The approach to the chiral edge current detection, which was not used previously, was verified by a control experiment.

Title: Tunable Electronic Interactions and Weak Antilocalization in Bulk Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_{5-5x}$Se$_{5x}$ Phase Change Materials
Authors: Nicholas Mazzucca, Junjing Zhao, Zhenyang Xu, Despina Louca, Utpal Chatterjee, Marc Bockrath
Abstract: Phase change materials (PCMs) are well-known for their reversible and rapid switching between crystalline and amorphous phases through thermal excitations mediated by strong electrical or laser pulses. This crystal-to-amorphous transition is accompanied by a remarkable contrast in optical and electronic properties, making PCMs useful in nonvolatile data storage applications. Here, we combine electrical transport and angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements to study the electronic structure of bulk Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_{5-5x}$Se$_{5x}$ (GSST) for $0\le x \le 0.8$, where $x$ represents the amount of Se substituting Te in Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$ (GST)-- a prototypical PCM. The single-particle density of states (SDOS) derived from the integrated ARPES data displays metallic behavior for all $x$, as evidenced by the presence of a finite density of states in the vicinity of the chemical potential. Transport measurements also display clear signatures of metallic transport, consistent with the SDOS data. The temperature dependence of the resistance indicates the onset of moderate electron-electron Coulomb interaction effects at low temperatures for $x\geq 0.6$. At the same time, the magnetoresistance data shows signatures of weak antilocalization for $x\geq 0.6$. An analysis on the temperature dependence of the phase coherence length suggests that electron dephasing is primarily due to inelastic electron-electron scattering. We find that these effects are enhanced with increasing $x$, portraying GSST as a novel PCM where electronic interactions can be tuned via chemical doping.

Title: Rapid Autotuning of a SiGe Quantum Dot into the Single-Electron Regime with Machine Learning and RF-Reflectometry FPGA-Based Measurements
Authors: Marc-Antoine Roux, Joffrey Rivard, Victor Yon, Alexis Morel, Dominic Leclerc, Claude Rohrbacher, El Bachir Ndiaye, Felice Francesco Tafuri, Brendan Bono, Stefan Kubicek, Roger Loo, Yosuke Shimura, Julien Jussot, Clément Godfrin, Danny Wan, Kristiaan De Greve, Marc-André Tétrault, Dominique Drouin, Christian Lupien, Michel Pioro-Ladrière, Eva Dupont-Ferrier
Abstract: Spin qubits need to operate within a very precise voltage space around charge state transitions to achieve high-fidelity gates. However, the stability diagrams that allow the identification of the desired charge states are long to acquire. Moreover, the voltage space to search for the desired charge state increases quickly with the number of qubits. Therefore, faster stability diagram acquisitions are needed to scale up a spin qubit quantum processor. Currently, most methods focus on more efficient data sampling. Our approach shows a significant speedup by combining measurement speedup and a reduction in the number of measurements needed to tune a quantum dot device. Using an autotuning algorithm based on a neural network and faster measurements by harnessing the FPGA embedded in Keysight's Quantum Engineering Toolkit (QET), the measurement time of stability diagrams has been reduced by a factor of 9.8. This led to an acceleration factor of 2.2 for the total initialization time of a SiGe quantum dot into the single-electron regime, which is limited by the Python code execution.

Title: Analytical analysis of the spin wave dispersion in the cycloidal spin structures under the influence of magneto-electric coupling
Authors: Pavel A. Andreev
Abstract: Spin waves and coupling of the spin waves with electromagnetic waves are considered in the multiferroic materials with the electric dipole moment proportional to the scalar product of spins. Dispersion dependence for the spin waves propagating as the perturbation of the equilibrium state described by spin cycloid is found. The dielectric permeability as the response on the electromagnetic perturbations associated with the magneto-electric coupling for the same equilibrium state is calculated.

Title: Conservative yet constitutively odd elasticity in prestressed metamaterials
Authors: Tyler A. Engstrom, Daniel M. Sussman
Abstract: We introduce a design principle for mechanical metamaterials based on "odd elasticity, once removed." By revisiting classic results relating the variation of Cauchy stress and Lagrangian strain around a prestressed reference state, we show how anisotropic, equilibrium prestress can generate a major anti-symmetry in the material's constitutive response. Tuning the system to such a state drives it to a critical instability, radically transforming its acoustic properties. We then inverse-design several uniform 2D solids that act as unique waveguides supporting decoupled modes along special lattice directions: a string-like mode and an exotic, in-plane soft mode with a flexural character ($\omega \sim q^2$). The soft modes are insensitive to the value of the anisotropic prestress and exhibit oscillating momentum density but support a non-oscillatory, constant energy current. This principle of harnessing conservative "oddness" to unlock instability-driven wave phenomena provides a powerful new route to creating tunable materials for filtering, guiding, and controlling mechanical waves.

Title: Strain-tunable anomalous Hall effect in hexagonal MnTe
Authors: Zhaoyu Liu, Sijie Xu, Jonathan M. DeStefano, Elliott Rosenberg, Tingjun Zhang, Jinyulin Li, Matthew B. Stone, Feng Ye, Rong Cong, Siyu Pan, Ching-Wu Chu, Liangzi Deng, Emilia Morosan, Jiun-Haw Chu, Pengcheng Dai
Abstract: The ability to control and manipulate time-reversal ($T$) symmetry-breaking phases with near-zero net magnetization is a sought-after goal in spintronic devices. The recently discovered hexagonal altermagnet manganese telluride ($\alpha$-MnTe) is a prime example. It has a compensated $A$-type antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state where the in-plane ferromagnetic (FM) moments in each layer are stacked antiferromagnetically along the $c$ axis, yet exhibits a spontaneous anomalous Hall effect (AHE) that breaks the $T$-symmetry with a vanishingly small $c$-axis FM moment. However, the presence of three 120$^\circ$ separated in-plane magnetic domains presents a challenge in understanding the origin of AHE and the effective control of the altermagnetic state. Here we use neutron scattering to show that a compressive uniaxial strain along the next-nearest-neighbor Mn-Mn bond direction detwins $\alpha$-MnTe into a single in-plane magnetic domain, aligning the in-plane moments along the same direction. Furthermore, we find that uniaxial strain (-0.2% to 0.1%) significantly sharpens the magnetic hysteresis loop and switches the sign of the AHE near room temperature. Remarkably, this is achieved without altering the AFM phase-transition temperature, which can only be explained by a strain-induced modification of the electronic band structure. Our work not only unambiguously establishes the relationship between the in-plane moment direction and the AHE in $\alpha$-MnTe but also paves the way for future applications in highly scalable, strain-tunable magnetic sensors and spintronic devices.

Title: Nonlinear Response Relations and Fluctuation-Response Inequalities for Nonequilibrium Stochastic Systems
Authors: Jiming Zheng, Zhiyue Lu
Abstract: Predicting how systems respond to external perturbations far from equilibrium remains a fundamental challenge across physics, chemistry, and biology. We present a unified response framework for stochastic Markov dynamics that integrates linear and nonlinear perturbations. Our formalism expresses nonlinear responses of observables in terms of the covariance between the observable and a nonlinear conjugate variable. The nonlinear conjugate variable is subject to the complete Bell polynomial form and is determined by the stochastic entropy production. In addition, the Fluctuation-Response Inequalities (FRIs) are also derived for nonlinear responses, unraveling the general trade-off relations between nonlinear response and systems' fluctuations far from equilibrium. The validity of our theory is verified by the numerical results from a symmetric exclusion process (SEP). By unifying and extending nonequilibrium linear response theories, our approach can provide principled design rules for sensitive, adaptive synthetic and biological networks.

Title: Knight shift measurements probing Fermi surface changes under pressure in CeRhIn$_5$
Authors: Y.-H. Nian, C. Chaffey, P. Sherpa, L. Santillan, K. Nagashima, Peter Klavins, V. Taufour, N. J. Curro
Abstract: We report nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) Knight shift measurements of the In(1) and In(2) sites in CeRhIn$_5$ as a function of pressure. In contrast to the $c$ axis, the in-plane components of the In(1) Knight shift tensor exhibit little to no pressure dependence. These results indicate that the dipolar component of the tensor is strongly suppressed at the In(1) site, while it remains constant with pressure at the In(2) site. We analyze the hyperfine coupling in terms of a tight binding model for the electronic structure, and determine that the pressure dependence of the In(1) shift cannot be explained in terms of changes to the crystal field parameters, but rather can be understood in terms of an increase in the 4f electron content at the Fermi surface. Our results indicate that the hyperfine coupling reflects changes in the electronic structure near a Kondo breakdown quantum critical point.

Title: Quantum criticality in cuprate superconductors revealed by optical conductivity measurement
Authors: Hwiwoo Park, Sung-Sik Lee, G. D. Gu, Jungseek Hwang
Abstract: The ubiquitous temperature ($T$)-linear behaviour of the transport scattering rate in the normal state of strongly correlated electron systems is called strange metallicity \cite{zaanen:2004,phillips:2022,hartnoll:2022,chowdhury:2022,yuan:2022}. Although strange metallicity is crucial to understanding superconductivity in correlated electron systems, its origin remains elusive to date \cite{hussey:2023}. Here, we present the doping-, temperature-, and frequency ($\omega$)-dependent transport properties of overdoped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ in a wide doping range of 0.183 to 0.231. We observe that the optical scattering rate and effective mass exhibit an $\omega/T$ scaling behaviour at a critical doping of $p_{c} \simeq$ 0.231. Away from the critical doping, the $\omega/T$ scaling behaviour is destroyed below a doping-dependent crossover temperature $T_\Delta(p) \sim |p-p_{c}|^{0.24}$. Furthermore, the optical coherence mode (OCM) observed within the superconducting dome rapidly broadens and eventually disappears as the critical doping is approached. The emergence of the $\omega/T$ scaling behaviour of the transport scattering rate and broadening of the OCM near the critical doping strongly suggests that strange metallic behaviour is caused by quantum critical fluctuations. Our results provide compelling spectroscopic evidence for quantum criticality in cuprate superconductors.

Title: Hybridization gap and $f$-electron effect evolutions with Cd- and Sn-doping in CeCoIn$_5$ via infrared spectroscopy
Authors: Myounghoon Lee, Yu-Seong Seo, Seulki Roh, Seokbae Lee, Jihyun Kim, Tuson Park, Jungseek Hwang
Abstract: We investigated hole (Cd)- and electron (Sn)-doped CeCoIn$_5$ (CeCo(In$_{1-x}T_x$)$_5$ ($T$ = Cd or Sn)) using infrared spectroscopy. Doping-dependent hybridization gap distribution functions were obtained from the optical conductivity spectra based on the periodic Anderson model formalism. The hybridization gap distribution exhibits two components: in-plane and out-of-plane hybridization gaps. The doping-dependent evolution of the two gaps indicated that the out-of-plane gap was more sensitive to doping. Furthermore, the magnetic optical resistivity exhibited a doping-dependent evolution of the $f$-electron amplitude. The two dopant types exhibited different physical properties depending on the level of doping. The Sn dopant increases the $f$-electron amplitude, whereas the Cd dopant does not affect the $f$-electron amplitude. Doping-dependent effective mass is peaked at pure (or undoped) CeCoIn$_5$. Our spectroscopic results may help understand the doping-dependent electronic evolution of one of the canonical heavy fermion systems, CeCoIn$_5$.

Title: Roles of Fe-ion irradiation on MgB$_2$ thin films: Structural, superconducting, and optical properties
Authors: Dzung T. Tran, Tien Le, Yu-Seong Seo, Duc H. Tran, Tuson Park, Soon-Gil Jung, T. Miyanaga, Chorong Kim, Sunmog Yeo, Won Nam Kang, Jungseek Hwang
Abstract: The effects of Fe-ion irradiation on the crystal structure and superconducting properties of MgB$_2$ thin films were investigated. Pristine samples were prepared using hybrid physical-chemical vapor deposition (HPCVD), and ion irradiation was performed at three different doses of 5 x 10$^{13}$, 1 x 10$^{14}$, and 2 x 10$^{14}$ ions/cm$^2$. The measured temperature-dependent resistivity showed that as the irradiation dose increased from pristine to most irradiated, the superconducting critical temperature, $T_c$, significantly decreased from 38.33 to 3.02 K. The crystal structures of the films were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements. The results showed that the higher the dose, the greater the change in crystal structure, such as the lattice constant and bond length. This suggests that the destruction of the crystal structure at higher doses leads to the degradation of superconductivity in the irradiated MgB$_2$ thin films. Raman spectroscopy showed that the electron-phonon coupling constant decreased with increasing irradiation dose, which was directly related to the reduction of $T_c$ in the samples. The optical conductivity indicates that the charge-carrier density of the $\sigma$-band plays an important role in the superconductivity of ion-irradiated MgB$_2$.

Title: Holographic Aspects of Dynamical Mean-Field Theory
Authors: Kouichi Okunishi, Akihisa Koga
Abstract: Dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) is one of the most standard theoretical frameworks for addressing strongly correlated electron systems. Meanwhile, the concept of holography, developed in the field of quantum gravity, provides an intrinsic relationship between quantum many-body systems and space-time geometry. In this study, we demonstrate that these two theories are closely related to each other by shedding light on holographic aspects of DMFT, particularly for electrons with a semicircle density of states. We formulate a holographic renormalization group for the branch Green's function from the outer edge to the interior of the Bethe lattice network, and then find that its fixed point can be interpreted as a self-consistent solution of Green's function in DMFT. By introducing an effective two-dimensional anti-de Sitter space, moreover, we clarify that the scaling dimensions for the branch Green's function and the boundary correlation functions of electrons at the outer edge of the Bethe lattice network are characterized by the fixed-point Green's function. We also perform DMFT computations for the Bethe-lattice Hubbard model, which illustrate that the scaling dimensions capture the Mott transition in the deep interior.

Title: Harmonic and Subharmonic Magnon Generation in a Surface Acoustic Wave Resonator
Authors: Yunyoung Hwang, Liyang Liao, Jorge Puebla, Marco Brühlmann, Carlos Gonzalez-Ballestero, Kouta Kondou, Naoki Ogawa, Sadamichi Maekawa, Yoshichika Otani
Abstract: We experimentally observe the generation of magnon harmonics and subharmonics in an on-chip surface acoustic wave resonator incorporating a thin Co$_{20}$Fe$_{60}$B$_{20}$ film, using micro-focused Brillouin light scattering. In our devices, rotating the in-plane magnetic field allows continuous tuning of the magnon-phonon coupling from weak to strong within the same resonator. In the weak coupling regime, we only observe fundamental magnetoelastic wave signal at $f_{1}$. Conversely, in the strong coupling regime, in addition to the fundamental magnetoelastic wave, we observe subharmonic and harmonic signals at $3/2f_{1}$, $2f_{1}$, and $3f_{1}$, which are well reproduced by our analytical model. Our results establish phonons as a means to generate and control nonlinear magnons in the strong coupling regime, providing a new route for magnonic signal processing.

Title: Projective crystal symmetry and topological phases
Authors: Chen Zhang, Shengyuan A. Yang, Y. X. Zhao
Abstract: Quantum states naturally represent symmetry groups, though often in a projective sense. Intriguingly, the projective nature of crystalline symmetries has remained underexplored until very recently. A series of groundbreaking theoretical and experimental studies have now brought this to light, demonstrating that projective representations of crystal symmetries lead to remarkable consequences in condensed matter physics and various artificial crystals, particularly in their connection to topological phenomena. In this article, we explain the basic ideas and notions underpinning these recent developments and share our perspective on this emerging research area. We specifically highlight that the appearance of momentum-space nonsymmorphic symmetry is a unique feature of projective crystal symmetry representations. This, in turn, has the profound consequence of reducing the fundamental domain of momentum space to all possible flat compact manifolds, which include torus and Klein bottle in 2D and the ten platycosms in 3D, presenting a significantly richer landscape for topological structures than conventional settings. Finally, the ongoing efforts and promising future research directions are discussed.

Title: Domain wall skyrmion-based magnonic crystal
Authors: Zhenyu Wang, Xingen Zheng, Zhixiong Li, Zhizhi Zhang, Xiansi Wang
Abstract: Magnonic waveguide based on domain wall (DW) is considered as a crucial breakthrough toward the realization of magnonic nanocircuits. However, the effective control of spin waves propagating in DWs remains to be explored. Here, we construct a magnonic crystal (MC) by using a chain of the domain wall skyrmions (DWSKs) to manipulate the spin-wave propagation in DWs. We show that the DWSK chain can be created by leveraging voltage-controlled Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. The DWSK-based MC opens magnonic bandgaps, which can be dynamically adjusted through magnetic fields modulating the DWSK size. Furthermore, the manipulation of spin waves by the DWSK-based MC maintains robust in curved DW, demonstrating its adaptability to complex device architectures. Our work provides an effective method to control the spin-wave propagation in DWs and paves the way for designing energy-efficient magnonic nanocircuits.

Title: A General Many-Body Perturbation Framework for Moiré Systems: Application to Rhombohedral Pentalayer Graphene/hBN Heterostructures
Authors: Xin Lu, Yuanfan Yang, Zhongqing Guo, Jianpeng Liu
Abstract: Moiré superlattices host a rich variety of correlated topological states, including interaction-driven integer and fractional Chern insulators. A common approach to study interacting ground states at integer fillings is the Hartree-Fock mean-field method. However, this method neglects dynamical correlations, which often leads to an overestimation of spontaneous symmetry breaking and fails to provide quantitative descriptions of single-particle excitations. This work introduces a general many-body perturbation framework for moiré systems, combining all-band Hartree-Fock calculations with random phase approximation (RPA) correlation energies and $GW$ quasiparticle corrections. We apply this framework to moiré superlattice consisted of rhombohedral pentalayer graphene aligned with hexagonal boron nitride. Our all-band Hartree-Fock calculations, which include all plane-wave components up to the high-energy cutoff of the continuum model, reveal a phase diagram at moiré filling $\nu=1$ that qualitatively aligns with experimental measurements. Incorporating RPA correlation energy further yields quantitative agreement with the evolution of transport properties across electric fields. The $GW$ quasiparticle bands exhibit significantly reduced gaps and bandwidths compared to Hartree-Fock results, while quasiparticle weights close to unity indicate that the ground state is well-described by a Slater determinant, justifying the qualitative effectiveness of mean-field approaches for integer fillings in this system. Our versatile framework provides a systematic beyond-mean-field approach applicable to generic moiré systems.

Title: Grand thermodynamic potential in a two-band unconventional superconductor
Authors: V. A. Shestakov, M. M. Korshunov
Abstract: In a two-band system, both conventional sign-preserving $s_{++}$ and unconventional sign-changing $s_{\pm}$ superconducting state may appear at low temperatures. Moreover, they may transform from one to another due to the impurity scattering. To study the details of such a transition here we derive the expression for the Grand thermodynamic potential $\Omega$ for a two-band model with nonmagnetic impurities considered in a $\mathcal{T}$-matrix approximation. For the iron-based materials within the multiband Eliashberg theory, we show that the $s_{\pm} \to s_{++}$ transition in the vicinity of the Born limit is a first order phase transition.

Title: Intrinsic defect intolerance in the ultra-pure metal PtSn$_4$
Authors: Samikshya Sahu, Dong Chen, Niclas Heinsdorf, Ashley N. Warner, Markus Altthaler, Ashutosh K. Singh, Douglas A. Bonn, Sarah A. Burke, Alannah M. Hallas
Abstract: Ultra-pure materials are highly valued as model systems for the study of intrinsic physics. Frequently, however, the crystal growth of such pristine samples requires significant optimization. PtSn$_4$ is a rare example of a material that naturally forms with a very low concentration of crystalline defects. Here, we investigate the origin of its low defect levels using a combination of electrical resistivity measurements, computational modeling, and scanning tunneling microscopy imaging. While typical flux-grown crystals of PtSn$_4$ can have residual resistivity ratios (RRRs) that can exceed 1000, we show that even at the most extreme formation speeds, the RRR cannot be suppressed below 100. This aversion to defect formation extends to both the Pt and Sn sublattices, which contribute with equal weight to the conduction properties. Direct local imaging with scanning tunneling microscopy further substantiates the rarity of point defects, while the prohibitive energetic cost of forming a defect is demonstrated through density functional theory calculations. Taken together, our results establish PtSn$_4$ as an intrinsically defect-intolerant material, making it an ideal platform to study other properties of interest, including extreme magnetoresistance and topology.

Title: The orbital-driven topological phase transition and planar Hall responses in ternary tellurides Weyl semi-metals
Authors: Banasree Sadhukhan, Tanay Nag
Abstract: Here we study electronic properties of the ternary tellurides TaXTe$_4$ (X=Rh, Ir) using density functional theory and investigate chiral anomaly mediated planar Hall response from ab initio calculations. We show that TaRhTe$_4$ is a hybrid Weyl semimetal (WSM), hosting Weyl points (WPs) of both type-I, type-II, while TaIrTe$_4$ is a type-II WSM as it hosts only type-II WPs with spin-orbit couplings (SOC). All WPs lie in the $k_z=0$ plane, and remain well-separated in both momentum and energy landscape. We observe long Fermi arcs connecting Weyl nodes of opposite chirality. We report both SOC and orbital driven topological phase transition in ternary tellurides. TaIrTe$_4$ undergoes topological phase transition under SOC. Whereas orbital driven topological phase transition due to d$_{xz}$ orbital has been observed in TaRhTe$_4$ even without SOC. Furthermore, the evolution of the band structures and the annihilation of WPs due to d$_{xz}$-Ir/Rh orbitals associated with the phase transitions in TaXTe$_4$ are also discussed. This systematic study opens new routes for engineering topological materials relying beyond strong SOC and sheds light on the possible role of correlation effects originating from orbital orbital degree of freedoms in tellurides. We further report an enhancement of planar Hall effects due to orbital driven topological phase transition in TaXTe$_4$ and we make resort to a tight-binding model to correlate the above findings with the effective mass anisotropy in different types of WSMs.

Title: $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant in three-dimensional PT- and PC-symmetric class CI band structures
Authors: Ken Shiozaki
Abstract: We construct a previously missing $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant for three-dimensional band structures in symmetry class CI defined by parity-time (PT) and parity-particle-hole (PC) symmetries. PT symmetry allows one to define a real Berry connection and, based on the $\eta$-invariant, a spin-Chern--Simons (spin-CS) action. We show that PC symmetry quantizes the spin-CS action to $\{0,2\pi\}$ with $4\pi$ periodicity, thereby yielding a well-defined $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant. This invariant is additive under direct sums of isolated band structures, reduces to a known $\mathbb{Z}_2$ index when a global Takagi factorization exists, and in general depends on the choice of spin structure. Finally, we demonstrate lattice models in which this newly introduced $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant distinguishes topological phases that cannot be detected by the previously known topological indices.

Title: Gauge invariance and hyperforce correlation theory for equilibrium fluid mixtures
Authors: Joshua Matthes, Silas Robitschko, Johanna Müller, Sophie Hermann, Florian Sammüller, Matthias Schmidt
Abstract: We formulate gauge invariance for the equilibrium statistical mechanics of classical multi-component systems. Species-resolved phase space shifting constitutes a gauge transformation which we analyze using Noether's theorem and shifting differential operators that encapsulate the gauge invariance. The approach yields exact equilibrium sum rules for general mixtures. Species-resolved gauge correlation functions for the force-force and force-gradient pair correlation structure emerge on the two-body level. Exact 3g-sum rules relate these correlation functions to the spatial Hessian of the partial pair distribution functions. General observables are associated with hyperforce densities that measure the covariance of the given observable with the interparticle, external, and diffusive partial force density observables. Exact hyperforce and Lie algebra sum rules interrelate these correlation functions with each other. The practical accessibility of the framework is demonstrated for binary Lennard-Jones mixtures using both adaptive Brownian dynamics and grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations. Specifically, we investigate the force-force pair correlation structure of the Kob-Andersen bulk liquid and we show results for representative hyperforce correlation functions in Wilding et al.'s symmetrical mixture confined between two asymmetric planar parallel walls.

Title: Building cluster systems
Authors: Naïmo Davier
Abstract: Classical spin liquids are frustrated magnetic phases characterized by local constraints, flat bands in reciprocal space, and emergent gauge structures with distinctive signatures such as pinch points. These arise generally in \emph{cluster systems}, where spin interactions can be expressed as constraints on clusters of spins. In this work we present the different generic rules allowing to build such cluster systems together with a few tools allowing to quickly characterize it. We show that based on these rules, it is possible to conceive a tunable recipe for generating such models by decorating a parent lattice on its bonds and/or vertices with symmetry-compatible clusters. This approach highlights a key design trade-off: using fewer cluster types increases the number of flat bands and enhances spin-liquid behavior, but produces denser connectivity that is harder to realize experimentally. The framework is highly tunable, extends naturally to two and three dimensions, and provides a versatile toolbox for engineering new classical spin-liquid candidates with targeted features such as higher-rank pinch points or pinch lines.

Title: Ab initio investigation on structural stability and phonon-mediated superconductivity in 2D-hydrogenated M2X (M= Mo, V, Zr; X=C, N) MXene monolayer
Authors: Jakkapat Seeyangnok, Udomsilp Pinsook
Abstract: We present a comprehensive first-principles study of hydrogenated M2X (M = Mo, V, Zr; X = C, N) MXene monolayers, focusing on their structural stability, electronic properties, and superconducting behavior. Structural optimizations combined with phonon spectra reveal that partial hydrogenation (1H and 2H) is dynamically stable across most compositions, while full hydrogenation (4H) generally induces lattice instabilities. A notable exception is Zr2CH4, which retains dynamical stability even under maximum hydrogen coverage. Electronic structure analysis shows that all hydrogenated MXenes remain metallic, with the Fermi level dominated by transition-metal d orbitals. In Zr2CH4, a Dirac-like band crossing at the Fermi level is observed, which is gapped by spin-orbit coupling (SOC), yielding a finite gap of 0.095 eV. Electron-phonon coupling (EPC) calculations demonstrate that Mo-based MXenes exhibit strong EPC, with coupling constants lambda = 0.95 (Mo2CH), 1.23 (Mo2NH), and 1.55 (Mo2NH2), corresponding to superconducting critical temperatures Tc about 15 to 22 K within the Allen-Dynes framework (mu* = 0.10). By contrast, V- and Zr-based MXenes display weak EPC and negligible Tc, with Zr2CH4 being a special case hosting Dirac-like states rather than superconductivity. Our findings highlight hydrogen functionalization as an effective strategy to stabilize MXene monolayers and to tune their low-energy physics, revealing Mo-based nitride MXenes as promising phonon-mediated superconductors, while Zr2CH4 emerges as a candidate for Dirac physics.

Title: Theoretical prediction of Structural Stability and Superconductivity in Janus Ti2CSH MXene
Authors: Jakkapat Seeyangnok, Udomsilp Pinsook
Abstract: We present a comprehensive first-principles investigation of the structural stability, vibrational characteristics, and superconducting properties of the Janus Ti2CSH monolayer. Janus MXene (JMXene) materials, such as Ti2CSH, have attracted significant attention due to their intrinsic two-dimensional structure and the absence of out-of-plane symmetry, which give rise to novel physical phenomena. Phonon calculations confirm the dynamical stability of the monolayer, while electronic structure and electron-phonon coupling analyses reveal a strong phonon-mediated pairing mechanism. Anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg theory predicts a single-gap superconducting state, with gap values between 4.29 and 4.71 meV at 10 K and a critical temperature Tc of 22.6 K. These findings establish Ti2CSH as a promising two-dimensional superconductor with potential applications in quantum and nanoscale technologies.

Title: Phase Stability and Superconductivity in Hydrogenated and Lithiated Janus GaXS2 (X = Ga, In) Monolayers
Authors: Jakkapat Seeyangnok, Udomsilp Pinsook
Abstract: Hydrogen and lithium functionalization of two-dimensional (2D) materials offers a promising route to enhance electronic properties and induce superconductivity. Here, we employ first-principles calculations to explore the phase stability and superconducting behavior of hydrogenated and lithiated Janus GaXS2 (X = Ga, In) monolayers. Among Ga2SH, Ga2SLi, GaInSH, and GaInSLi, only the 2H-GaInSLi structure is dynamically, thermally, and mechanically stable, as confirmed by phonon dispersion, ab initio molecular dynamics, and elastic constants. This monolayer adopts a hexagonal lattice, exhibits metallic behavior, and has a negative formation energy, suggesting experimental feasibility. Anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg analysis reveals phonon-mediated superconductivity with a critical temperature Tc of 4.8 K. Notably, three distinct superconducting gaps emerge, linked to specific atomic orbitals and phonon modes. Electron doping of 0.2 e per cell increases Tc to nearly 6.2 K while maintaining the three-gap character. These results highlight the effectiveness of selective functionalization in engineering superconductivity and identify GaInSLi as a promising platform for next-generation multi-gap 2D superconducting devices.

Title: Exploration of Altermagnetism in $\mathrm{RuO_{2}}$
Authors: Yu-Xin Li, Yiyuan Chen, Liqing Pan, Shuai Li, Song-Bo Zhang, Hai-Zhou Lu
Abstract: The fundamental role of magnetic materials in modern science and technology has driven a rapid surge in research on unconventional magnetism in recent years. In particular, altermagnets, which simultaneously exhibit zero net magnetization in real space and anisotropic spin splitting in momentum space, have garnered significant interest for both fundamental physics and technological applications. Among these, $\mathrm{RuO_{2}}$ stands as the pioneering and most extensively studied altermagnet. While the intrinsic magnetic order of $\mathrm{RuO_{2}}$ is still a subject of active debate, numerous exotic phenomena characteristic of altermagnetism have been observed in $\mathrm{RuO_{2}}$ samples. In this review, we explore each facet of the altermagnetism through specific case studies in $\mathrm{RuO_{2}}$, systematically surveying its crystal and magnetic structures, electronic band properties, and transport phenomena. We critically assess the debate surrounding the intrinsic magnetism in $\mathrm{RuO_{2}}$, incorporating evidence from altermagnetic signatures in transport, as well as contrasting results from magnetic and spectroscopic measurements. Finally, possible future research directions in this field are discussed.

Title: Smart copolymer microgels with high volume phase transition temperature: Composition, swelling, and morphology
Authors: Aditi Gujare, Stefanie Uredat, Jonas Runge, Felix Morgenstern, Domenico Truzzolillo, Thomas Hellweg, Julian Oberdisse
Abstract: The thermosensitivity and microstructure of microgels made by copolymerizing standard microgel-forming monomers with more hydrophilic comonomers is investigated, with the aim of increasing the volume phase transition temperature (VPTT). We precisely determine the incorporation of N-(hydroxymethyl)acrylamide (HMAM) and purpose-synthesized N-(2-hydroxyisopropyl)acrylamide (HIPAM) into microgels -- neither of which forms microgels on its own by precipitation polymerization. The swelling properties and microstructure of the resulting copolymer microgels with N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM, LCST ca. 32°C) and N-isopropylmethacrylamide (NIPMAM, LCST ca. 44°C) are then characterized via turbidimetry, DLS, and AFM. At low comonomer contents, all microgel particles exhibit moderate growth in size. Beyond a system-specific threshold, we observe a significant jump in size, and smoother swelling behavior. For NIPAM-HIPAM, the size increase is linked to a strong rise in swelling capacity, and the formation of a thick corona. The effect of the hydrophilic comonomers on the VPTT correlates linearly with their true composition, allowing us to extrapolate the VPTT of hypothetical pure HMAM and HIPAM microgels. This leads to 99°C for HMAM, and 68°C for HIPAM for the respective VPTT. These numbers can be seen as useful indicators of the effect of these monomers on the VPTT in the copolymerized microgels. The observed changes in VPTT, swelling, size, and morphology suggest that high-VPTT microgels possess unique internal molecular composition gradients, likely due to hydrophobic interactions during synthesis. Our results have potential implications for developing temperature-sensitive microgel-based membranes that can self-adapt their permeability at higher operating temperatures in energy applications.

Title: Type-II Band Alignment in the $β$-Ga$_2$O$_3$/Rutile GeO$_2$ Heterojunction toward Solar-Blind Photodetection: A first-principles study
Authors: D. Q. Fang
Abstract: Semiconductor heterostructures capable of separating photogenerated electrons and holes have a wide range of optoelectronic applications, including photodetectors, solar cells, and photocatalysts. ${\beta}$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ and rutile GeO$_2$ are both ultrawide-bandgap semiconductors, with bandgaps of 4.85 eV and 4.68 eV, respectively. In this work, we employ first-principles calculations based on density functional theory to investigate the band alignment of the ${\beta}$-Ga$_2$O$_3$/rutile GeO$_2$ heterojunction and explore the effect of interfacial oxygen vacancy. Calculations using the PBE0 hybrid functional based on an interface model show that a type-II band alignment emerges at the ${\beta}$-Ga$_2$O$_3$/rutile GeO$_2$ interface, which facilitates the separation of photogenerated carriers. The valence band maximum of ${\beta}$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ lies 0.38 eV below that of rutile GeO$_2$, and its conduction band minimum lies 0.36 eV below. The presence of interfacial oxygen vacancy in the stable configuration leads to a reduction in the band offset. Our results suggest that the ${\beta}$-Ga$_2$O$_3$/rutile GeO$_2$ heterojunction holds significant promise for application in strictly solar-blind photodetectors.

Title: Accurate prediction of optical transitions in epitaxial InGaAs/InAlAs asymmetric coupled quantum well structures
Authors: Konstantinos Pantzas, Virginie Trinité, Angel Vasanelli, Carlo Sirtori, Grégoire Beaudoin, Isabelle Sagnes, Jean-Luc Reverchon, Gilles Patriarche
Abstract: Atomically-resolved Z-contrast and strain mappings are used to extract a model of the composition of an InGaAs/InAlAs asymmetric coupled quantum-well structure grown on InP using metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy. The model accounts for grading across the multiple alloy interfaces. The model is used to compute intersubband absorption in the structure. The simulation accurately predicts the experimental absorption spectrum of the structure within only a few meV, an almost ten-fold improvement over simulations using a square-band profile with nominal alloy compositions, and a significant step forward in accurate and predictive simulations of the optical properties epitaxial heterostructures for emission, modulation and detection in mid-infrared.

Title: Efficient Grand Canonical Global Optimization with On-the-fly-trained Machine-learning Interatomic Potentials
Authors: Jon Eunan Quinlivan Dominguez, Mads-Peter Verner Christiansen, Konstantin M. Neyman, Bøjrk Hammer, Albert Bruix
Abstract: The characterization of nanostructued materials under reactive environments is challenging due to the complexity of the structural motifs involved and their chemical transformations. Global optimization approaches allow predicting stable structures for targeted materials but addressing the configurational and compositional search spaces is both computationally demanding and inefficient, especially when first principles calculations are required. In this work, we implement and evaluate a computationally efficient grand canonical global optimization algorithm able to identify stable structures and chemical states of targeted systems under given reaction conditions (e.g. reactant pressure and temperature). The algorithm leverages an on-the-fly trained machine-learning interatomic potential based on sparse Gaussian Process Regression and the smooth overlap of atomic positions descriptor to reduce the number of first principles energy evaluations carried out during global optimization searches. The \textit{ab initio} thermodynamics framework is incorporated to approximate the Gibbs energy of evaluated candidates, performing environment-aware optimizations over multiple stoichiometries. We demonstrate the computational performance of this approach and its ability to reproduce some literature examples.

Title: High pressure lattice dynamics study of few layer-$α$-In$_2$Se$_3$
Authors: Shiyu Feng, Anurag Ghosh, Gautham Vijayan, Ziyi Xu, Qian Zhang, Elad Koren, Elissaios Stavrou
Abstract: Few-layer $\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$ has been studied under pressure using Raman spectroscopy in a diamond anvil cell up to 60 GPa (at room temperature). A combination of AFM and Raman was used to estimate the thickness of the specimens. While few-layer $\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$ shows identical structural evolution with the one of the bulk powder-like form of $\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$ ( $\alpha$ $\rightarrow$ $\beta^{'}$ $\rightarrow$ IV ), an abrupt $\beta^{'}$ $\rightarrow$ IV phase transition (at 45 GPa) was observed, in contrast with the case of the bulk specimen where the two phases coexist over a wide pressure range. This is attributed to the difference in specimens morphology, $i.e.$ single crystal and powder in the case of few-layer and bulk $\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$, respectively. This study documents the significance of specimens morphology on the observed pressure-induced phase transitions. The methodology developed in this study for performing high-pressure Raman measurements can be applied to other nanodimensional layered materials.

Title: Dynamic self-assembly of active particle systems controlled by light fields
Authors: Sihang Guo, Guangyu Yang, Guoqing Meng, Yingying Wang, Junxing Pan, Jinjun Zhang
Abstract: Active particle systems are a class of non-equilibrium systems composed of self-propelled Brownian particles; through interactions between particles within the system, a variety of intriguing collective behaviors can emerge. Based on Brownian dynamics simulations, this study investigates the formation and transition mechanisms of ordered structures in active particle systems regulated by light fields. The study reveals that, under light field regulation, active particles undergo large-scale phase separation behavior, forming specific ordered structures and enabling the dynamic transition between multiple ordered structures. This study systematically explores the effects of light fields on this dynamic phase transition and the corresponding regulatory mechanisms. The research findings provide important references for the precise regulation of collective structures in active systems and the fabrication of micro-nano intelligent devices.

Title: Non-ohmic to ohmic crossover in the breakdown of the quantum Hall states in graphene under broadband excitations
Authors: Torsten Röper, Aifei Zhang, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Olivier Maillet, François D. Parmentier, Erwann Bocquillon
Abstract: Graphene, through the coexistence of large cyclotron gaps and small spin and valley gaps, offers the possibility to study the breakdown of the quantum Hall effect across a wide range of energy scales. In this work, we investigate the breakdown of the QHE in high-mobility graphene Corbino devices under broadband excitation ranging from DC up to 10 GHz. We find that the conductance is consistently described by variable range hopping (VRH) and extract the hopping energies from both temperature and field-driven measurements. Using VRH thermometry, we are able to distinguish between a cold and hot electron regime, which are dominated by non-ohmic VRH and Joule heating, respectively. Our results demonstrate that breakdown in the quantum Hall regime of graphene is governed by a crossover from non-ohmic, field-driven VRH to ohmic, Joule-heating-dominated transport.

Title: Breakdown of symmetry constraint in Floquet topological superconductor
Authors: Ming-Jian Gao, Jun-Hong An
Abstract: Topological superconductor is regarded as an ideal candidate for topological quantum computing due to its ability to simulate the enigmatic Majorana fermions that satisfy non-Abelian statistics. Previous studies revealed that symmetry exerts an unbreakable constraint on the existence, classes, and orders of Majorana modes. It severely limits the controllability and application of Majorana modes. Here, we propose a Floquet-engineering method to break this symmetry-imposed constraint on topological phases. By applying periodic driving on a system belonging to a symmetry class that prohibits the existence of first-order topological phases, we find that rich first-order Majorana modes are created. Interestingly, exotic hybrid-order topological superconductors with coexisting first-order Majorana boundary modes and second-order Majorana corner modes not only in two different quasienergy gaps but also in one single gap are generated at ease by the periodic driving. Refreshing the prevailing understanding of symmetry constraint on topological phases, our result opens an avenue for the creation of exotic topological superconductors without altering symmetries. It greatly expands the scope of the fabricated materials that host topological superconductor.

Title: Living Droplets with Mesoscale Swimmers
Authors: L. Malik, N. Sharadhi, M. Lamminmäki, R. A. Lara, V. Jokinen, M. Backholm
Abstract: We study the activity of "living" droplets, which confine 1-6 mesoswimmers in 3D using a superhydrophobic substrate. The swimmers induce oscillations of the droplets at their inherent resonant frequencies, regardless of swimmer size and number. In contrast, the droplet oscillation amplitude is strongly affected by crowding, which we successfully model with a new scaling law and show that crowding reduces the speed of the swimmers. These fundamental living matter physics results reveal mechanisms for bio-inspired droplet actuation with implications for mesoscale robotics, fluidics, and sensing.

Title: A Universal Framework for Controlling Non-Relativistic Spin Splitting
Authors: Aniruddha Ray, Subhadeep Bandyopadhyay, Sayantika Bhowal
Abstract: Non-relativistic spin splitting in antiferromagnets has recently attracted considerable attention. Here we present a universal framework for controlling such spin splitting by identifying and manipulating the key atomic distortions that govern it through external perturbations. We demonstrate this concept by tuning the spin-splitting energy in three representative materials with diverse symmetries, inversion-symmetric MnF$_2$, ferroelectric BaCuF$_4$, and LaMnO$_3$/RMnO$_3$ superlattices. Our results emphasize the essential role of higher-order magnetic multipoles and the intrinsic structure-spin correlations in these systems, thereby advancing current efforts to control spin splitting in real materials and motivating future experimental studies.

Title: Generalized Li-Haldane Correspondence in Critical Free-Fermion Systems
Authors: Yuxuan Guo, Sheng Yang, Xue-Jia Yu
Abstract: Topological phenomena in quantum critical systems have recently attracted growing attention, as they go beyond the traditional paradigms of condensed matter and statistical physics. However, a general framework for identifying such nontrivial phenomena, particularly in higher-dimensional systems, remains insufficiently explored. In this Letter, we propose a universal fingerprint for detecting nontrivial topology in critical free-fermion systems protected by global on-site symmetries. Specifically, we analytically establish an exact relation between the bulk entanglement spectrum and the boundary energy spectrum at topological criticality in arbitrary dimensions, demonstrating that the degeneracy of edge modes can be extracted from the bulk entanglement spectrum. These findings, further supported by numerical simulations of lattice models, provide a universal fingerprint for identifying nontrivial topology in critical free-fermion systems.

Title: Resistive switching behaviors in vertically aligned MoS$_2$ films with Cu, Ag, and Au electrodes
Authors: Shuei-De Huang, Touko Lehenkari, Topias Järvinen, Seyed Hossein Hosseini-Shokouh, Farzaneh Bouzari, Krisztian Kordas, Hannu-Pekka Komsa
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing circuits can be realized using memristors based on low-dimensional materials enabling enhanced metal diffusion for resistive switching. Here, we investigate memristive properties of vertically aligned MoS$_2$ (VA-MoS$_2$) films with three different metal electrodes: Ag, Cu, and Au. Despite having the same active material, all three metals show distinct switching behavior, which are crucial for neuromorphic computing applications: Ag enables volatile switching, Cu demonstrates stable non-volatile switching with retention over 2500 s, and Au shows no memristive response. Cu devices show abrupt resistance changes, and significant increase of copper content upon biasing, indicative of stable non-volatile switching based on filament formation and rupture. About 85% of Ag and Cu devices exhibit reliable memristor behavior. Our findings provide valuable insights into the memristive switching mechanism in VA-MoS$_2$ and present a promising avenue for facile fabrication of neuromorphic circuits by employing a set of different metals on a single active material.

Title: Glassy dynamics in two-dimensional ring polymers: size versus stiffness polydispersity
Authors: Rahul Nayak, Pinaki Chaudhuri, Satyavani Vemparala
Abstract: Soft glassy materials often consist of deformable objects. Here, we use a two-dimensional assembly of semi-flexible ring polymers as a model system to investigate how polydispersity in particle stiffness or size influences the onset of glassy dynamics. In simulations at fixed polydispersity 30%, we find that stiffness dispersity drives most rings into elongated conformations at high densities, leading to orientationally ordered structures that cause dynamical slowing down. In contrast, size dispersity generates a bimodal population: small rings remain circular and act as rigid inclusions, while large rings elongate, producing frustration that delays arrest. Real-space maps of bond relaxation reveal strikingly different pathways of dynamical heterogeneity, with long-lived domains persisting under stiffness dispersity but rapidly percolating relaxation under size dispersity. Moreover, local correlations between ring shape, orientational order, and mobility show that stiffness dispersity produces dynamics that are strongly structure-sensitive, whereas size dispersity activates motion from both circular and elongated populations. By linking microscopic deformability to emergent glassy dynamics, this study identifies how the nature of polydispersity controls the relaxation pathways of soft glasses.

Title: Hierarchy of timescales in a disordered spin-$1/2$ XX ladder
Authors: Kadir Çeven, Lukas Peinemann, Fabian Heidrich-Meisner
Abstract: Understanding the timescales associated with relaxation to equilibrium in closed quantum many-body systems is one of the central focuses in the study of their non-equilibrium dynamics. At late times, these relaxation processes exhibit universal behavior, emerging from the inherent randomness of chaotic Hamiltonians. In this work, we investigate a disordered spin-$1/2$ XX ladder - an experimentally realizable model known for its diffusive dynamics - to explore the connection between transport properties and spectral measures derived solely from the system's energy levels via these relaxation timescales. We begin by analyzing the spectral form factor, which yields the time when the system begins to follow the random matrix theory (RMT) statistics, known as the RMT time. We then determine the Thouless times - the average times for a local excitation to diffuse across the entire finite system - through the linear-response theory for both spin and energy transport. Our numerical results confirm that the RMT time scales quadratically with system size and upper bounds the Thouless times. Interestingly, we also find that, unlike other non-integrable models, spin diffusion proceeds faster than energy diffusion.

Title: Enhanced White-Light Emission from Self-Trapped Excitons in Antimony and Bismuth Halides through Structural Design
Authors: Philip Klement, Lukas Gümbel, Meng Yang, Jan-Heinrich Littmann, Tatsuhiko Ohto, Hirokazu Tada, Sangam Chatterjee, Johanna Heine
Abstract: Lead halide perovskites have catalyzed the rise of main-group metal halide materials as promising candidates for next-generation optoelectronics, including solar cells, light-emitting diodes, lasers, sensors, and photocatalysts. Among these, effi-cient light-emission arises from self-trapped excitons, wherein excited states induce transient lattice distortions that localize excitons. However, the complex interplay of factors, such as lattice distortions, lattice softness, and electron-phonon cou-pling dynamics, obscures the direct structure-property relationships complicating the targeted material design. In this study, we advance the understanding of self-trapped exciton (STE)-based emission in hybrid antimony and bismuth halides, em-phasizing the interplay of structural and electronic factors that enhance white-light emission. We systematically vary com-position, anion dimensionality, connectivity, and the organic cation and find that the presence of Bi/Sb and Cl in edge-sharing anion motifs promotes white-light emission and optimal electron-phonon coupling. Chlorides outperform bromides, and organic cations, such as CMA and BZA, only subtly influence optical behavior by altering lattice dynamics and rigidity, resulting in tunable emission characteristics without compromising STEs. This work deepens the understanding of the emis-sion mechanisms in hybrid halide perovskites and establishes guiding principles for tailoring optoelectronic properties, paving the way for advanced materials with enhanced white-light emission for next-generation optoelectronic applications.

Title: Quantitative description of the surface tension minimum in a two-component surfactant system
Authors: Edgar M. Blokhuis
Abstract: The Gibbs adsorption equation is the thermodynamic cornerstone for the description and understanding of the surface tension in a surfactant solution. It relates the decrease in surface tension to an increased surfactant adsorption. In the early 1940's, it therefore puzzled researchers to sometimes observe a minimum in the surface tension for certain surfactant solutions, which seemed to indicate surfactant desorption (even depletion) according to the Gibbs adsorption equation. It is now understood that the minimum is related to contamination of the surfactant (notably by dodecanol) and its occurrence has since then been studied extensively in experiments. Still, the precise role of the (tiny amount of) contaminant present is not well understood and a quantitative description and understanding of the minimum in the experimental surface tension is lacking. It is the aim of the present article to provide such a quantitative description. Our theoretical analysis is based on a Statistical Thermodynamic treatment of the Langmuir model for a surfactant mixture combined with the mass action model adapted to describe the formation of mixed micelles. A new Statistical Thermodynamic expression for the surface tension is derived and used to compare with a number of surface tension experiments for both ionic and non-ionic surfactant systems.

Title: Multipole analysis of spin currents in altermagnetic MnTe
Authors: Ryosuke Hirakida, Karma Tenzin, Chao Chen Ye, Berkay Kilic, Carmine Autieri, Jagoda Sławińska
Abstract: Altermagnets, a class of unconventional antiferromagnets where antiparallel spins are connected by combined rotational and translational symmetries, have recently emerged as promising candidates for spintronic applications, as they can efficiently generate spin currents while maintaining vanishing net magnetization. Here, we investigate charge transport and spin currents in $\alpha$-MnTe, a prototypical altermagnet, using symmetry analysis within the multipole framework and fully relativistic first-principles calculations using the Kubo formalism. Our results show that different magnetic configurations with Néel vectors $\hat{N}\parallel y$ and $\hat{N}\parallel x$ in MnTe induce distinct order parameters. This distinction gives rise to spin-momentum locking with different parities and magnetic spin Hall effects (magnetic SHEs) with different anisotropies. Strikingly, our calculations show that the combination of intrinsic spin-orbit coupling and altermagnetic spin splitting yields a large magnetic spin Hall angle of up to 16 \% rivaling or exceeding that of heavy metals such as Pt. On the other hand, the anisotropy of the magnetic SHE provides a practical means to identify the type of order parameter. This establishes, through the powerful framework of multipoles, a general approach for studying transport phenomena that extends to a broader class of altermagnets beyond MnTe.

Title: Lateral disorder in Langmuir monolayers: theoretical derivations and grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction
Authors: L.R. Muftakhova, K.V. Nikolaev, A.V. Rogachev, N.N. Novikova, B.I. Ostrovskii, S.N. Yakunin
Abstract: Recent studies of the self-assembly of Langmuir monolayers have revealed novel forms of lateral molecular ordering. Such studies typically involve the use of grazing-incidence synchrotron radiation scattering, and the lateral order manifests itself as distinct diffraction patterns. The more intricate the molecular organization, the more complicated the corresponding diffraction pattern is. To the point where standard analysis, i.e., identifying peak positions and solving the crystal structure, is insufficient to describe the system. In such cases, a physics-based simulation of the diffraction is required. In this article, we present a versatile theoretical framework for simulating complex structural molecular ordering in Langmuir monolayers. We begin by applying the formalism to a simple case of solid-state monolayers and extend the analysis to describe the structural organization in the collapsed state. The applicability of the method is validated through comparison with experimental data collected at the bending magnet synchrotron beamline.

Title: Random close packing fraction of bidisperse discs: Theoretical derivation and exact bounds
Authors: Raphael Blumenfeld
Abstract: A long-standing problem has been a theoretical prediction of the densest packing fraction of random packings, $\Phi_{RCP}$, of same-size discs in $d=2$ and spheres in $3$. However, to minimize order, experiments and numerical simulations often use two-size discs. For practical purposes, then, a predictive theory for the packing fraction, $\Phi_{RCP}$, of the densest such bidisperse packings is more useful. A disorder-guaranteeing theory is formulated here to fill this gap, using an approach that led to an exact solution for monodisperse discs in $d=2$ [1]. $\Phi_{RCP}$ depends on the sizes ratio, $D$, and concentrations, $p$, of the disc types and the developed theory enables derivation of exact and rigorous upper and lower bounds on $\Phi_{RCP}(p,D)$, as well as an explicit prediction of it.

Title: Intrinsic Electro-Optic Kerr Rotation
Authors: Erlend Syljuåsen, Alireza Qaiumzadeh, Rembert A. Duine, Arne Brataas
Abstract: We uncover a previously overlooked contribution to the electro-optic Kerr rotation of reflected light, arising from the interplay of matter, the static electric field, and the magnetic component of light. Remarkably, this mechanism dominates in isotropic nonmagnetic homogeneous metals. We derive analytical expressions for the Kerr rotation in both two-dimensional layers and semi-infinite systems. Within the relaxation-time approximation, we predict experimentally accessible signal magnitudes. This intrinsic mechanism thereby opens new opportunities for probing electronic properties in materials through Kerr spectroscopy.

Title: Single crystal growth, structural and physical properties, and absence of a charge density wave in Ti_{0.85}Fe6Ge6
Authors: Dechao Cheng, Nour Maraytta, Xiuhua Chen, Xizhi Li, Xueliang Wu, Xiangxiang Jing, Yong Hu, Youpin Gong, Mingquan He, Yisheng Chai, Xiaoyuan Zhou, Pengfei Jiang, Yilin Wang, Michael Merz, Aifeng Wang
Abstract: Kagome materials with charge density waves (CDWs) are fascinating quantum systems, offering an ideal platform to explore intertwined orders and to uncover novel mechanisms behind CDW formation. Chemical models have been developed and applied to predict CDW in $AM_6X_6$-type kagome materials, such as the rattling chain model based on ScV6Sn6 and the magnetic energy-saving model based on FeGe. In this study, we successfully synthesized Ti_{0.85}Fe6Ge6 single crystals using the vapor transport method. As predicted by the rattling chain model, these crystals are expected to exhibit kagome CDW behavior. Magnetization measurements indicate that Ti_{0.85}Fe6Ge6 is an easy-axis antiferromagnet with T_N = 488 K and transport measurements reveal metallic behavior primarily driven by electron-type carriers. However, no clear signatures of a CDW were observed in Ti_{0.85}Fe6Ge6. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate a markedly distinct electronic structure compared to related compounds: instead of a carrier-doping-induced rigid shift, the density of states shifted away from the Fermi level. Consistent with our structural investigations, the absence of a CDW and the unusual band structure can be attributed to the bonding characteristic within Ti_{0.85}Fe6Ge6. The strong covalent bonds of Ti-Ge1b, along with the solid Ge1b-Ge1b dimers, prevent the Ti-Ge1b-Ge1b-Ti chain from rattling. The presence of Fe-Fe antibonding state at the Fermi level enhances the spin polarization and depletes the electronic density around the Fermi level. Our results suggest that both the ionic radius and the bonding characteristics of the filler atom are crucial for the formation of CDWs in kagome materials. These factors can serve as supplementary terms to the rattling chain model, providing new insights for the discovery of novel kagome CDW materials.

Title: Unveiling the magnetic behavior of C$_{\rm3}$N$_{\rm4}$ 2D material by defect creation, defect passivation, and transition metal adsorption
Authors: Taoufik Sakhraoui, František Karlický
Abstract: Using the density functional tight binding method (DFTB) and the GFN1-xTB (Geometries, Frequencies, and Noncovalent interactions Tight Binding) Hamiltonian, we have investigated the structural, electronic and magnetic properties of vacancy defects, hydrogen and oxygen passivated defects, and Fe adsorption in two-dimensional (2D) graphitic carbon nitride (gt-C$_3$N$_4$) 2D material. The ring shape is the most preferred vacancy evolution path, with significant stability of the semicircle fourfold C-N-C-N vacancy. We found that bare gt-C$_3$N$_4$ which is non-magnetic becomes magnetic by 2-, and 5-defects creation, hydrogen/oxygen passivation of the defects, and upon Fe adsorption. Interestingly, Fe atoms interact with the gt-C$_3$N$_4$ sheet and result in a ground ferromagnetic (FM) state. In addition, we investigate the effects of passivating the vacancies by hydrogen in gt-C$_3$N$_4$ on its structural, electrical, and magnetic properties. We found that substituting the 1, 2, and 3 vacancies with hydrogen and passivating the 6-defect with oxygen turns on magnetism in the system. Due to structural distortion, the passivated defects do not have a well-ordered magnetic orientation. However, passivating the remaining defected structures maintains the nonmagnetic state. It is also shown that passivation leads to a semiconductor with a band gap value higher than that of the bare material. We also calculate the electronic and magnetic properties of transition metal (TM) atoms, including V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni-adsorbed gt-C$_3$N$_4$ monolayer. All TM atoms show slight lattice distortion, and the adsorbed system almost maintains the original structure type. Moreover, a FM alignment was observed with a total magnetic moments of 2.89 $\mu_B$, 2 $\mu_B$, and 1 $\mu_B$ for V, Fe, and Co atoms, respectively. The Cr, Mn, and Ni atoms induce no magnetism to the non magnetic gt-C$_3$N$_4$ system.

Title: Non-universal localization transition in the quantum Hall effect probed through broken-symmetry states of graphene
Authors: Aifei Zhang, Torsten Röper, Manjari Garg, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Carles Altimiras, Patrice Roche, Erwann Bocquillon, Olivier Maillet, François D. Parmentier
Abstract: The quantum Hall effect hosts quantum phase transitions in which the localization length, that is the size of disorder-induced bulk localized states, is governed by universal scaling from percolation theory. However, this universal character is not systematically observed in experiments, including very recent ones in extremely clean devices. Here we explore this non-universality by systematically measuring the localization length in broken-symmetry quantum Hall states of graphene. Depending on the nature and gap size of these states, we observe differences of up to a tenfold in the minimum localization length, accompanied by clear deviations from universal scaling. Our results, as well as the previously observed non-universality, are fully captured by a simple picture based on the co-existence of localized states from two successive sub-Landau levels.

Title: Massive Discovery of Low-Dimensional Materials from Universal Computational Strategy
Authors: Mohammad Bagheri, Ethan Berger, Hannu-Pekka Komsa, Pekka Koskinen
Abstract: Low-dimensional materials have attractive properties that drive intense efforts for novel materials discovery. However, experiments are tedious for systematic discovery, and present computational methods are often tuned to two-dimensional (2D) materials, overlooking other low-dimensional materials. Here, we combined universal machine-learning interatomic potentials (UMLIPs) and an advanced, interatomic force constant (FC) -based dimensionality classification method to make a massive discovery of novel low-dimensional materials. We first benchmarked UMLIPs' first-principles-level accuracy in quantifying FCs and calculated phonons for 35,689 materials from the Materials Project database. We then used the FC-based method for dimensionality classification to discover 9139 low-dimensional materials, including 1838 0D clusters, 1760 1D chains, 3057 2D sheets/layers, and 2484 mixed-dimensionality materials, all of which conventional geometric descriptors have not recognized. By calculating the binding energies for the discovered 2D materials, we also identified 960 sheets that could be easily or potentially exfoliated from their parent bulk structures.

Title: A follow-up on the sulphur atom popping model for MoS$_2$ memristor
Authors: Sanchali Mitra, Santanu Mahapatra
Abstract: The mechanism of resistive switching in two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor-based memristors is intriguing, and our conventional knowledge of bulk-oxide based memristors does not apply to these devices. Experimental data indicate that the genesis of resistive switching may be intrinsic to the 2D semiconducting active layer, as well as resulting from the movement of electrode atoms. Employing reactive-force field (ReaxFF) molecular dynamics simulations, we introduced the "sulphur atom popping model" [npj 2D Mater. Appl. 5, 33 (2021)] to elucidate the intrinsic nature of non-volatile resistive switching in 2D molybdenum disulfide-based memristors. In this paper we provide additional perspective to this model using density functional theory. We also discuss the limitations of universal machine learning interatomic potentials in reproducing ReaxFF simulation results.

Title: Solution of the Anderson chain with two-particle hybridization of localized and itinerant electrons
Authors: Igor N. Karnaukhov
Abstract: A modified Anderson lattice is proposed, whose the Hamiltonian accounts for the two-particle hybridization of localized and itinerant electrons instead of one-particle hybridization which takes into account in the original Anderson model. The 1D version of this model can be solved using the Bethe ansazt. It has been shown that hybridization between itinerant and frozen localized electrons results in an effective on-site interaction between itinerant electrons. The magnitude and sign of this interaction depend on the position of the level relative to the Fermi energy (the energy of this level corresponds to the two-particle state of localized electrons at a site). It is shown that when the energy of an localized electron in the two-particle state lies above the Fermi energy, the effective on-site interaction between itinerant electrons is attractive. A repulsive interaction between itinerant electrons occurs when this energy lies below the Fermi energy. Thus, two-part hybridization between localized and itinerant electrons can lead to effective attraction between itinerant electrons, which is unique in itself and may underlie the nature of high-temperature superconductivity.

Title: Random singlet physics in the $S = \frac{1}{2}$ pyrochlore antiferromagnet NaCdCu$_2$F$_7$
Authors: Andrej Kancko, Hironori Sakai, Cinthia Antunes Corrêa, Petr Proschek, Jan Prokleška, Tetiana Haidamak, Marc Uhlarz, Adam Berlie, Yo Tokunaga, Ross Harvey Colman
Abstract: We report a random singlet ground state in the $S = \frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg pyrochlore antiferromagnet NaCdCu$_2$F$_7$. Cationic Na$^+$/Cd$^{2+}$ disorder generates a broad distribution of Cu$^{2+}$-F$^{-}$-Cu$^{2+}$ exchange couplings. Despite strong antiferromagnetic interactions, no magnetic order or freezing occurs, with $\mu$SR measurements confirming dynamics down to 58 mK. $T$-linear specific heat, a Curie-like susceptibility tail, and universal power-law scaling with data collapse in $\chi(T)$, $M(H)$, $C_{\rm mag}/T$, $^{23}$Na $(1/T_1T)$ and $\lambda_{\rm LF}$ demonstrate a disorder-driven network of singlets and orphan spins, distinct from a clean quantum spin liquid.

Title: Inelastic scattering and transient localization from coupling to two-level systems
Authors: Hadi Rammal, Sergio Ciuchi, Simone Fratini
Abstract: We consider an electron interacting locally with two-level systems (TLSs) as an archetypal model for charge transport in the presence of inelastic scatterers. To assess the importance of quantum effects in the optical and d.c. conductivity we solve the model numerically without approximations using the finite temperature Lanczos method (FTLM), and compare the results with Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT). In the slow fluctuation limit, the coupling to the TLSs causes transient localization of the carriers analogous to the one recently found in the electron-boson scattering problem, featuring enhanced resistivities and displaced Drude peaks. Fast inelastic scatterers suppress localization, restoring a more conventional regime where transport and optical properties are governed by independent scattering events.

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) magnets host a wide range of exotic magnetic textures, whose low-energy excitations and finite-temperature properties are typically described by effective spin models based on Heisenberg-like Hamiltonians. A key challenge in this framework is the reliable determination, from ab initio calculations, of exchange parameters and their anisotropic components, crucial for stabilising long-range order. Among the different strategies proposed for this task, the energy-mapping method -- based on total-energy calculations within Density Functional Theory (DFT) -- is the most widely adopted, but it typically requires laborious, multi-step procedures. To overcome this limitation, we introduce AMaRaNTA (Automating Magnetic paRAmeters iN a Tensorial Approach), a computational package that systematically automates the energy-mapping method, specifically through its ``four-state'' formulation, to extract exchange and anisotropy parameters in 2D magnets. In its current implementation, AMaRaNTA returns the nearest-neighbour exchange tensor, complemented by scalar parameters for second- and third-nearest-neighbour exchange interactions as well as single-ion anisotropy. Together, these provide a minimal yet sufficient set of parameters to capture magnetic frustration and anisotropies, essential for stabilising several observed magnetic states in 2D materials. Applied to a representative subset of the Materials Cloud 2D Structure database, AMaRaNTA demonstrates robust, automated and reproducible screening of magnetic interactions, with clear potential for high-throughput simulations.

Title: Effects of correlated hopping on thermoelectric response of a quantum dot strongly coupled to ferromagnetic leads
Authors: Kacper Wrześniewski, Ireneusz Weymann
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the impact of correlated hopping on thermoelectric transport through a quantum dot coupled to ferromagnetic leads. Using the accurate numerical renormalization group method, we analyze the transport characteristics, focusing on the interplay between electronic correlations, spin-dependent transport processes, and thermoelectric response. We calculate the electrical conductance and thermopower as functions of the dot energy level, lead polarization, and the amplitude of correlated hopping. Moreover, we analyze the effect of competing correlations on the Kondo resonance and discuss the asymmetry of conductance peaks under the influence of the exchange field. We demonstrate that the presence of correlated hopping is responsible for asymmetric spin-dependent transport characteristics. Our results provide valuable insight into how correlated hopping affects spin-dependent transport and thermoelectric efficiency in quantum dot systems with ferromagnetic contacts.

Title: Climbing the ladder: a method for identifying promising copper-lead apatites
Authors: Ihor Sukhenko, Volodymyr Karbivskyy
Abstract: We develop a DFT screening procedure for copper-substituted lead apatites of the composition Pb$_9$Cu(XO$_4$)$_6$Y that enforces three design rules: thermodynamic stability, Cu site preference, and symmetry robustness of the near-Fermi electronic structure. A convex-hull analysis over P/V/As as X, O/F/Cl/Br as Y, identifies vanadates as the only members on or beneath the hull. Across the family, Cu substitution at Pb$^{\text{I}}$ ($4f$) preserves flat bands at E$_F$, whereas Pb$^{\text{I}}$ ($6h$) either gaps or severely distorts them. Small symmetry-lowering relaxations ($P3 \rightarrow P1$) are also capable of opening the band gap, motivating symmetry robustness as a filter. Applying these criteria singles out Pb$_9$Cu(VO$_4$)$_6$Br$_2$ (and, possibly, Cl$_2$) as leading candidates. This work motivates experimental study of the selected compounds, as well as a dedicated study of strong correlations.

Title: Are Neural Networks Collision Resistant?
Authors: Marco Benedetti, Andrej Bogdanov, Enrico M. Malatesta, Marc Mézard, Gianmarco Perrupato, Alon Rosen, Nikolaj I. Schwartzbach, Riccardo Zecchina
Abstract: When neural networks are trained to classify a dataset, one finds a set of weights from which the network produces a label for each data point. We study the algorithmic complexity of finding a collision in a single-layer neural net, where a collision is defined as two distinct sets of weights that assign the same labels to all data. For binary perceptrons with oscillating activation functions, we establish the emergence of an overlap gap property in the space of collisions. This is a topological property believed to be a barrier to the performance of efficient algorithms. The hardness is supported by numerical experiments using approximate message passing algorithms, for which the algorithms stop working well below the value predicted by our analysis. Neural networks provide a new category of candidate collision resistant functions, which for some parameter setting depart from constructions based on lattices. Beyond relevance to cryptography, our work uncovers new forms of computational hardness emerging in large neural networks which may be of independent interest.

Title: What causes the variation in superconducting properties of UTe$_{2}$?
Authors: C. S. Kengle, Noah Schnitzer, M. M. Bordelon, S. M. Thomas, P. F. S. Rosa
Abstract: Reaching a consensus on the superconducting order parameter of unconventional superconductors remains a central challenge in the field of magnetically-mediated superconductivity. Though UTe$_{2}$ is largely accepted as a rare example of an odd-parity superconductor, its precise order parameter remains highly debated, even at ambient conditions. A key underlying issue is the large sample-to-sample variation in superconducting properties at zero applied pressure and magnetic field. Here, we investigate the origin of the observed variation by means of single crystal x-ray diffraction (SC-XRD) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) measurements. Our results reveal highly ordered crystalline lattices, in agreement with the expected $Immm$ structure, and no signs of uranium vacancies. Tiny amounts of interstitial defects, however, are observed on the Te2 layers that host Te chains along the b axis. We argue that these defects give rise to slightly enhanced atomic displacement parameters observed in SC-XRD data and are enough to disrupt the unconventional superconducting state in UTe$_{2}$. Our findings highlight the need to focus future order parameter determination efforts on single crystals of UTe$_{2}$ with minimal amounts of structural disorder.

Title: 4D-QENS Analysis of Correlated Ionic Conduction in SrCl$_2$
Authors: Jared Coles, Omar Chmaissem, Matthew Krogstad, Daniel M. Pajerowski, Feng Ye, Duck Young Chung, Mercouri G. Kanatzidis, Stephan Rosenkranz, Raymond Osborn
Abstract: Methods of elucidating the mechanisms of fast-ion conduction in solid-state materials are pivotal for advancements in energy technologies such as batteries, fuel cells, sensors, and supercapacitors. In this study, we examine the ionic conduction pathways in single crystal SrCl$_2$, which is a fast-ion conductor above 900~K, using four-dimensional Quasi-Elastic Neutron Scattering (4D-QENS). We explore both coherent and incoherent neutron scattering at temperatures above the transition temperature into the superionic phase to explore the correlated motion of hopping anions. Refinements of the incoherent QENS yield residence times and jump probabilities between lattice sites in good agreement with previous studies, confirming that ionic hopping along nearest-neighbor directions is the most probable conduction pathway. However, the coherent QENS reveals evidence of de Gennes narrowing, indicating the importance of ionic correlations in the conduction mechanism. This highlights the need for improvements both in the theory of ionic transport in fluorite compounds and the modeling of coherent 4D-QENS in single crystals.

Title: Anisotropic shrinkage and finite strains in confined frictional contacts
Authors: Marco Ceglie, Cosimo Mandriota, Giuseppe Carbone, Nicola Menga, Antoine Chateauminois
Abstract: We report on an experimental investigation of the interplay between friction, adhesion, contact geometry, and finite strains for smooth frictional contacts between rigid spherical glass probes and flat silicone substrates. Using both bulk and layer substrates under various loading conditions (normal force, radius of the probe), we show that shear-induced anisotropic shrinkage of the adhesive contact area under steady-state sliding is an effect of finite-elasticity conditions and is drastically affected by the level of geometric confinement. The resulting non-linear coupling between the normal and lateral directions is also investigated measuring the changes in the indentation depth (conv. normal load) during the stiction of the adhesive contacts under imposed normal load (conv. indentation depth) conditions, with strong effects of contact confinement. From a comparison with adhesiveless linear contact mechanics calculations, we show that the experimental observations can only be accounted for by the occurrence of finite strains/displacements conditions. Accordingly, measurements of the in-plane surface displacements at the surface of the rubber substrates confirm that strain levels well in the neo-Hookean range are experienced during steady-state frictional sliding.

Title: Spin-polaron fingerprints in the optical conductivity of iridates
Authors: Francesco Cassol, Léo Gaspard, Cyril Martins, Michele Casula, Benjamin Lenz
Abstract: As a consequence of their spin-orbit entangled ground state, many $5d^{5}$ iridate materials display a peculiar double peak structure in optical transport quantities, such as absorption and conductivity. Their common interpretation is based on the presence of Hubbard subbands in the half-filled $j_{\mathrm{eff}}=1/2$ manifold. Herein, we challenge this picture, proposing a scenario based on the presence of spin-polaron (SP) quasiparticles, and assigning a dominant SP character to the first peak. We illustrate it by taking the materials Ba$_2$IrO$_4$ and Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ as paradigmatic examples, which we investigate within the dynamical mean-field theory and the self-consistent Born approximation. Both theories reproduce nontrivial features revealed by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and optical transport measurements, supporting our interpretation. In the case of Sr$_2$IrO$_4$, we show how the SP scenario survives in the low-doped regime. Similar optical transport fingerprints are expected to be found in the wider class of $5d^5$ iridates and more generally in strongly correlated antiferromagnetic regimes, such as those found in cuprates.

Title: Superfluid-Mott transition in a frustrated triangular optical lattice
Authors: Mehedi Hasan, Luca Donini, Sompob Shanokprasith, Daniel Braund, Tobias Marozsak, Moritz Epping, Daniel Reed, Max Melchner, Tiffany Harte, Ulrich Schneider
Abstract: Geometric frustration can significantly increase the complexity and richness of many-body physics and, for instance, suppress antiferromagnetic order in quantum magnets. Here, we employ ultracold bosonic $^{39}$K atoms in a triangular optical lattice to study geometric frustration by stabilizing the gas at the frustrated upper band edge using negative absolute temperatures. We find that geometric frustration suppresses the critical interaction strength for the (chiral-)superfluid to Mott insulator ($\chi$-SF-MI) quantum phase transition by a factor of 2.7(3) and furthermore changes the critical dynamics of the transition. Although the emergence of coherence during fast ramps from MI to the ($\chi$-)SF regime is continuous in both cases, for ramps longer than a few tunnelling times, significant differences emerge. In the \frs case, no long-range order emerges on the studied timescales, highlighting a significantly reduced rate or even saturation of the emerging coherence. This work opens the door to quantum simulations of frustrated systems that are often intractable by classical simulations.

Title: Chern classes of the multilayer fractional quantum Hall bundle on Riemann surfaces
Authors: María Abad Aldonza (UVSQ), Florent Dupont (IRMA)
Abstract: The so-called multilayer wave functions were introduced in the study of the fractional Quantum Hall effect by Halperin and others. They are defined with the help of a symmetric matrix $K$ in $M^k(\mathbb{N})$, which encodes the couplings between the $k$ layers where particles live. We study the multilayer quantum states in the case where each layer is a Riemann surface of genus $g$. These states form a vector bundle over the Jacobian variety of the Riemann surface, or the space of Aharonov-Bohm fluxes in physics terminology. Burban-Klevtsov have determined the rank and first Chern class of this bundle when $g=1$, and Klevtsov-Zvonkine computed the Chern character of this bundle in the single layer case for any genus. We generalize the latter approach to the multilayer case and compute the Chern character of the multilayer bundle for any genus, and any possible number of non-localized quasi-holes, under the assumption that the bilinear form associated to $K-I$ is non negative. The key tools are the Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch formula, Berezin integration and Wick's formula for exterior algebras. We show that when all quasi-holes are localized, the Chern character is compatible with the bundle being projectively flat. Furthermore, for those configurations, the conductance becomes independent of the genus and is equal to the sum of the coefficients of the inverse matrix $K^{-1}$, proving two conjectures by Keski-Vakkuri and Wen. We also find the relation linking $K$, the genus of the surface, the magnetic field and the number of non-localized quasi holes in each layer, which was studied under the name of ''shift formula''. Finally, we study conditions on the matrix $K$ under which states having only localized quasi-holes maximize the total particle number, as well as the asymptotics for large magnetic fields in this scenario.

Title: Mean-field limits in interacting particle systems with symmetric superlinear rates
Authors: Angeliki Koutsimpela
Abstract: We derive the exchange-driven growth (EDG) equations as the mean-field limit of interacting particle systems on the complete graph. Extending previous work, we consider symmetric exchange kernels $c(k, l) = c(l, k)$ satisfying super-linear bounds of the form $c(k, l) \leq C(k^{\mu}l^{\nu} + k^{\nu}l^{\mu})$, with $0 \leq \mu, \nu \leq 2$ and $\mu + \nu \leq 3$. Under these conditions the EDG equations are known to have global solutions. We establish a law of large numbers for the empirical measures, showing that the solutions of the EDG equation describe the limiting distribution of cluster sizes in the particle system. Furthermore, we analyse the dynamics of tagged particles and prove convergence to a time-inhomogeneous Markov process governed by a nonlinear master equation, derived via a law of large numbers for size-biased empirical processes.

Title: Robustness and resilience of complex networks
Authors: Oriol Artime, Marco Grassia, Manlio De Domenico, James P. Gleeson, Hernan A. Makse, Giuseppe Mangioni, Matjaz Perc, Filippo Radicchi
Abstract: Complex networks are ubiquitous: a cell, the human brain, a group of people and the Internet are all examples of interconnected many-body systems characterized by macroscopic properties that cannot be trivially deduced from those of their microscopic constituents. Such systems are exposed to both internal, localized, failures and external disturbances or perturbations. Owing to their interconnected structure, complex systems might be severely degraded, to the point of disintegration or systemic dysfunction. Examples include cascading failures, triggered by an initially localized overload in power systems, and the critical slowing downs of ecosystems which can be driven towards extinction. In recent years, this general phenomenon has been investigated by framing localized and systemic failures in terms of perturbations that can alter the function of a system. We capitalize on this mathematical framework to review theoretical and computational approaches to characterize robustness and resilience of complex networks. We discuss recent approaches to mitigate the impact of perturbations in terms of designing robustness, identifying early-warning signals and adapting responses. In terms of applications, we compare the performance of the state-of-the-art dismantling techniques, highlighting their optimal range of applicability for practical problems, and provide a repository with ready-to-use scripts, a much-needed tool set.

Title: Advancing Universal Deep Learning for Electronic-Structure Hamiltonian Prediction of Materials
Authors: Shi Yin, Zujian Dai, Xinyang Pan, Lixin He
Abstract: Deep learning methods for electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction has offered significant computational efficiency advantages over traditional DFT methods, yet the diversity of atomic types, structural patterns, and the high-dimensional complexity of Hamiltonians pose substantial challenges to the generalization performance. In this work, we contribute on both the methodology and dataset sides to advance universal deep learning paradigm for Hamiltonian prediction. On the method side, we propose NextHAM, a neural E(3)-symmetry and expressive correction method for efficient and generalizable materials electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction. First, we introduce the zeroth-step Hamiltonians, which can be efficiently constructed by the initial charge density of DFT, as informative descriptors of neural regression model in the input level and initial estimates of the target Hamiltonian in the output level, so that the regression model directly predicts the correction terms to the target ground truths, thereby significantly simplifying the input-output mapping for learning. Second, we present a neural Transformer architecture with strict E(3)-Symmetry and high non-linear expressiveness for Hamiltonian prediction. Third, we propose a novel training objective to ensure the accuracy performance of Hamiltonians in both real space and reciprocal space, preventing error amplification and the occurrence of "ghost states" caused by the large condition number of the overlap matrix. On the dataset side, we curate a high-quality broad-coverage large benchmark, namely Materials-HAM-SOC, comprising 17,000 material structures spanning 68 elements from six rows of the periodic table and explicitly incorporating SOC effects. Experimental results on Materials-HAM-SOC demonstrate that NextHAM achieves excellent accuracy and efficiency in predicting Hamiltonians and band structures.

Title: Scalable Machine Learning Model for Energy Decomposition Analysis in Aqueous Systems
Authors: Hossein Tahmasbi, Michael Beerbaum, Bartosz Brzoza, Attila Cangi, Thomas D. Kühne
Abstract: Energy decomposition analysis (EDA) based on absolutely localized molecular orbitals provides detailed insights into intermolecular bonding by decomposing the total molecular binding energy into physically meaningful components. Here, we develop a neural network EDA model capable of predicting the electron delocalization energy component of water molecules, which captures the stabilization arising from charge transfer between occupied absolutely localized molecular orbitals of one molecule and the virtual orbitals of another. Exploiting the locality assumption of the electronic structure, our model enables accurate prediction of electron delocalization energies for molecular systems far beyond the size accessible to conventional density functional theory calculations, while maintaining its accuracy. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach by modeling hydration effects in large molecular complexes, specifically in metal-organic frameworks.

Title: Exact Solvability and Integrability Signatures in a Periodically Driven Infinite-Range Spin Chain: The Case of Floquet interval $π/2$
Authors: Harshit Sharma, Sashmita Rout, Avadhut V. Purohit, Udaysinh T. Bhosale
Abstract: We study the signatures of quantum integrability (QI) in a spin chain model, having infinite-range Ising interaction and subjected to a periodic pulse of an external magnetic field. We analyze the unitary operator, its eigensystem, the single-qubit reduced density matrix, and the entanglement dynamics for arbitrary initial state for any $N$. The QI in our model can be identified through key signatures such as the periodicity of entanglement dynamics and the time-evolved unitary operator, and highly degenerated spectra or Poisson statistics. In our previous works, these signatures were observed in the model for parameters $\tau=\pi/4$ and $J=1,1/2$, where we provided exact analytical results up to $12$ qubits and numerically for large $N$ [Phys. Rev. B \textbf{110}, 064313,(2024)}; arXiv:2411.16670 (2024)}]. In this paper, we extend the analysis to $\tau=m\pi/2$, and arbitrary $J$ and $N$. We show that the signatures of QI persist for the rational $J$, whereas for irrational $J$, these signatures are absent for any $N$. Further, we perform spectral statistics and find that for irrational $J$, as well as for rational $J$ with perturbations, the spacing distributions of eigenvalues follow Poisson statistics. The average adjacent gap ratio is obtained as $\langle r \rangle=0.386$, consistent with Poisson statistics. Additionally, we compute the ratio of eigenstate entanglement entropy to its maximum value ($\langle S \rangle /S_{Max}$) and find that it remains significantly below $1$ in the limit $N\rightarrow \infty$, which further confirms the QI. We discuss some potential experimental realizations of our model.

Duesberg, John Robertson, Uygar Avci, Iuliana Radu, Eric Pop, Cesar J. Lockhart de la Rosa, Tibor Grasser
Abstract: The recent progress in nanosheet transistors has established two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors as viable candidates for future ultra-scaled electronic devices. Next to reducing contact resistance, identifying good gate dielectrics is a fundamental challenge, as the dielectric/channel interface dramatically impacts virtually all performance parameters. While several promising gate dielectrics have recently been reported, the evaluation of their quality and suitability is often fragmentary and focused on selected important performance metrics of the gate stack, such as the capacitive gate control, leakage currents, reliability, and ease of fabrication and integration. However, identifying a suitable gate stack is a complex problem that has not yet been approached systematically. In this perspective, we aim to formulate general criteria for good gate dielectrics.

Title: Ising dynamics on multilayer networks with heterogeneous layers
Authors: Suman S. Kulkarni, Christopher W. Lynn, Mason A. Porter, Dani S. Bassett
Abstract: Multilayer networks provide a framework to study complex systems with multiple types of interactions, multiple dynamical processes, and/or multiple subsystems. When studying a dynamical process on a multilayer network, it is important to consider how both layer structure and heterogeneity across layers impacts the overall dynamics. As a concrete example, we study Ising dynamics on multilayer networks and investigate how network structure affects its qualitative features. We focus primarily on multiplex networks, which are multilayer networks in which interlayer edges occur only between manifestations of the same entity on different layers, although we also consider one empirical example with a more general multilayer structure. We use numerical simulations and a mean-field approximation to examine the steady-state behavior of the Ising dynamics as a function of temperature (which is a key model parameter) for a variety of two-layer multilayer networks from both models and empirical data. We examine both the steady-state behavior and a metastable state in which the two layers are anti-aligned, and we explore the effects of interlayer coupling strength and structural heterogeneity. In synthetic multilayer networks with core--periphery structure, we show that interlayer edges that involve peripheral nodes can exert more influence than interlayer edges that involve only core nodes. Finally, we consider empirical multilayer networks from biological and social systems. Our work illustrates how heterogeneity across the layers of a multilayer network influences dynamics on the whole network.

Title: Pressure shifts in large-amplitude pulsatile shear flow: A microfluidic method to probe the normal stress response of complex fluids
Authors: T. Rodrigues, F. J. Galindo-Rosales, L. Campo-Deaño
Abstract: A microfluidic approach to probing the first normal stress difference from single-point pressure measurements in pulsatile shear flows is presented. Using an original experimental design, we examine the near-zero-mean pulsatile flow of polymeric solutions in a straight, deformable microchannel at low Reynolds and Womersley numbers. An important aspect of this work is that the enhanced fluid elastic stresses can be efficiently determined via the pressure shift from pressure-controlled large-amplitude pulsatile shear experiments. We find a scaling law that collapses pressure-shift data from viscoelastic fluids of different molecular weights onto a single master curve that can then be used to predict this phenomenology. Taken together, these results could help shed light on our understanding of the non-linear normal stress responses in time-dependent flows.

Title: Fidelity zeros and Lee-Yang theory of quantum phase transitions
Authors: Tian-Yi Gu, Gaoyong Sun
Abstract: Lee-Yang theory is central to the analysis of thermal phase transitions. However, the underlying mechanism of the theory and the nature of Lee-Yang zeros in quantum many-body systems remains elusive. Here, we develop a unified framework for understanding quantum phase transitions from fidelity zeros induced by symmetry breaking. These zeros, arising from transitions between symmetry sectors, obey the Lee-Yang theorem and give rise to fidelity edges near critical points. Quantum criticality is further characterized through the finite-size scaling of fidelity zeros. As concrete examples, we analytically and numerically investigate fidelity zeros in one- and two-dimensional ferromagnetic Ising models under a complex magnetic field. Our results provide new insights into the mechanism of Lee-Yang theory and open avenues for exploring unexplored landscapes of phase transitions in quantum many-body systems.

Title: Extended Low-Rank Approximation Accelerates Learning of Elastic Response in Heterogeneous Materials
Authors: Prabhat Karmakar, Sayan Gupta, Ilaksh Adlakha
Abstract: Predicting how the microstructure governs the mechanical response of heterogeneous materials is essential for optimizing design and performance. Yet this task remains difficult due to the complex, high dimensional nature of microstructural features. Relying on physics based simulations to probe the microstructural space is computationally prohibitive. This motivates the development of computational tools to efficiently learn structure property linkages governing mechanical behavior. While contemporary data driven approaches offer new possibilities, they often require large datasets. To address this challenge, this work presents the Extended Low Rank Approximation (xLRA), a framework that employs canonical polyadic tensor decomposition. It efficiently maps high dimensional microstructural information to the local elastic response by adaptively incorporating higher rank terms. xLRA accurately predicts the local elastic strain fields in porous microstructures, requiring a maximum rank of only 4. The compact formulation of xLRA achieves accurate predictions when trained on just 5% of the dataset, demonstrating significant data efficiency. Moreover, xLRA proves transferability by delivering results across representative material systems, including two phase composites and single and dual phase polycrystals. Despite being compact, xLRA retains essential microstructural details, enabling accurate predictions on unseen microstructures. Benchmarking shows that xLRA outperforms contemporary methods in predictive accuracy, generalizability, and computational efficiency, while requiring 6 orders of magnitude fewer floating point operations. In summary, xLRA provides an efficient framework for predicting the elastic response from microstructures, enabling scalable mapping of structure property linkages.

Title: Particle-hole asymmetric phases in doped twisted bilayer graphene
Authors: Run Hou, Shouvik Sur, Lucas K. Wagner, Andriy H. Nevidomskyy
Abstract: Despite much theoretical work, developing a comprehensive ab initio model for twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) has proven challenging due to the inherent trade-off between accurately describing the band structure and incorporating the interactions within the Hamiltonian, particularly given the topological obstruction -- so-called fragile topology -- to the description of the model in terms of localized symmetric Wannier functions within the flat band manifold. Here, we circumvent this obstruction by using an extended 8-orbital model, for which localized Wannier orbitals have been formulated by Carr et al. [1]. We constructed an extended multi-orbital Hubbard model, and performed Hartree-Fock (HF) calculations to explore its phase diagram across commensurate fillings from -3 to 3. We found several nearly-degenerate insulating states at charge neutrality, all of which exhibit orbital orders. Crucially, TBG near magic angle is known to be particle-hole asymmetric, which is naturally captured by the single-particle band structure of our model and is reflected in the distinction between the symmetry broken states obtained at electron and hole dopings away from the charge neutral point. At filling -1 and +2, quantum anomalous hall states are obtained, while for the rest of the integer fillings away from charge neutrality, we found the system to realize metallic states with various orbital, valley and spin orderings. We also observed that most of the Hartree--Fock ground states exhibit a generalized valley Hund's-like rule, resulting in valley polarization. Importantly, we show that the incorporation of the intra-valley and inter-valley exchange interactions is crucial to properly stabilize the ordered symmetry-broken states. In agreement with experiments, we find significant particle-hole asymmetry, which underscores the importance of using particle-hole asymmetric models.

Title: Non-Abelian Fractional Chern Insulators and Competing States in Flat Moiré Bands
Authors: Hui Liu, Zhao Liu, Emil J. Bergholtz
Abstract: Breakthrough experiments have recently realized fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) in moiré materials. However, all states observed are Abelian, the possible existence of more exotic non-Abelian FCIs remains controversial both experimentally and theoretically. Here, we investigate the competition between charge density wave (CDW) order, gapless composite fermion liquid (CFL), and non-Abelian Moore-Read states at half-filling of a moiré band. Although groundstate (quasi-)degeneracies and spectral flow are not sufficient for distinguishing between charge order and Moore-Read states, we find evidence using entanglement spectroscopy that both these states of matter can be realized with Coulomb interactions. By further analyzing the graviton excitations of Moore-Read states, we unveil that the ground states exhibit a mixed behavior of Pfaffian and anti-Pfaffian, despite the weak breaking of particle-hole symmetry. In a double twisted bilayer graphene model, transitions between these phases can be driven by the coupling strength between the layers: at weak coupling there is a CFL phase and at strong coupling a CDW order emerges. Remarkably, however, there is compelling evidence for a non-Abelian Moore-Read FCI phase at intermediate coupling.

Title: Hydrodynamics of pulsating active liquids
Authors: Tirthankar Banerjee, Thibault Desaleux, Jonas Ranft, Étienne Fodor
Abstract: Inspired by dense contractile tissues, where cells are subject to periodic deformation, we formulate and study a generic hydrodynamic theory of pulsating active liquids. Combining mechanical and phenomenological arguments, we postulate that the mechanochemical feedback between the local phase, which describes how cells deform due to autonomous driving, and the local density can be described in terms of a free energy. We demonstrate that such a feedback is compatible with the coarse-graining of a broad class of microscopic models. Our hydrodynamics captures the three main states emerging in its particle-based counterparts: a globally cycling state, a homogeneous arrested state with constant phase, and a state with propagating radial waves. Remarkably, we show that the competition between these states can be rationalized intuitively in terms of an effective landscape, and argue that waves can be regarded as secondary instabilities. Linear stability analysis of the arrested and cycling states, including the role of fluctuations, leads to predictions for the phase boundaries. Overall, our results demonstrate that our minimal, yet non-trivial model provides a relevant platform to study the rich phenomenology of pulsating liquids.

Title: Entropic Clustering of Stickers Induces Aging in Biocondensates
Authors: Hugo Le Roy, Paolo De Los Rios
Abstract: Biomolecular condensates are cellular phase-separated droplets that usually exhibit a viscoelastic mechanical response. A behavior rationalized by modeling the complex molecules that make up a condensate as stickers and spacers, which assemble into a network-like structure. Condensates usually exhibit a solidification over a long period of time (days), a phenomenon described as this http URL emergence of such a long timescale of evolution from microscopic processes, as well as the associated microscopic reorganization leading to aging, remains mostly an open question. In this article, we explore the connection between the mechanical properties of the condensates and their microscopic structure. We propose a minimal model for the dynamic of stickers and spacers, and show that entropy maximization of spacers leads to an attractive force between stickers. Our system displays a surprisingly slow relaxation toward equilibrium, reminiscent of glassy systems and consistent with the liquid-to-solid transition observed. To explain this behavior, we study the clustering dynamic of stickers and successfully explain the origin of glassy relaxation.

Title: Interaction dependence of the Hall response for the Bose-Hubbard triangular ladder
Authors: Catalin-Mihai Halati, Thierry Giamarchi
Abstract: We explore the behavior of the Hall response of a Bose-Hubbard triangular ladder in a magnetic field as a function of the repulsive on-site atomic interactions. We consider a wide range of interaction strengths, from the weakly interacting limit to the hardcore regime. This is realized by computing the Hall polarization following the quench of a weak linear potential which induces the flow of a current through the system, using time-dependent matrix product state numerical simulations. We complement our understanding in the regime of small magnetic fields by analytical calculations of the equilibrium value of the Hall polarization for non-interacting bosonic atoms, or under a mean-field assumption. The Bose-Hubbard triangular flux ladder exhibits a rich phase diagram, containing Meissner, vortex and biased-chiral superfluid phases. We show that the Hall response can be employed to fingerprint the various chiral state, the frustration effects occurring in the limit of strong interactions, and the phase boundaries of the equilibrium phase diagram.

Title: Nonequilibrium Fluctuation-Response Relations for State Observables
Authors: Krzysztof Ptaszynski, Timur Aslyamov, Massimiliano Esposito
Abstract: Time-integrated state observables, which quantify the fraction of time spent by the system in a specific pool of states, are important in many fields, such as chemical sensing or the theory of fluorescence spectroscopy. We derive exact identities, called Fluctuation-Response Relations (FRRs), that connect the fluctuations of such observables to their response to external perturbations in nonequilibrium steady state of Markov jump processes. Using these results, we derive a first known upper bound on fluctuations of state observables, as well as some new lower bounds. We further demonstrate how our identities provide a deeper understanding of the mechanistic origin of fluctuations and reveal their properties dependent only on system topology, which may be relevant for model inference using measured data.

Title: Fabrication of self-powered photodetector materials based on Ni-doped ZnO/p-Si heterojunctions
Authors: Eka Nurfani, Aldi Saputra, Novalia Pertiwi, Muhamad F. Arif
Abstract: In this paper, Ni-doped ZnO films were grown on a p-type silicon substrate via spray pyrolysis. The Ni dopant concentrations were varied by adjusting the weight ratio between Zinc Acetate Dehydrate (ZAD) and Nickel Chloride Hexahydrate (NCH), resulting in the ZnO, ZnO:Ni1%, and ZnO:Ni3% samples. Field-effect scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images revealed that Ni doping significantly reduced the nanostructure size from 326 nm (ZnO) to 146 nm (ZnO:Ni3%). Similarly, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis also shows the decrease of the crystallite size with increasing Ni doping, from 44 nm (ZnO) to 35 nm (ZnO:Ni3%). Current-voltage (I-V) measurements were conducted at a bias voltage of 0 and 5 V to examine electrical and self-powered photodetection properties. All samples demonstrate self-powered photodetector performance. At the bias of 0 V, the undoped ZnO exhibited a higher photo-to-dark-current ratio (162) as compared to ZnO:Ni1% (18) and ZnO:Ni3% (16). The ZnO:Ni3% samples displayed faster rise (0.4 s) and fall times (1.7 s) as compared to the pure ZnO (10.8 s for rise time and 9.1 s for fall time), highlighting their potential for applications requiring rapid photoresponse. The findings provide valuable insights into optimizing the performance of ZnO-based photodetectors through controlled Ni doping, enabling advancements in self-powered photodetection technology for energy-efficient optoelectronic devices.

Title: Nodal superconducting gap structure and topological surface states of UTe$_2$
Authors: Hans Christiansen, Max Geier, Brian M. Andersen, Andreas Kreisel
Abstract: The heavy-fermion compound UTe$_2$ is a candidate for hosting intrinsic spin-triplet superconductivity. At present, however, the type of triplet Cooper pairing realized in UTe$_2$ remains unknown, which calls for further experimental and theoretical investigations. In this paper, we develop a microscopic minimal model for the superconducting phases of UTe$_2$ based on recent findings in the description of its low-energy normal state electronic properties. We apply the resulting theoretical model to extract the nodal gap properties of the allowed superconducting ground states, and determine their associated topological surface states on the experimentally relevant (0-11) cleave plane. We find that the Fermi surface of UTe$_2$ enforces additional point nodes in excess to the point nodes imposed by symmetry, which may reconcile several experiments seemingly in conflict with B$_{2u}$ or B$_{3u}$ pairing symmetries. Furthermore, we map out the in-gap Majorana surface-bound modes existing on the (0-11) surface, and discuss their potential for additional insight into the pairing structure of UTe$_2$.

Title: Effects of time-periodic drive in the linear response for planar-Hall set-ups with Weyl and multi-Weyl semimetals
Authors: Ipsita Mandal
Abstract: We investigate the influence of a time-periodic drive on three-dimensional Weyl and multi-Weyl semimetals in planar-Hall/planar-thermal-Hall set-ups. The drive is modelled here by circularly-polarized electromagnetic fields, whose effects are incorporated by a combination of the Floquet theorem and the van Vleck perturbation theory, applicable in the high-frequency limit. We evaluate the longitudinal and in-plane transverse components of the linear-response coefficients using the semiclassical Boltzmann formalism, thereby demonstrating the explicit analytical expressions of the conductivity for large frequencies. Our results corroborate the fact that the topological charges of the corresponding semimetals etch their trademark signatures in these transport properties, which can be detected in appropriate experiments.

Title: Neodymium ions as charge reservoir in NdNiO$_2$: from lack of long range order to electron-doping-induced antiferromagnetism
Authors: Adam Kłosiński, Roman Drachynskyi, Krzysztof Wohlfeld, Wojciech Brzezicki
Abstract: We study magnetism in the electron-doped infinite-layer nickelate NdNiO$_2$. We perform an unrestricted Hartree-Fock calculation for a tight-binding model which contains both nickel and neodymium orbitals. We reproduce the self-doping effect, which is the escape of charge onto the neodymium bands. By fixing all free parameters to realistic values we find that undoped NdNiO$_2$ lies right {\it outside} the antiferromagnetic (AFM) region of the phase diagram. This is consistent with experiments, which find no long-range order in the ground state of NdNiO$_2$, yet see short-range AFM correlations and broad magnetic excitations. We also find that the self-doping effect leads to a dramatic increase in the stability of the AFM solution upon electron doping -- a behavior that is strikingly different from what is, for instance, observed in the cuprates. Finally, for smaller charge transfer energies than suggested for NdNiO$_2$, the self-doping effect may be quite strong and stabilise various stripe configurations already on the mean-field level.

Title: Optical lattice quantum simulator of dynamics beyond Born-Oppenheimer
Authors: Javier Argüello-Luengo, Alejandro González-Tudela, J. Ignacio Cirac
Abstract: Here, we propose a platform based on ultra-cold fermionic molecules trapped in optical lattices to simulate nonadiabatic effects, as they appear in certain molecular dynamical problems. The idea consists of a judicious choice of two rotational states as the simulated electronic or nuclear degrees of freedom, in which their dipolar interactions induce the required attractive or repulsive interactions between them. We benchmark our proposal by studying the scattering of an electron or a proton against a hydrogen atom, showing the effect of electronic exchange and inelastic ionization as the mass ratio between the simulated nuclei and electrons -- a tunable experimental parameter in our simulator -- becomes comparable. These benchmarks illustrate how the simulator can qualitatively emulate phenomena like those appearing in molecular dynamical problems even if the simulated interaction occurs in two-dimensions with a dipolar scaling. Beyond the molecular implementation proposed here, our proposal can be readily extrapolated to other atomic platforms, e.g., based on fermionic Rydberg atoms.

Title: Graph theory and tunable slow dynamics in quantum East Hamiltonians
Authors: Heiko Georg Menzler, Mari Carmen Bañuls, Fabian Heidrich-Meisner
Abstract: We show how graph theory concepts can provide an insight into the origin of slow dynamics in systems with kinetic constraints. In particular, we observe that slow dynamics is related to the presence of strong hierarchies between nodes on the Fock-space graph in the particle occupation basis, which encodes configurations connected by a given Hamiltonian. To quantify hierarchical structures, we develop a measure of centrality of the nodes, which is applicable to generic Hamiltonian matrices and inspired by established centrality measures from graph theory. We illustrate these ideas in the quantum East (QE) model. We introduce several ways of detuning nodes in the corresponding graph that alter the hierarchical structure, defining a family of QE models. We numerically demonstrate how these detunings affect the degree of non-ergodicity on finite systems, as evidenced by both the time dependence of density autocorrelations and eigenstate properties in the detuned QE models.

Title: Vector pulse magnet
Authors: Kosuke Noda, Kenta Seki, Dilip Bhoi, Kazuyuki Matsubayashi, Kazuto Akiba, Akihiko Ikeda
Abstract: The underlying symmetry of the crystal, electronic structure, and magnetic structure manifests itself in the anisotropy of materials' properties, which is a central topic of the present condensed matter research. However, it demands such a considerable effort to fill the explorable space that only a small part has been conquered. We report a vector pulse magnet (VPM) as an alternative experimental technique to control the direction of applied magnetic fields, which may complement the conventional methods with its characteristic features. The VPM combines a conventional pulse magnet and a vector magnet. The VPM can create vector pulsed magnetic fields and swiftly rotating pulsed magnetic fields. As a demonstration, the three-dimensional magnetoresistance measurement of a highly oriented pyrolytic graphite is carried out using the AC four-probe method at 4.5 K and 6 T. The two-dimensional electronic structure of graphite is visualized in the three-dimensional magnetoresistance data. One can uncover the rotational and time-reversal symmetry of materials using a VPM and a variety of measurement techniques.

Title: Diffusion-entropy scaling across dimensions
Authors: Nayana Venkatareddy, Mohd Moid, Prabal K. Maiti, Biman Bagchi
Abstract: A quantitative relationship between the diffusion coefficient $D$ of a tagged particle in a liquid and the entropy $S$ of that liquid has long been sought, as it would allow entropy to be inferred directly from diffusion measurements and transport properties to be predicted from thermodynamic information. Here, we employ extensive computer simulations to independently compute both $D$ and $S$ for Lennard-Jones (LJ) liquids and for water across a wide range of thermodynamic state points. Our study covers two and three dimensions for both systems, and additionally explores one-dimensional confinement for water. We find that the ratio of diffusion coefficients between two states follows an almost perfect exponential dependence on their entropy difference. For LJ liquids, the exponential prefactor exhibits a pronounced dependence on dimensionality $d$, consistent in trend but quantitatively distinct from theoretical predictions. In contrast, water shows a strikingly weak dimensionality $d$ dependence, deviating from theory, which we attribute to the dominant role of jump diffusion. Remarkably, the exponential diffusion-entropy relationship persists even when translational and rotational contributions to entropy are separated and considered individually. This robustness suggests that entropy provides a unifying measure governing particle mobility in liquids, largely independent of microscopic mechanisms or dimensional constraints.

Title: Next-generation EDIpack: A Lanczos-based package for quantum impurity models featuring general broken-symmetry phases, flexible bath topologies and multi-platform interoperability
Authors: Lorenzo Crippa, Igor Krivenko, Samuele Giuli, Gabriele Bellomia, Alexander Kowalski, Francesco Petocchi, Alberto Scazzola, Markus Wallerberger, Giacomo Mazza, Luca de Medici, Giorgio Sangiovanni, Massimo Capone, Adriano Amaricci
Abstract: We present a next-generation version of EDIpack, a flexible, high-performance numerical library using Lanczos-based exact diagonalization to solve generic quantum impurity problems, such as those introduced in Dynamical Mean-Field Theory to describe extended strongly correlated materials. This new release efficiently solves impurity problems allowing for different broken-symmetry solutions, including superconductivity, featuring local spin-orbit coupling and/or electron-phonon coupling. It provides quick access to dynamical correlation functions on the entire complex frequency plane at zero and low-temperatures. The modular architecture of the software not only provides Fortran APIs but also includes bindings to C/C++, interfaces with Python and Julia or with TRIQS and w2dynamics research platforms, thus ensuring unprecedented level of inter-operability. The outlook includes further extensions to study quantum materials and cold atoms quantum simulators, as well as quantum information applications.

Title: Critical surface phase behavior governs hydrophobic attraction between extended solutes
Authors: Nigel B. Wilding, Francesco Turci
Abstract: Hydrophobic interactions are central to biological self-assembly and soft matter organization, yet their microscopic origins remain debated. A key hallmark is the strengthening of attraction between hydrophobic solutes with increasing temperature, a feature often attributed to entropy changes from disrupted hydrogen bonding in water. Here we present an alternative framework based on surface phase behavior, supported by extensive molecular dynamics simulations. Using metadynamics, we quantify the solvent-mediated effective potential between nanometer-scale hydrophobic solutes in the monatomic water (mW) model, the SPCE water model, and a Lennard-Jones solvent. We develop a morphometric model which incorporates a scaling theory of critical drying, linking the range and strength of hydrophobic attraction to interfacial thermodynamics and proximity to vapor-liquid coexistence. The model reproduces the effective potential across diverse solute sizes, degrees of hydrophobicity, and thermodynamic states. Our simulations recover the inverse temperature dependence of hydrophobicity, showing it arises generically from rapid thermal expansion of the solvation shell.

Title: Faceting transition in aluminum as a grain boundary phase transition
Authors: Yoonji Choi, Tobias Brink
Abstract: Grain boundaries facet due to anisotropic grain boundary energies: While the faceted boundary has a larger area than the corresponding straight boundary, a significantly lower energy of the facets compared to a straight segment can drive the faceting. This picture is complicated by faceting/defaceting transitions where the free energy difference between the two states depends on the temperature. Such transitions have been observed and modeled before, but their exact nature was not fully understood. Here, we use atomistic computer simulations to show that a well known faceting transition in $\Sigma 3$ [111] tilt grain boundaries in Al is in fact a grain boundary phase transition (also called complexion transition). This means that the faceted and defaceted boundaries are associated with different atomic structures, which have different thermodynamic stability ranges. At low temperatures, the grain boundary phase associated with faceting is stable, while at high temperatures the flat grain boundary phase is stable. We also report on our thorough tests of Al interatomic potentials for this purpose, which include comparisons to density-functional theory calculations. Our chosen potential performs well for our grain boundaries. As a consequence we were able to obtain results that align with previous experimental results.

Title: Computing dielectric spectra in molecular dynamics simulations: using a cavity to disentangle self and cross correlations
Authors: Marceau Hénot
Abstract: Dielectric spectra are typically obtained in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations by analyzing the fluctuations, in the absence of an applied electric field, of the total dipole moment of the simulation box. We compare this standard method with a protocol that focuses on a virtual cavity whose size is chosen to include short-range dipolar cross-correlations, while excluding long-range correlations that are affected by the choice of electrostatic boundary conditions. We tested this protocol on three non-polarizable systems with different dielectric permittivities. We showed that it produces the same dielectric spectra as the standard method while being less sensitive to noise. The question of the decomposition of a dielectric spectrum into self and cross contributions is discussed in the context of both methods. We propose that, for a liquid with a sufficiently high dielectric permittivity, the cavity protocol yields a self-spectrum consistent with the electrostatic boundary conditions applicable to the experimental situation.

Title: Particle-scale origin of quadrupolar non-affine displacement fields in granular solids
Authors: Evan P. Willmarth, Weiwei Jin, Dong Wang, Amit Datye, Udo D. Schwarz, Mark D. Shattuck, Corey S. O'Hern
Abstract: In this work, we identify the local structural defects that control the non-affine displacement fields in jammed disk packings subjected to athermal, quasistatic (AQS) simple shear. While complex non-affine displacement fields typically occur during simple shear, isolated effective quadrupoles are also observed and their probability increases with increasing pressure. We show that the emergence of an isolated effective quadrupole requires the breaking of an interparticle contact that is aligned with low-frequency, spatially extended vibrational modes. Since the Eshelby inhomogeneity problem gives rise to quadrupolar displacement fields in continuum materials, we reformulate and implement Eshelby's equivalent inclusion method (EIM) for jammed disk packings. Using EIM, we show that we can reconstruct the non-affine displacement fields for jammed disk packings in response to applied shear as a sum of discrete Eshelby-like defects that are caused by mismatches in the local stiffnesses of triangles formed from Delaunay triangulation of the disk centers.

Title: Fractional Brownian Motion with Negative Hurst Exponent
Authors: Baruch Meerson, Pavel V. Sasorov
Abstract: Fractional Brownian motion (fBm) is an important scale-invariant Gaussian non-Markovian process with stationary increments, which serves as a prototypical example of a system with long-range temporal correlations and anomalous diffusion. The fBm is traditionally defined for the Hurst exponent $H$ in the range \( 0 < H < 1 \). Here we extend this definition to the regime \( -1/2 < H < 0 \). The extended fBm is not a pointwise process, so we regularize it via a local temporal averaging with a narrow filter. The resulting process is both very rough and persistent, that is long-range positively correlated. In addition, this process is stationary. The stationarity implies a complete arrest of diffusion in this region of $H$. We also study another closely related Gaussian process: the stationary fractional Ornstein--Uhlenbeck (fOU) process, extended to the range \( -1/2 < H < 0 \) and smoothed in the same way as the fBm. Remarkably, the smoothed fOU process turns out to be insensitive to the strength of the confining potential. Finally, we determine the optimal paths of the conditioned fBm and fOU processes for \( -1/2 < H < 0 \). In the marginal case \( H = 0 \), our results match continuously with known results for the traditionally defined fBm and fOU processes.

Abstract: Identifying useful sorbent materials for direct air capture (DAC) from humid air remains a challenge. We present the Open DAC 2025 (ODAC25) dataset, a significant expansion and improvement upon ODAC23 (Sriram et al., ACS Central Science, 10 (2024) 923), comprising nearly 60 million DFT single-point calculations for CO$_2$, H$_2$O, N$_2$, and O$_2$ adsorption in 15,000 MOFs. ODAC25 introduces chemical and configurational diversity through functionalized MOFs, high-energy GCMC-derived placements, and synthetically generated frameworks. ODAC25 also significantly improves upon the accuracy of DFT calculations and the treatment of flexible MOFs in ODAC23. Along with the dataset, we release new state-of-the-art machine-learned interatomic potentials trained on ODAC25 and evaluate them on adsorption energy and Henry's law coefficient predictions.

Title: Ferromagnetic and Spin-Glass Finite-Temperature Order but no Antiferromagnetic Order in the d=1 Ising Model with Long-Range Power-Law Interactions
Authors: E. Can Artun, A. Nihat Berker
Abstract: The d=1 Ising ferromagnet and spin glass with long-range power-law interactions J r^-a is studied for all interaction range exponents a by a renormalization-group transformation that simultaneously projects local ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. In the ferromagnetic case, J>0, a finite-temperature ferromagnetic phase occurs for interaction range 0.74<a<2. The second-order phase transition temperature monotonically decreases between these two limits. At a=2, the phase transition becomes first order, as predicted by rigorous results. For a>2, the phase transition temperature discontinuously drops to zero and for a>2 there is no ordered phase above zero temperature, also as predicted by rigorous results. At the other end, on approaching a=0.74 from above, namely increasing the range of the interaction, the phase transition temperature diverges to infinity, meaning that, at all non-infinite temperatures, the system is ferromagnetically ordered. Thus, the equivalent-neighbor interactions regime is entered before (a > 0) the neighbors become equivalent, namely before the interactions become equal for all separations. The critical exponents alpha,beta, gamma,delta,eta,nu are calculated, from a large recursion matrix, varying as function of a. For antiferromagnetic J<0, all triplets of spins at all ranges have competing interactions and this highly frustrated system does not have an ordered phase. In the spin-glass system, where all couplings for all separations are randomly ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic (with probability p), a finite-temperatures spin-glass phase is obtained in the absence of antiferromagnetic phase. In the spin-glass phase, the signature chaotic behavior under scale change occurs in a richer version than previously: In the long-range interaction of this system, the interactions at every separation become chaotic, yielding a piecewise chaotic interaction function.

Title: Measuring irreversibility by counting: a random coarse-graining framework
Authors: Ruicheng Bao, Naruo Ohga, Sosuke Ito
Abstract: Thermodynamic irreversibility is a fundamental concept in statistical physics, yet its experimental measurement remains challenging, especially for complex systems. We introduce a novel random coarse-graining framework to identify model-free measures of irreversibility in complex many-body systems. These measures are constructed from the asymmetry of cross-correlation functions between suitably chosen observables, providing rigorous lower bounds on entropy production. For many-particle systems, we propose a particularly practical implementation that divides real space into virtual boxes and monitors particle number densities within them, requiring only simple counting from video microscopy, without single-particle tracking, trajectory reconstruction, or prior knowledge of interactions. Owing to its generality and minimal data requirements, the random coarse-graining framework offers broad applicability across diverse nonequilibrium systems.

Title: Atom-surface interaction induced by quenched monopolar charge disorder
Authors: Bing-Sui Lu
Abstract: We study the modification to the energy level shifts of an atom induced by the quenched monopolar charge disorder inside the bulk of neighboring dielectric slabs as well as their surfaces. By assuming that the charge disorder follows Gaussian statistics with a zero mean, we find that the disorder generally results in a downward shift of the energy levels, which corresponds to an attractive force that can compete with and overcome the nonresonant Casimir-Polder force for sufficiently large atom-surface separations $z_0$. For an atom near a single semi-infinite slab with bulk (surface) charge disorder, the shift decays as $z_0^{-1}$ ($z_0^{-2}$). For both surface and bulk disorder, the shift is proportional to the variance of the charge disorder density. In addition, we investigate the behavior of the charge disorder-induced energy level shift for an atom confined to a vacuum gap between two coplanar and semi-infinite slabs of the same dielectric material, finding that the position of net zero disorder-induced force occurs closer to the surface of the slab with the smaller charge disorder variance.

Title: Machine Learning Time Propagators for Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory Simulations
Authors: Karan Shah, Attila Cangi
Abstract: Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is a widely used method to investigate electron dynamics under external time-dependent perturbations such as laser fields. In this work, we present a machine learning approach to accelerate electron dynamics simulations based on real time TDDFT using autoregressive neural operators as time-propagators for the electron density. By leveraging physics-informed constraints and featurization, and high-resolution training data, our model achieves superior accuracy and computational speed compared to traditional numerical solvers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on a class of one-dimensional diatomic molecules under the influence of a range of laser parameters. This method has potential in enabling on-the-fly modeling of laser-irradiated molecules and materials by utilizing fast machine learning predictions in a large space of varying experimental parameters of the laser.

Title: Energy dependent Chemical Interface Damping induced by 1-Decanethiol Self-Assembled Monolayer on Au(111)
Authors: Maurice Pfeiffer, Gregor B. Vonbun-Feldbauer, Jacob B. Khurgin, Olga Matts, Ahmed Shqer, Nadiia Mameka, Manfred Eich, Alexander Petrov
Abstract: The chemical interface damping (CID) effect increases the collision frequency of free electrons in metals by changes of the metal surface. We have now experimentally disentangled the two contributions to CID: induced roughness and direct charge transfer. The latter is an important area of research in photoelectrochemistry with potential applications in light-induced chemical reactions. We present a broadband investigation of the CID effect on Au(111) covered by a self-assembled monolayer of decanethiol. Spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements show a photon energy dependent increase of collision frequency. We observe a constant, photon energy independent contribution, which is attributed to induced roughness and a contribution that linearly increases with photon energy from about 1 eV upwards which we attribute to direct charge transfer. The onset of the charge transfer mechanism corresponds to occupied orbitals of thiols bound to the Au surface, as confirmed by density functional theory calculations.

Title: Correlation Matrix Method for Phonon Quasiparticles
Authors: Wenjing Li, Yong Lu, Fawei Zheng
Abstract: Phonon anharmonicity is ubiquitous in real materials and is crucial for understanding thermal properties and phase stability. In this work, we show that anharmonic phonon modes can be obtained by maximizing their lifetimes during fitting the atomic trajectory. We prove that all information about these quasiparticles is contained in two small correlation matrices $\mathcal{S}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$, which can be constructed directly from molecular dynamics simulations. Based on these matrices, we proposed an optimization scheme, which allows us to efficiently determine temperature-dependent phonon modes along with their frequencies and lifetimes. We verified this method by applying it to silicon and cubic CaSiO$_3$, where it successfully captured their temperature-dependent phonon behaviors and the well-known phonon softening in cubic CaSiO$_3$. This theory provides a convenient tool for investigating phonon quasiparticles and can be extended to study other quasiparticles, such as electrons, holes, and magnons.

Title: Quantum Otto heat engine and quantum Mpemba effect in quasiperiodic systems
Authors: Ao Zhou, Feng Lu, Shujie Cheng, Gao Xianlong
Abstract: We study a one-dimensional quasiperiodic tight-binding model with simultaneous off-diagonal (hopping) and diagonal (onsite) modulations. Using the inverse participation ratio and the wave-packet centroid, we construct localization-delocalization phase diagrams for both equilibrium and nonequilibrium steady states. We analyze the robustness of initial-state properties under dissipation and characterize dissipation-induced localization-delocalization transitions (and their reversals) in detail. Trace-distance dynamics provide evidence for a quantum Mpemba effect: states prepared farther from the steady state can relax faster than states initialized closer to it. We propose a starting-line hypothesis that explains the presence or absence of this effect across parameter regimes. In addition, we examine thermodynamic functionality and find that the localized phase favors the realization of quantum heaters. These results advance the understanding of steady-state phase transitions and relaxation dynamics in dissipatively driven quasiperiodic systems, and broaden the thermodynamic landscape of quasiperiodic platforms.

Title: Supervised and Unsupervised Deep Learning Applied to the Majority Vote Model
Authors: J. F. Silva Neto, D. S. M. Alencar, L. T. Brito, G. A. Alves, F. W. S. Lima, A. Macedo-Filho, R. S. Ferreira, T. F. A. Alves
Abstract: We employ deep learning techniques to investigate the critical properties of the continuous phase transition in the majority vote model. In addition to deep learning, principal component analysis is utilized to analyze the transition. For supervised learning, dense neural networks are trained on spin configuration data generated via the kinetic Monte Carlo method. Using independently simulated configuration data, the neural network accurately identifies the critical point on both square and triangular lattices. Classical unsupervised learning with principal component analysis reproduces the magnetization and enables estimation of critical exponents, typically obtained via Monte Carlo importance sampling. Furthermore, deep unsupervised learning is performed using variational autoencoders, which reconstruct input spin configurations and generate artificial outputs. The autoencoders detect the phase transition through the loss function, quantifying the preservation of essential data features. We define a correlation function between the real and reconstructed data, and find that this correlation function is universal at the critical point. Variational autoencoders also serve as generative models, producing artificial spin configurations.

Title: A General Model for Static Contact Angles
Authors: Carlos E Colosqui
Abstract: The problem of contact angle and hysteresis determination has direct implications for engineering applications of wetting, colloid and surface science. Significant technical challenges can arise under real-world operating conditions, because the static contact angle is strongly influenced by contamination at the liquid-solid and liquid-vapor interfaces, chemical aging over long times, and environmental variables such as relative humidity and temperature. Analytical models that account for these real-world effects are therefore highly desirable to guide the rational design of robust applications. This work proposes a unified and simple-to-use model that expands Young's local thermodynamic approach to consider surfaces with topographic features of general geometry and varying degrees of liquid infiltration. The unified model recovers classical wetting limits (Wenzel, Cassie-Baxter, and hemiwicking), accounts for observable intermediate states (e.g., impregnating Cassie), and identifies a new limiting state with potential realizability: a Cassie state accompanied by a precursor film, termed the Inverse Wenzel state.

Title: Competing Supramolecular Structures: Dielectric and Rheological Spectroscopy on Glycerol/Propanol Mixtures
Authors: Jan Philipp Gabriel
Abstract: Significant progress has been made in recent years in understanding the dynamics of pure hydrogen-bonded systems by analyzing the spectral shape of various susceptibilities. Monohydroxy- and polyalcohols are currently considered to form transient supramolecular hydrogen-bonded structures in the form of chains, rings, and networks. This complex dynamic behavior has been identified in network-forming glycerol and chain-forming propanol by combining dielectric and light-scattering spectra. We apply these concepts to study the combined dielectric and shear rheological spectral shape of glycerol/propanol mixtures. Glycerol differs from propanol by having two additional hydroxy groups, which leads to significant differences in melting temperatures($\Delta T_{\textbf{m}}$\,=\,291\,K\,-\,147\,K\,=\,143\,K) and glass transition temperatures ($\Delta T_{\textbf{g}}$\,=\,190\,K-\,98\,K\,=\,92\,K). The strong difference results in two distinct calorimetric glass transitions at a molar glycerol concentration of $\chi_{gly}=0.3$, as well as a change in the shear modulus $G_{\infty}$ between $\chi_{gly}=0.5$ and 0.7. Performing a comprehensive analysis of the three applied experimental techniques leads to the conclusion that dielectric spectroscopy monitors the evolution of supramolecular chain and network structures and that the mechanical properties depend heavily on the formed hydrogen-bonded network. A strong dynamical heterogeneity is observed and manifests itself in two distinguishable glass transitions in dielectric spectroscopy and calorimetry. The presented chain/network mixture is dynamically highly heterogeneous when compared to the rather narrow dynamical heterogeneity in the network/network mixture Water/Glycerol.

Title: Barrier Electrostatics and Contact Engineering for Ultra-Wide Bandgap AlGaN HFETs
Authors: Seungheon Shin, Can Cao, Jon Pratt, Yinxuan Zhu, Brianna A. Klein, Andrew Armstrong, Andrew A. Allerman, Siddharth Rajan
Abstract: We report ultra-wide bandgap (UWBG) AlGaN heterostructure field-effect transistors (HFETs) exhibiting a high breakdown field (> 5.3 MV/cm) and a low contact resistance (~1.55 {\Omega}mm), tailored for high-power radiofrequency applications. A split-doped barrier architecture, employing two distinct doping concentrations, is shown to enhance both the breakdown field and contact resistance. This design enables a state-of-the-art combination of maximum drain current (487 mA/mm) and breakdown field, along with a high cutoff frequency of 7.2 GHz. These results demonstrate a viable pathway to push device performance toward the material limits while minimizing contact resistance in UWBG AlGaN HFETs, paving the way for next-generation high-power, high-frequency applications.

Title: Interacting-cluster spin liquids with robust flat bands evolving into higher-rank half-moon phases and topological Lifshitz transitions
Authors: Naïmo Davier, Ludovic D.C. Jaubert
Abstract: Classical spin liquids are disordered magnetic phases, governed by local constraints that often give rise to flat-band ground states. When constraints take the form of a zero-divergence field within a cluster of spins, the spin liquid is often described by an emergent Coulomb gauge theory. Here we introduce an interaction $\eta$ between these clusters of spins which compete with the zero-divergence field. Using a framework embracing both the connectivity matrices of graph theory and the topology of band structures, we develop a generic theory of interacting-cluster Hamiltonians. We show how flat bands remain at zero energy up to finite interaction $\eta$, until a dispersive band becomes negative, stabilizing a spiral spin liquid with a hypersurface of ground-state manifold in reciprocal space. This hypersurface serves as a mold for the apparition of the half-moon patterns in the equal-time structure factor. Our generic approach enables to extend the notion of half moons to the perturbation of higher-rank Coulomb fields and pinch-line spin liquids. In particular, multi-fold half moons appear when unconventional gauge charges, such as potential fractons, are stabilized in the ground state. Finally, half-moon phases can be tuned across the equivalent of a Lifshitz transition, when the hypersurface manifold changes topology.

Title: High temperature superconductivity with giant pressure effect in 3D networks of boron doped ultra-thin carbon nanotubes in the pores of ZSM-5 zeolite
Authors: Yibo Wang, Tsin Hei Koo, Runqing Huang, Yat Hei Ng, Timothée Tianyu Lortz, Ting Zhang, Wai Ming Chan, Yuxiao Hou, Jie Pan, Rolf Lortz, Ning Wang, Ping Sheng
Abstract: We have fabricated three-dimensional (3D) networks of ultrathin carbon nanotubes (CNTs) within the ~5-Angstrom diameter pores of zeolite ZSM-5 crystals using the chemical vapour deposition (CVD) process. The 1D electronic characteristics of ultrathin CNTs are characterized by van Hove singularities in the density of states. Boron doping was strategically employed to tune the Fermi energy near a van Hove singularity, which is supported by extensive ab-initio calculations, while the 3D network structure ensures the formation of a phase-coherent bulk superconducting state under a 1D to 3D crossover. We report characteristic signatures of superconductivity using four complementary experimental methods: magnetization, specific heat, resistivity, and point-contact spectroscopy, all consistently support a critical temperature Tc at ambient conditions ranging from 220 to 250 K. In particular, point-contact spectroscopy revealed a multigap nature of superconductivity with a large ~30 meV leading gap, in rough agreement with the prediction of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory of superconductivity. The differential conductance response displays a particle-hole symmetry and is tuneable between the tunnelling and Andreev limits via the transparency of the contact, as uniquely expected for a superconductor. Preliminary experiments also reveal a giant pressure effect which increases the Tc above the ambient temperature.

Title: Accelerating Quantum Relaxation via Temporary Reset: A Mpemba-Inspired Approach
Authors: Ruicheng Bao, Zhonghuai Hou
Abstract: Slow relaxation processes spanning widely separated timescales pose fundamental challenges for probing steady-state properties and engineering functional quantum systems, such as quantum heat engines and quantum computing devices. We introduce a protocol that enables significant acceleration of relaxation in general Markovian open quantum systems by temporarily coupling the system to a reset channel, inspired by the Mpemba effect. Crucially, this acceleration persists even when the slowest decaying Lindbladian modes form complex-conjugate pairs. Unlike previous approaches, which typically target a single mode, our protocol may suppress multiple relaxation modes simultaneously. This framework provides a versatile and experimentally feasible tool for controlling relaxation timescales, with broad implications for quantum thermodynamics, computation, and state preparation.

Title: Potential renormalisation, Lamb shift and mean-force Gibbs state -- to shift or not to shift?
Authors: Luis A. Correa, Jonas Glatthard
Abstract: Often, the microscopic interaction mechanism of an open quantum system gives rise to a `counter term' which renormalises the system Hamiltonian. Such term compensates for the distortion of the system's potential due to the finite coupling to the environment. Even if the coupling is weak, the counter term is, in general, not negligible. Similarly, weak-coupling master equations feature a number of `Lamb-shift terms' which, contrary to popular belief, cannot be neglected. Yet, the practice of vanishing both counter term and Lamb shift when dealing with master equations is almost universal; and, surprisingly, it can yield better results. By accepting the conventional wisdom, one may approximate the dynamics more accurately and, importantly, the resulting master equation is guaranteed to equilibrate to the correct steady state in the high-temperature limit. In this paper we discuss why is this the case. Specifically, we show that, if the potential distortion is small -- but non-negligible -- the counter term does not influence any dissipative processes to second order in the coupling. Furthermore, we show that, for large environmental cutoff, the Lamb-shift terms approximately cancel any coherent effects due to the counter term -- this renders the combination of both contributions irrelevant in practice. We thus provide precise conditions under which the open-system folklore regarding Lamb shift and counter terms is rigorously justified.

Title: Super-resolved anomalous diffusion: deciphering the joint distribution of anomalous exponent and diffusion coefficient
Authors: Yann Lanoiselée, Gianni Pagnini, Agnieszka Wyłomańska
Abstract: The molecular motion in heterogeneous media displays anomalous diffusion by the mean-squared displacement $\langle X^2(t) \rangle = 2 D t^\alpha$. Motivated by experiments reporting populations of the anomalous diffusion parameters $\alpha$ and $D$, we aim to disentangle their respective contributions to the observed variability when this last is due to a true population of these parameters and when it arises due to finite-duration recordings. We introduce estimators of the anomalous diffusion parameters on the basis of the time-averaged mean squared displacement and study their statistical properties. By using a copula approach, we derive a formula for the joint density function of their estimations conditioned on their actual values. The methodology introduced is indeed universal, it is valid for any Gaussian process and can be applied to any quadratic time-averaged statistics. We also explain the experimentally reported relation $D\propto\exp(\alpha c_1+c_2)$ for which we provide the exact expression. We finally compare our findings to numerical simulations of the fractional Brownian motion and quantify their accuracy by using the Hellinger distance.

Title: Stabilizer Scars
Authors: Jeremy Hartse, Lukasz Fidkowski, Niklas Mueller
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars are eigenstates in non-integrable isolated quantum systems that defy typical thermalization paradigms, violating the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis and quantum ergodicity. We identify exact analytic scar solutions in a 2+1 dimensional lattice gauge theory in a quasi-1d limit as zero-magic resource stabilizer states.

Title: Stabilizer Entanglement Enhances Magic Injection
Authors: Zong-Yue Hou, ChunJun Cao, Zhi-Cheng Yang
Abstract: Non-stabilizerness is a key resource for fault-tolerant quantum computation, yet its interplay with entanglement in dynamical settings remains underexplored. We address this by analyzing a well-controlled, analytically tractable setup, where we show that entanglement acts as a conduit that teleports magic across the system, thereby enhancing magic injection. Using exact calculations, we prove that when a Haar-random unitary $U_A$ is applied to a subsystem $A$ of an entangled stabilizer state, the total injected magic increases with the entanglement between $A$ and its complement. More generally, for any unitary $U_A$, we show that this enhancement is maximized when $A$ is maximally entangled with its complement, in which case the total injected magic is exactly given by the unitary stabilizer Rényi entropy we introduce. This quantity provides both a directly computable measure of unitary magic and a lower bound on the minimum number of $T$ gates required to synthesize $U_A$. We further extend our analysis to tripartite stabilizer entanglement, non-stabilizer entanglement, and magic injection via shallow-depth brickwork circuits, finding that the qualitative picture remains unchanged.

Title: Spatially-Controlled Planar Czochralski Growth of Low-Loss Phase Change Materials for Programmable Photonics

Abstract: Photonic integrated devices are progressively evolving beyond passive components into fully programmable systems, notably driven by the progress in chalcogenide phase-change materials (PCMs) for non-volatile reconfigurable nanophotonics. However, the stochastic nature of their crystal grain formation results in strong spatial and temporal crystalline inhomogeneities. Here, we propose the concept of spatially-controlled planar Czochralski growth, a novel method for programming the quasi-monocrystalline growth of low-loss Sb2S3 PCM, leveraging the seeded directional and progressive crystallization within confined channels. This guided crystallization method is experimentally shown to circumvent the current limitations of conventional PCM-based nanophotonic devices, including a multilevel non-volatile optical phase-shifter exploiting a silicon nitride-based Mach-Zehnder interferometer, and a programmable metasurface with spectrally reconfigurable bound state in the continuum. Precisely controlling the growth of PCMs to ensure uniform crystalline properties across large areas is the cornerstone for the industrial development of non-volatile reconfigurable photonic integrated circuits.

Title: Accurate crystal field Hamiltonians of single-ion magnets at mean-field cost
Authors: Linqing Peng, Shuanglong Liu, Xing Zhang, Xiao Chen, Chenghan Li, Hai-Ping Cheng, Garnet Kin-Lic Chan
Abstract: The effective crystal field Hamiltonian provides the key description of the electronic properties of single-ion magnets, but obtaining its parameters from ab initio computation is challenging. We introduce a simple approach to derive the effective crystal field Hamiltonian through density functional calculations of randomly rotated mean-field states within the low-energy manifold. In benchmarks on five lanthanide-based complexes, we find that we compute with mean-field cost an effective crystal field Hamiltonian that matches the state-of-the-art from much more expensive multi-configurational quantum chemistry methods. In addition, we are able to reproduce the experimental low-energy spectrum and magnetic properties with an accuracy exceeding prior attempts. Due to its low cost, our approach provides a crucial ingredient in the computational design of single-ion magnets with tailored physical properties and low-energy spectra.

Title: Optical theorem and generalized energy conservation for scattering of time-modulated waves
Authors: Erik Orvehed Hiltunen, John C. Schotland
Abstract: We introduce and study a generalized energy conservation relation for scattering of time-modulated waves, where conventional energy conservation does not hold. Based on this relation, we derive an optical theorem and compute the active power describing the power input or output due to scattering. Notably, the same system may be subject to energy gain, energy loss, or energy conservation depending on the frequency harmonics present in the wave field. Moreover, we show how the optical theorem derived herein may be used for image reconstruction based on measurements of the power. In particular, such measurements do not require information about the phase of the scattered field.

Title: Suppression of errors in collectively coded information
Authors: Martin J. Falk, Leon Zhou, Yoshiya J. Matsubara, Kabir Husain, Jack W. Szostak, Arvind Murugan
Abstract: Modern life largely transmits genetic information from mother to daughter through the duplication of single physically intact molecules that encode information. However, copying an extended molecule requires complex copying machinery and high fidelity that scales with the genome size to avoid the error catastrophe. Here, we explore these fidelity requirements in an alternative architecture, the virtual circular genome, in which no one physical molecule encodes the full genetic information. Instead, information is encoded and transmitted in a collective of overlapping and interacting segments. Using a model experimental system of a complex mixture of DNA oligomers that can partly anneal and extend off each other, we find that mutant oligomers are suppressed relative to a model without collective encoding. Through simulations and theory, we show that this suppression of mutants can be explained by competition for productive binding partners. As a consequence, information can be propagated robustly in a virtual circular genome even at mutation rates expected under prebiotic conditions.

Title: Fusion in the periodic Temperley-Lieb algebra: general definition of a bifunctor
Authors: Yacine Ikhlef, Alexi Morin-Duchesne
Abstract: The periodic Temperley-Lieb category consists of connectivity diagrams drawn on a ring with $N$ and $N'$ nodes on the outer and inner boundary, respectively. We consider families of modules, namely sequences of modules $\mathsf{M}(N)$ over the enlarged periodic Temperley-Lieb algebra for varying values of $N$, endowed with an action $\mathsf{M}(N') \to \mathsf{M}(N)$ of the diagrams. Examples of modules that can be organised into families are those arising in the RSOS model and in the XXZ spin-$\frac12$ chain, as well as several others constructed from link states. We construct a fusion product which outputs a family of modules from any pair of families. Its definition is inspired from connectivity diagrams drawn on a disc with two holes. It is thus defined in a way to describe intermediate states in lattice correlation functions. We prove that this fusion product is a bifunctor, and that it is distributive, commutative, and associative.

Title: Vibrational Fingerprints of Strained Polymers: A Spectroscopic Pathway to Mechanical State Prediction
Authors: Julian Konrad, Janina Mittelhaus, David M. Wilkins, Bodo Fiedler, Robert Meißner
Abstract: The vibrational response of polymer networks under load provides a sensitive probe of molecular deformation and a route to non-destructive diagnostics. Here we show that machine-learned force fields reproduce these spectroscopic fingerprints with quantum-level fidelity in realistic epoxy thermosets. Using MACE-OFF23 molecular dynamics, we capture the experimentally observed redshifts of para-phenylene stretching modes under tensile load, in contrast to the harmonic OPLS-AA model. These shifts correlate with molecular elongation and alignment, consistent with Badger's rule, directly linking vibrational features to local stress. To capture IR intensities, we trained a symmetry-adapted dipole moment model on representative epoxy fragments, enabling validation of strain responses. Together, these approaches provide chemically accurate and computationally accessible predictions of strain-dependent vibrational spectra. Our results establish vibrational fingerprints as predictive markers of mechanical state in polymer networks, pointing to new strategies for stress mapping and structural-health diagnostics in advanced materials.
