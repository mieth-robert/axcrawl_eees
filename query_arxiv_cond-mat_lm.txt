Title: Fine and Hyperfine Interactions with Multi-level Spin Relaxation of the purified Giese-Salt in Veterinary Medicine: Prussian Blue Compound Ammonium-Ferric-Hexacyano-Ferrate
Authors: Sascha Albert Bräuninger, Damian Alexander Motz, Sebastian Praetz, Felix Seewald, Katharina Strecker, Carla Vogt, Hans-Henning Klauss, Birgit Kanngießer, Hermann Seifert
Abstract: Ammonium ferric hexacyanoferrate is a veterinary-medical milestone and antidote against radiocesium, well-known as Giese-salt after the Chernobyl disaster fed to domestic and wild animals, which shows even a rich interplay of properties in nanostructural chemistry and ferromagnetism. Among the broad analytical techniques, the ambivalence of macroscopic micrometer-sized agglomerates and nanoparticle sizes, a suggested enlarged Fe(II)$-$C$\equiv$N$-$Fe(III) bond length by Fe K-edge XAFS results and multi-level spin relaxation in $^{57}$Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy are highlighted. This sets this underestimated compound in a new light, e.g., for modern biomedicine and biofunctionality, extending its essential importance in addition to hypothetical future nuclear incidents

Title: Peridynamic modeling of the crack velocity dependence via an incubation time fracture criterion
Authors: M. Ignatev, P. Weißgraeber, E. Oterkus, L. Radtke
Abstract: This study investigates one of the central problems of dynamic fracture mechanics, namely the dependence of the instantaneous stress intensity factor (SIF) on the crack propagation velocity. For this purpose, the well-known experiments by Ravi-Chandar and Knauss on brittle, amorphous Homalite-100 polymer plates are modeled using a peridynamic approach. The numerical model integrates the previously proposed remote stress fracture criterion into an incubation time fracture criterion. Results of numerical modeling indicate a significant variation in SIF values at an almost constant crack propagation velocity. Moreover, for higher crack propagation velocities, micro-branching is obtained numerically, leading to a larger scatter of SIF values. These effects were also observed in the experiments of Ravi-Chandar and Knauss, which provides new insights into the nature of the crack-velocity dependence of the Mode-I SIF.

Title: Altermagnetic superconducting diode effect from non-collinear compensated magnetism in Mn$_3$Pt
Authors: Constantin Schrade, Sujit Manna, Mathias S. Scheurer
Abstract: Altermagnets have recently emerged as a distinct class of magnetic systems that exhibit spin splitting of electronic bands while retaining zero net magnetization. This unique combination makes them a promising platform for time-reversal symmetry-breaking superconducting phenomena, although identifying concrete material platforms remains an important open challenge. Here, we develop a theory for the superconducting diode effect observed experimentally in a Mn$_3$Pt-superconductor heterostructure. Using both a symmetry analysis and model calculations on the breathing kagome lattice, we show how the altermagnetic spin textures in Mn$_3$Pt generate a spin splitting of the electronic bands that remains magnetization-free even in the presence of spin-orbit coupling and, upon taking into account the proximity coupling across the interface, produces a superconducting diode effect. We also demonstrate that the angular dependence of the critical current provides a probe of the magnetic order. We hope that our work will contribute to the understanding and further discovery of candidate materials for novel altermagnet-superconductor hybrid devices.

Title: Interlayer Charge-Transfer Ferroelectric Fluctuations as a Pairing Mechanism in van der Waals Superconductors
Authors: Ankan Biswas, Jagannath Sutradhar, Sudip Kumar Saha, Avraham Klein, Jonathan Ruhman
Abstract: Signatures of unconventional superconductivity have been reported in a wide range of van der Waals (vdW) materials. However, their microscopic origin remains unclear due to competing electronic orders, strong spin-orbit coupling, and structural instabilities in the normal state. Here we investigate the role of interlayer breathing and shear modes in superconducting vdW heterostructures. Contrary to conventional wisdom -- which assumes that weak interlayer bonding and large layer separation suppress electronic coupling to these modes -- we show that the associated charge transfer can generate a substantial pairing interaction. We develop a theory of superconductivity mediated by such interlayer modes and demonstrate that proximity to a ferroelectric or antiferroelectric quantum critical point provides a strong-coupling pairing channel. Within a two-dimensional model with SU(2) symmetry and in-plane isotropy, we find an accidental degeneracy between interlayer triplet states, which can occur even for an $s$-wave in-plane gap. We further show that Josephson coupling between layers, arising from either static magnetism or induced by paramagnetic correlations, can stabilize a time-reversal-symmetry-breaking superconducting state of the $s+i\,s$ type, which couples to magnetization when at least two mirror symmetries are absent. Our results are directly applicable to candidate chiral vdW superconductors such as 4Hb-TaS$_2$ and to sliding ferroelectric metals, exemplified by bilayer MoTe$_2$. More broadly, our work identifies ferroelectric fluctuations as a promising route to unconventional pairing in vdW systems and motivates experimental searches for chiral multicomponent superconductivity.

Title: Critical aging and relaxation dynamics in long-range systems
Authors: Valerio Pagni, Friederike Ihssen, Nicolò Defenu
Abstract: We study the dynamical scaling of long-range $\mathrm{O}(N)$ models after a sudden quench to the critical temperature, using the functional renormalization group approach. We characterize both short-time aging and long-time relaxation as a function of the symmetry index $N$, the interaction range decay exponent $\sigma$ and the dimension $d$. Our results substantially improve on perturbative predictions, as demonstrated by benchmarks against Monte Carlo simulations and the large-$N$ limit. Finally, we demonstrate that long-range systems increase the performance of critical heat engines with respect to a local active medium.

Title: Light-Induced Even-Parity Unidirectional Spin Splitting in Coplanar Antiferromagnets
Authors: Di Zhu, Dongling Liu, Zheng-Yang Zhuang, Zhigang Wu, Zhongbo Yan
Abstract: When a coplanar antiferromagnet (AFM) with $xy$-plane magnetic moments exhibits a spin-split band structure and unidirectional spin polarization along $z$, the spin polarization is forced to be an odd function of momentum by the fundamental symmetry $[\bar{C}_{2z}\|\mathcal{T}]$. Coplanar AFMs displaying such odd-parity unidirectional spin splittings are known as odd-parity magnets. In this work, we propose the realization of their missing even-parity counterparts. We begin by deriving the symmetry conditions required for an even-parity, out-of-plane spin splitting. We then show that irradiating a spin-degenerate coplanar AFM with circularly polarized light lifts the $[\bar{C}_{2z}|\mathcal{T}]$ constraint, dynamically generating this even-parity state. Specifically, the light-induced unidirectional spin splitting exhibits a $d$-wave texture in momentum space, akin to that of a $d$-wave altermagnet. We prove this texture's robustness against spin canting and show it yields a unique clover-like angular dependence in the Drude spin conductivity. Our work demonstrates that optical driving can generate novel spin-split phases in coplanar AFMs, thereby diversifying the landscape of materials exhibiting distinct spin splittings.

Title: Altermagnetic Superconducting Diode Effect in Mn$_{3}$Pt/Nb Heterostructures
Authors: Saurav Sachin, Mathias S. Scheurer, Constantin Schrade, Sujit Manna
Abstract: Compensated magnetic orders that can split the spin-degeneracy of electronic bands have become a very active field of research. As opposed to spin-orbit coupling, the splitting resulting from these "altermagnets" is not a small relativistic correction and, in contrast to ferromagnets, not accompanied by a net magnetization and large stray fields. In particular, the theoretical analysis of the interplay of altermagnetism and superconductivity has taken center stage, while experimental investigations of their coexistence remain in their infancy. We here study heterostructures consisting of Nb thins films interfaced with the $T_1$ and $T_2$ phases of Mn$_3$Pt. These non-collinear magnetic states can be thought of as descendants from the same altermagnetic order in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. We demonstrate the non-trivial impact on the superconducting state of Nb, which exhibits a zero-field superconducting diode effect, despite the compensated ($T_2$) and nearly-compensated ($T_1$) magnetic order; the diode efficiencies can reach large values (up to 50$\%$). The diode effect is found to be highly sensitive to the form of the magnetic order, illustrating its potential as a symmetry probe. The complex magnetic field and temperature dependence hint at a rich interplay of multiple contributing mechanisms. Our results define a new materials paradigm for dissipationless spintronics and magnetization-free diode functionality, while motivating further exploration of non-collinear altermagnetic superconductors.

Title: The interplay between topology, defects and chiral order in the nearly-commensurate charge density wave of 1T-TaS2
Authors: Michael Verhage, Martin Lee, Kees Flipse
Abstract: In 1T-TaS2, the nearly-commensurate charge density wave (NC-CDW) exhibits emergent chirality, a property of interest for technological applications such as memory. We study the relationship between chirality and topological defects using holographic analysis of scanning tunneling microscopy data. By characterizing the CDW order parameter, we uncover distinct topological defects and define a chiral order parameter that connects directly to them. Our analysis distinguishes between vortex pairs in high-strain areas and glass-like soliton or discommensurations networks. We propose that perturbations, such as strain, drive vortex nucleation and annihilation, leaving solitons or discommensurations pinned by disorder. Electric fields induce soliton and discommensurations movement, causing chiral switching via localized order parameter melting, enabling controllable room-temperature chirality

Title: Multifractality, percolation threshold and critical point of a nuclear reactor
Authors: V. V. Ryazanov
Abstract: A multifractal model is used to analyze neutron evolution within a reactor. For chain reactions, various characteristics of multifractal neutron behavior have been determined. These include the dimension of the multifractal carrier, information and correlation dimensions, the entropy of the fractal set, maximum and minimum dimension values, and the multifractal spectrum function. The geometric features of a multifractal allow for the description of a stochastic system consisting of hierarchically subordinate statistical ensembles, which are characterized by Cayley trees. A stationary distribution over hierarchical levels is established, which follows the Tsallis power law. The text also points out some potential applications of fractal patterns in nuclear reactor theory. The chance of percolation, which is when we see a state in the Bethe lattice where there's at least one continuous path through neighboring conducting nodes all the way across, is similar to the likelihood of a self-sustaining fission chain reaction happening. When this probability hits a critical point, we get a (conditionally) infinite cluster of neutrons forming. The percolation probability, influenced by how long the reactor has been running and its size, is linked to the reactor's criticality. We take a look at how the neutron multiplication factor behaves over time. We especially focus on the early stages of a self-sustaining nuclear fission chain reaction. We also highlight the ways to identify the boundaries of the critical region.

Title: Polymorph Selection in Charged Colloids in the Second Nucleation Step
Authors: C. Patrick Royall
Abstract: We study polymorph selection in a model of charged colloids, with a focus on the higher-order structure prior to and during nucleation. Specifically, we carry out molecular dynamics simulations of a repulsive Yukawa system with a slightly softened (Weeks-Chandler-Andersen) core. We consider the case where the interaction is long-ranged and the BCC crystal is stable, and also intermediate- and short-ranged cases where the FCC crystal is stable. We use two methods for structure identification, the topological cluster classification (TCC) [A. Malins et al., J. Chem. Phys. 139, 234506 (2013)] and the bond orientational order parameter analysis of W. Lechner and C. Dellago [J. Chem. Phys.129, 114707 (2008)]. Under conditions of high supersaturation, appropriate to experiments with colloids, we find that the system forms a precursor state in which the particles are hexagonally ordered. ~That is to say, the precursors are indistinguishable from an HCP crystal using the bond orientational order parameters. This ordering occurs at state points both when the body-centred cubic crystal is the stable phase, and also when the face-centred cubic crystal is stable. In all cases, the stable polymorph forms from the precursor phase in a second stage. Although at freezing, the fluid is very much more ordered when the interactions are short-ranged (when FCC is stable), at the supersaturations where nucleation occurs in our simulations, the higher-order structure of the metastable fluids is almost identical for the long-, short-, and intermediate-ranged systems when measured with the TCC.

Title: The Zubarev Double Time Greens function-A Vintage Many Body Technique
Authors: Vijay Singh, Shraddha Singh
Abstract: These lecture notes present a comprehensive and powerful many-body technique pioneered in 1960 by D. N. Zubarev. The technique, known as the Zubarev Double Time Greens Function method, was used extensively by leading solid state physicists such as John Hubbard and Laura Roth in the 1960s. We present the technique and apply it to the non-interacting electron and boson gas. We next consider the (many-body) Hubbard model and show how it yields the Stoner criterion for ferromagnetism. It is easily extendable to superconductivity and related problems. Our treatment is pedagogical and understandable to those with just an elementary understanding of second quantization.

Title: Optical Spectroscopy of Waveguide coupled Er$^{3+}$ ensembles in CaWO$_4$ and YVO$_4$
Authors: Fabian Becker, Anna Selzer, Lorenz J. J. Sauerzopf, Catherine L. Curtin, Sudip KC, Tim Schneider, Kai Müller
Abstract: We present an optical study of near-surface Er$^{3+}$ ensembles in waveguide-integrated CaWO$_4$ and YVO$_4$, investigating how nanophotonic coupling modifies rare-earth spectroscopy. In particular, we compare bulk excitation with evanescently coupled TE and TM waveguide modes. In Er$^{3+}$:CaWO$_4$, we observe a pronounced polarization-dependent surface effect. TE-coupled spectra closely reproduce bulk behavior. In contrast, TM coupling induces strong inhomogeneous broadening and an asymmetric low-energy shoulder of the site S1 Y1Z1 transition, with linewidths exceeding those of the bulk by more than a factor of four. Temperature-dependent measurements and surface termination studies indicate that surface charges are the dominant mechanism. Er$^{3+}$:YVO$_4$ remains largely unaffected by mode polarization, and surface termination leads only to minor spectral shifts. These observations suggest that non-charge-neutral rare-earth systems are more susceptible to surface-induced decoherence sources than charge-neutral hosts.

Title: Kinetic theory of dilute granular gases with hard-core and inverse power-law potentials under uniform shear flow: comparison with simplified model
Authors: Yuria Kobayashi, Makoto R. Kikuchi, Shunsuke Iizuka, Satoshi Takada
Abstract: We develop a kinetic-theory framework to investigate the steady rheology of a dilute gas interacting via a repulsive potential under uniform shear flow. Starting from the Boltzmann equation with a restitution coefficient that depends on the impact velocity and potential strength, we derive evolution equations for the stress tensor based on Grad's moment expansion. The resulting expressions for the collisional rates and transport coefficients are fitted with simple analytical functions that capture their temperature dependence over a wide range of shear rates. Comparison with direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) results shows excellent quantitative agreement for the shear stress, temperature anisotropy, and steady viscosity. We also analyze the velocity distribution functions, revealing that the system remains nearly Maxwellian even under strong shear.

Title: Shape Elasticity in Colloidal Bent-Core Liquid Crystals
Authors: Nicholas W. Hackney, Joel T. Clemmer, Gary S. Grest
Abstract: Curved particles have been shown to stabilize a range of states with unique order in dense suspensions of colloidal bent core liquid crystals. The shape of the colloidal rods encourages the formation of curved director fields. However, states of constant bend cannot uniformly fill either two or three dimensional Euclidean space and are therefore geometrically frustrated. As a result, curved rods are forced to couple their preference for bend with additional twist and splay deformations, giving rise to twist-bend and splay-bend states of nematic and smectic order. In this article, we study the effect of rod curvature on these diverse states of liquid crystalline order using molecular dynamics simulations of a bonded particle model of curved rods with tunable shape elasticity. Focusing on the case of intermediately curved rods, we find that curved rods go through a sequence of isotropic, nematic twist-bend and smectic splay-bend ordering as the density is increased from the dilute limit, in agreement with previous studies of rigid rods. As the rods become more elastic, the critical concentration separating these phases is shifted to higher density. Lastly, we find that flexibility weakens the first-order phase transition separating the isotropic and nematic twist-bend phases.

Title: Wigner solid or Anderson solid -- 2D electrons in strong disorder
Authors: Aryaman Babbar, Zi-Jian Li, Sankar Das Sarma
Abstract: Critically analyzing recent STM and transport experiments [Z. Ge, et al, arXiv:2510.12009] on 2D electron systems in the presence of random quenched impurities, we argue that the resulting low-density putative "solid" phase reported experimentally is better described as an Anderson solid with the carriers randomly spatially localized by impurities than as a Wigner solid where the carriers form a crystal due to an interaction-induced spontaneous breaking of the translational symmetry. In strongly disordered systems, the resulting solid is amorphous, which is adiabatically connected to the infinite disorder Anderson fixed point rather than the zero disorder Wigner crystal fixed point.

Title: Ir3Ge20: A 3n-Connected Cloverleaf-Shaped Supercluster
Authors: Xue Wu, Wen-Shuai Dai, Lulu Li, Fangying Hao, Hong-Guang Xu, Wei-Jun Zheng, Jijun Zhao
Abstract: Group 14 Zintl clusters are promising molecular building blocks for nanoscale architecture. Endohedral variants, which encapsulate d/f-block metals within p-block semimetal cages, provide insights into intermetallic bonding and compound formation. In this study, experimental photoelectron spectroscopy and first-principles calculations were used to investigate the Ir-doped germanium cluster species. A new C2v symmetric building block, IrGe12, was identified, serving as the basis for designing the supercluster Ir3Ge20 with a cloverleaf-shaped, D3h symmetric architecture. This structure consists of three interconnected aromatic IrGe12 units linked by Ge-Ge sigma bonds, forming shielding cones. Ir3Ge20 follows the 5n rule with 100 valence electrons, featuring a core-Ir3 unit with a d10 closed-shell configuration sharing electrons with the Ge20 skeleton. The stability, chemical bonding, and aromaticity of Ir3Ge20 were confirmed, demonstrating a novel approach to precise atom manipulation in cluster-based materials and devices.

Title: The emergence of net chirality in two-dimensional Dirac fermions system with altermagnetic mass
Authors: Peng-Yi Liu, Yu-Hao Wan, Qing-Feng Sun
Abstract: In two-dimensional lattice systems, massless Dirac fermions undergo doubling, leading to the cancellation of net chirality. We demonstrate that the recently discovered altermagnetism can induce a unique mass term, the altermagnetic mass term, which gaps out Dirac cones with one chirality while maintaining the other gapless, leading to the emergence of net chirality. The surviving gapless Dirac cones retain identical winding numbers and exhibit the quantum anomalous Hall effect in the presence of the trivial constant mass term. When subjected to an external magnetic field, the altermagnetic mass induces Landau level asymmetry in Dirac fermions, resulting in fully valley-polarized quantum Hall edge states. Our findings reveal that Dirac fermions with the altermagnetic mass harbor rich physical phenomena warranting further exploration.

Title: Structural heterogeneity-induced enhancement of transverse magneto-thermoelectric conversion revealed by thermoelectric imaging in functionally graded materials
Authors: Sang J. Park, Ravi Gautam, Takashi Yagi, Rajkumar Modak, Hossein Sepehri-Amin, Ken-ichi Uchida
Abstract: Functionally graded materials (FGMs) exhibit continuous property variations that enable unique functionalities and provide efficient platforms for systematic property optimization. Here, we report the fabrication of FGMs with graded structural heterogeneity by annealing an amorphous metal under a one-dimensional temperature gradient. Using lock-in thermography (LIT), we spatially mapped transverse thermoelectric conversion with high spatial and temperature resolution. A pronounced non-monotonic response was observed, with the maximum anomalous Ettingshausen effect, transverse charge-to-heat conversion in magnetic materials, appearing in the atomic-heterogeneity regime well before crystallization. This enhancement was not captured by conventional structural or longitudinal transport measurements, highlighting the exceptional sensitivity of transverse thermoelectric phenomena to subtle structural heterogeneity. Structural analyses using scanning transmission electron microscopy and atom probe tomography revealed Fe-based crystalline alloys and Cu nanoclusters embedded in the amorphous matrix, whose heterogeneity accounts for the enhanced response. These findings establish temperature-gradient-annealed FGMs, combined with LIT, as a powerful methodology for probing structural-heterogeneity-driven transverse electron transport and designing high-performance flexible materials.

Title: Unitary Transformation of Two-Dimensional Spin-Orbit Coupled Models
Authors: Manish Kumar Mohanta
Abstract: The Rashba, Dresselhaus, and Weyl Hamiltonians form a foundational framework for modeling spin-orbit interactions across condensed matter systems. Although they describe distinct material classes and produce seemingly different spin textures, they are conventionally treated as separate, unrelated theoretical frameworks. Here, this work demonstrates that the linear 2D Rashba and Weyl models are connected by a specific unitary transformation that maps one Hamiltonian exactly onto the other. The same unitary can be applied to map the linear Dresselhaus-1 model onto the Dresselhaus-2 models and vice versa. Such hidden correspondence establishes a unified theoretical foundation for spin-orbit interactions, deepening our conceptual understanding of spin-orbit coupling and opening new avenues for exploring complex spin textures. To illustrate the application, this work introduces a unique, improved, and more realistic model Hamiltonian H_MKM combining all known foundational spintronic models, where the stringent condition of equal spin-orbit coupling strength of Rashba and Dresselhaus may not be required to observe persistent spin texture under MKM transformation.

Title: Comments on the formula to extract current-induced torques from the harmonic Hall voltage measurements
Authors: Yong-Chang Lau, Yukihiro Marui, Zhendong Chi, Masashi Kawaguchi, Masamitsu Hayashi
Abstract: We examine the formulas commonly used to estimate current-induced spin-orbit torques from harmonic Hall voltage measurements. In particular, we focus on the factor of two discrepancy among expressions employed to fit harmonic Hall signals measured under an in-plane rotating magnetic field. By explicitly deriving the relevant relations, we clarify the origin of this discrepancy and present the correct form of the fitting formula. We further discuss the determination of the sign of the field-like torque from harmonic Hall voltage measurements, which depends on the assumed form of the current-induced torques.

Title: Interplay of activity and non-reciprocity in tracer dynamics: From non-equilibrium fluctuation-dissipation to giant diffusion
Authors: Subhajit Paul, Debasish Chaudhuri
Abstract: Non-reciprocal interactions play a key role in shaping transport in active and passive systems, giving rise to striking nonequilibrium behavior. Here, we study the dynamics of a tracer -- active or passive -- embedded in a bath of active or passive particles, coupled through non-reciprocal interactions. Starting from the microscopic stochastic dynamics of the full system, we derive an overdamped generalized Langevin equation for the tracer, incorporating a non-Markovian memory kernel that captures bath-mediated correlations. This framework enables us to compute the tracer's velocity and displacement response, derive a generalized nonequilibrium fluctuation-dissipation relation that quantifies deviations from equilibrium behavior, and determine the mean-squared displacement (MSD). We find that while the MSD becomes asymptotically diffusive, the effective diffusivity depends non-monotonically on the degree of non-reciprocity and diverges at an intermediate value. This regime of giant diffusivity provides a generic mechanism for enhanced transport in active soft matter and has direct implications for biological systems exhibiting chase-and-run or predator-prey interactions. Our analytical predictions are supported by numerical simulations of active Brownian particles, highlighting experimentally accessible signatures of non-reciprocal interactions in soft matter.

Title: Koopman Nonlinear Non-Hermitian Skin Effect
Authors: Shu Hamanaka
Abstract: Non-Hermitian skin effects are conventionally manifested as boundary localization of eigenstates in linear systems. In nonlinear settings, however, where eigenstates are no longer well defined, it becomes unclear how skin effects should be faithfully characterized. Here, we propose a Koopman-based characterization of nonlinear skin effects, in which localization is defined in terms of Koopman eigenfunctions in a lifted observable space, rather than physical states. Using a minimal nonlinear extension of the Hatano-Nelson model, we show that dominant Koopman eigenfunctions localize sharply on higher-order observables, in stark contrast to linear skin effects confined to linear observables. This lifted-space localization governs the sensitivity to boundary amplitude perturbations, providing a distinct dynamical signature of the nonlinear skin effect. Our results establish the Koopman framework as a natural setting in which skin effects unique to nonlinear non-Hermitian systems can be identified.

Title: Interference-Induced Suppression of Doublon Transport and Prethermalization in the Extended Bose-Hubbard Model
Authors: Zhen-Ting Bao, Kai Xu, Heng Fan
Abstract: The coherent mobility of doublons, arising from second-order virtual dissociation-recombination processes, fundamentally limits their use as information carriers in the strongly interacting Bose-Hubbard model. We propose a disorder-free suppression mechanism by introducing an optimized nearest-neighbor pair-hopping term that destructively interferes with the dominant virtual hopping channel. Using the third-order Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we derive an analytical optimal condition that accounts for lattice geometry corrections. Exact numerical simulations demonstrate that this optimized scheme achieves near-complete dynamical arrest and entanglement preservation in one-dimensional chains, while in two-dimensional square lattices, it significantly suppresses ballistic spreading yet permits a slow residual expansion. Furthermore, in the many-body regime, finite-size scaling analysis identifies the observed long-lived density-wave order as a prethermal plateau emerging from the dramatic separation of microscopic and thermalization timescales.

Title: Impact of MAPbI3 Phase Transitions on Solar Cell Performance
Authors: Ph Baranek (IPVF), J P Connolly (GeePs), A Gissler (IPVF, IPVF), Ph Schulz (IPVF), M Rérat (IPREM), R Dovesi
Abstract: This paper presents a first step toward a pragmatic phenomenological multiscale approach to evaluate perovskite solar cell performance which determines material properties at the atomistic scale with first-principles calculations, and applies them in macro-scale device models. This work focuses on the MAPbI3 (MA = CH3NH3) perovskite and how its phase transitions impact on its optical, electronic, and structural properties which are investigated at the first-principles level. The obtained data are coupled to a numerical drift-diffusion device model enabling evaluation of the performance of corresponding single junction devices. The first-principles simulation applies a hybrid exchange-correlation functional adapted to the studied family of compounds. Validation by available experimental data is presented from materials properties to device performance, justifying the use of the approach for predictive evaluation of existing and novel perovskites. The coupling between atomistic and device models is described in terms of a framework for exchange of optical and electronic parameters between the two scales. The obtained results are systematically discussed in terms of first-principles levels of approximation performances.

Title: Electric-current control of anomalous Hall effect
Authors: Jianping Guo, Gusthavo M. S. Brizolla, Peng Rao, Jian Shao, Thomas N. G. Meier, Tailai Xu, Peirui Ji, Jonathan Finley, Jaroslav Fabian, Johannes Knolle, Christian Back, Lin Chen
Abstract: We demonstrate robust and reversible electric-current control of the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in a two-dimensional WTe2/Fe3GeTe2 (FGT) stack. Applying a current through Td-WTe2 leads to a giant modulation of the AHE of the adjacent FGT layer, with the relative change of the AHE conductivity exceeding 180%. Control experiments show that i) the observed effect is absent in pure FGT, ii) the modulation weakens in thicker FGT films, confirming its interfacial origin, and iii) the modulation peaks for bilayer WTe2, indicating that the Berry-curvature dipole (BCD) plays the dominant role in the modulation. We propose that the charge current I generates an out-of-plane magnetization Mz via BCD in WTe2 and Mz modifies the exchange splitting of FGT via the inverse magnetic proximity effect, thereby altering its Berry curvature and nontrivially influencing the AHE. The demonstrated method of AHE control offers new possibilities for magnetism control, i.e., for the study of AHE-transistors as well as electric-current control of quantum magnets, especially magnetic insulators.

Title: Physically Consistent Machine Learning for Melting Temperature Prediction of Refractory High-Entropy Alloys
Authors: Mohd Hasnain
Abstract: Predicting the melting temperature (Tm) of multi-component and high-entropy alloys (HEAs) is critical for high-temperature applications but computationally expensive using traditional CALPHAD or DFT methods. In this work, we develop a gradient-boosted decision tree (XGBoost) model to predict Tm for complex alloys based on elemental properties. To ensure physical consistency, we address the issue of data leakage by excluding temperature-dependent thermodynamic descriptors (such as Gibbs free energy of mixing) and instead rely on physically motivated elemental features. The optimized model achieves a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.948 and a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 9928 which is about 5% relative error for HEAs on a validation set of approximately 1300 compositions. Crucially, we validate the model using the Valence Electron Concentration (VEC) rule. Without explicit constraints during training, the model successfully captures the known stability transition between BCC and FCC phases at a VEC of approximately 6.87. These results demonstrate that data-driven models, when properly feature-engineered, can capture fundamental metallurgical principles for rapid alloy screening.

Title: Ghost-Mode Filtered Fluctuating Lattice Boltzmann Method
Authors: Marco Lauricella, Andrea Montessori, Adriano Tiribocchi, Sauro Succi
Abstract: Fluctuating lattice Boltzmann solvers are widely employed to model mesoscopic fluid behavior in soft-matter systems, including colloidal suspensions and dilute polymer solutions. Despite their utility, these methods can lose accuracy and stability when non-hydrodynamic modes interfere with the dynamics, especially in single--relaxation-time schemes. Here, we introduce a ghost-mode filtered fluctuating lattice Boltzmann method (GMF-FLBM) for the D3Q27 lattice, obtained by selectively eliminating the propagation of the ghost deterministic content while preserving the necessary stochastic forcing. We show, over a broad range of relaxation times, that GMF-FLBM recovers the amplitudes of equilibrium fluctuations with a comparable accuracy as a fully regularized high-order formulation, while requiring only minor adjustments to the conventional BGK collision framework.

Title: Quantum Otto heat-engine with Kitaev-Heisenberg cluster: Possible roles of frustration, magnons, and duality
Authors: Sheikh Moonsun Pervez, Saptarshi Mandal
Abstract: We study the performance of Kitaev-Heisenberg (KH) clusters as working media realizing a quantum Otto engine (QOE). An external Zeeman field with linear time dependency is used as the driving mechanism. The efficiency strongly depends on Kitaev ($\kappa$) and Heisenberg ($J$) exchange interaction. Interestingly, efficiency is comparable when the relative magnitude of $\kappa$ and $J$ is the same but of opposite signs. The above results are explained due to a subtle interplay of frustration, quantum fluctuation, and duality of eigen-spectra for the KH system when both the signs of $\kappa$ and $J$ are reversed. The maximum efficiency is shown to be dynamically related to eigen-spectra forming discrete narrow bands, where total spin angular momentum becomes a good quantum number. We relate this optimum efficiency to the realization of weakly interacting magnons, where the system reduces to an approximate eigen-system of the external drive. Finally, we extend our study to the large spin Kitaev model and find a quantum advantage in efficiency for $S=1/2$. The results could be of practical interest for materials with KH interactions as a platform for QOE.

Title: High-pressure synthesis of quantum magnet M-YbTaO4 with a stretched diamond lattice
Authors: Nicola D. Kelly, Xuan Liang, Siân E. Dutton, Kazunari Yamaura, Yoshihiro Tsujimoto
Abstract: We report bulk magnetic properties of ytterbium tantalate in its monoclinic fergusonite modification, M-YbTaO4. The spin-1/2 Yb3+ ions in this phase are arranged on a geometrically frustrated "stretched diamond" lattice. M-YbTaO4 cannot be prepared at ambient pressure and was instead prepared in a belt-type apparatus at 6 GPa and 1800 C. Susceptibility and specific heat data show no long-range ordering down to 1.8 K and are consistent with a Jeff = 1/2 Kramers doublet which splits in an applied field. Furthermore, under high-pressure synthesis the entire solid solution YbNbxTa1-xO4 (0 < x < 1) can be stabilised in the M phase, in contrast to ambient-pressure synthesis which favours the competing M' phase for Ta-rich compositions. Subsequent annealing of the Nb-Ta mixed samples resulted in colour changes, suggesting oxygen deficiency in some of the as-prepared high pressure samples. There was little variation in the bulk magnetic properties upon varying either the Nb/Ta ratio or the annealing conditions.

Title: Ultrafast laser-driven topological phase patterning
Authors: Jianyu Wu, Arthur Niedermayr, Gaolong Cao, Oscar Grånäs, Jonas Weissenrieder
Abstract: Microscopic and dynamic control over quantum states is essential for bridging fundamental studies of material properties to device function. Realizing such control at combined high spatial resolution and ultrafast temporal precision remains a major challenge. Here, we demonstrate femtosecond laser-driven patterning of topological quantum states in the Weyl semimetal WTe2. By engineering the excitation field into a transient optical grating, we spatially selectively and reversibly drive phase transitions between the topological Td and topologically trivial 1T* phases. Using ultrafast transmission electron microscopy, we directly visualize the formation of a periodic Td/1T* heterostructure, observe the propagation of a phase front, and analyze nanoscale confinement of coherently excited optical phonon modes. Our findings establish a platform for all-optical, spatially programmable, and reconfigurable control of quantum states, paving the way for optically addressable topological devices.

Title: Cleavage toughness of single crystals
Authors: Faming Gao
Abstract: Griffith thermodynamic energy balance is employed to analyze cleavage phenomenon from atomic level. Results show that the cleavage toughness, the strain energy release rate, and the surface energy can be defined by the bond strength (the appropriate elastic modulus ) and the bond density. Such simple definition of fracture parameters is different from Irwin ones. This appropriate elastic modulus of single crystals is obtained using the complex variable function method. The calculated results of cleavage toughness and surface energy of typical ionic and covalent crystals by the present formulae are in excellent agreement with the experimental values. It demonstrates that our method offers a concise tool for predicting the cleavage toughness, the energy release rate and the surface energy of crystal cleavage planes.

Title: Two Charging Mechanisms in Contact Electrification of Liquid and Ice
Authors: Rutvik Lathia, Benjamin Leibauer, Aaron D. Ratschow, Werner Steffen, Hans-Jürgen Butt
Abstract: The microscopic and fundamental origin of slide electrification, where droplets of water move across insulating surfaces accumulating and depositing electrical charges, is still debated. Charge transfer is often attributed to ion transfer at the receding contact line. However, it is still unclear whether ion transfer alone can fully account for the observed charge separation. We examined slide electrification of two polar, self-ionizing liquids (water, formamide) and two non-polar liquids (diiodomethane, bromonaphthalene). By cooling below the melting temperature, we were able to compare this process to tribocharging of the respective frozen components. Despite having ions immobilized at sub-freezing temperatures, the ice of the polar liquids continues to accumulate significant charge. Non-polar liquids exhibit lower charging (<25% of polar liquids) and nearly identical charging behaviour in both their liquid and frozen phases on five different substrates. Since non-polar liquids contain few free ions, these observations indicate an alternative charging mechanism, which could be electron transfer. Our findings suggest that slide electrification operates through two mechanisms, with the dominant charge transfer pathway shifting between ions and electron transfer depending on the electronegativity, phase, and temperature.

Title: Clustering Dynamics of SiO2-Pt Active Janus Colloids
Authors: Harishwar Raman, Aniket Shivhare, Amit Kumar, Madhav Penukonda, Pawan Kumar, Karnika Singh, Akash Choudhary, Rahul Mangal
Abstract: Active colloid clustering is central to understanding non-equilibrium self-organization, with implications for programmable active materials and synthetic or biological assemblies. While most prior studies have focused on dimers or small aggregates, the dynamics of larger clusters remain relatively unexplored. Here, we experimentally investigate chemically active, monodisperse SiO2-Pt Janus colloid (JC) clusters as large as n=9 in a dynamic clustering regime, where clusters continuously form, dissolve, and merge as swimmer density increases. We show that clusters move in circular trajectories, and that both their translational and rotational dynamics can be predicted directly from the orientations of constituent JCs. Furthermore, we identify that their formation undergoes a mechanistic transition: while small clusters are mediated by chemical interactions, larger clusters are predominantly formed by steric effects. This transition arises from a mismatch of motilities between incoming JCs and clusters, combined with increased Pt-surface exposure. Our results extend prior dimer-focused studies to larger aggregates and establish a predictive description that bridges individual swimmer behavior with collective dynamics.

Title: Electronic Structure of UGe$_{2\pm x}$ Thin Films from Photoelectron Spectroscopy
Authors: Sonu George Alex, Oleksandr Romanyuk, Ivan Zorilo, Alexander Andreev, Frank Huber, Thomas Gouder, Petr Malinsky, Alexander B. Shick, Evgenia A. Tereshina-Chitrova
Abstract: Uranium digermanide UGe$_2$, the first ferromagnetic superconductor, represents a key composition in the U-Ge system dominated by U-5$f$ states. To examine the impact of controlled stoichiometric deviations on the electronic structure, UGe$_{2\pm x}$ thin films ($0 \le x \le 1$) were prepared by triode sputtering and studied on pristine surfaces by X-ray (XPS) and Ultraviolet (UPS) photoelectron spectroscopy. XPS and UPS reveal a robust metallic valence band with a dominant U-5$f$ contribution at the Fermi level and a broad incoherent feature at higher binding energies, without qualitative changes in spectral line shape across the composition range. The experimental spectrum of UGe$_2$ thin films is well reproduced by DFT+U(ED) valence-band calculations combining density functional theory with exact diagonalization of the multiconfigurational U-5$f$ shell. These results demonstrate that the overall U-Ge electronic framework of UGe$_2$ thin films remains resilient to moderate stoichiometric deviations, providing a reliable electronic baseline for future studies of interface- and heterostructure-driven phenomena in uranium-based systems.

Title: A current source with metrological precision made on a 300mm silicon MOS process
Authors: Nathan Johnson, Stefan Kubicek, Julien Jussot, Yann Canvel, Kristiaan De Greve, M. Fernando Gonzalez-Zalba, Ross C. C. Leon, John J. L. Morton
Abstract: Although the measurement of current is now defined with respect to the electronic charge, producing a current standard based on a single-electron source remains challenging. The error rate of a source must be below 0.01 ppm, and many such sources must be operated in parallel to provide practically useful values of current in the nanoampere range. Achieving a single electron source using an industrial grade 300 mm wafer silicon metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) process could offer a powerful route for scaling, combined with the ability for integration with control and measurement electronics. Here, we present measurements of such a single-electron source indicating an error rate of 0.008 ppm, below the error threshold to satisfy the SI Ampere, and one of the lowest error rates reported, implemented using a gate-defined quantum dot device fabricated on an industry-grade silicon MOS process. Further evidence supporting the accuracy of the device is obtained by comparing the device performance to established models of quantum tunnelling, which reveal the mechanism of operation of our source at the single particle level. The low error rate observed in this device motivates the development of scaled arrays of parallel sources utilising Si MOS devices to realise a new generation of metrologically accurate current standards.

Title: In-plane ferromagnetism-driven topological nodal-point superconductivity with tilted Weyl cones

Abstract: The potential application of topological superconductivity in quantum transport and quantum information has fueled an intense investigation of hybrid materials with emergent electronic properties, including magnet-superconductor heterostructures. Here, we report evidence of a topological nodal-point superconducting phase in a one-atom-thick in-plane ferromagnet in direct proximity to a conventional $s$-wave superconductor. Low-temperature scanning tunneling spectroscopy data reveal the presence of a double-peak low-energy feature in the local density of states of the hybrid system, which is rationalized via model calculations to be an emergent topological nodal-point superconducting phase with tilted Weyl cones. Our results further establish the combination of in-plane ferromagnetism and conventional superconductivity as a route to design two-dimensional topological quantum phases.

Title: Material exploration through active learning -- METAL
Authors: Joakim Brorsson, Henrik Klein Moberg, Joel Hildingsson, Jonatan Gastaldi, Tobias Mattisson, Anders Hellman
Abstract: The discovery and design of new materials are paramount in the development of green technologies. High entropy oxides represent one such group that has only been tentatively explored, mainly due to the inherent problem of navigating vast compositional spaces. Thanks to the emergence of machine learning, however, suitable tools are now readily available. Here, the task of finding oxygen carriers for chemical looping processes has been tackled by leveraging active learning-based strategies combined with first-principles calculations. High efficiency and efficacy have, moreover, been achieved by exploiting the power of recently developed machine learning interatomic potentials. Firstly, the proposed approaches were validated based on an established computational framework for identifying high entropy perovskites that can be used in chemical looping air separation and dry reforming. Chief among the insights thus gained was the identification of the best performing strategies, in the form of greedy or Thompson-based sampling based on uncertainty estimates obtained from Gaussian processes. Building on this newfound knowledge, the concept was applied to a more complex problem, namely the discovery of high entropy oxygen carriers for chemical looping oxygen uncoupling. This resulted in both qualitative as well as quantitative outcomes, including lists of specific materials with high oxygen transfer capacities and configurational entropies. Specifically, the best candidates were based on the known oxygen carrier CaMnO3 but also contained a variety of additional species, of which some, e.g., Ti; Co; Cu; and Ti, were expected while others were not, e.g., Y and Sm. The results suggest that adopting active learning approaches is critical in materials discovery, given that these methods are already shifting research practice and soon will be the norm.

Title: Layer Hall effect induced by altermagnetism
Authors: Fang Qin, Rui Chen
Abstract: In this work, we propose a scheme to realize the layer Hall effect in the ferromagnetic topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$ via proximity to $d$-wave altermagnets. We show that an altermagnet and an in-plane magnetic field applied near one surface gap the corresponding Dirac cone, yielding an altermagnet-induced half-quantized Hall effect. When altermagnets with antiparallel Néel vectors are placed near the top and bottom surfaces, giving rise to the layer Hall effect with vanishing net Hall conductance, i.e., the altermagnet-induced layer Hall effect. In contrast, altermagnets with parallel Néel vectors lead to a quantized Chern insulating state, i.e., the altermagnet-induced anomalous Hall effect. We further analyze the dependence of the Hall conductance on the orientation of the in-plane magnetic field and demonstrate that the layer Hall effect becomes observable under a perpendicular electric field. Our results establish a route to engineer altermagnet-induced topological phases in ferromagnetic topological insulators.

Title: Conveyor-mode electron shuttling through a T-junction in Si/SiGe
Authors: Max Beer, Ran Xue, Lennart Deda, Stefan Trellenkamp, Jhih-Sian Tu, Paul Surrey, Inga Seidler, Hendrik Bluhm, Lars R. Schreiber
Abstract: Conveyor-mode shuttling in gated Si/SiGe devices enables adiabatic transfer of single electrons, electron patterns and spin qubits confined in quantum dots across several microns with a scalable number of signal lines. To realize their full potential, linear shuttle lanes must connect into a two-dimensional grid with controllable routing. We introduce a T-junction device linking two independently driven shuttle lanes. Electron routing across the junction requires no extra control lines beyond the four channels per conveyor belt. We measure an inter-lane charge transfer fidelity of $F = 100.0000000^{+0}_{-9\times 10^{-7}}\,\%$ at an instantaneous electron velocity of $270\,\mathrm{mm}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. The filling of 54 quantum dots is controlled by simple atomic pulses, allowing us to swap electron patterns, laying the groundwork for a native spin-qubit SWAP gate. This T-junction establishes a path towards scalable, two-dimensional quantum computing architectures with flexible spin qubit routing for quantum error correction.

Title: Anisotropic second-harmonic generation in superconducting nanostructures
Authors: Sara Memarzadeh, Maciej Krawczyk, Armen Gulian, Jaroslaw W. Klos
Abstract: Circuits based on superconducting nanostructures are among the most promising platforms for quantum computing. Understanding how device geometry governs nonlinear electrodynamics is crucial for implementing superconducting quantum technologies. However, to date, research has largely been limited to superconducting nanostructures with collinearly aligned static and dynamic applied magnetic fields. Here, we analyze the dynamics of Meissner currents and Abrikosov vortices in a superconducting nanocube exposed to combined static and microwave magnetic fields, extending the analysis to a more general excitation geometry. We demonstrate that, in a noncollinear configuration,the magnetization component parallel to the static field develops a dominant second-harmonic response under the microwave driving. This effect is strongly enhanced when Meissner currents saturate at static fields just below the thresholds for successive vortex nucleation. By numerically solving the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations, we show that the response originates from Meissner-current saturation combined with the nonlinear oscillations of normal-phase indentations, yielding an anisotropic second-harmonic signal that is directionally separated from, and not overshadowed by, the first-harmonic component of the dynamic magnetization. These findings are relevant for superconducting devices that require controllable high-frequency nonlinearity.

Title: Magneto-mechanical reservoir computing combining a two-dimensional network of nonlinear mass-spring resonators with magnetic tunnel junctions
Authors: Andrea Grimaldi, Davi R. Rodrigues, Andrea Meo, Francesca Garescì, Giovanni Finocchio
Abstract: Coupled networks of mass-spring resonators have attracted growing attention across multiple fundamental and applied research directions, including reservoir computing for artificial intelligence. This has led to the exploration of platforms capable of tasks such as acoustic-wave classification, smart sensing, predictive maintenance, and adaptive vibration control. This work introduces a multiphysics reservoir based on a two-dimensional network of coupled nonlinear mass-spring resonators. Each mass has a magnetic tunnel junction on top of it, working as spin diode, used as a spintronic read-out. As a proof-of-concept, we have benchmarked this reservoir with the task of vowel-recognition reaching accuracy above 95$\%$. Because the device accepts elastic excitations directly, signal injections are simplified, making it well-suited for realtime sensing and edge computation. We also studied the effect of nonlinearity, demonstrating how it influences the reservoir dynamics, and assessed its robustness under node-to-node variation of the elastic constants.

Title: Mechanism for the anomalous minimization of superfluid critical velocity: Superfluid stability along a step potential
Authors: Akihiro Kanjo, Hiromitsu Takeuchi
Abstract: To explain the experiment on the anomalous dependence of the superfluid critical velocity on a moving obstacle potential in a atomic Bose-Einstein condensate [\href{this https URL}{Phys.~Rev.~A \textbf{91}, 053615 (2015)}], we introduce a considerably simplified model of superflow along a step potential. The energy spectrum and wave functions of the lowest-energy excitations in this system are well described by the semi-classical analysis based on the Bogoliubov theory. We found that the critical velocity is minimized and becomes zero when the potential height equals the hydrostatic chemical potential, which corresponds to the critical point of the local condensation phase transition inside the step potential. In a finite-size system, the critical velocity $v_\mathrm{c}$ obeys a power-law scaling with the system size $L_x$ as $v_\mathrm{c}\propto L_x^{-0.963}$. This criticality provides an explanation of the power-law scaling of the minimum critical velocity observed in the experiment.

Title: Transport properties in a model of confined granular mixtures at moderate densities
Authors: David González Méndez, Vicente Garzó
Abstract: This work derives the Navier--Stokes hydrodynamic equations for a model of a confined, quasi-two-dimensional, $s$-component mixture of inelastic, smooth, hard spheres. Using the inelastic version of the revised Enskog theory, macroscopic balance equations for mass, momentum, and energy are obtained, and constitutive equations for the fluxes are determined through a first-order Chapman--Enskog expansion. As for elastic collisions, the transport coefficients are given in terms of the solutions of a set of coupled linear integral equations. Approximate solutions to these equations for diffusion transport coefficients and shear viscosity are achieved by assuming steady-state conditions and considering leading terms in a Sonine polynomial expansion. These transport coefficients are expressed in terms of the coefficients of restitution, concentration, the masses and diameters of the mixture's components, and the system's density. The results apply to moderate densities and are not limited to particular values of the coefficients of restitution, concentration, mass, and/or diameter ratios. As an application, the thermal diffusion factor is evaluated to analyze segregation driven by temperature gradients and gravity, providing criteria that distinguish whether larger particles accumulate near the hotter or colder boundaries.

Title: Counterexamples to the conjectured ordering between the waiting-time bound and the thermodynamic uncertainty bound on entropy production
Authors: Jie Gu
Abstract: Two widely used model-free lower bounds on the steady-state entropy production rate of a continuous-time Markov jump process are the thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) bound $\sigma_\text{TUR}$, derived from the mean and variance of a current, and the waiting-time distribution (WTD) bound $\sigma_\mathcal{L}$, derived from the irreversibility of partially observed transition sequences together with their waiting times. It has been conjectured that $\sigma_{\mathcal L}$ is always at least as tight as $\sigma_{\mathrm{TUR}}$ when both are constructed from the same partially observed link. Here we provide four-state counterexamples in a nonequilibrium steady state where $\sigma_{\mathcal L}<\sigma_{\mathrm{TUR}}$. This result shows that no universal ordering exists between these two inference bounds under partial observation.

Title: Robust chirality memory in carbon nanotubes growing under modulated and evolving environments
Authors: K. Otsuka, R. Fujiwara, S. Maruyama
Abstract: Controlling the chirality and yield of carbon nanotubes is essential for their diverse applications from macroscopic composites to nanoelectronics. Floating-catalyst chemical vapor deposition is widely employed as a scalable synthesis route, where catalysts inevitably traverse spatially varying environments. However, prevailing interpretations of nanotube growth largely rely on ensemble monitoring or static, post-growth snapshots. Here, we combine digital isotope labeling with programmed temperature modulation to reconstruct the dynamic growth histories of supported individual nanotubes. Growth rates exhibit hysteresis and extraordinary sensitivity to temperature changes, indicating irreversible catalyst coarsening; nevertheless, the nanotube chirality remains robustly preserved across lengths exceeding 300 um. This sharp contrast between kinetic adaptability and structural memory in nanotube growth indicates that chirality control can be established at the nucleation stage, while allowing independent optimization of subsequent elongation. Our findings further call for a re-examination of static interpretations of diameter-determination mechanisms derived from post-growth snapshots.

Title: Magnetoluminescence of ZnMnSe/BeMnTe heterostructures with type-II band alignment at millikelvin temperatures
Authors: Dennis Kudlacik, Linda Kersting, Nataliia E. Kopteva, Mladen Kotur, Dmitri R. Yakovlev, Manfred Bayer
Abstract: The magneto-optical properties of a Zn$_{0.99}$Mn$_{0.01}$Se/Be$_{0.93}$Mn$_{0.07} $Te diluted magnetic semiconductor heterostructure with type-II band alignment are investigated at cryogenic temperatures down to 16 mK. The temperature of the Mn spin system, which at the lowest possible laser power reaches 270 mK, is evaluated from the giant Zeeman splitting of the direct exciton in the Zn$_{0.99}$Mn$_{0.01}$Se layers subject to an external magnetic field. The degree of circular polarization of the direct and indirect optical transitions, induced by the magnetic field, is a sensitive indicator for the laser heating of the Mn spin system. Evidence of spin glass formation in the Mn spin system of the Be$_{0.93}$Mn$_{0.07}$Te layers with the critical temperature of $T_{SG}=400$ mK is found.

Title: Superconductivity, Kondo physics and magnetic order: Tuning the groundstate in the La$_{1-x}$Ce$_x$FeSiH solid solution through the interplay between $3d$ and $4f$ correlated electrons
Authors: J. Sourd, B. Vignolle, E. Gaudin, S. Burdin, S. Tencé
Abstract: We report a study of the La$_{1-x}$Ce$_x$FeSiH solid solution ($0 \leq x \leq 1$), a family of intermetallic hydrides of ZrCuSiAs-type structure, with space group $P4/nmm$. For low cerium concentrations $x \leq 0.20$, we observe the presence of superconductivity, which originates from the correlated $3d$ electrons of iron. The superconducting regime is progressively suppressed by the cerium substitution. For moderate cerium concentration $0.07 \leq x \leq 0.50$, we observe evidence of the single-ion Kondo effect and no magnetic phase transition down to 2 K. For $0.07 \leq x \leq 0.20$, the single-ion Kondo effect coexists with a superconducting ground state at low temperatures. From $x > 0.50$, we observe signatures of Kondo coherence and a heavy Fermi liquid regime at low temperature. Finally, at high cerium concentration $x \geq 0.85$, we observe signatures of magnetic ordering at low temperatures. We discuss our results by introducing temperature scales related to superconductivity, the Kondo effect, and magnetic order, which permits building a rich phase diagram temperature versus cerium content $x$. This shows that using the cerium concentration $x$ as a unique control parameter, we can explore the Kondo entanglement between correlated $3d$ and $4f$ electrons, which suggests an unusual change between the superconducting state related to the $3d$ electrons and the Kondo coherent state involving both $3d$ and $4f$ electrons.

Title: Random knotting in very long off-lattice self-avoiding polygons
Authors: Jason Cantarella, Tetsuo Deguchi, Henrik Schumacher, Clayton Shonkwiler, Erica Uehara
Abstract: We present experimental results on knotting in off-lattice self-avoiding polygons in the bead-chain model. Using Clisby's tree data structure and the scale-free pivot algorithm, for each $k$ between $10$ and $27$ we generated $2^{43-k}$ polygons of size $n=2^k$. Using a new knot diagram simplification and invariant-free knot classification code, we were able to determine the precise knot type of each polygon. The results show that the number of prime summands of knot type $K$ in a random $n$-gon is very well described by a Poisson distribution. We estimate the characteristic length of knotting as $656500 \pm 2500$. We use the count of summands for large $n$ to measure knotting rates and amplitude ratios of knot probabilities more accurately than previous experiments. Our calculations agree quite well with previous on-lattice computations, and support both knot localization and the knot entropy conjecture.

Title: Equivariant Neural Networks for Force-Field Models of Lattice Systems
Authors: Yunhao Fan, Gia-Wei Chern
Abstract: Machine-learning (ML) force fields enable large-scale simulations with near-first-principles accuracy at substantially reduced computational cost. Recent work has extended ML force-field approaches to adiabatic dynamical simulations of condensed-matter lattice models with coupled electronic and structural or magnetic degrees of freedom. However, most existing formulations rely on hand-crafted, symmetry-aware descriptors, whose construction is often system-specific and can hinder generality and transferability across different lattice Hamiltonians. Here we introduce a symmetry-preserving framework based on equivariant neural networks (ENNs) that provides a general, data-driven mapping from local configurations of dynamical variables to the associated on-site forces in a lattice Hamiltonian. In contrast to ENN architectures developed for molecular systems -- where continuous Euclidean symmetries dominate -- our approach aims to embed the discrete point-group and internal symmetries intrinsic to lattice models directly into the neural-network representation of the force field. As a proof of principle, we construct an ENN-based force-field model for the adiabatic dynamics of the Holstein Hamiltonian on a square lattice, a canonical system for electron-lattice physics. The resulting ML-enabled large-scale dynamical simulations faithfully capture mesoscale evolution of the symmetry-breaking phase, illustrating the utility of lattice-equivariant architectures for linking microscopic electronic processes to emergent dynamical behavior in condensed-matter lattice systems.

Title: Universality in driven systems with a multiply-degenerate umbilic point
Authors: Johannes Schmidt, Žiga Krajnik, Vladislav Popkov
Abstract: We investigate a driven particle system, a multilane asymmetric exclusion process, where the particle number in every lane is conserved, and stationary state is fully uncorrelated. The phase space has, starting from three lanes and more, an umbilic manifold where characteristic velocities of all the modes but one coincide, thus allowing us to study a weakly hyperbolic system with arbitrarily large degeneracy. We then study space-time fluctuations in the steady state, at the umbilic manifold, which are expected to exhibit universal scaling features. We formulate an effective mode-coupling theory (MCT) for the multilane model within the umbilic subspace and test its predictions. Unlike in the bidirectional two-lane model with an umbilic point studied earlier, here we find a robust $z=3/2$ dynamical exponent for the umbilic mode. The umbilic scaling function, obtained from Monte-Carlo simulations, for the simplest 3-lane scenario, appears to have an universal shape for a range of interaction parameters. Remarkably, the shape and dynamic exponent of the non-degenerate mode can be analytically predicted on the base of effective MCT, up to non-universal scaling factor. Our findings suggest the existence of novel universality classes with dynamical exponent $3/2$, appearing in long-lived hydrodynamic modes with equal characteristic velocities.

Title: Modulus and confinement effects on self-repeating, power-amplified snapping of soft, swollen beams
Authors: Nolan A. Miller, Laura C. Bradley, Alfred J. Crosby
Abstract: Latch-mediated Spring Actuation (LaMSA) is a mechanism found in nature, employed by organisms that generate the highest levels of power density through repeatable, rapid energy release. While LaMSA has been used in engineered systems like archery bows, catapults, and jumping robots, most such technologies require external power for self-repeating motion. Recent advances in soft actuators have demonstrated that engineered gels swollen with a volatile solvent are capable of self-repeating, high specific-power generation by taking advantage of balances between environmental interaction (evaporation) and elasticity. These systems rely upon snap-through instabilities. Due to the complex coupling between material properties and geometry, both of which evolve as self-repeating motion continues, an understanding of how polymer properties and boundary conditions control the lifetime, count, and magnitude of power generating events for a given amount of solvent remains unrealized. We overcome the challenges in characterizing the performance of evaporation-driven, power-generating gels by measuring accumulating force response from evaporation in parallel with the profile deformation of the structure. By optimizing the balance between swelling properties and elasticity, the lifetime of snapping is increased by 445% from previous literature, snapping at a maximum power density of about 87 W/kg. This power is achieved with swollen beams 50 mm in length after 53 mg of solvent had evaporated and is comparable to the power output of adult jumping mantises at 68 W/kg at a similar size scale.1 We develop scaling relationships that balance Flory-Rehner swelling theory with buckling mechanics to generate insight into optimizing lifetime and power of autonomous power-generating systems.

Title: Anderson Localization on Husimi Trees and its implications for Many-Body localization
Authors: Dafne Prado Bandeira, Marco Tarzia
Abstract: Motivated by the analogy between many-body localization (MBL) and single-particle Anderson localization on hierarchical graphs, we study localization on the Husimi tree, a generalization of the Bethe lattice with a finite density of local loops of arbitrary but finite length. The exact solution of the model provides a transparent and quantitative framework to systematically inspect the effect of loops on localization. Our analysis indicates that local loops enhance resonant processes, thereby reducing the critical disorder with increasing their number and size. At the same time, loops promote local hybridization, leading to an increase in the spatial extent of localized eigenstates. These effects reconcile key discrepancies between MBL phenomenology and its single-particle Anderson analog. These results show that local loops are a crucial structural ingredient for realistic single-particle analogies to many-body Hilbert spaces.

Title: Stochastic Path Compression for Spectral Tensor Networks on Cyclic Graphs
Authors: Ryan T. Grimm, Joel D. Eaves
Abstract: We develop a new approach to compress cyclic tensor networks called stochastic path compression (SPC) that uses an iterative importance sampling procedure to target edges with large bond-dimensions. Closed random walks in SPC form compression pathways that spatially localize large bond-dimensions in the tensor network. Analogous to the phase separation of two immiscible liquids, SPC separates the graph of bond-dimensions into spatially distinct high and low density regions. When combined with our integral decimation algorithm, SPC facilitates the accurate compression of cyclic tensor networks with continuous degrees of freedom. To benchmark and illustrate the methods, we compute the absolute thermodynamics of $q$-state clock models on two-dimensional square lattices and an XY model on a Watts-Strogatz graph, which is a small-world network with random connectivity between spins.

Title: A Comprehensive Computational Framework for Materials Design, Ab Initio Modeling, and Molecular Docking
Authors: Md Rakibul Karim Akanda, Michael P. Richard
Abstract: To facilitate rational molecular and materials design, this research proposes an integrated computational framework that combines stochastic simulation, ab initio quantum chemistry, and molecular docking. The suggested workflow allows systematic investigation of structural stability, binding affinity, and electronic properties across biological and materials science domains by utilizing complementary tools like Avogadro for molecular construction and visualization, AutoDock for docking and interaction analysis, and ORCA for high-level electronic structure computations. Uncertainty, configurational sampling, and optimization in high-dimensional chemical spaces are addressed by combining Monte Carlo-based and annealing-inspired techniques. The work shows how materials science ideas such as polymer design, thin films, crystalline lattices, and bioelectronic systems can be applied to drug development. On-device, open-source computational methods are viable, scalable, and economical, as demonstrated by comparative platform analysis. All things considered, the findings highlight the need of an integrated, repeatable computational pipeline for speeding up de novo molecule assembly and materials architecture while lowering experimental risk and expense.

Title: Extended imaginary gauge transformation in a general nonreciprocal lattice
Authors: Yunyao Qi, Jinghui Pi, Yuquan Wu, Heng Lin, Chao Zheng, Gui-Lu Long
Abstract: Imaginary gauge transformation (IGT) provides a clear understanding of the non-Hermitian skin effect by transforming the non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with real spectra into Hermitian ones. In this paper, we extend this approach to the complex spectrum regime in a general nonreciprocal lattice model. We unveil the validity of IGT hinges on a class of pseudo-Hermitian symmetry. The generalized Brillouin zone of Hamiltonians respect such pseudo-Hermiticity is demonstrated to be a circle, which enables easy access to the continuum bands, localization length of skin modes, and relevant topological numbers. Furthermore, we investigate the applicability of IGT and the underlying pseudo-Hermiticity beyond nearest-neighbor hopping, offering a graphical interpretation. Our theoretical framework is applied to establish bulk-boundary correspondence in the nonreciprocal trimer Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model and to analyze the localization behaviors of skin modes in the two-dimensional Hatano-Nelson model.

Title: AI-Guided Discovery of Novel Ionic Liquid Solvents for Industrial CO2 Capture
Authors: Davide Garbelotto, Alexander Lobo, Urvi Awasthi, Oleg Medvedev, Srayanta Mukherjee, Anton Aristov, Konstantin Polunin, Alex De Mur, Leonid Zhukov, Azad Huseynov, Murad Abdullayev
Abstract: We present an AI-driven approach to discover compounds with optimal properties for CO2 capture from flue gas-refinery emissions' primary source. Focusing on ionic liquids (ILs) as alternatives to traditional amine-based solvents, we successfully identify new IL candidates with high working capacity, manageable viscosity, favorable regeneration energy, and viable synthetic routes. Our approach follows a five-stage pipeline. First, we generate IL candidates by pairing available cation and anion molecules, then predict temperature- and pressure-dependent CO2 solubility and viscosity using a GNN-based molecular property prediction model. Next, we convert solubility to working capacity and regeneration energy via Van't Hoff modeling, and then find the best set of candidates using Pareto optimization, before finally filtering those based on feasible synthesis routes. We identify 36 feasible candidates that could enable 5-10% OPEX savings and up to 10% CAPEX reductions through lower regeneration energy requirements and reduced corrosivity-offering a novel carbon-capture strategy for refineries moving forward.

Title: Understanding the temperature response of biological systems: Part II -- Network-level mechanisms and emergent dynamics
Authors: Simen Jacobs, Julian B. Voits, Nikita Frolov, Ulrich S. Schwarz, Lendert Gelens
Abstract: Building on the phenomenological and microscopic models reviewed in Part I, this second part focuses on network-level mechanisms that generate emergent temperature response curves. We review deterministic models in which temperature modulates the kinetics of coupled biochemical reactions, as well as stochastic frameworks, such as Markov chains, that capture more complex multi-step processes. These approaches show how Arrhenius-like temperature dependence at the level of individual reactions is transformed into non-Arrhenius scaling, thermal limits, and temperature compensation at the system level. Together, network-level models provide a mechanistic bridge between empirical temperature response curves and the molecular organization of biological systems, giving us predictive insights into robustness, perturbations, and evolutionary constraints.

Title: Physics-Informed Gaussian Process Regression for the Constitutive Modeling of Concrete: A Data-Driven Improvement to Phenomenological Models
Authors: Chenyang Li, Himanshu Sharma, Youcai Wu, Joseph Magallanes, K.T. Ramesh, Michael D. Shields
Abstract: Understanding and modeling the constitutive behavior of concrete is crucial for civil and defense applications, yet widely used phenomenological models such as Karagozian \& Case concrete (KCC) model depend on empirically calibrated failure surfaces that lack flexibility in model form and associated uncertainty quantification. This work develops a physics-informed framework that retains the modular elastoplastic structure of KCC model while replacing its empirical failure surface with a constrained Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) surrogate that can be learned directly from experimentally accessible observables. Triaxial compression data under varying confinement levels are used for training, and the surrogate is then evaluated at confinement levels not included in the training set to assess its generalization capability. Results show that an unconstrained GPR interpolates well near training conditions but deteriorates and violates essential physical constraints under extrapolation, even when augmented with simulated data. In contrast, a physics-informed GPR that incorporates derivative-based constraints aligned with known material behavior yields markedly better accuracy and reliability, including at higher confinement levels beyond the training range. Probabilistic enforcement of these constraints also reduces predictive variance, producing tighter confidence intervals in data-scarce regimes. Overall, the proposed approach delivers a robust, uncertainty-aware surrogate that improves generalization and streamlines calibration without sacrificing the interpretability and numerical efficiency of the KCC model, offering a practical path toward an improved constitutive models for concrete.

Title: Explosivity in 1-d Activated Random Walk
Authors: Nicolas Forien, Christopher Hoffman, Tobias Johnson, Josh Meisel, Jacob Richey, Leonardo T. Rolla
Abstract: We show that Activated Random Walk on $\mathbb{Z}$ is explosive above criticality. That is, activating a single particle in a supercritical state of sleeping particles triggers an infinite avalanche of activity with positive probability. This extends the same result recently proven by Brown, Hoffman, and Son for i.i.d. initial distributions to the setting of ergodic ones, thus completing the proof of a conjecture of Rolla's in dimension one. As a corollary we obtain that, for supercritical ergodic initial distributions with any positive density of particles initially active, the system will stay active almost surely. Our result is another piece of evidence attesting to the universality of the phase transition of Activated Random Walk on $\mathbb{Z}$.

Title: Many-body Quantum Score: a scalable benchmark for digital and analog quantum processors and first test on a commercial neutral atom device
Authors: Harold Erbin, Pierre-Louis Burdeau, Corentin Bertrand, Thomas Ayral, Grégoire Misguich
Abstract: We propose the Many-body Quantum Score (MBQS), a practical and scalable application-level benchmark protocol designed to evaluate the capabilities of quantum processing units (QPUs)--both gate-based and analog--for simulating many-body quantum dynamics. MBQS quantifies performance by identifying the maximum number of qubits with which a QPU can reliably reproduce correlation functions of the transverse-field Ising model following a specific quantum quench. This paper presents the MBQS protocol and highlights its design principles, supported by analytical insights, classical simulations, and experimental data. It also displays results obtained with Ruby, an analog QPU based on Rydberg atoms developed by the Pasqal company. These findings demonstrate MBQS's potential as a robust and informative tool for benchmarking near-term quantum devices for many-body physics.

Title: Tailoring Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions via Double-Mode Squeezing Manipulation
Authors: Kaiyuan Cao, Haodong Wang, Xiang-Ping Jiang, Shu chen, Jian Wang
Abstract: We propose a protocol to tailor dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) by double-mode squeezing onto the initial state in the XY chain. The effect of squeezing depends critically on the system's symmetry and parameters. When the squeezing operator breaks particle-hole symmetry (PHS), DQPTs become highly tunable, allowing one to either induce transitions within a single phase or suppress them. Remarkably, when PHS is preserved and the squeezing strength reaches $r=\pi/4$, a universal class of DQPTs emerges, independent of the quench path. This universality is characterized by two key features: (i) the collapse of all Fisher zeros onto the real-time axis, and (ii) the saturation of intermode entanglement to its maximum in each $(k,-k)$ modes. Moreover, the critical momenta governing the DQPTs coincide exactly with the modes attaining the maximal entanglement. At this universal point, the dynamical phase vanishes, leading to a purely geometric evolution marked by $\pi$-jumps in the Pancharatnam geometric phase. Our work establishes initial-state squeezing as a versatile tool for tailoring far-from-equilibrium criticality and reveals a direct link between entanglement saturation and universal nonanalytic dynamics.

Title: muT2-NMR: Micro-Scale Correlation Relaxometry for in-situ High-Pressure Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
Authors: Thomas Meier, Meng Yang, Yishan Zhou, Yunhua Fu, Rui Zhang, Ziliang Wang, Tianyao Zheng, Rajesh Jana, Takeshi Nakagawa
Abstract: Over the last decade, frequency-domain in-situ high-pressure nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in diamond anvil cells (DACs) has been employed as a structural and electronic probe of condensed matter systems at pressures well into the megabar range. However, extensive spin interactions and sample heterogeneities under pressure often lead to significant spectral overlap, inhibiting independent observation of chemically similar spin sub-species in the same sample. In this work, we introduce a time-domain relaxometry framework specifically suited for DAC experiments, named muT2-NMR. Experimental flexibility and operational robustness are benchmarked on three hydrogen-rich molecular solids at pressures up to 72 GPa. We demonstrate that muT2-NMR can resolve individual molecular subunits in relaxation space, paving the way for novel high-pressure, high-resolution NMR applications in molecular solids.

Title: Double interval entanglement in quasiparticle excited states
Authors: Zhouhao Guo, Jiaju Zhang
Abstract: We investigate double-interval entanglement measures, specifically reflected entropy, mutual information, and logarithmic negativity, in quasiparticle excited states for classical, bosonic, and fermionic systems. We develop an algorithm that efficiently calculates these measures from density matrices expressed in a non-orthonormal basis, enabling straightforward numerical implementation. We find a universal additivity property that emerges at large momentum differences, where the entanglement measures for states with distinct quasiparticle sets equal the sum of their individual contributions. The classical limit arises as a special case of this additivity, with both bosonic and fermionic results converging to classical behavior when all momentum differences are large.

Title: Protonic thermoelectric effect of Superionic H2O and magnetic field generation in Uranus and Neptune
Authors: Daohong Liu, Wei Zhang, Yu He, Xinzhuan Guo, Chuanyu Zhang, Yang Sun
Abstract: Uranus and Neptune are characterized by anomalously tilted and multi-dipole magnetic fields, which poses substantial challenges for elucidating the internal mechanisms generating magnetic fields. Recent investigations confirmed that superionic H2O is thermodynamically stable and constitutes the dominant H2O phase within their icy mantles. In this study, we demonstrate that the superionic H2O ice exhibits a pronounced protonic thermoelectric effect, in which the maximum Seebeck coefficient within the interior of Uranus can reach approximately 620 uV/K, whereas that of Neptune is lower, within the range of 570-585 uV/K. Consequently, temperature gradients in the icy mantles can induce proton convection, which in turn drives magnetic field generation. Based on this novel mechanism, the disparities in magnetic field strength between Uranus and Neptune can be accounted for exclusively by their differing internal temperature gradients, and the predicted values are in agreement with observations.

Abstract: Biomolecular condensates govern essential cellular processes yet elude description by traditional equilibrium models. This roadmap, distilled from structured discussions at a workshop and reflecting the consensus of its participants, clarifies key concepts for researchers, funding bodies, and journals. After unifying terminology that often separates disciplines, we outline the core physics of condensate formation, review their biological roles, and identify outstanding challenges in nonequilibrium theory, multiscale simulation, and quantitative in-cell measurements. We close with a forward-looking outlook to guide coordinated efforts toward predictive, experimentally anchored understanding and control of biomolecular condensates.

Title: Scalar vacuum densities on Beltrami pseudosphere
Authors: T. A. Petrosyan
Abstract: We investigate the combined effects of spatial curvature and topology on the properties of the vacuum state for a charged scalar field localized on the (2+1)-dimensional Beltrami pseudosphere, assuming that the field obeys quasiperiodicity condition with constant phase. As important local characteristics of the vacuum state the vacuum expectation values (VEVs) of the field squared and energy-momentum tensor are evaluated. The contributions in the VEVs coming from geometry with an uncompactified azimuthal coordinate are divergent, whereas the compact counterparts are finite and are analysed both numerically and asymptotically. For small values of proper radius of the compactified dimension, the leading terms of topological contributions are independent of the field mass and curvature coupling parameter, increasing by a power-law. In the opposite limit, the VEVs decay following a power-law in the general case. In the special case of a conformally coupled massless field the behavior is different. Unlike the VEV of field squared and vacuum energy density, the radial and azimuthal stresses are increasing by absolute value. As a consequence, the effects of nontrivial topology are strong for the stresses in this case at small values of radial coordinate.

Title: Gorkov algebraic diagrammatic construction for infinite nuclear matter
Authors: Francesco Marino, Carlo Barbieri, Gianluca Colò
Abstract: We propose an approximate many-body truncation for Gorkov self-consistent Green's function (SCGF) theory where pairing correlations are handled at first order, while the bulk of many-body correlations are described using the particle-number conserving Dyson-SCGF scheme up to third order in the algebraic diagrammatic construction, a method so far restricted to closed shell isotopes. The new method is enabled by the introduction of a scheme that allows to approximate the Gorkov propagator in terms of a particle-number-conserving optimized reference state. The approach provides state-of-the-art predictions of the equation of state and spectral properties of infinite nuclear matter at zero temperature and in the presence of pairing. We find satisfactory results using modern saturating Hamiltonians at next-to-next-to-leading order in chiral effective field theory.

Title: Learning Shrinks the Hard Tail: Training-Dependent Inference Scaling in a Solvable Linear Model
Authors: Noam Levi
Abstract: We analyze neural scaling laws in a solvable model of last-layer fine-tuning where targets have intrinsic, instance-heterogeneous difficulty. In our Latent Instance Difficulty (LID) model, each input's target variance is governed by a latent ``precision'' drawn from a heavy-tailed distribution. While generalization loss recovers standard scaling laws, our main contribution connects this to inference. The pass@$k$ failure rate exhibits a power-law decay, $k^{-\beta_\text{eff}}$, but the observed exponent $\beta_\text{eff}$ is training-dependent. It grows with sample size $N$ before saturating at an intrinsic limit $\beta$ set by the difficulty distribution's tail. This coupling reveals that learning shrinks the ``hard tail'' of the error distribution: improvements in the model's generalization error steepen the pass@$k$ curve until irreducible target variance dominates. The LID model yields testable, closed-form predictions for this behavior, including a compute-allocation rule that favors training before saturation and inference attempts after. We validate these predictions in simulations and in two real-data proxies: CIFAR-10H (human-label variance) and a maths teacher-student distillation task.

Title: DNA-Origami-Assembled Rhodium Nanoantennas for Deep-UV Label-Free Single-Protein Detection
Authors: Nicco Corduri, Malavika Kayyil Veedu, Yifan Yu, Yanqiu Zou, Jie Liu, Denis Garoli, Guillermo P. Acuna, Jérôme Wenger, Karol Kołątaj
Abstract: Nanoparticles of plasmonic metals have significantly to the development of spectroscopic techniques, enabling strong confinement of electromagnetic fields at the nanoscale and corresponding signal amplification. However, to date, plasmonic applications have been limited mainly to the visible and near-infrared range, as materials supporting ultraviolet resonances typically exhibit poor chemical stability and lack robust surface functionalisation methods. In this work, we address these limitations by introducing a fully programmable approach to UV plasmonics based on rhodium nanocube dimers assembled using DNA origami templates. We have developed a reliable ligand exchange strategy that allows the functionalisation of rhodium nanocubes with DNA while maintaining their colloidal stability. These DNA-modified nanocubes act as modular building blocks that can be assembled into dimers with 69% efficiency and an average gap size of 10 nm. The DNA origami design also allows for the deterministic placement of a single streptavidin protein in the plasmonic gap, unlike previous methods based on stochastic diffusion. Experiments with single-molecule autofluorescence in UV, supported by numerical simulations, show an increase in brightness of up to 22, a reduction in fluorescence lifetime, and a more than tenfold increase in the total number of detected photons. By creating a robust and versatile platform for the production of UV-resonant plasmonic nanoantennas, this work extends the functionality of plasmonics to the deep UV spectrum and opens up new possibilities for labelling-free single-protein spectroscopy.

Title: Topological Sensing in the Dynamics of Quantum Walks with Defects
Authors: Xiaowei Tong, Xingze Qiu, Xiang Zhan, Quan Lin, Kunkun Wang, Franco Nori, Peng Xue
Abstract: Topological quantum sensing leverages unique topological features to suppress noise and improve the precision of parameter estimation, emerging as a promising tool in both fundamental research and practical application. In this Letter, we propose a sensing protocol that exploits the dynamics of topological quantum walks incorporating localized defects. Unlike conventional schemes that rely on topological protection to suppress disorder and defects, our protocol harnesses the evolution time as a resource to enable precise estimation of the defect parameter. By utilizing topologically nontrivial properties of the quantum walks, the sensing precision can approach the Heisenberg limit. We further demonstrate the performance and robustness of the protocol through Bayesian estimation. Our results show that this approach maintains high precision over a broad range of parameters and exhibits strong robustness against disorder, offering a practical pathway for topologically enhanced quantum metrology.

Title: Phases of the $q$-deformed $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ Yang-Mills theory at large $N$
Authors: Tomoya Hayata, Yoshimasa Hidaka, Hiromasa Watanabe
Abstract: We investigate the $(2+1)$-dimensional $q$-deformed $\mathrm{SU}(N)_k$ Yang-Mills theory in the lattice Hamiltonian formalism, which is characterized by three parameters: the number of colors $N$, the coupling constant $g$, and the level $k$. By treating these as tunable parameters, we explore how key properties of the theory, such as confinement and topological order, emerge in different regimes. Employing a variational mean-field analysis that interpolates between the strong- and weak-coupling regimes, we determine the large-$N$ phase structure in terms of the 't Hooft coupling $\lambda_\mathrm{tH}=g^2N$ and the ratio $k/N$. We find that the topologically ordered phase remains robust at large $N$ under appropriate scalings of these parameters. This result indicates that the continuum limit of large-$N$ gauge theory may be more intricate than naively expected, and motivates studies beyond the mean-field theory, both to achieve a further understanding of confinement in gauge theories and to guide quantum simulations of large-$N$ gauge theories.

Title: Integration and Resource Estimation of Cryoelectronics for Superconducting Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computers
Authors: Shiro Kawabata
Abstract: Scaling superconducting quantum computers to the fault-tolerant regime calls for a commensurate scaling of the classical control and readout stack. Today's systems largely rely on room-temperature, rack-based instrumentation connected to dilution-refrigerator cryostats through many coaxial cables. Looking ahead, superconducting fault-tolerant quantum computers (FTQCs) will likely adopt a heterogeneous quantum-classical architecture that places selected electronics at cryogenic stages -- for example, cryo-CMOS at 4~K and superconducting digital logic at 4~K and/or mK stages -- to curb wiring and thermal-load overheads. This review distills key requirements, surveys representative room-temperature and cryogenic approaches, and provides a transparent first-order accounting framework for cryoelectronics. Using an RSA-2048-scale benchmark as a concrete reference point, we illustrate how scaling targets motivate constraints on multiplexing and stage-wise cryogenic power, and discuss implications for functional partitioning across room-temperature electronics, cryo-CMOS, and superconducting logic.

Title: Terahertz volume plasmon-polariton modulation in all-dielectric hyperbolic metamaterials
Authors: Stefano Campanaro, Luca Bussi, Stefano Curtarolo, Arrigo Calzolari
Abstract: The development of plasmonics and related applications in the terahertz range faces limitations due to the intrinsic high electron density of standard metals. All-dielectric systems are profitable alternatives, which allows for customized modulation of the optical response upon doping. Here we focus on plasmon-based hyperbolic metamaterials realized stacking doped III-V semiconductors that have been shown to be optically active in the terahertz spectral region. By using a multi-physics multi-scale theoretical approach, we unravel the role of doping and geometrical characteristics (e.g., thickness, composition, grating) in the modulation of high-k plasmon-polariton modes across the metamaterial.

Title: Surface Optimization of Aluminum Resonators for Robust Quantum Device Fabrication
Authors: Simon J. K. Lang, Ignaz Eisele, Alwin Maiwald, Emir Music, Luis Schwarzenbach, Carla Morán-Guizán, Johannes Weber, Daniela Zahn, Thomas Mayer, Rui N. Pereira, Christoph Kutter
Abstract: Aluminum remains the central material for superconducting qubits, and considerable effort has been devoted to optimizing its deposition and patterning for quantum devices. However, while post-processing of Nb- and Ta-based resonators has been widely explored, primarily focusing on oxide removal using buffered oxide etch (BOE), post-treatment strategies for Al resonators remain underdeveloped. This challenge becomes particularly relevant for industry-scale fabrication with multichip bonding, where delays between sample preparation and cooldown require surface treatments that preserve low dielectric loss during extended exposure to ambient conditions. In this work, we investigate surface modification approaches for Al resonators subjected to a 24-hour delay prior to cryogenic measurement. Passivation using self-limiting oxygen and fluorine chemistries was evaluated utilizing different plasma processes. Remote oxygen plasma treatment reduced dielectric losses, in contrast to direct plasma, likely due to additional ashing of residual resist despite the formation of a thicker oxide layer on both Si and Al surfaces. A fluorine-based plasma process was developed that passivated the Al surface with fluorine for subsequent BOE treatment. However, increasing fluorine incorporation in the aluminum oxide correlated with higher loss, identifying fluorine as an unsuitable passivation material for Al resonators. Finally, selective oxide removal using HF vapor and phosphoric acid was assessed for surface preparation. HF vapor selectively etched SiO2 while preserving Al2O3, whereas phosphoric acid exhibited the opposite selectivity. Sequential application of both etches yielded dielectric losses as low as $\delta_\mathrm{LP} = 5.2 \times 10^{-7}$ ($Q\mathrm{i} \approx 1.9\,\mathrm{M}$) in the single photon regime, demonstrating a promising pathway for robust Al-based resonator fabrication.

Title: Light-induced half-quantized Hall effect and axion insulator
Authors: Fang Qin, Ching Hua Lee, Rui Chen
Abstract: Motivated by the recent experimental realization of the half-quantized Hall effect phase in a three-dimensional (3D) semi-magnetic topological insulator [M. Mogi et al., Nature Physics 18, 390 (2022)], we propose a scheme for realizing the half-quantized Hall effect and axion insulator in experimentally mature 3D topological insulator heterostructures. Our approach involves optically pumping and/or magnetically doping the topological insulator surface, such as to break time reversal and gap out the Dirac cones. By toggling between left and right circularly polarized optical pumping, the sign of the half-integer Hall conductance from each of the surface Dirac cones can be controlled, such as to yield half-quantized ($0+1/2$), axion ($-1/2+1/2=0$), and Chern ($1/2+1/2=1$) insulator phases. We substantiate our results based on detailed band structure and Berry curvature numerics on the Floquet Hamiltonian in the high-frequency limit. Our paper showcases how topological phases can be obtained through mature experimental approaches such as magnetic layer doping and circularly polarized laser pumping and opens up potential device applications such as a polarization chirality-controlled topological transistor.

Title: Towards quantitative Low Energy Ion Scattering on CaSiO$_3$ from Comparison to Multiple-Scattering-Resolved Dynamical Binary Collision Approximation Simulations
Authors: Johannes Brötzner, Matthias Kogler, Paul S. Szabo, Lukas Kalchgruber, Andreas Nenning, Andreas Mutzke, Hans Hofsäss, Markus Valtiner, Richard A. Wilhelm
Abstract: We perform Low Energy Ion Scattering with He ions ranging in energy from 1 keV to 3 keV on CaSiO$_3$ using a commercial electrostatic detector system and determine the charge fraction of scattered ions from comparison with Binary Collision Approximation simulations. The simulations take composition changes due to surface cleaning Xe sputtering into account. Scattered He particles are separated in the simulation into single, dual, and multiple scattering trajectories. We find that the charge fraction of single and dual scattered He is about 10 times higher than the one for multiple collisions. Our results show that the charge fraction of scattered He can be reliably extracted for different scattering regimes and that for a given He incidence energy, the entire scattered He spectrum can be modeled with only few constant parameters.

Title: Enhanced Long Wavelength Mermin-Wagner Fluctuations in Two-Dimensional Active Crystals and Glasses
Authors: Subhodeep Dey, Antik Bhattacharya, Smarajit Karmakar
Abstract: In two-dimensions (2D), the Mermin-Wagner-Hohenberg (MWH) fluctuation plays a significant role, giving rise to striking dimensionality effects marked by long-range density fluctuations leading to the singularities of various dynamical properties. According to the MWH theorem, a 2D equilibrium system with continuous degrees of freedom cannot achieve long-range crystalline order at non-zero temperatures. Recently, MWH fluctuations have been observed in glass-forming liquids, evidenced by the logarithmic divergence in the plateau value of mean squared displacement (MSD). Our research investigates long-wavelength fluctuations in crystalline and glassy systems influenced by non-equilibrium active noises. Active systems serve as a minimal model for understanding diverse non-equilibrium dynamics, such as those in biological systems and self-propelled colloids. We demonstrate that fluctuations from active forces can strongly couple with long-wavelength density fluctuations, altering the lower critical dimension ($d_l$) from $2$ to $3$ and leading to a novel logarithmic divergence of the MSD plateau with system size in 3D.

Title: Pseudogap with Fermi arcs and Fermi pockets in half-filled twisted transition metal dichalcogenides
Authors: Yong-Yue Zong, Zhao-Long Gu, Jian-Xin Li
Abstract: Twisted transition metal dichalcogenides are a new platform for realizing strongly correlated physics with high tunability. Recent transport experiments [A. Ghiotto et al. Nature 597, 345 (2021)] have reported the bandwidth-driven evolution of a Mott insulator to a strange metal behavior via the tuning of a displacement field in twisted $\mathrm{WSe_2}$ fixed at half filling. However, the nature of the correlated states and the related Mott physics involved in the whole process remain to be determined. Here, we unveil theoretically the evolution of the ground state of the half-filled $\mathrm{moir\acute{e}}$ Hubbard model as applied to $\mathrm{tWSe_2}$, transiting from a pseudogap state with Fermi arcs to a $120^\circ$ Ne$\acute{\mathrm{e}}$l ordered Mott insulator, then to another pseudogap state with Fermi pockets, and eventually to a Fermi liquid via a Lifshitz transition. The pseudogap phases are definitely identified by the vanishing of quasiparticle weights over parts of the Fermi surface, with the remaining parts forming disconnected Fermi arcs or pockets with well-defined quasiparticles. We demonstrate that the Fermi arc/pocket results from the electronic band structure reconstruction driven by electron correlations, marked by the coexistence of the poles and zeros of the single-particle Green's function. This work reveals the fundamental aspects of the Mottness in $\mathrm{moir\acute{e}}$ system and will stimulate the direct probes of the underling physice beyond transports via the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy.

Abstract: Hybrid energy-harvesting systems combining perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with drop-driven triboelectric nanogenerators (D-TENGs) provide continuous power under various weather conditions. However, halide perovskites' vulnerability to moisture hampers widespread use. We present plasma-deposited fluorinated polymers (CFX) as multifunctional encapsulation layers offering water resistance, triboelectric functionality, and > 90 % optical transparency. These conformal, room-temperature, solvent-free coatings protect PSCs without reducing performance; encapsulated cells maintained a PCE of 17.9 %, and devices kept over 50 % of initial PCE after 10 days in high humidity and temperature. CFx layers also enabled compatibility with UV-curable resins, creating a hybrid PSC/D-TENG capable of harvesting solar and rain energy. This device retained 80 % of its performance after 300 hours of humid operation and stayed stable under continuous dripping and illumination for over 5 hours. Optimizing CFx's chemical composition improved triboelectric performance. Using the same CFx layer for encapsulation and triboelectric function, the device achieved 11.6 mA/cm2 short-circuit current under 0.5 sun and 12 V peak voltage per raindrop, enabling simultaneous solar and rain energy harvesting. A self-charging prototype powered LED arrays via a boost converter, demonstrating practical multisource energy harvesting.

Title: Dominant Kitaev Interaction and Field-induced Quantum Disordered Phase in the Cobaltate Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$

Abstract: The identification of quantum spin liquid phases in Kitaev candidate materials remains a major experimental challenge. Since most Kitaev candidates develop antiferromagnetic (AFM) order at low temperatures, currently there are great interest on the field-induced magnetic disordered phase in these compounds, that are distinct from (partially) polarized states. Recently, a cobaltate Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ has emerged as a promising Kitaev candidate with high-spin $t^{5}_{2g}e^2_g$ configuration and spin-orbit entangled $J_{\rm eff} = 1/2$ honeycomb lattice system. There are intensive studies on field-induced magnetic states and phase transitions under in-plane magnetic fields. In this study, we propose an intermediate disordered phase induced by an out-of-plane field along the $c$-axis, through high-field magnetization and magnetocaloric effect measurements. To explain the high-field behavior of Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$, we develop an effective $K$-$J$-$\Gamma$-$\Gamma^{\prime}$ spin model featuring a dominant AFM Kitaev interaction. This framework uncovers an intermediate quantum spin liquid phase, establishing the material as a unique platform for exploring Kitaev physics and field-induced quantum-disordered states.

Title: Interfacial Line Energy of a Topological Phase
Authors: Saikat Mondal, Adhip Agarwala
Abstract: In interacting topological systems, Landau-like order parameters interplay with the band topology of fermions. The physics of domain formation in such systems can get significantly altered due to the presence of topological fermions. In this work we show that coupling a topological fermionic field to a scalar field can drastically modify the nucleation processes. We find that existence of non-trivial fermionic boundary modes on the nucleating droplets of the scalar field leads to substantial quantum corrections to the interface energy. This leads to an increase in the size of the critical nucleus beyond which unrestricted droplet growth happens. To illustrate the phenomena we devise a minimal model of fermions in a Chern insulating system coupled to a classical Ising field in two spatial dimensions. Using a combination of analytic and numerical methods we conclusively demonstrate that topological phases have a characteristic quantum correction to the interfacial line energy. Apart from material systems, our work opens up a host of questions regarding the impact of fermionic topological terms on classical phase transitions and associated criticality.

Title: Estimation of spatial and time scales of collective behaviors of active matters through learning hydrodynamic equations from particle dynamics
Authors: Bappaditya Roy, Natsuhiko Yoshinaga
Abstract: We present a data-driven framework for learning hydrodynamic equations from particle-based simulations of active matter. Our method leverages coarse-graining in both space and time to bridge microscopic particle dynamics with macroscopic continuum models. By employing spectral representations and sparse regression, we efficiently estimate partial differential equations (PDEs) that capture collective behaviors such as flocking and phase separation. This approach, validated using hydrodynamic descriptions of the Vicsek model and Active Brownian particles, demonstrates the potential of data-driven strategies to uncover the universal features of collective dynamics in active matter systems.

Title: Nonlinear thermodynamic computing out of equilibrium
Authors: Stephen Whitelam, Corneel Casert
Abstract: We present the design for a thermodynamic computer that can perform arbitrary nonlinear calculations in or out of equilibrium. Simple thermodynamic circuits, fluctuating degrees of freedom in contact with a thermal bath and confined by a quartic potential, display an activity that is a nonlinear function of their input. Such circuits can therefore be regarded as thermodynamic neurons, and can serve as the building blocks of networked structures that act as thermodynamic neural networks, universal function approximators whose operation is powered by thermal fluctuations. We simulate a digital model of a thermodynamic neural network, and show that its parameters can be adjusted by genetic algorithm to perform nonlinear calculations at specified observation times, regardless of whether the system has attained thermal equilibrium. This work expands the field of thermodynamic computing beyond the regime of thermal equilibrium, enabling fully nonlinear computations, analogous to those performed by classical neural networks, at specified observation times.

Title: Discontinuous transition to active nematic turbulence
Authors: Malcolm Hillebrand, Ricard Alert
Abstract: Active fluids exhibit chaotic flows at low Reynolds number known as active turbulence. Whereas the statistical properties of the chaotic flows are increasingly well understood, the nature of the transition from laminar to turbulent flows as activity increases remains unclear. Here, through simulations of a minimal model of unbounded and defect-free active nematics, we find that the transition to active turbulence is discontinuous. We show that the transition features a jump in the mean-squared velocity, as well as bistability and hysteresis between laminar and chaotic flows. From distributions of finite-time Lyapunov exponents, we identify the transition at a value $A^*\approx 4900$ of the dimensionless activity number. Below the transition to chaos, we find subcritical bifurcations that feature bistability of different laminar patterns. These bifurcations give rise to oscillations and to chaotic transients, which become very long close to the transition to turbulence. Overall, our findings contrast with the continuous transition to turbulence in channel confinement, where turbulent puffs emerge within a laminar background. We propose that, without confinement, the long-range hydrodynamic interactions of Stokes flow suppress the spatial coexistence of different flow states, and thus render the transition discontinuous.

Title: Effective spin model with anisotropic exchange interactions for the spin-orbit coupled Hubbard model at half-filling
Authors: Ryo Makuta, Chisa Hotta
Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in noncentrosymmetric materials is the source of incommensurate magnetic structures. In semiconductors, it drives the Rashba spin splitting and spin momentum locking, while in magnetic insulators based on transition metals, it induces anisotropic spin exchange interactions, like the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction which drives chiral magnetism and skyrmion formation. Here, we establish a direct connection between SOC and spin exchange interactions by deriving an effective spin model from the SOC Hubbard model at half-filling. Using a strong-coupling expansion up to fourth order by including the full set of terms, we identify Heisenberg, Ising-like, and ring exchange interactions, as well as a variety of four-body terms for realistic Hubbard parameters, which impose strong constraints on the relative strengths of the spin interactions. Our spin model shows excellent agreement in energy with the SOC Hubbard model down $U/t \sim 5$ near the metal-insulator transition point, providing insight to which kind of magnetic interactions relevant across this regime are responsible for the emergence of complex magnetic textures.

Title: Magneto-optical Kerr effect in an A-type antiferromagnet
Authors: V. Sunko, S. Ahsanullah, V. Jain, S. Weber, S. Kumaran, J.-Q. Yan, J. Orenstein, D. Ovchinnikov
Abstract: Magneto-optic Kerr effect (MOKE) is a powerful probe of broken time-reversal symmetry ($\mathcal{T}$), typically used to study ferromagnets. While MOKE has been observed in some antiferromagnets (AFMs) with vanishing magnetization, it is often associated with structures whose symmetry is lower than basic collinear, bipartite order. In contrast, theory predicts a mechanism for MOKE intrinsic to all AFMs of A-type, i.e. layered AFMs in which ferromagnetic layers are antiferromagnetically aligned. Here we report the first experimental confirmation of this mechanism in a bulk AFM. We achieve this by measuring the imaginary component of MOKE as a function of photon energy in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$, an A-type AFM where $\mathcal{T}$ is preserved in combination with a translation. By comparing the experimental results with model calculations, we demonstrate that observable MOKE should be expected in all collinear A-type AFMs with out-of-plane spin order, thus enabling optical detection of AFM domains and expanding the scope of MOKE to few-layer AFMs.

Title: The maximum-average subtensor problem: equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium properties

Abstract: In this paper we introduce and study the Maximum-Average Subtensor ($p$-MAS) problem, in which one wants to find a subtensor of size $k$ of a given random tensor of size $N$, both of order $p$, with maximum sum of entries. We are motivated by recent work on the matrix case of the problem in which several equilibrium and non-equilibrium properties have been characterized analytically in the asymptotic regime $1 \ll k \ll N$, and a puzzling phenomenon was observed involving the coexistence of a clustered equilibrium phase and an efficient algorithm which produces submatrices in this phase. Here we extend previous results on equilibrium and algorithmic properties for the matrix case to the tensor case. We show that the tensor case has a similar equilibrium phase diagram as the matrix case, and an overall similar phenomenology for the considered algorithms. Additionally, we consider out-of-equilibrium landscape properties using Overlap Gap Properties and Franz-Parisi analysis, and discuss the implications or lack-thereof for average-case algorithmic hardness.

Title: Physical spin torques from exactly constrained exchange-correlation torques
Authors: Jacques K. Desmarais, Kamel Bencheikh, Giovanni Vignale, Stefano Pittalis
Abstract: The problem of capturing physical spin torques in non-collinear magnetic systems has dominated the scene of spin-density functional theory (SDFT) in the last two decades. Progress has been hindered by the fact that the spin torque is directly connected to the divergence of the spin current, a quantity that is {\em extraneous} to SDFT -- thus leading to {\em spurious} exchange-correlation (xc) torques in the spin dynamics. Moreover, SDFT cannot rigorously include vector potentials and spin-orbit couplings. Here, we propose a solution that exploits the U(1)$\times$SU(2)-invariance of the xc energy of SpinCurrent-DFT (SCDFT) -- an exact constraint that is not accessible to SDFT. Non-vanishing xc torques obtained on non-collinear solutions are constrained by the aforementioned exact internal symmetry and do not enter the propagation of the spin magnetization -- i.e., the spin dynamics involve {\em only} the physical currents and physical spin-torques.

Title: Programmable Quantum Anomalous Hall Insulator in Twisted Crystalline Flatbands
Authors: Wenxuan Wang, Yijie Wang, Zaizhe Zhang, Zihao Huo, Gengdong Zhou, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, X.C. Xie, Kaihui Liu, Zhida Song, Xiaobo Lu
Abstract: The isospin flavors in condensed matters can be continuously broken, forming various symmetry-broken quantum states. In moiré crystals, the competition between different isospin configurations can be effectively tuned by the twist angles and staciking orders. Here we report twisted double rhombohedral-trilayer-gaphene as a new twisted crystalline flatbands system showing rich moiré dependent topological phenomena. In devices with small twist angles, programmable Chern insulators with Chern number C = 3 at integer moiré filling v = 1 have been observed. We have further revealed an exotic hidden order which can quench the Chern insulator as well as multiple first-order transitions between different symmetry-broken phases. Interestly, in the device with a slightly larger twist angle, multiple Chern insulators with C = 1 at fractional moiré fillings including v = 1/4, 1/3 and 1/2 have been observed, whereas the Chern insulator at v = 1 is abscent. Our study demonstrated the twisted flatbands form rhombohedral-multilayer-graphene as a new platform to study tunable high Chern insulators as well as new devices for quantum storage and computation.

Title: Chiral anomaly-induced nonlinear Hall effect in spin-orbit coupled noncentrosymmetric metals
Authors: Gautham Varma K, Mohd. Hashim Raza, Azaz Ahmad
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that chiral anomaly is not limited to Weyl semimetals (WSMs), but are also shown by a larger class of materials called spin orbit coupled noncentrosymmetric metals (SOC-NCMs),which has shed more insight into the origin of chiral anomaly as a Fermi surface property rather than a nodal property. In this study, we explore nonlinear transport responses in SOC-NCMswithin the framework of semiclassical dynamics, employing the Maxwell-Boltzmann transport theory augmented by charge conservation and momentum-dependent scattering processes. We take into account both non-magnetic and magnetic impurity scattering mechanisms. We demonstrate that the chiral-anomaly-induced nonlinear Hall (CNLH) response exhibits a characteristic quadratic dependence on the applied magnetic field and remains negative for both types of impurities. We find that magnetic scatterers leading to enhanced/suppressed interband scattering modifies the magnitude of the signal, but does not affect its qualitative behavior. In contrast, the presence of tilt in the band dispersion induces a pronounced anisotropic response, including a magnetic-field-direction dependent sign reversal that can be categorized into weak and strong regimes. Furthermore, the CNLH response shows substantial directional anisotropy governed by the relative orientation of the external magnetic field and the tilt vector. Our findings will be helpful in designing the experimental setup to get direction-dependent conductivity, which can be tuned externally with the help of magnetic impurity sites.

Title: Electromagnetic responses of bilayer excitonic insulators: from exciton London equations to dipole and inverse dipole Hall effects
Authors: Yuelin Shao, Hao Shi, Xi Dai
Abstract: We develop a microscopic theory of the linear electromagnetic response of bilayer excitonic insulators relevant to electron-hole double-layer systems. Using a self-consistent Hartree-Fock description of the excitonic ground state and time-dependent Hartree-Fock for its dynamics, we compute the collective mode spectrum and the full first-order response to layer-symmetric (charge) and layer-antisymmetric (exciton) gauge fields. At zero magnetic field, we find that two gapped plasmon modes dominate the long-wavelength charge response, while the exciton channel is governed by a linearly dispersing phase (Goldstone) mode. From the Goldstone-dominated kernel we derive a London-like equation for the exciton condensate, demonstrating non-dissipative acceleration under a layer-antisymmetric electric field, which we identify as the direct evidence of exciton superfluid; in contrast, a normal exciton fluid shows a Drude-like, dissipative response. In a perpendicular magnetic field, the Goldstone mode develops a magnetic-roton minimum that signals an instability toward a finite-momentum stripe-ordered excitonic insulator. Besides, charge and exciton motions become coupled under the field, giving rise to dipole and inverse dipole Hall effects in which a charge (exciton) bias induces a transverse exciton (charge) current. As a manifestation of the exciton superfluidity, these mixed Hall responses remain finite even in the DC limit. Our findings provide concrete targets for microwave and transport probes of bilayer exciton superfluidity.

Title: Mechanisms of anomalous three-body loss in a population-imbalanced three-component Fermi gas
Authors: Kajsa-My Tempest, Chris H. Greene
Abstract: Achieving precise control of ultracold atomic gases requires a detailed understanding of atom loss mechanisms. Motivated by the anomalous three-body decay in a three-component Fermi gas reported in Ref. [1], this work investigates mechanisms that possibly contribute to the observed loss. The three-body Schrödinger equation is solved in the hyperspherical adiabatic representation with pairwise van der Waals interactions, and the $S$-matrix is obtained via the eigenchannel $R$-matrix method to compute recombination rate coefficients $K_3$ and two-body cross sections. At the magnetic field strength where the anomalous decay occurs, $K_3$ is unitary limited, exhibiting the threshold energy scaling $K_3(E)\propto E^{-1}$. Consequently, the thermally averaged $\langle K_3 \rangle$ acquires a temperature dependence. Because the experiment is performed in the degenerate regime, $\langle K_3 \rangle$ also explicitly depends on the per-spin densities through the per-spin Fermi energies $E_{F}^{(i)}\propto n_i^{2/3}$. As the gas is diluted and degeneracy is reduced, $\langle K_3 \rangle$ approaches the non-degenerate value and becomes a function of temperature only. Channel-resolved branching ratios and cross sections are folded into a Monte Carlo cascade simulation of secondary collisions and trap escape. The analysis indicates that typical three-body recombination events remove fewer than three atoms on average, and that the atom losses are primarily due to the ejection of secondary collision products, rather than the initial three-body recombination products. Therefore, a significant fraction of the released binding energy remains in the trapped ensemble as kinetic energy. Retained energy drives evaporative loss, offering a plausible, partial explanation for the anomalous decay.

Title: Origin of Reverse Size Effect in Ferroelectric Hafnia Thin Films
Authors: Tianyuan Zhu, Jingxuan Li, Zuhuang Chen, Shi Liu
Abstract: The persistence of ferroelectricity in ultrathin HfO$_2$ films challenges conventional theories, particularly given the paradoxical observation that the out-of-plane lattice spacing increases as the film thickness decreases, a reverse size effect absent in perovskite ferroelectrics. Here, we resolve this puzzle by revealing that this anomalous lattice expansion is counterintuitively coupled to a suppressed out-of-plane polarization. First-principles calculations combined with analytical modeling identify two mechanisms behind this expansion: a negative longitudinal piezoelectric response to the residual depolarization field and a positive surface stress that becomes significant at reduced thickness. Their interplay quantitatively reproduces the experimentally observed lattice expansion. Furthermore, (111)-oriented HfO$_2$ films can support out-of-plane polarization even under open-circuit conditions, in contrast to (001) films that stabilize a nonpolar ground state. This behavior points to the emergence of orientation-induced hyperferroelectricity, an unrecognized mechanism that enables polarization persistence through orientation engineering without electrode screening. We further demonstrate that this principle generalizes to conventional perovskites such as PbTiO$_3$, offering a strategy to eliminate the critical thickness limit by choosing the appropriate film orientation. As a practical pathway to device integration, we also identify the two-dimensional electride Ca$_2$N as a near-ideal electrode that fully restores the ferroelectric properties of HfO$_2$ in ultrathin capacitors.

Title: Ramp Josephson junctions of Al/Ti/Sr2RuO4: Observation of single-domain quantum oscillations and the detection of chiral edge current
Authors: Zixuan Li, Yiqun Alex Ying, Brian M. Zakrzewski, Yan Xin, Yu Wang, Zhiqiang Mao, Ying Liu
Abstract: The determination of how the phase of the superconducting order parameter in a superconductor varies with the spatial direction, which can be done only through the Josephson-effect-based phase-sensitive measurements, is crucial for the establishment of the precise pairing symmetry of the superconductor. So far, such measurements have been done on high-Tc cuprate superconductors but only at a couple of directions for Sr2RuO4 because of the difficulty in preparing Josephson junctions between Sr2RuO4 and an s-wave superconductor with a chosen mutual orientation. Another long-standing issue in Sr2RuO4, which was shown previously to feature a spontaneously broken time-reversal symmetry by muon spin rotation and other measurements, is that the expected presence of chiral surface currents, domains, and domain walls is yet to be explicitly shown experimentally. To address these issues, we have long sought the preparation of high-quality Josephson junctions between Sr2RuO4 and a conventional s-wave with a controllable orientation relative to symmetry axes in Sr2RuO4. We report in this article the successful fabrication of ramp Josephson junctions of Al/Ti/Sr2RuO4 on thin single crystals of Sr2RuO4 obtained by mechanical exfoliation. These junctions were found to show high-quality quantum oscillations consistent with a single-domain Josephson coupling. The normal junction resistance was found to depend extremely sensitively on the supercurrent flowing in the Sr2RuO4 crystal on which the Josephson junction was made. This finding was used in the present work to provide an estimate of the size of the chiral surface current, which is shown to agree with its upper bound established previously.

Title: Super-Solid phase in a U(2) symmetric S = 1 Magnet on the Triangular Lattice
Authors: Si-Cheng Wang, Zheng-Xin Liu
Abstract: A spin supersolid is characterized by the simultaneous breaking of lattice translation and continuous spin rotation symmetries. In this work, we study a spin-1 model with $U(2)\cong SU(2)\times U(1)/Z_2$ symmetry on the triangular lattice, and the phase diagram is figured out using a variational $\mathbb CP^2$ approach. We identify a novel $SU(2)$-supersolid phase which contains a 3-sublattice solid order and a spin-superfluid order. Unlike usual supersolid phases having noncollinear magnetic order and only one Goldstone mode, the $SU(2)$-supersolid phase has collinear Neel order and two Goldstone modes. Another important feature of this supersolid is that the magnon excitation spectrum has symmetry protected double degeneracy in the whole Brillouin zone. As by-products, several other ordered phases are obtained, including the ferromagnetic and the antiferromagnetic states breaking the $SU(2)$ symmetry, as well as genuine phases that completely break the $U(2)$ symmetry. Furthermore, the instabilities of $SU(3)$-flavor linear spin-wave theory are consistent with the phase boundaries between different ordered phases. %dispersions confirm the stability of the classically ordered phases and provides insights into their excitation spectra.

Title: libMobility: A Python library for hydrodynamics at the Smoluchowski level
Authors: Ryker Fish, Adam Carter, Pablo Diez-Silva, Rafael Delgado-Buscalioni, Raul P. Pelaez, Brennan Sprinkle
Abstract: Effective hydrodynamic modeling is crucial for accurately predicting fluid-particle interactions in diverse fields such as biophysics and materials science. Developing and implementing hydrodynamic algorithms is challenging due to the complexity of fluid dynamics, necessitating efficient management of large-scale computations and sophisticated boundary conditions. Furthermore, adapting these algorithms for use on massively parallel architectures like GPUs adds an additional layer of complexity. This paper presents the libMobility software library, which offers a suite of CUDA-enabled solvers for simulating hydrodynamic interactions in particulate systems at the Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa (RPY) level. The library facilitates precise simulations of particle displacements influenced by external forces and torques, including both the deterministic and stochastic components. Notable features of libMobility include its ability to handle linear and angular displacements, thermal fluctuations, and various domain geometries effectively. With an interface in Python, libMobility provides comprehensive tools for researchers in computational fluid dynamics and related fields to simulate particle mobility efficiently. This article details the technical architecture, functionality, and wide-ranging applications of libMobility. libMobility is available at this https URL.

Title: Spin Group Symmetry Criteria for Odd-parity Magnets
Authors: Xun-Jiang Luo, Jin-Xin Hu, Meng-Li Hu, K. T. Law
Abstract: Odd-parity magnets (OPMs) have recently emerged as a new magnetic class, but their general symmetry criteria remain elusive. In this Letter, we establish these criteria through a comprehensive spin group symmetry analysis. Concretely, we identify eight distinct symmetry-driven cases that support OPMs with collinear, coplanar, or noncoplanar magnetic order. These are classified into three classes based on their spin textures: collinear (type-I), coplanar (type-II), and noncoplanar (type-III). From the Magndata database, we identify 33 candidate OPM materials and diagnose their spin-splitting character ($p$- or $f$-wave) by analyzing the representation of spin textures within an emergent Laue group derived from the spin space group, which reveals a variety of novel spin textures. To validate the symmetry criteria, we construct and analyze two theoretical models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that OPMs can host an intrinsic $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology and propose a model for their realization. Our work provides a foundational framework for the future exploration of OPMs.

Zumbühl, Long Ju
Abstract: Spin-polarized superconductors offer a rare platform for studying electronic correlations, but few candidate systems have been experimentally confirmed to date. Here, we report the observation of a spin-polarized superconducting state, denoted SC5, in WSe2-proximitized rhombohedral trilayer graphene. At in-plane magnetic field B|| = 0 T, SC5 has a critical temperature of 68 mK and an out-of-plane critical magnetic field of only 12 mT. Surprisingly, these values are significantly enhanced as B|| increases, and the superconductivity persists to B|| = 8.8 T. This value corresponds to a record-high Pauli-limit violation ratio of at least 80 among all superconductors, while the true critical field is beyond the limit of our instrument. We conclude that SC5 experiences a canting crossover from Ising-type to spin-polarized superconductor with increased B||.

Abstract: Spin-based computing is emerging as a powerful approach for energy-efficient and high-performance solutions to future data processing hardware. Spintronic devices function by electrically manipulating the collective dynamics of the electron spin, that is inherently non-volatile, nonlinear and fast-operating, and can couple to other degrees of freedom such as photonic and phononic systems. This review explores key advances in integrating magnetic and spintronic elements into computational architectures, ranging from fundamental components like radio-frequency neurons/synapses and spintronic probabilistic-bits to broader frameworks such as reservoir computing and magnetic Ising machines. We discuss hardware-specific and task-dependent metrics to evaluate the computing performance of spin-based components and associate them with physical properties. Finally, we discuss challenges and future opportunities, highlighting the potential of spin-based computing in next-generation technologies.

Title: Tensor Renormalization-Group study of the surface critical behavior of a frustrated two-layer Ising model
Authors: Christophe Chatelain (LPCT)
Abstract: Two replicas of a 2D Ising model are coupled by frustrated spin-spin interactions. It is known that this inter-layer coupling is marginal and that the bulk critical behavior belongs to the Ashkin-Teller (AT) universality class, as the $J_1-J_2$ Ising model. In this work, the surface critical behavior is studied numerically by Tensor Renormalization-Group calculations. The Bond-Weight Tensor Renormalization Group algorithm is extended to tackle systems with boundaries. It is observed that the two-fold degeneracy of the surface magnetic scaling dimension of the AT model is lifted in the frustrated two-layer Ising model (F2LIM). The splitting is explained by the breaking of the ${\mathbb Z}_2$-symmetry under spin reversal of a single Ising replica in the F2LIM. The two distinct surface magnetic scaling dimensions $x_1^s$ and $x_2^s$ of the F2LIM satisfies a simple duality relation $x_1^s=1/4x_2^s$.

Title: Coulomb correlated multi-particle states of weakly confining GaAs quantum dots
Authors: Petr Klenovský
Abstract: We compute the electronic and emission properties of Coulomb-correlated multi-particle states (X$^0$, X$^\pm$, XX) in weakly confining GaAs/AlGaAs quantum dots using an 8-band $\mathbf{k}\!\cdot\!\mathbf{p}$ model coupled to continuum elasticity and configuration interaction (CI). We evaluate polarization-resolved oscillator strengths and radiative rates both in the dipole approximation (DA) and in a quasi-electrostatic beyond-dipole (BDA) longitudinal formulation implemented via a Poisson reformulation exactly equivalent to the dyadic Green-tensor kernel. For the dots studied, BDA yields lifetimes in quantitative agreement with experiment, e.g., $\tau^X=0.279\,\mathrm{ns}$ vs $0.267\,\mathrm{ns}$ (exp.) and $\tau^{XX}=0.101\,\mathrm{ns}$ vs $0.115\,\mathrm{ns}$ (exp.). The framework also reproduces electric-field tuning of the multi-particle electronic structure and emission -- including the indistinguishability inferred from $P=\tau^X/(\tau^X+\tau^{XX})$ -- and we assess sensitivity to CI-basis size and to electron-electron and hole-hole exchange.

Title: More is uncorrelated: Tuning the local correlations of SU($N$) Fermi-Hubbard systems via controlled symmetry breaking
Authors: Edoardo Zavatti, Gabriele Bellomia, Matteo Ferraretto, Samuele Giuli, Massimo Capone
Abstract: Cold-atom experiments based on alkali-like atoms provide us with a tool to experimentally realize Hubbard models with a large number $N$ of components. The value of $N$ can be seen as a new handle to tune the properties of the system, leading to new physics both in the case of fully SU($N$) symmetric systems, or in the presence of controlled symmetry breaking. We focus on the Mott transition at global half filling and we characterize local correlations between particles through the \emph{inter-flavor mutual information}, an experimentally accessible quantity that rigorously measures the distance from the closest gaussian state, unveiling features that cannot be accessed by conventional probes of Mottness. We prove that these correlations are fully independent from local entanglement and quantum discord, and, using Dynamical Mean-Field Theory, we show that the SU(4) system has significantly smaller correlations than the SU(2) counterpart. In the atomic limit we prove that increasing $N$ further decreases the strength of the correlations. This suggests that a controlled reduction of the symmetry, reducing the number of effective components, can be used to enhance the degree of correlation. We confirm this scenario solving the model for $N=4$ and gradually breaking the symmetry via a Raman field, revealing an evolution from the SU(4) to the SU(2) Mott transition as the symmetry-breaking term increases, with a sudden recovery of the large correlations of the SU(2) model at weak Raman coupling in the Mott state. By further exploring the interplay between energy repulsion and the Raman field, we obtain a rich phase diagram with three different phases -- a metal, a band insulator, and a Mott insulator -- all coexisting at a single tricritical point.

Title: Evidence for strong localization of orbital polarization
Authors: Taiyang Zhang, Lujun Zhu, Zhihao Yan, Lijun Zhu
Abstract: Whether orbital polarization propagates has become the most essential question of the blooming orbitronics that aims to generate non-local orbital torque and orbital pumping. Recent theories have suggested a strong orbital Hall effect within the light metal Al and a strong orbital Rashba effect at Co/Al interfaces, providing ideal platforms for experimental verification of possible orbital transport effects. Here, we report robust experimental evidence for the strong localization of orbital polarization. We demonstrate that neither the bulk nor the interface of the Al contributes a detectable orbital torque on adjacent magnetic layer with strong bulk and interfacial spin-orbit coupling necessary for potential orbital-spin conversion. These results have clarified that orbital polarization undergoes much faster relaxation than spin polarization and hardly participates in non-local accumulation, transport, or torque generation. The experimental evidence for strong localization of orbital polarization represents a groundbreaking advance towards solving the essential orbital torque debate.

Title: Superconductivity in Electron Liquids: Precision Many-Body Treatment of Coulomb Interaction
Authors: Xiansheng Cai, Tao Wang, Shuai Zhang, Tiantian Zhang, Andrew Millis, Boris V. Svistunov, Nikolay V. Prokof'ev, Kun Chen
Abstract: More than a century after discovery, the theory of conventional superconductivity remains incomplete. While the importance of electron-phonon coupling is understood, a controlled first-principles treatment of Coulomb interaction is lacking. Current ab initio calculations of superconductivity rely on a phenomenological downfolding approximation, replacing Coulomb interaction with a repulsive pseudopotential \mu*, and leaving ambiguities in electron-phonon coupling with dynamical Coulomb interactions unresolved. We address this via an effective field theory approach, integrating out high-energy electronic degrees of freedom using variational Diagrammatic Monte Carlo. Applied to the uniform electron gas, this establishes a microscopic procedure to implement downfolding, define the pseudopotential, and express dynamical Coulomb effects on electron-phonon coupling via the electron vertex function. We find the bare pseudopotential significantly larger than conventional values. This yields improved pseudopotential estimates in simple metals and tests density functional perturbation theory accuracy for effective electron-phonon coupling. We present an ab initio workflow computing superconducting Tc from the anomalous vertex's precursory Cooper flow. This infers Tc from normal state calculations, enabling reliable estimates of very low Tc (including near quantum phase transitions) beyond conventional reach. Validating our approach on simple metals without empirical tuning, we resolve long-standing discrepancies and predict a pressure-induced transition in Al from superconducting to non-superconducting above ~60GPa. We propose ambient-pressure Mg and Na are proximal to a similar critical point. Our work establishes a controlled ab initio framework for electron-phonon superconductivity beyond the weak-correlation limit, paving the way for reliable Tc calculations and novel material design.

Title: Quantum tunneling and defect-induced transport modulation in twisted bilayer graphene superlattices
Authors: Ayoub Bahlaoui, Youness Zahidi, Ahmed Naddami
Abstract: We investigate quantum tunneling of charge carriers through a periodic superlattice in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) with rectangular potential barriers, including the presence of a defect, using a low-energy continuum model. Transmission probabilities are numerically analyzed depending on the parameters of the problem, highlighting the roles of twist angle, number of barriers, barrier geometry, and the presence of a defect barrier within the superlattice. Our numerical results reveal that transmission is highly sensitive to these parameters: reducing the twist angle changes the number, depth, and position of transmission gaps and resonance peaks. The presence of defect affects the transmission, leading to the appearance of tunneling states inside transmission gaps with energy position can be tuned by the well width. At low incident energy, the transmission for normally incident electrons is perfect or nearly perfect, independent of the twist angle and the number of barriers. However, at large incident energy, the transmission becomes distinctly anisotropic, reflecting the separation of Dirac cones induced by twist angle variations. The presence of defects, particularly at smaller twist angles, provides additional control of tunneling behavior, allowing complete suppression of Klein tunneling under certain conditions. These findings extend the established understanding of miniband transport in periodic graphene systems and open new possibilities for twist-tunable nanoelectronic and quantum devices.

Title: Non-Hermitian higher-order topological insulators enabled by altermagnet engineering
Authors: Xiang Ji, Dengfeng Wang, Tong Zhou, Xiaosen Yang
Abstract: We show that proximity to an altermagnet provides an efficient route to engineering non-Hermitian higher-order topological phases. The proximity-induced altermagnetic order gaps the edge states of a topological insulator, thereby driving a transition from a first-order to a second-order topological phase. When combined with nonreciprocal hopping, the system exhibits both the non-Hermitian skin effect and a hybrid skin-topological effect, whereby first-order edge states and second-order corner states accumulate at selected corners of the lattice. We demonstrate that the spectral winding number of the edge states under cylindrical geometry dictates this corner localization and can be reversed by tuning the altermagnetic order. Consequently, both edge and corner states become directionally controllable. Our results establish altermagnets as a versatile platform for realizing and tuning skin-topological phenomena in non-Hermitian higher-order topological systems.

Title: Open quantum theory of magnetoresistance in mesoscopic magnetic materials
Authors: Xian-Peng Zhang, Xiangrong Wang, Yugui Yao
Abstract: Magnetoresistance (MR) in magnetic materials arises from spin-exchange coupling between local moments and itinerant electrons, representing a challenging many-body open-quantum problem. Here we develop a comprehensive microscopic theory of MR within an open-quantum-system framework by solving the Liouville-von Neumann equation for a hybrid system of free electrons and local moments using the time-convolutionless projection operator method. Our approach reveals both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic MR as consequences of temperature- and field-dependent spin decoherence, encompassing spin relaxation and dephasing. In particular, the resistance associated with spin decoherence is governed by the order parameters of magnetic materials, such as the magnetization in ferromagnets and the Néel vector in antiferromagnets. This theory deepens the fundamental understanding of MR and offers guidance for interpreting and designing experiments on magnetic materials.

Title: Evidence for the suppression of the hybrid skin-topological effect by fragile topology
Authors: Tianrui Liu
Abstract: Topological insulators are well-known for their topological edge states, which are protected by the non-trivial bulk topology and characterized by gapless Wannier bands, a phenomenon known as the bulk-boundary correspondence. However, fragile topology challenged this concept, the Wannier bands are gapped, but the edge states still exist with similar protection. Previous studies on fragile topology have primarily focused on the spectral flow under twisted boundary conditions, but the discussion on the physical interpretation of the Wannier gap is limited. In this study, we introduce a bilayer breathing honeycomb lattice with spiral interlayer couplings inside the unit cell. As we increase the interlayer coupling strength, the Wannier gap increases monotonically and the bandgap first increases then decreases. After introducing a gain-loss domain wall, the hybrid skin-topological effect (HSTE) emerges, and the topological edge states under the periodic boundary condition (PBC) change into corner states under the open boundary condition (OBC) associated with the significant spectral difference. HSTE is suppressed as the interlayer coupling strength increases, the spectral difference between the two boundary conditions has an overall decreasing trend, which more closely mirrors the evolution of the inverse of the Wannier gap. Moreover, some of the corner states transform into edge states. Our work first provides evidence for the relation between fragile topology and HSTE, shedding new insights into the underlying mechanism of Non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE).

Title: Chiral Dynamics Near Intra- and Inter-Band Exceptional Points under Dissipative Spin-Orbital-Angular-Momentum Coupling
Authors: Bo-Wen Liu, Ke-Ji Chen, Fan Wu, Wei Yi
Abstract: We study the parametric chiral dynamics of atoms under dissipative spin-orbital-angular-momentum coupling (SOAMC). With atoms confined in the ring-shaped potential of the Laguerre-Gaussian Raman beams, the SOAMC not only couples the atomic center-of-mass angular momentum to the hyperfine spins, but also mixes different bands in the radial direction. This gives rise to a series of exceptional points of two types, the intra-band and the inter-band. Leveraging the topology of the spectral Riemann surface close to these exceptional points, we demonstrate the path-dependent chiral transfer of atoms to the higher-lying bands, by evolving the system along closed loops in the parameter space. Specifically, we illustrate two distinct scenarios, characterized by different mechanisms, where the atoms can be transferred to designated SOAMC-dressed bands. Our work demonstrates the rich exceptional structure in atom gases under dissipative SOAMC, and offers a novel route toward populating higher bands.

Title: Strong anchoring boundary conditions in nematic liquid crystals: Higher-order corrections to the Oseen-Frank limit and a revised small-domain theory
Authors: Prabakaran Rajamanickam
Abstract: Strong anchoring boundary conditions are conventionally modelled by imposing Dirichlet conditions on the order parameter in Landau--de Gennes theory, neglecting the finite surface energy of realistic anchoring. This work revisits the strong anchoring limit for nematic liquid crystals in confined two-dimensional domains. By explicitly retaining a Rapini-Papoular surface energy and adopting a scaling where the extrapolation length $l_{ex}$ is comparable to the coherence length $\xi$, we analyse both the small-domain ($\epsilon = h/\xi\to 0$; $h$ is the domain size) and Oseen-Frank $(\epsilon \to \infty$) asymptotic regimes. In the small-domain limit, the leading-order equilibrium solution is given by the average of the boundary data, which can vanish in symmetrically frustrated geometries, leading to isotropic melting. In the large-domain limit, matched asymptotic expansions reveal that surface anchoring introduces an $O(1/\epsilon)$ correction to the director field near boundaries, in contrast to the $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ correction predicted by Dirichlet conditions. The analysis captures the detailed structure of interior and boundary defects, showing that mixed (Robin-type) boundary conditions yield smoother defect cores and more physical predictions than rigid Dirichlet conditions. Numerical solutions for square and circular wells with tangential anchoring illustrate the differences between the two boundary condition treatments, particularly in defect morphology. The results demonstrate that a consistent treatment of anchoring energetics is essential for accurate modelling of nematic equilibria in micro- and nano-scale confined geometries.

Title: Kinetic Flux Equations for Ion Exchange in Silicate Glasses
Authors: Guglielmo Macrelli
Abstract: Ion exchange kinetic flux equations have been extensively investigated since the mid-twentieth century and continue to provide a fundamental framework for describing mass transport phenomena in solid materials. Despite the maturity of this field, inconsistencies remain in the literature concerning the definition, dimensional consistency, and physical interpretation of the parameters involved. A rigorous and unified treatment of these equations is therefore essential to ensure the reproducibility and comparability of theoretical and experimental studies. The present study aims to establish a coherent and systematic development of ion exchange kinetic flux equations, with particular emphasis on the consistent definition and dimensional formulation of the relevant physical quantities. Beyond refining the theoretical foundations, this study extends the classical formulation by incorporating the influence of mechanical stress on ion transport and considering cross-term interactions within the framework of linear irreversible thermodynamics. These developments provide a more comprehensive description of ion exchange kinetics, particularly as applied to silicate glasses, where coupling between chemical and mechanical effects plays a crucial role in determining transport behavior and performance.

Title: Inference in conditioned dynamics through causality restoration
Authors: Alfredo Braunstein, Giovanni Catania, Luca Dall'Asta, Matteo Mariani, Anna Paola Muntoni
Abstract: Computing observables from conditioned dynamics is typically computationally hard, because, although obtaining independent samples efficiently from the unconditioned dynamics is usually feasible, generally most of the samples must be discarded (in a form of importance sampling) because they do not satisfy the imposed conditions. Sampling directly from the conditioned distribution is non-trivial, as conditioning breaks the causal properties of the dynamics which ultimately renders the sampling procedure efficient. One standard way of achieving it is through a Metropolis Monte-Carlo procedure, but this procedure is normally slow and a very large number of Monte-Carlo steps is needed to obtain a small number of statistically independent samples. In this work, we propose an alternative method to produce independent samples from a conditioned distribution. The method learns the parameters of a generalized dynamical model that optimally describe the conditioned distribution in a variational sense. The outcome is an effective, unconditioned, dynamical model, from which one can trivially obtain independent samples, effectively restoring causality of the conditioned distribution. The consequences are twofold: on the one hand, it allows us to efficiently compute observables from the conditioned dynamics by simply averaging over independent samples. On the other hand, the method gives an effective unconditioned distribution which is easier to interpret. The method is flexible and can be applied virtually to any dynamics. We discuss an important application of the method, namely the problem of epidemic risk assessment from (imperfect) clinical tests, for a large family of time-continuous epidemic models endowed with a Gillespie-like sampler. We show that the method compares favorably against the state of the art, including the soft-margin approach and mean-field methods.

Title: Reflected multi-entropy and its holographic dual
Authors: Ma-Ke Yuan, Mingyi Li, Yang Zhou
Abstract: We introduce a mixed-state generalization of the multi-entropy through the canonical purification, which we call reflected multi-entropy. We propose the holographic dual of this measure. For the tripartite case, a field-theoretical calculation is performed using a six-point function of twist operators at large $c$ limit. At both zero and finite temperature, the field-theoretical results match the holographic results, supporting our holographic conjecture of this new measure.

Title: Counterflow and coflow instabilities in miscible binary superfluids
Authors: Yuping An, Blaise Goutéraux, Li Li
Abstract: We explore instabilities in binary superfluids with a nonvanishing relative superflow, particularly focusing on counterflow and coflow instabilities. We extend recent results on the thermodynamic origin of finite superflow instabilities in single-component superfluids to binary systems and derive a criterion for the onset of instability through a hydrodynamic analysis, which applies to interacting many-body systems at finite temperature. We find that the onset of these instabilities is signaled by the determinant of the Hessian of the thermal free energy diverging and changing sign. We verify this hydrodynamic prediction in a holographic binary superfluid modeled with gauge/gravity duality, which naturally incorporates strong coupling, finite temperature, and dissipation. We also compare to results obtained using the Gross-Pitaevskii equation for weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensates and find that the same criterion continues to apply at zero temperature, where it reduces to evaluating derivatives of the supercurrents with respect to the superfluid velocities. We observe that the critical velocities of these instabilities follow a general scaling law related to the interaction strength between superfluid components. Finally, the nonlinear stages of the instabilities are studied by full time evolution using gauge/gravity duality, where vortex annihilation leads to a decrease of superfluid velocity back to a value where the binary superfluid phase is stable.

Title: High-temperature partition functions and classical simulatability of long-range quantum systems
Authors: Jorge Sánchez-Segovia, Jan T. Schneider, Álvaro M. Alhambra
Abstract: Long-range quantum systems, in which the interactions decay as $1/r^{\alpha}$, are of increasing interest due to the variety of experimental set-ups in which they naturally appear. Motivated by this, we study fundamental properties of long-range spin systems in thermal equilibrium, focusing on the weak regime of $ \alpha>D$. Our main result is a proof of analiticity of their partition functions at high temperatures, which allows us to construct a classical algorithm with sub-exponential runtime $\exp(\mathcal{O}(\log^2(N/\epsilon)))$ that approximates the log-partition function to small additive error $\epsilon$. As by-products, we establish the equivalence of ensembles and the Gaussianity of the density of states, which we verify numerically in both the weak and strong long-range regimes. This also yields constraints on the appearance of various classes of phase transitions, including thermal, dynamical and excited-state ones. Our main technical contribution is the extension to the quantum long-range regime of the convergence criterion for cluster expansions of Kotecký and Preiss.

Title: Hierarchic superradiant phases in anisotropic Dicke model
Authors: D. K. He, Z. Song
Abstract: We revisit the phase diagram of an anisotropic Dicke model by revealing the non-analyticity induced by underlying exceptional points. We find that, from a dynamical perspective, the conventional superradiant phase can be further separated into three regions, in which the systems are characterized by different effective Hamiltonians, including the harmonic oscillator, the inverted harmonic oscillator, and their respective counterparts. We employ the Loschmidt echo to characterize different quantum phases by analyzing the quench dynamics of a trivial initial state. Numerical simulations for finite systems confirm our predictions about the existence of hierarchic superradiant phases.

Title: Dynamically tuneable helicity in twisted electromagnetic resonators
Authors: E. C. I. Paterson, M. E. Tobar, M. Goryachev, J. Bourhill
Abstract: We report the generation of helical electromagnetic radiation in a microwave cavity resonator, achieved by introducing mirror asymmetry, i.e., chirality, through a controlled geometric twist of the conducting boundary conditions. The emergence of electromagnetic helicity is attributed to a nonzero spatial overlap between the electric and magnetic mode eigenvectors, quantified by $\text{Im}\left[\vec{\mathbf{E}}_i(\vec{r})\cdot{\vec{\mathbf{H}}}_i^*(\vec{r})\right]$, a feature not observed in conventional cavity resonators. This phenomenon originates from magnetoelectric coupling between nearly degenerate transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) modes, resulting in a measurable frequency shift of the resonant modes as a function of the twist angle, $\phi$. In addition to the bulk helicity induced by global geometric twist, internal helical corrugations break structural symmetry on the surface, introducing an effective surface chirality $\kappa_{\text{eff}}$, which perturbs the resonant conditions and contributes to asymmetric frequency tuning. By dynamically varying $\phi$, we demonstrate real-time, macroscopic manipulation of both electromagnetic helicity and resonant frequency. Furthermore, we investigate the underlying mode-coupling dynamics of the system, highlighting strong photon-photon interactions.

Title: Lindbladian versus Postselected Non-Hermitian Topology
Authors: Alexandre Chaduteau, Derek K. K. Lee, Frank Schindler
Abstract: The recent topological classification of non-Hermitian `Hamiltonians' is usually interpreted in terms of pure quantum states that decay or grow with time. However, many-body systems with loss and gain are typically better described by mixed-state open quantum dynamics, which only correspond to pure-state non-Hermitian dynamics upon a postselection of measurement outcomes. Since postselection becomes exponentially costly with particle number, we here investigate to what extent the most important example of non-Hermitian topology can survive without it: the non-Hermitian skin effect and its relationship to a bulk winding number in one spatial dimension. After defining the winding number of the Lindbladian superoperator for a quadratic fermion system, we systematically relate it to the winding number of the associated postselected non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. We prove that the two winding numbers are equal (opposite) in the absence of gain (loss), and provide a physical explanation for this relationship. When both loss and gain are present, the Lindbladian winding number typically remains quantized and non-zero, though it can change sign at a phase transition separating the loss and gain-dominated regimes. This transition, which leads to a reversal of the Lindbladian skin effect localization, is rendered invisible by postselection. We also identify a case where removing postselection induces a skin effect from otherwise topologically trivial non-Hermitian dynamics.

Title: Criticality in 1-dimensional field theories with mesoscopic, infinite range interactions
Authors: Kurt Langfeld, Amanda Turner
Abstract: This research investigates a novel class of one-dimensional theories characterised by a distinctly defined infinite interaction range. We propose that such theories emerge naturally through a mesoscopic feedback mechanism. In this proof-of-concept study, we examine Ising-type models and a model with continuous O(3) symmetry, and demonstrate that the natural emergence of phase transitions, criticality, spontaneous symmetry breaking and previously unidentified universality classes is evident. The framework introduced here holds particular relevance for monolayer spintronics research, where the ultimate goal is to achieve a strong ferromagnetic order at room temperature.

Title: Theory of dynamical superradiance in organic materials
Authors: Lukas Freter, Piper Fowler-Wright, Javier Cuerda, Brendon W. Lovett, Jonathan Keeling, Päivi Törmä
Abstract: We develop the theory of dynamical superradiance -- the collective exchange of energy between an ensemble of initially excited emitters and a single-mode cavity -- for organic materials where electronic states are coupled to vibrational modes. We consider two models to capture the vibrational effects: first, vibrations treated as a Markovian bath for two-level emitters, via a pure dephasing term in the Lindblad master equation for the system; second, vibrational modes directly included in the system via the Holstein--Tavis--Cummings Hamiltonian. By exploiting the permutation symmetry of the emitters and weak U(1) symmetry, we develop a numerical method capable of exactly solving the Tavis-Cummings model with local dissipation for up to 140 emitters. Using the exact method, we validate mean-field and second-order cumulant approximations and use them to describe macroscopic numbers of emitters. We analyse the dynamics of the average cavity photon number, electronic coherence, and Bloch vector length, and show that the effect of vibrational mode coupling goes beyond simple dephasing. Our results show that superradiance is possible in the presence of vibrational mode coupling; for negative cavity detunings, the vibrational coupling may even enhance superradiance. We identify asymmetry of the photon number rise time as a function of the detuning of the cavity frequency as an experimentally accessible signature of such vibrationally assisted superradiance.

Title: Quantum information-cost relations and fluctuations beyond thermal environments: A thermodynamic inference approach
Authors: Yuanyuan Xiao, Jian-Hua Jiang, Junjie Liu
Abstract: The Landauer's principle, a cornerstone of information thermodynamics, provides a fundamental lower bound on the energetic cost of information erasure in terms of the information content change. However, its traditional formulation is largely confined to systems exchanging solely energy with an ideal thermal bath. In this work, we derive general information-cost trade-off relations that go beyond the scope of Landauer's principle by developing a thermodynamic inference approach based on the maximum entropy principle. These relations require only information about the system and are applicable to complex quantum scenarios involving multiple conserved charges and non-thermal environments. Specifically, we present two key results: (i) In scenarios where only the mean values of observables are accessible, we derive an information-content-informed upper bound on the thermodynamic cost which complements an existing generalized Landauer lower bound. (ii) When second-order fluctuations can also be measured, we obtain an information-content-informed lower bound on the change in variances of observables, thereby extending the Landauer's principle to constrain higher-order fluctuation costs. We numerically validate our information-cost trade-off relations using a coupled-qubit system exchanging energy and excitations, a driven qubit implementing an information erasure process, and a driven double quantum dot system that can operate as an inelastic heat engine. Our results underscore the broad utility of maximum-entropy inference in constraining thermodynamic costs for generic finite-time quantum processes, with direct relevance to quantum information processing and quantum thermodynamic applications.

Title: Agentic Exploration of Physics Models
Authors: Maximilian Nägele, Florian Marquardt
Abstract: The process of scientific discovery relies on an interplay of observations, analysis, and hypothesis generation. Machine learning is increasingly being adopted to address individual aspects of this process. However, it remains an open challenge to fully automate the heuristic, iterative loop required to discover the laws of an unknown system by exploring it through experiments and analysis, without tailoring the approach to the specifics of a given task. Here, we introduce SciExplorer, an agent that leverages large language model tool-use capabilities to enable exploration of systems without any domain-specific blueprints, and apply it to physical systems that are initially unknown to the agent. We test SciExplorer on a broad set of models spanning mechanical dynamical systems, wave evolution, and quantum many-body physics. Despite using a minimal set of tools, primarily based on code execution, we observe impressive performance on tasks such as recovering equations of motion from observed dynamics and inferring Hamiltonians from expectation values. The demonstrated effectiveness of this setup opens the door towards similar scientific exploration in other domains, without the need for finetuning or task-specific instructions.

Title: Stochastic interpretation of quantum mechanics
Authors: Mário J. de Oliveira
Abstract: We express the probabilistic character associated to the wave function by treating it as a stochastic variable. This is accomplished by means of a stochastic equation for the wave function whose noise changes the phase of the wave function but not its absolute value, so that the norm of the wave function is strictly conserved along a stochastic trajectory. We show that the density matrix that obeys the quantum Liouville equation is the covariance matrix associated to the stochastic wave function.

Title: Spectral statistics and energy-gap scaling in $k-$local spin Hamiltonians
Authors: Sasanka Dowarah
Abstract: We investigate the spectral properties of all-to-all interacting spin Hamiltonians acting on exactly $k$ spins, whose coupling coefficients are drawn from a normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$. For $\mu = 0$, we demonstrate that the random matrix ensemble -- Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE), Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE), or Gaussian Symplectic Ensemble (GSE) -- is determined by the parity of system size $L$ and locality $k$, following standard time-reversal symmetry classification. For couplings with a nonzero mean, we map the Hamiltonians to deformed random matrix ensembles and analyze conditions for an energy gap between the ground state and the first excited state. For $\mu < 0$, we find two distinct regimes: for $k \gg \sqrt{L}$, the gap closes at critical disorder $\sigma_{c} \approx |\mu|$. Near this transition the energy gap $\Delta$ exhibits universal quadratic scaling $\Delta /L \sim (\sigma - \sigma_{c})^{2}$. When $k \ll \sqrt{L}$, $\sigma_{c}$ scales with $|\mu|$, but lacks a sharp transition. Our work introduces a semi-solvable model that captures universal features of random-matrix statistics, and spectral gap formation, providing a foundation for systematic extensions to more general many-body systems.

Title: Ground state energy and phase transitions of Long-range XXZ using VQE
Authors: Mrinal Dev, Shraddha Sharma
Abstract: The variational quantum eigen solver (VQE), has been widely used to find the ground state energy of different Hamiltonians with no analytical solutions and are classically difficult to compute. In our work, we have used VQE to identify the phase transition boundary for an infinite order phase transition. We use long-range XXZ (LRXXZ) chain for our study. In order to probe infinite order phase transition, we propose to utilise the ground state energy obtained from VQE. The idea rests on the argument that VQE requires an ansatz circuit; therefore, the accuracy of the VQE will rely on this ansatz circuit. We have designed this circuit such that the estimated ground state energy is sensitive to the phase it is evaluated in. It is achieved by applying the constraint that the net spin remains constant throughout the optimisation process. Consequently, the ansatz works in a certain phase where it gives relatively small random error, as it should, when compared to the error in ground state energy calculations of the other phases, where the ansatz fails. By identifying these changes in the behaviour of the error in ground state energy using VQE, we were able to determine the phase boundaries. Using exact diagonalisation, we also compare the behaviour of the energy gradient and energy gap across both the phase transition boundaries for this model. Further, by increasing the depth of the optimisation circuit, we also accurately evaluate the ground energy of the LRXXZ chain for the value of coupling constant, J equal to -1

Title: Masgent: An AI-assisted Materials Simulation Agent
Authors: Guanghen Liu, Songge Yang, Yu Zhong
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning potentials (MLPs) are essential for predicting and understanding materials properties, yet preparing, executing, and analyzing these simulations typically requires extensive scripting, multi-step procedures, and significant high-performance computing (HPC) expertise. These challenges hinder reproducibility and slow down discovery. Here, we introduce Masgent, an AI-assisted materials simulation agent that unifies structure manipulation, automated VASP input generation, DFT workflow construction and analysis, fast MLP-based simulations, and lightweight machine learning (ML) utilities within a single platform. Powered by large language models (LLMs), Masgent enables researchers to perform complex simulation tasks through natural-language interaction, eliminating most manual scripting and reducing setup time from hours to seconds. By standardizing protocols and integrating advanced simulation and data-driven tools, Masgent lowers the barrier to performing state-of-the-art computational methodologies, enabling faster hypothesis testing, pre-screening, and exploratory research for both new and experienced practitioners.
