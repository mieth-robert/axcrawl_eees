Title: FFT-Accelerated Auxiliary Variable MCMC for Fermionic Lattice Models: A Determinant-Free Approach with $O(N\log N)$ Complexity
Authors: Deqian Kong, Shi Feng, Jianwen Xie, Ying Nian Wu
Abstract: We introduce a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that dramatically accelerates the simulation of quantum many-body systems, a grand challenge in computational science. State-of-the-art methods for these problems are severely limited by $O(N^3)$ computational complexity. Our method avoids this bottleneck, achieving near-linear $O(N \log N)$ scaling per sweep. Our approach samples a joint probability measure over two coupled variable sets: (1) particle trajectories of the fundamental fermions, and (2) auxiliary variables that decouple fermion interactions. The key innovation is a novel transition kernel for particle trajectories formulated in the Fourier domain, revealing the transition probability as a convolution that enables massive acceleration via the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The auxiliary variables admit closed-form, factorized conditional distributions, enabling efficient exact Gibbs sampling update. We validate our algorithm on benchmark quantum physics problems, accurately reproducing known theoretical results and matching traditional $O(N^3)$ algorithms on $32\times 32$ lattice simulations at a fraction of the wall-clock time, empirically demonstrating $N \log N$ scaling. By reformulating a long-standing physics simulation problem in machine learning language, our work provides a powerful tool for large-scale probabilistic inference and opens avenues for physics-inspired generative models.

Title: Spontaneous Breaking of the SU(3) Flavor Symmetry in a Quantum Hall Valley Nematic
Authors: G. Krizman, A. Kazakov, C.-W. Cho, V. V. Volobuev, A. Majou, E. Ben Achour, T. Wojtowicz, G. Bauer, Y. Guldner, B. A. Piot, Th. Jolicoeur, G. Springholz, L.-A. de Vaulchier
Abstract: Two-dimensional quantum materials can host original electronic phases that arise from the interplay of electronic correlations, symmetry and topology. In particular, the spontaneous breaking of internal symmetry that acts simultaneously on the pseudospin and the spatial degree of freedom realizes a nematic ordering. We report evidence of a quantum Hall valley nematic phase with an underlying SU(3) order parameter space obtained by a spontaneous polarization between the threefold degenerate valley pseudospins in Pb1-xSnxSe quantum wells. In the presence of a Zeeman field, we demonstrate a further control of the nematic ordering with an explicit symmetry breaking. Evidence of both spontaneous and explicit SU(3) symmetry breaking, reminiscent of the quark flavor paradigm, is of fundamental interest to shape the many body physics in a SU(3) system.

Title: Yamaji effect in models of underdoped cuprates
Authors: Jing-Yu Zhao, Shubhayu Chatterjee, Subir Sachdev, Ya-Hui Zhang
Abstract: Recent angle-dependent magnetoresistance measurements in underdoped cuprates have revealed compelling evidence for small hole pockets in the pseudogap regime, including observation of the Yamaji effect in HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+\delta}$ (Chan et al., Nature Physics https://doi.org/10.1038/s41567-025-03032-2 (2025)). A key distinction between theories is their predicted Fermi volumes, measured as fractions of the square lattice Brillouin zone: $p/4$ per pocket for spin density wave (SDW) versus $p/8$ for fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*), where $p$ is the hole doping. We calculate the $c$-axis magnetoresistance $\rho_{zz}(\theta, \phi)$ within the semiclassical Boltzmann formalism for both states, and using the ancilla layer model (ALM) for FL* in a single-band Hamiltonian. While the SDW Yamaji azimuthal angle $\theta$ is marginally smaller than the FL* Yamaji $\theta$, the most significant difference is the presence of a second Yamaji peak in the SDW theory near in-plane angle $\phi = 45^\circ$; there is no such second peak in the observations in HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+\delta}$. Furthermore, we examine the role of anisotropic interlayer hopping present in LSCO, and predict the potential emergence of the Yamaji effect in LSCO at higher magnetic fields. Our results support the FL* interpretation of Fermi arcs in the pseudogap phase, and establish Yamaji angle measurements as a discriminatory tool between theoretical models.

Title: Unconventional criticality in $O(D)$-invariant loop-constrained Landau theory
Authors: Svitlana Kondovych, Asle Sudbø, Flavio S. Nogueira
Abstract: We study the critical behavior of a Landau-type theory for ferroelectrics in which the polarization order parameter $\vec{P}$ is subject to a divergence-free constraint, such that only loop-like polarization configurations contribute to the partition function. This constraint forces the number of components of the field $\vec{P}$ to equal the spatial dimensionality $D$, allowing a natural extension of the present theory to $O(N)$ models with $N=D$. Renormalization group analysis reveals critical behavior beyond the conventional Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm. In particular, the order parameter acquires a remarkably large anomalous dimension, with $\eta\approx 0.239$ in three dimensions -- significantly exceeding the value $\eta\approx 0.034$ typical of the $O(3)$ universality class. This is due to an emergent gauge symmetry originating with the local constraint.

Title: CBVB-nH complexes as prevalent defects in metal-organic vapor-phase epitaxy-grown hexagonal boron nitride
Authors: Marek Maciaszek, Bartłomiej Baur
Abstract: Optically active defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are promising candidates for active components in emerging quantum technologies, such as single-photon emitters and spin centers. However, further progress in hBN-based quantum technologies requires a deeper understanding of the physics and chemistry of hBN defects. In this work, we employ ab initio calculations to investigate the thermodynamic stability and optical properties of defect complexes involving carbon, boron vacancies, and hydrogen. We demonstrate that the formation of CBVB-nH complexes (n from 0 to 3) is energetically favorable under nitrogen-rich conditions in the presence of carbon and hydrogen. The low formation energies and high binding energies of these complexes arise from the strong electrostatic attraction between the positively charged carbon substitutional defect (CB) and the negatively charged hydrogen-passivated boron vacancies (VB-nH). These complexes are particularly likely to form in metal-organic vapor-phase epitaxy (MOVPE)-grown samples, where growth occurs in the presence of carbon and hydrogen and is accompanied by a high density of boron vacancies. The optical properties of CBVB-nH complexes are analyzed and compared to recent photoluminescence measurements on MOVPE-grown hBN samples. In particular, we investigate the origin of the emission peaks at 1.90 eV and 2.24 eV and demonstrate that both the energies and lineshapes are consistent with hole capture by negatively charged CBVB and CBVB-H complexes.

Title: Comparative study of phonon-limited carrier transport in the Weyl semimetal TaAs family
Authors: Shashi B. Mishra, Zhe Liu, Sabyasachi Tiwari, Feliciano Giustino, Elena R. Margine
Abstract: We present a systematic first-principles study of phonon-limited transport in the TaAs family of Weyl semimetals using the ab initio Boltzmann transport equation. The calculated electrical conductivities show excellent agreement with experimental data for high-quality samples, confirming that transport in these systems is predominantly limited by phonon scattering. Among the four compounds, NbP achieves the highest conductivity, governed primarily by its large Fermi velocities that offset its stronger scattering rates. In contrast, TaAs displays the lowest conductivity, linked to reduced carrier pockets and limited carrier velocities. Additionally, NbP conductivity remains largely unaffected by small hole or electron doping, whereas TaAs exhibits pronounced electron-hole asymmetry. NbAs and TaP show intermediate behavior, reflecting their Fermi surface topologies and scattering phase space. These findings provide microscopic insight into the transport mechanisms of the TaAs family and emphasize the critical role of phonons, doping, and carrier dynamics in shaping their electronic response.

Title: Towards a unified mechanistic understanding of the electrical response of bipolar nanofluidic systems
Authors: Ayelet Ben-Kish Sharvit, Yoav Green
Abstract: Bipolar nanoporous membranes and bipolar nanochannels are used in water desalination and energy-harvesting systems that provide clean water and green energy, respectively. The growing need for both requires continuous improvement of their performance. However, the underlying physics of these complex systems is still not fully understood, making empirical optimization slow and inefficient. In this work, we combine theoretical analysis and numerical simulations to develop a unified framework for improving the design of nanofluidic devices. We show that the system response is governed by the interplay between the applied voltage and a parameter $\eta$, which depends on the ratio of geometry and surface charge densities of both charged regions. At low voltages, the response is mostly determined by $\eta$, allowing its dependence to be represented by a simplified phase space. At high voltages, this phase space becomes oversimplified. To demonstrate the framework's robustness, we scan a range of configurations, from unipolar channels (single charged region) to bipolar channels (positive and negative segments). We compare the numerically simulated current-voltage responses with three theoretical models, which are limiting scenarios within the phase space, and explain the observed deviations. These findings can help reduce the time and resources required to optimize nanofluidic devices and improve the interpretation of experiments and simulations.

Title: Low-Power Temperature Control by Chiral Ferroelectric Nematic Liquid Crystal Windows
Authors: Md Sakhawat Hossain Himel, Rohan Dharmarathna, Netra Prasad Dhakal, Kelum Perera, Samuel Sprunt, James T. Gleeson, Robert J. Twieg, Antal Jákli
Abstract: Low power consumption is critical for smart windows for temperature control and privacy. The recently discovered ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals exhibit strong coupling of the ferroelectric polarization with electric fields, making them promising candidates for energy-efficient electrochromic devices. Here we investigate the electrochromic properties of a room temperature chiral ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal in films with in-plane electrodes, where the electric field is perpendicular to the helical axis. We demonstrate that smart windows based on this material can regulate interior temperatures within a 10 Celsius range using only 50 milliwatt per square meter specific power, achieving fifty percent larger temperature modulation and 50-100 times lower power consumption than polymer dispersed and polymer stabilized liquid crystal windows. These findings suggest that chiral ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals offer a highly efficient approach for smart window applications, potentially surpassing existing electrochromic technologies in energy efficiency and thermal regulation.

Title: Comment on "Dissipation bounds the coherence of stochastic limit cycles"
Authors: Artemy Kolchinsky
Abstract: Recent work has identified a fundamental bound on the thermodynamic cost of stochastic oscillators in the weak-noise regime (Santolin and Falasco, 2025; Nagayama and Ito, 2025). In this brief note, we provide an alternative and elementary derivation of this bound, based only on the assumption of Gaussian phase fluctuations and the thermodynamic uncertainty relation. Our approach may be useful for future generalizations of the bound.

Title: Turn-on of Current-Induced Spin Torque upon Noncollinear Antiferromagnetic Ordering in Delafossite PdCrO2
Authors: Xiaoxi Huang, Qi Song, Gautam Gurung, Daniel A. Pharis, Thow Min Jerald Cham, Yulan Chen, Rakshit Jain, Maciej Olszewski, Yufan Feng, Amal El-Ghazaly, Evgeny Y. Tsymbal, Darrell G. Schlom, Daniel C. Ralph
Abstract: We report measurements of the current-induced spin torque produced by the delafossite antiferromagnet PdCrO2 and acting on an adjacent ferromagnetic permalloy layer. The spin torque increases strongly as the temperature is reduced through the Neel temperature, when the PdCrO2 transitions from a paramagnetic phase to a noncollinear antiferromagnetic state. This result is qualitatively consistent with density functional theory calculations regarding how spin-current generation changes upon antiferromagnetic ordering in PdCrO2.

Title: DC Current Generation in the Driven Damped Haldane Model
Authors: Konrad Koenigsmann, Peter Schauss, Gia-Wei Chern
Abstract: The interplay between topological phenomena and nonequilibrium dynamics in open quantum systems represents a rapidly developing frontier in condensed matter physics. In this work, we investigate the nonequilibrium steady states of the Haldane model driven by a continuous-wave laser and coupled to a thermal reservoir. Dissipation is modeled within the Lindblad formalism adapted for quadratic fermionic systems, enabling us to study both the relaxation dynamics and the emergence of quasi-steady states. While conventional topological invariants and the bulk-boundary correspondence do not directly apply to such nonequilibrium settings, we introduce an occupation-weighted Chern number that captures the residual topological character of this quasi-steady state. We additionally examine the charge transport of this system under simultaneous driving and damping, showing that inversion symmetry breaking via a staggered sublattice potential generates a finite DC current. The magnitude and direction of this DC current are sensitive to the driving strength, highlighting the intricate interplay between topology, symmetry, and dissipation in open quantum systems.

Title: A large spin-splitting altermagnet designed from the hydroxylated MBene monolayer
Authors: Xinyu Yang, Shan-Shan Wang, Shuai Dong
Abstract: The development of altermagnets is fundamentally important for advancing spintronic device technology, but remains unpractical for the weak spin splitting in most cases, especially in two-dimensional materials. Based on spin group symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, a novel hydroxyl rotation strategy in collinear antiferromagnets has been proposed to design altermagnets. This approach achieves a large chirality-reversible spin splitting exceeding $1130$ meV in $\alpha_{60}$-Mn$_2$B$_2$(OH)$_2$ monolayer. The system also exhibits intrinsic features of a node-line semimetal in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. Besides, the angles of hydroxyl groups serve as the primary order parameter, which can switch on/off the altermagnetism coupled with the ferroelastic mechanism. The corresponding magnetocrystalline anisotropy have also been modulated. Moreover, an interesting spin-related transport property with the spin-polarized conductivity of 10$^{19}$ $\Omega^{-1}m^{-1}s^{-1}$ also emerges. These findings uncover the hydroxyl rotation strategy as a versatile tool for designing altermagnetic node-line semimetals and opening new avenues for achieving exotic chemical and physical characteristics associated with large spin splitting.

Title: Mapping Temperature Using Transmission Kikuchi Diffraction
Authors: Yueyun Chen, Xin Yi Ling, Jared Lodico, Tristan P. O`Neill, B. C. Regan, Matthew Mecklenburg
Abstract: Electronic devices are engineered at increasingly smaller length scales; new metrologies to understand nanoscale thermodynamics are needed. Temperature and pressure are fundamental thermodynamic quantities whose nanoscale measurement is challenging as physical contact inevitably perturbs the system. Here we demonstrate Kikuchi diffraction thermometry (KDTh), a non-contact scanning electron microscope (SEM) technique capable of mapping nanoscale temperatures and pressures. KDTh detects local volumetric lattice changes in crystalline samples by precisely fitting Kikuchi patterns. Temperature changes are deduced using the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE). We map lattice parameters and temperatures on Joule-heated graphite by rastering a 5.5-nm electron probe across the sample. Our parameter precision is ~0.01% and our temperature sensitivity is 2.2 K/$\sqrt{Hz}$. KDTh offers advanced sensitivity by fitting the entire Kikuchi pattern, even beyond the precision measured in transmission electron microscopy. KDTh can operate in both transmission (transmission Kikuchi diffraction, TKD) and reflection (electron backscatter diffraction, EBSD) modes.

Title: Phenomenological Ehrenfest Dynamics with Topological and Geometric Phase Effects and the curious case of Elliptical intersection
Authors: Dhruv Sharma
Abstract: We present a comprehensive computational framework for simulating nonadiabatic molecular dynamics with explicit inclusion of geometric phase (GP) effects. Our approach is based on a generalized two-level Hamiltonian model that can represent various electronic state crossings - conical intersections, avoided crossings, and elliptic intersections - through appropriate parameterization. We introduce a novel prelooping trajectory initialization scheme, allowing us to encode the memory as an initial phase accumulated due to the adiabatic evolution over the potential energy surface. This is a unified framework to handle different types of level crossings by incorporating Berry curvature-based force corrections to Ehrenfest dynamics, ensuring accurate representation of topological effects. For conical intersections, our method incorporates the theoretically expected phase pi, while for elliptic intersections, it yields a parametrically tunable but loop radius (energy) independent phase different from pi. We also include an eccentricity parameter (e) in the diabatic coupling to model more realistic molecular systems. Numerical simulations demonstrate the consistency of our approach with theoretical predictions for mixing of states and inhibition from mixing due to geometric phase effects. This framework provides a valuable tool for studying quantum-classical interactions in molecular systems where geometric phase effects play a significant role. The elliptical intersection and geometric phase effect opens avenue for the design and discovery of degenerate materials. It produces a fresh look to help develop a new kind of spectroscopy and potential qubit applications. This simple Hamiltonian reveals a pathological phase protection effect E = kr, where k is real, that has great utility in a new spectroscopy design.

Title: Experimental Demonstration of a Superconductor SFQ-Based ADC for High-Frequency Signal Acquisition
Authors: Beyza Zeynep Ucpinar, Sasan Razmkhah, Mustafa Altay Karamuftuoglu, Ali Bozbey
Abstract: Superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) are among the most sensitive sensors, offering high precision through their well-defined flux-voltage characteristics. Building on this sensitivity, we designed, fabricated, and experimentally demonstrated a superconducting single flux quantum (SFQ)-based analog-to-digital converter (ADC) capable of detecting small variations in input current signals at high frequencies and converting them into SFQ pulse trains. To improve robustness and reduce errors, the design incorporates a majority circuit and two types of counters: asynchronous toggle flip-flop-based and synchronous cumulative-based, at the cryogenic stage. The counter collects the SFQ pulse train and converts it into a binary number, simplifying downstream digital readout. The circuits were implemented using the AIST CRAVITY (QuFab) HSTP process and successfully tested in our cryocooler system, validating both the design methodology and operation. This approach helps build a fully integrated system that combines digital SQUID functionality with cryogenic readout circuits on a single chip.

Title: Ferroelasticity tunable altermagnets
Authors: Ning Ding, Haoshen Ye, Shan-Shan Wang, Shuai Dong
Abstract: Altermagnets have garnered great interest due to their non-relativistic spin splitting and novel physical properties. However, the control of altermagnetic states remains underexplored. Here, we propose a new multiferroic state, i.e. ferroelastic altermagnetic state, in which ferroelastic strain couples directly to the spin-splitting. Through symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we identify the ferroelastic $d$-wave altermagnetism of puckered pentagonal CoSe$_2$ monolayer. Interestingly, uniaxial stress can induce a ferroelastic phase transition, accompanied by a $90^\circ$ rotation of the spin-splitting bands. Cooperative rotation of the lattice and Néel vectors preserves the sign of Kerr angle, whereas noncooperative rotation reverses it. Our work provides a general strategy for manipulating altermagnetism in multiferroic systems and opens new avenues for exploring emergent magnetoelastic phenomena.

Title: Comparison of Electroluminescence and Photoluminescence Imaging of Mixed-Cation Mixed-Halide Perovskite Solar Cells at Low Temperatures
Authors: Hurriyet Yuce-Cakir, Haoran Chen, Isaac Ogunniranye, Susanna M. Thon, Yanfa Yan, Zhaoning Song, Behrang H. Hamadani
Abstract: Halide perovskites have emerged as promising candidates for high-performance solar cells. This study investigates the temperature-dependent optoelectronic properties of mixed-cation mixed-halide perovskite solar cells using electroluminescence (EL) and photoluminescence (PL) hyperspectral imaging, along with current-voltage analysis. Luminescence images, which were converted to EL and PL external radiative efficiency (ERE) maps, revealed significant changes in the optoelectronic behavior of these devices at low temperatures. Specifically, we found that a significant source of heterogeneity in the low-temperature EL ERE maps below 240 K is related to local charge injection and extraction bottlenecks, whereas PL ERE maps show suppressed non-radiative recombination and significant improvements in efficiency throughout the investigated temperature range. The spatial distribution of ERE and its variation with applied current were analyzed, offering insights into charge-carrier dynamics and defect behavior. Our results reveal that while the perovskite layer exhibits enhanced ERE at low temperatures, charge injection barriers at the interfaces of the perovskite solar cells significantly suppress EL and degrade the fill factor below 240 K. These findings reveal that a deeper understanding of the performance of perovskite solar cells under low-temperature conditions is an essential step toward their potential application in space power systems and advanced semiconductor devices.

Title: Magnetic Flux-induced Higher-order Topological Superconductors
Authors: Jinpeng Xiao, Qianglin Hu, Zuodong Yu, Weipeng Chen, Xiaobing Luo
Abstract: Higher-order topological superconductivity typically depends on spin-orbit interaction, and often necessitates well designed sample structures, nodal superconducting pairings or complex magnetic order. In this work, we propose a model that incorporates a Zeeman field, antiferromagnetic order, and $s$-wave superconducting pairing, all without the need for spin-orbit interaction. In a two-dimensional system, we realize a second-order topological superconductor by utilizing a staggered flux, provided that the Zeeman field is oriented perpendicular to the magnetic order moments. In three-dimensional systems, we achieve second- and third-order topological superconductors in theory, through stacking the two-dimensional second-order topological superconductor.

Title: Impurity-induced spin density wave in the thermoelectric layered cobaltite [Ca$_2$CoO$_3$]$_{0.62}$[CoO$_2$]
Authors: Motoya Takenaka, Shogo Yoshida, Yoshiki J. Sato, Ryuji Okazaki
Abstract: We investigate the Sn-substitution effect on the thermoelectric transport properties of the layered cobaltite [Ca$_2$CoO$_3$]$_{0.62}$[CoO$_2$] single crystals, which exhibit a non-monotonic temperature variation of the electrical resistivity and the Seebeck coefficient owing to the complex electronic and magnetic states. We find that the onset temperature of the short-range spin-density-wave (SDW) formation increases with the substituted Sn content, indicating the impurity-induced stabilization of the SDW order, reminiscent of the disorder/impurity-induced spin order in the cuprate superconductors. The Seebeck coefficient is well related to such impurity effects, as it is slightly enhanced below the onset temperatures, implying a decrease in the carrier concentration due to a pseudo-gap formation associated with the SDW ordering. We discuss the site-dependent substitution effects including earlier studies, and suggest that substitution to the conducting CoO$_2$ layers is essential to increase the onset temperature, consistent with the impurity-induced SDW picture realized in the conducting layers with the cylindrical Fermi surface.

Title: Magnetization, excitations, and microwave power absorption in transition-metal/rare-earth ferrites with disorder
Authors: D. A. Garanin, E. M. Chudnovsky
Abstract: Efficient numerical routines are developed for numerical studies of the dependence of the equilibrium magnetic states, excitations, and microwave power absorption on temperature and composition in transition-metal/rare-earth ferrites, including the reversal of the Néel vector occurring on both temperature and the concentration of the rare-earth atoms. It results in a drastic change in the behavior at the magnetization and angular-momentum compensation points. Dominant uniform oscillation modes are obtained by computing the magnetization correlation function. They are compared with the analytical solution, which is analyzed in detail. The fluctuation-dissipation theorem is used to compute the frequency dependence of the absorbed microwave power. A good agreement with analytical results is demonstrated. Disorder caused by random positions of rare-earth atoms in a diluted RE system leads to multiple localized modes that converge into broad absorption maxima as the size of the system increases. The power absorption integrated over frequency exhibits a minimum at the compensation point.

Title: Superconductivity in UTe$_2$ from local noncentrosymmetricity
Authors: Ryuji Hakuno, Youichi Yanase
Abstract: Superconductivity in UTe$_{2}$ has garnered significant attention, as it is widely recognized as a promising candidate for a spin-triplet superconductor. However, the symmetry of superconductivity and the microscopic origin of spin-triplet pairing remain subjects of debate. Nevertheless, various experiments imply an intimate coupling between magnetism and superconductivity. In this paper, we analyze a multi-sublattice periodic Anderson model that incorporates a spin-orbit coupling allowed in locally noncentrosymmetric crystals to discuss magnetic fluctuations and superconductivity in UTe$_2$. Due to the sublattice-dependent spin-orbit coupling, magnetic fluctuations become anisotropic, and the spin degeneracy of superconducting states is lifted. Our calculations reveal anisotropic antiferromagnetic fluctuations along the $b$- and $c$-axes, anisotropic ferromagnetic fluctuations along the $a$-axis, and their coexistence. These can be tuned by the $f$-electron's level. Superconductivity in the $A_u$ representation is predominant for a wide range of parameters, whereas the $B_{2u}$ representation is almost degenerate and can be stabilized. The direction of the $d$-vector changes as we increase the spin-orbit coupling. We discuss the consistency between our results and several experiments.

Title: Multi-orbital Dirac superconductors and their realization of higher-order topology
Authors: Dao-He Ma, Jin An
Abstract: Topological nodal superconductors (SCs) have attracted considerable interest due to their gapless bulk excitations and exotic surface states. In this paper, by establishing a general framework of the effective theory for multi-orbital SCs, we realize a class of three-dimensional (3D) time-reversal (T )-invariant Dirac SCs, with their topologically protected gapless Dirac nodes being located at general positions in the Brillouin zone. By introducing T -breaking pairing perturbations, we demonstrate the existence of Majorana hinge modes in these Dirac SCs as evidence of their realization of higher-order topology. We also propose a new kind of T -breaking Dirac SCs, whose Dirac nodes possess nonzero even chiralities and so are characterized by surface Majorana arcs.

Title: Effect of decorating NiO nanoparticles on superconducting properties of YBCO
Authors: D.M. Gokhfeld, S.V. Semenov, M.I. Petrov, I.V. Nemtsev, M.S. Molokeev, V.L. Kirillov, O.N. Martyanov
Abstract: The influence of adding 23 nm NiO nanoparticles on the magnetic hysteresis loops and critical current density of the high-temperature superconductor YBa2Cu3O7-d has been investigated. The samples were prepared using a fast annealing method that prevents chemical interaction between the components and does not reduce the critical temperature of the superconductor. Compared to the undoped YBCO sample, the critical current density increases in the samples doped with NiO nanoparticles in magnetic fields greater than 6 kOe. The sample containing 0.5 weight percent of NiO nanoparticles exhibits the greatest enhancement in critical current density at 10 kOe (1.36 times greater than the undoped sample).

Title: Vertical pullout of a non-spherical intruder from a granular medium: From system-wide response to avalanching around the intruder
Authors: Dominik Krengel, Jian Chen, Shun Nomura, Shunsuke Ota, Hidenori Takahashi
Abstract: Intruder mechanics in a granular aggregate is a common subject in engineering and geotechnical applications. However, most studies are limited to spherical intruders or small displacement regimes up to the point of failure. In this work we investigate the vertical pullout of a plate-like intruder buried within a granular aggregate well past the point of failure. While we find the maximum resistance force to depend on the material properties, in the post failure regime the resistance force converges onto the same curve for all friction coefficients. Likewise, the effective geometry of the intruder will always develop the same conical shape on top of the plate, independent of the magnitude of friction, that remains unchanged during the pullout process once established. Further, between the intruder and the aggregate a natural hopper flow develops in which material is transported into the void below the intruder by discrete flow events.

Title: Frustration-driven unconventional magnetism in the Mn$^{2+}$ ($S=\frac{5}{2}$) based two-dimensional triangular-lattice antiferromagnet Ba$_{3}$MnTa$_{2}$O$_{9}$
Authors: Romario Mondal, Sk. Soyeb Ali, Saikat Nandi, S. Chattopadhyay, S. Gaß, L. T. Corredor, A. U. B. Wolter, V. Kataev, B. Büchner, A. Alfonsov, S. Wurmehl, A. V. Mahajan, S. K. Panda, T. Dey
Abstract: A triple perovskite oxide Ba$_{3}$MnTa$_{2}$O$_{9}$ has been synthesized and its magnetic properties have been investigated through dc and ac magnetization, specific heat, electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Mn$^{2+}$ ($S$ = 5/2) ions are the only magnetic species present in the material. These Mn$^{2+}$ ions constitute a quasi-two-dimensional triangular network in the crystallographic $ab$-plane. Magnetization and specific heat measurements reveal the absence of any long-range magnetic order down to 0.5\,K despite the presence of antiferromagnetic correlations between the magnetic ions, suggesting the presence of geometric frustration in the material. The entropy release is lower than the expected theoretical value of $Rln(6)$, further suggesting the presence of frustration. First-principles calculations using density functional theory (DFT) and atomistic spin dynamics (ASD) simulations further support this lack of static magnetic order even at low temperatures and identify the competing magnetic interactions along with the quasi-2D magnetic dimensionality as the underlying origin of such an unconventional magnetic behavior.

Title: Laser-Induced Heating in Diamonds: Influence of Substrate Thermal Conductivity and Interfacial Polymer Layers
Authors: Md Shakhawath Hossain, Jiatong Xu, Thi Ngoc Anh Mai, Nhat Minh Nguyen, Trung Vuong Doan, Chaohao Chen, Qian Peter Su, Yongliang Chen, Evgeny Ekimov, Toan Dinh, Xiaoxue Xu, Toan Trong Tran
Abstract: Diamonds hosting color centers possess intrinsically high thermal conductivity; therefore, laser-induced heating has often received little attention. However, when placed on substrates with low thermal conductivity, localized heating of diamonds under laser excitation can become significant, and the presence of an interfacial polymer layer between substrate and diamond further amplifies this effect. Yet, the relationship between substrate thermal conductivity, polymer thickness, and laser heating remains to be established. Here, a systematic investigation is presented on laser-induced heating of silicon-vacancy diamond on substrates with varying thermal conductivity and interfacial polymer thickness. Results reveal that even at a low excitation power of 737~$\mu$W/$\mu$m$^2$, thin amorphous holey carbon -- the lowest-conductivity substrate ($\sim$0.2~W~m$^{-1}$~K$^{-1}$) studied -- exhibits substantial heating, while glass ($\sim$1.4~W~m$^{-1}$~K$^{-1}$) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS, $\sim$0.35~W~m$^{-1}$~K$^{-1}$) show noticeable heating only above 2.95~mW/$\mu$m$^2$. For polymer interlayers, a thickness of just 2.2~$\mu$m induces significant heating at 2.95~mW/$\mu$m$^2$ and above, highlighting strong influence of both substrate and polymer thickness on local heating response. Experimental findings are further validated using COMSOL Multiphysics simulations with a steady-state 3D heat transfer model. These results provide practical guidance for substrate selection and sample preparation, enabling optimization of conditions for optical thermometry and quantum sensing applications.

Title: Multiscale Models For Perovskite Optimisation
Authors: Philippe Baranek, James P. Connolly (GeePs), Antoine Gissler, Philip Schulz, Michel Rérat, Roberto Dovesi
Abstract: This paper presents a multiscale approach to evaluate perovskite solar cell performance which determines material properties at the atomistic scale with first-principles calculations, and applies them in macro-scale device models. This work focuses on the MAPbI3 (MA = CH3NH3) perovskite and how its phase transitions impact on its optical, electronic, and structural properties which are investigated at the first-principles level. The obtained data are coupled to a numerical drift-diffusion device model enabling evaluation of the performance of corresponding single junction devices. The first-principles simulation applies a hybrid exchange-correlation functional adapted to the studied family of compounds. Validation by available experimental data is presented from materials properties to device performance, justifying the use of the approach for predictive evaluation of existing and novel perovskites. The coupling between atomistic and device models is described in terms of a framework for exchange of optical, vibrational, and electronic parameters between the two scales. The result of this theoretical investigation is a methodology for designing and optimising perovskite materials for both cell performance and stability, the key obstacle in the societal implementation of these record-breaking new materials.

Title: Electric field-induced spin-valley locking in twisted bilayer buckled honeycomb materials
Authors: Harold J.W. Zandvliet, Pantelis Bampoulis, Cristiane Morais Smith, Lumen Eek
Abstract: A twisted honeycomb bilayer exhibits a moiré superstructure that is composed of a hexagonal arrangement of AB and BA stacked domains separated by domain boundaries. In the case of twisted bilayer graphene, the application of an electric field normal to the bilayer leads to the opening of inverted band gaps in the AB and BA stacked domains. The inverted band gaps result in the formation of a two-dimensional triangular network of counterpropagating valley protected helical domain boundary states, also referred to as the quantum valley Hall effect. Owing to spin-orbit coupling and buckling, the quantum valley Hall effect in twisted bilayer silicene and germanene is more complex than in twisted bilayer graphene. We found that there is a range of electric fields for which the spin degree of freedom is locked to the valley degree of freedom of the electrons in the quantum valley Hall states, resulting in a stronger topological protection. For electric fields smaller than the aforementioned range the twisted bilayer does not exhibit the quantum valley Hall effect, whereas for larger electric fields the spin-valley locking is lifted and the emergent quantum valley Hall states are only valley-protected.

Title: First-Principles Approach to Spin Excitations in Noncollinear Magnetic Systems
Authors: Hsiao-Yi Chen, Ryotaro Arita, Yusuke Nomura
Abstract: We present a first-principles method based on density functional theory and many-body perturbation theory for computing spin excitations in magnetic systems with noncollinear spin textures. Traditionally, the study of magnetic excitations has relied on spin models that assume magnetic moments to be localized. Beyond this restriction, recent $ab~initio$ methods based on Green's functions within the local spin-density approximation have emerged as a general framework for calculating magnetic susceptibilities. However, their application has so far been largely limited to collinear ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic systems. In this work, we extend this framework and enable the treatment of large-scale noncollinear magnetic systems by leveraging a Wannier-basis representation and implementing an ansatz potential method to reduce computational cost. We apply our method to the spin-spiral state of LiCu$_2$O$_2$, successfully capturing its steady-state spin-rotation pitch in agreement with the experimental measurement and resolving the characteristic magnon dispersion. We further analyze the interplay between the spiral spin structure and the on-site spin-exchange splitting, and elucidate the crucial role of magnetic dipoles on ligand ions in mediating effective ferromagnetic interaction among the primary spins on Cu$^{2+}$ ions. Finally, we provide a theoretical prediction of the magnon dispersion on top of the helical spin background in high agreement with the experimental measurement. Overall, this work establishes a general and computationally efficient framework for simulating collective spin dynamics in noncollinear magnetic systems from first principles, exemplified by -- but not limited to -- spin-spiral states.

Title: The Tracy-Widom distribution at large Dyson index
Authors: Alain Comtet, Pierre Le Doussal, Naftali R. Smith
Abstract: We study the Tracy-Widom (TW) distribution $f_\beta(a)$ in the limit of large Dyson index $\beta \to +\infty$. This distribution describes the fluctuations of the rescaled largest eigenvalue $a_1$ of the Gaussian (alias Hermite) ensemble (G$\beta$E) of (infinitely) large random matrices. We show that, at large $\beta$, its probability density function takes the large deviation form $f_\beta(a) \sim e^{-\beta \Phi(a)}$. While the typical deviation of $a_1$ around its mean is Gaussian of variance $O(1/\beta)$, this large deviation form describes the probability of rare events with deviation $O(1)$, and governs the behavior of the higher cumulants. We obtain the rate function $\Phi(a)$ as a solution of a Painlevé II equation. We derive explicit formula for its large argument behavior, and for the lowest cumulants, up to order 4. We compute $\Phi(a)$ numerically for all $a$ and compare with exact numerical computations of the TW distribution at finite $\beta$. These results are obtained by applying saddle-point approximations to an associated problem of energy levels $E=-a$, for a random quantum Hamiltonian defined by the stochastic Airy operator (SAO). We employ two complementary approaches: (i) we use the optimal fluctuation method to find the most likely realization of the noise in the SAO, conditioned on its ground-state energy being $E$ (ii) we apply the weak-noise theory to the representation of the TW distribution in terms of a Ricatti diffusion process associated to the SAO. We extend our results to the full Airy point process $a_1>a_2>\dots$ which describes all edge eigenvalues of the G$\beta$E, and correspond to (minus) the higher energy levels of the SAO, obtaining large deviation forms for the marginal distribution of $a_i$, the joint distributions, and the gap distributions.

Title: Evidence of de Almeida--Thouless line below six dimensions
Authors: M. Aguilar-Janita, V. Martin-Mayor, J. Moreno-Gordo, J.J. Ruiz-Lorenzo
Abstract: We study the critical behavior of the Ising spin glass in five spatial dimensions through large-scale Monte Carlo simulations and finite-size scaling analysis. Numerical evidence for a phase transition is found both with and without an externally applied magnetic field. The critical exponents are computed in both cases. We compute with a 10\% accuracy the lower critical dimension at zero magnetic field, finding a result consistent with estimates obtained with entirely different methods, by combining our estimates of critical exponents in five dimensions with previous results for other spatial dimensions. When the results in a magnetic field are compared with previous results in six spatial dimensions, qualitative differences emerge in the scaling behavior of the correlation functions at zero external momentum. This anomalous scaling does not extend to other wavevectors. We do not find indications of a quasi first-order phase transition in a magnetic field.

Title: Linearly polarized light enables chiral edge transport in quasi-2D Dirac materials
Authors: Mohammad Shafiei, Farhad Fazileh, Milorad V. Milošević
Abstract: Floquet engineering with high-frequency light offers dynamic control over topological phases in quantum materials. While in 3D Dirac systems circularly polarized light is known to induce topological phase transitions via gap opening, linearly polarized light (LPL) has generally been considered ineffective. Here we show that in quasi-2D Dirac materials the second-order momentum term arising from the intersurface coupling can induce a topological phase transition under LPL, leading to chiral edge channels. Considering an ultrathin Bi$_2$Se$_3$ film as a representative system, we show that this transition occurs at experimentally accessible light intensities. Our results thus promote quasi-2D materials as viable platforms for light-controlled topological phases, expanding the potential of Floquet topological engineering.

Title: Quasiclassical theory of vortex states in locally non-centrosymmetric superconductors: application to CeRh$_{2}$As$_{2}$
Authors: Akihiro Minamide, Youichi Yanase
Abstract: CeRh$_{2}$As$_{2}$, a heavy fermion superconductor discovered in 2021, exhibits two distinct superconducting phases under a $c$-axis magnetic field. This unconventional phase diagram has been attributed to the local inversion symmetry breaking at the Ce sites. At low magnetic fields, a conventional even-parity spin-singlet superconducting state is realized, whereas at higher fields, an odd-parity spin-singlet superconducting state, in which the order parameter alternates sign between neighboring Ce layers, becomes stabilized. In this study, we employ a quasiclassical approach to investigate the vortex states of bilayer superconductors with locally broken inversion symmetry. We calculate the local density of states (LDOS) in the vortex lattice state and find that the pairing symmetry of different superconducting states is clearly manifested in the peak structure of LDOS at the vortex core. Since LDOS is experimentally observable, our work provides a pathway for experimental verification of the superconducting parity transition in CeRh$_{2}$As$_{2}$.

Title: Cryogenic temperature dependence and hysteresis of surface-trap-induced gate leakage in GaN high-electron-mobility transistors
Authors: Ching-Yang Pan, Shi-Kai Lin, Yu-An Chen, Pei-hsun Jiang
Abstract: This work provides a detailed mapping of various mechanisms of surface-trap-induced gate leakage in GaN HEMTs across a temperature range from room to cryogenic levels. Two-dimensional variable-range hopping is observed at small gate bias. Under higher reverse gate bias, the leakage is dominated by the Poole--Frenkel emission above 220 K, but gradually transitions to the trap-assisted tunneling below 220 K owing to the frozen-trap effect. The trap barrier height extracted from the gate leakage current under the upward gate sweep is 0.65 V, which is 12\% higher than that from the downward sweep. The gate leakage current as a function of the gate bias exhibits clockwise hysteresis loops above 220 K but counterclockwise ones below 220 K. This remarkable opposite hysteresis phenomenon is thoroughly explained by the trap mechanisms.

Title: Ferroelectric amplitude switching and continuous memory

Abstract: Although ferroelectric systems inherently exhibit binary switching behavior, recent advances in analog memory device have spurred growing interest in achieving continuous memory states. In this work, we demonstrate ferroelectric amplitude switching at the mesoscopic scale in compositionally graded Ba1-xSrxTiO3 heterostructures, enabling continuous modulation of polarization magnitude without altering its direction, which we defined as amplitude switching. Using switching current measurement, piezoresponse force microscopy and Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire simulations, we reveal that compositionally graded ferroelectric heterostructure can possess amplitude switching behavior through a double well potential with flattened minima. This behavior supports stable, continuous polarization states and establishes a new platform for analog memory applications. These findings introduce amplitude switching as a new dynamic of the order parameter, paving the way for energy-efficient and reliable analog memory systems.

Title: Emergent Shastry-Sutherland network from square-kagome Heisenberg antiferromagnet with trimerization
Authors: Tomonari Mizoguchi
Abstract: We study the $S=1/2$ square-kagome lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet with the trimarized modulation. In the trimerized limit, each trimer hosts the four-fold degenearte ground states characterized by the spin and chirality degrees of freedom. We find that, within the first-order perturbation theory with respect to the inter-trimer coupling, the effective Hamiltonian is the Kugel-Khomskii-type model on a Shastry-Sutherland lattice. Based on a mean-field decoupling, we propose a dimer-covering ansatz for the effective Hamiltonian; however, the validity of these states in the low-energy sector remains an open question.

Title: Enhanced Secondary Electron Detection of Single Ion Implants in Silicon Through Thin SiO2 Layers
Authors: Ella B Schneider, Oscar G Lloyd-Willard, Kristian Stockbridge, Mark Ludlow, Sam Eserin, David C Cox, Roger P Webb, Ben N Murdin, Steve K Clowes
Abstract: Deterministic placement of single dopants is essential for scalable quantum devices based on group-V donors in silicon. We demonstrate a non-destructive, high-efficiency method for detecting individual ion implantation events using secondary electrons (SEs) in a focused ion beam (FIB) system. Using low-energy Sb ions implanted into undoped silicon, we achieve up to 98% single-ion detection efficiency, verified by calibrated ion-current measurements before and after implantation. The technique attains ~30 nm spatial resolution without requiring electrical contacts or device fabrication, in contrast to ion-beam-induced-current (IBIC) methods. We find that introducing a controlled SiO2 capping layer significantly enhances SE yield, consistent with an increased electron mean free path in the oxide, while maintaining high probability of successful ion deposition in the underlying substrate. The yield appears to scale with ion velocity, so higher projectile mass (e.g. Yb, Bi etc) requires increased energy to maintain detection efficiency. Our approach provides a robust and scalable route to precise donor placement and extends deterministic implantation strategies to a broad range of material systems and quantum device architectures.

Title: $^{23}$Na-NMR study on the one-dimensional superoxide spin-chain compound NaO$_2$
Authors: Takayuki Goto, Mizuki Miyajima, Takashi Kambe
Abstract: We report $^{23}$Na-NMR study on a candidate one-dimensional quantum spin system NaO$_2$. The Knight shift, linewidth, and spin-lattice relaxation rate $1/T_1$ were investigated down to 0.3 K under fields up to 16 T. The results reveal the opening of a spin gap of $\Delta(10.1 {\rm T}) \simeq$ 38 K below $T_{\rm S3} =$ 40 K, consistent with a spin-Peierls-like instability. The hyperfine coupling constant was found to drop sharply across the structural phase transition at $T_{\rm S2} =$ 215 K, highlighting the pronounced one-dimensional character of the system. These findings establish NaO$_2$ as a rare example of a $\pi$-orbital-based one-dimensional spin chain that exhibits a spin-gapped ground state.

Title: Uniaxial Magnetic Anisotropy and Type-X/Y Current-Induced Magnetization Switching in Oblique-Angle-Deposited Ta/CoFeB/Pt and W/CoFeB/Pt Heterostructures
Authors: Amir Khan, Shalini Sharma, Tiago de Oliveira Schneider, Markus Meinert
Abstract: Planar current-induced magnetization switching (CIMS) driven by spin-orbit torque (SOT) requires an in-plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy (UMA), which can be induced by oblique-angle sputter deposition of the heavy-metal underlayer. To enhance the SOT efficiency, we employ trilayer heterostructures of (Ta or W)/CoFeB/Pt, where the bottom layer exhibits a UMA of 50 mT at 2 nm thickness. The magnetization reversal in Hall-bar devices is detected through unidirectional spin Hall magnetoresistance (USMR) for the Type Y geometry (easy axis transverse to current) and planar Hall measurements for the Type X geometry (easy axis parallel to current). Both configurations exhibit CIMS with sub-microsecond current pulses, reaching switching current densities as low as $2 \times 10^{11}$ A/m$^2$ for a W (4 nm)/CoFeB (1.4 nm)/Pt (2 nm) stack with a UMA of 146 mT. Macrospin simulations reproduce the Type Y switching as coherent magnetization rotation, whereas the Type X devices switch at much lower currents than predicted, indicating that nucleation and domain-wall propagation dominate reversal in this geometry.

Title: Contrasting properties of free carriers in $n$- and $p$-type Sb$_2$Se$_3$
Authors: F. Herklotz, E. V. Lavrov, T. D. C. Hobson, T. P. Shalvey, J. D. Major, K. Durose
Abstract: We report persistent photoconductivity in $p$-type Sb$_2$Se$_3$ single crystals doped with Cd or Zn, where enhanced conductivity remains for hours after illumination ceases at temperatures below $\sim$25~K. Comparative transport and infrared absorption measurements, including on $n$-type Cl-doped counterparts, reveal strong indications that hole transport in Sb$_2$Se$_3$ is more strongly affected by intrinsic carrier scattering than electron transport. These results point to a fundamental asymmetry in charge carrier dynamics and highlight the potential role of polaronic effects in limiting hole mobility in this quasi-one-dimensional semiconductor.

Title: Orbital magnetization in Sierpinski fractals
Authors: L. L. Lage, T. P. Cysne, A. Latgé
Abstract: Orbital magnetization (OM) in Sierpinski carpet (SC) and triangle (ST) fractal is theoretically investigated by using Haldane model as a prototypical example. The OM calculation is performed following two distinct approaches; employing the definition and local markers formalism. Both methods coincides for all systems analyzed. For the SC, higher fractal generations create a dense set of edge states, resulting in a staircase profile, leading to oscillations in the magnetization as a function of the chemical potential. In contrast, the ST self-similarity produces distinct fractal-induced spectral gaps, which manifest as constant plateaus in the magnetization. The STs exhibit a pronounced sensitivity to edge terminations. Our results reveal how quantum confinement in fractal structures affects the electronic orbital angular momentum, pointing to possible pathways for exploring novel orbitronics in systems with complex geometries.

Title: The fate of disorder in twisted bilayer graphene near the magic angle
Authors: Zhe Hou, Hailong Li, Qing Yan, Yu-Hang Li, Hua Jiang
Abstract: In disordered lattices, itinerant electrons typically undergo Anderson localization due to random phase interference, which suppresses their motion. By contrast, in flat-band systems where electrons are intrinsically localized owing to their vanishing group velocity, the role of disorder remains elusive. Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) at the magic angle $\sim 1.1^\circ$ provides a representative flat-band platform to investigate this problem. Here, we perform an atomistic tight-binding quantum transport calculation on the interplay between disorder and flat-bands in TBG devices. This non-phenomenological approach provides direct evidence that moderate disorder enhances conductance, whereas stronger disorder restores localization, revealing a disorder-driven delocalization-to-localization transport behavior. The underlying physical mechanism is understood by an effective inter-moir{é} tunneling strength via spectral flow analysis of a disordered TBG cylinder. Moreover, by comparing magic-angle and large-angle TBG, we demonstrate qualitatively distinct disorder responses tied to the presence of flat-bands. Our quantitative results highlight the unconventional role of disorder in flat-band moir{é} materials and offer insights into the observation of the fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect in disordered moir{é} systems.

Title: Precision of an autonomous demon exploiting nonthermal resources and information
Authors: Juliette Monsel, Matteo Acciai, Didrik Palmqvist, Nicolas Chiabrando, Rafael Sánchez, Janine Splettstoesser
Abstract: Quantum-dot systems serve as nanoscale heat engines exploiting thermal fluctuations to perform a useful task. Here, we investigate a multi-terminal triple-dot system, operating as a refrigerator that extracts heat from a cold electronic contact. In contrast to standard heat engines, this system exploits a nonthermal resource. This has the intriguing consequence that cooling can occur without extracting energy from the resource on average -- a seemingly demonic action -- while, however, requiring the resource to fluctuate. Using full counting statistics and stochastic trajectories, we analyze the performance of the device in terms of the cooling-power precision, employing performance quantifiers motivated by the thermodynamic and kinetic uncertainty relations. We focus on two regimes with large output power, which are based on two operational principles: exploiting information on one hand and the nonthermal properties of the resource on the other. We show that these regimes significantly differ in precision. In particular, the regime exploiting the nonthermal properties of the resource can have cooling-power fluctuations that are suppressed with respect to the input fluctuations by an order of magnitude. We also substantiate the interpretation of the two different working principles by analyzing cross-correlations between input and output heat currents and information flow.

Title: Substitutional sulfur and its vibrational fingerprints in Sb$_2$Se$_3$
Authors: F. Herklotz, E. V. Lavrov, A. Herklotz, V.V. Melnikov, T. P. Shalvey, J. D. Major, and K. Durose
Abstract: The configurational behavior of sulfur in antimony triselenide (Sb$_2$Se$_3$) is investigated by combining infrared absorption spectroscopy with density functional theory. Four sulfur-related local vibrational modes are identified at 249, 273, 283, and 312~cm$^{-1}$ in melt-grown single crystals prepared from Sb$_2$Se$_3$ granulate. Their assignment to sulfur is confirmed through controlled indiffusion experiments using Sb$_2$S$_3$ and elemental sulfur, as well as isotope-substitution studies with $^{34}$S, which produce the expected frequency shifts. Polarization-resolved measurements, together with theoretical calculations of local vibrational modes, demonstrate that the observed spectral features are fully consistent with substitutional sulfur on the three inequivalent selenium sites of Sb$_2$Se$_3$.

Title: Interplay of ferromagnetism, nematicity and Fermi surface nesting in kagome flat band
Authors: Yuman He, Wentao Jiang, Siqi Wu, Xuzhe Ying, Berthold Jack, Xi Dai, Hoi Chun Po
Abstract: Recent experiment on Fe-doped CoSn has uncovered a series of correlated phases upon hole doping of the kagome flat bands. Among the phases observed, a nematic phase with a six- to two-fold rotation symmetry breaking is found to prevail over a wide doping and temperature range. Motivated by these observations, we investigate the interaction-driven phases realized in a kagome model with partially filled, weakly dispersing flat bands. Density-density interactions up to second-nearest neighbors are considered. We identify a close competition between ferromagnetic and nematic phases in our self-consistent Hartree-Fock calculations: while on-site interaction favors ferromagnetism, the sizable inter-sublattice interactions stabilize nematicity over a wide doping window. Competition from translational-symmetry-breaking phases is also considered. Overall, our results show that nematicity is a generic outcome of partially filled kagome flat bands and establish a minimal framework for understanding correlated flat-band phases.

Title: Modeling Diffusion and Permeation Across the Stratum Corneum Lipid Barrier
Authors: Rinto Thomas, Praveen Ranganath Prabhakar, Douglas J. Tobias, Michael von Domaros
Abstract: Human skin oils are a major sink for ozone in densely occupied indoor environments. Understanding how the resulting volatile and semivolatile organic oxidation products influence indoor air chemistry requires accurate representations not only of their emission into indoor air but also of their transport across the outermost skin barrier, the stratum corneum. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the passive permeation of acetone, 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, and water -- two representative products of skin-oil oxidation and a reference compound -- through a model stratum corneum lipid membrane. We determine position-dependent diffusivities using two complementary analyses based on the same set of simulations and evaluate their accuracy through a propagator analysis. The two approaches provide upper and lower bounds for the true diffusivity, which, when combined with previously reported free-energy profiles, yield permeabilities relevant for modeling macroscopic skin transport. Our results show that permeation is governed primarily by energetic barriers rather than by molecular mobility, and that the predicted transport coefficients vary by about one order of magnitude depending on the chosen diffusivity estimator. These findings provide molecular-level constraints for parameters used in indoor air chemistry models and establish a transferable framework for linking atomistic transport mechanisms to large-scale simulations of human exposure and indoor air quality.

Title: Nonlinear Landau levels in the almost-bosonic anyon gas
Authors: Alireza Ataei, Ask Ellingsen, Filippa Getzner, Théotime Girardot, Douglas Lundholm, Dinh-Thi Nguyen
Abstract: We consider the quantitative description of a many-particle gas of interacting abelian anyons in the plane, confined in a trapping potential. If the anyons are modeled as bosons with a magnetic flux attachment, and if the total magnetic flux is small compared to the number of particles, then an average-field description becomes appropriate for the low-energy collective state of the gas. Namely, by means of a Hartree-Jastrow ansatz, we derive a two-parameter Chern-Simons-Schrödinger energy functional which extends the well-known Gross-Pitaevskii / nonlinear Schrödinger density functional theory to the magnetic (anyonic) self-interaction. One parameter determines the total number of self-generated magnetic flux units in the system, and the other the effective strength of spin-orbit self-interaction. This latter interaction can be either attractive/focusing or repulsive/defocusing, and depends both on the intrinsic spin-orbit interaction and the relative length scale of the flux profile of the anyons. Densities and energies of ground and excited states are studied analytically and numerically for a wide range of the parameters and align well with a sequence of exact nonlinear Landau levels describing Jackiw-Pi self-dual solitons. With increasing flux, counter-rotating vortices are formed, enhancing the stability of the gas against collapse. Apart from clarifying the relations between various different anyon models that have appeared in the literature, our analysis sheds considerable new light on the many-anyon spectral problem, and also exemplifies a novel supersymmetry-breaking phenomenon.

Title: Bosonic Laughlin and Moore-Read states from non-Chern flat bands
Authors: Hongyu Lu, Wang Yao
Abstract: The rapid advances in the study of fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) raise a fundamental question: while initially discovered in flat Chern bands motivated by their topological equivalence to Landau levels, is single- particle band topology actually a prerequisite for these many-body topological orders emergent at fractional fillings? Here, we numerically demonstrate bosonic FCIs in two types of non-Chern flat bands in honeycomb lattices, using exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group calculations. In a gapless flat band with a singular band touching, we observe a Laughlin state at half filling, stabilized by onsite interactions from the hard-core limit down to arbitrarily small strength. Furthermore, we report the first example of a non- Abelian FCI in a non-Chern band system: a Moore-Read state at $\nu$ = 1 filling of the same singular flat band with hard-core bosons. Under lattice parameters that realize a gapped trivial band (C = 0) of exact flatness, we also find the Laughlin FCI of soft-core bosons in the isolated band limit where onsite interaction is much smaller than the band gap. In this case, the FCI forms as interacting bosons spontaneously avoid the peaks in quantum metric and Berry curvature, preferentially occupying Brillouin zone region with relatively uniform quantum geometry. Our work significantly expands the landscape for (non-)Abelian FCIs and broadens the understanding of their formation beyond the Chern band paradigm.

Title: Magnetic D-brane solitons: skyrmion strings ending on a Néel wall in chiral magnets
Authors: Sven Bjarke Gudnason, Muneto Nitta
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions extended to three dimensions form string-like objects whose fundamental role remains largely unexplored. We show that skyrmion strings can terminate on a Néel-type domain wall (DW), realizing a magnetic analogue of a Dirichlet(D)-brane soliton. While an isolated Néel DW tends to rotate into a Bloch DW, the Néel DW is stabilized when a skyrmion string ends on it. Unlike field-theory D-branes, the Bloch-type DMI produces linear rather than logarithmic DW bending, and the strings retain finite width far from the DW, circumventing singular behavior. Furthermore, the repulsive interaction between strings allows periodic multi-junction solutions, yielding a square lattice of alternating strings and local DW deformations. These results establish magnetic skyrmion strings as fundamental strings that can end on a D-brane.

Title: Unique Hierarchical Rotational Dynamics Induces Ultralow Lattice Thermal Conductivity in Cyanide-bridged Framework Materials
Authors: Zhunyun Tang, Xiaoxia Wang, Jin Li, Chaoyu He, Mingxing Chen, Chao Tang, Tao Ouyang
Abstract: The pursuit of materials combining light constituent elements with ultralow lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{\mathrm{L}}$) is crucial to advancing technologies like thermoelectrics and thermal barrier coatings, yet it remains a formidable challenge to date. Herein, we achieve ultralow $\kappa_{\mathrm{L}}$ in lightweight cyanide-bridged framework materials (CFMs) through the rational integration of properties such as the hierarchical vibrations exhibited in superatomic structures and rotational dynamics exhibited in perovskites. Unique hierarchical rotation behavior leads to multiple negative peaks in Grüneisen parameters across a wide frequency range, thereby inducing pronounced negative thermal expansion and strong cubic anharmonicity in CFMs. Meanwhile, the synergistic effect between large four-phonon scattering phase space (induced by phonon quasi-flat bands and wide bandgaps) and strong quartic anharmonicity (associated with rotation modes) leads to giant quartic anharmonic scattering rates in these materials. Consequently, the $\kappa_{\mathrm{L}}$ of these CFMs decreases by one to two orders of magnitude compared to the known perovskites or perovskite-like materials with equivalent average atomic masses. For instance, the Cd(CN)$_{2}$, NaB(CN)$_{4}$, LiIn(CN)$_{4}$, and AgX(CN)$_{4}$ (X = B, Al, Ga, In) exhibit ultralow room-temperature $\kappa_{\mathrm{L}}$ values ranging from 0.35 to 0.81 W/mK. This work not only establishes CFMs as a novel and rich platform for studying extreme phonon anharmonicity, but also provides a new paradigm for achieving ultralow thermal conductivity in lightweight materials via the conscious integration of hierarchical and rotational dynamics.

Title: Quantum beats of exciton-polarons in CsPbI3 perovskite nanocrystals

Abstract: Exciton-phonon interactions govern the energy level spectrum and thus the optical response in semiconductors. In this respect, lead-halide perovskite nanocrystals represent a unique system, for which the interaction with optical phonons is particularly strong, giving rise to a ladder of multiple exciton states which can be optically excited with femtosecond pulses. We establish a new regime of coherent exciton-polaron dynamics with exceptionally long coherence times (T2 ~300 ps) in an ensemble of CsPbI3 nanocrystals embedded in a glass matrix. Using transient two-pulse photon echo at 2 K temperature, we observe quantum beats between the exciton-polaron states. Within a four-level model, we directly quantify the exciton-phonon coupling strength through the Huang-Rhys factors of 0.05-0.1 and 0.02-0.04 for low-energy optical phonons with energies of 3.2 and 5.1 meV, respectively. The pronounced size dependence of both coupling strengths and phonon lifetimes offers a path to tune the optical transitions between polaron states and to tailor the coherent optical dynamics in perovskite semiconductors for solid-state quantum technologies.

Title: Identification of formation of amorphous Si phase in SiOxNy films produced by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition
Authors: M. V. Voitovych, A. Sarikov, V. O. Yukhymchuk, V. V. Voitovych, M. O. Semenenko
Abstract: Peculiarities of formation of inclusions of amorphous Si (a-Si) phase in Si-rich Si oxynitride films grown by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) are studied by combined Raman scattering and infrared (IR) absorption spectroscopy. The Raman scattering results identify presence of a-Si phase in the studied films at the relative Si content exceeding a threshold value of about 0.4. The a-Si amount correlates with the concentration of hydrogen in the films, the presence of which is detected by characteristic IR absorption bands corresponding to Si-H bending (about 660 cm-1) and stretching (a composite band in the range of about 1900-2400 cm-1) vibrations. The method of deconvolution of IR absorbance spectra in the range of about 600 to 1300 cm-1 developed earlier is used to reliably separate the IR band at about 660 cm-1. This band is identified to origin from the amorphous Si phase within the studied Si oxynitride films. This makes it possible to propose IR spectroscopy with analysis of the low-wavenumber part of the spectra as an efficient method of identifying phase composition of Si-rich Si oxynitride films. The obtained results contribute to understanding of the regularities of formation of phase compositions of PECVD grown Si oxynitride films and are useful for controlling the films properties for practical applications.

Title: Fundamental quantum and relativistic formulation of thermal noise and linear conductance in an 1D quasi-particle ensemble under ballistic transport-regime
Authors: Lino Reggiani, Federico Intini, Luca Varani
Abstract: We investigate quantum and quantum-relativistic effects associated with the noise power spectrum and the fluctuation--dissipation relation between current--noise spectra and linear--response conductance at low frequencies of the electromagnetic field. At high frequencies, vacuum catastrophe is shown to be avoided by the presence of Casimir force. At low frequencies, the quantum effect associated with one--dimensional structures under the conditions of ballistic transport typical at the nanometric scale length are briefly reviewed in terms of a universal quasi-particle approach. The case of a photon gas inside an appropriate black-body cavity is found to provide a physical interpretation of the lines spectra of atomic elements within an exact statistical approach based on a physical interpretation of the fine structure constant, $\alpha =1/137.0560$.

Title: Crossed surface flat bands in three-dimensional superconducting altermagnets
Authors: Yuri Fukaya, Bo Lu, Keiji Yada, Yukio Tanaka, Jorge Cayao
Abstract: Superconducting altermagnets have proven to be a promising ground for emergent phenomena but their study has involved two dimensional systems. In this work, we investigate three-dimensional $d$- and $g$-wave altermagnets with chiral $d$-wave superconductivity and show the formation of crossed surface flat bands due to the underlying symmetries. We find that these crossed flat bands appear at zero energy in the surface along $z$ due to the superconducting nodal lines in the $xy$-plane, while the number of corners is determined by the crystal symmetry of altermagnets. We also show that the superconducting nodal lines give rise to Bogoliubov-Fermi surfaces, which then affect the appearance of zero-energy arcs in the surface along $x$. Moreover, we demonstrate that the crossed surface flat bands, surface arcs, and Bogoliubov-Fermi surfaces give rise to distinct signals in charge conductance, hence offering a solid way for their detection and paving the way for realizing higher dimensional topological phases using altermagnets.

Title: Non-reciprocal buckling makes active filaments polyfunctional
Authors: Sami C. Al-Izzi, Yao Du, Jonas Veenstra, Richard G. Morris, Anton Souslov, Andreas Carlson, Corentin Coulais, Jack Binysh
Abstract: Active filaments are a workhorse for propulsion and actuation across biology, soft robotics and mechanical metamaterials. However, artificial active rods suffer from limited robustness and adaptivity because they rely on external control, or are tethered to a substrate. Here we bypass these constraints by demonstrating that non-reciprocal interactions lead to large-scale unidirectional dynamics in free-standing slender structures. By coupling the bending modes of a buckled beam anti-symmetrically, we transform the multistable dynamics of elastic snap-through into persistent cycles of shape change. In contrast to the critical point underpinning beam buckling, this transition to self-snapping is mediated by a critical exceptional point, at which bending modes simultaneously become unstable and degenerate. Upon environmental perturbation, our active filaments exploit self-snapping for a range of functionality including crawling, digging and walking. Our work advances critical exceptional physics as a guiding principle for programming instabilities into functional active materials.

Abstract: In dilute gases, transport properties such as the thermal conductivity, self-diffusion, and viscosity are significantly affected by interatomic collisions, which are determined by the potential form. This study explores these transport properties in the presence of a Langevin thermostat in systems where particles interact through various potentials, including soft-core and hard-core potentials, both with and without an attractive region. Using molecular dynamics simulations and a theoretical approach based on an analogy with an electric circuit (Ohm's law), we derived and compared the transport coefficients across these interatomic potentials for different couplings with the thermostat. The transport coefficients were obtained by considering the thermostat as a resistance in a series circuit.

Title: Unifying Frictional Transients Reveals the Origin of Static Friction
Authors: Kasra Farain, Daniel Bonn
Abstract: Frictional motion is harder to initiate than to sustain, as evident when pushing a heavy object. This disparity between static and kinetic friction drives instabilities and stick-slip dynamics in systems ranging from nanodevices and MEMS to squealing brakes, glaciers and tectonic faults, yet its origin and the transition mechanism remain poorly understood. Empirical rate-and-state friction laws predict that during the static-to-kinetic transition, friction increases for nanometer-per-second slip rates, but decreases for micrometers-per-second rates and above. These transients are believed to be associated with contact strengthening (aging) at static interfaces, although their physical basis is unclear and the crossover between regimes has never been observed directly. Here we show, through nanometer-resolution sliding experiments on macroscopic rough surfaces, that these transients are segments of a single, universal non-monotonic response whose peak defines static friction. We show that this behavior arises from mechanical reorganization of interlocking surface asperities under shear, fundamentally distinct from contact aging, which is governed by thermal molecular processes. We derive, from first principles and without invoking any empirical postulates, a differential equation that quantitatively captures the friction peak. These results unify frictional transients across scales and speeds, and establish a physics-based framework for understanding frictional instabilities and failure processes in engineering and geosciences.

Title: Quantum oscillations and transport properties of layered single-crystal SrCu$_4$As$_2$
Authors: Sudip Malick, Michał J. Winiarski, Joanna Bławat, Hanna Świątek, John Singleton, Tomasz Klimczuk
Abstract: We report a systematic investigation of the physical properties and Fermi-surface topology of layered single-crystal \ce{SrCu4As2} using electrical transport, magnetotransport, and quantum-oscillation experiments plus band-structure calculations. The temperature-dependent electrical resistivity reveals a hysteretic phase transition at $T_P$ = 59 K, most likely associated with a structural change. Hall resistivity data suggest a marked change in the average hole density resulting from the latter phase transition near $T_P$. A large, linear, and nonsaturating magnetoresistance is observed at low temperatures in \ce{SrCu4As2}, likely attributable to the multipocket Fermi surface. Quantum-oscillation data measured in magnetic fields of up to 60 T show several oscillation frequencies exhibiting low effective masses, indicating the presence of Dirac-like band dispersion in \ce{SrCu4As2}, as suggested by the band structure calculations.

Title: Topological bands in metals
Authors: Yu. B. Kudasov
Abstract: In crystalline systems with a superstructure, the electron dispersion can form a nontrivial covering of the Brillouin zone. It is proved that the number of sheets in this covering and its monodromy are topological invariants under ambient isotopy. As a concrete manifestation of this nontrivial topology, we analyze three-sublattice models for 120$^\circ$-ordered helimagnets in one, two, and three dimensions. The two-dimensional system exhibits unconventional $f$-wave magnetism and a specific topological metal state characterized by a spin-textured, one-sheeted Fermi surface. The observable transport signatures of the topological metal and its potential experimental realization are briefly discussed.

Title: Grain volume distribution alters the critical phenomena in complex granular systems
Authors: Teng Man, Yimin Lu, Zhongrong Wang, Herbert Huppert, Alessio Zaccone, Honglei Sun
Abstract: The grain size distribution (GSD) plays an important role in the mechanical properties of amorphous disordered systems and complex granular materials. Varying GSD causes segregation issues and alters critical behaviors. This work used the discrete element method (DEM) to investigate the rheological and critical behaviors of sheared granular flows with various GSDs. The results show that, while a unified rheological relation can be obtained, a characteristic length scale, which is associated with the contact probability and can be obtained from any GSD, is embedded within such a polydisperse disordered system. We further acquire a correlation function between critical solid fractions and dimensionless grain volume distributions. This work elucidates the effect of particle volumes on the rheology and micromechanics of dry granular systems and provides further insights in better incorporating the influence of other particle properties into a unified framework, which is helpful and critical for the corresponding engineering and geophysical problems.

Title: Quantum Fisher Information as a Thermal and Dynamical Probe in Frustrated Magnets: Insights from Quantum Spin Ice
Authors: Chengkang Zhou, Zhengbang Zhou, Félix Desrochers, Yong Baek Kim, Zi Yang Meng
Abstract: Quantum Fisher information (QFI) is a novel measure of multipartite quantum entanglement that can be measured in inelastic neutron scattering experiments on quantum magnets. In this work, we demonstrate that the QFI can be used to understand the thermal and dynamical properties of quantum magnets by focusing on the pyrochlore lattice model of quantum spin ice (QSI), a three-dimensional quantum spin liquid that hosts fractionalized quasiparticles and emergent photons. We use the newly developed multi-directed loop update quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm and exact diagonalization (ED) to compute the QFI, which is further utilized to calibrate the gauge mean-field theory results. We show that the temperature and momentum dependence of the QFI can reveal characteristic energy scales of distinct phases and phase transitions in the global phase diagram. In particular, the QFI can clearly distinguish the ferromagnetic ordered phase, the thermal critical region above it, as well as two distinct QSI phases, namely zero-flux and $\pi$-flux QSI. Moreover, the QFI shows two crossover temperature scales, one from the trivial paramagnet to the classical spin ice regime and a lower temperature crossover to QSI. We discuss our results, especially for the $\pi$-flux QSI, in light of the ongoing experimental efforts on Cerium-based pyrochlore systems. Our results demonstrate that the QFI not only detects entanglement properties but can also be viewed as a sensitive thermal and dynamical probe in the investigation of quantum magnets.

Title: Disorder-assisted Spin-Filtering at Metal/Ferromagnet Interfaces: An Alternative Route to Anisotropic Magnetoresistance
Authors: Ivan Iorsh, Mikhail Titov
Abstract: We introduce a minimal interface-scattering mechanism that produces a sizable anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) in metal/ferromagnet bilayers (e.g., Pt/YIG) without invoking bulk spin or orbital Hall currents. In a $\delta$-layer model with interfacial exchange and Rashba spin-orbit coupling, charge transfer at a high-quality interface creates a spin-selective phase condition (interfacial spin filtering) that suppresses backscattering for one spin projection while enhancing momentum relaxation for the other. The resulting resistance anisotropy peaks at an optimal metal thickness of a few nanometers, quantitatively reproducing the thickness and angular dependences typically attributed to spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR), as well as its characteristic magnitude. Remarkably, the maximal AMR scales linearly with the smaller of the two coupling strengths - exchange or spin-orbit, highlighting a mechanism fundamentally distinct from SMR. Our scattering formulation maps onto Boltzmann boundary conditions and predicts other clear discriminants from SMR, including strong sensitivity to interfacial charge transfer and disorder.

Title: Electron transport in junctions between altermagnets
Authors: Shubham Ghadigaonkar, Sachchidanand Das, Abhiram Soori
Abstract: We theoretically investigate electron transport in junctions between the two AMs in strong and weak altermagnetic phases. The charge and spin conductivities are analyzed as functions of angle between the Néel vectors of the two AMs $\theta$. In the strong AM regime, the charge conductivity vanishes as $\theta \to \pi$, while in the weak AM phase it remains finite. Introducing a normal metal between two AMs leads to Fabry-Pérot-type oscillations in charge conductivity. In the strong phase, transport is dominated by up-spin electrons, whereas both spin channels contribute in the weak phase. These results highlight the potential of AM-based heterostructures for spintronic applications, such as spin filters, and quantum interference-based spintronic devices, where tunable spin-dependent transport and interference effects can be utilized in electronic devices.

Title: Electric field controlled second-order anomalous Hall effect in altermagnets
Authors: Arnob Mukherjee, Biplab Sanyal, Annica M. Black-Schaffer, Ankita Bhattacharya
Abstract: Altermagnets are a recently discovered class of compensated magnets with momentum-dependent spin splittings and unusual transport properties, even without a net magnetization. In the presence of combined four-fold rotation and time-reversal ($C_4\mathcal{T}$) symmetry, linear and also second-order, driven by a Berry curvature dipole, anomalous Hall responses are forbidden in any pure $d$-wave altermagnet. Nevertheless, here we find that the nontrivial quantum metric of the occupied Bloch states allows for an electric field induced Berry curvature dipole, which generates a strong and tunable second-order Hall current, enabling it to be switched on or off by simply adjusting the relative orientation between the symmetry-reducing dc field and the ac probe field. Specifically, we investigate the electric field induced second-order anomalous Hall response in a two-dimensional Rashba-coupled hybrid altermagnet that interpolates between $d_{x^2-y^2}$ ($B_{1g}$) and $d_{xy}$ ($B_{2g}$) altermagnet symmetry, motivated by recent proposals for mixed-symmetry states. Crucially, the nonlinear signal is highly sensitive to the underlying symmetry of the altermagnetic order at specific doping levels, offering a purely electrical method to distinguish distinct altermagnetic orders. Our results position hybrid altermagnets as a promising platform for controllable nonlinear transport and spintronic applications.

Title: Skyrmion behavior in attractive-repulsive square array of pinning centers
Authors: L. Basseto, N. P. Vizarim, J. C. Bellizotti Souza, P. A. Venegas
Abstract: We investigate the driven dynamics of a single skyrmion in a square lattice of mixed pinning sites, where attractive and repulsive defects coexist using a particle-based model. The mixed landscape yields directional locking at $\theta_{\rm sk}=-45^\circ$ and flow at locked angles near the intrinsic skyrmion Hall angle. By mapping defect strengths, we show that weaker attraction lowers the depinning threshold, whereas stronger repulsion stabilizes and broadens the $-45^\circ$ locking plateau. Moreover, combinations of attractive and repulsive defect strengths allows control of directional lockings and their force ranges. Defect size further tunes the response, selecting among $-45^\circ$, $-50^\circ$, $-55^\circ$, and $\approx-59^\circ$. These results establish mixed pinning as a practical knob to steer skyrmion trajectories and the effective Hall response, providing design guidelines for skyrmion-based memory and logic devices.

Title: A universal description of Mott insulators: Characterizing quantum phases beyond broken symmetries
Authors: Matheus de Sousa, Zhiyu Fan, Wei Ku
Abstract: Using Mott insulators as a prototypical example, we demonstrate a dynamics-based characterization of quantum phases of matter through a general N-body renormalization group framework. The essential "Mott-ness" turns out to be characterized by a change of size-scaling of the effective intra- momentum repulsions between long-lived emergent "eigen-particles" that encodes the dynamics of two-body bound states in the high-energy sector. This directly offers a universal characterization at long space-time scale for the corresponding class of Mott insulators through a uniform single occupation of all momenta, and otherwise Mott metals. This universal description naturally paves the way to topological Mott insulators and is straightforward to extend to bosonic Mott systems. More generally, this demonstration exemplifies a generic paradigm of characterizing quantum phases of matter through their distinct dynamics beyond broken symmetries.

Title: Extra force in charged resonant capacitors: a new macroscopic effect of vacuum fluctuations ?
Authors: Yury Minenkov, Massimo Bassan
Abstract: We report on measurements of the mechanical vibrations of the fundamental mode of resonant capacitive transducers, consisting of parallel plates at different gaps (10 - 26 $\mu$m). Resonant frequency data were taken vs the electric field at constant charge, at various temperatures and different configurations. All measurements exhibited unexpectedly large tuning, caused by an additional, unpredicted attractive force. Such force has a divergent behaviour characterized by a critical electrical field and start to diverge long before the critical point. Many known physical mechanisms have been considered to explain this force, but all of them had to be discarded. Thus, we turn to non-conventional physical mechanisms and suggest that vacuum fluctuations inside the gap could be a possible cause of this anomalous force.

Title: Low-Energy DNA Bubble Dynamics via the Quantum Coulomb Potential
Authors: Juan D. García-Muñoz, A. Contreras-Astorga, L. M. Nieto
Abstract: We developed a low-energy model that can be used at any time to describe the dynamics of DNA bubbles at temperatures below the melting point. The Schrödinger equation associated with this problem is solved in imaginary time with a quantum Coulomb potential, and we obtain an approximate expression for its more general physical solution as a linear combination of the states whose energies are close to the lower bound energy. We can then determine the probability density, the first-passage time density, and the correlation functions in terms of Bessel functions. Our findings are consistent with results obtained directly from the Fokker-Planck equation. Comparisons with the Gamma and Diffusion models are discussed.

Title: Diffeomorphism invariant tensor networks for 3d gravity
Authors: Vijay Balasubramanian, Charlie Cummings
Abstract: Tensor networks prepare states that share many features of states in quantum gravity. However, standard constructions are not diffeomorphism invariant and do not support an algebra of non-commuting area operators. Recently, analogues of both problems were addressed in a tensor network discretization of topological field theories (TFT) with finite or compact gauge groups. Here, we extend this work towards gravity by generalizing to gauge groups that are discrete or continuous, compact or non-compact. Applied to $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{R}) \times \text{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ Chern-Simons theory, our construction can be interpreted as building states of three dimensional gravity with a negative cosmological constant. Our tensor networks prepare states that satisfy the constraints of Chern-Simons theory. In metric variables, this implies that the states we construct satisfy the Wheeler-DeWitt equation and momentum constraints, and so are diffeomorphism invariant.

Title: Quantum State Designs via Magic Teleportation
Authors: Hugo Lóio, Guglielmo Lami, Lorenzo Leone, Max McGinley, Xhek Turkeshi, Jacopo De Nardis
Abstract: We investigate how non-stabilizer resources enable the emergence of quantum state designs within the projected ensemble. Starting from initial states with finite magic and applying resource-free Clifford circuits to scramble them, we analyze the ensemble generated by performing projective Pauli measurements on a subsystem of the final state. Using both analytical arguments and large-scale numerics, we show that the projected ensemble converges towards a state $k$-design with an error that decays exponentially with the $k$-th Stabilizer Renyi Entropy of the pre-measurement state, via a Magic-Induced Design Ansatz (MIDA) that we introduce. We identify a universal scaling form, valid across different classes of magic initial states, and corroborate it through numerical simulations and analytical calculations of the frame potential. For finite-depth Clifford unitaries, we show that the timescales at which state designs emerge are controlled by the transport of magic. We identify a ``magic teleportation'' mechanism whereby non-Clifford resources injected locally spread through Clifford scrambling and measurements across distances beyond the lightcone. Our results demonstrate how a small and controlled amount of magic suffices to generate highly random states, providing a systematic route toward generating quantum state designs in early fault-tolerant devices.

Title: Subdimensional Disorder and Logarithmic Defect
Authors: Soichiro Shimamori, Yifan Wang
Abstract: We study quenched disorder localized on a $p$-dimensional subspacetime in a $d$-dimensional conformal field theory. Motivated by the logarithmic behavior often associated with disorder, we introduce a defect setup in which bulk local operators transform in ordinary conformal representations, while defect local operators assemble into logarithmic multiplets. We refer to such objects as logarithmic defects and investigate their model-independent properties dictated solely by conformal symmetry and its representation theory, including correlation functions, logarithmic defect operator expansions, and conformal blocks. As a concrete example, we analyze the free scalar theory with a generalized pinning defect subject to random coupling fluctuations, and we identify a half-line of fixed points describing the corresponding logarithmic conformal defects. Along the way, we propose a candidate monotone governing defect renormalization group flows induced by subdimensional disorder. We comment on various generalizations and the broader program of bootstrapping logarithmic defects.

Title: Temporal Entanglement Transitions in the Periodically Driven Ising Chain
Authors: Karun Gadge, Abhinav Prem, Rishabh Jha
Abstract: Periodically driven quantum systems can host non-equilibrium phenomena without static analogs, including in their entanglement dynamics. Here, we discover $temporal$ $entanglement$ $transitions$ in a Floquet spin chain, which correspond to a quantum phase transition in the spectrum of the entanglement Hamiltonian and are signaled by dynamical spontaneous symmetry breaking. We show that these transitions are entanglement-driven, i.e., they require initially entangled states and remain invisible to conventional local observables. Intriguingly, we find these transitions across a broad range of driving frequencies (from adiabatic to high-frequency regime) and independently of drive details, where they manifest as periodic, sharp entanglement spectrum reorganizations marked by the Schmidt-gap closure, a vanishing entanglement echo, and symmetry-quantum-number flips. At high frequencies, the entanglement Hamiltonian acquires an intrinsic timescale decoupled from the drive period, rendering the transitions genuine steady-state features. Finite-size scaling reveals universal critical behavior with correlation-length exponent $\nu=1$, matching equilibrium Ising universality despite its emergence from purely dynamical mechanisms decoupled from static criticality. Our work establishes temporal entanglement transitions as novel features in Floquet quantum matter.

Title: Representation of tensor functions using lower-order structural tensor set: three-dimensional theory
Authors: Mohammad Madadi, Pu Zhang
Abstract: The representation theory of tensor functions is a powerful mathematical tool for constitutive modeling of anisotropic materials. A major limitation of the traditional theory is that many point groups require fourth- or sixth-order structural tensors, which significantly impedes practical engineering applications. Recent advances have introduced a reformulated representation theory that enables the modeling of anisotropic materials using only lower-order structural tensors (i.e., second-order or lower). Building upon the reformulated theory, this work establishes the representations of tensor functions for three-dimensional centrosymmetric point groups. For each point group, we propose a lower-order structural tensor set and derive the representations of tensor functions explicitly. For scalar-valued and second-order symmetric tensor-valued functions, our theory is indeed applicable to all three-dimensional point groups because their representations are determined by the corresponding centrosymmetric groups. The representation theory presented here is broadly applicable for constitutive modeling of anisotropic materials.

Title: Nonlinear near-field spectroscopy of exciton-polaritons in a van der Waals layered waveguide
Authors: Valeriy I. Kondratyev, Vanik Shahnazaryan, Mikhail Tyugaev, Tatyana V. Ivanova, Ivan E. Kalantaevskii, Dmitry V. Permyakov, Ivan V. Iorsh, Anton K. Samusev, Vasily Kravtsov
Abstract: Layered van der Waals materials offer novel opportunities for on-chip waveguiding and development of integrated photonic circuits. In the strong light-matter coupling regime, their nonlinear response can be significantly enhanced, which is crucial for developing active photonic devices. However, probing the nonlinearity of waveguide modes in subwavelength-thick structures is challenging as they are not directly accessible from far-field. Here we apply a novel nonlinear near-field spectroscopic technique based on a GaP solid immersion lens and femtosecond laser excitation to study nonlinearity of guided modes in monolayer WS$_2$ encapsulated in hBN under the strong light-matter coupling regime. We reveal formation of exciton-polaritons with $\sim 50$ meV Rabi splitting and demonstrate a pump-induced transition from strong to weak coupling. Our results show that exciton resonance saturation and broadening lead to an efficient nonlinear response of guided polaritons, which can be employed for developing compact van der Waals photonic switches and modulators.

Title: Universal energy-space localization and stable quantum phases against time-dependent perturbations
Authors: Hongye Yu, Tzu-Chieh Wei
Abstract: Stability against perturbation is a highly nontrivial property of quantum systems and is often a requirement to define new phases. In most systems where stability can be rigorously established, only static perturbations are considered; whether a system is stable against generic time-dependent perturbations remains largely elusive. In this work, we identify a universal phenomenon in $q$-local Hamiltonians called energy-space localization and prove that it can survive under generic time-dependent perturbations, where the evolving state is exponentially localized in an energy window of the instantaneous spectrum. The property holds ubiquitously, and the leakage bounds remain invariant under arbitrarily monotonic rescaling of evolution time. This flexibility enables the energy-space localization to be a powerful tool in proving the stability of systems. For spin glass models where the configuration spaces are separated by large energy barriers, the localization in energy space can induce a true localization in the configuration space and robustly break ergodicity. We then demonstrate the applications of our results in several systems with such barriers. For certain LDPC codes, we show that the evolving state is localized near the original codeword for an exponentially long time even under generic time-dependent perturbations. We also extend the stability of LDPC codes against static $q$-local perturbations to quasi-$q$-local. In addition, we show that for some classical hard optimization problems with clustered solution space, the stability becomes an obstacle for quantum Hamiltonian-based algorithms to drive the system out of local minima. Our work provides a new lens for analyzing the non-equilibrium dynamics of generic quantum systems, and versatile mathematical tools for stability proving and quantum algorithm design.

Title: Bloch-Landau-Zener Oscillations in Moiré Lattices
Authors: Sergey K. Ivanov, Yaroslav V. Kartashov, Vladimir V. Konotop
Abstract: We develop a theory of two-dimensional Bloch-Landau-Zener (BLZ) oscillations of wavepackets in incommensurate moiré lattices under the influence of a weak linear gradient. Unlike periodic systems, aperiodic lattices lack translational symmetry and therefore do not exhibit a conventional band-gap structure. Instead, they feature a mobility edge, above which (in the optical context) all modes become localized. When a linear gradient is applied to a moiré lattice, it enables energy transfer between two or several localized modes, leading to the oscillatory behavior referred to as BLZ oscillations. This phenomenon represents simultaneous tunneling in real space and propagation constant (energy) space, and it arises when quasi-resonance condition for propagation constants and spatial proximity of interacting modes (together constituting a selection rule) are met. The selection rule is controlled by the linear gradient, whose amplitude and direction play a crucial role in determining the coupling pathways and the resulting dynamics. We derive a multimode model describing BLZ oscillations in the linear regime and analyze how both attractive and repulsive nonlinearities affect their dynamics. The proposed framework can be readily extended to other physical systems, including cold atoms and Bose-Einstein condensates in aperiodic potentials.

Title: Living Capillary Bridges
Authors: Tytti Kärki, Senna Luntama, Yasamin Modabber, Saila Pönkä, Gonca Erdemci-Tandogan, Mikko Karttunen, Grégory Beaune, Jaakko V. I. Timonen
Abstract: Biological tissues exhibit complex behaviors with their dynamics often resembling inert soft matter such as liquids, polymers, colloids, and liquid crystals. These analogies enable physics-based approaches for investigations of emergent behaviors in biological processes. A well-studied case is the spreading of cellular aggregates on solid surfaces, where they display dynamics similar to viscous droplets. \textit{In vivo}, however, cells and tissues are in a confined environment with varying geometries and mechanical properties to which they need to adapt. In this work, we compressed cellular aggregates between two solid surfaces and studied their dynamics using microscopy, and computer simulations. The confined cellular aggregates transitioned from compressed spheres into dynamic living capillary bridges exhibiting bridge thinning and a convex-to-concave meniscus curvature transition. We found that the stability of the bridge is determined by the interplay between cell growth and cell spreading on the confining surfaces. This interaction leads to bridge rupture at a critical length scale determined by the distance between the plates. The force distributions, formation and stability regimes of the living capillary bridges were characterized with full 3D computer simulations that included cell division, migration and growth dynamics, directly showing how mechanical principles govern the behavior of the living bridges; cellular aggregates display jamming and stiffening analogously to granular matter, and cell division along the long axis enhances thinning. Based on our results, we propose a new class of active soft matter behavior, where cellular aggregates exhibit liquid-like adaptation to confinement, but with self-organized rupturing driven by biological activity.

Title: Jump Processes with Self-Interactions: Large Deviation Asymptotics
Authors: Amarjit Budhiraja, Francesco Coghi
Abstract: We consider a pure jump process $\{X_t\}_{t\ge 0}$ with values in a finite state space $S= \{1, \ldots, d\}$ for which the jump rates at time instant $t$ depend on the occupation measure $L_t \doteq t^{-1} \int_0^t \delta_{X_s}\,ds$. Such self-interacting chains arise in many contexts within statistical physics and applied probability. Under appropriate conditions, a large deviation principle is established for the pair $(L_t, R_t)$, as $t \to \infty$, where $R_t$ is the empirical flux process associated with the jump process. We show that the rate function takes a simple form that can be viewed as a dynamical generalization of the classical Donsker and Varadhan rate function for the analogous quantities in the setting of Markov processes, in particular, unlike the Markovian case, the rate function is not convex. Since the state process is non-Markovian, different techniques are needed than in the setting of Donsker and Varadhan and our proofs rely on variational representations for functionals of Poisson random measures and stochastic control methods.

Title: Unsupervised Learning to Recognize Quantum Phases of Matter
Authors: Mehran Khosrojerdi, Alessandro Cuccoli, Paola Verrucchi, Leonardo Banchi
Abstract: Drawing the quantum phase diagram of a many-body system in the parameter space of its Hamiltonian can be seen as a learning problem, which implies labelling the corresponding ground states according to some classification criterium that defines the phases. In this work we adopt unsupervised learning, where the algorithm has no access to any priorly labeled states, as a tool for determining quantum phase diagrams of many-body systems. The algorithm directly works with quantum states: given the ground-state configurations for different values of the Hamiltonian parameters, the process uncovers the most significant way of grouping them based on a similarity criterion that refers to the fidelity between quantum states, that can be easily estimated, even experimentally. We benchmark our method with two specific spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ chains, with states determined via tensor network techniques. We find that unsupervised learning algorithms based on spectral clustering, combined with ``silhouette'' and ``elbow'' methods for determining the optimal number of phases, can accurately reproduce the phase diagrams. Our results show how unsupervised learning can autonomously recognize and possibly unveil novel phases of quantum matter.

Title: Quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov Equations and Integrability of Quantum Field Theories with Time-dependent Interaction Strength
Authors: Parameshwar R. Pasnoori
Abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of solving quantum field theories with time dependent interaction strengths. We show that the recently formulated framework [P. R. Pasnoori, Phys. Rev. B 112, L060409 (2025)], which is a generalization of the regular Bethe ansatz technique, provides the exact many-body wavefunction. In this framework, the time-dependent Schrodinger equation is reduced to a set of analytic difference equations and matrix difference equations, called the quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (qKZ) equations. The consistency of the solution gives rise to constraints on the time-dependent interaction strengths. For interaction strengths satisfying these constraints, the system is integrable, and the solution to the qKZ and the analytic difference equations provides the explicit form of the many-body wavefunction that satisfies the time-dependent Schrodinger equation. We provide a concrete example by considering the $SU(2)$ Gross-Neveu model with time dependent interaction strength. Using this framework we solve the model with the most general time-dependent interaction strength and obtain the explicit form of the wave function.

Title: Signatures of Topological Symmetries on a Noisy Quantum Simulator
Authors: Christopher Lamb, Robert M. Konik, Hubert Saleur, Ananda Roy
Abstract: Topological symmetries, invertible and otherwise, play a fundamental role in the investigation of quantum field theories. Despite their ubiquitous importance across a multitude of disciplines ranging from string theory to condensed matter physics, controlled realizations of models exhibiting these symmetries in physical systems are rare. Quantum simulators based on engineered solid-state devices provide a novel alternative to conventional condensed matter systems for realizing these models. In this work, eigenstates of impurity Hamiltonians and loop operators associated with the topological symmetries for the Ising conformal field theory in two space-time dimensions are realized on IBM's Kingston simulator. The relevant states are created on the quantum device using a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm. The latter is based on a variation of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm ansatz combined with the quantum natural gradient optimization method. Signatures of the topological symmetry are captured by measuring correlation functions of different qubit operators with results obtained from the quantum device in reasonable agreement with those obtained from classical computations. The current work demonstrates the viability of noisy quantum simulators as platforms for investigating low-dimensional quantum field theories with direct access to observables that are often difficult to probe in conventional condensed matter experiments.

Title: Ruelle-Pollicott Decay of Out-of-Time-Order Correlators in Many-Body Systems
Authors: Jerónimo Duarte, Ignacio García-Mata, Diego A. Wisniacki
Abstract: The out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC) quantifies information scrambling in quantum systems and serves as a key diagnostic of quantum chaos. In one-body systems with a classical counterpart, the relaxation of the OTOC is governed by Ruelle-Pollicott resonances. For many-body systems lacking a semiclassical limit, recent studies have identified an analogous role played by the Liouvillian spectrum of weakly open extensions of the dynamics, where the slowest decay rate -- the Liouvillian gap -- encodes relaxation. Here we study the kicked Ising spin chain and show that the long-time exponential decay of the OTOC in the isolated system occurs at a rate equal to twice this intrinsic gap. This correspondence persists even in crossover regimes between integrability and chaos, demonstrating that the Liouvillian spectrum provides a unified framework for understanding relaxation and irreversibility in closed many-body quantum systems.

Title: Synthetic fractional flux quanta in a ring of superconducting qubits
Authors: Luca Chirolli, Juan Polo, Gianluigi Catelani, Luigi Amico
Abstract: A ring of capacitively coupled transmons threaded by a synthetic magnetic field is studied as a realization of a strongly interacting bosonic system. The synthetic flux is imparted through a specific Floquet modulation scheme based on a suitable periodic sequence of Lorentzian pulses that are known as 'Levitons'. Such scheme has the advantage to preserve the translation invariance of the system and to work at the qubit sweet spots. We employ this system to demonstrate the concept of fractional values of flux quanta. Although such fractionalization phenomenon was originally predicted for bright solitons in cold atoms, it may be in fact challenging to access with that platform. Here, we show how fractional flux quanta can be read out in the absorption spectrum of a suitable 'scattering experiment' in which the qubit ring is driven by microwaves.

Title: Transient Elasticity -- A Unifying Framework for Thixotropy, Polymers, and Granular Media
Authors: Mario Liu
Abstract: Having the elastic strain relax while observing energy conservation and entropy production yields a model called hydrodynamics of transient elasticity (HoTE). It interpolates between solid- and fluid-dynamics and provides a broad framework for many systems such as polymers, granular media, thixotropic and yield-stress fluids. Focusing on the last two systems, this paper shows that, with little efforts at model sculpting, HoTE easily accounts for many effects, including: static and dynamic yield stress, over- and under-shoot of stresses at rate jumps, hysteresis at rate ramps and rate inversion, "viscosity bifurcation", acceleration on a tilted plane, shear band, elastic shear waves, aging and rejuvenation.

Title: $\textit{Ab initio}$ correlated calculations without finite basis-set error: Numerically precise all-electron RPA correlation energies for diatomic molecules
Authors: Hao Peng, Xinguo Ren
Abstract: In wavefunction-based $\textit{ab-initio}$ quantum mechanical calculations, achieving absolute convergence with respect to the one-electron basis set is a long-standing challenge. In this work, using the random phase approximation (RPA) electron correlation energy as an example, we show how to compute the basis-error-free RPA correlation energy for diatomic molecules by iteratively solving the Sternheimer equations for first-order wave functions in the prolate spheroidal coordinate system. Our approach provides RPA correlation energies across the periodic table to any desired precision; in practice, the convergence of the absolute RPA energies to the meV-level accuracy can be readily attained. Our method thus provides unprecedented reference numbers that can be used to assess the reliability of the commonly used computational procedures in quantum chemistry, such as the counterpoise correction to the basis set superposition errors, the frozen-core approximation, and the complete-basis-set extrapolation scheme. Such reference results can also be used to guide the development of more efficient correlation-consistent basis sets. The numerical techniques developed in the present work also have direct implications for the development of basis error-free schemes for the GW method or the \textit{ab initio} quantum chemistry methods such as MP2.

Title: Localized fermions on the triangular lattice with Ising-like interactions
Authors: Lubomíra Regeciová (Institute of Experimental Physics Slovak Academy of Sciences, Košice, Slovakia), Konrad Jerzy Kapcia (Institute of Spintronics and Quantum Information, Faculty of Physics and Astronomy, Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań, Poland)
Abstract: The model of localized fermions on the triangular lattice is analyzed in means of the Monte Carlo simulations in the grand canonical ensemble. The Hamiltonian of the system has a form of the extended Hubbard model (at the atomic limit) with nearest-neighbor Ising-like magnetic $J$ interactions and onsite Coulomb $U$ interactions. The model is investigated for both signs of $J$, arbitrary $U$ interaction and arbitrary chemical potential $\mu$ (or, equivalently, arbitrary particle concentration $n$). Based on the specific heat capacity and sublattice magnetization analyses, the phase diagrams of the model are determined. For ferromagnetic case ($J<0$), the transition from the ordered phase (which is a standard ferromagnet and can be stable up to $k_{B}T/|J| \approx 0.61$) is found to be second-order (for sufficiently large temperatures $k_{B}T/|J| \gtrsim 0.2$) or first-order (for $-1<U/|J|<-0.65$ at the half-filling, i.e., $n=1$). In the case of $J>0$, the ordered phase occurs in a range of $-1/2<U/|J|<0$ (for $n=1$), while for larger $U$ the state with short-range order is also found (also for $n \neq 1$). The ordered phase is characterized by an antiferromagnetic arrangement of magnetic moments in two sublattices forming the hexagonal lattice. The transition from this ordered phase, which is found also for $\mu \neq 0$ ($n \neq 1$) and $U/|J|>-1/2$ is always second-order for any model parameters. The ordered phase for $J>0$ can be stable up to $k_{B}T/|J| \approx 0.06$.

Title: Stabilization of active tissue deformation by a dynamic signaling gradient
Authors: Muhamet Ibrahimi, Matthias Merkel
Abstract: A key process during animal morphogenesis is oriented tissue deformation, which is often driven by internally generated active stresses. Yet, such active oriented materials are prone to well-known instabilities, raising the question of how oriented tissue deformation can be robust during morphogenesis. Here we study under which conditions active oriented deformation can be stabilized by the concentration pattern of a signaling molecule, which is secreted by a localized source region, diffuses across the tissue, and degrades. Consistent with earlier results, we find that oriented tissue deformation is always unstable in the gradient-contractile case, i.e. when active stresses act to contract the tissue along the direction of the signaling gradient, and we now show that this is true even in the limit of large diffusion. However, active deformation can be stabilized in the gradient-extensile case, i.e. when active stresses act to extend the tissue along the direction of the signaling gradient. Specifically, we show that gradient-extensile systems can be stable when the tissue is already elongated in the direction of the gradient. We moreover point out the existence of a formerly unknown, additional instability of the tissue shape change. This instability results from the interplay of active tissue shear and signal diffusion, and it indicates that some additional feedback mechanism may be required to control the target tissue shape. Taken together, our theoretical results provide quantitative criteria for robust active tissue deformation, and explain the lack of gradient-contractile systems in the biological literature, suggesting that the active matter instability acts as an evolutionary selection criterion.

Title: Josephson diode effect via a non-equilibrium Rashba system
Authors: Michiyasu Mori, Wataru Koshibae, Sadamichi Maekawa
Abstract: A non-equilibrium state in a Rashba system under an in-plane magnetic field is identified as the origin of the Josephson diode effect. This state is induced by a current bias--necessary for measuring the current-voltage characteristics--which shifts the Fermi momentum away from equilibrium. This essential mechanism has been overlooked in previous studies. This oversight stems from the implicit assumption that the equilibrium-based formulations are sufficient to describe Josephson effect. We formulate the Josephson coupling via the non-equilibrium Rashba system under current bias using a tunneling Hamiltonian, where the Rashba system is modeled as one-dimensional. When the magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the current, the Josephson coupling becomes asymmetric, giving rise to the diode effect. The magnitude and sign of this effect depend on the distance between the superconducting electrodes $d$, the in-plane magnetic field, and the spin-orbit coupling strength. Our results clarify the microscopic origin of the Josephson diode effect, which can be optimized by tuning $d$.

Title: Spontaneous Emergence of Run-and-Tumble-Like Dynamics in a Robotic Analog of \textit{Chlamydomonas}: Experiment and Theory
Authors: Somnath Paramanick, Umashankar Pardhi, Harsh Soni, Nitin Kumar
Abstract: Run-and-tumble (RT) motion is commonly observed in flagellated microswimmers, arising from synchronous and asynchronous flagellar beating. One such example is a biflagellated alga, called \textit{Chlamydomonas reinhardtii}. Its flagellar synchronization is not only affected by hydrodynamic interactions but also through contractile stress fibers that mechanically couple the flagella, enabling adaptable swimming behavior. To explore this, we design a macroscopic mechanical system that comprises dry, self-propelled robots linked by a rigid rod to model this organism. By varying the attachment points of the two ends of the rod on each robot, the model incorporates the effect of fiber contractility observed in the real organism. To mimic a low Reynolds number environment, we program each robot to undergo overdamped active Brownian (AB) motion. We find that such a system exhibits RT-like behavior, characterized by sharp, direction-reversing tumbles and exponentially distributed run times, consistent with the real organism. Moreover, we quantify tumbling frequency and demonstrate its tunability across experimental parameters. Additionally, we provide a theoretical model that reproduces our results, elucidating physical mechanisms governing RT dynamics. Thus, our robotic system not only replicates RT motion but also captures several subtle characteristics, offering valuable insights into the underlying physics of microswimmer motility.

Title: (Anti-)Altermagnetism from Orbital Ordering in the Ruddlesden-Popper Chromates Sr$_{n+1}$Cr$_n$O$_{3n+1}$
Authors: Quintin N. Meier, Alberto Carta, Claude Ederer, Andres Cano
Abstract: Altermagnets are collinear antiferromagnets with spin-split electronic states. We introduce Ruddlesden-Popper chromates Sr$_{n+1}$Cr$_n$O$_{3n+1}$ (including SrCrO$_3$) as candidate materials in which altermagnetism can emerge from spontaneous orbital ordering rather than crystal symmetry. First-principles calculations reveal a layer-dependent spin splitting: if the spin and orbital orders align in adjacent layers, the system exhibits non-relativistic spin splitting, and thus altermagnetism. In contrast, if either the spin or the orbital order is reversed in adjacent layers, we observe a layerwise uncompensated spin splitting, that is compensated in the adjacent layer, giving rise to the concept of anti-altermagnetism. In the RP series, odd $n$ members support coexistence of altermagnetism and anti-altermagnetism, whereas even $n$ and the perovskite limit are strictly anti-altermagnetic. In both cases, larger $n$ favors metallicity, and in odd $n$ compounds strain can further stabilize altermagnetism.

Title: Thermal behavior of Bose-Einstein condensates of polar molecules
Authors: Juan Sánchez-Baena, Gerard Pascual, Raúl Bombín, Ferran Mazzanti, Jordi Boronat
Abstract: We use the finite-temperature extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation (TeGPE) to study a condensate of dipolar NaCs molecules under the conditions of the very recent, breakthrough experiment [Bigagli this http URL., Nature 631, 289 (2024)]. We report the condensate fraction of the system, and its density profile after a time-of flight expansion for the coldest experimental case, finding excellent agreement with the experimental measurements. We also report the peak density of the ground state and establish a comparison with the experimental estimates. Our results, derived from the TeGPE formalism, successfully describe the Bose-Einstein condensation of polar molecules at finite temperature.

Title: Pinch-line spin liquids as layered Coulomb phases and applications to cubic models
Authors: Naïmo Davier, Flavia A. Gómez Albarracín, H. Diego Rosales, Pierre Pujol, Ludovic D. C. Jaubert
Abstract: Spin liquids form fluctuating magnetic textures which have to obey certain rules imposed by frustration. These rules can often be written in the form of a Gauss law, indicating the local conservation of an emergent electric field. In reciprocal space, these emergent Gauss laws appear as singularities known as pinch points, that are accessible to neutron-scattering measurements. But more exotic forms of electromagnetism have been stabilized in spin liquids, and in a few rare instances, these zero-dimensional singularities have been extended into one-dimensional pinch lines. Here we propose a simple framework for the design of pinch-line spin liquids in a layered structure of two-dimensional algebraic spin liquids. A plethora of models can be build within this framework, as exemplified by several concrete examples where our theory is confirmed by simulations, and where the rank of the tensorial gauge field is continuously varied along the pinch line, opening new avenues in fractonic matter. Then we use our framework to understand how the evolution of the singularity pinch point along the pinch line can be understood as the interference pattern of two emergent electric fields. Finally, we apply our intuition on these emergent electric fields in real space to generic pinch line models beyond our layered framework, and revisit the recently proposed pinch line model on the octochlore lattice.

Title: Tunable resonant s-p mixing of excitons in van der Waals heterostructures
Authors: Jiayu David Cao, Konstantin S. Denisov, Igor Zutic
Abstract: Excitonic states of tightly-bound electron-hole pairs dominate the optical response in a growing class of two-dimensional (2D) materials and their van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures. In transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) a useful guidance for the excitonic spectrum is the analogy with the states in the 2D hydrogen atom. From our symmetry analysis and solving the Bethe-Salpeter equations we find a much richer picture for excitons and predict their tunable resonant s-p mixing. The resonance is attained when the subband splitting matches the energy difference between the 1s and 2p+ (or 2p-) excitons, resulting in the anticrossing of the spectral lines in the absorption as a function of the subband splitting. By focusing on TMDs modified by magnetic proximity, and gated 3R-stacked bilayer TMD, we corroborate the feasibility of such tunable spin splitting. The resulting tunable and bright s-p excitons provide unexplored opportunities for their manipulation and enable optical detection of Rashba or interlayer coupling in vdW heterostructures.

Title: Tilted dipolar bosons in the quasi-two-dimensional regime: From liquid stripes to droplets
Authors: Juan Sánchez-Baena
Abstract: We characterize a system of tilted dipoles in a quasi two-dimensional (flattened) geometry and in the thermodynamic limit. We consider a finite trapping in the z-axis achievable in current experiments. We compute the phase diagram of the system at its equilibrium density for high tilting angles, where it becomes self-bound, and a striped liquid state emerges. To characterize the system, we perform a variational calculation, which is benchmarked with the solution of the extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation. We connect the phenomenology in the thermodynamic limit to the physics of the finite-size system, provide parameters for the realization of potentially supersolid striped states and study the critical number for dipolar droplet formation. Our results are helpful to guide potential experiments in the study of dipolar atoms in quasi two-dimensional geometries in the dipole-dominated regime.

Title: Particle-Hole Asymmetry and Pinball Liquid in a Triangular-Lattice Extended Hubbard Model within Mean-Field Approximation
Authors: Aleksey Alekseev, Agnieszka Cichy, Konrad Jerzy Kapcia
Abstract: Recently, triangular lattice models have received a lot of attention since they can describe a number of strongly-correlated materials that exhibit superconductivity and various magnetic and charge orders. In this research we present an extensive analysis of the charge-ordering phenomenon of the triangular-lattice extended Hubbard model with repulsive onsite and nearest-neighbor interaction, arbitrary charge concentration, and $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ supercell (3-sublattice assumption). The model is solved in the ground state with the mean-field approximation which allowed to identify $8$ charge-ordered phases and a large variety of phase transitions. An exotic pinball-liquid phase was found and described. Moreover, strong particle-hole asymmetry of the phase diagram is found to play an important role for triangular lattices. The detailed analysis of band structures, unavailable for more advanced methods, such as dynamical mean-field theory, allowed us to interpret the found triangular-lattice phases and provided a great insight into the mechanisms behind the phase transitions that can also be met when correlation effects are taken into account. The complexity of the mean-field phase diagram showed the importance and usefulness of the results for the further research with correlation effects included. Together with atomic-limit approximation it can serve them as both a starting point, and a tool to interpret results.

Title: Finding local integrals of motion in quantum lattice models in the thermodynamic limit
Authors: J. Pawlowski, J. Herbrych, M. Mierzejewski
Abstract: Local integrals of motion (LIOMs) play a key role in understanding the long-time properties of closed macroscopic systems. They were found for selected integrable systems via complex analytical calculations. The existence of LIOMs and their structure can also be studied via numerical methods, which, however, involve exact diagonalization of Hamiltonians, posing a bottleneck for such studies. We show that finding LIOMs in translationally invariant lattice models or unitary quantum circuits can be reduced to a problem for which one may numerically find an exact solution in the thermodynamic limit. We develop a simple algorithm and demonstrate its efficiency by calculating LIOMs and bounds on correlations (the Mazur bounds) for infinite integrable spin chains and unitary circuits. Finally, we demonstrate that this approach identifies slow modes in nearly integrable spin models and estimates their relaxation times.

Title: Estimating the Diffuseness for the Non-Relaxor Type Ferroelectric to Paraelectric Phase Transition in BaTiO3
Authors: Prithwiraj Ganguly, Prashant Joshi, Maneesha Puthiyoth, Dilip Sasmal, Somaditya Sen
Abstract: The normal ferroelectric to paraelectric phase transition in model ferroelectric materials such as BaTiO3 is typically characterized by a sharp, well-defined dielectric constant peak at a specific transition temperature. However, under certain modifications of the parent material, this transition can become diffuse over a broad range of temperatures. This has garnered significant research attention over the past few decades, primarily because of its intriguing and not yet fully understood physical properties. The parameters developed to measure the diffuseness are also ambiguous. In this work, an investigation has been conducted to understand the transition dynamics of the non-relaxor ferroelectric systems in the temperature interval over which the diffuse phase transition occurs. This is achieved by modelling the dielectric response phenomenologically, using a distribution of local transition temperatures. Moreover, a temperature dependent differential analysis is introduced, enabling the clear demarcation of distinct dielectric regimes and providing enhanced insight into the evolution of the phase transition. It is strongly recommended that the degree of diffuseness is skeptical in many senses. Hence, following the establishment, a simple yet effective new measure of diffuseness is being proposed, offering a more accurate and physically meaningful estimation of the diffuse phase transition.

Title: Demonstration of returning Thouless pump in a Berry dipole system
Authors: Qingyang Mo, Shanjun Liang, Xiangke Lan, Jie Zhu, Shuang Zhang
Abstract: The Thouless pump, a cornerstone of topological physics, enables unidirectional quantized wave/particle transport via geometric Berry phase engineering in periodically driven systems. While decades of research have been dedicated to monopole-mediated pumping, mechanisms governed by higher-order singularities like Berry dipoles remain unexplored. Here, we report the experimental demonstration of a Berry-dipole-mediated returning Thouless pump (RTP) in a 1D acoustic waveguide array achieved through adiabatic encircling of a Berry dipole singularity. During this adiabatic cycle, an initial edge-localized mode first delocalizes into the bulk and eventually returns to the original edge, marking the characteristic signature of the RTP. Notably, this RTP exhibits an interesting feature of pseudospin flipping. The demonstrated RTP contrasts sharply with the well-studied monopole-governed pumps that feature unidirectional transport.

Title: Floquet topological phases of higher winding numbers in extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model under quenched drive
Authors: Rittwik Chatterjee, Asim Kumar Ghosh
Abstract: In this study topological properties of static and dynamic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger models with staggered further neighbor hopping terms of different extents are investigated. Topological characterization of the static chiral models is established in terms of conventional winding number while Floquet topological character is studied by a pair of winding numbers. With the increase of extent of further neighbor terms topological phases with higher winding numbers are found to emerge in both static and dynamic systems. Topological phase diagrams of static models for four different extents of further neighbor terms are presented, which has been generalized for arbitrary extent afterwards. Similarly, Floquet topological phase diagrams of four such dynamic models have been presented. For every model four different parametrizations of hopping terms are introduced which exhibits different patterns of topological phase diagrams. In each case emergence of `0' and `$\pi$' energy edge states is noted and they are found to consistent to the bulk-boundary correspondence rule applicable for chiral topological systems.

Title: Insight into the Correlation of Shape and Magnetism of Hematite Nanospindles
Authors: Juri Kopp, Gerald Richwien, Markus Heidelmann, Soma Salamon, Benoît Rhein, Annette M. Schmidt, Joachim Landers
Abstract: It is established that the Morin transition, a spin reorientation in hematite, is shifted to lower temperatures with decreasing nanoparticle volume. However, our findings indicate an opposite effect in a series of hematite nanospindles: The particles, synthesized by hydrothermal decomposition of iron(III) chloride solution, with aspect ratios $p$ between $1.0$ and $5.2$ (long axis ca. $70$--$290$ nm) display decreasing Morin transition temperatures $T_{\text{Morin}}$ upon increasing $p$, despite the volume increase. Their inner morphology, determined via (HR)STEM and XRD, shows that they are formed by the epitactical fusion of primary particles, perfectly aligned in terms of crystallographic orientation. Combining magnetometry and Mössbauer spectroscopy, we uncover the correlation between particle shape, magnetic properties, and in particular the Morin transition: While more spherical particles undergo said transition at about $200$ K, $T_{\text{Morin}}$ decreases upon higher nanospindle elongation, while also being broadened and showing a wider thermal hysteresis. Our measurements reveal complete suppression of the Morin transition beyond a critical threshold $p \gtrapprox 1.5$, indicating stabilization of the weak ferromagnetic (WFM) state with net particle magnetic moment within the hematite basal plane, despite such behavior being unexpected based on shape anisotropy considerations. For the correlated, magnetic field-dependent spin-flop transition, a comparable trend in particle aspect ratio is detected. We have demonstrated the presence of intermediate spin alignment states that deviate both from the low-temperature antiferromagnetic (AFM) and high-temperature WFM spin structure for slightly elongated particles, likely being connected to the suppression of the Morin transition observed for $p \gtrapprox 1.5$.

Title: Topology meets symmetry breaking: Hidden order, intrinsically gapless topological states and finite-temperature topological transitions
Authors: Reja H. Wilke, Henning Schlömer, Simon M. Linsel, Annabelle Bohrdt, Fabian Grusdt
Abstract: Since the discovery of phase transitions driven by topological defects, the classification of phases of matter has been significantly extended beyond Ginzburg and Landau's paradigm of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB). In particular, intrinsic and symmetry-protected topological (SPT) orders have been discovered in (mostly gapped) quantum many-body ground states. However, these are commonly viewed as zero-temperature phenomena, and their robustness in a gapless ground state or against thermal fluctuations remains challenging to tackle. Here we introduce an explicit construction for SPT-type states with hidden order associated with SSB: They feature (quasi) long-range correlations along appropriate edges, but short-range order in the bulk; ground state degeneracy associated with SSB; and non-local string order in the bulk. We apply our construction to predict two types of finite-temperature SPT transitions, in the Ising and BKT class respectively, where the usual signs of criticality appear despite the absence of a diverging correlation length in the bulk. While the state featuring hidden Ising order is gapped, the other SPT state associated with the BKT-SPT transition has hidden $U(1)$, or XY-order and constitutes an intrinsically gapless SPT state, associated with a gapless Goldstone mode. Specifically, in this work we discuss spins with global $\mathbb{Z}_2$ or $U(1)$ symmetry coupled to link variables constituting a loop gas model. By mapping this system to an Ising-gauge theory, we demonstrate that one of the SPT phases we construct corresponds to the Higgs-SPT phase at $T=0$ -- which we show here to remain stable at finite temperature. Our work paves the way for a more systematic search for hidden order SPT phases, including in gapless systems, and raises the question if a natural (finite-$T$) spin liquid candidate exists that realizes hidden order in the Higgs-SPT class.

Title: Quantization and quantum oscillations of the sublattice charge order in Dirac insulators
Authors: Arindam Tarafdar, Tigran A. Sedrakyan
Abstract: We report the quantization, quantum oscillations, and singular behavior of sublattice symmetry-breaking sublattice charge order (SCO) in two-dimensional Dirac insulators at charge neutrality under perpendicular magnetic fields $B$. SCO is induced by staggered sublattice potentials, such as those originating from substrates, strains, hydrogenation, and chemical doping. In small non-quantizing magnetic fields that result in less than a flux quantum threading the system, and small sublattice symmetry breaking potentials, SCO exhibits perturbative singular magnetic field dependence, $\sim |B|$, originating from hopping between neighboring sites of the same sublattice. At intermediate magnetic fields, when the cyclotron gap between the zeroth Landau level and the first Landau level, $\omega_c$, is smaller than the sublattice potential, $\omega_c\lesssim \Delta$, SCO shows $\textit{universally}$ quantized plateaus owing to discrete Landau-level degeneracy. As the magnetic flux increases by one flux quantum, one electron (per spin) is transferred from the sublattice with a higher chemical potential to the sublattice with a lower chemical potential. One electron transfer between sublattices per flux quantum results from the sublattice polarization of the zeroth Landau level in gapped Dirac materials, realizing the topological Thouless pump effect. At stronger magnetic fields, $\omega_c\gtrsim \ \Delta$, corresponding to integer quantum Hall regimes, SCO displays singularities based on the physics of quantum magneto-oscillations. Our findings suggest new ways to experimentally detect the presence of the energy gap in Dirac materials, irrespective of the gap size.

Title: Accelerating Two-Dimensional Materials Research via a Universal Interatomic Potential and Large Language Model Agent
Authors: Haidi Wang, Yufan Yao, Haonan Song, Xiaofeng Liu, Zhao Chen, Weiwei Chen, Weiduo Zhu, Zhongjun Li, Jinlong Yang
Abstract: Accurate interatomic potentials (IAPs) are essential for modeling the potential energy surfaces (PES) that govern atomic interactions in materials. However, most existing IAPs are developed for bulk materials and struggle to accurately and efficiently capture the diverse chemical environment of two-dimensional (2D) materials. This limitation poses a significant barrier to the large-scale design and simulation of emerging 2D systems. To address this challenge, we present a universal interatomic potential tailored for 2D materials. Our model is trained on a dataset comprising 327,062 structure-energy-force-stress mappings derived from 20,114 2D materials, spanning 89 chemical elements. The results show high predictive accuracy, with mean absolute errors of 6 meV/atom for energies, 80 meV/Åfor atomic forces, and 0.067 GPa for stress tensors. It demonstrates broad applicability across a range of atomistic tasks, including structural relaxation, lattice dynamics, molecular dynamics, material discovery, and so on. To further enhance usability and accessibility, we introduce an intelligent agent powered by a large language model (LLM), enabling natural language interaction for 2D materials property simulations. Our work provides not only a precise and universal IAP for 2D systems, but also an intelligent, user-friendly platform that enables high-throughput screening, property prediction, and theoretical exploration, thereby accelerating advances in 2D materials research.

Title: Spin-orbit interaction in tubular prismatic nanowires
Authors: Anna Sitek, Sigurdur I. Erlingsson, Andrei Manolescu
Abstract: We theoretically study the spin-orbit interaction in the outer regions of core-shell nanowires that can act as tubular, prismatic conductors. The polygonal cross section of these wires induces non-uniform electron localization along the wire perimeter. In particular, low-energy electrons accumulate in the corner regions, and in the case of narrow shells, conductive channels form along the sharp edges. In contrast, higher-energy electrons are shifted toward the facets. These two groups of states may be separated by large energy gaps, which can exceed the room-temperature energy in the case of triangular geometries. We compare the impact of spin-orbit interaction on the corner and side states of hexagonal and triangular shells grown on hexagonal cores as well as on triangular shells grown on triangular cores. We find that the spin-orbit splitting, and thus the degeneracy of energy states at finite wave vectors, strongly depend on the tube's geometry. We demonstrate that the weak spin-orbit coupling observed in clean wires can be significantly enhanced if the intermixing of core and shell materials takes place. Moreover, we show that the energy spectrum in the presence of spin-orbit interaction allows for estimating the interaction between states and shows that triangular shells can act as three independent wires in the low-energy regime, while they behave as interacting systems at higher-energy ranges.

Title: Phonon- and magnon-mediated decoherence of a magnonic qubit
Authors: Vemund Falch, Arne Brataas, Jeroen Danon
Abstract: We investigate the decoherence of magnonic qubits in small ferromagnetic insulators and compute the relaxation and dephasing rates due to magnon-phonon and magnon-magnon interactions. We combine a Bloch--Redfield description with Keldysh non-equilibrium field theory to find explicit expressions for the rates. For a quadratic dispersion and assuming a uniform mode defines the qubit, we find that decay into two phonons is the only allowed relaxation process at zero temperature. The low resonance frequency and heavy unit cell strongly suppress this process in yttrium-iron-garnet. We also find that the dephasing rate scales with the inverse of size and damping of the magnet, and could become large for small and clean magnets. Our calculation thus provides additional insight into the viability of magnon-based quantum devices.

Title: Spin Currents in Rashba Altermagnets: From Equilibrium to Nonlinear Regimes
Authors: Priyadarshini Kapri
Abstract: We investigate equilibrium (background), linear, and nonlinear spin currents in two-dimensional Rashba spin-orbit coupled altermagnet systems, using a modified spin current operator that includes anomalous velocity from non-zero Berry curvature. The background spin current, stemming from spin-orbit coupling and modulated by the altermagnet term ($t_j$), exhibits in-plane polarization, increases linearly with Fermi energy ($\epsilon_F$), and is enhanced by both the altermagnet ($t_j$) and the Rashba parameter ($\lambda$). Linear spin current is always transverse with out-of-plane polarization and can be viewed as Spin Hall current, primarily driven by band velocity, with $t_j$ enabling a band-induced contribution (previously absent in simple Rashba systems ($t_j=0$)). This highlights altermagnet system as a promising source of spin Hall current generation. For linear spin Hall current, its band contribution's magnitude increases linearly with $\epsilon_F$, while the magnitude of anomalous component saturates at higher $\epsilon_F$. Further, the magnitude of spin Hall current is enhanced by $t_j$ but reduced by $\lambda$. Nonlinear spin currents feature both longitudinal and transverse components with in-plane polarization. Both the nonlinear longitudinal spin current from band velocity and the nonlinear transverse spin current from anomalous velocity initially decrease with $\epsilon_F$ before saturating at higher $\epsilon_F$. Importantly, $t_j$ reduces these currents while $\lambda$ enhances them. Meanwhile, the nonlinear transverse current from band velocity increases and then saturates with $\epsilon_F$, enhanced by $\lambda$ and showing non-monotonic variation with $t_j$. These findings highlight the tunability of spin current behavior through Rashba and altermagnet parameters, offering insights for spintronic applications.

Title: Characterization of WSe$_2$ films using reflection Kikuchi diffraction in the scanning electron microscope and multivariate statistical analyses
Authors: Tianbi Zhang, Jakub Holzer, Tomáš Vystavěl, Miroslav Kolíbal, Estácio Paiva de Araújo, Chris Stephens, T. Ben Britton
Abstract: The study of thin films and 2D materials, including transition metal dichalcogenides such as WSe$_2$ offers opportunities to leverage their properties in advanced sensors, quantum technologies, and device to optimize functional performance. In this work, we characterize thin WSe$_2$ samples with variable thicknesses using scanning electron microscope (SEM)-based techniques focused on analysis of backscattered electron signal and Kikuchi diffraction patterns. These data were collected via a pixelated electron-counting direct electron detector positioned below the pole piece primarily configured for reflection Kikuchi diffraction (RKD), and a similar detector placed in the more conventional electron backscatter diffraction geometry. In addition to conventional pattern analysis for orientation microscopy, multivariate statistical methods (MSA) based on principal component analysis were applied to analyze diffraction patterns and differentiate thickness variations and crystal orientations within the thin films through data clustering. These results were compared with atomic force microscopy to validate thickness measurements. Our findings indicate that RKD combined with MSA is highly effective for characterizing 2D materials, enabling simultaneous assessment of thickness and crystallographic orientation. Systematic acceleration voltage variations in RKD experiments and comparisons with EBSD data suggest that the thickness dependency arises from inelastic scattering of diffracted electrons, which affects pattern contrast in the thin film regime. Collection and analysis of patterns obtained from monolayer, bilayer and tri-layer of WSe$_2$ are also demonstrated. This work reinforces the utility of SEM-based techniques, such as RKD, as valuable tools for the materials characterization toolkit, particularly for thin films and 2D materials.

Title: Engineering Quantum Wire States for Atom Scale Circuitry
Authors: Max Yuan, Lucian Livadaru, Roshan Achal, Jason Pitters, Furkan Altincicek, Robert Wolkow
Abstract: Recent advances in hydrogen lithography on silicon surfaces now enable the fabrication of complex and error-free atom-scale circuitry. The structure of atomic wires, the most basic and common circuit elements, plays a crucial role at this scale, as the exact position of each atom matters. As such, the characterization of atomic wire geometries is critical for identifying the most effective configurations. In this study, we employed low-temperature (4.5 K) scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) to systematically fabricate and characterize six planar wire configurations made up of silicon dangling bonds (DBs) on the H-Si(100) surface. Crucially, the characterization was performed at the same location and under identical tip conditions, thereby eliminating artifacts due to the local environment to reveal true electronic differences among the line configurations. By performing dI/dV line spectroscopy on each wire, we reveal their local density of states (LDOS) and demonstrate how small variations in wire geometry affect orbital hybridization and induce the emergence of new electronic states. Complementarily, we deploy density functional theory (DFT) and non-equilibrium Green's functions to compute the LDOS and evaluate transmission coefficients for the most promising wire geometries. Our results indicate that dimer and wider wires exhibit multiple discrete mid-gap electronic states which could be exploited for signal transport or as custom quantum dots. Furthermore, wider wires benefit from additional current pathways and exhibit increased transmission, while also demonstrating enhanced immunity to hydrogen defects.

Title: Efficient $GW$ band structure calculations using Gaussian basis functions and application to atomically thin transition-metal dichalcogenides
Authors: Rémi Pasquier, María Camarasa-Gómez, Anna-Sophia Hehn, Daniel Hernangómez-Pérez, Jan Wilhelm
Abstract: We present a $GW$ space-time algorithm for periodic systems in a Gaussian basis including spin-orbit coupling. We employ lattice summation to compute the irreducible density response and the self-energy, while we employ $k$-point sampling for computing the screened Coulomb interaction. Our algorithm enables accurate and computationally efficient quasiparticle band structure calculations for atomically thin transition-metal dichalcogenides. For monolayer MoS$_\text{2}$, MoSe$_\text{2}$, WS$_\text{2}$, and WSe$_\text{2}$, computed $GW$ band gaps agree on average within 50 meV with plane-wave-based reference calculations. $G_0W_0$ band structures are obtained in less than two days on a laptop (Intel i5, 192 GB RAM) or in less than 30 minutes using 1024 cores. Overall, our work provides an efficient and scalable framework for $GW$ calculations on atomically thin materials.

Title: Odd elasticity in disordered chiral active materials
Authors: Cheng-Tai Lee, Tom C. Lubensky, Tomer Markovich
Abstract: Chiral active materials are abundant in nature, including the cytoskeleton with attached motor proteins, rotary clusters of bacteria flagella, and self-spinning starfish embryos. These materials break both time reversal and mirror-image (parity) symmetries due to injection of torques at the microscale. Recently, it was found that chiral active materials may show a new type of elastic response termed `odd' elasticity. Currently, odd elasticity is understood microscopically only in ordered structures, e.g., lattice designs of metamaterials. It still remains to explore how odd elasticity can emerge in natural or biological systems, which are usually disordered. To address this, we propose a minimal generic model for disordered `odd solids', using micropolar (Cosserat) elasticity in the presence of local active torques. We find that odd elasticity naturally emerges as a nonlinear effect of internal particle rotations. Exploring the viscoelasticity of this solid, when immersed in active self-spinning solvent (`odd fluid'), we discover both dynamically unstable regions and regions in which bulk waves can propagate even in an overdamped solid.

Abstract: We present a framework for characterizing higher-order topological phases directly from the one-particle density matrix, without any reference to an underlying Hamiltonian. Our approach extends the mode-shell correspondence, originally formulated for single-particle Hamiltonians, to Gaussian states subject to chiral constraints. In this correspondence, the mode index counts topological boundary modes, while the shell index quantifies the bulk topology in a region surrounding the modes, providing a bulk-boundary diagnostic. In one-dimensional topological insulators, the shell index reduces to the local chiral marker, recovering the winding number in the translation-invariant limit. We apply the mode-shell correspondence to a $C_4$-symmetric higher-order topological insulator with a chiral constraint and show that a fractional shell index implies that the higher-order phase is intrinsic. The one-particle density matrix is formulated in real space, so the mode-shell correspondence also applies to models without translation invariance. By introducing structural disorder into the $C_4$-symmetric higher-order insulator, we show that the mode-shell correspondence remains a meaningful diagnostic in amorphous structures. The mode-shell correspondence generalizes to interacting states with a gapped bulk spectrum in the one-particle density matrix, providing a practical and diverse route to characterize higher-order topology from the quantum state itself.

Title: A set of master variables for the two-star random graph
Authors: Pawat Akara-pipattana, Oleg Evnin
Abstract: The two-star random graph is the simplest exponential random graph model with nontrivial interactions between the graph edges. We propose a set of auxiliary variables that control the thermodynamic limit where the number of vertices N tends to infinity. Such `master variables' are usually highly desirable in treatments of `large N' statistical field theory problems. For the dense regime when a finite fraction of all possible edges are filled, this construction recovers the mean-field solution of Park and Newman, but with an explicit control over the 1/N corrections. We use this advantage to compute the first subleading correction to the Park-Newman result, which encodes the finite, nonextensive contribution to the free energy. For the sparse regime with a finite mean degree, we obtain a very compact derivation of the Annibale-Courtney solution, originally developed with the use of functional integrals, which is comfortably bypassed in our treatment.

Title: Compensation in trilayered anisotropic 6-state clock model
Authors: Olivia Mallick, Muktish Acharyya
Abstract: The equilibrium behaviours of a trilayered 6-state clock model have been investigated by Monte Carlo simulation. The intralayer interaction is considered ferromagnetic, whereas the interlayer interaction is antiferromagnetic. Periodic boundary conditions(PBC) are applied in XY plane and open boundary condition (OBC) is applied along Z-direction. The thermodynamic behaviours of sublattice magnetisation, total magnetisation, magnetic susceptibility and the specific heat are studied as functions of the temperature. The interesting compensation phenomenon, when the total magnetisation vanishes keeping the nonzero sublattice magnetisations, has been observed. The compensation temperature and the critical temperature are found to depend on the strength of single-site anisotropy. The comprehensive phase diagram is shown in the temperature-anisotropy plane. The larger systems show the growth of the height of the peak of the susceptibility near the critical temperature.

Title: Thermodynamic constraints and pseudotransition behavior in a one-dimensional water-like system
Authors: F. F. Braz, S. M. de Souza, M. L. Lyra, Onofre Rojas
Abstract: We investigate a one-dimensional water-like lattice model with Van der Waals and hydrogen-bond interactions, allowing for particle number fluctuations through a chemical potential. The model, defined on a chain with periodic boundary conditions, exhibits three ground-state phases: gas, bonded liquid, and dense liquid, separated by sharp phase boundaries in the chemical potential and temperature plane. Using the transfer matrix method, we derive exact analytical results within the grand-canonical ensemble and examine the finite-temperature behavior. The system exhibits clear pseudotransition features, including sharp but analytic changes in entropy, density, and internal energy, along with finite peaks in specific heat and correlation length. To assess the role of thermodynamic constraints, we consider the behavior under fixed density through a Legendre transformation. This constrained analysis reveals smoother anomalies, such as entropy kinks and finite jumps in specific heat, contrasting with the sharper grand-canonical signatures. These results underscore the ensemble dependence of pseudotransitions and show how statistical constraints modulate critical-like behavior. We also verify that the residual entropy continuity criterion holds in the grand-canonical ensemble but is violated when the system is constrained. Our findings illustrate how even a simple one-dimensional model can mimic water-like thermodynamic anomalies.

Title: Coupling Magnons to an Opto-Electronic Parametric Oscillator
Authors: Junming Wu, Shihao Zhou, Benedetta Flebus, Wei Zhang
Abstract: Hybrid magnonic systems have emerged as versatile modular components for quantum signal transduction and sensing applications owing to their capability of connecting distinct quantum platforms. To date, the majority of the magnonic systems have been explored in a local, near-field scheme, due to the close proximity required for realizing a strong coupling between magnons and other excitations. This constraint greatly limits the applicability of magnons in developing remotely-coupled, distributed quantum network systems. On the contrary, opto-electronic architectures hosting self-sustained oscillations has been a unique platform for longhaul signal transmission and processing. Here, we integrated an opto-electronic oscillator with a magnonic oscillator consisting of a microwave waveguide and a Y3Fe5O12(YIG) sphere, and demonstrated strong and coherent coupling between YIG's magnon modes and the opto-electronic oscillator's characteristic photon modes - revealing the hallmark anti-crossing gap in the measured spectrum. In particular, the photon mode is produced on-demand via a nonlinear, parametric process as stipulated by an external seed pump. Both the internal cavity phase and the external pump phase can be precisely tuned to stabilize either degenerate or nondegenerate auto-oscillations. Our result lays out a new, hybrid platform for investigating long-distance coupling and nonlinearity in coherent magnonic phenomena, which may be find useful in constructing future distributed hybrid magnonic systems.

Title: Conformal Data for the O(3) Wilson-Fisher CFT from Fuzzy Sphere Realization of Quantum Rotor Model
Authors: Arjun Dey, Loic Herviou, Christopher Mudry, Andreas Martin Läuchli
Abstract: We present a model for strongly interacting fermions with internal O(3) symmetry on the fuzzy-sphere that (i) preserves the rotational symmetry of the fuzzy sphere and (ii) undergoes a quantum phase transition in the (2+1)-dimensional O(3) Wilson-Fisher universality class. Using exact diagonalization (ED) and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), we locate the quantum critical point via conformal perturbation theory and obtain scaling dimensions from finite-size spectra. We identify 24 primary operators and determine some of their operator product expansion coefficients through first-order conformal perturbation theory. The results are benchmarked against conformal bootstrap and large quantum-number expansions and reveal a weakly irrelevant operator that plays a role in dimerized antiferromagnets. Our work establishes the fuzzy sphere as a general framework for quantitatively accessing conformal data in non-Abelian conformal field theories (CFTs).

Title: Quantifying Charge Noise Sources in Quantum Dot Spin Qubits via Impedance Spectroscopy, DLTS, and C-V Analysis
Authors: Tyafur Rahman Pathan, Daryoosh Vashaee
Abstract: The coherence and fidelity of quantum dot (QD) spin qubits are fundamentally limited by charge noise arising from electrically active trap states at oxide interfaces, heterostructure boundaries, and within the bulk semiconductor. These traps introduce electrostatic fluctuations that couple to the qubit via spin-orbit interactions or charge-sensitive confinement potentials, leading to dephasing and gate errors. In this work, we present a general trap characterization framework for identifying and quantifying the spectral signatures of these trap states using AC impedance spectroscopy, deep-level transient spectroscopy (DLTS), and conventional capacitance-voltage (C-V) analysis. While our case study focuses on strained Ge/SiGe quantum well heterostructures, the approach is broadly applicable to other material systems and qubit types. We demonstrate that each class of traps (oxide interface, quantum well interface, and bulk) exhibits distinct fingerprints across frequency- and time-domain measurements. Oxide traps dominate the low-frequency conductance peaks and appear strongly in Nyquist and transient spectra. QW interface traps, despite being nearly invisible at low densities in conventional C-V and AC impedance analysis, are clearly resolved through multi-exponential decay signatures in time-domain response. Bulk traps contribute to high-frequency admittance and steady-state leakage currents. By correlating each trap type to its characteristic time constant, spatial location, and spectral impact, we provide a diagnostic toolset for disentangling noise sources that degrade qubit performance. This unified methodology bridges traditional defect metrology with emerging qubit noise analysis and enables material- and process-level strategies for coherence optimization in scalable quantum devices.

Title: Algorithmic Temperature Induced by Adopted Regular Universal Turing Machine
Authors: Kentaro Imafuku
Abstract: We prove that an effective temperature naturally emerges from the algorithmic structure of a regular universal Turing machine (UTM), without introducing any external physical parameter. In particular, the redundancy growth of the machine's wrapper language induces a Boltzmann--like exponential weighting over program lengths, yielding a canonical ensemble interpretation of algorithmic probability. This establishes a formal bridge between algorithmic information theory and statistical mechanics, in which the adopted UTM determines the intrinsic ``algorithmic temperature.'' We further show that this temperature approaches its maximal limit under the universal mixture (Solomonoff distribution), and discuss its epistemic meaning as the resolution level of an observer.

Title: Determining the optimal structural resolution of proteins through an information-theoretic analysis of their conformational ensemble
Authors: Margherita Mele, Raffaele Fiorentini, Thomas Tarenzi, Giovanni Mattiotti, Raffaello Potestio
Abstract: The choice of structural resolution is a fundamental aspect of protein modelling, determining the balance between descriptive power and interpretability. Although atomistic simulations provide maximal detail, much of this information is redundant to understand the relevant large-scale motions and conformational states. Here, we introduce an unsupervised, information-theoretic framework that determines the minimal number of atoms required to retain a maximally informative description of the configurational space sampled by a protein. This framework quantifies the informativeness of coarse-grained representations obtained by systematically decimating atomic degrees of freedom and evaluating the resulting clustering of sampled conformations. Application to molecular dynamics trajectories of dynamically diverse proteins shows that the optimal number of retained atoms scales linearly with system size, averaging about four heavy atoms per residue--remarkably consistent with the resolution of well-established coarse-grained models, such as MARTINI and SIRAH. Furthermore, the analysis shows that the optimal retained atoms number depends not only on molecular size but also on the extent of conformational exploration, decreasing for systems dominated by collective motions. The proposed method establishes a general criterion to identify the minimal structural detail that preserves the essential configurational information, thereby offering a new viewpoint on the structure-dynamics-function relationship in proteins and guiding the construction of parsimonious yet informative multiscale models.

Title: A recipe for local simulation of strongly-correlated fermionic matter on quantum computers: the 2D Fermi-Hubbard model
Authors: Arash Jafarizadeh, Frank Pollmann, Adam Gammon-Smith
Abstract: The simulation of quantum many-body systems, relevant for quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics, is one of the most promising applications of near-term quantum computers before fault-tolerance. However, since the vast majority of quantum computing technologies are built around qubits and discrete gate-based operations, the translation of the physical problem into this framework is a crucial step. This translation will often be device specific, and a suboptimal implementation will be punished by the exponential compounding of errors on real devices. The importance of an efficient mapping is already revealed for models of spinful fermions in two or three dimensions, which naturally arise when the relevant physics relates to electrons. Using the most direct and well-known mapping, the Jordan-Wigner transformation, leads to a non-local representation of local degrees of freedom, and necessities efficient decompositions of non-local unitary gates into a sequence of hardware accessible local gates. In this paper, we provide a step-by-step recipe for simulating the paradigmatic two-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model on a quantum computer using only local operations. To provide the ingredients for such a recipe, we briefly review the plethora of different approaches that have emerged recently but focus on the Derby-Klassen compact fermion mapping in order to make our discussion concrete. We provide a detailed recipe for an end-to-end simulation including embedding on a physical device, preparing initial states such as ground states, simulation of unitary time evolution, and measurement of observables and spectral functions. We explicitly compute the resource requirements for simulating a global quantum quench and conclude by discussing the challenges and future directions for simulating strongly-correlated fermionic matter on quantum computers.

Title: Moments and saddles of heavy CFT correlators
Authors: David Poland, Gordon Rogelberg
Abstract: We study the operator product expansion (OPE) of identical scalars in a conformal four-point correlator as a Stieltjes moment problem, and use Riemann-Liouville type fractional differential operators to generate classical moments from the correlation function. We use crossing symmetry to derive leading and subleading relations between moments in $\Delta$ and $J_2 \equiv \ell(\ell+d-2)$ in the ``heavy" limit of large external scaling dimension, and combine them with constraints from unitarity to derive two-sided bounds on moment sequences in $\Delta$ and the covariance between $\Delta$ and $J_2$. The moment sequences which saturate these bounds produce ``saddle point" solutions to the crossing equations which we identify as particular limits of correlators in a generalized free field (GFF) theory. This motivates us to study perturbations of heavy GFF four-point correlators by way of saddle point analysis, and we show that saddles in the OPE arise from contributions of fixed-length operator families encoded by a decomposition into higher-spin conformal blocks. To apply our techniques, we consider holographic correlators of four identical single scalar fields perturbed by a bulk interaction, and use their first few moments to derive Gaussian weight-interpolating functions that predict the OPE coefficients of interacting double-twist operators in the heavy limit.

Title: Benchmarking the quality of multiplexed qubit readout beyond assignment fidelity
Authors: Andras Di Giovanni, Adrian Skasberg Aasen, Jürgen Lisenfeld, Martin Gärttner, Hannes Rotzinger, Alexey V. Ustinov
Abstract: The accurate measurement of quantum two-level objects (qubits) is crucial for developing quantum computers. Over the last decade, the measure of choice for benchmarking readout routines for superconducting qubits has been assignment fidelity. However, this method only focuses on the preparation of computational basis states and therefore does not provide a complete characterization of the readout. Here, we expand the focus to the use of detector tomography to fully characterize multiqubit readout of superconducting transmon qubits. The impact of different readout parameters on the rate of information extraction is studied using quantum state reconstruction infidelity as a proxy. The results are then compared with assignment fidelities, showing good agreement for separable two-qubit states. We therefore propose the rate of infidelity convergence as a validation tool for assignment fidelity and a more comprehensive benchmark for single- and multiqubit readout optimization. To make the best use of experimental resources, we investigate the most efficient distribution of a limited shot budget between detector tomography and state reconstruction within the context of single- and two-qubit experiments. To address the growing interest in three-qubit gates and test scalability of the validation tool, we perform three-qubit quantum state tomography that goes beyond conventional readout-error-mitigation methods and find a factor of 30 reduction in quantum infidelity. Our results demonstrate that qubit readout correlations are not induced by a significantly reduced state distinguishability. Consequently, correlation coefficients can serve as a valuable tool in qubit readout optimization.

Title: Two-color magneto-optical trapping of ytterbium atoms
Authors: Xiao Li, Yufei Wang, Ligeng Yu, Bo Song
Abstract: We report laser cooling and trapping of ytterbium atoms in a two-color magneto-optical trap (MOT). Benefited from both the broad singlet transition ($^1\text{S}_0\rightarrow {}^1\text{P}_1$) and the narrow intercombination transition ($^1\text{S}_0\rightarrow {}^3\text{P}_1$) of ytterbium atoms, the two-color MOT enables rapid loading and efficient cooling. We systematically investigate the shielding effect of the intercombination transition by examining the atom loading and loss rates of single-color and two-color MOTs. Our findings are general and can be extended to other alkaline earth(-like) atoms.

Title: Nonequilibrium physics of brain dynamics
Authors: Ramón Nartallo-Kaluarachchi, Morten L. Kringelbach, Gustavo Deco, Renaud Lambiotte, Alain Goriely
Abstract: Information processing in the brain is coordinated by the dynamic activity of neurons and neural populations at a range of spatiotemporal scales. These dynamics, captured in the form of electrophysiological recordings and neuroimaging, show evidence of time-irreversibility and broken detailed balance suggesting that the brain operates in a nonequilibrium stationary state. Furthermore, the level of nonequilibrium, measured by entropy production or irreversibility appears to be a crucial signature of cognitive complexity and consciousness. The subsequent study of neural dynamics from the perspective of nonequilibrium statistical physics is an emergent field that challenges the assumptions of symmetry and maximum-entropy that are common in traditional models. In this review, we discuss the plethora of exciting results emerging at the interface of nonequilibrium dynamics and neuroscience. We begin with an introduction to the mathematical paradigms necessary to understand nonequilibrium dynamics in both continuous and discrete state-spaces. Next, we review both model-free and model-based approaches to analysing nonequilibrium dynamics in both continuous-state recordings and neural spike-trains, as well as the results of such analyses. We briefly consider the topic of nonequilibrium computation in neural systems, before concluding with a discussion and outlook on the field.

Title: Microwave-activated high-fidelity three-qubit gate scheme for fixed-frequency superconducting qubits
Authors: Kui Zhao, Wei-Guo Ma, Ziting Wang, Hao Li, Kaixuan Huang, Yun-Hao Shi, Kai Xu, Heng Fan
Abstract: Scalable superconducting quantum processors require balancing critical constraints in coherence, control complexity, and spectral crowding. Fixed-frequency architectures suppress flux noise and simplify control via all-microwave operations but remain limited by residual ZZ crosstalk. Here we propose a microwave-activated three-qubit gate protocol for fixed-frequency transmon qubits in the large-detuning regime ($|\Delta| \gg g$), leveraging the third-order nonlinear interaction to coherently exchange $\ket{001} \leftrightarrow \ket{110}$ states. By incorporating a phase-compensated optimization protocol, numerical simulations demonstrate a high average gate fidelity exceeding $99.9\%$. Systematic error analysis identifies static long-range ZZ coupling as the dominant error source in multi-qubit systems, which can be suppressed via operations in the large-detuning regime ($\sim 1$ GHz). The protocol maintains process fidelities exceeding $98\%$ under decoherence, while demonstrating intrinsic robustness to fabrication-induced parameter variations and compatibility with existing all-microwave two-qubit gate architectures. This hardware-efficient strategy advances scalable quantum computing systems by improving coherence properties, reducing spectral congestion, and expanding the experimental toolkit for error-resilient quantum operations in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era.

Title: Fast offline decoding with local message-passing automata
Authors: Ethan Lake
Abstract: We present a local offline decoder for topological codes that operates according to a parallelized message-passing framework. The decoder works by passing messages between anyons, with the contents of received messages used to move nearby anyons towards one another. We prove the existence of a threshold, and show that in a system of linear size $L$, decoding terminates with an $O((\log L)^\eta)$ average-case runtime, where $\eta$ is a small constant. For the toric code subject to i.i.d Pauli noise, our decoder has $\eta=1$ and a threshold at a noise strength of $p_c\approx 7.3\%$.

Title: Superuniversal Statistics with Topological Origins for non-Hermitian Scattering Singularities
Authors: Nadav Shaibe, Jared M. Erb, Steven M. Anlage
Abstract: Vortex singularities in speckle patterns formed from random superpositions of waves are an inevitable consequence of destructive interference and are consequently generic and ubiquitous. Singularities are topologically stable, meaning they persist under small perturbations and can only be removed via pairwise annihilation. They have applications including sensing, imaging and energy transfer in multiple fields such as optics, acoustics, and elastic or fluid waves. We generalize the concept of speckle patterns to arbitrary parameter spaces and any complex scalar function that describes wave phenomena involving complicated scattering. In scattering systems specifically, we are often concerned with singularities associated with complex zeros of various functions of the scattering matrix S, such as Coherent Perfect Absorption, Reflectionless Scattering Modes, Transmissionless Scattering Modes, and Exceptional Points. Experimentally, we find that all singularities share a universal statistical property: any quantity that diverges as a simple pole at a singularity has a probability distribution function with a -3 power law tail. The tail of the distribution provides an estimate for the likelihood of finding a given singularity in a generic system. We use these universal statistical results to determine that homogeneous system loss is the most important parameter determining singularity density in a given parameter space of an absorptive scattering system. Finally, we discuss events where distinct singularities coincide in parameter space, which result in higher order singularities that are not topologically protected, and we do not find universal statistical properties for them. We support our empirical results from microwave experiments with Random Matrix Theory simulations and conclude that the statistical results presented hold for all generic non-Hermitian scattering systems.

Title: Conformal bootstrap: from Polyakov to our times
Authors: Slava Rychkov
Abstract: We trace the history of conformal bootstrap from its early days to our times - a great example of unity of physics. We start by describing little-known details about the origins of conformal field theory in the study of strong interactions and critical phenomena in the 1960s and 1970s. We describe similarities and differences between approaches and results of the main groups in Moscow, Rome, and Sofia. Then come the breakthroughs in the 1980s and the 1990s, in particular 2D CFT and holography. Finally, we describe the genesis of the numerical conformal bootstrap, from the conformal technicolor bounds in the 2000s, to the determination of the 3D Ising critical exponents in the 2010s. We conclude with some outstanding challenges. We stress that conformal invariance is a symmetry of nature.

Title: Local active error correction from simulated confinement
Authors: Ethan Lake
Abstract: We refine an old idea for performing fault-tolerant error correction in topological codes by simulating confining interactions between excitations. We implement confinement using an array of local classical processors that measure syndromes, broadcast messages to neighboring processors, and move excitations using received messages. The dynamics of the resulting real-time decoder is geometrically local, homogeneous in spacetime, and self-organized, operating without any form of global control. We prove that below a threshold error rate, it achieves a memory lifetime scaling as a stretched exponential in the linear system size $L$, provided that it has access to $O({\rm polylog}(L))$ noiseless classical bits for each noisy qubit. When applied to the surface code subject to depolarizing noise and measurement errors of equal strength, numerics indicate a threshold at $p_c \approx 1.5\%$.
