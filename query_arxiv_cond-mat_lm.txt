Title: Vacancy Engineering in Metals and Alloys
Authors: Sreenivas Raguraman, Homero Reyes Pulido, Christopher Hutchinson, Arun Devaraj, Marc H. Weber, Timothy P. Weihs
Abstract: Vacancy engineering, the intentional control of atomic-scale vacancies in metals and alloys, is emerging as a powerful yet underexplored strategy for tailoring microstructures and optimizing performance across diverse applications. By enabling excess vacancy populations through quenching, severe deformation, thermomechanical treatments, or additive manufacturing, new microstructures can be obtained that achieve unique combinations of strength, ductility, fatigue life, corrosion resistance, and conductivity. Vacancies are distinct among lattice defects: they are non-conserved entities essential for solute diffusion, yet variably coupled to solutes, dislocations, and phase boundaries. They can accelerate transformations such as nucleation and precipitation or retard kinetics when trapped in clusters, and their transient trapping and release can drive microstructural evolution across time and length scales. This Review synthesizes recent advances in generating, modeling, and characterizing vacancies, highlighting their role in diffusion, precipitation, and phase stability. Case studies in lightweight, high-temperature, fatigue-resistant, electrical, and biomedical materials demonstrate the broad potential of vacancy control. We conclude by emphasizing the opportunity for the metallurgical community to fully exploit excess vacancies as controllable, design-relevant defects that enable new pathways for microstructure and property optimization in next-generation alloys.

Title: Towards superior van der Waals density functionals for molecular crystals
Authors: Dmitry V. Fedorov, Nikita E. Rybin, Mikhail A. Averyanov, Alexander V. Shapeev, Artem R. Oganov, Carlo Nervi
Abstract: Ubiquitous van der Waals (vdW) interactions play a subtle yet crucial role in determining the precise atomic arrangements in solids, particularly in molecular crystals where these weak forces are the primary link between constituent building blocks. Within density functional (DF) theory, the most natural approach for addressing vdW forces is the use of vdW-inclusive density functionals. Through a detailed analysis of the underlying formalism, we have developed a computational scheme that combines vdW functionals of type DF1 and DF2 and serves as a well optimizable tool to improve the theoretical description and prediction of molecular crystals and other sparse materials. The proof of principle is demonstrated by our consideration of the molecular crystals from the X23 dataset.

Title: CHIPS-TB: Evaluating Tight-Binding Models For Metals, Semiconductors, and Insulators
Authors: In Jun Park, Kamal Choudhary
Abstract: As semiconductor technologies continue to scale down to the nanoscale, the efficient prediction of material properties becomes increasingly critical. The tight-binding (TB) method is a widely used semi-empirical approach that offers a computationally tractable alternative to Density Functional Theory (DFT) for large-scale electronic structure calculations. However, conventional TB models often suffer from limited transferability and lack standardized benchmarking protocols. In this study, we introduce a computational framework (CHIPS-TB) for evaluating and comparing tight-binding parameterizations across diverse material systems relevant to semiconductor design, focusing on properties such as electronic bandgaps, band structures, and bulk modulus. We assess model parameterizations including Density Functional Tight-Binding (DFTB)-based MatSci, PBC, PTBP, SlaKoNet and TB3PY against OptB88vdW, TBmBJ-DFT and experimental reference data from the JARVIS-DFT database for 50+ materials pertinent to semiconductor applications. The CHIPS-TB code will be made publicly available on GitHub and benchmarks will be available on JARVIS-Leaderboard.

Title: Light-induced Asymmetric Pseudogap below T$_\text{c}$ in cuprates
Authors: D. Armanno, O. Gingras, F. Goto, J.-M. Parent, A. Longa, A. Jabed, B. Frimpong, R.D. Zhong, J. Schneeloch, G. D. Gu, G. Jargot, H. Ibrahim, F. Legare, B.J. Siwick, N. Gauthier, A. Georges, A.J. Millis, F. Boschini
Abstract: To this day, high-temperature cuprate superconductors remain an unparalleled platform for studying the competition and coexistence of emergent, static and dynamic, quantum phases of matter exhibiting high transition temperature non-s-wave superconductivity, non-Fermi liquid transport and a still enigmatic pseudogap regime. However, how superconductivity emerges alongside and competes with the pseudogap regime remains an open question. Here, we present a high-resolution, time- and angle-resolved photoemission study of the near-antinodal region of optimally-doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$. For a sufficiently high excitation fluence, we disrupt superconductivity and drive a transient change from a symmetric superconducting-like to an asymmetric pseudogap-like density of states, for electronic temperatures well below the equilibrium superconducting critical temperature. Conversely, when the superconductivity is fully restored, the pseudogap is suppressed, as signaled by a fully particle-hole symmetric density of states. A unique aspect of our experiments is that the pseudogap coexists with superconducting features at intermediate times or at intermediate fluence. Our findings challenge the paradigm that superconductivity emerges by establishing phase coherence in the pseudogap. Instead, our experimental results, supported by phenomenological theory, demonstrate that the two states compete, and that the low-temperature ground state of the cuprates originates from a competition between superconducting and pseudogap states.

Title: Strong-coupling theory of bilayer plasmon excitations
Authors: Hiroyuki Yamase, Luciano Zinni, Matías Bejas, Andrés Greco
Abstract: Recently plasmon excitations in bilayer lattice systems were studied extensively in the weak-coupling regime. Unlike single-layer systems, these bilayers exhibit two distinct modes, $\omega_{\pm}$, which show characteristic dependences upon the momentum and hopping integrals along the $z$ direction. To apply them to cuprates, strong correlation effects should be considered, but a comprehensive analysis has not yet been investigated. In this work, we present a strong-coupling theory to analyze the charge dynamics of a bilayer system, utilizing the $t$-$J$-$V$ model, which includes the long-range Coulomb interaction, $V$, on a lattice. Although our theoretical framework is fundamentally different from the weak-coupling approach, we find that resulting plasmon excitations are similar to those of a weak-coupling theory. A key distinction is that our strong-coupling framework reveals a noticeable suppression of particle-hole excitations, which allows the plasmon modes to remain well-defined over a wider region of momentum. We suggest that the experimentally reported plasmon excitations in Y-based cuprates can be described by the $\omega_{-}$ mode, although we call for more systematic experiments to verify this.

Title: Memory Effects in Contact Line Friction
Authors: Niklas Wolf, Nico van der Vegt
Abstract: When a drop of liquid comes into contact with a solid surface, it relaxes towards an equilibrium configuration, either wetting the surface or remaining in a droplet-like shape with a finite contact angle. The force driving the process towards equilibrium is the corresponding out-of-balance Young's force. However, the speed with which the liquid front advances depends strongly on an opposing friction force arising from dissipative processes due to the moving solid-liquid-gas contact line. In analogy to the treatment of hydrodynamic friction we present an exact method, based on the Mori-Zwanzig formalism, to extract this friction from equilibrium data. We find that the contact line exhibits long-lasting memory with a characteristic power-law decay due to coupling to the systems hydrodynamic modes. Within linear response regime, we obtain the frequency-dependent dissipative and elastic response of the contact line to an external perturbation, including a frequency-dependent friction coefficient. Similar to hydrodynamic friction in liquids, we find that the friction decreases beyond a characteristic frequency and the system exhibits predominantly elastic behavior.

Title: Hund-projected Kanamori model: an effective description of Hund's metals near the Mott insulating regime
Authors: Johan Carlström
Abstract: Hund's coupling plays a decisive role in shaping electron correlations of multi-orbital systems, giving rise to a class of materials--Hund's metals--that combine local-moment physics with metallic transport. Here we derive an effective low-energy description of such a system near the Mott insulating regime, starting from the multi-orbital Hubbard-Kanamori Hamiltonian and projecting onto the high-spin manifold favored by Hund's first rule. The resulting Hund-projected Kanamori model captures the interplay between carrier motion and magnetic correlations in the presence of strong Hund's coupling. In the undoped limit, the model reduces to a spin-$N/2$ Heisenberg system with suppressed quantum fluctuations, approaching the classical limit for realistic five-band configurations. Upon doping, carrier motion couples strongly to the spin background and drives ferromagnetic correlations through a Hund-enhanced kinetic mechanism analogous to, but much stronger than, Nagaoka ferromagnetism. Owing to its reduced sign problem, the model can be addressed with advanced path-integral methods to determine quasiparticle structure and effective interactions between carriers-quantities that are challenging to obtain with other methods. This framework establishes a microscopic bridge between the Kanamori model and the emergent magnetic and transport phenomena characteristic of Hund's metals.

Title: Analytical Interaction Potentials for Disks in Two Dimensions
Authors: Binghan Liu, Junwen Wang, Gary S. Grest, Shengfeng Cheng
Abstract: Compact analytical forms are derived for the interactions involving thin disks in two dimensions using an integration approach. These include interactions between a disk and a material point, between two disks, and between a disk and a wall. Each object is treated as a continuous medium of materials points interacting by the Lennard-Jones 12-6 potential. By integrating this potential in a pairwise manner, expressions for the potentials and resultant forces between extended objects are obtained. All the results are validated with numerical integrations. The analytical potentials are implemented in LAMMPS and used to simulate two-dimensional suspension of disks with an explicit solvent modeled as a Lennard-Jones liquid. In monodisperse disk suspensions, a disorder-to-order transition of disk packing is observed as the area fraction of disks is increased or as the solvent evaporates. In bidisperse disk suspensions being rapidly dried, stratification is found with the smaller disks enriched at the evaporation front. Such "small-on-top" stratification echoes the similar phenomenon occurring in three-dimensional polydisperse colloidal suspensions that undergo fast drying. These potentials can be applied to a wide range of two-dimensional systems involving disk-like objects.

Title: The metastability of lipid vesicle shapes in uniaxial extensional flow
Authors: M.A. Shishkin (1 and 2), E.S. Pikina (1 and 3) ((1) Landau Institute for Theoretical Physics Russia, (2) HSE University Russia, (3) Oil and Gas Research Institute Russia)
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the elastic properties of deflated vesicles and their shape dynamics in uniaxial extensional flow. By analysing the Helfrich bending energy and viscous flow stresses in the limit of highly elongated shapes, we demonstrate that all stationary vesicle configurations are metastable. For vesicles with small reduced volume, we identify the type of bifurcation at which the stationary state is lost, leading to unbounded vesicle elongation in time. We show that the stationary vesicle length remains finite at the critical extension rate. The critical behaviour of the stationary vesicle length and of the growth rates of small perturbations is obtained analytically and confirmed by direct numerical computations. The beginning stage of the unbounded elongation dynamics is simulated numerically, in agreement with the analytical predictions.

Title: A new Fractal Mean-Field analysis in phase transition
Authors: Ismael S. S. Carrasco, Henrique A. de Lima, Fernando A. Oliveira
Abstract: Understanding phase transitions requires not only identifying order parameters but also characterizing how their correlations behave across scales. By quantifying how fluctuations at distinct spatial or temporal points are related, correlation functions reveal the structural organization of complex systems. Here, we revisit the theoretical foundations of these correlations in systems undergoing second-order phase transitions, with emphasis on the Ising model extended to non-integer spatial dimensions. Starting from the classical framework introduced by Fisher, we discuss how the standard Euclidean treatment, restricted to integer dimensions, necessitates the introduction of the critical exponent $\eta$ to capture the spatial decay of correlations at $T=T_c$. We suppose that, at criticality, the equilibrium dynamics become effectively confined to the fractal edge of spin clusters. Within this framework, the fractal dimension that governs the correlations in that subspace is directly related to Fisher exponent, which quantifies the singular behavior of the correlation function near criticality. Importantly, this correlation fractal dimension is distinct from the fractal dimension associated with the order parameter. We further derive an explicit geometrical relation connecting the two fractal dimensions, thereby linking spatial self-similarity to the observed scaling behavior at criticality. This treatment naturally extends to non-integer spatial dimensions, which remain valid below the upper critical dimension and produce the correct value of Fisher exponent $\eta$ for a continuous space dimension. Our analysis also confirms that the Rushbrooke scaling relation, continues to hold when the spatial dimension is treated as a continuous parameter, reinforcing the universality of critical scaling and underscoring the role of fractal geometry in characterizing correlations at criticality.

Title: Defect Bootstrap: Tight Ground State Bounds in Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking Phases
Authors: Michael G. Scheer, Nisarg Chadha, Da-Chuan Lu, Eslam Khalaf
Abstract: The recent development of bootstrap methods based on semidefinite relaxations of positivity constraints has enabled rigorous two-sided bounds on local observables directly in the thermodynamic limit. However, these bounds inevitably become loose in symmetry broken phases, where local constraints are insufficient to capture long-range order. In this work, we identify the origin of this looseness as order parameter defects which are difficult to remove using local operators. We introduce a $\textit{defect bootstrap}$ framework that resolves this limitation by embedding the system into an auxiliary $\textit{defect model}$ equipped with ancilla degrees of freedom. This construction effectively enables local operators to remove order parameter defects, yielding tighter bounds in phases with spontaneous symmetry breaking. This approach can be applied broadly to pairwise-interacting local lattice models with discrete or continuous internal symmetries that satisfy a property we call $\textit{defect diamagnetism}$, which requires that the ground state energy does not decrease upon adding any finite number of symmetry defects. Applying the method to the transverse field Ising models in 1D and 2D, we obtain significantly improved bounds on energy densities and spin correlation functions throughout the symmetry broken phase in 1D and deep within the phase in 2D. Our results demonstrate that physically motivated constraint sets can dramatically enhance the power of bootstrap methods for quantum many-body systems.

Title: Cr2O3/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 Heterojunction Diodes with Orientation-Dependent Breakdown Electric Field up to 12.9 MV/cm
Authors: Yizheng Liu, Haochen Wang, Carl Peterson, James S. Speck, Chris Van De Walle, Sriram Krishnamoorthy
Abstract: We report the fabrication of Cr2O3/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 heterojunction diodes using reactive magnetron sputtering of Cr2O3 on highly doped \b{eta}-Ga2O3 bulk substrates along (100), (010), (001), (110), and (011) orientation dependence of high electric field handling capability in \b{eta}-Ga2O3. Additional relative permittivity values in (110) and (011) orientations of \b{eta}-Ga2O3 were computed by using first-principles calculation methods for accurate apparent charge density (ND-NA) extraction and breakdown electric field analysis from capacitance-voltage measurements. The HJDs fabricated on n+ (110) exhibited breakdown electric fields >10 MV/cm up to 12.9 MV/cm, showing the highest experimentally observed parallel-plane junction electric field among \b{eta}-Ga2O3-based junctions. Breakdown electric fields among (100), (010), (001), and (011) orientations showed distinct distribution in the range of 5.13-5.26 MV/cm, 5.10-7.05 MV/cm, 2.70-3.33 MV/cm, and 3.88-4.38 MV/cm, respectively, validating the orientational dependence of parallel-plane junction electric field at breakdown in low-symmetry monoclinic \b{eta}-Ga2O3. The parallel-plane breakdown electric fields (EBr,||) reported in this work were extracted when the device experienced catastrophic breakdown at 100 mA/cm^2 current density compliance, and should not be confused with critical electric field (Ec) as a function of drift layer doping concentration, which accounts for electric-field dependent impact ionization coefficients in Si, SiC and GaN. This study can guide the choice of crystal orientation for high performance gallium oxide-based devices that require high electric field handling capability.

Title: Photo-induced carrier dynamics in InSb probed with broadband THz spectroscopy based on BNA crystals
Authors: Elodie Iglesis, Alexandr Alekhin, Maximilien Cazayous, Alain Sacuto, Yann Gallais, Sarah Houver
Abstract: We report an optical pump - terahertz (THz) probe study of the photoinduced transient carrier dynamics in the low bandgap semiconductor Indium Antimonide (InSb). Using an organic N-benzyl-2-methyl-nitroaniline (BNA) crystal as a broadband THz source, we access the full spectral response over more than 5 THz, for varying pump-probe delay following the optical excitation. Using the Drude-Lorentz model accounting for differences between the excited length in material and the penetration depth of THz beam in pumped InSb, we extract the absolute carrier density as a function of the pump-probe delay, and provide insights on the diffusion length at given carrier densities, for different pump fluences. The mismatch between the THz penetration depth and the actual excited sample depth after carrier diffusion is discussed, since their evolutions with time and pump fluence are not intuitive as both quantities depend on carrier density.

Title: Hardware Acceleration of Frustrated Lattice Systems using Convolutional Restricted Boltzmann Machine
Authors: Pratik Brahma, Junghoon Han, Tamzid Razzaque, Saavan Patel, Sayeef Salahuddin
Abstract: Geometric frustration gives rise to emergent quantum phenomena and exotic phases of matter. While Monte Carlo methods are traditionally used to simulate such systems, their sampling efficiency is limited by the complexity of interactions and ground-state properties. Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), a class of probabilistic neural networks, offer improved sampling by incorporating machine learning techniques. However, fully-connected bipartite RBMs are inefficient for representing physical lattices with sparse interactions. To address this, we implement Convolutional Restricted Boltzmann Machines (CRBMs) that leverage translational symmetry inherent to lattices. Using the classical Shastry-Sutherland (SS) Ising lattice, we demonstrate (i) CRBM formulation that captures SS interactions, and (ii) digital hardware accelerator to enhance sampling performance. We simulate lattices with up to 324 spins, recovering all known phases of the SS Ising model, including the long range ordered fractional plateau. Our hardware characterizes spin behavior at critical points and within spin liquid phases. This implementation achieves a speedup of 3 to 5 orders of magnitude (33 ns to 120 ms) over GPU-based implementations. Moreover, the time-to-solution is within two orders of magnitude of quantum annealers, while offering superior scalability, room-temperature operation and reprogrammability. This work paves a pathway for scalable digital hardware that embeds physical symmetries to enable large scale simulations of material systems.

Title: Optical contrast-based determination of number of layers for two-dimensional van der Waals magnet Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$
Authors: Neesha Yadav, Sandeep, Pintu Das
Abstract: Recent advances in revealing intrinsic magnetism in two-dimensional (2D) materials have highlighted their potential for future spintronic applications, driven by their novel physical properties, promising for future spintronic devices. In order to explore layer dependent magnetic behavior, in general, mechanically exfoliated flakes from high-quality single crystals are used. It is crucial to determine the number of layers of these materials accurately. In the absence of an efficient and quick method, researchers often rely on atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging to identify their number of layers. In this work, we report an optical contrast study as a quick and cost-effective technique to determine the number of layers of Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ (FGT). Here, we observed a linear relationship between the optical contrast (derived from optical microscopic images) observed for mechanically exfoliated FGT nano-flakes and their thickness, as measured by the AFM imaging method. This technique requires no additional equipment; it relies solely on a conventional optical microscope. Additionally, our results reveal a thickness-dependent evolution of the intensity; in contrast, the Raman frequency demonstrates no significant dependence on layer thickness. Also, our studies reveal two additional Raman modes of FGT, at the frequency of 129\,cm$^-1$ \& 190\,cm$^-1$. Both modes show the intensity dependence on the thickness of FGT, same as out-of-plane (A$_{1g}$) Raman modes.

Title: Exploring the Anomalous Nernst Effect in SrRuO$_3$
Authors: Anna Merin Francis, Avirup De, Abhijit Biswas, Lily Mandal, Pallavi Kushwaha, Sunil Nair
Abstract: We investigate the anomalous Nernst effect in epitaxial SrRuO$_3$ thin films grown on c-cut Al$_2$O$_3$ substrates, and in a polycrystalline SrRuO$_3$ slab. Through comprehensive measurements of the transverse thermoelectric response as a function of temperature and magnetic field, we observe a pronounced Nernst signal near $T_c$ in the (111) oriented SrRuO$_3$ thin films. The strong temperature and nontrivial field dependence underscore the pivotal role of the magnetic anisotropy in tuning the Berry curvature and, consequently, the anomalous Nernst effect in SrRuO$_3$.

Title: Hierarchical high-throughput screening of alkaline-stable lithium-ion conductors combining machine learning and first-principles calculations
Authors: Zhuohan Li, KyuJung Jun, Bowen Deng, Gerbrand Ceder
Abstract: The advancement of solid-state batteries depends on the development of lithium-ion conductors that exhibit both high ionic conductivity and stability across a wide range of electrochemical and chemical conditions. In this paper, we investigate the chemical factors that control the stability of Li-NASICONs and garnets in highly alkaline aqueous environment. While this is of general importance, it is particularly important for the operation of Li-air cells with humidified air. Humid air promotes the formation of LiOH as the discharge product, creating a highly alkaline environment on the surface of cathode and solid-state electrolyte. In this work, we combine machine learning and first-principles calculations to conduct a high-throughput computational screening of alkaline-stable oxide-based Li-ion conductors in order to better characterize the tradeoff between the various relevant properties. We evaluate the material stability in terms of pH, voltage, and species present in the environment (LiOH and H2O) across a vast range of chemical compositions with NASICON and garnet crystal structures. We utilize the CHGNet universal machine learning interatomic potential for pre-screening, followed by DFT calculations. Such a hierarchical screening procedure enables the evaluation of over 320,000 chemical compositions, encompassing nearly the entire periodic table. From this set 209 alkaline-stable NASICON and garnet compounds are selected as final candidates. We identify the specific cation substitutions that improve alkaline stability in NASICON and garnet compounds, and reveal the underlying mechanism. We also discover the trade-offs for designing alkaline-stable Li-ion conductors, highlighting the need to carefully optimize compositions so that it can simultaneously enhance all the material properties required for practical battery applications.

Title: Anisotropic scale invariance and the uniaxial Lifshitz point from the nonperturbative renormalization group
Authors: Gonzalo De Polsi, Pawel Jakubczyk
Abstract: We employ the derivative expansion of the nonperturbative renormalization group to address the phenomenon of anisotropic scale invariance and the associated functional fixed points, also known as Lifshitz points, in systems characterized by a scalar order parameter. We demonstrate the existence of the Lifshitz fixed point featuring a non-classical value of the anisotropy exponent $\theta<1/2$ and provide estimates for values of a set of critical exponents in the physically most relevant case of the three-dimensional uniaxial Lifshitz point $(d,m)=(3,1)$, $m$ denoting the anisotropy index. We compare our predictions with existing estimates from perturbative expansions around dimensionality $d=4+\frac{1}{2}$ as well as those from the $1/N$ expansion.

Title: Ion Jump Motion as the Background for Muon Diffusion in Battery Materials Research Using $μ$SR
Authors: Ryosuke Kadono
Abstract: It is shown by numerical simulations of muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) spectra and analysis of these using the Kubo-Toyabe relaxation function $G_z^{\rm KT}(t)$ that the anomalous peak in the fluctuation rate $\nu_{\rm KT}$ around a specific temperature $T^*$ and associated decrease of the linewidth $\Delta_{\rm KT}$ above $T^*$, often observed in the previous $\mu$SR studies on ion diffusion, originate from the sharp increase in the ion jump rate $\nu_{\rm i}$ against that of the muon $\nu_\mu$ with increasing temperature. This indicates that a more detailed reanalysis of the vintage data using the "extended" Kubo-Toyabe relaxation function $G_z^{\rm EA}(t)$ incorporating the jump motion of both ions and implanted muon (which was also used to simulate the $\mu$SR spectra) is useful for the proper evaluation of $\nu_{\rm i}$ and $\nu_\mu$. Meanwhile, it also suggests that the $\mu$SR results showing no such anomaly convey little information on ion diffusion.

Title: Self-avoiding walks pulled at an angle
Authors: C J Bradly, N R Beaton, A L Owczarek
Abstract: We investigate polymers pulled away from an interacting surface, where the force is applied to the untethered endpoint and at an angle $\theta$ to the surface. We use the canonical self-avoiding walk model of polymers and obtain the phase diagram of the model using Monte Carlo simulations for a range of angles, temperatures and force magnitudes. The phase diagram of the model displays re-entrance at low temperatures for three-dimensional walks when the pulling is more vertical than horizontal. Our results agree with various exactly solvable lattice models that have been previously studied.

Title: Probing magnetic-field-induced multipolar ordering through field-angle-resolved magnetostriction and thermal expansion in PrIr$_2$Zn$_{20}$
Authors: Naoki Okamoto, Yohei Kono, Takahiro Onimaru, Keisuke T. Matsumoto, Kazumasa Hattori, Shunichiro Kittaka
Abstract: We performed field-angle-resolved magnetostriction and thermal-expansion measurements on PrIr$_2$Zn$_{20}$, a cubic non-Kramers compound exhibiting antiferroquadrupolar order below $T_{\rm Q}=0.125$ K. Thermal expansion exhibits two qualitatively different anomalies under magnetic fields applied along the $[001]$ direction, providing experimental support for the existence of an intermediate A phase previously reported. Furthermore, comparison between the experimental results and theoretical modeling indicates a strong anisotropic coupling of the $O_{20}$ quadrupolar moment, which plays a key role in stabilizing the A phase. These findings demonstrate that multipolar states in non-Kramers systems can be effectively tuned by magnetic-field orientation, providing insights into the anisotropic nature of quadrupolar interactions.

Title: Edge-state transport in gapped bilayer graphene
Authors: Jesús Arturo Sánchez-Sánchez, Thomas Stegmann
Abstract: We investigate electronic transport in gapped bilayer graphene (gBLG) devices. For certain edge terminations -typically a combination of zigzag, armchair, and bearded types - we observe edge state conduction within the band gap, which is opened by a potential bias between the two layers. The edge states can generate a non-local resistance, in line with recent experiments [1]. Band structure calculations of gBLG nanoribbons corroborate the existence of the edge states, whose edge localization can be switched by tuning the electron energy. Their existence strongly depends on the edge termination and does not originate from a topological bulk-boundary correspondence.

Title: Non-uniform Thermal Conductivity in Nanoscale Multiple Hotspot Systems
Authors: Yu He, Zhihao Zhou, Lina Yang, Nuo Yang
Abstract: Understanding nanoscale hotspot thermal transport is crucial in electronic devices. Contrary to common perception, recent experiments show that closely spaced nanoscale multiple hotspots can enhance heat dissipation. Here, the thermal transport in nanoscale multiple hotspot systems is investigated by solving the phonon Boltzmann transport equation. The local thermal conductivity is proposed to describe the non-uniform spatial distribution of heat transport capability in nanoscale multiple hotspot systems. The maximum value exceeds the uniform heating case by up to 27%, which is attributed to the spatially varying fraction of unscattered phonons emitted from hotspots. Moreover, the effects and mechanisms of hotspot spacing on thermal transport are investigated, showing that reducing the hotspot spacing can enhance the heat flux by up to 40%. This work challenges the conventional view that thermal transport capability is spatially uniform throughout the system and provides fundamental insights for thermal management in high-power-density integrated circuits.

Title: Relation between extensional viscosity and polymer conformation in dilute polymer solutions
Authors: Yusuke Koide, Takato Ishida, Takashi Uneyama, Yuichi Masubuchi
Abstract: We investigate extensional viscosity and polymer conformation in dilute polymer solutions under uniaxial extensional flow using dissipative particle dynamics simulations. At high extension rates, polymers are significantly stretched by extensional flows, and the extensional viscosity growth function exhibits strain hardening. To reveal their quantitative relation, we adopt an analysis method based on the Rouse-type model. We demonstrate that the extensional viscosity growth function is determined by the instantaneous gyration radii in the parallel and perpendicular directions to the extensional direction and their time derivatives. Our approach also provides a unified description of the steady-state extensional viscosity of dilute polymer solutions for various chain lengths and concentrations in terms of the polymer gyration radius.

Title: Local Geometric and Transport Properties of Networks that are Generated from Hyperuniform Point Patterns
Authors: James V. Raj, Xiaohan Sun, Charles Emmett Maher, Katherine A. Newhall, Mason A. Porter
Abstract: Hyperuniformity, which is a type of long-range order that is characterized by the suppression of long-range density fluctuations in comparison to the fluctuations in standard disordered systems, has emerged as a powerful concept to aid in the understanding of diverse natural and engineered phenomena. In the present paper, we harness hyperuniform point patterns to generate a class of disordered, spatially embedded networks that are distinct from both perfectly ordered lattices and uniformly random geometric graphs. We refer to these networks as \emph{hyperuniform-point-pattern-induced (HuPPI) networks}, and we compare them to their counterpart \emph{Poisson-point-pattern-induced (PoPPI) networks}. By computing the local geometric and transport properties of HuPPI networks, we demonstrate how hyperuniformity imparts advantages in both transport efficiency and robustness. Specifically, we show that HuPPI networks have systematically smaller total effective resistances, slightly faster random-walk mixing times, and fewer extreme-curvature edges than PoPPI networks. Counterintuitively, we also find that HuPPI networks simultaneously have more negative mean Ollivier--Ricci curvatures and smaller global resistances than PoPPI networks, indicating that edges with moderately negative curvatures need not create severe bottlenecks to transport. We also demonstrate that the network-generation method strongly influences these properties and in particular that it often overshadows differences that arise from underlying point patterns. These results collectively demonstrate potential advantages of hyperuniformity in network design and motivate further theoretical and experimental exploration of HuPPI networks.

Title: From Static Pathways to Dynamic Mechanisms: A Committor-Based Data-Driven Approach to Chemical Reactions
Authors: Radu A. Talmazan, Christophe Chipot
Abstract: As computational chemistry methods evolve, dynamic effects have been increasingly recognized to govern chemical reaction pathways in both organic and inorganic systems. Here, we introduce a committor-based workflow that integrates a path-committor-consistent artificial neural network (PCCANN) with an iteratively trained hybrid-DFT-level message passing atomic convolutional encoder (MACE) potential. Beginning with a static nudged elastic band path, PCCANN extracts a committor-consistent string to represent the reactive ensemble. We illustrate the power of this methodology through two representative applications. First, we investigate an SNAr reaction using MACE trained at hybrid DFT level with implicit solvent. The mechanism is found to be concerted, and the dynamic approach reveals a lower barrier than static treatments. Second, we apply the same protocol to the isomerization of protonated isobutanol to protonated 2-butanol, yielding a quantitatively accurate free-energy landscape. We uncover three competing channels: the established concerted mechanism and two asynchronous stepwise routes mediated by water and methyl transfer, all with comparable activation barriers. Notably, the stepwise pathways traverse metastable intermediates that, to the best of our knowledge, have not been described in prior mechanistic studies. Calculated barrier heights and intermediate stabilities are in close agreement with high-level DFT benchmarks, demonstrating the framework's accuracy. Together, these studies highlight mechanistic diversity across distinct systems and establish the synergistic PCCANN-MACE protocol as a proof-of-concept approach for committor-based discovery of complex reaction dynamics.

Title: Accelerated Discovery of Crystalline Materials with Record Ultralow Lattice Thermal Conductivity via a Universal Descriptor
Authors: Xingchen Shen, Jiongzhi Zheng, Michael Marek Koza, Petr Levinsky, Jiri Hejtmanek, Philippe Boullay, Bernard Raveau, Jinghui Wang, Jun Li, Pierric Lemoine, Christophe Candolfi, Emmanuel Guilmeau
Abstract: Ultralow glass-like lattice thermal conductivity in crystalline materials is crucial for enhancing energy conversion efficiency in thermoelectrics and thermal insulators. We introduce a universal descriptor for thermal conductivity that relies only on the atomic number in the primitive cell and the sound velocity, enabling fast and scalable materials screening. Coupled with high-throughput workflows and universal machine learning potentials, we identify the candidate materials with ultralow thermal conductivity from over 25, 000 materials. We further validate this approach by experimentally confirming record-low thermal conductivity values of 0.15-0.16 W/m/K from 170 to 400 K in the halide metal CsAg2I3. Combining inelastic neutron scattering with first-principles calculations, we attribute the ultralow thermal conductivity to the intrinsically small sound velocity, strong anharmonicity, and structural complexity. Our work illustrates how a universal descriptor, combined with high-throughput screening, machine-learning potential and experiment, enables the efficient discovery of materials with ultralow thermal conductivity.

Title: Giant critical current peak induced by pressure in kagome superconductor RbV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$

Abstract: Superconductivity can coexist or compete with other orders such as magnetism or density waves. Optimizing superconductivity requires identifying competing orders that may disrupt Cooper pair coherence. Here, we use the self-field critical current ($I_{\rm c,sf}$) to probe pressure-tuned superconductivity in the kagome superconductor RbV$_3$Sb$_5$. As pressure destabilizes the charge-density wave (CDW) state, $I_{\rm c,sf}$ drastically enhances, peaking near the critical pressure where the CDW state is completely suppressed at zero temperature. Surprisingly, a weaker $I_{\rm c,sf}$ peak emerges within the CDW phase. Near the pressure of the weaker peak, the superconducting phase transition temperature shifts from an increasing trend with pressure to a near plateau. Our analysis suggests the possibility of a sudden change in the CDW pattern or a Lifshitz transition, highlighting the need for microscopic examinations of the CDW state for understanding the pressure evolution of superconductivity in RbV$_3$Sb$_5$.

Title: Lattice-to-total thermal conductivity ratio: a phonon-glass electron-crystal descriptor for data-driven thermoelectric design
Authors: Yifan Sun, Zhi Li, Tetsuya Imamura, Yuji Ohishi, Chris Wolverton, Ken Kurosaki
Abstract: Thermoelectrics (TEs) are promising candidates for energy harvesting with performance quantified by figure of merit, $ZT$. To accelerate the discovery of high-$ZT$ materials, efforts have focused on identifying compounds with low thermal conductivity $\kappa$. Using a curated dataset of 71,913 entries, we show that high-$ZT$ materials reside not only in the low-$\kappa$ regime but also cluster near a lattice-to-total thermal conductivity ratio ($\kappa_\mathrm{L}/\kappa$) of approximately 0.5, consistent with the phonon-glass electron-crystal design concept. Building on this insight, we construct a framework consisting of two machine learning models for the lattice and electronic components of thermal conductivity that jointly provide both $\kappa$ and $\kappa_\mathrm{L}/\kappa$ for screening and guiding the optimization of TE materials. Among 104,567 compounds screened, our models identify 2,522 ultralow-$\kappa$ candidates. Follow-up case studies demonstrate that this framework can reliably provide optimization strategies by suggesting new dopants and alloys that shift pristine materials toward the $\kappa_\mathrm{L}/\kappa$ approaching 0.5 regime. Ultimately, by integrating rapid screening with PGEC-guided optimization, our data-driven framework effectively bridges the critical gap between materials discovery and performance enhancement.

Title: Nucleation and wetting transitions in three-component Bose-Einstein condensates in Gross-Pitaevskii theory: exact results
Authors: Jonas Berx, Nguyen Van Thu, Joseph O. Indekeu
Abstract: Nucleation and wetting transitions are studied in a three-component Bose-Einstein condensate mixture within Gross-Pitaevskii theory. For special cases of intermediate segregation between components 1 and 2, the nucleation phase transition of a surfactant film of component 3 is obtained by exact solution. Additional exact results for the nucleation transition are derived in the limit of strong segregation between components 1 and 2. In this limit the exact first-order wetting phase boundary is obtained using analytical and numerical methods, and is contrasted with the exact nucleation and wetting phase boundary derived previously for a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate mixture at a hard optical wall. Exact results for the three-component mixture are compared with results from the double-parabola approximation used in an earlier work.

Title: Mechanisms of Resistive Switching in 2D Monolayer and Multilayer Materials
Authors: M. Kaniselvan, Y. R. Jeon, M. Mladenović, M. Luisier, D. Akinwande
Abstract: The power and energy consumption of resistive switching devices can be lowered by reducing their active layer dimensions. Efforts to push this low-energy switching property to its limits have led to the investigation of active regions made with two-dimensional layered materials (2DLM). Despite their small dimensions, 2DLM exhibit a rich variety of switching mechanisms, each involving different types of atomic structure reconfigurations. In this review, we highlight and classify the mechanisms of resistive switching in mono and bulk 2DLM, with a subsequent focus on those occurring in a monolayer and/or localized to point defects in the crystalline sheet. We discuss the complex energetics involved in these fundamentally defect-assisted processes, including the co-existence of multiple mechanisms and influence of the contacts used. Examining the highly localized 'atomristor'-type switching, we provide insights into the atomic motions and electronic transport across the metal-2D interfaces underlying their operation. Finally, we present the progress and our perspective on the challenges associated with the development of 2D resistive switching devices. Promising application areas and material systems are identified and suggested for further research.

Title: Coupled Structural and Electronic Requirements in Alpha-FASnI3 Imposed by the Sn(II) Lone Pair
Authors: Mridhula Venkatanarayanan, Vladislav Slama, Madhubanti Mukherjee, Andrea Vezzosi, Ursula Rothlisberger, Virginia Carnevali
Abstract: Alpha-Formamidinium-tin-iodide (alpha-FASnI3) is a leading candidate for lead-free photovoltaic applications, adopting a nearly cubic structure at room temperature, but its stability remains limited by oxidation-driven degradation. Reliable first-principles modelling of the photovoltaic alpha-phase is further complicated by inconsistent structural models and levels of theory in the literature. Here, we identify the structural and electronic requirements needed for a physically sound description of alpha-FASnI3, whose behaviour is governed by a pseudo-Jahn-Teller (PJT) instability arising from the stereochemically active Sn(II) lone pair. Using 0 K relaxations, cross-code hybrid-functional benchmarks, and finite-temperature ab initio molecular dynamics, we show that a 4x4x4 supercell with randomly oriented FA+ cations is the smallest model that removes macroscopic dipoles, preserves cubic symmetry, recovers local octahedral tilts, and captures the characteristic PJT-driven Sn off-centering. Accurate band edges and a reliable band gap require a PBE0-level hybrid functional with spin-orbit coupling to treat Sn relativistic effects, together with nonlocal dispersion (rVV10) to capture the enhanced Sn-I covalency. Finite-temperature simulations reveal that Sn off-centering remains local, <111>-oriented, and robust against thermal fluctuations, and that reproducing the experimental 300 K band gap requires a 6x6x6 supercell. These results define the essential ingredients for reliable modelling of alpha-FASnI3 and provide a rigorous foundation for studying lone-pair-driven physics in tin halide perovskites.

Title: Active Learning Driven Materials Discovery for Low Thermal Conductivity Rare-Earth Pyrochlore for Thermal Barrier Coatings
Authors: Amiya Chowdhury, Acacio Rincon Romero, Grazziela Figueredo, Tanvir Hussain
Abstract: High-Entropy/multicomponent rare-earth oxides (HECs and MCCs) show promise as alternative materials for thermal barrier coatings (TBC) with the ability to tailor properties based on the combination of rare-earth elements present. By enabling the substitution of scarce or supply-risk rare-earths with more readily available alternatives while maintaining comparable material performance, HECs and MCCs offer a valuable path towards alternative TBC material design. However, navigating this search space of compositionally complex materials is both time and resource intensive. In this study, an active learning (AL) framework was employed to identify HEC/MCC materials with a pyrochlore structure, with acceptable thermal conductivity (TC) for TBC applications. The AL framework was applied through a Bayesian optimisation (BO) strategy, coupled with a random forest surrogate model. TC was selected as the optimisation criterion as that is the most basic requirement of TBC materials. Over two iterations of the AL cycle, four compositions were generated and synthesized in the lab for experimental evaluation. The first iteration yielded two single-phase pyrochlores, $(La_{0.29}Nd_{0.36}Gd_{0.36})_2Zr_2O_7$ and $(La_{0.333}Nd_{0.26}Gd_{0.15}Ho_{0.15}Yb_{0.111})_2Zr_2O_7$, with measured thermal conductivities of 2.03 and 1.90 $W/mK$, respectively. The surrogate model predicted a TC of 2.009 $W/mK$ for both compositions, demonstrating it's accuracy for completely new compositions. The second iteration compositions showed dual-phase when synthesized, highlighting the need to take into account phase formation in the AL framework.

Title: Discovery and recovery of crystalline materials with property-conditioned transformers
Authors: Cyprien Bone, Matthew Walker, Kuangdai Leng, Luis M. Antunes, Ricardo Grau-Crespo, Amil Aligayev, Javier Dominguez, Keith T. Butler
Abstract: Generative models have recently shown great promise for accelerating the design and discovery of new functional materials. Conditional generation enhances this capacity by allowing inverse design, where specific desired properties can be requested during the generation process. However, conditioning of transformer-based approaches, in particular, is constrained by discrete tokenisation schemes and the risk of catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning. This work introduces CrystaLLM-{\pi} (property injection), a conditional autoregressive framework that integrates continuous property representations directly into the transformer's attention mechanism. Two architectures, Property-Key-Value (PKV) Prefix attention and PKV Residual attention, are presented. These methods bypass inefficient sequence-level tokenisation and preserve foundational knowledge from unsupervised pre-training on Crystallographic Information Files (CIFs) as textual input. We establish the efficacy of these mechanisms through systematic robustness studies and evaluate the framework's versatility across two distinct tasks. First, for structure recovery, the model processes high-dimensional, heterogeneous X-ray diffraction patterns, achieving structural accuracy competitive with specialised models and demonstrating applications to experimental structure recovery and polymorph differentiation. Second, for materials discovery, the model is fine-tuned on a specialised photovoltaic dataset to generate novel, stable candidates validated by Density Functional Theory (DFT). It implicitly learns to target optimal band gap regions for high photovoltaic efficiency, demonstrating a capability to map complex structure-property relationships. CrystaLLM-{\pi} provides a unified, flexible, and computationally efficient framework for inverse materials design.

Title: Unveiling Micrometer-Range Spin-Wave Transport in Artificial Spin Ice
Authors: Syamlal Sankaran Kunnath, Mateusz Zelent, Pawel Gruszecki, Maciej Krawczyk
Abstract: Artificial spin ice (ASI) systems exhibit fascinating phenomena, such as frustration and the formation of magnetic monopole states, and Dirac strings. However, exploring the wave phenomena in these systems is elusive due to the weak dipolar coupling that governs their interactions. In this study, we demonstrate coherent spin-wave propagation in an hybrid ASI system, which is based on a multilayered ferromagnetic thin film with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and in-plane magnetized nanoelements embedded within it. We show that this system enables spin-wave transmission over a one-micrometer distance via exchange-mediated coupling between subsystems and evanescent spin-wave tunneling through the out-of-plane magnetized parts. This system overcomes the limitations of purely dipolar interactions in standard ASIs while preserving their fundamental properties. Thus, it provides a platform for studying spin-wave phenomena in frustrated ASI systems and paves the way for exploiting them in analog signal processing with spin waves.

Title: Stabilization of Tetragonal Phase and Aluminum-Doping Effect in a Bilayer Nickelate
Authors: Jia-Yi Lu, Yi-Qiang Lin, Kai-Xin Ye, Xin-Yu Zhao, Jia-Xin Li, Ya-Nan Zhang, Hao Li, Bai-Jiang Lv, Hui-Qiu Yuan, Guang-Han Cao
Abstract: Recent studies suggest that the tetragonal phase of the Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) bilayer nickelate, La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ or La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_7$, which is stabilized under high pressures, is responsible for high-temperature superconductivity (HTSC). In this context, realization of the tetragonal phase at ambient pressure could be a rational step to achieve the goal of ambient-pressure HTSC in the nickelate system. By employing the concept of Goldschmidt tolerance factor, we succeed in stabilizing the tetragonal phase by aluminum doping together with post annealing under moderately high oxygen pressure. X-ray and neutron diffractions verify the tetragonal $I4/mmm$ structure for the post-annealed samples La$_3$Ni$_{2-x}$Al$_x$O$_{7-\delta}$ (0.3 $\leq x \leq$ 0.5). The Al-doped samples, including the tetragonal ones, show semiconducting properties, carry localized magnetic moments, and exhibit spin-glass-like behaviors at low temperatures, all of which can be explained in terms of charge carrier localization. Furthermore, high-pressure resistance measurements on post-annealed samples reveal that even a low Al doping ($x$ = 0.05) suppresses superconductivity almost completely. This work gives information about the effect of nonmagnetic impurity on metallicity as well as superconductivity in bilayer nickelates, which would contribute to understanding the superconducting mechanism in RP nickelates.

Title: Helical Quasiperiodic Chains with Engineered Dissipation: Liouvillian Rapidity Diagnostics of Transport and Localization
Authors: Mohammad Pouranvari
Abstract: We study relaxation spectra of a quadratic spinless--fermion helical chain with an Aubry--Andre--type quasiperiodic potential and a single N--th neighbor (helical) hopping. Dissipation and pumping are introduced via local linear Lindblad jump operators and treated exactly using the third--quantization / Majorana covariance formalism. Focusing on periodic boundary conditions (to avoid edge artefacts) we compute the Liouvillian rapidities and their smallest nonzero real part (the rapidity gap) for several spatial dissipation patterns: uniform (all), single--site (one--site) and two--site (two--site) placement, plus pairwise gain/loss on helical partner sites. We show that uniform dissipation yields large, weakly lambda--dependent gaps, while sparse local dissipation produces gaps that shrink rapidly as the quasiperiodic potential lambda induces localization. Increasing t_N enhances relaxation by improving mode overlap with dissipative channels. Finite--size scaling, rapidity level statistics (Poisson vs Wigner--Dyson), and spatial profiles of slow modes provide a consistent picture linking Liouvillian spectral structure to transport and localization. Our results highlight Liouvillian rapidities as compact, experimentally relevant diagnostics of relaxation and sensitivity in engineered open quantum lattices.

Title: Spatiotemporal Control of Charge +1 Topological Defects in Polar Active Matter
Authors: Birte C. Geerds, Abhinav Singh, Mathieu Dedenon, Daniel J. G. Pearce, Frank Jülicher, Ivo F. Sbalzarini, Karsten Kruse
Abstract: Topological defects are a conspicuous feature of active liquid crystals that have been associated with important morphogenetic transitions in organismal development. Robust development thus requires a tight control of the motion and placement of topological defects. In this manuscript, we study a mechanism to control +1 topological defects in an active polar fluid confined to a disk. If activity is localized in an annulus within the disk, the defect moves on a circular trajectory around the center of the disk. Using an ansatz for the polar field, we determine the dependence of the angular speed and the circle radius on the boundary orientation of the polar field and the active annulus. Using a proportional integral controller, we guide the defect along complex trajectories by changing the active annulus size and the boundary orientation.

Title: Large longitudinal and anomalous transverse Magneto-thermoelectric effect in kagome antiferromagnet FeGe

Abstract: Topological Kagome magnets, characterized by nontrivial electronic band structures featuring flat band, Dirac cone and van Hove singularities, provide a new avenue for the realization of thermoelectric devices. Unlike the conventional longitudinal Seebeck effect, transverse thermoelectric (TE) effects like the Nernst effect have attracted growing interest due to their unique transverse geometry and potential advantages. Here, we report the observation of a significant transverse thermoelectric conductivity alpha A_zx of 15 A K-1m-1 at low temperatures, together with a pronounced anomalous Nernst effect in the Kagome antiferromagnet FeGe, which exhibits a charge density wave inside the antiferromagnetic (AFM) state. This value is the highest record among known AFM materials. Furthermore, the thermopower at 14 T increases by 102-104% around the canted-AFM (CAFM) transition temperature, Tcant, comparable to that of the well-known AFM thermoelectric materials. These effects are attributed to large Berry curvature arising from the non-collinear spin texture in FeGe, highlighting its potential for enhancing thermoelectric performance and its candidacy for magneto-TE applications in Kagome antiferromagnetic materials.

Title: The 2/3 Rule of Glass Physics Implies Universalities in Crystal Melting
Authors: Peter Lunkenheimer, Konrad Samwer, Alois Loidl
Abstract: Since more than 100 years, melting is thought to be governed by the Lindemann criterion. It assumes that a crystal melts when, upon heating, the growing atomic vibration amplitudes become sufficiently large to destabilize its crystalline lattice. However, it is unclear why the viscosities eta or the related relaxation times tau of the resulting liquids, measured directly at the melting point Tm, differ by up to nine decades, depending on the material. Based on the empirical rule that the ratio of the glass-transition temperature and Tm is about 2/3, here we show that this strong variation is due to differences in the liquid's fragilities, a property associated with pronounced non-Arrhenius behavior and often ascribed to cooperative motions. We propose that, without cooperativity, all crystals would melt into liquids with a universal viscosity value and relaxation time. Hence, the real melting point is only partly determined by the Lindemann criterion and strongly enhanced by the cooperativity of the resulting liquid. Our findings are corroborated by the determination of the idealized, fragility-free melting temperatures, and of the corresponding eta and tau values for various example materials.

Title: Torsion-induced Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in helical magnets
Authors: M.A. Kuznetsov, A.A. Fraerman
Abstract: It has been shown that in magnets possessing an inversion center in the absence of deformations, a torsion-induced Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction (tiDMI) can arise. A microscopic mechanism for this interaction is described, involving the transfer of angular momentum to the lattice upon electron reflection from the magnet's boundary. An estimate of the tiDMI constant is provided. It is demonstrated that tiDMI can lift the chiral degeneracy in helimagnets, and a way for experimentally observing this effect is proposed.

Title: Revealing Fast Ionic Conduction in Solid Electrolytes through Machine Learning Accelerated Raman Calculations
Authors: Manuel Grumet, Takeru Miyagawa, Olivier Pittet, Paolo Pegolo, Karin S. Thalmann, Waldemar Kaiser, David A. Egger
Abstract: Fast ionic conduction is a defining property of solid electrolytes for all-solid-state batteries. Previous studies have suggested that liquid-like cation motion associated with fast ionic transport can disrupt crystalline symmetry, thereby lifting Raman selection rules. Here, we exploit the resulting low-frequency, diffusive Raman scattering as a spectral signature of fast ionic conduction and develop a machine learning-accelerated computational pipeline to identify promising solid electrolytes based on this feature. By overcoming the steep computational barriers to calculating Raman spectra of strongly disordered materials at finite temperatures, we achieve near-ab initio accuracy and demonstrate the predictive power of our approach for sodium-ion conductors, revealing clear Raman signatures of liquid-like ion conduction. This work highlights how machine learning can bridge atomistic simulations and experimental observables, enabling data-efficient discovery of fast-ion conductors.

Title: Controlled nucleation in methylamine-treated perovskite films by artificial seeding and phase-field simulations
Authors: Emilia R. Schütz, Martin Majewski, Olivier J.J. Ronsin, Jens Harting, Lukas Schmidt-Mende
Abstract: Large perovskite crystals with reduced defect density enable superior charge transport and stability. Therefore, controlling their nucleation and growth is key to advancing high-performance optoelectronic devices based on perovskite semiconductors. Millimeter-scale perovskite crystals can be synthesized as a continuous film through methylamine treatment, with nucleation sites directed by pre-patterned seeds. Nonetheless, certain configurations may lead to unwanted parasitic nucleation. To predict and mitigate this effect, we employ phase-field simulations alongside an analytical model. Their predictive capability is demonstrated across three distinct material-substrate systems, enabling precise control over nucleation and subsequent crystal growth. Notably, the only material-specific input required is the nucleation density (i.e., the number of crystals nucleated per unit area on an unpatterned substrate). This generality makes the models broadly applicable to diverse material systems for achieving controlled two-dimensional crystallization for improved optoelectronic device performance.

Title: Lattice-Distortion-Mediated Proton Pairing and Trapping in Solid State Oxides
Authors: Hang Ma, Jiajun Linghu, Nannan Han, Ying Liang, Yiyang Sun, Tianxing Ma, Zhi-Peng Li
Abstract: Experiments have evidenced proton pairing in Y-doped BaZrO3. However, the nature of proton pairing and its impact on conduction remain insufficiently understood theoretically. Here, through quantitative computational analysis of proton-proton interactions in Y-doped BaZrO3, we identify lattice-distortion-mediated elastic interaction as the key factor determining whether two protons form a stable pair or exhibit net repulsion. When a proton resides at an inward-bending distortion site induced by another proton, the resulting net repulsive interaction leads to an unstable configuration. In contrast, the proton tends to be trapped at a nearby outward-bending site that favors the formation of a stable proton pair. Moreover, the site where the two protons form the lowest-energy configuration also corresponds to a proton trapping site. By calculating the long-range diffusion pathways accessible to protons under different local environments in both single- and two-proton cases, we find that the range of rate-limiting barriers is 0.24-0.45 eV for two-proton conduction and 0.19-0.39 eV for single-proton conduction. The higher and more experimentally consistent barriers in the two-proton pathways indicate that the proton trapping effect induced by pairing hinders proton conduction. Our study elucidates the multi-proton diffusion mechanism, providing a theoretical foundation for the experimental design of electrolytes with enhanced proton conductivity.

Title: Size optimization for observeing Majorana fermions
Authors: Guo-Jian Qiao, Zhi-Lei Zhang, Xin Yue, C. P. Sun
Abstract: Majorana fermions (zero modes) are predicted to emerge in nanowire-superconductor heterostructures. This theoretical prediction typically relies on an oversimplified model, where both the nanowire and the superconductor are idealized as one-dimensional systems. In reality, heterostructures have finite sizes that deviate from this idealization-and as a result, smoking-gun evidence confirming the existence of these zero modes remains elusive. Here, we investigate the finite-size effects of both the nanowire and the superconductor, and optimize their sizes to ensure that only one Majorana fermion exists at each end of the heterostructure. It is discovered that the optimal transverse sizes of the nanowire are less than 100nm in width and approximately 1nm in thickness. For the superconductor layer, its optimal thickness (a key aspect of its size) must exceed its coherence length. We also present the optimal sizes of the two types of materials used in the experiment in a quantitative manner. Notably, the identified optimal thickness of the superconductor (Al films, $\sim$1000nm)--a critical size parameter--is two orders of magnitude larger than the thickness of Al films currently utilized in experimental devices (e.g., InSb-Al and InAs-Al heterostructures). Our findings could explain why Majorana fermions have not been observed in current experiments, and offer guidance for the size selection of heterostructures to implement Majorana fermions in future studies.

Title: Dynamics of a tracer trapped in a correlated medium in the presence of a wall
Authors: Marcin Piotr Pruszczyk, Andrea Gambassi
Abstract: We describe the random motion of a particle immersed in a thermally fluctuating medium and harmonically trapped at a certain distance from a wall. The medium, modeled by a Gaussian field with a tunable correlation length $\xi$, is linearly coupled to the particle and evolves according to dissipative relaxational dynamics. Dirichlet boundary conditions imposed on the field at the wall give rise to a repulsive fluctuation-induced force acting on the particle, causing a shift in its average position and a renormalization of the strength of the harmonic trap. We describe the effective overdamped dynamics of the particle, which features a nonlinear memory term depending on the wall-particle separation. We show that the two-time correlation function of the particle position features a memory-induced term that depends on the distance of the particle from the wall. At the critical point, this term decays algebraically upon increasing time and it displays a crossover from the behavior observed in the bulk to that corresponding to having the particle at the wall.

Title: Antiferromagnetism and Kekulé valence bond order in the honeycomb optical Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-Hubbard model
Authors: Sohan Malkaruge Costa, Benjamin Cohen-Stead, Steven Johnston
Abstract: The precise role of e-ph coupling in graphene and related materials on a honeycomb lattice is not yet fully understood, despite extensive research on these systems. Here, we perform sign-problem-free determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) simulations of the optical Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (oSSH)-Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice, focusing on the parameters relevant to graphene. Performing finite-size scaling analyzes, we obtain the model's ground state phase diagram, which includes the semi-metal (SM), Kekulé Valence Bond Solid (KVBS), and anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) phases, as well as indications of a small KVBS/AFM coexistence region. We find that a weak to moderate Hubbard repulsion, tuned toward the SM-AFM critical value in the pure honeycomb Hubbard model, enhances KVBS correlations and can even stabilize the KVBS phase. Estimating the effective parameters for graphene places it in the SM region of the phase diagram, but near the SM-KVBS phase boundary. Notably, we predict that increasing either the on-site Hubbard repulsion or the e-ph coupling strength drives graphene toward the KVBS phase rather than the AFM phase, highlighting a synergistic effect that can be exploited to further control the remarkable properties of graphene and related materials.

Title: Dynamics of interacting bosons in a two-leg ring ladder with artificial magnetic flux and ac-driven modulations
Authors: L. Q. Lai
Abstract: We investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of interacting bosons in a two-leg ring ladder pierced by an artificial magnetic flux, where the particles are initially localized in the central sites of both rings, and the ac-driven local energy shifts are applied to the remaining lattice sites. Within the mean-field approximation, we demonstrate the emergence of nonlinear self-trapping for strong interparticle interactions, and characterize the distinct excitation regimes in the absence of the inter-ring tunneling. The artificial magnetic flux typically introduces Peierls phase factors, which induces complex-valued hopping amplitudes and leads to directed net particle currents along the chains. By further incorporating the finite inter-ring coupling and biased intra-ring hopping, we reveal that the tuning of the drive frequency and Peierls phase allows the precise control over both the intensity and direction of particle currents, which facilitates the transition between chiral and antichiral dynamics. These findings offer insights into the coherent manipulation of matter-wave transports in closed-loop lattice configurations and the exploration of nonequilibrium synthetic quantum systems in related fields.

Title: Enabling the bulk photovoltaic effect in centrosymmetric materials through an external electric field
Authors: Guilherme J. Inacio, Juan José Esteve-Paredes, Maurício F. C. Martins Quintela, Wendel S. Paz, Juan José Palacios
Abstract: We develop a practical approach to electrically tuning the nonlinear photoresponse of two-dimensional semiconductors by explicitly incorporating a static out-of-plane electric field into the electronic ground state prior to optical excitation, as a gate bias. The method is implemented by dressing a Wannier-interpolated Hamiltonian with the field through its position matrix elements, which allows the gate bias to modify orbital hybridization and band dispersion beyond perturbative treatments. Within the independent-particle approximation, the resulting second-order (shift) conductivity is evaluated for both centrosymmetric and non-centrosymmetric layered systems. Applied to MoS$_2$, the approach captures the emergence of a finite shift current in centrosymmetric bilayers and the tunability of intrinsic responses in polar structures. The shift conductivity rises linearly at small fields and saturates at higher intensities, reflecting the competition between the growing shift vector and the weakening interband coupling as resonant transitions move away from high-symmetry valleys. A Taylor expansion of the field-dressed conductivity connects this behavior to the third-order optical response, revealing a unified picture of field-induced nonlinearities. These results establish field dressing of Wannier Hamiltonians as a practical route to model and predict nonlinear photocurrents in layered materials.

Title: Fast machine learned $α$-Fe-H interatomic potential for hydrogen embrittlement
Authors: Eetu Makkonen, Alvaro Lopez-Cazalilla, Flyura Djurabekova
Abstract: In this work, we present a machine-learned interatomic potential for the ${\alpha}$-Fe-H system based on the tabulated Gaussian Approximation Potential (tabGAP) formalism. Trained on a Density Functional Theory (DFT) dataset of atomic configurations, energies, forces, and virials, the potential is designed to address the issue of H-induced acceleration of mechanical failure of metals, generally known as hydrogen embrittlement (HE). The proposed potential is shown to outperform the widely used classical and machine-learned interatomic potentials in fundamental properties of the ${\alpha}$-Fe-H system. We show that the tabGAP model reproduces H-point defect properties, H-dislocation interaction, H-H interaction, and elastic constants with nearly DFT-level accuracy at a computational cost that is competitive with the efficient classical Embedded Atom Method (EAM) potentials. We further demonstrate the utility of the tabGAP model in molecular dynamics simulations of tensile tests of a perfect, and a $(111)[11\bar{2}]$-notched ${\alpha}$-Fe structure with and without the load of H atoms. The simulations show evidence of HE via observation of accelerated decohesion of Fe atoms at the tip of the notch, and an increase in vacancy concentration driven by H-dislocation interactions. Hence, the results of the presented simulations support the hypotheses of hydrogen-enhanced decohesion (HEDE) alongside hydrogen-enhanced strain induced vacancies (HESIV) as important mechanisms for H-induced mechanical failure of iron systems.

Title: Fluidization induced by Magnetic Interactions in Confined Active Matter
Authors: Marco Musacchio, Markus Felber, Matteo Paoluzzi, Andrea Gnoli, Andrea Puglisi, Luca Angelani
Abstract: We investigate magnetic active matter in confined geometries using both experiments with magnetic toy robots Hexbugs and simulations of elongated magnetic active Brownian particles in circular domains. Standard active particles tend to accumulate at boundaries, forming clusters even at relatively low densities. In the presence of magnetic interactions, we provide evidence for a fluidization effect that inhibits clustering and shifts its onset to higher packing fractions. Moreover, magnetic dipolar interactions give rise to novel collective behaviors, such as train-like formations, rotating pairs, and particle vortices.

Title: Thermodynamic response functions in a cell fluid model with Curie-Weiss interaction. I. Supercritical region
Authors: M.P. Kozlovskii, O.A. Dobush, R.V. Romanik, I.V. Pylyuk, M.A. Shpot
Abstract: Thermodynamic response functions, including the isothermal compressibility, the thermal pressure coefficient, and the thermal expansion coefficient, isochoric and isobaric heat capacities are explicitly derived for a many-particle system interacting through a Curie-Weiss-type potential. These calculations are based on an exact equation of state previously obtained for a cell fluid model in the grand canonical ensemble. The resulting response functions are presented graphically as functions of temperature, density, and chemical potential within the supercritical region.

Title: Unified interface dipole theory for Fermi level pinning effect at metal-semiconductor contacts
Authors: Ziying Xiang, Jun-Wei Luo, Shu-Shen Li
Abstract: We present a unified bond dipole theory for metal-semiconductor interfaces to explain the microscopic origin of interface dipoles and Fermi level pinning (FLP) in terms of Harrison's bond-orbital model. By combining first-principles calculations with tight-binding analysis, we show that localized bonding between semiconductor surface dangling bonds and metal orbitals is sufficient to generate a large interface dipole and induce strong FLP, even when only a single metal monolayer is present. Within this framework, metal-induced gap states (MIGS), dangling-bond-induced surface states (DBSS), and bonding states embedded in the valence band are all understood as different outcomes of the same underlying interface bonding mechanism, rather than as independent causes of FLP. We further establish that the key parameter governing FLP strength is the density of surface dangling bonds that can form new chemical bonds with the metal, which directly controls the magnitude of the bond-induced interface dipole. This picture naturally explains the weaker pinning observed in more ionic semiconductors than in covalent ones and provides practical guidance for engineering metal-semiconductor interfaces and tuning Schottky barrier heights.

Title: Giant enhancement of transport driven by active fluctuations: impact of inertia
Authors: K. Białas, J. Spiechowicz
Abstract: Recently, a paradoxical effect has been demonstrated in which transport of a free Brownian particle driven by active fluctuations in the form of white Poisson shot noise can be significantly enhanced when it is additionally subjected to a periodic potential. This phenomenon can emerge in an overdamped system, but it may also be inertia-induced. Here, we considerably extend previous studies and comprehensively investigate the impact of inertia on the effect of free transport enhancement observed in the overdamped system. We detect that inertia can not only induce this phenomenon, but depending on a parameter regime, it may also strengthen, weaken, or even destroy it. We exemplify these different scenarios and explore the parameter space to identify the corresponding regions where they emerge. The variance of the active fluctuations amplitude distribution is a key determinant of the inertia influence on the effect of free transport amplification. Our results are relevant not only for microscopic physical systems but also for biological ones, such as, e.g., living cells, where fluctuations generated by metabolic activities are active by default.

Title: Charge carrier relaxation dynamics in the one-dimensional Kondo lattice model
Authors: Arturo Perez-Romero, Mica Schwarm, Fabian Heidrich-Meisner
Abstract: A generic question in the field of ultrafast dynamics is concerned with the relaxation dynamics and the subsequent thermalization of optically excited charge carriers. Among several possible relaxation channels available in a solid-state system, we focus on the coupling to magnetic excitations. In this paper, we study the real-time dynamics of a paradigmatic model, the Kondo lattice model in one dimension. We conduct a comprehensive study of the relaxation processes by evaluating the spin polarization of the conduction electron, the local spin-spin correlation between localized and conduction electrons, and the electronic momentum distribution. While in the well-studied cases of one or two charge carriers in a ferromagnetic background, no thermalization occurs, we demonstrate that the stationary state is compatible with thermalization if either the electronic filling is finite or the magnetic background is in the singlet sector. Our real-time simulations using the time-dependent Lanczos method are corroborated by a direct comparison with finite-temperature expectation values and an analysis of the spectrum in terms of the gap ratio.

Title: Symmetries of excitons
Authors: Muralidhar Nalabothula, Davide Sangalli, Fulvio Paleari, Sven Reichardt, Ludger Wirtz
Abstract: Excitons, bound electron-hole pairs, are responsible for strong optical resonances near the bandgap in low-dimensional materials and wide-bandgap insulators. Although current ab initio methods can accurately determine exciton energies and eigenstates, their symmetries have been much less explored. In this work, we employ standard group-theory methods to analyse the transformation properties of excitonic states, obtained by solving the BSE, under crystal symmetry operations. We develop an approach to assign irreducible-representation labels to excitonic states, providing a state-of-the-art framework for analysing their symmetries and selection rules (including, for example, the case of exciton-phonon coupling). Complementary to the symmetry classification, we introduce the concept of total crystal angular momentum for excitons in the presence of rotational symmetries, allowing the derivation of conservation laws. Furthermore, we demonstrate how these symmetry properties can be exploited to greatly enhance the computational efficiency of exciton calculations with the BSE. We apply our methodology to three prototypical systems to understand the role of symmetries in different contexts: (i) For LiF, we present the symmetry analysis of the entire excitonic dispersion and examine the selection rules for optical absorption. (ii) In the calculation of resonant Raman spectra of monolayer MoSe2, we demonstrate how the conservation of total crystal angular momentum governs exciton-phonon interactions, leading to the observed resonant enhancement. (iii) In bulk hBN, we analyze the role of symmetries for the coupling of finite-momentum excitons to finite-momentum phonons and their manifestation in the phonon-assisted luminescence spectra. This work establishes a general and robust framework for understanding the symmetry properties of excitons in crystals, providing a foundation for future studies.

Title: Saturation Field as a Direct Probe of Exchange and Single-Ion Anisotropies in Spin-1 Magnets
Authors: M. A. R. Griffith, S. Rufo, H. Caldas, F. Dinola Neto, Minos A. Neto, J. R. Viana
Abstract: High magnetic fields provide a direct route to probe the anisotropies that govern spin dynamics in layered magnets. Using the SU(3) bond operator framework for spin 1 systems, we derive analytic expressions for the magnon spectrum and the critical fields delimiting the field induced ordered phase. We show that the upper critical field $h_{c2}$ carries a simple and quantitative fingerprint of both exchange anisotropy and single ion symmetry breaking, enabling high field experiments to serve as sensitive probes of microscopic anisotropy. We further map how these anisotropies, together with interlayer coupling, control the extent and location of the magnon Bose Einstein condensation dome. Our results provide experimentally accessible criteria for identifying symmetry breaking mechanisms in real spin 1 materials.

Title: Formation of Light-Emitting Defects in Ag-based Memristors
Authors: Diana Singh, Maciej Ćwierzona, Sebastian Maćkowski, Alexandre Bouhelier
Abstract: Optical memristors are innovative devices that enable the integration of electro-optical functionalities - such as light modulation, multilevel optical memory, and nonvolatile reprogramming - into neuromorphic networks. Recently, their capabilities have expanded with the development of light-emitting memristors, which operate through various emission mechanisms. One notable process involves the electroluminescence of defects generated within the switching matrix during device activation. In this study, we explore the early-stage formation and evolution of the species responsible for light emission in Ag-based in-plane memristors. Our approach combines electrical stimulation with correlated optical electroluminescence and photoluminescence measurements. The findings provide valuable insights into controlling emission processes in memristors, paving the way for their integration as essential components in neuromorphic circuits.

Abstract: Collective excitations such as magnons and polar phonons provide natural access to the terahertz (THz) regime, but efficient generation and tunability remain elusive. Multiferroic BiFeO3 combines both orders at room temperature, offering a unique platform for narrowband THz emission. Here, we achieve efficient sub-bandgap optical rectification of coupled phonon-polaritons near 2 THz in bare epitaxial thin films. In Pt/BiFeO3 bilayers, we demonstrate that coupling the electromagnon branch with ultrafast strain waves, optically generated in Pt layers with various thicknesses, can produce tunable and narrowband emission between 0.4-0.8 THz. These results uncover the intertwined role of phonons, magnons, and magneto-acoustic dynamics in antiferromagnetic multiferroics, and establish these hybrid platforms as versatile engineered narrowband THz sources.

Title: Unconventional orders in the maple-leaf ferro-antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model
Authors: Lasse Gresista, Dominik Kiese, Simon Trebst, Yasir Iqbal
Abstract: Motivated by the search for unconventional orders in frustrated quantum magnets, we present a multi-method investigation into the nature of the quantum phase diagram of the spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg model on the maple-leaf lattice with three symmetry-inequivalent nearest-neighbor interactions. It has been argued that the parameter regime with antiferromagnetic couplings on hexagons $J_h$ and ferromagnetic couplings on triangles $J_t$ and dimer $J_d$ bonds, is potentially host to a cornucopia of emergent phases with unconventional orders. Our analysis indeed identifies an extended region where any conventional dipolar magnetic order is absent. A hexagonal singlet state is found in the region around $J_{d}=J_{t}=0$, while a dimerized hexagonal singlet order of a lattice nematic character appears proximate to the phase boundary with the c$120^\circ$ antiferromagnetic order. Interestingly, upon traversing the bulk of the paramagnetic (PM) region, we find a variety of distinct correlation profiles, which are qualitatively different from those of the hexagonal singlet and dimerized hexagonal singlet orders but feature no appreciable spin-nematic response, while the boundary with the ferromagnetic phase shows evidence of spin-nematic order. This PM region is thus likely host to an ensemble of nonmagnetic phases which could putatively include quantum spin liquids. Our phase diagram is built from a complementary application of state-of-the-art implementations of the cluster mean-field and pseudo-fermion functional renormalization group approaches, together with an unconstrained Luttinger-Tisza treatment of the model providing insights from the semi-classical limit.

Title: Dichroism from Thermoelectric Chiral Drives: Generalized Sum Rules for Orbital and Heat Magnetizations
Authors: Baptiste Bermond, Lucila Peralta Gavensky, Anaïs Defossez, Nathan Goldman
Abstract: We introduce a unified framework that relates orbital and heat magnetizations to experimentally accessible excitation spectra, through thermoelectric probes and generalized sum rules. By analyzing zero-temperature transport coefficients and applying Kramers-Kronig relations, we derive spectral representations of magnetization densities from thermoelectric correlation functions. Excitation rates under thermoelectric chiral drives then naturally emerge as direct probes of these Kubo-type correlators, placing orbital and heat magnetizations on equal footing with the topological Chern number. As a direct consequence of our formalism, we introduce a hierarchical construction that organizes orbital and heat magnetizations into distinct physical contributions accessible through sum rules, and also derive real-space markers of these magnetizations. From an experimental standpoint, we propose concrete implementations of thermoelectric dichroic measurements in quantum-engineered platforms based on modulated strain fields. These results establish thermoelectric dichroic measurements as a versatile route to access and disentangle fundamental ground-state properties.

Title: Edge-Dependent Superconductivity in Twisted Bismuth Bilayers
Authors: Isaías Rodríguez, Renela M. Valladares, Alexander Valladares, David Hinojosa-Romero, Flor B. Quiroga, Ariel A. Valladares
Abstract: Twisted bilayers offer a compelling and, at times, confounding platform for the engineering of new twistronic materials. Whereas standard studies almost exclusively focus on the explicit enigma that is presented by twist-angles, perhaps better epitomized by the related phenomena that have been observed in twisted bilayer graphene, functional devices necessarily face a fundamental concern: boundary heterogeneity in their structures. In this study, we address this concern by strictly investigating the electronic properties of twisted bismuth bilayers at the flake's edges and the vibrational properties of the flake. Twisted flakes exhibit continuous variations of these properties, away from the bulk, as we herein report using ab initio density functional theory, by systematically mapping the drastic evolution of band topology, electronic density of states, and possible superconductivity. Our work reveals a dramatic, non-fortuitous consequence of the structural disorder at the edges of the flakes: an enhanced electronic density of states at the Fermi level. This enhancement reaches a maximum of 10 times that of perfect-crystalline bismuth. Given that the superconducting critical temperature, Tc, is exponentially dependent on the electronic density of states at the Fermi level, this substantial structural variation immediately suggests a powerful mechanism for vastly increasing Tc. We also identify the twist-angle as a new critical parameter in designing novel engineering devices with topologically enhanced properties. Our results provide a necessary theoretical framework for interpreting new data for the upcoming generation of twistronic heterogeneous materials, and pave the way to search for atomic disordered metastable structures that could lead to enhanced superconducting transition temperatures.

Title: On the generalized Keffer form of the Dzyaloshinskii constant: its consequences for the spin, momentum and polarization evolution
Authors: Pavel A. Andreev
Abstract: Different analytical features of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction are related to different contribution to the Dzyaloshinskii constant in the microscopic Hamiltonian. Consequences appear in the macroscopic Landau--Lifshitz--Gilbert equation. It leads to various phenomena. Three contributions to the Dzyaloshinskii constant are reviewed and combined in the generalized Keffer form of the Dzyaloshinskii constant. Macroscopic consequences of these three mechanisms are well-known, but further possible generalizations of the Keffer form of the Dzyaloshinskii constant are suggested. Consequences for the spin evolution equations, the momentum balance equations, and polarization evolution equations are considered. Some analog of the Keffer form is suggested for the exchange integral in symmetric Heisenberg Hamiltonian demonstrating the nontrivial contribution of the ligands in this regime.

Title: Mean-field Modelling of Moiré Materials: A User's Guide with Selected Applications to Twisted Bilayer Graphene
Authors: Yves H. Kwan, Ziwei Wang, Glenn Wagner, Nick Bultinck, Steven H. Simon, Siddharth A. Parameswaran
Abstract: We review the theoretical modelling of moiré materials, focusing on various aspects of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MA-TBG) viewed through the lens of Hartree-Fock mean-field theory. We first provide an elementary introduction to the continuum modelling of moiré bandstructures, and explain how interactions are incorporated to study correlated states. We then discuss how to implement mean-field simulations of ground state structure and collective excitations in this setting. With this background established, we rationalize the power of mean-field approximations in MA-TBG, by discussing the idealized "chiral-flat" strong-coupling limit, in which ground states at electron densities commensurate with the moiré superlattice are exactly captured by mean-field ansätze. We then illustrate the phenomenological shortcomings of this limit, leading us naturally into a discussion of the intermediate-coupling incommensurate Kekulé spiral (IKS) order and its origins in ever-present heterostrain. IKS and its placement within an expanded Hartree-Fock manifold form our first "case study". Our second case study involves time-dependence, and focuses on the collective modes of various broken-symmetry insulators in MA-TBG. As a third and final case study, we return to the strong-coupling picture, which can be stabilized by aligning MA-TBG to an hBN substrate. In this limit, we show how mean field theory can be adapted to the translationally non-invariant setting in order to quantitatively study the energetics of domain walls in orbital Chern insulating states. We close with a discussion of extensions and further applications. Used either as a standalone reference or alongside the accompanying open-source code, this review should enable readers with a basic knowledge of band theory and many-body physics to systematically build and analyze detailed models of generic moiré systems.

Title: Dynamical topology of chiral and nonreciprocal state transfers in a non-Hermitian quantum system
Authors: Pengfei Lu, Yang Liu, Qifeng Lao, Teng Liu, Xinxin Rao, Ji Bian, Hao Wu, Feng Zhu, Le Luo
Abstract: The fundamental concept underlying topological phenomena posits the geometric phase associated with eigenstates. In contrast to this prevailing notion, theoretical studies on time-varying Hamiltonians allow for a new type of topological phenomenon, known as topological dynamics, where the evolution process allows a hidden topological invariant associated with continuous flows. To validate this conjecture, we study topological chiral and nonreciprocal dynamics by encircling the exceptional points (EPs) of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians in a trapped ion system. These dynamics are topologically robust against external perturbations even in the presence dissipation-induced nonadiabatic processes. Our findings indicate that they are protected by dynamical vorticity -- an emerging topological invariant associated with the energy dispersion of non-Hermitian band structures in a parallel transported eigenbasis. The symmetry breaking and other key features of topological dynamics are directly observed through quantum state tomography. Our results mark a significant step towards exploring topological properties of open quantum systems.

Title: Game Theory in Cosmology
Authors: Oem Trivedi, Venkat Venkatsubramanian
Abstract: We present a game-theoretic statistical framework for cosmology, which we term \textit{Cosmological Teleodynamics}. We recast the dark sector, cosmic acceleration, large-scale structure, and cosmic tensions as emergent consequences of nonlocal memory and intrinsically persistent organization in a self-gravitating Universe. By introducing a maximum-caliber weight on cosmic histories and a bias functional encoding structural memory, we derive modified Friedmann, Boltzmann, and Poisson equations that naturally generate dark energy-like acceleration, dark matter-like clustering, and scale-dependent growth suppression. We also show how this approach can naturally help alleviate the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions, can produce anisotropic velocity fields, and predict environment-dependent halo signatures that cannot arise from particle dark matter or scalar-field dark energy. We also derive a generalized horizon entropy and temperature, revealing a nonequilibrium statistical origin for cosmic acceleration and formulating a Law of Universal Arbitrage Equilibrium that governs the evolution of the Universe, showing that it is expanding towards a continuous form of Nash equilibrium. Cosmological Teleodynamics therefore offers a unified, emergent, and testable alternative to the conventional dark sector, rooted not in new particles but in the intrinsic statistical and systemic structure of cosmic memory, and shows that the universe itself operates like a giant potential game.

Title: Elucidating the Inter-system Crossing of the Nitrogen-Vacancy Center up to Megabar Pressures

Abstract: The integration of Nitrogen-Vacancy color centers into diamond anvil cells has opened the door to quantum sensing at megabar pressures. Despite a multitude of experimental demonstrations and applications ranging from quantum materials to geophysics, a detailed microscopic understanding of how stress affects the NV center remains lacking. In this work, using a combination of first principles calculations as well as high-pressure NV experiments, we develop a complete description of the NV's optical properties under general stress conditions. In particular, our ab initio calculations reveal the complex behavior of the NV's inter-system crossing rates under stresses that both preserve and break the defect's symmetry. Crucially, our proposed framework immediately resolves a number of open questions in the field, including: (i) the microscopic origin of the observed contrast-enhancement in (111)-oriented anvils, and (ii) the surprising observation of NV contrast-inversion in certain high-pressure regimes. Our work lays the foundation for optimizing the performance of NV high-pressure sensors by controlling the local stress environment, and more generally, suggests that symmetry-breaking stresses can be utilized as a novel tuning knob for generic solid-state spin defects.

Title: Rectification of stress by fiber networks: Manifestation of non-linear screening through self-organized buckling
Authors: Kanaya Malakar, Albert Countryman, Bulbul Chakraborty
Abstract: Force transmission at large length scales is crucial for such biological functions as cell motility and morphogenesis. The networks that transmit these forces are malleable, patterned by active forces generated at the microscale by biological motors. In this paper we explore a simple model of a non-linear fiber network which has only two modes of deformation, but exhibits diverse mechanical phases with distinct large-scale response, tuned by the strength of a microscopic force dipole. We demonstrate, via numerical simulations, that the network is remodeled by organized patterns of buckling, which lead to a renormalization of the Poisson ratio. Finally, we show that the emergent behavior at large length scales can be ascribed to "mechanical screening" of the force dipole, analogous to dielectric screening of charges in electrostatics.

Title: Multi-Field Relativistic Continuous Matrix Product States
Authors: Karan Tiwana, Antoine Tilloy
Abstract: Relativistic continuous matrix product states (RCMPS) are a powerful variational ansatz for quantum field theories of a single field. However, they inherit a property of their non-relativistic counterpart that makes them divergent for models with multiple fields, unless a regularity condition is satisfied. This has so far restricted the use of RCMPS to toy models with a single self-interacting field. We address this long standing problem by introducing a Riemannian optimization framework, that allows to minimize the energy density over the regular submanifold of multi-field RCMPS, and thus to retain purely variational results. We demonstrate its power on a model of two interacting scalar fields in $1+1$ dimensions. The method captures distinct symmetry-breaking phases, and the signature of a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition along an $O(2)$-symmetric parameter line. This makes RCMPS usable for a far larger class of problems than before.

Title: Real-time Monitoring of Neon Film Growth for Electron-on-Neon Qubits
Authors: Sidharth Duthaluru, Kaiwen Zheng, Erik A. Henriksen, Kater W. Murch
Abstract: Electron-on-neon (eNe) charge states coupled to superconducting circuits are a promising platform for quantum computing. Control over the formation of these charge states requires techniques to track and control the growth of solid Ne films on the circuit surface. We demonstrate a real-time Ne film-growth monitor using high-transition-temperature (high-$T_c$) YBCO microwave resonators. The high $T_c$ enables tracking of the film thickness near Ne's triple temperature and below. Across more than 300 solidification experiments, we find that the final Ne thickness varies stochastically from a few nm to a few $\mu$m for films solidified from the liquid phase. By increasing the driving power in the resonator, we consistently reduce the final thickness to below 100 nm. These results represent an important step toward controlled formation of Ne films for eNe qubits and highlight the broader utility of high-$T_c$ resonators for hybrid quantum systems.

Title: Krylov Complexity of Supersymmetric SYK Models
Authors: James Chryssanthacopoulos, David Vegh
Abstract: We study the effect of supersymmetry breaking on Krylov complexity in the $\mathcal{N}=2$ SYK model under irrelevant and mass deformations of the Hamiltonian. The irrelevant deformation breaks $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry down to $\mathcal{N}=1$, while the mass deformation breaks supersymmetry completely. Using Krylov subspace methods, we analyze the Lanczos sequence, Krylov dimension, complexity, and entropy at finite system size as functions of deformation strength. Both deformations enlarge the Krylov space, but the mass deformation has a stronger effect. Krylov complexity exhibits initial quadratic growth, followed by linear growth across both deformations. We observe that both deformations increase the quadratic and linear growth rates of Krylov complexity at early times. At late times, the irrelevant deformation increases the saturation complexity as a fraction of the Krylov dimension, while the mass deformation decreases it. This reveals distinct signatures of how supersymmetry breaking impacts quantum complexity.

Title: Tungsten Germanide Single-Photon Detectors with Saturated Internal Detection Efficiency at Wavelengths up to 29 μm

Abstract: Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) are among the most sensitive single-photon detectors available and have the potential to transform fields ranging from infrared astrophysics to molecular spectroscopy. However, extending their performance into the mid-infrared spectral region - crucial for applications such as exoplanet transit spectroscopy and vibrational fingerprinting of molecules - has remained a major challenge, primarily due to material limitations and scalability constraints. Here, we report on the development of SNSPDs based on tungsten germanide, a novel material system that combines high infrared sensitivity with compatibility for large-scale fabrication. Our detectors exhibit saturated internal detection efficiency at wavelengths up to 29 $\mathrm{\mu m}$. This advance enables scalable, high-performance single-photon detection in a spectral region that was previously inaccessible, opening new frontiers in remote sensing, thermal imaging, environmental monitoring, molecular physics, and astronomy.

Title: Restoring a Missing Meta-Symmetry of Quantum Mechanics
Authors: Sheng Ran
Abstract: In conventional quantum mechanics, all unitary evolution takes place within the space-time Hilbert space $\mathcal H_{xt}=L^2(\mathcal M_{xt})$, with time as the sole evolution parameter. The momentum-energy representation $\phi(k,E)$ is treated merely as a Fourier re-expression of the same state-kinematically equivalent but dynamically inert. Here we restore the fundamental symmetry between the conjugate pairs $(x,t)$ and $(k,E)$ by extending the quantum theory to an enlarged Hilbert space $\mathcal H_{\text{total}} = \mathcal H_{xt} \oplus \mathcal H_{kE}$, within which the momentum-energy sector $\mathcal H_{kE}=L^2(\mathcal M_{kE})$ carries its own autonomous unitary evolution generated by a self-adjoint operator $\hat{\mathcal T}$. The resulting structure establishes a meta-symmetry: a symmetry between two conjugate dynamical projections of a single global quantum state. It produces a dual-manifold geometry in which each domain is locally complete yet globally open, with divergent limits in one mapping onto extended regions in the other. Remarkably, the dual-manifold symmetry alone reproduces both the uniform dark-energy background and the exponential boundary mapping near black-hole horizons that underlies Hawking radiation. This framework thus opens a quantum-theoretic route to cosmological phenomena that are ordinarily treated within general relativity.

Title: The effects of decoherence on Fermi's golden rule
Authors: Caihong Zheng, Fan Zheng
Abstract: Fermi's golden rule which describes the transition rates between two electronic levels under external stimulations is used ubiquitously in different fields of physics. The original Fermi's golden rule was derived from perturbative time-dependent Schrödinger's equation without the direct contribution by decoherence effect. However, as a result of recent developments of quantum computing and ultra fast carrier dynamics, the decoherence becomes a prominent topic in fundamental this http URL, by using the non-adiabatic molecular dynamics which goes beyond the time-dependent Schrödinger's equation by introducing decoherence, we study the effect of decoherence on Fermi's golden rule for the fixed basis and the adiabatic basis, respectively. We find that when the decoherence time becomes short, there is a significant deviation from the Fermi's golden rule for both bases. By using monolayer $\mathrm{WS_2}$ as an example, we investigate the decoherence effect in the carrier transitions induced by the electron-phonon coupling with first-principle method.

Title: Floquet thermalization by power-law induced permutation symmetry breaking
Authors: Manju C, Uma Divakaran
Abstract: Permutation symmetry plays a central role in the understanding of collective quantum dynamics. On the other hand, interactions are rarely uniform in real systems. By introducing power law couplings that algebraically decay with the distance between the spins $r$ as $1/r^{\alpha}$, we break this symmetry with a non-zero $\alpha$, and probe the emergence of new dynamical behaviors, including thermalization. As we increase $\alpha$, the system interpolates from an infinite range spin system at $\alpha=0$ exhibiting permutation symmetry, to a short range integrable model as $\alpha \rightarrow \infty$ where this permutation symmetry is absent. We focus on the change in the behavior of the system as $\alpha$ is tuned, using dynamical quantities like total angular momentum operator $J^2$ and the von Neumann entropy $S_{N/2}$. Starting from the chaotic limit of the permutation symmetric Hamiltonian at $\alpha=0$, we find that for small $\alpha$, the steady state values of these quantities remain close to the permutation symmetric subspace values corresponding to $\alpha=0$. At intermediate $\alpha$ values, these show signatures of thermalization exhibiting values corresponding to that of random states in full Hilbert space. On the other hand, the large $\alpha$ limit approaches the values corresponding to integrable kicked Ising model. In addition, we also study the dependence of thermalization on the driving period $\tau$, with results indicating the onset of thermalization for smaller values of $\alpha$ when $\tau$ is large, thereby extending the intermediate range of $\alpha$. We further confirm these results using effective dimension and spectral statistics.

Title: Acoustic neural networks: Identifying design principles and exploring physical feasibility
Authors: Ivan Kalthoff, Marcel Rey, Raphael Wittkowski
Abstract: Wave-guide-based physical systems provide a promising route toward energy-efficient analog computing beyond traditional electronics. Within this landscape, acoustic neural networks represent a promising approach for achieving low-power computation in environments where electronics are inefficient or limited, yet their systematic design has remained largely unexplored. Here we introduce a framework for designing and simulating acoustic neural networks, which perform computation through the propagation of sound waves. Using a digital-twin approach, we train conventional neural network architectures under physically motivated constraints including non-negative signals and weights, the absence of bias terms, and nonlinearities compatible with intensity-based, non-negative acoustic signals. Our work provides a general framework for acoustic neural networks that connects learnable network components directly to physically measurable acoustic properties, enabling the systematic design of realizable acoustic computing systems. We demonstrate that constrained recurrent and hierarchical architectures can perform accurate speech classification, and we propose the SincHSRNN, a hybrid model that combines learnable acoustic bandpass filters with hierarchical temporal processing. The SincHSRNN achieves up to 95% accuracy on the AudioMNIST dataset while remaining compatible with passive acoustic components. Beyond computational performance, the learned parameters correspond to measurable material and geometric properties such as attenuation and transmission. Our results establish general design principles for physically realizable acoustic neural networks and outline a pathway toward low-power, wave-based neural computing.

Title: White light interferometry analysis for measuring thin film thickness down to few nanometers
Authors: Victor Ziapkoff, François Boulogne, Anniina Salonen, Emmanuelle Rio
Abstract: We present a practical white-light interferometric method, supported by an open-source Python library \textit{optifik} for automated spectrum-to-thickness deduction, enabling foam film measurements down to a few nanometers. We describe three typical spectral scenarii encountered in this method: spectra exhibiting numerous interference fringes, spectra with a moderate number of peaks, and spectra with only a few identifiable features, providing illustrative examples for each case. We also discuss the main limitations of the technique, including spectral range constraints, the necessity of knowing the refractive index, and the influence of spectral resolution and signal quality. Finally, we demonstrate the application of the method in a time-resolved study of a TTAB (tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide) foam film undergoing elongation and thinning. This method can be adapted to measure any thin non-opaque layer.

Title: Modeling dissipation in quantum active matter
Authors: Alexander P. Antonov, Sangyun Lee, Benno Liebchen, Hartmut Löwen, Jannis Melles, Giovanna Morigi, Yehor Tuchkov, Michael te Vrugt
Abstract: Active matter denotes a system of particles immersed in an external environment, from which the particles extract energy continuously in order to perform motion. Extending the paradigm of active matter to a quantum framework requires an open quantum system description. In this work, we consider a driven quantum particle whose external driving exhibits characteristics of classical activity. We model the dynamics with time-local master equations and analyze the particle motion at different time scales for different forms of the master equations. By systematically comparing several types of master equations, we uncover how the particle motion evolves under the interplay of quantum effects and active-like dynamics. These results are essential for guiding possible experiments aimed at realizing quantum analogues of classical active systems.

Kieu (2) ((1) Lunar and Planetary Laboratory, The University of Arizona, Tucson, USA (2) Wyant College of Optical Sciences, The University of Arizona, Tucson, USA (3) Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The University of Arizona, Tucson, USA)
Abstract: Diamonds offer unique benefits for optical technology development due to their optical, chemical, electrical, mechanical, and thermal properties. These attributes also contribute to their aesthetic appeal, high commercial value, and utility in geological studies. Thus, there is high demand for nondestructive techniques that enable rapid analysis of natural and synthetic diamonds as well as diamond-like simulants. Here, we demonstrate sub-micrometer, nondestructive, three-dimensional imaging and spectral analysis of diamonds using multiphoton microscopy (MPM). This approach stimulates nonlinear optical emissions to provide unique insights into the interior structure, fluorescent defects, and formational conditions of diamonds. As a result, MPM can be used to investigate gemstone quality, vacancy centers used in quantum technologies, and the various inclusions and fluorescent emitters that may trace gemstone provenance and treatment history.

Title: The derivation of the Liouville equation from the Schrodinger equation and its implications
Authors: A. P. Meilakhs
Abstract: We present a new way of deriving classical mechanics from quantum mechanics. A key feature of the method is its compatibility with the standard approach used to derive transition rates between quantum states due to interactions. We apply the developed method to derive the main formulas of physical kinetics. We observe that, through the Liouville equation, we can deduce the non-collision part of the Boltzmann equation, and that, through the matrix of transition rates, we can deduce the collision integral. As a final result of the manuscript, we derive the Boltzmann equation from the Schrödinger equation as a single piece of formal mathematical manipulation, without any non-rigorous plausible reasoning used to glue together its different parts.

Title: Spectral Density and Eigenvector Nonorthogonality in Complex Symmetric Random Matrices
Authors: Gernot Akemann, Yan V. Fyodorov, Dmitry V. Savin
Abstract: Non-Hermitian random matrices with statistical spectral characteristics beyond the standard Ginibre ensembles have recently emerged in the description of dissipative quantum many-body systems as well as in non-ergodic wave transport in complex media. We investigate the class AI$^†$ of complex symmetric random matrices, for which available analytic results remain scarce. Using a recently proposed framework by one of the authors, we analyze this class for Gaussian entries and derive an explicit, closed-form expression for the joint distribution of a complex eigenvalue and its right eigenvector for arbitrary matrix size $N\ge 2$ in the entire complex plane. From this, we obtain the distribution of the eigenvector non-orthogonality overlap and the mean eigenvalue density, both for finite $N$ and in the large-$N$ limit. Notably, at the spectral edge both the eigenvalue density and eigenvector statistics exhibits a limiting behavior that differs from the Ginibre universtality class. This behavior is expected to be universal, as further supported by numerical evidence for Bernoulli random matrices.

Title: Holographically Emergent Gauge Theory in Symmetric Quantum Circuits
Authors: Akash Vijay, Jong Yeon Lee
Abstract: We develop a novel holographic framework for mixed-state phases in random quantum circuits, both unitary and non-unitary, with a global symmetry $G$. Viewing the circuit as a tensor network, we decompose it into two parts: a symmetric layer, which defines an emergent gauge wavefunction in one higher dimension, and a random non-symmetric layer, which consists of random multiplicity tensors. For unitarity circuits, the bulk gauge state is deconfined, but under a generic non-unitary circuit (e.g. channels), the bulk gauge theory can undergo a decoherence-induced phase transition: for $G\,{=}\,\mathbb{Z}_N$ with local symmetric noise, the circuit can act as a quantum error-correcting code with a distinguished logical subspace inheriting the $\mathbb{Z}_N$-surface code's topological protection. We then identify that the charge sharpening transition from the measurement side is complementary to a decodability transition in the bulk: noise of the bulk can be interpreted as measurement from the environment. For $N\,{\leq}\,4$, weak measurements drive a single transition from a charge-fuzzy phase with sharpening time $t_{\#}\sim e^{L}$ to a charge-sharp phase with $t_{\#}\sim \mathcal{O}(1)$, corresponding to confinement that destroys logical information. For $N>4$, measurements generically generate an intermediate quasi-long-range ordered Coulomb phase with gapless photons and purification time $t_{\#}\sim \mathcal{O}(L)$.

Title: Intrinsic and extrinsic photogalvanic effects in twisted bilayer graphene
Authors: Fernando Peñaranda, Hector Ochoa, Fernando de Juan
Abstract: The chiral lattice structure of twisted bilayer graphene with D6 symmetry allows for intrinsic photogalvanic effects only at off-normal incidence, while additional extrinsic effects are known to be induced by a substrate or a gate potential. In this work, we first compute the intrinsic effects and show they reverse sign at the magic angle, revealing a band inversion at the {\Gamma} point. We next consider different extrinsic effects, showing how they can be used to track the strengths of the substrate coupling or displacement field. We also show that the approximate particle-hole symmetry implies stringent constraints on the chemical potential dependence of all photocurrents. A detailed comparison of intrinsic vs. extrinsic photocurrents therefore reveals a wealth of information about the band structure and can also serve as a benchmark to constrain the symmetry breaking patterns of correlated states.

Title: Transition Graphs of Interacting Hysterons: Structure, Design, Organization and Statistics
Authors: Margot H. Teunisse, Martin van Hecke
Abstract: Transition graphs capture the memory and sequential response of multistable media, by specifying their evolution under external driving. Microscopically, collections of bistable elements, or hysterons, provide a powerful model for these materials, with recent work highlighting the crucial role of hysteron interactions. Here, we introduce a general framework that links transition graphs and the microscopic parameters of interacting hysterons. We first introduce a systematic framework, based on so-called scaffolds, which structures the space of transition graphs and provides tools to deal with their combinatorial explosion. We then connect the topology of transition graphs to partial orders of the microscopic parameters. This allows us to understand the statistical properties of transition graphs, as well as determine whether a given graph is realizable, i.e. compatible with the hysteron framework. Our approach paves the way for a deeper theoretical understanding of memory effects in complex media and opens a route to rationally design pathways and memory effects in materials.

Title: Electronic structure of UTe$_2$ under pressure
Authors: Makoto Shimizu, Youichi Yanase
Abstract: A heavy-fermion paramagnet UTe$_2$ has been a strong candidate for a spin-triplet superconductor. Experiments on UTe$_2$ under pressure have been vigorously conducted, and rich phase diagrams have been suggested. Multiple superconducting phases exist in the pressure region of $0 \leq P < 1.8 \mathrm{\;GPa}$, and an antiferromagnetic ordered state is observed in the high pressure region $P > 1.8 \mathrm{\;GPa}$. However, under pressure, the underlying electronic structure in the normal state has not been clarified, although knowledge of electronic structures is essential for studying magnetic and superconducting states. As an indispensable step toward understanding the phase diagram of UTe$_2$, we study the electronic structure under hydrostatic and uniaxial stresses based on the density functional theory with and without employing structural optimization. It is shown that the low-energy band structure and Fermi surfaces are not sensitive to pressure for parameters where itinerant $f$-electrons are not essential. However, we find a significant pressure dependence for a certain Coulomb interaction $U$ of the GGA+$U$ calculation, where the large weight of $f$-electrons appears at the Fermi level. An increase in the density of states at the Fermi level is observed under pressure, which is attributed to compressive stress along the [010] crystallographic axis.

Title: Ab initio study of orbital-selective superconductivity in $γ$-BiPd
Authors: Sonu Prasad Keshri, Guang-Yu Guo
Abstract: We investigate the superconducting (SC) properties of experimentally realised $\gamma$-BiPd by solving the anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg equations in conjunction with {\it ab initio} relativistic calculations of the electron and phonon band structures as well as electron-phonon coupling (EPC) matrix elements. Our study reveals that $\gamma$-BiPd possesses a complex Fermi surface (FS), consisting of two electron pockets and one hole pocket, each characterised by distinct atomic orbitals. Our key finding is that the superconductivity in $\gamma$-BiPd is primarily orbital-selective, arising from Bi $p$-orbitals, and distributed anisotropically on the FS, although contribution from Pd $d$-orbitals, particularly on the hole pocket, is also discernable. While our results show an anisotropic nature of the {\bf k}-dependent SC gap $\Delta_{\bf k}$ and EPC strength $\lambda_{\bf k}$ across the FS, calculated superconducting quasiparticle density of states $N_S$ spectra exhibit a U-shaped gap and $\Delta_{\bf k}$ distribution forms a single peak, being consistent with the spin-singlet $s$-wave superconductivity observed in this material. The calculated $T_c$ is $\sim$2.0 K, agreeing in order of magnitude with the experimental value of 3.3 K in $\gamma$-BiPd thin films. The predicted EPC-enhanced Sommerfeld coefficient $\gamma_n$ of $0.141$ mJ/K$^2$cm$^3$ is similar to the experimental $\gamma_n$ value ($0.119$ mJ/K$^2$cm$^3$) of the isoelectronic and isostructural Bi(Pd$_{0.5}$Pt$_{0.5}$) alloy.

Title: Magnetic injection photocurrents in valley polarized states of twisted bilayer graphene
Authors: Fernando Peñaranda, Héctor Ochoa, Fernando de Juan
Abstract: Magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene displays a complex phase diagram as a function of flat band filling, featuring compressibility cascade transitions and a variety of competing ground states with broken spin, valley and point group symmetries. Recent THz photocurrent spectroscopy experiments have shown a dependence on the filling which is not consistent with the simplest cascade picture of sequential filling of equivalent flat bands. In this work, we show that when time-reversal symmetry is broken due to valley polarization, a magnetic injection photocurrent develops which can be used to distinguish different spin-valley polarization scenarios. Using the topological heavy fermion model we compute both shift and injection currents as a function of filling and argue that current experiments can be used to determine the spontaneous valley polarization.

Title: First observation of turbulence in dense algal suspensions
Authors: Prince Vibek Baruah, Nadia Bihari Padhan, Biswajit Maji, Rahul Pandit, Prerna Sharma
Abstract: Active turbulence arises typically in systems ranging from microorganisms and biopolymers to synthetic colloids, where chaotic flows are closely associated with motile topological defects in collectively swarming suspensions. Here, we report the first experimental observation of turbulence in a fundamentally different class of systems: dense monolayers of motile unicellular alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii that exhibit neither orientational order nor topological defects. Nevertheless, the system displays rich spatiotemporal flow patterns with pronounced small-scale intermittency. We uncover strongly non-Gaussian velocity distribution, a feature distinct from both bacterial and classical fluid turbulence. Furthermore, we observe power-law regimes in the kinetic energy spectra, characterized by unique scaling exponents. Not only do our results provide compelling evidence for active turbulence in systems devoid of nematic or polar structures, but they also challenge current theoretical models. Our work opens new avenues for understanding emergent dynamics in active-matter systems and suggests intriguing biological implications, including enhanced mixing and transport in dense cell suspensions.

Title: Critical spin fluctuations across the superconducting dome in La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_4$
Authors: Jacopo Radaelli, Oliver J. Lipscombe, Mengze Zhu, J. Ross Stewart, Aavishkar A. Patel, Subir Sachdev, Stephen M. Hayden
Abstract: Overdoped cuprate superconductors are strange metals above their superconducting transition temperature. In such materials, the electrical resistivity has a strong linear dependence on temperature ($T$) and electrical current is not carried by electron quasiparticles as in conventional metals. Here we demonstrate that the strange metal behaviour co-exists with strongly temperature-dependent critical spin fluctuations showing dynamical scaling across the cuprate phase diagram. Our neutron scattering observations and the strange metal behaviour are consistent with a spin density wave quantum phase transition in a metal with spatial disorder in the tuning parameter. Numerical computations using a theory of spin density waves in a disordered metal yield an extended `Griffiths phase' with scaling properties in agreement with experimental observations. Thus we establish that low-energy spin excitations and spatial disorder are central to the strange metal behaviour.

Title: Phase Transformation Kinetics Model for Metals
Authors: Daniel N. Blaschke, Abigail Hunter, Dean L. Preston
Abstract: We develop a new model for phase transformation kinetics in metals by generalizing the Levitas-Preston (LP) phase field model of martensite phase transformations (see Levitas and Preston (2002a,b); Levitas, Preston and Lee (2003)) to arbitrary pressure. Furthermore, we account for and track: the interface speed of the pressure driven phase transformation, properties of critical nuclei, as well as nucleation at grain sites and on dislocations and homogeneous nucleation. The volume fraction evolution of each phase is described by employing KJMA (Kolmogorov, 1937; Johnson and Mehl, 1939; Avrami, 1939, 1940, 1941) kinetic theory. We then test our new model for iron under ramp loading conditions and compare our predictions for the $\alpha\to\epsilon$ iron phase transition to experimental data of Smith et al. (2013). More than one combination of material and model parameters (such as dislocation density and interface speed) led to good agreement of our simulations to the experimental data, thus highlighting the importance of having accurate characterization data for the microstructure of the sample under consideration.

Title: Probabilistic imaginary-time evolution in state-vector-based and shot-based simulations and on quantum devices
Authors: Satoshi Ejima, Kazuhiro Seki, Benedikt Fauseweh, Seiji Yunoki
Abstract: Imaginary-time evolution, an important technique in tensor network and quantum Monte Carlo algorithms on classical computers, has recently been adapted to quantum computing. In this study, we focus on probabilistic imaginary-time evolution (PITE) algorithm and derive its formulation in the context of state-vector-based simulations, where quantum state vectors are directly used to compute observables without statistical errors. We compare the results with those of shot-based simulations, which estimate observables through repeated projective measurements. Applying the PITE algorithm to the Heisenberg chain, we investigate optimal initial conditions for convergence. We further demonstrate the method on the transverse-field Ising model using a state-of-the-art trapped-ion quantum device. Finally, we explore the potential of error mitigation in this framework, highlighting practical considerations for near-term digital quantum simulations.

Title: Exploring Charge Density Waves in two-dimensional NbSe2 with Machine Learning
Authors: Norma Rivano, Francesco Libbi, Chuin Wei Tan, Christopher Cheung, Jose Lado, Arash Mostofi, Philip Kim, Johannes Lischner, Adolfo O. Fumega, Boris Kozinsky, Zachary A. H. Goodwin
Abstract: Niobium diselenide (NbSe$_2$) has garnered significant attention due to the coexistence of superconductivity and charge density waves (CDWs) down to the monolayer limit. However, realistic modeling of CDWs-capturing effects such as layer number, twist angle, and strain-remains challenging due to the high computational cost of first-principles methods. Here, we develop a physically informed workflow for training machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) based on the E(3)-equivariant Allegro architecture, tailored to capture the subtle structural and dynamical signatures of CDWs in mono- and bilayer NbSe$_2$.We find that while CDW lattice distortions are relatively easy to learn, modeling vibrational properties remains more challenging. It requires targeted dataset design and careful hyperparameter tuning, pushing the boundaries and testing the extensibility of current MLIP frameworks. Our MLIPs enable reliable simulations of commensurate and incommensurate CDW phases, including their sensitivity to dimensionality and stacking, as well as CDW dynamics, phonons, and transition temperatures estimated via the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation. This work opens new possibilities for studying and tuning CDWs in NbSe$_2$ and other two-dimensional systems, with implications for electron-phonon coupling, superconductivity, and advanced materials design.

Title: Crossover of Superconductivity across the antiferromagnetic end point in FeSe$_{\rm 1-x}$S$_{\rm x}$ under pressure
Authors: Kiyotaka Miyoshi, Takanobu Nakatani, Yumi Yamamoto, Takumi Maeda, Daichi Izuhara, Ikumi Matsushima
Abstract: Temperature-pressure ($T$-$P$) phase diagrams of FeSe$_{\rm 1-x}$S$_{\rm x}$ were investigated by the measurements of dc magnetization ($M$) and electrical resistivity ($\rho$) under pressure, using single crystal specimens with $x$=0.04, 0.08 and 0.13. For all specimens, the $M$($T$) curves under pressure near the end point of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase are found to show a two-step diamagnetic response, which can be described as the sum of two diamagnetic components $M_1$($T$) and $M_2$($T$), indicating that two superconducting (SC) phases with different $T_{\rm c}$ values coexist within a pressure range of $\Delta$$P$$\sim$1 GPa. Moreover, the pressure dependence of the amplitudes of $M_1$($T$) and $M_2$($T$) indicates a continuous transfer of the volume fraction between the two SC phases. These behaviors suggest that a crossover of superconductivity occurs in conjunction with the emergence of AFM phase and imply that the SC phases inside and outside the AFM phase could have different origins.

Title: Two-dimensional $J_1$-$J_2$ clock model: Enhanced symmetries, emergent orders, and Landau-incompatible transitions
Authors: Vishnu Pulloor Kuttanikkad, Abhishodh Prakash, Rajesh Narayanan, Titas Chanda
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study on the frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ classical $q$-state clock model with even $q>4$ on a two-dimensional square lattice, revealing a rich ensemble of phases driven by competing interactions. In the unfrustrated regime ($J_1>2J_2$), the model reproduces the standard clock model phenomenology: a low-temperature $\mathbb{Z}_q$-broken ferromagnet, an intermediate XY-like critical quasi-long-range-ordered (QLRO) phase with emergent $U(1)$ symmetry, and a high-temperature paramagnet. For $J_1<2J_2$, frustration stabilizes five distinct regimes: the disordered paramagnet, a stripe-ordered phase breaking $\mathbb{Z}_q\times\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, two $\mathbb{Z}_2$-broken nematic phases (one with and one without QLRO), and an exotic stripe phase with emergent discrete $\mathbb{Z}_q$ spin degrees of freedom prohibited in the microscopic Hamiltonian. Remarkably, this seemingly forbidden $\mathbb{Z}_q$ order emerges via a relevant operator in the infrared long-wavelength limit, rather than from an irrelevant perturbation, highlighting a non-standard route to emergence. Using large-scale corner transfer matrix renormalization group calculations, complemented by classical Monte Carlo simulations, we map the complete phase diagram and identify Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless, Ising, first-order, and unconventional Landau-incompatible transitions between different phases. Finally, we propose an effective field-theoretic framework that encompasses these emergent orders and their interwoven transitions.

Title: Unconventional Fractional Phases in Multi-Band Vortexable Systems
Authors: Siddhartha Sarkar, Xiaohan Wan, Ang-Kun Wu, Shi-Zeng Lin, Kai Sun
Abstract: In this Letter, we study topological flat bands with distinct features that deviate from conventional Landau level behavior. We show that even in the ideal quantum geometry limit, moire flat band systems can exhibit physical phenomena fundamentally different from Landau levels without lattices. In particular, we find new fractional quantum Hall states emerging from multi-band vortexable systems, where multiple exactly flat bands appear at the Fermi energy. While the set of bands as a whole exhibits ideal quantum geometry, individual bands separately lose vortexability, and thus making them very different from a stack of Landau levels. At certain filling fractions, we find fractional states whose Hall conductivity deviates from the filling factor. Through careful numerical and analytical studies, we rule out all known mechanisms--such as fractional quantum Hall crystals or separate filling of trivial and topological bands--as possible explanations. Leveraging the exact solvability of vortexable systems, we use analytic Bloch wavefunctions to uncover the origin of these new fractional states, which arises from the commensurability between the moire unit cell and the magnetic unit cell of an emergent effective magnetic field.

Title: Comment on "Electric conductivity of graphene: Kubo model versus a nonlocal quantum field theory model (arXiv:2403.02279v3)"
Authors: M.Bordag, N.Khusnutdinov, G.L.Klimchitskaya, V.M.Mostepanenko
Abstract: Recently, Rodriguez-Lopez, Wang, and Antezza [Phys. Rev. B v.111, 115428 (2025)] compared the theoretical descriptions of electric conductivity of graphene given by the Kubo model and quantum field theory in terms of the polarization tensor. According to this article, in the spatially nonlocal case, the quantum field theoretical description contains ``hard inconsistencies". By modifying the equality, which relates the conductivity and polarization expressions, the predictions of quantum field theory were revised and brought in agreement with those following from the nonrelativistic Kubo model. Here, it is shown that this modification violates the requirement of gauge invariance and, thus, is unacceptable. By comparing both theoretical approaches, we demonstrate that all the results obtained within quantum field theory are physically well justified whereas an application of the modified expression for the conductivity of graphene leads to the consequences of nonphysical character.

Title: Double Supersolid Phase in a Bosonic t-J-V Model with Rydberg Atoms
Authors: Kuangjie Chen, Yang Qi, Zheng Yan, Xiaopeng Li
Abstract: Recent advances in Rydberg tweezer arrays bring novel opportunities for programmable quantum simulations beyond previous capabilities. In this work, we investigate a bosonic t-J-V model currently realized with Rydberg atoms. Through large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we uncover an emergent double supersolid (DSS) phase with the coexistence of two superfluids and crystalline order. Tunable long-range tunneling and repulsive hole-hole interactions enable a rich phase diagram featuring a double superfluid phase, a DSS phase, and an antiferromagnetic insulator. Intriguingly, within the DSS regime we observe an unconventional thermal enhancement of crystalline order. Our results establish the bosonic t-J-V model as a promising and experimentally accessible platform for exploring exotic quantum phases in Rydberg atom arrays.

Title: Direct Thermal Imaging of Domain Wall Hot Spots in LiNbO3
Authors: Lindsey R. Lynch, J. Marty Gregg, Amit Kumar, Kristina M. Holsgrove, Raymond G. P. McQuaid
Abstract: Ferroelectric domain wall devices offer a promising route to low-voltage, reconfigurable nanoelectronics by confining currents to nanoscale conducting interfaces within an insulating bulk. However, the potential for resistive heating and unregulated temperature increases due to domain wall conduction remains unexplored. Here, scanning thermal microscopy is employed to directly image hot spots in thin-film lithium niobate domain wall devices. Piezoresponse force microscopy shows that the hot spots correlate with nanodomain structure, and thermal mapping reveals surface temperature rises of ~20 K at most, levels that are unlikely to negatively affect device performance. This is due to the moderate electrical conductivity of domain walls, their voltage-tunable erasure, and distributed current pathways, which inherently limit power dissipation and peak temperatures. Finite element electrothermal modelling indicates that domain walls behave as pseudo-planar heat sources, distinct from the filament-based heating typically observed in resistive switching oxides. These findings highlight the potential for domain wall devices as an energy-efficient, thermally stable platform for emerging memory and logic applications.

Title: From localized 4f electrons to anisotropic exchange interactions in ferromagnetic CeRh6Ge4
Authors: Shoichiro Itokazu, Akimitsu Kirikoshi, Harald O. Jeschke, Junya Otsuki
Abstract: CeRh6Ge4 is a cerium-based ferromagnetic material exhibiting a quantum critical behavior under pressure. We derive effective exchange interactions, using the framework of density functional theory combined with dynamical mean-field theory. Our results reveal that the nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic interaction along the c axis is isotropic in spin space, leading to a formation of spin chains. On the other hand, the inter-chain coupling is highly anisotropic: The in-plane moment weakly interacts ferromagnetically in the a--b plane to stabilize the ferromagnetic state, whereas the z-component couples antiferromagnetically, contributing to its destabilization. The magnetic anisotropy of the interchain interactions as well as of the local 4f wavefunctions characterizes the magnetic properties underlying the ferromagnetic transition and the quantum critical behavior in CeRh6Ge4.

Title: Granular jamming and rheology in microgravity
Authors: Olfa D'Angelo, Qing Yu, Thorsten Pöschel
Abstract: Understanding how granular materials behave in low gravity is crucial for planetary science and space exploration. It can also help us understand granular phenomena usually hidden by gravity. On Earth, gravity dominates granular behavior, but disentangling its role from intrinsic particle interactions is challenging. We present a series of compression and shear experiments conducted in microgravity using the Center of Applied Space Technology and Microgravity (ZARM) drop tower and GraviTower Bremen (GTB). Our in-house developed experimental setup enables precise measurement of packing density and in-situ shear stress via a Taylor-Couette rheometer. We find that the jamming transition occurs at lower packing density in microgravity than on Earth, confirming that gravity promotes densification. Rheological measurements further reveal that in microgravity, the lack of a secondary force field and predominance of cohesive interparticle forces increase the stress needed for granular media to flow. These findings highlight gravity's dual role in enhancing both compaction and flow, and demonstrate the need for tailored granular models, valid in low- and microgravity environments.

Title: Multiply quantized vortex spectroscopy in a quantum fluid of light
Authors: Killian Guerrero, Kevin Falque, Elisabeth Giacobino, Alberto Bramati, Maxime J Jacquet
Abstract: The formation of quantized vortices is a unifying feature of quantum mechanical systems, making it a premier means for fundamental and comparative studies of different quantum fluids. Being excited states of motion, vortices are normally unstable towards relaxation into lower energy states. However, here we exploit the driven-dissipative nature of polaritonic fluids of light to create stationary, multiply charged vortices. We measure the spectrum of collective excitations and observe negative energy modes at the core and positive energy modes at large radii. Their coexistence at the same frequency normally causes the dynamical instability, but here intrinsic losses stabilize the system, allowing for phase pinning by the pump on macroscopic scales. We observe generic features of quantized vortices in quantum fluids and other rotating geometries like astrophysical compact objects, opening the way to the study of generic amplification phenomena.

Title: Antiferron Modes in Ferroelectric Materials
Authors: David Galvez-Poblete, Mario A. Castro, Roberto E. Troncoso, Guillermo Romero, Alvaro S. Nunez, Sebastian Allende
Abstract: We introduce the concept of antiferron modes in ferroelectric materials as dynamically stabilized collective excitations over inverted polarization states that decrease the system energy. While ferrons represent quantized oscillations around the stable polarization minimum, antiferrons require dynamic stabilization via high-frequency driving. Using a generalized Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire framework, we derive the effective curvature corrections from external driving, demonstrate the conditions for stabilizing metastable wells, and present the quantized Hamiltonian. Antiferrons could be a promising candidate for developing electrical sensing devices, offering tunable, dynamically controllable excitations with high sensitivity to external electric fields.

Title: Effective permeability conditions for diffusive transport through impermeable membranes with gaps
Authors: Molly Brennan, Edwina F. Yeo, Philip Pearce, Mohit P. Dalwadi
Abstract: Membranes regulate transport in a wide variety of industrial and biological applications. The microscale geometry of the membrane can significantly affect overall transport through the membrane, but the precise nature of this multiscale coupling is not well characterised in general. Motivated by the application of transport across a bacterial membrane, in this paper we use formal multiscale analysis to derive explicit effective coupling conditions for macroscale transport across a two-dimensional impermeable membrane with periodically spaced gaps, and validate these with numerical simulations. We derive analytic expressions for effective macroscale quantities associated with the membrane, such as the permeability, in terms of the microscale geometry. Our results generalise the classic constitutive membrane coupling conditions to a wider range of membrane geometries and time-varying scenarios. Specifically, we demonstrate that if the exterior concentration varies in time, for membranes with long channels, the transport gains a memory property where the coupling conditions depend on the system history. By applying our effective conditions in the context of small molecule transport through gaps in bacterial membranes called porins, we predict that bacterial membrane permeability is primarily dominated by the thickness of the membrane. Furthermore, we predict how alterations to membrane microstructure, for example via changes to porin expression, might affect overall transport, including when external concentrations vary in time. These results will apply to a broad range of physical applications with similar membrane structures, from medical and industrial filtration to carbon capture.

Title: Multifractality in high-dimensional graphs induced by correlated radial disorder
Authors: David E. Logan, Sthitadhi Roy
Abstract: We introduce a class of models containing robust and analytically demonstrable multifractality induced by disorder correlations. Specifically, we investigate the statistics of eigenstates of disordered tight-binding models on two classes of rooted, high-dimensional graphs -- trees and hypercubes -- with a form of strong disorder correlations we term `radial disorder'. In this model, site energies on all sites equidistant from a chosen root are identical, while those at different distances are independent random variables (or their analogue for a deterministic but incommensurate potential, a case of which is also considered). Analytical arguments, supplemented by numerical results, are used to establish that this setting hosts robust and unusual multifractal states. The distribution of multifractality, as encoded in the inverse participation ratios (IPRs), is shown to be exceptionally broad. This leads to a qualitative difference in scaling with system size between the mean and typical IPRs, with the latter the appropriate quantity to characterise the multifractality. The existence of this multifractality is shown to be underpinned by an emergent fragmentation of the graphs into effective one-dimensional chains, which themselves exhibit conventional Anderson localisation. The interplay between the exponential localisation of states on these chains, and the exponential growth of the number of sites with distance from the root, is the origin of the observed multifractality.

Title: Memory-aware feedback enhances power in active information engines
Authors: Sehoon Bahng, Jae Sung Lee, Cheol-Min Ghim
Abstract: We study an information engine operating in an active bath, where a Brownian particle confined in a harmonic trap undergoes feedback-driven displacement cycles. Unlike thermal environments, active baths exhibit temporally correlated fluctuations, introducing memory effects that challenge conventional feedback strategies. Extending the framework of stochastic thermodynamics to account for such memory, we analyze a feedback protocol that periodically shifts the potential minimum based on noisy measurements of the particle's position. We show that conventional feedback schemes, optimized for memoryless thermal baths, can degrade performance in active media due to the disruption of bath-particle memory by abrupt resetting. To overcome this degradation, we introduce a class of memory-preserving feedback protocols that partially retain the covariance between the particle's displacement and active noise, thereby exploiting the temporal persistence of active fluctuations. Through asymptotic analysis, we show how the feedback gain -- which quantifies the strength of positional shifts -- nontrivially shapes the engine's work and power profiles. In particular, we demonstrate that in active media, intermediate gains outperform full-shift resetting. Our results reveal the critical interplay between bath memory, measurement noise, and feedback gain, offering guiding principles for designing high-performance information engines in nonequilibrium environments.

Title: General Learning of the Electric Response of Inorganic Materials
Authors: Bradley A. A. Martin, Alex M. Ganose, Venkat Kapil, Tingwei Li, Keith T. Butler
Abstract: We present MACE-Field, a field-aware $O(3)$-equivariant interatomic potential that provides a compact, derivative-consistent route to dielectric properties (such as polarisation $\mathbf P$, Born effective charges $Z^*$ and polarisability $\boldsymbol\alpha$) and finite-field simulations across chemistry for inorganic solids. MACE-Field preserves the standard MACE readout and can inherit existing MACE foundation weights, turning pretrained models into field-aware ones with minimal change. To demonstrate, we fine-tune MACE-MP-0 on multiple heads covering BECs and polarisabilities ($\sim$6k MP dielectrics spanning 81 elements), polarisations (2.5k MP nonpolar-to-polar polarisation branches), and energies, forces, and stresses (10,000 structure-replay set from MPtraj), resulting in a field-aware foundation model, MACE-Field-MP-0. We show that MACE-Field can evaluate polarisation branches and spontaneous polarisations, predict $Z^*$ and dielectric constants across diverse chemistries, and reproduce finite-field MD simulations, such as BaTiO$_3$ polarisation hysteresis and the IR/Raman and dielectric spectra of $\alpha$-quartz, benchmarking against Allegro-pol and DFPT.

Title: Universal Mott quantum criticality in a modified periodic Anderson model
Authors: Sujan K. K., N. S. Vidhyadhiraja
Abstract: Mott quantum criticality is a central theme in correlated electron physics, observed in systems featuring both continuous zero-temperature transitions and those with finite-temperature critical endpoints. Within dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT), the paradigmatic single-band Hubbard model (SBHM) displays such criticality only above a finite-temperature endpoint. In contrast, the modified periodic Anderson model (MPAM) is a rare example known to host a surface of genuinely continuous Mott quantum critical points (QCPs) at zero temperature. Using DMFT with the numerical renormalization group as an impurity solver, we investigate the finite-temperature, real-frequency properties of the MPAM. Our central finding is the emergence of quantum critical scaling in the electrical resistivity, with critical exponents $z_{\text{met}} = 0.76$ and $z_{\text{ins}} = 0.66$ on the metallic and insulating sides, respectively. These values fall within the range reported for the SBHM, suggesting that both transitions are governed by a common universality class. We further substantiate the presence of local quantum criticality by demonstrating robust $\omega/T$ scaling in single- and two-particle correlation functions. Finally, we identify novel transport signatures in the optical conductivity, where the distinct evolution of two isosbestic points serves as a unique fingerprint of the QCP. These results establish the MPAM as a canonical model for investigating genuine Mott quantum criticality and support the existence of a universal framework for this fundamental phenomenon.

Title: Chirality, confinement and dimensionality govern re-entrant transitions in active matter
Authors: Anweshika Pattanayak, Amir Shee, Debasish Chaudhuri, Abhishek Chaudhuri
Abstract: The non-equilibrium dynamics of individual chiral active particles underpin the complex behavior of chiral active matter. Here we present an exact analytical framework, supported by simulations, to characterize the steady states of two-dimensional chiral active Brownian particles and three-dimensional torque-driven counterparts in a harmonic trap. Using a Laplace-transform approach of the Fokker-Planck equation, we derive closed-form expressions for displacement moments and excess kurtosis, providing a precise probe of non-Gaussian statistics. Our analysis reveals three distinct regimes: bimodal active states with off-center peaks, Gaussian-like passive states, and weakly heavy-tailed distributions unique to two dimensions. We show that dimensionality plays a decisive role: in two dimensions, increasing chirality suppresses activity and restores passive behavior, while in three dimensions torque preserves activity along the torque axis, producing anisotropic steady states. These behaviors are captured by simple active length-scale arguments that map the boundaries between passive and active phases. Our results offer concrete experimental signatures - including kurtosis crossovers, off-center peaks, and torque-induced anisotropy - that establish confinement as a powerful tool to probe and control chiral and torque-driven active matter.

Title: Magneto-optical Kerr-effect measurements under pulsed magnetic fields over 40 T using a compact sample fixture
Authors: Atsutoshi Ikeda, Sota Nakamura, Soichiro Yamane, Kosuke Noda, Akihiko Ikeda, Shingo Yonezawa
Abstract: The magnetic field is one of the most fundamental control parameters in materials science. A pulsed magnetic-field apparatus can generate high magnetic fields that are inaccessible by conventional DC-field magnets. One important issue is that measurement techniques compatible with pulsed fields are rather limited due to short pulse duration and large electromagnetic or mechanical noise originating from field pulses. The magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE), the change in the state of light polarization upon reflection from magnetic materials, has the potential to become a powerful tool for investigation of magnetic properties of a wide range of materials including non-transparent materials or thin films in pulsed fields. Nevertheless, since the MOKE response is typically very small, MOKE measurements under pulsed fields are quite challenging. Here, we present a new method to measure polar MOKE under high pulsed magnetic fields of 2-ms pulse width. The keys of this new technique are a ferrule-based compact sample-fiber fixture and a phase-resolved numerical lock-in analysis, combined with the high-resolution optical apparatus based on an all-fiber loop-less Sagnac interferometer. We succeeded in measuring MOKE signals from various ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic samples above 40 T and down to 77 K, significantly extending the limits of previously reported pulse-field MOKE measurements. Our apparatus is simple enough to be compatible with larger-scale experiments in pulse-field facilities, thus becoming a new promising tool to optically investigate material properties in pulsed fields.

Title: GoodRegressor: A General-Purpose Symbolic Regression Framework for Physically Interpretable Materials Modeling
Authors: Seong-Hoon Jang
Abstract: Symbolic regression offers a promising route toward interpretable machine learning, yet existing methods suffer from poor predictability and computational intractability when exploring large expression spaces. I introduce GoodRegressor, a general-purpose C++-based framework that resolves these limitations while preserving full physical interpretability. By combining hierarchical descriptor construction, interaction discovery, nonlinear transformations, statistically rigorous model selection, and stacking ensemble, GoodRegressor efficiently explores symbolic model spaces such as $1.44 \times 10^{457}$, $5.99 \times 10^{124}$, and $4.20 \times 10^{430}$ possible expressions for oxygen-ion conductors, NASICONs, and superconducting oxides, respectively. Across these systems, it produces compact equations that surpass state-of-the-art black-box models and symbolic regressors, improving $R^2$ by $4 \sim 40$ %. The resulting expressions reveal physical insights, for example, into oxygen-ion transport through coordination environment and lattice flexibility. Independent ensemble runs yield nearly identical regressed values and the identical top-ranked candidate, demonstrating high reproducibility. With scalability up to $10^{4392}$ choices without interaction terms, GoodRegressor provides a foundation for general-purpose interpretable machine intelligence.

Title: $C_{3}$-Symmetry-induced Antisymmetric Planar Hall effect and Magnetoresistance in Single-Crystalline Ferromagnets
Authors: W. J. Qin, B. Yang, Y. Z. Tian, B. W. Zheng, K. Y. Wang, B. Y. Huang, Y. B. Yang, W. Q. Zou, D. Wu, P. Wang
Abstract: The planar Hall effect (PHE) is typically symmetric under magnetic field reversal, as required by the Onsager reciprocity relations. Recent advances have identified the antisymmetric PHE (under magnetic field reversal) as an intriguing extension in magnetic systems. While new mechanisms have been proposed, the role of conventional anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) in this phenomenon remains unclear. Here, we report the experimental discovery of an antisymmetric (with respect to both magnetic field and magnetization) PHE and magnetoresistance in single-crystal $Co_{30}Pt_{70}$ (111) thin films with $C_{3}$ rotational symmetry and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). We demonstrate that both antisymmetric effects arise naturally from the intrinsic fourth-rank AMR tensor inherent to C3-symmetric planes, assisted by PMA. Our findings link conventional AMR to antisymmetric galvanomagnetic responses, offering new insights into symmetry-governed transport in crystalline ferromagnets.

Title: Surface wakes on ultra-soft solids
Authors: Aditi Chakrabarti, Divya Jaganathan, Robert Haussman, L. Mahadevan
Abstract: We explore the dynamical response of the free surface of an ultra-soft solid driven by a localized moving pressure disturbance. Experiments reveal a steady V-shaped wake analogous to a surface Mach wedge. A simple geometric argument provides a qualitative explanation consistent with observations. A theoretical framework combining elastodynamic, capillary, and gravitational effects yields a generalized dispersion relation that smoothly interpolates between Kelvin's theory of liquid interface wakes and Rayleigh's theory of elastic surface waves. Together, our experiments and theory reveal the existence of a soft wake regime that bridges fluid and solid surface wave physics, offering new routes for probing the dynamics of soft surfaces.

Title: Leveraging the Bi$_2$O$_3$--Fe$_2$O$_3$ Phase Diagram to Tailor BiFeO$_3$ Structure and Dielectric Response
Authors: Subir Majumder, Paul Ben Ishai, Gilad Orr
Abstract: Advancing the functional performance of bismuth ferrite (BiFeO$_3$) requires precise control over phase stability and microstructure, challenges often complicated by secondary phase formation within the Bi$_2$O$_3$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ system. In this work, we employ a phase-diagram-guided synthesis strategy to clarify the processing-structure-property relationships governing BiFeO$_3$ ceramics. Based on previous reports and our experimental observations, a refined Bi$_2$O$_3$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ phase diagram was constructed identifing the onset of liquid-phase formation near 835$^\circ$C in Bi-rich compositions. Solid-state synthesis using non-stoichiometric precursor ratios (55$\colon$45 and 70$\colon$30 Bi$_2$O$_3$ $\colon$ Fe$_2$O$_3$) reveals that the 55$\colon$45 composition sintered at 775$^\circ$C favours phase-pure rhombohedral $R3c$ BiFeO$_3$ with suppressed sillenite- and mullite-type impurities, lattice contraction, and improved grain uniformity. These structural refinements result in near-Debye dielectric relaxation and a four-orders-of-magnitude enhancement in electrical conductivity relative to lower-temperature or Bi-rich conditions. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of phase-diagram control as a scalable route to tuning dielectric response in BFO-based multiferroics and provides a foundation for processing optimization in complex oxide ceramics.

Title: Crystal Growth and Physical Properties of Orthorhombic Kagome Lattice Magnets $R$Fe$_6$Ge$_6$ ($R$=Y, Tb, Dy)
Authors: Abhijeet Nayak, Sk Jamaluddin, Fan Wu, Emily Rapp, Resham Babu Regmi, Mohamed El Gazzah, Bence G. Márkus, László Forró, Madhav P. Ghimire, Allen Oliver, Kateryna Foyevtsova, Igor I. Mazin, Nirmal J. Ghimire
Abstract: Kagome magnets represent a promising class of materials that exhibit intriguing electronic and magnetic properties, and they have recently garnered significant attention. While most kagome-lattice compounds are hexagonal, we report here single-crystal growth and physical property measurements of $R$Fe$_6$Ge$_6$ ($R$ = Y, Dy, Tb) compounds, which crystallize in an orthorhombic structure. The structure can be derived from a hexagonal prototype $R$Fe$_3$Ge$_2$ by replacing every other $R$ atom with a covalent Ge$_2$ dimer. Ordering of these dimers renders the structure orthorhombic, slightly distorts the kagome net, and makes the three Fe sites formally inequivalent. The iron and rare-earth sublattices order independently. Fe moments order above 400 K, forming ferromagnetic kagome planes stacked antiferromagnetically, while rare-earth moments order below 9 K. TbFe$_6$Ge$_6$ exhibits a single magnetic ordering transition associated with the Tb atoms, whereas DyFe$_6$Ge$_6$ shows two distinct magnetic phase transitions, strongly influenced by crystal electric field effects on the Dy$^{3+}$ ions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the ferromagnetic ordering of the Fe planes is driven by a high density of states at the Fermi energy. They also reveal three dramatically different structural energy scales: $R$ and Ge$_2$ form alternating 1D chains perpendicular to the kagome planes, and violating this alternation incurs a large energy cost. Aligning these chains is less costly, and achieving a two-dimensional order of anti-aligned chains requires very little energy. These compounds represent a unique class of materials, offering new opportunities to investigate the interplay between the distinct crystal lattice geometry and the underlying electronic and magnetic properties.

Title: Floquet-engineered Valley Topology with Anisotropic Response in 1T'-WSe$_2$ and Janus WSeTe monolayers
Authors: Zhe Li, Haijun Cao, Lijuan Li, Huixia Fu, Mengxue Guan, Sheng Meng
Abstract: Valley topology has emerged as a key concept for realizing new classes of quantum states. Here, we investigate Floquet-engineered topological phase transitions in anisotropic 1T'-WSe$_2$ and its Janus derivative WSeTe monolayers, which exhibit valley-degenerate and valley-polarized characteristics, respectively. In 1T'-WSe$_2$, a single topological-phase-transition (TPT) occurs from the quantum-spin-Hall state (QSH) to the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) state, involving one spin channel at both valleys simultaneously. In contrast, Janus WSeTe undergoes a two-stage Floquet-driven TPT that occurs within a single valley and sequentially involves two spin components. The intermediate phase manifests as a valley-polarized QAH (vp-QAH) state with a finite valley Chern number, while the final phase evolves into a high-Chern-number QAH state with distinct valley gaps. Furthermore, an in-plane anisotropic response of the TPTs is predicted under oblique light incidence, reflecting the intrinsic low-symmetry nature of the lattice. These findings provide a comprehensive understanding of Floquet-engineered valley-based topological properties and offer guidance for designing light-controllable valleytronic and topological devices.

Title: Inverse design of flat-foldable thick origami with smooth curved surface
Authors: Byoung-Gyu Kim, Geon Hee Cho, Hak-Tae Lee, Jinkyu Yang
Abstract: Origami as a deployable structure offers the unique advantage of achieving compact stowage via flat-folding while forming a well-defined surface composed of rigid panels upon deployment. However, since origami consists of flat facets, it is inherently limited in forming smooth curved surfaces upon deployment. This limitation restricts its applicability in systems where smooth curved geometries are essential for performance, such as aerospace systems and electromagnetic communication devices. Herein, we propose an inverse design methodology for thick origami that is capable of flat-folding while forming a smooth curved outer surface upon deployment. By establishing flat-foldable constraints that specify the positions of the creases, our method constructs thick origami capable of flat-folding even with panels that include a curved facet. Furthermore, by representing the origami layout as a graph, we enumerate all possible origami configurations and enable flexible design of the internal structure. Analytical results show that the optimized packaging ratio increases as the number of cells in a layout increases, indicating that the proposed design methodology provides controllability over the packaging ratio through the number of cells. Using our proposed design methodology, we fabricated a deployable origami wing and demonstrated its functionality through successful flight testing, in which the wing was subjected to aerodynamic loads. Our work proposes a new strategy for packaging smooth curved surfaces, addressing the packaging challenges encountered in aerospace and electromagnetic communications and thereby providing greater design freedom.

Title: Crystal Orbital Guided Iteration to Atomic Orbitals
Authors: Emily Oliphant, Emmanouil Kioupakis, Wenhao Sun
Abstract: Atomic orbitals underpin our understanding of electronic structure, providing intuitive descriptions of bonding, charge transfer, magnetism, and correlation effects. Despite their utility, an atomic basis that is adaptable, strictly localized on atomic centers, and enables accurate tight-binding interpolation has remained elusive. Here, we introduce Crystal Orbital Guided Iteration To atomic-Orbitals (COGITO), a framework that constructs an optimal atomic orbital basis by identifying and resolving key mathematical obstacles inherent to nonorthogonal bases--particularly uncontrolled orbital mixing, and the fixed-overlap constraint between orbitals. We demonstrate that COGITO enables tight-binding models as accurate as MLWF-based approaches, while preserving the ability of tight-binding parameters to represent the projected atomic basis--an essential feature lost in schemes that enforce orbital orthogonality or maximal localization. By creating accurate and chemically interpretable models of electronic structure, COGITO reveals the orbital-resolved covalent bonds and charge transfer that is encoded in the Kohn-Sham wavefunctions of DFT. Our method thus offers a powerful tool for any physics- or chemistry-based application that relies on a faithful description of local electronic structure.

Title: How elasticity affects bubble pinch-off
Authors: Coen I. Verschuur (1), Alexandros T. Oratis (1), Vatsal Sanjay (1), Jacco H. Snoeijer (1) ((1) Physics of fluids department, University of Twente, Enschede, The Netherlands)
Abstract: The pinch-off of bubbles in viscoelastic liquids is a fundamental process that has received little attention compared to viscoelastic drop pinch-off. While these processes exhibit qualitative similarities, the dynamics of the pinch-off process are fundamentally different. When a drop of a dilute polymer solution pinches off, a thread is known to develop that prevents breakup due the diverging polymer stresses. Conversely, our experiments reveal that this thread is absent for bubble pinch-off in dilute polymer solutions. We show that a thread becomes apparent only for high polymer concentrations, where the pinch-off dynamics become very sensitive to the size of the needle from which the bubble detaches. The experiments are complemented by numerical simulations and analytical modeling using the Oldroyd-B model, which capture the dilute regime. The model shows that polymer stresses are still singular during bubble pinch-off, but the divergence is much weaker as compared to drop pinch-off. This explains why, in contrast to droplets, viscoelastic bubble-threads do not appear for dilute suspensions but require large polymer concentrations

Title: Functional Renormalization Group Approach for Signal Detection
Authors: Vincent Lahoche, Dine Ousmane Samary, Mohamed Tamaazousti
Abstract: This review paper uses renormalization group techniques for signal detection in nearly-continuous positive spectra. We highlight universal aspects of the analogue field-theory approach. The first aim is to present an extended self-consistent construction of the analogue effective field-theory framework for data, which can be viewed as a maximum entropy model. In particular and exploiting universality arguments, we justify the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetry of the classical action and we stress the existence of a large-scale (local) regime and of a small-scale (nonlocal) regime. Secondly and related to noise models, we observe the universal relation between phase transition and symmetry breaking in the vicinity of the detection threshold. Finally, we discuss the issue of defining the covariance matrix for tensorial-like data. Based on the cutting graph prescription, we note the superiority of definitions based on complete graphs of large size for data analysis.

Title: Quantifying Broken Detailed Balance in Transcription
Authors: James Holehouse
Abstract: For the canonical two-state model of transcription, we derive exact analytic expressions for the entropy production rate of transcription at steady state, and assess detailed balance breaking in transcription. Our analytics allow us to easily evaluate the entropy production rate of thousands of genes across seven datasets of two-state model parameters without needing to evaluate the entropy production rate from trajectory-based computation. A data-driven approach then exposes that most genes avoid parameter regimes associated with large entropy production rates, akin to a mesoscopic version of energy expenditure minimization. Importantly, we show that this is not a thermodynamic phenomenon, since the entropy production rate from the two state gene model provides only a weak bound on the housekeeping energy needed to power transcription. Finally, we show that cell-to-cell variability can make mRNA expression seem more or less irreversible than a ``representative cell'' would imply.

Title: Spectral Riemann Surface Topology of Gapped Non-Hermitian Systems
Authors: Anton Montag, Alexander Felski, Flore K. Kunst
Abstract: We show topological configurations of the complex-valued spectra in gapped non-Hermitian systems. These arise when the distinctive EPs in the energy Riemann surfaces of such models are annihilated after threading them across the boundary of the Brillouin zone. This results in a non-trivially closed branch cut that is protected by an energy gap in the spectrum. Their presence or absence establishes topologically distinct configurations for fully non-degenerate systems and tuning between them requires a closing of the gap, forming exceptional point degeneracies. We provide an outlook toward experimental realizations in metasurfaces and single-photon interferometry.

Title: Reweighted Time-Evolving Block Decimation for Improved Quantum Dynamics Simulations
Authors: Sayak Guha Roy, Kevin Slagle
Abstract: We introduce a simple yet significant improvement to the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) tensor network algorithm for simulating the time dynamics of strongly correlated one-dimensional (1D) mixed quantum states. The efficiency of 1D tensor network methods stems from using a product of matrices to express either: the coefficients of a wavefunction, yielding a matrix product state (MPS); or the expectation values of a density matrix, yielding a matrix product density operator (MPDO). To avoid exponential computational costs, TEBD truncates the matrix dimension while simulating the time evolution. However, when truncating a MPDO, TEBD does not favor the likely more important low-weight expectation values, such as $\langle c_i^\dagger c_j \rangle$, over the exponentially many high-weight expectation values, such as $\langle c_{i_1}^\dagger c^\dagger_{i_2} \cdots c_{i_n} \rangle$ of weight $n$, despite the critical importance of the low-weight expectation values. Motivated by this shortcoming, we propose a reweighted TEBD (rTEBD) algorithm that deprioritizes high-weight expectation values by a factor of $\gamma^{-n}$ during the truncation. This simple modification (which only requires reweighting certain matrices by a factor of $\gamma$ in the MPDO) makes rTEBD significantly more accurate than the TEBD time-dependent simulation of an MPDO, and competive with and sometimes better than TEBD using MPS. Furthermore, by prioritizing low-weight expectation values, rTEBD preserves conserved quantities to high precision.

Title: Universal efficiency boost in prethermal quantum heat engines at negative temperature
Authors: Alberto Brollo, Adolfo del Campo, Alvise Bastianello
Abstract: Heat engines near the adiabatic limit typically assume a working medium at thermal equilibrium. However, quantum many-body systems often showcase conservation laws that hinder thermalization, leading to prethermalization in exotic stationary phases. This work explores whether prethermalization enhances or reduces engine efficiency. We investigate Otto cycles in quantum systems with varying numbers of conserved quantities. We find that additional conservation laws reduce efficiency at positive temperatures, but enhance it in regimes of negative temperatures. Our findings stem from general thermodynamic inequalities for infinitesimal cycles, and we provide evidence for integrable models undergoing finite cycles using the theoretical framework of Generalized Hydrodynamics. The relevance of our results for quantum simulators is also discussed.

Title: Emergence of Cascading Flat Bands in Breathing Superlattices
Authors: Moru Song, Jingyu Hu, Lina Shi, YongliangZhang, Kai Chang
Abstract: Flat bands have become a pillar of modern condensed matter physics and photonics owing to the vanishing group velocity and diverging density of states. Here, we present a paradigmatic scheme to construct arbitrary flat bands on demand by introducing a new type breathing superlattice, where both the number and spectral positions of isolated flat bands can be continuously tailored by simply controlling the breathing strength. Microscopically, the momentum-independent interband scatterings near the band edge protect them robust against weak intra-cell disorder. By dimensional reduction, we establish a duality between the one-dimensional (1D) breathing superlattice and the 2D Harper-Hofstadter model, where cascade flat bands naturally emerge as the different orders of Landau levels in the weak magnetic flux limit. As a proof of concept, photonic flat bands at optical frequencies are experimentally demonstrated with all-dielectric photonic crystal slabs. Finally, we generalize our scheme to 2D systems to realize partial and omnidirectional flat bands, and discuss the achievement of high-quality factors. Our findings shed new light on the manipulation of flat bands with high band flatness and large usable bandwidth, paving the way for the development of advanced optical devices.

Title: Tailoring Heat Transfer at Silica-Water Interfaces via Hydroxyl and Methyl Surface Groups
Authors: Viktor Mandrolko, Konstantinos Termentzidis, David Lacroix, Mykola Isaiev
Abstract: Efficient thermal transport across solid-liquid interfaces is essential for optimizing heat dissipation in modern technological applications. This study employs molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the impact of surface functionalization on heat transfer at the silica/water interface. It has been shown that the surface functionalization changes significantly the wetting characteristics of silica surface: from one hand hydroxyl groups render such surfaces more hydrophilic, while methyl groups more hydrophobic. Here, we reveal that modifying the surface functionalization from methylated to hydroxylated groups results in: (i) up to an approximately eightfold increase in adhesion energy, (ii) a reorientation of interfacial water molecules to align perpendicular to the surface normal, (iii) a reduction in the liquid depletion length near the interface, and (iv) an overall enhancement of interfacial heat conduction. We quantify interfacial thermal resistance through the calculation of the contribution of each functional group to the total heat flux, providing insights into the physical mechanisms governing heat transfer at functionalized interfaces. We demonstrated that manipulation of the concentrations of the functional groups can be used to tailor interfacial thermal transport.

Title: Complexity transitions in chaotic quantum systems: Nonstabilizerness, entanglement, and fractal dimension in SYK and random matrix models
Authors: Gopal Chandra Santra, Alex Windey, Soumik Bandyopadhyay, Andrea Legramandi, Philipp Hauke
Abstract: Complex quantum systems -- composed of many, interacting particles -- are intrinsically difficult to model. When a quantum many-body system is subject to disorder, it can undergo transitions to regimes with varying non-ergodic and localized behavior, which can significantly reduce the number of relevant basis states. It remains an open question whether such transitions are also directly related to an abrupt change in the system's complexity. In this work, we study the transition from chaotic to integrable phases in several paradigmatic models, the power-law random banded matrix model, the Rosenzweig--Porter model, and a hybrid SYK+Ising model, comparing three complementary complexity markers -- fractal dimension, von Neumann entanglement entropy, and stabilizer Rényi entropy. For all three markers, finite-size scaling reveals sharp transitions between high- and low-complexity regimes, which, however, can occur at different critical points. As a consequence, while in the ergodic and localized regimes the markers align, they diverge significantly in the presence of an intermediate fractal phase. Additionally, our analysis reveals that the stabilizer Rényi entropy is more sensitive to underlying many-body symmetries, such as fermion parity and time reversal, than the other markers. As our results show, different markers capture complementary facets of complexity, making it necessary to combine them to obtain a comprehensive diagnosis of phase transitions. The divergence between different complexity markers also has significant consequences for the classical simulability of chaotic many-body systems.

Title: Quantum Circuits for the Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm
Authors: Baptiste Claudon, Pablo Rodenas-Ruiz, Jean-Philip Piquemal, Pierre Monmarché
Abstract: Szegedy's quantization of a reversible Markov chain provides a quantum walk whose mixing time is quadratically smaller than that of the classical walk. Quantum computers are therefore expected to provide a speedup of Metropolis-Hastings (MH) simulations. Existing generic methods to implement the quantum walk require coherently computing the acceptance probabilities of the underlying Markov kernel. However, reversible computing methods require a number of qubits that scales with the complexity of the computation. This overhead is undesirable in near-term fault-tolerant quantum computing, where few logical qubits are available. In this work, we present a quantum walk construction which follows the classical proposal-acceptance logic, does not require further reversible computing methods, and uses a constant-sized ancilla register. Since each step of the quantum walk uses a constant number of proposition and acceptance steps, we expect the end-to-end quadratic speedup to hold for MH Markov Chain Monte-Carlo simulations.

Title: High-fidelity entanglement and coherent multi-qubit mapping in an atom array
Authors: Aruku Senoo, Alexander Baumgärtner, Joanna W. Lis, Gaurav M. Vaidya, Zhongda Zeng, Giuliano Giudici, Hannes Pichler, Adam M. Kaufman
Abstract: Neutral atoms in optical tweezer arrays possess broad applicability for quantum information science, in computing, simulation, and metrology. Among atomic species, Ytterbium-171 is unique as it hosts multiple qubits, each of which is impactful for these distinct applications. Consequently, this atom is an ideal candidate to bridge multiple disciplines, which, more broadly, has been an increasingly effective strategy within the field of quantum science. Realizing the full potential of this synergy requires high-fidelity generation and transfer of many-particle entanglement between these distinct qubit degrees of freedom, and thus between these distinct applications. Here we demonstrate the creation and coherent mapping of entangled quantum states across multiple qubits in Ytterbium-171 tweezer arrays. We map entangled states onto the optical clock qubit from the nuclear spin qubit or the Rydberg qubit. We coherently transfer up to 20 atoms of a $Z_2$-ordered Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state from the interacting Rydberg manifold to the metastable nuclear spin manifold. The many-body state is generated via a novel disorder-robust pulse in a two-dimensional ladder geometry. We further find that clock-qubit-based spin detection applied to Rydberg and nuclear spin qubits facilitates atom-loss-detectable qubit measurements and $>90\%$ Rydberg decay detection. This enables mid-circuit and delayed erasure detection, yielding an error-detected two-qubit gate fidelity of $99.78(4)\%$ in the metastable qubits. This error detection also enables Rydberg qubit evolution with an effective lifetime of $1.2(2)$ ms, enhancing the fidelity of the observed many-body dynamics. These results establish a versatile architecture that advances multiple fields of quantum information science while also establishing bridges between them.

Title: Trion quantum coherence in site-controlled pyramidal InGaAs quantum dots
Authors: R. A. Barcan, I. Samaras, K. Barr, G. Juska, E. Pelucchi, K. G. Lagoudakis
Abstract: Deterministically positioned pyramidal InGaAs quantum dots (QDs) exhibit exceptional quantum properties, making them highly promising candidates for scalable on-chip quantum information processing. In this work, we investigate the coherent dynamics of positively charged excitons under the influence of strong magnetic fields in the Faraday configuration. Pyramidal quantum dots exhibit a fourfold splitting of the charged excitons even in the Faraday configuration, giving rise to an optically addressable double-Lambda{\Lambda} system akin to self-assembled quantum dots in oblique magnetic fields. Here, we investigate ultrafast complete coherent control of the trion to ground state transition utilizing advanced optical resonant excitation techniques and we observe quantum coherence over timescales that are similar to other prominent quantum dot platforms. These results pave the way towards establishing site-controlled pyramidal InGaAs QDs as scalable platforms for quantum information processing, expanding the reach of coherent control to new quantum systems.

Title: Robust Chiral Edge Dynamics of a Kitaev Honeycomb on a Trapped Ion Processor
Authors: Ammar Ali, Joe Gibbs, Keerthi Kumaran, Varadharajan Muruganandam, Bo Xiao, Paul Kairys, Gábor Halász, Arnab Banerjee, Phillip C. Lotshaw
Abstract: Kitaev's honeycomb model is a paradigmatic exactly solvable system hosting a quantum spin liquid with non-Abelian anyons and topologically protected edge modes, offering a platform for fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, real candidate Kitaev materials invariably include complex secondary interactions that obscure the realization of spin-liquid behavior and demand novel quantum computational approaches for efficient simulation. Here we report quantum simulations of a 22-site Kitaev honeycomb lattice on a trapped-ion quantum processor, without and with non-integrable Heisenberg interactions that are present in real materials. We develop efficient quantum circuits for ground-state preparation, achieving high accuracy with energy errors equivalent to an effective temperature of 0.2 (in units of the Kitaev interactions), consistent with the experimentally relevant spin-liquid regime. Starting from these states, we apply controlled perturbations and measure time-dependent spin correlations along the system's edge. In the non-Abelian phase, we observe chiral edge dynamics consistent with a non-zero Chern number, a hallmark of topological order, which vanishes upon transition to the Abelian toric code phase. Extending to the non-integrable Kitaev-Heisenberg model, we find that weak Heisenberg interactions preserve chiral edge dynamics, while stronger couplings suppress them, signaling the breakdown of topological protection. Our work demonstrates a viable route for probing dynamical signatures of topological order in quantum spin liquids using programmable quantum hardware, opening new pathways for quantum simulation of strongly correlated materials.

Title: Unlocking inaccessible performance of the quantum refrigerator with catalysts
Authors: Cong Fu, Ousi Pan, Zhiqiang Fan, Yushun Tang, Shanhe Su, Youhui Lin, Jincan Chen
Abstract: Quantum thermal machines offer promising platforms for exploring the fundamental limits of thermodynamics at the microscopic scale. The previous study demonstrated that the incorporation of a catalyst can significantly enhance the performance of a heat engine by broadening its operational regime and achieving a more favorable trade-off between work output and efficiency. Building on this powerful framework and innovative idea, here we further extend the concept to a two-stroke quantum refrigerator that extracts heat from a cold reservoir via discrete strokes powered by external work. The working medium consists of two two-level systems (TLSs) and two heat reservoirs at different temperatures and is assisted by an auxiliary system acting as a catalyst. Remarkably, the catalyst remains unchanged after each cycle, ensuring that heat extraction is driven entirely by the work input. We show that the presence of the catalyst leads to two significant enhancements: it enables the coefficient of performance (COP) and cooling capacity to exceed the Otto bound and allows the refrigerator to operate in frequency and temperature regimes that are inaccessible without a catalyst. Furthermore, through a comparison with catalytic heat engines, our analysis reveals that two distinct permutation types are necessary to simultaneously enhance the COP and operational range of refrigerators, in contrast to heat engines for which a single permutation suffices. These results highlight the potential of catalytic mechanisms to broaden the operational capabilities of quantum thermal devices and to surpass conventional thermodynamic performance limits.

Title: Simulating the interplay of dipolar and quadrupolar interactions in NMR by spin dynamic mean-field theory
Authors: Timo Gräßer, Götz S. Uhrig
Abstract: The simulation of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments is a notoriously difficult task, if many spins participate in the dynamics. The recently established dynamic mean-field theory for high-temperature spin systems (spinDMFT) represents an efficient yet accurate method to deal with this scenario. SpinDMFT reduces a complex lattice system to a time-dependent single-site problem, which can be solved numerically with small computational effort. Since the approach retains local quantum degrees of freedom, a quadrupolar term can be exactly incorporated. This allows us to study the interplay of dipolar and quadrupolar interactions for any parameter range, i.e., without the need for a perturbative treatment. We obtain a remarkable agreement with experimental data for an aluminium nitride monocrystal, which strongly suggests the use of spinDMFT as a prediction tool. Furthermore, we draw a comparison between a quantum-mechanical and a classical version of spinDMFT showing that local quantum effects are of great importance for the studied type of system.

Title: Tsunami Solitons Emerging from Superconducting Gap
Authors: Daisuke A. Takahashi
Abstract: We propose a classical integrable system exhibiting tsunami-like solitons with a rocky-desert-like disordered stationary background. One of the Lax operators describing this system is interpretable as a Bogoliubov--de Gennes Hamiltonian in parity-mixed superconductors. The family of integrable equations is generated from this seed operator using Krichever's method, whose pure $s$-wave limit includes the coupled Schrödinger--Boussinesq hierarchy applied to plasma physics. A linearly unstable finite background with a superconducting gap supports the tsunami-soliton solution, where the propagation of the step structure turns back at a certain moment, accompanied with the oscillation on the opposite side. In addition, the equation allows inhomogeneous stationary solutions with an arbitrary number of bumps at arbitrary positions, which we term \textit{the Korteweg--de Vries (KdV) rocks}. In the Zakharov--Shabat scheme, the tsunami solitons are created from the Bogoliubov quasiparticles in the energy gap and the KdV rocks from normal electrons/holes. The unexpected large space of stationary solutions originates from the non-coprime Lax pair and the multivalued Baker--Akhiezer functions on the Riemann surface, formulated in terms of higher-rank holomorphic bundles by Krichever and Novikov. Furthermore, the concept of \textit{isodispersive phases} is introduced to characterize quasiperiodic multi-tsunami backgrounds and consider their classification.

Abstract: A quantum electrodynamical time-dependent density functional theory framework is applied to describe strongly coupled light--matter interactions in cavity environments. The formalism utilizes a tensor product approach, coupling real-space electronic wave functions with Fock space photonic states. Various molecular systems serve as test cases to examine how coupling parameters and cavity frequencies affect molecular geometry, polaritonic spectra, and intermolecular binding.

Title: ChromRec: Self-Assembly of Nucleosomes Driven by Directional Recognition
Authors: Hesam Arabzadeh, Dmitri Kireev
Abstract: Understanding chromatin dynamics across multiple spatiotemporal scales requires models that reconcile biological specificity with physics-based interactions and computational tractability. We present a modular, recognition-enabled ultra-coarse-grained (UCG) framework that captures both histone-DNA and histone-histone interactions using site-specific, off-center "recognition" potentials. These \textit{recognition} sites, combined with generic attractive and repulsive terms, encode directional and stoichiometrically faithful assembly rules. Benchmark simulations demonstrate that this scheme robustly drives the self-assembly of geometrically correct histone octamers and enables stable nucleosome formation. The model also supports tunable resolution, allowing simplification of intra-octamer, nucleosomal, or fiber-level structures depending on the biological question to be addressed. This flexibility is especially useful for exploring chromatin reorganization driven by epigenetic regulation. While developed with chromatin in mind, our framework generalizes to other multivalent assemblies governed by molecular recognition.

Abstract: We establish a sharp criterion for the stability of a class of compactly supported, homogeneous density``minimal compact solitons'' or MCS states, of the time-dependent discrete nonlinear Schrödinger equation on a multi-lattice, $\mathbb L$ ($\mathbb L$-DNLS). MCS states arise for multi-lattices where a nearest neighbor Laplace-type operator on $\mathbb L$ has a flat band. Our stability criterion is in terms of the explicit form of the nonlinearity and the projection of distinguished vectors onto the flat band eigenspace. We apply our general results to MCS states of DNLS for the diamond, Kagom{é} and checkerboard lattices. In lattices where MCS states are unstable, we demonstrate how to engineer the nonlinearity to stabilize small amplitude MCS states. Finally, via systematic numerical computations, we put our analytical results in the context of global bifurcation diagrams.

Title: Simulating droplet adhesion on superhydrophobic surfaces
Authors: Pawan Kumar, Joseph D. Berry
Abstract: A numerical model is proposed to simulate the adhesion, compression, and subsequent detachment of a micro-liter droplet from a superhydrophobic surface composed of chemically homogeneous pillars arranged in a periodic fashion, replicating a typical force probe microscopy experiment. We observe that as the droplet is pulled away from the surface, the net vertical force varies in a typical sawtooth manner with peculiar peaks and troughs, characteristic of the surface. The force first reaches a maximum before the droplet detaches from the surface with a comparatively lower force. The force variation predicted by the numerical model is in good agreement with the experimental results of Kumar et al. [1]. We also studied the effect of evaporation on the variation in the adhesion force by simulating an evaporating droplet on a superhydrophobic surface. For an evaporating droplet, the numerically predicted maximum and detachment force magnitudes are in good agreement with those obtained experimentally when we take into account the change in the droplet weight as it evaporates. The proposed method will be useful for the quantitative analysis and design of a variety of superhydrophobic surfaces and will pave the way for more accurate surface characterization based on droplet adhesion force measurements.

Title: Probing superhydrophobic surface topography using droplet adhesion
Authors: Pawan Kumar, Marta Krasowska, Joseph D. Berry
Abstract: Understanding contact line dynamics on superhydrophobic surfaces with microscopic structures is essential for designing materials with reduced drag, anti-icing, self-cleaning, and anti-fouling properties. Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate that forces on droplets receding over structured surfaces are governed by microscale deformations near the contact line. We present and experimentally validate an expression demonstrating that adhesion force increases logarithmically with pillar area fraction at constant droplet volume and pillar surface chemistry. Furthermore, we establish that the average tensile force measured in direct force measurements provides a more reliable indicator of surface structure than the commonly used maximum force. This newfound insight enables precise quantification of superhydrophobic surface structure using a droplet probe.
