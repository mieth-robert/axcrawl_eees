Title: Transition from MOS to Ideal Capacitor Behavior Triggered by Tunneling in the Inversion Population Regime
Authors: Pedro Pereyra
Abstract: An analytical solution to the nonlinear Poisson equation governing the inversion layer in metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) structures has recently been obtained, resolving a fundamental challenge in semiconductor theory first identified in 1955. This breakthrough enables the derivation of explicit expressions for relevant physical quantities, such as the inversion-layer width, electric potential, and charge distribution, as functions of gate voltage $V_G$, distance from oxide-semiconductor interface and impurity concentration. These quantities exhibit rapid variation during early-stage inversion but saturate once the gate voltage exceeds the threshold voltage by a few tenths of a volt signaling a transition in the MOS response to $V_G$. The onset of tunneling through the Esaki barrier leads to increased charge accumulation near the interface, reshaping the charge distribution into a two-dimensional profile and shifting the potential drop from the semiconductor to the oxide layer. This reconfiguration resembles the behavior of an ideal parallel-plate capacitor, with charge confined at the interface and the voltage drop localized across the oxide. We analyze this mechanism in detail and demonstrate, through explicit calculations, that the tunneling current through the Esaki-like barrier formed during inversion becomes dominant, effectively superseding classical inversion behavior. These results offer a new analytical foundation for quantum-aware device modeling and inform the design of next-generation MOSFET and tunneling FET architectures.

Title: High-order coupling as a driver for Mott insulating behavior in Holography
Authors: Lin-Yue Bai, René Meyer, Zhen-Hua Zhou
Abstract: We construct a simple holographic model incorporating higher-order coupling terms for electron self-interactions. It can exhibit typical behavior of a Mott insulator, including a metal-insulator transition and a decrease in DC conductivity with the increase of charge density. In the analysis of AC conductivity, a soft gap is generally observed. Notably, when the DC conductivity approaches zero, the AC conductivity reveals a multi-peak structure, which can be attributed to the Mott and charge-transfer gaps observed experimentally in transition metals. With the increase of DC conductivity, the multi-peak structure gradually reverts to soft-gap behavior or even metallic conductivity. The numerical reliability is confirmed by the agreement between zero-frequency AC and DC conductivities.

Title: Edwards Localization
Authors: Riccardo Fantoni
Abstract: We study the localization problem in quantum stochastic mechanics. We start from the Edwards model for a particle in a bath of scattering centers and prove static localization of the ground state wavefunction of the particle in a one dimensional square well coupled to Dirac delta like scattering centers in arbitrary but fixed positions. We see how the localization increases for increasing coupling $g$. Then we choose the scattering centers positions as pseudo random numbers with a uniform probability distribution and observe an increase in the localization of the average of the ground state over the many positions realizations. We discuss how this averaging procedure is consistent with a picture of a particle in a Bose-Einstein condensate of of non interacting boson scattering centers interacting with the particle with Dirac delta functions pair potential. We then study the dynamics of the ground state wave function. We conclude with a discussion of the affine quantization version of the Lax model which reduces to a system of contiguous square wells with walls in arbitrary positions independently of the coupling constant $g$.

Title: Floquet Engineering Magnetism and Superconductivity in the Square-Lattice Hubbard Model
Authors: Jan-Niklas Herre, Takuya Okugawa, Ammon Fischer, Christoph Karrasch, Dante M. Kennes
Abstract: We study the interplay of magnetic order and superconductivity in the square-lattice Hubbard model under periodic driving with circularly polarized light. Formulating diagrammatic techniques based on the random-phase approximation in terms of Floquet Green's functions, allows us to analyze fluctuation-driven unconventional pairing for weak-to-moderate interactions. The interplay of repulsive interactions and photo-assisted hopping of electrons gives rise to a rich magnetic phase diagram featuring an antiferromagnetic-to-ferromagnetic crossover prior to a Floquet Lifshitz transition. Close to the antiferromagnetic transition, topological $d+id$-wave superconductivity prevails in the phase diagram for a wide range of drive parameters. At intermediate-to-high frequency driving near the Floquet Lifshitz transition, superconducting orders are tuned from spin-singlet $d$-wave to spin-triplet $p$-wave character, providing an effective protocol for Floquet engineering topological superconductivity.

Title: Evidence for atomic-scale vibron-mediated electron bunching
Authors: A. Maiti, M. Amato, V. S. Stolyarov, H. Aubin, J. Estève, F. Pistolesi, M. Aprili, F. Massee
Abstract: Due to the Coulomb blockade effect, electrons rarely bunch during transport, a phenomenon observed only in a few specially engineered mesoscopic configurations. In this work, we introduce an atomically resolved shot-noise study to demonstrate the possibility of electron bunching through vibrational coupling which takes place in an atomically sized nano-electro-mechanical system. Using tunnelling spectroscopy, we observe signatures of vibron-assisted tunnelling on an Fe impurity in Bi$_2$Se$_3$. Notably, simultaneous shot-noise measurements at the centre of the vibrating impurity reveal super-Poissonian noise. In the absence of alternative sources of super-Poissonian noise, this implies vibronic-coupling-induced bunching of electrons during the tunnelling process through the impurity, as theoretically predicted decades ago. As a future outlook, if coherence between electrons can be implemented, vibron-mediated electron bunching at single atomic sites may be exploited as a local injection source of $N$-paired electrons.

Title: Effective Hamiltonians for Ge/Si core/shell nanowires from higher order perturbation theory
Authors: Sebastian Miles, A. Mert Bozkurt, Dániel Varjas, Michael Wimmer
Abstract: We theoretically explore the electronic structure of holes in cylindrical Germanium/Silicon core/shell nanowires using a perturbation theory approach. The approach yields a set of interpretable and transferable effective low-energy models for the lowest few sub-bands up to fifth order for experimentally relevant growth directions. In particular, we are able to resolve higher order cross terms e.g., the dependency of the effective mass on the magnetic field. Our study reveals orbital inversions of the lowest sub-bands for low-symmetry growth directions, leading to significant changes of the lower order effective coefficients. We demonstrate a reduction of the direct Rashba spin-orbit interaction due to competing symmetry effects for low-symmetry growth directions. Finally, we find that the effective mass of the confined holes can diverge yielding quasi flat bands interesting for correlated states. We show how one can tune the effective mass of a single spin band allowing one to tune the effective mass selectively to its divergent points.

Title: Topological flowscape reveals state transitions in nonreciprocal living matter
Authors: Hyunseok Lee, EliseAnne Koskelo, Shreyas Gokhale, Junang Li, Chenyi Fei, Chih-Wei Joshua Liu, Lisa Lin, Jorn Dunkel, Dominic J. Skinner, Nikta Fakhri
Abstract: Nonreciprocal interactions-- where forces between entities are asymmetric-- govern a wide range of nonequilibrium phenomena, yet their role in structural transitions in living and active systems remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate a transition between nonreciprocal states using starfish embryos at different stages of development, where interactions are inherently asymmetric and tunable. Experiments, interaction inference, and topological analysis yield a nonreciprocal state diagram spanning crystalline, flocking, and fragmented states, revealing that weak nonreciprocity promotes structural order while stronger asymmetry disrupts it. To capture these transitions, we introduce topological landscapes, mapping the distribution of structural motifs across state space. We further develop topological flowscapes, a dynamic framework that quantifies transitions between collective states and detects an informational rate shift from the experimental state transition. Together, these results establish a general approach for decoding nonequilibrium transitions and uncover how asymmetric interactions sculpt the dynamical and structural architecture of active and living matter.

Title: Layer breathing Raman mode in two-dimensional van der Waals material $\mathrm{Cr_2Ge_2Te_6}$
Authors: Nilesh Choudhury, Sandeep, Neesha Yadav, Mayank Shukla, Pintu Das
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) magnetic materials have emerged as key materials for next-generation magneto-electric and spintronic devices, where understanding the relationship between layer number, lattice dynamics, and magnetic interactions is very important. In this work, we report the observation of the layer breathing mode (LBM) in few-layer $\mathrm{Cr_2Ge_2Te_6}$, a ferromagnetic semiconductor with thickness dependent electronic, magnetic and optical properties, using Raman spectroscopy, which serves as a direct fingerprint of interlayer coupling and lattice symmetry. Group-theoretical symmetry analysis confirms that the CGT falls under the non-polar category of layered material. The evolution of the LBM-frequency with increasing layer number (N) reveals a distinct softening trend, characteristic of weakening restoring forces in thicker flakes. By fitting the experimental Raman data using the Linear Chain Model (LCM), we quantitatively extract the interlayer force constant ($\mathrm{K_c}$), providing a measure of the vdW coupling strength between layers.

Title: Acoustic Metamaterials with Positive and Negative Couplings: Modular and One Piece Architectures for Topological Models
Authors: Jackson Saunders, Camelia Prodan
Abstract: We describe two 3D-printing approaches for realizing tight-binding models in acoustic metamaterials using H-shaped resonators: a modular system with tunable interconnections and an integrated one-piece design for reducing dissipation. The platform supports both positive and negative coupling through geometric control, enabling accurate acoustic analogs of topological models. By tuning the coupling length (CL), we eliminate detuning effects and preserve particle-hole symmetry. We further quantify the influence of the Total Coupling Area (TCA) on band topology and derive conditions for constant-area coupling. The system was tested on SSH and Kitaev chains, revealing midgap edge and interface states, confirming topological behavior in both configurations.

Title: Effects of Yttrium Doping on Oxygen Conductivity in Ba(Fe, Co, Zr, Y)O_{3-δ} Cathode Materials for Proton Ceramic Fuel Cells
Authors: Chiyoung Kim, Ryan Jacobs, Jack H. Duffy, Kyle S. Brinkman, Harry W. Abernathy, Dane Morgan
Abstract: Proton ceramic fuel cells (PCFCs) achieve high efficiency at reduced operating temperatures, but their performance is often limited by slow oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics at the cathode. The BaCoFeZrY (BCFZY) perovskite family is a promising triple-conducting air-electrode material, yet the role of Y dopants in governing oxygen transport remains unclear. In this study, we examine the effect of Y content on oxygen conductivity in three compositions: BCFZ, BCFZY0.1, and BCFY. Oxygen conductivity was evaluated from the product of oxygen tracer diffusivity and oxygen defect concentration. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations were used to determine tracer diffusivity and migration energies, while defect concentrations were estimated from reference data. Y doping slightly decreases oxygen conductivity from BCFZ to BCFZY0.1, from 337 to 203 mS/cm at 500 C, with activation energies of 0.155 and 0.172 eV. BCFY shows much lower conductivity (99 mS/cm) and a higher activation energy of 0.261 eV. Computed conductivities are higher and more Arrhenius-like than experimental values, suggesting that microstructural features such as grain boundaries strongly limit oxygen transport in real materials. A series-circuit model combining bulk conductivity and fitted grain-boundary parameters provides semi-quantitative agreement with experiment. These results clarify the role of Y doping in oxygen transport and provide insight for optimizing cathode performance in PCFCs.

Title: Quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnet in a field on the Tasaki square lattice
Authors: Maksym Parymuda, Taras Krokhmalskii, Oleg Derzhko
Abstract: We consider the $S=1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the Tasaki square lattice (flat-band spin system) and study its low-temperature thermodynamics around the saturation magnetic field. To this end, we construct a mapping of the ground states in the subspaces with total $S^z=N/2,\ldots,N/3$ ($N$ is the number of lattice sites) on the hard squares on an auxiliary square lattice and use classical Monte Carlo simulations to examine the latter classical system. The most prominent feature of the $S=1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the Tasaki square lattice is an order-disorder phase transition which occurs at a low temperature just below the saturation magnetic field and belongs to the 2D Ising universality class.

Title: Lellouch-Lüscher relation for ultracold few-atom systems under confinement
Authors: Jing-Lun Li, Paul S. Julienne, Johannes Hecker Denschlag, José P. D'Incao
Abstract: We derive an analog of the Lellouch-Lüscher (LL) relation for few-body bosonic systems, linking few-body scattering loss rates to the energies and widths of the corresponding harmonically trapped few-body states. Three-body numerical simulations show that the LL relation applies across a broad range of interaction strengths and energies and allows the determination of scattering rates within a single partial wave. Our work establishes a robust theoretical framework for understanding the role of the finite volume effect in few-body observables in optical lattice and tweezer experiments, enabling precise determination of multi-body scattering rates.

Title: Change in the Order of a Phase Transition in the 2D Potts Model with Equivalent Neighbours
Authors: Petro Sarkanych
Abstract: Two dimensional Potts model is a classical example where the symmetry of the order parameter controls the order of a phase transition: on a square lattice with nearest-neighbours interaction, when the number of states $q$ is less than or equal to 4, the second-order phase transition is observed, while for $q>4$ the first-order phase transition occurs. Recent research shows that even when the number of states is fixed, increasing the interaction range allows one to reach the point where the order of the phase transition changes. We focus on a $q=3$ 2D Potts model and, from the analysis of the partition function zeros, locate the number of interacting neighbours that change the order of the phase transition.

Title: Wrinkling in Sheets with Nonuniform Growth and Bending Rigidity
Authors: I. Levin, S. L. Keller
Abstract: Thin elastic sheets bend easily, leading to mechanical instabilities such as wrinkling. Here, we investigate wrinkles at edges of bi-strips, which consist of two thin sheets, one that swells and one that does not, joined side-by-side. It is well known that when bending rigidity is uniform across an isolated bi-strip, swelling results in axisymmetric shapes like a wine bottle: two cylinders of different radii are joined by a smooth transition zone. However, when the bending rigidity of the swollen sheet differs from that of the non-swollen sheet, purely axisymmetric shapes are no longer energetically favorable, and wrinkles arise. When the bending rigidity of the non-swollen sheet is essentially infinite, the wrinkles coarsen with distance from the transition zone such that dimensionless wavelengths and widths are related by $\tilde{\lambda} \propto \tilde{w}^{2/3}$. If the bending rigidity of the non-swollen sheet is non-infinite (but~still significantly larger than that of the swollen sheet), then the non-swollen sheet assumes a non-infinite radius of curvature, $R_0$. We find that the wrinkles in this system extend a critical distance, $w_C$, beyond the junction of the two strips and that $w_C \propto R_0$. Local undulations of wrinkles are favorable in this system because they decrease the overall bending energy by allowing the non-swollen sheet to have a larger radius of curvature than would otherwise be dictated by its reference geometry. Our results are relevant to a wide range of sheets that experience non-uniform growth, whether in natural systems such as plants or in synthetic systems such as designed, responsive materials.

Title: Spin-orbit coupled periodic Anderson model: Kondo-Dirac semimetal and orbital-selective antiferromagnetic semimetal
Authors: Sebastião dos Anjos Sousa-Júnior, Julián Faúndez, Rubem Mondaini
Abstract: We investigate the periodic Anderson model composed of an itinerant $c$-band and a strongly localized $f$-band, featuring on-site electron-electron interactions in the $f$-orbitals. The two bands interact via a hybridization term with spin-orbit coupling, which enables spin-flip processes. In the non-interacting limit, these profoundly alter the electronic structure, leading to the emergence of flat bands, van Hove singularities, and, most notably, Dirac cones within a single Kondo-Dirac semimetal order. The strongly interacting regime is explored via the determinant quantum Monte Carlo method, in the absence of the sign problem, where we unveil a complete ground-state phase diagram revealing two distinct phases, the Kondo-Dirac semimetal phase and a novel antiferromagnetic semimetal phase. Their characterization by the spectral functions establishes an orbital-selective Mott transition in the antiferromagnetic semimetal phase, marked by the opening of a gap exclusively in the $f$-orbital while Dirac cones persist in the $c$-orbital. Conversely, in the Kondo-Dirac semimetal phase, both $c$- and $f$-orbitals sustain robust Dirac cones. We establish that spin-orbit coupling in the hybridization term gives rise to Dirac cones, which, combined with additional symmetry-breaking conditions, can generate novel topological states.

Title: Ionic Interdiffusion at Cathode-Solid-Electrolyte Interface: A Machine Learning-Assisted Multiscale Investigation and Mitigation Strategies
Authors: Musawenkosi K. Ncube, Pallab Barai, Selva Chandrasekaran Selvaraj, Larry A. Curtiss, Anh T. Ngo, Venkat Srinivasan
Abstract: Future lithium-based batteries are expected to use solid electrolytes to achieve higher energy density and fast charge capabilities. The majority of solid electrolytes are thermodynamically unstable against layered oxide cathodes. Here, the stability of LiCoO2 (LCO) cathode with Li10GeP2S12 (LGPS) solid electrolyte is investigated using ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) and machine learning molecular dynamics (MLMD). The propensity of ionic interdiffusion, formation of a passivation layer, and corresponding decay in cell performance is addressed using a continuum model. The large-scale MLMD simulations confirm that the LCO|LGPS interface permits interdiffusion of Co and other ionic species, leading to the formation and growth of a resistive interphase and dramatic capacity fade even in the first cycle. We then examine the literature evidence that incorporating a thin layer of LiNb0.5Ta0.5O3 (LNTO) between LCO and LGPS prevents the interdiffusion of ions. Atomistic simulations suggest that the substitution of Li in LNTO with Co is not thermodynamically favorable, which helps to minimize the ionic interdiffusion process. The stable Nb/Ta5+ states form a rigid metal-oxide framework, which consequently also prevents the substitution of Nb/Ta. However, continuum level analysis suggests that due to the higher mechanical stiffness of LNTO, interfacial delamination between the LCO and LNTO is possible, which can minimize the effectiveness of the protective layer. This paper suggests the need for the development of novel interlayers that balance low interdiffusion with low stiffness.

Title: Quantum-Classical Study of Charge Transport in Organic Semiconductors with Multiple Low-Frequency Vibrational Modes
Authors: Darko Tanasković, Maksim Makrushin, Petar Mitrić
Abstract: Building on the recent success of a quantum-classical method for computing transport properties in the Holstein model with a single phonon mode [Phys. Rev. B ${\bf 111}$, L161105 (2025)], we now assess its reliability in more realistic scenarios involving multiple phonon modes in the Holstein model, as well as single- and multi-mode Peierls models. For parameters relevant to the prototypical organic semiconductor rubrene, we compute the frequency-dependent charge mobility and find excellent agreement with results from the state-of-the-art hierarchical equations of motion method. These results show that the method, previously validated only for the single-mode Holstein model, preserves quantitative accuracy in substantially more complex and material-relevant regimes. Our microscopic approach complements the phenomenological transient-localization theory and is readily applicable to realistic electron-phonon Hamiltonians.

Title: Probing Electrocatalytic Gas Evolution Reaction at Pt by Force Noise Measurements. Part 2. Oxygen
Authors: Nataraju Bodappa, Gregory Jerkiewicz, Peter Grutter
Abstract: Understanding O2 bubble nucleation and growth during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial to comprehend their influences on catalytically active sites in the process. To achieve this goal, mapping the spatial variation of nanoscale dynamic individual steps at the electrocatalytic interfaces is vital, as it further enables a detailed understanding of the mechanism of the process. Here, we combined tapping mode AFM imaging with a Pt ultramicroelectrode to investigate oxygen bubble nucleation, growth, and detachment. Our AFM feedback error signal and topography data reveal that bubbles of O2 gas nucleate at the step edge sites and interact with the catalytically active sites. This interaction between primary catalytic sites and bubble nucleation sites is the primary reason for a decrease in the current density at a given high overpotential of the OER. Our findings advance the understanding of the complexity of phenomena involved in gas evolution on catalytic surfaces.

Title: Search for quantum-tricritical-point in antiferromagnet CeRu$_2$(Si$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$)$_2$
Authors: H. Shinya, F. Ito, N. Kabeya, Y. Mizukami, N. Kimura
Abstract: CeRu$_2$Si$_2$ is a well-known heavy fermion paramagnet, and substituting Ge for Si induces antiferromagnetism. This antiferromagnetism is Ising-like and has a tricritical point in the magnetic field ($H$) -temperature ($T$) phase diagram. Since the temperature of the tricritical point is expected to decrease with increasing pressure ($P$), we investigated the pressure dependence of the magnetic phase transitions. We determined the $H$-$P$ phase diagram and revealed that a first-order phase-transition line changes to a quantum critical line, which implies the existence of the quantum tricritical point. A ferromagnetic quantum fluctuation arises in the vicinity of the possible quantum tricritical point.

Title: Inter-flake transport and humidity response of Ti3C2Tx MXene at the nanoscale
Authors: Oriane de Leuze, Maxime Berthe, Sophie Hermans, Benoît Hackens
Abstract: Understanding charge transport in networks of two-dimensional crystals is essential for developing reliable applications such as chemiresistors or electromagnetic shields. For this purpose, intra- and inter-flake contributions to the network resistance must be disentangled. MXenes, such as Ti3C2Tx, are prime examples of 2D crystals often employed as thin networks of interconnected flakes deposited on substrates to realize functional devices. While a significant number of studies focused on transport in individual MXene flakes, inter-flake transport remains scarcely explored. Here, we demonstrate that charge transport in multi-flake conductive paths of Ti3C2Tx is dominated by interflake junctions and provide quantitative estimates of junction resistances. Scanning probe measurements reveal that in a MXene multi-flake conductive path, individual flakes behave as isopotential domains, since the voltage drop is localized precisely at the inter-flake junctions. We further investigate the chemiresistive response to humidity at the single flake, multi-flake and flake network scale, evidencing the leading impact of junctions on sensing kinetics. These findings underline the crucial role of junctions in charge transport and sensing capabilities of MXenes.

Title: Acoustically-Coupled MEMS Transducer Pairs with Loss and Gain
Authors: Samer Houri, Rachid Haouari, Bart P. Weekers, Veronique Rochus
Abstract: This work treats the dynamics of pairs of microelectromechanical ultrasound transducers (MUTs) that are immersed in water and acoustically coupled through the fluid medium. A series of these transducer pairs with varying diameters (and thus resonance frequency) and pitch separation (and thus coupling strength) are fabricated and measured. The work presented here models and quantifies the open-loop coupling between the MEMS transducer pairs and its dependence on pitch. Furthermore, a gain feedback loop is systematically applied to one of the device pair and the dynamics of the acoustically-coupled gain-loss system is investigated, and the formation of an exceptional-point or of an Hopf bifurcation is equally used to quantify the coupling coefficient. This work provides an experimental study of acoustic coupling in MUT transducers, as well as an exploration of the formation of exceptional points in acoustically-coupled MEMS transducers.

Title: Ba-substitution induced evolution of structural and magnetic properties of La2-xBaxCoIrO6 double perovskites
Authors: C. A. S. Vieira, B. J. Santos, J. G. Duque, E. M. Bittar, L. Bufaiçal
Abstract: The Iridium-based oxides are the subject of great recent interest due to the non-conventional physics that may emerge from the strong spin-orbit coupling present in 5d ions. Here, we explore the coupling between Ir and Co in the La2-xBaxCoIrO6 perovskites (x = 0, 0.5, 0.75 and 1.0), where the structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of the series are investigated by means of x-ray powder diffraction and magnetometry. The system's crystal structure evolves from the monoclinic P2_1/n to the triclinic I-1 space group as the Ba concentration increases. Measurements of magnetization revealed ferrimagnetic behavior in x = 0, 0.5 and 0.75 compounds, possibly resulting from antiferromagnetic coupling between Co2+/3+ and Ir4+. In contrast, for x = 1.0 a clear collinear antiferromagnetic character is observed for the Co2+ ions, resulting from the quenching of the Ir5+ magnetic moment. The evolution of the magnetic properties of the series is discussed in terms of the structural and electronic changes, as well as the spin-orbit coupling in Ir.

Title: PT-Symmetric Magnon Lasing and Anti-Lasing
Authors: Xi-guang Wang, Tian-xiang Lu, Guang-hua Guo, Jamal Berakdar, Hui Jing
Abstract: A mechanism for electrically tunable PT-symmetric magnonic lasing and anti-lasing is proposed along with a device consisting of a current-biased region in a magnetically ordered planar waveguide. Within the bias area, several heavy-metal wires carrying dc charge current are periodically attached to the waveguide and exert so spatially periodic spin-orbit torques, producing current-controllable modulated magnon gain and loss. It is demonstrated that this decorated waveguide can emit a strong, single frequency magnon mode at the Bragg point (lasing) and also absorb at the same frequency phase-matched incoming coherent magnons (anti-lasing). The underlying physics is captured by an analytical model and validated with full material and device-specific numerical simulations. The magnonic laser absorber response is tunable via the current density in the wires, the extent of the biased region, and the intrinsic damping, enabling the control of lasing frequency and emission power. The structure is shown to amplify thermal magnons, offering a route to low-noise on-chip microwave sources. The concept is compatible with planar waveguides, ring geometries, and antiferromagnets. The results establish an experimentally realistic platform where a single element functions simultaneously as both magnon laser and absorber, opening opportunities for reconfigurable non-Hermitian magnonics and integrated magnon signal processing.

Title: Rapid Machine Learning-Driven Detection of Pesticides and Dyes Using Raman Spectroscopy
Authors: Quach Thi Thai Binh, Thuan Phuoc, Xuan Hai, Thang Bach Phan, Vu Thi Hanh Thu, Nguyen Tuan Hung
Abstract: The extensive use of pesticides and synthetic dyes poses critical threats to food safety, human health, and environmental sustainability, necessitating rapid and reliable detection methods. Raman spectroscopy offers molecularly specific fingerprints but suffers from spectral noise, fluorescence background, and band overlap, limiting its real-world applicability. Here, we propose a deep learning framework based on ResNet-18 feature extraction, combined with advanced classifiers, including XGBoost, SVM, and their hybrid integration, to detect pesticides and dyes from Raman spectroscopy, called MLRaman. The MLRaman with the CNN-XGBoost model achieved a predictive accuracy of 97.4% and a perfect AUC of 1.0, while it with the CNN-SVM model provided competitive results with robust class-wise discrimination. Dimensionality reduction analyses (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP) confirmed the separability of Raman embeddings across 10 analytes, including 7 pesticides and 3 dyes. Finally, we developed a user-friendly Streamlit application for real-time prediction, which successfully identified unseen Raman spectra from our independent experiments and also literature sources, underscoring strong generalization capacity. This study establishes a scalable, practical MLRaman model for multi-residue contaminant monitoring, with significant potential for deployment in food safety and environmental surveillance.

Title: Fractional Chern Insulators Transition in Non-ideal Flat Bands of Twisted Mono-bilayer Graphene
Authors: Moru Song, Kai Chang
Abstract: Fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) in ideal $|C|>1$ flat bands can be viewed as color-entangled composites of $C$ lowest Landau levels, but in realistic moiré systems non-ideal quantum geometry complicates this picture, leaving their stabilization mechanism incompletely understood. Using twisted monolayer-bilayer graphene (tMBG) as a platform, we observe two FCIs joined by a continuous transition controlled by continuum model parameter $\kappa$, arising from a geometric instability of the Bloch wave functions. For $\kappa$ below the transition, the target $C=2$ conduction band is geometrically stable and effectively decomposes into two independent $C=1$ color sectors. Although the flat band is non-ideal, the resulting fractional phase is naturally accounted for by the non-chiral Halperin-(112) state with counterpropagating edge modes. Above the transition, the system enters a Laughlin-$1/3$ phase that persists despite further degradation of quantum-geometry indicators. To account for this robustness, we propose a color-separation mechanism beyond global geometric indicators: when the Bloch wave function is geometrically unstable, interactions dynamically split a non-ideal flat band into an ideal subcomponent that hosts the FCI and non-ideal remnants. We corroborate this picture by applying a weak perpendicular magnetic field that acts as a "color separator," explicitly visualizing the ideal subcomponent at the single-particle level. Together, these results establish two different routes by which non-ideal flat bands stabilize FCIs, expanding their viable parameter space and clarifying the interplay between geometry and topological order.

Title: Equivariant Atomic and Lattice Modeling Using Geometric Deep Learning for Crystal Structure Optimization
Authors: Ziduo Yang, Yi-Ming Zhao, Xian Wang, Wei Zhuo, Xiaoqing Liu, Lei Shen
Abstract: Structure optimization, which yields the relaxed structure (minimum-energy state), is essential for reliable materials property calculations, yet traditional ab initio approaches such as density-functional theory (DFT) are computationally intensive. Machine learning (ML) has emerged to alleviate this bottleneck but suffers from two major limitations: (i) existing models operate mainly on atoms, leaving lattice vectors implicit despite their critical role in structural optimization; and (ii) they often rely on multi-stage, non-end-to-end workflows that are prone to error accumulation. Here, we present E3Relax, an end-to-end equivariant graph neural network that maps an unrelaxed crystal directly to its relaxed structure. E3Relax promotes both atoms and lattice vectors to graph nodes endowed with dual scalar-vector features, enabling unified and symmetry-preserving modeling of atomic displacements and lattice deformations. A layer-wise supervision strategy forces every network depth to make a physically meaningful refinement, mimicking the incremental convergence of DFT while preserving a fully end-to-end pipeline. We evaluate E3Relax on four benchmark datasets and demonstrate that it achieves remarkable accuracy and efficiency. Through DFT validations, we show that the structures predicted by E3Relax are energetically favorable, making them suitable as high-quality initial configurations to accelerate DFT calculations.

Title: The distribution of the moment of inertia for harmonically trapped noninteracting Bosons at finite temperature: large deviations
Authors: Manas Kulkarni, Satya N. Majumdar, Gregory Schehr
Abstract: We compute the full probability distribution of the moment of inertia $I \propto \sum_{i=1}^N \vec{r}_i^{\,2}$ of a gas of $N$ noninteracting bosons trapped in a harmonic potential $V(r) = (1/2)\, m\, \omega^2 r^2$, in all dimensions and at all temperature. The appropriate thermodynamic limit in a trapped Bose gas consists in taking the limit $N\to \infty$ and $\omega\to 0$ with their product $\rho = N \omega^d$ fixed, where $\rho$ plays the role analogous to the density in a translationally invariant system. In this thermodynamic limit and in dimensions $d>1$, the harmonically trapped Bose gas undergoes a Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) transition as the density $\rho$ crosses a critical value $\rho_c(\beta)$, where $\beta$ denotes the inverse temperature. We show that the probability distribution $P_\beta(I,N)$ of $I$ admits a large deviation form $P_\beta(I,N) \sim e^{-V \Phi(I/V)}$ where $V = \omega^{-d} \gg 1$. We compute explicitly the rate function $\Phi(z)$ and show that it exhibits a singularity at a critical value $z=z_c$ where its second derivative undergoes a discontinuous jump. We show that the existence of such a singularity in the rate function is directly related to the existence of a BEC transition and it disappears when the system does not have a BEC transition as in $d \leq 1$. An interesting consequence of our results is that even if the actual system is in the fluid phase, i.e., when $\rho < \rho_c(\beta)$, by measuring the distribution of $I$ and analysing the singularity in the associated rate function, one can get a signal of the BEC transition in $d>1$. This provides a real space diagnostic for the BEC transition in the noninteracting Bose gas.

Title: Reinforcement Learning for Chemical Ordering in Alloy Nanoparticles
Authors: Jonas Elsborg, Arghya Bhowmik
Abstract: We approach the search for optimal element ordering in bimetallic alloy nanoparticles (NPs) as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem, and have built an RL agent that learns to perform such global optimisation using the geometric graph representation of the NPs. To demonstrate the effectiveness, we train an RL agent to perform composition-conserving atomic swap actions on the icosahedral nanoparticle structure. Trained once on randomised $Ag_{X}Au_{309-X}$ compositions and orderings, the agent discovers previously established ground state structure. We show that this optimization is robust to differently ordered initialisations of the same NP compositions. We also demonstrate that a trained policy can extrapolate effectively to NPs of unseen size. However, the efficacy is limited when multiple alloying elements are involved. Our results demonstrate that RL with pre-trained equivariant graph encodings can navigate combinatorial ordering spaces at the nanoparticle scale, and offer a transferable optimisation strategy with the potential to generalise across composition and reduce repeated individual search cost.

Title: Enhanced coherence in the periodically driven two-dimensional XY model
Authors: Duilio De Santis, Marios H. Michael, Sambuddha Chattopadhyay, Andrea Cavalleri, Gil Refael, Patrick A. Lee, Eugene A. Demler
Abstract: Strong optical drives have been shown to induce transient superconducting-like response in materials above their equilibrium $T_c$. Many of these materials already exhibit short-range superconducting correlations in equilibrium. This motivates the question: can external driving enhance coherence in systems with superconducting correlations but no long-range order? We explore this scenario in the two-dimensional XY model with a periodically modulated stiffness using overdamped Langevin dynamics. We find that, even though the modulation leaves the average coupling unchanged, the drive can markedly increase long-range, time-averaged correlations in systems well above the equilibrium Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless temperature. The outcome depends on the ratio of the drive frequency to the intrinsic relaxation rate: faster drives primarily heat the system, suppressing correlations and conductivity. For slower drives, the optical conductivity is modified so that the real part exhibits a prolonged effective Drude scattering time, while the imaginary part has a strengthened low-frequency $1/\omega$ behavior. We map out these regimes across temperature, frequency, and amplitude, and rationalize them via simple analytics and vortex-thermalization arguments. Overall, we identify a generic nonequilibrium route to enhance coherence in XY-like systems, with potential relevance to experiments reporting light-induced superconductivity.

Title: Direct vs. Indirect Measurement of the Effective Electronic Temperature in Quantum Dot Solids
Authors: Anton Kompatscher, Morteza Shokrani, Johanna Feurstein, Martijn Kemerink
Abstract: One of the characteristics of disordered semiconductors is the slow thermalization of charge carriers after excitation due to photoabsorption or high electric fields. An elegant way to capture the effects of the latter on the conductivity is through a field-dependent effective electronic temperature T_eff that can significantly exceed that of the lattice. Despite its elegance, its actual use has been limited, which, at least in part, can be attributed to the concept originating from computer simulations; experimental confirmations have largely been indirect (through scaling of conductivity) and did not establish that T_eff equals the real temperature of the electron distribution. Moreover, it has hardly been tested for important classes of disordered materials, including quantum dot solids. Here, we investigate whether the effective temperature concept is applicable to quantum dot solids, using zinc oxide as relevant model system. To verify that field-driven conductivity increases indeed reflect an actual increase of the electronic temperature, we combine direct and indirect measurements of T_eff: we convert conductivity changes at high fields to an effective temperature that we show to be consistent with a direct measurement of the electronic temperature using the Seebeck effect. These results not only confirm the relevance of the effective temperature concept to quantum dot solids but also confirm its general physical reality and open the way to systematic investigations into charge carrier (de)localization in disordered media.

Title: Electric field-dependent conductivity as probe for charge carrier delocalization and morphology in organic semiconductors
Authors: Morteza Shokrani, Felix Maximilian Graf, Anton Kompatscher, Dennis Derewjanko, Martijn Kemerink
Abstract: The charge carrier localization length {\alpha} is a crucial, yet often ignored parameter of conjugated polymers that exponentially influences electronic conductivity. Here, we argue it is a unique proxy of the energy landscape as determined by sample morphology and experienced by mobile charges. To determine {\alpha}, we use that in disordered organic semiconductors, slow thermalization of charge carriers after excitation, e.g. by hopping in a finite electric field, can lead to an effective electronic temperature (T_eff) exceeding the lattice temperature, thereby enhancing conductivity. We experimentally probe this effect by combining temperature- and field-dependent conductivity measurements for a range of representative conjugated polymers, using different dopants, doping protocols and doping concentrations. We find that in the high-field regime (F>1E6V/m), T_eff exhibits distinct trends vs. structural order and doping level, which can be used to extract (effective) localization lengths ranging from ~1nm in fully amorphous systems to over ~10nm in highly ordered polymers. Tight-binding and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations are used to connect measured values to morphological properties and to rule out alternative explanations. Our results demonstrate that finite-field conductivity measurements provide a powerful probe of a characteristic length scale of charge transport that is complementary to conventional structural characterization.

Title: Deterministic Switching of Perpendicular Ferromagnets by Higher-order Spin-orbit Torque in Noncentrosymmetric Weyl Semimetals
Authors: Naomi Fokkens, Fei Xue
Abstract: Field-free deterministic switching of perpendicular ferromagnets is a central challenge for spintronics applications, typically requiring explicit symmetry breaking. Here we show that deterministic switching can instead be achieved through higher-order (in magnetization angles) spin-orbit torques, even in systems that preserve in-plane mirror symmetry. Using a vector spherical harmonics expansion, we demonstrate that higher-order torque terms naturally give rise to additional out-of-equator fixed points, enabling reliable magnetization reversal when their magnitude is comparable to conventional lowest-order torques. We illustrate this mechanism with first-principles calculations on the noncentrosymmetric Weyl ferromagnet PrAlGe, where the combination of Weyl-node band topology and strong spin-orbit coupling produces sizable higher-order torque components. Because the Fermi surface is small, the conventional lowest-order torques are relatively weak, allowing the higher-order harmonics to compete on equal footing and strongly reshape the magnetization dynamics. The resulting spin dynamics confirm deterministic switching without additional symmetry breaking. Our results establish higher-order spin-orbit torque as a key ingredient for understanding and controlling magnetization dynamics in topological and spintronic materials.

Title: From Laplacian-to-Adjacency Matrix for Continuous Spins on Graphs
Authors: Nikita Titov, Andrea Trombettoni
Abstract: The study of spins and particles on graphs has many applications across different fields, from time dynamics on networks to the solution of combinatorial problems. Here, we study the large n limit of the $O(n)$ model on general graphs, which is considerably more difficult than on regular lattices. Indeed, the loss of translational invariance gives rise to an infinite set of saddle point constraints in the thermodynamic limit. We show that the free energy at low and high temperature $T$ is determined by the spectrum of two crucial objects from graph theory: the Laplacian matrix at low $T$ and the Adjacency matrix at high $T$. Their interplay is studied in several classes of graphs. For regular lattices the two coincide. We obtain an exact solution on trees, where the Lagrange multipliers interestingly depend solely on the number of nearest neighbors. For decorated lattices, the singular part of the free energy is governed by the Laplacian spectrum, whereas this is true for the full free energy only in the zero temperature limit. Finally, we discuss a bipartite fully connected graph to highlight the importance of a finite coordination number in these results. Results for quantum spin models on a loopless graph are also presented.

Title: Stoichiometry and Phase Control in K$_{1-x}$CrSe$_2$ via Self-Flux Synthesis
Authors: Felix Eder, Catherine Witteveen, Enrico Giannini, Fabian O. von Rohr
Abstract: Layered delafossite-type magnetic materials, such as KCrSe$_2$, are promising platforms for studying magnetic systems and potential frustration on triangular lattices. Synthesis, structure-type control, and off-stoichiometries remain major challenges in the investigation of these delafossite-type magnets. Starting from the same self-flux composition (K:Cr:Se = 8:1:8), we isolated three distinct K$_{1-x}$CrSe$_2$ phases with $x$ = 0, 0.13--0.17, and 0.32--0.35, each adopting a different structure type depending on the quenching temperature applied. The phase evolution indicates a sequence of transformations during synthesis between compounds with varying degrees of potassium deficiency. Building on these insights into phase stability and crystal growth, we successfully grew single crystals of full-stoichiometric KCrSe$_2$ -- enabling direction-dependent magnetization measurements. These measurements reveal a pronounced field dependence of the Néel temperature at low external fields, as well as a weak metamagnetic transition. Our findings demonstrate that even a simple parameter -- such as quenching temperature -- can be used to control stoichiometry, direct phase formation, and ultimately tune the magnetic properties of delafossite-type materials.

Title: Crystal-Field--Driven Magnetoelectric Coupling in the Non-Kramers Hexaaluminate PrMgAl11O19
Authors: Sonu Kumar, Gael Bastien, Petr Proschek, Maxim Savinov, Malgorzata Sliwinska-Bartkowiak, Stanislav Kamba
Abstract: We report broadband dielectric spectra of the non-Kramers hexaaluminate PrMgAl(*{11})O(*{19}), revealing a pronounced interplay between permittivity and magnetization at cryogenic temperatures. The zero-field dielectric response follows a Barrett-type quantum-paraelectric form, while a broad dielectric anomaly near 5 K shifts systematically to higher temperatures under applied magnetic fields, evidencing robust magnetoelectric coupling. The inverse permittivity (\varepsilon'^{-1}(T,H)) scales linearly with (M^{2}), consistent with a biquadratic (P^{2}M^{2}) term in a Landau framework. Fits yield temperature-dependent coupling constants (\lambda(T)) that decrease with heating, reflecting the thermal population of low-lying energy levels of Pr(^{3+}). These results identify PrMgAl(*{11})O(*{19}) as a paradigmatic non-Kramers hexaaluminate where quantum paraelectricity and magnetoelectric interactions are intrinsically entangled, establishing hexaaluminates as a tunable platform for magnetoelectric physics in frustrated quantum materials.

Title: Tunable Nanostructures from Inverse Surfactants

Abstract: Hierarchical materials in the natural world are often made through the self-assembly of amphiphilic molecules. Achieving similar structural complexity in synthetic materials requires understanding how various molecular parameters affect assembly behavior. In recent years, inverse surfactants -- molecules with hydrophobic head groups and hydrophilic macromolecular tails -- have been shown to self-assemble into supramolecular assemblies in aqueous solutions that show promise for a number of applications, including drug delivery. Here, we build an understanding of the morphological phase diagram of inverse surfactants using insights from scattering experiments, computer simulations, and statistical mechanics. The scattering and simulation results reveal that changing the head-group size is an important molecular knob in controlling morphological transitions. The molecular size ratio of the hydrophobic group to the hydrophilic emerges as a crucial dimensionless quantity in our theory and plays a determining role in setting the micelle structure and the transition from mesoscale to macroscale aggregates. Our minimal theory is able to qualitatively explain the key features of the morphological phase diagram, including the prevalence of fiber-like structures in comparison to spherical and planar micelles. Together, these findings provide a more complete picture for the molecular dependencies of assemblies of inverse surfactants, which we hope may aid in the de novo design of supramolecular structures.

Title: Chemical-space completeness: a new strategy for crystalline materials exploration
Authors: Fengyu Xie, Ruoyu Wang, Taoyuze Lv, Yuxiang Gao, Hongyu Wu, Zhicheng Zhong
Abstract: The emergence of deep learning has brought the long-standing goal of comprehensively understanding and exploring crystalline materials closer to reality. Yet, universal exploration across all elements remains hindered by the combinatorial explosion of possible chemical environments, making it difficult to balance accuracy and efficiency. Crucially, within any finite set of elements, the diversity of short-range bonding types and local geometric motifs is inherently limited. Guided by this chemical intuition, we propose a chemical-system-centric strategy for crystalline materials exploration. In this framework, generative models are coupled with machine-learned force fields as fast energy evaluators, and both are iteratively refined in a closed-loop cycle of generation, evaluation, and fine-tuning. Using the Li-P-S ternary system as a case study, we show that this approach captures the diversity of local environments with minimal additional first-principles data while maintaining structural creativity, achieving closed-loop convergence toward chemical completeness within a bounded chemical space. We further demonstrate downstream applications, including phase-diagram construction, ionic-diffusivity screening, and electronic-structure prediction. Together, this strategy provides a systematic and data-efficient framework for modeling both atomistic and electronic structures within defined chemical spaces, bridging accuracy and efficiency, and paving the way toward scalable, AI-driven discovery of crystalline materials with human-level creativity and first-principles fidelity.

Title: Topological Valley Transport in Bilayer Graphene Induced by Interlayer Sliding
Authors: Jie Pan, Huanhuan Wang, Lin Zou, Xiaoyu Wang, Lihao Zhang, Xueyan Dong, Haibo Xie, Yi Ding, Yuze Zhang, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Shuxi Wang, Zhe Wang
Abstract: Interlayer sliding, together with twist angle, is a crucial parameter that defines the atomic registry and thus determines the properties of two-dimensional (2D) material homobilayers. Here, we theoretically demonstrate that controlled interlayer sliding in bilayer graphene induces Berry curvature reversals, leading to topological states confined within a one-dimensional moiré channel. We experimentally realize interlayer sliding by bending the bilayer graphene geometry across a nanoridge. Systematic electronic transport measurements reveal topological valley transport when the Fermi energy resides within the band gap, consistent with theoretical predictions of eight topological channels. Our findings establish interlayer sliding as a powerful tool for tuning the electronic properties of bilayer graphene and underscore its potential for broad application across 2D material systems.

Title: An Active Learning Interatomic Potential For Defect-Engineered CoCrFeMnNi High-Entropy Alloy
Authors: Manish Sahoo, Akash Deshmukh, Yash Kokane, Jayaprakash H M, Raghavan Ranganathan
Abstract: High-entropy alloys (HEAs) exhibit exceptional properties arising from a combination of thermodynamic, kinetic and structural factors and have found applications in numerous fields such as aerospace, energy, chemical industries, hydrogen storage, and ocean engineering. However, a large compositional space remains to be explored. Unlike conventional approaches, computational methods have shown accelerated discovery of novel alloys in a short time. However, the lack of interatomic potentials have posed a challenge in discovering new alloy compositions and property measurements. In the present work, we have developed a Moment Tensor Potential (MTP) trained by Machine Learning based approach using the BFGS unconstrained optimization algorithm for the CoCrFeMnNi High-entropy alloy. Our training set consists of various defects induced configurations such as vacancies, dislocations and stacking-faults. An active learning scheme to re-train the potential was undertaken to dynamically to add training data upon encountering extrapolative configurations during non-equilibrium simulations. A thorough investigation of the error metrics, equation of state, uniaxial tensile deformation, nano-indentation and solid-liquid interface stability for this alloy was carried out, and it is seen that the MTP potential outperforms the popular Modified Embedded Atom Method (MEAM) potential on physical properties prediction. The accuracy and high computational speed are discussed using scaling performance. The potential is prepared for public use by embedding it into the Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS) code.

Title: Small clusters of He atoms in finite-cutoff EFT
Authors: Betzalel Bazak
Abstract: Small clusters of $^4$He atoms provide a paradigmatic setting for exploring universal phenomena in few-body quantum systems with large scattering length. Their weakly bound states serve as ideal test cases for studying Efimov physics and the emergence of universality beyond the three-body sector. In this work, we investigate few-$^4$He systems within a finite-cutoff effective field theory (EFT) framework. The EFT interactions are calibrated to reproduce low-energy observables obtained from the realistic LM2M2 potential, enabling a direct and systematic comparison between the two approaches. We demonstrate that, for suitably chosen finite cutoffs, the empirical effective range is accurately reproduced already at leading order, achieving next-to-leading-order precision without explicit higher-order corrections. Using these interactions, we solve the Schrödinger equation for systems of a few atoms, obtaining binding energies and scattering observables in excellent agreement with results derived from realistic interatomic potentials. In particular, we compute atom--tetramer scattering parameters and binding energies of clusters up to eight atoms, thereby extending the EFT description to larger helium systems. Our findings establish a quantitative bridge between realistic helium potentials and finite-cutoff EFT, showing that the latter provides an efficient and predictive framework for describing few-body universality in weakly bound quantum systems.

Title: Full counting statistics for boundary driven transport in presence of correlated gain and loss channels
Authors: Katha Ganguly, Bijay Kumar Agarwalla
Abstract: One of the major advances of quantum technology is the engineering of complex quantum channels in lattice systems that paves the way for a variety of novel non-equilibrium phenomena. For a boundary driven lattice with such engineered quantum channels, the analysis of the full counting statistics of current across boundaries has received limited attention. In this work, we consider a boundary driven free fermionic lattice with carefully engineered correlated gain and loss channels and obtain the cumulant generating function of the steady-state particle current. We also discuss the limit for simplifying the correlated gain-loss channel to a local gain-loss channel and obtain the average current and its fluctuation in such cases. Generally, in the presence of gain-loss, the current statistics are different at the two ends of the lattice. Hence, for both local and correlated gain-loss, we devise the conditions for which the statistics can coincide, giving rise to a $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric balanced gain-loss scenario. A striking difference between the correlated gain-loss and their local counterpart is the emergence of nonreciprocity in the system and we observe that it has a dramatic impact in the current as well as fluctuations. Our work therefore provides interesting insights about the importance of engineered dissipators in boundary driven systems.

Title: Principal Component Analysis of Competing Correlations in Quarter-Filled Hubbard Models
Authors: Md Fahad Equbal, S R Hassan, M. A. H. Ahsan
Abstract: We present a data-driven analysis of correlation hierarchies in the quarter-filled simple and extended Hubbard models by applying principal component analysis (PCA) to exact-diagonalization (ED) data on 3x4 and 4x4 cylindrical clusters. While the non-interacting limit (U=0) provides a finite-size reference, increasing on-site repulsion U induces localization and reorganizes the low-energy spectrum. For the extended model, we examine moderate (U=4) and strong (U=10) coupling regimes, where conventional structure factors reveal familiar crossovers among charge, spin and local-pairing correlations. PCA of the corresponding correlation matrices captures these crossovers directly from the data, without assuming predefined order parameters by identifying charge-dominated, spin-dominated and pairing-dominated regimes through variance condensation into leading components. This establishes PCA as a transparent, model-agnostic framework for uncovering the hierarchy and competition of correlation channels in finite Hubbard lattice clusters, providing a bridge between exact diagonalization and modern machine-learning diagnostics in strongly correlated systems.

Title: A Complex Topological Phase in C-Spin Active Matter
Authors: Alessandro Scirè
Abstract: This work introduces a new theoretical model for active matter ("complementary-spins" or c-spins), exploring the interplay of positional and orientational order in mobile agents with rotational freedom, divided into two populations with contrasting interactions. The system's behavior depends on its size and a control parameter (circular anisotropy) that splits the agents' natural rotational frequencies. Key findings include distinct phases based on anisotropy: Small Anisotropy: Stable, regular equilibrium patterns emerge. Moderate Anisotropy: Formation of complex, non-equilibrium topological point defects (vortex states), which are bistable with uniform patterns. These robust, self-repairing defects exhibit counter-rotating c-spin loop trains, spin-momentum locking, and dissipationless flow, classified by a two-valued topological charge. High Anisotropy: Transition to active turbulence and loss of order. Statistical analysis reveals a double phase transition at a critical value: a standard symmetry-breaking transition and a novel topological phase transition activating the vortex complexes. Increasing system size enhances organizational complexity and the development of spin-momentum locked transport networks. This model provides a new framework for understanding robustness and morphogenesis in living systems.

Title: Symmetry-based nonlinear fluctuating hydrodynamics in one dimension
Authors: Yuki Minami, Hiroyoshi Nakano, Keiji Saito
Abstract: We present a symmetry-based formulation of nonlinear fluctuating hydrodynamics (NFH) for one-dimensional many-particle systems with generic homogeneous nearest-neighbor interactions. We derive the hydrodynamic equations solely from symmetry and conservation principles, ensuring full consistency with thermalization. Using the dynamic renormalization group, we show that both the sound and heat modes share the dynamical exponent $z=3/2$. Extensive numerical simulations of the derived NFH equations confirm this exponent and further reveal that both modes are close to the universal KPZ scaling function, namely the Prähofer-Spohn function. These findings establish a unified, symmetry-based framework for understanding universal transport and fluctuation phenomena in one-dimensional nonequilibrium systems, independent of microscopic details.

Title: Electron Tunneling Enhances Thermal Conductance through Metal-Insulator-Semiconductor Junctions
Authors: Yizhe Liu, Bo Sun
Abstract: The presence of interfaces in semiconductor devices substantially hinders thermal transport, contributing disproportionately to the overall thermal resistance. However, approaches to enhance interfacial thermal transport remain scarce without changing the interface structure, as the intrinsic electron and phonon properties of constituent materials set an upper limit. Here, we find a new thermal transport pathway, electronic heat tunneling, to enhance interfacial thermal conductance through metal-insulator-semiconductor junctions. By applying photoexcitation or bias voltage, we observe remarkable thermal conductance increases in operando, opening a new channel for efficient interfacial heat dissipation. The electron quantum tunneling pathway is parallel to conventional phonon-mediated interfacial thermal transport, and violates the Wiedemann-Franz law since this pathway deviates from the paradigm of diffusive transport. Moreover, we develop a tunneling mismatch model to describe the enhanced thermal conductance, originating from tunneling heat flux. Our Letter demonstrates a previously unexplored heat transport mechanism to enhance thermal conductance, bypassing the need for interface engineering. These findings emphasize the essential need to understand semiconductor thermal properties under realistic operating conditions.

Title: Bacterial turbulence at compressible fluid interfaces
Authors: Yuanfeng Yin, Bokai Zhang, H. P. Zhang, Shuo Guo
Abstract: Dense bacterial suspensions at fluid interfaces provide a natural platform to explore active turbulence in a dimensional mismatch: active units are restricted to a two-dimensional surface, while the induced flows extend into the surrounding three-dimensional liquid. Using hydrophobic Serratia marcescens at the air-water interface, we realize interfacial bacterial turbulence as a distinct class of active turbulence. The system exhibits compressible in-plane flows, with vortex size initially increasing with the thickness of the underlying fluid and saturating near 100 $\mu$ m, independent of bacterial length. This behavior contrasts sharply with bulk active turbulence, where correlation length typically scales with system size. Hydrodynamic theory, together with direct measurements of the three-dimensional flow field, shows that the coupling between interfacial and bulk flows sets the emergent length scale. Our results uncover the fundamental physics of interfacial bacterial turbulence and open new strategies for geometric control of collective active flows.

Title: Collective bacterial motion drives interfacial waves and shape dynamics in phase-separated droplets
Authors: Kan Chang, Yulin Li, Ming Yuan, Masaki Sano, Zhihong You, H.P. Zhang
Abstract: Liquid--liquid phase separation governs a broad spectrum of phenomena in biology, physics, and materials science. While traditionally explored in equilibrium contexts, growing evidence underscores the transformative role of active components, such as motor proteins, enzymatic catalysts, and synthetic microswimmers, in modulating the dynamics of phase-separated systems. Here, we encapsulate motile bacteria within phase-separated aqueous droplets to examine how internal activity shapes interfacial behavior. By tuning bacterial density, we control the magnitude of active stresses at the droplet interface. At low activity, we observe scale-dependent interfacial fluctuations featuring propagative wave this http URL, despite the low Reynolds number regime, these waves arise from an effective inertial response that emerges when bacterial active stresses balance viscous dissipation. At high activity, droplets exhibit pronounced deformation that exceeds the Rayleigh-Plateau instability threshold, accompanied by enhanced motility that accelerates coarsening. Our findings demonstrate how active stresses can reshape morphology and dynamics in multiphase systems, offering new insights into the physics of internally driven phase-separated fluids.

Title: Inverse determination of light-matter coupling in disordered systems from transmittance spectra
Authors: Thales F. Macedo, Julián Faúndez, Antônio S. Coelho, Caio Lewenkopf, Mauro S. Ferreira, Felipe A. Pinheiro, Natanael C. Costa
Abstract: We investigate quantum inverse problems in one-dimensional (1D) electronic disordered systems strongly coupled to optical cavities. More specifically, we consider the Anderson and the Aubry-Andre-Harper models connected to electronic reservoirs and embedded in a single-mode optical cavity. The light-matter interaction enables photon-assisted hopping processes that significantly modify the transmittance spectrum. Within the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism, we implement an inversion-based approach capable of accurately extracting the electron-photon coupling strength directly from transmittance spectra. While cavity coupling acts as a minor perturbation within the Anderson model, yielding broad yet precise parameter estimates, its influence is markedly different in the Aubry-André-Harper model. The latter exhibits a sharp metal-insulator transition in 1D, thus resulting in more pronounced cavity-induced spectral changes. This renders even more accurate inverse solutions, offering unparalleled precision in the characterization of low-dimensional disordered systems. Altogether, our results demonstrate that the quantum inverse problem provides a robust diagnostic tool for quantum materials, particularly effective for systems exhibiting metal-insulator transitions.

Title: Tunable Luttinger liquid and correlated insulating states in one-dimensional moiré superlattices

Abstract: Two-dimensional moiré superlattices have been extensively studied, and a variety of correlated phenomena have been observed. However, their lower-dimensional counterpart, one-dimensional (1D) moiré superlattices, remain largely unexplored. Electrons in 1D are generally described by Luttinger liquid theory, with universal scaling relations depending only on the Luttinger parameter g. In particular, at half-filling, Umklapp scattering plays a crucial role, as it can significantly change the conductance-temperature scaling relation and lead to Mott insulators. However, this prediction has never been observed since doping an empty band to half-filling was extremely difficult. Here, we show that the marriage of moiré superlattices and 1D electrons makes it possible to study the Luttinger liquid in an exceptionally wide filling region simply by electrical gating. We perform transport measurements on 1D moiré superlattices of carbon nanotubes on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) substrates, and observe correlated insulating states at 1/4 and 1/2 fillings of the superlattice mini-band, where Umklapp scattering becomes dominant. We also observe a T-linear conductance at these commensurate fillings over a range of temperatures. Strikingly, the T-linear conductance leads to a strongly suppressed Luttinger parameter, suggesting a state of extreme correlation.

Title: Distortion-Driven Carrier Decoupling in Doped LiMgPO4
Authors: Zhihua Zheng, Xiaolong Yao, Cailian Yu, Menghao Gao, Fangping Ouyang, Shiwu Gao
Abstract: The interplay between lattice distortions and charge carriers governs the properties of many functional oxides. In alkali-doped LiMgPO4, a significant enhancement in dosimetric response is observed, but its microscopic origin is not understood. Using non-adiabatic molecular dynamics, we reveal a fundamental mechanism of carrier decoupling driven by a hierarchy of lattice distortions. We show that electrons localize into stable small polarons on an ultrafast timescale, trapped by the strong local potential induced by the dopant, while holes form more delocalized polarons that migrate efficiently through a lattice smoothed by global strain. The stark contrast between the dynamics of trapped electrons and mobile holes explains the suppressed recombination and enhanced energy storage. These results present a clear physical picture of how multiscale lattice distortions can independently control electron and hole transport, offering new insights into the physics of polarons in complex materials.

Title: The role of interaction in matter wave optics with motional states
Authors: RuGway Wu, Maximilian Prüfer, Jörg Schmiedmayer
Abstract: Matter-wave optics is often viewed as a linear analogue of photonics, where noninteracting particles are coherently split, diffracted, and recombined, and interference arises from single-particle coherence. In ultracold quantum gases, however, interactions are intrinsic and can rival or exceed kinetic and optical energy scales. This drives matter-wave optics into a nonlinear regime: diffraction and momentum distributions become interaction-dependent, interference contrast degrades or collapses, and revival dynamics appear. In the mean time, interactions can generate squeezing and entanglement, enabling sensitivities beyond the standard quantum limit. We showcase representative examples - covering diffraction, splitting, and interferometry - that illustrate how interactions reshape the basic elements of matter-wave optics and open new opportunities for nonlinear quantum technologies.

Title: Unraveling the Surface Stability and Chemical Reactivity of Aza-Triphenylene Monolayer under O$_2$ and H$_2$O Exposure
Authors: Soumendra Kumar Das, Prasanjit Samal, Brahmananda Chakraborty, Sridhar Sahu
Abstract: Environmental oxidation has a great impact in tuning the physical, chemical and electronic properties of two-dimensional (2D) monolayers which can affect their practical applications in nanoscale engineering devices under ambient conditions. aza-triphenylene is a recently synthesized 2D materials whose practcal applications have not been systematically studied yet. In this study, we report for the first time, the adsorption and dissociation of O$_2$ and H$_2$O molecules on the surface of 2D aza-triphenylene monolayer through first principles calculations in combination with climbing image nudged elastic band (CINEB) method. The results indicates that both the O$_2$ and H$_2$O molecules weakly interact over the monolayer surface with an adsorption energy -0.16 eV and -0.37 eV respectively. In contrast, both the molecules exhibit resistance for dissociation due to the formation of energy barriers. The transition path indicates that molecular oxygen experience two energy barriers (0.16 ev and 1.22 eV) before getting dissociated atomic oxygen. However, the dissociation of H$_2$O requires larger energy barrier (2.3 eV and 0.86 eV) due to breaking of covalent bonds and transfer of hydrogen. The strong chemical adsorption of atomic oxygen and H$^+$/OH$^-$ ions is due to the significant charge transfer from monolayer to the adsorbate as evidenced from the charge density difference and Bader charge analysis. Moreover, the dissociated configuration exhibit a larger band gap as compared to the pristine aza-triphenylene due to the strong hybridization between the p states of carbon and oxygen. our work predicts the robustness of azatriphylene monolayer against oxygen/water exposer thus ensuring their stability for device applications using these materials.

Title: Dissimilarity measures for generalized Lotka-Volterra systems on networks
Authors: Nicolás A. Márquez, Maryam Chaib De Mares, Alejandro P. Riascos
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a general framework to quantify dissimilarities between generalized Lotka-Volterra dynamical processes, ranging from classical predator-prey systems to multispecies communities interacting on networks. The proposed measures capture both transient and stationary dynamics, allowing systematic comparisons across systems with varying interaction parameters, network weights, or topologies. Our analysis shows that even subtle structural changes can lead to markedly distinct outcomes: in two-species systems, interaction strength and initial conditions strongly affect divergence, while in small directed networks, differences that are invisible at the adjacency-matrix level produce divergent dynamics. In modular networks, the fraction and distribution of negative interactions control the transition from stable to unstable dynamics, with localized perturbations within cliques yielding different global outcomes than distributed ones. Beyond structural variations, the framework also applies when modified processes follow distinct nonlinear equations, demonstrating its versatility. Taken together, these results highlight that dynamical dissimilarity measures provide a powerful tool to analyze robustness, detect structural sensitivity, and predict instabilities in nonlinear systems. More broadly, this approach supports the comparative analysis of biological systems, where complex interaction networks and nonlinear dynamics are central to stability and resilience.

Title: Bloch diode
Authors: M. Houzet, T. Vakhtel, J. S. Meyer
Abstract: In a SQUID tuned away from half-integer flux (in units of the superconducting flux quantum), the concurrence of multiple Josephson harmonics and an asymmetry between the junctions leads to the Josephson diode effect -- a nonreciprocal current-voltage characteristic manifested as an asymmetry of critical currents at opposite polarities. We predict a dual version of this effect in a gate-tunable Cooper pair transistor placed in series with a highly resistive environment. When tuned away from half-integer gate charge (in units of the Cooper pair charge) it shows an asymmetry of critical voltages at opposite polarities -- a dual diode effect we refer to as the Bloch diode effect. It arises from an asymmetry in the dispersion of the transistor's Bloch bands. A highly resistive environment can be realized with a Josephson junction array, suggesting that such a diode could be implemented using conventional superconducting quantum circuits.

Title: Kagome metals
Authors: Domenico Di Sante, Titus Neupert, Giorgio Sangiovanni, Ronny Thomale, Riccardo Comin, Ilija Zeljkovic, Joseph G. Checkelsky, Stephen D. Wilson
Abstract: Three important driving forces for creating qualitatively new phases in quantum materials are the topology of the materials' electronic band structures, frustration in the electrons' motion or magnetic interactions, and strong correlations between their charge, spin, and orbital degrees of freedom. In very few material systems do all of these aspects come together to contribute on an equal footing to stabilize new electronic states with unprecedented properties; however the search for such systems can be guided by models of configurational motifs or key sublattices that can host such physics. One of the most fascinating structural motifs for realizing this rich interplay of frustration, electronic topology, and electron correlation effects is the kagome lattice. In this review, we provide an overview of the theoretical underpinnings driving the physics of kagome lattices, and we then discuss experimental progress in realizing novel states enabled by kagome networks in crystalline materials. Different material classes are discussed with an emphasis on the phenomenologies of their electronic states and how they map to interactions arising from their kagome lattices.

Title: Giant number-parity effect and scalable spin squeezing in Luttinger liquids
Authors: Filippo Caleca, Saverio Bocini, Fabio Mezzacapo, Tommaso Roscilde
Abstract: Finite-size quantum spin systems can be magnetized by the application of a symmetry-breaking field, but in general their symmetry is expected to be restored once the field is turned off adiabatically. Recently (F. Caleca et al., arXiv:2412.15493) we have shown that systems of half-integer spins with an odd number of sites and a parity-preserving Hamiltonian can retain a finite magnetization, hence exhibiting spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) at finite size. Here we generalize this phenomenon to spin chains whose low-energy physics (in zero field) realizes a Luttinger-liquid phase. We observe that odd-sized chains can exhibit a phenomenon of finite-size quasi-SSB, in which a net sub-extensive magnetization, $M \sim N^{1-1/(4K)}$ is retained, where $N$ is the number of sites and $K$ the Luttinger exponent. Interestingly, the states prepared by turning off the symmetry-breaking field quasi-adiabatically display scalable spin squeezing -- namely stronger the bigger the system -- regardless of the parity of $N$. The scaling of the squeezing parameter is dictated again by the Luttinger exponent, $\xi_R^2 \sim N^{-1+1/(2K)}$. This result shows that scalable quantum correlations with metrological significance, associated typically with high-dimensional systems, can be found as well in gapless one-dimensional ones; and they are a direct consequence of the critical nature of Luttinger liquids.

Title: On the Excitability of Ultra-Low-Power CMOS Analog Spiking Neurons
Authors: Léopold Van Brandt, Grégoire Brandsteert, Denis Flandre
Abstract: The excitability property of spiking neurons describes their capability to output an action potential as a real-time response to an input synaptic excitation current and is central to the event-based neuromorphic computing paradigm. The spiking mechanism is analysed in a representative ultra-low-power analog neuron from the circuit literature. Relying on conventional SPICE simulations compatible with industrial transistor compact models, we establish a excitation criterion, quantified either in terms of critical supplied charge or membrane potential threshold. Only the latter is found intrinsic to the neuron, i.e. independent of the input stimulus. Rigorous analysis of the nonlinear neuron dynamics provides insight but still needs to be explored further, as well as the effect of the intrinsic noise.

Title: Lattice Thermal Transport Beyond the Quasiparticle Approximation: Nontrivial Spectral Competition between Three- and Four-Phonon Interactions
Authors: Yi Xia
Abstract: The breakdown of the quasiparticle approximation (QPA) for phonons in strongly anharmonic materials necessitates advanced first-principles frameworks for accurate lattice dynamics and thermal transport predictions. We develop a comprehensive beyond-quasiparticle approximation (BQPA) approach incorporating both three- (3ph) and four-phonon (4ph) interactions and apply it to investigate lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{\rm L}$) in MgO, PbTe, and AgCl -- materials that span a broad spectrum of anharmonicity, from weak to severe anharmonic regimes with overdamped phonons. We reveal that while BQPA consistently increases $\kappa_{\rm L}$ relative to QPA due to phonon softening when considering only 3ph interactions, the inclusion of additional 4ph interactions hardens the phonon spectrum and suppresses this enhancement, bringing BQPA and QPA predictions into close agreement via subtle spectral competition effects across all three compounds. These findings highlight that accurate modeling of $\kappa_{\rm L}$ in strongly anharmonic materials requires treating both full phonon spectral function and higher-order anharmonicity on equal footing. Our work establishes a systematic framework for modeling thermal transport in systems with overdamped phonons and provides critical insights for materials design beyond the limits of conventional phonon transport theory.

Title: Thermodynamic integration, fermion sign problem, and real-space renormalization
Authors: Koka Sathwik, Werner Krauth
Abstract: We reconsider real-space renormalization for the two-dimensional Ising model, following the path traced out by Wilson in Sect. VI of his 1975 Reviews of Modern Physics. In that reference, Wilson considerably extended the Kadanoff decimation procedure towards a possibly rigorous construction of a real-space scale-invariant hamiltonian. Wilson's construction has, to the best of our knowledge, never been fully understood and thus neither reproduced nor generalized. In the present work, we use Monte Carlo sampling in combination with thermodynamic integration in order to retrace Wilson's computation for a real-space renormalization with a number of terms in the hamiltonian. We elaborate on the connection of real-space renormalization with the fermion sign problem and discuss to which extent our Monte Carlo procedure actually implements Wilson's program from half a century ago.

Title: Entropic alignment of topologically modified ring polymers in cylindrical confinement
Authors: Sanjay Bhandarkar, Debarshi Mitra, Jürgen Horbach, Apratim Chatterji
Abstract: Under high cylindrical confinement, segments of ring polymers can be localized along the long axis of the cylinder by introducing internal loops within the ring polymer. The emergent organization of the polymer segments occurs because of the entropic repulsion between internal loops. These principles were used to identify the underlying mechanism of bacterial chromosome organization. Here, we outline functional principles associated with entropic interactions, leading to specific orientations of the ring polymers relative to their neighbors in the cylindrical confinement. We achieve this by modifying the ring polymer topology by creating internal loops of two different sizes within the polymer, and thus create an asymmetry. This allows us to strategically manipulate polymer topology such that segments of a polymer face certain other segments of a neighboring polymer. The polymers therefore behave as if they are subjected to an `effective' entropic interaction reminiscent of interactions between Ising spins. But this emergent spatial and orientational organization is not enthalpy-driven. We consider a bead spring model of flexible polymers with only repulsive excluded volume interactions between the monomers. The polymers entropically repel each other and occupy different halves of the cylinder, and moreover, the adjacent polymers preferentially re-orient themselves along the axis of the cylinder. We further substantiate our observations by free energy calculations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of the emergence of effective orientational interactions by harnessing entropic interactions in flexible polymers. The principles elucidated here could be relevant to understand the interactions between different sized loops within a large chromosome.

Title: Quantifying and minimizing dissipation in a non-equilibrium phase transition
Authors: Yuejun Shen, Zhiqiao Jiang, Yunfan Huang, Brittany M. Cleary, Yixing Jiang, Grant M. Rotskoff, Aaron M. Lindenberg
Abstract: In a finite-time continuous phase transition, topological defects emerge as the system undergoes spontaneous symmetry breaking. The Kibble-Zurek mechanism predicts how the defect density scales with the quench rate. During such processes, dissipation also arises as the system fails to adiabatically follow the control protocol near the critical point. Quantifying and minimizing this dissipation is fundamentally relevant to nonequilibrium thermodynamics and practically important for energy-efficient computing and devices. However, there are no prior experimental measurements of dissipation, or the optimization of control protocols to reduce it in many-body systems. In addition, it is an open question to what extent dissipation is correlated with the formation of defects. Here, we directly measure the dissipation generated during the voltage-driven Freedericksz transition of a liquid crystal with a sensitivity equivalent to a ~10 nanokelvin temperature rise. We observe Kibble-Zurek scaling of dissipation and its breakdown, both in quantitative agreement with existing theoretical works. We further implement a fully automated in-situ optimization approach that discovers more optimal driving protocols, reducing dissipation by a factor of three relative to a simple linear protocol.

Title: Nonlinear Mechanics of Arterial Growth
Authors: Aditya Kumar, Arash Yavari
Abstract: In this paper, we formulate a geometric theory of the mechanics of arterial growth. An artery is modeled as a finite-length thick shell that is made of an incompressible nonlinear anisotropic solid. An initial radially-symmetric distribution of finite radial and circumferential eigenstrains is assumed. Bulk growth is assumed to be isotropic. A novel framework is proposed to describe the time evolution of growth, governed by a competition between the elastic energy and a \emph{growth energy}. The governing equations are derived through a two-potential approach and using the Lagrange-d'Alembert principle. An isotropic dissipation potential is considered, which is assumed to be convex in the rate of growth function. Several numerical examples are presented that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in predicting the evolution of arterial growth and the intricate interplay among eigenstrains, residual stresses, elastic energy, growth energy, and dissipation potential. A distinctive feature of the model is that the growth variable is not constrained by an explicit upper bound; instead, growth naturally approaches a steady-state value as a consequence of the intrinsic energetic competition.

Title: Floquet Superheating
Authors: Yang Hou, Andrea Pizzi, Huike Jin, Johannes Knolle, Roderich Moessner, Hongzheng Zhao
Abstract: Periodically driven many-body systems generally heat towards a featureless 'infinite-temperature' state. As an alternative to uniform heating in a clean system, here we establish a Floquet superheating regime, where fast heating nucleates at ''hot spots" generated by rare fluctuations in the local energy with respect to an appropriate effective Hamiltonian. Striking macroscopic consequences include exceptionally long-lived prethermalization and non-ergodic bimodal distributions of macroscopic observables. Superheating is predicated on a heating rate depending strongly on the local fluctuation; in our example, this is supplied by a sharp state-selective spin-echo, where the energy absorption is strongly suppressed for low-energy states, while thermal fluctuations open up excessive heating channels. A simple phenomenological theory is developed to show the existence of a critical droplet size, which incorporates heating by the driving field as well as the heat current out of the droplet. Our results shine light on a new heating mechanism and suggest new routes towards stabilizing non-equilibrium phases of matter in driven systems.

Title: Enhanced Superconductivity at Quantum-Critical KTaO3 Interfaces
Authors: Jieun Kim, Muqing Yu, Ahmed Omran, Jiangfeng Yang, Ranjani Ramachandran, William O. Nachlas, Patrick Irvin, Jeremy Levy, Chang-Beom Eom
Abstract: Superconductivity at oxide interfaces has intrigued researchers for decades, yet the underlying pairing mechanism remains elusive. Here we demonstrate that proximity to a ferroelectric quantum critical point dramatically enhances interfacial superconductivity in KTaO3. By precisely tuning KTaO3 to its quantum critical composition through 0.8% niobium doping, we achieve a near-doubling of the superconducting transition temperature, reaching 2.9 K. Remarkably, a dome-shaped carrier density dependence emerges exclusively at the quantum critical point, contrasting sharply with the linear scaling observed in undoped interfaces. Our findings establish ferroelectric quantum criticality as a powerful mechanism for enhancing superconductivity and provide compelling evidence for soft-phonon-mediated pairing in these systems.

Title: Tunneling in multi-site mesoscopic quantum Hall circuits
Authors: D. B. Karki
Abstract: Transport properties of the single- and two-site mesoscoipc quantum Hall (QH) circuits at high transparencies can be described in terms of the lowest-order backscattering perturbations, and mapping to the boundary sine-Gordon model can be exploited in full generality. While the higher-order backscattering processes are exactly marginal in the case of corresponding three-site circuits, they become crucial in a device with four or more sites. Here, we explore the transport properties of a multi-site QH circuit with special focus on that with four sites, and report their unique quantum critical behaviors that can be accessed via transport measurements. Tunneling phenomena in multichannel QH circuits based on multi-site geometry are also investigated, and a promising route to realizing different aspects of quantum critical phenomena is offered

Title: An amended Ehrenfest theorem for the Gross-Pitaevskii equation in one- and two-dimensional potential boxes
Authors: Hidetsugu Sakaguchi, Boris A. Malomed
Abstract: It is known that the usual form of the Ehrenfest theorem (ET), which couples the motion of the center of mass (COM) of the one-dimensional (1D) wave function to the respective classical equation of motion, is not valid in the case of the potential box, confined by the zero boundary conditions. A modified form of the ET was proposed for this case, which includes an effective force originating from the interaction of the 1D quantum particle with the box edges. In this work, we derive an amended ET for the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE), which includes the cubic nonlinear term, as well as for the 2D square-shaped potential box. In the latter case, we derive an amended COM equation of motion with an effective force exerted by the edges of the rectangular box, while the nonlinear term makes no direct contribution to the 1D and 2D versions of the ET. Nonetheless, the nonlinearity affects the amended ET through the edge-generated force. As a result, the nonlinearity of the underlying GPE can make the COM motion in the potential box irregular. The validity of the amended ET for the 1D and 2D GPEs with the respective potential boxes is confirmed by the comparison of numerical simulations of the underlying GPE and the corresponding amended COM equation of motion. The reported findings are relevant to the ongoing experiments carried out for atomic Bose-Einstein condensates trapped in the box potentials.

Title: XPS Analysis of Surface Chemical Transformations in ZBLAN Glass under Thermal and Vibrational Stimuli
Authors: Ayush Subedi, Anthony Torres, Jeff Ganley
Abstract: ZBLAN glass is highly sensitive to thermal and mechanical stimuli, yet the associated surface chemical changes remain poorly understood. X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on multiple ZBLAN samples representing distinct structural states: fully amorphous, incipiently crystalline, and highly crystalline, produced through thermal treatments at 250C and 350C and vibration-assisted processing at 400C under low (L2) and high (H5) vibration levels. High-resolution F 1s, Zr 3d, Hf 4f, Ba 3d, La 3d, and Na 1s spectra show progressive peak sharpening and intensity enhancement with increasing temperature and vibration, indicating reduced surface disorder and greater local structural ordering. The most pronounced changes occur under high vibration at 400C. No binding-energy shifts were detected, confirming that all elements retain their expected oxidation states and that the observed evolution reflects structural rather than chemical changes. These results provide direct evidence that thermomechanical input enhances surface ordering in ZBLAN and clarify its role in crystallization behavior relevant to infrared optical applications.

Title: Revealing the dynamic responses of Pb under shock loading based on DFT-accuracy machine learning potential
Authors: Enze Hou, Xiaoyang Wang, Han Wang
Abstract: Lead (Pb) is a typical low-melting-point ductile metal and serves as an important model material in the study of dynamic responses. Under shock-wave loading, its dynamic mechanical behavior comprises two key phenomena: plastic deformation and shock induced phase transitions. The underlying mechanisms of these processes are still poorly understood. Revealing these mechanisms remains challenging for experimental approaches. Non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations are an alternative theoretical tool for studying dynamic responses, as they capture atomic-scale mechanisms such as defect evolution and deformation pathways. However, due to the limited accuracy of empirical interatomic potentials, the reliability of previous NEMD studies is questioned. Using our newly developed machine learning potential for Pb-Sn alloys, we revisited the microstructure evolution in response to shock loading under various shock orientations. The results reveal that shock loading along the [001] orientation of Pb exhibits a fast, reversible, and massive phase transition and stacking fault evolution. The behavior of Pb differs from previous studies by the absence of twinning during plastic deformation. Loading along the [011] orientation leads to slow, irreversible plastic deformation, and a localized FCC-BCC phase transition in the Pitsch orientation relationship. This study provides crucial theoretical insights into the dynamic mechanical response of Pb, offering a theoretical input for understanding the microstructure-performance relationship under extreme conditions.

Title: Signatures of magnetism in zigzag graphene nanoribbon embedded in h-BN lattice
Authors: Chengxin Jiang, Hui Shan Wang, Chen Chen, Lingxiu Chen, Xiujun Wang, Yibo Wang, Ziqiang Kong, Yuhan Feng, Yixin Liu, Yu Feng, Chenxi Liu, Yu Zhang, Zhipeng Wei, Maosen Guo, Aomei Tong, Gang Mu, Yumeng Yang, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Wangzhou Shi, Haomin Wang
Abstract: Zigzag edges of graphene have long been predicted to exhibit magnetic electronic state near the Fermi level, which can cause spin-related phenomena and offer unique potentials for graphene-based spintronics. However, the magnetic conduction channels along these edges have yet been reported experimentally. Here, we report the observation on signatures of magnetism in zigzag graphene nanoribbons (zGNRs) embedded in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). The in-plane bonding with BN can stabilize the edges of zGNRs, and thus enable a direct probing of the intrinsic magnetism. Firstly, the presence of magnetism of a zGNR was confirmed by scanning NV center microscopy. And then, zGNR was fabricated into a transistor with a width of ~9 nm wide and a channel length of sub-50 nm. By performing magneto-transport measurements, Fabry-Pérot interference patterns were observed in the transistor at 4 Kelvin, which indicates a coherent transport through the channel. A large magnetoresistance of ~175 {\Omega}, corresponding to a ratio of ~1.3 %, was observed at the same temperature. More importantly, such magneto-transport signal is highly anisotropic on the magnetic field direction, and its appearance extends well above room temperature. All these evidences corroborate the existence of robust magnetic ordering in the edge state of zGNR. The findings on zGNR embedded in h-BN provide an effective platform for the future exploration of graphene-based spintronic devices.

Title: Topological Phases in Non-Hermitian Nonlinear-Eigenvalue Systems
Authors: Yu-Peng Ma, Ming-Jian Gao, Jun-Hong An
Abstract: The discovery of topological phases has ushered in a new era of condensed matter physics and revealed a variety of natural and artificial materials. They obey the bulk-boundary correspondence (BBC), which guarantees the emergence of boundary states with non-zero topological invariants in the bulk. A wide attention has been paid to extending topological phases to nonlinear and non-Hermitian systems. However, the BBC and topological invariants of non-Hermitian nonlinear systems remain largely unexplored. Here, we establish a complete BBC and topological characterization of the topological phases in a class of non-Hermitian nonlinear-eigenvalue systems by introducing an auxiliary system. We restore the BBC broken by non-Hermiticity via employing the generalized Brillouin zone on the auxiliary system. Remarkably, we discover that the interplay between non-Hermiticity and nonlinearity creates an exotic complex-band topological phase that coexists with the real-band topological phase. Our results enrich the family of nonlinear topological phases and lay a foundation for exploring novel topological physics in metamaterial systems.

Title: Topological phase transitions by time-dependent electromagnetic fields in frustrated magnets: Role of dynamical and static magnetic fields
Authors: Tatsuya Shirato, Ryota Yambe, Satoru Hayami
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the effects of time-dependent electromagnetic fields on frustrated magnets with the spatial inversion symmetry. Two types of external-field setups are considered: One is a circularly polarized electromagnetic field and the other is a combination of a circularly polarized electric field and a static magnetic field. The system is modeled by a classical frustrated Heisenberg model on a triangular lattice, whose ground state is a single-$Q$ spiral spin configuration. The effects of irradiated electric and magnetic fields are taken into account by the inverse Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction and the Zeeman coupling, respectively, without heating effects. By numerically solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, we find that the two field configurations lead to distinct skyrmion crystal (SkX) phases and their associated topological phase transitions: in the former setup, SkXs composed of skyrmions with skyrmion numbers of one and two with opposite signs emerge, whereas in the latter setup, SkXs with the same sign appear. The stabilization mechanisms of these SkXs are accounted for by the competition among electromagnetic-field-induced chiral DM interactions, electric-field-induced three-spin interactions, and the Zeeman coupling based on the high-frequency expansion within the Floquet formalism. Furthermore, for the latter setup, we find that the stability region of the SkX phase varies significantly depending on the timing of the application of the circularly polarized electric field and the static magnetic field. Our findings would broaden the possible routes to generate and control SkXs by time-dependent electromagnetic fields, advancing both the theoretical comprehension and experimental control of topological spin crystals.

Title: Shape Characterization of Ferrous Burden Material of Blast Furnace Feed using Image Analysis
Authors: Arijit Chakrabarty, Aman Tripathi, Vimod Kumar, Anurag Tripathi, Arpit Agarwal, Vishwaraj Singh, Saprativ Basu, Samik Nag
Abstract: In this study, we attempt to characterize the shape of three different types of grains commonly used in the iron and steel-making industry, namely pellet, sinter and iron ore lump. We choose particles over the entire size ranges used in industrial-scale blast furnace and consider two different size ranges of pellet particles and four different size ranges for sinter and iron ore lumps. We perform image analysis to calculate size and shape-related properties of the grains. We select some of the common length scales used to measure the size of the particles and categorize them in different classes. We show that the length scales of a particular category class are well correlated with each other. We identify the independent, uncorrelated length scales for the particles from different categories. Using these uncorrelated length scales, we define different shape descriptors and obtain the distribution of these shape descriptors for each component of the blast furnace feed. Our image analysis results show that the cumulative distribution curves for these shape descriptors turn out to be nearly independent of the size range for a given type of material. Our study identifies the three key shape descriptors that are required to characterize the shape of the blast furnace feed. Two of these shape descriptors, namely the aspect ratio and the circularity, have been considered important by the researchers earlier as well. The third shape descriptor, the average contact eccentricity to the projected particle diameter ratio, usually not considered to be an important shape descriptor in previous studies, is of high relevance for Discrete Element Method simulations of granular materials.

Title: Stochasticity-induced non-Hermitian skin criticality
Authors: Xiaoyu Cheng, Hui Jiang, Jun Chen, Lei Zhang, Yee Sin Ang, Ching Hua Lee
Abstract: Typically, scaling up the size of a system does not change the shape of its energy spectrum, other than making it denser. Exceptions, however, occur in the new phenomenon of non-Hermitian skin criticality, where closely competing generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ) solutions for non-Hermitian state accumulation give rise to anomalously scaling complex spectra. In this work, we discover that such non-Hermitian criticality can generically emerge from stochasticity in the lattice bond orientation, a surprising phenomenon only possible in 2D or beyond. Marked by system size-dependent amplification rate, it can be physically traced to the proliferation of feedback loops arising from excess local non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) accumulation induced by structural disorder. While weak disorder weakens the amplification as intuitively anticipated, stronger disorder enigmatically strengthens the amplification almost universally, scaling distinctly from conventional critical system. By representing cascades of local excess NHSE as ensembles of effectively coupled chains, we analytically derived a critical GBZ that predicts how state amplification scales with the system size and disorder strength, highly consistent with empirical observations. Our new mechanism for disordered-facilitated amplification applies generically to structurally perturbed non-Hermitian lattices with broken reciprocity, and would likely find applications in non-Hermitian sensing through various experimentally mature meta-material platforms.

Title: Numerical investigation of electrostatically confined excitons in monolayer $\text{MoSe}_2$
Authors: Lefan Dolg, Moritz Scharfstädt, Andrea Bergschneider, Dante M. Kennes, Silvia Viola-Kusminskiy
Abstract: We investigate exciton confinement to a quantum wire in monolayer $\text{MoSe}_2$ where the confinement is achieved by a p-i-n junction. We employ an effective-mass exciton model and solve the problem numerically, reflecting device geometries found in experimental state-of-the-art set up. Our method allows us to investigate the entire spectrum of confined states. We show the emergence of quantum confinement and study the dependence of the confined states as a function of electrical gate voltages, which are experimentally tunable parameters. We find that the confined states can be divided into bright and dark states with the dark states having small but finite oscillator strengths. Their oscillator strengths are low enough that they have not yet been detected in experiments, whereas the spectrum of the bright exciton states reproduces recent experimental measurements. Our results provide insight into the theoretical background of confined exciton states beyond the ground state and pave the way for the development of new confinement schemes as well as avenues to access the previously not detected dark states.

Title: Accelerated Prediction of Temperature-Dependent Lattice Thermal Conductivity via Ensembled Machine Learning Models
Authors: Piyush Paliwal, Aftab Alam
Abstract: Lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_L$) is a key physical property governing heat transport in solids, with direct relevance to thermoelectrics, thermal barrier coatings, and heat management applications. However, while experimental determination of $\kappa_L$ is challenging, its theoretical calculation via ab initio methods particularly using density functional theory (DFT) is computationally intensive, often more demanding than electronic transport calculations by an order of magnitude. In this work, we present a machine learning (ML) approach to predict $\kappa_L$ with DFT-level accuracy over a wide temperature range (100-1000 K). Among various models trained on DFT-calculated data \textcolor{black}{obtained} from literature, the Extra Trees Regressor (ETR) yielded the best performance on log-scaled $\kappa_L$, achieving an average $R^2$ of 0.9994 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.0466 $W\,m^{-1}\,K^{-1}$. The ETR model also generalized well to twelve previously unseen (randomly chosen) low and high $\kappa_L$ compounds with diverse space group symmetries, reaching an $R^2$ of 0.961 against DFT benchmarks. Notably, the model excels in predicting $\kappa_L$ for both low- and high-symmetry compounds, enabling efficient high-throughput screening. We also demonstrate this capability by screening ultralow and ultrahigh $\kappa_L$ candidates among 960 half-Heusler \textcolor{black}{compounds} and 60,000 ICSD compounds from the AFLOW database. This result shows reliability of model developed for screening of potential thermoelectric materials. At the end, we have tested model's prediction ability on systems that have experimental $\kappa_L$ available that shows model's ability to search material that has desirable experimental $\kappa_L$ for thermoelectric applications.

Title: Variationally Consistent Framework for Finite-Strain Microelasticity
Authors: Tushar Jogi
Abstract: Modeling microstructural evolution at large strains requires mechanical formulations that remain thermodynamically consistent while capturing significant lattice rotations and transformation-induced stresses. However, most existing finite-strain microelasticity and phase-field approaches apply macroscopic boundary conditions heuristically, preventing proper stress relaxation and violating the Hill-Mandel work equivalence required for homogenization. These limitations can misrepresent stress states and transformation pathways under finite strains. Here a variationally consistent finite-strain microelasticity framework is presented that couples microscopic and macroscopic mechanical equilibrium through a single energy functional. The resulting Euler-Lagrange conditions, periodic micro-equilibrium and macroscopic stress balance, are solved using a staggered FFT-Newton algorithm that combines a spectral fixed-point update for local fields with a Newton step for the homogenized deformation gradient. The formulation accommodates general hyperelastic constitutive laws and arbitrary transformation gradients. Benchmarks demonstrate accurate recovery of small-strain Eshelby solutions and systematic nonlinear deviations at large dilatations. Applied to deformation twinning in magnesium, the framework reproduces lenticular morphology, stress redistribution, and faster lateral growth consistent with experiments. This approach establishes a rigorous and scalable foundation for finite-strain phase-field simulations of coherent transformations under general stress or mixed boundary conditions.

Title: Vortex patterns of a 2D rotating Bose-Einstein condensate at the critical rotational speed
Authors: Bao-Duy Le, Dinh-Thi Nguyen
Abstract: We introduce a GPU-accelerated variational framework with exact projection onto the Lowest Landau Level to probe vortex patterns in rapidly rotating two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates. For repulsive interactions, our approach faithfully reproduces Abrikosov vortex lattices, achieving quantitative alignment with Thomas-Fermi theory and the Abrikosov constant, while underscoring the profound analogy between superfluid vortex ordering and Abrikosov lattices in type-II superconductors. In the attractive regime, we reveal that weak attractions sustain stable vortex arrays, whereas stronger attractions quench vortices, trigger radial contraction, and culminate in collapse at the Gagliardo-Nirenberg threshold. These findings deliver a cohesive numerical benchmark for vortex formation and collapse dynamics, forging a rigorous link between superfluidity and superconductivity in rotating quantum matter.

Title: Numerical renormalization group integrated Hamiltonian truncation: Toward generic deformation of integrable lattice models
Authors: Xiaodong He, Xiao Wang, Jianda Wu
Abstract: We present a hybrid lattice Hamiltonian truncation method that integrates the numerical renormalization group (NRG) with a truncated lattice integrable spectrum. The technique is tailored for generic deformations of integrable lattice models, where the NRG enables a controlled incorporation of high-energy states. The method extends the basis set more effectively and efficiently than brute-force truncation, meanwhile significantly reducing errors. We show its capability on two paradigmatic models: an Ising chain in a magnetic field and a quantum Ising ladder. The resulting dynamical structure factors accurately capture the essential low-energy physics, including the $E_8$ and $\mathcal{D}_8^{(1)}$ excitations of the former and later models, respectively, demonstrating the approach's computational efficiency and high performance.

Title: Dynamical Networking of Polymer Networks with Dedicated Cross-linker Particles

Muller-Nedebock (Department of Physics, Stellenbosch University, National Institute for Theoretical and Computational Sciences, Stellenbosch), Giuseppe Pellicane (National Institute for Theoretical and Computational Sciences, Stellenbosch, School of Chemistry &amp; Physics, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche, Odontoiatriche e delle Immagini Morfologiche e Funzionali, Universita degli Studi di Messina, Messina)
Abstract: This paper extends a field-theoretical dynamical networking formalism for mesoscopic polymer dynamics to explicitly include dedicated cross-linker particles. Cross-linkers are represented within a Martin-Siggia-Rose generating functional and reversibly coupled to polymers through Gaussian networking fields, enabling an approximation scheme that reduces their degrees of freedom while remaining compatible with polymer dynamics. The framework is applied to a two-species polymer system in which intra- and inter-species cross-linking are assigned different statistical advantages. Effective networking potentials are derived and used to calculate correlation functions and dynamic structure factors. To validate these results, molecular dynamics simulations of semi-flexible polymers with reversible intra- and inter-species cross-linking are performed. Simulations show that cross-linking decreases polymer persistence lengths and local alignment, and the resulting trajectories yield dynamic structure factors consistent with theoretical predictions. In both approaches, cross-linking broadens the diffusive peaks and enhances the high-frequency tails of the structure factors. Together, theory and simulation provide complementary insights into the dynamics of cross-linked polymers, establishing a tractable framework that captures essential features observed in experiments and offering a basis for exploring more complex synthetic and biological networks.

Title: Modified Monte Carlo method with thermostat algorithm for model orthonickelates
Authors: V. S. Ryumshin, Yu. D. Panov, V. A. Ulitko, A. S. Moskvin
Abstract: The results of numerical simulation using a modified Monte Carlo method with a thermostat algorithm for a pseudospin model of orthonickelates are presented. Temperature phase diagrams are constructed for various degrees of filling and for various parameters of the model, and the effect of local correlations on the critical temperatures of the model orthonickelate is investigated. The possibility of detecting phase inhomogeneous states is shown. The numerical simulation results show good qualitative agreement with the analytical results in the mean field approximation.

Title: A tractable framework for phase transitions in phase-fluctuating disordered 2D superconductors: applications to bilayer MoS$_2$ and disordered InO$_x$ thin films
Authors: F. Yang, L. Q. Chen
Abstract: Starting from the purely microscopic model, we go beyond conventional mean-field theory and develop a self-consistent microscopic thermodynamic framework for disordered 2D superconductors. It incorporates the fermionic Bogoliubov quasiparticles, bosonic Nambu-Goldstone (NG) quantum and thermal phase fluctuations in the presence of long-range Coulomb interactions, and topological Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) vortex-antivortex fluctuations on an equal footing, to self-consistently treat the superconducting gap and superfluid density. This unified phase-fluctuating description naturally recovers the previously known limiting results: the superconducting gap in the 2D limit can remain robust against long-wavelength NG phase fluctuations at $T=0^+$ due to Coulomb-induced regularization, while the gradual proliferation of BKT fluctuations as the system approaches criticality drives a separation between the global superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ and the gap-closing temperature $T^*$. In contrast to mean-field theory, which predicts 2D superconductivity to be independent of carrier density and non-magnetic disorder (Anderson theorem), the incorporation of phase fluctuations generates a density- and disorder-dependent zero-point gap $\Delta(0)$ and consequently $T_c$ and $T^*$. Remarkably, applications to bilayer MoS$_2$ [Nat. Nanotechnol. 14, 1123 (2019)] and disordered InO$_x$ thin films [Nat. Phys. 21, 104 (2025)] quantitatively reproduce key experimental observations in excellent agreement. The framework offers a useful theoretical tool for understanding phase-fluctuation-dominated superconductivity.

Title: Crossover dynamics and non-Gaussian fluctuations in inertial active chains
Authors: Manish Patel, Subhajit Paul, Debasish Chaudhuri
Abstract: We study the dynamics of inertial active particles in a one-dimensional chain with harmonic nearest-neighbor interactions, highlighting the interplay of persistence, interaction, and inertial timescales. Using a Green's function approach, we derive the mean-squared displacement (MSD) and mean-squared change in velocity (MSCV), revealing multiple crossovers between ballistic, diffusive, and subdiffusive regimes and providing analytic expressions for scaling coefficients and crossover times. Non-Gaussian deviations in active Brownian particles are captured through excess kurtosis, reflecting heavy-tailed, finite-support, or bimodal distributions that evolve systematically over time. Time-dependent probability distributions exhibit distinct data collapses within different temporal regimes, confirming the robustness of the scaling behavior. Overall, this framework connects multiparticle interactions to microscopic dynamics, revealing experimentally accessible signatures of inertia in active matter.

Title: Spectroscopic signatures of emergent elementary excitations in a kinetically constrained long-range interacting two-dimensional spin system
Authors: Tobias Kaltenmark, Chris Nill, Christian Groß, Igor Lesanovsky
Abstract: Lattice spin models featuring kinetic constraints constitute a paradigmatic setting for the investigation of glassiness and localization phenomena. The intricate dynamical behavior of these systems is a result of the dramatically reduced connectivity between many-body configurations. This truncation of transition pathways often leads to a fragmentation of the Hilbert space, yielding highly collective and therefore often slow dynamics. Moreover, this mechanism supports the formation of characteristic elementary excitations, which we investigate here theoretically in a two-dimensional Rydberg lattice gas. We explore their properties as a function of interaction strength and range, and illustrate how they can be experimentally probed via sideband spectroscopy. Here, we show that the transition rate to certain delocalized superposition states of elementary excitations displays collective many-body enhancement.

Title: Spin-orbit driven $J_{eff} = 1/2$ magnetism in a d$^7$ triangular-lattice monolayer cobaltate
Authors: Ritwik Das, Soumen Basak, Mohammad Rezwan Habib, Indra Dasgupta
Abstract: Recent theoretical and experimental advances have identified cobaltates with a high-spin $d^7$ electronic configuration as promising hosts for spin-orbit entangled $J_{eff} = 1/2$ magnetism that can support bond-dependent exchange interactions. In two-dimensional triangular lattices, the coexistence of such exchange frustration along with geometric frustration gives rise to a rich landscape of competing magnetic phases, establishing monolayer triangular $d^7$ cobaltates as a compelling platform for frustrated magnetism. Here we investigate a representative triangular-lattice monolayer cobaltate CoBr$_2$, where first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal a dominant nearest-neighbor $t_{2g}$-$e_g$ hopping channel that enhances the ferromagnetic Kitaev-type exchange interactions. In contrast, the nearest-neighbor Heisenberg term is highly sensitive to a direct $t_{2g}$-$t_{2g}$ hopping path and electronic correlations. The magnetic exchange parameters are evaluated using the hopping amplitudes obtained from DFT calculations within an exact diagonalization framework. We construct the first and third nearest neighbor Heisenberg exchange dependent $J_1$-$J_3$ magnetic phase diagram in the physically relevant regime and identify multiple competing ground states, including ferromagnetic, stripy, spiral, and $120^{\circ}$ antiferromagnetic orders. The Luttinger-Tisza analysis further predicts a Z$_2$ vortex crystal phase, while exact diagonalization reveals a bond-nematic phase stabilized by the longer-range couplings. Going beyond the conventional bond-independent XXZ picture typically applied to Co$^{2+}$ systems, our results on monolayer CoBr$_2$ establish d$^7$ cobalt dihalides as a promising platform to explore the interplay of long-range Heisenberg and bond-dependent exchange interactions that can stabilize diverse magnetic ground states on a triangular lattice.

Title: Nontrivial flat bands and quantum Hall crossovers in square-octagon lattice materials
Authors: Amrita Mukherjee, Rahul Verma, Pritesh Srivastava, Bahadur Singh
Abstract: Coexistence of nontrivial topology and flat electronic bands in low-energy lattices provides a fertile platform for correlated quantum states. The square-octagon lattice hosts Dirac nodes and flat bands at half-filling, yet the influence of intrinsic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and staggered magnetic flux on its topological and flat-band properties remains largely unexplored. Here, we examine this lattice using tight-binding models that include SOC and magnetic flux, uncovering a quantum spin Hall phase with spin Chern number $C_s=1$, crossovers to quantum anomalous Hall phases with $C=1$ and $C=2$, and higher-order topological insulator phases carrying quantized quadrupolar corner charges. The initially dispersionless flat bands evolve into quasi-flat, topologically nontrivial bands with uniform quantum geometry and large flatness ratios, conducive to fractional Chern insulator states. We further identify realistic material candidates, including octagraphene, transition-metal dichalcogenides, synthetic $\mathrm{MoSi_2N_4}$, and magnetic $\alpha$-MnO$_2$, as potential candidates for realizing tunable topological phases intertwined with flat-band physics, opening new opportunities for correlated topological matter.

Title: Diffraction induced quantum chaos in a one-dimensional Bose gas
Authors: M. Olshanii, G. Aupetit-Diallo, S. G. Jackson, P. Vignolo, M. Albert
Abstract: We investigate the Lieb--Liniger model of interacting one-dimensional bosons coupled to a localized impurity, modeled by a delta barrier. While the Lieb--Liniger gas is integrable, the impurity breaks integrability and induces a transition towards quantum chaos. We show that the low-energy spectrum exhibits random-matrix statistics, in striking contrast to the Bohigas--Giannoni--Schmit conjecture, where chaotic behavior typically emerges at high energy. For two bosons, the odd-parity sector remains integrable, whereas the even-parity sector displays clear signatures of chaos at low energy and a crossover back to quasi-integrable behavior at higher energies. For three bosons, both parity sectors exhibit spectral statistics close to chaos at low energy. We argue that this unconventional form of many-body quantum chaos originates from diffractive processes induced by the impurity.

Title: Pressure-induced superconductivity in LaP2 with graphenelike phosphorus layer
Authors: Mingxin Zhang, Cuiying Pei, Bangshuai Zhu, Qi Wang, Juefei Wu, Yanpeng Qi
Abstract: Materials with graphene-like layers attract tremendous attention due to their electronic structures and superconducting properties. In this study, we synthesized LaP2 polycrystalline and observed a superconducting transition around 30 GPa. The critical temperature Tc increases monotonically with pressure, which is nearing saturation and reaches 7.8 K at 78 GPa. The synchrotron X-ray diffraction experiments confirm the superconducting transition originates from a structure transition to the P6/mmm phase under high pressure, suggesting the observation of graphene-like phosphorus layers in transition metal phosphides. By first-principles calculations, we provide more evidence for the stability of the graphene-like phosphorus layers in LaP2. Our findings are helpful for the understanding of the LaP2 phase diagram under high pressure, and could shed light on the research of unique structures in transition metal phosphides under high pressure.

Title: Generalized Aubry-André-Harper model with power-law quasiperiodic potentials
Authors: Ya-Nan Wang, Wen-Long You, Zhihao Xu, Gaoyong Sun
Abstract: We investigate a generalized Aubry-André-Harper (AAH) model with non-reciprocal hopping and power-law quasiperiodic potentials $V(i) = V\left[ \cos(2\pi \beta i) \right]^p$. Our study reveals that the interplay between nonreciprocity, quasiperiodicity, and the power-law exponent $p$ gives rise to a variety of phase transitions and localization phenomena. In the Hermitian case, the system undergoes a direct transition from extended to localized phases for $p=1, 2$, while for \(p \geq 3\), an intermediate mixed phase emerges, characterized by the coexistence of extended and localized states and the presence of mobility edges. Importantly, we find that high inverse participation ratio (IPR) states appear at specific energy levels, whose positions are accurately described by the universal relation \(x_n = n\beta - \lfloor n\beta \rfloor\), with a mirror-symmetric spatial distribution. In the non-Hermitian regime, the energy spectrum becomes complex and the \(\mathcal{PT}\) transition coincides with the extended-to-localized phase boundary for \(p = 1, 2\), whereas for \(p \geq 3\), \(\mathcal{PT}\)-symmetry breaking occurs at the mixed-to-localized phase transition. This work reveals how power-law quasiperiodic potentials and non-reciprocal hopping govern phase transitions, providing new insight into localization phenomena of quasiperiodic systems.

Title: Spin Accumulation based deep MOKE Microscopy
Authors: Jean Rodriguez, Holger Grisk, Alberto Anadón, Harjinder Singh, Gregory Malinowski, Michel Hehn, Javier Curiale, Jon Gorchon
Abstract: Magnetic imaging techniques are widespread critical tools used in fields such as magnetism, spintronics or even superconductivity. Among them, one of the most versatile methods is the magneto-optical Kerr effect. However, as soon as light is blocked from interacting with the magnetic layer, such as in deeply buried layers, optical techniques become ineffective. In this work, we present a spin-accumulation based magneto-optical Kerr effect (SA-MOKE) microscopy technique that enables imaging of a magnetic thin-films covered by thick and opaque metallic layers. The technique is based on the generation and detection of transient spin-accumulations that propagate through the thick metallic layer. These spin-accumulation signals are directly triggered and detected optically on the same side, lifting any substrate transparency requirements. The spin-accumulation signals detected on a Cu layer decay with a characteristic length of 60 nm, much longer than the 12 nm optical penetration depth, allowing for detection of magnetic contrast with Cu capping layers up to hundreds of nm. This method should enable magnetic imaging in a wide-range of experiments where the surface of interest is covered by electrodes.

Title: Spin-Lattice Relaxation in Two-Dimensional Superconducting BKT Transition
Authors: Wei-Wei Yang, Shao-Hang Shi, Zongsheng Zhou, Zi-Xiang Li, Kun Jiang, Jiangping Hu
Abstract: Two-dimensional superconductors undergo a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition driven by vortex-antivortex unbinding, yet experimental signatures beyond transport remain limited. Here, we show that the spin-lattice relaxation rate provides a direct probe of this transition. In a 2-dimensional $s$-wave superconductor, $1/T_1T$ develops a Hebel-Slichter-like peak around $T_{\rm{BKT}}$, originating from the emergence of coherence peaks in the density of states, while no peak appears at the pair formation scale $T_{\rm{BCS}}$. We further extend our analysis to the $d$-wave superconductor. Our results highlight spin-lattice relaxation rate as a sensitive tool to detect the superconducting BKT transition and open routes to exploring its manifestation in unconventional pairing states.

Title: Tuning of Weyl point emergence in multi-terminal Josephson junctions using quantum point contacts
Authors: Kento Takemura, Mikio Eto, Tomohiro Yokoyama
Abstract: Multi-terminal Josephson junction with three or more superconductors is an attractive quantum system to emerge and tune exotic electronic states. In four terminal Josephson junctions, the Weyl physics, namely topologically protected zero energy state, emerges without assuming any exotic materials. In this study, we consider the four-terminal Josephson junction with the quantum point contact structures between the mesoscopic normal region and four superconducting terminals. The quantum point contacts can tune electrically the number of conduction channels. We theoretically investigate an effect of the increase of channels on the emergence of Weyl points. The increase of channels causes the increase of Andreev bound states in the system, which increase the emergence probability of Weyl points. When all terminals have two channels, the emergence probability is up to 17\%, which is about four times larger than that for all single channel junctions. We consider the balance of the number of conduction channels in the four terminals. When the number of channels is unbalanced, the increase of emergence probability is suppressed.

Title: Local indirect magnetoelectric coupling at twin walls in CaMnO$_3$
Authors: Ida C. Skogvoll, Benjamin A. D. Williamson, Sverre M. Selbach
Abstract: Ferroelastic twin walls in centrosymmetric perovskites can host emergent polar and magnetic properties forbidden in the bulk. We use density functional theory calculations to study the geometry and magnetic properties of ferroelastic domain walls in orthorhombic CaMnO$_3$, which belongs to the most common perovskite space group, $Pnma$. At the wall, the inherent inversion symmetry-breaking induces local polar distortions dependent on the wall geometry, which couple to the magnetic order through the octahedral distortions. Noncollinear calculations reveal enhanced out-of-plane magnetic moments on the Mn atoms and a local, finite magnetization confined to the wall. Strain fields across twin walls thus give rise to coexistence of polarization and magnetization as well as magnetoelectric response that is absent and symmetry-forbidden in bulk CaMnO$_3$. We propose that magnetoelectric coupling and coexisting polarization and magnetization can emerge at twin walls in bulk centrosymmetric antiferromagnets.

Title: Smoothed-Cubic Spin-Glass Model of Random Lasers
Authors: Marcello Benedetti, Luca Leuzzi
Abstract: We study the equilibrium glassy behavior of a multimode random laser model with nonlinear four-body quenched disordered interactions and a global smoothed-cubic constraint on mode intensities. This constraint, which provides a more realistic representation of gain saturation than the commonly used spherical constraint, prevents intensity condensation while preserving the dense, long-range interaction structure characteristic of many multistate random lasers. The model effective Hamiltonian is a function of mode amplitudes with random frequencies and is defined on a complete mode-locked graph. Using large-scale GPU-accelerated Monte Carlo simulations with the Parallel Tempering algorithm, we analyze systems of varying sizes to probe their thermodynamic-limit behavior. Finite-size scaling of the specific heat, of the Parisi overlap distributions, and of the inverse participation ratio's reveals a spin-glass transition, with critical exponents matching the mean-field Random Energy Model universality class. The smoothed-cubic constraint produces broad, non-condensed intensity distributions, avoiding the pseudo-condensation seen in spherical models on the same interaction graph. Our results show that more realistic gain-saturation constraints preserve spin-glass characteristics while enabling simulations of larger, more dilute systems, providing a robust framework for studying glassy random lasers with self-starting mode-locking.

Title: Effects of the Next-Nearest-Neighbor Hopping on the Low-Dimensional Hubbard Model: Ferromagnetism, Antiferromagnetism, and Superconductivity
Authors: Luhang Yang, Adrian E. Feiguin, Thomas P. Devereaux, Elbio Dagotto
Abstract: The Hubbard model has attracted considerable interest due to its prototypical role in describing strongly interacting electronic systems, such as high-critical-temperature superconductors as well as many novel quantum materials. By introducing next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) hoppings to the Hubbard model, the phase diagram becomes richer, and fascinating phenomena arise in both, one-dimensional chains and square lattices, such as: antiferromagnetism (AFM), ferromagnetism (FM), superconductivity (SC), as well as charge orders, among others. Moreover, NNN hoppings play a fundamental role in understanding effects of doping on magnetism and pairing orders in strongly interacting regimes. In this article, we review the recent progress in understanding the different competing phases of this model in one and two dimensions from a computational perspective. We comment on the pressing technical challenges, illustrate the controversial results concerning the emergence of the SC phase, and conclude with our perspectives on future explorations.

Title: First Principles study of Photocatalytic Water Splitting in BO Monolayer: Effect of Strain and Surface Functionalization
Authors: Soumendra Kumar Das, Smruti Ranjan Parida, Prasanjit Samal, Brahmananda Chakraborty, Sridhar Sahu
Abstract: Light element based two dimensional (2D) materials are promising photocatalysts for hydrogen production via water splitting. Boron oxide (BO) is a recently synthesized 2D monolayer which has yet to be thoroughly explored for its potential applications. In this article, using first principles calculations, we report, for the first time, the visible-light photocatalytic activity of a BO monolayer for water splitting under mechanical strain and surface modification with single- and double-atom decorations (C, N, Si, Ge, P, As). The pristine BO monolayer exhibits an indirect band gap of 3.8 eV with band edges spanning the water redox potentials, but its optical absorption lies in the UV region (~ 4.5 eV). Strain engineering tunes the band gap and band alignment with a minimal shifting in the optical absorption (~0.5 eV). Single atom decoration produces a metallic state for elements like N, P, As, and an insulating state for single C, Si, Ge with a partial shifting in optical absorption. In contrast, double atom decoration produces substantial band gap reduction, improved band alignment, a pronounced red-shift in optical absorption into the visible range (1.6 to 3.2 eV) thus satisfying the criteria for water splitting. The stability of all the adsorbed configurations was confirmed by negative formation energy and ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations. These findings suggest BO monolayer functionalization can improve photocatalytic efficiency, providing hydrogen generation insights.

Title: Exploring the experimental foundation with rupture and delayed rupture

Abstract: We carry out uniaxial continuous and step stretching of various crosslinked polymer networks to demonstrate how characteristics of rupture (from continuous stretching) and delayed rupture (from step stretching) can be used to probe the structure of the emergent kinetic theory of bond dissociation (KTBD) for elastomeric failure. Based on delayed rupture experiments, we show that the network lifetime tntw, taken as the incubation time for delayed rupture, depends on temperature in an Arrhenius like manner and is exponentially sensitive to the degree of network stretching (depicted by step-stretch ratio ). Rupture during continuous stretching for a wide range of stretch rates takes place on timescales inversely proportional to the stretch rate. The elapsed time at rupture is found to be comparable to at various values of L/L0b = L/L0ss in a wide range of temperature, affording the experimental basis for the premise of the KTBD. Having identified the hidden internal clock , continuous stretching tests at different temperatures are performed to show the existence of a new time temperature equivalence (TTE): fast stretching at higher temperatures is equivalent to slow stretching at lower temperatures: different pairs of rate and temperature can produce the rupture at the same tensile strength and strain.

Title: Density of reflection resonances in one-dimensional disordered Schrödinger operators
Authors: Yan V. Fyodorov, Jan Meibohm
Abstract: We develop an analytic approach to evaluating the density $\rho ({\cal E},\Gamma)$ of complex resonance poles with real energies $\mathcal{E}$ and widths $\Gamma$ in the pure reflection problem from a one-dimensional disordered sample with white-noise random potential. We start with establishing a general link between the density of resonances and the distribution of the reflection coefficient $r=|R(E,L)|^2$, where $R(E,L)$ is the reflection amplitude, at {\it complex} energies $E = {\cal E} +i\eta$, identifying the parameter $\eta>0$ with the uniform rate of absorption within the disordered medium. We show that leveraging this link allows for a detailed analysis of the resonance density in the weak disorder limit. In particular, for a (semi)infinite sample, it yields an explicit formula for $\rho ({\cal E},\Gamma)$, describing the crossover from narrow to broad resonances in a unified way. Similarly, our approach yields a limiting formula for $\rho ({\cal E},\Gamma)$ in the opposite case of a short disordered sample, with size much smaller than the localization length. This regime seems to have not been systematically addressed in the literature before, with the corresponding analysis requiring an accurate and rather non-trivial implementation of WKB-like asymptotics in the scattering problem. Finally, we study the resonance statistics numerically for the one-dimensional Anderson tight-binding model and compare the results with our analytic expressions.

Title: Lieb-Schultz-Mattis-Type and Laughlin-Type Argument for the Quantum Hall Effect in Lattice Fermions with Spiral Boundary Conditions
Authors: Masaaki Nakamura, Masanori Yamanaka
Abstract: We derive the condition for the occurrence of the quantum Hall effect in two-dimensional lattice systems, expressed as $\phi\nu-\rho\in\mathbb{Z}$, where $\phi$, $\nu$, and $\rho$ denote the magnetic flux, the Chern number, and the electron density, respectively. By employing spiral boundary conditions, which treat the system as an extended one-dimensional chain, this condition is obtained directly through a Lieb-Schultz-Mattis-type and Laughlin-type argument. This approach improves upon the preceding work based on conventional periodic boundary conditions, where the condition was derived indirectly containing redundant system-size dependence. The key to this approach is that the spatial directions of the external force and the response can be manipulated by a factor of the system size.

Title: A High-Efficiency Three-Stroke Quantum Isochoric Heat Engine: From Infinite Potential Wells to Magic Angle Twisted Bilayer Graphene
Authors: Hadi Mohammed Soufy, Colin Benjamin
Abstract: We introduce a three-stroke quantum isochoric cycle that functions as a heat engine operating between two thermal reservoirs. Implemented for a particle confined in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, the cycle's performance is benchmarked against the classical three-stroke triangular and isochoric engines. We find that the quantum isochoric cycle achieves a higher efficiency than both classical counterparts and also surpasses the efficiency of the recently proposed three-stroke quantum isoenergetic cycle. Owing to its reduced number of strokes, the design substantially lowers control complexity in nanoscale thermodynamic devices, offering a more feasible route to experimental realization compared to conventional four-stroke architectures. We further evaluate the cycle in graphene-based systems under an external magnetic field, including monolayer graphene (MLG), AB-stacked bilayer graphene (BLG), and twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) at both magic and non-magic twist angles. Among these platforms, magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) attains the highest efficiency at fixed work output, highlighting its promise for quantum thermodynamic applications.

Title: Quantum complexity across thermal phase transition in the transverse field Ising chain with long-range couplings
Authors: Meghadeepa Adhikary, Nishan Ranabhat, Mario Collura
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of the Schmidt gap, the von Neumann entanglement entropy, and the non-stabiliserness in proximity to the classical phase transition of the one-dimensional long-range transverse-field Ising model (LRTFIM). Leveraging the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) within a tensor-network formulation, we simulate thermal states through their purified tensor-network representations. Our results show that these observables, typically regarded as hallmarks of quantum criticality, exhibit pronounced and coherent signatures even at a classical thermal transition, highlighting the emergence of quantum complexity as the system nears thermal criticality.

Title: Damping of phonons in one-dimensional quantum fluids
Authors: Federica Cataldini, Nataliia Bazhan, João Sabino, Philipp Schüttelkopf, Mohammadamin Tajik, Frederik S. Møller, Si-Cong Ji, Sebastian Erne, Igor Mazets, Jörg Schmiedmayer
Abstract: Collective excitations in one-dimensional (1D) quantum fluids are expected to propagate almost without dissipation. Here we directly excite phonon modes in a weakly interacting 1D Bose gas and study their time evolution. In the linear response regime, damping is surprisingly fast and quantitatively follows the non-analytic scaling predicted by Andreev's hydrodynamic description. For stronger excitations, we observe a crossover to a highly nonlinear regime characterized by wave breaking, captured by the finite-temperature nonlinear Schrödinger evolution. Our results resolve a long-standing question on the fate of phonons in 1D Bose gases, and open new pathways to study non-linear relaxation in quantum many-body systems.

Abstract: We explore the ability of GPT-4 to perform ad-hoc schema based information extraction from scientific literature. We assess specifically whether it can, with a basic prompting approach, replicate two existing material science datasets, given the manuscripts from which they were originally manually extracted. We employ materials scientists to perform a detailed manual error analysis to assess where the model struggles to faithfully extract the desired information, and draw on their insights to suggest research directions to address this broadly important task.

Abstract: Developing large-scale foundational datasets is a critical milestone in advancing artificial intelligence (AI)-driven scientific innovation. However, unlike AI-mature fields such as natural language processing, materials science, particularly polymer research, has significantly lagged in developing extensive open datasets. This lag is primarily due to the high costs of polymer synthesis and property measurements, along with the vastness and complexity of the chemical space. This study presents PolyOmics, an omics-scale computational database generated through fully automated molecular dynamics simulation pipelines that provide diverse physical properties for over $10^5$ polymeric materials. The PolyOmics database is collaboratively developed by approximately 260 researchers from 48 institutions to bridge the gap between academia and industry. Machine learning models pretrained on PolyOmics can be efficiently fine-tuned for a wide range of real-world downstream tasks, even when only limited experimental data are available. Notably, the generalisation capability of these simulation-to-real transfer models improve significantly as the size of the PolyOmics database increases, exhibiting power-law scaling. The emergence of scaling laws supports the "more is better" principle, highlighting the significance of ultralarge-scale computational materials data for improving real-world prediction performance. This unprecedented omics-scale database reveals vast unexplored regions of polymer materials, providing a foundation for AI-driven polymer science.

Title: Predicting Grain Growth in Polycrystalline Materials Using Deep Learning Time Series Models
Authors: Eliane Younes, Elie Hachem, Marc Bernacki
Abstract: Grain Growth strongly influences the mechanical behavior of materials, making its prediction a key objective in microstructural engineering. In this study, several deep learning approaches were evaluated, including recurrent neural networks (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), temporal convolutional networks (TCN), and transformers, to forecast grain size distributions during grain growth. Unlike full-field simulations, which are computationally demanding, the present work relies on mean-field statistical descriptors extracted from high-fidelity simulations. A dataset of 120 grain growth sequences was processed into normalized grain size distributions as a function of time. The models were trained to predict future distributions from a short temporal history using a recursive forecasting strategy. Among the tested models, the LSTM network achieved the highest accuracy (above 90\%) and the most stable performance, maintaining physically consistent predictions over extended horizons while reducing computation time from about 20 minutes per sequence to only a few seconds, whereas the other architectures tended to diverge when forecasting further in time. These results highlight the potential of low-dimensional descriptors and LSTM-based forecasting for efficient and accurate microstructure prediction, with direct implications for digital twin development and process optimization.

Title: Benchmarking GNNs for OOD Materials Property Prediction with Uncertainty Quantification
Authors: Liqin Tan, Pin Chen, Menghan Liu, Xiean Wang, Jianhuan Cen, Qingsong Zou
Abstract: We present MatUQ, a benchmark framework for evaluating graph neural networks (GNNs) on out-of-distribution (OOD) materials property prediction with uncertainty quantification (UQ). MatUQ comprises 1,375 OOD prediction tasks constructed from six materials datasets using five OFM-based and a newly proposed structure-aware splitting strategy, SOAP-LOCO, which captures local atomic environments more effectively. We evaluate 12 representative GNN models under a unified uncertainty-aware training protocol that combines Monte Carlo Dropout and Deep Evidential Regression (DER), and introduce a novel uncertainty metric, D-EviU, which shows the strongest correlation with prediction errors in most tasks. Our experiments yield two key findings. First, the uncertainty-aware training approach significantly improves model prediction accuracy, reducing errors by an average of 70.6\% across challenging OOD scenarios. Second, the benchmark reveals that no single model dominates universally: earlier models such as SchNet and ALIGNN remain competitive, while newer models like CrystalFramer and SODNet demonstrate superior performance on specific material properties. These results provide practical insights for selecting reliable models under distribution shifts in materials discovery.

Title: Noise-Aware Optimization in Nominally Identical Manufacturing and Measuring Systems for High-Throughput Parallel Workflows
Authors: Christina Schenk, Miguel Hernández-del-Valle, Luis Calero-Lumbreras, Marcus Noack, Maciej Haranczyk
Abstract: Device-to-device variability in experimental noise critically impacts reproducibility, especially in automated, high-throughput systems like additive manufacturing farms. While manageable in small labs, such variability can escalate into serious risks at larger scales, such as architectural 3D printing, where noise may cause structural or economic failures. This contribution presents a noise-aware decision-making algorithm that quantifies and models device-specific noise profiles to manage variability adaptively. It uses distributional analysis and pairwise divergence metrics with clustering to choose between single-device and robust multi-device Bayesian optimization strategies. Unlike conventional methods that assume homogeneous devices or generic robustness, this framework explicitly leverages inter-device differences to enhance performance, reproducibility, and efficiency. An experimental case study involving three nominally identical 3D printers (same brand, model, and close serial numbers) demonstrates reduced redundancy, lower resource usage, and improved reliability. Overall, this framework establishes a paradigm for precision- and resource-aware optimization in scalable, automated experimental platforms.

Title: 2025 Quantum Diamond Workshop Findings Report
Authors: Danielle A. Braje, Matthew L. Markham, Jennifer M. Schloss, Michael A. Slocum, Ronald L. Walsworth
Abstract: This report synthesizes the outcomes of a two-day workshop held in Washington, D.C. in May, 2025 that convened researchers, industry representatives, and government stakeholders to examine the current state and future directions of quantum diamond technologies. The workshop's goals were to assess the most promising use cases, to identify the key technical and structural challenges limiting adoption, and to chart potential pathways for aligning application needs with diamond material and device development. Through a series of technical presentations and open discussions, participants explored both near-term demonstrations and long-term infrastructure needs, highlighting the critical role of coordination between material suppliers, device engineers, and end users. The goal of this report is to distill those insights into a coherent set of cross-cutting themes, challenges, and strategic actions that can guide government, industry, and academic efforts to accelerate the maturation and commercialization of quantum diamond technologies.

Title: Martini Mapper: An Automated Fragment-Based Framework for Developing Coarse-Grained Models within the Martini 3 Framework
Authors: Kevin V. Bigting, Shubhadeep Nag, Yaxin An
Abstract: Coarse-graining (CG) reduces molecular details to extend the time and length scales of molecular dynamics simulations to microseconds and micrometers. However, the CG approaches have long been limited by the difficulty of constructing both accurate and transferable models efficiently, considering the large diversity of chemical structures of materials. Among CG force fields, Martini is the most widely used, as it retains essential chemical features while offering substantial computational efficiency. Its most recent version, Martini 3, expands chemical resolution through a much broader bead set, particularly for small molecules. Still, this flexibility also complicates the mapping of organic molecules because of context-dependent rules and the lack of standardized procedures. To address this issue, we present an automated framework that builds Martini 3 models directly from SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) strings by combining a curated bead dictionary with a hierarchical, rule-based algorithm. Our framework generated Martini 3 models for more than 5,000 molecules across four chemically diverse datasets. A curated subset of 1,081 mapped structures was benchmarked through octanol-water free-energy ($\Delta G_{OW}$) and partition-coefficient ($\log P$) calculations, yielding strong agreement with experimental values. The workflow can also map large molecules containing up to 126 heavy atoms, exceeding the capabilities of existing automated approaches. The algorithm and the complete set of more than 5,000 mapped itp/top files are available at the \href{this https URL}{Martini Mapper}. Our framework, therefore, enables systematic and scalable Martini 3 structures for high-throughput simulations relevant to drug discovery and materials design.

Title: Compact cavity-dressed Hamiltonian framework at arbitrarily strong light-matter coupling
Authors: Jakub Garwoła, Dvira Segal
Abstract: We present a non-perturbative Hamiltonian mapping method for quantum systems strongly coupled to a quantized field mode (cavity), yielding compact closed-form representations of hybrid light-matter systems. The mapping method builds on an entangling transformation of photonic and atomic degrees of freedom. By truncating the resulting cavity-dressed Hamiltonian (CDH) to successively larger excitation sectors, we construct a series of compact models that converge to the exact limit, outpacing conventional approaches even in the challenging resonant and ultrastrong light-matter regime. The mapping principle also applies to multimode cavities coupled to matter through noncommuting operators and to leaky cavities. We benchmark the CDH framework on the quantum Rabi model, demonstrating accurate spectral predictions in both weak and strong coupling regimes, together with converging ground-state and thermal observables. We study the Dicke-Heisenberg lattice model and determine its phase diagram under resonant and strong light-matter coupling, achieving significant computational savings over brute-force simulations and identifying cavity-mediated spin correlations both analytically and numerically. The closed-form and compactness of the CDH provide both physical insight and enhanced computational efficiency, facilitating studies of strongly coupled hybrid light-matter systems.

Title: PCA recovery thresholds in low-rank matrix inference with sparse noise
Authors: Urte Adomaityte, Gabriele Sicuro, Pierpaolo Vivo
Abstract: We study the high-dimensional inference of a rank-one signal corrupted by sparse noise. The noise is modelled as the adjacency matrix of a weighted undirected graph with finite average connectivity in the large size limit. Using the replica method from statistical physics, we analytically compute the typical value of the top eigenvalue, the top eigenvector component density, and the overlap between the signal vector and the top eigenvector. The solution is given in terms of recursive distributional equations for auxiliary probability density functions which can be efficiently solved using a population dynamics algorithm. Specialising the noise matrix to Poissonian and Random Regular degree distributions, the critical signal strength is analytically identified at which a transition happens for the recovery of the signal via the top eigenvector, thus generalising the celebrated BBP transition to the sparse noise case. In the large-connectivity limit, known results for dense noise are recovered. Analytical results are in agreement with numerical diagonalisation of large matrices.

Title: Measurement-Based Quantum Computation Using the Spin-1 XXZ Model with Uniaxial Anisotropy
Authors: Hiroki Ohta, Aaron Merlin Müller, Shunji Tsuchiya
Abstract: We demonstrate that the ground state of a spin-1 XXZ chain with uniaxial anisotropies, single-ion anisotropy $D$ and Ising anisotropy $J$, within the Haldane phase can serve as a resource state for measurement-based quantum computation implementing single-qubit gates. The gate fidelity of both elementary rotation gates and general single-qubit unitary gates composed of rotations about the $x$-, $y$-, and $z$-axes is evaluated, and is found to exceed 0.99 when $D$ or $J$ is appropriately tuned. Furthermore, we derive an analytic expression for the rotation-gate fidelity under the assumption that the state lies within the $\mathbb Z_2\times\mathbb Z_2$-protected Haldane phase, showing that it is determined by the post-measurement spin-spin correlation function and the failure probability. The observed enhancement of gate fidelity in the spin-1 XXZ chain originates from the strengthening of antiferromagnetic (AFM) correlations near the AFM phase, which effectively suppresses failure states.

Title: Preference Learning from Physics-Based Feedback: Tuning Language Models to Design BCC/B2 Superalloys
Authors: Satanu Ghosh, Collin Holgate, Neal R. Brodnik, Doug Downey, Samantha Daly, Tresa M. Pollock, Samuel Carton
Abstract: We apply preference learning to the task of language model-guided design of novel structural alloys. In contrast to prior work that focuses on generating stable inorganic crystals, our approach targets the synthesizeability of a specific structural class: BCC/B2 superalloys, an underexplored family of materials with potential applications in extreme environments. Using three open-weight models (LLaMA-3.1, Gemma-2, and OLMo-2), we demonstrate that language models can be optimized for multiple design objectives using a single, unified reward signal through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Unlike prior approaches that rely on heuristic or human-in-the-loop feedback (costly), our reward signal is derived from thermodynamic phase calculations, offering a scientifically grounded criterion for model tuning. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of preference-tuning a language model using physics-grounded feedback for structural alloy design. The resulting framework is general and extensible, providing a path forward for intelligent design-space exploration across a range of physical science domains.

Title: Survival of Hermitian Criticality in the Non-Hermitian Framework
Authors: Fei Wang, Guoying Liang, Zecheng Zhao, Lin-Yue Luo, Da-Jian Zhang, Bao-Ming Xu
Abstract: In this work, we investigate many-body phase transitions in a one-dimensional anisotropic XY model subject to a complex-valued transverse field. Within the biorthogonal framework, we calculate the ground-state correlation functions and entanglement entropy, confirming that their scaling behavior remains identical to that in the Hermitian XY model. The preservation of Hermitian phase transition features in the non-Hermitian setting is rooted in the persistence and emergence of symmetries and their breaking. Specifically, the ferromagnetic (FM) phase arises from the breaking of a $Z_2$ symmetry, while the Luttinger liquid (LL) phase is enabled by the emergence of a $U(1)$ symmetry together with the degeneracy of the real part of the energy spectrum. The nontrivial topology of the LL phase are characterized by the winding number around the exceptional point (EP). Given that non-Hermitian systems are inherently open, this research opens a new avenue for exploring conventional quantum phase transitions that are typically vulnerable to decoherence and environmental disruption in open quantum systems.

Title: Skyrmionic qubits stabilized by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction as platforms for qubits and quantum gates
Authors: Doru Sticlet, Romulus Tetean, Coriolan Tiusan
Abstract: Quantum computation departs from the classical paradigm of deterministic, bit-based processing by exploiting inherently quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement. We propose a framework for qubit realization based on skyrmionic states stabilized by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in two-dimensional spin lattices. The model incorporates competing exchange interactions, perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, and Zeeman coupling, solved via exact diagonalization under periodic (PBC) and open boundary conditions (OBC). A quantum skyrmionic phase emerges for PBC within a parameter space defined by DMI, exchange, field, and anisotropy, while OBC favor classical-like, topologically protected skyrmions. Quantum logic gates (Pauli X, Y, Z, Hadamard) are implemented on both skyrmion types. Energy density and entanglement entropy analyses reveal that quantum skyrmions suffer from DMI-driven decoherence and reduced gate fidelity, whereas classical-like skyrmions maintain stability. Exact simulations of qubit dynamics, including drive effects and Lindblad decoherence, demonstrate tunable anharmonic energy levels and coherent Bloch-sphere manipulation, making these skyrmionic states promising candidates for qubit implementation. Overall, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction plays a dual role-stabilizing skyrmionic qubits while simultaneously inducing decoherence during gate operations.

Title: Direct Photochemical Patterning of Lithium Niobate Thin Films for Scalable Nonlinear Optical Metasurfaces
Authors: Rana Faryad Ali, Guillermo Aguilar
Abstract: Lithium niobate is one of the most sought-after materials for nanophotonic devices, including frequency converters, modulators, and quantum light sources. Integration of lithium niobate into optical devices, however, is hampered by significant top-down fabrication challenges due to its exceptional chemical resistance. Scalable fabrication methods that preserve material quality while reducing fabrication complexity and cost are, therefore, crucial to advancing lithium niobate devices. We present a photochemical metal-organic decomposition technique for the scalable patterning of lithium niobate at ambient conditions, eliminating the need for harsh etching conditions and cleanroom protocols. The method utilizes a solution of a custom-prepared photosensitive organometallic precursor as a negative photoresist. The UV light exposure of the thin films of the precursor through a photomask, followed by rinsing with ethanol, yields amorphous patterns, which transform into crystalline lithium niobate after a calcination step. This method enables a scalable fabrication of a range of complex geometric shapes with a feature resolution down to $30\,\mu\mathrm{m}$. The patterned lithium niobate structures exhibit a tunable second harmonic generation activity with an isotropic optical response. This approach offers a scalable and low-cost pathway for manufacturing lithium niobate photonics and the potential to fabricate other materials (e.g., barium titanite and lithium tantalate).

Title: Universalities in the Avalanche Dynamics of Novelties and Non-Novelties
Authors: Filippo Santoro, Alberto Petri, Francesca Tria
Abstract: Unprecedented events intertwine with the repetition of the past in natural phenomena and human activities. Key statistical patterns, such as Heaps' and Taylor's laws and Zipf's law, have been identified as characterizing the dynamical processes that govern the emergence of novelties and the abundance of repeated elements. Observing these statistical regularities has been pivotal in motivating the search for modeling schemes that can explain them and clarify key mechanisms underlying the appearance of new elements and their subsequent recurrence. In this study, we analyze sequences of novel and non-novel elements, referred to as avalanches, in real-world systems. We show that avalanche statistics provide a complementary characterization of innovation dynamics, extending beyond the three fundamental laws mentioned above. Although arising from collective dynamics, some systems behave as a single instance of a stochastic process. Others, such as natural language, exhibit features that we can only explain by a superposition of different dynamics. This distinction is not apparent when considering Heaps' law alone, while it clearly emerges in the avalanche statistics. By interpreting these empirical observations, we also advance the theoretical understanding of urn-based models that successfully reproduce the observed behaviors associated with Heaps', Zipf's, and Taylor's laws. We derive analytical expressions that accurately describe the probability distributions of avalanches and the Heaps law beyond its asymptotic regime. Building on these results, we derive a scaling relation that we show also holds in real-world systems, indicating a form of universality in the dynamics of novelty.

Title: Dissipative Dynamics of Charged Graphene Quantum Batteries
Authors: Disha Verma, Indrajith VS, R. Sankaranarayanan
Abstract: We investigate dissipative dynamics in a graphene-based quantum battery modeled as a four level spin valley system. The battery is charged via a Gaussian pulse and subsequently evolves under amplitude damping, dephasing, and both Markovian and non Markovian reservoirs. We find that amplitude damping, while inducing energy loss, can stabilize non passive steady states with finite ergotropy, whereas pure dephasing suppresses coherence and eliminates work extraction. On the other hand, non-Markovian memory slows ergotropy loss and enables partial recovery through information backflow. These results identify coherence and reservoir memory as essential resources for enhancing the long-time performance of graphene quantum batteries.

Title: Moments of quantum channel ensembles
Authors: Matthew Duschenes, Diego García-Martín, Zoë Holmes, M. Cerezo
Abstract: Moments of ensembles of unitaries play a central role in quantum information theory as they capture the statistical properties of dynamics of systems with some form of randomness. Indeed, concepts such as approximate $t$-designs arise when comparing how close an associated moment operator of a given unitary ensemble is to that of another, reference ensemble. Despite the importance of moment operators, their properties have not been as explored for quantum channels. In this work we develop a theoretical framework to compute moment operators for ensembles of quantum channels, for all moment orders $t$, with a special focus on determining ensembles that can be used as points of reference. By deriving hierarchies between ensembles, via inequalities of their moment operator norms, we give them operational meaning, and define useful concepts such as that of channel $t$-designs. Finally, we perform theoretical and numerical studies which show that different types of noise can decrease the norm of the moment operators (e.g., depolarizing noise), as well as increase it (e.g., amplitude damping), and generalize noise-induced concentration phenomena to channel-design-induced phenomena. Along the way, we find a block-orthogonal basis for permutations, which greatly simplifies our analyses, and may be of independent interest.

Title: Orientations of Orbi-K-Theory measuring Topological Phases and Brane Charges
Authors: Hisham Sati, Urs Schreiber
Abstract: Topological Chern phases of quantum materials, as well as brane charges on M-theory orbifolds, have famously been argued to be classified by (orbi) topological K-theory, or possibly by other stable and, notably, complex-oriented cohomology theories, such as elliptic cohomology or Morava K-theory. However, closer inspection reveals that the most fine-grained "fragile" microscopic classification in both cases is in (orbi) Cohomotopy, which is the primordial "unstable" or nonabelian generalized cohomology. Coarsening takes the latter (fragile) to the former (stable) cohomology along an nonabelian cohomology operations. But what then is the role of complex orientation on the stable side? We observe here (i) that over gapped nodal lines in the 2D Brillouin torus and on probe M5-branes in 11D spacetime, the cohomotopical phases/charges lift through the complex/quaternionic Hopf fibration, and (ii) that measuring this fragile situation in stable cohomology means equivalently to ask for universal complex/quaternionic orientation on stable cohomology in four/ten dimensions! Then we give an explicit realization of such unstable four/ten-dimensional complex/quaternionic orientation in U(2)/Sp(2)-equivariant K-theory, using real division-algebraic tools within a new model of twisted orbifold K-theory in cohesive homotopy theory; and we explain this as an extraordinary character map from orbi Cohomotopy-twisted Cohomotopy to relative orbi K-theory. Finally, we discuss an application to the classification of 2-band crystalline topological insulator phases sensitive to the topology in the gapping process of their nodal line semimetal parent phase, and to the measurement of M-string charges inside M5-brane probes.

Title: DIVIDE: A Framework for Learning from Independent Multi-Mechanism Data Using Deep Encoders and Gaussian Processes
Authors: Vivek Chawla, Boris Slautin, Utkarsh Pratiush, Dayakar Penumadu, Sergei Kalinin
Abstract: Scientific datasets often arise from multiple independent mechanisms such as spatial, categorical or structural effects, whose combined influence obscures their individual contributions. We introduce DIVIDE, a framework that disentangles these influences by integrating mechanism-specific deep encoders with a structured Gaussian Process in a joint latent space. Disentanglement here refers to separating independently acting generative factors. The encoders isolate distinct mechanisms while the Gaussian Process captures their combined effect with calibrated uncertainty. The architecture supports structured priors, enabling interpretable and mechanism-aware prediction as well as efficient active learning. DIVIDE is demonstrated on synthetic datasets combining categorical image patches with nonlinear spatial fields, on FerroSIM spin lattice simulations of ferroelectric patterns, and on experimental PFM hysteresis loops from PbTiO3 films. Across benchmarks, DIVIDE separates mechanisms, reproduces additive and scaled interactions, and remains robust under noise. The framework extends naturally to multifunctional datasets where mechanical, electromagnetic or optical responses coexist.

Title: Opinion formation at Ising social networks
Authors: Kristina Bukina, Dima L. Shepelyansky
Abstract: We study the process of opinion formation in an Ising social network of scientific collaborations. The network is undirected. An Ising spin is associated with each network node being oriented up (red) or down (blue). Certain nodes carry fixed, opposite opinions whose influence propagates over the other spins, which are flipped according to the majority-influence opinion of neighbors of a given spin during the asynchronous Monte Carlo process. The amplitude influence of each spin is self-consistently adapted, and a flip occurs only if this majority influence exceeds a certain conviction threshold. All non-fixed spins are initially randomly distributed, with half of them oriented up and half down. Such a system can be viewed as a model of elite influence, coming from the fixed spins, on the opinions of the crowd of non-fixed spins. We show that a phase transition occurs as the amplitude influence of the crowd spins increases: the dominant opinion shifts from that of the elite nodes to a phase in which the crowd spins' opinion becomes dominant and the elite can no longer impose their views.

Title: A Global Spacetime Optimization Approach to the Real-Space Time-Dependent Schrödinger Equation
Authors: Enze Hou, Yuzhi Liu, Lei Wang, Han Wang
Abstract: The time-dependent Schrödinger equation (TDSE) in real space is fundamental to understanding the dynamics of many-electron quantum systems, with applications ranging from quantum chemistry to condensed matter physics and materials science. However, solving the TDSE for complex fermionic systems remains a significant challenge, particularly due to the need to capture the time-evolving many-body correlations, while the antisymmetric nature of fermionic wavefunctions complicates the function space in which these solutions must be represented. We propose a general-purpose neural network framework for solving the real-space TDSE, Fermionic Antisymmetric Spatio-Temporal Network, which treats time as an explicit input alongside spatial coordinates, enabling a unified spatiotemporal representation of complex, antisymmetric wavefunctions for fermionic systems. This approach formulates the TDSE as a global optimization problem, avoiding step-by-step propagation and supporting highly parallelizable training. The method is demonstrated on four benchmark problems: a 1D harmonic oscillator, interacting fermions in a time-dependent harmonic trap, 3D hydrogen orbital dynamics, and a laser-driven H$_2$ molecule, achieving excellent agreement with reference solutions across all cases. These results confirm our method's scalability, accuracy, and flexibility across various dimensions and interaction regimes, while demonstrating its ability to accurately simulate long-time dynamics in complex systems. Our framework offers a highly expressive alternative to traditional basis-dependent or mean-field methods, opening new possibilities for ab initio simulations of time-dependent quantum systems, with applications in quantum dynamics, molecular control, and ultrafast spectroscopy.

Title: Prospects for a Solid-State Nuclear Clock
Authors: Steven M. Girvin (Yale), Leo Radzihovsky (CU Boulder)
Abstract: Motivated by recent experimental breakthroughs toward a realization of a solid-state Thorium-229 nuclear clock, we review the technology, basic physics motivation, and limitations of the present generation of atomic clocks. We then discuss prospects for a new generation of clocks based on an anomalous low-energy 8.4 eV nuclear transition in Th-229, with an extremely long lifetime of 641 seconds when doped into CaF crystals. To realize such solid-state nuclear clocks one must confront basic nuclear, AMO, and solid state physics questions. Key challenges are understanding and minimizing the effects of inhomogeneous broadening, associated with strains and electric field gradients due to both the Th dopants and intrinsic crystal defects.

Title: Orthogonal Attosecond Control of Solid-State Harmonics by Optical Waveforms and Quantum Geometry Engineering
Authors: Zhenjiang Zhao, Zhihua Zheng, Zhiyi Xu, Xing Ran, Xiaolong Yao, Fangping Ouyang
Abstract: High-harmonic generation (HHG) in two-dimensional materials offers a compelling route toward compact extreme ultraviolet sources and probing electron dynamics on the attosecond scale. However, achieving precise control over the emission and disentangling the complex interplay between intraband and interband quantum pathways remains a central challenge. Here, we demonstrate through first-principles simulations that HHG in monolayer WS2 can be subjected to precise, complementary control by combining all-optical two-color laser fields with mechanical strain engineering. This dual-mode strategy provides unprecedented, orthogonal control over harmonic yield, polarization, and spectral features. We reveal that sculpting the two-color field's relative phase provides a sub-femtosecond switch for the quantum coherence of electron-hole pairs, thereby maximizing harmonic emission. Crucially, we uncover that tensile strain acts as a powerful amplifier through a dual mechanism - while strain-modified band dispersion enhances the intraband current, a profound reshaping of the Berry curvature (BC) dramatically boosts the anomalous velocity contribution to the interband response. This quantum geometric effect manifests as a robust, linear dependence of the harmonic yield on strain and a significant amplification of the perpendicularly polarized harmonics, providing a clear experimental signature for probing quantum geometric effects. Our findings establish a versatile framework for optimizing solid-state HHG and introduce a powerful all-optical method to map strain and quantum geometric properties of materials, positioning monolayer WS2 as a model system for exploring attosecond physics at the nexus of bulk and atomic scales.

Title: Multiphase transport and compositional mixing mechanisms in twin-wire laser directed energy deposition: toward process stability and graded material fabrication
Authors: Yi Li, Yuhui Li, Jianzhao Wu, Luxuan Zhang, Maoyuan Li, Chaochao Wu, Zhenzhong Wang
Abstract: Twin-wire laser directed energy deposition (TW-LDED) provides a promising route for alloying and fabrication of compositionally graded structures. However, inherent multiparameter coupling in twin-wire systems critically exacerbates both process instabilities and compositional inhomogeneity. This unresolved issue escalates into a fundamental technological bottleneck, as the underlying physical mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study developed a high-fidelity multi-physics and multiphase simulation framework coupled with experimental validation to reveal thermal-fluid behavior and heat-mass transfer mechanisms in TW-LDED using Inconel 718 and SS316L fine wires. Three distinct transition modes were identified: twin-wire melt droplet, twin-wire liquid bridge, and droplet-bridge mixed transitions, with the twin-wire liquid bridge regime delivering optimal stability and uniform mixing. Parametric analysis demonstrates that increasing wire feeding speed or decreasing wire initial height promotes stable liquid bridge formation, while small laser spots at low feeding speeds induce excessive volumetric energy density and bridge instability. Simulation and single-track experiments confirm that liquid bridge transitions reduce dimensional fluctuations by 85% while enhancing compositional homogeneity. Conversely, the melt droplet-bridge transition mode creates periodic flow switching and compositional discontinuities along the scan direction. Finally, a 60 mm functionally graded ring was successfully fabricated using optimized parameters, achieving uniform elemental distribution in the transition zone without significant segregation, validating the feasibility of TW-LDED for functionally graded components.

Title: Bilayer B80 Structure: High Stability and Experimental Support for Existence
Authors: Yi-Sha Chen, Jing-Jing Guo, Peng-Bo Liu, Hui-Yan Zhao, Jing Wang, Ying Liu
Abstract: The recent experimental characterization of B80- via photoelectron spectroscopy stimulated renewed interest in exploring B80 clusters. Here, a D3h-symmetric B80 bilayer structure has been proposed using density functional theory calculations. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations confirm that the bilayer structure maintain its structural integrity up to 1400 K, indicating superior thermodynamic stability compared to previously known B80 configurations, including the B80 buckyball and volleyball-like structures. Vibrational frequency analysis confirms its kinetic stability. Electronic structure calculations reveals a HOMO-LUMO gap of 0.72 eV and pronounced aromaticity, further supported by a nucleus-independent chemical shift (NICS(0)) value of -44.3 ppm in the interlayer B-B bonds. The simulated photoelectron spectrum of the B80- bilayer reproduces key experimental features, with vertical detachment energies agreeing with experimental peaks within 0.04 eV. These findings support the potential existence of this bilayer configuration, and enrich the structural diversity of boron clusters, offering promising prospects for applications in nanoscale electronics.

Title: Extreme polaritonic interactions in a room-temperature deterministic sub-nanocavity quantum electrodynamic platform
Authors: Huatian Hu, Xin Shu, Zhiwei Hu, Di Zheng, Wei Dai, Xiang Lan, Xiaobo Han, Wen Chen, Hongxing Xu
Abstract: Pushing nanoscale optical confinement to its ultimate limits defines the regime of nano-cavity quantum electrodynamics (nano-cQED), where light--matter interactions approach the fundamental quantum limits of individual atoms, e.g., picocavities. However, realizing such extreme confinement in a stable and controllable manner remains a key challenge. Here, we introduce a van der Waals material-based nano-cQED platform by coupling monolayer MoS2 excitons to plasmonic sub-nanocavities formed via assembly of ultrasmall gold clusters (3-5 nm) in the nanogap of a nanoparticle-on-mirror nanocavity. These clusters emulate the field-confining role of atomic protrusions of the picocavities through a resonance-insensitive lightning-rod effect, achieving deep-subwavelength mode volumes. In this nano-cQED testbed, we observe pronounced multi-branch Rabi splittings and ultrastrong lower-branch polaritonic photoluminescence with up to 10^4-fold enhancement. This deterministic architecture provides a controllable pathway to access picocavity-like behavior and opens new opportunities for single-molecule spectroscopy and the exploration of nano-cQED.

Title: Floquet Recurrences in the Double Kicked Top
Authors: Avadhut V. Purohit, Udaysinh T. Bhosale
Abstract: We study exact quantum recurrences in the double kicked top (DKT), a driven spin model that extends the quantum kicked top (QKT) by introducing an additional time-reversal symmetry-breaking kick. Reformulating its dynamics in terms of effective parameters $k_r$ and $k_\theta$, we analytically show exact periodicity of the Floquet operator for $k_r = j\pi/2$ and $k_r = j\pi/4$ with distinct periods for integer and half-odd integer $j$. These exact recurrences were found to be independent of $k_\theta$. The long-time-averaged entanglement and fidelity rate function show dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT) for $k_r = j\pi/2$ at time-reversal symmetric cases $k_\theta = \pm k_r$. In the other time-reversal symmetric case $k_\theta = 0$, the DQPT exists only for a half-odd integer $j$. Using level statistics, a smooth transition is observed from integrable to non-integrable nature as $k_r$ is changed away from $j\pi/2$. Our work demonstrates that regular and chaotic regimes can be controlled for any system size by tuning $k_r$ and $k_\theta$, making the DKT a useful platform for quantum control and information processing applications.

Title: Projection-based DMRG-in-DFT embedding corrected by non-additive exchange-correlation
Authors: Enzo Monino, Daria Drwal, Pavel Beran, Michał Hapka, Libor Veis, Katarzyna Pernal
Abstract: The projection-based wave function (WF)-in-DFT embedding enables an efficient description of both the energetics and properties of large and complex chemical systems, with accuracy exceeding that of pure DFT. Recently, we have proposed using the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) as the WF method for molecules containing strongly correlated fragments [Beran, P. et al. J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2023, 14, 3, 716-722]. In this work, we demonstrate that the accuracy of the DMRG-in-DFT approach is primarily limited by the approximate treatment of the coupling between the active component and its environment through nonadditive exchange-correlation functionals. To address this issue, we combine exact exchange to reduce the nonadditive exchange error with a multireference adiabatic connection (AC) scheme to recover nonadditive correlation. The performance of the improved DMRG-in-DFT embedding is illustrated on two prototypical strongly correlated systems: the dissociation of the H20 chain and the cleavage of a triple CN bond in propionitrile.

Furthermore, closed-form solutions for the free-fields developing in this sheet for propagating shear waves are also obtained. The analysis presented here provides a foundation for understanding quasicrystal dynamic behavior and for advancing relevant computational methods.

Title: Spontaneous emergence of solitary waves in active flow networks
Authors: Rodrigo Fernández-Quevedo García, Gonçalo Cruz Antunes, Jens Harting, Holger Stark, Chantal Valeriani, Martin Brandenbourger, Juan José Mazo, Paolo Malgaretti, Miguel Ruiz-García
Abstract: Flow networks are fundamental for understanding systems such as animal and plant vasculature or power distribution grids. These networks can encode, transmit, and transform information embodied in the spatial and temporal distribution of their flows. In this work, we focus on a minimal yet physically grounded system that allows us to isolate the fundamental mechanisms by which active flow networks generate and regulate emergent dynamics capable of supporting information transmission. The system is composed of active units that pump fluid and elastic units that store volume. From first principles, we derive a discrete model-an active flow network-that enables the simulation of large systems with many interacting units. Numerically, we show that the pressure field can develop solitary waves, resulting in the spontaneous creation and transmission of localized packets of information stored in the physical properties of the flow. We characterize how these solitary waves emerge from disordered initial conditions in a one-dimensional network, and how their size and propagation speed depend on key system parameters. Finally, when the elastic units are coupled to their neighbors, the solitary waves exhibit even richer dynamics, with diverse shapes and finite lifetimes that display power-law behaviors that we can predict analytically. Together, these results show how simple fluidic elements can collectively create, shape and transport information, laying the foundations for understanding-and ultimately engineering-information processing in active flow systems.

Title: Thermodynamics of the Fermi-Hubbard Model through Stochastic Calculus and Girsanov Transformation
Authors: Detlef Lehmann
Abstract: We apply the methodology of our recent paper 'The Dynamics of the Hubbard Model through Stochastic Calculus and Girsanov Transformation' [1] to thermodynamic correlation functions in the Fermi-Hubbard model. They can be obtained from a stochastic differential equation (SDE) system. To this SDE system, a Girsanov transformation can be applied. This has the effect that the usual determinant or pfaffian which shows up in a pfaffian quantum Monte Carlo (PfQMC) representation [2] basically gets absorbed into the new integration variables and information from that pfaffian moves into the drift part of the transformed SDE system. While the PfQMC representation depends heavily on the choice of how the quartic interaction has been factorized into quadratic quantities in the beginning, the Girsanov transformed formula has the very remarkable property that it is nearly independent of that choice, the drift part of the transformed SDE system as well as a remaining exponential which has the obvious meaning of energy are always the same and do not depend on the Hubbard-Stratonovich details. The resulting formula may serve as a starting point for further theoretical or numerical investigations. Here we consider the spin-spin correlation at half-filling on a bipartite lattice and obtain an analytical proof that the signs of these correlations have to be of antiferromagnetic type, at arbitrary temperatures. Also, by checking against available benchmark data [3], we find that approximate ground state energies can be obtained from an ODE system. This may even hold for exact ground state energies, but future work would be required to prove or disprove this. As in [1], the methodology is generic and can be applied to arbitrary quantum many body or quantum field theoretical models.

Title: Generalized Global Symmetries of $T[M]$ Theories: Part II
Authors: Sergei Gukov, Po-Shen Hsin, Du Pei
Abstract: We continue the investigation of symmetries and anomalies of $T[M]$ theories obtained by compactifying 6d SCFTs on an internal manifold $M$. We extend the notion of "polarizations on a manifold $M$" to cases where $M$ may have boundaries or defects. Through examples with $M$ of dimension two, three, and four, we illustrate recurring themes in compactifications -- for instance, the important roles played by Kaluza-Klein modes, and how the generalized symmetries (including higher-group and non-invertible ones) of $T[M]$, together with their anomalies, arise from non-trivial combinations of the parent 6d symmetries and the geometric structures of the internal manifold. For each dimension, we also focus on several topics that are especially interesting in that setting. These include: for 2-manifolds, the geometry of the "full moduli space" of $T[M_2]$ and its interaction with polarizations and symmetries; for 3-manifolds, the effect of torsion in homology on the spectrum of line operators in $T[M_3]$, together with applications to the study of quantum invariants such as $\hat Z_a(M_3, q)$; and for 4-manifolds, predictions for VOA$[M_4]$ following from symmetries of $T[M_4]$, as well as the construction of a new invariant of 4-manifolds that depends on two "$q$-parameters." Along the way, we discuss a range of topics that are of independent interest, such as how non-invertible symmetries in higher dimensions can become invertible under compactification, how to classify defects in quantum field theory via their response to a change of framing, and the interplay between $\hat Z_a$ and volume conjectures.

Title: In-Situ Growth of Halide Perovskite Single Crystals and Thin Films on Optical Fiber End Facets
Authors: Yang Yu, Kanak Kanti Bhowmik, Ruan Li, Kexin Li, Lin Zhu, Hai Xiao, Lianfeng Zhao
Abstract: Halide perovskites exhibit significant advantages for active optical components such as light emitting diodes, solar cells and photodetectors due to their excellent optoelectronic properties. Their nonlinear optical effects and other characteristics also make them suitable for integration into waveguide components, such as optical fibers, for applications like optical modulation. Although some efforts have been made to integrate perovskite nanomaterials with optical fibers, technological challenges have hindered reliable in-situ preparation methods. Herein, we propose an area-selective wetting strategy for optical fibers, which utilizes hydrophobic sidewalls and hydrophilic end facets to reliably hold small precursor droplets. By introducing a space confinement strategy to suppress the kinetics of solvent evaporation, Methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr3) perovskite single crystals were successfully grown in-situ on the fiber end facet. The versatility of this in-situ growth method for single crystals on fiber end facets of various sizes has also been verified. In a separate approach, the controllable in-situ preparation of CsPbBr3 polycrystalline thin films was achieved through vacuum-assisted rapid crystallization. Our strategy provides a controllable platform for the integration of perovskite materials and optical fibers, enabling further development in optical applications.

Title: Bosonisation Cohomology: Spin Structure Summation in Every Dimension
Authors: Philip Boyle Smith, Joe Davighi
Abstract: Gauging fermion parity and summing over spin structures are subtly distinct operations. We introduce 'bosonisation cohomology' groups $H_B^{d+2}(X)$ to capture this difference, for theories in spacetime dimension $d$ equipped with maps to some $X$. Non-trivial classes in $H_B^{d+2}(X)$ contain theories for which $(-1)^F$ is anomaly-free, but spin structure summation is anomalous. We formulate a sequence of cobordism groups whose failure to be exact is measured by $H_B^{d+2}(X)$, and from here we compute it for $X=\text{pt}$. The result is non-trivial only in dimensions $d\in 4\mathbb{Z}+2$, being due to the presence of gravitational anomalies. The first few are $H_B^4=\mathbb{Z}_2$, probed by a theory of 8 Majorana-Weyl fermions in $d=2$, then $H_B^8=\mathbb{Z}_8$, $H_B^{12}=\mathbb{Z}_{16}\times \mathbb{Z}_2$. We rigorously derive a general formula extending this to every spacetime dimension. Along the way, we compile many general facts about (fermionic and bosonic) anomaly polynomials, and about spin and pin$^-$ (co)bordism generators, that we hope might serve as a useful reference for physicists working with these objects. We briefly discuss some physics applications, including how the $H_B^{12}$ class is trivialised in supergravity. Despite the name, and notation, we make no claim that $H_B^\bullet(X)$ actually defines a cohomology theory (in the Eilenberg-Steenrod sense).

Title: Impact of Exchange-Correlation Functionals on Predictions of Phonon Hydrodynamics: A Study of Fluorides, Chlorides, and Hydrides
Authors: Jamal Abou Haibeh, Samuel Huberman
Abstract: We employ density functional theory calculations to examine the effect of various exchange-correlation (XC) functionals, including the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation (PBE), the modified Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation (PBESOL), and the local density approximation (LDA), on the electrical, mechanical, and thermal properties of sodium fluoride (NaF), lithium fluoride (LiF), potassium fluoride (KF), sodium chloride (NaCl), potassium chloride (KCl), lithium hydride (LiH), sodium hydride (NaH), and potassium hydride (KH). The lattice thermal conductivity is computed based on an iterative solution of the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE). Based on Guyer's criterion and direct solutions to the linearized BTE, we determine the ballistic, phonon hydrodynamics and diffusive regimes as function of length scale and temperature. In addition to confirming previous predictions of phonon hydrodynamics in NaF and LiF, we report novel predictions of phonon hydrodynamics in NaH, LiH, KH, KF, NaCl and KCl. The impact of isotopes on the calculated lattice thermal conductivity and phonon hydrodynamics windows is also reported. The impact of Meta-GGA and hybrid functionals is also discussed. We find that the selection of a functional impacts the prediction of thermal conductivity and the window for observation of phonon hydrodynamics.

Title: Broad-band ellipsometry study of the anisotropic dielectric response of YAlO3
Authors: Laurent Bugnon, Christian Bernhard, Premysl Marsik
Abstract: We present a broad band (THz to UV) ellipsometry study of the anisotropic dielectric response of the orthorhombic perovskite YAlO3. The ellipsometric measurements have been performed on YAlO3 crystals with three different surface cuts and for six high symmetry configurations of the crystal axes with respect to the plane of incidence of the photons. The obtained data are presented in terms of the Mueller Matrix elements N, C, and S and their features are analyzed and discussed with respect to the anisotropy of the dielectric response tensor. In particular, in the infrared range we have identified all 25 infrared active phonon modes that have been predicted from theoretical studies. We also discuss a negative refraction effect that naturally occurs in the vicinity of an anisotropic longitudinal-optical phonon. Moreover, we have determined the temperature dependence of the phonon parameters between 10 and 330 K. The dielectric response above the phonon range, from about 0.1 to 6.5 eV, is shown to be featureless and characteristic of an insulator with a large band gap above 6.5 eV and is well described by anisotropic Cauchy model.

Title: Dirac Electrons in AC-Magnetic Fields: $π$-Landau Levels and Chiral Anomaly-Induced Homodyne Effect
Authors: Sota Kitamura, Takashi Oka
Abstract: Floquet engineering, which involves controlling systems through time-periodic driving, is a method for coherently manipulating quantum materials and realizing dynamical states with novel functionalities. Most research in solid-state systems has focused on the use of AC-electric fields as the controlling drive. In this study, we investigate the effects of AC-magnetic fields on two-dimensional (2D) Dirac electrons and report the emergence of new states and new transport phenomena. In a magnetic field that temporarily changes its direction, the 2D Dirac electrons form a new localized state with a flat band dispersion, dubbed as a $\pi$-Landau level. Its wave function is a superposition of the clockwise and counterclockwise cyclotron orbits with time-periodic amplitudes, resulting in a novel closed trajectory shaped like a figure eight. Then, what would be the counterpart of the Hall effect in AC-magnetic fields? We find that a DC-current in the transverse direction, i.e. a homodyne Hall current, is generated when an additional AC-electric field is applied. In the case of Dirac electrons, several electronic states contribute to this phenomenon including the $\pi$-Landau level. However, when the chemical potential $\mu$ is near the Dirac point, the dominant contribution comes from the low-energy electrons and we numerically find the homodyne Hall current to behave as $I_y=-\frac{e}{h}\mu$ per valley and spin. We explain this phenomenon through the high-frequency effective Floquet Hamiltonian which resembles the chiral Landau level Hamiltonian of three-dimensional Weyl Hamiltonian exhibiting chiral anomaly. We discuss the experimental feasibility and conclude that it is possible to realize this new exotic state using techniques such as THz metamaterial enhancement of magnetic fields.

Title: Structural Relaxation in Simple Yield Stress Materials Influences Their Rheology
Authors: Kasra Farain, Daniel Bonn
Abstract: Simple yield stress materials are composed of soft particles, bubbles, or droplets with purely repulsive forces. The constituent elements are typically too large to undergo thermal fluctuations, suggesting that the internal structure of the material, and therefore the rheology, should not change over time. We explore the rheology of Carbopol, a prototypical simple yield stress material, and show that gradual structural relaxation of the material results in a small yet significant reduction in the dynamic yield stress. This relaxation process can lead to a non-monotonic creep deformation rate under constant stress, culminating in delayed fluidization of the material. These findings show that the yield stress is not merely a static material property but may be a function of the internal structure of the material.

Title: Quantum phase diagrams of Dicke-Ising models by a wormhole algorithm
Authors: Anja Langheld, Max Hörmann, Kai Phillip Schmidt
Abstract: We gain quantitative insights on effects of light-matter interactions on correlated quantum matter by quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We introduce a wormhole algorithm for the paradigmatic Dicke-Ising model which combines the light-matter interaction of the Dicke model with Ising interactions. The quantum phase diagram for ferro- and antiferromagnetic interactions on the chain and the square lattice is determined. The occurring superradiant phase transitions are in the same universality class as the Dicke model leading to a well-known peculiar finite-size scaling that we elucidate in terms of scaling above the upper critical dimension. For the ferromagnetic case, the transition between the normal and the superradiant phase is of second order with Dicke criticality (first order) for large (small) longitudinal fields separated by a multicritical point. For antiferromagnetic interactions, we establish the light-matter analogue of a lattice supersolid with off-diagonal superradiant and diagonal magnetic order and determine the nature of all transition lines.

Title: Making s-wave superconductors topological with magnetic field
Authors: Daniil S. Antonenko, Liang Fu, Leonid. I Glazman
Abstract: We show that a two-dimensional $s$-wave superconductor may become topological in the presence of a magnetic field that leads to the formation of an Abrikosov vortex lattice. Below the upper critical field, a superconducting state with a nontrivial even topological number emerges, which we call the Abrikosov-Chern superconducting state. Deeper in the superconducting domain, the topological number changes in steps, always remaining even and thus not supporting Majorana states, and eventually reaches zero. Our theory uncovers the nature of evolution from an integer quantum Hall state having a cyclotron gap above the upper critical field to the topologically trivial $s$-wave superconductor carrying finite-energy Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon levels at low field. Topological transitions manifest as changes in the number of edge modes, detectable through tunneling spectroscopy and thermal or spin transport measurements.

Title: Chemotaxis-induced phase separation
Authors: Henrik Weyer, David Muramatsu, Erwin Frey
Abstract: Chemotaxis allows single cells to self-organize at the population level, as classically described by Keller-Segel models. We show that chemotactic aggregation can be understood using a generalized Maxwell construction based on the balance of density fluxes and reactive turnover. This formulation implies that aggregates generically undergo coarsening, which is interrupted and reversed by cell growth and death. Together, both stable and spatiotemporally dynamic aggregates emerge. Our theory mechanistically links chemotactic self-organization to phase separation and reaction-diffusion patterns.

Title: Coarsening dynamics of chemotactic aggregates
Authors: Henrik Weyer, David Muramatsu, Erwin Frey
Abstract: Auto-chemotaxis, the directed movement of cells along gradients in chemicals they secrete, is central to the formation of complex spatiotemporal patterns in biological systems. Since the introduction of the Keller--Segel model, numerous variants have been analyzed, revealing phenomena such as coarsening of aggregates, stable aggregate sizes, and spatiotemporally chaotic dynamics. Here, we consider general mass-conserving Keller--Segel models, that is, models without cell growth and death, and analyze the generic long-time dynamics of the chemotactic aggregates. Building on and extending our previous work, which demonstrated that chemotactic aggregation can be understood through a generalized Maxwell construction balancing density fluxes and reactive turnover, we use singular perturbation theory to derive the rates of mass competition between well-separated aggregates. We analyze how this mass-competition process drives coarsening in both diffusion- and reaction-limited regimes, with the diffusion-limited rate aligning with our previous quasi-steady-state analyses. Our results generalize earlier mathematical findings, demonstrating that coarsening is driven by self-amplifying mass transport and aggregate coalescence. Additionally, we provide a linear stability analysis of the lateral instability, predicting it through a nullcline-slope criterion that parallels the curvature criterion in spinodal decomposition. Overall, our findings suggest that chemotactic aggregates behave similarly to phase-separating droplets, providing a robust framework for understanding the coarse-grained dynamics of auto-chemotactic cell populations and a quantitative basis for comparing chemotactic coarsening to canonical non-equilibrium phase separation.

Title: Determination of Magnetic Symmetries by Convergent Beam Electron Diffraction
Authors: O. Zaiets, C. Timm, J. Rusz, J.-Á. Castellanos-Reyes, S. Subakti, A. Lubk
Abstract: Convergent-beam electron diffraction (CBED) is a well-established probe for spatial symmetries of crystalline samples, mainly exploiting the well-defined mapping between the diffraction groups (symmetry group of CBED patterns) and the point-group symmetries of the crystalline sample. In this work, we extend CBED to determine magnetic point groups. We construct all magnetic CBED groups, of which there exist 125. Then, we provide the complete mapping of the 122 magnetic point groups to corresponding magnetic CBED groups for all crystal orientations. In order to verify the group-theoretical considerations, we conduct electron-scattering simulations on antiferromagnetic crystals and provide guidelines for the experimental realization. Based on its feasibility using existing technology, as well as on its accuracy, high spatial resolution, and small required sample size, magnetic CBED promises to be become a valuable alternative method for magnetic structure determination.

Title: Rectification from band gap oscillation
Authors: Anwesha Chattopadhyay
Abstract: We study a one-dimensional chain of identical atoms with two electronic orbitals and two electrons per atom, subject to an external oscillating pressure that periodically modulates the lattice spacing. This leads to time-dependent intra- and inter-orbital hopping amplitudes. In the tight-binding limit with weak inter-orbital hopping, the system exhibits two electronic bands separated by an oscillating indirect band-gap. By tuning hopping amplitudes and orbital energies, a periodic metal-insulator transition emerges in the half-filled system. When the frequency of this transition matches that of an external alternating electric field, the system undergoes half-wave rectification: it behaves as a conductor during one half-cycle and as an insulator during the other. This dynamic switching enables directional current flow and remains robust under small to intermediate onsite electron-electron interactions.

Title: Ferromagnetic fragmented state in the pyrochlore Ho$_2$Ru$_2$O$_7$
Authors: F. Museur, J. Robert, F. Morineau, N. Bujault, V. Simonet, E. Pachoud, A. Hadj-Azzem, C. Colin, L. Mangin-Thro, P. Manuel, J. R. Stewart, P. C. W. Holdsworth, E. Lhotel
Abstract: The consecutive magnetic ordering of the Ho and Ru ions in the pyrochlore Ho2Ru2O7 and their interplay are investigated by neutron scattering, magnetic and specific heat measurements. The Ru moments order at 95 K into a $\Gamma_5$ easy-plane antiferromagnetic state. At 1.55 K the Ho moments order into an unusual $\Gamma_9$ ferromagnetic state with extensive ground state entropy and structured spin dynamics. It is shown how the internal fields with $\Gamma_5$ and $\Gamma_9$ geometry allow for two symmetry breaking transitions. The lower temperature ordering is driven by ruthenium mediated interactions between holmium moments as spin ice correlations develop. The unsaturated order is compatible with a fragmented ferromagnetic state equivalent to pyrochlore kagome ice.

Title: First-principles-inspired thermodynamic framework linking the condensed ground state to displacive ferroelectric phase transitions
Authors: F. Yang, L. Q. Chen
Abstract: Quantitative description of finite-temperature properties of displacive ferroelectrics, and in particular the critical behavior, is of fundamental importance to both theory and device design, going beyond the Landau-Ginzburg approach, which requires known knowledge of critical behaviors and temperature-dependent parameter fitting. Here within quantum statistic description of quasiparticles, we develop a self-consistent, microscopically based phase-transition framework, by treating the bosonic condensation of the unstable phonons and the emerging collective vectorial polar mode. It enables one to use only the ground-state properties to predict the finite-temperature properties and in particular, the criticality of phase transitions of various displacive ferroelectrics. Its applications to the classical ferroelectric PbTiO$_3$, quantum paraelectrics SrTiO$_3$ and KTaO$_3$, and recently fabricated ferroelectric strained SrTiO$_3$, demonstrate remarkable quantitative agreements with the experimentally measured dielectric/ferroelectric properties throughout the entire temperature ranges of the phases, including the critical behaviors of phase transitions. The framework offers a tractable and parameter-free quantitative basis for understanding and predicting phase transitions in a broad range of ferroelectric systems under diverse thermodynamic and external conditions, bridging microscopic modeling and device-level design.

Title: Unsupervised Classification of Non-Hermitian Topological Phases under Symmetries
Authors: Yang Long, Haoran Xue, Baile Zhang
Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into fundamental science has opened new possibilities to address long-standing scientific challenges rooted in mathematical limitations. For example, topological invariants are used to characterize topology, but there is no universally applicable one. This limitation explains why, in the past decades-long classification of topological phases of matter -- mainly focused on Hermitian systems -- many phases initially classified ``trivial" were later identified as topological. Recently, the discovery of non-Hermitian band topology has spurred substantial efforts in non-Hermitian topological classification, including the development of new topological invariants. However, such classifications similarly risk overlooking key topological features. Here, without relying on any topological invariant, we develop an AI-based unsupervised classification of symmetry-protected non-Hermitian topological phases. This algorithm distinguishes topological differences among non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with symmetries, and constructs, in an unsupervised manner, a topological periodic table for non-Hermitian systems. Additionally, it can account for the boundary effects, enabling the exploration of open-boundary effects on the topological phase diagram. These results introduce an unsupervised approach for classifying symmetry-protected non-Hermitian topological phases without omission and provide valuable guidance for the development of theories and experiments.

Title: Physical scaling laws in dislocation microstructures and avalanches from dislocation dynamics simulations
Authors: Missipsa Aissaoui, Charlie Kahloun, Oguz Umut Salman, Sylvain Queyreau
Abstract: Avalanche-like plastic bursts in crystalline materials follow power law statistics, but the scaling exponents and cutoff parameters vary widely in the literature ($\alpha$ ranging from -1 to -2.2), hindering predictive modeling. Since distributions do not follow Gaussian behavior, the average of plastic kinetics is not correctly defined. Larger-scale models that rely on average behavior are therefore fundamentally flawed. We performed extensive 3D Dislocation Dynamics simulations of FCC Cu deformation across three orders of magnitude in dislocation density ($\rho = 5 \ 10^{10} \ \text{à} \ 2 \ 10^{12} \ \text{m}^{-2}$) under constant strain rates. Our results demonstrate that the power law exponent ($\alpha \approx $ -1.6 to -1.7 ) is invariant to both dislocation density and loading direction, resolving previous inconsistencies. However, dislocation density strongly controls the power law truncation scaling ($\Delta \gamma_{max} \propto \ b/\sqrt{\rho}$) and the distribution of avalanche triggering stresses. We quantify correlations between slip system activities and show how individual system contributions evolve with avalanche size. These findings reconcile experimental scatter in avalanche statistics and provide quantitative scaling laws for mesoscale-to-continuum plasticity models.

Title: Intrinsic space-time crystalline order in a hybrid Josephson junction
Authors: M. Nashaat, J. Tekić, Yu. M. Shukrinov
Abstract: We demonstrate the emergence of an intrinsic space-time crystalline order in a long ferromagnetic $\varphi_{0}$ Josephson junction on a topological insulator without any external periodic modulation. The presence of the exchange and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions in a ferromagnetic layer with broken inversion symmetry internally modulates the critical current due to the coupling between the magnetic moment and the Josephson phase. This breaks the time translation symmetry, leading to the appearance of the space-time crystalline pattern in the spatiotemporal dependence of the in-plane current, which oscillates with almost twice the ferromagnetic resonance frequency. In the limit where the critical current is not modulated internally, the space-time crystalline order does not occur. In this case, only when an external parametric modulation is applied, the system exhibits a typical classical discrete space-time crystalline order that oscillates at half of the modulation frequency. Considering the still-pending problem of experimental detection, we demonstrate that a recently developed magnetometry device, which visualizes the supercurrent flow at the nanoscale, can be used to detect space-time crystalline patterns in hybrid Josephson junctions experimentally.

Title: Stability of the Mott phase in excitonic double layers
Authors: K. Ziegler, R. Ya. Kezerashvili
Abstract: We study the stability of excitonic Mott phases in the presence of a periodic potential and a non-local exciton-exciton interaction. The non-local interaction is treated in a mean-field approximation, while the local repulsion of the excitons is treated in a hopping expansion. The convergence of the latter is the criterion for the stability of the Mott phase with respect to quantum and thermal fluctuations. This hybrid approach enables us to establish a phase diagram for a bosonic Mott to superfluid transition. Our results could be useful to interpret recent experiments on electron-hole crystals in van der Waals heterostructures.

Title: Signatures of Majorana bound states in scanning gate microscopy of hybrid nanowires
Authors: S. Maji, M. P. Nowak
Abstract: We theoretically study scanning gate microscopy of a superconductor-proximitized semiconducting wire focusing on the potential for detection of Majorana bound states. We exploit the possibility to create a local potential perturbation by the scanning gate tip which allows controllable modification of the spatial distribution of the Majorana modes, which is translated into changes in their energy structure. When the tip scans across the system, it effectively divides the wire into two parts with controllable lengths, in which two pairs of Majorana states are created when the system is in the topological regime. For strong values of the tip potential, the pairs are decoupled, and the presence of Majorana states can be detected via local tunneling spectroscopy that resolves the energy splittings resulting from the Majorana states wave functions overlap. Importantly, as the system is probed spatially via the tip, this technique can distinguish Majorana bound states from quasi-Majorana states localized on smooth potential barriers. We demonstrate that for weaker tip potentials, the two neighboring Majorana states hybridize, opening pronounced anticrossings in the energy spectra which are reflected in local conductance maps and which result in non-zero non-local conductance features. Finally, we demonstrate that the scanning gate microscopy technique can be used to discriminate between the trivial and topological nature of the zero-bias conductance peak in disordered wires.

Title: Hydrogen liquid-liquid transition from first principles and machine learning
Authors: Giacomo Tenti, Bastian Jäckl, Kousuke Nakano, Matthias Rupp, Michele Casula
Abstract: The molecular-to-atomic liquid-liquid transition (LLT) in high-pressure hydrogen is a fundamental topic touching domains from planetary science to materials modeling. Yet, the nature of the LLT is still under debate. To resolve it, numerical simulations must cover length and time scales spanning several orders of magnitude. We overcome these size and time limitations by constructing a fast and accurate machine-learning interatomic potential (MLIP) built on the MACE neural network architecture. The MLIP is trained on Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) density functional calculations and uses a modified loss function correcting for an energy bias in the molecular phase. Classical and path-integral molecular dynamics driven by this MLIP show that the LLT is always supercritical above the melting temperature. The position of the corresponding Widom line agrees with previous ab initio PBE calculations, which in contrast predicted a first-order LLT. According to our calculations, the crossover line becomes a first-order transition only inside the molecular crystal region. These results call for a reconsideration of the LLT picture previously drawn.

Title: Spin correlations in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ superconducting thin films

Abstract: The discovery of ambient-pressure superconductivity with $T_{c,\text{onset}} > 40$ K in {\LNO} (LNO) thin films grown on the SrLaAlO$_4$ (SLAO) substrate with compressive ($\varepsilon\approx-2\%$) epitaxial strain provides a unique platform for investigating the superconducting mechanisms in nickelate superconductors. Here, we use resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) to unveil the dispersive spin excitations in the LNO/SLAO superconducting thin film and establish the strain dependence of the electronic and spin excitations in LNO thin films with strain ranging from $\varepsilon\approx-2\%$ to $+1.9\%$. Compared with the bulk crystal, the LNO/SLAO thin film (with $\varepsilon\approx-2\%$) exhibits similar $dd$ excitations and spin dynamics with larger bandwidth. By contrast, tensile-strained LNO/SrTiO$_3$ ($\varepsilon \approx +1.9\%$) exhibits a marked suppression of both the spin excitations and the Ni 3{\dz}-derived $dd$ excitations. The strain dependence of the spin excitations reflects significant changes in the interlayer exchange coupling $J_z$, and the diminishing $dd$ excitations in tensile-strained samples indicate weaker Ni 3{\dz}-O 2$p_{z}$ hybridization. This strain evolution of the spin excitations and $J_z$ is attributed to the strain-tuned $c$-axis Ni-O-Ni bond angle $\varphi$, which controls the Ni 3{\dz}-O 2$p_{z}$ hybridization. Since superconductivity is observed only in films grown on SLAO, and spin correlations are enhanced along with the emergence of superconductivity, our results identify $\varphi$ as a key structural lever controlling $J_z$ and provide direct spectroscopic support for interlayer spin-fluctuation-mediated pairing scenarios in bilayer nickelates.

Abstract: Neutron diffraction experiments of TmFeO$_3$ single crystals were performed in the external magnetic fields. The field along $c$-axis increases temperature of spin-reorientation transition $T_{SR}$ from phase ${\Gamma}4$ to ${\Gamma}2$. Application of the field along $b$-axis led to the decrease of $T_{SR}$ and to the formation of new phases. Based on the temperature and field dependence of the Bragg reflection intensity, the configuration of magnetically induced phases was proposed.

Title: Origin and emergent features of many-body dynamical localization
Authors: Ang Yang, Zekai Chen, Yanliang Guo, Manuele Landini, Hanns-Christoph Nägerl, Lei Ying
Abstract: The question of whether interactions can break dynamical localization in quantum kicked rotor systems has been the subject of a long--standing debate. Here, we introduce an extended mapping from the kicked Lieb--Liniger model to a high--dimensional lattice model and reveal universal features: on--site pseudorandomness and hybrid exponential--algebraic decay couplings with increasing momenta. We find that the exponent and the amplitude of the algebraic decay undergo a crossover as the interaction strength increases. This mapping predicts the existence of dynamical localization and its breakdown at large kick strengths and intermediate interaction strengths. An analysis of the generalized fractal dimension and level--spacing ratio supports these findings, highlighting the presence of near integrability and multifractality in different regions of parameter space. Our results offer an explanation for the occurrence of many--body dynamical localization, particularly in strongly correlated quantum gases, and are anticipated to generalize to systems of many particles.

Title: Exact Chiral Symmetries of 3+1D Hamiltonian Lattice Fermions
Authors: Lei Gioia, Ryan Thorngren
Abstract: We construct Hamiltonian models on a 3+1d cubic lattice for a single Weyl fermion and for a single Weyl doublet protected by exact (as opposed to emergent) chiral symmetries. In the former, we find a not-on-site, non-compact chiral symmetry which can be viewed as a Hamiltonian analog of the Ginsparg-Wilson symmetry in Euclidean lattice models of Weyl fermions. In the latter, we combine an on-site $U(1)$ symmetry with a not-on-site $U(1)$ symmetry, which together generate the $SU(2)$ flavor symmetry of the doublet at low energies, while in the UV they generate an algebra known in integrability as the Onsager algebra. This latter model is in fact the celebrated magnetic Weyl semimetal which is known to have a chiral anomaly from the action of $U(1)$ and crystalline translation, that gives rise to an anomalous Hall response - however reinterpreted in our language, it has two exact $U(1)$ symmetries that gives rise to the global $SU(2)$ anomaly which protects the gaplessness even when crystalline translations are broken. We also construct an exact symmetry-protected single Dirac cone in 2+1d with the $U(1) \rtimes T$ parity anomaly. Our constructions evade both old and recently-proven no-go theorems by using not-on-siteness in a crucial way, showing our results are sharp.

Title: Scalable Multitemperature Free Energy Sampling of Classical Ising Spin States
Authors: Ping Tuo, Zezhu Zeng, Jiale Chen, Bingqing Cheng
Abstract: Generative models have advanced significantly in sampling material systems with continuous variables, such as atomistic structures. However, their application to discrete variables, like atom types or spin states, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce a discrete flow matching model, tailored for systems with discrete phase-space coordinates (e.g., the Ising model or a multicomponent system on a lattice). This approach enables a single model to sample free energy surfaces over a wide temperature range with minimal training overhead, and the model generation is scalable to larger lattice sizes than those in the training set. We demonstrate our approach on the 2D Ising model, showing efficient and reliable free energy sampling. These results highlight the potential of flow matching for low-cost, scalable free energy sampling in discrete systems and suggest promising extensions to alchemical degrees of freedom in crystalline materials. The codebase developed for this work is openly available at this https URL.

Title: The Role of Hydrogen and Oxygen Interstitial Defects in Crystalline Si cells: Mechanism of Device Degradation in Humid Environment
Authors: Bo Li, Feifei Zhang, Yu Pang, Jinyu Hu, Huiyan Zhao, Guocai Liu, Chao He, Xingtao An
Abstract: The efficiency of silicon solar cells gradually decreases in various environments, with humidity being a key factor contributing to this decline through moisture-induced degradation (MID) involving multiple mechanisms including encapsulant hydrolysis and metal ion migration. Among these mechanisms, the role of water-derived hydrogen and oxygen interstitial defects represents an underexplored yet fundamental degradation pathway. This study employs density functional theory and quantum transport theory to investigate hydrogen and oxygen interstitial defects as a novel perspective for understanding MID mechanisms. Results reveal that neutral hydrogen interstitials at bond-center sites exhibit low diffusion barriers (0.96 eV) and act as deep-level recombination centers, while oxygen interstitials face higher diffusion barriers (2.2 eV) with limited trapping capability. Device simulations demonstrate that hydrogen defects cause substantially more pronounced photovoltaic current degradation through enhanced non-radiative recombination. Critically, under humid conditions, hydrogen from water molecules readily penetrates silicon lattices forming active recombination centers, while oxygen incorporation remains kinetically limited with negligible impact. This interstitial defect perspective provides novel understanding of MID mechanisms, explaining why moisture exposure primarily degrades silicon solar cells through hydrogen rather than oxygen incorporation, offering fundamental insights for developing targeted mitigation strategies.

Title: Towards Markov-State Holography
Authors: Xizhu Zhao, Dmitrii E. Makarov, Aljaž Godec
Abstract: Experiments, in particular on biological systems, typically probe lower-dimensional observables which are projections of high-dimensional dynamics. In order to infer consistent models capturing the relevant dynamics of the system, it is important to detect and account for the memory in the dynamics. We develop a method to infer the presence of hidden states and transition pathways based on observable transition probabilities conditioned on history sequences of visited states for projected (i.e. observed) dynamics of Markov processes. Histograms conditioned on histories reveal information on the transition probabilities of hidden paths locally between any specific pair of observed states. The convergence rate of these histograms towards a stationary distribution provides a local quantification of the duration of memory, which reflects how distinct microscopic paths projecting onto the same observed transition decorrelate in path space. This motivates the notion of "weak Markov order" and provides insight about the hidden topology of microscopic paths in a holography-like fashion. The method can be used to test for the local Markov property of observables. The information extracted is also helpful in inferring relevant hidden transitions which are not captured by a Markov-state model.

Title: Content-Addressable Memory with a Content-Free Energy Function
Authors: Félix Benoist, Luca Peliti, Pablo Sartori
Abstract: Content-addressable memory, i.e. stored information that can be retrieved from content-based cues, is key to computation. Besides natural and artificial neural networks, physical learning systems have recently been shown to have remarkable ability in this domain. While classical neural network models encode memories as energy minima, biochemical systems have been shown to be able to process information based on purely kinetic principles. This opens the question of whether neural networks can also encode information kinetically. Here, we propose a minimal model for content-addressable memory in which the kinetics, and not the energy function, are used to encode patterns. We find that the performance of this kinetic encoding approach is comparable to that of classical energy-based encoding schemes. This highlights the fundamental significance of the kinetic stability of kinetic traps as an alternative to the thermodynamic stability of energy minima, offering new insights into the principles of computation in physical and synthetic systems.

Abstract: The recursion method provides a powerful framework for studying quantum many-body dynamics in the Lanczos basis recursively constructed within the Krylov space of operators. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the recursion method, when supplemented by the universal operator growth hypothesis, can effectively compute autocorrelation functions and transport coefficients at infinite temperature. We extend the scope of the recursion method to far-from-equilibrium quench dynamics. We apply the method to spin systems in one, two, and three spatial dimensions. In one dimension its usefulness is limited: although it remains accurate at moderate times, it eventually experiences an abrupt breakdown and subsequently yields results that deviate strongly from the true dynamics. In contrast, in two and three dimensions the method proves far more effective, providing a reasonably accurate description of the evolution across all time scales -- from the initial transient regime to thermalization.

Title: Dynamics and fragmentation of bosons in an optical lattice inside a cavity using Wannier and position bases
Authors: Christopher Gerard R. Sevilla, Jayson G. Cosme
Abstract: The atom-cavity system is a versatile platform for emulating light-matter systems and realizing dissipation-induced phases, such as limit cycles (LCs) and time crystals. Here, we study the dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) inside an optical cavity with transverse pumping and an additional intracavity optical lattice along the cavity axis. Specifically, we explore the theoretical predictions obtained from expanding the atomic field operators of the second-quantized Hamiltonian in two ways: (i) position basis and (ii) single-band Wannier basis. Both bases agree on the existence of most types of static and dynamical phases. However, the large sea of irregular dynamical phase, captured within the position basis, is absent in the Wannier basis. Moreover, we show that they predict different types of LCs due to the inherent limitation of the single-band Wannier expansion, highlighting the importance of including higher energy bands to correctly capture certain phenomena. Using truncated Wigner approximation, we investigate the fragmentation dynamics of the BEC. We demonstrate that both position and Wannier bases qualitatively agree on the photon-mediated fragmentation dynamics of the BEC in the density-wave phase, despite the absence of interatomic interactions. The presence of interatomic interaction leads to further fragmentation, which can only be observed in larger system sizes. Finally, we predict a sudden increase in the fragmentation behavior for larger pump intensities.

Title: Quantum thermocouples: nonlocal conversion and control of heat in nanostructures
Authors: José Balduque, Rafael Sánchez
Abstract: Nanoscale conductors are interesting for thermoelectrics because of their particular spectral features connecting separated heat and particle currents. Multiterminal devices in the quantum regime benefit from phase-coherent phenomena, which turns the thermoelectric effect nonlocal, and from tunable single-particle interactions. This way one can define quantum thermocouples which convert an injected heat current into useful power in an isothermal conductor, or work as refrigerators. Additionally, efficient heat management devices can be defined. We review recent theoretical and experimental progress in the research of multiterminal thermal and thermoelectric quantum transport leading to proposals of autonomous quantum heat engines and thermal devices.

Title: An Optimally Accurate Lanczos Algorithm in the Matrix Product State Representation
Authors: Yu Wang, Zhangyu Yang, Xingyao Wu, Christian B. Mendl
Abstract: We improve the convergence of the Lanczos algorithm using the matrix product state representation. As an alternative to the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), the Lanczos algorithm avoids local minima and can directly find multiple low-lying eigenstates. However, its performance and accuracy are affected by the truncation required to maintain the efficiency of the tensor network representation. In this work, we propose the modified thick-block Lanczos method to enhance the convergence of the Lanczos algorithm with MPS representation. We benchmark our method on one-dimensional instances of the Fermi-Hubbard model and the Heisenberg model in an external field, using numerical experiments targeting the first five lowest eigenstates. Across these tests, our approach attains the best possible accuracy permitted by the given bond dimension. This work establishes the Lanczos method as a reliable and accurate framework for finding multiple low-lying states within a tensor-network representation

Title: Beyond kagome: $p$-bands in kagome metals
Authors: Alexander A. Tsirlin, Ece Uykur
Abstract: We review recent studies on quantum materials where transition-metal atoms give rise to $d$-bands typical of kagome metals. Using examples from several material families - AV$_3$Sb$_5$, FeGe, RV$_6$Sn$_6$, and LaRu$_3$Si$_2$ - we argue that $p$-bands contributed by elements beyond the kagome network also play a crucial role in the electronic instabilities, including the charge-density-waves and superconductivity in kagome metals.

Title: Tunable Hilbert space fragmentation and extended critical regime
Authors: Mateusz Lisiecki, Janez Bonča, Marcin Mierzejewski, Jacek Herbrych, Patrycja Łydżba
Abstract: Systems exhibiting the Hilbert-space fragmentation are nonergodic, and their Hamiltonians decompose into exponentially many blocks in the computational basis. In many cases, these blocks can be labeled by eigenvalues of statistically localized integrals of motion (SLIOM), which play a similar role in fragmented systems as local integrals of motion in integrable systems. While a nonzero perturbation eliminates all nontrivial conserved quantities from integrable models, we demonstrate for the $t$-$J_z$ chain that an appropriately chosen perturbation may gradually eliminate SLIOMs (one by one) by progressively merging the fragmented subspaces. This gradual recovery of ergodicity manifests as an extended critical regime characterized by multiple peaks of the fidelity susceptibility. Each peak signals a change in the number of SLIOMs and blocks, as well as an ultra-slow relaxation of local observables.

Title: Ordered buckling structures in a twisted crimped tube
Authors: Pan Dong, Nathan C. Keim, Joseph D. Paulsen
Abstract: When a ribbon or tube is twisted far enough it forms buckles and wrinkles. Its new geometry can be strikingly ordered, or hopelessly disordered. Here we study this process in a tube with hybrid boundary conditions: one end a cylinder, and the other end crimped flat like a ribbon, so that the sample resembles a toothpaste tube. The resulting irregular structures and mechanical responses can be dramatically different from those of a ribbon. However, when we form two creases in the tube prior to twisting, we obtain an ordered structure composed of repeating triangular facets oriented at varying angles, and a more elastic torque response, reminiscent of the creased helicoid structure of a twisted ribbon. We measure how the torque and structural evolution depend on parameters such as material thickness and the twist angle. When only part of the tube is pre-creased, the ordered structures are confined to this segment. Surprisingly, in some tubes made from thicker sheets, an ordered structure forms without pre-creasing. This study provides insights into controlling the buckling of thin shells, offering a potential pathway for designing ordered structures in soft materials.

Title: Highly polar groups and supramolecular order enable charge injection and long-range conductivity in organic materials without extended π-systems
Authors: H. Mager, A. A. Butkevich, S. Klubertz, S. V. Haridas, O. Shyshov, V. C. Wakchaure, J. Borstelmann, I. Michalsky, M. García-Iglesias, V. Rodríguez, D. González-Rodríguez, A. R. A. Palmans, M. Kivala, M. von Delius, M. Kemerink
Abstract: Electronic conductivity in organic materials is well-established. Both semiconductive and metallic behavior is observed in (quasi) 0-, 1-, 2- and 3-dimensional carbon-based materials and is applied in a wide range of commercial devices. Despite their large structural variety, these materials commonly have an extended {\pi}-system, formed by a double-digit number of conjugated sp2-hybridized carbon atoms, which is responsible for the conductivity. Here, we present a class of organic molecular materials that, despite the absence of an extended {\pi}-system, show a distinct direct current conductivity in quasi-1D supramolecular stacks of small organic molecules. Long-range conductivity takes place by removal of an electron from the highest occupied molecular orbital, i.e. oxidation, followed by charge transfer between neighboring molecules. Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) on thin-film devices shows that the resulting transport band only becomes energetically accessible for charge injection from the contacts thanks to interfacial dipoles that shift the relevant molecular orbital levels by up to 2 eV. Long-range order in the form of fibrillar supramolecular polymers with lengths exceeding several micrometers enhances the macroscopic conductivity but is not essential. While current densities are moderate, this work provides a compelling explanation for the existing body of knowledge on non-{\pi}-conjugated conductivity and suggests a new way to endow organic materials with conductivity.

Title: Influence of atomic-scale defects on coherent phonon excitations by THz near fields in an STM
Authors: Vibhuti N. Rai, Junyoung Sim, Florian Faaber, Nils Bogdanoff, Sergey Trishin, Paul Wiechers, Tom S. Seifert, Tobias Kampfrath, Christian Lotze, Katharina J. Franke
Abstract: Coherent phonons describe the collective, ultrafast motion of atoms and play a central role in light-induced structural dynamics. Here, we employ terahertz scanning tunneling microscopy (THz-STM) to excite and detect coherent phonons in semiconducting 2H-$MoTe_{2}$ and resolve how their excitation is influenced by atomic-scale defects. In a THz pump-probe scheme, we observe long-lived oscillatory signals that we assign to out-of-plane breathing and in-plane shear modes, which are both forbidden in the bulk. Remarkably, the relative excitation strength of these modes varies near defects, indicating that local band bending modulates the coupling to the THz field. This defect-tunable coupling offers new opportunities to control material properties via selective excitation of vibrational modes at the nanoscale.

Title: Topological Signatures of Magnetic Phase Transitions with Majorana Fermions through Local Observables and Quantum Information
Authors: Karyn Le Hur, Fan Yang, Magali Korolev
Abstract: The one-dimensional (1D) $J_1-J_2$ quantum spin model can be viewed as a strong-coupling analogue of the Schrieffer-Su-Heeger model with two inequivalent alternating Ising couplings along the wire, associated to the physics of resonating valence bonds. Similar to the quantum Ising model, which differently presents a long-range N\' eel ordered phase, this model also maps onto a p-wave superconducting wire which shows a topological phase transition with the emergence of low-energy Majorana fermions. We show how signatures of the topological phase transition for the p-wave superconducting wire, i.e. a half Skyrmion, are revealed through local (short-range) spin observables and their derivatives related to the capacitance of the pairing fermion model. Then, we present an edge correspondence through the edge spin susceptibility in the $J_1-J_2$ model revealing that the topological phase transition is a metal of Majorana fermions. We justify that the spin magnetization at an edge at very small transverse magnetic field is a good marker of the topological invariant and of Majorana zero modes. We identify a correspondence between the quantum information of resonating valence bonds and the charge fluctuations in a p-wave superconductor through our method "the bipartite fluctuations". Physical properties of this 1D model are in fact robust when including additional interactions, which is optimistic for practical applications e.g. in quantum circuits.

Title: Canonical Thermodynamics
Authors: Arnaldo Spalvieri
Abstract: The paper demonstrates that the canonical probability distribution of the occupancy numbers of a bosonic system is multinomial, and shows how the thermodynamics of the canonical system descends from this distribution. The categorical distribution (i.e. the one-particle probability distribution of occupancy of the quantum eigenstates allowed to a particle of the system) of the multinomial distribution should be derived from constrained maximization of the Shannon entropy of the multinomial distribution. However, since the multinomial distribution intractable, one must renounce to a closed-form solution to the constrained maximization problem. The analysis is then focused on the thermal state, that is characterized by the constraint on system's expected energy. In this case, the paper proposes to consider a suboptimal tractable categorical distribution, which is likely to be close to the actual categorical maximizer, and shows that the one-particle Boltzmann distribution is a good approximation to the actual categorical maximizer only in certain cases, including the classical regime. The unexpected result is that, in the general case, the approximation that we find to the categorical maximizer is not of exponential type, or, in other words, is not the one-particle Boltzmann distribution. As a consequence, the probability distribution of microstates is not of exponential type. As in the standard analysis, it is always equal to the product of factors but, in the general case, these factors are not the Boltzmann factors, therefore the probability of a microstate can be different from the probability of another microstate even when the two have the same energy.

Title: AstroECP: towards more practical Electron Channeling Contrast Imaging
Authors: M. Haroon Qaiser, Lukas Berners, Robin J. Scales, Tianbi Zhang, Martin Heller, Jiri Dluhos, Sandra Korte-Kerzel, T. Ben Britton
Abstract: Electron channeling contrast imaging (ECCI) is a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) based technique that enables bulk-sample characterization of crystallographic defects (e.g. dislocations, stacking faults, low angle boundaries). Despite its potential, ECCI remains underused for quantitative defect analysis as compared to transmission electron microscope (TEM) based methods. Here, we overcome barriers that limit the use of ECCI including optimizing signal-to-noise contrast, precise determination of the incident beam vector with calibrated and easy to use simulations and experimental selected area electron channeling patterns (SA-ECP). We introduce a systematic ECCI workflow, alongside a new open-source software tool (AstroECP), that includes calibration of stage tilting, SA-ECP field of view, and the energy that forms the ECP/ECCI contrast using dynamical simulations. The functionality of this workflow is demonstrated with case studies that include threading dislocations in GaAs and the cross validation of precession based ECCI-contrast, which is otherwise known as Electron Channeling Orientation Determination (eCHORD). To assist the reader, we also provide best practice guidelines for ECCI implementation to promote high-resolution defect imaging in the SEM.

Title: Parameter-aware high-fidelity microstructure generation using stable diffusion
Authors: Hoang Cuong Phan, Minh Tien Tran, Chihun Lee, Hoheok Kim, Sehyeok Oh, Dong-Kyu Kim, Ho Won Lee
Abstract: Synthesizing realistic microstructure images conditioned on processing parameters is crucial for understanding process-structure relationships in materials design. However, this task remains challenging due to limited training micrographs and the continuous nature of processing variables. To overcome these challenges, we present a novel process-aware generative modeling approach based on Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large (SD3.5-Large), a state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion model adapted for microstructure generation. Our method introduces numeric-aware embeddings that encode continuous variables (annealing temperature, time, and magnification) directly into the model's conditioning, enabling controlled image generation under specified process conditions and capturing process-driven microstructural variations. To address data scarcity and computational constraints, we fine-tune only a small fraction of the model's weights via DreamBooth and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), efficiently transferring the pre-trained model to the materials domain. We validate realism using a semantic segmentation model based on a fine-tuned U-Net with a VGG16 encoder on 24 labeled micrographs. It achieves 97.1% accuracy and 85.7% mean IoU, outperforming previous methods. Quantitative analyses using physical descriptors and spatial statistics show strong agreement between synthetic and real microstructures. Specifically, two-point correlation and lineal-path errors remain below 2.1% and 0.6%, respectively. Our method represents the first adaptation of SD3.5-Large for process-aware microstructure generation, offering a scalable approach for data-driven materials design.

Title: Dynamic Avalanches: Rate-Controlled Switching and Race Conditions
Authors: Lishuai Jin, Martin van Hecke
Abstract: Avalanches are rapid cascades of rearrangements driven by cooperative flipping of hysteretic local elements. Here we show that flipping dynamics and race conditions -- where multiple elements become unstable simultaneously -- give rise to dynamic avalanches that cannot be captured by static models of interacting elements. We realize dynamic avalanches in metamaterials with controlled flipping times and demonstrate how this allows us to modify, promote, and direct avalanche behavior. Our work elucidates the crucial role of internal dynamics in complex materials and introduces dynamic design principles for materializing targeted pathways and sequential functionalities.

Title: Anderson-skin dualism: A boundary-dependent effect in non-Hermitian disordered coupled systems
Authors: Shan-Zhong Li, Linhu Li, Shi-Liang Zhu, Zhi Li
Abstract: We report a novel localization phenomenon that emerges in non-Hermitian and quasiperiodic coupled systems, which we dub ``Anderson-Skin (AS) dualism". The emergence of AS dualism is due to the fact that non-Hermitian topological systems provide non-trivial topological transport channels for disordered systems, causing the originally localized Anderson modes to transform into skin modes, i.e., the localized states within the point gap regions have dual characteristics of localization under periodic boundary condition (PBC) and skin effects under open boundary conditions (OBC). As an example, we analytically prove the 1D AS dualism through the transfer matrix method. Moreover, by discussing many-body interacting systems, we confirm that AS dualism is universal.

Title: Interaction-enhanced quantum to classical transport crossover temperature in a Luttinger liquid
Authors: Yen-Wen Lu, Michael Mulligan
Abstract: Strange metals are highly entangled gapless states of matter that exhibit anomalous transport, such as linear in temperature resistivity, over more than a decade of temperature. Why a single power law should be so robust is an open question. We propose a scenario in which interactions enhance the domain of certain scattering regimes, effectively suppressing other ``would-be regimes." We test this proposal in a one-dimensional Luttinger liquid coupled to a one-dimensional acoustic phonon. We use the memory matrix formalism to calculate the dc electrical and thermal conductivities at low and high temperatures, relative to the Debye cutoff on phonon frequencies, in both the ``clean" (umklapp scattering) and ``dirty" (disorder scattering) limits. We find the crossover temperature separating the low and high temperature regimes to be interaction-dependent, with repulsive interactions substantially increasing it, generally by more than an order of magnitude. This provides a concrete illustration for how interactions can extend a single transport regime over a wider temperature range.

Title: Global Synchronization in Matrix-Weighted Networks
Authors: Anna Gallo, Yu Tian, Renaud Lambiotte, Timoteo Carletti
Abstract: Synchronization phenomena in complex systems are fundamental to understanding collective behavior across disciplines. While classical approaches model such systems by using scalar-weighted networks and simple diffusive couplings, many real-world interactions are inherently multidimensional and transformative. To address this limitation, Matrix-Weighted Networks (MWNs) have been introduced as a versatile framework where edges are associated with matrix weights that encode both interaction strength and directional transformation. In this work, we investigate the emergence and stability of global synchronization (GS) in MWNs by studying coupled Stuart-Landau (SL) oscillators, an archetypal model of nonlinear dynamics near a Hopf bifurcation. Besides the SL, we considered a generalization of regular oscillators to higher dimensions and also the Lorenz model as a prototype of chaotic oscillators. We derive a generalized Master Stability Function (MSF) tailored to MWNs and establish necessary and sufficient conditions for GS to occur. Central to our analysis is the concept of coherence, a structural property of MWNs ensuring path-independent transformations. Our results show that coherence is necessary to have global synchronization and provides a theoretical foundation for analyzing multidimensional dynamical processes in complex networked systems.

Title: Amorphous Solid Model of Vectorial Hopfield Neural Networks
Authors: F. Gallavotti, A. Zaccone
Abstract: We introduce a three-dimensional vectorial extension of the Hopfield associative-memory model in which each neuron is a unit vector on $S^2$ and synaptic couplings are $3\times 3$ blocks generated through a vectorial Hebbian rule. The resulting block-structured operator is mathematically analogous to the Hessian of amorphous solids and induces a rigid energy landscape with deep minima for stored patterns. Simulations and spectral analysis show that the vectorial network substantially outperforms the classical binary Hopfield model. For moderate connectivity, the critical storage ratio $\gamma_c$ grows approximately linearly with the coordination number $Z$, while for $Z\gtrsim 40$ a high-connectivity regime emerges in which $\gamma_c$ systematically exceeds the extrapolated low-$Z$ linear fit. At the same time, a persistent spectral gap separates pattern modes from the bulk and basins of attraction enlarge, yielding enhanced robustness to initialization noise. Thus geometric constraints combined with amorphous-solid-inspired structure produce associative memories with superior storage and retrieval performance, especially in the high-connectivity ($Z \gtrsim 20$-$30$) regime.

Title: Triplet correlations in superconductor/antiferromagnet heterostructures: dependence on type of antiferromagnetic ordering
Authors: G. A. Bobkov, V. A. Bobkov, I. V. Bobkova, A. M. Bobkov, A. A. Golubov
Abstract: In recent years, a number of studies have predicted the emergence of a nontrivial proximity effect in superconductor/antiferromagnet (S/AF) heterostructures. This effect is of considerable interest for the efficient integration of antiferromagnetic materials into the fields of superconducting spintronics and electronics. A key element of this proximity effect is the Neel triplet correlations, initially predicted for S/AF heterostructures with checkerboard G-type antiferromagnetic ordering. However, various forms of antiferromagnetic ordering exist, and an important open question concerns the generalization of these results to such cases. In this paper, we develop a theory of the proximity effect in S/AF heterostructures with arbitrary two-sublattice antiferromagnetic ordering, aiming to clarify which antiferromagnets are capable of inducing triplet correlations and what structure these correlations may exhibit. We show that, in S/AF heterostructures with collinear compensated antiferromagnets, the dominant superconducting triplet correlations are of the checkerboard Neel type, as originally predicted for G-type antiferromagnets. In contrast, layered Neel triplet correlations, although potentially generated by layered antiferromagnets, are significantly weaker. Consequently, in S/AF heterostructures with layered antiferromagnetic ordering, the proximity-induced triplet correlations may exhibit either a checkerboard Neel or a conventional ferromagnetic structure, depending on the specific antiferromagnet and its orientation relative to the S/AF interface.

Title: Intrinsic physical properties of flexible van der Waals semiconductor InSe
Authors: Jacob Svane, Kim-Khuong Huynh, Yong P. Chen, Bo Brummerstedt Iversen
Abstract: InSe is a van der Waals semiconductor in which mechanical flexibility, high electronic mobility, and non-trivial electronic structures converge, making it an attractive platform for both intriguing fundamental studies and promising device developments. However, the nucleation and growth of phase-pure, intrinsic InSe crystals require stringent thermodynamical conditions, and have therefore remained elusive. Since InSe melts incongruently, the widely used synthesis methods based on cooling of a 1:1 In-Se mixture will produce either aggregates of multiphase crystallites or uncontrolled In-rich, heavily electron-doped InSe. This fundamental thermodynamic constraint provides a compelling explanation for the large discrepancies observed in the reported physical properties of InSe. We overcome these limitations by utilizing the traveling solvent floating zone (TSFZ) method to produce high quality, centimeter-size InSe single crystals. Electrical, thermal, and thermoelectric transport measurements demonstrate that TSFZ-InSe single crystals closely approach the intrinsic limit, establishing it as a benchmark material for the future studies of this important material.

Title: Optimization of Ab-Initio Based Tight-Binding Models
Authors: Henrik Dick, Thomas Dahm
Abstract: The electronic structure of solids can routinely be calculated by standard methods like density functional theory. However, in complicated situations like interfaces, grain boundaries or contact geometries one needs to resort to more simplified models of the electronic structure. Tight-binding models are using a reduced set of orbitals and aim to approximate the electronic structure by short range hopping processes. For example, maximally localized Wannier functions are often used for that purpose. However, their accuracy is limited by the need to disentangle the electronic bands. Here, we develop and investigate a different procedure to obtain tight-binding models inspired by machine-learning techniques. The model parameters are optimized in such a way as to reproduce ab-initio band structure data as accurately as possible using an as small as possible number of model parameters. The procedure is shown to result in models with smaller ranges and fewer orbitals than maximally localized Wannier functions but same or even better accuracy. We argue that such a procedure is more useful for automated construction of tight-binding models particularly for large-scale materials calculations.

Title: A Class of Exclusion Processes Capable of Exhibiting Current Reversal
Authors: Ngo Phuoc Nguyen Ngoc, Lam Thi Nhung
Abstract: A century after Ising introduced the Ising measure to study equilibrium systems, its relevance has expanded well beyond equilibrium contexts, notably appearing in non-equilibrium frameworks such as the Katz--Lebowitz--Spohn (KLS) model. In this work, we investigate a class of generalized asymmetric simple exclusion processes (ASEP) for which the Ising measure serves as the stationary state. We show that the average stationary current in these models can display current reversal and other unconventional behaviors, offering new insights into transport phenomena in non-equilibrium systems. Moreover, although long-range interaction rates often give rise to long-range interactions in the potential function, our model provides a counterexample: even with long-range interactions in the dynamics, the resulting potential remains short-ranged. Finally, our framework encompasses several well-known models as special cases, including ASEP, the KLS model, the facilitated exclusion process, the cooperative exclusion process, and the assisted exchange model.

Title: A route to fully-compensated ferrimagnetic metal: electric-field annihilation of the bilayer bandgap
Authors: San-Dong Guo, Rongyuan Bian, Feng-Ren Fan, Alessandro Stroppa
Abstract: Fully-compensated ferrimagnet has garnered widespread attention due to its zero-net total magnetic moment and non-relativistic global spin splitting. In general, for a fully-compensated ferrimagnet, at least one spin channel should be gapped to ensure a zero-net total magnetic moment, which would lead to a fully-compensated ferrimagnetic (FC-FIM) semiconductor or half-metal, and appears to limit the existence of an FC-FIM metal. Here we propose that an FC-FIM metal can be achieved by electrically closing the gap of a bilayer system. Using two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnetic (FM) semiconductor as building block, we examine both FM and antiferromagnetic (AFM) interlayer couplings and distinguish unipolar magnetic semiconductor (UMS) and bipolar magnetic semiconductor (BMS) monolayers. It is concluded that an electric field can annihilate the bilayer gap and realize the FC-FIM metal only when the interlayer coupling is AFM and the building block is a UMS. Our scheme for realizing an FC-FIM metal can be generalized to electrically tuned 2D spin-degenerate metal with spin-layer locking. Using first-principles calculations, we have validated our proposal by taking bilayer MnOF, bilayer $\mathrm{ScI_2}$ and monolayer $\mathrm{Hf_2S}$ as examples. Our work offers an alternative route to realize the originally forbidden FC-FIM metal, paving the way for further exploration of FC-FIM metal.

Title: Spin-chirality-dependent modulation of topological gap, Chern number, and valley-polarization in monolayer kagome lattice Cr3Se4
Authors: Wenzhe Zhou, Guibo Zheng, Yating Li, Aolin Li, Fangping Ouyang
Abstract: Kagome materials exhibit unique electronic properties, such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect. The control of Chern numbers is critical for quantum device manipulation, but existing research has mainly focused on collinear magnetization while neglecting chiral spin textures. Through first-principles calculations and tight-binding modeling of monolayer Cr3Se4, this study reveals spin-chirality-dependent control of topological gaps, Chern numbers, and valley polarization in kagome materials. The results demonstrate that the azimuthal angle has no observable effect. For collinear magnetization (\k{appa} = 0) or spin-chirality \k{appa} = -1, the topological bandgap decreases as the spin orientation approaches the in-plane direction. Conversely, increasing the polar angle enhances the bandgap for \k{appa} = 1. In the breathing kagome lattice, the degeneracy between K and K' valleys is lifted. As the gap undergoes sequential closure and reopening in the two valleys, the structural asymmetry and spin-chirality allow for controlled tuning of the topological gap, Chern number, and valley polarization. Moreover, the emergence of a topological Hall effect is is also demonstrated. These findings provide strategies for controlling topological states and advancing applications in quantum devices and valleytronic systems.

Title: Thermally Activated Snap-through Transitions Controlled by Tunable Metastability
Authors: Renjie Zhao, Yiquan Zhang, Chenglin Luo, Yihang Wang
Abstract: The effects of thermal fluctuations on the morphology of two-dimensional materials are hard to harness. We propose that a geometrically constrained graphene nanoribbon (GNR) can exhibit thermally activated snap-through transitions with a predictable and controllable transition rate constant. The energetics and kinetics of such transitions can be fully captured by combining enhanced sampling methods and generalized transition state theory. Using well-tempered metadynamics, we determine the free energy landscape and a pair of asymmetric transition pathways of the GNR system. Notably, generalized transition state theory accurately captures how the transition rate constant responds to temperature and the tunable free energy landscape of our system. This work offers a theoretical framework for elastic metastability, introduces rare event methods into thermalized nanomechanical systems, and provides potential applications in designing nanoscale thermal switches and thermal actuators.

Title: Superpotentials, flat bands and the role of Quantum Geometry for the superfluid stiffness
Authors: T. Bauch, F. Lombardi, G. Seibold
Abstract: Enhancing superconductivity through material design is a central goal in quantum materials research. Moire engineering, where twisting stacked layers creates long-wavelength modulations and flat bands, has shown how electronic correlations can be amplified and eventually used to raise the superconducting critical temperature Tc. Yet this approach is largely confined to van der Waals materials and offers limited tunability. Here we explore a moire-inspired alternative: imposing artificial superpotentials on otherwise homogeneous systems to engineer flat electronic minibands. Whether such superlattice potentials can truly enhance superconductivity and sustain a finite superfluid stiffness remains, however, an open question. Our calculations show that a periodic superpotential imposed to a 2D system can indeed enhance superconductivity by reconstructing the electronic bands and creating regions of large density of states, leading to a substantial increase of Tc. In contrast to conventional flat band systems, where the superfluid stiffness arises solely from quantum geometry through the quantum metric, a modulated system inherits kinetic energy from the filled minibands below the Fermi level. This inherited component coexists with a positive quantum geometric contribution, yielding a finite and robust stiffness even when the upper band becomes nearly flat. The resulting superconducting state remains coherent and resilient against weak to moderate disorder. Our findings demonstrate that engineered superpotentials offer a tunable route to enhance superconductivity beyond twist based moire systems, unifying flat band amplification of pairing with preserved phase stiffness. They further highlight the central role of quantum geometry in shaping collective electronic phenomena and point to superlattice design as a promising platform for next-generation superconductors.

Title: Parameter degeneracy in the vertex model for tissues
Authors: Paulo C. Godolphim, Leonardo G. Brunnet, Rodrigo Soto
Abstract: The vertex model with homogeneous cell properties is known to exhibit a parameter degeneracy in which the system's dynamics is independent of the target area. Here, we show, for the heterogeneous vertex model where cells differ in size and stiffness, that degeneracy is also present with the average product of target areas and stiffness becoming dynamically irrelevant. Fixing this quantity is equivalent to fixing the global internal tissue pressure. Unless properly treated, this degeneracy undermines the physical relevance of key observables' numerical values, such as cell target shape index, cell pressure, and cell stress tensor. We present methods to resolve the degeneracy and to correctly set the gauge pressure via symmetry transformations applied to the cells' target areas. We further demonstrate that the degeneracy is removed under certain boundary conditions and partially lifted when spherical tissues are modeled using a locally planar approximation, leading to numerical consequences when fitting model parameters to experimental data. The approach extends beyond vertex models and provides a framework for testing whether the parameter spaces of other physical models are free from degeneracy.

Title: Isofrequency spin-wave imaging using color center magnetometry for magnon spintronics
Authors: Samuel Mañas-Valero, Yasmin C. Doedes, Artem Bondarenko, Michael Borst, Samer Kurdi, Thomas Poirier, James H. Edgar, Vincent Jacques, Yaroslav M. Blanter, Toeno van der Sar
Abstract: Magnon spintronics aims to harness spin waves in magnetic films for information technologies. Color center magnetometry is a promising tool for imaging spin waves, using electronic spins associated with atomic defects in solid-state materials as sensors. However, two main limitations persist: the magnetic fields required for spin-wave control detune the sensor-spin detection frequency, and this frequency is further restricted by the color center nature. Here, we overcome these limitations by decoupling the sensor spins from the spin-wave control fields -selecting color centers with intrinsic anisotropy axes orthogonal to the film magnetization- and by using color centers in diamond and hexagonal boron nitride to operate at complementary frequencies. We demonstrate isofrequency imaging of field-controlled spin waves in a magnetic half-plane and show how intrinsic magnetic anisotropies trigger bistable spin textures that govern spin-wave transport at device edges. Our results establish color center magnetometry as a versatile tool for advancing spin-wave technologies.

Title: Shape of liquid meniscus in open cells of varying geometry: a combined study via simulation and experiment
Authors: Konstantin S. Kolegov, Viktor M. Fliagin, Natalia A. Ivanova
Abstract: Evaporative lithography in cells of arbitrary configuration allows for the creation of diverse particle deposition patterns due to the formation of a specific flow structure in the liquid caused by non-uniform evaporation. The latter in turn is determined by the shape of the liquid layer surface and the wetting menisci on the cell walls. Thus, predicting the shape of the wetting menisci can serve as a tool for controlling the process of creating desired particle deposition patterns and evaporation dynamics. Here, we propose a simple and sufficiently accurate methodology for determining the shape of the liquid meniscus in cells of arbitrary geometric shape, based on a combination of mathematical modeling and a series of experimental measurement techniques. The surface profiles of the liquid meniscus in cylindrical, square, and triangular cells were determined by measuring the change in the reflection angle of a laser beam from the free liquid surface while scanning from the cell wall to its center. The height of the wetting meniscus on the inner cell wall and the minimum liquid layer thickness at the center of the cell were measured by analyzing optical images and using a contact method, respectively. 3D meniscus profiles were obtained by numerically solving the Helmholtz equation. The boundary conditions and the unknown constant in the equation were determined based on experimental data obtained for several local points or cross-sections. The simulated meniscus shapes showed satisfactory agreement with the experimental local measurements, with a maximum relative error of less than 14%.

Title: Spin-Orbit Coupling Effect on the Seebeck Coefficient in Dirac Electron Systems in $α$-(BETS)$_2$I$_3$
Authors: Yoshikazu Suzumura, Takao Tsumuraya, Masao Ogata
Abstract: The Seebeck coefficient, $S=L_{12}/(TL_{11})$, which is proportional to a ratio of the thermoelectric conductivity $L_{12}$ to the electric conductivity $L_{11}$ with $T$ being temperature is examined for two-dimensional Dirac electrons in the three-quarter filled organic conductor, $\alpha$-(BETS)$_2$I$_3$, [BETS = BEDT-TSeF = bis(ethylenedithio)tetraselenafulvalene] at ambient this http URL a tight-binding model obtained with the first-principles relativistic density-functional theory method [Tsumuraya and Suzumura, Eur. Phys. J. B 94, 17 (2021)], we calculate $S$ in the presence of the impurity and electron--phonon scatterings. We show that $S_x < 0$ and $S_y >0$ at high temperatures, where $S_x$ ($S_y$) denotes $S$ perpendicular (parallel) to the molecular stacking axis. There is a sign change of $S_y$ with increasing $T$. We find that, at low temperatures the absolute value of $S$ is enhanced by the spin-orbit coupling. The Seebeck coefficient is examined by dividing it into components of the conduction and valence bands; we find that the electron and hole contributions compete with each other. Such $T$ dependence of $S$ is clarified using the spectral conductivity, which determines $L_{12}$ and $L_{11}$

Title: Large Chern-Number Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect from Canted Antiferromagnetic Order in $d$-Electron System on Kagome Lattice
Authors: Waquar Ahmed, Steffen Schaeffer, Pierre Lombardo, Roland Hayn, Imam Makhfudz
Abstract: Electrons of $d$-symmetry interacting with a localized non-collinear antiferromagnetic spin order on a kagome lattice are considered. Even in the absence of an external magnetic field, spin-orbit coupling or relativistic effects, the spin texture produces a non-trivial intrinsic Berry curvature. This opens the route for a quantum anomalous Hall effect in the $d$-system. For spin orders with an out-of-plane component, the scalar spin chirality is finite, and the integration of the Berry curvature over the Brillouin zone may yield integer Hall conductivities in units of $e^2/h$. This canted configuration gives rise to the maximal possible Chern number, $C=\pm 5$ when the Fermi level is within nontrivial gap. The effect is best understood for -- but not limited to -- isotropic $d$-electron hopping and degenerate $d$-levels. In this case, analytic expressions are available and point to a topological origin for the manifestation of the maximal $C$. Numerical calculations show that these findings are robust to some anisotropy in the hopping integrals and to moderate splittings of the $d$ levels. The $C=\pm 5$ plateau can be split into Chern peaks with smaller integers by varying the onsite energies. The topological phase transition between Hall plateaus of opposite $C$ can be driven by flipping the out-of-plane component of the spin order, alluding to the potential of this system to quantum information.

Title: Dynamics of an outlier in the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble
Authors: John Mateus, Gabriel Téllez, Frédéric van Wijland
Abstract: We endow the elements of a random matrix drawn from the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble with a Dyson Brownian motion dynamics. We initialize the dynamics of the eigenvalues with all of them lumped at the origin, but one outlier. We solve the dynamics exactly which gives us a window on the dynamical scaling behavior at and around the Baik-Ben Arous-Péché transition. Amusingly, while the statics is well-known and accessible via the Hikami-Brézin integrals, our approach for the dynamics is explicitly based on the use of orthogonal polynomials.

Title: Characterizing the Structure of 3D DNA Origami in a Transmission Electron Microscope
Authors: Alyna Ong, Christoph Hadlich, Taekyu Jeong, Darius Pohl, Iman Elbalasy, Ralf Seidel, Michael Mertig, Bernd Rellinghaus
Abstract: DNA origami nanostructures provide programmable control over nanoscale geometry but remain challenging to image due to their low atomic number. Here, we systematically evaluate imaging strategies for both stained and unstained DNA origami deposited on carbon-coated TEM grids. Using Weber contrast as a quantitative metric, we compared different operating modes of (scanning) transmission electron microscopy, (S)TEM, in order to find optimum imaging conditions. STEM was consistently found to deliver the highest contrast, with optimal performance at a camera length of 600 mm towards the high angle annular dark field (HAADF) detector. As expected, the contrast was higher for the thicker three-dimensional nanotubes as compared to DNA 6-helix bundles (6HBs) due to the larger projected thickness of the former. The contrast was effectively enhanced by heavy metal staining with uranyl formate. Notably, 3D molds preserved their designated dimensions upon staining and also largely retained their structural integrity upon complexation with palladium, which also improved the visibility of the structures. These results establish STEM as the optimal approach for high-contrast imaging of DNA origami even of unstained samples and provide practical guidelines for sample preparation and imaging conditions that promote reliable structural visualization.

Title: Dark Soliton Formation as a Dark-State Phase Transition in a Dissipative Superfluid Josephson Junction Chain
Authors: Robbe Ceulemans, Samuel E. Begg, Matthew J. Davis, Michiel Wouters
Abstract: We identify and characterize a first-order dark-state phase transition between a discrete dark soliton and a uniform superfluid in a Bose-Hubbard chain with a single lossy site. Using classical-field (truncated-Wigner) simulations together with a Bogoliubov stability analysis, we show that the dark-state nature of the soliton suppresses fluctuations and shifts the critical point relative to the comparable phenomenon of optical bistability in driven-dissipative Kerr resonators. We then demonstrate that this mechanism quantitatively captures the bistability phase boundary observed in the experiment of R. Labouvie et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, 235302 (2016)], resolving substantial discrepancies in prior modeling efforts. Our results reveal how driving, dissipation and quantum coherence can interact to induce nonequilibrium phase transitions in ultra-cold atomic gases.

Title: Valley-dependent topological interface states in biased armchair nanoribbons in single-layer graphene for transport applications
Authors: Zheng-Han Huang, Jing-Yuan Lai, Yu-Shu G. Wu
Abstract: For nanoscale single-layer graphene-based devices, valley-dependent topological physics may be exploited in device design. To demonstrate the point, we investigate an electrical bias-controlled, topological kind discontinuity in valley polarization, in a two-segment armchair nanoribbon of single-layer graphene, where the discontinuity is created at the interface by applying opposite in-plane, transverse electrical biases to the two segments. In particular, using an efficient tight-binding theoretical formulation, we explicitly obtain energy eigenvalues and probability distributions of discontinuity-induced, interface-confined electron eigenstates, in a reference configuration. Moreover, implications of the confinement for electron transport are explored. A configurational variation is introduced to transform the eigenstates into transport-active, quasi-localized ones. Such states are shown to result in Fano "anti-resonances" in transmission spectra. The resilience of the quasi-localized states and their associated Fano fingerprints is presented with respect to configurational fluctuations. Last, a proof-of-concept electron energy band-stop filter is illustrated, highlighting the potential of the foregoing confinement and, more broadly, valley-dependent topological physics in designing nanoscale single-layer graphene devices.

Title: Quantum beats of exciton-polarons in CsPbI3 perovskite nanocrystals

Abstract: Exciton-phonon interactions govern the energy level spectrum and thus the optical response in semiconductors. In this respect, lead-halide perovskite nanocrystals represent a unique system, for which the interaction with optical phonons is particularly strong, giving rise to a ladder of multiple exciton states which can be optically excited with femtosecond pulses. We establish a new regime of coherent exciton-polaron dynamics with exceptionally long coherence times (T2 ~300 ps) in an ensemble of CsPbI3 nanocrystals embedded in a glass matrix. Using transient two-pulse photon echo at 2 K temperature, we observe quantum beats between the exciton-polaron states. Within a four-level model, we directly quantify the exciton-phonon coupling strength through the Huang-Rhys factors of 0.05-0.1 and 0.02-0.04 for low-energy optical phonons with energies of 3.2 and 5.1 meV, respectively. The pronounced size dependence of both coupling strengths and phonon lifetimes offers a path to tune the optical transitions between polaron states and to tailor the coherent optical dynamics in perovskite semiconductors for solid-state quantum technologies.

Title: Markov Inequality as a Tool for Linear-Scaling Estimation of Local Observables
Authors: H. P. Veiga, D. R. Pinheiro, J. P. Santos Pires, J. M. Viana Parente Lopes
Abstract: We introduce a linear-scaling stochastic method to compute real-space maps of any positive local spectral operator in a tight-binding model. By employing positive-definite estimators, the sampling error at each site can be rigorously bounded relative to the mean via the Markov inequality, overcoming the lack of self-averaging and enabling accurate estimates even under strong spatial fluctuations. The approach extends to non-diagonal observables, such as local currents, through local unitary transformations and its effectiveness is showcased by benchmark calculations in the disordered two-dimensional (2D) $\pi$-flux model, where the LDoS and steady-state current maps are computed. This method will enable simulations of disorder-driven mesoscopic phenomena in realistically large lattices and accelerate real-space self-consistent mean-field calculations.

Title: Sensitive detection of the Rydberg transition in trapped electrons on liquid helium using radio-frequency reflectometry
Authors: Jui-Yin Lin, Tomoyuki Tani, Mikhail Belianchikov, Denis Konstantinov
Abstract: Radio-frequency reflectometry, which probes small changes in the electrical impedance of a device, provides a useful method for sensitive and fast detection of dynamic processes in quantum systems. We use this method to detect excitation of the quantized motional (Rydberg) states of trapped electrons on liquid helium. The Rydberg transition in an ensemble of electrons is detected by a change in the impedance of an rf circuit coupled to the microwave-excited electrons. To elucidate the origin of the observed response, the result is compared with an independent impedance measurement on the same electron system modulated by an electrostatic potential and with a numerical simulation using the Green's function method. Additionally, it is found that the rf response to the Rydberg resonance can be strongly enhanced by a resonant mode of the electron collective motion. Our results suggest that the observed response to the Rydberg resonance must be attributed to the lateral motion of the many-electron system rather than the vertical displacement of the individually excited electrons, as was explicate earlier. A theoretical analysis of the expected response due to the vertical displacement is given.

Title: Thickness dependent rare earth segregation in magnetron deposited NdCo$_{4.6}$ thin films studied by Xray reflectivity and Hard Xray photoemission
Authors: J. Díaz, J. Rodríguez-Fernández, J. Rubio-Zuazo
Abstract: Magnetic anisotropy in disordered rare-earth-transition metals (RE-TM) compounds arises from RE atoms occupying asymmetric environments within the TM lattice. However, the underlying mechanism that promotes such environments remains not fully understood. In this study, we investigate amorphous NdCo$_{4.6}$ thin films deposited by magnetron sputtering, where the magnetic anisotropy evolves with thickness from in-plane to out-of-plane orientation above 40 nm. X-ray reflectivity measurements revealed the progressive formation of an additional layer between the 3 nm Si capping layer and the NdCo film with increasing film thickness. To probe the composition and distribution of Co and Nd near the surface, Hard X-ray Photoemission Spectroscopy (HAXPES) was performed on films ranging from 5 nm to 65 nm in thickness using incident photon energies of 7, 19, and 13 keV. These correspond to inelastic electron mean free paths of 7.2-12.3 nm in cobalt. The cobalt atomic concentration, deduced from HAXPES at the Nd 3d and Co 2p excitations, was consistently below the nominal value and varied with both thickness and photon energy. This indicates segregation of RE atoms at the film surface, which becomes more pronounced with increasing thickness. Background analysis of the Co 2p and Nd 3d peaks supports this conclusion. The thickness of the Nd segregated layer is estimated in 2-3 nm. These findings demonstrate that incorporating neodymium into the cobalt lattice incurs an energy cost which is associated with strain due to the volume mismatch between the two elements. Reducing this strain energy promotes anisotropic atomic environments for Nd, thereby explaining the emergence of perpendicular anisotropy and its dependence on film thickness in these RE-TM compounds.

Title: Immobile and mobile excitations of three-spin interactions on the diamond chain
Authors: M. Bayer, M. Vieweg, K.P. Schmidt
Abstract: We present a solvable one-dimensional spin-1/2 model on the diamond chain featuring three-spin interactions, which displays both, mobile excitations driving a second-order phase transition between an ordered and a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetry broken phase, as well as non-trivial fully immobile excitations. The model is motivated by the physics of fracton excitations, which only possess mobility in a reduced dimension compared to the full model. We provide an exact mapping of this model to an arbitrary number of independent transverse-field Ising chain segments with open boundary conditions. The number and lengths of these segments correspond directly to the number of immobile excitations and their respective distances from one another. Furthermore, we demonstrate that multiple immobile excitations exhibit Casimir-like forces between them, resulting in a non-trivial spectrum.

Title: Resonating-valence-bond superconductor from small Fermi surface in twisted bilayer graphene
Authors: Jing-Yu Zhao, Ya-Hui Zhang
Abstract: Mechanism of superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) remains one of the central problems in correlated moiré materials. The most intriguing question is about the nature of the normal state: is the Cooper pair formed from small Fermi surface or large Fermi surface? In this work we point out the possibility of a symmetric pseudogap metal with small hole pockets, dubbed as second Fermi liquid (sFL). In the sFL phase at $\nu=-2-x$, there is a two-component picture: two electrons mainly localize at each AA site and form a paired singlet due to anti-Hund's coupling mediated by the optical phonon, while additional holes doped into the AA sites form small Fermi surfaces. The sFL phase corresponds to an intrinsically strongly interacting fixed point and is topologically distinct to the conventional Fermi liquid. We develop a unified framework to describe both a renormalized FL phase and an sFL phase. We propose that the TBG superconductor emerges from the sFL phase, but is close to the transition toward the FL phase under increasing hole doping. In the superconductor, pairing of local moments is shared to the mobile carriers and a smaller superconducting gap with nodal $p_x$ symmetry is opened on the small hole pockets. This work provides, to our knowledge, the first unified theory that explains both the pseudogap metal above $T_c$ and the two-gap nematic superconductivity below it.

Title: Competitive Orders in Altermagnetic Chiral Magnons
Authors: Congzhe Yan, Jinyang Ni
Abstract: The magnons in altermagnets exhibit chiral splitting even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling and external magnetic fields. Typically, this chiral splitting behavior can be well described by alternating isotropic spin exchanges (ISE) near the zero temperature. However, its finite-temperature dynamics, particularly when incorporating spin-orbit coupling effects, remains elusive. In this study, we reveal that, when including magnon-magnon interactions, long-range anisotropic spin exchange (ASE) can also induce chiral splitting of magnons at a finite temperature. Crucially, the chiral splitting induced by ASE competes with that arising from ISE, leading to a pronounced temperature-dependent modulation of the altermagnetic chiral splitting. Moreover, this competition is intimately connected to spin fluctuations, and can reverse the spin current driven by the band splitting as temperature increases. Our work uncovers the intrinsic competition governing collective spin excitations in altermagnets, providing new insights into their finite-temperature dynamical behavior.

Title: High-quality nanostructured diamond membranes for nanoscale quantum sensing
Authors: Alexander Pakpour Tabrizi, Artur Lozovoi, Sean Karg, Tecla Bottinelli Mondandon, Melody Leung, Kai-Hung Cheng, Nathalie P. de Leon
Abstract: Deploying nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond as nanoscale quantum sensors for condensed matter and materials physics requires placing the NV centers close to the sensing target. One solution is to fabricate diamond nanostructures and integrate them with materials and devices. However, diamond etching and ion milling can introduce subsurface damage and surface defects that degrade the charge stability and spin coherence of NV centers near the surface. Here we report a procedure for fabricating low-damage nanostructured diamond membranes, and we show that this fabrication scheme preserves the optical and spin properties of state-of-the-art shallow NV center quantum sensors, within nanometers of the diamond surface, while providing significant photonic enhancement. Furthermore, we demonstrate a pick-and-place transfer method, which enables integration with diverse sensing targets.

Title: Evidence for spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry at a non-conformal quantum critical point in one dimension
Authors: R. Flores-Calderón, M. Zündel
Abstract: In this work, we present evidence for the spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry in a nearest-neighbour interacting spin-1 chain tuned to a quantum critical point at $T=0$ between two XY quasi-long-range order phases differing by the spontaneous breaking of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. Despite the one-dimensional nature of the system, which typically prevents such a continuous symmetry breaking due to the Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner theorem, the presence of a Berry phase term in the quantum model allows us to observe, using matrix product state methods, a finite perpendicular magnetization. Moreover, the quasi-long-range decay of the correlation function becomes truly long-range order, and the dynamical structure factor displays a characteristic Bragg peak together with sharp gapless modes. Our results imply the quantum phase transition has an anomalous dimension of $\eta \simeq 1$ together with the dynamical critical exponent $z\simeq 3/2$, known from the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class in one dimension. We perform a perturbative renormalization group calculation about the upper critical dimension $d_c=2$ that we could close at second loop order. We find an interacting fixed point with critical exponents distinct from the Ising ones. Together, our findings suggest the nature of the fixed point to be non-perturbative. We propose a field-theory that we believe to improve the quantitative results.

Title: Time-Dependent Oxidation and Scale Evolution of a Wrought Co/Ni-based Superalloy
Authors: Cameron. Crabb, Zachary. T. Kloenne, Samuel. R. Rogers, Chi-Hang. D. Kwok, Mark. C. Hardy, Michelle. S. Conroy, David. Dye
Abstract: Understanding how protective oxide scales evolve over time is necessary for improving the long term resistance of superalloys. This work investigates the time-dependent oxidation behavior of an ingot-processable Co/Ni-based superalloy oxidized in air at $800~^\circ\mathrm{C}$ for $20$, $100$, and $1000~\mathrm{h}$ . Mass-gain and white-light interferometry measurements quantified oxidation kinetics, surface roughness, and spallation, while high-resolution STEM-EDX characterized oxide morphology and nanoscale elemental partitioning. Atom probe tomography captured the key transition regions between the chromia and alumina scales, and X-ray diffraction was used to identify a gradual transition from NiO and (Ni,Co)-spinel phases to a compact, dual phase chromia and alumina-rich scale. The oxidation rate evolved from near-linear to parabolic behavior with time, consistent with diffusion-controlled growth once a continuous Cr$_2$O$_3$/$\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ scale formed. These observations help link kinetics, structure and chemistry, showing how an originally porous spinel layer transforms into a dense, adherent chromia + alumina scale that provides long-term protection in wrought Co/Ni-based superalloys.

Title: Probing critical phenomena in open quantum systems using atom arrays
Authors: Fang Fang, Kenneth Wang, Vincent S. Liu, Yu Wang, Ryan Cimmino, Julia Wei, Marcus Bintz, Avery Parr, Jack Kemp, Kang-Kuen Ni, Norman Y. Yao
Abstract: At continuous phase transitions, quantum many-body systems exhibit scale-invariance and complex, emergent universal behavior. Most strikingly, at a quantum critical point, correlations decay as a power law, with exponents determined by a set of universal scaling dimensions. Experimentally probing such power-law correlations is extremely challenging, owing to the complex interplay between decoherence, the vanishing energy gap, and boundary effects. Here, we employ a Rydberg quantum simulator to adiabatically prepare critical ground states of both a one-dimensional ring and a two-dimensional square lattice. By accounting for and tuning the openness of our quantum system, which is well-captured by the introduction of a single phenomenological length scale, we are able to directly observe power-law correlations and extract the corresponding scaling dimensions. Moreover, in two dimensions, we observe a decoupling between phase transitions in the bulk and on the boundary, allowing us to identify two distinct boundary universality classes. Our work demonstrates that direct adiabatic preparation of critical states in quantum simulators can complement recent approaches to studying quantum criticality using the Kibble-Zurek mechanism or digital quantum circuits.

Title: Quantum thermalization must occur in translation-invariant systems at high temperature
Authors: Saúl Pilatowsky-Cameo, Soonwon Choi
Abstract: Quantum thermalization describes how closed quantum systems can effectively reach thermal equilibrium, resolving the apparent incongruity between the reversibility of Schrödinger's equation and the second law of thermodynamics. Despite its ubiquity and conceptual significance, the precise conditions that give rise to quantum thermalization are still not well understood. After nearly a century of efforts, we have yet to find a complete mathematical proof that an effective statistical description naturally emerges the underlying quantum dynamics in generic settings. Here, we prove that quantum thermalization must occur in any qubit system with local interactions under three conditions: (i) high effective temperature, (ii) translation invariance, and (iii) no perfect resonances in the energy spectrum. Specifically, we show that a typical, low-complexity pure state drawn from any ensemble with large entropy and well-defined effective temperature becomes locally indistinguishable from a Gibbs state upon unitary evolution. In this setting, our rigorous results prove the widely anticipated notion that statistical physics should be understood as an emergent phenomenon, explicitly derived from the first principles of quantum mechanics.

Title: Boosting thermalization of classical and quantum many-body systems
Authors: Jin-Fu Chen, Kshiti Sneh Rai, Patrick Emonts, Donato Farina, Marcin Płodzień, Przemyslaw Grzybowski, Maciej Lewenstein, Jordi Tura
Abstract: Understanding and optimizing the relaxation dynamics of many-body systems is essential both for foundational studies in quantum thermodynamics and for applications such as quantum simulation and quantum computing. Efficient preparation of thermal states of a many-body Hamiltonian is governed by the spectral properties of the associated Lindbladian, in particular its spectral gap, which determines the slowest relaxation rate. In this work, we develop a systematic framework for constructing Lindbladians that prepare thermal states. Our approach reveals a simple relation between the relaxation dynamics at finite and infinite temperatures. The framework is scalable to larger system sizes when implemented using tensor-network methods. We find that efficient thermalization requires that the relaxation dynamics respect the symmetries of the thermal state, which reduces the number of free parameters. By applying gradient-based optimization to the Lindbladians, we enhance the spectral gap and thereby boost thermalization. When applied to both classical and quantum spin models, our method demonstrates a substantial enhancement of the spectral gap. For larger system sizes, our approach provides a variational upper bound and enables a certified lower bound on the minimum relaxation rate.

Title: A universal framework for the quantum simulation of Yang-Mills theory
Authors: Jad C. Halimeh, Masanori Hanada, Shunji Matsuura, Franco Nori, Enrico Rinaldi, Andreas Schäfer
Abstract: We provide a universal framework for the quantum simulation of SU(N) Yang--Mills theories on fault-tolerant digital quantum computers adopting the orbifold lattice formulation. As warm-up examples, we also consider simple models, including scalar field theory and the Yang--Mills matrix model, to illustrate the universality of our formulation, which shows up in the fact that the truncated Hamiltonian can be expressed in the same simple form for any N, any dimension, and any lattice size, in stark contrast to the popular approach based on the Kogut--Susskind formulation. In all these cases, the truncated Hamiltonian can be programmed on a quantum computer using only standard tools well-established in the field of quantum computation. As a concrete application of this universal framework, we consider Hamiltonian time evolution by Suzuki--Trotter decomposition. This turns out to be a straightforward task due to the simplicity of the truncated Hamiltonian. We also provide a simple circuit structure that contains only CNOT and one-qubit gates, independent of the details of the theory investigated.

Title: Energy injection in an epithelial cell monolayer indicated by negative viscosity
Authors: Molly McCord, Jacob Notbohm
Abstract: Epithelial tissues are driven out of thermodynamic equilibrium by internally generated forces, causing complex patterns of motion. Even when both the forces and motion are measurable, it is not yet possible to relate the two, because the sources of energy injection and dissipation are often unclear. Here, we study how energy is transferred by developing a method to measure the effective viscosity from the shear stresses and strain rates within an epithelial cell monolayer. Interestingly, there emerged multicellular regions in which the relationship between shear stress and shear strain rate was negatively proportional, indicating a negative effective viscosity. The negative effective viscosity occurred in regions wherein cell stresses were less efficient at producing tissue deformations compared to regions of positive effective viscosity. Regions of negative effective viscosity consistently exhibited greater cell speed and vorticity, and the cells had elevated metabolic activity, reflecting an increased energy demand in these cells. Our study shows that negative effective viscosity is a useful means of quantifying the flow of energy in living matter.

Title: Momentum coupling of classical atoms
Authors: Andras Suto
Abstract: A new method, dual-space cluster expansion, is proposed to study classical phases transitions in the continuum. It relies on replacing the particle positions as integration variables by the momenta of the relative displacements of particle pairs. Due to the requirement that the particles must be static, coupling via the momenta partitions the set of particles into a set of clusters, and transforms the partition function into a sum over the different cluster decompositions. This allows us to derive a formula for the density that finite clusters can carry in the infinite system. In a simplified example, we then demonstrate that in two and higher dimensions this density has a threshold, beyond which the particles form infinite clusters. The transition is accompanied by a singularity in the free energy. We also show that infinite clusters are always present in condensed phases, most likely submacroscopic in liquids and macroscopic in crystals.

Title: Entropic costs of extracting classical ticks from a quantum clock

Abstract: We experimentally realize a quantum clock by using a charge sensor to count charges tunneling through a double quantum dot (DQD). Individual tunneling events are used as the clock's ticks. We quantify the clock's precision while measuring the power dissipated by the DQD and, separately, the charge sensor in both direct-current and radio-frequency readout modes. This allows us to probe the thermodynamic cost of creating ticks microscopically and recording them macroscopically. Our experiment is the first to explore the interplay between the entropy produced by a microscopic clockwork and its macroscopic measurement apparatus. We show that the latter contribution not only dwarfs the former but also unlocks greatly increased precision, because the measurement record can be exploited to optimally estimate time even when the DQD is at equilibrium. Our results suggest that the entropy produced by the amplification and measurement of a clock's ticks, which has often been ignored in the literature, is the most important and fundamental thermodynamic cost of timekeeping at the quantum scale.

Title: Dynamical cluster-based strategy for improving tensor network algorithms in quantum circuit simulations
Authors: Andrea De Girolamo, Paolo Facchi, Peter Rabl, Saverio Pascazio, Cosmo Lupo, Giuseppe Magnifico
Abstract: We optimize matrix-product state-based algorithms for simulating quantum circuits with finite fidelity, specifically the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) and the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithms, by exploiting the irregular arrangement of entangling operations in circuits. We introduce a variation of the standard TEBD algorithm, we termed "cluster-TEBD", which dynamically arranges qubits into entanglement clusters, enabling the exact contraction of multiple circuit layers in a single time step. Moreover, we enhance the DMRG algorithm by introducing an adaptive protocol, which analyzes the entanglement distribution within each circuit section to be contracted, dynamically adjusting the qubit grouping at each iteration. We analyze the performances of these enhanced algorithms in simulating both stabilizer and nonstabilizer random-structured quantum circuits, with up to 1000 qubits and 100 layers of Clifford and non-Clifford gates, and in simulating Shor's quantum algorithm with up to hundreds of thousands of layers. Our findings show that, even with reasonable computational resources per task, cluster-based approaches can significantly speed up simulations of large-sized quantum circuits and improve the fidelity of the final states.

Title: Quantum complexity in gravity, quantum field theory, and quantum information science
Authors: Stefano Baiguera, Vijay Balasubramanian, Pawel Caputa, Shira Chapman, Jonas Haferkamp, Michal P. Heller, Nicole Yunger Halpern
Abstract: Quantum complexity quantifies the difficulty of preparing a state or implementing a unitary transformation with limited resources. Applications range from quantum computation to condensed matter physics and quantum gravity. We seek to bridge the approaches of these fields, which define and study complexity using different frameworks and tools. We describe several definitions of complexity, along with their key properties. In quantum information theory, we focus on complexity growth in random quantum circuits. In quantum many-body systems and quantum field theory (QFT), we discuss a geometric definition of complexity in terms of geodesics on the unitary group. In dynamical systems, we explore a definition of complexity in terms of state or operator spreading, as well as concepts from tensor-networks. We also outline applications to simple quantum systems, quantum many-body models, and QFTs including conformal field theories (CFTs). Finally, we explain the proposed relationship between complexity and gravitational observables within the holographic anti-de Sitter (AdS)/CFT correspondence.

Title: ScarFinder: a detector of optimal scar trajectories in quantum many-body dynamics
Authors: Jie Ren, Andrew Hallam, Lei Ying, Zlatko Papić
Abstract: Mechanisms that give rise to coherent quantum dynamics, such as quantum many-body scars, have recently attracted much interest as a way of controlling quantum chaos. However, identifying the presence of quantum scars in general many-body Hamiltonians remains an outstanding challenge. Here we introduce ScarFinder, a variational framework that reveals possible scar-like dynamics without prior knowledge of scar states or their algebraic structure. By iteratively evolving and projecting states within a low-entanglement variational manifold, ScarFinder isolates scarred trajectories by suppressing thermal contributions. We validate the method on the analytically tractable spin-1 XY model, recovering the known scar dynamics, as well as the mixed field Ising model, where we capture and generalize the initial conditions previously associated with ``weak thermalization''. We then apply the method to the PXP model of Rydberg atom arrays, efficiently characterizing its mixed phase space and finding a previously unknown trajectory with nearly-perfect revival dynamics in the thermodynamic limit. Our results establish ScarFinder as a powerful, model-agnostic tool for identifying and optimizing coherent dynamics in quantum many-body systems.

Title: Axion-mediated photon-to-photon transitions in high finesse dielectric resonators
Authors: Evangelos Almpanis
Abstract: Axions are hypothetical particles that could address both the strong charge-parity problem in quantum chromodynamics and the enigmatic nature of dark matter. However, if axions exist, their mass remains unknown, and they are expected to interact very weakly with the electromagnetic field, which explains why they have not been detected yet. This study proposes a way to substantially augment the axion-photon interaction by confining the photons within high-quality-factor dielectric resonators, increasing their intensity and lifetime, and thus the possibility of interacting with axions in the background. In view of this, we study resonant axion-mediated photonic transitions in millimeter-sized spherical dielectric resonators, based on fully analytical calculations to the first order in perturbation theory. Such resonators exhibit high lifetime Mie resonances in the microwave part of the spectrum, with a separation that can be tailored with the radius of the sphere to match the expected axion frequency, allowing axion-mediated photonic transitions when particular selection rules are fulfilled. We predict experimentally accessible axion mass regimes where such triply resonant transitions can be realized with standard dielectric resonators. We propose an experiment for probing such interactions named DARK-ROSE.

Title: Associative Memory and Generative Diffusion in the Zero-noise Limit
Authors: Joshua Hess, Quaid Morris
Abstract: This paper shows that generative diffusion processes converge to associative memory systems at vanishing noise levels and characterizes the stability, robustness, memorization, and generation dynamics of both model classes. Morse-Smale dynamical systems are shown to be universal approximators of associative memory models, with diffusion processes as their white-noise perturbations. The universal properties of associative memory that follow are used to characterize a generic transition from generation to memory as noise diminishes. Structural stability of Morse-Smale flows -- that is, the robustness of their global critical point structure -- implies the stability of both trajectories and invariant measures for diffusions in the zero-noise limit. The learning and generation landscapes of these models appear as parameterized families of gradient flows and their stochastic perturbations, and the bifurcation theory for Morse-Smale systems implies that they are generically stable except at isolated parameter values, where enumerable sets of local and global bifurcations govern transitions between stable systems in parameter space. These landscapes are thus characterized by ordered bifurcation sequences that create, destroy, or alter connections between rest points and are robust under small stochastic or deterministic perturbations. The framework is agnostic to model formulation, which we verify with examples from energy-based models, denoising diffusion models, and classical and modern Hopfield networks. We additionally derive structural stability criteria for Hopfield-type networks and find that simple cases violate them. Collectively, our geometric approach provides insight into the classification, stability, and emergence of memory and generative landscapes.

Title: TasVisAn and InsPy -- Python Packages for Triple-Axis Spectrometer Data Visualization, Analysis, Instrument Resolution Calculation, and Convolution
Authors: Guochu Deng, Garry J. McIntyre
Abstract: Experimental data collected from a triple-axis spectrometer (TAS) are typically analysed by considering the instrument resolution, as the resolution of a TAS instrument is often complex and significantly influences the measured results. Two Python packages, TasVisAn and InsPy, have been developed to visualize and analyse data from TAS instruments - particularly from the cold-neutron TAS Sika and the thermal-neutron TAS Taipan at the Australian Centre for Neutron Scattering. TasVisAn offers a range of functions, including data importing, reduction, plotting, contour mapping, convolution fitting, and more, for data collected on TAS instruments, especially on Sika and Taipan. It also supports data reduction of the current trendy multi-analyser and multiplexing TAS instruments, including the multiplexing mode of Sika. Besides, it includes scan simulation and batch file validation tools for both Taipan and Sika, assisting users in designing and planning experiments in advance. InsPy is a general-purpose Python package designed to calculate the four-dimensional (4D) instrument resolution in momentum-energy space for any TAS instrument. Combined with InsPy, TasVisAn supports both instrument resolution calculation and resolution-convoluted data fitting. Its flexible external data import feature further allows TasVisAn to be adapted for the visualization and convolution analysis of inelastic neutron scattering data across various TAS instruments.

Title: Linear Resistivity from Spatially Random Interactions and the Uniqueness of Yukawa Coupling
Authors: Sang-Jin Sin, Yi-Li Wang
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that a spatially random Yukawa-type interaction between a Fermi surface and critical bosons can produce linear-in-temperature resistivity, the defining signature of strange metals. In this article, we systematically classify all scalar couplings of the form $(\psi^{\dagger}\psi)^n\phi^m$ in arbitrary dimensions to identify possible candidates for strange-metal behaviour within this disordered framework. We find that only spatially random Yukawa-type interaction in $(2+1)$ dimensions can yield linear resistivity.

Title: Transport-Induced Decoherence of the Entangled Triplet Exciton Pair
Authors: Gerald Curran III, Luke J. Weaver, Zachary Rex, Ivan Biaggio
Abstract: Decoherence effects for entangled triplet pairs in organic molecular crystals are analyzed for the case when excitons can hop between inequivalent lattice sites. The fluorescence quantum beats caused by quantum interference upon triplet-triplet recombination into an emissive singlet state are predicted as a function of hopping time and magnetic field based on a Monte Carlo analysis. Depending on exciton hopping rates, it is possible to have complete global decoherence and suppression of fluorescence quantum beats in the limit of zero magnetic field, and to have quantum beats that decay at different rates depending on magnetic field strength.

Title: Nitrogen-Vacancy Emission from Nanodiamond: Size, Depth, and Surroundings
Authors: Harini Hapuarachchi, Francesco Campaioli, Jared H Cole, Andrew D Greentree, Qiang Sun
Abstract: The negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is a leading solid-state quantum emitter, offering spin-photon interfaces over a wide temperature range with applications from electromagnetic sensing to bioimaging. While NV centers in bulk diamond are well understood, embedding them in nanodiamond (ND) introduces complexities from size, NV location, and NV polarizations. NVs in ND show altered fluorescence properties including longer lifetimes, lower quantum efficiency, and higher sensitivity to dielectric surroundings, which arise from radiative suppression, surface-induced non-radiative decay, and escape inefficiency at the diamond-background interface. Prior models typically addressed isolated aspects, such as dielectric contrast or surface quenching, without integrating full quantum-optical NV behavior with classical electrodynamics. We present a hybrid framework coupling rigorous electromagnetic simulations with a quantum-optical NV model including phonon sideband dynamics. NV emission is found to depend strongly on ND size, NV position, and surrounding refractive index. Our results explain observations such as shallow NVs in water-coated ND appearing brighter than deeper ones in air. This integrated model provide a unified framework for realistic NV in ND emission scenarios and informs the design of efficient NV-based sensors and quantum devices, advancing understanding of quantum emitter photophysics in nanoscale crystals.

Title: Identify and Quantify Various Dissipation Mechanisms of Josephson Junction in Superconducting Circuits
Authors: Hao Deng, Huijuan Zhan, Lijuan Hu, Hui-Hai Zhao, Ran Gao, Kannan Lu, Xizheng Ma, Zhijun Song, Fei Wang, Tenghui Wang, Feng Wu, Tian Xia, Gengyan Zhang, Xiaohang Zhang, Chunqing Deng
Abstract: Pinpointing the dissipation mechanisms and evaluating their impacts to the performance of Josephson junction (JJ) are crucial for its application in superconducting circuits. In this work, we demonstrate the junction-embedded resonator (JER) as a platform which enables us to identify and quantify various dissipation mechanisms of JJ. JER is constructed by embedding JJ in the middle of an open-circuit, 1/2 {\lambda} transmission-line resonator. When the 1st and 2nd harmonics of JER are excited, JJ experiences different boundary conditions, and is dominated by internal and external dissipations, respectively. We systematically study these 2 dissipation mechanisms of JJ by varying the JJ area and number. Our results unveil the completely different behaviors of these 2 dissipation mechanisms, and quantitatively characterize their contributions, shedding a light on the direction of JJ optimization in various applications.

Title: Chemical and Conformational Control of the Spectroscopic Properties of Multi-Layer and Multi-Defect Carbon Dots
Authors: Arshad Mehmood, Caitlin V. Hetherington, Zain Zaidi, Benjamin G. Levine
Abstract: Carbon dots (CDs) are renowned for their bright and tunable photoluminescence (PL), stability, and biocompatibility, yet it remains challenging to link their heterogeneous structures to their spectroscopic properties. This study utilizes density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) to systematically investigate how the spectroscopic properties of complex CDs with multiple layers and multiple defects are determined by their structures and compositions. Calculations reveal that strongly oxidizing defects, such as carbonyl and carbonyl acetate, significantly redshift absorption and emission spectra. In contrast, less oxidizing defects, such as hydroxyl, behave as spectators with minimal impact on absorption and emission, except when they interact strongly with more oxidizing defects. We find that not only the excitation energy but also the excitation character itself is impacted by the presence of specific defects, and the pH-dependence of the spectroscopic properties can be attributed to their protonation state-dependent excitation character. We show that the twisting, sliding, and linker-mediated folding of surface-functionalized layers in CDs markedly alter excitation energies and characters, offering a molecular explanation for experimentally observed emission intermittency and polarization fluctuations. These insights provide strategies for optimizing CDs for various applications, including bioimaging, photocatalysis, and optoelectronic devices.

Title: Neutron Reflectometry by Gradient Descent
Authors: Max D. Champneys, Andrew J. Parnell, Philipp Gutfreund, Maximilian W. A. Skoda, . Patrick A. Fairclough, Timothy J. Rogers, Stephanie L. Burg
Abstract: Neutron reflectometry (NR) is a powerful technique to probe surfaces and interfaces. NR is inherently an indirect measurement technique, access to the physical quantities of interest (layer thickness, scattering length density, roughness), necessitate the solution of an inverse modelling problem, that is inefficient for large amounts of data or complex multiplayer structures (e.g. lithium batteries / electrodes). Recently, surrogate machine learning models have been proposed as an alternative to existing optimisation routines. Although such approaches have been successful, physical intuition is lost when replacing governing equations with fast neural networks. Instead, we propose a novel and efficient approach; to optimise reflectivity data analysis by performing gradient descent on the forward reflection model itself. Herein, automatic differentiation techniques are used to evaluate exact gradients of the error function with respect to the parameters of interest. Access to these quantities enables users of neutron reflectometry to harness a host of powerful modern optimisation and inference techniques that remain thus far unexploited in the context of neutron reflectometry. This paper presents two benchmark case studies; demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on a thick oxide quartz film, and robust co-fitting performance in the high complexity regime of organic LED multilayer devices. Additionally, we provide an open-source library of differentiable reflectometry kernels in the python programming language so that gradient based approaches can readily be applied to other NR datasets.

Title: Privacy in Distributed Quantum Sensing with Gaussian Quantum Networks
Authors: Uesli Alushi, Roberto Di Candia
Abstract: We study the privacy properties of distributed quantum sensing protocols in a Gaussian quantum network, where each node encodes a parameter via a local phase shift. For networks with more than two nodes, achieving perfect privacy is possible only asymptotically, in the limit of large photon numbers. However, we show that optimized fully symmetric Gaussian states enable improved privacy levels while maintaining near-optimal sensing performance. We show that local homodyne detection achieves a quadratic scaling of precision with the total number of photons. We further analyze the impact of thermal noise in the preparation stage on both privacy and estimation precision. Our results pave the way for the development of practical, private distributed quantum sensing protocols in continuous-variable quantum networks.

Title: Predicting the distribution of yield-stress fluids in branched pipe manifolds
Authors: Elliott Sutton, Waldo Rosales Trujillo, Adam Kowalski, Cláudio P. Fonte, Anne Juel
Abstract: We develop a one-dimensional network model to predict the steady-state distribution of yield-stress fluids in branched pipe manifolds under wall-slip conditions. The model accounts for major friction losses between junctions and incorporates wall slip through a power-law relation calibrated independently via capillary rheometry. Predictions from the model are validated against both bench-scale experiments and fully resolved computational fluid dynamics simulations, showing excellent agreement across a range of flow conditions. Our results demonstrate that wall slip strongly influences the uniformity of fluid distribution by modifying the relative resistance between outlet branches. Furthermore, we show that the problem can be inverted: measured distribution profiles can be used to estimate slip parameters, offering a practical method for slip characterisation without pressure measurement. This modelling framework is computationally inexpensive, robust, and adaptable to various network configurations, making it a valuable tool for the design and analysis of industrial manifold systems involving viscoplastic fluids.

Title: Adaptive Pruning for Increased Robustness and Reduced Computational Overhead in Gaussian Process Accelerated Saddle Point Searches
Authors: Rohit Goswami (1), Hannes Jónsson (1) ((1) Science Institute and Faculty of Physical Sciences, University of Iceland, Reykjavík, Iceland)
Abstract: Gaussian process (GP) regression provides a strategy for accelerating saddle point searches on high-dimensional energy surfaces by reducing the number of times the energy and its derivatives with respect to atomic coordinates need to be evaluated. The computational overhead in the hyperparameter optimization can, however, be large and make the approach inefficient. Failures can also occur if the search ventures too far into regions that are not represented well enough by the GP model. Here, these challenges are resolved by using geometry-aware optimal transport measures and an active pruning strategy using a summation over Wasserstein-1 distances for each atom-type in farthest-point sampling, selecting a fixed-size subset of geometrically diverse configurations to avoid rapidly increasing cost of GP updates as more observations are made. Stability is enhanced by permutation-invariant metric that provides a reliable trust radius for early-stopping and a logarithmic barrier penalty for the growth of the signal variance. These physically motivated algorithmic changes prove their efficacy by reducing to less than a half the mean computational time on a set of 238 challenging configurations from a previously published data set of chemical reactions. With these improvements, the GP approach is established as, a robust and scalable algorithm for accelerating saddle point searches when the evaluation of the energy and atomic forces requires significant computational effort.

Title: Optimal parallelisation strategies for flat histogram Monte Carlo sampling
Authors: Hubert J. Naguszewski, Christopher D. Woodgate, David Quigley
Abstract: Flat histogram methods, such as Wang-Landau sampling, provide a means for high-throughput calculation of phase diagrams of atomistic/lattice model systems. Many parallelisation schemes with varying degrees of complexity have been proposed to accelerate such sampling simulations. In this study, several widely used schemes are benchmarked - both in isolation and in combination - to establish best practice. The schemes studied include energy domain decomposition with both static sizing of energy sub-domains, as well as a dynamic sub-domain sizing scheme which we propose. We also assess the benefits both of replica exchange and of including multiple random walkers per sub-domain, to determine which factors have the largest impact on parallel efficiency. Additionally, the influence of energy sub-domain overlap regions is discussed. As an illustrative test case, we implement and apply the aforementioned strategies to a lattice-based model describing the internal energies of the AlTiCrMo refractory high-entropy superalloy, which is understood to crystallographically order into a B2 (CsCl) structure with decreasing temperature. We find that - while all of the proposed strategies confer a non-negligible speedup - parallelisation across energy domains which are non-uniform in size offers the most appreciable performance improvements. This work offers concrete recommendations for which parallelisation strategies should be prioritised to optimally accelerate flat-histogram Monte Carlo simulations.

Title: Average Winding Number for Determinantal Curves associated with 2-Matrix Models in the Class AIII
Authors: Mathieu Yahiaoui, Mario Kieburg
Abstract: To classify one-dimensional disordered quantum systems with chiral symmetry, we analyse the winding number of the determinant of a parametrized non-Hermitian random matrix field over the unit circle modelling the off-diagonal block of a disordered chiral Hamiltonian. The associated partition function is computed explicitly for a broad class of additive two-matrix models extending beyond the Ginibre Unitary Ensemble. In the large-dimension limit, we derive an asymptotic expansion of the average winding number whose leading term exhibits universal features, up to the tail behaviour of the underlying random matrix ensemble, and identify a new correction term absent in the previously studied Ginibre case.

Title: Silicon-photonic optomechanical magnetometer
Authors: Fernando Gottardo, Benjamin J. Carey, Nathaniel Bawden, Glen I. Harris, Hamish Greenall, Erick Romero, Douglas Bulla, James S. Bennett, Scott Foster, Warwick P. Bowen
Abstract: Optomechanical sensors enable exquisitely sensitive force measurements, with emerging applications across quantum technologies, standards, fundamental science, and engineering. Magnetometry is among the most promising applications, where chip-scale optomechanical sensors offer high sensitivity without the cryogenics or magnetic shielding required by competing technologies. However, lack of compatibility with integrated photonics and electronics has posed a major barrier. Here we introduce silicon-on-insulator optomechanical magnetometers to address this barrier. A new post-release lithography process enables high-quality metallisation of released mechanical structures, overcoming the incompatibility between silicon-on-insulator fabrication and functional magnetic films. This allows us to employ photonic-crystal cavities that enhance motion-to-optical signal transduction by over an order of magnitude. The resulting devices achieve magnetic field sensitivity of 800 pT Hz^-1/2, three orders of magnitude beyond previous waveguide-integrated designs. The advances we report provide a path towards high-performance, room temperature and chip-integrated magnetometers for applications ranging from biomedical imaging and navigation to resource exploration.

Title: Quantum Symmetry and Geometry in Double-Scaled SYK
Authors: Jeremy van der Heijden, Erik Verlinde, Jiuci Xu
Abstract: The emergence of the quantum $R$-matrix in the double-scaled SYK model points to an underlying quantum group structure. In this work, we identify the quantum group $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{su}(1,1))$ as a subalgebra of the chord algebra. Specifically, we construct the generators of $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{s} \mathfrak{u}(1,1))$ from combinations of operators within the chord algebra and show that the one-particle chord Hilbert space decomposes into the positive discrete series representations of $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{s} \mathfrak{u}(1,1))$. Using the coproduct structure of the quantum group, we build the multi-particle Hilbert space and establish its equivalence with previous results defined by the chord rules. In particular, we show that the quantum $R$-matrix acts as a swapping operator that reverses the ordering of open chords in each fusion channel while incorporating the corresponding $q$-weighted penalty factors. This action enables an explicit derivation of the chord Yang-Baxter relation. We further explore a realization of the quantum group generators on the quantum disk, and present a novel factorization formula for the bulk gravitational wavefunction in the presence of matter. We further discuss the relation between the $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{s} \mathfrak{u}(1,1))$ structure uncovered here and the $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{s} \mathfrak{l}(2, \mathbb{R}))$ algebra previously studied from the boundary perspective. Finally, we study the gravitational wavefunction with matter in the Schwarzian regime.
