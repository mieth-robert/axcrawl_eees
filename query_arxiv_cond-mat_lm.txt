Title: Superconducting LaPtH$_{ 6 }$ with triatomic hydrogen units
Authors: T. Ishikawa, Y. Tanaka, S. Tsuneyuki
Abstract: To veryfy "hot supreconductivity" recently proposed in lanthanum hydride-based compounds, we explored thermodynamically stable and superconducting phases in the lanthanum (La)-platinum (Pt)-hydrogen (H) ternary system at 20 GPa using an evolutionary construction scheme of a formation-enthalpy convex hull, universal neural network potential calculations, and density functional theory calculations. Although we found no evidence of the hot superconductivity in this ternary system, we predicted a unique compound, LaPtH$_{ 6 }$, which has equilateral triangular H$_{ 3 }$ units nearly forming a two-dimensional kagome lattice between La and Pt layers and shows the superconductivity at 18.67 K. This structure is dynamically stable from ambient pressure to at least 200 GPa and the superconducting critical temperature increases from 13.51 to 40.63 K.

Title: Distinguishing thermal fluctuations from polaron formation in halide perovskites

Van de Walle (2), Xie Zhang (1) ((1) School of Materials Science and Engineering, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China (2) Materials Department, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA (3) Sustainable Energy and Environment Thrust, Function Hub, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), Guangzhou, China)
Abstract: Recent angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements of the hole effective mass in CsPbBr$_3$ revealed an enhancement of $\sim$50 % compared to the bare mass computed from first principles for CsPbBr$_3$ at $T = 0 K$. This large enhancement was interpreted as evidence of polaron formation. Employing accurate finite-temperature first-principles calculations, we show that the calculated hole effective mass of CsPbBr$_3$ at $T = 300 K$ can explain experimental results without invoking polarons. Thermal fluctuations are particularly strong in halide perovskites compared to conventional semiconductors such as Si and GaAs, and cannot be ignored when comparing with experiment. We not only resolve the debate on polaron formation in halide perovskites, but also demonstrate the general importance of including thermal fluctuations in first-principles calculations for strongly anharmonic materials.

Title: On the Entire Structure of the Energy Bands of 1D Moiré Superchain
Authors: Dmitrii Vorobev, Stom (Yiheng)Chen, Grigory M. Tarnopolsky
Abstract: We consider a general model of two atomic chains forming a moiré pattern due to a small mismatch in their lattice spacings, given by $\theta = (a_{1} - a_{2})/a_{2}$. Assuming arbitrary single-band dispersion relations $\varepsilon_{1}(p)$ and $\varepsilon_{2}(q)$ for the chains, along with an arbitrary inter-chain coupling term $T(x)$, we show that the entire spectrum of such a one-dimensional moiré superchain is governed by a single three-term recurrence (TTR) relation. We analyze this TTR relation using the discrete WKB method and demonstrate how the entire structure of the spectrum as well as emergence of flat bands can be easily identified from a pair of upper and lower potential functions of the TTR relation. We also comment on the chiral limit of the moiré superchain, which can be viewed, in some sense, as a 1D analog of the chiral limit of Twisted Bilayer Graphene.

Title: Effect of disorder and strain on the operation of planar Ge hole spin qubits
Authors: Abhikbrata Sarkar, Pratik Chowdhury, Xuedong Hu, Andre Saraiva, A. S. Dzurak, A. R. Hamilton, Rajib Rahman, S. Das Sarma, Dimitrie Culcer
Abstract: Germanium quantum dots in strained $\text{Ge}/\text{Si}_{1-x}\text{Ge}_{x}$ heterostructures exhibit fast and coherent hole qubit control in experiments. In this work, we theoretically and numerically address the effects of random alloy disorder and gate-induced strain on the operation of planar Ge hole spin qubits. Electrical operation of hole quantum dot spin qubits is enabled by the strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) originating from the intrinsic SOC in the Ge valence band as well as from the structural inversion asymmetry inherent in the underlying 2D hole gas. We use the atomistic valence force field (VFF) method to compute the strain due to random alloy disorder, and thermal expansion models in COMSOL Multiphysics to obtain the strain from a realistic gate-stack of planar hole quantum dot confinement. Recently, spin-orbit coupling terms $\propto k$ have been shown to be induced by strain inhomogeneity. Our hybrid approach to realistic device modeling suggests that strain inhomogeneity due to both random alloy disorder and gate-induced strain make a strong contribution to the linear-$k$ Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling, which eventually dominates hole spin EDSR; and there exist specific in-plane orientations of the global magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ and the microwave drive $\mathbf{\tilde{E}}_{\text{ac}}$ for maximum EDSR Rabi frequency of the hole spin qubit. The current model including strain inhomogeneity accurately predicts the EDSR Rabi frequency to be $\!\sim\!100$ MHz for typical electric and magnetic fields in experiments, which represents at least an order of magnitude improvement in accuracy over phenomenological models assuming uniform uniaxial strain. State-of-the-art atomistic tight binding calculations via nano-electronic modeling (NEMO3D) are in agreement with the $\mathbf{k}{\cdot}\mathbf{p}$ description.

Title: Large thermoelectric spin-valve effect with a superconductor
Authors: Pablo Tuero, Johanne Bratland Tjernshaugen, Carlos Sanchez, César Gonzalez-Ruano, Yuan Lu, Jacob Linder, Farkhad G. Aliev
Abstract: Recent studies have revealed magnetically controllable thermoelectric effects in superconductor/ferromagnet (S/F) structures. A tunable cryogenic thermoelectric generator needs not only a high conversion factor between electricity and heat, but also a large change in the thermoelectric output when switching the magnetic state of the device. Here, we experimentally measure and numerically model thermoelectric effects in fully epitaxial F/S/F junctions based on commercially available, easily grown materials, as well as their dependence on the magnetic configuration of the F electrodes. We observe sizeable Seebeck coefficients for the parallel alignment of the ferromagnetic electrodes, reaching values of about $100$~$\mu$V/K. Importantly, we find a decrease of the thermoelectric signal of more than an order of magnitude when switching from a parallel to an antiparallel configuration, constituting a large thermoelectric spin-valve effect. Theoretical modeling based on a self-consistent non-equilibrium Keldysh-Usadel Green function theory, combined with micromagnetic simulations, qualitatively reproduce the experimental findings. These findings pave the way for the development of efficient and versatile cryogenic thermoelectric heat engines.

Title: Many-body perturbation theory for moiré systems
Authors: Liangtao Peng, Giovanni Vignale, Shaffique Adam
Abstract: Moiré systems such as magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene have attracted significant attention due to their ability to host correlated phenomena including superconductivity and strongly correlated insulating states. By defining the single-particle Green's function in the band basis, we systematically develop a many-body perturbation theory framework to address correlations beyond the usual mean-field Hartree-Fock approaches. As a specific example, we first analyze twisted bilayer graphene within the Hartree-Fock approximation. We derive analytical solutions for symmetry-breaking states at integer fillings and the finite-temperature metal-insulator transition that closely match previously known numerical results in the literature. Moving beyond Hartree-Fock, we incorporate self-consistent GW corrections demonstrating that first-order diagrams significantly overestimate the filling-dependent fluctuations in the electronic compressibility. This framework provides a comprehensive pathway for exploring strong electronic correlations in moiré systems beyond mean-field, giving new insights into the interplay of symmetry breaking and electron correlations.

Title: Vortex dynamics in the region of charge imbalance
Authors: A. G. Sivakov, V. G. Volotskaya
Abstract: The nature of vortex flows in the nonequilibrium region arising in the vicinity of phase-slip lines at the S-N boundary are investigated experimentally. It is shown that vortices continue to move when charge imbalance appears in a film that is in a dynamic mixed state. The vortex dynamics in this case is determined by the interaction of the vortices with only the superconducting component of the current. This statement is supported by a study of the dynamic mixed state in the nonequilibrium region near the S-N boundary.

Title: Emergence of Order in Chemically Active Droplets: Temporal Dynamics and Collective Behavior
Authors: Sobiya Ashraf, Pawan Kumar, Prateek Dwivedi, Frédéric Blanc, Dipin Pillai, Rahul Mangal
Abstract: Collective behaviors such as swarming, chemical signaling, and clustering are fundamental to biological microorganisms, enabling hierarchical colony formation, coordinated motion, and enhanced nutrient accessibility crucial for their survival. Over the past few decades, extensive research has been dedicated to unraveling the mechanisms underlying these diverse collective patterns through experimental model systems. Among these, active droplets have emerged as valuable synthetic analogs, effectively replicating key biological attributes and serving as ideal platforms for investigating collective phenomena. This research explores the collective behavior of 4-Cyano-4-pentyl-biphenyl (5CB) oil droplets across varying Péclet ($Pe$) numbers. At high $Pe$, droplets exhibit a pusher mode of propulsion and form dynamic chain-like patterns. Decreasing $Pe$ enhances repulsive interactions among droplets, resulting in the inhibition of clustering. In the low $Pe$ regime, their repulsive interactions predominated by chemical field lead to the emergence of an ordered structure. Furthermore, we illustrate how active droplets efficiently navigate within a soft structured environment. These findings contribute to our comprehension of self-organized phenomena in active matter systems and provide insights for designing strategies for controlled locomotion in intricate fluidic environments.

Title: Interaction of Shear Horizontal Acoustic and Plasma Waves in Hexagonal Piezoelectric Semiconductors
Authors: Qingguo Xia, Jianke Dua, Jiashi Yangb
Abstract: We study coupled acoustic and plasma waves in piezoelectric semiconductor crystals of hexagonal symmetry. We focus on the so called shear-horizontal or antiplane motions with one mechanical displacement. A set of two dimensional equations is reduced from the three-dimensional equations. Since the material is effectively isotropic in the two dimensional plane under consideration, the equations are relatively simple. Dispersion curves of coupled elastic and acoustic waves are obtained analytically and examined numerically along with the effects of some parameters.

Title: Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in coherently strained AlN/GaN/AlN quantum wells on bulk AlN substrates
Authors: Yu-Hsin Chen, Jimy Encomendero, Huili Grace Xing, Debdeep Jena
Abstract: We report the observation of Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations in coherently strained, low-dislocation AlN/GaN/AlN quantum wells (QWs), including both undoped and $\delta$-doped structures. SdH measurements reveal a single subband occupation in the undoped GaN QW and two subband occupation in the $\delta$-doped GaN QW. More importantly, SdH oscillations enable direct measurement of critical two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) parameters at the Fermi level: carrier density and ground state energy level, electron effective mass ($m^* \approx 0.289\,m_{\rm e}$ for undoped GaN QW and $m^* \approx 0.298\,m_{\rm e}$ for $\delta$-doped GaN QW), and quantum scattering time ($\tau_{\rm q} \approx 83.4 \, \text{fs}$ for undoped GaN QW and $\tau_{\rm q} \approx 130.6 \, \text{fs}$ for $\delta$-doped GaN QW). These findings provide important insights into the fundamental properties of 2DEGs that are strongly quantum confined in the thin GaN QWs, essential for designing nitride heterostructures for high-performance electronic applications.

Title: Liquid crystalline structures formed by sphere-rod amphiphilic molecules in solvents
Authors: Nilanthi P. Haputhanthrige (1,2), Yifan Zhou (3), Jingfan Wei (3), Min Gao (1), Tianbo Liu (3), Oleg D. Lavrentovich (1,2) ((1) Advanced Materials and Liquid Crystal Institute, Kent State University, USA, (2) Department of Physics, Kent State University, USA, (3) School of Polymer Science and Polymer Engineering, The University of Akron, USA)
Abstract: Self-assembly of amphiphilic molecules is an important phenomenon attracting a broad range of research. In this work, we study the self-assembly of KTOF4 sphere-rod amphiphilic molecules in mixed water-dioxane solvents. The molecules are of a T-shaped geometry, comprised of a hydrophilic spherical Keggin-type cluster attached by a flexible bridge to the center of a hydrophobic rod-like oligodialkylfluorene (OF), which consists of four OF units. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) uncovers self-assembled spherical structures of KTOF4 in dilute solutions. These spheres are filled with smectic-like layers of KTOF4 separated by layers of the solution. There are two types of layer packings: (i) concentric spheres and (ii) flat layers. The concentric spheres form when the dioxane volume fraction in the solution is 35-50 vol%. The flat layers are formed when the dioxane volume fraction is either below (20 and 30 vol%.) or above (55 and 60 vol%.) the indicated range. The layered structures show no in-plane orientational order and thus resemble thermotropic smectic A liquid crystals and their lyotropic analogs. The layered packings reveal edge and screw dislocations. Evaporation of the solvent produces a bulk birefringent liquid crystal phase with textures resembling the ones of uniaxial nematic liquid crystals. These findings demonstrate that sphere-rod molecules produce a variety of self-assembled structures that are controlled by the solvent properties.

Title: Operation of a high-frequency, phase-slip qubit
Authors: Cheeranjeev Purmessur, Kaicheung Chow, Bernard van Heck, Angela Kou
Abstract: Aluminum-based Josephson junctions are currently the main sources of nonlinearity for control and manipulation of superconducting qubits. A phase-slip junction, the dual of a Josephson junction, provides an alternative source of nonlinearity that promises new types of protected qubits and the possibility of high-temperature and high-frequency operation through the use of superconductors with larger energy gaps. Phase-slip junctions have been challenging, however, to incorporate into superconducting qubits because of difficulty controlling junction parameters. Here we demonstrate the operation of a superconducting qubit based on a phase slip junction made using titanium nitride. We operate the qubit at zero flux where the qubit frequency (~17 GHz) is mainly determined by the inductance of the qubit. We perform readout and coherent control of the superconducting qubit, and measure qubit lifetimes >60 $\mu$s. Finally, we demonstrate operation of the qubit at temperatures exceeding 300 mK. Our results add the phase-slip junction as a tool for superconducting quantum information processing and opens avenues for new classes of superconducting qubits.

Title: On the use of neural networks for the structural characterization of polymeric porous materials
Authors: Jorge Torre, Suset Barroso-Solares, M.A. Rodríguez-Pérez, Javier Pinto
Abstract: The structural characterization is an essential task in the study of porous materials. To achieve reliable results, it requires to evaluate images with hundreds of pores. Current methods require large time amounts and are subjected to human errors and subjectivity. A completely automatic tool would not only speed up the process but also enhance its reliability and reproducibility. Therefore, the main objective of this article is the study of a deep-learning-based technique for the structural characterization of porous materials, through the use of a convolutional neural network. Several fine-tuned Mask R CNN models are evaluated using different training configurations in four separate datasets each composed of numerous SEM images of diverse polymeric porous materials: closed-pore extruded polystyrene (XPS), polyurethane (PU), and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), and open-pore PU. Results prove the tool capable of providing very accurate results, equivalent to those achieved by time consuming manual methods, in a matter of seconds.

Title: Pairing phase diagram for electron-doped cuprates in the square-lattice $t-U-V$ Hubbard model
Authors: Zhangkai Cao, Shuning Tan, Ji Liu, Xiaosen Yang, Tao Ying, Ho-Kin Tang, Cho-Tung Yip
Abstract: Motivated by significant discrepancies between experimental observations of electron-doped cuprates and numerical results of the Hubbard model, we investigate the role of nearest-neighbor (NN) electron interactions $V$ by studying the $t-U-V$ model on square lattices. Upon doping $\delta$= 0.153, by using constrained path quantum Monte Carlo (CPQMC) method, we find that NN electron attraction $V$ can notably drive an exotic $p$-wave spin-triplet pairing, while the NN electron repulsion $V$ will suppress the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave ($d$-wave) pairing and triggers the $d_{xy}$-wave pairing. Especially in the intermediate coupling regime, as NN repulsion increases, the intensity of $d_{xy}$-wave pairing also increases, further suppressing the presence of $d$-wave pairing, which may help explain the notable suppression of $d$-wave pairing in electron-doped cuprate superconductors. Besides the pairing phase, we also find that the NN electron attraction $V$ has no significant effect on spin density wave (SDW) and charge density wave (CDW), but repulsion $V$ significantly enhanced CDW and suppressed SDW. Our study suggests the $t-U-V$ Hubbard model can serve as the minimal model to capture the essential physics of the electron-doped cuprates. Notably, for $V/U \sim 1/4 - 1/3$, the results align more closely with the experimentally observed behavior of electron-doped systems, potentially explaining the shrinkage of $d$-wave superconductivity region and the decrease of superconducting temperature.

Title: Majorana quasiparticles in atomic spin chains on superconductors
Authors: Stephan Rachel, Roland Wiesendanger
Abstract: For the past decade, Majorana quasiparticles have become one of the hot topics in condensed matter research. Besides the fundamental interest in the realization of particles being their own antiparticles, going back to basic concepts of elementary particle physics, Majorana quasiparticles in condensed matter systems offer exciting potential applications in topological quantum computation due to their non-Abelian quantum exchange statistics. Motivated by theoretical predictions about possible realizations of Majorana quasiparticles as zero-energy modes at boundaries of topological superconductors, experimental efforts have focussed in particular on quasi-one-dimensional semiconductor-superconductor and magnet-superconductor hybrid systems. However, an unambiguous proof of the existence of Majorana quasiparticles is still challenging and requires considerable improvements in materials science, atomic-scale characterization and control of interface quality, as well as complementary approaches of detecting various facets of Majorana quasiparticles. Bottom-up atom-by-atom fabrication of disorder-free atomic spin chains on atomically clean superconducting substrates has recently allowed deep insight into the emergence of topological sub-gap Shiba bands and associated Majorana states from the level of individual atoms up to extended chains, thereby offering the possibility for critical tests of Majorana physics in disorder-free model-type 1D hybrid systems.

Title: Density Functional Tight-Binding Captures Plasmon-Driven H$_2$ Dissociation on Al Nanocrystals
Authors: Nikhil S. Chellam, George C. Schatz
Abstract: Aluminum nanocrystals offer a promising platform for plasmonic photocatalysis, yet a detailed understanding of their electron dynamics and consequent photocatalytic performance has been challenging thus far due to computational limitations. Here, we employ density functional tight-binding methods (DFTB) to investigate the optical properties and H<sub>2</sub> dissociation dynamics of Al nanocrystals with varying sizes and geometries. Our real-time simulations reveal that Al's unique free-electron nature enables efficient light-matter interactions and rapid electronic thermalization. Cubic and octahedral nanocrystals ranging from 0.5 to 4.5 nm exhibit size-dependent plasmon resonances in the UV, with distinct spectral features arising from the particle geometry and electronic structure. By simulating H<sub>2</sub> dissociation near Al nanocrystals, we demonstrate that hot electrons generated through plasmon excitation can overcome the molecule's strong chemical bond within tens of femtoseconds. The laser intensity threshold is comparable to previous reports for Ag nanocrystals, though significantly lower than that of Au. Notably, the dipolar plasmon mode demonstrates higher efficiency for this reaction than the localized interband transition for particles at these sizes. Taken together, this work provides mechanistic insights into plasmon-driven catalysis and showcases DFTB's capability to study quantum plasmonics at unprecedented length and time scales.

Title: Uncertainty Quantification for Misspecified Machine Learned Interatomic Potentials
Authors: Danny Perez, Aparna P. A. Subramanyam, Ivan Maliyov, Thomas D. Swinburne
Abstract: The use of high-dimensional regression techniques from machine learning has significantly improved the quantitative accuracy of interatomic potentials. Atomic simulations can now plausibly target quantitative predictions in a variety of settings, which has brought renewed interest in robust means to quantify uncertainties on simulation results. In many practical settings, encompassing both classical and a large class of machine learning potentials, the dominant form of uncertainty is currently not due to lack of training data but to misspecification, namely the inability of any one choice of model parameters to exactly match all ab initio training data. However, Bayesian inference, the most common formal tool used to quantify uncertainty, is known to ignore misspecification and thus significantly underestimates parameter uncertainties. Here, we employ a recent misspecification-aware regression technique to quantify parameter uncertainties, which is then propagated to a broad range of phase and defect properties in tungsten via brute force resampling or implicit differentiation. The propagated misspecification uncertainties robustly envelope errors to direct \textit{ab initio} calculation of material properties outside of the training dataset, an essential requirement for any quantitative multi-scale modeling scheme. Finally, we demonstrate application to recent foundational machine learning interatomic potentials, accurately predicting and bounding errors in MACE-MPA-0 energy predictions across the diverse materials project database. Perspectives for the approach in multiscale simulation workflows are discussed.

Title: Detection of chiral spin fluctuations driven by frustration in Mott insulators
Authors: Kuan H. Hsu, Chunjing Jia, Emily Z. Zhang, Daniel Jost, Brian Moritz, Rudi Hackl, Thomas P. Devereaux
Abstract: Topologically ordered states, such as chiral spin liquids, have been proposed as candidates that host fractionalized excitations. However, detecting chiral character or proximity to these non-trivial states remains a challenge. Resonant Raman scattering can be a powerful tool for detecting chiral fluctuations, as the $A_{2g}$ channel probes excitations with broken time-reversal symmetry and local chiral order. Here, we use exact diagonalization to characterize the resonant $A_{2g}$ channel, alongside two-magnon scattering in $B_{1g}$ and $E_g$ channels, for the Hubbard model on lattices with increasing levels of geometric spin frustration, where tuning the incident energy near the Mott gap reveals strong chiral spin excitation intensity. Increased spin frustration in the Mott insulator results in an overall softening of the Raman $A_{2g}$ response, indicating a tendency toward low energy chiral-chiral fluctuations in Mott insulators with magnetic frustration and proximity to chiral spin liquid states that can potentially be tuned by external perturbations.

Title: Anisotropic resonance energy transfer with strained phosphorene
Authors: J. Oliveira-Cony, C. Farina, P. P. Abrantes, Tarik P. Cysne
Abstract: We analyze the resonance energy transfer (RET) rate between quantum emitters (QEs) near a phosphorene/SiC interface under the effects of uniaxial strain. Using a low-energy tight-binding model, we describe the electronic structure of strained phosphorene in an experimentally feasible situation. Due to the anisotropic electronic structure of phosphorene, we demonstrate that the RET rate drastically depends on the direction in which the QEs are separated relative to the phosphorene lattice. More specifically, we obtain a large variation in the RET rate when the QEs are separated along the zigzag direction, in contrast to a rather small variation when separated along the armchair direction of phosphorene's crystalline structure. Furthermore, our results reveal that the RET rate can be highly modulated by uniaxial strain in phosphorene when considering emitters placed along the zigzag direction. Finally, by means of a simple toy model, we also show that this anisotropy in the RET rate is a general characteristic produced by anisotropic 2D materials.

Title: Weyl semimetal phases and intrinsic spin-Hall conductivity in SbAs ordered alloys
Authors: Muhammad Zubair, Dai Q. Ho, Duy Quang To, Shoaib Khalid, Anderson Janotti
Abstract: Using density functional theory calculations we investigated possible Weyl semimetal (WSM) phases in antimony arsenide ordered alloys Sb1-xAsx (x=0, 1/6, 1/3, 1/2, 2/3, 5/6, 1). We find WSM phases for all As compositions of Sb1-xAsx with broken inversion symmetry, in contrast to Bi1-xSbx where only compositions x=1/2 and 5/6 were predicted to exhibit WSM phases. The WSM phases in Sb1-xAsx are characterized by the presence of 12 Weyl points, located within 55 meV from the Fermi level in the case of x=1/2. The robust spin-orbit coupling strength and Berry curvature in these alloys produce large spin-Hall conductivity in the range of 176-602 (hbar/e)(S/cm), comparable to that in the BiSb alloys. Finally, Sb0.5As0.5 is predicted to be almost lattice-matched to GaAs(111), with the Fermi level within the gap of the semiconductor, facilitating growth and characterization, and thus, offering promising integration with conventional semiconductors.

Title: An Unconventional Ultra-Sub-Wavelength Receiving Nano-Antenna Activated by ac Spin Pumping and the ac Inverse Spin Hall Effect
Authors: Raisa Fabiha, Michael Suche, Erdem Topsakal, Supriyo Bandyopadhyay
Abstract: We report an extreme sub-wavelength unconventional receiving antenna. It consists of an array of nanomagnets connected to heavy metal nanostrips. Incident electromagnetic (EM) radiation generates intrinsic and extrinsic spin waves in the nanomagnets, which pump spin into the heavy metal nanostrips at their own frequencies giving rise to a polychromatic alternating voltage across the latter owing to the ac inverse spin Hall effect. This implements a receiving nano-antenna. We demonstrate its operation at two different EM wave frequencies of 1.5 GHz and 2.4 GHz - the latter being the Bluetooth and Wi-Fi frequency. We measure the receiving gain at 2.4 GHz to be approximately -9 db. The free space radiated wavelength "lambda" at 2.4 GHz is 12.5 cm while the antenna area A is merely 160 micron^2, making the ratio A/lambda^2 = 0.97x10^-8. This antenna's receiving gain should be very poor because of the tiny size. Yet the measured gain is more than 4000 times larger than the theoretical limit for a conventional antenna of this size at this wavelength because of the unconventional operating principle.

Title: Efficient First-Principles Framework for Overdamped Phonon Dynamics and Anharmonic Electron-Phonon Coupling in Superionic Materials
Authors: Yuxuan Wang, Marios Zacharias, Xiao Zhang, Nick Pant, Jacky Even, Pierre F. P. Poudeu, Emmanouil Kioupakis
Abstract: Relying on the anharmonic special displacement method, we introduce an ab initio quasistatic polymorphous framework to describe local disorder, anharmonicity, and electron-phonon coupling in superionic conductors. Using the example of cubic Cu2Se, we show that positional polymorphism yields extremely overdamped anharmonic vibrations while preserving transverse acoustic phonons, consistent with experiments. We also demonstrate well-defined electronic band structures with large band gap openings due to polymorphism of 1.0 eV and calculate anharmonic electron-phonon renormalization, yielding band gap narrowing with increasing temperature in agreement with previous measurements. Our approach opens the way for efficient ab initio electronic structure calculations in superionic crystals to elucidate their compelling high figure-of-merit.

Title: Impact of Annealing Temperature on the Energy Storage Performance of CoO2 Nanoparticles Synthesized via Solid State Reaction
Authors: Shoaib Akram, Muneeb ur Rahman, Fazli Maula, Osama Tariq Satti, Shahbaz Afzal, Fawad Ali
Abstract: The solid-state reaction was used to synthesize CoO2 nanostructured material. Cobalt nitrate tetrahydrate and sodium oxide (NaOH) were combined to produce CoO2 nanostructured material. The three synthesized working electrodes were each tested individually, using 3 M KOH as the electrolyte. The CV analysis of a three-electrode system revealed redox peaks, indicating Faradaic processes. The estimated specific capacitances of CoO2, CoO2 (250oC), CoO2 (300oC) nanostructured material at scan rates of (10) mVs-1 is (223, 348, and 473) Fg-1. The diffraction peaks at 2{\theta} = 26.264o, 33.527o, 37.579, 51.264 and 54.367o correspond respectively to the diffraction planes of 111, 112, 200, 211, and 311 of CoO2 nanostructured material. The annealing temperature, which affects the bandgap, can influence the size, shape, and crystallinity of nanostructures. For the unannealed material, the energy bandgap of CoO2 is 2.00 eV, whereas for the annealed material it ranges from 1.77 to 1.86 eV.

Title: Non-linear integral equations for the XXX spin-1/2 quantum chain with non-diagonal boundary fields
Authors: Holger Frahm, Andreas Klümper, Dennis Wagner, Xin Zhang
Abstract: The XXX spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg chain with non-diagonal boundary fields represents a cornerstone model in the study of integrable systems with open boundaries. Despite its significance, solving this model exactly has remained a formidable challenge due to the breaking of $U(1)$ symmetry. Building on the off-diagonal Bethe Ansatz (ODBA), we derive a set of nonlinear integral equations (NLIEs) that encapsulate the exact spectrum of the model. For $U(1)$ symmetric spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ chains such NLIEs involve two functions $a(x)$ and $\bar{a}(x)$ coupled by an integration kernel with short-ranged elements. The solution functions show characteristic features for arguments at some length scale which grows logarithmically with system size $N$. For the non $U(1)$ symmetric case, the equations involve a novel third function $c(x)$, which captures the inhomogeneous contributions of the $T$-$Q$ relation. The kernel elements coupling this function to the standard ones are long-ranged and lead for the ground-state to a winding phenomenon. In $\log(1+a(x))$ and $\log(1+\bar a(x))$ we observe a sudden change by $2\pi$i at a characteristic scale $x_1$ of the argument. Other features appear at a value $x_0$ which is of order $\log N$. These two length scales, $x_1$ and $x_0$, are independent: their ratio $x_1/x_0$ is large for small $N$ and small for large $N$. Explicit solutions to the NLIEs are obtained numerically for these limiting cases, though intermediate cases ($x_1/x_0 \sim 1$) present computational challenges. This work lays the foundation for studying finite-size corrections and conformal properties of other integrable spin chains with non-diagonal boundaries, opening new avenues for exploring boundary effects in quantum integrable systems.

Abstract: Electronic flat bands associated with quenched kinetic energy and heavy electron mass have attracted great interest for promoting strong electronic correlations and emergent phenomena such as high-temperature charge fractionalization and superconductivity. Intense experimental and theoretical research has been devoted to establishing the rich non-trivial metallic and heavy fermion phases intertwined with such localized electronic states. Here, we investigate the transition metal oxide spinel LiV2O4, an enigmatic heavy fermion compound lacking localized f orbital states. We use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and dynamical mean field theory to reveal a new kind of correlation-induced flat band with suppressed inter-atomic electron hopping arising from intra-atomic Hund coupling. The appearance of heavy quasiparticles is ascribed to a proximate orbital-selective Mott state characterized by fluctuating local moments as evidenced by complementary magnetotransport measurements. The spectroscopic fingerprints of long-lived quasiparticles and their disappearance with increasing temperature further support the emergence of a high-temperature bad metal state observed in transport data. This work resolves a long-standing puzzle on the origin of heavy fermion behavior and unconventional transport in LiV2O4. Simultaneously, it opens a new path to achieving flat bands through electronic interactions in d-orbital systems with geometrical frustration, potentially enabling the realization of exotic phases of matter such as the fractionalized Fermi liquids.

Title: CO2 adsorption mechanisms in hydrated silica nanopores: Insights from grand canonical Monte Carlo to classical and ab initio molecular dynamics
Authors: Jihong Shi, Tao Zhang, Shuyu Sun, Liang Gong
Abstract: Understanding interfacial phenomena in confined systems is important for optimizing CO2 capture technologies. Here, we present a comprehensive investigation of CO2 adsorption in hydrated amorphous silica nanopores through an integrated computational approach combining grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC), classical molecular dynamics (MD), and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. The excess adsorption isotherms reveal a marked hydration dependence, with CO2 uptake decreasing from 7.6 to 2.6 mmol/g as water content increases from 1 to 15 wt%. Analysis of adsorption kinetics demonstrates a distinctive bimodal process, characterized by rapid initial uptake followed by slower diffusion-limited adsorption, with the latter becoming increasingly dominant at higher hydration levels. Classical MD simulations reveal an inverse correlation between hydration and CO2 mobility, with self-diffusion coefficients decreasing across the studied hydration range. Density profile analysis indicates a hydration-induced transition in CO2 distribution from central pore regions to surface-proximate domains, accompanied by restructuring of interfacial water networks. Notably, AIMD simulations capture previously unrecognized chemical processes, including proton transfer mechanisms leading to surface silanol formation with characteristic O-O distances of 2.4-2.5 Å, and spontaneous CO2 hydration yielding carbonate species through water-mediated reaction pathways. These findings demonstrate the dual role of confined water as both a spatial competitor and reaction medium for CO2 capture, providing molecular-level insights with quantum mechanical accuracy for design of carbon capture materials.

Title: Finite-Temperature Kinetic Ferromagnetism in the Square Lattice Hubbard Model
Authors: Robin C. Newby, Ehsan Khatami
Abstract: While the exact phase diagram of the Fermi-Hubbard model remains poorly understood despite decades of progress, nearly 60 years ago, Nagaoka proved that a single dopant in an otherwise half-filled Hubbard system can bring about ferromagnetism through kinetic means. The phenomenon was recently observed with ultracold atoms in triangular optical lattices. Here, we explore the kinetic ferromagnetism within the square lattice Hubbard model and its strong-coupling counterpart, the $t-J$ model, at finite temperatures in the thermodynamic limit via numerical linked-cluster expansions. We find evidence of ferromagnetic Nagaoka polarons at dopings up to $\sim 30\%$ away from half filling for a variety of interaction strengths and at temperatures as low as $0.2$ of the hopping energy. We map out the boundaries of this phase through analyzing various correlation functions.

Title: Comprehensive numerical analysis of doping controlled efficiency in lead free Cs(SnGe)I3 perovskites
Authors: Nazmul Hasan, M. Hussayeen Khan Anik, Mohammed Mehedi Hasan, Sharnali Islam, Alamgir Kabir
Abstract: One effective way to prevent toxicity and improve the stability of materials for photovoltaic applications is to exclude lead and organic molecules from perovskite materials. Specifically, the CsSn1-xGexI3 appears to be a promising contender; nonetheless, it requires optimization, particularly bandgap tuning by doping concentration modifications. In this study, density functional theory (DFT) was employed to comprehensively analyze the electronic properties of CsSn1-xGexI3 that influenced light-matter interactions tuning of the perovskite materials by varying composition in B site atoms. We use the solar cell capacitance (SCAPS-1D) simulator to compute device performance; however, it computes the absorption spectrum using a simplified mathematical function that approximates the actual spectrum. To achieve a quantum-mechanical level of accuracy DFT extracted parameters like absorption spectra and bandgap were fed into SCAPS-1D. We find that increasing the Ge concentration leads to a higher bandgap and improved absorption profile, thereby enhancing solar energy conversion efficiency. Thermal and field distribution analyses were also done for the optimized device through a finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) framework. By optimizing the absorber layer with a 75% Ge concentration, we achieve a remarkable PCE of 23.80%. Our findings guide future research in designing high-performance non-leaded halide PSCs, paving the way for low-cost, stable, and highly efficient solar cells through atomic doping-tuned perovskite absorber layers.

Title: Global Universal Scaling and Ultra-Small Parameterization in Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials with Super-Linearity
Authors: Yanxiao Hu, Ye Sheng, Jing Huang, Xiaoxin Xu, Yuyan Yang, Mingqiang Zhang, Yabei Wu, Caichao Ye, Jiong Yang, Wenqing Zhang
Abstract: Using machine learning (ML) to construct interatomic interactions and thus potential energy surface (PES) has become a common strategy for materials design and simulations. However, those current models of machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) provide no relevant physical constrains, and thus may owe intrinsic out-of-domain difficulty which underlies the challenges of model generalizability and physical scalability. Here, by incorporating physics-informed Universal-Scaling law and nonlinearity-embedded interaction function, we develop a Super-linear MLIP with both Ultra-Small parameterization and greatly expanded expressive capability, named SUS2-MLIP. Due to the global scaling rooting in universal equation of state (UEOS), SUS2-MLIP not only has significantly-reduced parameters by decoupling the element space from coordinate space, but also naturally outcomes the out-of-domain difficulty and endows the potentials with inherent generalizability and scalability even with relatively small training dataset. The nonlinearity-enbeding transformation for interaction function expands the expressive capability and make the potentials super-linear. The SUS2-MLIP outperforms the state-of-the-art MLIP models with its exceptional computational efficiency especially for multiple-element materials and physical scalability in property prediction. This work not only presents a highly-efficient universal MLIP model but also sheds light on incorporating physical constraints into artificial-intelligence-aided materials simulation.

Title: Auxiliary dynamical mean-field approach for Anderson-Hubbard model with off-diagonal disorder
Authors: Zelei Zhang, Jiawei Yan, Li Huang, Youqi Ke
Abstract: This work reports a theoretical framework that combines the auxiliary coherent potential approximation (ACPA-DMFT) with dynamical mean-field theory to study strongly correlated and disordered electronic systems with both diagonal and off-diagonal disorders. In this method, by introducing an auxiliary coupling space with extended local degree of freedom,the diagonal and off-diagonal disorders are treated in a unified and self-consistent framework of coherent potential approximation, within which the dynamical mean-field theory is naturally combined to handle the strongly correlated Anderson-Hubbard model. By using this approach, we compute matsubara Green's functions for a simple cubic lattice at finite temperatures and derive impurity spectral functions through the maximum entropy method. Our results reveal the critical influence of off-diagonal disorder on Mott-type metal-insulator transitions. Specifically, a reentrant phenomenon is identified, where the system transitions between insulating and metallic states under varying interaction strengths. The ACPA-DMFT method provides an efficient and robust computational method for exploring the intricate interplay of disorder and strong correlations.

Title: Floquet-Volkov interference in a semiconductor
Authors: Changhua Bao, Haoyuan Zhong, Benshu Fan, Xuanxi Cai, Fei Wang, Shaohua Zhou, Tianyun Lin, Hongyun Zhang, Pu Yu, Peizhe Tang, Wenhui Duan, Shuyun Zhou
Abstract: Intense light-field can dress both Bloch electrons inside crystals and photo-emitted free electrons in the vacuum, dubbed as Floquet and Volkov states respectively. These quantum states can further interfere coherently, modulating light-field dressed states. Here, we report experimental evidence of the Floquet-Volkov interference in a semiconductor - black phosphorus. A highly asymmetric modulation of the spectral weight is observed for the Floquet-Volkov states, and such asymmetry can be further controlled by rotating the pump polarization. Our work reveals the quantum interference between different light-field dressed electronic states, providing insights for material engineering on the ultrafast timescale.

Title: Colloidal Model for Investigating Optimal Efficiency in Weakly Coupled Ratchet Motors
Authors: José Martín-Roca, Laura Izquierdo-Solís, Fernando Martínez-Pedrero, Pau Casadejust, Ignacio Pagonabarraga, Carles Calero
Abstract: We investigate the transport of superparamagnetic colloidal particles along self-assembled tracks using a periodically applied magnetic field as a model for ratchet-like mechanisms. Through video microscopy and simulations, we examine how factors such as particle size, track roughness, and the shape, intensity, and frequency of the applied potential influence transport efficiency. The findings reveal that processive motion can be achieved without residual attraction, with optimal transport efficiency governed by the combined effects of particle size ratios, actuation frequency, track roughness, and asymmetry in the applied potential. Additionally, we explore alternative strategies, including weak residual attraction and alternating magnetic fields, to further enhance efficiency. These findings provide valuable insights for the development of synthetic micro/nanomotors with potential applications in drug delivery and environmental remediation.

Title: Ultrafast dynamics of moments in bulk ferromagnets
Authors: Mouad Fattouhi, Pascal Thibaudeau, Liliana D. Buda-Prejbeanu
Abstract: A robust and efficient model for investigating the ultrafast dynamics of magnetic materials excited by laser pulses has been created, integrating dynamic Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch equations with a quantum thermostat and a two-temperature model. The model has been successfully applied to three archetypal materials in the literature: nickel, cobalt, and iron. Additionally, analysis of the ultrafast dynamic susceptibility tensor indicates that off-diagonal components display specific features depending on whether a continuous external magnetic field is present.

Title: Explainable Multimodal Machine Learning for Revealing Structure-Property Relationships in Carbon Nanotube Fibers
Authors: Daisuke Kimura, Naoko Tajima, Toshiya Okazaki, Shun Muroga
Abstract: In this study, we propose Explainable Multimodal Machine Learning (EMML), which integrates the analysis of diverse data types (multimodal data) using factor analysis for feature extraction with Explainable AI (XAI), for carbon nanotube (CNT) fibers prepared from aqueous dispersions. This method is a powerful approach to elucidate the mechanisms governing material properties, where multi-stage fabrication conditions and multiscale structures have complex influences. Thus, in our case, this approach helps us understand how different processing steps and structures at various scales impact the final properties of CNT fibers. The analysis targeted structures ranging from the nanoscale to the macroscale, including aggregation size distributions of CNT dispersions and the effective length of CNTs. Furthermore, because some types of data were difficult to interpret using standard methods, challenging-to-interpret distribution data were analyzed using Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) for extracting key features that determine the outcome. Contribution analysis with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) demonstrated that small, uniformly distributed aggregates are crucial for improving fracture strength, while CNTs with long effective lengths are significant factors for enhancing electrical conductivity. The analysis also identified thresholds and trends for these key factors to assist in defining the conditions needed to optimize CNT fiber properties. EMML is not limited to CNT fibers but can be applied to the design of other materials derived from nanomaterials, making it a useful tool for developing a wide range of advanced materials. This approach provides a foundation for advancing data-driven materials research.

Title: Origins of the anomalous Hall conductivity in the symmetry enforced Fe3GeTe2 nodal-line ferromagnet
Authors: Mikel García-Díez, Haim Beidenkopf, Iñigo Robredo, Maia G. Vergniory
Abstract: Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ has gained attention in the condensed matter community for its potential to be exfoliated into thin films with ferromagnetic (FM) order, thanks to its van der Waals layered structure and significant intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC). In this work, we analyze the electronic structure and show that, contrary to prior claims, the bulk of the AHC cannot arise from gapped nodal lines. By studying the material's symmetry properties, both with and without spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and across paramagnetic and FM phases, we find that Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ hosts mirror-symmetry-protected nodal lines, which support surface drumhead states. Additionally, we identify three key sources of AHC: nodal lines in the paramagnetic phase gapped by the FM order, Weyl points within specific energy ranges, and gaps between spin-up and spin-down bands caused by SOC. Finally, our calculations suggest that electron doping could increase the AHC up to four times compared to its value at the computed Fermi level.

Title: Non-adiabaticity from first principles: the exact-factorization approach for solids
Authors: Galit Cohen, Rachel Steinitz-Eliyahu, E. K. U. Gross, Sivan Refaely-Abramson, Ryan Requist
Abstract: The thorough treatment of electron-lattice interactions from first principles is one of the main goals in condensed matter physics. While the commonly applied adiabatic Born-Oppenheimer approximation is sufficient for describing many physical phenomena, it is limited in its ability to capture meaningful features originating from non-adiabatic coupling effects. The exact factorization method, starting from the full Hamiltonian of electrons and nuclei, provides a way to systematically account for non-adiabatic effects. This formalism was recently developed into an ab initio density functional theory framework. Within this framework we here develop a perturbative approach to the electronic states in solid state materials. We derive exact-factorization-based perturbations of the Kohn-Sham states up to second order in the nuclear displacements. These non-adiabatic features in the calculated energy and wavefunction corrections are expressed in terms of readily available density functional perturbation theory components.

Title: Emergence of topological superconductivity in the presence of chiral magnetism in 2D CrInTe$_3$
Authors: Arnob Mukherjee, Fengyi Zhou, Soheil Ershadrad, Tanay Nag, Duo Wang, Biplab Sanyal
Abstract: We propose a general framework for designing a two-dimensional (2D) topological superconductor (TSC) using a magnet-superconductor hybrid system. This setup involves a monolayer of CrInTe$_3$, which hosts noncoplanar magnetic textures, in proximity to a 2D $s$-wave superconducting layer. Serving as an alternative to $p$-wave superconductors, this configuration induces a topological superconducting phase and is a promising platform for realizing the 2D Kitaev model, which supports Majorana zero-energy modes through emergent $p$-wave symmetry superconducting pairing. Notably, the magnetic moments break time-reversal symmetry while the superconducting state preserves particle-hole symmetry, placing our system in the Altland-Zirnbauer class $D$ and ensuring robust Majorana excitations. We first perform density functional theory-based simulations to study a monolayer of CrInTe$_3$, from which essential magnetic characteristic parameters, such as Heisenberg exchange interaction and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), are calculated using the state-of-the-art Liechtenstein-Katsnelson-Antropov-Gubanov (LKAG) approach. With a substantial DMI coupling exhibited in CrInTe$_3$, large-scale Monte Carlo simulations reveal the stabilization of a noncoplanar spiral magnetic state as ground state. In this magnetic phase, we observe a transition from corner modes in the zero-energy local density of states (LDOS) to edge modes as the chemical potential ($\mu$) varies. Furthermore, under a finite magnetic field, the system enters a mixed magnetic state, characterized by isolated skyrmions and spiral domain walls, which lead to unique low-energy localization of electronic wave functions, rendering the system an insulator. Finally, we discuss potential experimental realizations of TSC in this magnet-superconductor interfacial system, using real-space probes such as scanning tunneling microscopy (STM).

Title: Enhancement of damping in a turbulent atomic Bose-Einstein condensate
Authors: Junghoon Lee, Jongmin Kim, Jongheum Jung, Yong-il Shin
Abstract: We investigate the collective oscillations of atomic Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) containing spin-superflow turbulence and observe an enhancement in damping due to the turbulence. As steady-state turbulence is maintained in a spin-1 BEC using a spin-driving technique, we measure the damping rate of the quadrupole oscillation of the BEC across a range of temperatures and show that it exceeds the thermal damping rate predicted by a Landau damping model for BECs without turbulence. To explain the additional damping, we introduce an effective viscosity $\nu_\text{T}$, analogous to the turbulent viscosity in classical turbulence. Our measurements suggest that $\nu_\text{T}\sim 0.05 \times \frac{h}{m}$, where $h$ is Planck's constant and $m$ is the atomic mass.

Title: Effective description of Taylor dispersion in strongly corrugated channels
Authors: Arthur Alexandre, Thomas Guérin, David S. Dean
Abstract: Taylor dispersion in periodic but highly corrugated channels is studied. Exact analytical expressions for the long-time diffusion constant and drift along the channel are derived to next-to-leading order in the limit of small channel period. Using these results we show how an effective model for Taylor dispersion in tortuous porous media can be framed in terms of dispersion in a uniform channel with absorption/desorption at its surface, an effective slip length for the flow at the surface and an effective, universal, diffusion constant on the surface. This work thus extends the concept of an effective slip-length for hydrodynamics flows to Taylor dispersion by those flows. The analytical results are confirmed by numerical calculations, and present a robust method to understand and upscale the transport properties of flows in porous media.

Title: A multiscale Bayesian approach to quantification and denoising of energy-dispersive x-ray data
Authors: Pau Torruella, Abderrahim Halimi, Ludovica Tovaglieri, Céline Lichtensteiger, Duncan T. L. Alexander, Cécile Hébert
Abstract: Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrum imaging yields compositional information with a spatial resolution down to the atomic level. However, experimental limitations often produce extremely sparse and noisy EDX spectra. Under such conditions, every detected X-ray must be leveraged to obtain the maximum possible amount of information about the sample. To this end, we introduce a robust multiscale Bayesian approach that accounts for the Poisson statistics in the EDX data and leverages their underlying spatial correlations. This is combined with EDX spectral simulation (elemental contributions and Bremsstrahlung background) into a Bayesian estimation strategy. When tested using simulated datasets, the chemical maps obtained with this approach are more accurate and preserve a higher spatial resolution than those obtained by standard methods. These properties translate to experimental datasets, where the method enhances the atomic resolution chemical maps of a canonical tetragonal ferroelectric PbTiO3 sample, such that ferroelectric domains are mapped with unit-cell resolution.

Title: Topological superconductivity in hourglass Dirac chain metals (Ti, Hf)IrGe
Authors: Pavan Kumar Meena, Dibyendu Samanta, Sonika Jangid, Roshan Kumar Kushwaha, Rhea Stewart, Adrian D. Hillier, Sudeep Kumar Ghosh, Ravi Prakash Singh
Abstract: Realizing topological superconductivity in stoichiometric materials is a key challenge in condensed matter physics. Here, we report the discovery of ternary germanide superconductors, $M$IrGe ($M$ = Ti, Hf), as prime candidates for topological superconductivity, predicted to exhibit nonsymmorphic symmetry-protected hourglass Dirac chains. Using comprehensive thermodynamic and muon-spin rotation/relaxation ($\mu$SR) measurements, we establish these materials as conventional bulk type-II superconductors with transition temperatures of 2.24(5) K for TiIrGe and 5.64(4) K for HfIrGe, featuring a full gap and preserved time-reversal symmetry. First-principles calculations reveal striking topological features in $M$IrGe, including hourglass-shaped bulk dispersions and a Dirac chain- a ring of fourfold-degenerate Dirac points protected by nonsymmorphic symmetry. Each Dirac point corresponds to the neck of the hourglass dispersion, while the Dirac chain gives rise to drumhead-like surface states near the Fermi level. Additionally, nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology leads to isolated Dirac surface states with helical spin textures that disperse across the Fermi level, forming an ideal platform for proximity-induced topological superconductivity. The coexistence of conventional bulk superconductivity, symmetry-protected hourglass topology, and helical spin-textured surface states establishes $M$IrGe as a rare and robust platform to realize topological superconductivity, opening new avenues for next-generation quantum technologies.

Abstract: Majorana zero modes in tunneling conductance are expected to manifest as robust zero bias peaks (ZBPs). While ZBPs alone are not conclusive evidence of Majorana modes due to alternative explanations, robust ZBPs remain a crucial and necessary first-step indicator in the search for topological states. Here, we report the observation of robust ZBPs in PbTe-Pb hybrid nanowires. The peak height can reach $2e^2/h$, though it does not yet form a quantized plateau. Importantly, these ZBPs can remain non-split over sizable ranges in both magnetic field and gate voltage scans, highlighting their robustness. We discuss possible interpretations based on Majorana zero modes as well as Andreev bound states.

Title: Predicting structure and swelling of microgels with different crosslinker concentrations combining machine-learning with numerical simulations
Authors: Susana Marín-Aguilar, Emanuela Zaccarelli
Abstract: Microgels made of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) are the prototype of soft, thermoresponsive particles widely used to study fundamental problems in condensed matter physics. However, their internal structure is far from homogeneous, and existing mean-field approaches, such as Flory-Rehner theory, provide only qualitative descriptions of their thermoresponsive behavior. Here, we combine machine learning and numerical simulations to accurately predict the concentration and spatial distribution of crosslinkers, the latter hitherto unknown experimentally, as well as the full swelling behavior of microgels, using only polymer density profiles. Our approach provides unprecedented insight into structural and thermodynamic properties of any standard microgel, including experimental ones.

Title: Effect of 3d Transition Metal Doping (Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) on the Electronic and Magnetic Properties of Pd Alloys at Low Impurity Concentrations: An Ab initio Study
Authors: Irina I. Piyanzina, Zarina I. Minnegulova, Regina M. Burganova, Oleg V. Nedopekin, Igor V. Yanilkin, Vasiliy S. Stolyarov, Amir I. Gumarov
Abstract: The nature of low-impurity ferromagnetism remains a challenging problem in the solid-state community. Despite initial experiments dating back to the mid-20th century, a comprehensive theoretical explanation and reliable ab initio evaluations have remained elusive. The present research aims to bridge this gap by refining first-principle calculations by elucidating the magnetic and electronic behavior of Pd1-xMx alloys (where M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni). Our study includes calculations of magnetic properties throughout the range of impurity concentrations, from 1 to 100 atomic percent (at.%), where we estimate critical concentrations and perform a comparative analysis for the listed alloys. Furthermore, electronic structure was analyzed, including the calculations of atomic, spin, and orbital-resolved states density, and exploration of the spatial formation of magnetic clusters containing ferromagnetic impurities across all concentration ranges.

Title: From surface Fermi arcs to Fermi loops in the Dirac semimetal Cd3As2
Authors: An-Qi Wang, Tong-Yang Zhao, Chuan Li, Alexander Brinkman, Chun-Guang Chu, Zhi-Min Liao
Abstract: Arc-like topological surface states, i.e., surface Fermi arcs, have long been recognized as the hallmark of Dirac semimetals. However, recent theories suggest that the surface Fermi arcs could evolve into closed Fermi loops, akin to surface states in topological insulators, while preserving the bulk Dirac semimetal phase. Here we experimentally reveal the evolution of Fermi arcs to Fermi loops in the surface-modified Dirac semimetal Cd3As2 nanoplate through gate voltage-dependent spin transport and quantum oscillation measurements. Surface modification, achieved by heavy metal atom deposition and water molecule adsorption, leads to an increase in the current-induced spin polarization at higher gate voltages, contrasting with the decrease observed in the pristine nanoplate. We also observe surface Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations with frequencies that scale linearly with gate voltage, aligning with a Fermi loop scenario. These findings indicate a transition from Fermi arcs to a closed Fermi loop in the surface-modified Cd3As2 nanoplate, consistent with the theoretically predicted fragile topological nature of Cd3As2. Our research offers profound insights into the transitions among these subtle topological states in Dirac semimetals, paving the way for manipulating topological surface states for high-performance spintronic devices.

Title: Two Channel Multi impurity Kondo model
Authors: A. M. Tsvelik, G. Kotliar
Abstract: We show that the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasua-Yoisida interaction in two channel Kondo impurity systems is a relevant perturbation when the number of impurities N is greater than 3. We find a new critical point with anomalous dimensions 1/(N+1) for the spin operator and the Sommerfeld coefficient of the specific heat scales as $\gamma \sim T^{- \frac{3}{N+1}} Inter-channel hybridization plays the role of the most relevant operator at this fixed point having anomalous dimensions (N-1)/(2N+2)$. The critical point universal properties are relevant to many strong correlation problems, such as impurity placed in a Majorana metal and the multichannel Kondo lattice model of heavy fermion materials. We discuss relevance of our results for cluster DMFT studies of quantum criticality.

Title: The Role of 11B4C Interlayers in Enhancing Fe/Si Multilayer Performance for Polarized Neutron Mirrors
Authors: Anton Zubayer, Fredrik Eriksson, Martin Falk, Marcus Lorentzon, Justinas Palisaitis, Christine Klauser, Gyula Nagy, Philipp M. Wolf, Eduardo Pitthan, Radek Holeňák, Daniel Primetzhofer, Gavin B.G. Stenning, Artur Glavic, Jochen Stahn, Samira Dorri, Per Eklund, Jens Birch, Naureen Ghafoor
Abstract: This study investigates the effects of incorporating 11B4C interlayers into Fe/Si multilayers, with a focus on interface quality, reflectivity, polarization, and magnetic properties for polarized neutron optics. It is found that the introduction of 1 Å and 2 Å 11B4C interlayers significantly improves the interface sharpness, reducing interface width and preventing excessive Si diffusion into the Fe layers. X-ray reflectivity and polarized neutron reflectivity measurements show enhanced reflectivity and polarization, with a notable increase in polarization for 30 Å period multilayers. The inclusion of interlayers also helps prevent the formation of iron-silicides, improving both the magnetic properties and neutron optical performance. However, the impact of interlayers is less pronounced in thicker-period multilayers (100 Å), primarily due to the ratio between layer and interface widths. These results suggest that 11B4C interlayers offer a promising route for optimizing Fe/Si multilayer performance in polarized neutron mirrors.

Title: Diminished spin-flip reflectivity in stacked multilayers with varying period thicknesses of Fe/Si by incorporating 11B4C
Authors: Anton Zubayer, Naureen Ghafoor, Anton Devishvili, Alexei Vorobiev, Artur Glavic, Jochen Stahn, Takayasu Hanashima, Jun Sugiyama, Vitor A. de Oliveira Lima, Jens Birch, Fredrik Eriksson
Abstract: This study investigates the effects of 11B4C co-sputtering on the structural and optical properties of Fe/Si stacked multilayers, with a focus on neutron supermirror applications. X-ray and neutron reflectivity techniques reveal that 11B4C incorporation improves interface sharpness, reduces roughness, and enhances reflectivity for all multilayer periods. Neutron reflectivity measurements show reduced spin-flip intensities, while wafer-curvature measurements indicate a 50% reduction in internal stress, allowing for higher mechanical stability of the multilayers. These improvements are attributed to the amorphization of Fe layers, which also suppress the formation of structural and magnetic domains responsible for stress and spin-flip scattering. In contrast, the pure Fe/Si sample exhibits a persistent half-order Bragg peak, indicating residual antiferromagnetic coupling. The results demonstrate that 11B4C enhances neutron optics by reducing spin-flip effects, increasing reflectivity and polarization, and alleviating stress, enabling the use of polarizers at reduced external fields compared to pure Fe/Si multilayers. These findings establish 11B4C as a transformative material for advancing neutron supermirror technology, paving the way for more efficient, stable, and high-performance polarizers in next-generation neutron optics.

Abstract: This study explores the impact of boron carbide (B4C) addition on magnetic domains within Fe/Si multilayers through off-specular neutron scattering with polarization analysis. The incorporation of B4C induces amorphization in layers, disrupting magnetic domain structures. Analysis of the scattering patterns reveals that magnetic domains in pure Fe/Si multilayers exhibit no significant correlation between layers, resulting in a specific diffuse off-specular scattering signal, while the B4C incorporated Fe/Si multilayers revealed no diffuse off-specular scattering. We offer a qualitative interpretation of these scattering phenomena and accurately model the observed diffuse patterns using the distorted wave Born approximation. Low-energy {\mu}+SR measurements further reveal that local magnetic fields in Fe/Si and Fe/Si + B4C multilayers are more easily manipulated by external fields in B4C-containing layers, with enhanced field uniformity in the muon length-scale. Our findings provide insights into the role of B4C in altering magnetic domain arrangements within Fe/Si multilayers, contributing to advances in the design of magnetic materials and neutron polarization coatings.

Title: Revealing Higher-Order Topological Bulk-boundary Correspondence in Bismuth Crystal with Spin-helical Hinge State Loop and Proximity Superconductivity
Authors: D.M.Zhao, Y. Zhong, T. Yuan, H.T. Wang, T.X. Jiang, Y. Qi, H.J. Xiang, X.G. Gong, D.L. Feng, T. Zhang
Abstract: Topological materials are typically characterized by gapless boundary states originated from nontrivial bulk band topology, known as topological bulk-boundary correspondence. Recently, this fundamental concept has been generalized in higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs). E.g., a second-order three-dimensional (3D) TI hosts one-dimensional (1D) topological hinge states winding around the crystal. However, a complete verification of higher-order topology is still lacking as it requires probing all the crystal boundaries. Here we studied a promising candidate of second-order TI, bismuth (Bi), in the form of mesoscopic crystals grown on superconducting V3Si. Using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy, we directly observed dispersive 1D states on various hinges of the crystal. Upon introducing magnetic scatterers, new scattering channels emerged selectively on certain hinges, revealing their spin-helical nature. Combining first-principle calculation and global symmetry analysis, we find these hinge states are topological and formed a closed loop encircling the crystal. This provides direct evidence on the higher-order topology in Bi. Moreover, proximity superconductivity is observed in the topological hinge states, enabling HOTI as a promising platform for realizing topological superconductivity and Majorana quasiparticles.

Abstract: Estimating entropy production, which quantifies irreversibility and energy dissipation, remains a significant challenge despite its central role in nonequilibrium physics. We propose a novel method for estimating the mean entropy production rate $\sigma$ that relies solely on position traces, bypassing the need for flux or microscopic force measurements. Starting from a recently introduced variance sum rule, we express $\sigma$ in terms of measurable steady-state correlation functions which we link to previously studied kinetic quantities, known as traffic and inflow rate. Under realistic constraints of limited access to dynamical degrees of freedom, we derive efficient bounds on $\sigma$ by leveraging the information contained in the system's traffic, enabling partial but meaningful estimates of $\sigma$. We benchmark our results across several orders of magnitude in $\sigma$ using two models: a linear stochastic system and a nonlinear model for spontaneous hair-bundle oscillations. Our approach offers a practical and versatile framework for investigating entropy production in nonequilibrium systems.

Title: Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking of Cavity Vacuum and Emergent Gyrotropic Effects in Embedded moiré Superlattices
Authors: Zuzhang Lin, Hsun-Chi Chan, Wenqi Yang, Yixin Sha, Cong Xiao, Shuang Zhang, Wang Yao
Abstract: In an electronic system, spontaneous symmetry breaking can arise from many-body interaction between electrons, leading to degenerate ground states distinguishable by emergent effects otherwise prohibited by the symmetry. Here we show that ultrastrong coupling of a mesoscopic electronic system to the vacuum of a cavity resonator can lead to another paradigm of spontaneous breaking of spatial symmetries in both systems. As a pertinent example, we consider the orbital gyrotropic effects in a moiré superlattice embedded in a THz split ring cavity resonator. Our mean-field and exact diagonalization calculations consistently demonstrate a spontaneous parity symmetry breaking in both the electronic ground state and the cavity vacuum, leading to two degenerate hybrid ground states distinguished by their opposite orbital gyrotropic Hall and magnetic effects. These sizable responses in the cavity-embedded moiré superlattice are highly tunable by both the cavity field polarization and interlayer bias on the moiré superlattice, providing an advanced platform for manipulating gyrotropic effects.

Title: Coherent control of ac-driven quantum transport and minimal excitations in the fractional quantum Hall effect
Authors: Imen Taktak, Ines Safi
Abstract: We investigate the challenges of achieving minimal excitations in the fractional quantum Hall effect and addressing Hong-Ou-Mandel -type setups under ac drives when the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid description is adopted. We apply the unifying non-equilibrium perturbative approach to weak backscattering through a quantum point contact in a two or three terminal geometry such as the "anyon collider". We show that the photoassisted noise is always higher than the photoassisted current, thus is super-Poissonian. This is an alternative theorem to Levitov's one, violated in the TLL model, thus questioning the expression "photoassisted". In the two-terminal geometry, we analyze carefully the validity domain of the perturbative approach and the possibility to achieve the quantum regime close to frequency locking, where singularities give access to the fractional charge. Then we show the persistence of equilibrium contributions to photoassisted noise that prevent access to zero-temperature and Poissonian limits under Lorentzian pulses. Furthermore, we demonstrate that prior works on similar setups, as well as "Leviton crystallization" where the zero-temperature limit is inappropriate, may be unreliable. Our findings are also applicable to Hall interferometers, coherent conductors, and Josephson or phase-slip junctions strongly coupled to an ohmic environment under an ac bias.

Title: The impact of hole $g$-factor anisotropy on spin-photon entanglement generation with InGaAs quantum dots
Authors: P. R. Ramesh, E. Annoni, N. Margaria, D. A. Fioretto, A. Pishchagin, M. Morassi, A. Lemaître, M. F. Doty, P. Senellart, L. Lanco, N. Belabas, S. C. Wein, O. Krebs
Abstract: Self-assembled InGaAs/GaAs quantum dots (QDs) are of particular importance for the deterministic generation of spin-photon entanglement. One promising scheme relies on the Larmor precession of a spin in a transverse magnetic field, which is governed by the in-plane $g$-factors of the electron and valence band heavy-hole. We probe the origin of heavy-hole $g$-factor anisotropy with respect to the in-plane magnetic field direction and uncover how it impacts the entanglement generated between the spin and the photon polarization. First, using polarization-resolved photoluminescence measurements on a single QD, we determine that the impact of valence-band mixing dominates over effects due to a confinement-renormalized cubic Luttinger $q$ parameter. From this, we construct a comprehensive hole $g$-tensor model. We then use this model to simulate the concurrence and fidelity of spin-photon entanglement generation with anisotropic hole $g$-factors, which can be tuned via magnetic field angle and excitation polarization. The results demonstrate that post-growth control of the hole $g$-factor can be used to improve spin-photon cluster state generation.

Title: Classification of Gapped Domain Walls of Topological Orders in 2+1 dimensions: A Levin-Wen Model Realization
Authors: Yanyan Chen, Siyuan Wang, Yu Zhao, Yuting Hu, Yidun Wan
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel systematic construction of gapped domain walls (GDWs) within the Levin-Wen (LW) model, advancing our understanding of topological phases. By gluing two LW models along their open sides in a compatible way, we achieve a complete GDW classification by subsets of bulk input data, encompassing $e$-$m$ exchanging GDWs. A generalized bimodule structure is introduced to capture domain-wall excitations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that folding along any GDW yields a gapped boundary (GB) described by a Frobenius algebra of the input UFC for the folded model, thus bridging GDW and GB classifications within a unified framework.

Title: Theory of Generalized Hertzian Hyperspheres
Authors: Ulf R. Pedersen
Abstract: While hard-sphere models form the foundation of theoretical condensed matter physics, real systems often exhibit some degree of softness. We present a theoretical and numerical study of a class of nearly hard-sphere systems, generalized Hertzian hyperspheres, where particles interact via a finite-range repulsive potential that allows slight overlaps. Well-studied examples of this class include particles with harmonic repulsions, Hertzian spheres, and Hertzian disks. We derive closed-form expressions for thermodynamic properties, coexistence pressures, and scaling laws governing structure and dynamics. The theory predicts how quantities scale with temperature, density, spatial dimension, and potential softness. These theoretical predictions are tested through numerical simulations in dimensions ranging from one to eight.

Title: Tomographic Signatures of Interacting Majorana and Andreev States in Superconductor-Semiconductor Transmon Qubits
Authors: Daniel Dahan, Konstantin Yavilberg, Talya Shnaider, Elena Lupo, Malcolm R. Connolly, Eran Ginossar, Eytan Grosfeld
Abstract: Semiconductor-based Josephson junctions embedded within a Cooper-pair-box can host complex many-body states, such as interacting Andreev states and potentially other quasi-particles of topological origin. Here, we study the insights that could be revealed from a tomographic reconstruction of the Cooper-pair charge distribution of the junction prepared in its ground state. We posit that interacting and topological states can be identified from distinct signatures within the probability distribution of the charge states. Furthermore, the comprehensive dataset provides direct access to information theory metrics elucidating the entanglement between the charge sector of the superconductor and the microscopic degrees of freedom in the junction. We demonstrate how these metrics serve to further classify differences between the types of excitations in the junction.

Title: Revisiting Phase Transitions of Yttrium: Insights from Density Functional Theory
Authors: Paras Patel, Madhavi H. Dalsaniya, Saurav Patel, Dominik Kurzydłowski, Krzysztof J. Kurzydłowski, Prafulla K. Jha
Abstract: Understanding the mechanism of structural phase transitions in rare-earth elements is a fundamental challenge in condensed matter physics, with significant implications for materials science applications. In this study, we present a systematic investigation on the phase transitions of yttrium under low-pressure conditions ($<$30 GPa) focusing on the hcp, Sm-type, and dhcp phases. A comparative analysis of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and meta-GGA functionals reveals that the PBE-GGA functional significantly underestimates the phase transition pressures, whereas the r$^2$SCAN functional provides accurate predictions of phase transition pressures which are in excellent agreement with experimental data. The results confirm that the phase transitions in yttrium are driven by vibrational instabilities, as evidenced by the emergence of soft acoustic modes in the phonon dispersion curves for the hcp and Sm-type phase. Elastic properties calculations further confirm mechanical softening at the phase boundaries, particularly in the hcp phase, suggesting a strong correlation between elastic instability and structural transitions. These findings suggest that the emergence of soft modes in the phonon dispersion curves might be a key factor driving the structural phase transition in the rare earth materials.

Title: Adsorption Behavior of Greenhouse Gases on Carbon Nanobelts: A Semi-Empirical Tight-Binding Approach for Environmental Application
Authors: C. Aguiar, I. Camps
Abstract: This research investigates the adsorption characteristics of carbon nanobelts (CNB) and Mobius carbon nanobelts (MCNB) interacting with various greenhouse gases, including NH3, CO2, CO, H2S, CH4, CH3OH, NO2, NO, and COCl2. The study employs semi-empirical tight-binding calculations via xTB software, complemented by topological analysis using MULTIWFN software. Comparative analysis reveals MCNB's superior adsorption properties, particularly for specific gases. Notable adsorption energies for MCNB were measured at -1.595eV, -0.669eV, and -0.637eV for NO, COCl2, and NO2, respectively, significantly exceeding the corresponding CNB values of -0.636eV, -0.449eV, and -0.438eV. The investigation of desorption kinetics demonstrates rapid recovery times (sub-millisecond) for most gas-nanobelt interactions, with the notable exception of the MCNB+NO system, which exhibits persistent bonding. Topological analysis confirms chemisorption mechanisms for NO, COCl2, and NO2 on both nanobelt variants, characterized by complex hybridizations of covalent and non-covalent interactions. Molecular dynamics simulations conducted in both packed configurations and dry air mixtures demonstrate the nanobelts' effective gas-attracting properties, maintaining consistent capture performance across different environmental conditions. These findings establish carbon nanobelts, particularly the Mobius configuration, as promising candidates for greenhouse gas capture technologies, offering potential applications in environmental remediation and climate change mitigation strategies.

Title: Hydrodynamic stresses in a multi-species suspension of active Janus colloids
Authors: Gennaro Tucci, Giulia Pisegna, Ramin Golestanian, Suropriya Saha
Abstract: A realistic description of active particles should include interactions with the medium, commonly a momentum-conserving simple fluid, in which they are suspended. In this work, we consider a multi-species suspension of self-diffusiophoretic Janus colloids interacting via chemical and hydrodynamic fields. Through a systematic coarse-graining of the microscopic dynamics, we calculate the multi-component contribution to the hydrodynamic stress tensor of the incompressible Stokesian fluid in which the particles are immersed. For a single species, we find that the strength of the stress produced by the gradients of the number density field is determined by the particles' self-propulsion and chemotactic alignment, and can be tuned to be either contractile or extensile. For a multi-species system, we unveil how different forms of activity modify the stress tensor, and how non-reciprocity in hydrodynamic interactions emerges in an active binary mixture.

Title: Global Structure in the Presence of a Topological Defect
Authors: Arun Debray, Weicheng Ye, Matthew Yu
Abstract: We investigate the global structure of topological defects which wrap a submanifold $F\subset M$ in a quantum field theory defined on a closed manifold $M$. The Pontryagin-Thom construction oversees the interplay between the global structure of $F$ and the global structure of $M$. We will employ this construction to two distinct mathematical frameworks with physical applications. The first framework is the concept of a characteristic structure, consisting of the data of pairs of manifolds $(M,F)$ where $F$ is Poincaré dual to some characteristic class. This concept is discussed in the mathematics literature, and shown here to have meaningful physical interpretations related to defects. In our examples we will mainly focus on the case where $M$ is 4-dimensional and $F$ has codimension 2. The second framework uses obstruction theory and the fact that spontaneously broken finite symmetries leave behind domain walls, to determine the conditions on which dimensions a higher-form finite symmetry can spontaneously break. We explicitly study the cases of higher-form $\mathbb Z/2$ symmetry, but the method can be generalized to other groups.

Title: Honegumi: An Interface for Accelerating the Adoption of Bayesian Optimization in the Experimental Sciences
Authors: Sterling G. Baird, Andrew R. Falkowski, Taylor D. Sparks
Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) has emerged as a powerful tool for guiding experimental design and decision- making in various scientific fields, including materials science, chemistry, and biology. However, despite its growing popularity, the complexity of existing BO libraries and the steep learning curve associated with them can deter researchers who are not well-versed in machine learning or programming. To address this barrier, we introduce Honegumi, a user-friendly, interactive tool designed to simplify the process of creating advanced Bayesian optimization scripts. Honegumi offers a dynamic selection grid that allows users to configure key parameters of their optimization tasks, generating ready-to-use, unit-tested Python scripts tailored to their specific needs. Accompanying the interface is a comprehensive suite of tutorials that provide both conceptual and practical guidance, bridging the gap between theoretical understanding and practical implementation. Built on top of the Ax platform, Honegumi leverages the power of existing state-of-the-art libraries while restructuring the user experience to make advanced BO techniques more accessible to experimental researchers. By lowering the barrier to entry and providing educational resources, Honegumi aims to accelerate the adoption of advanced Bayesian optimization methods across various domains.

Title: CAST: Cross Attention based multimodal fusion of Structure and Text for materials property prediction
Authors: Jaewan Lee, Changyoung Park, Hongjun Yang, Sungbin Lim, Sehui Han
Abstract: Recent advancements in AI have revolutionized property prediction in materials science and accelerating material discovery. Graph neural networks (GNNs) stand out due to their ability to represent crystal structures as graphs, effectively capturing local interactions and delivering superior predictions. However, these methods often lose critical global information, such as crystal systems and repetitive unit connectivity. To address this, we propose CAST, a cross-attention-based multimodal fusion model that integrates graph and text modalities to preserve essential material information. CAST combines node- and token-level features using cross-attention mechanisms, surpassing previous approaches reliant on material-level embeddings like graph mean-pooling or [CLS] tokens. A masked node prediction pretraining strategy further enhances atomic-level information integration. Our method achieved up to 22.9\% improvement in property prediction across four crystal properties including band gap compared to methods like CrysMMNet and MultiMat. Pretraining was key to aligning node and text embeddings, with attention maps confirming its effectiveness in capturing relationships between nodes and tokens. This study highlights the potential of multimodal learning in materials science, paving the way for more robust predictive models that incorporate both local and global information.

Title: Critically slow Hilbert-space ergodicity in quantum morphic drives
Authors: Saúl Pilatowsky-Cameo, Soonwon Choi, Wen Wei Ho
Abstract: The maximum entropy principle is foundational for statistical analyses of complex dynamics. This principle has been challenged by the findings of a previous work [Phys. Rev. X 7, 031034 (2017)], where it was argued that a quantum system driven in time by a certain aperiodic sequence without any explicit symmetries, dubbed the Thue-Morse drive, gives rise to emergent nonergodic steady states which are underpinned by effective conserved quantities. Here, we resolve this apparent tension. We rigorously prove that the Thue-Morse drive achieves a very strong notion of quantum ergodicity in the long-time limit: the time evolution of any initial state uniformly visits every corner of its Hilbert space. On the other hand, we find the dynamics also approximates a Floquet drive for arbitrarily long albeit finite periods of time with no characteristic timescale, resulting in a scale-free ergodic dynamics we call critically slow complete Hilbert-space ergodicity (CS-CHSE). Furthermore, numerical studies reveal that CS-CHSE is not specific to the Thue-Morse drive and is in fact exhibited by many other aperiodic drives derived from morphic sequences, i.e., words derived from repeatedly applying substitution rules on basic characters. Our work presents a new class of dynamics in time-dependent quantum systems where full ergodicity is eventually attained, but only after astronomically long times.

Title: Gradient Flows and the Curvature of Theory Space
Authors: William H. Pannell, Andreas Stergiou
Abstract: The metric and potential associated with the gradient property of renormalisation group flow in multiscalar models in $d=4-\varepsilon$ dimensions are studied. The metric is identified with the Zamolodchikov metric of nearly marginal operators on the sphere. An explicit form for the associated Ricci scalar in $d=4-\varepsilon$ is derived, which shows that the space of multiscalar field theories is curved. The potential is identified with a quantity $\widetilde{F}$ that was previously proposed as a weakly monotonic function interpolating between the $a$-theorem in four dimensions and the $F$-theorem in three dimensions. This implies that the $\widetilde{F}$-theorem can be extended perturbatively to a theorem about gradient flow in $d=4-\varepsilon$.

Title: Spin dependent fluorescence mediated by anti-symmetric exchange in triplet exciton pairs
Authors: Yan Sun, M. Monteverde, V. Derkach, T. Chaneliere, E. Aldridge, J. E. Anthony, A.D. Chepelianskii
Abstract: Singlet fission and triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA) are spin-dependent phenomena critical to optoelectronics. The dynamics of spin populations during geminate triplet pair separation are crucial for controlling fission and TTA rates. We show that the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) induces level crossings between spin manifolds, affecting spin populations and TTA rates in crystalline fission semiconductors. By investigating spin-dependent fluorescence in a triplet exciton pair with the magnetic field aligned along the fine structure tensor, we isolate the effect of DMI, as the triplet wavefunctions remain unaffected by the field. Our results reveal that DMI introduces additional TTA pathways that are forbidden by spin conservation, explaining the observed evolution of optically detected magnetic resonance signals with varying magnetic field. This study highlights the significant impact of DMI on the optical properties of triplet excitons, advancing our understanding of spin dynamics in these systems.

Title: Fingerprint Matrix Concept for Detecting, Localizing and Characterizing Targets in Complex Media
Authors: Arthur Le Ber, Antton Goïcoechea, Lukas M. Rachbauer, William Lambert, Xiaoping Jia, Mathias Fink, Arnaud Tourin, Stefan Rotter, Alexandre Aubry
Abstract: As waves propagate through a complex medium, they undergo multiple scattering events. This phenomenon is detrimental to imaging, as it causes a full blurring of the image beyond a transport mean free path. Here, we show how to detect, localize, and characterize any scattering target through the reflection matrix of the complex medium in which this target is embedded and thus hidden from direct view. More precisely, we introduce a fingerprint operator that contains the specific signature of the target with respect to its environment. Applied to the recorded reflection matrix, this operator provides a likelihood index of the target in any given state, despite the scattering fog induced by the surrounding environment. This state can be the target position for localization purposes, its shape for characterization, or any other parameter that influences the target response. Our concept is versatile and broadly applicable to different type of waves for which multi-element technology allows a reflection matrix to be measured. We demonstrate this here explicitly by performing different proof-of-concept experiments with ultrasound on targets buried inside a strongly scattering granular suspension, on lesion markers for clinical applications, and on the architecture of muscle tissue.

Title: Individual particle persistence antagonizes global ordering in populations of nematically-aligning self-propelled particles
Authors: Josué Manik Nava-Sedeño, Rainer Klages, Haralampos Hatzikirou, Andreas Deutsch
Abstract: The transition from individual to collective motion plays a significant role in many biological processes. While the implications of different types of particle-particle interactions for the emergence of particular modes of collective motion have been well studied, it is unclear how particular types of individual migration patterns influence collective motion. Here, motivated by swarming bacteria Myxococcus xanthus, we investigate the combined effects of the individual pattern of migration and of particle-particle interactions, on the emergence of collective migration. We analyze the effects of a feature of individual pattern migration, the persistence of motion, on the collective properties of the system that emerge from interactions among individuals; in particular, when nematic velocity alignment interaction mediates collective dynamics. We find, through computer simulations and mathematical analysis, that an initially disordered migratory state can become globally ordered by increasing either, the particle-particle alignment interaction strength or the persistence of individual migration. In contrast, we find that persistence prevents the emergence of global nematic order when both persistence and nematic alignment are comparatively high. We conclude that behavior at the population level does not only depend on interactions between individuals but also on the individuals' own intrinsic behavior.

Title: Does Entanglement Correlation in Ground State Guarantee Quantum Energy Teleportation?
Authors: Taisanul Haque
Abstract: Although extraction of energy from the ground state is forbidden, one can utilize Quantum Energy Teleportation (QET) protocol for energy extraction -- a two-step protocol involving quantum measurements followed by LOCC. This is an unique method to ``extract energy from ground states'' of quantum systems. QET requires some correlation in the ground state, and entanglement correlation plays a crucial roles as a resource. The general belief is that if the ground state is quantum-correlated via entanglement for two different sites in a quantum system, and if we perform measurements on one of the sites, we can find an LOCC for the other site to successfully accomplish QET. In this paper, we show that this belief may not be true in the case of the Toric Code. We demonstrate this by performing a PVM measurements on spins in the Toric Code. Based on the measurement outcomes, we found that there is no LOCC for successful QET.

Title: Mixed-state geometric phases of coherent and squeezed spin states
Authors: Xin Wang, Jia-Chen Tang, Xu-Yang Hou, Hao Guo, Chih-Chun Chien
Abstract: Two mixed-state geometric phases, known as the Uhlmann phase and interferometric phase (IGP), of spin coherent states (CSSs) and spin squeezed states (SSSs) are analyzed. While each phase follows its parallel-transport condition, we also consider the non-adiabatic IGP for arbitrary unitary evolution beyond parallel transport. For the $j=3/2$ CSS, the Uhlmann phase shows temperature-induced topological phase transitions with jumps. The IGP and non-adiabatic IGP for the $j=3/2$ CSS also exhibits temperature-induced jumps. In contrast, the Uhlmann phase of the $j=1$ SSS exhibits smooth behavior without any temperature-induced transition. Interestingly, the parallel-transport condition of the IGP of the $j=1$ SSS in general does not allow a solution at finite temperature. Instead, the non-adiabatic IGP for the $j=1$ SSS has a solution showing smooth behavior as the squeezing parameter and temperature change. We also briefly discuss possible experimental implications and simulations.

Title: Scrambling Enabled Entropy Accumulation in Open Quantum Systems
Authors: Yuke Zhang, Zeyu Liu, Shuo Zhang, Langxuan Chen, Pengfei Zhang
Abstract: In closed quantum many-body systems, initially localized information spreads throughout the system and becomes highly complex. This phenomenon, known as information scrambling, is closely related to entropy growth and quantum thermalization. Recent studies have shown that dissipation in open systems can hinder information scrambling, driving the system into a dissipative phase when the system-bath coupling is strong. However, the signature of this scrambling transition in entropy dynamics remains unexplored. In this work, we unveil a novel phenomenon in open quantum systems, termed entropy accumulation, which occurs exclusively within the scrambling phase. We consider a setup in which a probe is weakly coupled to a system that is already interacting with a bath. We calculate the increase in the second Rényi entropy induced by an external impulse on the system, after tracing out the probe. Despite the system-probe coupling being weak, the entropy continues to increase and eventually saturates at a finite value due to operator growth. In contrast, the entropy increase is limited by the coupling strength in the dissipative phase. The theoretical prediction is derived from both general arguments and an explicit example using generalized Boltzmann equations. Our results offer new insights into the intriguing relationship between entropy dynamics and information scrambling in open quantum systems.

Title: Evolution of cooperation in a bimodal mixture of conditional cooperators
Authors: Chenyang Zhao, Xinshi Feng, Guozhong Zheng, Weiran Cai, Jiqiang Zhang, Li Chen
Abstract: Extensive behavioral experiments reveal that conditional cooperation is a prevalent phenomenon. Previous game-theoretical studies have predominantly relied on hard-manner models, where cooperation is triggered only upon reaching a specific threshold. However, this approach contrasts with the observed flexibility of human behavior, where individuals adapt their strategies dynamically based on their surroundings. To capture this adaptability, we introduce a soft form of conditional cooperation by integrating the Q-learning algorithm from reinforcement learning. In this framework, players not only reciprocate mutual cooperation but may also defect in highly cooperative environments or cooperate in less cooperative settings to maximize rewards. To explore the effects of hard and soft conditional cooperators, we examine their interactions in two scenarios: structural mixture (SM) and probabilistic mixture (PM), where the two behavioral modes are fixed and probabilistically adopted, respectively. In SM, hard conditional cooperators enhance cooperation when the threshold is low but hinder it otherwise. Surprisingly, in PM, the cooperation prevalence exhibits two first-order phase transitions as the probability is varied, leading to high, low, and vanishing levels of cooperation. Analysis of Q-tables offers insights into the "psychological shifts" of soft conditional cooperators and the overall evolutionary dynamics. Model extensions confirm the robustness of our findings. These results highlight the novel complexities arising from the diversity of conditional cooperators.

Title: Noise Effects on Diabatic Quantum Annealing Protocols
Authors: Giulia Salatino, Maximilian Matzler, Annarita Scocco, Procolo Lucignano, Gianluca Passarelli
Abstract: Diabatic quantum annealing aims to mitigate the challenges posed by small energy gaps and decoherence in quantum optimization by exploiting nonadiabatic transitions. In this paper, we compare the performance of two diabatic protocols in a realistic, dissipative setting using the maximum weighted independent set problem as a test case, showing that the potential advantages of diabatic protocols are strongly reduced in the presence of dissipation. Our results highlight the importance of evaluating quantum annealing strategies under practical conditions.

Title: Quantum dynamics of a spin model with an extensive degeneracy
Authors: Krishanu Ghosh, Diptiman Sen, K. Sengupta
Abstract: We study the role played by extensive degeneracy in shaping the nature of the quantum dynamics of a one-dimensional spin model for both ramp and periodic drive protocols. The model displays an extensive degenerate manifold of states for a specific value of one of the parameters of its Hamiltonian. We study a linear ramp which takes the spin model through this degenerate point and show that it leads to a deviation from the usual Kibble-Zurek behavior. We also study the Stückelberg oscillations in such a model for a ramp which passes twice through the degenerate point. Our study indicates that such oscillations are strongly suppressed leading to a distinct behavior compared to those arising from double passage through a quantum critical point. Finally, we study the periodic dynamics of the model and show, for a large drive amplitude, the existence of special drive frequencies at which the system exhibits an approximate emergent $U(1)$ symmetry. We study the effect of this emergent symmetry on the correlators of the driven system and demonstrate the existence of dynamic symmetry restoration at these frequencies. We study the fate of the emergent symmetry when the drive amplitude is decreased and discuss possible experiments to test our theory.

Title: Low thermal noise mirror coatings utilising titanium dioxide and germanium dioxide mixtures

Abstract: Upgrades to ground-based gravitational-wave observatories will require mirror coatings with reduced thermal noise, enabling improved detector sensitivity and extended astrophysical reach. Recent studies have shown that optical coatings utilising amorphous materials that exhibit a larger fraction of corner-sharing between adjacent structural units of metal-centered polyhedra are a promising route for reducing mechanical dissipation and thus thermal noise at room temperature. We report on multilayer optical coatings that are fabricated using germanium dioxide mixed with titanium dioxide (TiO$_2$:GeO$_2$) for the high index layers, and silicon dioxide (SiO$_2$) for the low index material. Single layers of TiO$_2$:GeO$_2$ are characterised to optimise the mixture proportion and based on that highly reflective multilayer stacks were deposited. Exceptional optical absorption at 1064 nm below 1 part-per-million (ppm) is observed in the multilayer stacks after heat treatment. The annealing process also induces the formation of blisters which leads to increased optical scattering. However, there is indication that blisters can be suppressed by decreasing the water partial pressure in the deposition chamber. Direct thermal noise measurements provide experimental verification of a significant 25\% reduction of thermal noise over the mirrors currently employed, which combined with sub-ppm levels of optical absorption show the potential of TiO$_2$:GeO$_2$ to improve the sensitivity of gravitational-wave observatories.

Title: Materials and spin characteristics of amino-terminated nanodiamonds embedded with nitrogen-vacancy color centers
Authors: Nikoletta Jegenyes, Vladimir Verkhovlyuk, Szabolcs Czene, Attila Csáki, Olga Krafcsik, Zsolt Czigány, David Beke, Adam Gali
Abstract: Understanding and controlling fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) with optically read qubits is a key focus of research, as they show high potential for detecting electric and magnetic fields, temperature, and other physico-chemical quantities at the nanoscale, which are highly sought after in chemistry and biology. Proper functionalization of FNDs is required for their application as probes in chemical and biological processes. However, modifying the surface of FNDs can affect the properties of qubit sensors. In this work, we thoroughly study the fundamental properties of embedded nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers as a function of FND size and surface termination. The FNDs were produced by milling high-pressure, high-temperature diamonds, and NV centers were introduced via electron beam irradiation and annealing. In particular, the initial FNDs, covered with various oxygen groups, were homogenized through a reduction process to predominantly cover them with alcohol ($-$OH) groups as reference FNDs. Additionally, a Hofmann degradation process was applied to terminate FNDs with amine ($-$NH$_2$) groups, enabling direct linkage of proteins and other biomolecules to the FNDs. We monitored the charge state stability upon illumination, the zero-field splitting parameters, and the longitudinal spin-relaxation time of the NV centers in these FNDs. Our findings indicate that charge state stabilization of the NV centers was achieved in both $-$OH- and $-$NH$_2$-terminated FNDs beyond a certain FND size. Furthermore, we demonstrate that $-$NH$_2$-terminated FNDs embedding NV centers exhibit a $T_1$ longitudinal relaxation time of approximately 25~$\mu$s, independent of FND size within the studied range of 10~nm to 140~nm. This relaxation time is comparable to that of larger-sized reference FNDs.

Title: A proposal for charge basis tomography of superconducting qubits
Authors: Elena Lupo, Daniel Long, Daniel Dahan, Konstantin Yavilberg, Malcolm R. Connolly, Eytan Grosfeld, Eran Ginossar
Abstract: We introduce a general protocol for obtaining the charge basis density matrix of a superconducting quantum circuit. Inspired by cavity state tomography, our protocol combines Josephson-energy pulse sequences and projective charge-basis readout to access the off-diagonal elements of the density matrix, a scheme we thus dub charge basis tomography. We simulate the reconstruction of the ground state of a target transmon using the Aharonov-Casher effect in a probe qubit to realise projective readout and show the Hilbert-Schmidt distance can detect deviations from the correct model Hamiltonian. Unlocking this ability to validate models using the ground state sets the stage for using transmons to detect interacting and topological phases, particularly in materials where time-domain and spectroscopic probes can be limited by intrinsic noise.

Title: Directly imaging spin polarons in a kinetically frustrated Hubbard system
Authors: Max L. Prichard, Benjamin M. Spar, Ivan Morera, Eugene Demler, Zoe Z. Yan, Waseem S. Bakr
Abstract: The emergence of quasiparticles in quantum many-body systems underlies the rich phenomenology in many strongly interacting materials. In the context of doped Mott insulators, magnetic polarons are quasiparticles that usually arise from an interplay between the kinetic energy of doped charge carriers and superexchange spin interactions. However, in kinetically frustrated lattices, itinerant spin polarons - bound states of a dopant and a spin-flip - have been theoretically predicted even in the absence of superexchange coupling. Despite their important role in the theory of kinetic magnetism, a microscopic observation of these polarons is lacking. Here we directly image itinerant spin polarons in a triangular lattice Hubbard system realised with ultracold atoms, revealing enhanced antiferromagnetic correlations in the local environment of a hole dopant. In contrast, around a charge dopant, we find ferromagnetic correlations, a manifestation of the elusive Nagaoka effect. We study the evolution of these correlations with interactions and doping, and use higher-order correlation functions to further elucidate the relative contributions of superexchange and kinetic mechanisms. The robustness of itinerant spin polarons at high temperature paves the way for exploring potential mechanisms for hole pairing and superconductivity in frustrated systems. Furthermore, our work provides microscopic insights into related phenomena in triangular lattice moiré materials.

Abstract: Current semiconductor qubits rely either on the spin or on the charge degree of freedom to encode quantum information. By contrast, in bilayer graphene the valley degree of freedom, stemming from the crystal lattice symmetry, is a robust quantum number that can therefore be harnessed for this purpose. The simplest implementation of a valley qubit would rely on two states with opposite valleys as in the case of a single-carrier bilayer graphene quantum dot immersed in a small perpendicular magnetic field ($B_\perp\lesssim 100$mT). However, the single-carrier quantum dot excited states spectrum has not been resolved to date in the relevant magnetic field range. Here, we fill this gap, by measuring the parallel and perpendicular magnetic field dependence of this spectrum with an unprecedented resolution of $4\mu$eV. We use a time-resolved charge detection technique that gives us access to individual tunnel events. Our results come as a direct verification of the predicted spectrum and establish a new upper-bound on inter-valley mixing, equal to our energy resolution. Our charge detection technique opens the door to measuring the relaxation time of a valley qubit in a single-carrier bilayer graphene quantum dot.

Title: Flat-Band Enhanced Antiferromagnetic Fluctuations and Superconductivity in Pressurized CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$
Authors: Siqi Wu, Chenchao Xu, Xiaoqun Wang, Hai-Qing Lin, Chao Cao, Guang-Han Cao
Abstract: The spin dynamics and electronic orders of the kagome system at different filling levels stand as an intriguing subject in condensed matter physics. By first-principles calculations and random phase approximation analyses, we investigate the spin fluctuations and superconducting instabilities in kagome phase of CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$ under high pressure. At the filling level slightly below the kagome flat bands, our calculations reveal strong antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations in CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$, together with a leading $s_{\pm}$-wave and a competing ($d_{xy}$, $d_{x^2-y^2}$)-wave superconducting order. Unlike the general intuition that the flat bands are closely related to the ferromagnetic correlations, here we propose a sublattice-momentum-coupling-driven mechanism for the antiferromagnetic fluctuations enhanced from the unoccupied flat bands. The mechanism is generally applicable to kagome systems where the Fermi level intersects near the flat bands, offering a new perspective for future studies of geometrically frustrated systems.

Title: Advancements in Secondary and Backscattered Electron Energy Spectra and Yields Analysis: from Theory to Applications
Authors: Simone Taioli, Maurizio Dapor
Abstract: Over the past decade, experimental microscopy and spectroscopy have made significant progress in the study of the morphological, optical, electronic and transport properties of materials. These developments include higher spatial resolution, shorter acquisition times, more efficient monochromators and electron analysers, improved contrast imaging and advancements in sample preparation techniques. These advances have driven the need for more accurate theoretical descriptions and predictions of material properties. Computer simulations based on first principles and Monte Carlo methods have emerged as a rapidly growing field for modeling the interaction of charged particles, such as electron, proton and ion beams, with various systems, such as slabs, nanostructures and crystals. This report delves into the theoretical and computational approaches to modeling the physico-chemical mechanisms that occur when charged beams interact with a medium. These mechanisms encompass single and collective electronic excitation, ionization of the target atoms and the generation of a secondary electron cascade that deposits energy into the irradiated material. We show that the combined application of ab initio methods, which are able to model the dynamics of interacting many-fermion systems, and Monte Carlo methods, which capture statistical fluctuations in energy loss mechanisms by random sampling, proves to be an optimal strategy for the accurate description of charge transport in solids. This joint quantitative approach enables the theoretical interpretation of excitation, loss and secondary electron spectra, the analysis of the chemical composition and dielectric properties of solids and contributes to our understanding of irradiation-induced damage in materials, including those of biological significance.

Title: Phenomenology of many-body localization in bond-disordered spin chains
Authors: Adith Sai Aramthottil, Piotr Sierant, Maciej Lewenstein, Jakub Zakrzewski
Abstract: Many-body localization (MBL) hinders the thermalization of quantum many-body systems in the presence of strong disorder. In this work, we study the MBL regime in bond-disordered spin-1/2 XXZ spin chain, finding the multimodal distribution of entanglement entropy in eigenstates, sub-Poissonian level statistics, and revealing a relation between operators and initial states required for examining the breakdown of thermalization in the time evolution of the system. We employ a real space renormalization group scheme to identify these phenomenological features of the MBL regime that extend beyond the standard picture of local integrals of motion relevant for systems with disorder coupled to on-site operators. Our results pave the way for experimental probing of MBL in bond-disordered spin chains.

Title: Energy Window Augmented Plane Waves (EWAPW)
Authors: Garry Goldstein
Abstract: In this work we present a new basis set for electronic structure calculations of crystalline solids aimed at applications to Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods. In this construction we take advantage of the fact that most DFT calculations use a convergence loop in order to obtain the eigenstates of a final Khon Sham (KS) Hamiltonian matrix - that is iterate till the eigenstates of the KS Hamiltonian matrix also give the appropriate electron density needed to obtain the KS potential needed for that KS Hamiltonian matrix. Here we propose that, for the basis used at each step of the iteration, we use the previous eigenstate basis, in the interstitial region, but augmented inside the MT sphere with the solution to the spherically averaged KS Hamiltonian for the energy window of the energy of that eigenstate. Indeed to reduce the number of times the KS potential needs to be solved inside the MT spheres it is advantageous to use energy windows and solve the KS Hamiltonian inside the MT region only once per window (at some energy inside the window) so that the KS Hamiltonian needs only be solved a small number of times per iteration, which for practical applications is on the order of ten to one hundred windows. This method combines the energy dependence of methods such as Projected Augmented Wave functions (PAW) with the ability of the basis set to adjust to the solid state (rather then atomic) environment which is similar to basis sets such as Linearized Augmented Plane Waves (LAPW).

Title: Tunable Spatiotemporal Orders in Driven Insulators
Authors: Daniel Kaplan, Pavel A. Volkov, Ahana Chakraborty, Zekun Zhuang, Premala Chandra
Abstract: We show that driving optical phonons above a threshold fluence induces spatiotemporal orders, where material properties oscillate at an incommensurate wavevector $q_0$ in space and at half the drive frequency in time. The order is robust against temperature on timescales much larger than the lifetime of the excited modes and can be accompanied by a static $2q_0$ modulation. We make predictions for time-resolved diffraction and provide estimates for candidate materials. Our results show the possibility of using THz waves in solids to realize tunable incommensurate order on the nanoscale.

Title: Majorana qubit readout by a point-contact detector under finite bias voltages
Authors: Huizi Xie, Sirui Yu, Hong Mao, Jinshuang Jin
Abstract: In this work we revisit the problem of a Majorana box qubit (MBQ) readout by a point-contact (PC) detector. The logic states of the MBQ are associated with the combined fermion parities of the MBQ and its tunnel-coupled quantum dot, which is measured by a PC detector. Beyond the existing studies on limiting bias voltage regimes, we analyze the steady-state current and the current power spectrum across all bias voltages. Our results indicate that the MBQ readout via the parity-dependent detector current is effective only at low bias voltage regime and requires the dot energy level to be off-resonance with the Majorana qubit. In contrast, the current power spectrum allows MBQ readout through the parity-dependent Rabi oscillation peak signals for arbitrary bias voltages, without restrictions on the dot energy level. Particularly, with focus on the MBQ measurement visibility, we analyze the peak-to-pedestal ratio for each characteristic peak (associated with each logic state of the qubit) and the signal-to-noise ratio of the two peaks. By examining these two metrics, we identify the optimal bias voltage window for the PC detector at low temperature limit.

Title: Mapping Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit interactions to inversion asymmetry in perovskite oxide heterostructures
Authors: Nirmal Ganguli, Avishek Singh, Vivek Kumar, Jayita Chakraborty
Abstract: Inversion asymmetry, combined with spin-orbit interaction, leads to Rashba or Dresselhaus effects, or combinations of them that are promising for technologies based on antiferromagnetic spintronics. Since understanding the exact nature of spin-orbit interaction is crucial for developing a technology based on it, mapping the nature of inversion asymmetry with the type of spin-orbit interaction becomes the key. We simulate a perovskite oxide heterostructure LaAlO$_3|$SrIrO$_3|$SrTiO$_3$ preserving the inversion symmetry within density functional theory to demonstrate the relation between the nature of inversion asymmetry and the corresponding Rashba or Dresselhaus-type interaction. With progressive distortion in the heterostructure, we find how the structure inversion asymmetry sets in with distorted bond lengths and bond angles, leading to Rashba effect in the system. Further, introduction of tilted IrO$_6$ octahedra leads to bulk inversion asymmetry, helping a combined Rashba-Dresselhaus interaction to set in. A comparison of the spin textures obtained from our DFT calculations and theoretical modeling helps us identify the exact nature of the interactions. Besides demonstrating the connection between the nature of asymmetry with Rashba and Dresselhaus interactions, our work may serve as a guide to identifying different types of Rashba-like spin-orbit interactions.

Title: Effective grand-canonical description of condensation in negative-temperature regimes
Authors: Stefano Iubini, Antonio Politi
Abstract: The observation of negative-temperature states in the localized phase of the Discrete Nonlinear Schrödinger (DNLS) equation has challenged statistical mechanics for a long time. For isolated systems, they can emerge as stationary extended states through a large-deviation mechanism occurring for finite sizes, while they are formally unstable in grand-canonical setups, being associated to an unlimited growth of the condensed fraction. Here, we show that negative-temperature states in open setups are metastable and their lifetime $\tau$ is exponentially long with the temperature, $\tau \approx \exp(\lambda |T|)$ (for $T<0$). A general expression for $\lambda$ is obtained in the case of a simplified stochastic model of non-interacting particles. In the DNLS model, the presence of an adiabatic invariant, makes $\lambda$ even larger because of the resulting freezing of the breather dynamics. This mechanism, based on the existence of two conservation laws, provides a new perspective over the statistical description of condensation processes.

Title: Magnetoelectric effects in diffusive two-dimensional superconductors studied by the nonlinear $σ$ model
Authors: P. Virtanen
Abstract: We describe a numerical approach to modeling magnetoelectric effects generated by spin-orbit coupling in inhomogeneous diffusive 2D superconductors. It is based on direct minimization of the free energy of diffusion modes, including their coupling to the spin-orbit field strength, described by a recently discovered $\sigma$-model action. We explain how to retain exact conservation laws in the discretized model, and detail the numerical procedure. We apply the approach to the spin-galvanic and the inverse spin-galvanic effects in finite-size 2D superconductors, and describe short-range oscillations of circulating currents and spin densities originating from the spin-orbit coupling.

Title: Quadrupolar Excitons in MoSe$_2$ Bilayers
Authors: Jakub Jasiński, Joakim Hagel, Samuel Brem, Edith Wietek, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Alexey Chernikov, Nicolas Bruyant, Mateusz Dyksik, Alessandro Surrente, Michał Baranowski, Duncan K. Maude, Ermin Malic, Paulina Plochocka
Abstract: The quest for platforms to generate and control exotic excitonic states has greatly benefited from the advent of transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers and their heterostructures. Among the unconventional excitonic states, quadrupolar excitons - a superposition of two dipolar excitons with anti-aligned dipole moments - are of great interest for applications in quantum simulations and for the investigation of many-body physics. Here, we unambiguously demonstrate the emergence of quadrupolar excitons in natural MoSe$_2$ homobilayers, whose energy shifts quadratically in electric field. In contrast to trilayer systems, MoSe$_2$ homobilayers have many advantages, which include a larger coupling between dipolar excitons. Our experimental observations are complemented by many-particle theory calculations offering microscopic insights in the formation of quadrupolar excitons. Our results suggest TMD homobilayers as ideal platform for the engineering of excitonic states and their interaction with light and thus candidate for carrying out on-chip quantum simulations.

Title: Strain stiffening due to stretching of entangled particles in random packings of granular materials
Authors: Eric Brown, Kevin A. Mitchell, Alice Nasto, Athanasios Athanassiadis, Heinrich M. Jaeger
Abstract: Stress-strain relations for random packings of entangling chains under triaxial compression can exhibit strain stiffening and sustain stresses several orders-of-magnitude beyond typical granular materials. X-ray tomography reveals the transition to this strong strain stiffening occurs when chains are long enough to entangle an average of about one chain each, which results in system-filling clusters of entangled chains. The number of entanglements is nearly proportional to the area surrounded by entangling particles with an excluded volume effect. A tendency was found for chain links to stretch when the packing was strained. The slope of the stress-strain relation of the packing can be calculated from a mean-field model consisting of the product of the effective extensional modulus of the chain, packing fraction, probability of stretched links, and the ratio of strain of stretched links to packing strain. The stress-strain model requires as input measurements of the ratio between local particle deformation and global average strain, and the probability of stretching for non-rigid particles. This results in a quadratic prediction for the stress-strain curve, with a curvature that agrees with experiments within the model uncertainties. This model explains that the strength of these packings comes from stretching of the links of chains, but only when the system-filling network of entanglements provides constraints that prevents failure by shear banding, so that particles must be deformed to move further under strain. In this model, the increasing slope of the stress-strain curve is mainly due to the fraction of stretched links increasing with strain. This model for the stress-strain relation is shown to be generalizable to different shapes of entangling particles by applying it to staples.

Title: Semi-Deterministic and Stochastic Sampling of Feynman Diagrams with 1/N$_f$ Expansions
Authors: Boyuan Shi
Abstract: We introduce a family of (semi) bold-line series, assisted with $1/\text{N}_{f}$ expansions, with $\text{N}_{f}$ being the number of fermion flavours. If there is no additional $\mathrm{N}_{f}$ cut, the series reduces to the RPA series in the density-density channel, complementary to the particle-hole and particle-particle channels introduced in [Phys. Rev. B \textbf{102}, 195122]. We performed extensive benchmarks for density, energy and pressure with $\mathrm{t}-\mathrm{t}'$ $\mathrm{SU}(\mathrm{N}_{f})$ Hubbard model on square lattice and honeycomb lattices over a wide range of numerical methods. For benchmark purposes, we also implement bare-$\mathrm{U}$ symmetry-broken perturbation series for the 2D SU(2) Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice. We find difficulties simulating grand potentials with different shift parameters even at high temperatures and weak interactions, while in general find encouraging results for density simulations. We believe the search for optimal shift parameters is feasible, while we leave this problem for future studies. Nevertheless, the $1/\mathrm{N}_{f}$ series could proves efficacious for grand potential computations where symmetry broken bare-U expansion grapples with considerable challenges.

Title: Quantum loops in the 1T transition metal dichalcogenides
Authors: Ashland Knowles, G. Baskaran, R. Ganesh
Abstract: Loop arrangements and their quantum superpositions describe several interesting many-particle states. We propose that they also describe bonding in a class of transition metal dichalcogenides. We present an effective quantum loop model for monolayers with 1T structure and a d$^2$ valence electron configuration: materials of the form MX$_2$ (M = Mo, W and X=S, Se, Te) and AM$'$Y$_2$ (A = Li, Na; M$'$ = V, Nb and Y = O, S, Se). Their t$_{2g}$ orbitals exhibit strongly directional overlaps between neighbouring atoms, favouring the formation of valence bonds. A transition metal atom forms two valence bonds, each with one of its neighbours. When connected, these bonds form loops that cover the triangular lattice. We construct a minimal Rokhsar-Kivelson-like model with resonance processes that cut and reconnect loops that run in proximity. The resulting dynamics is more constrained than in traditional quantum dimer models, with a `bending' constraint that arises from orbital structure. In the resulting phase diagram, we find phases that resemble distorted phases seen in materials, viz., the 1T$'$ and trimerized phases. As a testable prediction, we propose that a single d$^1$ or d$^3$ impurity will terminate a loop and give rise to a long-ranged texture. For example, a Ti/Cr defect in LiVO$_2$ will produce one or more domain walls that propagate outward from the impurity. We discuss the possibility of a loop liquid phase that can emerge in these materials.

Title: Engineering topological states and quantum-inspired information processing using classical circuits
Authors: Tian Chen, Weixuan Zhang, Deyuan Zou, Yifan Sun, Xiangdong Zhang
Abstract: Based on the correspondence between circuit Laplacian and Schrodinger equation, recent investigations have shown that classical electric circuits can be used to simulate various topological physics and the Schrodinger's equation. Furthermore, a series of quantum-inspired information processing have been implemented by using classical electric circuit networks. In this review, we begin by analyzing the similarity between circuit Laplacian and lattice Hamiltonian, introducing topological physics based on classical circuits. Subsequently, we provide reviews of the research progress in quantum-inspired information processing based on the electric circuit, including discussions of topological quantum computing with classical circuits, quantum walk based on classical circuits, quantum combinational logics based on classical circuits, electric-circuit realization of fast quantum search, implementing unitary transforms and so on.

Title: Efficient Optimization of Variational Autoregressive Networks with Natural Gradient
Authors: Jing Liu, Ying Tang, Pan Zhang
Abstract: Estimating free energy is a fundamental problem in statistical mechanics. Recently, machine-learning-based methods, particularly the variational autoregressive networks (VANs) have been proposed to minimize variational free energy and to approximate the Boltzmann distribution. VAN enjoys notable advantages, including the exact computation of the normalized joint distribution and fast sampling, which are critical features often missing in Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms. However, VAN also faces significant computational challenges. These include difficulties in the optimization of variational free energy in a complicated parameter space and slow convergence of learning. In this work, we introduce an optimization technique based on natural gradients to the VAN framework, namely ng-VAN, to enhance the learning efficiency and accuracy of the conventional VAN. The method has computational complexity cubic in the batch size rather than in the number of model parameters, hence it can be efficiently implemented for a large VAN model. We carried out extensive numerical experiments on the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model, spin glasses on random graphs, and the two-dimensional Ising model. Our results indicate that compared with the conventional VAN, ng-VAN significantly improves the accuracy in estimating free energy and converges much faster with shorter learning time. This allows extending the VAN framework's applicability to challenging statistical mechanics problems that were previously not accessible.

Title: Asymmetric Bending Boundary Layer: the $λ$-test
Authors: Nathan Vani, Alejandro Ibarra, José Bico, Étienne Reyssat, Benoît Roman
Abstract: We investigate the mechanics of two asymmetric ribbons bound at one end and pulled apart at the other ends. We characterize the elastic junction near the bonding and conceptualize it as a bending boundary layer. While the size of this junction decreases with the pulling force, we observe the surprising existence of the binding angle as a macroscopic signature of the bending stiffnesses. Our results thus challenge the standard assumption of neglecting bending stiffness of thin shells at large tensile loading. In addition, we show how the rotational response of the structure exhibits a non-linear and universal behavior regardless of the ratio of asymmetry. Leveraging the independence of the binding angle to the pulling force, we finally introduce the $\lambda$-test -- a visual measurement technique to characterize membranes through simple mechanical coupling.

Title: Fluid flow inside slit-shaped nanopores: the role of surface morphology at the molecular scale
Authors: Giorgia Marcelli, Tecla Bottinelli Montandon, Roya Ebrahimi Viand, Felix Höfling
Abstract: Non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations of fluid flow have highlighted the peculiarities of nanoscale flows compared to classical fluid mechanics; in particular, boundary conditions can deviate from the no-slip behavior at macroscopic scales. For fluid flow in slit-shaped nanopores, we demonstrate that surface morphology provides an efficient control on the slip length, which approaches zero when matching the molecular structures of the pore wall and the fluid. Using boundary-driven, energy-conserving NEMD simulations with a pump-like driving mechanism, we examine two types of pore walls--mimicking a crystalline and an amorphous material--that exhibit markedly different surface resistances to flow. The resulting flow velocity profiles are consistent with Poiseuille theory for incompressible, Newtonian fluids when adjusted for surface slip. For the two pores, we observe partial slip and no-slip behavior, respectively. The hydrodynamic permeability corroborates that the simulated flows are in the Darcy regime. However, the confinement of the fluid gives rise to an effective viscosity below its bulk value; wide pores exhibit a crossover between boundary and bulk-like flows. Additionally, the thermal isolation of the flow causes a linear increase in fluid temperature along the flow, which we relate to strong viscous dissipation and heat convection, utilizing conservation laws of fluid mechanics. Noting that the investigated fluid model does not form droplets, our findings challenge the universality of previously reported correlations between slippage, solvophobicity, and a depletion zone. Furthermore, they underscore the need for molecular-scale modeling to accurately capture the fluid dynamics near boundaries and in nanoporous materials, where macroscopic models may not be applicable.

Title: Direct production of fermionic superfluids in a cavity-enhanced optical dipole trap
Authors: Tabea Bühler, Timo Zwettler, Gaia Bolognini, Aurélien Fabre, Victor Helson, Giulia Del Pace, Jean-Philippe Brantut
Abstract: We present the production of quantum degenerate, superfluid gases of $^6$Li through direct evaporative cooling in a cavity-enhanced optical dipole trap. The entire evaporative cooling process is performed in a trap created by the TEM$_{00}$ mode of a Fabry-Pérot cavity, simultaneously driven on several successive longitudinal modes. This leads to near-complete cancellation of the inherent lattice structure along the axial direction of the cavity, as evidenced by the observation of long-lived dipole oscillations of the atomic cloud. We demonstrate the production of molecular Bose-Einstein condensates upon adiabatic conversion of a unitary Fermi gas evaporatively cooled in this trap. The lifetime and heating in the cavity trap are similar to those in a running wave dipole trap. Our system enables the optical production of ultracold samples using a total trap-laser power below $1$ W, leveraging the benefits of optical resonators as dipole traps in quantum gas research while maintaining a simple resonator design and minimizing additional experimental complexity.

Title: Quantum transport in strongly correlated Fermi gases
Authors: Tilman Enss
Abstract: Transport in strongly correlated fermions cannot be understood by fermionic quasiparticles alone. We present a theoretical framework for quantum transport that incorporates strong local correlations of fermion pairs. These contact correlations add essential contributions to viscous, thermal and sound transport coefficients. The bulk viscosity, in particular, receives its dominant contribution from pair excitations. Moreover, it can be measured elegantly by observing the response to a time-dependent scattering length even when the fluid is not moving. Rapid changes of the scattering length drive the system far out of local equilibrium, and we show how it relaxes back to equilibrium following a hydrodynamic attractor before a Navier-Stokes description becomes valid.

Title: Quantum transport of Dirac fermions in selected graphene nanosystems away from the charge-neutrality point
Authors: Adam Rycerz
Abstract: Peculiar electronic properties of graphene, including the universal dc conductivity and the pseudodiffusive shot noise, are usually attributed to a small vicinity of the charge-neutrality point, away from which electron's effective mass raises, and nanostructures in graphene start to behave similarly to familiar Sharvin contacts in semiconducting heterostructures hosting two-dimensional electron gas. Using the effective Dirac equation for low-energy excitations it can be shown that, as long as abrupt potential steps separate the sample area from the leads, graphene-specific features can be identified even relatively far from the charge-neutrality point. Namely, the conductance is reduced, comparing to the standard Sharvin value, whereas the shot noise is amplified. Here, we confront the results of earlier analytic considerations with numerical simulations of quantum transport on the honeycomb lattice, for selected systems for which considerations starting from the Dirac equation cannot be directly adapted. For a wedge-shape constriction with zigzag edges and approximately square shape of the narrowest section, the transport characteristics can be tuned from graphene-specific sub-Sharvin values to standard Sharvin values, depending on whether the electrostatic potential profile in the narrowest section is rectangular or smooth. The half-Corbino disk with rectangular potential profile exhibits both the conductance and the noise close to the sub-Sharvin values. For a circular quantum dot with two narrow openings and irregular edges, the conductance is close to the Sharvin value, and the Fano factor approaches the value of $F=1/4$. This suggests that, in experimental attempt to verify the predictions for sub-Sharvin transport regime, one should focus rather on nanosystems, for which the scatterings on edges are insignificant next to the scatterings on sample-lead interfaces.

Title: Quasiparticle interference in altermagnets
Authors: Hao-Ran Hu, Xiangang Wan, Wei Chen
Abstract: A novel collinear magnetic phase, termed ``altermagnetism,'' has recently been uncovered, characterized by zero net magnetization and momentum-dependent collinear spin-splitting. To understand the intriguing physical effects of altermagnets and explore their potential applications, it is crucial to analyze both the geometric and spin configurations of altermagnetic Fermi surfaces. Here, we conduct a comprehensive study of the quasiparticle interference (QPI) effects induced by both nonmagnetic and magnetic impurities in metallic altermagnets, incorporating the influence of Zeeman splitting and spin-orbit coupling. By examining the QPI patterns for various spin polarizations of magnetic impurities and different spin-probe channels, we identify a series of distinctive signatures that can be used to characterize altermagnetic Fermi surfaces. These predicted signatures can be directly compared with experimental results obtained through spin-resolved scanning tunneling spectroscopy.

Title: SFFT-Based Homogenization: Using Tensor Trains to Enhance FFT-Based Homogenization
Authors: Sascha H. Hauck, Matthias Kabel, Mazen Ali, Nicolas R. Gauger
Abstract: Homogenization is a fundamental technique for estimating the macroscopic properties of materials with microscale heterogeneity. Among Homogenization methods, the FFT-based Homogenization algorithm has become widely used due to its computational efficiency and ability to handle complex microstructures. Nevertheless, even with GPU acceleration, FFT-based Homogenization for industrial applications remains excessively time-consuming, particularly when generating elastic training data for AI models. This is due to the curse of dimensionality, which arises from the algorithms reliance on the Fast Fourier Transform, creating a fundamental bottleneck. In this paper, we propose a quantum-inspired SFFT-based Homogenization algorithm that leverages the improved time complexity of a Tensor Train variant of the Quantum Fourier Transform. By additionally exploiting structural properties of the underlying microstructure, our method achieves exponential improvements in time complexity and memory efficiency compared to the traditional FFT-based technique - all while remaining executable on classical hardware. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm across increasingly complex microstructures, demonstrating its potential advantages and limitations.

Title: Density of States Calculation of CeO$_2$ Based on VASP
Authors: Ruyi Hou
Abstract: In this study, the Density of States (DOS) of CeO$_2$ was analyzed in detail using the Density Functional Theory (DFT) method based on VASP software. As an important functional material, CeO$_2$ finds wide applications in catalysis, optics, and electronic devices. Through structural optimization, self-consistent electronic calculations, and non-self-consistent calculations, we thoroughly investigated the crystal structure and electronic energy level distribution of CeO$_2$. The lattice parameter optimization results from the structural calculations indicated a stable crystal structure for CeO$_2$. Self-consistent electronic calculations revealed a bandgap of approximately 2.403 eV, with the valence band maximum primarily contributed by O 2p orbitals and the conduction band minimum mainly originating from Ce 4f orbitals. Non-self-consistent calculations further demonstrated the total DOS and partial DOS of CeO$_2$, confirming the significant roles of Ce 4f and O 2p states in its electronic conduction and optical properties. These results not only provide theoretical support for the applications of CeO$_2$ in catalysis and electronic materials but also deepen our understanding of its fundamental electronic structural characteristics, offering guidance for the design and development of novel CeO$_2$-based materials.

Title: Ultrahigh interfacial thermal conductance for cooling gallium oxide electronics using cubic boron arsenide
Authors: Wenjiang Zhou, Nianjie Liang, Wei Xiao, Zhaofei Tong, Fei Tian, Bai Song
Abstract: Gallium oxide (Ga$_2$O$_3$) has attracted significant interest for its unique potential especially in power electronics. However, its low and anisotropic thermal conductivity poses a major challenge for heat dissipation. Here, we explore an effective cooling strategy centering on the heterogeneous integration of $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ devices with cubic boron arsenide (cBAs), an emerging material with an ultrahigh thermal conductivity $\kappa$ of ~1300 Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$. Machine-learned potentials for representative $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$/cBAs interfaces are trained, enabling accurate and efficient calculation of the interfacial thermal conductance $G$ via nonequilibrium molecular dynamics. At 300 K, remarkable $G$ values of 749$\pm$33 MWm$^{-2}$K$^{-1}$ and 824$\pm$35 MWm$^{-2}$K$^{-1}$ are predicted for Ga-As and O-B bonding across the interface, respectively, which are primarily attributed to the well-matched phonon density of states considering the similar Debye temperatures of $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ and cBAs. Moreover, finite-element simulations directly show a notable device temperature reduction when comparing cBAs with other substrates. The simultaneously ultrahigh $\kappa$ and $G$ highlight cBAs as an ideal substrate for Ga$_2$O$_3$ electronics.

Abstract: We exploit the equivalence between the partition function of an adsorbing Dyck walk model and the Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process (ASEP) normalization to obtain the thermodynamic limit of the locus of the ASEP normalization zeros from a conformal map. We discuss the equivalence between this approach and using an electrostatic analogy to determine the locus, both in the case of the ASEP and the random allocation model.

Title: Direct Observation of Vortices and Antivortices Generation in Phase-Separated Superconductor Sn-Pb Solder
Authors: Hiroto Arima, Takumi Murakami, Yuto Kinoshita, Hossein Sepehri-Amin, Masashi Tokunaga, Tsutomu Nojima, Yoshikazu Mizuguchi
Abstract: Quantized vortices in type-II superconductors provide insights into the mechanisms of superconductivity. However, the generation of antivortices, characterized by magnetization antiparallel to the external magnetic field, remains less understood. In this study, we investigate Sn-Pb solder, a superconductor with phase-separated Sn and Pb phases, and report the observation of both vortices and antivortices. Scanning SQUID (superconducting quantum interference device) microscopy revealed the presence of both vortices and antivortices, while magneto-optical imaging demonstrated flux avalanches. Our results demonstrate that Sn in Sn-Pb solder behaves as a type-II superconductor when magnetic fluxes are trapped, despite bulk Sn being a type-I superconductor with a transition temperature (TcSn) of 3.7 K. Our findings suggest that the size effect and proximity effect with Pb contribute synergistically to induce type-II superconductivity in Sn Notably, vortices were observed at temperatures as high as 5 K, exceeding the bulk TcSn. Furthermore, the interplay between the type-I superconducting Pb phase and the type-II superconducting Sn phase results in the generation of antivortices, providing a mechanism to accommodate excess magnetic flux. This study shed light on new research on composites combining type-I and type-II superconductors.

Title: Optimal performance of thermoelectric devices with small external irreversibility
Authors: Rajeshree Chakraborty, Ramandeep S. Johal
Abstract: In the thermodynamic analysis of thermoelectric devices, typical irreversibilities are for the processes of finite-rate heat transfer and Joule heating. Approximate analyses often focus on either internal or external irreversibility, yielding well-known expressions for the efficiency at maximum power (EMP), such as the Curzon-Ahlborn value for endoreversible model and the Schmiedl-Seifert form for exoreversible model. Within the Constant Properties model, we formulate a scenario that incorporates internal as well as external irreversibilities simultaneously. We employ the approximation of a symmetric and small external irreversibility (SEI), confining to the regime where the external conductance of the heat exchangers is large in comparison to the internal thermal conductance of the thermoelectric material. This approach allows us to derive a general expression for EMP, which depends on the ratio of internal to external conductance, apart from the figure of merit and ratio of temperatures. Extending our study to thermoelectric refrigerators under the similar assumptions, we also analyze the efficiency at maximum cooling power.

Title: Electrical probe of spin-spiral order in quantum spin Hall/spin-spiral magnet van der Waals heterostructures
Authors: Fedor Nigmatulin, Jose L. Lado, Zhipei Sun
Abstract: Two-dimensional spin-spiral magnets provide promising building blocks for van der Waals heterostructures due to their tunable spin textures and potential for novel functionalities for quantum devices. However, due to its vanishing magnetization and two-dimensional nature, it is challenging to detect the existence of its noncollinear magnetization. Here, we show that a van der Waals junction based on a spin-spiral magnet and a quantum spin Hall insulator enables obtaining signatures of noncollinear magnetization directly from electrical measurements. Our strategy exploits the sensitivity of helical states to local breaking of time-reversal symmetry, enabling the detection of local magnetic orders even in the absence of net magnetization. We show that the combination of spin-spiral order and nonmagnetic disorder gives rise to scattering in the helical channels that can be directly associated with the spiral exchange coupling and residual nonmagnetic disorder strength. Our results show how electrical transport measurement provides a method to detect spin-spiral magnets by leveraging helical states in van der Waals heterostructures.

Title: Epitaxial strain tuning of electronic and spin excitations in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films
Authors: Hengyang Zhong, Bo Hao, Yuan Wei, Zhijia Zhang, Ruixian Liu, Xinru Huang, Xiao-Sheng Ni, Marli dos Reis Cantarino, Kun Cao, Yuefeng Nie, Thorsten Schmitt, Xingye Lu
Abstract: The discovery of ambient-pressure superconductivity with $T_{c,\text{onset}} > 40$ K in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (LNO) thin films under in-plane biaxial compressive strain underscores the pivotal role of epitaxial strain in tuning exotic electronic states and provides a unique platform for investigating the superconducting mechanisms in nickelate superconductors. Here, we use resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) to probe the strain-dependent electronic and spin excitations in LNO thin films with biaxial strain ranging from $\epsilon\approx-1.04\%$ to $1.91\%$. Compared with the bulk crystal, the LNO thin film grown on LaAlO$_3$ (with $\epsilon\approx-1.04\%$) exhibits similar $dd$ excitations and enhanced spin excitation bandwidth. In contrast, the 0.4 eV and 1.6 eV $dd$ excitations associated with the Ni 3$d_{z^2}$ orbital, along with the spin excitations, are significantly suppressed in the film grown on SrTiO$_3$ ($\varepsilon\approx1.91\%$). The $c$-axis compression and the reduced out-of-plane Ni-O-Ni bond angle, induced by in-plane tensile strain in LNO/SrTiO$_3$ broaden the Ni 3$d_{z^2}$ bandwidth and decrease the Ni 3$d_{z^2}$-O 2$p_{z}$ hybridization, thereby suppressing the $dd$ excitations. The evolution of spin excitations reflects significant changes in the interlayer exchange coupling $J_z$, which can be attributed to the strain-tuned Ni-O-Ni bond angle. Since superconductivity is observed only in films with in-plane compressive strain ($\epsilon\sim-2\%$), the strain-dependent spin correlations align with the emergence of superconductivity, providing indirect evidence for spin-fluctuation-mediated unconventional superconductivity in LNO.

Title: Out-of-phase Plasmon Excitations in the Trilayer Cuprate Bi$_2$Sr$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{10+δ}$
Authors: S. Nakata, M. Bejas, J. Okamoto, K. Yamamoto, D. Shiga, R. Takahashi, H. Y. Huang, H. Kumigashira, H. Wadati, J. Miyawaki, S. Ishida, H. Eisaki, A. Fujimori, A. Greco, H. Yamase, D. J. Huang, H. Suzuki
Abstract: Within a homologous series of cuprate superconductors, variations in the stacking of CuO$_2$ layers influence the collective charge dynamics through the long-range Coulomb interactions. We use O $K$-edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering to reveal plasmon excitations in the optimally-doped trilayer Bi$_2$Sr$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{10+\delta}$. The observed plasmon exhibits nearly $q_z$-independent dispersion and a large excitation gap of approximately 300 meV. This mode is primarily ascribed to the $\omega_{-}$ mode, where the charge density on the outer CuO$_2$ sheets oscillates out of phase while the density in the inner sheet remains unaltered at $q_z=0$. The intensity of the acoustic $\omega_3$ mode is relatively weak and becomes vanishingly small near $(q_x, q_y)=(0, 0)$. This result highlights a qualitative change in the eigenmode of the dominant low-energy plasmon with the number of CuO$_2$ layers.

Title: Magnetic transition in marcasite FeTe$_{2}$ induced by the competition between crystal field splitting and Coulomb repulsion
Authors: Yue-Fei Hou, Zhibin Shao, Minghu Pan, Shiyang Wu, Fawei Zheng, Zhen-Guo Fu, Ping Zhang
Abstract: The magnetic ground states in crystalline systems are significant for both fundamental condensed matter physics and practical materials engineering. Marcasite FeTe$_{2}$, characterized as a small-gap semiconductor, exhibits anomalous magnetic behaviors in low-temperature experiments. In this study, first-principles density functional theory calculations combined with scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy are employed to investigate the magnetic ground state of marcasite FeTe$_{2}$. It is revealed that the competition between crystal field splitting and Coulomb repulsion plays the key role in the formation of localized magnetic moments in FeTe$_{2}$. The ground state of FeTe$_{2}$ bulk is confirmed to be nonmagnetic, while the previously observed magnetic responses of FeTe$_{2}$ are suggested to be related to the magnetic Fe atoms on the crystal surfaces. Our work proposes a straightforward theoretical criterion for determining ground-state magnetism of various localized-moment systems.

Title: Prolegomena To Any Future Device Physics
Authors: Adam L. Friedman, Aubrey T. Hanbicki
Abstract: For the last 60 years, advances in conventional computing platforms have been driven by the empirical notion known as Moores law. In its essence, Moores law is a ubiquitous description of the exponential increase in transistor density acting as a proxy for computing power as a function of time. While this trend started as an interesting observation, it has evolved into a self-fulfilling prophecy used to drive the entire semiconductor industry. Arguments for or against the end of Moores law have proliferated and the reluctant consensus is that Moores law will disappear. Warnings of the end of this trend have been repeatedly thwarted by advances in many different aspects of the computing ecosystem including materials improvements, device design, device or circuit cleverness, and software and architectural innovations. While many have argued the impending doom of Moores law is the ultimate roadblock imposed by atomic length scales, quantum processes, and energy consumption limits, we contend that Moores law must be jettisoned for a different reason: Words matter. Even those who adamantly declare the end of Moores law still use the language of Moores law. The inward focus of this notion imposes an intellectual tyranny that inhibits revolutionary progress. We suggest instead a more outwardly focused perspective and suggest a shift in language to a regime we coin the Feynman Mandate. In this perspective, we outline the issues with the continued use of Moores law as well as a prescription of transitioning to a new lexicon. We outline a new, more general metric for ascertaining progress and identify the roles of various stakeholders in this process.

Title: Quasi-phase-matched up- and down-conversion in periodically poled layered semiconductors

Abstract: Nonlinear optics lies at the heart of classical and quantum light generation. The invention of periodic poling revolutionized nonlinear optics and its commercial applications by enabling robust quasi-phase-matching in crystals such as lithium niobate. However, reaching useful frequency conversion efficiencies requires macroscopic dimensions, limiting further technology development and integration. Here we realize a periodically poled van der Waals semiconductor (3R-MoS$_2$). Due to its exceptional nonlinearity, we achieve macroscopic frequency conversion efficiency of 0.03% at the relevant telecom wavelength over a microscopic thickness of 3.4${\mu}$m (that is, 3 poling periods), $10-100\times$ thinner than current systems with similar performances. Due to unique intrinsic cavity effects, the thickness-dependent quasi-phase-matched second harmonic signal surpasses the usual quadratic enhancement by $50\%$. Further, we report the broadband generation of photon pairs at telecom wavelengths via quasi-phase-matched spontaneous parametric down-conversion, showing a maximum coincidence-to-accidental-ratio of $638 \pm 75$. This work opens the new and unexplored field of phase-matched nonlinear optics with microscopic van der Waals crystals, unlocking applications that require simple, ultra-compact technologies such as on-chip entangled photon-pair sources for integrated quantum circuitry and sensing.

Title: Degeneracy-breaking and Long-lived Multimode Microwave Electromechanical Systems Enabled by Cubic Silicon-Carbide Membrane Crystals
Authors: Yulong Liu, Huanying Sun, Qichun Liu, Haihua Wu, Mika A. Sillanpää, Tiefu Li
Abstract: Cubic silicon-carbide crystals (3C-SiC), known for their high thermal conductivity and in-plane stress, hold significant promise for the development of high-quality ($Q$) mechanical oscillators. We reveal degeneracy-breaking phenomena in 3C-phase crystalline silicon-carbide membrane and present high-$Q$ mechanical modes in pairs or clusters. The 3C-SiC material demonstrates excellent microwave compatibility with superconducting circuits. Thus, we can establish a coherent electromechanical interface, enabling precise control over 21 high-$Q$ mechanical modes from a single 3C-SiC square membrane. Benefiting from extremely high mechanical frequency stability, this interface enables tunable light slowing with group delays extending up to an impressive duration of \emph{an hour}. Coherent energy transfer between distinct mechanical modes are also presented. In this work, the studied 3C-SiC membrane crystal with their significant properties of multiple acoustic modes and high-quality factors, provide unique opportunities for the encoding, storage, and transmission of quantum information via bosonic phonon channels.

Title: Spontaneous and Induced Oscillations in Confined Epithelia
Authors: Toshi Parmar, Liam P. Dow, Beth L. Pruitt, M. Cristina Marchetti
Abstract: The feedback between mechanical and chemical signals plays a key role in controlling many biological processes and collective cell behavior. Here we focus on the emergence of spatiotemporal density waves in a one-dimensional "cell train." Combining a minimal theoretical model with observations in an in vitro experimental system of MDCK epithelial cells confined to a linear pattern, we examine the spontaneous oscillations driven by the feedback between myosin activation and mechanical deformations and their effect on the response of the tissue to externally applied deformations. We show that the nature and frequency of spontaneous oscillations is controlled by the size of the cell train, with a transition from size-dependent standing waves to intrinsic spontaneous waves at the natural frequency of the tissue. The response to external boundary perturbations exhibit a resonance at this natural frequency, providing a possible venue for inferring the mechanochemical couplings that control the tissue behavior from rheological experiments.

Title: Topological transitions in quantum jump dynamics: Hidden exceptional points
Authors: Andrei I. Pavlov, Yuval Gefen, Alexander Shnirman
Abstract: Complex spectra of dissipative quantum systems may exhibit degeneracies known as exceptional points (EPs). At these points the systems' dynamics may undergo drastic changes. Phenomena associated with EPs and their applications have been extensively studied in relation to various experimental platforms, including, i.a., the superconducting circuits. While most of the studies focus on EPs appearing due to the variation of the system's physical parameters, we focus on EPs emerging in the full counting statistics of the system. We consider a monitored three level system and find multiple EPs in the Lindbladian eigenvalues considered as functions of a counting field. These "hidden" EPs are not accessible without the insertion of the counting field into the Linbladian, i.e., if only the density matrix of the system is studied. Nevertheless, we show that the "hidden" EPs are accessible experimentally. We demonstrate that these EPs signify transitions between different topological classes which are rigorously characterized in terms of the braid theory. Furthermore, we identify dynamical observables affected by these transitions and demonstrate how experimentally measured quantum jump distributions can be used to spot transitions between different topological regimes. Additionally, we establish a duality between the conventional Lindbladian EPs (zero counting field) and some of the "hidden" ones. Our findings allow for easier experimental observations of the EP transitions, normally concealed by the Lindbladian steady state, without applying postselection schemes. These results can be directly generalized to any monitored open system as long as it is described within the Lindbladian formalism.

Title: Broadband light extraction from near-surface NV centers using crystalline-silicon antennas
Authors: Minjeong Kim, Maryam Zahedian, Wenxin Wu, Chengyu Fang, Zhaoning Yu, Raymond A. Wambold, Ricardo Vidrio, Yuhan Tong, Shenwei Yin, David A. Czaplewski, Jennifer T. Choy, Mikhail A. Kats
Abstract: We use crystalline silicon (Si) antennas to efficiently extract broadband single-photon fluorescence from shallow nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond into free space. Our design features relatively easy-to-pattern high-index Si resonators on the diamond surface to boost photon extraction by overcoming total internal reflection and Fresnel reflection at the diamond-air interface, and providing modest Purcell enhancement, without etching or otherwise damaging the diamond surface. In simulations, ~17 times more single photons are collected from a single NV center compared to the case without the antenna; in experiments, we observe an enhancement of ~9 times, limited by spatial alignment between the NV and the antenna. Our approach can be readily applied to other color centers in diamond, and more generally to the extraction of light from quantum emitters in wide-bandgap materials.

Title: Simulating a quasiparticle on a quantum device
Authors: Rimika Jaiswal, Izabella Lovas, Leon Balents
Abstract: We propose a variational approach to explore quasiparticle excitations in interacting quantum many-body systems, motivated by the potential in leveraging near-term noisy intermediate scale quantum devices for quantum state preparation. By exploiting translation invariance and potentially other abelian symmetries of the many-body Hamiltonian, we extend the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) approach to construct spatially localized quasiparticle states that encode information on the whole excited band, allowing us to achieve quantum parallelism. We benchmark the proposed algorithm via numerical simulations performed on the one-dimension transverse field Ising chain. We show that VQE can capture both the magnon quasiparticles of the paramagnetic phase, and the topologically non-trivial domain wall excitations in the ferromagnetic regime. We show that the localized quasiparticle states constructed with VQE contain accessible information on the full band of quasiparticles, and provide valuable insight into the way interactions renormalize the bare spin flip or domain wall excitations of the simple, trivially solvable limits of the model. These results serve as important theoretical input towards utilizing quantum simulators to directly access the quasiparticles of strongly interacting quantum systems, as well as to gain insight into crucial experimentally measured properties directly determined by the nature of these quasiparticles.

Title: Intrinsic mixed state topological order in a stabilizer system under stochastic decoherence: Strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking from percolation point of view
Authors: Yoshihito Kuno, Takahiro Orito, Ikuo Ichinose
Abstract: Discovering quantum orders in mixed many-body systems is an ongoing issue. Very recently, the notion of an intrinsic mixed state topologically-ordered (IMTO) state was proposed. As a concrete example, we observe the emergence of IMTO by studying the toric code system under stochastic maximal decoherence by $ZX$-diagonal type projective measurement without monitoring. We study how the toric code state changes to an IMTO state at the level of the averaged quantum trajectories. This phase transition is understood from the viewpoint of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of 1-form weak symmetry, that is, the IMTO is characterized by the symmetry restoration from the SSB, which comes from the proliferation of anyons. To understand the emergent IMTO, order and disorder parameters of 1-form symmetry are numerically studied by stabilizer simulation. The present study clarifies the existence of two distinct microscopic string operators for the fermionic anyons, that leads to distinct fermionic strong and weak 1-form symmetries, and also the obtained critical exponents indicate strong relation between IMTO and percolation.

Title: High-impedance resonators for strong coupling to an electron on helium
Authors: G. Koolstra, E. O. Glen, N. R. Beysengulov, H. Byeon, K. E. Castoria, M. Sammon, B. Dizdar, C. S. Wang, D. I. Schuster, S. A. Lyon, J. Pollanen, D. G. Rees
Abstract: The in-plane motion of an electron on helium can couple to superconducting microwave resonators via electrical dipole coupling, offering a robust and rapid readout scheme. In previous efforts, microwave resonator designs for electrons on helium have lacked the coupling strength to reach the strong coupling regime, where coherent quantum effects outlast both electron and resonator decoherence rates. High-impedance superconducting microwave resonators offer a path to strong coupling, but integrating such resonators with electrons on helium remains an outstanding challenge. Here, we introduce a high-impedance resonator design compatible with strong coupling to electrons on helium. We fabricate and measure titanium nitride resonators with median internal quality factors of $3.9\times 10^5$ and average impedance of 2.5 k$\Omega$, promising a seven-fold increase in coupling strength compared with standard 50$\Omega$ resonators. Additionally, we develop a simplified resonator model from the capacitance matrix and sheet inductance that accurately predicts the mode frequencies, significantly simplifying the design process of future resonators for investigating quantum effects with electrons on helium.

Title: Disentangling critical quantum spin chains with Clifford circuits
Authors: Chaohui Fan, Xiangjian Qian, Hua-Chen Zhang, Rui-Zhen Huang, Mingpu Qin, Tao Xiang
Abstract: Clifford circuits can be utilized to disentangle quantum states with polynomial cost, thanks to the Gottesman-Knill theorem. Based on this idea, the Clifford circuits augmented matrix product states (CAMPS) method, which is a seamless integration of Clifford circuits within the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm, was proposed recently and was shown to be able to reduce entanglement in various quantum systems. In this work, we further explore the power of the CAMPS method in critical spin chains described by conformal field theories (CFTs) in the scaling limit. We find that the optimized disentanglers correspond to {\it duality} transformations, which significantly reduce the entanglement entropy in the ground state. For the critical quantum Ising spin chain governed by the Ising CFT with self-duality, the Clifford circuits found by CAMPS coincide with the duality transformation, i.e., the Kramers-Wannier self-duality in the critical Ising chain. It reduces the entanglement entropy by mapping the free conformal boundary condition to the fixed one. In the more general case of the XXZ chain, the CAMPS gives rise to a duality transformation mapping the model to the quantum Ashkin-Teller spin chain. Our results highlight the potential of the framework as a versatile tool for uncovering hidden dualities and simplifying the entanglement structure of critical quantum systems.

Title: Large $N$ limits of supersymmetric quantum field theories: A pedagogical overview
Authors: Leonardo Santilli
Abstract: The different large $N$ limits of supersymmetric quantum field theories in three, four, and five dimensions are reviewed. We distinguish between the planar limit of SQCD theories, the M-theory limit suited in three and five dimensions, and the long quiver limit. The method to solve exactly the sphere partition functions in each type of limit is spelled out in a pedagogical way. After a comprehensive general treatment of the saddle point approximation in the large $N$ limit, we present an extensive list of examples and detail the calculations. The scope of this overview is to provide an entry-level, computation-oriented understanding of the techniques featured in the field theory side of the AdS/CFT correspondence.
