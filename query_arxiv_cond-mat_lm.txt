Title: Sucrose ester surfactants: current understanding and emerging perspectives
Authors: Diana Cholakova, Slavka Tcholakova
Abstract: Sucrose esters (SEs), derived from sucrose and fatty acids, are biodegradable and non-toxic surfactants increasingly favored as substitutes for petrochemically-synthesized ones in food, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals. SEs provide versatile hydrophilic-lipophilic properties, determined by the degree of sucrose esterification ranging from one to eight. The length of the fatty acid residues further influences the phase behavior of SEs, allowing creation of tailored formulations for specific applications. This review provides insights about our current understanding of the SEs phase behavior, their aggregation in aqueous and oily solutions, and its correlation with formulation outcomes. Furthermore, an overview of recent studies investigating SEs in various colloidal systems, incl. emulsions, foams, oleogels, and others, is provided. Novel concepts are discussed alongside future research directions, emphasizing the SEs potential as sustainable, functional ingredients.

Title: Optimizing superlattice bilayer graphene for a fractional Chern insulator
Authors: Dathan Ault-McCoy, M. Nabil Y. Lhachemi, Aaron Dunbrack, Sayed Ali Akbar Ghorashi, Jennifer Cano
Abstract: Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene modulated by a superlattice potential is a highly tunable system predicted to realize isolated topological flat bands. In this work we calculate the band structure and quantum geometry of bilayer graphene subject to both triangular and square superlattices, across a wide range of gate voltages. We identify the parameter regime that optimizes the "single-particle indicators" for the stability of a fractional Chern insulator (FCI) when a topological flat band is partially filled. Our results guide the experimental realization of an FCI in this platform.

Title: Observation of excitons bound by antiferromagnetic correlations
Authors: Omar Mehio, Yuchen Han, Xinwei Li, Honglie Ning, Zach Porter, Stephen D. Wilson, David Hsieh
Abstract: Two-dimensional Mott insulators host antiferromagnetic (AFM) correlations that are predicted to enhance the attractive interaction between empty (holons) and doubly occupied (doublons) sites, creating a novel pathway for exciton formation. However, experimental confirmation of this spin-mediated binding mechanism remains elusive. Leveraging the distinct magnetic critical properties of the Mott antiferromagnets Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ and Sr$_3$Ir$_2$O$_7$, we show using time-resolved THz spectroscopy that excitons only exist at temperatures below where short-range AFM correlation develops. The excitons remain stable up to photodoping densities approaching the predicted excitonic Mott insulator-to-metal transition, revealing a unique robustness against screening. Our results establish the viability of spin-bound excitons and introduce opportunities for excitonic control through magnetic degrees of freedom.

Title: A Hubbard exciton fluid in a photo-doped antiferromagnetic Mott insulator
Authors: Omar Mehio, Xinwei Li, Honglie Ning, Zala Lenarčič, Yuchen Han, Michael Buchhold, Zach Porter, Nicholas J. Laurita, Stephen D. Wilson, David Hsieh
Abstract: The undoped antiferromagnetic Mott insulator naturally has one charge carrier per lattice site. When it is doped with additional carriers, they are unstable to spin fluctuation-mediated Cooper pairing as well as other unconventional types of charge, spin, and orbital current ordering. Photo-excitation can produce charge carriers in the form of empty (holons) and doubly occupied (doublons) sites that may also exhibit charge instabilities. There is evidence that antiferromagnetic correlations enhance attractive interactions between holons and doublons, which can then form bound pairs known as Hubbard excitons, and that these might self-organize into an insulating Hubbard exciton fluid. However, this out-of-equilibrium phenomenon has not been detected experimentally. Here, we report the transient formation of a Hubbard exciton fluid in the antiferromagnetic Mott insulator Sr$_{2}$IrO$_{4}$ using ultrafast terahertz conductivity. Following photo-excitation, we observe rapid spectral weight transfer from a Drude metallic response to an insulating response. The latter is characterized by a finite energy peak originating from intra-excitonic transitions, whose assignment is corroborated by our numerical simulations of an extended Hubbard model. The lifetime of the peak is short, approximately one picosecond, and scales exponentially with Mott gap size, implying extremely strong coupling to magnon modes.

Title: Proposal for many-body quantum chaos detection with single-site measurements
Authors: Isaías Vallejo-Fabila, Adway Kumar Das, Sayan Choudhury, Lea F. Santos
Abstract: We demonstrate that the long-time dynamics of an observable associated with a single lattice site is sufficient to determine whether a many-body quantum system exhibits level statistics characteristic of random matrix theory, a widely used diagnostic of quantum chaos. In particular, we focus on the partial survival probability and spin autocorrelation function at a single site, both evolved under a disordered spin-1/2 chain, which is a setup realizable in current experimental platforms. Given the precision and timescales currently achievable, our results indicate that the detection of many-body quantum chaos is feasible, but constrained to small system sizes.

Title: Interpolating between pair-potential systems
Authors: Lorenzo Costigliola, Andreas C. Martine, Claudia X. Romero, Jone E. Steinhoff, Francisco M. F. A. S. da Fonseca, Maria B. T. Nielsen, Jeppe C. Dyre
Abstract: This paper studies liquid-model systems with almost identical constant-potential-energy hypersurfaces. We simulated continuous interpolations between such systems, specifically between the Lennard-Jones (LJ), Weeks-Chandler-Andersen (WCA), exponent 12 inverse-power-law (IPL), and Yukawa (YK) pair-potential systems. Structure and dynamics were monitored via the radial distribution function and the time-dependent mean-square displacement, respectively. In terms of the interpolation parameter lambda, we argue that two systems have very similar constant-potential-energy hypersurfaces if the potential energies of configurations rarely cross when plotted as functions of lambda. Such absence of "level crossing" applies to a very good approximation for the LJ to WCA transformation, and it also applies to a quite good approximation for the LJ to IPL and the YK to YK transformations (the latter varies the screening length). In all cases, structure and dynamics are shown to be almost invariant as functions of lambda. The density is kept constant when lambda is varied. Temperature must be generally adjusted with lambda, which is done by an iterative "reduced-force-matching" method with no free parameters. We also apply the interpolation strategy to two versions of the Kob-Andersen (KA) binary LJ system and show that a recently introduced shifted-force-cutoff version of this system has constant-potential-energy hypersurfaces, which are almost identical to those of the original KA system. This result rationalizes the previously established fact that the two KA versions have virtually identical physics.

Title: Trends in Gibbs States for Thermodynamics of Canonical Nonlinearity
Authors: Ryu Tomitaka, Koretaka Yuge
Abstract: When we consider canonical average for classical discrete systems under constant composition (specifically, substitutional alloys) as a map phi from a set of many-body interatomic interactions to that of microscopic configuration in thermodynamic equilibrium, phi generally exhibits complicated nonlinearity. The nonlinearity has recently been amply studied in terms of configurational geometry, measured by vector field and Kullback-Leibler divergence, whose individual concepts are further unified through stochastic thermodynamic transformation: We call this procedure as Themodynamics of canonical nonlinearity (TCN). Although TCN can reveal the non-linear character across multiple configurations through thermodynamic functions, the essential role for Gibbs states (GBS) in terms of the nonlinearity is still totally unclear. We here tackle this problem, and reveal the characteristic roles of the GBS: (i) Concrete expression of the GBS is derived, (ii) strong correlation between GBSs and averaged nonlinearity over configurations for moled systems is found, and (iii) GBS-based bounds for averaged nonlinearity at specific conditions is derived.

Title: Subdiffusion of sticky dendrimers in an associative polymer network
Authors: Silpa Mariya, Jeremy J. Barr, P. Sunthar, J. Ravi Prakash
Abstract: We investigate the static and dynamic properties of dendrimers diffusing through a network of linear associative polymers using coarse-grained Brownian dynamics simulations. Both dendrimers and network chains are modelled as bead-spring chain polymers, with hydrodynamic interactions incorporated for the accurate prediction of dynamic properties. Linear chains form a network via the associating groups distributed along their backbones, and the dendrimers interact attractively or repulsively with the network, enabling a direct comparison of sticky and non-sticky behaviour of dendrimers. Structural analysis reveals that while non-sticky dendrimers shrink with increasing network concentration, similar to linear polymer behaviour, sticky dendrimers exhibit stretching at low concentrations due to binding interactions. Dendrimer dynamics are largely insensitive to network architecture but are strongly influenced by the strength of dendrimer-network interactions. Increasing attraction to the network leads to subdiffusive motion and non-Gaussian displacement statistics, even when dendrimers are smaller than the average mesh size. The long-time diffusivity aligns with theoretical predictions for nanoparticle transport in polymer networks. Additionally, dendrimers deform the network locally, altering the mesh size distribution depending on their stickiness. These findings offer insight into the interplay between macromolecular architecture, binding interactions, and transport in polymeric environments.

Title: Cerium doped graphene-based materials towards oxygen reduction reaction catalysis
Authors: Lanna E.B. Lucchetti, Pedro A.S. Autreto, Mauro C. Santos, James M. de Almeida
Abstract: With the global transition towards cleaner energy and sustainable processes, the demand for efficient catalysts, especially for the oxygen reduction reaction, has gained attention from the scientific community. This research work investigates cerium-doped graphene-based materials as catalysts for this process with density functional theory calculations. The electrochemical performance of Ce-doped graphene was assessed within the computation hydrogen electrode framework. Our findings reveal that Ce doping, especially when synergized with an oxygen atom, shows improved catalytic activity and selectivity. For instance, Ce doping in combination with an oxygen atom, located near a border, can be selective for the 2-electron pathway. Overall, the combination of Ce doping with structural defects and oxygenated functions lowers the reaction free energies for the oxygen reduction compared to pure graphene, and consequently, might improve the catalytic activity. This research sheds light from a computational perspective on Ce-doped carbon materials as a sustainable alternative to traditional costly metal-based catalysts, offering promising prospects for green energy technologies and electrochemical applications.

Title: Static and dynamic theory of polarization under internal and directing electric fields: Fixed-charge and fixed-potential conditions
Authors: Akira Onuki
Abstract: We present a continuum theory on statics and dynamics of polar fluids, where the orientational polarization ${\bi p}_1$ and the induced polarization ${\bi p}_2$ are governed by the Onsager directing field ${\bi E}_d$ and the Lorentz internal field $\bi F$, respectively. We start with a dielectric free energy functional $\cal F$ with a cross term $\propto \int\hspace{-0.5mm} d{\bi r}~{\bi p}_1\cdot{\bi p}_2$, which was proposed by Felderhof $[$J. Phys. C: Solid State Phys. {\bf 12}, 2423 (1979)$]$. With this cross-coupling, our theory can yield the theoretical results by Onsager and Kirkwood. We also present dynamic equations using the functional derivatives $\delta {\cal F}/\delta {\bi p}_i$ to calculate the space-time correlations of ${\bi p}_i$. We then obtain analytic expressions for various frequency-dependent quantities including the Debye formula. We find that the fluctuations of the total polarization drastically depend on whether we fix the electrode charge or the applied potential difference between parallel metal electrodes. In the latter fixed-potential condition, we obtain a nonlocal (long-range) polarization correlation inversely proportional to the cell volume $V$, which is crucial to understand the dielectric response. It is produced by nonlocal charge fluctuations on the electrode surfaces and is sensitive to the potential drops in the Stern layers in small systems. These nonlocal correlations in the bulk and on the surfaces are closely related due to the global constraint of fixed potential difference. We also add some results in other boundary conditions including the periodic one, where nonlocal correlations also appear.

Title: One-third magnetization plateau in a spin-1 kagome magnet BaNi$_3$(AsO$_4$)$_2$(OH)$_2$
Authors: Yuya Haraguchi, Jun-ichi Yamaura, Akira Matsuo, Koichi Kindo, Hiroko Aruga Katori
Abstract: We investigate the structural and magnetic properties of BaNi$_3$(AsO$_4$)$_2$(OH)$_2$, focusing on its spin-1 kagome lattice and the intricate coexistence of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions. Powder x-ray diffraction analysis confirms a highly crystalline trigonal structure. Detailed Rietveld refinement identifies a single crystallographic Ni site, indicative of a perfect kagome lattice. Magnetic susceptibility measurements suggest predominantly ferromagnetic interactions with an effective magnetic moment consistent with Ni$^{2+}$ spins, yet the system undergoes antiferromagnetic ordering at a N$é$el temperature of 5.8 K. Isothermal magnetization measurements reveal a series of metamagnetic transitions culminating in a plateau-like phase near one-third of the total saturation magnetization. Analysis of the phase boundaries shows that the antiferromagnetic phase supports a substantial net moment in each kagome layer, comparable to that of the one-third plateau. This observation challenges the conventional model-where a 120$^\circ$ ground state transitions to an up-up-down configuration-commonly assumed for kagome antiferromagnets. Instead, our findings indicate that both the zero-field ground state and the field-induced phases exhibit in-plane ferrimagnetic spin arrangements on the kagome lattice, with the metamagnetic transition corresponding to a shift from layer-by-layer antiferromagnetically aligned net moments to ferromagnetically aligned ones. This configuration is stabilized by bond frustration, a network of competing interactions that can favor both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic couplings, highlighting the essential role of frustration in governing the low-temperature magnetic behavior of spin-1 kagome systems.

Title: Criticality and Universality of Generalized Kuramoto Model
Authors: Zhongpu Qiu, Tianyi Wu, Sheng Fang, Jun Meng, Jingfang Fan
Abstract: We explore synchronization transitions in even-$D$-dimensional generalized Kuramoto oscillators on both complete graphs and $d$-dimensional lattices. In the globally coupled system, analytical expansions of the self-consistency equations, incorporating finite-size corrections, reveal universal critical exponents $\beta = 1/2$ and $\bar{\nu} = 5/2$ for all even $D$, indicating an unconventional upper critical dimension $d_u = 5$. Extensive numerical simulations across multiple $D$ confirm these theoretical predictions. For locally coupled systems, we develop a framework based on spin-wave theory and fluctuation-resolved functional network diagnostics, which captures criticality in entrainment transition. A modified Edwards-Anderson order parameter further validates the predicted exponents. This combined theoretical and numerical study uncovers a family of universality classes characterized by $D$-independent but $d$-dependent criticality, offering a unified perspective on symmetry and dimensionality in nonequilibrium synchronization phenomena.

Title: An Exactly Solvable Model of Phase-Fluctuating Superconductivity in Cuprates: The Role of Partially Flat Bands
Authors: Y. Shi, F. Yang, L. Q. Chen
Abstract: Utilizing an exactly solvable Hubbard-like model that exhibits a pseudogap (PG) phase and a partially flat band, we perform self-consistent microscopic calculations of the superconductivity (SC) in cuprates, incorporating both thermal and zero-point superconducting phase fluctuations in the presence of long-range Coulomb interactions. The results reveal an important role of the partially flat band in determining phase-fluctuating SC as well as several key features that are consistent with experimental observations. Specifically, we find a dome-shaped $d$-wave superconducting region in the temperature-doping phase diagram with the optimal doping point located near the quantum critical point between the PG and the metallic phases. Near the optimal doping, the partially flat band suppresses and amplifies the fluctuation-induced destructing effect on the $d_{x^2-y^2}$- and $d_{xy}$-wave pairing, respectively, ensuring an absolutely dominant $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave SC. While the phase fluctuations of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave SC are relatively weak around optimal doping, they become significant in both underdoped and overdoped regimes. We then identify a discontinuity on the superconducting dome in underdoped regime that results from a transition from a strong- to a weak-phase-fluctuating state as doping approaches the optimal point.

Title: Finite Membrane Thickness Influences Hydrodynamics on the Nanoscale
Authors: Zachary G. Lipel, Yannick A. D. Omar, Dimitrios Fraggedakis
Abstract: Many lipid membrane-mediated transport processes--such as mechanically-gated channel activation and solute transport--involve structural and dynamical features on membrane thickness length scales. Most existing membrane models, however, tend to adopt (quasi-)two-dimensional descriptions that neglect thickness-dependent phenomena relevant to internal membrane mechanics, and thus do not fully account for the complex coupling of lipid membranes with their surrounding fluid media. Therefore, explicitly incorporating membrane thickness effects in lipid membrane models will enable a more accurate description of the influence of membrane/fluid coupling on transport phenomena in the vicinity of the bilayer surfaces. Here, we present a continuum model for membrane fluctuations that accounts for finite membrane thickness and resolves hydrodynamic interactions between the bilayer and its surrounding fluid. By applying linear response analysis, we observe that membrane thickness-mediated effects, such as bending-induced lipid reorientations, can generate shear flows close to the membrane surface that slow down the relaxation of nanometer scale shape fluctuations. Additionally, we reveal the emergence of pressure inversion and flow reversal near the membrane interfaces, accompanied by localized stagnation points. Among these, extensional stagnation points give rise to a novel mode of bulk dissipation, originating from bending-induced compression and expansion of the membrane surfaces and their coupling to shear stresses in the fluid. Our findings identify membrane thickness as a key factor in nanoscale hydrodynamics and suggest that its effects may be detectable in fluctuation spectra and can be relevant to interfacial processes such as solute permeability and contact with solid boundaries or other membranes.

Title: Development of precession Lorentz transmission electron microscopy
Authors: Shunsuke Hayashi, Dongxue Han, Hidenori Tsuji, Kyoko Ishizaka, Asuka Nakamura
Abstract: Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM) is a powerful tool for high-resolution imaging of magnetic textures, including their dynamics under external stimuli and ultrafast nonequilibrium conditions. However, magnetic imaging is often hindered by non-magnetic diffraction contrast arising from inhomogeneous sample deformation or a non-parallel electron beam. In this study, we develop a precession LTEM system that can suppress diffraction contrast by changing the incident angle of the electron beam relative to the sample in a precessional manner. By comparing LTEM images acquired at different precession angles ($\theta$), we show that diffraction contrast is significantly reduced with increasing $\theta$. However, large $\theta$ values lead to an undesired broadening of the magnetic contrast, highlighting the importance of optimizing $\theta$. Furthermore, defocus-dependent measurements reveal that magnetic contrast is particularly improved at small defocus values, suggesting that precession LTEM can achieve higher spatial resolution. These findings demonstrate the potential of precession LTEM as a powerful technique for studying magnetic dynamics.

Title: Mitigating Singlet Exciton Back-Transfer using 2D Spacer Layers for Perovskite-Sensitised Upconversion
Authors: Nicholas P. Sloane, Damon M. de Clercq, Md Arafat Mahmud, Jianghui Zheng, Adrian Mena, Michael P. Nielsen, Anita W.Y. Ho-Baillie, Christopher G. Bailey, Timothy W. Schmidt, Dane R. McCamey
Abstract: Photon upconversion has potential applications in light-emitting diodes, photocatalysis, bio-imaging, microscopy, 3D printing, and photovoltaics. Bulk lead-halide perovskite films have emerged as promising sensitisers for solid-state photon upconversion via triplet-triplet annihilation due to their excellent optoelectronic properties. In this system, a perovskite sensitiser absorbs photons and subsequently generates triplet excitons in an adjacent emitter material, where triplet-triplet annihilation can occur allowing for the emission of higher energy photons. However, a major loss pathway in perovskite-sensitised upconversion is the back-transfer of singlet excitons from the emitter to the sensitiser via Förster Resonance Energy Transfer. In this investigation we introduce a 2D perovskite spacer layer between the bulk perovskite sensitiser and a rubrene emitter to mitigate back-transfer of singlet excitons from rubrene to the bulk perovskite sensitiser. This modification reveals the inherent balance between efficient triplet exciton transfer across the interface with a potential barrier versus the mitigation of near-field back-transfer by increasing the distance between the sensitiser and singlet excitons in the emitter. Notably, the introduction of this spacer layer enhances the relative upconversion efficiency at lower excitation power densities while also sustaining performance over extended timescales. This work represents significant progress toward the practical applications of perovskite-sensitised photon upconversion.

Title: Core-Ionized States and X-ray Photoelectron Spectra of Solids From Periodic Algebraic Diagrammatic Construction Theory
Authors: Abdelrahman M. Ahmed, Alexander Yu. Sokolov
Abstract: We present the first-ever implementation and benchmark of periodic algebraic diagrammatic construction theory (ADC) for core-ionized states and X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) in crystalline materials. Using a triple-zeta Gaussian basis set and accounting for finite-size and scalar relativistic effects, the strict and extended second-order ADC approximations (ADC(2) and ADC(2)-X) predict the core ionization energies of weakly correlated solids within ~ 1.5 and 0.5 eV of experimental measurements, respectively. We further demonstrate that the ADC(2)-X method can capture the satellite features in XPS spectra of graphite, cubic and hexagonal boron nitride, and TiO2, albeit significantly overestimating their energies. The ADC(2)-X calculations reveal that the satellite transitions display strong configuration interaction with excitations involving several frontier orbitals delocalized in phase space. Our work demonstrates that ADC is a promising first-principles approach for simulating the core-excited states and X-ray spectra of materials, highlighting its potential and motivating further development.

Title: Atypical Ferrimagnetism in the case of Ni$_4$Nb$_2$O$_9$
Authors: Jhuma Sannigrahi, Roumita Roy, Richard Waite, Anupam Banerjee, Mohamad Numan, Manh Duc Le, D. T. Adroja, Dmitry Khalyavin, Sudipta Kanungo, Subham Majumdar
Abstract: Ferrimagnetism typically emerges from chemically distinct magnetic ions or mixed-valence states. In contrast, we discover an unconventional route to ferrimagnetism in Ni4Nb2O9, where identical Ni(2+) ions at crystallographically equivalent positions develop unequal magnetic moments purely due to differences in their local environments. Through a synergy of powder neutron diffraction, inelastic neutron scattering, first-principle-based calculations, we reveal that the Ni(A) and Ni(B) sublattices, despite sharing the same nominal valence, differ in octahedral distortion, magnetic dimensionality, and electronic structure. Ni(A) exhibits a quasi one-dimensional character, enhanced p-d hybridization, and reduced magnetic moment due to spin delocalization onto oxygen, while Ni(B) retains a nearly two-dimensional geometry and a full spin-1 moment. Our findings demonstrate that structural and electronic inequivalence alone can induce ferrimagnetism, offering a new design principle for materials with controllable magnetic compensation and anisotropy relevant for spintronic applications and beyond.

Title: Low-dimensional Bose-Bose Mixture in Random Speckle Potential
Authors: Avra Banerjee, Saswata Sahu, Dwipesh Majumder
Abstract: In this work, we have studied the effect of the repulsive speckle potential in a mixture of Bose-Einstein condensates in one dimension (1D) and two dimension (2D). We simulated linear and circular random speckle potentials in 1D and 2D, respectively. Our calculation shows that the condensate density forms a sharp ring in 2D, and the condensate is divided into two parts in 1D at a high impurity density of speckle potential. We have calculated the energy and chemical potential of the system by solving the Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation to see the stability of the condensate. In our study, we have seen that the nature of the impurity response is the same for one-dimensional and two-dimensional quantum droplets.

Title: Experimental Investigation of a Bipartite Quench in a 1D Bose gas
Authors: Léa Dubois, Guillaume Thémèze, Jérôme Dubail, Isabelle Bouchoule
Abstract: Long wavelength dynamics of 1D Bose gases with repulsive contact interactions can be captured by Generalized HydroDynamics (GHD) which predicts the evolution of the local rapidity distribution. The latter corresponds to the momentum distribution of quasiparticles, which have infinite lifetime owing to the integrability of the system. Here we experimentally investigate the dynamics for an initial situation that is the junction of two semi-infinite systems in different stationary states, a protocol referred to as "bipartite quench" protocol. More precisely we realise the particular case where one half of the system is the vacuum state. We show that the evolution of the boundary density profile exhibits ballistic dynamics obeying the Euler hydrodynamic scaling. The boundary profiles are similar to the ones predicted with zero-temperature GHD in the quasi-BEC regime, with deviations due to non-zero entropy effects. We show that this protocol, provided the boundary profile is measured with infinite precision, permits to reconstruct the rapidity distribution of the initial state. For our data, we extract the initial rapidity distribution by fitting the boundary profile and we use a 3-parameter ansatz that goes beyond the thermal assumption. Finally, we investigate the local rapidity distribution inside the boundary profile, which, according to GHD, presents, on one side, features of zero-entropy states. The measured distribution shows the asymmetry predicted by GHD, although unelucidated deviations remain.

Title: Diverse electronic phases correlated with twist-angle distribution and pseudomagnetic field in turbostratic graphene
Authors: Mona Garg, Ankit Kumar, Deepti Rana, Anmol Arya, Aswini R, Umesh Waghmare, G. U. Kulkarni, Goutam Sheet
Abstract: Twisted multilayer graphene has become a focal point of research due to its ability to host a range of quantum phases, including unconventional superconductivity, ferromagnetism, and strong correlation effects. In the present work, we address the challenge of investigating the diverse physics associated with a variety of twist-angles in a simple graphene platform which is economic and bypasses the tedious process of fabricating multiple devices, each with one twist angle. We used turbostratic graphene films containing a variety of twist angles characterized by distinct Moiré patterns observed through scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and distinct signatures recorded by Raman spectroscopy. From scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS), we show that the local twist angles remarkably correlate with the characteristic local electronic properties. Most remarkably, the films spontaneously generate strained wrinkles during growth, with certain wrinkled regions exhibiting robust strain-induced pseudo-magnetic fields, as recorded by ultra-low temperature STS.

Title: Ab initio X-ray Near-Edge Spectroscopy of Sodium-Based Multi-Alkali Antimonides
Authors: Chung Xu, Richard Schier, Caterina Cocchi
Abstract: Multi-alkali antimonides (MAAs) are promising materials for vacuum electron sources. While sodium-based MAAs have demonstrated superior characteristics for ultrabright electron sources, their synthesis remains challenging, often resulting in mixed stoichiometries and polycrystalline domains. To address this complexity and guide the characterization of experimentally grown photocathodes, we present a comprehensive theoretical study of the X-ray near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) of four ternary MAAs: cubic Na$_2$KSb and hexagonal NaK$_2$Sb, representing the experimentally known phase of each stoichiometry, as well as hexagonal Na$_2$KSb and cubic NaK$_2$Sb, two computationally predicted polymorphs. Employing state-of-the-art ab initio methods based on all-electron density-functional theory and the solution of the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE), we compute and analyze the XANES at the sodium and potassium K-edges, potassium L$_{2,3}$-edge, and antimony K and L$_2$-edges. Our analysis reveals distinct spectral fingerprints for the experimentally known phases, cubic Na$_2$KSb and hexagonal NaK$_2$Sb, particularly at the sodium K-edge and potassium L$_{2,3}$-edge, providing useful indications for their identification in complex samples. We further investigate the role of excitonic effects by comparing BSE spectra and their counterparts obtained in the independent-particle approximation, highlighting their significant influence on the near-edge features, especially for shallower core levels. Our findings offer a useful theoretical benchmark for the experimental characterization and diagnostics of sodium-based MAA photocathodes.

Title: Directed light emission from monolayers on 2D materials via optical interferences
Authors: Pavel Trofimov, Sabrina Juergensen, Adrián Dewambrechies Fernández, Kirill Bolotin, Stephanie Reich, Hélène Seiler
Abstract: Two-dimensional materials provide a rich platform to explore phenomena such as emerging electronic and excitonic states, strong light-matter coupling and new optoelectronic device concepts. The optical response of monolayers is entangled with the substrate on which they are grown or deposited on, often a two-dimensional material itself. Understanding how the properties of the two-dimensional monolayers can be tuned via the substrate is therefore essential. Here we employ angle-resolved reflectivity and photoluminescence spectroscopy on highly ordered molecular monolayers on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) to systematically investigate the angle-dependent optical response as a function of the thickness of the hBN flake. We observe that light reflection and emission occur in a strongly directed fashion and that the direction of light reflection and emission is dictated by the hBN flake thickness. Transfer matrix simulations reproduce the experimental data and show that optical interference effects in hBN are at the origin of the angle-dependent optical properties. While our study focuses on molecular monolayers on hBN, our findings are general and relevant for any 2D material placed on top of a substrate. Our findings demonstrate the need to carefully choose substrate parameters for a given experimental geometry but also highlight opportunities in applications such as lighting technology where the direction of light emission can be controlled via substrate thickness.

Title: Inferring charge noise source locations from correlations in spin qubits
Authors: Juan S. Rojas-Arias, Akito Noiri, Jun Yoneda, Peter Stano, Takashi Nakajima, Kenta Takeda, Takashi Kobayashi, Giordano Scappucci, Seigo Tarucha, Daniel Loss
Abstract: We investigate low-frequency noise in a spin-qubit device made in isotopically purified Si/Si-Ge. Observing sizable cross-correlations among energy fluctuations of different qubits, we conclude that these fluctuations are dominated by charge noise. At low frequencies, the noise spectra do not fit well a power law; rather, we can recognize a few individual two-level fluctuators (TLFs). We demonstrate that the noise cross-correlations allow one to get information on the spatial location of such individual TLFs.

Title: Quantum Monte Carlo study of the quasiparticle effective mass of the two-dimensional uniform electron liquid
Authors: S. Azadi, N.D. Drummond, A. Principi, R.V. Belosludov, M.S. Bahramy
Abstract: The real-space variation quantum Monte Carlo (VMC) and diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (DMC) are used to calculate the quasiparticle energy bands and the quasiparticle effective mass of the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic two-dimensional uniform electron liquid (2D-UEL)\@. The many-body finite-size errors are minimized by performing simulations for three system sizes with the number of electrons $N=146$, 218, and 302 for paramagnetic and $N=151$ for ferromagnetic systems. We consider 2D-UEL to be within the metallic density range $1\leq r_s \leq 5$. The VMC and DMC results predict that the quasiparticle effective mass $m^*$ of the paramagnetic 2D-UEL at high density $r_s=1$ is very close to 1, suggesting that effective mass renormalization due to electron-electron interaction is negligible. We find that $m^*$ of the paramagnetic 2D-UEL obtained by the VMC and DMC methods increases by $r_s$ but with different slopes. Our VMC and DMC results for ferromagnetic 2D-UEL indicate that $m^*$ decreases rapidly by reducing the density due to the strong suppression of the electron-electron interaction.

Title: Algorithm for finding local integrals of motion in quantum lattice models in the thermodynamic limit
Authors: J. Pawlowski, J. Herbrych, M. Mierzejewski
Abstract: Local integrals of motion (LIOMs) play a key role in understanding the stationary states of closed macroscopic systems. They were found for selected integrable systems via complex analytical calculations. The existence of LIOMs and their structure can also be studied via numerical methods, which, however, involve exact diagonalization of Hamiltonians, posing a bottleneck for such studies. We show that finding LIOMs in translationally invariant lattice models or unitary quantum circuits can be reduced to a problem for which one may numerically find an exact solution also in the thermodynamic limit. We develop and implement a simple algorithm and demonstrate the efficiency of this method by calculating LIOMs and the Mazur bounds for infinite integrable spin chains and unitary circuits. Finally, we demonstrate that this approach correctly identifies approximate LIOMs in nearly integrable spin ladders.

Title: Quantum Monte Carlo description of correlated electrons in two-dimensional FeSe
Authors: S. Azadi, A. Principi, R. V. Belosludov, T. D. Kühne, M.S. Bahramy
Abstract: Electronic correlation effects on the structural properties of double-layer FeSe are studied using variation and diffusion quantum Monte Carlo methods. The Slater-Jastrow many-body wavefunction with two different forms for the homogeneous two-body pair-correlation term is used. The ground-state energy of the system is obtained at the thermodynamic limit using two different trial wave functions called JDFT and JSD. Only the Jastrow factor is fully optimized in the JDFT wave function, while the Slater determinant comes from the density functional approximation. In the JSD trial wave function, the Slater determinant and the Jastrow factor are fully optimized simultaneously. We calculated the VMC and DMC energies as a function of interlayer separation for two different in-plane iron-iron bond lengths. Our QMC results indicate that the optimized interlayer separation decreases with increasing iron-iron bond length, driven by stretch. We found that a three- to two-dimensional phase transition increases the electron-electron correlation effects and shifts the system from moderately correlated to strongly correlated. The value of correlation energy implies that the Hubbard $U$ value, which is widely used in DFT+U calculations, for two-dimensional FeSe is larger than its value in bulk.

Title: Bipolar doping in van der Waals semiconductor through Flexo-doping
Authors: Bo Zhang, Hui Xia, Zhengdong Huang, Yaqian Liu, Jun Kang, Liaoxin Sun, Tianxin Li, Su-Huai Wei, Wei Lu
Abstract: Doping plays a key role in functionalizing semiconductor devices, yet traditional chemical approaches relying on foreign-atom incorporation suffer from doping-asymmetry, pronounced lattice disorder and constrained spatial resolution. Here, we demonstrate a physical doping technique to directly write nanoscale doping patterns into layered semiconductors (MoS2). By applying localized tensile and compressive stress via an atomic force microscopy probe, p and n type conductance are simultaneously written into the designed area with sub-100-nm resolution, as verified by spatially resolved capacitance and photocurrent experiments. Density functional theory calculations reveal strain-driven shifts of donor and acceptor levels, as large as several hundreds of meV, linking mechanical stress to semiconductor doping. Fabricated strain-engineered junction efficiently rectifies the current flow and performs logic operations with stable dynamic response. This strain-driven approach enables spatially precise doping in van der Waals materials without degrading crystallinity, offering a versatile platform for nanoscale semiconductor devices.

Title: Topological Devil's staircase in a constrained kagome Ising antiferromagnet
Authors: Afonso Rufino, Samuel Nyckees, Jeanne Colbois, Frédéric Mila
Abstract: We show that the constrained Ising model on the kagome lattice with infinite first and third neighbor couplings undergoes an infinite series of thermal first-order transitions at which, as in the Kasteleyn transition, linear defects of infinite length condense. However, their density undergoes abrupt jumps because of the peculiar structure of the low temperature phase, which is only partially ordered and hosts a finite density of zero-energy domain walls. The number of linear defects between consecutive zero-energy domain walls is quantized to integer values, leading to a devil's staircase of topological origin. By contrast to the devil's staircase of the ANNNI and related models, the wave-vector is not fixed to commensurate values inside each phase.

Title: Elastic properties of transition metal dichalcogenides
Authors: S. Azadi, A. Azhar, R. V. Belosludov, T. D. Kühne, M.S. Bahramy
Abstract: We present a comprehensive first-principles study of the structural and elastic properties of 2H-MX$_2$ transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) (M = W, Mo, Ta, Nb; X = S, Se). Using density functional theory with various van der Waals exchange-correlation functionals, we systematically investigate the influence of nonlocal interactions on lattice parameters, elastic constants, and mechanical moduli. Our results reveal a fundamental distinction between semiconducting and metallic TMDs: metallic compounds exhibit larger in-plane lattice parameters and reduced interlayer spacing, consistent with their bonding characteristics. We find that metallic TMDs display significantly lower in-plane stiffness and shear modulus compared to their semiconducting counterparts. We discuss this behaviour in the context of the observed charge density waves. In addition, we establish clear trends in the bulk, Young's, and shear moduli, demonstrating the role of atomic number and chemical composition in determining mechanical stability.

Title: Efficient parallel algorithms for free-energy calculation of millions of water molecules in the fluid phases
Authors: Luis Enrique Coronas, Oriol Vilanova, Giancarlo Franzese
Abstract: Simulating water droplets made up of millions of molecules and on timescales as needed in biological and technological applications is challenging due to the difficulty of balancing accuracy with computational capabilities. Most detailed descriptions, such as ab initio, polarizable, or rigid models, are typically constrained to a few hundred (for ab initio) or thousands of molecules (for rigid models). Recent machine learning approaches allow for the simulation of up to 4 million molecules with ab initio accuracy but only for tens of nanoseconds, even if parallelized across hundreds of GPUs. In contrast, coarse-grained models permit simulations on a larger scale but at the expense of accuracy or transferability. Here, we consider the CVF molecular model of fluid water, which bridges the gap between accuracy and efficiency for free-energy and thermodynamic quantities due to i) a detailed calculation of the hydrogen bond contributions at the molecular level, including cooperative effects, and ii) coarse-graining of the translational and rotational degrees of freedom of the molecules. The CVF model can reproduce the experimental equation of state and fluctuations of fluid water across a temperature range of 60 degrees around ambient temperature and from 0 to 50 MPa. In this work, we describe efficient parallel Monte Carlo algorithms executed on GPUs using CUDA, tailored explicitly for the CVF model. We benchmark accessible sizes of 17 million molecules with the Metropolis and 2 million with the Swendsen-Wang Monte Carlo algorithm.

Title: Magnetic anisotropy related to hybridization between Fe 3$d$ and As 4$p$ orbitals in a bcc Fe-As thin film
Authors: Takahito Takeda, Karumuri Sriharsha, Seiji Aota, Ryo Okano, Le Duc Anh, Yukiharu Takeda, Akira Yasui, Miho Kitamura, Yuki K. Wakabayashi, Atsushi Fujimori, Masaaki Tanaka, Masaki Kobayashi
Abstract: The magnetic anisotropy (MA) of Fe-based ferromagnetic thin films has been extensively studied for device applications. The examined material is a new Fe-based ferromagnetic thin film, bcc Fe$_{1-x}$As$_x$ (Fe-As) with the in-plane MA (IMA) grown on a GaAs (111)B substrate. The magnetic properties of the Fe-As thin film have been investigated by Xray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) and magnetic circular dichroism in hard X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (MCD-HAXPES) to elucidate the role of As ions in the IMA. The XMCD spectra at the Fe $L_{2,3}$ edge and MCD-HAXPES spectra of the Fe 2$p$ core level exhibit ferromagnetic and metallic features like Fe metal. The XMCD at the As $L_{2,3}$ edge demonstrates that the As ions contribute to the ferromagnetism of bcc Fe-As through the hybridization between the Fe 3$d$ and As 4$p$ orbitals. The estimations of the magnetic moments of Fe using the XMCD sum rules have revealed that the orbital magnetic moment is isotropic and the magnetic dipole term is anisotropic. The anisotropy of the magnetic dipole term can be attributed to the anisotropic $p-d$ hybridization due to epitaxial strain, contributing to the IMA of bcc Fe-As. Our findings enlighten the mechanism of the MA of the non-magnetic ion-doped bcc Fe thin film, which can be applied to other magnetic 3$d$ transition metal thin films doped with non-magnetic elements.

Title: Synthetic gauge field enabled realization of bulk- and edge-transported states in an aperiodic acoustic structure
Authors: Y. X. Fang, W. H. Zhu, Y. Cai, X. H. Li, M. Q. Zhang, J. Huang, Y. Li, S. Q. Wu
Abstract: Topologically protected edge states with immunity against various disorders have been implemented in a variety of topological insulators. In this Letter, we reveal that Landau levels in aperiodic acoustic structures can be achieved under different pseudomagnetic fields (PMFs). The produced zero order Landau modes (ZOLMs) could transmit along the channels at the interior or exterior of the inhomogeneous array, which are separately termed as "bulk-transported states" (BTSs) and "edge-transported states" (ETSs). Distinct from conventional valley edge states, the ZOLMs show intriguing self-collimation feature. If a pseudoelectric field (PEF) is further included, the combination of a PMF and PEF can result in the formation of bulk or edge Landau rainbow, where Landau zero modes are distributed at various positions of the bulk or boundary of the sample at different frequencies. The synthetic-gauge-field-controlled topological states can enable fully control of robust transmission, and using the entire footprint of a topological lattice. Our findings not only profoundly advance the current understanding of topological phase matter but also offer new avenues for constructing topological acoustic devices.

Title: Luminescent Platform for Thermal Sensing and Imaging Based on Structural Phase-Transition
Authors: Anam Javaid, Maja Szymczak, Malgorzata Kubicka, Vasyl Kinzhybalo, Marek Drozd, Damian Szymanski, Lukasz Marciniak
Abstract: The remarkable sensitivity of the luminescent properties of Eu3+ ions to structural changes in host materials has been well-explored for years. However, the application of this feature of Eu3+ in materials exhibiting thermally induced structural phase transitions for the development of luminescent thermometers has only recently been proposed. The narrow operating range of such thermometers necessitates the exploration of new host materials. In response to this demand, this study carefully analyzes the spectroscopic properties of X as a function of temperature and dopant ion concentration. As demonstrated, X undergoes a phase transition from a low-temperature monoclinic phase to a high-temperature trigonal structure, resulting in significant changes in both the emission spectrum shape of Eu ions and the depopulation kinetics of the 5D0 level. Consequently, X can be utilized as both a ratiometric and a lifetime-based luminescence thermometer, achieving maximal relative sensitivities of 3.4 and 1.0 or the respective approaches. Additionally, this work highlights how increasing the concentration of Eu3+ ions enables the tuning of the thermal operating range to achieve optimal thermometric performance. Moreover, an implementation of ratiometric approach of temperature sensing and imaging with X using digital camera without filters was demonstrated. This is the first report that demonstrates thermal imaging using Eu3+-solely doped phosphor. This finding underscores the potential of X as a versatile host material for advanced luminescent thermometry applications.

Title: Generation of non-equilibrium spin-motive force at the surface of a topological insulator induced by current-driven domain wall motion in the magnetic substrate
Authors: Reza Fazeli Mehrabani, Babak Abdollahipour, Hakimeh Mohammadpour, Arash Phirouznia
Abstract: The generalized Faraday method can be used for computation of spin-motive force (SMF) within the unitary transformation approach. Meanwhile, the unitary transformation approach, which could be employed to obtain an effective collinear exchange interaction of non-collinear magnetic structures, cannot be used when the other parts of the Hamiltonian contain spin-dependent couplings. In the current study, the method of unitary transformation has been generalized to systems with spin-momentum coupling. In this way, the SMF at topological insulator surfaces has been computed analytically.

Title: Surface mobility of a glass-forming polymer in an ionic liquid
Authors: Xinyu Zhang (CUHK), Christian Pedersen (UiO), Haoqi Zhu (CUHK), Siming Wang (CUHK), Yuchen Fu (CUHK), Liang Dai (CUHK), Andreas Carlson (UiO), Thomas Salez (LOMA), Yu Chai (CUHK)
Abstract: The free surface of glassy polymers exhibits enhanced segmental dynamics compared to the bulk, forming a liquid-like layer that lowers the glass transition temperature (Tg) in nanometersized polymer samples. Recent studies have shown that immersing polymers in ionic liquids can suppress this enhanced surface dynamics. To investigate how ionic liquids influence polymer dynamics near the ionic-liquid-polymer interface, we measure the surface leveling of nanometersized stepped polystyrene films immersed in ionic liquids, and compared the results to the case of films in vacuum. Our results reveal that ionic liquids significantly slow the leveling process both above and below Tg. However, our results indicate that the liquid-like surface layer below Tg does exist in ionic liquids. Numerical solutions of the thin-film equation, incorporating appropriate boundary conditions, show that the surface mobility of PS films in ionic liquids can match that of PS films in vacuum. Thus, while ionic liquids alter the polymer flow process, they do not eliminate the dynamical heterogeneity inherent to glassy polymers.

Title: Unravelling the Antimicrobial Action Mechanism of Ribosomal Protein S30
Authors: J. Bhatt Mitra, V. K. Sharma, M. Kumar, V. Garcia Sakai, A. Mukherjee
Abstract: Ribosomal protein S30 (RS30) exhibits potent antimicrobial activity against a broad spectrum of bacteria. Despite its efficacy, the underlying action mechanism remained elusive. In this study, we unravel the fundamental mechanism by which RS30 exerts its bactericidal effects, using a combination of microbiological assays and advanced biophysical techniques. Microbiological analyses reveal that RS30 kills bacteria primarily through membrane depolarization, despite limited membrane permeabilization, indicating an unconventional mode of action involving no or partial lysis of the membrane. Importantly, RS30 demonstrates time-dependent bactericidal activity with no detectable cytotoxicity toward mammalian cells, underscoring its high selectivity. This selective action was further confirmed using biophysical experiments on model membrane systems composed of anionic (bacterial mimic) and zwitterionic (mammalian mimic) phospholipids. Our measurements suggested that RS30 preferentially binds to anionic membranes via electrostatic interactions, undergoes a conformational transition from a random coil to an {\alpha}-helix upon binding, and induces vesicle aggregation. Quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS) measurements provide microscopic insights, showing that RS30 significantly restricts the lateral diffusion of anionic lipids, thereby perturbing membrane dynamics and increasing susceptibility to external stress. Together, our findings uncover important insights into the antimicrobial action mechanism of RS30, characterized by selective membrane interaction, structural transformation, and dynamic modulation of lipid membranes.

Title: Periodic implementation of the random phase approximation with numerical atomic orbitals and dual reciprocal space grids
Authors: Edoardo Spadetto, Pier Herman Theodoor Philipsen, Arno Förster, Lucas Visscher
Abstract: The random phase approximation (RPA) has emerged as a prominent first-principles method in material science, particularly to study the adsorption and chemisorption of small molecules on surfaces. However, its widespread application is hampered by its relatively high computational cost. Here, we present a well-parallelised implementation of the RPA with localised atomic orbitals and pair-atomic density fitting, which is especially suitable for studying two-dimensional systems. Through a dual $\textbf{k}$-grid scheme, we achieve fast and reliable convergence of RPA correlation energies to the thermodynamic limit. We demonstrate the efficacy of our implementation through an application to the adsorption of CO on MgO(001) using PBE input orbitals (RPA@PBE) Our calculated adsorption energy in in good agreement with previously published RPA@PBE studies, but, as expected, overestimates the experimentally available adsorption energies as well as recent CCSD(T) results.

Title: Engineering Morphologies of Metal Colloidal Assemblies via Colloid Jamming at Liquid-Liquid Interfaces
Authors: Jiyuan Yao, Shuting Xie, Shijian Huang, Weilong Xu, Jiaqin Li, Zhenping Liu, Mingliang Jin, Loes I. Segerink, Lingling Shui, Sergii Pud
Abstract: Self-assemblies, structured via nanoparticles, show promise as materials for advanced applications, like photonic devices, electrochemical energy storage units and catalysis support. Despite observing diverse morphologies, a comprehensive understanding of the formation mechanism remains elusive. In this work, we show that the coordination interaction between metal sulfide nanoparticles (MS NPs) and the fluorosurfactants at the droplet interface influences the morphology during the evaporation-induced self-assembly facilitated by droplet microfluidics. Further investigation into fluorosurfactants with various chemical groups and MS NPs reveals that the strength of coordination interactions significantly influences assembly morphology. The interfacial interactions can be eliminated through coating a SiO2 layer on the metal colloid (M@SiO2 NPs). In addition, we demonstrate that the morphologies of the self-assemblies can be engineered via the coordination interactions between the MS NPs and fluorosurfactants, and by varying the concentrations of MS NPs. Utilizing these interfacial interactions, assemblies with core-shell and homogeneous distribution of binary nanoparticles were constructed. Our findings offer novel insights into the interfacial jamming of nanoparticles at the droplet interface through evaporation-induced self-assembly, and into the design of metal colloidal assemblies with diverse morphologies, crucial for developing novel functional assemblies for catalysis, plasmonic, and porous materials in a controlled manner.

Title: An Extension of the Adiabatic Theorem
Authors: Sarah Damerow, Stefan Kehrein
Abstract: We examine the validity of a potential extension of the adiabatic theorem to quantum quenches, i.e., non-adiabatic changes. In particular, the Transverse Field Ising Model (TFIM) and the Axial Next Nearest Neighbour Ising (ANNNI) model are studied. The proposed extension of the adiabatic theorem is stated as follows: Consider the overlap between the initial ground state and the post-quench Hamiltonian eigenstates for quenches within the same phase. This overlap is largest for the post-quench ground state. In the case of the TFIM, this conjecture is confirmed for both the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases numerically and analytically. In the ANNNI model, the conjecture could be analytically proven for a special case. Numerical methods were employed to investigate the conjecture's validity beyond this special case.

Title: Polymer-Shell Coating of Mie-Resonant Silicon Nanospheres for Controlled Fabrication of Self-Assembled Monolayer
Authors: Oanh Vu, Jialu Song, Hiroshi Sugimoto, Minoru Fujii
Abstract: A polymer shell offers a unique opportunity to tailor structural and optical properties of optically functional nanoparticles and their ensembles. Here, we develop a process to coat Mie-resonant silicon nanospheres (Si NSs) with a thermoresponsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) hydrogel shell. We show formation of a PNIPAM shell of controlled thickness from the change of the hydrodynamic diameter and study the effect of thermoresponsive shrinkage and expansion of the shell on the Mie resonance of a Si NS. We then demonstrate that Si NSs with PNIPAM shells enable fabrication of cluster-free, self-assembled monolayers of Si NSs, in which distances between NSs are controlled by the PNIPAM shell thickness.

Title: Surface Nematic Uniformity
Authors: Andrea Pedrini, Epifanio G. Virga
Abstract: An ant-like observer confined to a two-dimensional surface traversed by stripes would wonder whether this striped landscape could be devised in such a way as to appear to be the same wherever they go. Differently stated, this is the problem studied in this paper. In a more technical jargon, we determine all possible uniform nematic fields on a smooth surface. It was already known that for such a field to exist, the surface must have constant negative Gaussian curvature. Here, we show that all uniform nematic fields on such a surface are parallel transported (in Levi-Civita's sense) by special systems of geodesics, which (with scant inventiveness) are termed uniform. We prove that, for every geodesic on the surface, there are two systems of uniform geodesics that include it; they are conventionally called right and left, to allude at a possible intrinsic definition of handedness. We found explicitly all uniform fields for Beltrami's pseudosphere. Since both geodesics and uniformity are preserved under isometries, by a classical theorem of Minding, the solution for the pseudosphere carries over all other admissible surfaces, thus providing a general solution to the problem (at least in principle).

Title: Synthetic spin-orbit coupling in superconductor-semiconductor hybrid nanowires with micromagnet arrays
Authors: M.P. Hynes, D. Burke, K. Ganesh, A. Vekris, B.J. Villis, J.C. Gartside, T. Kanne, J. Nygård, K. Moors, W.R. Branford, M.R. Connolly, M.R. Buitelaar
Abstract: Spin-orbit interaction accounts for the coupling of momentum and spin degrees of freedom of electrons and holes in semiconductor materials. In quantum information processing, it allows for electrical control of spin states and for the engineering of topologically protected Majorana zero modes. Although such functionalities were previously considered to be limited to semiconductor materials with strong intrinsic spin-orbit interactions only, recent theoretical work proposes using external rotating magnetic fields to engineer synthetic spin-orbit coupling. This would relax material constraints and open up new research directions for materials with low intrinsic spin-orbit interaction or augment existing spin-orbit interaction in materials in which this interaction is already strong. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of this approach and introduce rotating magnetic fields along an InAs/Al hybrid nanowire using permalloy micromagnet arrays which yields an estimated synthetic Rashba spin-orbit interaction coefficient of 0.022 eV nm. We use transport spectroscopy and the energy dependence of Andreev bound states in the nanowires as a probe of the magnetic field profiles of the micromagnets which are reconfigurably prepared in parallel or antiparallel magnetization configurations.

Title: Electron Spin Resonance of Eu on triangular layers in EuT2P2 (T =Mn, Zn, Cd)
Authors: Jörg Sichelschmidt, Pierre Chailloleau, Sarah Krebber, Asmaa El Mard, Cornelius Krellner, Kristin Kliemt
Abstract: We report on the electron spin resonance (ESR) of Eu$^{2+}$ in Eu$T_{2}$P$_{2}$ ($T$=Mn, Zn, Cd) single crystals. The temperature dependencies of ESR linewidth and resonance shift show a similar behaviour when approaching the Eu-ordered state -- a divergence towards $T_{\rm N}$, indicating the growing importance of magnetic correlations and the build-up of internal magnetic fields. For $T$=Mn an additional temperature scale of $\approx 47$~K has considerable impact on linewidth, resonance field and intensity. This points to the presence of Mn magnetic correlations which yet were not reported.

Title: Modeling complex particle suspensions: perspectives on the rigid multiblob method
Authors: Blaise Delmotte, Florencio Balboa Usabiaga
Abstract: Many suspensions contain particles with complex shapes that are affected not only by hydrodynamics, but also by thermal fluctuations, internal kinematic constraints and other long-range non-hydrodynamic interactions. Modeling these systems represents a significant numerical challenge due to the interplay between different effects and the need to accurately capture multiscale phenomena. In this article we review recent developments to model large suspensions of particles of arbitrary shapes and multiple couplings with controllable accuracy within the rigid multiblob framework. We discuss the governing equations, highlight key numerical developments, and illustrate applications ranging from microswimmers to complex colloidal suspensions. This review illustrates the effectiveness and versatility of the rigid multiblob method in tackling a wide range of physical problems in fluid mechanics, soft matter physics, biophysics, materials and colloidal science.

Title: Engineering inter-band coupling in a two-band superconductor by topological defects
Authors: Thomas Gozlinski, Qili Li, Rolf Heid, Oleg Kurnosikov, Alexander Haas, Ryohei Nemoto, Toyo Kazu Yamada, Joerg Schmalian, Wulf Wulfhekel
Abstract: The vast majority of superconductors have more than one Fermi surface, on which the electrons pair below the critical temperature TC, yet their superconducting behavior can be well described by a single-band Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory. This is mostly due to inter-band scattering, especially in superconductors in the dirty limit, rigidly linking the pairing amplitude of the different bands. This effect has severely limited experimental studies of the complex physics of multi-band superconductivity. In this study, we utilize the fact that elementary Pb - as a clean limit system - has two Fermi surfaces that are only weakly coupled by inter-band scattering, allowing the formation of two separate condensates. By studying elementary crystal defects in the form of stacking faults with our millikelvin scanning tunneling microscope, we show how to locally tune inter-band coupling ranging from weak to strong coupling and modify the superconducting order parameters around defects. The experiments critically test the theory of multi-band superconductors and give a route to access a wide range of predicted quantum effects in these systems.

Title: The role of non-equilibrium populations in dark exciton formation

Matthijs Jansen, Junde Liu, Daniel Steil, Stephan Hofmann, R. Thomas Weitz, Ermin Malic, Stefan Mathias, Marcel Reutzel
Abstract: In two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide structures, the optical excitation of a bright exciton may be followed by the formation of a plethora of lower energy dark states. In these formation and relaxation processes between different exciton species, non-equilibrium exciton and phonon populations play a dominant role, but remain so far largely unexplored as most states are inaccessible by regular spectroscopies. Here, on the example of homobilayer 2H-MoS$_2$, we realize direct access to the full exciton relaxation cascade from experiment and theory. By measuring the energy- and in-plane momentum-resolved photoemission spectral function, we reveal a distinct fingerprint for dark excitons in a non-equilibrium excitonic occupation distribution. In excellent agreement with microscopic many-particle calculations, we quantify the timescales for the formation of a non-equilibrium dark excitonic occupation and its subsequent thermalization to 85~fs and 150~fs, respectively. Our results provide a previously inaccessible view of the complete exciton relaxation cascade, which is of paramount importance for the future characterization of non-equilibrium excitonic phases and the efficient design of optoelectronic devices based on two-dimensional materials.

Title: Neutron scattering studies of complex lattice dynamics in energy materials
Authors: Qingyong Ren, Jianli Wang, Bing Li, Jie Ma, Xin Tong
Abstract: Lattice dynamics play a crucial role in understanding the physical mechanisms of cutting-edge energy materials. Many excellent energy materials have complex multiple-sublattice structures, with intricate lattice dynamics, and the underlying mechanisms are difficult to understand. Neutron scattering technologies, which are known for their high energy and momentum resolution, are powerful tools for simultaneously characterizing material structure and complex lattice dynamics. In recent years, neutron scattering techniques have made significant contributions to the study of energy materials, shedding light on their physical mechanisms. This review article details several neutron scattering techniques commonly used in energy material research, including neutron diffraction, total neutron scattering, quasi-elastic and inelastic neutron scattering. Then, some important research progress made in the field of energy materials in recent years using neutron scattering as the main characterization method is reviewed, including ultra-low lattice thermal conductivity in superionic thermoelectric materials, ion diffusion mechanism of solid-state electrolytes, plastic-crystalline phase transition and configuration entropy changes in barocaloric materials, lattice anharmonicity and charge transport in photovoltaic materials, and first-order magnetic-structural phase transition in magnetocaloric materials. In these complex energy conversion and storage materials, lattice dynamics do not work independently, and their functioning in macroscopic physical properties is always achieved through correlation or mutual coupling with other degrees of freedom, such as sublattices, charge, spin, etc. Through these typical examples, this review paper can provide a reference for further exploring and understanding the energy materials and lattice dynamics.

Title: Photovoltaic Hall Effect by Electric Field-Induced Berry Curvature and Energy Shift
Authors: Yuta Murotani, Tomohiro Fujimoto, Ryusuke Matsunaga
Abstract: Helicity-dependent photocurrents perpendicular to a bias electric field have attracted considerable attention as an expression of optically controlled Berry curvature in Floquet engineering. More recent studies have revealed a larger contribution by the momentum asymmetry of photocarriers to this photovoltaic Hall effect, although its physical mechanism has not yet been elucidated. In this study, we describe this phenomenon as a circular photogalvanic effect caused by an electric field-induced Berry curvature. The shift vector provides an additional contribution through the energy shift of interband transitions. A resonant enhancement of the transverse photocurrent occurs in GaAs owing to the topological character of the valence band. Our results present a geometric picture of the third-order nonlinear response under light and bias fields, shedding new light on Berry curvature engineering.

Title: Validating Griffith fracture propagation in the phase-field approach to fracture: The case of Mode III by means of the trousers test
Authors: F. Kamarei, E. Breedlove, O. Lopez-Pamies
Abstract: At present, there is an abundance of results showing that the phase-field approach to fracture in elastic brittle materials -- when properly accounting for material strength -- describes the \emph{nucleation} of fracture from large pre-existing cracks in a manner that is consistent with the Griffith competition between bulk deformation energy and surface fracture energy. By contrast, results that demonstrate the ability of this approach to describe Griffith fracture \emph{propagation} are scarce and restricted to Mode I. Aimed at addressing this lacuna, the main objective of this paper is to show that the phase-field approach to fracture describes Mode III fracture propagation in a manner that is indeed consistent with the Griffith energy competition. This is accomplished via direct comparisons between phase-field predictions for fracture propagation in the so-called \emph{trousers} \emph{test} and the corresponding results that emerge from the Griffith energy competition. The latter are generated from full-field finite-element solutions that -- as an additional critical contribution of this paper -- also serve to bring to light the hitherto unexplored limitations of the classical Rivlin-Thomas-Greensmith formulas that are routinely used to analyze the trousers test.

Title: A Piezoelectric Molecular Cocrystal with Unconventional $π$-Stacking
Authors: Samuel G. Dunning, Aldo Raeliarijaona, Piotr A. Guńka, Anirudh Hari, Dongzhou Zhang, Ronald E. Cohen, Timothy A. Strobel
Abstract: We demonstrate the crystallization of a polar octafluoronaphthalene (OFN, \OFN)--phthalazine (Phth, \Phth) cocrystal, formed in a 1:2 ratio by slow evaporation. The crystal structure and vibrational properties of the cocrystal were determined using powder/single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and confirmed with density functional theory (DFT) and density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) calculations. The molecular $\pi$-stacking of aromatic rings is unconventional compared with other arene--perfluoroarene cocrystals. Phth molecules are offset and misaligned with respect to the major axis of OFN due to electrostatic repulsion between N and F atoms, enabling overall electric polarization attributed to the dipole moment of Phth. Our calculations show that OFN:2Phth is an insulator with a band gap of $\sim$2.4 eV. The electric polarization was calculated to be 7.1 \muC, while the shear piezoelectric coefficient ($d_{34}$) may be as large as 11.4 pC N$^{-1}$.

Title: Above-room-temperature ferromagnetism in large-area epitaxial Fe3GaTe2/graphene van der Waals heterostructures

Abstract: Fe3GaTe2 (FGaT), a two-dimensional (2D) layered ferromagnetic metal, exhibits a high Curie temperature (TC) ~ 360 K along with strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), making it a promising material candidate for next-generation energy-efficient magnetic devices. However, the vast majority of studies on FGaT to date have been limited to millimeter-sized bulk crystals and exfoliated flakes, which are unsuitable for practical applications and integration into device processing. Also, its combination with other 2D materials to form van der Waals heterostructures has only been achieved by flake stacking. Consequently, the controlled large-scale growth of FGaT and related heterostructures remains largely unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate a breakthrough in the high-quality, large-scale growth of epitaxial FGaT thin films on single-crystalline graphene/SiC templates using molecular beam epitaxy. Structural characterization confirms the high crystalline quality of the continuous FGaT/graphene van der Waals heterostructures. Temperature-dependent magnetization and anomalous Hall measurements reveal robust PMA with an enhanced TC well above room temperature, reaching up to 400 K. Furthermore, X-ray absorption and X-ray magnetic circular dichroism spectra provide insight into the spin and orbital magnetic moment contributions, further validating the high TC and robust PMA. These findings are highly significant for the future development of high-performance spintronic devices based on 2D heterostructures, with potential applications in next-generation data storage, logic processing and quantum technologies.

Title: Hexagonal ice density dependence on inter atomic distance changes due to nuclear quantum effects
Authors: Lucas T. S. de Miranda, Márcio S. Gomes-Filho, Mariana Rossi, Luana S. Pedroza, Alexandre R. Rocha
Abstract: Hexagonal ice ($\rm{I_h}$), the most common structure of ice, displays a variety of fascinating properties. Despite major efforts, a theoretical description of all its properties is still lacking. In particular, correctly accounting for its density and interatomic interactions is of utmost importance as a stepping stone for a deeper understanding of other properties. Deep potentials are a recent alternative to investigate the properties of {\iceIH}, which aims to match the accuracy of \textit{ab initio} simulations with the simplicity and scalability of classical molecular dynamics. This becomes particularly significant if one wishes to address nuclear quantum effects. In this work, we use machine learning potentials obtained for different exchange and correlation functionals to simulate the structural and vibrational properties of {\iceIH}. We show that most functionals overestimate the density of ice compared to experimental results. Furthermore, a quantum treatment of the nuclei leads to even further distancing from experiments. We understand this by highlighting how different inter-atomic interactions play a role in obtaining the equilibrium density. In particular, different from water clusters and bulk water, nuclear quantum effects lead to stronger H-bonds in {\iceIH}.

Title: Role of defects in atom probe analysis of sol-gel silica

Abstract: Silica is a suitable material to encapsulate proteins at room temperature, enabling their analysis at the atomic level using laser-assisted atom probe tomography (La- APT). In this study, we show that UV and deep-UV lasers can achieve a high success rate in La-APT of silica in terms of chemical resolution and three-dimensional image volume, with both lasers providing comparable results. Since the La-APT analyses are driven by photon absorption, in order to understand the mechanisms behind the enhanced absorption of UV light, we performed density functional theory calculations to model the electronic and optical properties of amorphous silica matrices generated using a Monte Carlo approach to structural optimisation. In particular, we have investigated the role of various defects introduced during sample preparation, such as substitutional and interstitial carbon, sodium and gallium ions, and hydrogen. Our results show that the presence of defects increases the absorption of silica in the UV and deep-UV range and thus improves the La-APT capabilities of the material. However, due to the low density of free charge carriers resulting from the absorption of laser energy by defects, deviations from the nominal chemical composition and suboptimal chemical resolution may occur, potentially limiting the optimal acquisition of APT mass spectra.

Title: Edelstein effect in optically driven monolayer jacutingaite Pt$_2$HgSe$_3$
Authors: Nguyen Quang Bau, Ta Thi Tho, Le Thi Thu Phuong, Bui Dinh Hoi
Abstract: The optical control of spin- and valley-selective gapless states in two-dimensional materials presents new opportunities for next-generation spintronic and valleytronic technologies. In this work, we study monolayer jacutingaite (Pt$_2$HgSe$_3$), a quantum spin Hall insulator with strong intrinsic spin-orbit coupling, under irradiation by circularly polarized light. The light-induced Floquet engineering gives rise to tunable topological phases, including transitions to spin- and valley-polarized semimetallic states. To probe these topological transitions, we employ the spin and orbital Edelstein effects -- non-equilibrium responses arising from spin-orbit interactions in systems lacking inversion symmetry -- without resorting to topological invariants such as Chern numbers. We identify universal signatures of the phase transitions encoded in the Edelstein response: a pronounced discontinuity in the spin Edelstein conductivity and a vanishing orbital Edelstein susceptibility mark the onset of the semimetallic regime. Furthermore, we investigate how the growth and suppression of the spin Edelstein responses across the topological phase transition depend on the interband scattering time. These findings establish the Edelstein effect as a sensitive and experimentally accessible probe of light-induced topological transitions in quantum materials.

Title: Control of encounter kinetics by chemically active droplets
Authors: Jacques Fries, Roxanne Berthin, Marie Jardat, Pierre Illien, Vincent Dahirel
Abstract: Biomolecular condensates play a crucial role in the spatial organization of living matter. These membrane-less organelles, resulting from liquid-liquid phase separation, operate far from thermodynamic equilibrium, with their size and stability influenced by non-equilibrium chemical reactions. While condensates are frequently considered optimized nanoreactors that enhance molecular encounters, their actual impact on reaction kinetics remains unclear due to competing effects such as diffusion hindrance, and random trapping in non-specific condensates. In this study, we develop a microscopic, stochastic model for chemically active droplets, incorporating reaction-driven modulation of protein interactions. Using Brownian dynamics simulations, we investigate how protein interactions and active coupling to a free energy reservoir influence phase separation, molecular transport and reaction kinetics. We demonstrate that the intensity of the chemical drive governs surface dynamics, generating fluxes that modulate bimolecular reaction rates. Comparing active emulsions to homogeneous systems, we reveal that condensates can either accelerate or decelerate molecular encounters. Our findings provide key insights into the role of biomolecular condensates as potential regulators of intracellular reaction kinetics.

Title: Entanglement dynamics and Page curves in random permutation circuits
Authors: Dávid Szász-Schagrin, Michele Mazzoni, Bruno Bertini, Katja Klobas, Lorenzo Piroli
Abstract: The characterization of ensembles of many-qubit random states and their realization via quantum circuits are crucial tasks in quantum-information theory. In this work, we study the ensembles generated by quantum circuits that randomly permute the computational basis, thus acting classically on the corresponding states. We focus on the averaged entanglement and present two main results. First, we derive generically tight upper bounds on the entanglement that can be generated by applying permutation circuits to arbitrary initial states. We show that the late-time ``entanglement Page curves'' are bounded in terms of the initial state participation entropies and its overlap with the ``maximally antilocalized'' state. Second, comparing the averaged Rényi-$2$ entropies generated by $(i)$ an infinitely deep random circuit of two-qubit gates and $(ii)$ global random permutations, we show that the two quantities are different for finite $N$ but the corresponding Page curves coincide in the thermodynamic limit. We also discuss how these conclusions are modified by additional random phases or considering circuits of $k$-local gates with $k\geq 3$. Our results are exact and highlight the implications of classical features on entanglement generation in many-body systems.

Title: Discovering novel order parameters in the Potts model: A bridge between machine learning and critical phenomena
Authors: Yi-Lun Du, Nan Su, Konrad Tywoniuk
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models trained on Ising spin configurations have demonstrated surprising effectiveness in classifying phases of Potts models, even when processing severely reduced representations that retain only two spin states. To unravel this remarkable capability, we identify a family of novel alternative order parameters for the $q=3$ and $q=4$ Potts models on a square lattice, constructed from the occupancies of secondary and minimal spin states rather than the conventional dominant-state order parameter. Through systematic finite-size scaling analyses, we demonstrate that these observables, including a magnetization-like observable derived from a reduced spin representation, accurately capture critical behavior, yielding critical temperatures and exponents consistent with established theoretical predictions and numerical benchmarks. Furthermore, we rigorously establish the fundamental relationships between these alternative order parameters, demonstrating how they collectively encode criticality through different aspects of spin configurations. Our results provide a thermodynamic basis for ML's success in reduced representations. This work bridges data-driven ML approaches with fundamental statistical mechanics, showing that criticality in Potts systems can be encoded in more compact, non-traditional forms, and opens avenues for discovering analogous order parameters in broader spin systems.

Title: Controlling the morphologies and dynamics in three-dimensional tissues
Authors: Rajsekhar Das, Xin Li, Sumit Sinha, D. Thirumalai
Abstract: A number of factors, such as, cell-cell interactions and self-propulsion of cells driven by cytoskeletal forces determine tissue morphologies and dynamics. To explore the interplay between these factors in controlling the dynamics at the tissue scale, we created a minimal three dimensional model in which short-range repulsive elastic forces account for cell-cell interactions. Self-propulsion is modeled as active uncorrelated random stochastic forces, with strength $\mu$, that act on individual cells and is the only source of cell motility. Strikingly, variations in polydispersity in cell sizes ($\Sigma$) and cell elasticity ($E$), results in the formation of a variety of distinct ``phases", driven entirely by $\mu$. At low $E$, the tissue behaves like a liquid, at all values of $\Sigma$, whereas at high $E$ and $\Sigma$, it has the characteristics of a glass. The tissue crystallizes at low $\Sigma$ provided $E$ exceeds a critical value. Over a narrow range of $E$ and $\Sigma$, that lies between the boundaries of the liquid and glass phase, the effective viscosity increases like in a glass as the cell density increases and saturates as the cells are compressed beyond a certain value, creating the viscosity saturation (VS) phase. The VS phase does not form in systems at finite temperature in which the dynamics satisfies the Fluctuation Dissipation Theorem. In the glass phase, the tissue exhibits aging (relaxation times depend on the waiting time) behavior at high $E$ values. Our findings provide a framework for designing tissues with tunable material properties by controlling the physical characteristics of cells.

Title: Non-Hermitian Exchange as the Origin of Chirality-Induced Spin Selectivity
Authors: Pius M. Theiler, Sander Driessen, Matthew C. Beard
Abstract: For over two decades, the role of structural chirality in spin polarization has been widely investigated, with implications for the origins of life, catalysis, and quantum phenomena. Yet, it remains unclear whether all chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effects arise from a common mechanism. We show that breaking all mirror symmetries in structurally chiral electron systems enforces a twin-pair electron exchange, inherently violating both parity P and time-reversal T symmetry while preserving combined PT-symmetry of the Hamiltonian. This exchange produces chiral quantum states where electron spin and motion are intrinsically linked, a key feature of CISS. At interfaces, these states drive spin and charge accumulation via spin-momentum locking. Our findings establish a new paradigm connecting quantum statistics, non-Hermitian physics, and spin transport with structural chirality. This framework unifies all observed CISS effects and provides guiding principles for designing chiral materials for spintronic and quantum applications.

Title: New Advances in Phonons: From Band Topology to Quasiparticle Chirality
Authors: Tiantian Zhang, Yizhou Liu, Hu Miao, Shuichi Murakami
Abstract: Phonons, the quantized vibrational modes of a crystal lattice, are ubiquitous quasiparticles in solid-state systems. They play a central role in a wide range of physical phenomena, from thermal transport, as primary carriers of heat in insulators, to their involvement in symmetry-breaking orders such as charge density waves and superconductivity. Traditionally considered as spinless bosons, phonons have recently emerged as a fertile ground for exploring topological physics, spurred by the rapid development of topological band theory initially formulated for fermionic systems. It is now understood that the phonon eigenstates, characterized by their eigenvalues and eigenvectors, can carry nontrivial topological invariants such as Berry curvature and Chern numbers, despite the absence of spin or charge. This new understanding opens up avenues to investigate the interplay between lattice dynamics, topology, and chirality in bosonic systems. In this article, we provide a comprehensive review of recent theoretical and experimental advances in the field of topological and chiral phonons. We begin by introducing the foundational concepts, including the classification of phononic band structures, symmetry-protected topological phases, and the definition of topological invariants in bosonic systems. Special attention is given to the concept of phonon angular momentum and its fundametal connection to Weyl phonons in inversion-symmetry-breaking systems. We then discuss key experimental realizations of topological and chiral phonons across a variety of material platforms. Finally, we outline outstanding challenges and promising directions for future research, such as the role of topology in phonon-mediated quasiparticle interactions and the manipulation of phonon angular momentum in quantum technologies.

Abstract: We have built an integrated computational platform for material properties at extreme conditions, ProME (Professional Materials at Extremes) v1.0, which enables integrated calculations for multicomponent alloys, covering high temperatures up to tens of thousands of Kelvin, high pressures up to millions of atmospheres, and high strain rates up to millions per second. A series of software packages have been developed and integrated into ProME v1.0, including ABC (AI-Based Crystal search) for crystal structure search under pressure, SAE (Similar Atomic Environment) for disordered configuration modeling, MFP$^2$ (Multiphase Fast Previewer by Mean-Field Potential) for multiphase thermodynamic properties, HTEM (High-throughput Toolkit for Elasticity Modeling) for thermo-elastic properties, TREX (TRansport at Extremes) for electrical and thermal conductivity, Hippos (High plastic phase model software) for phase-field simulation of microstructure evolution under high strain rates, and AutoCalphad for modeling and optimization of phase diagrams with variable compositions. ProME v1.0 has been applied to design the composition of the quaternary alloys Platinum-Iridium-Aluminum-Chromium (Pt-Ir-Al-Cr) for engine nozzles of aerospace attitude-orbit control, achieving high-temperature strength comparable to the currently used Pt-Ir alloys but with significantly reduced costs for raw materials. ProME offers crucial support for advancing both fundamental scientific understanding and industrial innovation in materials research and development.

Title: Guerra interpolation for inverse freezing
Authors: Linda Albanese, Adriano Barra, Emilio N. M. Cirillo
Abstract: In these short notes, we adapt and systematically apply Guerra's interpolation techniques on a class of disordered mean-field spin glasses equipped with crystal fields and multi-value spin variables. These models undergo the phenomenon of inverse melting or inverse freezing. In particular, we focus on the Ghatak-Sherrington model, its extension provided by Katayama and Horiguchi, and the disordered Blume-Emery-Griffiths-Capel model in the mean-field limit, deepened by Crisanti and Leuzzi and by Schupper and Shnerb. Once shown how all these models can be retrieved as particular limits of a unique broader Hamiltonian, we study their free energies. We provide explicit expressions of their annealed and quenched expectations, inspecting the cases of replica symmetry and (first-step) broken replica symmetry. We recover several results previously obtained via heuristic approaches (mainly the replica trick) to prove full agreement with the existing literature. As a sideline, we also inspect the onset of replica symmetry breaking by providing analytically the expression of the de Almeida-Thouless instability line for a replica symmetric description: in this general setting, the latter is new also from a physical viewpoint.

Title: Counting observables in stochastic excursions
Authors: Guilherme Fiusa, Pedro E. Harunari, Abhaya S. Hegde, Gabriel T. Landi
Abstract: Understanding fluctuations of observables across stochastic trajectories is essential for various fields of research, from quantum thermal machines to biological motors. We introduce the notion of stochastic excursions as a framework to analyze sub-trajectories of processes far from equilibrium. Given a partition of state space in two phases, labeled active and inactive, an excursion starts with a transition into the active phase and ends upon returning to inactivity. By incorporating counting variables, our approach captures finite-time fluctuations and trajectory-level behavior, providing insights on thermodynamic trade-offs between energy expenditure, entropy production and dynamical activity. As our main result, we uncover a fundamental relation between fluctuations of counting observables at the single-excursion level and the steady state noise obtained from full counting statistics. We also show the existence of an exchange-type fluctuation theorem at the level of individual excursions. As an application, we explore how analyzing excursions yields additional insights into the operation of the three-qubit absorption refrigerator.

Title: Anomalous spin dynamics after dual optical excitation
Authors: Sergii Parchenko, Peter M. Oppeneer, Andreas Scherz
Abstract: Ultrashort optical pulses are a cornerstone for manipulating electronic and magnetic states in materials on a femtosecond timescale. Conventional models assume that optical excitation primarily modifies the occupation of the electron energy levels without long-lasting altering of the coupling of individual electrons in certain processes. Here, we demonstrate that optical excitation with two femtosecond pulses that come from different directions fundamentally transforms the electron dynamics in copper, affecting the efficiency of angular momentum transfer between electrons and the lattice. Using time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect measurements, we reveal a ~2.5. increase in spin imbalance decay time following inverse Faraday effect excitation under dual-pump conditions compared to single-pulse excitation. This observation challenges the prevailing paradigm of ultrafast light-matter interactions, showing that dual optical excitation can transiently modify electron dynamics beyond simple changes in the energy levels occupancy. Our findings open new avenues for controlling quantum states through a dual pump approach, with implications for ultrafast spintronics and the design of novel light-driven states.

Title: A critical note on the sideband peak count-index technique: failure for nonlinear damage characterization of impacted CFRP plates
Authors: Bernd Köhler, Frank Schubert
Abstract: It is widely accepted, that nonlinear elastodynamic methods are superior to linear methods in detecting early stages of material deterioration. A number of recently developed methods are reported to be particularly sensitive to nonlinearities and thus appropriate to indicate early damage. We applied systematically one of the methods, the sideband peak count index (SPC-I), to a series of increasingly damaged carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) plates. Our data leads to different conclusions. The SPC-I values are influenced by (usually undocumented) variations in the index calculation procedure, which is not acceptable for a robust method. Moreover, the behavior of the index when the ultrasound amplitude is varied contradicts material nonlinearity as a direct and significant contributor to the index value. To clarify the apparent contradiction of our results with the previously published statements, it is recommended that (a) our data are re-evaluated by independent researchers and (b) the experiments already published are repeated or (if sufficient data is available) also re-evaluated.

Title: Fractional Statistics and Electron Transfer at Topological Defects
Authors: Eric R. Bittner
Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework for electron transfer (ET) at graphene defects, treating the surface as a Dirac cone with a localized defect state coupled to a vibrational environment. Using a polaron transformation combined with a modified density of states, we derive an explicit expression for the ET rate that incorporates both vibrational reorganization and fractionalized quasiparticle statistics. We show that fractional statistics, modeled through a power-law density of states, suppress low-energy ET near resonance and introduce tunable deviations from conventional Marcus-like kinetics. Our results suggest that strain, defect engineering, or chemical modification could stabilize fractional excitations in graphene-based catalysts, offering new strategies for controlling surface reactivity. These findings provide a foundation for future experimental and computational investigations into the role of topology and fractional statistics in chemical electron transfer.

Title: Non-purely transverse Magnus force in superconducting neutron stars
Authors: Oleg A. Goglichidze, Mikhail E. Gusakov
Abstract: The force acting on a proton vortex in extreme type-II superconducting neutron star matter is studied in the limit of vanishing temperature. A detailed analysis is presented on how momentum is transferred from length scales on the order of the London penetration depth to the vortex core. To examine the momentum flux, expressions for proton and electron currents are derived for arbitrary distances from the vortex line. It is shown that, in the regime of a large electron mean free path, the only force acting directly on the vortex core is the Magnus force. Notably, the correction to the proton current near the vortex core generates a component of the Magnus force aligned with the incident current measured far from the vortex. This contribution, responsible for longitudinal force, is usually overlooked in the literature. The results obtained in this work for a relatively simple problem concerning the force on a vortex in cold matter of neutron stars may also be relevant to other superconducting systems.

Title: Design of a molecular Field Effect Transistor (mFET)
Authors: Ralph C. Merkle, Robert A. Freitas Jr., Damian G. Allis
Abstract: Field Effect Transistors (FETs) are ubiquitous in electronics. As we scale FETs to ever smaller sizes, it becomes natural to ask how small a practical FET might be. We propose and analyze an atomically precise molecular FET (herein referred to as an "mFET") with 7,694 atoms made only of hydrogen and carbon atoms. It uses metallic (4,4) carbon nanotubes as the conductive leads, a linear segment of Lonsdaleite (hexagonal diamond) as the channel, Lonsdaleite as the insulating layer between the channel and the gate, and a (20,20) metallic carbon nanotube as the surrounding gate. The (4,4) nanotube leads are bonded to the channel using a mix of 5- and 6-membered rings, and to the gate using 5-, 6- and 7-membered rings. Issues of component design assessment and optimization using quantum chemical methods are discussed throughout. A 10 watt sugar-cube-sized computer made with $10^{18}$ such mFETs could deliver $\sim 10^{25}$ switching operations per second.

Title: Self-reorganization and Information Transfer in Massive Schools of Fish
Authors: Haotian Hang, Chenchen Huang, Alex Barnett, Eva Kanso
Abstract: The remarkable cohesion and coordination observed in moving animal groups and their collective responsiveness to threats are thought to be mediated by scale-free correlations, where changes in the behavior of one animal influence others in the group, regardless of the distance between them. But are these features independent of group size? Here, we investigate group cohesiveness and collective responsiveness in computational models of massive schools of fish of up to 50,000 individuals. We show that as the number of swimmers increases, flow interactions destabilize the school, creating clusters that constantly fragment, disperse, and regroup, similar to their biological counterparts. We calculate the spatial correlation and speed of information propagation in these dynamic clusters. Spatial correlations in cohesive and polarized clusters are indeed scale free, much like in natural animal groups, but fragmentation events are preceded by a decrease in correlation length, thus diminishing the group's collective responsiveness, leaving it more vulnerable to predation events. Importantly, in groups undergoing collective turns, the information about the change in direction propagates linearly in time among group members, thanks to the non-reciprocal nature of the visual interactions between individuals. Merging speeds up the transfer of information within each cluster by several fold, while fragmentation slows it down. Our findings suggest that flow interactions may have played an important role in group size regulation, behavioral adaptations, and dispersion in living animal groups.

Title: Quantitative calibration of a TWPA applied to an optomechanical platform

Abstract: In the last decade, the microwave quantum electronics toolbox has been enriched with quantum limited detection devices such as Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifiers (TWPAs). The extreme sensitivity they provide is not only mandatory for some physics applications within quantum information processing, but is also the key element that will determine the detection limit of quantum sensing setups. In the framework of microwave optomechanical systems, an unprecedented range of small motions and forces is accessible, for which a specific quantitative calibration becomes necessary. We report on near quantum-limited measurements performed with an aluminum drumhead mechanical device within the temperature range 4 mK - 400 mK. The whole setup is carefully calibrated, especially taking into account the power-dependence of microwave absorption in the superconducting optomechanical cavity. This effect is commonly attributed to Two-Level-Systems (TLSs) present in the metal oxide. We demonstrate that a similar feature exists in the TWPA, and can be phenomenologically fit with adapted expressions. The power and temperature dependence is studied over the full parameter range, leading to an absolute definition of phonon population (i.e. Brownian motion amplitude), with an uncertainty +-20 %.

Title: TTNOpt: Tree tensor network package for high-rank tensor compression
Authors: Ryo Watanabe, Hidetaka Manabe, Toshiya Hikihara, Hiroshi Ueda
Abstract: We have developed TTNOpt, a software package that utilizes tree tensor networks (TTNs) for quantum spin systems and high-dimensional data analysis. TTNOpt provides efficient and powerful TTN computations by locally optimizing the network structure, guided by the entanglement pattern of the target tensors. For quantum spin systems, TTNOpt searches for the ground state of Hamiltonians with bilinear spin interactions and magnetic fields, and computes physical properties of these states, including the variational energy, bipartite entanglement entropy (EE), single-site expectation values, and two-site correlation functions. Additionally, TTNOpt can target the lowest-energy state within a specified subspace, provided that the Hamiltonian conserves total magnetization. For high-dimensional data analysis, TTNOpt factorizes complex tensors into TTN states that maximize fidelity to the original tensors by optimizing the tensors and the network. When a TTN is provided as input, TTNOpt reconstructs the network based on the EE without referencing the fidelity of the original state. We present three demonstrations of TTNOpt: (1) Ground-state search for the hierarchical chain model with a system size of $256$. The entanglement patterns of the ground state manifest themselves in a tree structure, and TTNOpt successfully identifies the tree. (2) Factorization of a quantic tensor of the $2^{24}$ dimensions representing a three-variable function where each variant has a weak bit-wise correlation. The optimized TTN shows that its structure isolates the variables from each other. (3) Reconstruction of the matrix product network representing a $16$-variable normal distribution characterized by a tree-like correlation structure. TTNOpt can reveal hidden correlation structures of the covariance matrix.

Title: Indirect Influence on Network Diffusion
Authors: Lluís Torres-Hugas, Jordi Duch, Sergio Gómez
Abstract: Models of network diffusion typically rely on the Laplacian matrix, capturing interactions via direct connections. Beyond direct interactions, information in many systems can also flow via indirect pathways, where influence typically diminishes over distance. In this work, we analyze diffusion dynamics incorporating such indirect connections using the $d$-path Laplacian framework. We introduce a parameter, the indirect influence, based on the change in the second smallest eigenvalue of the generalized path Laplacian, to quantify the impact of these pathways on diffusion timescales relative to direct-only models. Using perturbation theory and mean-field approximations, we derive analytical expressions for the indirect influence in terms of structural properties of random networks. Theoretical predictions align well with numerical simulations, providing a phase diagram for when indirect influence becomes significant. We also identify a structural phase transition governed by the emergence of $d$-paths and derive the critical connection probability above which they dramatically alter diffusion. This study provides a quantitative understanding of how indirect pathways shape network dynamics and reveals their collective structural onset.

Title: Observation of Perfect Absorption in Hyperfine Levels of Molecular Spins with Hermitian Subspaces
Authors: Claudio Bonizzoni, Daniele Lamberto, Samuel Napoli, Simon Gunzler, Dennis Rieger, Fabio Santanni, Alberto Ghirri, Wolfgang Wernsdorfer, Salvatore Savasta, Marco Affronte
Abstract: Ideal effective parity-time (PT)-symmetry can be achieved in a passive open system by accurately balancing feeding and absorption processes. Such PT-symmetric systems display Hermitian subspaces which enable perfect absorption (PA) of radiation, i.e., all the incoming energy is absorbed by the system. In this work, we consider a passive open quantum system obtained by coupling molecular spin centers to a planar microwave resonator operating at milliKelvin temperatures and at few-photon power level. We experimentally demonstrate that Hermitian subspaces and thus PA can be implemented even in the absence of PT-symmetry, by exploiting the spin detuning to control the photon and spin content of a polariton mode. In such a way, the required balance between the feeding and the loss rates is effectively recovered. We show that Hermitian subspaces influence the overall aspect of coherent spectra of cavity QED systems and significantly enlarge the possibility to explore non-Hermitian effects in open quantum systems. We finally discuss how Hermitian subspaces can be potentially exploited for the development of efficient switches and modulators with high modulation depths over a broad spectral range.

Title: How Salt Solvation Slows Water Dynamics While Blue-Shifting Its Dielectric Spectrum
Authors: Florian Pabst, Stefano Baroni
Abstract: Water inherently contains trace amounts of various salts, yet the microscopic processes by which salts influence some of its physical properties remain elusive. Notably, the mechanisms that reduce the dielectric constant of water upon salt addition are still debated. The primary absorption peak for electromagnetic radiation -- commonly used in microwave heating -- shifts towards higher frequencies in saline solutions, suggesting faster water molecular dynamics. This observation, however, contrasts with the simultaneous increase in viscosity and experimental reports that ionic solutes would slow down water molecular motion. In this work, we use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with deep-neural-network models trained on high-quality quantum mechanical data to mimic interatomic forces and molecular dipoles, to compute the dielectric spectra of perchlorate water saline solution, which may be relevant to the recent discovery of liquid water beneath the thick ice crust at Mars's south pole. Our results reveal that both the reduction in the dielectric constant and the absorption peak shift can be attributed to ion-induced changes in the orientational ordering of water molecules. Additionally, we demonstrate that the self-part of the molecular dipole-dipole correlation function reveals clear signatures of the slowing dynamics within the first cationic solvation shell, consistent with the experimentally observed increase in viscosity.

Title: Narrowband, angle-stable, and highly efficient polariton organic light emitting diodes employing thermally activated delayed fluorescence
Authors: Andreas Mischok, Simon Lennartz, Vanessa Gruber, Francisco Tenopala-Carmona, Julia Witt, Sabina Hillebrandt, Malte C. Gather
Abstract: Narrowband emission is crucial for next generation optoelectronic devices to satisfy demands for high color brilliance. Microcavities can narrow emission spectra of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) through the creation of resonant standing waves, independent of emitter material, enabling flexibility in molecular and device design. However, they induce a strong angle-dependence of the perceived emission color. Utilizing strong light-matter coupling of cavity photons with the virtually angle-independent exciton, leads to exciton-polariton emission showing reduced linewidths and suppressed angular dispersion if tuned correctly. Creating polaritons in highly efficient materials such as thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules is however difficult as their low oscillator strengths intrinsically disfavor light-matter interaction. Here, we present the successful combination of a highly efficient but intrinsically broadband TADF emitter with a strongly absorbing assistant strong coupling material in a modified microcavity structure. Through optimizing the assistant strong coupling layer architecture, we demonstrate polariton OLEDs with exceptionally narrowband, angle stable emission at external quantum efficiencies above 20% for both bottom- and top-emitting designs, more than doubling the performance of previous record devices. The results pave the way for utilizing polaritonic emission at practical device efficiencies for display applications.

Title: Non-degenerate pumping of superconducting resonator parametric amplifier with evidence of phase-sensitive amplification
Authors: Songyuan Zhao, Stafford Withington, Christopher Thomas
Abstract: Superconducting resonator parametric amplifiers are potentially important components for a wide variety of fundamental physics experiments and utilitarian applications. We propose and realise an operation scheme that achieves amplification through the use of non-degenerate pumps, which addresses two key challenges in the design of parametric amplifiers: non-continuous gain across the band over which amplification is possible, and pump-tone removal. We have experimentally demonstrated the non-degenerate pumping scheme using a half-wave resonator amplifier based on NbN thin-film, and measured peak gain of 26 dB and 3-dB bandwidth of 0.5 MHz. The two non-degenerate pump tones were positioned ~10 bandwidths above and below the frequency at which peak gain occurs. We have found the non-degenerate pumping scheme to be more stable compared to the usual degenerate pumping scheme in terms of gain drift against time, by a factor of 4. This scheme also retains the usual flexibility of NbN resonator parametric amplifiers in terms of reliable amplification in a ~4 K environment, and is suitable for cross-harmonic amplification. The use of pump at different frequencies allows phase-sensitive amplification when the signal tone is degenerate with the idler tone. A gain of 23 dB and squeezing ratio of 6 dB have been measured.

Title: Representation of tensor functions using low-order structural tensor set: two-dimensional point group
Authors: Mohammad Madadi, Lin Cheng, Pu Zhang
Abstract: The representation theory of tensor functions is essential to constitutive modeling of materials including both mechanical and physical behaviors. Generally, material symmetry is incorporated in the tensor functions through a structural or anisotropic tensor that characterizes the corresponding point group. The general mathematical framework was well-established in the 1990s. Nevertheless, the traditional theory suffers from a grand challenge that many point groups involve fourth or sixth order structural tensors that hinder its practical applications in engineering. Recently, researchers have reformulated the representation theory and opened up opportunities to model anisotropic materials using low-order (i.e., 2nd-order and lower) structural tensors only, although the theory was not fully established. This work aims to fully establish the reformulated representation theory of tensor functions for all two-dimensional point groups. It was found that each point group needs a structural tensor set to characterize the symmetry. For each two-dimensional point group, the structural tensor set is proposed and the general tensor functions are derived. Only low-order structural tensors are introduced so researchers can readily apply these tensor functions for their modeling applications. The theory presented here is useful for constitutive modeling of materials in general, especially for composites, nanomaterials, soft tissues, etc.

Title: Optimal statistical ensembles for quantum thermal state preparation within the quantum singular value transformation framework
Authors: Yasushi Yoneta
Abstract: Preparing thermal equilibrium states is an essential task for finite-temperature quantum simulations. In statistical mechanics, microstates in thermal equilibrium can be obtained from statistical ensembles. To date, a variety of ensembles have been devised, including not only the Gibbs ensembles, such as the canonical and microcanonical ensembles, but also various generalized ensembles. Since these ensembles yield equivalent thermodynamic predictions, one can freely choose an ensemble for computational convenience. In this paper, we exploit this flexibility to develop an efficient quantum algorithm for preparing thermal equilibrium states. We first present a quantum algorithm for implementing generalized ensembles within the framework of quantum singular value transformation. We then perform a detailed analysis of the computational cost and elucidate its dependence on the choice of the ensemble. We show that selecting an appropriate ensemble can significantly mitigate ensemble-dependent overhead and yield improved scaling of the computational cost with system size compared to existing methods based on the canonical ensemble. Moreover, we numerically demonstrate that our approach achieves a significant reduction in the computational cost even for finite-size systems. Our algorithm applies to arbitrary thermodynamic systems at any temperature and is thus expected to offer a practical and versatile method for computing finite-temperature properties of quantum many-body systems. These results highlight the potential of ensemble design as a powerful tool for enhancing the efficiency of a broad class of quantum algorithms.

Title: Boundary critical behavior of the three-dimensional Heisenberg universality class
Authors: Francesco Parisen Toldin
Abstract: We study the boundary critical behavior of the three-dimensional Heisenberg universality class, in the presence of a bidimensional surface. By means of high-precision Monte Carlo simulations of an improved lattice model, where leading bulk scaling corrections are suppressed, we prove the existence of a special phase transition, with unusual exponents, and of an extraordinary phase with logarithmically decaying correlations. These findings contrast with naïve arguments on the bulk-surface phase diagram, and allow us to explain some recent puzzling results on the boundary critical behavior of quantum spin models.

Title: Local Non-Hermitian Hamiltonian Formalism for Dissipative Fermionic Systems and Loss-Induced Population Increase in Fermi Superfluids
Authors: Teng Xiao, Gentaro Watanabe
Abstract: We examine a standard scheme to obtain the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian (NHH) from the Lindblad master equation by neglecting its jump term, and propose an alternative approach to address the limitations of the former. It is shown that the NHH obtained by the conventional scheme fails to provide a good approximation for fermionic many-body systems, even on short timescales. To resolve this issue, we present a framework called the local NHH formalism, which describes the loss process in each individual mode locally. This formalism is applicable to general dissipative fermionic systems and remains consistent with the underlying Lindblad master equation at the level of the equations of motion of local observables. The local NHH formalism also provides a convenient framework for studying non-Hermitian physics in dissipative fermionic systems, especially for spectral analysis, compared to the Lindblad master equation. As an illustration, we consider a fermionic superfluid subjected to one-body loss and find the population increase induced by the loss, resulting from the locking of the relative phase between the pairing gap and the anomalous field. The conventional NHH fails to capture these unique phenomena.

Title: High-chirality and multiquaternion Weyl nodes in hexagonal ReO$_3$
Authors: Siyu Chen, Robert-Jan Slager, Bartomeu Monserrat, Adrien Bouhon
Abstract: The formation of two-band nodal points in gapless topological phases, referred to as conventional Weyl nodes, relies solely on translational symmetry. However, when coupled with other spatial and spatio-temporal symmetries, unconventional Weyl nodes with high degeneracy, pronounced chirality, and complementary quaternion charges can manifest. In this work, we identify ReO3 as an ideal unconventional Weyl semimetal in which rotation and screw symmetries as well as their combination with time-reversal symmetry play a crucial role. To show this, we first revisit in detail the algebraic determination of the chirality of Weyl nodes from the spinful irreducible representations of the occupied and unoccupied bands, and then combine it with the complementary C2T-symmetry-protected patch Euler class and non-Abelian frame charges that indicates the pinning of the Weyl nodes on C2T-invariant planes. Supporting our findings with first-principles calculations, we furthermore reveal very clear Fermi arc signatures of the high-chirality Weyl nodes at the Fermi level for different surface orientations. We finally investigate the effect of strain upon which the robustness of Weyl nodes clearly demonstrates their Chern (i.e. chirality conservation) and quaternionic (i.e. symmetry-plane pinning) topological nature.

Title: Human Perception-Inspired Grain Segmentation Refinement Using Conditional Random Fields
Authors: Doruk Aksoy, Huolin L. Xin, Timothy J. Rupert, William J. Bowman
Abstract: Automated detection of grain boundaries in electron microscope images of polycrystalline materials could help accelerate the nanoscale characterization of myriad engineering materials and novel materials under scientific research. Accurate segmentation of interconnected line networks, such as grain boundaries in polycrystalline material microstructures, poses a significant challenge due to the fragmented masks produced by conventional computer vision algorithms, including convolutional neural networks. These algorithms struggle with thin masks, often necessitating post-processing for effective contour closure and continuity. Previous approaches in this domain have typically relied on custom post-processing techniques that are problem-specific and heavily dependent on the quality of the mask obtained from a computer vision algorithm. Addressing this issue, this paper introduces a fast, high-fidelity post-processing technique that is universally applicable to segmentation masks of interconnected line networks. Leveraging domain knowledge about grain boundary connectivity, this method employs conditional random fields and perceptual grouping rules to refine segmentation masks of any image with a discernible grain structure. This approach significantly enhances segmentation mask accuracy, achieving a 79% segment identification accuracy in validation with a U-Net model on electron microscopy images of a polycrystalline oxide. Additionally, a novel grain alignment metric is introduced, showing a 51% improvement in grain alignment. This method not only enables rapid and accurate segmentation but also facilitates an unprecedented level of data analysis, significantly improving the statistical representation of grain boundary networks, making it suitable for a range of disciplines where precise segmentation of interconnected line networks is essential.

Title: Transition from topological to chaos in the nonlinear Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model
Authors: Kazuki Sone, Motohiko Ezawa, Zongping Gong, Taro Sawada, Nobuyuki Yoshioka, Takahiro Sagawa
Abstract: Recent studies on topological materials are expanding into the nonlinear regime, while the central principle, namely the bulk-edge correspondence, is yet to be elucidated in the strongly nonlinear regime. Here, we reveal that nonlinear topological edge modes can exhibit the transition to spatial chaos by increasing nonlinearity, which can be a universal mechanism of the breakdown of the bulk-edge correspondence. Specifically, we unveil the underlying dynamical system describing the spatial distribution of zero modes and show the emergence of chaos. We also propose the correspondence between the absolute value of the topological invariant and the dimension of the stable manifold under sufficiently weak nonlinearity. Our results provide a general guiding principle to investigate the nonlinear bulk-edge correspondence that can potentially be extended to arbitrary dimensions.

Title: Spectral analysis of the magneto-optical response in valley polarized Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$Se
Authors: Xiaoqi Ding, Jiashu Wang, Mykhaylo Ozerov, Sara Bey, Muhsin Abdul Karim, Seul-Ki Bac, Xinyu Liu, Badih A. Assaf, Yi-Ting Hsu, Xiao Li
Abstract: Since the last century, considerable efforts have been devoted to the study of valley-degenerate narrow gap semiconductors, such as the Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$Se alloy. This material possesses band edges at the $L$-points of their Brillouin zone, yielding a valley degeneracy of four. However, in (111)-oriented films, it is still not fully understood how differences between the longitudinal valley, oriented along the growth axis, and the oblique valleys, oriented at an angle with respect to that axis, appear in infrared magneto-optical spectroscopy. In this work, we report a magneto-optical study on this family of alloys, focusing on an anomaly in the interband transition of the absorption strength ratio between longitudinal and oblique valleys under a magnetic field applied along the [111] direction. Based on the Mitchell-Wallis model, we provide a theoretical fit for the experimental transmission data, which quantitatively explains the spectral shape of the data at magnetic fields as high as 35T. In particular, we attribute this anomalous absorption strength variation to the carrier density difference between the two types of valleys as well as the field-dependent multiple-beam interference or the Fabry-Pérot interference. Our analysis also allows for the extraction of the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function.

Title: Speed-accuracy relations for diffusion models: Wisdom from nonequilibrium thermodynamics and optimal transport
Authors: Kotaro Ikeda, Tomoya Uda, Daisuke Okanohara, Sosuke Ito
Abstract: We discuss a connection between a generative model, called the diffusion model, and nonequilibrium thermodynamics for the Fokker-Planck equation, called stochastic thermodynamics. Using techniques from stochastic thermodynamics, we derive the speed-accuracy relations for diffusion models, which are inequalities that relate the accuracy of data generation to the entropy production rate. This relation can be interpreted as the speed of the diffusion dynamics in the absence of the non-conservative force. From a stochastic thermodynamic perspective, our results provide quantitative insight into how best to generate data in diffusion models. The optimal learning protocol is introduced by the geodesic of space of the 2-Wasserstein distance in optimal transport theory. We numerically illustrate the validity of the speed-accuracy relations for diffusion models with different noise schedules and different data. We numerically discuss our results for optimal and suboptimal learning protocols. We also demonstrate the applicability of our results to data generation from the real-world image datasets.

Title: Unsupervised machine learning for detecting mutual independence among eigenstate regimes in interacting quasiperiodic chains
Authors: Colin Beveridge, Kathleen Hart, Cassio Rodrigo Cristani, Xiao Li, Enrico Barbierato, Yi-Ting Hsu
Abstract: Many-body eigenstates that are neither thermal nor many-body-localized (MBL) were numerically found in certain interacting chains with moderate quasiperiodic potentials. The energy regime consisting of these non-ergodic but extended (NEE) eigenstates has been extensively studied for being a possible many-body mobility edge between the energy-resolved MBL and thermal phases. Recently, the NEE regime was further proposed to be a prethermal phenomenon that generally occurs when different operators spread at sizably different timescales. Here, we numerically examine the mutual independence among the NEE, MBL, and thermal regimes in the lens of eigenstate entanglement spectra (ES). Given the complexity and rich information embedded in ES, we develop an unsupervised learning approach that is designed to quantify the mutual independence among general phases. Our method is first demonstrated on an illustrative toy example that uses RGB color data to represent phases, then applied to the ES of an interacting generalized Aubry Andre model from weak to strong potential strength. We find that while the MBL and thermal regimes are mutually independent, the NEE regime is dependent on the former two and smoothly appears as the potential strength decreases. We attribute our numerically finding to the fact that the ES data in the NEE regime exhibits both an MBL-like fast decay and a thermal-like long tail.

Title: Scattering theory of thermal and bipolar thermoelectric diodes
Authors: José Balduque, Rafael Sánchez
Abstract: We investigate the minimal requirements that induce a nonreciprocal response to temperature differences in a mesoscopic electronic conductor. We identify two distinct mechanisms involved in electron-electron interactions, namely inelastic scattering and screening, that locally affect the internal properties of the device, leading to thermal and thermoelectric rectification effects in the absence of inversion symmetry. We propose resonant tunneling samples to efficiently exploit these effects, and find configurations acting as bipolar thermoelectric diodes whose current flows in the same direction irrespective of the sign of the temperature difference, a case of antireciprocity.

Title: Locomotion of Active Polymerlike Worms in Porous Media
Authors: Rosa Sinaasappel, Mohammad Fazelzadeh, Twan Hooijschuur, Qingyi Di, Sara Jabbari-Farouji, Antoine Deblais
Abstract: We investigate the locomotion of thin, living T. tubifex worms, which display active polymerlike behavior, within quasi-2D arrays of cylindrical pillars, examining varying spatial arrangements and densities. These active worms spread in crowded environments, with a dynamics dependent on both the concentration and arrangement of obstacles. In contrast to passive polymers, our results reveal that in disordered configurations, increasing the pillar density enhances the long-time diffusion of our active polymer-like worms, while we observe the opposite trend in ordered pillar arrays. We found that in disordered media, living worms reptate through available curvilinear tubes, whereas they become trapped within pores of ordered media. Intriguingly, we show that reducing the worm's activity significantly boosts its spread, enabling passive sorting of worms by activity level. Our experimental observations are corroborated through simulations of the tangentially driven polymer model with matched persistence length predicting the same trends.

Title: Witnessing Disorder in Quantum Magnets
Authors: Snigdh Sabharwal, Tokuro Shimokawa, Nic Shannon
Abstract: There are no clean samples in nature. Therefore, when we come to discuss the entanglement properties of quantum materials, the effects of disorder must be taken into account. This question is of particular interest for high-entangled phases, such as quantum spin liquids, which lie outside the Landau paradigm for classifying phases of matter. In this work, we explore what experimentally-accessible measures, in the form of concurrence, residual tangle and quantum Fisher information, can teach us about the entanglement in the presence of disorder. As a representative example, we consider the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids (TLL) and disorder-driven random singlet (RS) phases found in antiferromagnetic quantum spin chains. Using quantum Fisher information and residual tangle, we demonstrate that both TLL and RS phases exhibit multi-partite entanglement. In the case of the RS phase, we attribute this to entanglement localized below a crossover length scale. We further show that the order of disorder average matters in calculating measures like concurrence, and that this can lead to false inferences when interpreting experiment. Nonetheless, correctly interpreted, these witnesses provide useful information about the effects of disorder. We explore how information about the central charge of the TLL can be extracted from the low-temperature behavior of concurrence, and conjecture that this analysis can be extended to the effective central charge of the RS phase. Finally, we establish how RS and TLL phases can be distinguished through the growth of multi-partite entanglement, as witnessed by the equal-time structure factor. These results establish that, used carefully, experiments based on entanglement witnesses can provide important information about quantum spin systems in the presence of disorder.

Title: Anomalous Doppler effect in superfluid and supersolid atomic gases
Authors: Tomasz Zawiślak, Marija Šindik, Sandro Stringari, Alessio Recati
Abstract: By employing the formalism of hydrodynamics, we derive novel analytic predictions for the Doppler effect in superfluids with broken Galilean invariance and hosting persistent currents at zero temperature. We consider two scenarios: when Galilean invariance is broken explicitly (by external potentials) and spontaneously, as it happens in a supersolid. In the former case, the presence of a stationary current affects the propagation of sound via an anomalous Doppler term proportional to the density derivative of the superfluid fraction. In supersolids, where, according to Goldstone theorem, distinct sounds of hybrid superfluid and crystal nature can propagate, the Doppler effect can be very different for each sound. Quantitative estimates of the Doppler shifts are obtained for Bose-Einstein condensed atomic gases, described by Gross-Pitaevskii theory. The estimates are obtained both calculating the thermodynamic parameters entering the hydrodynamic results, and from full time-dependent simulations.

Title: Radiative Higgs mode in photoinduced $η$ pairs
Authors: Satoshi Ejima, Benedikt Fauseweh
Abstract: We demonstrate that the $\eta$ symmetry of the pump-induced $\eta$-pairing state in the Hubbard chain can be transiently broken by an additionally applied probe pulse. This leads to characteristic dynamic Higgs oscillations of the $\eta$-pair correlations during the probe pulse and a sharp dynamic negative optical conductivity $\sigma(\omega;t)$, which appears above the equilibrium Mott gap $\omega>\Delta_{\rm c}$, long after the pump pulse is finished. This negative peak in the real part of $\sigma(\omega;t)$ is a distinctive hallmark of the photoinduced $\eta$-pairing state, distinguishing it from phases dominated by incoherent doublon formation, which do not exhibit this feature. Remarkably the broadband probe pulse then leads to the emission of photons with the Higgs frequency.

Title: Josephson effect and self-trapping in helicoidal spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates with optical lattices
Authors: Sumaita Sultana, Golam Ali Sekh
Abstract: We consider matter-wave bright solitons in helicoidal spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates in optical lattices with a view to study Josephson-type oscillation and self-trapping of population imbalance between two pseudo-spin states. For fixed values of nonlinear interaction and lattice parameters, the population imbalance executes Josephson-type oscillation and the frequency of oscillation decreases with the increase of helicoidal gauge potential. The frequency of oscillation, however, increases in presence of nonlinear optical lattices. We find that the population imbalance can oscillate about a non-zero value and result self-trapping for proper choices of parameters of the system. The self-trapping can be enhanced by the increase of helicoidal gauge potential and by properly tuning the lattice parameters.

Title: Moving skyrmions in Antiferromagnets by Sublattice Displacements
Authors: Michael Lau, Wolfgang Häusler, Michael Thorwart
Abstract: The texture in antiferromagnets hosting a topologically protected skyrmion can be viewed as two effectively coupled ferromagnetic skyrmions. Assuming rigid magnetic configurations, we show that this coupling results in an effective mass of the antiferromagnetic skyrmion and that its dynamics can be viewed as due to a relative displacement of the two sublattice ferromagnetic skyrmions. The theory holds for different antiferromagnetic systems and includes effects from dissipation and external forces caused by electric currents. We verify our analytical results by micromagnetic simulations.

Title: Oxide Membranes from Bulk Micro-Machining of SrTiO$_3$ substrates
Authors: Nicola Manca, Alejandro Enrique Plaza, Leonélio Cichetto Jr., Warner J. Venstra, Cristina Bernini, Daniele Marré, Luca Pellegrino
Abstract: Suspended micro-structures based on complex oxides relies on surface micro-machining processes such as those based on sacrificial layers. These processes prevent to physically access the microstructures from both sides, as substantial part of the substrate is not removed. In this work, we develop a bulk micromachining protocol of a commonly used substrate employed in oxide thin film deposition. We realize suspended oxide thin film devices by fabricating pass-through holes across SrTiO$_3$(100) or SrTiO$_3$(110) substrates. Careful calibration of anisotropic etching rates allows controlling the final geometry of the aperture in the substrate in a predictable way. As demonstrators of possible device geometries, we present clamped membranes and trampolines of (La,Sr)MnO$_3$, a conductive magnetic oxide, and a suspended trampoline resonator carved from the SrTiO$_3$ substrate itself. Reported protocols can be readily extended to a broad variety of other complex oxides so to extend the application of membranes technology beyond those of commercially-available silicon compounds.

Title: Collective dynamics of densely confined active polar disks with self- and mutual alignment
Authors: Weizhen Tang, Yating Zheng, Amir Shee, Guozheng Lin, Zhangang Han, Pawel Romanczuk, Cristián Huepe
Abstract: We study the emerging collective states in a simple mechanical model of a dense group of self-propelled polar disks with off-centered rotation, confined within a circular arena. Each disk presents self-alignment towards the sum of contact forces acting on it, resulting from disk-substrate interactions, while also displaying mutual alignment with neighbors due to having its center of rotation located a distance R behind its centroid so that central contact forces can also introduce torques. The effect of both alignment mechanisms produces a variety of collective states that combine high-frequency localized circular oscillations with low-frequency milling around the center of the arena, in fluid or solid regimes. We consider cases with small/large R values, isotropic/anisotropic disk-substrate damping, smooth/rough arena boundaries, different densities, and multiple systems sizes, showing that the emergent collective states that we identify are robust, generic, and potentially observable in real-world natural or artificial systems.

Title: Bayesian optimization based on element mapping to design high-capacity NASICON-type cathode in sodium-ion battery
Authors: Sanghyeon Park, Yoonsu Shim, Junpyo Hur, Dongmin Jeon, Jong Min Yuk, Chan-Woo Lee
Abstract: To discover novel materials with high performance, there have been many attempts to adopt Bayesian optimization (BO) to materials science, owing to its efficiency in navigating complex and high-dimensional design spaces. However, the application of BO to material design has been suffered from handling discrete input variables, such as elements. Here, we introduce a novel element mapping strategy that encodes elemental identities into chemically meaningful continuous values, enabling to create easy-to-predict chemical spaces. We apply this new framework to design high capacity Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF) cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries, targeting that shift all working voltages into the desired operational voltage window. The proposed framework successfully suggests 16 optimal element composition within 50 iterations. Our results demonstrate the way to overcome the limitation of categorical input that will likely broaden the applicability of BO to a wider range of material discoveries.

Title: Ensemble inequivalence and phase transitions in unlabeled networks
Authors: Oleg Evnin, Dmitri Krioukov
Abstract: We discover a first-order phase transition in the canonical ensemble of random unlabeled networks with a prescribed average number of links. The transition is caused by the nonconcavity of microcanonical entropy. Above the critical point coinciding with the graph symmetry phase transition, the canonical and microcanonical ensembles are equivalent and have a well-behaved thermodynamic limit. Below the critical point, the ensemble equivalence is broken, and the canonical ensemble is a mixture of phases: empty networks and networks with average degrees diverging logarithmically with the network size. As a consequence, networks with bounded average degrees do not survive in the thermodynamic limit, decaying into the empty phase. The celebrated percolation transition in labeled networks is thus absent in unlabeled networks. In view of these differences between labeled and unlabeled ensembles, the question of which one should be used as a null model of different real-world networks cannot be ignored.

Title: Tunneling Spectroscopy in Superconducting Circuit Lattices
Authors: Botao Du, Qihao Guo, Santiago López, Ruichao Ma
Abstract: We demonstrate tunneling spectroscopy of synthetic quantum matter in superconducting circuit lattices. We measure site-resolved excitation spectra by coupling the lattice to engineered driven-dissipative particle baths that serve as local tunneling probes. Using incoherent particle source and drain, we independently extract quasi-particle and quasi-hole spectra and reconstruct the spatial structure of collective excitations. We perform spectroscopy of a strongly interacting Bose-Hubbard lattice at different densities, observing changes in energy gaps across the superfluid to Mott-insulator transition and the effects of three-body interactions. Our results provide a new toolset for characterizing many-body states in analog quantum simulators.

Title: Energy shifts and broadening of excitonic resonances in electrostatically-doped semiconductors
Authors: Hanan Dery, Cedric Robert, Scott A. Crooker, Xavier Marie, Dinh Van Tuan
Abstract: Tuning the density of resident electrons or holes in semiconductors provides crucial insight into the composition of excitonic complexes that are observed as absorption or photoluminescence resonances in optical studies. Moreover, we can change the way these resonances shift and broaden in energy by controlling the quantum numbers of the resident carriers with magnetic fields and doping levels, and by selecting the quantum numbers of the photoexcited or recombining electron-hole (e-h) pair through optical polarization. We discuss the roles of distinguishability and optimality of excitonic complexes, showing them to be key ingredients that determine the energy shifts and broadening of optical resonances in charge-tunable semiconductors. A distinguishable e-h pair means that the electron and hole undergoing photoexcitation or recombination have quantum numbers that are not shared by any of the resident carriers. An optimal excitonic complex refers to a complex whose particles come with all available quantum numbers of the resident carriers. All optical resonances may be classified as either distinct or indistinct depending on the distinguishability of the e-h pair, and the underlying excitonic complex can be classified as either optimal or suboptimal. The universality of these classifications, inherited from the fundamental Pauli exclusion principle, allows us to understand how optical resonances shift in energy and whether they should broaden as doping is increased. This understanding is supported by conclusive evidence that the decay of optical resonances cannot be simply attributed to enhanced screening when resident carriers are added to a semiconductor. Finally, applying the classification scheme in either monolayer or moire heterobilayer systems, we relate the energy shift and amplitude of the neutral exciton resonance to the compressibility of the resident carrier gas.

Title: Anderson localization: A disorder-induced quantum bound state
Authors: Václav Janiš
Abstract: Electrons at the Fermi energy may lose their ability to propagate to long distances in certain random media. We use Green functions and solve parquet equations for the non-local electron-hole vertex in high spatial dimensions to describe the vanishing of diffusion in Anderson localization. It is caused by forming a quantum bound state between the diffusing particle and the hole left behind. Divergence in a new time scale proportional to the electrical polarizability signals the Anderson localization transition. Consequently, the height of the peak of the dynamical conductivity at zero frequency, the static diffusion constant, is not pushed to zero at the localization transition but rather its width. Spatially localized quantum bound states in the localized phase cannot be described by the continuity and wave equations in the Hilbert space of Bloch waves.

Title: Angle-Tuned Gross-Neveu Quantum Criticality in Twisted Bilayer Graphene: A Quantum Monte Carlo Study
Authors: Cheng Huang, Nikolaos Parthenios, Maksim Ulybyshev, Xu Zhang, Fakher F. Assaad, Laura Classen, Zi Yang Meng
Abstract: The fascinating quantum many-body states in twisted bilayber graphene (TBG) at magic angle, due to the interplay of Coulomb interactions and the quantum metrics of flat bands, have been well understood both experimentally and theoretically. However, the phase diagram and excitations as functions of twist angle and permittivity are still largely unknown. Here, via a newly developed momentum-space continuous-field quantum Monte Carlo method fully taking into account long-ranged Coulomb interactions and flat bands' quantum metrics with system sizes that were not accessible before, we show that charge-neutral TBG realizes an angle-tuned quantum phase transition from a gapped Kramers intervalley coherence (KIVC) state to a Dirac semimetal with critical angles around 1.2$°$. In single-particle spectra we demonstrate the evolution of a minimum gap at $\Gamma$ at the magic angle and towards touching points at Brillouin zone corners as the angle increases. The free energy and KIVC order parameter show that the transition belongs to fermionic Gross-Neveu criticality, and is robust upon varying the permittivity or the interlayer hopping.

Title: Subwavelength Localisation in Disordered Systems
Authors: Habib Ammari, Silvio Barandun, Alexander Uhlmann
Abstract: We elucidate the different mechanisms of wave localisation in disordered finite systems of subwavelength resonators, where the disorder is in the spatial arrangement of the resonators. To do so, we employ the capacitance matrix formalism and develop a variety of tools to understand localisation in this setting. Namely, we adapt the Thouless criterion of localisation to quantify the various mechanisms of localisation. We also employ a propagation matrix approach to prove a Saxon-Hutner type theorem ensuring the existence of band gaps for disordered systems and to predict the corresponding Lyapunov exponents. We further investigate the stabilities of bandgaps and localised eigenmodes with respect to fluctuations in the system by introducing a method of defect mode prediction based on the discrete Green function and illuminating the phenomena of Anderson localisation and level repulsion under global disorder.

Title: On the relation between fractional charge and statistics
Authors: T. H. Hansson, Rodrigo Arouca, Thomas Klein Kvorning
Abstract: We revisit an argument, originally given by Kivelson and Roček, for why the existence of fractional charge necessarily implies fractional statistics. In doing so, we resolve a contradiction in the original argument, and in the case of a $\nu = 1/m$ Laughlin holes, we also show that the standard relation between fractional charge and statistics is necessary by an argument based on a t'Hooft anomaly in a one-form global ${\mathcal Z}_m$ symmetry.

Title: Identifying Split Vacancy Defects with Machine-Learned Foundation Models and Electrostatics
Authors: Seán R. Kavanagh
Abstract: Point defects are ubiquitous in solid-state compounds, dictating many functional properties such as conductivity, catalytic activity and carrier recombination. Over the past decade, the prevalence of metastable defect geometries and their importance to relevant properties has been increasingly recognised. A striking example is split vacancies, where an isolated atomic vacancy transforms to a stoichiometry-conserving complex of two vacancies and an interstitial ($V_X \rightarrow [V_X + X_i + V_X]$), which can be accompanied by a dramatic energy lowering and change in behaviour. These species are particularly challenging to identify from computation, due to the `non-local' nature of this reconstruction. Here, I present an approach for the efficient identification of these defects, through tiered screening which combines geometric analysis, electrostatic energies and foundation machine learning (ML) models. This approach allows the screening of all solid-state compounds in the Materials Project database (including all entries in the ICSD, along with several thousand predicted metastable materials), identifying thousands of low energy split vacancy configurations, hitherto unknown. This study highlights both the potential utility of (foundation) machine-learning potentials, with important caveats, the significant prevalence of split vacancy defects in inorganic solids, and the importance of global optimisation approaches for defect modelling.

Title: Dynamical electron-phonon vertex correction
Authors: Andrea Marini
Abstract: The dynamical screening of the electron--phonon vertex is caused by the retarded oscillations of the electronic charge following the electron--hole scattering with a phonon mode. This retardation induces a frequency dependence of the electron--phonon interaction. Model Hamiltonians and {\em ab--initio} approaches have instilled the idea that this retardation is, in most of the cases, negligible. In this work I demonstrate that the dynamical screening of the electron--phonon vertex cannot be neglected {\em a priori}. By using a perturbative expansion I introduce a controllable and physically sound method to evaluate and include dynamical screening effects. Based on the exact results of the homogeneous electron gas I propose a dynamical vertex correction function $\Gamma_{e-p}(\omega)$ designed to screen the commonly used adiabatic electron--phonon interaction. This function is expressed in terms of adiabatic quantities, that can be easily calculated and used to evaluate the strength of the dynamical corrections, even in realistic materials.

Title: Slow convergence of spin-wave expansion and magnon dispersion in the 1/3 plateau of the triangular XXZ antiferromagnet
Authors: Achille Mauri, Frédéric Mila
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments on the quantum magnet K$_{2}$Co(SeO$_{3}$)$_{2}$, we study theoretically the excitation spectrum of the nearest-neighbour triangular XXZ model in the limit of strong easy-axis anisotropy, within the up-up-down (1/3-plateau) phase. We make an expansion in $\alpha =J_{xy}/J_{zz}$ instead of $1/S$ and calculate the magnon dispersion for any value of the spin $S$ at second order in $\alpha$, with two important conclusions: (i) the 1/S expansion converges very slowly for S=1/2, making spin-wave theory quantitatively inaccurate up to very large orders; (ii) compared to the linear spin-wave predictions, our magnon dispersion presents a much better agreement with experimental results on K$_{2}$Co(SeO$_{3}$)$_{2}$, for which $\alpha \simeq 0.08$.

Title: Spin-flip Scattering at a Chiral Interface of Helical Chains
Authors: Keita Matsubara, Kazumasa Hattori
Abstract: We investigate spin-flip scattering processes of electrons when they pass a chiral interface, which is the boundary between right- and left-handed one-dimensional chain. We construct a minimal $p$-orbital model consisting of the right- and left-handed one-dimensional threefold helical chains connected at $z=0$ with the nearest neighbor hopping and the spin-orbit coupling. The dynamics of spin-polarized wave packet passing through the interface, the Green's functions, and electronic states near the interface are analyzed numerically. We find that the microscopic structure of the interface is important and this strongly affects the local electronic orbital state. This in addition to the spin-orbit coupling determines whether the spin flip occurs or not at the chiral interface and suggests a possible spin transport control by the orbital configuration at the chiral interface.

Title: Enhancing Electrical Properties of Selectively Grown In-Plane InAs Nanowires using InGaAs Buffer and Capping Layers
Authors: Pradip Adhikari, Anjali Rathore, Dayrl P Briggs, Srijanto R Bernadeta, Joon Sue Lee
Abstract: In-plane semiconductor nanowires with complex branched geometries, prepared via selective area growth (SAG), offer a versatile platform for advanced electronics, optoelectronics, and quantum devices. However, defects and disorder at the interfaces and top surfaces of the nanowires can significantly degrade their electrical properties. One effective method to mitigate these issues is the incorporation of buffer and capping layers. In this work, we achieved a wider growth selectivity window of InGaAs in the presence of atomic hydrogen (H) and employed it as buffer and capping layers for SAG InAs nanowires to enhance their electrical properties. Hall measurements on InAs nanowires, with and without InGaAs buffer and/or capping layers, revealed that incorporating closely lattice-matched InGaAs buffer and capping layers to InAs nanowires nearly tripled the electron mobility and doubled the phase coherence length compared to nanowires without these layers. These findings demonstrate that the use of InGaAs buffer and capping layers is a crucial strategy for significantly enhancing the quality of InAs nanowires, unlocking their full potential for high performance electronics and quantum devices.

Title: Tunable electron-electron interaction and anomalous enhancement of large-momentum scattering in moiré superlattices
Authors: Taiki Sato, Hiroaki Ishizuka
Abstract: Using a microscopic model, we show that the electron-electron interaction of flat bands deviates significantly from the Coulomb interaction. In particular, we find that large-momentum scattering is enhanced at $\theta\lesssim4^\circ$, with a non-monotonic momentum dependence appearing near the magic angle. For $\theta \gtrsim 1.2^\circ$, the enhanced large-momentum scattering can be attributed to the compact Wannier function. On the other hand, for $\theta\lesssim1.2^\circ$, the nonmonotonic momentum dependence of the interaction matrix cannot be explained by a simple Wannier orbital, indicating a nontrivial modification to the el-el interaction. Notably, the range of angles $\theta$ where the large-momentum scattering is enhanced differs from the magic angles at which nearly-flat bands emerge, suggesting that the angle dependence of material properties provides information about the effect of interaction. The results highlight unusual features of the interaction in moiré graphene.

Title: Capturing the Demon in Szilard's Engine
Authors: Xiangjun Xing (Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China)
Abstract: In Szilard's engine, a demon measures a one-particle gas and applies feedback to extract work from thermal fluctuations, embodying Maxwell's notion that information reduces thermodynamic entropy - an apparent second-law violation. The Landauer-Bennett Thesis resolves this paradox by requiring the demon to record the measurement, which results in an entropy increase in the demon's memory. Eventually, the demon's memory needs to be erased. The erasure costs the same work as extracted previously, hence there is no violation of the second law. Though widely accepted, the fictitious memory invoked in the thesis has drawn multiple criticisms, with debates persisting over the demon's necessity. We show that the demon is the piston that partitions the space and drives the expansion. The final position of the piston after expansion records the particle's position pre-expansion: it is an ``information-bearing degree of freedom''. In this Piston-Demon Thesis, memory register and feedback (expansion) happen simultaneously. Our exposition identifies the mischievous demon as a physical degree of freedom, and greatly simplifies Szilard's engine. It also offers educators a tangible illustration of information-thermodynamics.

Title: Complete suppression of flux instabilities in ramped superconducting magnets with synchronous temperature-modulated Jc
Authors: Cun Xue, Han-Xi Ren, Kai-Wei Cao, Wei Liu, Wen-Tao Zhang, Fang Yang, Guo Yan, You-He Zhou, Pingxiang Zhang
Abstract: Nonlinear multi-field coupling as an intrinsic property of complex physical systems often leads to abrupt and undesired instabilities. For current-ramped high-field Nb3Sn magnets, frequent flux jumps are observed, which easily causes premature quenches and requires prolonged and resource-intensive magnet training process. In this study, we propose a paradigm-shifting methodology framework that achieves complete suppression of thermomagnetic instabilities through synchronized temperature-modulated critical current density (Jc). Through numerical simulations of flux jumps in multifilamentary Nb3Sn wires exposed to a time-varying magnetic field at various temperatures, we construct thermomagnetic stability diagram in the Ha-T plane. The simulated results are in good agreement with experimental measurements, which demonstrates the synchronized ramped-down temperature can indeed fully eliminate flux jumps. We reveal the underlying physical mechanism of enhancing the thermomagnetic stability arises from that synchronized ramped-down temperature can continuously tune both Jc and its slope. Furthermore, we carry out numerical simulations for the thermomagnetic instabilities of current-ramped superconducting magnets through large-scale GPU-optimized algorithm with home-made codes. The flux jump and quench diagram in the Ia-T plane are obtained. It indicates that the ramped-down temperature can completely suppress flux jumps without compromising Jc at high magnetic fields. Importantly, this method does not require modifications to the superconducting microstructures or fabrication process, offering a practical and broadly applicable this http URL findings offer a robust method to stabilize diverse superconducting magnet systems (including 2nd-gen coated tape HTS magnets), and propose a generalizable strategy for controlling instability in nonlinear non-equilibrium physical systems.

Title: Non-Hermitian and Liouvillian skin effects in magnetic systems
Authors: Xin Li, Mohamed Al Begaowe, Shu Zhang, Benedetta Flebus
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) has emerged as a hallmark of non-Hermitian physics, with far-reaching implications for transport, topology, and sensing. While recent works have uncovered the NHSE in magnetic systems, these analyses rely on effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, thereby leaving open critical questions regarding their applicability and predictive power in experimentally feasible platforms. Here, we address this gap by exploring both the non-Hermitian and Liouvillian dynamics of a spin chain coupled to a shared bosonic reservoir. We identify the parameter regime in which these frameworks yield congruent predictions, while showing that the non-Hermitian approach fails to capture essential dynamical features -- such as relevant timescales and conditions for experimental observability. Our analysis also reveals that the NHSE stems from the interplay between chiral spin couplings and reciprocal nonlocal dissipation -- two interactions that can naturally occur in magnetic crystals and be easily engineered in magnetic heterostructures. Focusing on a concrete example of such heterostructures, we establish an explicit connection between their Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) dynamics and our microscopic model, providing a tangible route toward realizing the NHSE in an experimentally relevant spintronics setup.

Title: Unitary Designs of Symmetric Local Random Circuits
Authors: Yosuke Mitsuhashi, Ryotaro Suzuki, Tomohiro Soejima, Nobuyuki Yoshioka
Abstract: We have established the method of characterizing the unitary design generated by a symmetric local random circuit. Concretely, we have shown that the necessary and sufficient condition for the circuit asymptotically forming a t-design is given by simple integer optimization for general symmetry and locality. By using the result, we explicitly give the maximal order of unitary design under the $\mathbb{Z}_2$, U(1), and SU(2) symmetries for general locality. This work reveals the relation between the fundamental notions of symmetry and locality in terms of randomness.

Title: Characterization of randomness in quantum circuits of continuous gate sets
Authors: Yosuke Mitsuhashi, Ryotaro Suzuki, Tomohiro Soejima, Nobuyuki Yoshioka
Abstract: In the accompanying paper of arXiv:2408.13472, we have established the method of characterizing the maximal order of asymptotic unitary designs generated by symmetric local random circuits, and have explicitly specified the order in the cases of $\mathbb{Z}_2$, U(1), and SU(2) symmetries. Here, we provide full details on the derivation of the main theorems for general symmetry and for concrete symmetries. Furthermore, we consider a general framework where we have access to a finite set of connected compact unitary subgroups, which includes symmetric local unitary gate sets.

Title: A new series of 3D CFTs with $\mathrm{Sp}(N)$ global symmetry on fuzzy sphere
Authors: Zheng Zhou, Yin-Chen He
Abstract: The quest to discover new 3D CFTs has been intriguing for physicists. For this purpose, fuzzy sphere reguarlisation that studies interacting quantum systems defined on the lowest Landau level on a sphere has emerged as a powerful tool. In this paper, we discover a series of new CFTs with global symmetry $\mathrm{Sp}(N)$ in the fuzzy sphere models that are closely related to the $\mathrm{SO}(5)$ deconfined phase transition, and are described by a $\mathrm{Sp}(N)/(\mathrm{Sp}(M)\times \mathrm{Sp}(N-M))$ non-linear sigma model with a Wess-Zumino-Witten term. We numerically verify the emergent conformal symmetry by observing the integer-spaced conformal multiplets and studying the finite-size scaling of the conformality. We discuss possible candidates for these newly discovered CFTs, the most plausible ones being Chern-Simons-matter theories which have $N$ flavour of gapless bosons or fermions coupled to a non-Abelian (viz. $\mathrm{Sp}(1)$, $\mathrm{Sp}(2)$, etc.) Chern-Simons gauge field. Our work provides new avenues for studying interacting CFTs in 3D, possibly facilitating the non-perturbative study of critical gauge theories and previously undiscovered CFTs.

Title: Stochastic resetting in discrete-time quantum dynamics: steady states and correlations in few-qubit systems
Authors: Sascha Wald, Louie Hong Yao, Thierry Platini, Chris Hooley, Federico Carollo
Abstract: Time evolution in several classes of quantum devices is generated through the application of quantum gates. Resetting is a critical technological feature in these systems allowing for mid-circuit measurement and complete or partial qubit reset. The possibility of realizing discrete-time reset dynamics on quantum computers makes it important to investigate the steady-state properties of such dynamics. Here, we explore the behavior of generic discrete-time unitary dynamics interspersed by random reset events. For Poissonian resets, we compute the stationary state of the process and demonstrate, by taking a weak-reset limit, the existence of "resonances" in the quantum gates, allowing for the emergence of steady state density matrices which are not diagonal in the eigenbasis of the generator of the unitary gate. Such resonances are a genuine discrete-time feature and impact on quantum and classical correlations even beyond the weak-reset limit. Furthermore, we consider non-Poissonian reset processes and explore conditions for the existence of a steady state. We show that, when the reset probability vanishes sufficiently rapidly with time, the system does not approach a steady state. Our results highlight key differences between continuous-time and discrete-time stochastic resetting and may be useful to engineer states with controllable correlations on existing devices.

Title: Dielectric waveguide setup tested with a superconducting millimeter-wave Fabry-Pérot interferometer at milli-Kelvin temperatures
Authors: Jakob Lenschen (1), Rosalie Labbe (1), Nils Drotleff (1), Markus Fuhrmann (1), Jürgen Lisenfeld (1), Hannes Rotzinger (1 and 2), Alexey V. Ustinov (1 and 2) ((1) Physiklalisches Institut, Karlsruher Institut für Technologie, (2) Institut für Quantenmaterialien und Technologie, Karlsruher Institut für Technologie)
Abstract: We propose and test a cryogenic setup comprising dielectric waveguides for mm-wave frequencies in the range of 75-110 GHz and temperatures down to 10 mK. The targeted applications are quantum technologies at millimeter-wave frequencies, which require measurements at low photon numbers and noise. We show that the high density polyethylene waveguides combine a frequency independent low photon loss with a very low heat conductance. Black high density polyethylene shows a higher attenuation, which is useful to block thermal photons in a cryogenic environment. The dielectric waveguides are thermally anchored and attenuated at several stages of the cryostat. They are individually protected by additional metallic shields to suppress mutual cross-talk and external interference. With this setup, multiple superconducting resonances of a Fabry-Pérot cavity were measured at 10 mK. We find quality factors up to 15 million in the single photon limit for resonances above 100 GHz. These results show no evident influence of atomic two-level systems in the cavity.

Title: Critical behavior of the Schwinger model via gauge-invariant VUMPS
Authors: Hirotsugu Fujii, Kohei Fujikura, Yoshio Kikukawa, Takuya Okuda, Juan W. Pedersen
Abstract: We study the lattice Schwinger model by combining the variational uniform matrix product state (VUMPS) algorithm with a gauge-invariant matrix product ansatz that locally enforces the Gauss law constraint. Both the continuum and lattice versions of the Schwinger model with $\theta=\pi$ are known to exhibit first-order phase transitions for the values of the fermion mass above a critical value, where a second-order phase transition occurs. Our algorithm enables a precise determination of the critical endpoint in the continuum theory. We further analyze the scaling in the simultaneous critical and continuum limits and confirm that the data collapse aligns with the Ising universality class to remarkable precision.

Title: Optical Switching of $χ^{(2)}$ in Diamond Photonics
Authors: Sigurd Flågan, Joe Itoi, Prasoon K. Shandilya, Vinaya K. Kavatamane, Matthew Mitchell, David P. Lake, Paul E. Barclay
Abstract: Diamond's unique physical properties make it a versatile materials for a wide range of nonlinear and quantum photonic technologies. However, unlocking diamond's full potential as a nonlinear photonic material with non-zero second-order susceptibility $\chi^{(2)}\neq0$ requires symmetry breaking. In this work, we use a nanoscale cavity to demonstrate second-harmonic generation (SHG) in diamond, and demonstrate, for the first time, that the magnitude of the diamond's effective $\chi^{(2)}$ strongly depends on the electronic configuration of defects in the diamond crystal, such as nitrogen vacancy centres. The modification of $\chi^{(2)}$ arises from photoionisation from the negative to neutral charge state, and is manifested by quenching of SHG upon green illumination. Toggling the green illumination allows for optical switching of the device's $\chi^{(2)}$. Optical control of $\chi^{(2)}$ by defect engineering opens the door for second-order nonlinear processes in diamond.

Title: MachMachine Learning Accelerated Descriptor Design for Catalyst Discovery in CO$_2$ to Methanol Conversion
Authors: Prajwal Pisal, Ondrej Krejci, Patrick Rinke
Abstract: Transforming CO$_2$ into methanol represents a crucial step towards closing the carbon cycle, with thermoreduction technology nearing industrial application. However, obtaining high methanol yields and ensuring the stability of heterocatalysts remain significant challenges. Herein, we present a sophisticated computational framework to accelerate the discovery of thermal heterogeneous catalysts, using machine-learned force fields. We propose a new catalytic descriptor, termed adsorption energy distribution, that aggregates the binding energies for different catalyst facets, binding sites, and adsorbates. The descriptor is versatile and can be adjusted to a specific reaction through careful choice of the key-step reactants and reaction intermediates. By applying unsupervised machine learning and statistical analysis to a dataset comprising nearly 160 metallic alloys, we offer a powerful tool for catalyst discovery. We propose new promising candidates such as ZnRh and ZnPt$_3$, which to our knowledge, have not yet been tested, and discuss their possible advantage in terms of stability.

Title: Diversity of Superradiant Phase Transitions in the Bose-Fermi System under Tight-Binding Model in the Weak-Coupling Regime
Authors: Xing Su, Jian-Jian Cheng, Lin Zhang
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the dynamic diversity associated with superradiant phase transitions within a one-dimensional tight-binding electronic chain that is intrinsically coupled to a single-mode optical cavity. By employing the quantized electromagnetic vector potential through the Peierls substitution, the gauge-invariant coupled Bose-Fermi system facilitates momentum-dependent superradiant transitions and effectively avoids the second-order spurious phase transitions typically observed in Dicke-like models. The quantum phase transitions in this system are characterized by stable dynamics, including the displacement and squeezing of the cavity mode and the redistribution of electronic momentum in the solid chain. Distinct from multimode cavity QED systems with atomic gases, this single-mode optical configuration unveils a range of nonlinear phenomena, including multistability and diversity of spontaneous symmetry breaking. The setup allows for precise manipulation of superradiant phases in the weak coupling regime, effectively mitigating the adverse effects of quantum fluctuation divergences. The diverse attributes of these quantum phase transitions enhance our understanding of tunable quantum solid devices and underscore their potential applications in quantum information processing and metrology.

Title: Classification of locality preserving symmetries on spin chains
Authors: Alex Bols, Wojciech De Roeck, Michiel De Wilde, Bruno de O. Carvalho
Abstract: We consider the action of a finite group $G$ by locality preserving automorphisms (quantum cellular automata) on quantum spin chains. We refer to such group actions as ``symmetries''. The natural notion of equivalence for such symmetries is \emph{stable equivalence}, which allows for stacking with factorized group actions. Stacking also endows the set of equivalence classes with a group structure. We prove that the anomaly of such symmetries provides an isomorphism between the group of stable equivalence classes of symmetries with the cohomology group $H^3(G,U(1))$, consistent with previous conjectures. This amounts to a complete classification of locality preserving symmetries on spin chains. We further show that a locality preserving symmetry is stably equivalent to one that can be presented by finite depth quantum circuits with covariant gates if and only if the slant product of its anomaly is trivial in $H^2(G, U(1)[G])$.

Title: Predicting fermionic densities using a Projected Quantum Kernel method
Authors: Francesco Perciavalle, Francesco Plastina, Michele Pisarra, Nicola Lo Gullo
Abstract: We use a support vector regressor based on a projected quantum kernel method to predict the density structure of 1D fermionic systems of interest in quantum chemistry and quantum matter. The kernel is built on with the observables of a quantum reservoir implementable with interacting Rydberg atoms. Training and test data of the fermionic system are generated using a Density Functional Theory approach. We test the performance of the method for several Hamiltonian parameters, finding a general common behavior of the error as a function of measurement time. At sufficiently large measurement times, we find that the method outperforms the classical linear kernel method and can be competitive with the radial basis function method.

Title: Something about the Mechanism of Induction: The forgotten work of Berta de Haas-Lorentz on diamagnetism in superconductors
Authors: Giulia Venditti, Carlo Beenakker, Louk Rademaker
Abstract: In 1925, Dr. Geertruida Luberta "Berta" de Haas-Lorentz published the paper "Iets over het mechanisme van inductieverschijnselen" in the journal Physica. Her paper was the first to discuss perfect diamagnetism of superconductors, eight years before the discovery of the Meissner effect. Unfortunately, her work was almost forgotten by the scientific community. To counter this, we translate her seminal 1925 paper from Dutch into English. We provide an overview of the life of Dr. De Haas-Lorentz, and comment on her pioneering contribution to the theory of superconductivity.
