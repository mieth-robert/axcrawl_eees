Title: The Ising model and random fields of scales
Authors: Ricardo Gómez Aíza
Abstract: Random fields of scales result when the class of musical scales is thought as a set of sites, and a site can be in one of two possible states (or spins): On or Off. We present a flexible simulated annealing model that produces generic configurations arising from equilibrium states (or Gibbs measures) associated to hamiltonian energy functions defined in terms of musical interactions with parameters that can be manipulated to customize properties of the scales. The starting point is to think of the set of scales as the combinatorial class of integer compositions and the final result is an effective thermodynamic search engine implemented in an open access application for the 12-TET tuning system: Scaletor.

Title: Electrostatic Charge Fractionalization and Unconventional Superconductivity in Strained Monolayer Graphene
Authors: Elias Andrade, Alejandro Jimeno-Pozo, Pierre A. Pantaleon, Francisco Guinea, Gerardo G. Naumis
Abstract: Two-dimensional systems with flat bands support correlated phases such as superconductivity and charge fractionalization. While twisted moire systems like twisted bilayer graphene have revealed such states, they remain complex to control. Here, we study monolayer graphene under uniaxial periodic strain, which forms a 1D moire and hosts two flat, sublattice-polarized bands. It is shown that this system exhibits features akin to its twisted counterparts, such as a pinning of the Fermi level to the van Hove singularity and unconventional superconductivity. We also found inhomogeneous charge density waves for rational fractional fillings of the unit cell

Title: Majoranas with a twist: Tunable Majorana zero modes in altermagnetic heterostructures
Authors: Andreas Hadjipaschalis, Sayed Ali Akbar Ghorashi, Jennifer Cano
Abstract: Altermagnetism provides new routes to realize Majorana zero modes with vanishing net magnetization. We consider a recently proposed heterostructure consisting of a semiconducting wire on top of an altermagnet and with proximity-induced superconductivity. We demonstrate that rotating the wire serves as a tuning knob to induce the topological phase. For $d$-, $g$- and $i$-wave altermagnetic pairing, we derive angle-dependent topological gap-closing conditions. We derive symmetry constraints on angles where the induced altermagnetism must vanish, which we verify by explicit models. Our results imply that a bent or curved wire realizes a spatially-dependent topological invariant with Majorana zero modes pinned to positions where the topological invariant changes. This provides a new experimental set-up whereby a single wire can host both topologically trivial and nontrivial regimes without $in$ $situ$ tuning.

Title: Detection of 2D SPT phases under decoherence
Authors: Naren Manjunath, Alex Turzillo, Chong Wang
Abstract: We propose a bulk order parameter for extracting symmetry-protected topological (SPT) invariants of quantum many-body mixed states on a two dimensional lattice using partial symmetries. The procedure builds on the partial symmetry order parameter recently developed by some of the authors to study SPT phases of pure states and adapts them to the decohered setting. For a symmetry $G = E \times A$ where $E$ is a strong symmetry and $A$ is a weak symmetry, we show that the partial symmetry order parameter detects SPT invariants jointly protected by $E$ and $A$. We demonstrate this explicitly using a class of mixed states obtained from CZX-type models with $\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry and subjecting them to noise that weakens one of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries. We also comment on the practical detection of SPT invariants in quantum simulators through randomized measurements.

Title: Majorana zero modes in semiconductor-superconductor hybrid structures: Defining topology in short and disordered nanowires through Majorana splitting
Authors: Haining Pan, Sankar Das Sarma
Abstract: Majorana zero modes (MZMs) are bound midgap excitations at the ends of a 1D topological superconductor, which must come in pairs. If the two MZMs in the pair are sufficiently well-separated by a distance much larger than their individual localization length, then the MZMs behave as non-Abelian anyons which can be braided to carry out fault-tolerant topological quantum computation. In this `topological' regime of well-separated MZMs, their overlap is exponentially small, leading to exponentially small Majorana splitting, thus enabling the MZMs to be topologically protected by the superconducting gap. In real experimental samples, however, the existence of disorder and the finite length of the 1D wire considerably complicates the situation leading to ambiguities in defining `topology' since the Majorana splitting between the two end modes may not necessarily be small in disordered wires of short length. We theoretically study this situation by calculating the splitting in experimentally relevant short disordered wires, and explicitly investigating the applicability of the `exponential protection' constraint as a function of disorder, wire length, and other system parameters. We find that the exponential regime is highly constrained, and is suppressed for disorder somewhat less than the topological superconducting gap. We provide detailed results and discuss the implications of our theory for the currently active experimental search for MZMs in superconductor-semiconductor hybrid platforms.

Title: Robustness of real-space topology in moiré systems
Authors: Kryštof Kolář, Kang Yang, Felix von Oppen, Christophe Mora
Abstract: The appearance of fractional Chern insulators in moiré systems can be rationalized by the presence of a fictitious magnetic field associated with the spatial texture of layer-resolved electronic wavefunctions. Here, we present a systematic study of real-space topology and the associated fictitious magnetic fields in moiré systems. We first show that at the level of individual Bloch wavefunctions, the real-space Chern number, akin to a Pontryagin index, is a fragile marker. It generically vanishes except for specific limits where the Bloch functions exhibit fine-tuned zeroes within the unit cell, such as the chiral limit of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) or the adiabatic regime of twisted homobilayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD). We then show that these limitations do not apply to textures associated with ensembles of Bloch wavefunctions, such as entire bands or the ensemble of states at a given energy. The Chern number of these textures defines a robust topological index protected by a spectral gap. We find that symmetries constrain it to be nonzero for both twisted TMDs and TBG across all twist angles and levels of corrugation, implying experimental signatures in scanning tunneling microscopy measurements. We also study real-space topology within the topological heavy fermion model of TBG, finding that the real-space topological features are supported only by the light c-electrons.

Title: Identifying Anyonic Topological Order in Fractional Quantum Anomalous Hall Systems
Authors: Hisham Sati, Urs Schreiber
Abstract: Recently observed fractional quantum anomalous Hall materials (FQAH) are candidates for topological quantum hardware, but their required anyon states are elusive. We point out dependence on monodromy in the fragile band topology in 2-cohomotopy. An algebro-topological theorem of Larmore & Thomas (1980) then identifies FQAH anyons over momentum space. Admissible braiding phases are 2C-th roots of unity, for C the Chern number. This lays the foundation for understanding symmetry-protected topological order in FQAH systems, reducing the problem to computations in equivariant cohomotopy.

Title: Mixed valence Mott insulator and composite excitation in twisted bilayer graphene
Authors: Jing-Yu Zhao, Boran Zhou, Ya-Hui Zhang
Abstract: Interplay of strong correlation and flat topological band has been a central problem in moiré systems such as the magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (TBG). Recent studies show that Mott-like states may still be possible in TBG despite the Wannier obstruction. However, the nature of such unconventional states is still not well understood. In this work we construct the ground state wavefunction and exotic excitations of a symmetric correlated semimetal or insulator at even integer filling using a parton mean field theory of the topological heavy fermion model. We label the valence of the $f$ orbital based on its occupation $n_f$. At $\nu=-2$, we show that the $f$ orbital is not in the simple $f^{2+}$ valence expected from a trivial Mott localization. Instead, around $1/3$ of AA sites are self doped, with holes entering the $c$ orbitals away from AA sites. As a result, the $f$ orbital is in a superposition of $f^{2+}$ and $f^{3+}$ valences and should not be viewed as local moment. We dub the phase as \textit{mixed valence Mott insulator}. This unconventional insulator has a large hybridization $\langle c^\dagger f \rangle\neq 0$ and is sharply distinct from the usual `kondo breakdown' picture. In most of the momentum space away from the $\Gamma$ point, there is a Mott gap equal to the Hubbard $U$. At the $\Gamma$ point, we have a `charge transfer gap' much smaller than $U$. In particular, the top of the lower band is dominated by a composite excitation, which is a linear combination of $|f^{1+}\rangle\langle f^{2+}|$ and $|f^{2+}\rangle\langle f^{3+}|$ with a sign structure such that it is orthogonal to the microscopic $f$ operator. At $\nu=0$, similar approach leads to a Mott semimetal. We hope this work will inspire more explorations of the Anderson models with a large hybridization, a regime which may host new physics beyond the familiar Kondo or heavy fermion systems.

Title: Superconductivity via paramagnon and magnon exchange in a 2D near-ferromagnetic full metal and ferromagnetic half-metal
Authors: Zachary M Raines, Andrey V Chubukov
Abstract: We study superconductivity in paramagnetic and ferromagnetically-ordered phases in a two-dimensional electron system with parabolic fermionic dispersion and short-range repulsive interaction. In the paramagnetic phase, we find that a weak momentum dependence of a paramagnon propagator parametrically reduces the onset temperature for the pairing compared to that in phenomenological theories which assume a strong dispersion of a paramagnon and also changes the topology of the gap function. In the ferromagnetic phase, we show that the order instantly polarizes low-energy fermionic excitations. We derive the fully renormalized pairing interaction between low-energy fermions, mediated by two transverse Goldstone modes and show that it is attractive in a spatially-odd channel. The pairing temperature in the ferromagnetic phase is found to be a fraction of the Fermi energy, significantly larger than in the paramagnetic phase near the transition. Our results are relevant for understanding superconductivity in proximity to itinerant ferromagnetism in multi-valley graphene systems, particularly the ones with full valley and spin polarization.

Title: Superconductivity induced by spin-orbit coupling in a two-valley ferromagnet
Authors: Zachary M Raines, Andrey V Chubukov
Abstract: We analyze the origin of superconductivity in a ferromagnetically ordered state of multi-layer graphene systems placed in proximity to WSe$_2$. We model these materials by a two-valley system of interacting fermions with small pockets and Ising spin-orbit coupling. The model yields a canted ferromagnetic order, which gives rise to a half-metal. We obtain the magnon spectrum and derive two sets of magnon-mediated 4-fermion interactions: spin-flip interactions mediated by a single magnon and spin-preserving interactions mediated by two magnons. We argue that both processes have to be included on equal footing into the magnon-mediated pairing interaction between low-energy fermions from the filled bands. Then the full magnon-mediated interaction satisfies Adler criterion and for a valley-odd/spatially-even order parameter contains a universal attractive piece. This term is induced by spin-orbit coupling and is confined to energies which are parametrically smaller than the Fermi energy. We argue that, due to retardation, this magnon-mediated attraction gives rise to superconductivity despite that there exists a stronger static repulsion, in close analogy with how phonon-mediated attraction gives rise to pairing in the presence of stronger Coulomb (Hubbard) repulsion.

Title: Electronic structure and optical absorption of armchair graphene/boron nitride lateral heterostructures from first principles and models
Authors: Elisa Serrano Richaud, Sylvain Latil, Lorenzo Sponza
Abstract: We investigate the electronic and optical properties of lateral heterostructures made of alternated armchair ribbons of graphene and hexagonal boron nitride. We employ ab initio theories (DFT and the G0W0 method) as well as a tight-binding ladder model originally introduced to study the gapwidth of isolated nanoribbons. After investigating the charge distribution across the interface, we identify the nature of the states around the gap and scrutinize their evolution as a function of the characteristic dimensions of the system (the graphene ribbons' width N and the boron nitride ribbons' width L). We also disclose how the very interface between graphene and boron nitride changes the electronic properties of both materials with respect to the corresponding isolated nanoribbons. Finally we discuss the light absorption properties of these systems by deriving specific selection rules for the heterostructures and calculating spectra from first principles in the independent particle and the random phase approximations

Title: Kibble-Zurek dynamics across the first-order quantum transitions of quantum Ising chains in the thermodynamic limit
Authors: Andrea Pelissetto, Davide Rossini, Ettore Vicari
Abstract: We study the out-of-equilibrium Kibble-Zurek (KZ) dynamics in quantum Ising chains in a transverse field, driven by a time-dependent longitudinal field $h(t)=t/t_s$ ($t_s$ is the time scale of the protocol), across their first-order quantum transitions (FOQTs) at $h=0$. The KZ protocol starts at time $t_i<0$ from the negatively magnetized ground state for $h_i = t_i/t_s<0$. Then, the system evolves unitarily up to a time $t_f > 0$, such that the magnetization of the state at time $t_f$ is positive. In finite-size systems, the KZ dynamics develops out-of-equilibrium finite-size scaling (OFSS) behaviors. Their scaling variables depend either exponentially or with a power law on the size, depending on the boundary conditions (BC). The OFSS functions can be computed in effective models restricted to appropriate low-energy (magnetized and/or kink) states. The KZ scaling behavior drastically changes in the thermodynamic limit (TL), defined as the infinite-size limit keeping $t$ and $t_s$ fixed, which appears substantially unrelated with the OFSS regime, because it involves higher-energy multi-kink states, which are irrelevant in the OFSS limit. The numerical analyses of the KZ dynamics in the TL show the emergence of a quantum spinodal-like scaling behavior at the FOQTs for all considered BC, which is independent of the BC. The longitudinal magnetization changes sign at $h(t)=h*>0$, where $h*$ decreases with increasing $t_s$, as $h*\sim 1/\ln t_s$. Moreover, in the large-$t_s$ limit, the time-dependence of the magnetization is described by a universal function of $\Omega = t/\tau_s$, with $\tau_s = t_s/\ln t_s$.

Title: Deformation band patterns and dislocation structures in finite strain crystal viscoplasticity
Authors: Jean-Michel Scherer
Abstract: Deformation band patterning in single crystals is investigated using a finite strain crystal viscoplasticity model based on the evolution of dislocation densities. In the presence of strong latent hardening and weak rate dependence, the deformation organizes into laminate microstructures consisting of single-slip regions separated by dislocation walls. The influence of material and numerical parameters on the nucleation and morphology of these patterns is analyzed in 2D single crystals under plane strain compression. Pattern formation is also observed in 3D single-crystal cylinders subjected to tension, where the characteristic size of deformation microstructures is found to depend on mesh size and boundary conditions in the absence of an intrinsic material length scale. To address this limitation, strain gradient plasticity is introduced, providing a length scale that governs the size of the patterns. Finally, we demonstrate that deformation patterns and dislocation structures also emerge in 2D and 3D polycrystals, highlighting the generality of the phenomenon.

Title: Gliding microtubules exhibit tunable collective rotation driven by chiral active forces

Abstract: How chirality propagates across scales remains an open question in many biological and synthetic systems. An especially clear manifestation of this propagation is found in in vitro gliding assays of cytoskeletal filaments on surfaces, driven by molecular motors. These assays have become model systems of active matter dynamics, as they spontaneously organize into diverse dynamical states, including collective motions with chiral rotation. However, the microscopic mechanisms underlying these chiral collective dynamics have remained unclear. Here, we investigate rotating active nematic order in microtubule gliding assay experiments under two stabilization conditions, each on two types of substrates. We propose that chirality in active forces exerted by motors on microtubules represents a viable mechanism for this large-scale chirality. Using Brownian dynamics simulations of self-propelled, semiflexible filaments with chiral activity, we demonstrate that coherently rotating active nematic order emerges by this mechanism even in the absence of curvature, i.e. shape chirality, of the constituent filaments. Moreover, we predict that the angular speed and handedness of the collective rotation can be tuned by modulating filament stiffness. Our findings identify a new set of sufficient microscopic ingredients for predictable propagation of chiral handedness from the molecular to the material scale in living and active matter.

Title: Temperature chaos as a logical consequence of reentrant transition in spin glasses
Authors: Hidetoshi Nishimori, Masayuki Ohzeki, Manaka Okuyama
Abstract: Temperature chaos is a striking phenomenon in spin glasses, where even slight changes in temperature lead to a complete reconfiguration of the spin state. Another intriguing effect is the reentrant transition, in which lowering the temperature drives the system from a ferromagnetic phase into a less ordered spin-glass or paramagnetic phase. In the present paper, we reveal an unexpected connection between these seemingly unrelated phenomena in the finite-dimensional Edwards-Anderson model of spin glasses by introducing a generalized formulation that incorporates correlations among disorder variables. Assuming the existence of a spin glass phase at finite temperature, we establish that temperature chaos arises as a logical consequence of reentrance in the Edwards-Anderson model. Our findings uncover a previously hidden mathematical structure relating reentrance and temperature chaos, offering a new perspective on the physics of spin glasses beyond the mean-field theory.

Title: Triplet nodal lines and Chern bands in XCuCl$_{3}$ (X= K, Tl)
Authors: Charles B. Walker, Matthew Stern, Judit Romhányi
Abstract: We investigate the symmetry-enforced line nodes of the triplet excitations of XCuCl$_{3}$ (X= K, Tl), showing that they are protected by the nonsymmorphic symmetries and are unaffected by the microscopic details, such as interaction and anisotropy strength, as long as the ground state and the symmetry group remain unaltered. Extending the conventionally used isotropic spin model for XCuCl$_{3}$, our analysis includes all the symmetry-allowed anisotropies and gives a detailed account of the role they play in the band topology of triplets. We show that the triplet line nodes carry nontrivial Berry phases and compute their $Z_2$ topological indices. To investigate the effect of breaking the nonsymmorphic symmetry protecting the triplet nodes, we apply a magnetic field tilted away from the high symmetry $(010)$ axis. We find that while the g-tensor anisotropy behaves as a trivial mass gapping out the triplets, exchange anisotropies supply a nontrivial momentum-dependent mass term. Analogous to Haldane's original model, the competition of these mass terms determines the nature of the band topology in XCuCl$_{3}$. To enable an analytic study of the band topology we derive an effective Dirac Hamiltonian and validate it by computing the band structure and topological indices in the nodal line and gapped phases from the linear bond-wave formalism.

Title: Homotopy continuation method for solving Dyson equation fully self-consistently: theory and application to NdNiO2
Authors: Pavel Pokhilko, Dominika Zgid
Abstract: Solution of the Dyson equation for the small-gap systems can be plagued by large non-converging iterations. In addition to the convergence issues, due to a high non-linearity, the Dyson equation may have multiple solutions. We apply the homotopy continuation approach to control the behavior of iterations. We used the homotopy continuation to locate multiple fully self-consistent GW solutions for NdNiO2 solid and to establish the corresponding Hartree-Fock limits. Some of the solutions found are qualitatively new and help to understand the nature of electron correlation in this material. We show that there are multiple low-energy charge-transfer solutions leading to a formation of charge-density waves. Our results qualitatively agree with the experimental conductivity measurements. To rationalize the structure of solutions, we compare the k-point occupations and generalize the concept of natural difference orbitals for correlated periodic solids.

Title: Topology-ferrimagnetism intertwining via weak interactions in Lieb lattices
Authors: Lei Chen, Bei-Bei Wang, Jianmin Yuan, Long Zhang, Jinsen Han, Yongqiang Li
Abstract: A common wisdom about quantum many-body systems is that emergent phases typically fall into either the Landau-Ginzburg paradigm or topological classifications. Experimentally realizing the intertwined emergence of spontaneous symmetry breaking and topological order remains challenging. Here, we present an experimentally accessible platform for studying magnetic topological states in a spin-orbit-coupled Lieb lattice. Remarkably, we observe the coexistence of topological characteristics, quantified by the Chern number and Bott index, with spontaneous symmetry-breaking orders, such as ferrimagnetism, in the many-body ground states. Computational analyses combining dynamical mean-field theory and Hartree-Fock approximations reveal a pronounced parameter regime where magnetic topological insulators emerge even under weak interactions. This unconventional phenomenon originates from the Lieb lattice's unique band structure, which facilitates the synergy between interaction-driven symmetry breaking and spin-orbit coupling induced band inversion. Crucially, spin polarization and spin winding co-emerge as inherently coupled phenomena due to their shared origin in the same interacting, spinful atoms. We further propose a specific experimental implementation scheme for ultracold atoms, utilizing currently available Raman lattice techniques. Our findings pave the way for exploring the interplay between symmetry-broken states and topological order in strongly correlated systems.

Title: Engineering NV Centers via Hydrogen-Driven Defect Chemistry in CVD Diamonds for Quantum Applications: NVHx Dissociations into NV, Origin of 468nm Center, and Cause of Brown Coloration

Abstract: Achieving high NV center conversion efficiency remains a key challenge in advancing diamond-based quantum technologies. The generally accepted mechanism for NV formation is that irradiation-induced vacancies become mobile during annealing and are trapped by substitutional nitrogen. However, the suggested mechanism does not consider the presence and role of hydrogen in the diamond and its influence on the NV formation pathway. This is despite ab-initio calculations, which strongly suggest the formation of hydrogen-passivated NV centers during CVD diamond growth. Recent experimental observations showing a strong spatial correlation between NV centers, brown coloration, and the 468 nm luminescence center in as-grown CVD diamonds prompted us to investigate the atomistic origin of these phenomena in the presence of NxVHy-type complex defects. We used hybrid density functional theory DFT calculations and spectroscopic analysis of CVD diamonds grown with varying nitrogen content to investigate defect equilibria during growth. We identified the 468 nm center as the NVH- defect, a hydrogen-passivated NV center, and assigned the characteristic UV-VIS absorption bands at 270 360 and 520 nm to NxVHy complexes. Our findings reveal that hydrogen plays a central role in stabilizing these defects during growth. We further showed that NVHx complex defects dissociate into NV centers and interstitial hydrogen during post-growth irradiation and annealing, complementing vacancy trapping by substitutional nitrogen. These results provide a unified picture of the defect chemistry underlying brown coloration, 468 nm center, and NV formation in CVD diamonds, offering new insights for optimizing diamond synthesis and processing for quantum applications by taking advantage of hydrogens role and dissociation of NVHx complexes.

Title: Phase field dislocation dynamics study of grain boundary-dislocation interactions
Authors: Brayan Murgas, Avanish Mishra, Nithin Mathew, Abigail Hunter
Abstract: A new phase field dislocation dynamics formulation is presented, which couples micromechanical solvers and the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation. Grain boundary (GB)-dislocation interactions are studied by describing GBs as inclusions. Grain boundary properties are computed from Molecular Statics simulations and an additional contribution to the total energy that takes into account the GB energy is considered in the calculations. Interaction of a screw dislocation with minimum energy and metastable states of low and high angle $\langle$110$\rangle$ symmetric tilt grain boundaries are studied. We show good agreement between predictions from our phase field dislocation dynamics formulation and molecular dynamics simulations of grain boundary-dislocation interactions.

Title: Termination-Dependent Resistive Switching in SrTiO$_3$ Valence Change Memory Cells
Authors: Marko Mladenović, Manasa Kaniselvan, Christoph Weilenmann, Alexandros Emboras, Mathieu Luisier
Abstract: Valence change memory (VCM) cells based on SrTiO$_3$ (STO), a perovskite oxide, are a promising type of emerging memory device. While the operational principle of most VCM cells relies on the growth and dissolution of one or multiple conductive filaments, those based on STO are known to exhibit a distinctive, 'interface-type' switching, which is associated with the modulation of the Schottky barrier at their active electrode. Still, a detailed picture of the processes that lead to interface-type switching is not available. In this work, we use a fully atomistic and ab initio model to study the resistive switching of a Pt-STO-Ti stack. We identify that the termination of the crystalline STO plays a decisive role in the switching mechanism, depending on the relative band alignment between the material and the Pt electrode. In particular, we show that the accumulation of oxygen vacancies at the Pt side can be at the origin of resistive switching in TiO$_2$-terminated devices by lowering the conduction band minimum of the STO layer, thus facilitating transmission through the Schottky barrier. Moreover, we investigate the possibility of filamentary switching in STO and reveal that it is most likely to occur at the Pt electrode of the SrO-terminated cells.

Title: Quenching of excitons at grain boundaries in C60 thin films

Abstract: Exciton lifetimes play a critical role in the performance of organic optoelectronic devices. In this work, we investigate how the presence of multiple rotational domains, and therefore grain boundaries, impacts exciton dynamics in thin films of C60/Au(111) using time and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (TR-ARPES). We find that films with multiple rotational domains exhibit shorter exciton lifetimes and evidence of exciton-exciton annihilation, even when one domain predominates. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements reveal electronic structure changes resulting from a locally reduced dielectric constant at grain boundaries, providing a mechanism for lifetime reduction through exciton funneling and other additional decay channels. These findings highlight the critical role of film quality in determining intrinsic exciton lifetimes, and show that minuscule amounts of disorder that are nearly undetectable by ensemble measurements can significantly impact dynamics. These results imply that precise structural control is essential for optimize the performance of organic optoelectronic devices.

Title: Origami of Multi-Layered Spaced Sheets
Authors: Guowei Wayne Tu, Evgueni T. Filipov
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) origami tessellations such as the Miura-ori are often generalized to build three-dimensional (3D) architected materials with sandwich or cellular structures. However, such 3D blocks are densely packed with continuity of the internal material, while for many engineering structures with multi-physical functionality, it is necessary to have thin sheets that are separately spaced and sparsely connected. This work presents a framework for the design and analysis of multi-layered spaced origami, which provides an origami solution for 3D structures where multiple flat sheets are intentionally spaced apart. We connect Miura-ori sheets with sparsely installed thin-sheet parallelogram-like linkages. To explore how this connectivity approach affects the behavior of the origami system, we model the rigid-folding kinematics using analytic trigonometry and rigid-body transformations, and we characterize the elastic-folding mechanics by generalizing a reduced order bar and hinge model for these 3D assemblies. The orientation of the linkages in the multi-layered spaced origami determines which of three folding paths the system will follow including a flat foldable type, a self-locking type, and a double-branch type. When the origami is flat foldable, a maximized packing ratio and a uniform in-plane shear stiffness can be achieved by strategically choosing the link orientation. We show possible applications by demonstrating how the multi-layered spaced origami can be used to build deployable acoustic cloaks and heat shields.

Title: AstroECP: towards more practical Electron Channeling Contrast Imaging
Authors: M. Haroon Qaiser, Lukas Berners, Robin J. Scales, Tianbi Zhang, Martin Heller, Jiri Dluhos, Sandra Korte-Kerzel, T. Ben Britton
Abstract: Electron channeling contrast imaging (ECCI) is a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) based technique that enables bulk-sample characterization of crystallographic defects (e.g. dislocations, stacking faults, low angle boundaries). Despite its potential, ECCI remains underused for quantitative defect analysis as compared to transmission electron microscope (TEM) based methods. Here, we overcome barriers that limit the use of ECCI including optimizing signal-to-noise contrast, precise determination of the incident beam vector with calibrated and easy to use simulations and experimental selected area electron channeling patterns (SA-ECP). We introduce a systematic ECCI workflow, alongside a new open-source software tool (AstroECP), that includes calibration of stage tilting, SA-ECP field of view, and the energy that forms the ECP/ECCI contrast using dynamical simulations. The functionality of this workflow is demonstrated with case studies that include threading dislocations in GaAs and the cross validation of precession based ECCI-contrast, which is otherwise known as Electron Channeling Orientation Determination (eCHORD). To assist the reader, we also provide best practice guidelines for ECCI implementation to promote high-resolution defect imaging in the SEM.

Title: Femtosecond photocurrents by the Dresselhaus bulk spin-galvanic effect in an inversion-asymmetric ferromagnet

Abstract: We study ultrafast photocurrents in thin films of a model ferromagnetic metal with broken bulk inversion symmetry, the half-metallic Heusler compound NiMnSb, following excitation with an optical pump pulse with photon energy 1.55 eV. Remarkably, in terms of the direction of the sample magnetization M, all photocurrents are found to be a superposition of a component with Rashba- and Dresselhaus-type symmetry. We explain the Dresselhaus bulk photocurrent as follows: Pump-induced electron heating induces an excess of spin {\mu}_s||M, which transfers spin angular momentum into states with Dresselhaus-type spin-momentum locking. The resulting charge current relaxes on a time scale of 10 fs by momentum relaxation and, thus, follows {\mu}_s quasi-instantaneously. The relaxation of {\mu}_s is governed by the cooling of the electrons and not by the significantly slower spin-lattice relaxation of half-metals. Our findings add the Dresselhaus spin-galvanic effect (SGE) to the set of ultrafast spin-charge-conversion phenomena. They indicate a route to more efficient spintronic terahertz emitters and detectors based on the volume scaling of the bulk SGE.

Title: Generation of Pure Spin Current with Insulating Antiferromagnetic Materials
Authors: Yingwei Chen, Junyi Ji, Liangliang Hong, Xiangang Wan, Hongjun Xiang
Abstract: The generation of pure spin currents is critical for low-dissipation spintronic applications, yet existing methods relying on spin-orbit coupling or ferromagnetic interfaces face challenges in material compatibility and operational robustness. We propose a paradigm-shifting approach to generate symmetry-protected pure spin currents by applying mechanical stress on insulating antiferromagnetic materials, i.e., the pure piezospintronic effect. We first classify magnetic point groups enabling pure piezospintronic effects. A novel first-principles method is developed to compute the spin dipole moments and coefficients of the piezospintronic effect. Integrating these methodologies with high-throughput screening, we identify FeOOH, Cr2O3 and NaMnX (X=As, Bi, P, Sb) with significant pure piezospintronic effects. Interestingly, we reveal that the ionic displacement contribution dominates the piezospintronic effect, in contrast to the piezoelectric effect. Our study not only provides first-principles approach for investigating spin dipole moment related phenomena (e.g., ferrotoroidicity, fractional quantum spin dipole moment, piezospintronics), but also provide promising piezospintronic materials for experimental verification and industrial applications.

Abstract: We consider the spin $\frac{1}{2}$ XXZ chain with diagonal boundary fields and solve it exactly using Bethe ansatz in the gapped anti-ferromagnetic regime and obtain the complete phase boundary diagram. Depending on the values of the boundary fields, the system exhibits several phases which can be categorized based on the ground state exhibited by the system and also based on the number of bound states localized at the boundaries. We show that the Hilbert space is comprised of a certain number of towers whose number depends on the number of boundary bound states exhibited by the system. The system undergoes boundary phase transitions when boundary fields are varied across certain critical values. There exist two types of phase transitions. In the first type the ground state of the system undergoes a change. In the second type, named the `Eigenstate phase transition', the number of towers of the Hilbert space changes, which is again associated with the change in the number of boundary bound states exhibited by the system. We use the DMRG and exact diagonalization techniques to probe the signature of the Eigenstate phase transition and the ground state phase transition by analyzing the spin profiles in each eigenstate.

Title: Enhancing ferroelectric stability: Wide-range of adaptive control in epitaxial HfO2/ZrO2 superlattices
Authors: Jingxuan Li, Shiqing Deng, Liyang Ma, Yangyang Si, Chao Zhou, Kefan Wang, Sizhe Huang, Jiyuan Yang, Yunlong Tang, Yu-Chieh Ku, Chang-Yang Kuo, Yijie Li, Sujit Das, Shi Liu, Zuhuang Chen
Abstract: The metastability of the polar phase in HfO2, despite its excellent compatibility with the complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor process, remains a key obstacle for its industrial applications. Traditional stabilization approaches, such as doping, often induce crystal defects and impose constraints on the thickness of ferroelectric HfO2 thin films. These limitations render the ferroelectric properties vulnerable to degradation, particularly due to phase transitions under operational conditions. Here, we demonstrate robust ferroelectricity in high-quality epitaxial (HfO2)n/(ZrO2)n superlattices, which exhibit significantly enhanced ferroelectric stability across an extended thickness range. Optimized-period superlattices maintain stable ferroelectricity from up to 100 nm, excellent fatigue resistance exceeding 109 switching cycles, and a low coercive field of ~0.85 MV/cm. First-principles calculations reveal that the kinetic energy barrier of phase transition and interfacial formation energy are crucial factors in suppressing the formation of non-polar phases. This work establishes a versatile platform for exploring high-performance fluorite-structured superlattices and advances the integration of HfO2-based ferroelectrics into a broader range of applications.

Title: Second-order microscopic nonlinear susceptibility in a centrosymmetric material: application to imaging valence electron motion

Abstract: We report measurements of phase-matched nonlinear x-ray and optical sum-frequency generation from single-crystal silicon using sub-resonant 0.95 eV laser pulses and 9.5 keV hard x-ray pulses from the LCLS free-electron laser. The sum-frequency signal appears as energy and momentum sidebands to the elastic Bragg peak. It is proportional to the magnitude squared of the relevant temporal and spatial Fourier components of the optically induced microscopic charges/currents. We measure the first- and second-order sideband to the 220 Bragg peak and find that the efficiency is maximized when the applied field is along the reciprocal lattice vector. For an optical intensity of $\sim10^{12} \text{W}/\text{cm}^2$, we measure peak efficiencies of $3\times 10^{-7}$ and $3\times 10^{-10}$ for the first and second-order sideband respectively (relative to the elastic Bragg peak). The first-order sideband is consistent with induced microscopic currents along the applied electric field (consistent with an isotropic response). The second-order sideband depends nontrivially on the optical field orientation and is consistent with an anisotropic response originating from induced charges along the bonds with C$_{3v}$ site symmetry. The results agree well with first-principles Bloch-Floquet calculations.

Title: Process-aware and high-fidelity microstructure generation using stable diffusion
Authors: Hoang Cuong Phan, Minh Tien Tran, Chihun Lee, Hoheok Kim, Sehyok Oh, Dong-Kyu Kim, Ho Won Lee
Abstract: Synthesizing realistic microstructure images conditioned on processing parameters is crucial for understanding process-structure relationships in materials design. However, this task remains challenging due to limited training micrographs and the continuous nature of processing variables. To overcome these challenges, we present a novel process-aware generative modeling approach based on Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large (SD3.5-Large), a state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion model adapted for microstructure generation. Our method introduces numeric-aware embeddings that encode continuous variables (annealing temperature, time, and magnification) directly into the model's conditioning, enabling controlled image generation under specified process conditions and capturing process-driven microstructural variations. To address data scarcity and computational constraints, we fine-tune only a small fraction of the model's weights via DreamBooth and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), efficiently transferring the pre-trained model to the materials domain. We validate realism using a semantic segmentation model based on a fine-tuned U-Net with a VGG16 encoder on 24 labeled micrographs. It achieves 97.1% accuracy and 85.7% mean IoU, outperforming previous methods. Quantitative analyses using physical descriptors and spatial statistics show strong agreement between synthetic and real microstructures. Specifically, two-point correlation and lineal-path errors remain below 2.1% and 0.6%, respectively. Our method represents the first adaptation of SD3.5-Large for process-aware microstructure generation, offering a scalable approach for data-driven materials design.

Title: Effects of Antisite Defects on Seebeck Coefficient in Fe_2VAl -- Analyses based on Bipolar Random Anderson Model
Authors: Takami Tohyama, Hidetoshi Fukuyama
Abstract: A microscopic mechanism is proposed for a dramatic sign change of the Seebeck coefficient from positive to negative sign by the introduction of antisite defects in Fe$_2$VAl based on bipolar random Anderson model (BPRAM), which incorporates hybridization effects between randomly distributed antisites and host bands, where the valence and conduction bands are treated separately due to their separation in momentum space. Applying a self-consistent T-matrix approximation, we find that antisite defects in Fe$_2$VAl induce new states in the band overlap region, resulting in a scattering rate that is higher for hole carriers in the valence band than that for electron carriers in the conduction band, leading to negative Seebeck coefficient. This mechanism of sign change presents a potential new approach for controlling thermoelectric properties in semimetallic systems without changing carrier concentration.

Title: Influence of oxygen-defects on intraband terahertz conductivity of carbon nanotubes

Abstract: The exceptional charge transport properties of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) enable numerous ultrafast optoelectronic applications. Modifying SWCNTs by introducing defects significantly impacts the performance of nanotube-based devices, making defect characterization crucial. This research tracked these effects in oxygen plasma-treated SWCNT thin films. Sub-picosecond electric fields of varying strengths and additional photoexcitation were used to assess how defects influence charge carrier transport. Changes in effective conductivity within the terahertz (THz) range were found to be strongly dependent on impurity levels. The plasmon resonance shift to higher THz frequencies aligns with the defect-induced reduction in conductivity and slowed carrier migration within the network. An increase in THz field strength resulted in diminished conductivity due to intraband absorption bleaching. To address the emergence of hot charge carriers, a modified Drude model, which considers non-equilibrium charge carrier distribution via fielddependent scattering rates, was applied. The dominant charge-impurity scattering rate in plasma-treated samples corresponded with an increase in defects. Additionally, the impact of defects on charge carrier dynamics on a picosecond timescale was examined. The modeled plasma-treated SWCNTs wire-grid polarizer for the THz range reveals the potential for multi-level engineering of THz devices to customize properties through controlled defect populations.

Title: Extracting Contact Forces in Cohesive Granular Ensembles
Authors: Abrar Naseer, Karen E. Daniels, Tejas G. Murthy
Abstract: Interparticle cohesion is prevalent in stored powders, geological formations, and infrastructure engineering, yet a comprehensive understanding of the effects of its micro-mechanics on bulk properties has not been established experimentally. One challenge has been that while photoelasticy has been widely and successfully used to measure the vector contact forces within dry granular systems, where the particle-particle interactions are solely frictional and compressive in nature, it has seen little development in systems where tensile forces are present. The key difficulty has been the inability to distinguish between compressive and tensile forces, which appear identically within the photoelastic response. Here, we present a novel approach which solves this problem, by an extension to the open-source PeGS (Photoelastic Grain Solver) software available at this https URL. Our new implementation divides the procedure of finding vector contact forces into two steps: first evaluating the vector contact forces on the non-cohesive particles present in the ensemble, followed by using an equilibrium constraint to solve for the forces in the bonded particles. We find that in the dilute limit, for up to 25% bonded dimers, we can solve for all forces since each particle has only one force bearing contact that can potentially transmit tensile forces. While the case of dimers is an idealised version of cohesive granular ensemble, it provides an important first step towards experimentally studying the micro-mechanics of cohesive granular materials.

Title: Efficient GPU-Accelerated Training of a Neuroevolution Potential with Analytical Gradients
Authors: Hongfu Huang, Junhao Peng, Kaiqi Li, Jian Zhou, Zhimei Sun
Abstract: Machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) such as neuroevolution potentials (NEP) combine quantum-mechanical accuracy with computational efficiency significantly accelerate atomistic dynamic simulations. Trained by derivative-free optimization, the normal NEP achieves good accuracy, but suffers from inefficiency due to the high-dimensional parameter search. To overcome this problem, we present a gradient-optimized NEP (GNEP) training framework employing explicit analytical gradients and the Adam optimizer. This approach greatly improves training efficiency and convergence speedily while maintaining accuracy and physical interpretability. By applying GNEP to the training of Sb-Te material systems(datasets include crystalline, liquid, and disordered phases), the fitting time has been substantially reduced-often by orders of magnitude-compared to the NEP training framework. The fitted potentials are validated by DFT reference calculations, demonstrating satisfactory agreement in equation of state and radial distribution functions. These results confirm that GNEP retains high predictive accuracy and transferability while considerably improved computational efficiency, making it well-suited for large-scale molecular dynamics simulations.

Title: Interaction-Driven Giant Electrostatic Modulation of Ion Permeation in Atomically Small Capillaries

Abstract: Manipulating the electrostatic double layer and tuning the conductance in nanofluidic systems at salt concentrations of 100 mM or higher has been a persistent challenge. The primary reasons are (i) the short electrostatic proximity length, ~3-10 Å, and (ii) difficulties in fabricating atomically small capillaries. Here, we successfully fabricate in-plane vermiculite laminates with transport heights of ~3-5 Å, which exhibit a cation selectivity close to 1 even at a 1000 mM concentration, suggesting an overlapping electrostatic double layer. For gate voltages from -2 V to +1 V, the K+-intercalated vermiculite shows a remarkable conductivity modulation exceeding 1400% at a 1000 mM KCl concentration. The gated ON/OFF ratio is mostly unaffected by the ion concentration (10-1000 mM), which confirms that the electrostatic double layer overlaps with the collective ion movement within the channel with reduced activation energy. In contrast, vermiculite laminates intercalated with Ca2+ and Al3+ ions display reduced conductance with increasing negative gate voltage, highlighting the importance of ion-specific gating effects under Å-scale confinement. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of electrostatic phenomena occurring in highly confined fluidic channels, opening the way to the exploration of the vast library of two-dimensional materials.

Abstract: LiNiO2 is a promising cathode material for Li-ion battery but its atomic and electronic structure is under debate. Indeed, two sets of Ni-O distances are identified from local structural probes that are related with either Jahn-Teller distortion or bond disproportionation of NiO6 octahedra. Moreover, LiNiO2 undergoes a monoclinic to rhombohedral transition at 200 K which origin is still unclear. On the other hand, isostructural NaNiO2 shows differences from LiNiO2, as it is a well-known Jahn-Teller distorted system, and it undergoes monoclinic to rhombohedral transition at 500 K associated to the loss of the Jahn-Teller distortion. To understand better these differences, we report here Ni L3-edge Resonant inelastic X-ray scattering experiments on LiNiO2 and NaNiO2 at different temperatures (25 to 520 K) and follow the spectral changes below and above the phase transition temperatures. The observed RIXS spectra and the mapping indicate strong spectral changes for NaNiO2 confirming the disappearance of Jahn-Teller distortion during phase transition while the changes are minor for LiNiO2 suggesting very few modifications in the local structure. Theoretical simulations of RIXS spectra are required for further understanding, however, we believe that the reported dataset can be a crucial resource for developing advanced simulations that are essential to deepening our understanding of the atomic and electronic structure of these nickelates.

Title: Charge Regulation Effect on Nanoparticles Interaction Mediated by Polyelectrolyte
Authors: Vijay Yadav, Prabhat Kumar Jaiswal, Rudolf Podgornik, Sunita Kumari
Abstract: The ability to precisely control surface charge using charged polymers is fundamental to many nanotechnology applications, enabling the design and fabrication of materials with tailored properties and functionalities. Here, we study the effect of charge regulation (CR) on the interaction between two nanoparticles (NPs) mediated by an oppositely charged polyelectrolyte (PE) in an electrolyte solution. To this end, we employ a hybrid CR Monte Carlo (CR-MC)/molecular dynamics (MD) simulation framework to systematically explore the effects of pH, salt concentration, and polymer chain length on NP surface charge behavior. For comparison, we also conduct MD simulations under constant charge (CC) conditions. Our results reveal that CR enhances PE adsorption onto NP surfaces compared to the CC case, where polymer bridging dominates across a wide range of NP intersurface separations. This enhanced adsorption under CR leads to a weak net repulsion driven by osmotic forces. In contrast, the CC model yields a stronger net attraction due to the bridging force. Furthermore, we find that the CR effects are more pronounced at a low salt concentration, whereas at a high salt concentration, counterion screening dominates in both CR and CC cases, resulting in similar interaction profiles. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating charge regulation in characterizing NP interactions within a complex biochemical environment, particularly in the presence of low salt concentrations.

Title: Dissipation engineering of fermionic long-range order beyond Lindblad
Authors: Silvia Neri, François Damanet, Andrew J. Daley, Marialuisa Chiofalo, Jorga Yago Malo
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of engineering dissipatively long-range order that is robust against heating in strongly interacting fermionic systems, relevant for atoms in cavity QED. It was previously shown [Tindall et al. this http URL. 123, 030603 (2019)] that it is possible to stabilize long-range order in a Hubbard model by exploiting a dissipative mechanism in the Lindblad limit, this latter being valid for spectrally unstructured baths. Here, we first show that this mechanism still holds when including additional spin-exchange interactions in the model, that is for the tUJ model. Moreover, by means of a Redfield approach that goes beyond the Lindblad case, we show how the stability of the engineered state depends crucially on properties of the bath spectral density and discuss the feasibility of those properties in an experiment.

Title: Binding and spontaneous condensation of excitons in narrow-gap carbon nanotubes
Authors: Giacomo Sesti, Daniele Varsano, Elisa Molinari, Massimo Rontani
Abstract: Ultraclean, undoped carbon nanotubes are always insulating, even when the gap predicted by band theory is zero. The residual, observed gap is thought to have a many-body origin. Here we theoretically show that the correlated insulator is excitonic, extending our previous claim, limited to gapless (armchair) tubes [D. Varsano, S. Sorella, D. Sangalli, M. Barborini, S. Corni, E. Molinari, M. Rontani, Nature Communications $\mathbf{8}$, 1461 (2017)], to $all$ narrow-gap tubes, irrespective of their size. By enhancing the two-band model with an accurate treatment of screening, validated from first principles, we derive the scaling law of the exciton binding energy with the tube radius and chirality, and compute self-consistently the fundamental transport gap of the excitonic insulator. Our findings point to the broader connection between the exciton length scale, dictated by structure, and the stability of the excitonic phase.

Title: Many-particle hybridization of optical transitions from zero-mode Landau levels in HgTe quantum wells
Authors: S. Ruffenach, S. S. Krishtopenko, A. V. Ikonnikov, C. Consejo, J. Torres, X. Baudry, P. Ballet, B. Jouault, F. Teppe
Abstract: We present far-infrared magnetospectroscopy measurements of a HgTe quantum well in the inverted band structure regime over the temperature range of 2 to 60 K. The particularly low electron concentration enables us to probe the temperature evolution of all four possible optical transitions originating from zero-mode Landau levels, which are split off from the edges of the electron-like and hole-like bands. By analyzing their resonance energies, we reveal an unambiguous breakdown of the single-particle picture indicating that the explanation of the anticrossing of zero-mode Landau levels in terms of bulk and interface inversion asymmetries is insufficient. Instead, the observed behavior of the optical transitions is well explained by their hybridization driven by electron-electron interaction. We emphasize that our proposed many-particle mechanism is intrinsic to HgTe quantum wells of any crystallographic orientation, including (110) and (111) wells, where bulk and interface inversion asymmetries do not induce the anticrossing of zero-mode Landau levels.

Title: Plasmonic detection of Rashba spin-orbit coupling in monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides
Authors: Y. Li, Z. H. Tao, Y. M. Xiao, W. Xu, Q. N. Li, F. M. Peeters, D. Neilson, M. V. Milosevic
Abstract: Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) induces strong momentum-dependent spin splitting and plays a crucial role in fields like spintronics and topological photonics. We here theoretically investigate the collective excitations in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (ML-TMDs) hosting RSOC, and conceive an approach to precisely quantify the strength of RSOC using plasmons. We determine the electron energy loss function (EELF) and plasmon dispersions for n-type ML-TMD from the dynamic dielectric function in the framework of the standard random phase approximation (RPA). In this system, both optical and acoustic plasmon modes are observed in the EELF and plasmon dispersions. Moreover, the plasmonic and spectral properties are tunable by electron density and dependent on RSOC. Crucially, we identify a minimum energy gap between the two plasmon modes to serve as a direct spectral signature of the RSOC strength. These results establish plasmons as a non-invasive, precise, and broadly tunable technique for determining RSOC in TMD van der Waals heterostructures and devices.

Title: Monolayer Two-dimensional Materials Database (ML2DDB) and Applications
Authors: Zhongwei Liu, Zhimin Zhang, Xuwei Liu, Mingjia Yao, Xin He, Yuanhui Sun, Xin Chen, Lijun Zhang
Abstract: The discovery of two-dimensional (2D) materials with tailored properties is critical to meet the increasing demands of high-performance applications across flexible electronics, optoelectronics, catalysis, and energy storage. However, current 2D material databases are constrained by limited scale and compositional diversity. In this study, we introduce a scalable active learning workflow that integrates deep neural networks with density functional theory (DFT) calculations to efficiently explore a vast set of candidate structures. These structures are generated through physics-informed elemental substitution strategies, enabling broad and systematic discovery of stable 2D materials. Through six iterative screening cycles, we established the creation of the Monolayer 2D Materials Database (ML2DDB), which contains 242,546 DFT-validated stable structures-an order-of-magnitude increase over the largest known 2D materials databases. In particular, the number of ternary and quaternary compounds showed the most significant increase. Combining this database with a generative diffusion model, we demonstrated effective structure generation under specified chemistry and symmetry constraints. This work accomplished an organically interconnected loop of 2D material data expansion and application, which provides a new paradigm for the discovery of new materials.

Title: Unveiling the impact of trivalent metal cation transmutation on Cs$_{2}$AgM(III)Cl$_{6}$ double perovskites using many-body perturbation theory
Authors: Surajit Adhikari, Priya Johari
Abstract: Lead-free halide double perovskites A$_{2}$M(I)M(III)X$_{6}$ have garnered significant attention in the past decade as promising alternatives to CsPbX$_{3}$ perovskites, addressing concerns related to lead toxicity and material instability. In this work, we employ a trivalent metal cation transmutation strategy to design a series of inorganic Pb-free halide double perovskites Cs$_{2}$AgM(III)Cl$_{6}$ and perform a comprehensive investigation into their potential for applications in optoelectronic devices. Our first-principles calculations, rooted in density functional theory, demonstrate that these materials possess a face-centered cubic lattice structure while showcasing remarkable thermodynamic, dynamical, and mechanical stability. The G$_{0}$W$_{0}$@PBE electronic bandgap ranges from 1.47-6.20 eV, while the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) indicates strong optical absorption spanning near-infrared to ultraviolet regions for these compounds. Furthermore, the excitonic properties suggest that these perovskites exhibit intermediate exciton binding energies (0.17 to 0.60 eV) and generally longer exciton lifetimes, except for the materials with M(III) = Sc, Y, Tb, and Lu. The Fröhlich model indicates that these materials exhibit intermediate to strong carrier-phonon interactions, with hole-phonon coupling more prominent than electron-phonon coupling. Interestingly, the charge-separated polaronic states are found to be less stable than the bound exciton states, with higher polaron mobility for electrons (4.92-29.03 cm$^{2}$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$) than for holes (0.56-8.69 cm$^{2}$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$) in these materials. Overall, our study demonstrates that trivalent metal cation transmutation in Cs$_{2}$AgM(III)Cl$_{6}$ enables the creation of stable and lead-free halide double perovskites with exceptional, tunable optoelectronic properties, making them ideal for flexible optoelectronic applications.

Title: High pressure synthesis and structural study of AuGa2 intermetallic compound
Authors: Azkar Saeed Ahmad, Zhuoyang Yu, Sizhe Wang, Tong Weng, Wenting Lu, Baihong Sun, Jiewu Song, Qian Zhang, Martin Kunz, Bihan Wang, Elissaios Stavrou
Abstract: We report the synthesis of the AuGa2 intermetallic compound, using a direct reaction of the relevant elements at room temperature and at very low pressure. The pressure needed to synthesize the AuGa2 compound is below 1 GPa, that is at the lower limit of modern large volume presses, routinely used to synthesize other commercially available materials. This study presents a new method of synthesizing AuGa2, which is much more cost efficient and environmentally friendly than the previously used high-temperature synthesis techniques, and will open new possibilities of synthesizing other intermetallic compounds using high-pressure athermal techniques.

Title: Ab-initio-NEGF Fundamental Roadmap for Carbon-Nanotube and Two-Dimensional-Material MOSFETs at the Scaling and VDD Limit
Authors: Aryan Afzalian
Abstract: Using accurate Hybrid-Functional DFT coupled with the Non-Equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism, we explore and benchmark the fundamental scaling limits of CNT-FETs against Si and 2D-material MoS$_2$ and HfS$_2$ Nanosheets, highlighting their potential for gate length (L) and supply voltage (VDD) scaling down to 5 nm and to 0.5 V, respectively. The highest drive current is achieved by CNT-FETs with sub 1.3 nm diameters down to $L = 9$ nm and using VDD in the 0.45-0.5V range. Below $L = 9$ nm, however, the HfS$_2$ NS offers the best drive and could further scale down to $L = 5$ nm with a reduced VDD of 0.5 V.

Title: Structural, dielectric, and ferroelectric characteristics of the low-temperature sintered 65PMN-35PT sample for electroceramic applications
Authors: B. Ramachandran, N. Sudarshan, G. Mangamma, M.S. Ramachandra Rao
Abstract: A single-phase 65PMN-35PT ceramic was synthesized at a relatively low temperature (875 oC) using a modified columbite method. X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the single-phase formation of perovskite 65PMN-35PT with a tetragonal structure. Morphological studies indicated that the sample consisted of small grains with a size of about 2 micro-m. The dielectric properties of the material demonstrate its relaxor behavior near the ferroelectric transition temperature, TC = 457 K. The saturation and remnant polarization values of approximately 25.9 and 20.1 micro-C cm-2 were achieved for an electrically poled sample. Additionally, the poling induced a negative internal electric field of about -0.2 kV cm-1 was detected due to the presence of ferroelectric nano-grains in this bulk 65PMN-35PT sample. These observed characteristics of the pyrochlore-free 65PMN-35PT ceramic are similar to those of its single-crystal counterpart.

Title: Generalization performance of narrow one-hidden layer networks in the teacher-student setting
Authors: Jean Barbier, Federica Gerace, Alessandro Ingrosso, Clarissa Lauditi, Enrico M. Malatesta, Gibbs Nwemadji, Rodrigo Pérez Ortiz
Abstract: Understanding the generalization abilities of neural networks for simple input-output distributions is crucial to account for their learning performance on real datasets. The classical teacher-student setting, where a network is trained from data obtained thanks to a label-generating teacher model, serves as a perfect theoretical test bed. In this context, a complete theoretical account of the performance of fully connected one-hidden layer networks in the presence of generic activation functions is lacking. In this work, we develop such a general theory for narrow networks, i.e. networks with a large number of hidden units, yet much smaller than the input dimension. Using methods from statistical physics, we provide closed-form expressions for the typical performance of both finite temperature (Bayesian) and empirical risk minimization estimators, in terms of a small number of weight statistics. In doing so, we highlight the presence of a transition where hidden neurons specialize when the number of samples is sufficiently large and proportional to the number of parameters of the network. Our theory accurately predicts the generalization error of neural networks trained on regression or classification tasks with either noisy full-batch gradient descent (Langevin dynamics) or full-batch gradient descent.

Title: Classifying soft elastic lattices using higher-order homogenization
Authors: Basile Audoly, Claire Lestringant, Hussein Nassar
Abstract: We propose a methodology for the homogenization of periodic elastic lattices that covers the case of unstable lattices, having affine (macroscopic) or periodic (microscopic) mechanisms. The singular cell problems that are encountered when a periodic mechanism is present are naturally solved by treating the amplitude $\theta(X)$ of the mechanism as an enrichment variable. We use asymptotic second-order homogenization to derive an effective energy capturing both the strain-gradient effect $\nabla \varepsilon$ relevant to affine mechanisms, and the $\nabla \theta$ regularization relevant to periodic mechanisms, if any is present. The proposed approach is illustrated with a selection of lattices displaying a variety of effective behaviors. It follows a unified pattern that leads to a classification of these effective behaviors.

Title: Disorder induced dynamical interband response in Dirac nodal line semimetals
Authors: Vivek Pandey, Pankaj Bhalla
Abstract: To obtain the total response of the system, the effect of disorder cannot be neglected, as it introduces a new contribution (i.e. extrinsic) in the total response of the system. In the study of dynamical (AC) effects, the interband response exhibits an exotic resonance peak due to interband transitions. Here, the dynamical interband response of Dirac nodal line semimetal is investigated by using the quantum kinetic approach. The scattering driven effect is analyzed under the first-order Born approximation (i.e., in the weak disorder limit) and reveals a resonance peak at $2\tilde{\mu}$. In contrast, the field driven intrinsic response peak depends on both the mass ($\tilde{M}$) and chemical potential ($\tilde{\mu}$). The results indicate that the total interband response of the 3D nodal line semimetals, is mainly dominated by the disorder induced contributions.

Title: Conformational properties of strictly two-dimensional equilibrium polymers
Authors: J.P. Wittmer, A. Cavallo, A. Johner
Abstract: Two-dimensional monodisperse linear polymer chains are known to adopt for sufficiently large chain lengths $N$ and surface fractions $\phi$ compact configurations with fractal perimeters. We show here by means of Monte Carlo simulations of reversibly connected hard disks (without branching, ring formation and chain intersection) that polydisperse self-assembled equilibrium polymers with a finite scission energy $E$ are characterized by the same universal exponents as their monodisperse peers. Consistently with a Flory-Huggins mean-field approximation, the polydispersity is characterized by a Schulz-Zimm distribution with a susceptibility exponent $\gamma=19/16$ for all not dilute systems and the average chain length $<N> \propto \exp(\delta E) \phi^{\alpha}$ thus increases with an exponent $\delta = 16/35$. Moreover, it is shown that $\alpha=3/5$ for semidilute solutions and $\alpha \approx 1$ for larger densities. The intermolecular form factor $F(q)$ reveals for sufficiently large $<N>$ a generalized Porod scattering with $F(q) \propto 1/q^{11/4}$ for intermediate wavenumbers $q$ consistently with a fractal perimeter dimension $d_s=5/4$.

Title: Twist-Tunable Spin-to-Charge Conversion and Valley-Contrasting Effects in Graphene/TMDC Heterostructures
Authors: I. Wojciechowska, A. Dyrdal
Abstract: We consider graphene deposited on monolayers of such transition-metal dichalcogenides like MoSe$_2$, WSe$_2$, MoS$_2$, and WS$_2$. Our key objective is to study the impact of relative twist angle between the monolayers on the proximity-induced spin-orbital effects and orbital phenomena in graphene. To do this we used an effective model Hamiltonian for low-energy states, taken from available literature. The Green function formalism is used to calculate analytical formula for the spin Hall effect and nonequilibrium spin polarization in the system. We also determine the valley Hall and valley polarization effects, and their dependence on the twist angle. We have shown that the valley Hall conductivity can take the quantized value equal to $\pm 2 e^2/h$.

Title: Creep failure in heterogeneous materials from the barrier landscape
Authors: Juan Carlos Verano-Espitia, Tero Mäkinen, Mikko J. Alava, Jérôme Weiss
Abstract: Stressed under a constant load, materials creep with a final acceleration of deformation and for any given applied stress and material, the creep failure time can strongly vary. We investigate creep on sheets of paper and confront the statistics with a simple fiber bundle model of creep failure in a disordered landscape. In the experiments, acoustic emission event times $t_j$ were recorded, and both this data and simulation event series reveal sample-dependent history effects with log-normal statistics and non-Markovian behavior. This leads to a relationship between $t_j$ and the failure time $t_f$ with a power law relationship, evolving with time. These effects and the predictability result from how the energy gap distribution develops during creep.

Title: Testing the spin-bath view of self-attention: A Hamiltonian analysis of GPT-2 Transformer
Authors: Satadeep Bhattacharjee, Seung-Cheol Lee
Abstract: The recently proposed physics-based framework by Huo and Johnson~\cite{huo2024capturing} models the attention mechanism of Large Language Models (LLMs) as an interacting two-body spin system, offering a first-principles explanation for phenomena like repetition and bias. Building on this hypothesis, we extract the complete Query-Key weight matrices from a production-grade GPT-2 model and derive the corresponding effective Hamiltonian for every attention head. From these Hamiltonians we obtain analytic \textit{phase boundaries} logit gap criteria that predict which token should dominate the next-token distribution for a given context. A systematic evaluation on 144 heads across 20 factual-recall prompts reveals a strong negative correlation between the theoretical logit gaps and the model's empirical token rankings ($r\approx-0.70$, $p<10^{-3}$).Targeted ablations further show that suppressing the heads most aligned with the spin-bath predictions induces the anticipated shifts in output probabilities, confirming a causal link rather than a coincidental association. Taken together, our findings provide the first strong empirical evidence for the spin-bath analogy in a production-grade model. This validation not only furnishes a tractable, physics-inspired lens for interpretability but also provides the groundwork for novel generative models, bridging the gap between theoretical condensed matter physics and AI.

Title: Structural Order Drives Diffusion in a Granular Packing
Authors: David Luce, Adrien Gans, Sébastien Kiesgen de Richter, Nicolas Vandewalle
Abstract: We investigate how structural ordering, i.e. crystallization, affects the flow of bidisperse granular materials in a quasi-two-dimensional silo. By systematically varying the mass fraction of two particle sizes, we finely tune the degree of local order. Using high-speed imaging and kinematic modeling, we show that crystallization significantly enhances the diffusion length $b$, a key parameter controlling the velocity profiles within the flowing medium. We reveal a strong correlation between $b$ and the hexatic order parameter $\left<|\psi_6|\right>_t$, highlighting the role of local structural organization in governing macroscopic flow behavior. Furthermore, we demonstrate that pressure gradients within the silo promote the stabilization of orientational order even in the absence of crystallization, thus intrinsically increasing $b$ with height. These findings establish a direct link between microstructural order, pressure, and transport properties in granular silo flows.

Title: A fast algorithm for 2D Rigidity Percolation
Authors: Nina Javerzat, Daniele Notarmuzi
Abstract: Rigidity Percolation is a crucial framework for describing rigidity transitions in amorphous systems. We present a new, efficient algorithm to study central-force Rigidity Percolation in two dimensions. This algorithm combines the Pebble Game algorithm, the Newman-Ziff approach to Connectivity Percolation, as well as novel rigorous results in rigidity theory, to exactly identify rigid clusters over the full bond concentration range, in a time that scales as $N^{1.02}$ for a system of $N$ nodes. Besides opening the way to accurate numerical studies of Rigidity Percolation, our work provides new insights on specific cluster merging mechanisms that distinguish it from the standard Connectivity Percolation problem.

Title: Reshaping the anomalous Hall response in tilted 3D system with disorder correction
Authors: Vivek Pandey, Pankaj Bhalla
Abstract: The anomalous Hall conductivity in the nodal line semimetals (NLSMs) due to the presence of a symmetry-protected nodal ring adds complexity in the investigation of their transport properties. By employing quantum kinetic theory and considering the weak disorder limit, we analyze the intraband and interband parts of anomalous Hall conductivity in the tilted 3D Dirac NLSMs. Our findings reveal that the net anomalous response is mainly contributed by the interband part. Further, the latter part gives non zero results by breaking inversion symmetry via tilt. We observe that the competition between the tilt and the chemical potential emerges kinks at distinct characteristic frequencies in the intrinsic interband part of the anomalous conductivity. On the other hand, the disorder driven interband component of the conductivity exhibits a prominent peak at low chemical potential, followed by a sign change. Notably, the disorder or extrinsic contribution to the response dominates over the intrinsic interband contribution, making it a crucial factor for the study of the overall response of a three-dimensional system.

Title: The interplay of ferroelectricity and magneto-transport in non-magnetic moiré superlattices
Authors: Siqi Jiang, Renjun Du, Jiawei Jiang, Gan Liu, Jiabei Huang, Yu Du, Yaqing Han, Jingkuan Xiao, Di Zhang, Fuzhuo Lian, Wanting Xu, Siqin Wang, Lei Qiao, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Xiaoxiang Xi, Wei Ren, Baigeng Wang, Alexander S. Mayorov, Kai Chang, Hongxin Yang, Lei Wang, Geliang Yu
Abstract: The coupling of ferroelectricity and magnetic order provides rich tunability for engineering material properties and demonstrates great potential for uncovering novel quantum phenomena and multifunctional devices. Here, we report interfacial ferroelectricity in moiré superlattices constructed from graphene and hexagonal boron nitride. We observe ferroelectric polarization in an across-layer moiré superlattice with an intercalated layer, demonstrating a remnant polarization comparable to its non-intercalated counterpart. Remarkably, we reveal a magnetic-field enhancement of ferroelectric polarization that persists up to room temperature, showcasing an unconventional amplification of ferroelectricity in materials lacking magnetic elements. This phenomenon, consistent across devices with varying layer configurations, arises purely from electronic rather than ionic contributions. Furthermore, the ferroelectric polarization in turn modulates quantum transport characteristics, suppressing Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations and altering quantum Hall states in polarized phases. This interplay between ferroelectricity and magneto-transport in non-magnetic materials is crucial for exploring magnetoelectric effects and advancing two-dimensional memory and logic applications.

Title: Versatile multi-q antiferromagnetic charge order in correlated vdW metals

Abstract: Following the discovery of graphene, interest in van der Waals (vdW) materials has surged; yet, advancing "beyond graphene" physics requires the development of quantum material platforms that host versatile many-body states. Using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy at 300 mK, we uncover two competing states in vdW metal CeTe3: charge-ordered in-plane antiferromagnetic phases forming stripe and checkerboard patterns. Remarkably, the competition between them is tuned through a modest in-plane magnetic field (approximately 1.5 T), revealing significant cooperative phenomena between frustrated antiferromagnetism, charge order, and competing Fermi surface nesting. Underlying strongly intertwined many-body states are consistently signaled by density of states deformations exceeding plus/minus 30 meV scale across the Fermi level. Our findings provide a promising correlated vdW platform hosting versatile two-dimensional many-body physics, offering a fertile ground to explore topologically nontrivial multi-q charge-ordered antiferromagnetism, quantum criticality, unconventional superconductivity, and their potential interconnections.

Title: Equilibrium distribution of the liquid phase in an unsaturated granular material
Authors: Lazar Loredana, Clavaud Cécile, Amon Axelle
Abstract: In an unsaturated granular material, the spatial distribution of the liquid phase results from the competition between gravity and capillary forces. We show that, in the funicular regime, it can be described by a Boltzmann law, with static disorder playing the role of thermal agitation. We propose an approach based on a Langevin equation to derive this distribution, and compare our predictions with conductivity measurements giving the local water content as a function of height in a wet granular medium. We show that experimental data obtained with samples of different polydispersities collapse on a single master curve consistent with our model.

Title: Decomposition of general grain boundaries
Authors: Wei Wan, Junwen Deng, Changxin Tang
Abstract: As a central part of microstructure evolution, grain boundary (GB) migration is believed to be both monolithic and unidirectional. But here, we introduce the concept of GB decomposition: one GB separates into two new GBs by controlling the Peach-Koehler forces on its disconnections. Molecular dynamics simulation is used to reveal the disconnection mechanisms and direction-dependent motion behaviors associated with the reversible decomposition of a nickel {\Sigma}7 general GB. We also observed a decomposition-like process in a high-energy diffraction microscopy (HEDM) dataset of high purity nickel polycrystal (Science 2021, 374, 189-193), and performed HEDM-data-based simulation to confirm it. The decomposition should be considered as a new GB migration behavior, based on its particularity and potential universality.

Title: Robust Ferroelectricity in Silicon Dioxide upon Intercalation of Ammonia
Authors: Yaxin Gao, Menghao Wu, Jun-Ming Liu
Abstract: The nanoelectronic applications of current ferroelectrics have been greatly impeded by their incompatibility with silicon. In this paper we propose a way to induce ferroelectricity in silicon dioxide (SiO2), which is still the most widely used dielectric material in silicon-based chips. We show first-principles evidence that the intercalation of NH3 molecules into crystalline SiO2 is exothermic, where NH3 molecules form quasi-bonds with SiO2, giving rise to large and robust polarizations. In general, such polarization can be reversed via the reformation of N-Si bondings, which is multiaxial so vertical ferroelectricity may emerge in their thin-films of any facets. When the applied external electric field is large enough, however, the system may exhibit unconventional quantized ferroelectricity of unprecedented magnitude, where NH3 may migrate for multiple lattice constants like mobile ions in ion conductors. Compared with ion conductors with charged mobile ions and ion vacancies that may lead to current leakage, herein the intercalated systems can be denoted as neutral ion conductors where both pristine SiO2 and SiO2 filled with NH3 are insulating. Similar ferroelectricity may exist in various SiO2 crystalline polymorphs, its amorphous phase, and other porous structures intercalated by NH3. Our findings may not only resolve the bottleneck issues for the compatibility of ferroelectrics and silicon, but also develop unconventional mechanisms of ferroelectricity.

Title: Cascade of Modal Interactions in Nanomechanical Resonators with Soft Clamping
Authors: Zichao Li, Minxing Xu, Richard A. Norte, Alejandro M. Aragón, Peter G. Steeneken, Farbod Alijani
Abstract: Cascades of dynamical phenomena, where energy and motion transfer across coupled degrees of freedom, underlie complex behavior in physical systems spanning multiple time and length scales. Here, we demonstrate that soft-clamping techniques commonly employed to enhance the quality factor of nanomechanical resonators, can also be harnessed to engineer cascaded energy transfer conditions, enabling the sequential excitation of an increasing number of coupled vibrational modes during frequency sweeps. Using Si3N4 nanostrings with soft-clamping supports, we identify the conditions for mode coupling and obtain interactions among five flexural resonances , achieving a quasi-constant amplitude of the targeted resonant response over a broad frequency range. Analytical and nonlinear reduced-order models reveal that soft clamping can not only facilitate a sequence of interactions, but also amplify the geometric nonlinearity of the driven mode, enhancing effective spring hardening by more than an order of magnitude through dispersive couplings. This ability to activate and control energy flow in nanomechanical systems offers a strategy for realizing programmable nonlinear dynamics for next-generation resonators.

Title: Adsorbate-induced formation of a surface-polarity-driven nonperiodic superstructure
Authors: Chi Ming Yim, Yu Zheng, Olivia R. Armitage, Dibyashree Chakraborti, Craig J. Wells, Seunghyun Khim, Andrew P. Mackenzie, Peter Wahl
Abstract: The chemical and electronic properties of surfaces and interfaces are important for many technologically relevant processes, be it in information processing, where interfacial electronic properties are crucial for device performance, or in catalytic processes, which depend on the types and densities of active nucleation sites for chemical reactions. Quasi-periodic and nonperiodic crystalline surfaces offer new opportunities because of their inherent inhomogeneity, resulting in localisation and properties vastly different from those of surfaces described by conventional Bravais lattices. Here, we demonstrate the formation of a nonperiodic tiling structure on the surface of the frustrated antiferromagnet PdCrO2 due to hydrogen adsorption. The tiling structure exhibits no long-range periodicity but comprises few-atom hexagonally packed domains covering large terraces. Measurement of the local density of states by tunnelling spectroscopy reveals adsorption-driven modifications to the quasi-2D electronic structure of the surface layer, showing exciting opportunities arising from electron localisation.

Title: Spontaneous emergence of altermagnetism in the single-orbital extended Hubbard model
Authors: Jin-Wei Dong, Yu-Han Lin, Ruiqing Fu, Xianxin Wu, Gang Su, Ziqiang Wang, Sen Zhou
Abstract: Altermagnetism (AM), the recently discovered third class of collinear magnetic order, is characterized by non-relativistic momentum-dependent spin-split electronic structure with compensated zero net magnetization. It can arise from the conventional antiferromagnetism by introducing local anisotropy on the two opposite-spin sublattices, either through structural changes in local crystallographic symmetry or spontaneous emergence of local staggered orbital order from electron correlations in multi-orbital systems. Here, we demonstrate on the two-dimensional square lattice that a $d$-wave AM can emerge spontaneously in the single-orbital extended Hubbard model, without invoking the spin-orbital coupling and multi-orbital physics. We carry out mean-field studies on the concrete single-orbital $t$-$U$-$V$ model with $U$ and $V$ the onsite and nearest-neighbor Coulomb interactions, obtaining the ground states, analyzing their properties, and determining the phase diagram in the $U$-$V$ plane. The $d$-wave AM with novel spin-transport behavior is found to be stabilized in a wide region of the phase diagram when the system is doped away from half-filling, actualized by the coexistence of onsite antiferromagnetic order and complex $d$-wave nearest-neighbor spin bond orders. Our findings provide an alternative route to achieve AM and substantially expand the range of candidate AM materials.

Title: Quantum state transfer and maximal entanglement between distant qubits using a minimal quasicrystal pump
Authors: Arnob Kumar Ghosh, Rubén Seoane Souto, Vahid Azimi-Mousolou, Annica M. Black-Schaffer, Patric Holmvall
Abstract: Coherent quantum state transfer over macroscopic distances between non-neighboring elements in quantum circuits is a crucial component to increase connectivity and simplify quantum information processing. To facilitate such transfers, an efficient and easily controllable quantum pump would be highly beneficial. In this work, we demonstrate such a quantum pump based on a one-dimensional quasicrystal Fibonacci chain (FC). In particular, we utilize the unique properties of quasicrystals to pump the edge-localized winding states between the two distant ends of the chain by only minimal manipulation of the FC at its end points. We establish the necessary conditions for successful state transfer within a fully time-dependent picture and also demonstrate robustness of the transfer protocol against disorder. We then couple external qubits to each end of the FC and establish highly adaptable functionality as a quantum bus with both on-demand switching of the qubit states and generation of maximally entangled Bell states between the qubits. Thanks to the minimal control parameters, the setup is well-suited for implementation across diverse experimental platforms, thus establishing quasicrystals as an efficient platform for versatile quantum information processing.

Title: Higher-order bulk photovoltaic effects, quantum geometry and application to $p$-wave magnets
Authors: Motohiko Ezawa
Abstract: The injection and shift currents are generalized to the $\ell $th-order injection and shift currents for the longitudinal conductivities in the two-band model, where $\ell $ is the power of the applied electric field. In addition, the formulas for the higher-order injection current are expressed in terms of the quantum metric and the higher-order shift current in terms of the higher-order quantum connection. Then, they are applied to $p$-wave magnets. It is shown that the injection and shift currents are zero. On the other hand, the $\ell $th-order injection and shift currents with odd $\ell $ are nonzero when the direction of the Néel vector of the $p$-wave magnet points to an in-plane direction.

Title: Microscopic evidence for Fulde-Ferrel-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state and multiband effects in KFe$_2$As$_2$
Authors: X. Y. Liu, Z. Kao, J. Luo, J. Yang, A. F. Fang, J. Zhao, R. Zhou, Guo-qing Zheng
Abstract: The Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state is a superconducting phase characterized by broken translational-symmetry, where Cooper pairs form with non-zero momentum between Zeeman-split Fermi surfaces. This state is highly sensitive to band structure and pairing symmetry. In multiband superconductors, the FFLO state can significantly deviate from its standard form, but experimental verification has remained challenging. Here, we present $^{75}$As nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements on the multiband superconductor KFe$_2$As$_2$. In the low-temperature, high-magnetic-field region above the upper critical field $B_{c2}$, we observe a clear increase in the second moment of the NMR spectrum, along with a strong enhancement in the spin-lattice relaxation rate divided by temperature 1/$T_1$$T$. These results indicate an emergence of superconducting spin smecticity and Andreev bound states from the spatially modulation of the superconducting gap, providing microscopic evidence for the FFLO state. The obtained phase diagram reveals a distinct boundary line between the FFLO and homogenous superconducting (HSC) states with a low critical temperature of the FFLO state $T^\ast \approx 0.2 T_c$, which can be attributed to the multiband effects in KFe$_2$As$_2$. Our results show that the iron-based superconductors are a good material platform for studying the FFLO state and highlight the importance of the multiband effects on this exotic phase.

Title: Diffusion of acceptor dopants in monoclinic $β$-Ga$_2$O$_3$
Authors: Channyung Lee, Michael A. Scarpulla, Elif Ertekin, Joel B. Varley
Abstract: $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ is a leading ultra-wide band gap semiconductor, but its performance depends on precise control over dopant incorporation and stability. In this work, we use first-principles calculations to systematically assess the diffusion behavior of eight potential deep-level substitutional acceptors (Au, Ca, Co, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, and Ni) in $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$. We consider two key diffusion mechanisms: (i) interstitial diffusion under non-equilibrium conditions relevant to ion implantation, and (ii) trap-limited diffusion (TLD) under near-equilibrium thermal annealing conditions. Our results reveal a strong diffusion anisotropy along the b and c axes, with dopant behavior governed by competition between diffusion and incorporation (or dissociation) activation energies. Under interstitial diffusion, Ca$^{2+}_{\text{i}}$ and Mg$^{2+}_{\text{i}}$ show the most favorable combination of low migration and incorporation barriers, making them promising candidates for efficient doping along the b and c axes, respectively. In contrast, Au$^{+}_{\text{i}}$ diffuses readily, but exhibits an incorporation barrier that exceeds 5 eV, rendering it ineffective as a dopant. From a thermal stability perspective, Co$^{2+}_{\text{i}}$ shows poor activation but high diffusion barriers, which may suppress undesirable migration at elevated temperatures. Under trap-limited diffusion, the dissociation of dopant-host complexes controls mobility. Mg$^{2+}_{\text{i}}$ again emerges as a leading candidate, exhibiting the lowest dissociation barriers along both axes, whereas Co$^{2+}_{\text{i}}$ and Fe$^{2+}_{\text{i}}$ display the highest barriers, suggesting improved dopant retention under thermal stress. Our findings guide dopant selection by balancing activation and thermal stability, essential for robust semi-insulating substrates.

Title: Quantum Hall Effect and Chern Phases in the 1/5-Depleted Square Lattice
Authors: Sara Aghtouman, Godfrey Gumbs, Mir Vahid Hosseini
Abstract: We investigate the fractional energy spectrum and quantum Hall response of a two-dimensional 1/5-depleted square lattice subjected to a perpendicular magnetic field. Using a tight-binding model that includes both nearest-neighbor (t_1) and next-nearest-neighbor (t_2) hopping, we compute the Hofstadter butterfly and extract quantized Hall conductivities via Chern number calculations. In the absence of diagonal hopping (t_2 =0), the spectrum exhibits exact particle-hole and flux-inversion symmetries, and the total Chern number across all bands vanishes. When t_2 is introduced, these symmetries are broken, the butterfly becomes deformed, new gaps open, and -remarkably-a nonzero total Chern sum can emerge, signaling unconventional topological phases. By systematically varying t_1 and t_2, we identify regimes with large individual Chern indices and parameter windows where gap stability and Hall plateaus are optimized. Our results demonstrated that lattice depletion combined with diagonal hopping provides a tunable route to engineer robust Chern insulators in both artificial and oxide-based square-lattice systems.

Title: Scaling, Fractal Dynamics and Critical Exponents{: Application} in a non-integer dimensional Ising model
Authors: Henrique A. de Lima, Ismael S. S. Carrasco, Marcio Santos, Fernando A. Oliveira
Abstract: Moving beyond simple associations, researchers need tools to quantify how variables influence each other in space and time. Correlation functions provide a mathematical framework for characterizing these essential dependencies, revealing insights into causality, structure, and hidden patterns within complex systems. In physical systems with many degrees of freedom, such as gases, liquids, and solids, a statistical analysis of these correlations is essential. For a field $\Psi(\vec{x},t)$ that depends on spatial position $\vec{x}$ and time $t$, it is often necessary to understand the correlation with itself at another position and time $\Psi(\vec{x}_0,t_0)$. This specific function is called the autocorrelation function. In this context, the autocorrelation function for order--parameter fluctuations, introduced by Fisher, provides an important mathematical framework for understanding the second-order phase transition at equilibrium. However, his analysis is restricted to a Euclidean space of dimension $d$, and an exponent $\eta$ is introduced to correct the spatial behavior of the correlation function at $T=T_c$. In recent work, Lima et al demonstrated that at $T_c$ a fractal analysis is necessary for a complete description of the correlation function. In this study, we investigate the fundamental physics and mathematics underlying phase transitions. In particular, we show that the application of modern fractional differentials allows us to write down an equation for the correlation function that recovers the correct exponents below the upper critical dimension. We obtain the exact expression for the Fisher exponent $\eta$. Furthermore, we examine the Rushbrooke scaling relation, which has been questioned in certain magnetic systems, and, drawing on results from the Ising model, we confirm that both our relations and the Rushbrooke scaling law hold even when $d$ is not an integer.

Title: Development of an Atomic Layer Deposition System for Deposition of Alumina as a Hydrogen Permeation Barrier
Authors: Zachary R. Robinson, Jeffrey Woodward, Alexander C. Kozen, Joshua Ruby, Tyler Liao, Luke Herter, Rashad Ahmadov, Mark D. Wittman, Matthew Sharpe
Abstract: Tritium permeation into and through materials poses a critical challenge for the development of nuclear fusion reactors. Minimizing tritium permeation is essential for the safe and efficient use of available fuel supplies. In this work, we present the design, construction, and validation of custom atomic layer deposition (ALD) and deuterium permeation measurement systems aimed at developing thin-film hydrogen permeation barriers. Using the ALD system, we deposited conformal Al2O3 films on copper foil substrates and characterized their growth behavior, morphology, and composition. ALD growth rates of 1.1 angstrom/cycle were achieved for temperatures between 100 degrees C and 210 degrees C. Permeation measurements on bare and ALD-coated copper foils revealed a significant reduction in deuterium flux with the addition of a 10nm Al2O3 layer. While bare copper followed diffusion-limited transport consistent with Sievert's law, the ALD-coated samples exhibited surface-limited, pore-mediated transport with linear pressure dependence. Arrhenius analysis showed distinct differences in activation energy for the two transport regimes, and permeation reduction factors (PRFs) exceeding an order of magnitude were observed. These results demonstrate the potential of ALD-grown Al2O3 films as effective hydrogen isotope barriers and provide a foundation for future studies on film optimization and integration into fusion-relevant components.

Title: Suppression of shot noise at a Kondo destruction quantum critical point
Authors: Yiming Wang, Shouvik Sur, Fang Xie, Haoyu Hu, Silke Paschen, Douglas Natelson, Qimiao Si
Abstract: Strange metal behavior has been observed in an expanding list of quantum materials, with heavy fermion metals serving as a prototype setting. Among the intriguing questions is the nature of charge carriers; there is an increasing recognition that the quasiparticles are lost, as captured by Kondo destruction quantum criticality. Among the recent experimental advances is the measurement of shot noise in a heavy-fermion strange metal. We are thus motivated to study current fluctuations by advancing a minimal Bose-Fermi Kondo lattice model, which admits a well-defined large-$N$ limit. Showing that the model in equilibrium captures the essential physics of Kondo destruction, we proceed to derive quantum kinetic equations and compute shot noise to the leading nontrivial order in $1/N$. Our results reveal a strong suppression of the shot noise at the Kondo destruction quantum critical point, thereby providing the understanding of the striking experiment. Broader implications of our results are discussed.

Title: Ultrafast electron heating as the dominant driving force of photoinduced terahertz spin currents
Authors: Reza Rouzegar, Pilar Jimenez-Cavero, Oliver Gueckstock, Mohamed Amine Wahada, Quentin Remy, Irene Lucas, Gerhard Jacob, Mathias Kläui, Michel Hehn, Georg Woltersdorf, Tobias Kampfrath, Tom. S. Seifert
Abstract: Ultrafast spintronics strongly relies on the generation, transport, manipulation and detection of terahertz spin currents (TSCs). In F|HM stacks consisting of a ferromagnetic layer F and a heavy-metal layer HM, ultrafast spin currents are typically triggered by femtosecond optical laser pulses. A key open question is whether the initial step, optical excitation and injection of spin currents, can be controlled by tuning the photon energy of the femtosecond pulse. While many theoretical works suggest a marked impact of photon-energy and of highly excited non-thermal electrons, profound experimental evidence is lacking. Here, we use terahertz-emission spectroscopy to study TSCs triggered with two different photon energies of 1.5 eV and 3 eV. We study a wide range of magnetic systems covering metallic ferromagnets, ferrimagnetic insulators, half-metals, as well as systems including tunneling barriers, and rare-earth metallic alloys. We find that variation of the exciting photon energy does not change the dynamics and only slightly the amplitude of the induced TSC in all sample systems. Our results reveal that the ultrafast pump-induced heating of electrons is a highly efficient process for generating TSCs, whereas highly excited primary photoelectrons are of minor importance.

Title: Orbital Hall Effect and Angular Momentum Dynamics in Confined Geometries
Authors: Egor I. Kiselev, Benoît Douçot, Roderich Moessner
Abstract: We present an analysis of the orbital Hall effect (OHE) in a strip geometry and derive a formula for the orbital angular momentum (OAM) accumulation at the edges. The result is expressed in terms of band structure parameters and scattering rates, providing a link between experimental observations of the OHE and the underlying microscopics. A key result is that the effective OAM decay rate follows a Dykonov-Perel-like scaling and is inversely proportional to the electron scattering rate, even if the latter is small. Furthermore, investigating OAM transport in an inhomogeneous setting, we show that non-Ohmic flows and spatially varying electric fields result in contributions to the OHE which are distinct from the well known intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms.

Title: Quantum Carpets of Higgs particles in a Supersolid
Authors: Koushik Mukherjee, Malte Schubert, Ralf Klemt, Thomas Bland, Tilman Pfau, Stephanie Reimann
Abstract: Supersolids formed from dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) exhibit spontaneous density modulation while maintaining global phase coherence. This state of matter supports gapped amplitude (Higgs) excitations featuring a quadratic dispersion relation. While Higgs modes are typically strongly damped due to coupling with other amplitude and phase modes, imposing an experimentally realistic toroidal geometry allows us to numerically study the time evolution and dispersion of a localized Higgs quasiparticle excitation, with minimal residual coupling to sound modes. Strikingly, the quadratic dispersion leads to the occurrence of (fractional) revivals, similar to those seen in the optical Talbot effect or the so-called quantum carpets. The revival times provide a novel method for determining the effective mass of the Higgs particle through a non-spectroscopic approach. These results pave the way for further studies of coherent Higgs dynamics and mutual interactions between Higgs particles.

Title: Charge pumps, pivot Hamiltonians and symmetry-protected topological phases
Authors: Nick. G. Jones, Ryan Thorngren, Ruben Verresen, Abhishodh Prakash
Abstract: Generalised charge pumps are topological obstructions to trivialising loops in the space of symmetric gapped Hamiltonians. We show that given mild conditions on such pumps, the associated loop has high-symmetry points which must be in distinct symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. To further elucidate the connection between pumps and SPTs, we focus on closed paths, `pivot loops', defined by two Hamiltonians, where the first is unitarily evolved by the second `pivot' Hamiltonian. While such pivot loops have been studied as entanglers for SPTs, here we explore their connection to pumps. We construct families of pivot loops which pump charge for various symmetry groups, often leading to SPT phases -- including dipole SPTs. Intriguingly, we find examples where non-trivial pumps do not lead to genuine SPTs but still entangle representation-SPTs (RSPTs). We use the anomaly associated to the non-trivial pump to explain the a priori `unnecessary' criticality between these RSPTs. We also find that particularly nice pivot families form circles in Hamiltonian space, which we show is equivalent to the Hamiltonians satisfying the Dolan-Grady relation -- known from the study of integrable models. This additional structure allows us to derive more powerful constraints on the phase diagram. Natural examples of such circular loops arise from pivoting with the Onsager-integrable chiral clock models, containing the aforementioned RSPT example. In fact, we show that these Onsager pivots underlie general group cohomology-based pumps in one spatial dimension. Finally, we recast the above in the language of equivariant families of Hamiltonians and relate the invariants of the pump to the candidate SPTs. We also highlight how certain SPTs arise in cases where the equivariant family is labelled by spaces that are not manifolds.

Title: Beyond von Mises Truss Models: Emergent Bistability in Mechanical Metamaterials
Authors: Md Nahid Hasan, Taylor E. Greenwood, Sharat Paul, Bolei Deng, Qihan Liu, Yong Lin Kong, Pai Wang
Abstract: We observe and analyze the phenomenon of bistability emergent from cooperative stiffening in hyper-elastic metamaterials. Using experimental and numerical results of identical geometric designs, we show evidence that a single unit is unistable while combining two units can result in bistability. Our study demonstrates that the von Mises truss model cannot describe such emergent behavior. Hence, we construct a novel and simple analytical model to explain this phenomenon.

Title: Microsecond-scale high-survival and number-resolved detection of ytterbium atom arrays
Authors: Alessandro Muzi Falconi, Riccardo Panza, Sara Sbernardori, Riccardo Forti, Ralf Klemt, Omar Abdel Karim, Matteo Marinelli, Francesco Scazza
Abstract: Scalable atom-based quantum platforms for simulation, computing, and metrology require fast high-fidelity, low-loss imaging of individual atoms. Standard fluorescence detection methods rely on continuous cooling, limiting the detection range to one atom and imposing long imaging times that constrain the experimental cycle and mid-circuit conditional operations. Here, we demonstrate fast and low-loss single-atom imaging in optical tweezers without active cooling, enabled by the favorable properties of ytterbium. Collecting fluorescence over microsecond timescales, we reach single-atom discrimination fidelities above 99.9% and single-shot survival probabilities above 99.5%. Through interleaved recooling pulses, as short as a few hundred microseconds for atoms in magic traps, we perform tens of consecutive detections with constant atom-retention probability per image - an essential step toward fast atom re-use in tweezer-based processors and clocks. Our scheme does not induce parity projection in multiply-occupied traps, enabling number-resolved single-shot detection of several atoms per site. This allows us to study the near-deterministic preparation of single atoms in tweezers driven by blue-detuned light-assisted collisions. Moreover, the near-diffraction-limited spatial resolution of our low-loss imaging enables number-resolved microscopy in dense arrays, opening the way to direct site-occupancy readout in optical lattices for density fluctuation and correlation measurements in quantum simulators.

Title: How do Probabilistic Graphical Models and Graph Neural Networks Look at Network Data?
Authors: Michela Lapenna, Caterina De Bacco
Abstract: Graphs are a powerful data structure for representing relational data and are widely used to describe complex real-world systems. Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can both leverage graph-structured data, but their inherent functioning is different. The question is how do they compare in capturing the information contained in networked datasets? We address this objective by solving a link prediction task and we conduct three main experiments, on both synthetic and real networks: one focuses on how PGMs and GNNs handle input features, while the other two investigate their robustness to noisy features and increasing heterophily of the graph. PGMs do not necessarily require features on nodes, while GNNs cannot exploit the network edges alone, and the choice of input features matters. We find that GNNs are outperformed by PGMs when input features are low-dimensional or noisy, mimicking many real scenarios where node attributes might be scalar or noisy. Then, we find that PGMs are more robust than GNNs when the heterophily of the graph is increased. Finally, to assess performance beyond prediction tasks, we also compare the two frameworks in terms of their computational complexity and interpretability.

Authors: Yeyong Yu, Xilei Bian, Jie Xiong, Xing Wu, Quan Qian
Abstract: With the growing demand for novel materials, machine learning-driven inverse design methods face significant challenges in reconciling the high-dimensional materials composition space with limited experimental data. Existing approaches suffer from two major limitations: (I) machine learning models often lack reliability in high-dimensional spaces, leading to prediction biases during the design process; (II) these models fail to effectively incorporate domain expert knowledge, limiting their capacity to support knowledge-guided inverse design. To address these challenges, we introduce AIMatDesign, a reinforcement learning framework that addresses these limitations by augmenting experimental data using difference-based algorithms to build a trusted experience pool, accelerating model convergence. To enhance model reliability, an automated refinement strategy guided by large language models (LLMs) dynamically corrects prediction inconsistencies, reinforcing alignment between reward signals and state value functions. Additionally, a knowledge-based reward function leverages expert domain rules to improve stability and efficiency during training. Our experiments demonstrate that AIMatDesign significantly surpasses traditional machine learning and reinforcement learning methods in discovery efficiency, convergence speed, and success rates. Among the numerous candidates proposed by AIMatDesign, experimental synthesis of representative Zr-based alloys yielded a top-performing BMG with 1.7GPa yield strength and 10.2\% elongation, closely matching predictions. Moreover, the framework accurately captured the trend of yield strength variation with composition, demonstrating its reliability and potential for closed-loop materials discovery.

Title: A collaborative digital twin built on FAIR data and compute infrastructure
Authors: Thomas M. Deucher, Juan C. Verduzco, Michael Titus, Alejandro Strachan
Abstract: The integration of machine learning with automated experimentation in self-driving laboratories (SDL) offers a powerful approach to accelerate discovery and optimization tasks in science and engineering applications. When supported by findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data infrastructure, SDLs with overlapping interests can collaborate more effectively. This work presents a distributed SDL implementation built on nanoHUB services for online simulation and FAIR data management. In this framework, geographically dispersed collaborators conducting independent optimization tasks contribute raw experimental data to a shared central database. These researchers can then benefit from analysis tools and machine learning models that automatically update as additional data become available. New data points are submitted through a simple web interface and automatically processed using a nanoHUB Sim2L, which extracts derived quantities and indexes all inputs and outputs in a FAIR data repository called ResultsDB. A separate nanoHUB workflow enables sequential optimization using active learning, where researchers define the optimization objective, and machine learning models are trained on-the-fly with all existing data, guiding the selection of future experiments. Inspired by the concept of ``frugal twin", the optimization task seeks to find the optimal recipe to combine food dyes to achieve the desired target color. With easily accessible and inexpensive materials, researchers and students can set up their own experiments, share data with collaborators, and explore the combination of FAIR data, predictive ML models, and sequential optimization. The tools introduced are generally applicable and can easily be extended to other optimization problems.

Title: Preparation of cat states in many-body eigenbasis via non-local measurement
Authors: Ruoyu Yin, Hongzheng Zhao
Abstract: Engineered dissipation offers a promising route to prepare correlated quantum many-body states that are otherwise difficult to access using purely unitary protocols. However, creating superpositions of multiple many-body eigenstates with tunable properties remains a major challenge. We propose to periodically interrupt the many-body evolution by precisely removing a given many-body Fock state through a non-local post-selected measurement protocol. Upon tuning the measurement period, we show that a dark state manifold survives the removal, allowing us to filter the system and generate a coherent superposition within this manifold at long times. As a testbed, we study a non-integrable spin-1 XY chain featuring a solvable family of eigenstates that can differ macroscopically in quasi-particle excitations. Our protocol generates tunable superpositions of these eigenstates, including the spin-1 Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state and a generalized variant with tunable spatiotemporal order. Under perturbations, the system exhibits an exceptionally long-lived metastable regime where the engineered superpositions remain robust. Our work provides new insight into quantum state preparation via non-local measurements using tools available in current quantum simulators.

Title: Earth's field diamond vector magnetometry with isotropic magnetic flux concentrators
Authors: Maziar Saleh Ziabari, Nazanin Mosavian, Ilja Fescenko, Yaser Silani, Bryan A. Richards, Andris Berzins, Maxwell D. Aiello, Keith A. Lidke, Andrey Jarmola, Janis Smits, Victor M. Acosta
Abstract: Vector magnetometers based on the optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) of nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond are being developed for applications such as navigation and geomagnetism. However, at low magnetic fields, such as that on Earth (~50 {\mu}T), diamond magnetometers suffer from spectral congestion whereby ODMR peaks are not easily resolved. Here, we experimentally investigate a potential solution of using an isotropic, three-dimensional magnetic flux concentrator to amplify Earth's field without altering its direction. The concentrator consists of six ferrite cones, in a face-centered cubic arrangement, centered about a diamond. We vary the direction of a 50 {\mu}T applied field and record and fit the resulting ODMR spectra. By comparing the fitted fields to those of a reference fluxgate magnetometer, we characterize the angular response of the diamond magnetometer and quantify absolute errors in the field magnitude and angle. We find that the enhancement factor is nearly isotropic, with a mean of 19.05 and a standard deviation of 0.16, when weighted by solid angle coverage. Gradient broadening of the ODMR lines is sufficiently small that the spectra are well resolved for nearly all field directions, alleviating spectral congestion. For ~98% of the total 4{\pi} solid angle, Cramér-Rao lower bounds for magnetic field estimation uncertainty are within a factor of 2 of those of the fully-resolved case, indicating minimal deadzones. We track the stability of the magnetometer over six hours and observe variations less than or approximately 40 nT/hour, limited by temperature drift. Our study presents a new route for diamond vector magnetometry at Earth's field, with potential applications in geomagnetic surveys, anomaly detection, and navigation.

Title: Nine circles of elastic brittle fracture: A series of challenge problems to assess fracture models
Authors: Farhad Kamarei, Bo Zheng, John E. Dolbow, Oscar Lopez-Pamies
Abstract: Since the turn of the millennium, capitalizing on modern advances in mathematics and computation, a slew of computational models have been proposed in the literature with the objective of describing the nucleation and propagation of fracture in materials subjected to mechanical, thermal, and/or other types of loads. By and large, each new proposal focuses on a particular aspect of the problem, while ignoring others that have been well-established. This approach has resulted in a plethora of models that are, at best, descriptors of fracture only under a restricted set of conditions, while they may predict grossly incorrect and even non-physical behaviors in general. In an attempt to address this predicament, this paper introduces a vetting process in the form of nine challenge problems that any computational model of fracture must convincingly handle if it is to potentially describe fracture nucleation and propagation in general. The focus is on the most basic of settings, that of isotropic elastic brittle materials subjected to quasi-static mechanical loads. The challenge problems have been carefully selected so that: $i$) they can be carried out experimentally with standard testing equipment; $ii$) they can be unambiguously analyzed with a sharp description of fracture; and, most critically, $iii$) in aggregate they span the entire range of well settled experimental knowledge on fracture nucleation and propagation that has been amassed for over a century. For demonstration purposes, after their introduction, each challenge problem is solved with two phase-field models of fracture.

Title: Fuzzy dark matter halos with repulsive self-interactions: coherent soliton and halo vortex network with moderate self-coupling
Authors: Milos Indjin, Nick Keepfer, I-Kang Liu, Nick P. Proukakis, Gerasimos Rigopoulos
Abstract: We examine the impact of repulsive self-interactions of moderate strength on fuzzy dark matter halos focusing on the core and granule size, the spatial dependence of the field's coherence, the turbulent vortex tangle and the oscillation frequency of the central soliton. Our analysis extends across the range from quantum-pressure-dominated to self-interaction-dominated stabilisation of the gravitationally bound solitonic core. Within this examined range of self-coupling strengths, we find that mergers with a given initial spatial configuration and an increasing self-interaction strength $g$, result in cores with increased size that exhibit a reduced central density and oscillate with decreased frequency. All of these features are in accordance with expectations from the study of isolated Self-interacting Fuzzy Dark Matter (SFDM) solitons. The characteristic size of the granules in the surrounding halo also grows but by a much smaller amount relative to the core; accordingly, typical inter-vortex distances are also only mildly affected. We also measure the total length of the vortex network which, although less robust, shows no clear dependence on increasing $g$ and no signs of decay over the timescales of our simulations. Measures of coherence of the field behave as in the non-interacting case, again clearly separating the coherent core form the quasi-coherent halo. Interestingly, we observe a relative increase of incoherent fluctuations coexisting with the coherent mode at the centre of the halo with increasing self-coupling strength, a phenomenon also observed in laboratory condensates at non-zero temperature.

Title: Fast Simulation of Damage Diffusion Distribution in Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy
Authors: Amir Javadi Rad, Amirafshar Moshtaghpour, Dongdong Chen, Angus I. Kirkland
Abstract: Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) is a critical tool for imaging the properties of materials and biological specimens at atomic scale, yet our understanding of relevant electron beam damage mechanisms is incomplete. Recent studies suggest that certain types of damage can be modelled as a diffusion process. However, numerical simulation of such diffusion processes has remained computationally intensive. This work introduces a high-performance C++ framework for simulating damage diffusion process in STEM that combines efficient numerical computation, advanced visualisations, and multithreading to achieve efficient runtime while maintaining accuracy.

Title: Machine Learning Accelerated Computational Surface-Specific Vibrational Spectroscopy Reveals Oxidation Level of Graphene in Contact with Water
Authors: Xianglong Du, Jun Cheng, Fujie Tang
Abstract: Precise characterization of the graphene/water interface has been hindered by experimental inconsistencies and limited molecular-level access to interfacial structures. In this work, we present a novel integrated computational approach that combines machine-learning-driven molecular dynamics simulations with first-principles vibrational spectroscopy calculations to reveal how graphene oxidation alters interfacial water structure. Our simulations demonstrate that pristine graphene leaves the hydrogen-bond network of interfacial water largely unperturbed, whereas graphene oxide (GO) with surface hydroxyls induces a pronounced $\Delta f \sim 100 cm^{-1}$ redshift of the free-OH vibrational band and a dramatic reduction in its amplitude. These spectral shifts in the computed surface-specific sum-frequency generation spectrum serve as sensitive molecular markers of the GO oxidation level, reconciling previously conflicting experimental observations. By providing a quantitative spectroscopic fingerprint of GO oxidation, our findings have broad implications for catalysis and electrochemistry, where the structuring of interfacial water is critical to performance.

Title: Topological weight and structural diversity of polydisperse chromatin loop networks
Authors: Andrea Bonato, Enrico Carlon, Sergey Kitaev, Davide Marenduzzo, Enzo Orlandini
Abstract: Current biophysical models for transcriptionally active chromatin view this as a polymer with sticky sites, mimicking transcription units such as promoters and enhancers which interact via the binding of multivalent complexes of chromatin-binding proteins. It has been demonstrated that this model spontaneously leads to microphase separation, resulting in the formation of a network of loops with transcription units serving as anchors. Here, we demonstrate how to compute the topological weights of loop networks with an arbitrary 1D pattern of transcription units along the fibre (or `polydisperse' loop networks), finding an analogy with networks of electric resistors in parallel or in series. We also show how the BEST (de Bruijn, van Aardenne-Ehrenfest, Smith and Tutte) theorem in combinatorics can be used to find the combinatorial multiplicity of any class of loop networks. Our results can be used to compute the structural diversity, or Shannon entropy, of loop networks: we show that this quantity depends on the 1D patterning of transcription units along the chain, possibly providing a pathway to control transcriptional noise in eukaryotic genes.

Title: Windowing in terahertz time-domain spectroscopy: resolving resonances in thin-film samples
Authors: Esteban Marulanda, Fernanda L. Costa, Nicolas M. Kawahala, Felix G. G. Hernandez
Abstract: Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) has become a powerful tool for investigating the optical properties of thin films, offering direct access to the complex permittivity in the terahertz range. However, in transmission-based measurements of thin films on thick substrates, multiple reflections and limited time windows can introduce artifacts that obscure resonant features such as phonon modes. Time-domain windowing is widely employed to mitigate these effects, yet systematic guidelines on its application remain scarce. In this work, we organize a practical routine for extracting the complex permittivity from THz-TDS data, focusing on when and how to apply time-domain windowing. The routine incorporates decision points for truncation versus smooth apodization, and emphasizes tailoring the window length and shape to specific signal conditions. We demonstrate the approach using representative measurements on PbTe thin films, highlighting cases in which truncation suffices, where apodization is essential, and how different window functions and lengths influence the resulting spectra. We also propose simple metrics to assess signal continuity and guide window selection. Our results show that the choice of window parameters can significantly affect the accuracy of extracted material parameters, particularly for sharply resonant systems. This work provides an accessible framework for improving spectral fidelity in THz-TDS of thin-film samples.

Title: Photo-Thermal Actuation of Hybrid Microgels with Dual Laser Optical Tweezers
Authors: S. -H. Jung, C. Zhang, N. Stauffer, F. Scheffold, L. Isa
Abstract: Soft actuators that respond to external stimuli play a fundamental role in microscale robotics, active matter, and bio-inspired systems. Among these actuators, photo-thermal hybrid microgels (HMGs) containing plasmonic nanoparticles enable rapid, spatially controlled actuation via localized heating. Understanding their dynamic behavior at the single-particle level is crucial for optimizing performance. However, traditional bulk characterization methods such as dynamic light scattering (DLS), provide only ensemble-averaged data, thereby limiting analytical insights. Here, we introduce a dual-laser optical tweezers approach for real-time, single-particle analysis of HMGs under controlled light exposure. Combining direct imaging and mean-square displacement (MSD) analysis, our method quantifies the precise laser power required for actuation and accurately tracks the particle size. We benchmark our results against an existing dual-laser DLS, demonstrating comparable precision while offering the unique advantage of single-actuator resolution. Thus, our method provides as a robust platform for precise optimization of programmable actuators with applications in soft robotics, microswimmers, and biomedical applications.

Title: Light-induced Pairing Instability of Ultrafast Electron Beams with Space Charge Interactions
Authors: Hao Geng, Qiaofei Pan, Jian Kang, Yiming Pan
Abstract: Ultrafast electron beams are essential for many applications, yet space-charge interactions in high-intensity beams lead to energy dissipation, coherence loss, and pulse broadening. Existing techniques mitigate these effects by using low-flux beams, preserving beam coherence into the quantum regime. Here, we propose a novel approach by treating the electrons as a strongly correlated Fermi gas rather than merely as an ensemble of charged point-like particles. We introduce a photon-induced pairing mechanism that generates a net attractive force between two electrons, thereby forming "flying bound states" analogous to Cooper pairs of conduction electrons in superconductors. Employing the setting of photon-induced near-field electron microscopy (PINEM), we demonstrate that the effective interaction via single-photon exchange among PINEM electrons can suppress the inherent repulsive Coulomb interaction, enabling a pairing instability mediated by structured electromagnetic fields at near-resonant velocity matching regimes. Finally, we analyze the dynamics of the free-electron pairs in a bunched beam, underscoring the potential to facilitate a phase-coherent condensate of electrons, which can further enhance beam coherence and multi-particle correlation for high-intensity electrons.

Title: Static disorder-induced renormalization of polariton group velocity
Authors: Gustavo J. R. Aroeira, Raphael F. Ribeiro
Abstract: Molecular exciton-polaritons exhibit long-range, ultrafast propagation, yet recent experiments have reported far slower propagation than expected. In this work, we implement a nonperturbative approach to quantify how static energetic disorder renormalizes polariton group velocity in strongly coupled microcavities. The method requires no exact diagonalization or master equation propagation, and depends only on measurable parameters: the mean exciton energy and its variance, the microcavity dispersion, and the Rabi splitting. Using parameters corresponding to recently probed organic microcavities, we show that exciton inhomogeneous broadening slows both lower and upper polaritons, particularly when the mean exciton energy fluctuation approaches the collective light-matter coupling strength. A detailed discussion and interpretation of these results is provided using perturbation theory in the limit of weak resonance scattering. Overall, our results support the view that exciton-phonon interactions likely dominate the recent experimental observations of polariton slowdown in disordered media.

Title: Revealing emergent many-body phenomena by analyzing large-scale space-time records of monitored quantum systems
Authors: Marcel Cech, Cecilia De Fazio, María Cea, Mari Carmen Bañuls, Igor Lesanovsky, Federico Carollo
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum simulators permit unitary evolution interspersed with locally resolved mid-circuit measurements. This paves the way for the observation of large-scale space-time structures in quantum trajectories and opens a window for the \emph{in situ} analysis of complex dynamical processes. We demonstrate this idea using a paradigmatic dissipative spin model, which can be implemented, e.g., on Rydberg quantum simulators. Here, already the trajectories of individual experimental runs reveal surprisingly complex statistical phenomena. In particular, we exploit free-energy functionals for trajectory ensembles to identify dynamical features reminiscent of hydrophobic behavior observed near the liquid-vapor transition in the presence of solutes in water. We show that these phenomena are observable in experiments and discuss the impact of common imperfections, such as readout errors and disordered interactions.

Title: Running Quantum Computers in Discovery Mode
Authors: Benedikt Placke, G. J. Sreejith, Alessio Lerose, S. L. Sondhi
Abstract: We propose using quantum computers in conjunction with classical machine learning to discover instances of interesting quantum many-body dynamics. Concretely, an ``interest function'' is defined for a given circuit (family) instance that can be evaluated on a quantum computer. The circuit is then adapted by a classical learning agent to maximize interest. We illustrate this approach using two examples and show numerically that, within a sufficiently general circuit family, two simple interest functions based on (i) classifiability of evolved states and (ii) spectral properties of the unitary circuit, are maximized by discrete time crystals (DTCs) and dual-unitary circuits, respectively. For (i), we also simulate the adaptive optimization and show that it indeed finds DTCs with high probability. Our study suggests that learning agents with access to quantum-computing resources can discover new phenomena in many-body quantum dynamics, and establishes the design of good interest functions as a future research paradigm for quantum many-body physics.

Denlinger, Tay-Rong Chang, Shuang Jia, Claudia Felser, Hsin Lin, Guoqing Chang, M. Zahid Hasan
Abstract: Novel topological phases of matter are fruitful platforms for the discovery of unconventional electromagnetic phenomena. Higher-fold topology is one example, where the low-energy description goes beyond Standard Model analogs. Despite intensive experimental studies, conclusive evidence remains elusive for the \textit{multi-gap topological nature of higher-fold chiral fermions}. In this Letter, we leverage a combination of fine-tuned chemical engineering and photoemission spectroscopy with photon energy contrast to discover the higher-fold topology of a chiral crystal. We identify all bulk branches of a higher-fold chiral fermion for the first time, critically important for allowing us to explore unique Fermi arc surface states in multiple inter-band gaps, which exhibit an emergent ladder structure. Through designer chemical gating of the samples in combination with our measurements, we uncover an unprecedented multi-gap bulk boundary correspondence. Our demonstration of multi-gap electronic topology will propel future research on unconventional topological responses.

Title: Quantum Geometric Exciton Drift Velocity
Authors: Jinlyu Cao, H.A.Fertig, Luis Brey
Abstract: We show that the dipole moment of an exciton is uniquely determined by the quantum geometry of its eigenstates, and demonstrate its intimate connection with a quantity we call the Quantum Geometric Dipole (QGD). The QGD arises naturally in semiclassical dynamics of an exciton in an electric field, contributing to the anomalous velocity differently from the Berry's curvature. In a uniform electric field QGD results in a drift velocity akin to that expected for excitons in crossed electric and magnetic fields, even in the absence of a real magnetic field. We compute the quantities relevant to semiclassical exciton dynamics for several interesting examples of bilayer systems with weak interlayer tunneling and Fermi energy in a gap, where the exciton may be sensibly described as a two-body problem. These quantities include the exciton dispersion, its QGD, and Berry's curvature. For two gapped-graphene layers in a vanishing magnetic field, we find the Quantum Geometric Dipole vanishes if the layers are identical, but may be non-zero when the layers differ. We further analyze examples in the presence of magnetic fields, allowing us to examine cases involving graphene, in which a gap is opened by Landau level splitting. Heterostructures involving TMDs are also considered. In each case the Quantum Geometric Dipole and Berry's curvatures play out differently. In some cases, the lowest energy exciton state is found to reside at finite momentum, with interesting possibilities for Bose condensation. We also find situations in which the QGD increases monotonically with exciton momentum, suggesting that the quantum geometry can be exploited to produce photocurrents from initially bound excitons with electric fields. We speculate on further possible effects of the semiclassical dynamics in geometries where the constituent layers are subject to the same or different electric fields.

Title: Engineering active motion in quantum matter
Authors: Alexander P. Antonov, Yuanjian Zheng, Benno Liebchen, Hartmut Löwen
Abstract: We introduce a framework for engineering active quantum matter that involves mimicking the role of self-propulsion through an external trapping potential that is moving along imposed trajectories traced by classical active dynamics. This approach in the presence of dissipation, not only recovers essential dynamical behavior of classical activity, including the ballistic to diffusive cross-over of its mean-square displacement, but also reveals additional features of activity that are of quantum origin. These quantum-active features are revealed in non-dissipative systems, and manifest as novel exponents of the mean-square displacement at short timescales.

Title: Multiple Mechanisms for Emerging Conductance Plateaus in Fractional Quantum Hall States
Authors: Sourav Manna, Ankur Das, Yuval Gefen, Moshe Goldstein
Abstract: Two-terminal conductance quantization in the context of quantum Hall (QH) physics is intimately related to the current carried by a discrete number of chiral edge modes. Upon pinching off a QH bar, one may engineer setups where some modes are fully transmitted (while the others are fully reflected), giving rise to the orthodox theory of quantized conductance plateaus. Here, we note that the observation of quantized plateaus \emph{does not} uniquely indicate the underlying mechanism. Our study demonstrates explicitly that (i) such plateaus may be the manifestations of entirely different mechanisms; (ii) conductance measurements alone will not suffice to distinguish one from the other. We further show that measurements of shot noise (auto- and cross-correlation) at the plateau may discriminate among different mechanisms. While our observations apply to a broad class of QH states, we demonstrate their applicability employing a prototypical example: the bulk state of filling factor $\nu=2/3$. We present distinctly different scenarios that lead to a conductance plateau $G_{2-\text{terminal}} = e^2/3h$ (observed previously), and likewise qualitatively different mechanisms leading to $e^2/2h$ (recently observed). We also predict the possibility of a new conductance plateau at $5e^2/9h$, following a non-orthodox scenario.

Title: A simplified Parisi Ansatz II: REM universality
Authors: Simone Franchini
Abstract: In a previous work [A simplified Parisi Ansatz, Franchini, S., Commun. Theor. Phys., 73, 055601 (2021)] we introduced a simple method to compute the Random Overlap Structure of Aizenmann, Simm and Stars and the full RSB Parisi formula for the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Model without using replica theory. The method consists in partitioning the system into smaller sub-systems that we call layers, and iterate the Bayes rule. A central ansatz in our derivation was that these layers could be approximated by Random Energy Models of the Derrida type. In this paper we analyze the properties of the interface in detail, and show the equivalence with the Random Energy Model at any temperature.

Title: Unraveling the Complexity of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction in Layered Magnets: The Full Magnitude and Chirality Control
Authors: Khalil Zakeri, Albrecht von Faber, Sergiy Mankovsky, Hubert Ebert
Abstract: Chirality is an inherent characteristics of some objects in nature. In magnetism chiral magnetic textures can be formed in systems with broken inversion symmetry and due to an antisymmetric magnetic interaction, known as Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya interaction (DMI). Here, aiming on a fundamental understanding of this chiral interaction on the atomic scale, we design several synthetic layered structures composed of alternating atomic layers of 3d ferromagnetic metals epitaxially grown on Ir(001). We demonstrate both experimentally and theoretically that the atomistic DMI depends critically not only on the orbital occupancy of the interface magnetic layer but also on the sequence of the atomic layers. The effect is attributed to the complexity of the electronic structure and the contribution of different orbitals to the hybridization and DMI. We anticipate that our results provide guidelines for controlling both the chirality and the magnitude of the atomistic DMI.

Title: Properties of a Majorana fermion ensemble with exciton-like mass
Authors: L. E. S. Machado, F. C. E. Lima, C. A. S. Almeida
Abstract: Considering the relativistic scenario, we dedicate our study to the relativistic quantum description of one-dimensional Majorana fermions. Thus, we focus on aspects related to exciton-like particles. Seeking to reach our purpose, one analyzes the relativistic quantum mechanical system characterized by an effective mass distribution. In this context, we adopt an exciton-like position-dependent mass without impurity, i.e., without electromagnetic interactions. From this perspective, one notes results of noteworthy interest as consequences of the theory adopted. For instance, we highlight that, even without interaction, exciton-like Majorana fermions manifest theoretically bound states. Also, we construct a Majorana fermion ensemble with effective mass immersed in a thermal reservoir. That allows for a thorough investigation of the thermodynamic properties of the system. Among the thermodynamic characteristics studied in the canonical ensemble, we focus on the Helmholtz free energy, mean energy, entropy, and heat capacity. The numerical results obtained for these thermodynamic properties corroborate the validity of the Dulong-Petit law for our system.

Title: Anomalous Gate-tunable Capacitance in Van der Waals Heterostructures
Authors: Linshang Chen, Haoran Long, Heng Wu, Rui Mei, Zhengyu Su, Mengjie Feng, Jiang-Bin Wu, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Xuewei Cao, Zhongming Wei, Ping-Heng Tan, Yanmeng Shi
Abstract: The ferroelectricity emerging in non-polar graphene/hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) heterostructures has drawn considerable attention because of its fascinating properties and promising high-frequency electrical polarization switching. Yet, the underlying mechanism is still under debate. Here in twisted double bilayer graphene (TDBLG) aligned with its neighboring hBN, we observed two types of hysteresis - delayed hysteresis in top gate induced by the anomalous screening, and advanced hysteresis in back gate caused by the anomalous gate-tunable capacitance. To investigate the role played by moiré potential in the anomalous hysteresis, we studied a moiréless graphene heterostructure as control experiment. Unexpectedly, we observed exactly the same phenomena in this control device. Our findings suggest that the anomalous ferroelectricity in graphene/hBN heterostructures may originate from the dielectric material hBN, calling for further structural investigations on hBN. The observation of gate-tunable capacitance provides more insights in the mysterious ferroelectricity in graphene/hBN heterostructures, and should enable new design of memory devices such as memcapacitor based on tunable capacitance.

Title: Thermodynamic Space of Chemical Reaction Networks
Authors: Shiling Liang, Paolo De Los Rios, Daniel Maria Busiello
Abstract: Living systems are usually maintained out of equilibrium and consume energy to sustain emergent organized states. Their robust functioning rely on a set of interconnected chemical reaction networks (CRN) in which the external energy supply often comes from fluxes that can keep some species concentrations constant. Hence, to capture the emergent complexity of living systems and the role of their non-equilibrium nature, it is fundamental to uncover constraints and properties of the CRNs underpinning their functions. In particular, while kinetics plays a key role in shaping detailed dynamical phenomena, the range of operations of these underlying CRNs is fundamentally constrained by thermodynamics. Here, we derive universal thermodynamic upper and lower bounds for species concentrations in a generic CRN operating within a given energy budget. The resulting region determines the thermodynamic space of the CRN, a concept we introduce in this work that determines the range of accessible concentrations for the chemical species involved at a given value of non-equilibrium driving. We obtain similar bounds for the affinities, shedding light on how global thermodynamic properties, such as the total dissipation, can limit local non-equilibrium quantities. We illustrate our results in various paradigmatic examples, the Schlogl model for bistability, a minimal self-assembly process, a paradigmatic system exhibiting chiral symmetry breaking, and a multi-molecular model for reaction-diffusion patterns, demonstrating how the onset of complex behaviors is intimately tangled with the presence of non-equilibrium conditions. By providing a general tool for analyzing CRNs, the presented framework constitutes a stepping stone to deepen our ability to predict complex out-of-equilibrium phenomena and design artificial chemical systems, starting from the sole knowledge of the underlying thermodynamic properties.

Title: Asymptotic Formulation of the Role of Shear Loads on Multi-Layered Thin Shells and Classification of Their Deformation Modes
Authors: Xiwei Pan (1), Yichao Zhu (1,2) ((1) Department of Engineering Mechanics, Dalian University of Technology, (2) State Key Laboratory of Structural Analysis, Optimization and CAE Software for Industrial Equipment)
Abstract: Shell structures are generally modeled based on kinematic hypotheses, where some of the parameters are preferentially evaluated in a phenomenological manner. In this article, asymptotic analysis against the underlying three-dimensional equation system is considered so as to provide a rational framework for modeling and interpreting the deformation behavior of multi-layered thin shells (MTSs). Capable of accurately predicting both overall stiffness and detailed stress distribution, the proposed shell theory shows its distinguishing features at least in the following aspects. Firstly, it naturally introduces a rule for classifying the deformation modes of MTSs based on the magnitude of the maximum dimensionless principal curvature. Secondly, for each class, the hierarchy in the order of the involved field quantities is examined, and it is shown that when the product of the maximum principal curvature and the characteristic shell size reaches the magnitude of unity or larger, the resulting shell theory cannot be treated by natural extension of plate theories. Lastly, it is demonstrated that, for moderate shear forces and comparable material properties, a leading-order multi-layered shell theory derived from asymptotic analysis should suffice to output satisfactory predictions over the shell stiffness, as well as its internal stress distribution. Numerical examples of the deformation and strength analysis for MTSs are also presented to show the reliability of the leading-order model.

Title: Effect of quenched heterogeneity on creep lifetimes of disordered materials
Authors: Juan Carlos Verano-Espitia, Jérôme Weiss, David Amitrano, Tero Mäkinen, Mikko Alava
Abstract: We revisit the problem of describing creep in heterogeneous materials by an effective temperature by considering more realistic (and complex) non-mean-field elastic redistribution kernels. We show first, from theoretical considerations, that, if elastic stress redistribution and memory effects are neglected, the average creep failure time follows an Arrhenius expression with an effective temperature explicitly increasing with the quenched heterogeneity. Using a thermally activated progressive damage model of compressive failure, we show that this holds true when taking into account elastic interactions and memory effects, however with an effective temperature $T_{eff}$ depending as well on the nature of the (non-democratic) elastic interaction kernel. We observe that the variability of creep lifetimes, for given external conditions of load and temperature, is roughly proportional to the mean lifetime, therefore depends as well on $T$, on quenched heterogeneity, and the elastic kernel. Finally, we discuss the implications of this effective temperature effect on the interpretation of macroscopic creep tests to estimate an activation volume at the microscale.

Title: Local Limit Disorder Characteristics of Superconducting Radio Frequency Cavities
Authors: Anastasiya Lebedeva, Matúš Hladký, Marcel Polák, František Herman
Abstract: Nowadays Nb-based superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities represent fundamental tools used for (Standard Model) particle acceleration, (beyond Standard Model) particle probing, and long-lifetime photon preservation. We study the SRF frequency shift in the vicinity of the critical temperature $T_c$ and the quality factor mainly at low temperatures within the Dynes superconductor model. We scrutinize and use the local limit response to the external electromagnetic field. Our approach allows for a finer analysis of the peculiar behavior of the resonant frequency shift immensely close to $T_c$, observed in recent experiments. In several regimes, we analytically elaborate on the width and depth of the resulting dip. Studying the sign of the slope of the resonant frequency shift at $T_c$ in the moderately clean regime clarifies the role of the pair-breaking and pair-conserving disorder. Next, to find the relevance of our description, we compare and also fit our results with the recent experimental data from the N-doped Nb sample presented in [arXiv:2307.07905]. Our analysis complies with the experimental findings, especially concerning the dip width. We offer a straightforward, homogeneous-disorder-based interpretation within the moderately clean regime. Comparative analysis for three other cavities with different resonant frequencies reported in [arXiv:2207.14236] points towards a similar regime. Assuming the same regime at low temperatures, we address details of the high-quality plateaus. Summing all up, this work presents (and studies the limits of) the simple, effective description of the complex problem corresponding to the electromagnetic response in the superconductors, combining homogeneous conventional pairing and two different kinds of disorder scattering.

Title: Incipient quantum spin Hall insulator under strong correlations
Authors: Peizhi Mai, Jinchao Zhao, Philip W. Phillips
Abstract: To assess prior mean-field claims that the interacting Kane-Mele model hosts a novel $z-$antiferromagnetic (AFM) Chern insulating phase for a wide range of sub-lattice potentials, we analyze the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model in the presence of a sub-lattice potential using non-perturbative determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We find instead that the true low-temperature state is a quantum spin Hall insulator for intermediate values of the sub-lattice potential $\lambda_v$ and large on-site repulsion. Two kinds of magnetic fluctuations are found to compete: $z$- and $xy$-AFM. The latter dominates at low temperature leading to a stabilization of the quantum spin Hall state as opposed to $z-$AFM Chern insulator. Our work is consistent with the robust quantum spin Hall effects which are consistently observed at even-integer fillings over a wide range of parameters in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ and WSe$_2$ as well as AB stacked MoTe$_2$/WSe$_2$.

Title: Native defects and impurities in talcum quasi-2D layers
Authors: Gellért Dolecsek, Oscar Bulancea Lindvall, Joel Davidsson, Viktor Ivády
Abstract: Layered semiconductors have recently emerged as capable host materials for novel quantum applications ranging from phonics to sensing. Most studies have focused on artificial layered materials, while natural layered materials, such as talc and other silicates, have remained largely unexplored despite their desirable properties, e.g, wide direct bandgap, low concentration of optically active defects, and low abundance of nuclear spins. In this article, we carry out a comprehensive computational study of pristine and defective talc layers and discuss their potential applications. After investigating bulk properties, such as lattice parameters, band structure, and dielectric constant, we study the electronic structure, charge states, spin and optical properties of vacancy defects, metal, metalloid, and non-metallic impurities. Our results establish the basis for identifying color centers, electron paramagnetic resonance centers, potential spin quantum bits, and p and n-type dopants. These findings mature the theory of talc and point toward potential applications in quantum technologies.

Title: Squeezing Quantum States in Three-Dimensional Twisted Crystals
Authors: Vo Tien Phong, Kason Kunkelmann, Christophe De Beule, Mohammed M. Al Ezzi, Robert-Jan Slager, Shaffique Adam, E. J. Mele
Abstract: A fundamental idea in wave mechanics is that propagation in a periodic medium can be described by Bloch waves whose conserved crystal momenta define their transformations when displaced by the set of discrete lattice translations. In ordered materials where incommensurate spatial periods compete, this general principle is rendered ineffective, often with dramatic consequences. Examples are crystals with broken symmetries from charge or spin density waves, quasiperiodic lattices that produce diffraction patterns with crystallographically forbidden point symmetries, and stacks of two-dimensional lattices with a relative rotation (twist) between layers. In special cases when there is a small difference between the competing periods, a useful work-around is a continuum description where a periodic long-wavelength field produces Bragg scattering that coherently mixes short-wavelength carrier waves. In this work, we advocate an alternative approach to study three-dimensional twisted crystals that replaces their spectrally congested momentum-space Bloch band structures with a representation using squeezed coherent states in a Fock space of free-particle vortex states. This reorganization of the Hilbert space highlights the crucial role of the Coriolis force in the equations of motion that leads to unconventional phase space dynamics and edge state structure generic to a family of complex crystals.

Title: Pairing boost from enhanced spin-fermion coupling in the pseudogap regime
Authors: Yang Yu, Sergei Iskakov, Emanuel Gull, Karsten Held, Friedrich Krien
Abstract: We perform a fluctuation analysis of the pairing interaction in the hole-doped Hubbard model within the dynamical cluster approximation. Our analysis reveals that spin-fluctuation-mediated pairing differs qualitatively in the over- and underdoped regimes. In the underdoped regime, spin fluctuations open a pseudogap. We show that in this regime the spin-fermion coupling mediates a giant attraction between antinodal fermions. This explains why superconductivity survives at underdoping in the Hubbard model and cuprates, despite the lack of coherent fermionic quasiparticles in the pseudogap regime.

Title: How to realize compact and non-compact localized states in disorder-free hypercube networks
Authors: Ievgen I. Arkhipov, Fabrizio Minganti, Franco Nori
Abstract: We present a method for realizing various zero-energy localized states on disorder-free hypercube graphs. Previous works have already indicated that disorder is not essential for observing localization phenomena in noninteracting systems, with some prominent examples including the 1D Aubry-André model, characterized solely by incommensurate potentials, or 2D incommensurate Moiré lattices, which exhibit localization due to the flat band spectrum. Moreover, flat band systems with translational invariance can also possess so-called compact localized states, characterized by exactly zero amplitude outside a finite region of the lattice. Here, we demonstrate that both compact and non-compact (i.e., Anderson-like) localized states naturally emerge in disorder-free hypercubes, which can be systematically constructed using Cartan products. This construction ensures the robustness of these localized states against perturbations. Furthermore, we show that the hypercubes can be associated with the Fock space of interacting spin systems exhibiting localization. Viewing localization from the hypercube perspective, with its inherently simple eigenspace structure, offers a clearer and more intuitive understanding of the underlying Fock-space many-body localization phenomena. Our findings can be readily tested on existing experimental platforms, where hypercube graphs can be emulated, e.g., by photonic networks of coupled optical cavities or waveguides. The results can pave the way for the development of novel quantum information protocols and enable effective simulation of quantum many-body localization phenomena.

Title: Quantum Supercritical Regime with Universal Magnetocaloric Scaling in Ising Magnets
Authors: Enze Lv, Ning Xi, Yuliang Jin, Wei Li
Abstract: Quantum critical points (QCPs) ubiquitously emerge in strongly correlated systems, with their influence extending beyond zero temperature. There exist extended quantum critical regimes (QCRs) at finite temperatures and external fields. A paradigmatic example exhibiting QCP is quantum Ising magnets like \cno, where critical quantum fluctuations and robust universal scaling behavior provide crucial insights into the quantum material. In this work, we discover a fundamentally distinct quantum supercritical regime (QSR) emerging also from the QCP but controlled by symmetry-breaking fields ($h$) coupled to the order parameter. The QSR is enclosed by the crossover boundaries $T \propto h^{{z\nu}/\Delta}$, where $z$, $\nu$ and $\Delta\equiv\beta+\gamma$ are critical exponents. Amongst other intriguing phenomena, there exists an enhanced magnetocaloric effect (MCE) in QSR, characterized by a universally diverging magnetic Grüneisen ratio $\Gamma_h \equiv \frac{1}{T} (\frac{\partial T}{\partial h})_{S} \propto T^{-\Delta/{z\nu}}$. Even small symmetry-breaking fields generate dramatic temperature variations. The supercritical scaling can be comprehended via thermal data collapse based on the derived scaling form. We propose to observe the QSR and related supercritical MCE in \cno~and other quantum Ising magnets, which may enable cryogenic technologies capable of reaching the millikelvin regime without relying on helium-3.

Title: Topologically-Protected Remnant Vortices in Confined Superfluid $^3$He
Authors: Alexander J. Shook, Daksh Malhotra, Aymar Muhikira, Vaisakh Vadakkumbatt, John P. Davis
Abstract: Symmetry breaking phase transitions from less to more ordered phases will typically produce topological defects in the ordered phase. Kibble-Zurek theory predicts that for any second-order phase transition, such as the early universe, the density of defects that form should be determined by the scaling law for the system coherence time and the phase transition quench time. We have performed measurements of fourth sound dissipation due to vortex mutual friction in thin channels of superfluid $^3$He where one spatial dimension is smaller than a characteristic length scale predicted by the Kibble-Zurek theory. Our measurements suggest that remnant vortices form after the normal to superfluid second-order phase transition, and that the density of vortices is correlated with the size of the channel, but crucially, is independent of quench time. We propose a modified picture of defect formation, where closely spaced walls prevent the ends of vortex lines from reconnecting into loops. This leads to a mean vortex separation set by the wall spacing, which can result in much higher defect densities than in bulk systems.

Title: Establishing baselines for generative discovery of inorganic crystals
Authors: Nathan J. Szymanski, Christopher J. Bartel
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence offers a promising avenue for materials discovery, yet its advantages over traditional methods remain unclear. In this work, we introduce and benchmark two baseline approaches - random enumeration of charge-balanced prototypes and data-driven ion exchange of known compounds - against four generative techniques based on diffusion models, variational autoencoders, and large language models. Our results show that established methods such as ion exchange are better at generating novel materials that are stable, although many of these closely resemble known compounds. In contrast, generative models excel at proposing novel structural frameworks and, when sufficient training data is available, can more effectively target properties such as electronic band gap and bulk modulus. To enhance the performance of both the baseline and generative approaches, we implement a post-generation screening step in which all proposed structures are passed through stability and property filters from pre-trained machine learning models including universal interatomic potentials. This low-cost filtering step leads to substantial improvement in the success rates of all methods, remains computationally efficient, and ultimately provides a practical pathway toward more effective generative strategies for materials discovery. By establishing baselines for comparison, this work highlights opportunities for continued advancement of generative models, especially for the targeted generation of novel materials that are thermodynamically stable.

Title: Invar behavior and negative thermal expansion linked to magnetic transition in dhcp iron hydride under high pressure
Authors: Yuichiro Mori, Katsutoshi Aoki, Masahiro Takano, Hiroyuki Kagi, Ina Park, Zifan Wang, Duck Young Kim, Noriyoshi Tsujino, Sho Kakizawa, Yuji Higo
Abstract: Hydrogen incorporation into interstitial sites under high-pressure conditions forms iron hydride with a double hexagonal close-packed (dhcp) structure. This phase is stable over a broad pressure-temperature range and exhibits a pressure-induced ferromagnetic-paramagnetic transition. In this study, we revealed that dhcp iron hydride exhibits the Invar-like behavior and that its thermal expansion becomes negative at elevated pressures by X-ray diffraction. Our findings, supported by DFT+DMFT calculations, demonstrate that these anomalous volume changes are governed by magnetic transitions. Notably, the experimentally determined magnetic volume contribution is an order of magnitude smaller than previous theoretical predictions.

Title: Mode-Shell correspondence, a unifying phase space theory in topological physics -- part II: Higher-dimensional spectral invariants
Authors: Lucien Jezequel, Pierre Delplace
Abstract: The mode-shell correspondence relates the number $I_M$ of gapless modes in phase space to a topological \textit{shell invariant} $\Ish$ defined on a close surface -- the shell -- surrounding those modes, namely $I_M=I_S$. In part I, we introduced the mode-shell correspondence for zero-modes of chiral symmetric Hamiltonians (class AIII). In this part II, we extend the correspondence to arbitrary dimension and to both symmetry classes A and AIII. This allows us to include, in particular, $1D$-unidirectional edge modes of Chern insulators, massless $2D$-Dirac and $3D$-Weyl cones, within the same formalism. We provide an expression of $I_M$ that only depends on the dimension of the dispersion relation of the gapless mode, and does not require a translation invariance. Then, we show that the topology of the shell (a circle, a sphere, a torus), that must account for the spreading of the gapless mode in phase space, yields specific expressions of the shell index. Semi-classical expressions of those shell indices are also derived and reduce to either Chern or winding numbers depending on the parity of the mode's dimension. In that way, the mode-shell correspondence provides a unified and systematic topological description of both bulk and boundary gapless modes in any dimension, and in particular includes the bulk-boundary correspondence. We illustrate the generality of the theory by analyzing several models of semimetals and insulators, both on lattices and in the continuum, and also discuss weak and higher-order topological phases within this framework. Although this paper is a continuation of Part I, the content remains sufficiently independent to be mostly read separately.

Title: Relaxation dynamics of a quantum spin coupled to a topological edge state
Authors: Qiyu Liu, Christoph Karrasch, Dante Marvin Kennes, Roman Rausch
Abstract: A classical impurity spin coupled to the spinful Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain is known to exhibit complex switching dynamics with incomplete spin relaxation. Here, we study the corrections that result from a full quantum treatment of the impurity spin. We find that in the topologically trivial case, the quantum spin behaves similarly to the classical one due to the absence of the Kondo effect for the trivial insulator. In the topological case, the quantum spin is significantly less likely to relax: It can be stuck at a pre-relaxation plateau with a sizable deviation from the expected relaxed value, and there is a large parameter regime where it does not relax at all but features an anomalously large Larmor frequency. Furthermore, we find an additional quantum effect where the pre-relaxation plateau can be hyperpolarized, i.e., the spin is stuck at a polarization value larger than the ground-state expectation value. This is possible due to the (incomplete) Kondo screening of the quantum spin, which is absent in the classical case. Our results are obtained via the ground state density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm and the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP), where the charge-SU(2) symmetry of the problem was exploited. Furthermore, we introduce and benchmark a method to predict the dynamics from the given numerical data based on the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy). This allows us to prolong the simulation timescale by a factor of 2.5, up to a maximal time of $10^3$ inverse hoppings.

Title: How to choose efficiently the size of the Bethe-Salpeter Equation Hamiltonian for accurate exciton calculations on supercells
Authors: Rafael R. Del Grande, David A. Strubbe
Abstract: The Bethe-Salpeter Equation (BSE) is the workhorse method to study excitons in materials. The size of the BSE Hamiltonian, that is how many valence to conduction band transitions are considered in those calculations, needs to be chosen to be sufficiently large to converge excitons' energies and wavefunctions but should be minimized to make calculations tractable, as BSE calculations scale with the number of atoms as $ (N_{\rm{atoms}}^6)$. In particular, in the case of supercell (SC) calculations composed of $N_{\rm{rep}}$ replicas of the primitive cell (PC), a natural choice to build this BSE Hamiltonian is to include all transitions from PC calculations by zone folding. However, this greatly increases the size of the BSE Hamiltonian, as the number of matrix elements in it is $(N_k N_c N_v)^2$, where $N_k$ is the number of $k$-points, and $N_{c(v)}$ is the number of conduction (valence) states. The number of $k$-points decreases by a factor $N_{\rm{rep}}$ but both the number of conduction and valence states increase by the same factor, therefore the BSE Hamiltonian increases by a factor $N_{\rm{rep}}^2$, making exactly corresponding calculations prohibitive. Here we provide an analysis to decide how many transitions are necessary to achieve comparable results. With our method, we show that to converge with an energy tolerance of 0.1 eV the first exciton binding energy of a LiF SC composed of 64 PCs, we only need 12\% of the valence to conduction transitions that are given by zone folding. We also show that exciton energies are much harder to converge than Random Phase Approximation transition energies, underscoring the necessity of careful convergence studies. The procedure in our work helps in evaluating excitonic properties in large SC calculations such as defects, self-trapped excitons, polarons, and interfaces.

Title: Steady-state dynamical mean field theory based on influence functional matrix product states
Authors: Mithilesh Nayak, Julian Thoenniss, Michael Sonner, Dmitry A. Abanin, Philipp Werner
Abstract: We implement the recently developed influence functional matrix product states approach as impurity solver in equilibrium and nonequilibrium dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) calculations of the single-band Hubbard model. The method yields numerically exact descriptions of metallic states without sharp spectral features, at a moderate numerical cost. Systems with narrow quasiparticle or spin-polaron peaks, as well as low-temperature Mott insulators provide more challenges, since these simulations require long time contours or high bond dimensions. A promising field of application is the DMFT simulation of nonequilibrium steady states, which we demonstrate with results for photo-doped Mott systems with long-lived doublon and holon populations.

Title: Schrödinger Bridges for Systems of Interacting Particles
Authors: Henri Orland
Abstract: A Schrödinger bridge is the most probable time-dependent probability distribution that connects an initial probability distribution $w_{i}$ to a final one $w_{f}$. The problem has been solved and widely used for the case of simple Brownian evolution (non-interacting particles). It is related to the problem of entropy-regularized Wasserstein optimal transport. In this article, we generalize Brownian bridges to systems of interacting particles. We derive some equations for the forward and backward single particle ``wave-functions'' which allow to compute the most probable evolution of the single-particle probability between the initial and final distributions.

Title: Experiments and modeling of mechanically-soft, hard magnetorheological foams with potential applications in haptic sensing
Authors: Zehui Lin, Zahra Hooshmand-Ahoor, Laurence Bodelot, Kostas Danas
Abstract: This study proposes a family of novel mechanically-soft and magnetically-hard magnetorheological foams that, upon deformation, lead to robust and measurable magnetic flux changes in their surroundings. This allows to infer qualitatively and even quantitatively the imposed deformation and, eventually from that, an estimation of the stiffness and average stress on the sample even in complex loading scenarios involving combinations of uniform or nonuniform compression/tension with superposed shearing in different directions. The work provides a complete experimental, theoretical and numerical framework on finite strain, compressible magneto-elasticity, thereby allowing to measure and predict coupled magneto-mechanical properties of such materials with different particle volume fractions and then use it to estimate and design potential haptic sensing devices.

Abstract: The inelastic neutron scattering results and their analysis unequivocally point to a dominant Kitaev interaction in the honeycomb-lattice cobaltate BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$. Our anisotropic-exchange model closely describes $all$ available neutron scattering data in the material's field-polarized phase. The density-matrix renormalization group results for our model are in close accord with the unusual double-zigzag magnetic order and the low in-plane saturation field of BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$.

Title: Twist Grain Boundary phases in proper ferroelectric liquid crystals realm
Authors: Damian Pociecha, Jadwiga Szydlowska, Nataša Vaupotič, Katarzyna Kwiatkowska, Marijus Juodka, Julian Spiess, John MD Storey, Corrie T Imrie, Rebecca Walker, Ewa Gorecka
Abstract: The twist-grain-boundary (TGB) phases, characterized by a periodic, helical arrangement of blocks made of polar smectic phases, SmAF and SmCF, have been discovered. They have been observed for rod-like molecules with a strong longitudinal dipole moment, featuring an (S)-2-methylbutyl end group having only weak twisting power, and emerge below the antiferroelectric SmAAF phase, where the lamellar structure is already well established. It is suggested that the structure is governed by electrostatic interactions amplified by weak chiral forces, in striking contrast to the mechanism of TGB phase formation found in non-polar materials. The TGB phases exhibit light selective reflection in the visible range, while the value of electric polarization confirms an almost perfectly ordered dipole alignment.

Title: Buried unstrained germanium channels: a lattice-matched platform for quantum technology
Authors: Davide Costa, Patrick Del Vecchio, Karina Hudson, Lucas E. A. Stehouwer, Alberto Tosato, Davide Degli Esposti, Mario Lodari, Stefano Bosco, Giordano Scappucci
Abstract: Ge and Si strained quantum wells have enabled the most advanced spin-qubit quantum processors, but they are deposited on defective, metamorphic SiGe substrates, which may impact device performance and scaling. Here we introduce an alternative platform, based on a heterojunction between unstrained Ge and a strained SiGe barrier, which is lattice-matched to a Ge substrate. In a structure with a 52-nm-thick strained SiGe barrier, we demonstrate a low-disorder two-dimensional hole gas with a high-mobility of 1.33$\times$10$^5$ cm$^2$/Vs and a low percolation density of 1.4(1)$\times$10$^1$$^0$ cm$^-$$^2$. Quantum transport measurements show that confined holes have a strong density-dependent in-plane effective mass and out-of-plane $g$-factor, pointing to a significant heavy-hole--light-hole mixing in agreement with theory. The expected strong spin-orbit interaction, possibility of isotopic purification, and ability to host superconducting pairing correlations make this platform appealing for fast quantum hardware and hybrid quantum systems.

Title: Theory of Semi-Deterministic Quantum Dot Placement in Heteroepitaxy
Authors: Zihang Wang, Dirk Bouwmeester
Abstract: Achieving deterministic placement of self-assembled quantum dots (QDs) during epitaxial growth is essential for the reliable and efficient fabrication of high-quality single-photon sources and solid-state cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) systems, yet it remains a significant challenge due to the inherent stochasticity of QD nucleation processes. In this work, we theoretically demonstrate (e.g., on a (001)-oriented substrate) that deterministic QD nucleation within a pristine growth region can be achieved by engineering the boundary geometry of that region. During epitaxial growth, adatoms initially move toward the boundary and promote the formation of primary QDs along the boundary, driven by curvature and diffusion anisotropy. The resulting primary QDs distribution will generate many-body interactions that dynamically reshape the chemical potential landscape for subsequently deposited adatoms, enabling the formation of secondary QDs within the pristine growth region. These findings provide a theoretical foundation for reliable patterning of high optical-quality QDs, with potential applications in next-generation quantum photonic devices.

Title: Uncertainty in AI-driven Monte Carlo simulations
Authors: Dimitrios Tzivrailis, Alberto Rosso, Eiji Kawasaki
Abstract: In the study of complex systems, evaluating physical observables often requires sampling representative configurations via Monte Carlo techniques. These methods rely on repeated evaluations of the system's energy and force fields, which can become computationally expensive. To accelerate these simulations, deep learning models are increasingly employed as surrogate functions to approximate the energy landscape or force fields. However, such models introduce epistemic uncertainty in their predictions, which may propagate through the sampling process and affect the system's macroscopic behavior. In our work, we present the Penalty Ensemble Method (PEM) to quantify epistemic uncertainty and mitigate its impact on Monte Carlo sampling. Our approach introduces an uncertainty-aware modification of the Metropolis acceptance rule, which increases the rejection probability in regions of high uncertainty, thereby enhancing the reliability of the simulation outcomes.

Title: Influence of the Effective Mass on ab initio Phonon-limited Electron Mobility of GaAs
Authors: Mohammad Dehghani, Dominic Waldhoer, Angus Gentles, Pedram Khakbaz, Rainer Minixhofer, Michael Waltl
Abstract: We present a comprehensive ab initio study of the influence of band structure corrections, particularly the electron effective mass, on the phonon-limited electron drift and Hall mobilities of GaAs. Our approach is based on the DFT+$U$ method, combined with an iterative solution of the linearized Boltzmann transport equation using the Wannier interpolation technique. We show how this framework allows for accurate refinements of the electronic band structure and phonon dispersion, leading to improved predictions for transport properties. In particular, by varying the Hubbard parameters to purposefully tune the conduction band features, allowing us to reproduce bands with different electron effective mass, we systematically investigate the relationship between mobility and effective mass. In this context, our results show close agreement with semi-empirical relations that follow a power-law dependence. Moreover, this approach can be used to indirectly incorporate temperature effects into the band structure, enabling efficient evaluation of temperature-dependent electron mobilities. Our mobility results exhibit good agreement with experimental data and are comparable to previously reported values obtained using the computationally expensive GW method.

Title: Ultra-small Mode Volume Polariton Condensation via Precision $He^+$ Ion Implantation

Abstract: We present a novel method for generating potential landscapes in GaAs microcavities through focused $He^{+}$ implantation. The ion beam imprints micron-scale patterns of non-radiative centers that deplete the exciton reservoir and form a loss-defined potential minimum. Under non-resonant pumping, the resulting traps have a lateral size $\le 1.2 ~\mathrm{\mu m}$ and a three-dimensional mode volume of only $\approx 0.6 ~ \mathrm{\mu m^3}$, small enough to to support a single polariton condensate mode. The implantation process maintains strong coupling and provides lithographic ($ < 300 ~ \mathrm{nm}$) resolution. These loss-engineered traps effectively overcome the micrometer-scale limitations of conventional microcavity patterning techniques, opening new avenues for device development and polariton research within the quantum regime.

Title: Photonic obstructed atomic insulator
Authors: Hongyu Chen
Abstract: Topological quantum chemistry (TQC) classifies the topological phases by real-space invariants in which obstructed atomic insulators belong to the trivial case but sometimes show the feature of higher-order topological insulator. Here, for a two-dimensional magnetic photonic obstructed atomic insulator, we show that the emergence of corner states is associated with the Wyckoff positions. In such a square lattice with four +$M$ elements and four -$M$ elements, corner states appear when the superlattice exposes $2b$ Wyckoff positions. And the corner states will decrease when the number of exposed $2b$ Wyckoff positions decreases and disappears when $2b$ Wyckoff positions no longer stand at the edge. By arranging all the magnetic rods into one magnetization direction, we find that time-reversal symmetry is not important for corner states. Our finding indicates that the real-space distribution of atoms determines the feature of higher-order topological insulators for obstructed atomic insulators in TQC.

Title: Diffusion and heat dissipation in marginally stable linear time-delayed Langevin systems
Authors: Xin Wang
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics and heat dissipation in marginally stable linear time-delayed Langevin systems (i.e., the parameters of the system lie on the boundary of the stability conditions). We analytically examine two distinct critical classes: (i) diffusive criticality, where the variance grows linearly with suppressed/enhanced diffusion due to time-delayed forces, and (ii) oscillatory criticality, exhibiting oscillations with diffusing amplitude. Crucially, we derive asymptotic heat dissipation rates, revealing fundamentally different thermodynamic signatures: a constant dissipation rate for diffusive criticality and linear divergence accompanied by oscillations for oscillatory criticality. These results highlight how spectral properties of dynamics govern nonequilibrium thermodynamics in time-delayed systems. Our work bridges dynamics and stochastic thermodynamics at stability boundaries for linear systems, providing foundational insights for extending thermodynamic frameworks to nonlinear time-delayed stochastic systems.

Title: Activation of thermal states by coherently controlled thermalization processes
Authors: Kyrylo Simonov, Saptarshi Roy, Tamal Guha, Zoltán Zimborás, Giulio Chiribella
Abstract: Thermalization processes degrade the states of any working medium, turning any initial state into a passive state from which no work can be extracted. Recently, it has been shown that this degradation can be avoided if two identical thermalization processes take place in coherently controlled order, in a scenario known as the quantum SWITCH. In some situations, control over the order even enables work extraction when the medium was initially in a passive state. This activation phenomenon, however, is subject to a limitation: to extract non-zero work, the initial temperature of the medium should be less than half of the temperature of the reservoirs. Here we analyze this limitation, showing that it still holds true even when the medium interacts with $N\ge 2$ reservoirs in a coherently-controlled order. Then, we show that the limitation can be lifted when the medium and the control systems are initially correlated. In particular, when the medium and control are entangled, work extraction becomes possible for every initial value of the local temperature of the medium.

Abstract: Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) can be employed to understand a wide range of phenomena, from elementary particle scattering in high-energy physics to effective descriptions of many-body interactions in materials. Studying dynamical properties of emergent phases can be challenging as it requires solving many-body problems that are generally beyond perturbative limits. Here, we investigate the dynamics of local excitations in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT using a two-dimensional lattice of superconducting qubits. We first construct a simple variational circuit which prepares low-energy states that have a large overlap with the ground state; then we create charge excitations with local gates and simulate their quantum dynamics via a discretized time evolution. As the electric field coupling constant is increased, our measurements show signatures of transitioning from deconfined to confined dynamics. For confined excitations, the electric field induces a tension in the string connecting them. Our method allows us to experimentally image string dynamics in a (2+1)D LGT from which we uncover two distinct regimes inside the confining phase: for weak confinement the string fluctuates strongly in the transverse direction, while for strong confinement transverse fluctuations are effectively frozen. In addition, we demonstrate a resonance condition at which dynamical string breaking is facilitated. Our LGT implementation on a quantum processor presents a novel set of techniques for investigating emergent excitations and string dynamics.

Title: Preponderant Orbital Polarization in Relativistic Magnetovortical Matter
Authors: Kenji Fukushima, Koichi Hattori, Kazuya Mameda
Abstract: We establish thermodynamic stability and gauge invariance in the magnetovortical matter of Dirac fermions under the coexistent rotation and strong magnetic field. The corresponding partition function reveals that the orbital contribution to bulk thermodynamics preponderates over the conventional contribution from anomaly-related spin effects. This orbital preponderance macroscopically manifests itself in the sign inversion of the induced charge and current in the magnetovortical matter, and can be tested experimentally as the flip of the angular momentum polarization of magnetovortical matter when the magnetic field strength is increased.

Title: Topological data analysis of the deconfinement transition in SU(3) lattice gauge theory
Authors: Daniel Spitz, Julian M. Urban, Jan M. Pawlowski
Abstract: We study the confining and deconfining phases of pure $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ lattice gauge theory with topological data analysis. This provides unique insights into long range correlations of field configurations across the confinement-deconfinement transition. Specifically, we analyze non-trivial structures in electric and magnetic field energy densities as well as Polyakov loop traces and a Polyakov loop-based variant of the topological density. The Betti curves for filtrations based on the electric and magnetic field energy densities reveal signals of electromagnetic dualities. These dualities can be associated with an interchange in the roles of local lumps of electric and magnetic energy densities around the phase transition. Moreover, we show that plaquette susceptibilities can manifest in the geometric features captured by the Betti curves. We also compare these findings against earlier results for $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and elaborate on the significant differences. Our results demonstrate that topological data analysis can identify clear differences between phase transitions of first and second order for non-Abelian lattice gauge theories and provides unprecedented insights into the relevant structures in their vicinity.

Title: A Finite-Time Quantum Otto Engine subject to Control Noise and Enhancement Techniques
Authors: Theodore McKeever, Owen Diba, Ahsan Nazir
Abstract: With the development of any quantum technology comes a need for precise control of quantum systems. Here, we evaluate the impact of control noise on a quantum Otto cycle. Whilst it is postulated that noiseless quantum engines can approach maximal Otto efficiency in finite times, the existence of white noise on the controls is shown to negatively affect average engine performance. Two methods of quantum enhancement, counterdiabatic driving and quantum lubrication, are implemented and found to improve the performance of the noisy cycle only in specified parameter regimes. To gain insight into performance fluctuations, projective energy measurements are used to construct a noise-averaged probability distribution without assuming full thermalisation or adiabaticity. From this, the variances in thermodynamic currents are observed to increase as average power and efficiency improve, and are also shown to be consistent with known bounds from thermodynamic uncertainty relations. Lastly, by comparing the average functioning of the unmonitored engine to a projectively-measured engine cycle, the role of coherence in work extraction for this quantum engine model is investigated.

Title: Binary superfluids: Low-energy properties and dissipative processes from spontaneous emission of massive phonons
Authors: Silvia Trabucco, Luca Lepori, Maria Luisa Chiofalo, Massimo Mannarelli
Abstract: We discuss the low-energy properties of binary superfluids with density-dependent interactions. Adding an intra-species coupling that induces an explicit soft symmetry-breaking, we determine the background pressure and we show that the low-energy spectrum consists of a massless Nambu- Goldstone boson and a massive (pseudo) Nambu-Goldstone boson. When the background velocities of the two superfluids are transonic, the system is characterized by two distinct acoustic horizons: the hydrodynamic analogue of the black hole event horizon. The Hawking-like emission occurring at these horizons produces an effective friction on the fluids. We compute the viscosity-to-entropy ratios close to the two acoustic horizons, finding that the emission of pseudo Nambu-Goldstone bosons violates the bound conjectured by Kovtun, Son and Starinet.

Title: Phase transitions due to Euclidean gravity
Authors: Mustafa Saeed, Diya Batool, Muhammad Muzammil, Nomaan X
Abstract: We use Ising-like models to probe the thermal nature of Euclidean spacetime backgrounds. We determine which properties of the background -- curvature, the presence of a horizon, or temperature -- play a role in phase transitions. The geometries we use are Euclidean Schwarzschild, Rindler, extremal Reissner-Nördstrom (ERN), Anti deSitter (AdS), and deSitter (dS). Among these, Rindler is flat, AdS does not have a horizon, and both AdS and ERN have zero temperatures. We find second-order phase transitions as the metric parameter is varied in all cases except for Rindler. Specifically, we find that the transition from order to disorder occurs as the curvature -- or Euclidean gravity -- increases. This supports our conjecture that Euclidean gravity is an essential ingredient for these phase transitions, as opposed to the presence of a horizon or temperature. Separately, since the selected geometries are position-dependent, the Ising-like models constructed on them are inhomogeneous, whereby they generalize the standard Ising model. We find that a consequence of this is that criticality does not correspond to maximal correlation lengths and scale invariance.

Title: Symmetries of Weyl Superconductors with Different Pairings
Authors: Mehran Z-Abyaneh, Mehrdad Farhoudi, Mahdi Mashkoori
Abstract: We examine the Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian and its symmetries for a time-reversal symmetry broken three dimensional Weyl superconductor. In the limit of vanishing pairing potential, we specify that this Hamiltonian is invariant under two sets of continues symmetries, i.e. the $U(1)$ gauge symmetry and the $U(1)_A$ axial symmetry. Although a pairing of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer type spontaneously breaks both of these symmetries, we show that a Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov type pairing spontaneously breaks only the $U(1)$ gauge symmetry (that is then restored via the well-known scalar phase mode of superconductivity). Consequently, in the former case, two Nambu-Goldstone modes are required in the system to restore the broken symmetries. We indicate that one of these two modes is an emergent pseudo-scalar phase mode. We also demonstrate that such a phase mode leads to a pseudo-Meissner effect.

Title: Generating logical magic states with the aid of non-Abelian topological order
Authors: Sheng-Jie Huang, Yanzhu Chen
Abstract: In fault-tolerant quantum computing with the surface code, non-Clifford gates are crucial for universal computation. However, implementing these gates using methods like magic state distillation and code switching requires significant resources. In this work, we propose a new protocol that combines magic state preparation and code transformation to realize logical non-Clifford operations with the potential for fault tolerance. Our approach begins with a special logical state in the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ surface code. By applying a sequence of transformations, the system goes through different topological codes, including the non-Abelian $D_4$ quantum double model. This process ultimately produces a magic state encoded in the $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ surface code. A logical $T$ gate can be implemented in the standard $\mathbb{Z}_2$ surface code by gate teleportation. In our analysis, we employ a framework where the topological codes are represented by their topological orders and all the transformations are considered as topological manipulations such as gauging symmetries and condensing anyons. This perspective is particularly useful for understanding transformations between topological codes.

Title: Evolution of a kink-antikink ensemble in a quantum vacuum
Authors: Mainak Mukhopadhyay, Kohta Murase, Atsushi Naruko, George Zahariade
Abstract: We study the $1+1$ flat spacetime dynamics of a classical field configuration corresponding to an ensemble of sine-Gordon kinks and antikinks, semi-classically coupled to a quantum field. This coupling breaks the integrability of the sine-Gordon model resulting in the background's decay into quantum radiation as kink-antikink pairs annihilate. We find evidence that, on average, the energy of the ensemble scales as $t^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha<1$ and independent of the coupling strength or the mass of the quantum field. The generalization of this result to domain wall networks in higher spacetime dimensions could be relevant to particle production in the early universe.

Title: Gauge freedoms in unravelled quantum dynamics: When do different continuous measurements yield identical quantum trajectories?
Authors: Calum A. Brown, Katarzyna Macieszczak, Robert L. Jack
Abstract: Quantum trajectories of a Markovian open quantum system arise from the back-action of measurements performed in the environment with which the system interacts. In this work, we consider counting measurements of quantum jumps, corresponding to different representations of the same quantum master equation. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which these different measurements give rise to the same unravelled quantum master equation, which governs the dynamics of the probability distribution over pure conditional states of the system. Since that equation uniquely determines the stochastic dynamics of a conditional state, we also obtain necessary and sufficient conditions under which different measurements result in identical quantum trajectories. We then consider the joint stochastic dynamics for the conditional state and the measurement record. We formulate this in terms of labelled quantum trajectories, and derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which different representations lead to equivalent labelled quantum trajectories, up to permutations of labels. As those conditions are generally stricter, we finish by constructing coarse-grained measurement records, such that equivalence of the corresponding partially-labelled trajectories is guaranteed by equivalence of the trajectories alone. These general results are illustrated by two examples that demonstrate permutation of labels, and equivalence of different quantum trajectories.

Title: Plastic tensor networks for interpretable generative modeling
Authors: Katsuya O. Akamatsu, Kenji Harada, Tsuyoshi Okubo, Naoki Kawashima
Abstract: A structural optimization scheme for a single-layer nonnegative adaptive tensor tree (NATT) that models a target probability distribution is proposed as an alternative paradigm for generative modeling. The NATT scheme, by construction, automatically searches for a tree structure that best fits a given discrete dataset whose features serve as inputs, and has the advantage that it is interpretable as a probabilistic graphical model. We consider the NATT scheme and a recently proposed Born machine adaptive tensor tree (BMATT) optimization scheme and demonstrate their effectiveness on a variety of generative modeling tasks where the objective is to infer the hidden structure of a provided dataset. Our results show that in terms of minimizing the negative log-likelihood, the single-layer scheme has model performance comparable to the Born machine scheme, though not better. The tasks include deducing the structure of binary bitwise operations, learning the internal structure of random Bayesian networks given only visible sites, and a real-world example related to hierarchical clustering where a cladogram is constructed from mitochondrial DNA sequences. In doing so, we also show the importance of the choice of network topology and the versatility of a least-mutual information criterion in selecting a candidate structure for a tensor tree, as well as discuss aspects of these tensor tree generative models including their information content and interpretability.

Title: Swinging small quantum systems out of available values of control parameters
Authors: Xikun Li, Tomasz Sowiński
Abstract: When a quantum system is prepared in its many-body ground state, it can be adiabatically driven to another ground state by changing its control parameter. However, relying on adiabaticity is experimentally unjustified. Moreover, the target value of the control parameter may occur outside the experimentally accessible range. The indicated target state, however, can still be reached within a clever protocol of temporal changes of the control parameter provided its decomposition into some basis is known. It turns out that such a protocol can be obtained in the framework of the optimal control theory. In this paper, we show how to apply such an optimization scheme to small quantum systems treating interaction strength as the control parameter. We believe that the proposed approach can be creatively extended to various complex quantum systems.

Title: Fault-tolerant protocols through spacetime concatenation
Authors: Yichen Xu, Arpit Dua
Abstract: We introduce a framework called spacetime concatenation for fault-tolerant compilation of syndrome extraction circuits of stabilizer codes. Spacetime concatenation enables efficient compilation of syndrome extraction circuits into dynamical codes through structured gadget layouts and encoding matrices, facilitating low-weight measurements while preserving logical information. Our framework uses conditions that are sufficient for fault-tolerance of the dynamical code, including not measuring logical operators and preserving the spacetime distance. We construct explicit examples of dynamical codes using this framework, including the dynamical bivariate bicycle code and a dynamical Haah code, while illustrating their fault-tolerant properties. Furthermore, we analyze the classification and resource trade-offs of dynamical codes, demonstrating their adaptability to hardware constraints, including fabrication defects and qubit dropout scenarios.

Title: Free Probability approach to spectral and operator statistics in Rosenzweig-Porter random matrix ensembles
Authors: Viktor Jahnke, Pratik Nandy, Kuntal Pal, Hugo A. Camargo, Keun-Young Kim
Abstract: Utilizing the framework of free probability, we analyze the spectral and operator statistics of the Rosenzweig-Porter random matrix ensembles, which exhibit a rich phase structure encompassing ergodic, fractal, and localized regimes. Leveraging subordination formulae, we develop a perturbative scheme that yields semi-analytic expressions for the density of states up to second order in system size, in good agreement with numerical results. We compute higher-point correlation functions in the ergodic regime using both numerical and suitable analytic approximations. Our analysis of operator statistics for various spin operators across these regimes reveals close agreement with free probability predictions in the ergodic phase, in contrast to persistent deviations observed in the fractal and localized phases, even at late times. Notably, the fractal phase exhibits partial freeness while retaining memory of the initial spectrum, highlighting the importance of non-localized eigenstates and associated with the late-time dynamics of cumulative out-of-time-ordered-correlators (OTOCs). Employing distance measures and statistical tools such as the $\chi^2$ statistic, Kullback-Leibler divergence, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov hypothesis testing, we define a characteristic time scale-the free time-that marks the onset of the validity of free probability predictions for operator spectral statistics in the ergodic phase. Remarkably, our findings demonstrate consistency across these different approaches.
