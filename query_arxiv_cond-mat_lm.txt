Title: A non-perturbative framework for N-point functions of locally non-Gaussian fields
Authors: Hardi Veermäe
Abstract: We present a non-perturbative approach to correlation functions and polyspectra of locally non-Gaussian fields and develop a simple semi-perturbative framework that does not rely on the local expansion. As an example, we apply it to locally non-Gaussian fields possessing exponential tails and derive some exact analytic results in the strongly non-Gaussian limit.

Title: Generalized Kramers-Wannier Self-Duality in Hopf-Ising Models
Authors: Da-Chuan Lu, Arkya Chatterjee, Nathanan Tantivasadakarn
Abstract: The Kramers-Wannier transformation of the 1+1d transverse-field Ising model exchanges the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases and, at criticality, manifests as a non-invertible symmetry. Extending such self-duality symmetries beyond gauging of abelian groups in tensor-product Hilbert spaces has, however, remained challenging. In this work, we construct a generalized 1+1d Ising model based on a finite-dimensional semisimple Hopf algebra $H$ that enjoys an anomaly-free non-invertible symmetry $\mathrm{Rep}(H)$. We provide an intuitive diagrammatic formulation of both the Hamiltonian and the symmetry operators using a non-(co)commutative generalization of ZX-calculus built from Hopf-algebraic data. When $H$ is self-dual, we further construct a generalized Kramers-Wannier duality operator that exchanges the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases and becomes a non-invertible symmetry at the self-dual point. This enlarged symmetry mixes with lattice translation and, in the infrared, flows to a weakly integral fusion category given by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ extension of $\mathrm{Rep}(H)$. Specializing to the Kac-Paljutkin algebra $H_8$, the smallest self-dual Hopf algebra beyond abelian group algebras, we numerically study the phase diagram and identify four of the six $\mathrm{Rep}(H_8)$-symmetric gapped phases, separated by Ising critical lines and meeting at a multicritical point. We also realize all six $\mathrm{Rep}(H_8)$-symmetric gapped phases on the lattice via the $H$-comodule algebra formalism, in agreement with the module-category classification of $\mathrm{Rep}(H_8)$. Our results provide a unified Hopf-algebraic framework for non-invertible symmetries, dualities, and the tensor product lattice models that realize them.

Title: Semiclassical Routes to the $α$-RuCl$_3$ Scattering Continuum via Model Meta$-$Analysis
Authors: Chaebin Kim, Martin Mourigal
Abstract: $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ is a leading material for proximate Kitaev magnetism. We address the origin of the broad, $\Gamma$-point centered excitation continuum observed by inelastic neutron scattering at elevated temperatures in this compound. Using stochastic Landau-Lifshitz dynamics augmented with quantum-equivalent corrections, we reproduce the temperature-dependent dynamical spin structure factor across both the correlated and conventional paramagnetic regimes. A meta-analysis of 38 published exchange parameter sets identifies those most consistent with the full temperature evolution. A Bayesian optimization procedure is used to derive parameters that capture the low-energy star-like momentum dependence and the overall bandwidth of the continuum. Rescaling temperatures by the Curie--Weiss scale produces a collapse of spectral measures, demonstrating that the high-$T$ dynamics are governed by correlated paramagnetism below $\theta_{\mathrm{CW}}$ rather than by the Kitaev crossover to fractionalized excitations. Complementary 24-site exact diagonalization clarifies finite-size systematics at low temperature and the proximity to zigzag/incommensurate ordering. Beyond $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, our simulation pipeline provides a reproducible, data-driven framework to infer effective spin models in magnets that exhibit broad continua.

Title: A web of exact mappings from RK models to spin chains
Authors: Gurkirat Singh, Inti Sodemann
Abstract: We study Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) dimer and spin ice models realizing $U(1)$-lattice gauge theories in a wide class of quasi-one-dimensional settings, which define a setup for the study of few quantum strings (closed electric field lines) interacting with themselves and each other. We discover a large collection of mappings of these models onto three quantum chains: the spin-1/2 XXZ chain, a spin-1 chain, and a kinetically constrained fermion chain whose configurations are best described in terms of tilings of a rectangular strip. We show that the twist of boundary conditions in the chains maps onto the transverse momentum of the electric field string, and their Drude weight to the inverse of the string mass per unit length. We numerically determine the phase diagrams for these spin chains, employing DMRG simulations and find global similarities but also many interesting new features in comparison to the full 2D problems. For example, the spin-1 chain we obtain features a continuous family of degenerate ground states at its RK point analogous to a Bloch sphere, but without an underlying microscopic global $SU(2)$ symmetry. We also argue for the existence of a (stable) Landau-forbidden gapless critical point away from the RK point in one of the models we study using bosonization and numerics. This is surprising given that the full 2D problem is generically gapped away from the RK point. The same model also displays extensively many local conserved quantities which fragment the Hilbert space, arising as a consequence of destructive resonances between the electric field lines. Our findings highlight spin-chain mappings as a potent technique for the exploration of unusual dynamics, exotic criticality, and low-energy physics in lattice gauge theories.

Title: Computational discovery of cathode materials for rechargeable aqueous zinc-ion batteries
Authors: Caio Miranda Miliante, Brian D. Adams, Drew Higgins, Oleg Rubel
Abstract: Rechargeable aqueous zinc-ion batteries (RAZIBs) attract considerable scientific and commercial interest for deployment in grid-scale energy storage due to higher safety and lower manufacturing cost when compared to lithium-ion batteries. However, currently studied cathode materials suffer from severe capacity fade when cycling at rates appropriate for grid-scale applications ($<$ C/2), which hampers the commercialization of RAZIBs. To address the present limitation on cathode material availability, more than 2000 previously synthesized oxides, chalcogenides, Prussian blue analogues, and polyanion materials were computationally screened for the discovery of highly stable RAZIB cathode materials. The structural, electrochemical, and chemical properties of the materials were respectively evaluated through an investigation of the available Zn$^{2+}$ percolation paths in the crystal structure, the stability of the material in aqueous media under RAZIB operation conditions, and the attained transition metal oxidation state during cycling. The transition metal oxidation state and intercalating ion coordination environment were determined to govern the magnitude of the calculated intercalation potential, with this finding directly supporting the development of batteries with high operation potentials. Finally, 10 previously unexplored materials were identified with leading metrics for operation as RAZIB cathode materials, such as high Zn$^{2+}$ (de)intercalation potential, electrochemical stability, theoretical gravimetric capacity, and energy density, being here proposed for experimental testing. The materials identified in this study demonstrate a guide for advancing the available cathode materials for RAZIB, and help expedite the establishment of RAZIB as a commercially viable technology for grid-scale energy storage.

Title: Whodunnit? The case of midge swarms
Authors: L. L. Bonilla, R. González-Albaladejo
Abstract: As collective states of animal groups go, swarms of midge insects pose a number of puzzling questions. Their ordering polarization parameter is quite small and the insects are weakly coupled among themselves but strongly coupled to the swarm. In laboratory studies (free of external perturbations), the correlation length is small, whereas midge swarms exhibit strong correlations, scale free behavior and power laws for correlation length, susceptibility and correlation time in field studies. Data for the dynamic correlation function versus time collapse to a single curve only for small values of time scaled with the correlation time. Is there a theory that explains these disparate observations? Among the existing theories, whodunnit? Here we review and discuss several models proposed in the literature and extend our own one, the harmonically confined Vicsek model, to anisotropic confinement. Numerical simulations of the latter produce elongated swarm shapes and values of the static critical exponents between those of the two dimensional and isotropic three dimensional models. The new values agree better with those measured in natural swarms.

Title: Cyclic active refrigerators
Authors: S. Liu, A. Datta, A. C. Barato
Abstract: Thermodynamic cycles are idealized processes that can convert heat into work or produce heat flow against a temperature gradient with the input of work. They remain an active area of research in modern stochastic thermodynamics. In particular, cyclic active heat engines have been shown to display a rich phenomenology, such as ``violations'' of the Carnot bound on efficiency and an improved performance in comparison to their passive counterparts. We introduce the concept of cyclic active refrigerators using a previously derived second law for cyclic active systems. We show that for cyclic active refrigerators, a naive definition of the coefficient of performance can exceed the bound set by the standard second law for passive refrigerators. We also show that cyclic active systems can behave like a Maxwell's demon, with heat flowing from the cold to the hot reservoir without any work input. Beyond this phase, cyclic active systems can enter a hybrid phase, functioning as both a heat engine and a refrigerator simultaneously. Our results are obtained with two models that involve active Brownian particles, a simpler one that allows for analytical results and a more realistic one that is analyzed through numerical simulations.

Title: Atomically-sharp magnetic soliton in the square-net lattice EuRhAl$_{4}$Si$_{2}$
Authors: Kevin Allen, Juba Bouaziz, Yichen Zhang, Kai Du, Sanu Mishra, Gustav Bihlmayer, Yiqing Hao, Victor Ukleev, Chen Luo, Florin Radu, Yuxiang Gao, Marta Zonno, Sergey Gorovikov, Christopher Lane, Jian-Xin Zhu, Huibo Cao, Sang-Wook Cheong, Ming Yi, Stefan Blügel, Emilia Morosan
Abstract: Topological spin textures are hallmark manifestations of competing interactions in magnetic matter. Their effective description by nonlinear field theories reflects an energetic frustration that destabilizes uniform order while selecting finite-size, topologically nontrivial configurations as stationary states. Among the most extreme realizations are atomically-sharp domain wall excitations, namely one-dimensional (1D) magnetic solitons, which represent the ultimate scaling limit of magnetic textures. Such solitons may emerge in magnetic systems where effective exchange interactions compete directly with uniaxial magnetic anisotropy. Here we show that the square-net rare earth compound EuRhAl$_{4}$Si$_{2}$ realizes a very susceptible regime where the magnetic anisotropy competes with highly frustrated exchange interactions stabilizing a rare ferrimagnetic $\uparrow\uparrow\downarrow$ state that, under applied magnetic field, supports the formation of atomically-sharp soliton defects. We confirm the bulk response of the 1D magnetic solitons via magnetization and electrical transport measurements. We establish both the zero- and in-field $\uparrow\uparrow\downarrow$ order via neutron diffraction, while magnetic force microscopy visualizes its real-space evolution into a stripe-like array. To elucidate the microscopic origin of the soliton, we relate the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY)-driven exchange interactions and the magnetic anisotropy through density functional theory, and we construct an effective 1D $J_{1}$-$J_{2}$-$K$ model whose atomistic spin dynamics simulations reproduce the observed soliton states as a function of external field. Our results demonstrate that EuRhAl$_{4}$Si$_{2}$ hosts atomically-sharp, field-driven 1D magnetic solitons, providing a new platform for studying 1D topological excitations at the atomic length scale.

Title: What is active wetting?
Authors: Uwe Thiele
Abstract: In recent years the term \textit{active wetting} has gained some traction in works describing, analyzing and modeling a wide variety of wetting phenomena, for instance, in the contexts of biomolecular condensates, of cell layers or cell aggregates, and of active Brownian particles. The present perspective proposes a coarse classification of wetting phenomena including a tentative definition of active wetting. First, different categories of static and dynamic wetting of passive liquids are briefly discussed, in particular, distinguishing equilibrium wetting, relaxational wetting, driven wetting, and reactive wetting. Second, an overview is given of the various phenomena recently described as active wetting. We conclude by discussing a possible definition of active wetting together with a number of caveats one might want to keep in mind when using such classifications.

Title: Chiral states induced by symmetry-breaking in $α-T_3$ lattices: Magnetic field effect
Authors: J. P. G. Nascimento, J. M. Pereira Jr., R. N. Costa Filho, F. M. Peeters, M. M. Freire, W. P. Lima, D. R. da Costa
Abstract: The sublattice-symmetry breaking in the $\alpha-T_3$ lattice leads to a bandgap opening. A defect line in the substrate on which the $\alpha-T_3$ lattice is deposited can be viewed as a topological change in the substrate that induces translational in-plane symmetry breaking, resulting in mid-gap states. These topologically protected states are confined along the defect line and exhibit preferential directional motion, with different signs for the different Dirac valleys. Within this context, we investigate how these unidirectional interface chiral states are affected in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field and how they can be tuned by varying the controlling system parameter $\alpha$. The latter tunes the $\alpha-T_3$ structure from a honeycomb-like lattice ($\alpha=0$) to a dice lattice ($\alpha=1$). Our theoretical framework is based on the continuum approximation described by a $3\times 3$ matrix Hamiltonian with a sublattice symmetry-breaking term given by $\Delta(x) diag(1,\quad -1,\quad 1)$, assuming $\Delta(x)$ as a kink-like mass potential profile. Results for dispersion relations and wavefunction distributions for different $\alpha$ parameters and magnetic field amplitudes are discussed. We demonstrate lifting of Landau levels degeneracy and of valley degeneracy. Our findings pave the way for proposing valley filter devices based on any evolutionary stage between the honeycomb-like and dice lattice structures of the $\alpha-T_3$ phase, controlled by external fields.

Title: Device Applications of Heterogeneously Integrated Strain-Switched Ferrimagnets/Topological Insulator/Piezoelectric Stacks
Authors: Supriyo Bandyopadhyay
Abstract: A family of ferrimagnets (CoV2O4, GdCo, TbCo) exhibits out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy when strained compressively and in-plane magnetic anisotropy when strained expansively (or vice versa). If such a ferrimagnetic thin film is placed on top of a topological insulator (TI) thin film and its magnetic anisotropy is modulated with strain, then interfacial exchange coupling between the ferrimagnet (FM) and the underlying TI will modulate the surface current flowing through the latter. If the strain is varied continuously, the current will also vary continuously and if the strain alternates in time, the current will also alternate with the frequency of the strain modulation, as long as the frequency is not so high that the period is smaller than the switching time of the FM. If the strain is generated with a gate voltage by integrating a piezoelectric underneath the FM/TI stack, then that can implement a transconductance amplifier or a synapse for neuromorphic computation.

Title: Possible Proximity to Ferromagnetism in the V$_2$Ga$_5$ Superconductor
Authors: Szymon Królak, Xudong Huai, Wiktoria Jarosz, Filip Košuth, Pavol Szabó, Michał J. Winiarski, Sudip Malick, Thao T. Tran, Tomasz Klimczuk
Abstract: Superconductivity and ferromagnetism are generally competing ground states in $d$-electron systems, making their interplay of fundamental interest. We report a comprehensive study of high-quality single- and polycrystalline V$_2$Ga$_5$, a bulk type-II superconductor ($T_c = 3.54 \ K$) with a quasi-one-dimensional crystal structure, supplemented with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, suggesting possible proximity to ferromagnetic order. Below $T \approx 10 \ K$, magnetic susceptibility shows ZFC/FC splitting, along with saturation and hysteresis in $M(H)$. Moreover, electrical transport measurements reveal a magnetic-field-dependent resistivity upturn, while specific heat is enhanced in magnetic fields. DFT calculations show that the Fermi level in V$_2$Ga$_5$ is located at a peak in the density of states, with a small magnetic moment per unit cell comparable to the experimental value. Together, these results indicate the possibility that ferromagnetic correlations develop below $T \approx 10 \ K$, well above $T_c$, with long-range ferromagnetic order suppressed by the superconducting transition.

Title: Benchmarking of Massively Parallel Phase-Field Codes for Directional Solidification
Authors: Jiefu Tian, David Montiel, Kaihua Ji, Trevor Lyons, Jason Landini, Katsuyo Thornton, Alain Karma
Abstract: We present a detailed benchmark comparing two state-of-the-art phase-field implementations for simulating alloy solidification under experimentally relevant conditions. The study investigates the directional solidification of Al-3wt%Cu under additive manufacturing conditions and SCN-0.46wt% camphor under microgravity conditions from National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) DECLIC-DSI-R experiments. Both codes, one employing finite-difference discretization with uniform mesh and GPU-acceleration and the other one employing finite-element discretization with adaptive-mesh and CPU-parallelization, solve the same quantitative phase-field formulation that incorporates an anti-trapping current for the solidification of dilute alloys. We evaluate the predictions of each code for dendritic morphology, primary spacing, and tip dynamics in both 2D and 3D, as well as their numerical convergence and computational performance. While existing benchmark problems have primarily focused on simplified or small-scale simulations, they do not reflect the computational and modeling challenges posed by employing experimentally relevant time and length scales. Our results provide a practical framework for assessing phase-field code performance as well as validating and facilitating their application in integrated computational materials engineering (ICME) workflows that require integration with realistic experimental data.

Title: Superconductivity in strongly correlated systems for local repulsive interactions
Authors: Humberto M. Silva, Francisco Dinola Neto, Griffith M. A. R., Minos A. Neto, Octavio D. R. Salmon, Mucio A. Continentino, Amos Troper
Abstract: The understanding of the mechanisms responsible for superconductivity in strongly correlated systems is an interesting and important subject in condensed matter physics. Several theoretical proposals were considered for these systems. The Coulomb interaction between electrons allow a new approach to study this problem. In this paper, we use a usual Hubbard model with a local repulsive interaction to describe a 2D system. The system of equations are solved using the Green's functions method, within a Hubbard-I mean field approximation, which allows to treat the strong interaction limit. We consider both cases of attractive and repulsive interactions and obtain the zero temperature phase diagram of the model. Our results show, in the repulsive case, the existence of a superconducting ground state mediated by the kinetic electronic energy and described by a non-local order parameter. A minimum value of the repulsive interaction $U_{min}$ is required to create a pairing state. At finite temperatures, for strong interactions, the critical temperature $T_c$ shows a saturation similar to the Bose-Einstein condensation observed for strong attractive interactions.

Title: Self-pinning mechanism for grain boundary stabilization
Authors: Omar Hussein, Yuri Mishin
Abstract: Previous research focused on two different mechanisms of microstructure stabilization in alloys: thermodynamic stabilization by reducing the grain boundary (GB) free energy and kinetic stabilization by suppressing the GB mobility by solute drag or embedded pinning particles. Here, we propose a new GB stabilization mechanism, called self-pinning, in which the segregation atmosphere of a moving GB spontaneously breaks into solute-rich clusters, which produce a strong pinning effect in addition to the free energy reduction resulting from the segregation. The cluster formation is caused by strong solute-solute attraction at GBs, leading to a first-order transformation between solute-lean and solute-rich GB phases. The effect is demonstrated by kinetic Monte Carlo simulations capturing segregation thermodynamics, GB dynamics, and solute diffusion. The self-pinning provides an intrinsic stabilization mechanism for suppressing grain growth that couples thermodynamics and kinetics. The mechanism obviates the need for pre-existing second phase inclusions, refocusing the alloy design on GB phase behavior.

Title: Properties of Bose-Einstein condensates with altermagnetism
Authors: Jia Wang, Zhao Liu, Xia-Ji Liu, Hui Hu
Abstract: We investigate a weakly interacting two-component Bose--Einstein condensate in the miscible regime in the presence of \emph{altermagnetism}, i.e., a collinear and globally compensated magnetic order that breaks spin-rotation symmetry while maintaining zero net magnetization. Within Bogoliubov theory, we derive the quasiparticle spectrum and coherence factors and show that altermagnetic order generically induces an angular dependence of the low-energy excitations. As a result, the sound velocity, momentum-resolved magnetization in the quantum depletion, and density--spin response functions acquire anisotropic components. We show that these anisotropic contributions vanish after angular averaging, consistent with the defining feature of altermagnetism: nontrivial local spin polarization without a global magnetization. Finally, we evaluate the Lee--Huang--Yang correction to the ground-state energy in the altermagnetic phase. Our results should be testable with ultracold-atom experiments in the foreseeable future.

Title: Biaxial Strain Control of Helimagnetism via Chemical Expansion in Thin Film SrFeO3
Authors: Jennifer Fowlie, Jiarui Li, Danilo Puggioni, Lucas Barreto, Lin Ding Yuan, James M. Rondinelli, Ronny Sutarto, Teak D. Boyko, Fabio Orlandi, Pascal Manuel, Dmitry Khalyavin, Eder G. Lomeli, Brian Moritz, Thomas P. Devereaux, Skyler Koroluk, Robert J. Green, Steven J. May, Harold Y. Hwang
Abstract: We demonstrate control of helimagnetic order in biaxially strained SrFeO3 thin films using neutron diffraction and resonant soft x-ray scattering. SrFeO3, a negative charge-transfer oxide, exhibits a complex magnetic phase diagram that includes multi-q spin structures. Tensile epitaxial strain produces a pronounced shortening of the helimagnetic ordering length and a tilting of the magnetic ordering vector. We interpret this behavior in terms of chemical expansion: lattice dilation under tensile strain lowers the energetic cost of oxygen vacancies, leading to an expanded unit cell that modifies Fe-O hybridization and enhances superexchange relative to double exchange. These results reveal how epitaxial strain can indirectly tune helimagnetism through defect-driven chemical expansion, highlighting the strong coupling between lattice, chemistry, and magnetic order in transition-metal oxides. Our findings establish chemical expansion as an effective mechanism for engineering complex magnetic textures in oxide thin films, with implications for spintronic, magnonic, and quantum information applications.

Title: Morphological instability of an invasive active-passive interface
Authors: Sumit Sinha, Haiqian Yang, L Mahadevan
Abstract: Morphological instabilities of growing tissues that impinge on passive materials are typical of invasive cancers. To explain these instabilities in experiments on breast epithelial spheroids in an extracellular matrix, we develop a continuum phase field model of a growing active liquid expanding into a passive viscoelastic matrix. Linear stability analysis of the sharp-interface limit of the governing equations predicts that the tissue interface can develops long-wavelength instabilities, but these instabilities are suppressed when the active carcinoid is embedded in an elastic matrix. We develop a theoretical morphological phase diagram, and complement these with two-dimensional finite element (FEM) phase-field simulations to track the nonlinear evolution of the interface with results consistent with theoretical predictions and experimental observations. Our study provides a basis for the emergence of interfacial instabilities in active-passive systems with the potential to control them.

Title: Linear thermal noise induced by Berry curvature dipole in a four-terminal system
Authors: Wenyu Chen, Miaomiao Wei, Yunjin Yu, Fuming Xu, Jian Wang
Abstract: In this work, we numerically investigate linear thermal noise in a four-terminal system with a finite Berry curvature dipole (BCD) using the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism. By comparing with the semiclassical results for bulk systems, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between terminal-resolved linear noise in multi-terminal systems and direction-resolved noise in bulk transport. Specifically, the auto-correlation function scales as $2 k_B T$ when the driving field is perpendicular to the BCD and vanishes when they are parallel, whereas the cross-correlation scales as $k_B T$. Both the auto- and cross-correlation functions exhibit pronounced peaks near the band edges, consistent with BCD-induced features. In addition, the linear thermal noise increases approximately linearly with $T$ at low temperatures and is suppressed by dephasing effect at high temperatures. Our work bridges semiclassical bulk theory and quantum multi-terminal theory for linear thermal noise, highlighting the symmetry(geometry)-selection rule in quantum transport.

Title: Excitons in van der Waals magnetic materials
Authors: Pratap Chandra Adak, Florian Dirnberger, Swagata Acharya, Akashdeep Kamra, Xiaodong Xu, Vinod M. Menon
Abstract: Two-dimensional magnetic semiconductors provide a unique materials platform in which long-range magnetic order coexists with strongly bound excitons. Because excitonic states and magnetic moments originate from the same electronic orbitals and are coupled through intrinsic exchange interactions, optical excitations in these systems exhibit pronounced sensitivity to magnetic order. Recent experiments have revealed unusually strong magneto-optical responses, as well as direct coupling between excitons and magnons, establishing new routes for controlling light-matter interactions with spin degrees of freedom. This Review surveys key developments in the field, focusing on representative material systems, experimental signatures of exciton-magnetism coupling, and the theoretical frameworks used to describe these phenomena. We conclude with perspectives on how this rapidly evolving field could enable next-generation optoelectronic and quantum technologies leveraging the coupled dynamics of light, charge, and spin.

Title: Moire driven edge reconstruction in Fractional quantum anomalous Hall states
Authors: Feng Liu, Hoi Chun Po, Xueyang Song
Abstract: We investigate fractional edge modes in moire fractional quantum anomalous Hall states, focusing on the role of lattice momentum conservation and umklapp scattering. For the hierarchical nu=2/3 state, we show that, for a class of microscopic edge realizations, moire-enabled umklapp processes can stabilize the Kane-Fisher-Polchinski fixed point even in the absence of this http URL results illustrate how lattice momentum constraints can qualitatively reshape the interaction structure and low-energy behavior of fractional edge modes. The study of Umklapp processes in edge reconstruction serves as a crucial bridge to understanding thermal and electrical transport in the hierarchical fractional quantum anomalous Hall states found in lattice systems of quantum simulators.

Title: Dispersive detection of a charge qubit with a broadband high-impedance quantum-Hall plasmon resonator
Authors: Chaojing Lin, Kosei Teshima, Takafumi Akiho, Koji Muraki, Toshimasa Fujisawa
Abstract: Cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) provides strong light-matter interactions that can be used for manipulating and detecting quantum states. The interaction can be enhanced by increasing the resonator's impedance, while approaching the quantum impedance ($h/e^2$) remains challenging. Edge plasmons emergent as chiral bosonic modes in the quantum Hall channels provide high quantized impedance of $h/ \nu e^2$ that can exceed 10 k$\Omega$ for the Landau-level filling factor $\nu \leq 2$, well beyond the impedance of free space. Here, we apply such a high-impedance plasmon mode in a quantum-Hall plasmon resonator to demonstrate dispersive detection of a nearby charge qubit formed in a double quantum dot. The phase shift in microwave transmission through the plasmon resonator follows the dispersive shift associated with the qubit state in agreement with the cQED theory. The high impedance allows us to perform dispersive detection of qubit spectroscopy with a plasmon resonator having a broad bandwidth. Leveraging these topological edge modes, our results establish two-dimensional topological insulators as a new platform of cQED.

Title: Defect structures and transitions in active nematic membranes
Authors: Yuki Hirota, Nariya Uchida
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of active nematic liquid crystals on deformable membranes, focusing on the interplay between active stress and anisotropic curvature coupling. Using a minimal model, we simulate the coupled evolution of the nematic order parameter and membrane height. We demonstrate a continuous transition from a curvature-dominated regime, where topological defects are trapped by local deformation, to an activity-dominated regime exhibiting active turbulence. A scaling analysis reveals that the critical activity threshold $\zeta_c$ scales as $\alpha^2/\kappa$, where $\alpha$ and $\kappa$ are the coupling constant and bending stiffness, respectively; this relationship is confirmed by our numerical results. Furthermore, we find that significant correlations between the orientational pattern and membrane geometry persist even in the turbulent regime. Specifically, we identify that "walls" in the director field induce characteristic wave-like curvature profiles, providing a mechanism for dynamic coupling between order and shape. These results offer a physical framework for understanding defect-mediated deformation in nonequilibrium biological membranes.

Title: Probing Plasmonic Oscillations in 2D Moiré Nanocrystal Superlattices by Low-Loss EELS
Authors: Swarnendu Das, Shengsong Yang, Kevin N. Moser, Marc R. Bourgeois, Quentin M. Ramasse, David J. Masiello, Christopher B. Murray, Eric A. Stach
Abstract: Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) has been established as a powerful analytical technique for investigating the oxidation state, band structure, and dielectric properties of materials with exceptional spatial resolution. Inspired by twisted 2D materials, we utilize low-loss EELS to examine the plasmonic excitations in 2D moiré Au nanocrystal superlattices (NCSLs) formed by liquid-air interface self-assembly using a double-dipping method. This approach produces stacked hexagonal layers that can be twisted, forming moiré patterns in NCSLs whose twist angles are precisely measured via scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). Low-loss EELS effectively mitigates challenges arising from fabrication-induced non-uniformity and reveals a blue shift in plasmonic excitation when comparing single-layer, double-layer, and twisted configurations. This sharply contrasts with the optical spectroscopy measurements, which show an overall red shift relative to the EELS data. The high spatial resolution of STEM-EELS further demonstrates that twist-induced symmetry breaking strongly influences plasmonic behavior. Coupled dipole modeling explains the observed discrepancies: the electron beam excites out-of-plane polarization modes unavailable to optical probes, while optical measurements average over ensembles. Our findings highlight that EELS provides complementary information to optical spectroscopy for understanding how structural arrangements at the nanoscale influence collective electronic properties, advancing the design of plasmonic metamaterials.

Title: Ferroelectric Quantum Point Contact in Twisted Transition Metal Dichalcogenides
Authors: Wei Ren, Shiyu Guo, Daochen Long, Noah Friedman, Jingyuan Xian, David Li, Jack Tavakley, Jeongsoo Park, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Ke Wang
Abstract: In twisted transition metal dichalcogenides (tTMDs), atomic reconstruction gives rise to moiré domains with alternating ferroelectric polarization, whose domain size and overall electric dipole moment are tunable by an out-of-plane electric field. Previous transport measurements in Hall bar devices have successfully demonstrated the overall ferroelectric behavior of tTMDs from a collective ensemble of ferroelectric moiré domains. To locally probe a single ferroelectric moiré domain, we fabricate and study mesoscopic quantum transport via a gate-defined twisted molybdenum disulfide (tMoS2) quantum point contact (QPC). The local property of a single moiré domain is invulnerable to long-range disorder and twist-angle inhomogeneity, resulting in an unusually long conductance plateau with large electrical hysteresis. The comparison between local and global measurements confirms that antiferroelectricity can emerge from alternating polarization of individual ferroelectric domains. Using a QPC as a single charge sensor, we characterize the nature and time scale of different domain evolution mechanisms with single atomic dipole resolution. Our findings shed new light on the microscopic ferroelectric behavior and dynamics within a single tTMD moiré domain, paving the way toward more advanced ferroelectric quantum devices with tunable local Hamiltonian, such as ferroelectric tTMD quantum dots (QDs).

Title: Thermodynamic Optimization of Sensory Adaptation via Game-Theoretic Path Integrals
Authors: Gunn Kim
Abstract: Biological sensory systems, from \textit{E.~coli} chemotaxis to sensory neurons in \textit{C.~elegans}, achieve reliable adaptation over wide dynamic ranges despite operating in strongly noisy and overdamped regimes. Here, we present a field-theoretic framework in which sensory adaptation emerges from a variational free-energy principle, formulated as a stochastic differential game between an organism and its environment. Using an Onsager--Machlup path-integral formalism, we show that the resulting adaptive dynamics are mathematically equivalent to a class of model reference adaptive control schemes and can be interpreted as a dynamic renormalization of the system's Green's function. Within this framework, the phasic overshoot commonly observed in sensory responses arises naturally from an effective inertia ($m^* \approx \tau \gamma$) generated by memory-dissipation coupling, rather than from biochemical fine-tuning. Quantitative fits to experimental data across species yield $R^2 > 0.88$, and indicate that adaptive sensory processing operates within a narrow thermodynamically optimal regime bounded by signal-to-noise and stability constraints.

Title: Interplay of ion availability and mobility in the loss of cation selectivity for CaCl\textsubscript{2} in negatively charged nanopores: molecular dynamics using scaled-charge models
Authors: Salman Shabbir, Dezső Boda, Zoltán Ható
Abstract: Ion transport through charged nanopores is commonly interpreted in terms of electrical double layer structure, leading to the expectation of cation-selective conduction in negatively charged pores. This picture can break down for multivalent electrolytes, where strong ion-urface correlations and charge inversion modify transport behavior. Here, we study NaCl and CaCl$_2$ conduction through negatively charged silica nanopores using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations with scaled-charge ion models. By separating concentration and velocity contributions to the radial particle current density, we connect static adsorption to dynamic perm-selectivity. While NaCl exhibits conventional cation selectivity, CaCl$_2$ shows nearly bulk-like or even anion-favored transport due to Ca$^{2+}$ immobilization near the surface and dominant Cl$^-$ conduction in the pore interior following charge inversion. Although this qualitative mechanism is robust, its detailed manifestation depends sensitively on the balance of ion-surface and ion-water interactions encoded in the force field.

Abstract: One of the long standing puzzles in strongly correlated materials is the microscopic origin of the quantum critical Planckian strange metal phase with universal linear in temperature scattering rate from which unconventional superconductivity directly emerges by lowering temperatures. Recently, the linear in temperature and linear in field resistivity have been simultaneously observed in high temperature cuprate superconductors, manifested by the universal field to temperature scaling in magnetoresistivity. To date, there has been a lack of coherent and unified understanding of these coexisting linear behaviors and their possible link to quantum criticality. In this work, we establish the universality in linear in temperature and linear in field Planckian behaviors in underdoped LSCO near optimal doping. Experimentally, we observe the linear in field Planckian scattering rate and its relation to its linear in temperature counterpart. Theoretically, we propose a spin based common microscopic mechanism based on Kondo-like charge fluctuations near local quantum criticality of heavy fermion formulated tJ model subject to a Zeeman term. Similar to frequency to temperature scaling near quantum criticality, we find the magnetic field here effectively introduces a Zeeman energy, reminiscent of an external energy in the quantum critical regime, leading to field to temperature scaling. Our analytically predicted universal field to temperature scaling in isotropic scattering rate and the relation between the linear in temperature and linear in field Planckian coefficients, unifies these two phenomena over an extended doping range, pointing toward a unified quantum-critical origin of Planckian transport in cuprates.

Title: Antiferroaxial altermagnetism
Authors: Yichen Liu, Cheng-Cheng Liu
Abstract: The antiferroaxial state is emerging as an important ferroic order in condensed matter systems. Here, we establish antiferroaxial altermagnetism as a broadly prevalent, generic, and microscopically grounded multiferroic mechanism, in which antiferroaxial counter-rotating distortions both induce altermagnetism and enable its deterministic and reversible switching. Within a unified Landau-theory and symmetry framework, we identify a symmetry-allowed trilinear invariant coupling the antiferroaxial order, the Néel vector, and the altermagnetic order, and derive general symmetry criteria for its occurrence. This coupling locks the induced altermagnetism to the antiferroaxial order, so that reversing the latter reverses the spin splitting and associated time-reversal-odd responses, such as anomalous Hall conductivity. We provide a practical spin group dictionary mapping Néel-vector representations to the resulting $d$-, $g$-, and $i$-wave antiferroaxial altermagnetism, validate the mechanism with ligand-rotation tight-binding models and first-principles calculations, and identify many candidate materials by screening the MAGNDATA and C2DB databases. Our results elevate antiferroaxiality to a universal ferroic control knob for structurally programmable altermagnetic spintronics.

Title: Nonlinear dynamics in magnonic Fabry-Pérot resonators: Low-power neuron-like activation and transmission suppression
Authors: Anton Lutsenko, Kevin G. Fripp, Lukáš Flajšman, Andrey V. Shytov, Volodymyr V. Kruglyak, Sebastiaan van Dijken
Abstract: We report on nonlinear spin-wave dynamics in magnonic Fabry-Pérot resonators composed of yttrium iron garnet (YIG) films coupled to CoFeB nanostripes. Using super-Nyquist sampling magneto-optical Kerr effect microscopy and micromagnetic simulations, we observe a systematic downshift of the spin-wave transmission gaps as the excitation power increases. This nonlinear behavior occurs at low power levels, reduced by a strong spatial concentration of spin waves within the resonator. The resulting power-dependent transmission enables neuron-like activation behavior and frequency-selective nonlinear spin-wave absorption. Our results highlight magnonic Fabry-Pérot resonators as compact low-power nonlinear elements for neuromorphic magnonic computing architectures.

Title: Analytic Nonlinear Theory of Shear Banding in Amorphous Solids
Authors: Avanish Kumar, Itamar Procaccia
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to offer an analytic theory of the shear banding instability in amorphous solids that are subjected to athermal quasi-static shear. To this aim we derive nonlinear equations for the displacement field, including the consequences of plastic deformation on the mechanical response of amorphous solids. The plastic events collectively induce distributed dipoles that are responsible for screening effects and the creation of typical length-scales that are absent in classical elasticity theory. The nonlinear theory exposes an instability that results in the creation of shear bands. By solving the weakly nonlinear amplitude equation we present analytic expressions for the displacement fields that is associated with shear bands, explaining the role of the elastic moduli that determine the width of a shear band from ductile to brittle characteristics. We derive an energy functional whose Hessian possesses an eigenvalue that goes to zero at the shear-banding instability, providing a prediction for the critical value of the accumulated stress that results in an instability.

Title: Layer-dependent antiferromagnetic Chern and axion insulating states in UOTe
Authors: Sougata Mardanya, Barun Ghosh, Mengke Liu, Christopher Broyles, Junyeong Ahn, Kai Sun, Jennifer E. Hoffman, Sheng Ran, Arun Bansil, Su-Yang Xu, Sugata Chowdhury
Abstract: Magnetic topological insulators have received significant interest due to their dissipationless edge states, which promise advances in energy-efficient electronic transport. However, the magnetic topological insulator state has typically been found in ferromagnets (FMs) that suffer from low magnetic ordering temperatures and stray fields. Identifying an antiferromagnetic topological insulator that exhibits the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) with a relatively high Néel temperature has been a longstanding challenge. Here, we focus on the recently discovered van der Waals (vdW) antiferromagnet (AFM) UOTe, which not only features a high Néel temperature (\(\sim\)150K) but also exhibits intriguing Kondo interaction and topological characteristics. Our systematic analysis of the layer-dependent topological phases based on \textit{ab} initio computations predicts the two-layer UOTe film to be an ideal 2D AFM Chern insulator in which the Hall conductivity is quantized with a fully compensated spin magnetization. By applying an in-plane strain or electric field, we show how the itinerancy of U-5f electrons can be manipulated to trigger a transition between the nontrivial ($C = 1$) and trivial ($C = 0$) phases. Interestingly, the 3-layer UOTe film is found to have zero charge conductance but it hosts a quantized spin Hall conductivity (SHC) with finite magneto-electric coupling, suggesting the presence of an axion insulator-like state. The unique magnetic structure of UOTe supports a layer-tunable topology in which films with an odd number of layers are axion-like insulators, while films with an even number of layers are Chern insulators, and the bulk material is a Dirac semimetal. Our study offers a new intrinsic AFM materials platform for realizing correlated topological phases for next-generation spintronics applications and fundamental science studies.

Title: A statistical theory of structure in many-particle systems with local interactions
Authors: John Çamkıran, Fabian Parsch, Glenn D. Hibbard
Abstract: A theory of structure is formulated for systems of many structureless classical particles with stable local interactions in Euclidean space. Such systems are shown to have their structure in thermodynamic equilibrium determined exactly by a random field of fine local descriptions and approximately by coarsenings thereof. The degree of order in the local cluster consisting of a particle and its neighbors is identified as a universal source of coarse local descriptions and characterized by expressing the behavior of configurational entropy in local microscopic terms. A local measure of the angular redundancy in neighboring particle positions is found to satisfy this characterization and thereby established as a valid local order quantifier. A precise relationship between order and symmetry is obtained by bounding this quantifier sharply from below by a simple function of the local point group and the largest stabilizer under its action on the set of bond pairs. The marginal distribution of the quantifier is given in closed form for highly coordinated particles with broadly distributed bond angles. Applications are made to the ideal gas, perfect crystal, and simple liquid.

Title: Distorted polyhedral architecture enabled high thermoelectric performance of columnar double halide perovskites Cs2AgPdCl5 and Cs2AgPtCl5
Authors: Heena, Vineet Kumar Pandey, Ambesh Dixit, Anver Aziz, Sung Ku Kang, K.C. Bhamu
Abstract: We investigate the thermoelectric properties of two newly synthesized columnar double halide perovskites Cs$_2$AgPdCl$_5$ and Cs$_2$AgPtCl$_5$. These materials accommodate a distorted local polyhedral architecture with tetrahedral symmetry compared to traditional double halide perovskites. By employing density functional theory along with the semiclassical transport model, we have analyzed the electronic and transport properties of these materials. Our results show that at 800 K, the largest figure of merit ($zT$) is 1.30 (0.86) for p-type (n-type) Cs$_2$AgPdCl$_5$ and 0.87 for n-type Cs$_2$AgPtCl$_5$ at doping concentrations of $1.94 \times 10^{20}$ ($3.76 \times 10^{19}$) cm$^{-3}$ and $3.52 \times 10^{19}$ cm$^{-3}$, respectively. Remarkably, a very low doping concentration is required to achieve a high $zT$, setting these materials apart from others in this field. Our calculations demonstrate that Cs$_2$AgPdCl$_5$ benefits from the presence of conduction and valence band valleys near the band edges; however, the flat bands present in the valence band of Cs$_2$AgPtCl$_5$ do not improve its thermoelectric performance. Among these systems, hole doping in Cs$_2$AgPdCl$_5$ has shown remarkable thermoelectric performance. Interestingly, the local octahedral distortions present in these perovskites contribute to a marked reduction in the lattice thermal conductivity to 0.27 W/mK in Cs$_2$AgPtCl$_5$ and 0.20 W/mK in Cs$_2$AgPdCl$_5$ by causing enhanced phonon scattering, further improving the thermoelectric figure of merit. This drop in thermal conductivity, combined with the favorable electronic properties, underscores the potential use of these materials for applications in highly efficient thermoelectric devices.

Title: Scaling and Universality at Noise-Affected Non-Equilibrium Spin Correlation Functions
Authors: R. Jafari, Alireza Akbari
Abstract: We investigate scaling and universality in nonequilibrium spin correlation functions in the presence of uncorrelated noise. In the absence of noise, spin correlation functions exhibit a crossover from monotonic decay at fast sweep velocities to oscillatory behavior at slow sweeps. We show that, under a stochastically driven field, the critical sweep velocity at which the spin correlation functions undergo an abrupt change decreases with increasing noise strength and scales linearly with the square of the noise intensity. Remarkably, when the noise intensity and sweep velocity are comparable, the excitation probability becomes locked to pk = 1/2 over a finite momentum window, signaling the emergence of noise-induced maximally mixed modes. This gives rise to a highly oscillatory region in the dynamical phase diagram, whose threshold sweep velocity increases with noise and likewise exhibits quadratic scaling with the noise strength. Finally, we identify a universal scaling function under which all boundary sweep-velocity curves collapse onto a single universal curve.

Title: Spatial homogeneity of superconducting order parameter in NbN films grown by atomic layer deposition
Authors: J. Lorenz, S. Linzen, M. Ziegler, G. Oelsner, R. Stolz, F. S. Tautz, F. Lüpke, E. Il'ichev
Abstract: Due to their high kinetic inductance, highly disordered superconducting thin films are a potential hardware for the realization of compact, low-noise elements in cryoelectronic applications. However, high disorder typically results in structural defects that cause spatial inhomogeneity of the superconducting order parameter, thereby impairing the film's properties. Here, we employ scanning tunneling microscopy to demonstrate that NbN thin films fabricated by plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PE-ALD) exhibit unusual spatial homogeneity, even at thicknesses approaching the superconductor-insulator transition. Tunneling spectra acquired across the sample surface show only small variations of the order parameter with a standard deviation of 2-3%, on length scales that significantly exceed the film's grain size. At the same time, the films achieve a relatively high sheet resistance (up to 1400 Ohm) and, consequently, a high sheet kinetic inductance (up to approximately 200 pH), making them well-suited for applications.

Title: Enhanced effective masses, spin-orbit polarization, and dispersion relations in 2D hole gases under strongly asymmetric confinement
Authors: N. A. Cockton, F. Sfigakis, M. Korkusinski, S. R. Harrigan, G. Nichols, Z. D. Merino, T. Zou, A. C. Coschizza, T. Joshi, A. Shetty, M. C. Tam, Z. R. Wasilewski, S. A. Studenikin, D. G. Austing, J. Baugh, J. B. Kycia
Abstract: The dispersion of Rashba-split heavy-hole subbands in GaAs two-dimensional hole gases (2DHGs) is difficult to access experimentally because strong heavy-hole-light-hole mixing produces non-parabolicity and breaks the usual correspondence between carrier density and Fermi wave vector. Here we use low-field magnetotransport (B < 1 T) to reconstruct the dispersions of the two spin-orbit-split heavy-hole branches (HH-, HH+) in undoped (100) GaAs/AlGaAs single heterojunction 2DHGs operated in an accumulation-mode field-effect geometry. The dopant-free devices sustain out-of-plane electric fields up to 26 kV/cm while maintaining mobilities up to 84 m$^2$/Vs and exhibiting a spin-orbit polarization as large as 36%. Fourier analysis of Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations resolves the individual HH-/HH+ subband densities; fitting the temperature dependence of the corresponding Fourier amplitudes yields both branch-resolved SdH effective masses over the same magnetic field window. SdH regimes in which reliable subband parameters can be extracted are delineated. Over 2DHG densities (0.76-1.9) $\times$ 10$^{15}$ /m$^2$, the HH- mass is nearly density independent ($\approx 0.34m_e$), implying a near-parabolic HH- dispersion below the first LH+/HH- anticrossing, whereas HH+ exhibits strong non-parabolicity with an effective mass that increases with density. Combining the extracted dispersions yields a transport-based determination of the spin-orbit splitting energy $\Delta_\text{HH}$ between HH and HH+ as a function of in-plane wave vector. Parameter-free Luttinger-model calculations reproduce the qualitative trends but underestimate both masses by a common factor $\approx$ 2, suggesting a many-body renormalization of the heavy-hole mass in this strongly asymmetric regime.

Title: Fragile $\mathit{vs}$ robust Multiple Equilibria phases in generalized Lotka-Volterra model with non-reciprocal interactions
Authors: Thomas Louis-Sarrola, Valentina Ros
Abstract: We investigate the Multiple Equilibria phase of generalized Lotka-Volterra dynamics with random, non-reciprocal interactions. We compute the topological complexity of equilibria, which quantifies how rapidly the number of equilibria of the dynamical equations grows with the total number of species. We perform the calculation for arbitrary degree of non-reciprocity in the interactions, distinguishing between configurations that are dynamically stable to invasions by species absent from the equilibrium, and those that are not. We characterize the properties of typical (i.e., most numerous) equilibria at a given diversity, including their average abundance, mutual similarity, and internal stability. This analysis reveals the existence of two distinct ME phases, which differ in how internally stable equilibria behave under invasions by absent species. We discuss the implications of this finding for the system's dynamical behavior.

Title: Interlayer-mediated catalyst engineering for ultra-high aspect ratio silicon nanostructures
Authors: Bryan Peter Jost Benz, Marco Stampanoni, Lucia Romano
Abstract: Reliable and precise etching of silicon nanostructures with ultra-high aspect ratios is required in many fields. Metal assisted chemical etching (MacEtch) in vapor is a plasma-free etching method that attracts considerable attention owing to the ability to create smooth, high aspect ratio nanostructures. MacEtch understanding and applications are limited by low fidelity and inconsistent pattern transfer from the catalyst layer to the silicon substrate. The locally constrained electrochemical interactions at the catalyst site make MacEtch particularly sensitive to catalyst contamination reducing the reaction rate and pinning the catalyst during etching. Removing contaminants is essential to improve pattern transfer for reliable processes on a larger area and higher aspect ratio. Physically separating the main source of carbon - the resist - from the catalyst with a sacrificial and functional interlayer solves this issue. The interlayer separates the resist and the catalyst and allows for thorough cleaning of the substrate before catalyst deposition. The resulting clean catalyst has improved stability, quality and reproducibility, enabling reliable fabrication of dense (50% patterned area) high aspect ratio (>250:1) nanostructures. Two different interlayer materials (Cr and Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$) and two patterning approaches are presented, showcasing etching of various high aspect ratio nanostructures, such as X-ray Optics.

Title: On generating Special Quasirandom Structures: Optimization for the DFT computational efficiency
Authors: Andrzej P. Kądzielawa
Abstract: We present our novel evolutionary algorithm for generating Special Quasirandom Structures (SQS) designed to optimize the computational efficiency of Density Functional Theory (DFT) computations. Operating on the premise that symmetry proxies non-randomness, we rigorously filter out 1.P1 candidate structures prior to evaluating correlation functions. Our extinction-based workflow includes the seeding, filtration, evaluation, extinction, and repopulation phases to produce efficient supercells with maximal local environmental distinctness. We compare our results against those generated by established software packages, on the example of the W\textsubscript{70}Cr\textsubscript{30} alloy. Although standard tools achieve (marginally) lower correlation errors, our best-performing structures require approximately five times fewer unique displacements for phonon calculations. This approach sacrifices negligible quantitative disorder accuracy to significantly reduce the computational cost of modeling thermal properties.

Title: Experimental study of matter-wave four-wave mixing in $^{39}$K Bose-Einstein condensates with tunable interaction
Authors: Yue Zhang, Liangchao Chen, Zekui Wang, Yazhou Wang, Pengjun Wang, Lianghui Huang, Zengming Meng, Zhuxiong Ye, Wei Han, Jing Zhang
Abstract: We experimentally investigate four-wave mixing (FWM) of matter waves in two geometric configurations in $^{39}$K Bose-Einstein condensates with the atomic interaction tuned via Feshbach resonances. For one configuration with the single-spin component, the FWM yield increases with a larger scattering length. For the two-spin component configuration, we specifically investigate FWM in both the droplet and gas parameter regimes. We find that the FWM yield reaches its maximum near the critical parameter region between the gas and droplet phases. Our research can help to optimize the FWM yield for matter-wave amplification and entangled atom pair generation, making it conducive to applications in quantum information processing and precision measurement.

Title: Staggered Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and canting angle in centrosymmetric altermagnetic and ferromagnetic phases: influence on the anomalous Hall effect and Weyl points
Authors: Mathews Benny, Xujia Gong, Kamil Jamroszczyk, Amar Fakhredine, Giuseppe Cuono, Rajibul Islam, Jan Skolimowski, Carmine Autieri
Abstract: We present a simple methodology to compute the anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) as a function of the canting angles in ferromagnets and altermagnets, starting from a nonmagnetic Hamiltonian obtained from first-principles calculations that preserves the full symmetry of the crystal structure. Magnetism is introduced by including on-site spin splitting, spin-orbit coupling, and spin-canting angles. As a representative material, we study SrRuO$_3$, which supports spin canting and exhibits a sign change of the AHC. In the ferromagnetic phase, the low-energy AHC is found to be close to zero at the Fermi level, in agreement with experimental observations. We show that the dependence of the AHC on the relevant physical parameters is most pronounced in the central region of the electronic bandwidth. We determine the symmetry-allowed components of the AHC for different magnetic orders in the large family of transition-metal perovskite ABO$_3$ compounds with space group $62$, including the spontaneous in-plane anomalous Hall effect. Within density functional theory, we evaluate the range of spin-canting angles in SrRuO$_3$ and demonstrate that it is suppressed as electronic correlations increase. By analyzing the AHC as a function of the canting angle, we find that the collinear magnetic configurations contribute most to the AHC, while spin canting plays a secondary role in determining its magnitude in non-collinear ferromagnets and altermagnets. However, canting can become relevant and induce a sign change of the AHC when the collinear magnetic state exhibits an AHC close to zero. Finally, we investigate the locations of Weyl points in the Brillouin zone and their evolution as a function of the canting angle.

Title: Two-Scale Analysis of the Electrostatics of Dielectric Crystals: Emergence of Polarization Density and Boundary Charges
Authors: Shoham Sen, Yang Wang, Timothy Breitzman, Kaushik Dayal
Abstract: Ionic crystals, such as solid electrolytes and complex oxides, are central to modern technologies for energy storage, sensing, actuation, and other functional applications. An important fundamental issue in the atomic and quantum-scale modeling of these materials is defining the macroscopic polarization. In a periodic crystal, the usual definition of the polarization as the first moment of the charge density in a unit cell is found to depend qualitatively - allowing even a change in the sign - and quantitatively on the choice of unit cell. We examine this issue using a rigorous approach based on the framework of 2-scale convergence. By examining the continuum limit of when the lattice spacing is much smaller than the characteristic dimensions of the body, we show that the 2-scale limit provides both a bulk polarization as well as a surface charge density supported on the boundary of the body. Further, different choices of the periodic unit cell of the body lead to correspondingly different partial unit cells at the boundary; these choices give to different bulk polarization and surface charges but compensate such that the electric field and energy are independent of the choice of unit cell.

Title: Annotated digital image correlation displacement fields from fatigue crack growth experiments
Authors: David Melching, Ferdinand Dömling, Florian Paysan, Erik Schultheis, Eric Dietrich, Eric Breitbarth
Abstract: We present a curated dataset of planar displacement fields from eight fatigue crack growth experiments obtained via full-field digital image correlation (DIC). The dataset covers multiple aerospace-grade aluminium alloys, specimen geometries, material orientations, and load configurations, providing a diverse experimental basis for data-driven fracture mechanics research. Crack tip locations are consistently annotated using an iterative correction procedure applied to all measurements, and fracture mechanical descriptors like stress-intensity factors are provided as additional labels. The dataset comprises 8,794 unique experimentally observed displacement fields and a total of 70,352 supervised samples generated through standardized interpolation and augmentation. DIC data is provided as uniformly interpolated displacement grids at three standardized resolutions 28 x 28, 64 x 64, and 128 x 128 pixels, each available in three dataset sizes to support scalable use cases ranging from educational applications to high-capacity model development. Accompanying metadata and a Python interface facilitate filtering, loading, and integration into reproducible machine learning and fracture mechanics workflows.

Title: Low magnetic moment and unconventional magneto-transport in half-Heusler alloy CoVGe
Authors: Ravinder Kumar, Jyotiraditya Pandey, Shoaib Akhtar, Sachin Majee, Dibyendu Majee, Samik DuttaGupta, Sachin Gupta
Abstract: In the present work, we experimentally realize CoVGe for the first time and investigate its structural, magnetic, and transport properties, supported by theoretical calculations. The material crystallizes in a cubic structure and exhibits a very low magnetic moment of 0.13 {\mu}B per formula unit at 5 K. The temperature dependence of electrical resistivity suggests half-metallic behaviour. Magnetoresistance shows a positive, non-saturating linear field dependence at low temperature that gradually weakens with increasing temperature. The combination of low magnetic moment and unusual magnetotransport behaviour positions CoVGe as a promising platform for exploring spin-dependent transport in Heusler-based materials.

Abstract: Ultrawide-bandgap semiconductors are attractive for solar-blind ultraviolet (UV) detection owing to their intrinsically low noise and high spectral selectivity, yet their deployment in large-area, high-density electronic imaging systems remains limited by a fundamental trade-off between material quality, device speed, and compatibility with high-density planar silicon readout circuits. Here, we report a membrane-enabled integration platform based on transferable single-crystalline beta-Ga2O3 that overcomes these constraints at the system level. By exploiting the weak interplanar bonding of beta-Ga2O3 (100) plane, we obtain wafer-scale freestanding single-crystalline membranes that enable vertically integrated photodiodes with sub-microsecond, non-persistent photoresponse and high UV-visible rejection. Crucially, we introduce a stitching-based membrane assembly strategy that decouples array resolution from the size of the source single-crystalline substrate, allowing high-resolution photodetector arrays to be integrated onto silicon thin-film-transistor backplanes. The modular assembled active-matrix UV imaging arrays exhibit uniform solar-blind response without image lag, in stark contrast to arrays based on amorphous or polycrystalline films. Beyond beta-Ga2O3, this membrane-enabled and stitching-based modular integration strategy provides a general route toward high-speed, high-resolution electronic imaging systems using transferable single-crystalline semiconductors.

Title: Photon counting beyond the rotating-wave approximation
Authors: Steven Kim, Fabian Hassler
Abstract: Open quantum systems are often described by a Lindblad master equation, which relies on a set of approximations, most importantly the rotating-wave approximation which is only valid for weak damping. In the Lindblad setting, dissipative processes are described through jump operators, distinguishing between absorption and emission of photons. This enables the simple identification of emitted photons which provides a straightforward way to obtain the radiation statistics. Outside the rotating-wave limit, the Lindblad approach does not work. Open quantum systems can then be described by, e.g., the quantum Langevin equation. However, in this framework the number of emitted photons is not easily accessible. In this work, we point out how to obtain the photon counting statistics from a quantum Langevin equation and provide an expression for the photon current operator, for arbitrary systems coupled to linear environments. As an example, we employ the method to study the radiation statistics of a damped harmonic oscillator at finite temperature beyond the rotating-wave approximation. We show that even outside the rotating-wave limit, the most important contribution to the radiation statistics can be captured by an effective Lindblad equation, thus extending the range of possible applications of the Lindblad framework.

Title: Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Primary Antioxidant-Containing Polymer Melts: Effects of Antioxidant Concentration and Molecular Architecture
Authors: Takato Ishida, Emmanuel Richaud
Abstract: Industrial polymeric materials often rely on antioxidants to achieve long-term reliability. Previous studies have frequently discussed the stabilization effect in the presence of macroscopic additive migration. However, the micro- to meso-scale coupling between polymer dynamics and antioxidant molecular dynamics remains insufficiently understood. In this study, we extend a polymer dynamics simulation framework that can account for oxidative aging. We also update the model so that it can explicitly incorporate antioxidant molecules into the simulation. As a result, the framework enables us to quantify how molecular architecture of antioxidants affects oxidation kinetics, which has previously been inferred only indirectly from apparent changes in reaction rates. It also allows us to evaluate the effects of antioxidant concentration and molecular architecture on the spatial heterogeneity of oxidative aging.

Title: Fluctuation-Response Design Rules for Nonequilibrium Flows
Authors: Ying-Jen Yang, Ken A. Dill
Abstract: Biological machines like molecular motors and enzymes operate in dynamic cycles representable as stochastic flows on networks. Current stochastic dynamics describes such flows on fixed networks. Here, we develop a scalable approach to network design in which local transition rates can be systematically varied to achieve global dynamical objectives. It is based on the fluctuation-response duality in the recent Caliber Force Theory -- a path-entropy variational formalism for nonequilibria. This approach scales efficiently with network complexity and gives new insights, for example revealing the transition from timing- to branching-dominated fluctuations in a kinesin motor model.

Title: Quantum critical behavior of cuprate superconductors observed by inelastic X-ray scattering
Authors: H. Y. Huang, C. Y. Mou, A. Singh, J. S. Su, J. Okamoto, S. Komiya, C. T. Chen, T. K. Lee, A. Fujimor, D. J. Huang
Abstract: Progress toward a complete understanding of cuprate superconductors has been hindered by their intricate phase diagram, potentially linked to a quantum critical point (QCP). However, conclusive evidence for the QCP is lacking, as the presumed QCP is buried under the superconducting dome, disguising its presence. Here, we use high-resolution resonant inelastic X-ray scattering to examine the dynamical charge-charge correlation in La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ and uncover the quantum critical scaling, a key feature required for a QCP. Specifically, \djh{we observed that the inverse correlation lengths for various dopings and temperatures collapsed onto a universal scaling curve, yielding a critical exponent $\nu$ of $0.74 \pm 0.08$. The non-negativity of this exponent confirms the presence of a QCP. Remarkably, the value of $\nu$ suggests that while the QCP is manifested through the charge-density wave, other orders also participate, such that the QCP appears to belong to the universality class characterized by the O(4) symmetry, reminiscent of the microscopic SO(4) symmetry in the Hubbard model at half-filling. Further analysis indicates that the QCP is highly dissipative with a short quasi-particle lifetime, reflecting the intertwined quantum fluctuations due to its being buried inside the superconducting state.

Title: Vertically Correlated Disorder and Structured Interlayer Tunneling in Cuprates
Authors: E.Yu. Beliayev, Y.K. Mishra, I.G. Mirzoiev, V.V. Andrievskii, A.V. Terekhov
Abstract: Cuprate superconductors display robust in-plane electronic correlations but exceptionally fragile interlayer coherence. We suggest that even weak vertically correlated disorder (arising from interstitial-oxygen staging, twin boundaries, extended strain fields, or defect-pinned charge textures) can impose a layer-dependent modulation of the interlayer tunneling amplitude t(z). Because the bare interlayer coupling is intrinsically small, such modulations generate an effectively multichannel c-axis electrodynamic response, consistent with multi-component Josephson plasma resonances, nonmonotonic c-axis resistivity, redistribution of bilayer magnetic spectral weight, and field-enhanced vertical CDW correlations. We propose a phenomenological framework in which the organization of disorder, rather than its magnitude, governs the effective interlayer coupling and its electrodynamic signatures. This viewpoint unifies diverse c-axis anomalies across several cuprate families, suggesting that controlling vertical disorder correlations offers a viable pathway for tuning dimensionality and interlayer coherence in high-Tc superconductors.

Title: Pseudorotation and N-body Forces in an Optical Matter System
Authors: John Linderman, Shiqi Chen, Yanzeng Li, Alexandria Hoehn, Stuart A. Rice, Norbert F. Scherer
Abstract: Isomerization in molecular systems almost invariably occurs through 3-dimensional motion due to the nature of chemical bonding. Pseudorotation is an unusual type of isomerization that occurs in some high symmetry systems that gives the appearance of rigid-body rotation yet only involves atom rearrangements. This paper demonstrates that pseudorotation occurs in 2-dimensions in an optical matter (OM) system of metal nanoparticle constituents. The difference in dimensionality of the dynamics arises from the electrodynamic field-interference nature of optical binding vs. quantum mechanical bonding in polyatomic molecules. The 8-nanoparticle OM "kite" structure we study in experiments and simulations has D2 (D2h) symmetry and a D4 symmetric transition state. The mechanism for pseudorotation involves correlated motion of all 8 nanoparticles with smooth (continuous) evolution of their interactions and without particles jumping in or out of the OM array. While the OM kite structure only occurs with 10% probability vs. other OM isomers, its rate of pseudorotation is rapid relative to transitions to other structural isomers (e.g., "teardrop"). The other isomers have structures that lie on a trigonal lattice with inter-particle separations at distances that enhance field interference and induced polarizations. Even though the kite isomer has inter-particle separations that would manifest destructive interference on a particle pair (i.e., 2-body) basis, the kite structure is the slowest to rearrange into any other isomer. We show that the unusual structure and dynamics of the kite optical matter system result from N-body interactions and forces demonstrating that N-body effects are important in this class of active matter and presumably more generally.

Authors: Sebastian Serra, Gaurav Shukla, Giada Bucci, Robert Sorodoc, Valentina Zannier, Fabio Beltram, Lucia Sorba, Stefan Heun
Abstract: The present work reports, for the first time, the growth of high-quality free-standing InAsSb nanoflags and their electronic properties. Different growth conditions have been explored, and zinc-blende InAsSb nanoflags of various composition have been obtained. In particular, InAs0.77Sb0.23 nanoflags are on average (2000+-180) nm long, (640+-50) nm wide, and (130+-30) nm thick. We show that these nanoflags have a Landé g-factor larger than InAs and InSb and a mobility comparable to those of the best performing InAs and InSb nanoflags. Besides, we show evidence for a surface Fermi level pinning in the conductance band of these InAs0.77Sb0.23 nanoflags, similar to the well-known behavior of InAs. This promises to make InAsSb easy to couple to superconductors, while keeping or improving many of the features that make InSb an interesting material for quantum applications.

Title: Long-range electrostatics in atomistic machine learning: a physical perspective
Authors: Federico Grasselli, Kevin Rossi, Stefano de Gironcoli, Andrea Grisafi
Abstract: The inclusion of long-range electrostatics in atomistic machine learning (ML) is receiving increasing attention for achieving quantum-mechanical accuracy in predicting a wide range of molecular and material properties. However, there is still no general prescription on how long-range physical effects should be incorporated into the model while preserving well-established locality principles underlying most transferable ML representations. Here, we provide a physical perspective on the problem, by discussing how distinct contributions to the system's electrostatics can be captured through the adoption of different learning paradigms. Specifically, we discern between local charge models, which rely either on explicit charge-density decompositions or implicit auxiliary variables, and models where a notion of nonlocality is deliberately introduced, either via self-consistent procedures or by using nonlocal descriptors and learning architectures. We further address the related aspect of incorporating finite-field effects through the coupling with the system's polarization, relevant for the application of an external electric bias. We conclude by discussing the implications for the simulation of electrochemical interfaces, where long-range electrostatics are essential to capture the interplay between charge redistribution, interfacial dynamics, and ionic screening, and for ionic transport phenomena, which, although less explored, appear far less sensitive to their inclusion.

Title: Stochastic synthesis-degradation processes: first-passage properties and connections with resetting
Authors: Gabriel Mercado-Vásquez, Denis Boyer
Abstract: Processes controlled by stochastic synthesis and degradation (SSD) are widespread in biology but their reaction kinetics are not well understood. Using methods borrowed from the theory of resetting processes, we determine the first-passage properties of a collection of independent particles that are synthesized and degraded at constant rates, and follow an arbitrary diffusive process in space. At equal synthesis and degradation rates, the mean reaction time with a target site can be minimized as in stochastic resetting, and a $CV$-criterion is derived. When the degradation rate is held fixed and the synthesis costs are taken into account, an optimal synthesis rate is obtained. In bounded domains, despite particle degradation, SSD improves the mean search time compared to a single non-degrading particle if the synthesis rate exceeds a critical value. The latter obeys a universal relation. We illustrate these findings with Brownian diffusion on the infinite line and in an interval.

Title: Data-Efficient Multidimensional Free Energy Estimation via Physics-Informed Score Learning
Authors: Daniel Nagel, Tristan Bereau
Abstract: Many biological processes involve numerous coupled degrees of freedom, yet free-energy estimation is often restricted to one-dimensional profiles to mitigate the high computational cost of multidimensional sampling. In this work, we extend Fokker--Planck Score Learning (FPSL) to efficiently reconstruct two-dimensional free-energy landscapes from non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations using different types of collective variables. We show that explicitly modeling orthogonal degrees of freedom reveals insights hidden in one-dimensional projections at negligible computational overhead. Additionally, exploiting symmetries in the underlying landscape enhances reconstruction accuracy, while regularization techniques ensure numerical robustness in sparsely sampled regions. We validate our approach on three distinct systems: the conformational dynamics of alanine dipeptide, as well as coarse-grained and all-atom models of solute permeation through lipid bilayers. We demonstrate that, because FPSL learns a smooth score function rather than histogram-based densities, it overcomes the exponential scaling of grid-based methods, establishing it as a data-efficient and scalable tool for multidimensional free-energy estimation.

Title: Spontaneous phase separation and pattern formation in a lyotropic nematic mixture
Authors: A. Bensabat, O. Skelton, J. Arlt, M. Bjelogrlic, D. Marenduzzo, G. Negro, T. N. Shendruk, T. A. Wood
Abstract: Lyotropic liquid crystals can display rich phase behaviour and self-organisation, yet the physical principles underlying their self-assembly into large scale patterns remains understudied. Here, we combine theory, simulations and experiments on Sunset Yellow-water chromonic mixtures to show that such materials spontaneously phase separate, even without assuming any underlying microscopic attraction between the molecular species. In our minimal model, demixing depends solely on the Onsager-like coupling between local nematogen density and orientational order. If such a coupling is sufficiently strong, nematic defects trigger the nucleation of isotropic droplets, which then coalesce due to elastic or interfacial tensions. We further show that strong anchoring of the director field at the interface arrests this coarsening process, resulting in a stable microphase separated lamellar pattern. This self-assembled smectic phase has striking and unusual features, including spontaneous undulations, heterogeneous layer spacing, long-lived glassy defect patterns and lamellar onions. Our results identify orientational-density coupling and elastocapillarity as fundamental mechanisms to guide self-assembly in lyotropic and chromonic liquid crystals.

Title: Reentrance in a Hamiltonian flocking model
Authors: Letian Chen, Luke K. Davis
Abstract: The clustering of self-motile and repulsive particles, so-called motility-induced phase separation (MIPS), is one of the clearest signatures of active physics. Typically, increasing the amplitude of self-motility increases the degree of clustering, however for high enough self-motility the homogeneous phase is reentered. Here, we report that such reentrance naturally emerges in a Hamiltonian (conservative) model known to recapitulate properties of (active) bird flocks, and exhibits clustering behaviour reminiscent of MIPS. We numerically demonstrate the reentrance of the homogeneous phase and identify the underlying mechanism as a competition between the amplitude of a spin-velocity coupled drive and mobility-limited kinetic frustration. Specifically, we reveal that strong spin-velocity coupling suppresses transverse diffusion, thereby leading the system into an arrest that closes the window for phase separation. Overall, our work offers a Hamiltonian, conservative, bridge between reentrant physics across equilibrium and non-equilibrium materials.

Title: Nonreciprocal many-body physics
Authors: Michel Fruchart, Vincenzo Vitelli
Abstract: Reciprocity is a fundamental symmetry present in many natural phenomena and engineered systems. Distinct situations where this symmetry is broken are typically grouped under the umbrella term "nonreciprocity", colloquially defined by: the action of A on B $\neq$ the action of B on A. In this review, we elucidate what nonreciprocity is by providing an introduction to its most salient classes: nonvariational dynamics, violations of Newton's third law, broken detailed balance, nonreciprocal responses and nonreciprocity of arbitrary linear operators. Next, we point out where to find these manifestations of non-reciprocity, from ensembles of particles with field mediated interactions to synthetic neural networks and open quantum systems. Given this breadth of contexts and the lack of an all-encompassing definition, it makes it all the more intriguing that some general conclusions can be gathered, when distinct definitions of nonreciprocity overlap. We explore what these universal consequences are with a special emphasis on collective phenomena that arise in nonreciprocal many-body systems. The topics covered include nonreciprocal phase transitions and non-normal amplification of noise and perturbations. We conclude with some open questions.

Title: Floquet Control of Electron and Exciton Transport in Kekulé-Distorted Graphene
Authors: Sita Kandel, Godfrey Gumbs
Abstract: This work investigates the Floquet dynamics of electrons and excitons (particle-hole pairs) in a Dirac material referred to as Kekulé-distorted graphene. Specifically, we examine the role played by a high frequency driving electromagnetic field on the tunneling and blocking by a potential barrier on both the charged single particles as well as the neutral composite particles. We demonstrate that the small effective masses of the electron and hole for the energy spectrum of this Kekulé distorted graphene leads to practically almost perfect transmission across a symmetric potential barrier for any angle of incidence of impinging excitons. However, this unexpected Klein paradox for excitons does not hold for the single-particle electrons. The reduced total transmission of electron due to Kekulé distortion is more suppressed due to irradiation. Additionally, we calculate and investigate the exciton binding energy since the quantum tunneling of a bound electron-hole pair across a potential barrier is governed by its mass measured in the center of mass and binding energy of the composite pair. Thus, irradiation with circularly polarized light fundamentally modifies exciton formation, coherence and transport properties, thereby producing unusual topological behaviors. These behaviors are unlike conventional Dirac materials. Possible technical applications of the results arising from our investigation include valleytronics due to the folding of the valleys, thereby making intervalley coupling feasible. Other practical applications include optoelectronics due to Floquet tuning of energy spectrum and transport properties.

Title: Mapping reservoir-enhanced superconductivity to near-long-range magnetic order in the undoped 1D Anderson- and Kondo-lattices
Authors: J. E. Ebot, Lorenzo Pizzino, Sam Mardazad, Johannes S. Hofmann, Thierry Giamarchi, Adrian Kantian
Abstract: The undoped Kondo necklace in 1D is a paradigmatic and well understood model of a Kondo insulator. This work performs the first large-scale study of the 1D Anderson-lattice underlying the Kondo necklace with quasi-exact numerical methods, comparing this with the perturbative effective 1D Kondo-necklace model derived from the former. This study is based on an exact mapping of the Anderson model to one of a superconducting pairing layer connected to a metallic reservoir which is valid in arbitrary spatial dimensions, thereby linking the previously disparate areas of reservoir-enhanced superconductivity, following Kivelson's pioneering proposals, and that of periodic Kondo-systems. Our work reveals that below the length-scales on which the insulating state sets in, which can be very large, superconducting and density-density correlations are degenerate and may both appear to approach an almost ordered state, to a degree that far exceeds that of any isolated 1D pairing layer with short-range interactions. We trace these effects to the effective extended-range coupling that the metallic layer mediates within the pairing layer. These results translate directly to the appearance of near-long-range magnetic order at intermediate scales in the Kondo-systems, and explain the strong renormalization of the RKKY-coupling that we effectively observe, in terms of the back-action of the pairing layer onto the metallic layer. The effects we predict could be tested either by local probes of quasi-1D heavy fermion compounds such as CeCo$_2$Ga$_8$, in engineered chains of ad-atoms or in ultracold atomic gases.

Title: Quasiperiodicity-induced non-Hermitian skin effect from the breakdown of scale-free localization
Authors: Kazuma Saito, Ryo Okugawa, Kazuki Yokomizo, Takami Tohyama, Chen-Hsuan Hsu
Abstract: Non-reciprocal systems exhibit extreme sensitivity to boundary conditions, typically manifesting as the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) under open boundaries. By bridging the boundaries with a tunable impurity bond, one can access intermediate regimes where scale-free localization (SFL) can emerge. Here, we investigate the competition between such boundary coupling and quasiperiodic disorder in a non-reciprocal lattice. Our analyses reveal a quasiperiodicity-induced breakdown of the SFL regime, which evolves into either the NHSE or an extended regime, depending on boundary conditions. These results uncover the crucial role of quasiperiodicity in non-Hermitian systems.

Title: Chaos, the Critical Phenomenon in Phase Space: Feigenbaum Constants and Critical Exponents
Authors: Yonghui Xia, Hongtao Feng
Abstract: Chaos in both dissipative systems and conservative systems is investigated on the approach of renormalization group. It is found that the chaos is regarded as the critical phenomenon of equilibrium statistics in phase space. The two Feigenbaum constants in the period-doubling bifurcation systems correspond to two independent critical exponents, which are universal and can be adopted to distinguish the classes of chaos. For the conservative systems, due to the critical nature of the chaos, the isolated systems with different parameters are correlated in the phase space, and therefore the isolated system is no longer isolated in the phase space. The information of conservative systems is irreversibly lost over time, which leads to the increase entropy in an isolated system, and the contradiction between the second law of thermodynamics and the reversibility of isolated systems can be resolved.

Title: Photoluminescent registration of fullerite C$_{60}$ derivatives during chemical interaction with H$_{2}$ and N$_{2}$ molecules
Authors: Victor Zoryansky, Peter Zinoviev, Yuri Semerenko
Abstract: Single crystals of C$_{60}$ saturated with molecular hydrogen and nitrogen were studied using the spectral-luminescent method of registration in the quantum counting mode at a low temperature of 20 K. Previously, it was found that the temperature limit of the adsorption crossover (the transition from the diffusion mechanism of intercalation - physisorption to chemical interaction - chemisorption) for fullerite C$_{60}$ in an H$_{2}$ atmosphere is about 525 K, and in an N$_{2}$ atmosphere 695 K, respectively. At saturation temperatures above those indicated, the process of chemical interaction of impurity molecules and the fullerite matrix occurs with the formation of new compounds. Therefore, saturation was carried out at temperatures of 570 K for hydrogen and 720 K for nitrogen under a pressure of 30 atm. For the first time, the results of registration of photoluminescent radiation at low temperatures from new substances based on fullerite C60 are presented. A mixture of weakly saturated fulleranes C$_{60}$H$_{X}$ was obtained by saturation of hydrogen from the gas phase at a temperature close to the sorption crossover temperature, and their low-temperature photoluminescence was identified for the first time. The analysis of the "blue" shift of the beginning of the spectrum of such radiation allowed us to more accurately attribute the obtained material to the initial segment of the fullerane series. The presence of radiation of the azafullerene dimer (biazafullerene) (C$_{59}$N)$_{2}$ in the spectra of the reaction products of C$_{60}$ with N$_{2}$ was also detected. It was shown that for polycrystalline samples of C$_{60}$ saturated in a nitrogen atmosphere, the characteristic luminescence of biazafullerene with a maximum at 1.53 eV determines the intensity and shape of the entire short-wave part of the emission spectrum of the complex of synthesized substances.

Title: Disturbing news about the $d=2+ε$ expansion II. Assessing the recombination scenario
Authors: Fabiana De Cesare, Slava Rychkov
Abstract: In [De Cesare, Rychkov (2025)], we revisited the $d=2+\epsilon$ expansion in the $O(N)$ Non-Linear Sigma Model (NLSM), emphasizing the existence of a protected operator which is a closed form with $N-1$ indices. The scaling dimension of this operator stays exactly equal to $N-1$, independently of $\epsilon$. Its existence is problematic for the identification of the NLSM fixed point in $d=2+\epsilon$ with the Wilson-Fisher fixed point family obtained by analytically continuing from near $d=4$, which does not possess such a protected operator. Multiplet recombination is one scenario discussed in [De Cesare, Rychkov (2025)], which could allow to connect the two families continuously (although not analytically). In this scenario, the protected dimension is lifted at some critical value of $\epsilon$, thanks to the short conformal multiplet of scaling dimension $N-1$ eating a long conformal multiplet of higher scaling dimension. In this followup work, we assess this scenario for the cases $N=3$ and $N=4$. We identify the lowest candidates for the long multiplet which could be eaten, and compute their one-loop anomalous dimensions. We find that at one loop, scaling dimensions of these candidates grow with $\epsilon$, while it should decrease down to $N$ for the recombination to occur. We conclude that multiplet recombination is unlikely.

Title: Neural Network Quantum Field Theory from Transformer Architectures
Authors: Dmitry S. Ageev, Yulia A. Ageeva
Abstract: We propose a neural-network construction of Euclidean scalar quantum field theories from transformer attention heads, defining $n$-point correlators by averaging over random network parameters in the NN-QFT framework. For a single attention head, shared random softmax weights couple different width coordinates and induce non-Gaussian field statistics that persist in the infinite-width limit $d_k\to\infty$. We compute the two-point function in an attention-weight representation and show how Euclidean-invariant kernels can be engineered via random-feature token embeddings. We then analyze the connected four-point function and identify an "independence-breaking" contribution, expressible as a covariance over query-key weights, which remains finite at infinite width. Finally, we show that summing many independent heads with standard $1/N_h$ normalization suppresses connected non-Gaussian correlators as $1/N_h$, yielding a Gaussian NN-QFT in the large-head limit.

Title: Excited String States and D-branes from Infinite Width Neural Networks
Authors: Dmitry S. Ageev, Yulia A. Ageeva
Abstract: We explore recent proposal to represent worldsheet string path integrals by integrating over parameters of a wide random-feature neural network whose output is identified with the embedding field $X^\mu$. In this paper we extend it focusing on scattering with excited states insertions and for worldsheets with boundaries introducing fixed-feature Gaussian normal-ordering prescription for derivative composites (removing the neural contact term at finite width), and propose realization of mixed Neumann/Dirichlet boundary conditions interpreted as a neural D$p$-brane. As concrete outputs, we derive the sphere four-point integrand with a single $(1,1)$ insertion and the disk four-tachyon amplitude on a D$p$-brane, recovering the expected derivative prefactors, boundary exponents, and momentum-conservation limits after renormalization.

Title: Field-driven Ion Pairing Dynamics in Concentrated Electrolytes
Authors: Seokjin Moon, David T. Limmer
Abstract: We investigate ion pairing dynamics in electrolytes driven far from equilibrium using molecular simulations and nonequilibrium rate theory. Focusing on 0.5 M $\mathrm{LiPF_6}$ in water and acetonitrile under uniform electric fields, we compute transition path theory observables including reactive fluxes and mean first-passage times of ion pairing. Moreover, we introduce a dynamical proxy of free-ion population, where its field-induced change is strongly correlated with the nonlinear enhancement of conductivity, yielding an increase of $40 \ \%$ at 50 mV/Å in acetonitrile, compared to less than $10 \ \%$ in aqueous electrolytes. Further kinetic analysis elucidates that Onsager's classical theory substantially overestimates field-induced enhancement of ion pair dissociation in molecular electrolytes. This discrepancy arises from solvent-mediated dynamical pathways and field-induced dielectric decrement that suppress ion pair dissociation within explicit solvents, highlighting that a faithful description of molecular details is essential. Our results provide a molecular interpretation of nonlinear electrolyte transport beyond continuum theories and establish a general framework for quantifying nonequilibrium reaction kinetics in condensed phase systems.

Title: Cosmological production of dark matter in the Universe and in the laboratory
Authors: Álvaro Parra-López
Abstract: This thesis investigates cosmological particle production within Quantum Field Theory in Curved Spacetimes, both as a dark matter mechanism and through analog simulations using Bose-Einstein condensates. While a full theory of Quantum Gravity remains elusive, studying quantum fields on curved backgrounds provides essential insights into the early Universe. We focus on how dynamical spacetimes, particularly during inflation, generate particles from spectator fields influenced solely by geometry. The work is divided into four parts. Part I establishes the theoretical framework, covering cosmology, inflation, and the principles of analog gravity. Part II analyzes particle production in various inflationary models, showing that scalar and vector fields can account for observed dark matter abundance, especially through tachyonic instabilities. Part III explores BEC experiments, mapping phonons to scalar fields in expanding universes. We demonstrate the reconstruction of expansion histories, reinterpret production as a scattering problem, and propose methods to measure entanglement between produced pairs. Finally, Part IV addresses quantum vacuum ambiguities and the impact of non-adiabatic transitions during the "switch-on" and "switch-off" of expansion. Ultimately, this work highlights the viability of cosmological particle production for dark matter and the power of analog experiments to enhance our understanding of quantum effects in curved spacetimes.

Title: Quantum Brownian motion with non-Gaussian noises: Fluctuation-Dissipation Relation and nonlinear Langevin equation
Authors: Hing-Tong Cho, Bei-Lok Hu
Abstract: Building upon the work of Hu, Paz, and Zhang [1,2] on open quantum systems we consider the quantum Brownian motion (QBM) model with one oscillator (position variable $x$) as the system, {\it nonlinearly} coupled to an environment of $N$ harmonic oscillators (with mass $m_n$, natural frequency $\omega_n$, position $q_n$ and momentum $p_n$ variables) in the form $\sum_{n}\left(v_{n1}(x)q_{n}^{k}+v_{n2}(x)p_{n}^{l}\right)$ where $k, l$ are integers (the present work only considers the $k=l=2$ cases). The vertex functions $v_{n1}, v_{n2} $ are of the form $v_{n1}=\lambda C_{n1} f(x), v_{n2}(x)=-\lambda\,C_{n2}m_{n}^{-2}\omega_{n}^{-2}f(x)$ where $C_{n1,2}$ are the coupling constants with the $n$th oscillator, $f(x)$ is any arbitrary function of $x$, and $\lambda$ is a dimensionless constant. Employing the closed-time-path formalism the influence action $S_{IF}$ is calculated using a perturbative expansion in $\lambda$. It is possible to identify the terms in $S_{IF}$ quadratic or higher in $\Delta(s)\equiv f(x_{+}(s))-f(x_{-}(s))$ to constitute the noise kernel, while terms linear in $\Delta$ to that of the dissipation kernel. The non-Gaussian noise kernel gives rise to non-zero three-point correlation function of the corresponding stochastic force. The pathway presented here should be useful for the exploration of \textit{non-Gaussian properties of systems nonlinearly coupled with their environments}; examples in early universe cosmology and in quantum optomechanics (QOM) are mentioned. A modified fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR) is also established, which ensures the consistency of the model and the accuracy of results even at higher perturbative orders. Another result of significance is the derivation of a nonlinear Langevin equation which is expected to be useful for many open quantum system applications.

Title: Coarse-Grained Boltzmann Generators
Authors: Weilong Chen, Bojun Zhao, Jan Eckwert, Julija Zavadlav
Abstract: Sampling equilibrium molecular configurations from the Boltzmann distribution is a longstanding challenge. Boltzmann Generators (BGs) address this by combining exact-likelihood generative models with importance sampling, but their practical scalability is limited. Meanwhile, coarse-grained surrogates enable the modeling of larger systems by reducing effective dimensionality, yet often lack the reweighting process required to ensure asymptotically correct statistics. In this work, we propose Coarse-Grained Boltzmann Generators (CG-BGs), a principled framework that unifies scalable reduced-order modeling with the exactness of importance sampling. CG-BGs act in a coarse-grained coordinate space, using a learned potential of mean force (PMF) to reweight samples generated by a flow-based model. Crucially, we show that this PMF can be efficiently learned from rapidly converged data via force matching. Our results demonstrate that CG-BGs faithfully capture complex interactions mediated by explicit solvent within highly reduced representations, establishing a scalable pathway for the unbiased sampling of larger molecular systems.

Title: A solvable high-dimensional model where nonlinear autoencoders learn structure invisible to PCA while test loss misaligns with generalization
Authors: Vicente Conde Mendes, Lorenzo Bardone, Cédric Koller, Jorge Medina Moreira, Vittorio Erba, Emanuele Troiani, Lenka Zdeborová
Abstract: Many real-world datasets contain hidden structure that cannot be detected by simple linear correlations between input features. For example, latent factors may influence the data in a coordinated way, even though their effect is invisible to covariance-based methods such as PCA. In practice, nonlinear neural networks often succeed in extracting such hidden structure in unsupervised and self-supervised learning. However, constructing a minimal high-dimensional model where this advantage can be rigorously analyzed has remained an open theoretical challenge. We introduce a tractable high-dimensional spiked model with two latent factors: one visible to covariance, and one statistically dependent yet uncorrelated, appearing only in higher-order moments. PCA and linear autoencoders fail to recover the latter, while a minimal nonlinear autoencoder provably extracts both. We analyze both the population risk, and empirical risk minimization. Our model also provides a tractable example where self-supervised test loss is poorly aligned with representation quality: nonlinear autoencoders recover latent structure that linear methods miss, even though their reconstruction loss is higher.

Title: Magneto-optical properties of the neutral silicon-vacancy center in diamond under extreme isotropic strain fields
Authors: Meysam Mohseni, Gergő Thiering, Adam Gali
Abstract: The neutral silicon--vacancy (SiV$^{0}$) center in diamond combines inversion symmetry with optical emission, making it a robust quantum emitter resilient to stray electric fields. Using first-principles density-functional theory, we quantify its response to isotropic strain spanning strong compression and tensile regimes (effective hydrostatic pressures of approximately $-80$ to $180$~GPa). The coexistence of doubly degenerate $e_g$ and $e_u$ levels produces a structural instability captured by a quadratic product Jahn--Teller model. Under isotropic compression, the zero-phonon line blue-shifts nearly linearly while the $E_g$ phonon stiffens, suppressing vibronic instabilities and reducing Jahn--Teller quenching. Consequently, the Ham-reduced excited-state spin--orbit splitting increases substantially and the dark--bright vibronic gap widens. In contrast, isotropic tensile strain enhances vibronic effects and induces symmetry breaking beyond a critical strain, with tunneling-mediated dynamical averaging at the onset. Throughout the symmetry-preserving regime, parity remains well defined, so isotropic strain alone does not activate the dark transition. Charge-transition levels indicate photostability of the emission deep into the compressive regime, and near the highest photostable deformation ($\sim 100$~GPa), the radiative lifetime increases due to a reduced transition dipole moment despite the increasing optical energy. These trends yield compact calibration relations linking optical and spin observables to isotropic strain and establish SiV$^{0}$ as a symmetry-protected, strain-tunable quantum emitter operating into the multi-megabar-equivalent regime.

Title: Between equilibrium and fluctuation: Einstein's heuristic argument and Boltzmann's principle
Authors: Enric Pérez, Antonio Gil
Abstract: We critically revisit Einstein's 1905 heuristic argument for lightquanta, considering its internal coherence and the scope of its applicability. We argue that Einstein's reasoning, often celebrated for its originality, is ambiguous because it can be understood as a fluctuation or as a comparison between equilibrium states. A historical and conceptual analysis of Einstein's use of Boltzmann's principle in those years reveals his evolving stance on its meaning and the role of probability, as well as his persistent doubts about the nature of radiation. We use our analysis to examine the limitations of extending the notion of Einstein's lightquanta across the electromagnetic spectrum: the relevant parameter is not the frequency, but the occupancy number.

Title: Establishing the Magnetoelastic Origin of Spin-Wave Routing through Focused Ion Beam Patterning
Authors: Felix Naunheimer, Johannes Greil, Valentin Ahrens, Levente Maucha, Ádám Papp, György Csaba, Markus Becherer
Abstract: Spin waves are promising information carriers for analog and wave-based computing, requiring compact and precisely engineered scattering landscapes. Focused ion beam (FIB) irradiation enables such control by locally modifying the spin-wave dispersion in yttrium iron garnet (YIG), yet the underlying crystallographic mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we present an experimentally validated framework that attributes FIB-induced spin-wave steering to magnetoelastic effects arising from irradiation-induced lattice dislocations. Following FIB irradiation and wet-chemical etching, local height profiles were obtained by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and used as fixed geometric constraints in fits of spin-wave dispersion relations measured by time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect (trMOKE) microscopy. The dispersion relation was extended by an explicit magnetoelastic field term, treated as a fit parameter. Its evolution reveals three successive deformation regimes, elastic, plastic, and partial amorphization, explaining the observed non-monotonic dependence of the spin-wave wavelength on ion dose. A three-phase deformation scenario based on SRIM simulations reproduces the extracted magnetoelastic field trends, validating the fitting approach. Micromagnetic simulations incorporating strain tensors derived from the experimental magnetoelastic field reproduce the characteristic non-monotonic wavelength behavior. These results establish a physical basis for FIB-engineered graded-index (GRIN) spin-wave landscapes and magnetoelastically programmable magnonic devices.

Title: Emulation of large-scale qubit registers with a phase space approach
Authors: Christian de Correc, Denis Lacroix, Corentin Bertrand
Abstract: A phase-space approach is used and benchmarked for the simulation of the continuous-time evolution of large registers of qubits. It is based on a statistical ensemble of independent mean-field trajectories, where mean-field is introduced at the level of the qubits, substituting quantum fluctuations/correlations with classical ones. The approach only involves at worse a quadratic cost in the system size, allowing to simulate up to several thousands of qubits on a classical computer. It provides qualitatively accurate description of one-qubit observables evolutions, making it a useful reference in comparison to techniques limited to small qubit numbers. The predictive power is however less robust for multi-qubits observables. We benchmark the method on the $k$-local transverse-field Ising model (TFIM), considering a large variety of systems ranging from local to all-to-all interactions, and from weak to strong coupling regimes, with up to 2000 qubits. To showcase the versatility of the approach, simulations on 2D and 3D Ising models are also made.

Authors: Matteo Giordano, Tamas G. Kovacs, Ferenc Pittler
Abstract: We study the localization properties of the low-lying Dirac eigenmodes in QCD near the crossover temperature, using staggered fermions on the lattice. We find that localized low modes, absent at low temperature, appear at a temperature $T_{\mathrm{loc}}$ in the range $155\,\mathrm{MeV}\le T_{\mathrm{loc}}\le 158\,\mathrm{MeV}$, in excellent agreement with the pseudocritical crossover temperature as determined from the chiral condensate and from the light-quark susceptibility.

Title: Noise-balanced multilevel on-the-fly sparse grid surrogates for coupling Monte Carlo models into continuum models with application to heterogeneous catalysis
Authors: Tobias Hülser, Sebastian Matera
Abstract: Multiscale simulations utilizing high-fidelity, microscopic Monte Carlo models to provide the nonlinear response for continuum models can easily become computationally intractable. Surrogate models for the high-fidelity Monte Carlo models can overcome this but come with some challenges. One such challenges arise by the sampling noise in the underlying Monte Carlo data, which leads to uncontrolled errors possibly corrupting the surrogate even though it would be highly accurate in the case of noise-free data. Another challenge arises by the 'curse of dimensionality' when the response depends on many macro-variables. These points are addressed by a novel noise-balanced sparse grids interpolation approach which, in a quasi-optimal fashion, controls the amount of Monte Carlo sampling for each data point. The approach is complemented by a multilevel on-the-fly construction during the multiscale simulation. Besides its efficiency, a particularly appealing feature is the ease of use of the approach with only a single hyperparameter controlling the whole surrogate construction - from the surrogate's accuracy with guaranteed convergence to which data needs to be created with which accuracy. The approach is demonstrated on challenging examples from heterogeneous catalysis, coupling microscopic kinetic Monte Carlo models into macroscopic reactor simulations.

Title: Ergotropic Mpemba crossings in finite-dimensional quantum batteries
Authors: Triyas Sapui, Tanoy Kanti Konar, Aditi Sen De
Abstract: The quantum Mpemba effect is a counterintuitive phenomenon in which a state initially farther from equilibrium relaxes more rapidly than one that starts nearer to equilibrium. In the context of finite-dimensional quantum batteries interacting with an environment, we introduce the notion of an ergotropic Mpemba crossing (EMC), defined by the intersection of ergotropy trajectories during the dynamics. For qubit batteries subjected to amplitude damping noise, we derive a condition for the occurrence of EMC in terms of the relative coherence of the initial states and fully characterize the region of state space that exhibits EMC with respect to a fixed reference state. Interestingly, our analysis reveals that under anisotropic Pauli noise, the emergence of EMC is jointly governed by the coherence and the energy of the initial states. To elucidate the physical origin of EMC, we decompose ergotropy into coherent and incoherent contributions and show that, in qubit systems, the coherent component plays a crucial role for EMC, an observation that strikingly does not extend to three-level batteries. Further, by extending our analysis to non-Markovian environments, we demonstrate that, unlike the Markovian case, non-Markovian dynamics can give rise to multiple Mpemba crossings, with the total number of crossings always being odd. Moreover, analyzing the connection between the EMC and the conventional state Mpemba effect reveals that, for qubits, an EMC necessarily entails a state Mpemba crossing while this correspondence breaks down for qutrits, where EMCs may arise without any state Mpemba crossing.

Title: From Natural Language to Materials Discovery:The Materials Knowledge Navigation Agent
Authors: Genmao Zhuang, Amir Barati Farimani
Abstract: Accelerating the discovery of high-performance materials remains a central challenge across energy, electronics, and aerospace technologies, where traditional workflows depend heavily on expert intuition and computationally expensive simulations. Here we introduce the Materials Knowledge Navigation Agent (MKNA), a language-driven system that translates natural-language scientific intent into executable actions for database retrieval, property prediction, structure generation, and stability evaluation. Beyond automating tool invocation, MKNA autonomously extracts quantitative thresholds and chemically meaningful design motifs from literature and database evidence, enabling data-grounded hypothesis formation. Applied to the search for high-Debye-temperature ceramics, the agent identifies a literature-supported screening criterion (Theta_D > 800 K), rediscovers canonical ultra-stiff materials such as diamond, SiC, SiN, and BeO, and proposes thermodynamically stable, previously unreported Be-C-rich compounds that populate the sparsely explored 1500-1700 K regime. These results demonstrate that MKNA not only finds stable candidates but also reconstructs interpretable design heuristics, establishing a generalizable platform for autonomous, language-guided materials exploration.

Title: Reed-Muller Error-Correction Code Encoder for SFQ-to-CMOS Interface Circuits
Authors: Yerzhan Mustafa, Berker Peköz, Selçuk Köse
Abstract: Data transmission from superconducting digital electronics such as single flux quantum (SFQ) logic to semiconductor (CMOS) circuits is subject to bit errors due to, e.g., flux trapping, process parameter variations (PPV), and fabrication defects. In this paper, a lightweight hardware-efficient error-correction code encoder is designed and analyzed. Particularly, a Reed-Muller code RM(1,3) encoder is implemented with SFQ digital logic. The proposed RM(1,3) encoder converts a 4-bit message into an 8-bit codeword and can detect and correct up to 3- and 1-bit errors, respectively. This encoder circuit is designed using MIT-LL SFQ5ee process and SuperTools/ColdFlux RSFQ cell library. A simulation framework integrating JoSIM simulator and MATLAB script for automated data collection and analysis, is proposed to study the performance of RM(1,3) encoder. The proposed encoder improves the probability of having no bit errors by 6.7% as compared to an encoder-less design under $\pm20\%$ PPV. With $\pm15\%$ and lower PPV, the proposed encoder could correct all errors with at least 99.1% probability. The impact of fabrication defects such as open circuit faults on the encoder circuit is also studied using the proposed framework.

Title: Anomalous diffusion in convergence to effective ergodicity
Authors: M. Süzen
Abstract: The nature of diffusion is usually studied for particles or time-evolving systems. Similar in principle, such studies can be conducted by tracking how a given function of observable properties evolves over time-akin to the evolution of observable functions-referred to as functional-diffusion. This is not the same as the system's individual trajectories, but can be regarded as a meta-trajectory. Following this idea, we measure how the approach to ergodicity evolves over time for the observed magnetization of a full Ising model with an external field. We compute the diffusive behavior of the functional across a range of temperatures via Metropolis and Glauber single-spin-flip dynamics. The system's ensemble-averaged dynamics are computed using expressions from the exact solution. Power-law behavior in the approach to ergodicity provides a classification of anomalies in functional-diffusion, demonstrating nonlinear anomalous behavior over different temperature and field ranges. Studying the ergodicity convergence of these meta-trajectories can help validate and enhance the pedagogical understanding of nonequilibrium thermodynamic systems.

Title: Footprints of the Kitaev spin liquid in the Fano lineshapes of the Raman active optical phonons
Authors: Kexin Feng, Swetlana Swarup, Natalia B. Perkins
Abstract: We develop a theoretical description of the Raman spectroscopy in the spin-phonon coupled Kitaev system and show that it can provide intriguing observable signatures of fractionalized excitations characteristic of the underlying spin liquid phase. In particular, we obtain the explicit form of the phonon modes and construct the coupling Hamiltonians based on $D_{3d}$ symmetry. We then systematically compute the Raman intensity and show that the spin-phonon coupling renormalizes phonon propagators and generates the salient Fano linshape. We find that the temperature evolution of the Fano lineshape displays two crossovers, and the low temperature crossover shows pronounced magnetic field dependence. We thus identify the observable effect of the Majorana fermions and the $Z_2$ gauge fluxes encoded in the Fano lineshape. Our results explain several phonon Raman scattering experiments in the candidate material $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$.

Title: Spectral functions of the strongly interacting 3D Fermi gas
Authors: Christian H. Johansen, Bernhard Frank, Johannes Lang
Abstract: Computing dynamical properties of strongly interacting quantum many-body systems poses a major challenge to theoretical approaches. Usually, one has to resort to numerical analytic continuation of results on imaginary frequencies, which is a mathematically ill-defined procedure. Here, we present an efficient method to compute the spectral functions of the two-component Fermi gas near the strongly interacting unitary limit directly in real frequencies. To this end, we combine the Keldysh path integral that is defined in real time with the self-consistent T-matrix approximation. The latter is known to predict thermodynamic and transport properties in good agreement with experimental observations in ultracold atoms. We validate our method by comparison with thermodynamic quantities obtained from imaginary time calculations and by transforming our real-time propagators to imaginary time. By comparison with state-of-the-art numerical analytic continuation of the imaginary time results, we show that our real-time results give qualitative improvements for dynamical quantities. Moreover, we show that no significant pseudogap regime exists in the self-consistent T-matrix approximation above the critical temperature $T_c$, an issue that has been under significant debate. We close by pointing out the versatile nature of our method as it can be extended to other systems, like the spin- or mass-imbalanced Fermi gas, other Bose-Fermi models, 2D systems as well as systems out of equilibrium.

Title: Shaping non-reciprocal caustic spin-wave beams
Authors: Dinesh Wagle, Daniel Stoeffler, Loic Temdie, Mojtaba Taghipour Kaffash, Vincent Castel, H. Majjad, R. Bernard, Yves Henry, Matthieu Bailleul, M. Benjamin Jungfleisch, Vincent Vlaminck
Abstract: A caustic is a mathematical concept describing the beam formation when the beam envelope is reflected or refracted by a manifold. While caustics are common in a wide range of physical systems, caustics typically exhibit a reciprocal wave propagation and are challenging to control. Here, we utilize the highly anisotropic dispersion and inherent non-reciprocity of a magnonic system to shape non-reciprocal emission of caustic-like spin wave beams in an extended 200 nm thick yttrium iron garnet (YIG) film from a nano-constricted rf waveguide. We introduce a near-field diffraction model to study spin-wave beamforming in homogeneous in-plane magnetized thin films, and reveal the propagation of non-reciprocal spin-wave beams directly emitted from the nanoconstriction by spatially resolved micro-focused Brillouin light spectroscopy (BLS). The experimental results agree well with both micromagnetic simulation, and the near-field diffraction model. The proposed method can be readily implemented to study spin-wave interference at the sub-micron scale, which is central to the development of wave-based computing applications and magnonic devices.

Title: Impact of interface defects on the band alignment and performance of TiO$_2$/MAPI/Cu$_2$O perovskite solar cells

Abstract: Optimizing the interfaces in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is essential for enhancing their performance, improving their stability, and making them commercially viable for large-scale deployment in solar energy harvesting applications. Point defects, like vacancies, have a dual role, as they can inherently provide a proper doping, but they can also reduce the collected current by trap-assisted recombination. Moreover, they can play an active role in ion migration and degradation. Using {\it ab initio} density functional theory (DFT) calculations we investigate the changes in the band alignment induced by interfacial vacancy defects in a TiO$_2$/MAPI/Cu$_2$O based PSC. Depending on the type of the vacancy (Ti, Cu, O, Pb, I) in the oxide and perovskite materials, additional doping is superimposed on the already existing background. Their effect on the performance of the PSCs becomes visible, as shown by SCAPS simulations. The most significant impact is observed for $p$ type doping of TiO$_2$ and $n$ type doping of Cu$_2$O, while the effective doping of the perovskite layer affects one of the two interfaces. We discuss these results based on modifications of the band structure near the active interfaces and provide further insights concerning the optimization of electron and hole collection.

Title: Microscopic theory for electron-phonon coupling in twisted bilayer graphene
Authors: Ziyan Zhu, Thomas P. Devereaux
Abstract: The origin of superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene -- whether phonon-driven or electron-driven -- remains unresolved, in part due to the absence of a quantitative and efficient model for electron-phonon coupling (EPC). In this work, we develop a first-principles-based microscopic theory to calculate EPC in twisted bilayer graphene for arbitrary twist angles without requiring a periodic moiré supercell. Our approach combines a momentum-space continuum model for both electronic and phononic structures with a generalized Eliashberg-McMillan theory beyond the adiabatic approximation. Using this framework, we find that the EPC is strongly enhanced near the magic angle. The superconducting transition temperature induced by low-energy phonons peaks at $1.1^\circ$ around 1 K, and remains finite for a range of angles both below and above the magic angles. We predict that superconductivity persists up to $\sim 1.4^\circ$, where superconductivity has been recently observed despite the dispersive electronic bands. Beyond a large density of states, we identify a key condition for strong EPC: resonance between the electronic bandwidth and the dominant phonon frequencies. We also show that the EPC strength of a specific phonon corresponds to the modification of the moiré potential. In particular, we identify several $\Gamma$-phonon branches that contribute most significantly to the EPC, which are experimentally detectable via Raman spectroscopy.

Title: Observation of Braid-Protected Unpaired Exceptional Points
Authors: Kunkun Wang, J. Lukas K. König, Kang Yang, Lei Xiao, Wei Yi, Emil J. Bergholtz, Peng Xue
Abstract: Spectral degeneracies (dubbed nodal points in momentum space) play fundamental roles in understanding exotic properties of light and matter. In lattice systems, unpaired band-structure degeneracies are subject to well-established no-go (doubling) theorems that universally apply to both closed Hermitian systems and open non-Hermitian systems. However, the non-Abelian braid topology of non-Hermitian multi-band systems provides a loophole to these constraints. Here we successfully leverage this loophole in a non-Hermitian three-band system, implementing an unpaired third-order exceptional point (EP3), which manifests as a non-Abelian monopole. We explicitly demonstrate the intricate braiding topology and non-Abelian, path-dependent, fusion rules underlying the unpaired EP3. The experiment uses a new design of single-photon interferometry, enabling eigenstate and spectral resolutions for multi-band systems with widely tunable parameters. Thus, the union of state-of-the-art experiments, fundamental theory, and everyday concepts such as braids pave the way toward the highly exotic non-Abelian topology unique to non-Hermitian settings.

Title: The $S=\frac{1}{2}$ XY and XYZ models on the two or higher dimensional hypercubic lattice do not possess nontrivial local conserved quantities
Authors: Naoto Shiraishi, Hal Tasaki
Abstract: We study the $S=\frac{1}{2}$ quantum spin system on the $d$-dimensional hypercubic lattice with $d\ge2$ with uniform nearest-neighbor interaction of the XY or XYZ type and arbitrary uniform magnetic field. By extending the method recently developed for quantum spin chains, we prove that the model possesses no local conserved quantities except for the trivial ones, such as the Hamiltonian. This result strongly suggests that the model is non-integrable. We note that our result applies to the XX model without a magnetic field, which is one of the easiest solvable models in one dimension.

Title: Kitaev-Ising-$J_1$-$J_2$ model: a density matrix renormalization group study
Authors: A. V. Kapranov, R. S. Akzyanov
Abstract: We numerically study the Kitaev honeycomb model with the additional XX Ising interaction between the nearest and the next nearest neighbors (Kitaev-Ising-$J_1$-$J_2$ model), by using the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method. Such additional interaction correspond to the nearest and diagonal interactions on the square lattice. Phase diagram of the bare Kitaev model consist of low entangled commensurate magnetic phases and entangled Kitaev spin liquid. Anisotropic Ising interaction allows the entangled quantum paramagnetic phases in the phase diagram, which in the absence of the magnetic field previously was predicted for more complex type of interaction. We study the scaling law of the entanglement entropy and the bond dimension of the matrix product state with the size of the system. In addition, we propose an optimization algorithm to prevent DMRG from getting stuck in the low-entangled phases.

Title: Coherent control through phonon anharmonicity
Authors: Gili Scharf, Tomer Hasharoni, Lara Donval, Leah Ben Gur, Alon Ron
Abstract: Anharmonic lattice vibrations play a key role in many physical phenomena. They govern the heat conductivity of solids, strongly affect the phonon spectra, play a prominent role in soft mode phase transitions, allow ultrafast engineering of material properties and more. The most direct evidence for anharmonicity is to measure the oscillation frequency changing as a function of the oscillation amplitude. For lattice vibrations, this is not a trivial task, and anharmonicity is probed indirectly through its effects on thermodynamic properties and spectral features or through coherent decay of one mode to another. However, measurement and control of the anharmonicity of a single Raman mode is still lacking. We show that ultrafast double pump-probe spectroscopy could be used to directly observe frequency shifts of Raman phonons as a function of the oscillation amplitude and disentangle the coherent contributions from quasi-harmonic sources such as temperature and changes to the carrier density in the thermoelectric materials SnTe and SnSe. Moreover, we show that coherent displacive phononic excitations in tandem with electron-phonon coupling is a pathway to dynamically control phonon anharmonicity. Our results have dramatic implications for the material engineering of future thermoelectrics. Moreover, our methodology could be used to isolate the basic mechanisms driving optically induced phase transitions and other nonlinear phenomena based on their unique timestamps.

Title: Nonpertubative Many-Body Theory for the Two-Dimensional Hubbard Model at Low Temperature: From Weak to Strong Coupling Regimes
Authors: Ruitao Xiao, Yingze Su, Junnian Xiong, Hui Li, Huaqing Huang, Dingping Li
Abstract: In theoretical studies of two-dimensional (2D) systems, the Mermin-Wagner theorem prevents continuous symmetry breaking at any finite temperature, thus forbidding a Landau phase transition at a critical temperature $T_c$. The difficulty arises when many-body theoretical studies predict a Landau phase transition at finite temperatures, which contradicts the Mermin-Wagner theorem and is termed a pseudo phase transition. To tackle this problem, we systematically develop a symmetrization scheme, defined as averaging physical quantities over all symmetry-breaking states, thus ensuring that it preserves the Mermin-Wagner theorem. We apply the symmetrization scheme to the GW-covariance calculation for the 2D repulsive Hubbard model at half-filling in the intermediate-to-strong coupling regime and at low temperatures, obtaining the one-body Green's function and spin-spin correlation function, and benchmark them against Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) with good this http URL spin-spin correlation functions are approached within the covariance theory, a general method for calculating two-body correlation functions from a one-particle starting point, such as the GW formalism used here, which ensures the preservation of the fundamental fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR) and Ward-Takahashi identities (WTI). With the FDR and WTI satisfied, we conjecture that the $\chi$-sum rule, a fundamental relation from the Pauli exclusion principle, can be used to probe the reliability of many-body methods, and demonstrate this by comparing the GW-covariance and mean-field-covariance approaches. This work provides a novel framework to investigate the strong-coupling and doped regime of the 2D Hubbard model, which is believed to be applicable to real high-$T_c$ cuprate superconductors.

Title: Magnetoelectric training of multiferroic domains in Mn$_2$GeO$_4$
Authors: Naëmi Leo, Jonathan S. White, Michel Kenzelmann, Takashi Honda, Tsuyoshi Kimura, Dennis Meier, Manfred Fiebig
Abstract: Magnetoelectric multiferroics promise direct cross-control between coexisting ferroelectric and ferromagnetic orders, which is of interest for applications in magnetism and spintronics. A particularly interesting type of cross-control is found in spin-spiral multiferroic Mn$_2$GeO$_4$, where a ferroelectric multi-domain distribution can be globally inverted by a single magnetic field sweep. In this work we consider the initial domain evolution from zero-field cooling, imaging the evolution of domains under both magnetic and electric fields via optical second harmonic generation. We find that polarization and magnetization domains form independently when entering the multiferroic phase, and a single deterministic initialisation procedure, spanning three quarters of a field cycle, is required to achieve reliable magnetoelectric cross-coupling. This initialisation behaviour originates from a deterministic pathway from metastable to equilibrium domain patterns, in contrast to more common and less reliable domain "training" procedures that require repeated field cycles. Understanding the initial domain evolution thus enables reliable cross-control in magnetoelectric devices with highly interlinked order parameters.

Title: Unconventional orbital currents and torques due to ferro-rotational orbital textures
Authors: Daegeun Jo, Peter M. Oppeneer
Abstract: Orbital angular momentum transport has emerged as a promising route for manipulating magnetic devices, yet its generation has largely relied on the conventional orbital Hall effect. Here, we show that ferro-rotational order enables the electrical generation of unconventional orbital currents. These orbital currents represent the orbital counterparts of spin currents due to ferromagnetic order, but arise from rotation-induced symmetry breaking rather than time-reversal symmetry breaking or spin-orbit coupling. Using tight-binding models, we identify the underlying intrinsic, nonrelativistic mechanism categorized as an electric hexadecapole moment and corroborate our findings with first-principles calculations for the ferro-rotational material TiAu$_4$. We further show that these rotation-induced orbital currents lead to surface orbital accumulation and unconventional orbital torque in a ferro-rotational/ferromagnetic metallic bilayer, allowing deterministic field-free switching. Our findings unveil a novel pathway for generating orbital currents beyond the conventional orbital Hall effect, broadening the landscape of orbitronics research to include novel ferroic materials and higher-order electric multipoles.

Title: Microscopic Mechanism of Anyon Superconductivity Emerging from Fractional Chern Insulators
Authors: Fabian Pichler, Clemens Kuhlenkamp, Michael Knap, Ashvin Vishwanath
Abstract: Fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states and superconductors typically require contrasting conditions, yet recent experiments have observed them in the same device. A natural explanation is that mobile anyons give rise to superconductivity; however, this mechanism requires binding of minimally charged anyons to establish an unusual energy hierarchy. This scenario has mostly been studied with effective theories, leaving open the question of how anyon superconductivity can arise from repulsive interactions. Here, we show that such an energy hierarchy of anyons arises naturally in fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) at fillings $\nu = 2/(4p \mp 1)$ when they are driven toward a quantum phase transition into a ``semion crystal'' -- an exotic charge-density-wave (CDW) insulator with semion topological order. Near the transition, Cooper-pair correlations are enhanced, so that a conventional charge-2e superconductor appears with doping. Guided by these insights, we analyze a microscopic realization in a repulsive Hubbard-Hofstadter model. Tensor network simulations at $\nu = 2/3$ reveal a robust FCI that, with increasing interactions, transitions into the semion crystal. Finding a stable semion crystal in such a minimal model highlights it as a viable state competing with conventional CDW and FQH states. In the vicinity of this transition, we find markedly enhanced Cooper pairing, consistent with our theory that the 2e/3 anyon is cheaper than a pair of isolated e/3 anyons. Doping near the transition should in general lead to doping Cooper pairs and charge-2e superconductivity, with chiral edge modes of alternating central charge $c = \pm2$, which can coexist with translation symmetry breaking. Our framework unifies recent approaches to anyon superconductivity, reconciles it with strong repulsion and provides guidance for flat band moiré materials such as recent experiments in twisted MoTe$_2$.

Title: Real-Space Approach to Light-Induced Hall Transport in Disordered Materials
Authors: Jorge Martinez Romeral, Luis M.Canonico, Aron W.Cummings, Stephan Roche
Abstract: We introduce a linear-scaling real-space methodology to compute time-resolved electrical responses of materials driven far-from-equilibrium, with energy relaxation and disorder treated on equal footing. Applying this approach to AB-stacked (Bernal) bilayer graphene, driven by a circularly polarized optical pulse, we observe the generation of a finite Hall conductivity. This Hall signal oscillates during optical driving and remains sizable after the light is switched off before relaxing toward equilibrium. Remarkably, this dynamical Hall response is robust in the presence of realistic descriptions of disorder, suggesting that disorder and relaxation dynamics can be leveraged as design parameters rather than being limitations. More broadly, our new methodology enables the investigation of electrical responses in driven, complex disordered quantum materials and highlights how engineered energy transfer pathways can enable ultrafast optoelectronic functionality.

Title: A fast algorithm for 2D Rigidity Percolation
Authors: Nina Javerzat, Daniele Notarmuzi
Abstract: Rigidity Percolation is a crucial framework for describing rigidity transitions in amorphous systems. We present a new, efficient algorithm to study central-force Rigidity Percolation in two dimensions. This algorithm combines the Pebble Game algorithm, the Newman-Ziff approach to Connectivity Percolation, as well as novel rigorous results in rigidity theory, to exactly identify rigid clusters over the full bond concentration range, in a time that scales as $N^{1.02}$ for a system of $N$ nodes. We perform extensive numerical simulations with systems larger than $500$ million nodes, far beyond the previous limitations. We obtain new, precise estimates for the critical exponents, $\nu=1.1694(8)$ and $D_f=1.8423(7)$, and locate the critical threshold at $p_c = 0.6602741(4)$. Besides opening the way to further accurate numerical studies of Rigidity Percolation, our work provides new rigorous theoretical insights on specific cluster merging mechanisms that distinguish it from the standard Connectivity Percolation problem.

Title: Quantum Spin Glass in the Two-Dimensional Disordered Heisenberg Model via Foundation Neural-Network Quantum States
Authors: Luciano Loris Viteritti, Riccardo Rende, Giacomo Bracci Testasecca, Jacopo Niedda, Roderich Moessner, Giuseppe Carleo, Antonello Scardicchio
Abstract: We investigate the two-dimensional frustrated quantum Heisenberg model with bond disorder on nearest-neighbor couplings using the recently introduced Foundation Neural-Network Quantum States framework, which enables accurate and efficient computation of disorder-averaged observables with a single variational optimization. Simulations on large lattices reveal an extended region of the phase diagram where long-range magnetic order vanishes in the thermodynamic limit, while the overlap order parameter, which characterizes quantum spin glass states, remains finite. These findings, supported by a semiclassical analysis based on a large-spin expansion, provide compelling evidence that the spin glass phase is stable against quantum fluctuations, unlike the classical case where it disappears at any finite temperature.

Title: Superfluid stiffness of superconductors with delicate topology
Authors: Tijan Prijon, Sebastian D. Huber, Kukka-Emilia Huhtinen
Abstract: We consider superconductivity in two-dimensional delicate topological bands, where the total Chern number vanishes but the Brillouin zone can be divided into subregions with a quantized nontrivial Chern number. We formulate a lower bound on the geometric contribution to the superfluid weight in terms of the sum of the absolute values of these sub-Brillouin zone Chern numbers. We verify this bound in Chern dartboard insulators, where the delicate topology is protected by mirror symmetry. In iso-orbital models, where the mirror representation is the same along all high-symmetry lines, the lower bound increases linearly with the number of mirror planes. This work points to delicate bands as promising candidates for particularly stable superconductivity, especially in narrow bands where the kinetic energy is suppressed due to lattice effects.

Title: Dielectric Properties of Single Crystal Calcium Tungstate
Authors: Elrina Hartman, Michael E Tobar, Ben T McAllister, Jeremy F Bourhill, Andreas Erb, Maxim Goryachev
Abstract: This investigation employed microwave whispering gallery mode (WGM) analysis to characterize the dielectric properties of a cylindrical, single-crystal sample of calcium tungstate (CaWO$_4$). Through investigation of quasi-transverse\hyp{}magnetic and quasi-transverse\hyp{}electric mode families, we can assess loss mechanisms and relative permittivity from room temperature down to cryogenic conditions. We report the biaxial permittivity values of $\epsilon_{||} = 9.029 \pm 0.009$ and $\epsilon_{\perp} = 10.761 \pm 0.01$ at $295$ K, and $\epsilon_{||} = 8.794 \pm 0.009$ and $\epsilon_{\perp} = 10.440 \pm 0.01$ at $4$ K. Components are denoted with respect to the c\hyp{}axis of the crystal unit cell. The parallel component agrees well with the published literature at MHz frequencies; however, the perpendicular component is $4.8$\% lower. The WGM technique offers greater precision, with accuracy limited primarily by the uncertainty in the crystal's dimensions. WGMs also serve as sensitive probes of lattice dynamics, enabling monitoring of temperature-dependent loss mechanisms. At room temperature, the measured loss tangents were $\tan\delta_{||}^{295,\mathrm{K}} = (4.1 \pm 1.4) \times 10^{-5}$ and $\tan\delta_{\perp}^{295,\mathrm{K}} = (3.64 \pm 0.92) \times 10^{-5}$. Upon cooling to 4 K, the loss tangents improved by approximately two orders of magnitude, reaching $\tan\delta_{||}^{4,\mathrm{K}} = (1.56 \pm 0.52) \times 10^{-7}$ and $\tan\delta_{\perp}^{4,\mathrm{K}} = (2.05 \pm 0.79) \times 10^{-7}$. These cryogenic values are higher than those reported in prior studies, likely due to a magnetic loss channel associated with an unidentified paramagnetic spin ensemble. These findings have implications for the use of CaWO$_4$ in applications such as spin-based quantum systems and cryogenic bolometry, highlighting the potential of WGMs for novel sensing applications.

Title: Quantum typicality approach to energy flow between two spin-chain domains at different temperatures
Authors: Laurenz Beckemeyer, Markus Kraft, Mariel Kempa, Dirk Schuricht, Robin Steinigeweg
Abstract: We discuss a quantum typicality approach to examine systems composed of two subsystems at different temperatures. While dynamical quantum typicality is usually used to simulate high-temperature dynamics, we also investigate low-temperature dynamics using the method. To test our method, we investigate the energy current between subsystems at different temperatures in various paradigmatic spin-1/2 chains, specifically the XX chain, the critical transverse-field Ising chain, and the XXZ chain. We compare our numerics to existing analytical results and find a convincing agreement for the energy current in the steady state for all considered models and temperatures.

Title: Deterministic roughening in the dc-driven precessional regime of domain walls
Authors: E. F. Pusiol, V. Lecomte, S. Bustingorry, A. B. Kolton
Abstract: We numerically study the dynamics of extended domain walls in homogeneous ferromagnets driven by a uniform magnetic field at zero temperature. Using both micromagnetic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert simulations and a collective-coordinate description, we show that flat chiral domain walls become linearly unstable above the Walker breakdown field and below a higher threshold, provided their length exceeds a characteristic scale. This instability is captured by a quasi-universal spectral stability diagram, parameterized solely by the Gilbert damping, which predicts the onset of deviations from rigid-wall behavior. Beyond the linear regime, large domain walls with bands of unstable modes develop spatiotemporal chaos, intricate Bloch-line dynamics, and deterministic roughening. At a critical field, the system undergoes a dynamical phase transition from a flat to a rough moving phase with universal features. Our results provide a framework for addressing domain-wall dynamics in the presence of thermal fluctuations and quenched disorder by disentangling their effects from intrinsic deterministic instabilities.

Title: SO(n) Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki states as conformal boundary states of integrable SU(n) spin chains
Authors: Yueshui Zhang, Ying-Hai Wu, Meng Cheng, Hong-Hao Tu
Abstract: We construct a class of conformal boundary states in the $\mathrm{SU}(n)_1$ Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) conformal field theory (CFT) using the symmetry embedding $\mathrm{Spin}(n)_2 \subset \mathrm{SU}(n)_1$. These boundary states are beyond the standard Cardy construction and possess $\mathrm{SO}(n)$ symmetry. The $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ Uimin-Lai-Sutherland (ULS) spin chains, which realize the $\mathrm{SU}(n)_1$ WZW model on the lattice, allow us to identify these boundary states as the ground states of the $\mathrm{SO}(n)$ Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki spin chains. Using the integrability of the $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ ULS model, we analytically compute the corresponding Affleck-Ludwig boundary entropy using exact overlap formulas. Our results unveil intriguing connections between exotic boundary states in CFT and integrable lattice models, thus providing deep insights into the interplay of symmetry, integrability, and boundary critical phenomena.

Title: Entropic balance with feedback control: information equalities and tight inequalities
Authors: Natalia Ruiz-Pino, Antonio Prados
Abstract: We consider overdamped physical systems evolving under a feedback-controlled fluctuating potential and in contact with a thermal bath at temperature $T$. A Markovian description of the dynamics, which keeps only the last value of the control action, is advantageous -- both from the theoretical and the practical side -- for the entropy balance. Novel second-law equalities and bounds for the extractable work are obtained, the latter being both tighter and easier to evaluate than those in the literature based on the whole chain of controller actions. The Markovian framework also allows us to prove that the bound for the extractable work that incorporates the unavailable information is saturated in a wide class of physical systems, for error-free measurements. These results are illustrated in model systems. For imperfect measurements, there appears an interval of measurement uncertainty, including the point at which work ceases to be extracted, where the new Markovian bound is tighter than the unavailable information bound.

Title: Observation of mirror-odd and mirror-even spin texture in ultra-thin epitaxially-strained RuO2 films
Authors: Yichen Zhang, Seung Gyo Jeong, Luca Buiarelli, Seungjun Lee, Yucheng Guo, Jiaqin Wen, Hang Li, Sreejith Nair, In Hyeok Choi, Zheng Ren, Ziqin Yue, Alexei Fedorov, Sung-Kwan Mo, Junichiro Kono, Jong Seok Lee, Tony Low, Turan Birol, Rafael M. Fernandes, Milan Radovic, Bharat Jalan, Ming Yi
Abstract: Recently, rutile RuO$_2$ has attracted renewed interest due to expectations of prominent altermagnetic spin-splitting. However, accumulating experimental evidence suggests that in its bulk and thick-film forms, RuO$_2$ does not display any form of magnetic ordering. Despite this, the spin structure of RuO$_2$ remains largely unexplored in the ultra-thin limit, where substrate-imposed epitaxial strain can be substantial. Here, we employ spin-resolved angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, supported by ab-initio calculations, to reveal the electronic structure of 2.7~nm-thick epitaxial RuO$_2$ heterostructures. We observe an unconventional spin texture characterized by the coexistence of mirror-even and mirror-odd momentum-dependent components. A comprehensive symmetry analysis rules out nonmagnetic origins of this spin texture. These findings suggest an emergent non-relativistic spin structure enabled by epitaxial strain in the ultra-thin limit, marking a distinct departure from the behavior of relaxed or bulk RuO$_2$. Our work opens new perspectives for exploring symmetry-breaking mechanisms and spin textures in oxide heterostructures.

Title: Finite temperature dopant-induced spin reorganization explored via tensor networks in the two-dimensional $t$-$J$ model
Authors: Yintai Zhang, Aritra Sinha, Marek M. Rams, Jacek Dziarmaga
Abstract: We study the two-dimensional $t$--$J$ model at finite temperature directly in the thermodynamic limit using purification represented by an infinite projected entangled-pair state (iPEPS). We reach temperatures down to $T/t=0.1$ and hole concentrations up to $1-n\simeq0.25$, and provide benchmark thermodynamic-limit results for the specific heat, uniform susceptibility, and charge compressibility. We identify a susceptibility maximum $T^\ast$ that tracks the buildup of short-range antiferromagnetism and a shallow compressibility enhancement upon cooling in the same doping window. To expose the underlying microscopic mechanism, we introduce dopant-conditioned multi-point correlators that quantify how holes reorganize nearby exchange: single holes weaken adjacent antiferromagnetic bonds, while nearest-neighbor hole pairs produce a cooperative response that reinforces antiferromagnetism on the parallel plaquette edge. Over the same parameter window, $d$-wave pairing correlations remain short-ranged. These results provide experiment-compatible thermodynamic-limit benchmarks and establish dopant-conditioned correlators as incisive probes of finite-temperature spin-texture reorganization in doped Mott insulators.

Title: Emergence of nematic loop-current bond order in Kagome metals near van Hove singularities
Authors: Alex Friedlan, Hae-Young Kee
Abstract: The recently-discovered family of Kagome metals has attracted significant interest due to reports of charge-bond order, orbital magnetism, and superconductivity. Some of these phases may exhibit time-reversal symmetry breaking. More recently, experiments have reported the emergence of nematic order that lowers the rotational symmetry of the system from sixfold to twofold. Here we investigate the mechanism behind a nematic loop-current bond order (NLCBO) that breaks both rotational and time-reversal symmetries. Examining an effective patch model that captures one $p$-type and one $m$-type van Hove singularity at each $M$ point, we find that frustration of the complex order-parameter phases leads to NLCBO. We further present conditions for overcoming other competing phases, including isotropic charge-bond and loop-current orders. Applying our findings to a previously studied model for $\mathrm{A}\mathrm{V}_3\mathrm{Sb}_5$ $(\mathrm{A}=\mathrm{K,Rb,Cs})$, we find that NLCBO emerges within a small region of phase space within mean-field theory. Our theory provides a microscopic description that goes beyond symmetry-allowed free-energy analyses and is broadly applicable to other Kagome metals featuring van Hove singularities near the Fermi level.

Title: Beyond the non-Hermitian skin effect: scaling-controlled topology from Exceptional-Bound Bands
Authors: Mengjie Yang, Ching Hua Lee
Abstract: We establish a novel mechanism for topological transitions in non-Hermitian systems that are controlled by the system size. Based on a new paradigm known as exceptional-bound (EB) band engineering, its mechanism hinges on the unique critical scaling behavior near an exceptional point, totally unrelated to the well-known non-Hermitian skin effect. Through a series of ansatz models, we analytically derive and numerically demonstrate how topological transitions depend on the system size with increasingly sophisticated topological phase boundaries. Our approach can be generically applied to design scaling-dependent bands in multi-dimensional lattices, gapped or gapless, challenging established critical and entanglement behavior. It can be experimentally demonstrated in any non-Hermitian platform with versatile couplings or multi-orbital unit cells, such as photonic crystals, as well as classical and quantum circuits. The identification of this new EB band mechanism provides new design principles for engineering band structures through scaling-dependent phenomena unique to non-Hermitian systems.

Title: Anomalous Diffusion in Driven Electrolytes due to Hydrodynamic Fluctuations
Authors: Ramin Golestanian
Abstract: The stochastic dynamics of tracers arising from hydrodynamic fluctuations in a driven electrolyte is studied using a self-consistent field-theory framework in all dimensions. A plethora of scaling behaviour that includes two distinct regimes of anomalous diffusion is found, and the crossovers between them are characterized in terms of the different tuning parameters. A short-time ballistic regime is found to be accessible beyond two dimensions, whereas a long-time diffusive regime is found to be present only at four dimensions and above. The results showcase how long-ranged hydrodynamic interactions can dominate the dynamics of non-equilibrium steady states in ionic suspensions and produce strong fluctuations despite the presence of Debye screening.

Title: Magnetic Materials for Quantum Magnonics
Authors: Rostyslav O. Serha, Carsten Dubs, Andrii V. Chumak
Abstract: Quantum magnonics studies the quantum properties of magnons, the quanta of spin waves, and their application in quantum information processing. Progress in this field depends on identifying magnetic materials with characteristics tailored to the diverse requirements of magnonics and quantum magnonics. For single-magnon excitation, its control, hybrid coupling, and entanglement, the most critical property is the ability to support long magnon lifetimes. This perspective reviews established and emerging magnetic materials, including ferromagnetic metals, Heusler compounds, antiferromagnets, altermagnets, organic and 2D van der Waals magnets, hexaferrites, europium chalcogenides, and in particular yttrium iron garnet (YIG), highlighting their key characteristics. YIG remains the benchmark, with bulk crystals supporting sub-microsecond Kittel-mode lifetimes and ultra-pure spheres achieving $\sim18\,\mu$s for dipolar-exchange magnons at millikelvin temperatures. However, thin YIG films on gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) substrates suffer from severe lifetime reduction due to substrate-induced losses. In contrast, YIG films on a new lattice matched, diamagnetic alternative, yttrium scandium gallium/aluminum garnet (YSGAG), overcomes these limitations and preserves low magnetic damping down to millikelvin temperatures. These advances provide a practical pathway toward ultralong-living magnons in thin films, enabling scalable quantum magnonics with coherent transport, strong magnon-photon, magnon-qubit coupling, and integrated quantum networks.

Title: Thermal Hall conductivity of semimetallic graphite dominated by ambipolar phonon drag
Authors: Qiaochao Xiang, Xiaokang Li, Xiaodong Guo, Zengwei Zhu, Kamran Behnia
Abstract: It is now known that in addition to electrons, other quasi-particles such as phonons and magnons can also generate a thermal Hall signal. Graphite is a semimetal with extremely mobile charge carriers of both signs and a large lattice thermal conductivity. We present a study of the thermal Hall effect in highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) samples with electronic, phononic and phonon drag contributions to the thermal Hall signal. The measured thermal Hall conductivity ($\kappa_{xy}$) is two orders of magnitude higher than what is expected by electronic carriers according to the electrical Hall conductivity and the Wiedemann-Franz law, yielding a record Hall Lorenz number of $164.9\times10^{-8}V^2 K^{-2}$ ($\sim$67$L_0$) - the largest ever observed in a metal. The temperature dependence of the thermal Hall conductivity significantly differs from its longitudinal counterpart, ruling out a purely phononic origin of the non-electronic component. Based on the temperature dependence and the amplitudes of the Seebeck and Nernst responses, we demonstrate that ambipolar phonon drag dominates the thermal Hall response of graphite.

Title: Theoretical study of orbital torque: Dependence on ferromagnet species and nonmagnetic layer thickness
Authors: Daegeun Jo, Peter M. Oppeneer
Abstract: The manipulation of magnetization in ferromagnetic metals (FMs) through orbital torque (OT) has emerged as a promising route for energy-efficient magnetic devices without relying on heavy metals. While Ti and Cu are among the most extensively studied light nonmagnetic metals (NMs) for OT devices, theoretical calculations of the resulting torque have remained limited. Here, we present a systematic and quantitative theoretical study of current-induced torques in Ti/FM and Cu/FM (FM = Co, Ni) bilayers using realistic tight-binding models derived from \textit{ab initio} electronic structures. We find that the torque in Ti/FM is larger for Ni than for Co, but this trend does not necessarily hold in Cu/FM, revealing that the FM dependence of OT is not universal but varies with the orbital current source. Moreover, the dependence of OT on NM thickness clearly indicates its NM bulk origin in both Ti- and Cu-based systems. Notwithstanding, the quantitative characteristics of OT cannot be explained by a simplified picture based on the individual bulk properties of the NM or FM layers. These results provide microscopic insight and practical guidance for designing light-metal-based orbitronic devices.

Title: Cascade of topological phase transitions and revival of topological zero modes in imperfect double helical liquids
Authors: Anna Ohorodnyk, Chen-Hsuan Hsu
Abstract: Two parallel helical edge channels hosting interacting electrons, when proximitized by local and nonlocal pairings, can host time-reversal-invariant pairs of topological zero modes at the system corners. Here we show that realistic imperfections substantially enrich the physics of such proximitized double helical liquids. Specifically, we analyze this platform and its fractional counterparts in the presence of pairing and interaction asymmetries between the two channels, as well as random spin-flip terms arising from either magnetic disorder or coexisting charge disorder and external magnetic fields. Using renormalization-group analysis, we determine how Coulomb interactions, pairings, and magnetic disorder collectively influence the transport behavior and topological properties of the double helical liquid. As the system transitions from class DIII to class BDI, an additional topological phase supporting a single Majorana zero mode per corner emerges. We further show how additional pairing or Coulomb asymmetry influences the stability of various topological phases and uncovers a revival of Majorana zero modes and cascades of transitions through topological phases characterized by a $\mathbb {Z}$ invariant, which are accessible through controlling the electrical screening effect. We also analyze the spatial structure of the zero modes and the bulk gap closing through channel-resolved density profiles. In contrast to conventional understanding, disorder is not merely detrimental, as it in general allows for a tuning knob that qualitatively reshapes the topological superconductivity in imperfect helical liquids.

Title: Theory of Out-of-Time-Ordered Transport
Authors: Ruchira Mishra, Jiaozi Wang, Silvia Pappalardi, Luca V. Delacrétaz
Abstract: We construct an effective field theory (EFT) that captures the universal behavior of out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) at late times in generic quantum many-body systems with conservation laws. The EFT hinges on a generalization of the strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking pattern adapted to out-of-time-order observables, and reduces to conventional fluctuating hydrodynamics when time-ordered observables are probed. We use the EFT to explain different power-law behavior observed in OTOCs at late times, and show that many OTOCs are entirely fixed by conventional transport data. Nevertheless, we show that a specific combination of OTOCs is sensitive to novel transport parameters, not visible in regular time-ordered correlators. We test our predictions in Hamiltonian and Floquet spin chains in one dimension.

Title: Magnetic field-induced momentum-dependent symmetry breaking in a kagome superconductor
Authors: Jianwei Huang, Zheng Ren, Hengxin Tan, Jounghoon Hyun, Yichen Zhang, Thomas Hulse, Zhaoyu Liu, Jonathan M. DeStefano, Yaofeng Xie, Ziqin Yue, Junichiro Kono, Pengcheng Dai, Yu He, Aki Pulkkinen, Ján Minár, Jiun-Haw Chu, Ziqiang Wang, Binghai Yan, Rafael M. Fernandes, Ming Yi
Abstract: When multiple degrees of freedom share similar energy scales in quantum materials, intertwined electronic orders, which exhibit broken symmetries, are often strongly coupled. Recent studies on kagome superconductors such as CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ report rotational and time-reversal symmetry breaking linked to a charge density wave. Here, we observe a momentum-selective response of the electronic structure of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ to an external magnetic field. By performing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy in a tuneable magnetic field, we demonstrate that the response of the electronic structure is compatible with piezomagnetism along with strong orbital selectivity. Our results show that the origin of the time-reversal symmetry breaking is associated with the vanadium Van Hove singularities at the onset of the charge density wave order. We also demonstrate the presence of fluctuations beyond the charge ordering temperature. Our results reveal that magnetic fields can be used as tuning knobs for disentangling intertwined orders in the momentum space for quantum materials.

Title: Reaction-Diffusion Driven Patterns in Immiscible Alloy Thin Films
Authors: Vivek C. Peddiraju, Shourya Dutta-Gupta, Subhradeep Chatterjee
Abstract: Controlling the microstructure of thin films is of critical importance for various applications. We demonstrate a methodology for tuning the local microstructure through film-substrate interactions using Ag-Cu as a model system. Metastable single-phase Ag-Cu thin films are deposited on Si substrates pre-patterned by FIB milling. During post-deposition annealing, localized film-substrate reaction around the milled patterns produces a distinct microstructure termed as the 'halo'. It consists of copper silicide and almost pure Ag, while the far-field film forms a random mixture of Cu and Ag-rich domains through phase separation. We show that the extent of the halo can be controlled by varying the temperature and duration of annealing. We present a semi-analytical kinetic model of product and halo growth that incorporates species balance, diffusional transport and a modified Stefan condition. Predictions from the model reveal two distinct growth regimes of the product with power law indices of 1/2 and 2/7 and experimental data fall into the latter regime. These regimes originate from the dimensionality of growth (2d or 3d) compared to that of solute transport (2d), which in turn depend on film thickness and species diffusivity. Using an inverse optimization procedure, we also estimate the diffusivity, which suggests grain boundary diffusion to be the dominant transport mechanism. This study provides an avenue and framework for microstructural engineering of alloy thin films through interfacial reaction.

Title: Microscopic origin of orbital magnetization in chiral superconductors
Authors: Jihang Zhu, Chunli Huang
Abstract: Chiral superconductivity is a time-reversal-symmetry-breaking superconducting phase that has attracted broad interest as a potential platform for topological quantum computation. A fundamental consequence of this symmetry breaking is orbital magnetization, yet a clear microscopic formulation of this quantity has remained elusive. This difficulty arises because Bogoliubov quasiparticles do not carry a definite electric charge, precluding a simple interpretation of orbital magnetization in terms of circulating quasiparticle currents. Moreover, superconductivity and ferromagnetism rarely coexist, and in the few materials where they do (e.g. uranium-based compounds), strong spin-orbit coupling obscures the orbital contribution to the magnetization. The recent report of chiral superconductivity in rhombohedral multilayer graphene, which has negligible spin-orbit coupling, therefore provides a unique opportunity to develop and test a microscopic theory of orbital magnetization in chiral superconductors. Here we develop such a theory, unifying the interband coherence effects underlying normal-state orbital magnetization with the intrinsic orbital moments of the Cooper-pair condensate. Applying our theory to rhombohedral tetralayer graphene, we find that the onset of superconductivity can either enhance or suppress the normal-state orbital magnetization, depending on the bandstructure. We further identify a generalized clapping mode with a gap set by the sublattice winding form factor. This collective mode is unique to chiral superconductors and contributes to the orbital magnetization through its role in dressing the photon vertex. Our theory resolves a long-standing conceptual difficulty in defining orbital magnetization in superconducting systems, and measurements of the orbital magnetization relative to the quarter-metal phase would provide a direct experimental test.

Title: Crystal Representation in the Reciprocal Space
Authors: Osman Goni Ridwan, Hongfei Xue, Youxing Chen, Harish Cherukuri, Qiang Zhu
Abstract: In crystallography, a structure is typically represented by the arrangement of atoms in the direct space. Furthermore, space group symmetry and Wyckoff site notations are applied to characterize crystal structures with only a few variables. While this representation is effective for data records and human learning, it lacks one-to-one correspondence between the crystal structure and its representation. This is problematic for many applications, such as crystal structure determination, comparison, and more recently, generative model learning. To address this issue, we propose to represent crystals in a four-dimensional (4D) reciprocal space featured by their Cartesian coordinates and scattering factors, which can naturally handle translation invariance and space group symmetry with the help of structure factors. In order to achieve rotational invariance, the 4D coordinates are then transformed into a power spectrum representation under the orthogonal spherical harmonic and radial basis. Hence, this representation captures both periodicity and symmetry of the crystal structure while also providing a continuous representation of the atomic positions and cell parameters in the direct space. Its effectiveness is demonstrated by applying it to several crystal structure matching and reconstruction tasks.

Title: Electrostatic Screening Modulation of Graphene's Electronic Structure and the Helical Wavefunction Dominated Topological Properties
Authors: Yaorui Tan, Xiang Chen, Yunhu Zhu, Xiaowu Yang, Zhongkai Huang, Chuang Yao, Maolin Bo
Abstract: This study examines electrostatic screening effects in graphene using tight binding calculations based on the Binding energy and Bond Charge model and a modified version of it. The results indicate that the modified BBC potential decays in an exponential manner with distance, which suppresses electron electron interactions. The hopping integrals exhibit a pronounced decrease over distance and shift with parameter variation. A band gap opens once the parameter exceeds a certain threshold. The density of states shows a prominent peak near the Fermi level, whereas the low-energy region remains largely unchanged. The low energy helical wave functions in graphene display topological characteristics, including pseudospin momentum locking and a {\pi} Berry phase, resulting in distinctive transport properties. By avoiding the Coulomb singularity, the model offers valuable insights for the engineering of screening in two-dimensional systems and the design of topological devices.

Title: Single-Emitter Spectra from an Ensemble
Authors: Jonah R. Horowitz, Oliver J. Tye, Oliver M. Nix, Shaun Tan, Hogeun Chang, Ji Hyun Min, Taehyung Kim, Moungi G. Bawendi
Abstract: The heterogeneity in nanoscale emitters hinders efforts to understand their basic photophysics and limits their use in practical applications. Existing methods have difficulty accurately characterizing single-emitter spectra and optical heterogeneity on a statistical scale. Here, we introduce SPICEE (SPectrally Imbalanced Correlations from Ensemble Emission), a spectrally filtered photon-correlation technique that recovers single-particle emission lineshapes from an ensemble sample. Analytical derivations, numerical modeling, and experiments on a solution ensemble of emitters validate the technique. We apply SPICEE to blue-emitting ZnSeTe semiconductor nanocrystals relevant to display applications and find that the low color purity in the ensemble spectrum is primarily caused by a small subpopulation of nanocrystals with a distinct emission mechanism. This work demonstrates that SPICEE is a powerful high-throughput tool for accurately characterizing the single-emitter properties of nanoscale systems.

Title: Stochastic Thermodynamics of Quantum-Induced Stochastic Dynamics
Authors: Pedro V. Paraguassú
Abstract: Quantum-Induced Stochastic Dynamics arises from the coupling between a classical system and a quantum environment. Unlike standard thermal reservoirs, this environment acts as a dynamic bath, capable of simultaneously exchanging heat and performing work. We formulate a thermodynamic framework for this semi-classical regime, defining heat, work, and entropy production. We derive a modified Second Law that accounts for non-equilibrium quantum features, such as squeezing. The framework is exemplified by an optomechanical setup, where we characterize the thermodynamics of the non-stationary noise induced by the cavity field.

Title: Continuum model for the terahertz dielectric response of glasses
Authors: Tatsuya Mori, Hideyuki Mizuno, Yuzuki Motokawa, Dan Kyotani, Soo Han Oh, Yasuhiro Fujii, Akitoshi Koreeda, Shinji Kohara, Seiji Kojima
Abstract: Boson peak dynamics in glasses produce a robust crossover in the terahertz (THz) dielectric response that standard Debye or Lorentz models do not capture. We develop a continuum description of this THz response, coupling an infrared-effective charge fluctuation spectrum to a frequency-dependent shear modulus, and apply it to glycerol glass. The model reproduces the measured complex dielectric function and the nearly linear infrared light-vibration coupling around the boson peak, and highlights the dominant role of transverse shear dynamics.

Title: Turning non-superconducting elements into superconductors by quantum confinement and proximity
Authors: Giovanni A. Ummarino, Alessio Zaccone
Abstract: Elemental good metals, including noble metals (Cu, Ag, Au) and several $s$-block elements, do not exhibit superconductivity in bulk at ambient pressure, primarily due to weak electron--phonon coupling that fails to overcome Coulomb repulsion. In this perspective, we examine whether quantum confinement alone, or in combination with proximity effects, can induce an observable superconducting instability in metals that are non-superconducting in bulk form. We review recent theoretical progress and present a unified framework based on a confinement-generalized, isotropic one-band Eliashberg theory, in which the normal density of states becomes energy dependent and key material parameters ($E_F$, $\lambda$, and $\mu^{*}$) acquire an explicit thickness dependence. By numerically solving the resulting Eliashberg equations using ab-initio or experimentally determined electron--phonon spectral functions $\alpha^{2}F(\Omega)$ and Coulomb pseudopotentials $\mu^{*}$, and without introducing adjustable parameters, we compute the critical temperature $T_c$ as a function of film thickness for representative noble, alkali, and alkaline-earth metals. The theory predicts that superconductivity can emerge only in selected cases and within extremely narrow thickness windows, typically centered around sub-nanometer scales ($L \sim 0.4$--$0.6$ nm). We further discuss layered superconductor/normal-metal systems, where quantum confinement and proximity effects coexist. In these heterostructures, a substantial enhancement of the critical temperature is predicted, even when the constituent materials are non-superconducting or poor superconductors in bulk form.

Title: Coherence Protection for Mobile Spin Qubits in Silicon
Authors: Jan A. Krzywda, Yuta Matsumoto, Maxim De Smet, Larysa Tryputen, Sander L. de Snoo, Sergey V. Amitonov, Evert van Nieuwenburg, Giordano Scappucci, Lieven M.K. Vandersypen
Abstract: Mobile spin qubit architectures promise flexible connectivity for efficient quantum error correction and relaxed device layout constraints, but their viability rests on preserving spin coherence during transport. While shuttling transforms spatial disorder into time-dependent noise, its net impact on spin coherence remains an open question. Here we demonstrate systematic noise mitigation during spin shuttling in a linear $^{28}$Si/SiGe quantum dot device. First, by passively reducing magnetic field gradients, we minimize charge-noise coupling to the spin and double the spatially averaged dephasing time $T_2^*(x_n)$ from $4.4$ to $8.5\,\mu\text{s}$. Next, we exploit motional narrowing by periodically shuttling the qubit, achieving a further enhancement in coherence time up to $T_{2}^{*,sh} = 11.5\,\mu\text{s}$. Finally, we incorporate dynamical decoupling techniques while periodically shuttling over distances exceeding $200\,\text{nm}$, reaching $T_\text{2}^{H,sh}= 32\,\mu\text{s}$. For the same setup, we demonstrate that dressed-state shuttling provides robust protection against low-frequency noise with a decay time $T_R^{\text{sh}} = 21\,\mu\text{s}$, without the overhead of pulsed control and allowing protection during one-way spin transport. By preserving coherence over timescales exceeding typical gate and readout operations, the demonstrated strategies establish mobile spin qubits as a viable solution for scalable silicon quantum processors.

Title: Topologically Protected Surface Altermagnetism on Antiferromagnets
Authors: Valentin Leeb, Peru d'Ornellas, Fernando de Juan, Adolfo G. Grushin
Abstract: Altermagnetism (AM) and its associated spin-transport phenomena are typically linked to spin-split electronic band structures in bulk materials. However, the crystal surface has a reduced symmetry with respect to the bulk, which can induce AM at the surface of conventional antiferromagnets (AFMs) $\unicode{x2013}$ a local effect which cannot be detected using bulk properties. In this work we define the symmetry conditions necessary for surface AM and show how it can be topologically protected, rendering it a robust effect. We provide a minimal model for one trivial and two topological examples of surface AM. We show that the spin spectral density, accessible by spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, can exhibit a $d$-wave-like altermagnetic character at the surface, even when the full band structure is completely spin degenerate. Our topological model describes the Dirac semimetal CuMnAs, which provides an existing realization of our theory. Our results identify crystal surfaces as a platform to realize robust, topology- and symmetry-driven unconventional magnetism beyond the bulk classification of magnetic materials.

Title: Quantitative low-temperature spectral asymptotics for reversible diffusions in temperature-dependent domains
Authors: Noé Blassel, Tony Lelièvre, Gabriel Stoltz
Abstract: We derive novel low-temperature asymptotics for the spectrum of the infinitesimal generator of the overdamped Langevin dynamics. The novelty is that this operator is endowed with homogeneous Dirichlet conditions at the boundary of a domain which depends on the temperature. From the point of view of stochastic processes, this gives information on the long-time behavior of the diffusion conditioned on non-absorption at the boundary, in the so-called quasistationary regime. Our results provide precise estimates of the spectral gap and principal eigenvalue, extending the Eyring-Kramers formula. The phenomenology is richer than in the case of a fixed boundary and gives new insight into the sensitivity of the spectrum with respect to the shape of the domain near critical points of the energy function. Our work is motivated by--and is relevant to--the problem of finding optimal hyperparameters for accelerated molecular dynamics algorithms.

Title: Lindblad many-body scars
Authors: Antonio M. García-García, Zhongling Lu, Lucas Sá, Jacobus J. M. Verbaarschot
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars have received much recent attention for being both intriguing non-ergodic states in otherwise quantum chaotic systems and promising candidates to encode quantum information efficiently. So far, these studies have mostly been restricted to Hermitian systems. Here, we study many-body scars in many-body quantum chaotic systems coupled to a Markovian bath, which we term Lindblad many-body scars. They are defined as simultaneous eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian and dissipative parts of the vectorized Liouvillian. Importantly, because their eigenvalues are purely real, they are not related to revivals. The number and nature of the scars depend on both the symmetry of the Hamiltonian and the choice of jump operators. For a dissipative four-body Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model with $N$ fermions, either Majorana or complex, we construct analytically some of these Lindblad scars while others could only be obtained numerically. As an example of the former, we identify $N/2+1$ scars for complex fermions due to the $U(1)$ symmetry of the model and two scars for Majorana fermions as a consequence of the parity symmetry. Similar results are obtained for a dissipative XXZ spin chain. We also characterize the physical properties of Lindblad scars. First, the operator size is independent of the disorder realization and has a vanishing variance. By contrast, the operator size for non-scarred states, believed to be quantum chaotic, is well described by a distribution centered around a specific size and a finite variance, which could be relevant for a precise definition of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis in dissipative quantum chaos. Moreover, the entanglement entropy of these scars has distinct features such as a strong dependence on the partition choice and, in certain cases, a large entanglement.

Title: Measuring Rényi entropy using a projected Loschmidt echo
Authors: Yi-Neng Zhou, Robin Löwenberg, Julian Sonner
Abstract: We present efficient and practical protocols to measure the second Rényi entropy (RE), whose exponential is known as the purity. We achieve this by establishing a direct connection to a Loschmidt echo (LE) type measurement sequence, applicable to quantum many-body systems. Notably, our approach does not rely on random-noise averaging, a feature that can be extended to protocols to measure out-of-time-order correlation functions (OTOCs), as we demonstrate. By way of example, we show that our protocols can be practically implemented in superconducting qubit-based platforms, as well as in cavity-QED trapped ultra-cold gases.

Title: Linear Analysis of Stochastic Verlet-Type Integrators for Langevin Equations
Authors: Niels Grønbech-Jensen
Abstract: We provide an analytical framework for analyzing the quality of stochastic Verlet-type integrators for simulating the Langevin equation. Focusing only on basic objective measures, we consider the ability of an integrator to correctly simulate two characteristic configurational quantities of transport, a) diffusion on a flat surface and b) drift on a tilted planar surface, as well as c) statistical sampling of a harmonic potential. For any stochastic Verlet-type integrator expressed in its configurational form, we develop closed form expressions to directly assess these three most basic quantities as a function of the applied time step. The applicability of the analysis is exemplified through twelve representative integrators developed over the past five decades, and algorithm performance is conveniently visualized through the three characteristic measures for each integrator. The GJ set of integrators stands out as the only option for correctly simulating diffusion, drift, and Boltzmann distribution in linear systems, and we therefore suggest that this general method is the one best suited for high quality thermodynamic simulations of nonlinear and complex systems, including for relatively high time steps compared to simulations with other integrators.

Title: Emergent Quantum Walk Dynamics from Classical Interacting Particles
Authors: Surajit Saha
Abstract: The dynamics of a discrete-time quantum walk (DTQW) can be realized within a purely classical interacting particle system composed of some boxes and a large but finite number of balls, and can, in principle, be implemented in a tabletop experimental setting. The distribution of the balls evolves under stochastic, occupation-dependent update rules at each lattice site, producing quantum-walk dynamics without invoking a wavefunction. The update parameters are fixed by the parameters of coin and shift operations of the DTQW. This framework naturally yields a generalized active spin model and provides a minimal lattice-based microscopic understanding of the emergence of quantum-like dynamics in active matter systems. This interdisciplinary approach connects the Classical models to the broad range of applications where DTQWs are successfully employed.

Title: Quantum Chaos Diagnostics for non-Hermitian Systems from Bi-Lanczos Krylov Dynamics
Authors: Matteo Baggioli, Kyoung-Bum Huh, Hyun-Sik Jeong, Xuhao Jiang, Keun-Young Kim, Juan F. Pedraza
Abstract: In Hermitian systems, Krylov complexity has emerged as a powerful diagnostic of quantum dynamics, capable of distinguishing chaotic from integrable phases, in agreement with established probes such as spectral statistics and out-of-time-order correlators. By contrast, its role in non-Hermitian settings, relevant for modeling open quantum systems, remains less understood due to the challenges posed by complex eigenvalues and the limitations of standard approaches based on orthogonality, such as singular value decomposition. Here we demonstrate that Krylov complexity, computed via the bi-Lanczos algorithm, provides a reliable probe of quantum chaos in non-Hermitian systems, clearly discriminating chaotic and integrable regimes. Our results agree with complex spectral statistics and complex spacing ratios, underscoring the robustness of the method. Universality is supported by extensive tests in both the non-Hermitian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and non-Hermitian random-matrix ensembles across multiple non-Hermitian symmetry classes.

Title: Clifford quantum cellular automata from topological quantum field theories and invertible subalgebras
Authors: Meng Sun, Bowen Yang, Zongyuan Wang, Nathanan Tantivasadakarn, Yu-An Chen
Abstract: We present a general framework for constructing quantum cellular automata (QCA) from topological quantum field theories (TQFT) and invertible subalgebras (ISA) using the cup-product formalism. This approach explicitly realizes all $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\mathbb{Z}_p$ Clifford QCAs (for prime $p$) in all admissible dimensions, in precise agreement with the classification predicted by algebraic $L$-theory. We determine the orders of these QCAs by explicitly showing that finite powers reduce to the identity up to finite-depth quantum circuits (FDQC) and lattice translations. In particular, we demonstrate that the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Clifford QCAs in $(4l{+}1)$ spatial dimensions can be disentangled by non-Clifford FDQCs. Our construction applies beyond cubic lattices, allowing $\mathbb{Z}_2$ QCAs to be defined on arbitrary cellulations. Furthermore, we explicitly construct invertible subalgebras in higher dimensions, obtaining $\mathbb{Z}_2$ ISAs in $2l$ spatial dimensions and $\mathbb{Z}_p$ ISAs in $(4l{-}2)$ spatial dimensions. These ISAs give rise to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ QCAs in $(2l{+}1)$ dimensions and $\mathbb{Z}_p$ QCAs in $(4l{-}1)$ dimensions. We further prove that the QCAs in $3$ spatial dimensions constructed via TQFTs and ISAs are equivalent by identifying their boundary algebras, and show that this approach extends to higher dimensions. Together, these results establish a unified and dimension-periodic framework for Clifford QCAs, connecting their explicit lattice realizations to field theories.

Title: Repulsively Bound Hadrons in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Lattice Gauge Theory
Authors: Sayak Guha Roy, Vaibhav Sharma, Kaidi Xu, Umberto Borla, Jad C. Halimeh, Kaden R. A. Hazzard
Abstract: The $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory is a paradigmatic model that exhibits gauge-field-mediated-confinement of pairs of particles into mesons, drawing connections to quantum chromodynamics. In the absence of any additional attractive interactions between particles, mesons are not known to bind in this model. Here, we show that resonant pair-production terms give rise to two separate mechanisms to form stable ``hadron'' bound states of two mesons: either induced by an effective attractive interaction, or a new dynamical binding mechanism induced by an effective repulsion. The repulsively bound hadron is a high-energy state stabilized by being energetically separated from the two-meson continuum through quantum fluctuations of the gauge fields. We study the dynamical formation of this bound state starting from local excitations. We use matrix product state techniques based on the time-evolving block decimation algorithm to perform our numerical simulations and analyze the effect of model parameters on hadron formation. Furthermore, we derive an effective model that explains its formation. Our findings are amenable to experimental observation on modern quantum hardware such as superconducting qubits, trapped ions, and Rydberg atom arrays.

Title: Discovery of Hyperelastic Constitutive Laws from Experimental Data with EUCLID
Authors: Arefeh Abbasi, Maurizio Ricci, Pietro Carrara, Moritz Flaschel, Siddhant Kumar, Sonia Marfia, Laura De Lorenzis
Abstract: We assess the performance of EUCLID, Efficient Unsupervised Constitutive Law Identification and Discovery, a recently proposed framework for automated discovery of constitutive laws, on experimental data. Mechanical tests are performed on natural rubber specimens spanning simple to complex geometries, from which we collect both global, force elongation, and local, full-field displacement, measurements. Using these data, we obtain constitutive laws via two routes, the conventional identification of unknown parameters in a priori selected material models, and EUCLID, which automates model selection and parameter identification within a unified model-discovery pipeline. We compare the two methodologies using global versus local data, analyze predictive accuracy, and examine generalization to unseen geometries. Moreover, we quantify the experimental noise, investigate the coverage of the material state space achieved by each approach and discuss the relative performance of different datasets and different a priori chosen models versus EUCLID.

Title: Scaling behavior of dissipative systems with imaginary gap closing
Authors: Jinghui Pi, Xingli Li, Yangqian Yan
Abstract: Point-gap topology, characterized by spectral winding numbers, is crucial to non-Hermitian topological phases and dramatically alters real-time dynamics. In this paper, we study the evolution of quantum particles in dissipative systems with imaginary gap closing, using the saddle-point approximation method. For trivial point-gap systems, imaginary gap-closing points can also be saddle points. This leads to a single power-law decay of the local Green's function, with the asymptotic scaling behavior determined by the order of these saddle points. In contrast, for nontrivial point-gap systems, imaginary gap-closing points do not coincide with saddle points in general. This results in a dynamical behavior characterized by two different scaling laws for distinct time regimes. In the short-time regime, the local Green's function is governed by the dominant saddle points and exhibits an asymptotic exponential decay. In the long-time regime, however, the dynamics is controlled by imaginary gap-closing points, leading to a power-law decay envelope. Our findings advance the understanding of quantum dynamics in dissipative systems and provide predictions testable in future experiments.

Title: Two variants of the friendship paradox: The condition for inequality between them
Authors: Sang Hoon Lee
Abstract: The friendship paradox -- the observation that, on average, one's friends have more friends than oneself -- admits two common formulations depending on whether averaging is performed over edges or over nodes. These two definitions, the "alter-based" and "ego-based" means, are often treated as distinct but related quantities. This paper establishes their exact analytical relationship, showing that the difference between them is governed by the degree-degree covariance normalized by the mean degree. Explicit examples demonstrate the three possible cases of positive, zero, and negative covariance, corresponding respectively to assortative, neutral, and disassortative mixing patterns. The derivation further connects the covariance form to the moment-based expression introduced by Kumar, Krackhardt, and Feld [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 121, e2306412121 (2024)], which involves the (-1)st, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd moments of the degree distribution. The two formulations are shown to be equivalent, as they should be: the moment-based representation expands the same structural dependence that the covariance form expresses in its most compact and interpretable form. The analysis thus unifies node-level and moment-level perspectives on the friendship paradox, offering both a pedagogically transparent derivation and a direct bridge to recent theoretical developments.

Title: Soap Film Drainage Using a Centrifugal Thin Film Balance
Authors: Antoine Monier, Kévin Gutierrez, Cyrille Claudet, Franck Celestini, Christophe Brouzet, Christophe Raufaste
Abstract: Surface bubbles are an abundant source of aerosols, with important implications for climate processes. In this context, we investigate the stability and thinning dynamics of soap films under effective gravity fields. Experiments are performed using a centrifugal thin-film balance capable of generating accelerations from 0.2 up to 100 times standard gravity, combined with thin-film interferometry to obtain time-resolved thickness maps. Across all experimental conditions, the drainage dynamics are shown to be governed by capillary suction and marginal regeneration-a mechanism in which thick regions of the film are continuously replaced by thin film elements (TFEs) formed at the meniscus. We consistently recover a thickness ratio of 0.8-0.9 between the TFEs and the adjacent film, in agreement with previous observations under standard gravity. The measured thinning rates also follow the predicted scaling laws. We identified that effective gravity has three distinct effects: (i) it induces a strong stretching of the initial film, extending well beyond the linear-elastic regime; (ii) it controls the meniscus size, and thereby the amplitude of the capillary suction and the drainage rate; and (iii) it reveals an inertia-to-viscous transition in the motion of TFEs within the film. These results are supported by theoretical modeling and highlight the robustness of marginal regeneration and capillary-driven drainage under extreme gravity conditions.

Title: Universal TT- and TQ-relations via centrally extended q-Onsager algebra
Authors: Pascal Baseilhac, Azat M. Gainutdinov, Guillaume Lemarthe
Abstract: Let $A_q$ be the alternating central extension of the q-Onsager algebra, a comodule algebra over the quantum loop algebra of $sl_2$. We classify one-dimensional representations of $A_q$, and show that spin-j K-operators constructed in arXiv:2301.00781 act as K-matrices previously obtained in the literature. Using these K-operators and K-matrices, we construct universal spin-j transfer matrices generating commutative subalgebras in $A_q$. Within a technical conjecture, we derive their fusion hierarchy, the so-called universal TT-relations. On spin-chain representations of $A_q$, we show how the universal transfer matrices evaluate to spin-chain transfer matrices, and as a result we get explicit TT-relations for all values of spins for auxiliary and quantum spaces, any inhomogeneities, and general integrable boundary conditions. In particular, we derive previously conjectured TT-relations. Using the TT-relations, we show that n-th local conserved quantities of the spin-j chains of length N are polynomials of total degree 4Njn in two non-local operators of the q-Onsager algebra. As a result, we give an algorithm of explicit calculation of all local conserved quantities in terms of spin operators. Furthermore, using the universal TT-relations we derive exchange relations between spin-j Hamiltonians and the two non-local operators showing non-trivial symmetries for special boundary conditions, that they commute with all Hamiltonian densities. As another application of our universal TT-relations we propose universal T-system, Y-system and universal TQ-relations for $A_q$, and as a result, universal TQ for the q-Onsager algebra. For diagonal boundary conditions, we also obtain universal TT- and TQ-relations for a degenerate version of $A_q$ known as centrally extended augmented q-Onsager algebra. We finally discuss implications of our results for generalized Gibbs ensemble construction.

Title: Hydrodynamic flows induced by localized torques (rotlets) in wedge-shaped geometries
Authors: Abdallah Daddi-Moussa-Ider, Jakob Mihatsch, Michael J. Mitchell, Elsen Tjhung, Andreas M. Menzel
Abstract: Wedge-shaped geometries in low-Reynolds-number flows are of increasing importance, for instance, in the design of microfluidic devices. The corresponding Green's functions describing the induced flow in response to a locally applied force were derived some time ago. To achieve a complete characterization of particle motion at low Reynolds numbers, we derive the flow response to locally applied torques. This is accomplished through a direct calculation based on the Fourier-Kontorovich-Lebedev transform using the Papkovich-Neuber representation of the hydrodynamic fields. We then illustrate the resulting flow fields, highlighting their structure, key features, and dependence on the geometry and orientation of the applied torque. Based on these solutions, we compute the corresponding hydrodynamic mobility tensor that couples torque and motion. Owing to the broken spatial symmetry imposed by the wedge-shaped confinement, a particle subjected to a torque will experience not only rotational motion but also translational motion. These results provide analytical tools relevant for predicting and controlling particle behavior in confined microfluidic environments.

Title: Large earthquakes follow highly unequal ones
Authors: Sudip Sarkar, Soumyajyoti Biswas
Abstract: It was conjectured for a long time that the tectonic plates are in a self-organized state of criticality and that the Gutenberg-Richter law is a manifestation of that. It was recently shown that for a system near criticality, the inequality of their responses due to external driving would sharply rise and show universal behavior that could indicate proximity of the system to a critical point. As a result, measures such as the Gini and Kolkata indices that quantify inequality, can also serve as indicators of imminent criticallity and that of diverging (system spanning) responses. In the context of earthquakes, such a large response would correspond to events of high magnitudes. In this work, we show with numerical simulations and seismic data analysis that large earthquake events have a tendency to follow events that are highly unequal, similar to the case of a system near a critical point. Therefore, a continuous monitoring of the inequality indices of the earthquake time series could be useful for hazard estimates. We have applied this framework to models of earthquakes as well as to the earthquake time series from various tectonically active regions, such as North America, Southern Japan, parts of South-East Asia and Indonesia. The findings also indicate a quantitative estimate of the distance from criticality, when the tectonic plates are viewed as a self-organized critical system.

Abstract: this http URL addresses a need to gain scientific insights from 1D scientific spectra in model independent ways. A powerful approach for this is to take differences between pairs of spectra and look for meaningful changes that might indicate underlying chemical, structural, or other modifications. The challenge is that the difference curve may contain uninteresting differences such as experimental inconsistencies and benign physical changes such as the effects of thermal expansion. this http URL allows researchers to apply simple transformations, or "morphs", to one of the datasets to remove the unwanted differences revealing, when they are present, non-trivial differences. this http URL is an open-source Python package available on the Python Package Index and conda-forge. Here, we describe its functionality and apply it to solve a range of experimental challenges on diffraction and PDF data from x-rays and neutrons, though we note that it may be applied to any 1D function in principle.

Title: Structural Theory of Information Backflow in Non-Markovian Relaxation: TC/TCL Formalism and Minimal Phase Diagrams
Authors: Koichi Nakagawa
Abstract: We develop a structural theory of information backflow in minimal non-Markovian relaxation processes within the framework of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. The approach is based on the time-convolution (TC) and time-convolutionless (TCL) projection-operator formalisms for reduced dynamics and on the doubling construction of non-equilibrium thermo field dynamics, which provides an embedding representation of dissipative evolution. We introduce a general backflow functional associated with a time-dependent information measure and derive generator-based sufficient conditions for the absence of backflow in terms of divisibility properties and effective relaxation rates. This allows a direct connection between memory kernels in generalized master equations and observable transient phenomena such as entropy overshoot and revival. Furthermore, we propose a decomposition of backflow into classical mixing and intrinsic contributions in the doubled representation, leading to a unified classification of transient regimes. Minimal classical and quantum two-state models are analyzed as analytically tractable examples, yielding explicit phase diagrams and recovering Mittag-Leffler-type fractional relaxation as a universal envelope of non-Markovian damping. The framework provides a constructive TC-to-TCL procedure for extracting effective rates and organizing memory-induced phenomena in a model-independent manner.

Title: Quantum Correlation Dynamics Subjected to Quantum Reset-Driven Environment
Authors: R. Jafari, Ali Asadian, Mehdi Biderang, Alireza Akbari
Abstract: We study two central qubits interacting with a transverse-field Ising chain that serves as their environment. The environment is driven linearly in time across its quantum critical points (QCPs) and, during the evolution, is subjected to quantum reset (QR), where it is returned at random times to its initial state. We investigate how such QR of the environmental spin chain modifies the dynamics of entanglement and quantum discord between the qubits. Our results show that in the strong-coupling regime, entanglement and discord exhibit pronounced revivals within the interval bounded by the Ising QCPs, but these revivals diminish as the QR rate increases. In contrast, weak coupling leads to a monotonic reduction of quantum correlations. Numerically, we find that the revival peaks of concurrence decay and scale exponentially with the QR rate, while quantum discord shows no clear scaling behavior. In the weak-coupling regime without QR, the correlations decay monotonically as the driven field crosses the second QCP. When QR is applied, however, both entanglement and discord undergo oscillatory suppression, with the oscillation period increasing as either the QR rate or the ramp time scale is reduced.
