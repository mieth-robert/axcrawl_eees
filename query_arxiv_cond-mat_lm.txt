Title: AI/ML-Driven Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) and Spectroscopy: Materials Interfaces and Autonomous Experiments
Authors: Rigoberto Advincula, Jihua Chen
Abstract: This review explores the evolution of Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) spectroscopy and sensing, transitioning from fundamental studies of adsorption-desorption kinetics to the sophisticated sensing with Electropolymerized Molecularly Imprinted Polymers (E-MIPs). A significant portion of our previous research focuses on the optical properties, electrochromism of polymer dielectrics, and structure-order correlation in polymer brushes and hierarchical ultrathin films. We then address the transformative impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in data interpretation, culminating in the conceptualization of Self-Driving Labs (SDLs). The importance of generating high-quality training data through high-throughput experimentation (THE) with the SPR is a possibility. These autonomous systems represent the future of materials science, enabling the rapid, closed-loop discovery and optimization of next-generation SPR sensors and analytical methods. This overview highlights the trajectory for integrating conventional experimental design with AI-driven sensing and analytical chemistry across materials and biomedical applications.

Title: Buried Stressor Engineering for Position-Controlled InGaAs Quantum Dots with Local Density Variation for Integrated Quantum Photonics
Authors: Martin Podhorský, Maximilian Klonz, Lux Böhmer, Sebastian Kulig, Chirag C. Palekar, Petr Klenovský, Sven Rodt, Stephan Reitzenstein
Abstract: We report on the monolithic, two-step epitaxial growth of site-controlled InGaAs quantum dots via the buried stressor method with local quantum dot density variation. As a result of high fabrication accuracy, we achieve low lateral displacements of the individual buried stressor apertures of $ 17^{+19}_{-17}$~nm from mesa centers. We provide extensive micro-photoluminescence and cathodoluminescence characterization of the site-controlled quantum dots and give theoretical calculations, explaining the effect of the stressor aperture on the quantum dot emission properties, positioning, and density. We show reproducibility of the nucleation process for apertures of the same size and achieve precisely-positioned, low- and high-density quantum dot nucleation within one active layer growth step. The results presented in this work demonstrate the significant potential of the buried stressor concept in fabricating single photonic chips, simultaneously combining single-photon sources and microlasers featuring different local densities of site-controlled quantum dots, paving the way for highly functional source modules with applications in photonic quantum technology.

Title: Analytic continuation of Green's functions with a neural network
Authors: Fakher Assaad, Johanna Erdmenger, Anika Götz, René Meyer, Martin Rackl, Yanick Thurn
Abstract: An important problem in many-body physics is to reconstruct the spectral density from the imaginary-time domain Green's function. Typically, the imaginary-time Green's function is generated by Monte Carlo methods. As the one-point fermionic kernel diverges exponentially for large frequencies, numerical noise generically causes instabilities. We use a convolutional neural network to obtain the spectral density for a given imaginary time Green's function. The network is trained by data which we generate using random Gaussians. We improve the training data set available by including collision centers for the Gaussians rather than employing uniformly distributed Gaussians. Our network is constructed in such a way that its output fulfills positive semidefiniteness. We compare the results of our network with results of the Maximum Entropy method (MaxEnt), a standard method for the same reconstruction problem for the spectral density. This comparison is performed for three different cases, namely our Gaussian based test data as well as two physical models, the 1d Hubbard model showing spin-charge separation, and the two-dimensional SSH model in the self-consistent Born approximation. We find that the network outperforms MaxEnt when presented data close to the training set. For the physical models considered, MaxEnt recognizes physical features more precisely as compared to our network prediction. While it is hard to improve MaxEnt, the quality of the network depends on the training data set which can be systematically enhanced and improved.

Title: Tuning of Atomic Layer Deposition Pulse Time through Physics-Informed Bayesian Active Learning
Authors: Pouyan Navabi, Christos G. Takoudis
Abstract: Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) process development is often hindered by time-consuming and precursor-intensive tuning cycles required to identify saturation conditions. We introduce a physics-informed Bayesian Active Learning (BAL) framework that autonomously tunes precursor pulse times by integrating a Langmuir adsorption model directly into the Gaussian Process (GP) kernel. A key innovation is a two-stage parameter estimation strategy that decouples noise filtering from physical parameter extraction: the GP first smooths noisy data through standard prediction, then Langmuir parameters are fitted to the noise-filtered GP predictions. This approach effectively separates signal from experimental noise. We evaluate the framework against a standard data-driven GP across four simulated regimes, demonstrating convergence within five iterations, up to fourfold improvement in prediction accuracy, and two to fourfold reduction in precursor usage. Experimental validation using TiO2 deposition via Tetrakisdimethylamido Titanium (TDMAT) and ozone confirms that the physics-informed model accurately identifies saturation times for high-coverage targets ($\geq$95\%), with observed deviations at lower saturation levels providing valuable insight into non-ideal desorption behaviors.

Title: Transport in close-packed solids with stacking defects
Authors: C. M. Wilson, R. Ganesh, K. V. Samokhin
Abstract: Lithium and sodium are the only solids that are known to lose crystalline order upon cooling. The seemingly-disordered low-temperature phase shows signatures of various close-packed structures. The lack of order has been attributed to a hidden gauge symmetry that arises when electrons from one layer can hop to a neighbouring layer but not further. It makes all close-packed structures nearly degenerate and leads to ``structural frustration''. In this article, we examine whether this symmetry is reflected in transport signatures. Taking advantage of in-plane translational periodicity, we map the bulk Bloch Hamiltonian to an effective one-dimensional chain, with stacking disorder mapping to random phases of the hopping amplitudes. We derive an explicit analytic form for the Green's function of electrons and use it to calculate conductance of a bulk crystal. When hopping in the effective one-dimensional chain is restricted to nearest neighbours, conductance is completely insensitive to phase disorder, which indicates that all close-packed structures exhibit the same conductance. We show that the leading correction that can differentiate between close-packed structures arises from hopping to the next-nearest-neighbour layer, equivalent to second-neighbour hopping in the chain model. This process appears when a pair of next-neighbour layers are aligned in a certain way, e.g., at an hcp-like stacking fault within an fcc background. With this hopping included, conductance becomes sensitive to the precise arrangement of layers. When multiple stacking faults are present, the conductance decreases with increasing system size, as expected from Anderson localization. Our results are applicable to pressurized lithium and sodium, where conductance measurements can identify and characterize stacking faults.

Title: When Atoms Choose Their Neighbors: Element-Specific Views of Local Chemical Order in High-Entropy Alloys
Authors: David Morris, Yonggang Yao, Peng Zhang
Abstract: Local chemical order (LCO) is a key descriptor linking composition, atomic arrangement, and function in high-entropy alloys (HEAs), yet remains difficult to quantify. This Perspective highlights how X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) provides element-specific, quantitative insight into LCO in complex alloys. We outline practical considerations for XAS data collection and fitting, including width of spectra range, multi-temperature analysis, and X-ray absorption edge choice for 5d elements. We then highlight a coordination-number-based framework for LCO analysis and use model HEAs to show how single-atom and near-single-atom motifs naturally emerge as component number increases, bridging HEAs and single-atom alloys. Finally, we identify priorities including standardized protocols, uncertainty quantification, expanded operando and time-resolved XAS, and integration with complementary characterization and modelling.

Title: Real-time vacancy concentration evolution revealed via heavy ion irradiation experiments
Authors: Elena Botica-Artalejo, Gregory Wallace, Michael P. Short
Abstract: We show that in situ ion irradiation transient grating spectroscopy (I3TGS) can be used to monitor the real-time evolution of vacancy concentration generated by self-ion radiation damage in Cu-based alloys. Surface acoustic wave (SAW) frequencies are shown, using a combination of theory and experiment, to reveal vacancy concentrations and their kinetics in real-time. These results are shown to agree with corresponding kinetic Monte Carlo simulations at similar temperatures and dose rates. These results suggest the utility of TGS as a non-contact, non-destructive tool for real-time defect monitoring.

Title: Thermodynamic and Kinetic Bounds for Finite-frequency Fluctuation-Response
Authors: Jiming Zheng, Zhiyue Lu
Abstract: Fluctuation-response relations encode fundamental constraints on nonequilibrium systems. While time-domain static response is bounded by activity and entropy production, finite-frequency extensions for time-dependent perturbations remain largely unexplored. Here, we derive frequency-domain fluctuation-response inequalities for steady-state Markov processes with time-dependent perturbations. For barrier and entropic perturbations, the spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is universally bounded by dynamical activity. Furthermore, for state-current observables, the SNR is bounded by the entropy production rate (EPR). We illustrate our results using the F1-ATPase model to infer EPR. These finite-frequency inequalities provide a practical route to infer dissipation from power spectra measurements.

Title: The Interplay Between Liquid-Liquid Phase Equilibria, Sequence, and Tg in Copolymers
Authors: Makayla R. Branham-Ferrari, David S. Simmons
Abstract: Copolymerization is a powerful tool to tune polymers' glass formation behavior in order to improve properties such as ion conductivity, thermal stability, and mechanical response. Classically, mixing rules such as the Fox equation and its variants have been employed to predict and explain glass transition temperature (Tg) variations with copolymer composition. However, a large number of copolymers exhibit significant excursions from these mixing rules. Increasingly, it also appears that these excursions can be tuned by copolymer sequence - an effect that is not predicted by classical mixing rules and thus far remains poorly understood. Here, we perform molecular dynamics simulations to probe the interplay between copolymer sequence, liquid-liquid phase equilibria, and Tg. We find that the direction of Tg shifts, and their dependence on sequence, are predicted by the type of liquid-liquid phase boundary towards which the comonomers tend. Monomers tending towards Upper Critical Solution Temperature behavior exhibit Tg reductions that become stronger with increasing monomer alternation; monomers tending towards Lower Critical Solution Temperature behavior exhibit Tg enhancements that become stronger with increasing monomer alternation. This behavior fundamentally emerges from a forced mixing phenomenon wherein monomer alternation induces close contact between monomer types that would otherwise tend towards phase separation. These results point towards strategies for rationally varying copolymer Tg, at fixed chemical composition, via judicious design of polymer chain sequence.

Title: Is altermagnetism in vanadium oxychalcogenides a lost cause?
Authors: Bishal Thapa, Po-Hao Chang, Kirill Belashchenko, Igor I. Mazin
Abstract: Vanadium-based oxychalcogenide compounds with the inverse Lieb-lattice (ILL) structural pattern have recently been proposed as candidate altermagnets (AM). However, early studies postulated ferromagnetic interlayer coupling, a critical requirement for preserving the bulk AM state. Here we present a systematic survey of the complete AV2Q2O family (A = K, Rb, Cs; Q = S, Se, Te) in terms of their magnetic ordering and interlayer coupling. While intralayer exchange interaction favors AM ordering in a single ILL layer across the entire family, the relatively weak interlayer coupling in most cases favors Kramers-degenerate antiferromagnetic order with a doubled magnetic unit cell. This means that most stoichiometric bulk materials, including the previously proposed candidate KV2Se2O, are not altermagnetic, with CsV2Te2O being the only exception. Using hole doping to simulate alkali vacancies, we show that realistic deviations from stoichiometry do not change the magnetic ground state in these compounds.

Title: A ReaxFF-based thermomechanical analysis of N-carbophenes: phase-change, thermal expansion, and high temperature synthesis pathway
Authors: Chad E. Junkermeier, Kat Lavarez, R. Martin Adra, Valeria Aparicio Diaz, Heather Osterstock, Pal Casinto, M. Verano, Ricardo Paupitz, Adri C. T. van Duin
Abstract: N-carbophenes are a class of two-dimensional covalent organic frameworks with potential for solid-state gas storage and as 2D topological materials. Previous studies have demonstrated that variations in their bonding, topology, and functionalization enable the tuning of their chemical, electrical, and mechanical properties. Yet, the thermal stability and high-temperature behavior of pristine and functionalized N-carbophenes remain unexplored. Using ReaxFF-based reactive molecular dynamics (RMD) simulations with extensive statistical validation, we performed temperature-ramp MD simulations of pristine and functionalized N-carbophenes. We demonstrate that N-carbophenes remain stable up to temperatures above 1000 K. The phase-change onset temperatures decrease as the N-phenylene chain length increases in pristine N-carbophenes, attributed to increasing antiaromaticity in the central phenylene segments, thereby contributing to the foundational understanding of aromatic versus antiaromatic bonding in 2D carbon networks, a topic of considerable interest in theoretical chemistry. Pristine N-carbophenes exhibit negative area thermal expansion (NATE), whereas functional groups modulate this, leading to either negative or positive expansion. Functional groups remain stably bonded well above the transition temperature. We also show that a temperature-induced phase transition from graphenylene (2-carbophene) to {\gamma}-graphyne is possible. Our results provide upper bounds on N-carbophene stability, clarify the relationships between structure and thermal properties, and identify a new transformation pathway. These results will have applications in tunable band gaps, porous architectures, or chemically accessible sites.

Title: Nonabelian Anyons attached to Superconducting Islands in FQH Liquids
Authors: Hisham Sati, Urs Schreiber
Abstract: The idea that topologically protected quantum states, such as anyons, may be attached to super/semiconductor heterostructures has received enormous attention, but experimental signatures in 1D systems remain elusive. Here we revisit theoretical underpinnings of anyons in 2D fractional quantum Hall (FQH) systems, whose signatures have been experimentally observed by independent groups. Invoking novel theorems about the Hopfion or $\mathbb{C}P^1$-model understood as flux quantization in 2-Cohomotopy, we demonstrate a robust prediction for possibly nonabelian anyonic states induced by superconducting islands.

Title: Phase fluctuations in a confined fluid
Authors: Frederic Caupin, Alberto Zaragoza, Miguel A. Gonzalez, Chantal Valeriani
Abstract: Fluid phase equilibrium depends on the external constraints imposed on a system. In a closed system with fixed volume, depending on the average density, a vapor bubble may be stable, metastable, or unstable, with respect to the homogeneous liquid phase. In the case where the bubble is metastable, we study its lifetime, i.e. the average waiting time needed to observe bubble collapse, and the corresponding lifetime of the homogeneous liquid. For the smallest systems, we predict the possibility to observe phase flipping, when the fluid oscillates between states with and without bubble. We provide an example of phase flipping in a simulation of a Lennard-Jones fluid.

Title: EXAFS studies of the local environment of lead and selenium atoms in PbTe$_{1-x}$Se$_x$ solid solution
Authors: A. I. Lebedev, I. A. Sluchinskaya, V. N. Demin, I. Munro
Abstract: EXAFS spectroscopy is used to study the local environment of lead and selenium atoms in PbTe$_{1-x}$Se$_x$ solid solution. In addition to a bimodal distribution of bond lengths in the first shell, unusually large Debye--Waller factors for the Pb--Pb interatomic distances in the second shell and a substantial deviation of these distances from Vegard's law are observed. Valence force field (VFF) calculations show that these observations are due to the complex structure of the distribution function for Pb--Pb distances. It is found that the number of Se--Se pairs in the second shell surpasses the statistical value, which indicates that chemical factors play an important role in the structure of the solid solution. The contribution of these chemical factors to the enthalpy of mixing of the solid is estimated to be approximately 0.5 kcal/mole, which is comparable to the strain contribution.

Title: How Phase Coexistence affects the mechanical properties of heterogeneous 2D suspensions
Authors: Raul Molina-Prados Lallena, Jose Martin-Roca, Kristian Thijssen, Tyler Shendruk, Angelo Cacciuto, Chantal Valeriani
Abstract: Although numerical simulations of rheological measurements typically focus on homogeneous systems, heterogeneity can profoundly impact material properties. We report on the rheological properties of a suspension of two-dimensional Lennard-Jones particles across the gas/liquid and the gas/solid coexistence lines of the system. We show how the presence of multiple coexisting states has a significant impact on the mechanical properties of these systems when compared with their homogeneous reference counterparts. Our results establish an extended map to navigate a landscape where not only density and temperature, but also phase coexistence, dictate the transition from viscous to elastic-dominated behavior under shear. These results provides a benchmark for future research into heterogeneous fluids where the coexistence of complex dynamic states is frequently observed.

Title: Beam-Offset Thermoreflectance with Bayesian Optimization to Measure the Anisotropic Thermal Properties of Semiconductor Superlattices
Authors: A. Chatterjee, N. Spitzer, T. Kruck, P. Song, A. Ludwig, A. D. Wieck, J. Ordonez-Miranda, M. Pawlak
Abstract: The directional nature of heat conduction in semiconductor superlattices--marked by significant differences between in-plane and cross-plane pathways--poses substantial challenges for precise thermal property assessment. Conventional frequency-domain thermoreflectance (FDTR) techniques, while proficient at evaluating cross-plane thermal conductivity, suffer from restricted capability in resolving in-plane transport due to inherent phase-delay constraints and inadequate lateral resolution. In this investigation, we establish a non-contact beam-offset FDTR (BO-FDTR) approach that concurrently determines both directional thermal conductivities within layered semiconductor architectures. Our methodology implements spatial separation between excitation and detection beams while utilizing coupled normalized amplitude and phase responses as analytical inputs, thereby improving discrimination between anisotropic thermal parameters. We combine this experimental configuration with a Bayesian optimization scheme incorporating Gaussian Process Regression (BO-GPR) to reduce estimation inaccuracies, attaining measurement uncertainties under 1% to 2% at 95% confidence intervals. This technique demonstrates particular efficacy for intricate multilayer nanostructures, furnishing a structured protocol for superlattice thermal evaluation. Experimental characterization of an AlAs/GaAs superlattice (period thickness 52 nm) delivers thermal conductivity values of 14.7 W m-1 K-1 (cross-plane) and 37.4 W m-1 K-1 (in-plane). Our findings indicate that integrating frequency sweeps with varied beam offset locations yields superior measurement precision, exceeding conventional single-variable methods and confirming thermal assessment validity across both geometric arrangements.

Title: Three-slab model for the dielectric permittivity of a lipid bilayer
Authors: M.M.B. Sheraj, Amaresh Sahu
Abstract: A model for the tensorial dielectric permittivity of phospholipid membranes is presented here. The four-nanometer-thick membrane is treated as a composite made up of three dielectric slabs: one for each of the two phospholipid head-group regions, and one for the entire domain spanned by the lipid tails. Equal and opposite bound surface charge densities surround each head-group slab, and account for the membrane dipole potential. Three-slab model parameters are obtained from molecular dynamics simulations, and capture both the zero-field electric potential and the membrane response to applied electric fields. The tail region is well-approximated as having vacuum permittivity, while the head-group region is highly anisotropic due to the configurations of molecular dipoles. For the bilayers studied, the out-of-plane permittivity of the head-group region is 10--15 times that of the vacuum, while the in-plane permittivity is an order of magnitude larger. Membrane responses to applied electric fields up to 30 millivolts per nanometer are found to be in the linear regime. The model overcomes a fundamental limitation of microscopic theories -- where the out-of-plane permittivity is ill-posed in the head-group region due to large gradients in the local electric field -- by averaging over slab widths, thereby introducing new length scales. Our approach can be extended to characterize general interfacial systems with similarly ill-defined permittivities.

Title: Layer-number parity induced topological phase transition
Authors: Kai Chen, Junyan Guan, Jiamin Guo, He Gao, Zhongming Gu, Jie Zhu
Abstract: We demonstrate that stacking topologically trivial layers, under enforced symmetry restrictions, yields emergent topological phases with protected boundary states. Remarkably, the number of layers itself acts as a topological switch, enabling the system to host topological bound states in the continuum (BICs). We analytically show that the spectrum becomes gapless for an odd number of layers; combined with entanglement-spectrum calculations, this confirms that odd-layer systems indeed support topological BICs. We provide experimental confirmation of these phenomena in stacked acoustic lattices. Our findings establish a previously overlooked pathway to topology and demonstrate a readily applicable strategy for realizing exotic states in a wide range of artificial material systems.

Title: Superflows around corners
Authors: Thomas Frisch, Christophe Josserand, Sergio Rica
Abstract: We investigate analytically and numerically the dynamics of a two-dimensional superflow governed by the Gross-Pitaevskii equation passing over finite-size rectangular obstacles: an impenetrable wall and an impenetrable rectangular well. Extending classical studies of vortex nucleation around smooth obstacles, we focus on the role of sharp corners in determining the onset of vortex nucleation. Using a combination of analytical techniques based on the Schwarz-Christoffel methods for potential flow and on numerical simulations, we show that local velocity amplification near sharp corners crucially controls the critical flow velocity for vortex nucleation. For both wall and well configurations, we identify analytically and theoretically the critical velocities as a function of the obstacle width and its height or depth, finding an excellent agreement between the theory and our numerical simulations. Our results provide a simple framework for understanding superflow stability past finite-size obstacles with sharp features and are directly relevant to experimentally realizable configurations in atomic Bose-Einstein condensates and related superfluid systems.

Title: Prediction of the atomistic Hubbard U interaction from moiré system STM-images using image recognition
Authors: Nachiket Tanksale, Tobias Stauber
Abstract: The atomistic Hubbard interaction U, representing the on-site Coulomb repulsion, serves as a pivotal parameter in theoretical models describing of correlated systems, yet its precise experimental determination especially in moiré systems remains challenging. Scanning Tunneling Microscopy(STM) provides real-space images of the local density of states (LDOS), offering rich data sets that reflect the unique electronic structure of the material. Here, we introduce a systematic methodology for extracting the Hubbard U parameter directly from these LDOS images through the application of machine learning (ML) in the case of twisted bilayer graphene in the flat-band regime. The regression of U is highly accurate even though the image-similarity is greater than 99.98%. Subsequent data-analysis further suggest a weak crossover between the weak and strong coupling regime at Uc/t 1

Title: Atomistic substrate relaxation effects in the band gaps of graphene on hexagonal boron nitride
Authors: Jiaqi An, Nicolas Leconte, Srivani Javvaji, Youngju Park, Jeil Jung
Abstract: We assess the impact of atomistic substrate lattice relaxation schemes in the primary band gap at charge neutrality and the secondary valence band gap of graphene on hexagonal boron nitride (G/h-BN) as a function of twist angle. For zero twist angle, the primary gap decreases from $\sim 30$~meV in fully relaxed suspended G/h-BN bilayers, to $\sim 9$~meV when the remote h-BN substrate layer is kept rigid, and down to $\sim 3$~meV in completely rigid structures. In the presence of relaxations, the primary gap shows a maximum near $\sim 0.6^{\circ}$ coinciding with energetic stabilization due to alignment between the moiré pattern and the graphene lattice vectors, while the secondary valence band gap drops from $\sim 12$~meV down to zero beyond twist angles of $\sim 1^{\circ}$. A small but finite primary gap on the order of $\sim 1$~meV, with a mass sign favoring electronic occupation of carbon atop boron, persists across twist angles from $0^{\circ}$ to $30^{\circ}$ for all sliding configurations, and switches sign for twist angles between $30^{\circ}$ and $60^{\circ}$.

Title: Geometric Limits of Mitotic Pressure Under Confinement
Authors: Amit Singh Vishen
Abstract: Cells often divide under mechanical confinement, where surrounding structures restrict shape changes during cytokinesis. Although forces generated during confined division have been measured experimentally, it remains unclear how confinement geometry and mechanics determine the transmitted force. Here we develop a minimal mechanical theory of cell division under confinement. Modeling the cell as an incompressible volume bounded by an interface with effective isotropic tension, we show that confinement restricts the set of mechanically admissible furrow shapes. As the furrow radius decreases, it reaches it reaches a confinement-induced minimum. Beyond this point, further ingression does not alter the interface shape, and both pressure and axial force saturate. We analyze force and pressure in rigid, soft, and strong three-dimensional confinement and demonstrate that a single geometric mechanism underlies these distinct cases. After rescaling force and length by the appropriate geometric scale, cells of different size and surface tension collapse onto a single universal curve. The relevant length scale is the cell size for rigid and soft confinement, and the confinement size in fully enclosing three-dimensional confinement. In soft confinement, environmental stiffness and spindle-generated axial forces determine the operating force and pressure, while the geometric constraint fixes the maximal attainable levels. In summary, our results show that mitotic force transmission and mitotic pressure during cytokinesis are bounded by confinement geometry, with material properties and active forces selecting the operating point within these geometry-imposed limits.

Title: Work-hardening exhaustion as the origin of low toughness in L-PBF alloys: A case study on the role of intrinsic vs. extrinsic defects in SS316L
Authors: KenHee Ryou, Yaozhong Zhang, James A. D. Ball, Dan Rubio-Ejchel, Dillon Jobes, Buhari Ibrahim, Charles Romain, Henry Proudhon, Jerard V. Gordon
Abstract: Laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) additive manufacturing offers a remarkable balance of strength and ductility across many structural alloys. However, L-PBF alloys often display much lower fracture toughness, in some cases up to 70% below conventionally wrought counterparts. The reasons for this toughness paradox have remained elusive, since conventional tools cannot directly visualize sub-surface microscale deformation processes that govern crack growth. Here we apply scanning 3D X-ray diffraction and phase contrast tomography to simultaneously capture microstructural evolution with 1 micron resolution near an advancing crack tip, utilizing 316L stainless steel as a model system. We demonstrate that the toughness paradox is not solely a consequence of extrinsic processing defects or residual stresses, but rather an intrinsic failure to relax crack-tip stresses via plasticity. While wrought material facilitates stable crack-tip blunting through localized dislocation accumulation, the L-PBF material undergoes premature work-hardening saturation that triggers extreme stress partitioning and high stress triaxiality. This results in a transition from ductile blunting to a sharp, unstable fracture mode. These findings identify work-hardening exhaustion as a systemic vulnerability inherent to L-PBF microstructures, where the exceptional initial dislocation density required for high yield strength acts as a saturation ceiling for damage tolerance. This work provides a physical basis for adapting damage models to L-PBF metals and challenges the assumption that high tensile ductility guarantees fracture resistance in rapidly solidified components.

Title: Exact expression for the Berry connection in the projection gauge
Authors: Trey Cole, David Vanderbilt
Abstract: The Berry connection encodes the momentum-space geometry of occupied Bloch states in gapped insulators and plays a central role in topological materials. While gauge-invariant quantities can be evaluated from overlap matrices between neighboring $k$ points, accessing the Berry connection itself as a smooth field requires specifying a continuous gauge over the Brillouin zone. Wannier-based workflows achieve this through projection onto localized orbitals, enabling stable evaluation of geometric quantities and response functions. In this setting, the Berry connection enters directly in Wannier-interpolated calculations of polarization, Berry curvature, optical conductivity, and related response functions. In practical implementations, however, the projection-gauge Berry connection is typically constructed from finite-difference overlaps between neighboring $k$ points, discretizing momentum derivatives and introducing errors tied to $k$-mesh spacing and gauge alignment. These effects can become numerically delicate in systems with small band gaps or when evaluating higher-order responses such as the Chern-Simons axion angle. Here, we derive an exact expression for the non-Abelian Berry connection in the projection gauge that is local in crystal momentum. Starting from projected and orthonormalized Bloch-like states, we obtain a closed-form equation expressed entirely in terms of $k$-local quantities. We validate the formulation in one and three dimensions by computing the Berry phase and Chern-Simons axion angle in tight-binding models. The resulting framework provides a stable route to evaluating geometric properties within Wannier interpolation schemes and future first-principles implementations.

Title: A computationally efficient approach for predicting the transport properties of transition-metal alloys at elevated temperatures
Authors: Akshay Korpe, Manish Sudan, Ishtiaque K. Robin, Bikram Bhatia, Garrett Pataky, Thomas Berfield, Osman El-Atwani, Enrique Martinez
Abstract: A novel phenomenological framework for an efficient estimation of the thermo-electric properties at room temperature and elevated temperatures of body-centered cubic (BCC) transition metal concentrated alloys is proposed in this work. The methodology is used to predict the electrical resistivity of BCC systems with our predictions showing excellent correlation with experimental data. This framework is further extended to predict the electrical resistivity $\rho$, thermal conductivity $\kappa$ and the specific heat capacity Cp of BCC alloys in the temperature range of 300-1300 K and the results are validated against experimental data. We demonstrate the capabilities of this model by using it to predict the thermo-electric properties of a concentrated W53Ta42V5 alloy which shows a saturation in the electrical resistivity $\rho$ in the temperature range 300K-1300K. This model is then used to predict the properties of another concentrated Nb$_4$0Mo$_4$0Ta$_2$0 alloy in the same temperature regime.

Title: Critical Scaling and Metabolic Regulation in a Ginzburg--Landau Theory of Cognitive Dynamics
Authors: Gunn Kim
Abstract: We formulate a phenomenological effective field theory in which biological intelligence emerges as a macroscopic order parameter sustained by continuous metabolic flux. By modeling cognition as a coarse-grained neural activity field governed by a variational free energy, we derive closed-form expressions for information capacity and structural susceptibility using a Gaussian maximum entropy approximation. The theory predicts a universal algebraic divergence of the susceptibility, $\chi \sim K^{-3/2}$, as the structural stiffness $K$ approaches the instability threshold. The exponent $\gamma = 3/2$ is consistent with the mean-field branching process universality class, thereby providing a theoretical rationale for the observed avalanche size exponent $\tau \approx 3/2$ in cortical dynamics without invoking microscopic equivalence. We identify adult cognition as a metabolically pinned non-equilibrium steady state maintained near the critical regime $\Gamma \equiv K/\alpha \approx 1$ by continuous metabolic regulation, while pathological decline corresponds to a delocalization transition triggered by the violation of structural stability conditions. The framework generates concrete, falsifiable predictions for attention scaling, altered states of consciousness, and transcranial magnetic stimulation responses, each of which can be tested against existing neuroimaging and electrophysiological datasets.

Title: Nonlinear spin-Seebeck diode in $f$-wave magnets, third-order spin-Nernst effects in $g$-wave magnets and spin-Nernst effects in $i$-wave altermagnets
Authors: Motohiko Ezawa
Abstract: A prominent feature of $d$-wave altermagnets is that spin current is generated by applying temperature gradient, which is known as the spin-Nernst effect. We show in $f$-wave magnets that spin current is generated proportional to the square of the temperature gradient, which we call the nonlinear spin-Seebeck current. It can be used as a spin current diode. In addition, we show in $g$-wave altermagnets that spin current is generated in the third order of the temperature gradient. We also show in $i$-wave altermagnets that spin current is generated perpendicular to the temperature gradient, which is the spin-Nernst current. We have derived analytic formulas for these spin currents. It is interesting that these phenomena occur in the absence of the spin-orbit interaction. On the other hand, we show in $p$-wave magnets that spin current is not generated by temperature gradient.

Title: Hidden Chiral Ferroelectricity in AgNbO$_3$ Perovskite
Authors: Ying Song, Lingzhi Cao, Jinming Zhai, Zhilong Yang, Yali Yang, Laurent Bellaiche, Jiangang He
Abstract: AgNbO$_3$ is a lead-free perovskite with considerable potential for energy storage and optoelectronic applications, yet its low-temperature crystal structure has remained controversial. In this Letter, we revisit its low-energy structural landscape using a systematic first-principles structural search based on symmetry-adapted phonon-mode theory. We uncover a previously unreported chiral ferroelectric phase with space group $R3$, which exhibits a large spontaneous polarization and a low polarization switching barrier, enabling polarization reversal under electric fields. Crucially, the structural chirality of this phase is intrinsically locked to the ferroelectric polarization, allowing electrical control of the chiral handedness. Consequently, chiral optical responses--including circular dichroism, circular photogalvanic effect, optical activity, and second-order nonlinear optics--can be reversibly switched by an external electric field. These results not only clarify the complex low-temperature structural behavior of AgNbO$_3$ but also establish a rare purely inorganic platform for electric-field-tunable chirality, opening a pathway toward ultrafast, electrically controlled chiral optoelectronics.

Title: peapods: A Rust-Accelerated Monte Carlo Package for Ising Spin Systems

Abstract: We present peapods (this http URL), an open-source Python package for Monte Carlo simulation of Ising spin systems with arbitrary coupling constants on arbitrary-dimensional hypercubic lattices with periodic boundary conditions. The computational core is written in Rust and exposed to Python via PyO3, combining the ergonomic interface of Python with the performance of compiled, memory-safe code. The package implements Metropolis and Gibbs single-spin-flip algorithms, Swendsen--Wang and Wolff cluster updates, and parallel tempering. Replica-level parallelism is achieved through the Rayon work-stealing scheduler. We validate the implementation against the exact critical temperature of the two-dimensional Ising model via finite-size scaling of the Binder cumulant.

Title: Bridging Quantum and Classical Descriptions of Spin Dynamics in a Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya Trimer
Authors: Robert Wieser, Raúl Sánchez Galán
Abstract: The spin dynamics of a trimer with Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya (DM) interaction are investigated within a unified Hamiltonian framework that connects quantum-mechanical and semiclassical descriptions. The interpolation between the two regimes is realised by solving the modified Gisin-Schrödinger equation, in which the relative weight of a quantum coherence and local mean-field contributions is continuously tuned. The resulting dynamical behaviour is analysed and summarised in a ground state diagram that illustrates how the character of the spin motion evolves from fully quantum to semiclassical as the DM interaction is treated at different levels of approximation. In the last part of the publication, the chiral spin dynamics proposed by Da-Wei Wang et al. is examined theoretically, taking into account its behaviour at the boundary between quantum and classical physics.

Title: Giant Out-of-Plane Magnetic Orbital Torque of Altermagnets from Spin-Group Symmetry Breaking
Authors: Xukun Feng, Lay Kee Ang, Shengyuan A. Yang, Cong Xiao, X. C. Xie
Abstract: To search for nontrivial spintronic characters of altermagnets has been a focus in spintronics, with numerous attentions paid to spin-group symmetry dictated non-relativistic effects, such as the spin-splitting torque (SST). Here, we go beyond this paradigm by unveiling the magnetic orbital torque (MOT) that is enabled only by spin-group symmetry breaking of real altermagnets with spin-orbit coupling. This effect enables generating unconventional out-of-plane orbital current with collinear orbital polarization from all 10 spin Laue groups of centrosymmetric altermagnets, which is critical for field-free manipulation of perpendicular magnetization that is a key for next-generation information technology. We reveal perturbative and non-perturbative effects of spin-group symmetry breaking, and unveil that MOT is a much more generic effect of real altermagnets than SST. Our first-principles calculations predict giant out-of-plane MOTs at room temperature in the absence of and competing with SST in experimentally identified altermagnets CrSb and FeSb2, respectively. These findings uncover new fundamental physics in altermagnetic spintronics, and open up broad vistas of altermagnets in magnetic memory.

Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in square-planar nickelates has offered a rich materials platform to explore the origins of cuprate-like superconductivity. Experimental investigations however have largely been limited to the infinite-layer $R$NiO$_2$ ($R$=rare-earth) nickelates. Here, we construct a phase diagram of multi-layer square-planar Nd$_{n+1}$Ni$_n$O$_{2n+2}$ compounds and discover signatures of superconductivity for $n$ = 4 - 8. Upon decreasing the dimensionality $n$, the superconducting anisotropy evolves due to 4$f$ electron effects, and electronic structure characteristics approach cuprate-like behavior. Magnetic fluctuations persist from within the superconducting regime and into the over-doped, non-superconducting regime. Remarkably, the superconducting regime overlaps with that of chemically-doped infinite-layer nickelates, demonstrating underlying commonalities and distinct differences across varying structural realizations of square-planar nickelates. Our work establishes this layered template for creating new nickel-based superconductors.

Title: Training overdamped dynamics
Authors: Marc Berneman, Daniel Hexner
Abstract: In regimes where inertia is negligible, the temporal evolution is governed by overdamped dynamics. This limit is particularly relevant in soft-matter contexts, such as polymers, colloidal suspensions, and processes occurring at the cellular scale. Being able to manipulate the dynamics of such many-particle systems would enable control over rate-dependent elastic responses, time-dependent material properties, relaxation processes, and perhaps the hydrodynamics of suspensions. In this work, we develop a framework for manipulating overdamped dynamics through local, physically motivated update rules. Our approach is inspired by ideas from physical learning and directed aging, in which microscopic parameters adapt autonomously to endow a material with a desired function. Using the Rayleighian formulation, whose minimization reproduces the overdamped equations of motion, we derive approximate directed-aging and equilibrium-propagation rules tailored to dissipative systems. To demonstrate these ideas, we study a disordered Maxwell material that behaves elastically at short times but flows at long times. By locally modifying the viscous damping, we show that one can tune the viscous Poisson's ratio and shape local mechanical responses. These results illustrate how materials can be trained to exhibit targeted rate-dependent elastic and viscous behaviors.

Title: Precompression engineering of metal-insulator transition and magnetism in designed breathing kagome systems
Authors: Qingzhuo Duan, Hongdao Zhuge, Ying Liang, Tianxing Ma
Abstract: Kagome materials featuring dispersive Dirac cones and topological flat bands exhibit unique electronic and magnetic properties. However, kagome compounds with tunable electrical conductivity remain scarce, which severely impedes their device applications. Here, based on density functional theory (DFT) and Boltzmann transport theory, we introduce the breathing effect into kagome materials $\mathrm{Nb_3XCl_7}$ (X = F, Cl, Br, I) via chemical precompression, thereby inducing a metal-insulator transition and magnetic variation. We determine that the band structures, optical absorption spectra and magnetic ground states agree well with experimental results at the effective correlation strength $U_{\text{eff}} = 2$ eV. The calculated conductivity and magnetic properties reveal that the monolayer $\mathrm{Nb_3Cl_8}$ and $\mathrm{Nb_3XCl_7}$ undergoes transitions from paramagnetic metals to Mott insulators at $U_{\text{eff}} = 1$ eV and $t_{\text{out}}/t_{\text{in}} = 0.6674$, respectively. Our detailed analysis establishes that the stronger breathing effect corresponds to enhanced chemical precompression, which reduces the region of free electron gas between intercell Nb atoms and facilitates the metal-insulator transition. Finally, we propose several viable synthesis routes for $\mathrm{Nb_3FCl_7}$, $\mathrm{Nb_3BrCl_7}$, and $\mathrm{Nb_3ICl_7}$, providing predictive guidance for experimental studies. Our study establishes a practical framework for investigating the breathing effect in correlated kagome systems and yields valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying metal-insulator transition and magnetic properties in real breathing kagome materials.

Title: Constrained Diffusion for Accelerated Structure Relaxation of Inorganic Solids with Point Defects
Authors: Jingyi Cui, Jacob K. Christopher, Ankita Biswas, Prasanna V. Balachandran, Ferdinando Fioretto
Abstract: Point defects affect material properties by altering electronic states and modifying local bonding environments. However, high-throughput first-principles simulations of point defects are costly due to large simulation cells and complex energy landscapes. To this end, we propose a generative framework for simulating point defects, overcoming the limits of costly first-principles simulators. By leveraging a primal-dual algorithm, we introduce a constraint-aware diffusion model which outperforms existing constrained diffusion approaches in this domain. Across six defect configuration settings for Bi2Te3, the proposed approach provides state-of-the-art performance generating physically grounded structures.

Title: Specific features of the magnetic-field dependences of electrical resistivity in Bi--Mn solid solutions with low Mn content
Authors: A.V. Terekhov, V.M. Yarovyi, Yu.A. Kolesnichenko, K. Rogacki, E. Lähderanta, E.V. Khristenko, A.L. Solovjov
Abstract: For the first time, the field dependences of the magnetoresistance of a textured polycrystalline Bi$_{88.08}$Mn$_{11.92}$ sample were investigated in the $H \perp I$ and $H \parallel I$ configurations, and the results were compared with those previously obtained for the solid solution Bi$_{95.69}$Mn$_{3.69}$Fe$_{0.62}$ with a lower manganese concentration. It was demonstrated that the magnetoresistance field dependencies for Bi$_{88.08}$Mn$_{11.92}$ differ significantly from those of Bi$_{95.69}$Mn$_{3.69}$Fe$_{0.62}$ below 100 K, becoming nearly identical as the temperature approaches room temperature. It was established that the maximum relative magnetoresistance values for Bi$_{88.08}$Mn$_{11.92}$ are observed at a magnetic field of 90 kOe and a temperature of 100 K in both the $H \perp I$ and $H \parallel I$ configurations, amounting to 3170\% and 380\%, respectively. These values are significantly lower than those previously reported for the solid solution containing less manganese (Bi$_{95.69}$Mn$_{3.69}$Fe$_{0.62}$), which were 3877\% and 742\%, respectively. Analysis of the results indicates that differences in field dependence among the studied materials are associated with varying amounts of magnetic $\alpha$-BiMn. The anomalous magnetoresistance behavior, as compared with that of pure bismuth, is attributed to the influence of internal magnetism on electrical transport within the bismuth matrix of the studied solid solutions.

Title: Microgel Translocation Through Narrow Capillaries
Authors: Subhadip Biswas, Buddhapriya Chakrabarti
Abstract: The transport of soft viscoelastic gels through confined geometries underlies critical processes in biomedical, biological, and industrial systems. Here, we examine the translocation of a spherical microgel through a narrow capillary whose diameter is smaller than the equilibrium gel size. Using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations in tandem with mean-field theory and mechanical analysis, we uncover a critical threshold diameter $d_c$ below which the microgel cannot enter, regardless of the applied pressure. This geometric limit emerges from the interplay between gel elasticity and its internal network connectivity, captured quantitatively by a graph-theoretic model. We construct a phase diagram in the parameter space of tube diameter $d$, applied force $f_g$, and gel stiffness $Y$ (Young's modulus), which delineates the regimes of successful translocation and mechanical arrest. Under negligible wall friction, gel mobility scales with the applied force; however, beyond a cutoff set by the network topology, progressive densification in the constriction stalls the microgel. Our results reveal the mechanical and topological determinants of soft-gel transport in confinement and provide predictive guidelines for engineering gel-based systems in microfluidics, drug delivery, and tissue-level filtration.

Title: Microscopic origin of hard-plane antiferromagnetism in the Kondo lattice Ce2Rh3Ge5

Abstract: Hard plane antiferromagnetic order where ordered moments lie perpendicular to the single-ion crystal electric field easy axis is rare in Ce-based Kondo lattices and is a subject of active interest. Here we show that Ce$_2$Rh$_3$Ge$_5$ realizes a hard-plane antiferromagnetic state in which partial delocalization of the local moment gives rise to an RKKY exchange that overturns the single-ion easy-axis preference. Neutron diffraction reveals moments in the $ab$ plane, while inelastic neutron scattering and susceptibility establish a magnetic easy axis along $c$ in the paramagnetic regime, highlighting a clear inversion between single-ion and ordered-state anisotropies. In this work, we establish a unified microscopic framework to consistently account for partial $4f$-moment delocalization, enhanced in-plane RKKY exchange, and the resulting hard-plane antiferromagnetic order. Ce$_2$Rh$_3$Ge$_5$ thus provides a benchmark system in which single-ion anisotropy, Kondo screening, and RKKY exchange compete on comparable energy scales, revealing a cooperative route to hard-axis ordering in strongly hybridized Kondo lattices.

Title: On the Statistical Mechanics of Active Membranes: Some Selected Results
Authors: Sreekanth Ramesh, Prashant K. Purohit, Yashashree Kulkarni
Abstract: Biological membranes and vesicles play a central role in living systems, forming dynamic interfaces that regulate cellular organization and function. Classical descriptions of membrane mechanics that are rooted in equilibrium statistical mechanics and linear elasticity have yielded deep insights into membrane morphology and the role of thermal fluctuations on cellular function. However, real biological membranes operate far from equilibrium, continuously driven by active processes powered by energy consuming proteins. In this work, we employ a nonequilibrium statistical mechanics framework to model active membranes and derive analytical expressions for four fundamental properties that characterize their mechanical behavior: (a) the tension area relation, (b) the mean square amplitude of fluctuations, (c) correlation of normal vectors, and (d) the persistence length. These results collectively highlight the utility of fluctuation spectra as a starting point for elucidating membrane mechanics in both passive and active settings. Moreover, these results provide a theoretical basis for analyzing and interpreting fluctuation based assays of active membrane behavior.

Title: Dynamics and Pinning for Skyrmions in Altermagnets
Authors: J. C. Bellizotti Souza, C. J. O. Reichhardt, A. Saxena, C. Reichhardt
Abstract: We examine the dynamics, Hall angle, and pinning for N{é}el skyrmions in an altermagnet. Using an atomistic model, we show that skyrmion velocity and Hall angle dependence is anisotropic with respect to the direction of the drive, due to the fourfold symmetry implied by the two sublattices of the altermagnet. The skyrmion Hall angle and velocity at fixed drive show strong variations for increasing ratios of the exchange constant of the sublattices, $J_2/J_1$. This fourfold anisotropy of altermagnetic (ATM) skyrmions also leads to anisotropic pinning effects for an ATM skyrmion interacting with isotropic circular pinning sites. We also propose a simple particle model for this system that takes into account this anisotropy and find that it captures both the variations of the ATM skyrmion Hall angle and velocity as a function of drive direction, as also found in the atomistic simulations. Using this particle model, we examine ATM skyrmions interacting with a periodic array of pinning sites. For increasing ratios of $J_2/J_1$, we find a strongly non-monotonic ATM skyrmion velocity, where there is a minimum in the velocity where the skyrmion locks to different symmetry directions of the periodic pinning lattice. For a random array, we find that ATM skyrmions show strongly anisotropic depinning thresholds and velocity responses for different drive directions, and that the Hall angle is nearly constant with drive. In comparison, for the same parameters, the depinning threshold for a ferromagnetic (FM) skyrmion is lower, and the skyrmion Hall angle shows a strong velocity dependence. The lower depinning threshold for FM skyrmions is due to stronger Magnus forces.

Title: Nearly twofold overestimation of the superconducting volume fraction in pressurized Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates
Authors: Aleksandr V. Korolev, Evgeny F. Talantsev
Abstract: The detection of the DC diamagnetic state in pressurized Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates remained an unsolved experimental problem until recent experiments in which Zhu et al.$^1$ measured the DC diamagnetic responses in zero-field cooled (ZFC) mode in pressurized La4Ni3O10. Zhu et al.$^1$ reported that the ratio of the measured ZFC magnetic moment to the Meissner magnetic moment of the sample (and this ratio was termed the superconducting volume fraction$f$) reaches 81-86%. We regard outstanding experimental results$^1$; however, our calculations based on the reported experimental datasets$^1$ using the standard procedure showed the ratio to be 51-59%. Upon our request, Zhu et al.$^1$ provided detailed explanations and the equation they used to calculate$f$. To our knowledge, the procedure$^1$ and equation$^1$ for calculating $f$ have never been mentioned or described before, including in Ref.$^1$. Here we argue that the proposed equation$^1$ and procedure$^1$ are incorrect, and that this equation$^1$ results in multiple overestimations of the superconducting volume fraction in the sample. This overestimation error affects all superconducting volume fractions $f$ in Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates reported to date$^{1-4}$. Therefore, we describe the error we discovered in this paper.

Title: Unraveling the temperature-responsive charge-disproportionation in BaBiO$_3$
Authors: Sumit Sarkar, Priyanka Yadav, Sourav Chowdhury, Rajamani Raghunathan, Ram Janay Choudhary
Abstract: This study shows that the charge disproportionation at the Bi site in BaBiO$_3$ alters as a function of temperature. Decreasing the temperature from 300K down to 160K leads to a significant modification of the density of states corresponding to the Bi-O hybridized band near the Fermi level (E$_\text{F}$). This modification indicates reduction of Bi 6$sp$ - O 2$p$ hybridization and O 2$p$ spectral weight near E$_\text{F}$. The strong decrement of covalency at lower temperatures is accompanied by a decrement in O 2$p$ hole density due to possible charge transfer from Bi 6$s$ to the O 2$p$ band. Bi-charge state analysis from Bi-4$f$ core-level spectra showed that at 300K, $\delta$ (charge difference between alternate Bi sites) value in 4$\pm\delta$ is much less than at 160K, which reveals the transition towards the ionic nature of CD or static CD in BBO at low temperature. On the other hand, O 1$s$ core-level spectra displayed an asymmetric shape, and temperature-dependent modifications of the asymmetric shape and intensity have been observed. This highlights the significant influence of the O 2$p$ band hole on the dynamical CD at the Bi site.

Title: On the anomalous elasticity in the mechanical response of amorphous solids
Authors: Gilles Tarjus, Misaki Ozawa, Giulio Biroli
Abstract: The response of amorphous solids to a mechanical perturbation consists in an elastic and a plastic deformation. The latter is mediated by localized irreversible rearrangements associated with Eshelby-like quadrupolar singularities in the displacement field. It has recently been argued that a density of such singularities leads to an anomalous elastic behavior taking the form of screening effects, which goes beyond classical elastic predictions. Here, we reexamine this scenario using general theoretical arguments and a description in terms of an elasto-plastic model, which we compare with atomistic simulations of the canonical Eshelby inclusion geometry. We discuss the conditions under which a finite, i.e., nonvanishing, density of quadrupolar events is created by an imposed perturbation. We argue that, except when the perturbation is macroscopic, there are many situations in which the density of quadrupolar defects is zero in the thermodynamic limit. In these cases, we find that plastically active quadrupoles emerge in a region whose size generically scales as the spatial extent $\ell$ of the mechanical perturbation. This mechanism leads to anomalous elasticity on a scale $\ell$ close to the perturbation and to conventional elasticity beyond. The simulations of the elasto-plastic model reproduce the emergence of plastic quadrupoles in a region set by $\ell$ and the associated renormalization of the effective shear modulus, but they do not exhibit the dipole-screening signatures reported in atomistic and experimental studies. Our analysis delineates the scale-dependent breakdown of long-wavelength elasticity in amorphous materials and suggests directions for incorporating anomalous screening into mesoscopic modeling frameworks.

Title: Dual energy-differentiated topological transition in artificial red phosphorus chains
Authors: Vít Jakubský, B. Manjarrez-Montañez, Rafael A. Méndez-Sánchez, Yonatan Betancur-Ocampo
Abstract: We investigate the spectral and transport properties of an atomic chain of red phosphorus. We reveal the separation of flat-band states from the rest of the system and calculate its energy bands analytically. The topological properties of the system are established through the evaluation of the Berry (Zak) phase of the energy bands, revealing nontrivial topology. The Berry phase depends on the relative strength of the hopping parameters and exhibits dual energy-dependent topological phase transitions. Remarkably, the emergence of inert band edges provides a direct spectral signature of these transitions, acting as energy-resolved indicators of the redistribution of topological charge between bands. The existence of the associated edge states is proved numerically for finite lattices. The theoretical predictions, particularly the band structure and the existence of edge states, are further confirmed by numerical simulations of red phosphorus through a phononic lattice in the form of a highly structured aluminum plate.

Title: Enhanced $T_\mathrm{c}$ in eutectic high-entropy alloy superconductors Hf-Nb-Sc-Ti-Zr
Authors: Issei Kubo, Yuto Watanabe, Shuma Kawashima, Tomohiro Miyaji, Yoshikazu Mizuguchi, Terukazu Nishizaki, Jiro Kitagawa
Abstract: The present investigation into the superconducting properties of eutectic high-entropy alloy (HEA) Hf-Nb-Sc-Ti-Zr systems reveals an enhanced superconducting critical temperature ($T_\mathrm{c}$) in body-centered cubic (bcc) phases compared to typical quinary bcc HEAs. In Hf$_{10}$Nb$_{25}$Sc$_{25}$Ti$_{20}$Zr$_{20}$, Hf$_{5}$Nb$_{45}$Sc$_{20}$Ti$_{15}$Zr$_{15}$, and Hf$_{5}$Nb$_{45}$Sc$_{10}$Ti$_{5}$Zr$_{35}$ systems, which span a broad range of valence electron concentration per atom, lattice strain and the presence of partial or absent eutectic phases are characteristic features at lower annealing temperatures. The eutectic regions expand rapidly following annealing at 600$^{\circ}$C in all systems. The $T_\mathrm{c}$ of each system increases markedly with rising annealing temperatures from 400$^{\circ}$C to 600$^{\circ}$C, reaching a maximum value of 9.93 K in the Hf$_{5}$Nb$_{45}$Sc$_{10}$Ti$_{5}$Zr$_{35}$ sample annealed at 800$^{\circ}$C. Nearly all samples can be classified as strong-coupling superconductors. The sample annealed at 500$^{\circ}$C in the Hf$_{5}$Nb$_{45}$Sc$_{10}$Ti$_{5}$Zr$_{35}$ system exhibits a critical current density ($J_\mathrm{c}$) exceeding the practical threshold of 10$^{5}$ A/cm$^{2}$ up to approximately 4 T at 4.2 K and 6 T at 2 K. The elevated $J_\mathrm{c}$ is attributed to significant lattice strain and phase instability. The underlying mechanism for the enhanced $T_\mathrm{c}$ in Hf-Nb-Sc-Ti-Zr systems is examined through specific heat data analysis, suggesting that the expansion of the eutectic regions induced by thermal annealing plays a pivotal role.

Title: Insight into high-entropy effect in body-centered cubic superconducting alloys
Authors: Hanabusa Senga, Yuto Watanabe, Fubuki Iwase, Ryo Masuda, Daichi Kawahara, Toshiki Haruyama, Terukazu Nishizaki, Yoshikazu Mizuguchi, Jiro Kitagawa
Abstract: We have characterized the superconducting critical temperature ($T_\mathrm{c}$), the Debye temperature ($\theta_\mathrm{D}$), the electronic specific heat coefficient, and the Vickers microhardness of HfNbTiVZr, NbTiZr, HfNbTi, HfNbZr, and HfNbTa, all possessing a body-centered cubic (bcc) structure. By compiling a comparable dataset for other equiatomic quinary bcc high-entropy alloy (HEA) superconductors, we have examined the validity of the hypothesis regarding the high-entropy effect in bcc HEA superconductors, as proposed in our previous work. This hypothesis attributes the observed negative correlation between the electron-phonon coupling constant ($\lambda_\mathrm{e-p}$) and $\theta_\mathrm{D}$ to a reduced phonon lifetime at higher $\theta_\mathrm{D}$, arising from the uncertainty principle in highly disordered quinary alloys. However, a pronounced change in this negative correlation is not evident in equiatomic ternary alloys with a lower degree of atomic disorder, thereby providing limited support for the hypothesis. Alternatively, by assembling the full dataset of bcc alloys spanning binary through senary systems, we have identified a universal negative correlation between $\lambda_\mathrm{e-p}$ and $\theta_{D}$. This result would be useful for the materials design of bcc superconducting alloys. We further propose that the Vickers microhardness offers an alternative means to evaluate $\theta_{D}$ and may serve as a rapid screening metric for identifying bcc alloys with desired properties.

Title: Imaging the Superconducting Proximity Effect in S-S'-S Transition Edge Sensors

Abstract: Proximity effects at superconducting interfaces, between different superconductors (S-S') or between superconductors and normal metals (S-N), are fundamental to the performance of superconducting electronics, yet only few experiments have directly probed the spatial structure of proximity effects within a device. This is particularly relevant for transition edge sensors (TESs), where the interplay of direct and inverse proximity effects governs detector sensitivity. Here, we use scanning superconducting interference device (SQUID) susceptometry to directly image the local diamagnetic response in functional S-S'-S TES structures. We resolve long range proximity coupling extending over tens of micrometers, revealing that the local transition temperature is dramatically tuned by neighboring regions, being either enhanced by superconducting (S) leads or suppressed by normal metal (N) contacts. Our observations are quantitatively supported by Ginzburg Landau modeling of the device geometry and calculations of the temperature dependent diamagnetism based on self-consistent Usadel equations. By providing spatially resolved measurements of the interplay of proximity effects in TES devices, this work establishes a framework for understanding and controlling superconducting states in heterogeneous superconducting structures.

Title: Toward the Thermodynamic Limit: Neural Operators for Non-equilibrium Dynamics of Mott Insulators
Authors: Miles Waugh, Chuwei Wang, Radu Andrei, Nusair Islam, Taylor Lee Patti, Eugene Demler, Anima Anandkumar
Abstract: Mott insulators exhibit complex photoexcitation dynamics under intense optical driving, with potential implications for carrier multiplication beyond the Shockley-Queisser limit. Probing these nonequilibrium processes requires access to the thermodynamic limit, where the number of lattice sites becomes arbitrarily large, but conventional solvers are constrained to small systems due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space. Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs), originally developed for solving partial differential equations, naturally accommodate inputs of varying resolution and are capable of capturing nonlocal effects. Here, we employ FNOs to learn the mapping from noise-perturbed ground-state momentum distributions to their post-pulse counterparts across a range of interaction strengths and driving parameters. Trained only on small lattices, the model generalizes zero-shot to much larger systems, producing physically reasonable momentum distributions well beyond the reach of numerical solvers. Specifically, the model can predict momentum distribution for a 1024x1024 system within a few seconds that matches the theoretical behavior of key observables, whereas direct numerical simulations have so far been restricted to edge sizes of ~30. These results demonstrate the potential of neural operators to directly access large-scale nonequilibrium dynamics, providing a new pathway toward the thermodynamic limit in strongly correlated materials.

Title: Temporal magnon-qubit Mach-Zehnder interferometer
Authors: Cody Trevillian, Steven Louis, Vasyl Tyberkevych
Abstract: A temporal magnon-qubit Mach-Zehnder (MZ) interferometer is proposed. The interferometer is based on controllable entanglement of a microwave qubit and a magnonic state, achieved by application of a pulsed magnetic field playing the role of a magnon-qubit temporal "beam splitter". Analogous to a typical MZ interferometer, the generated interference pattern of the final qubit population carries information about the magnon dynamics. One important application of the proposed scheme is the study of single magnon decoherence. Interestingly, this scheme allows one to independently determine rates of two possible decoherence channels. This may help enable single magnon state applications and answer fundamental questions of quasi-particle decoherence at single quantum levels.

Title: Electron-electron and electron-phonon collision cross sections in CsV3Sb5
Authors: Charles Menil, Andrea Capa Salinas, Stephen D. Wilson, Benoît Fauqué, Kamran Behnia
Abstract: AV3Sb5 (A=K, Rb, Cs) are kagome metals and superconductors, attracting much recent attention as nexus of multiple quantum states. Here, through a systematic study of electric and thermal transport of CsV3Sb5, we identify iy as a metallic Fermi liquid with moderate electronic correlations ans strong electron-phonon (e-ph) collision cross section. We observe contributions to the inelastic electrical resistivity, each dominating within a distinct temperature window. The prefactor of the T2 is consistent with the Kadowaki-Woods scaling for a Fermi liquid with moderate correlation. By performing thermal conductivity measurements at zero and finite magnetic field, we separate the electronic and the lattice contributions to the thermal conductivity. The Wiedemann-Franz law is is satisfied in the zero-temperature limit, while a downward deviation emerges at finite temperature due to the mismatch between the prefactors of the electrical and thermal quadratic resistivities, as reported in other metals. The Bloch-Grüneisen description of electron-phonon scattering successfully accounts for both electronic thermal and electrical transport, indicating a remarkably large e-ph collision cross section in CsV3Sb5.

Title: Anisotropic magnetoresistance and magnetic field-tunable Weyl nodes in Weyl metal SrRuO$_{3}$ thin films
Authors: Uddipta Kar, Akhilesh Kr. Singh, Elisha Cho-Hao Lu, P.V. Sreenivasa Reddy, Fu-En Cheng, Wazid Ahmed, Song Yang, Chun-Yen Lin, Chia-Hung Hsu, Guang-Yu Guo, Wei-Li Lee
Abstract: Weyl semimetals are a unique class of topological materials, possessing Fermi-arc surface states and exhibiting the chiral anomaly effect. The chiral anomaly refers to non-equilibrium charge transfer within a Weyl-node pair of opposite chirality under the condition of aligned electric and magnetic fields ($\bf{E} \parallel \bf{B}$), leading to non-conserved chiral charges and thus enhanced electrical conductivity. In experiments, such an enhanced conductivity due to the chiral anomaly manifests as a negative longitudinal magnetoresistance (MR) when the external field $\bf{H}$ is applied along the bias current direction $\bf{I}$. In this work, we present rigorous $\phi$- and $\alpha$-dependent magnetotransport measurements to investigate such a negative longitudinal MR due to the chiral anomaly in a sunbeam-shaped device fabricated from an untwinned Weyl metal SrRuO$_{3}$ (SRO) thin film. Here, $\phi$($\alpha$) represents the angle between $\bf{I}$ and the in-plane $\bf{H}$(SRO monoclinic [001]$_{\rm o}$). Unusual $\phi$ dependences of in-plane MR and Hall effects were uncovered at low temperatures, accompanied by the emergence of the fourfold-symmetric component in the in-plane MR. These results indicate that the chiral anomaly and resistivity anisotropy in SRO play important roles. In particular, the dramatic variation of Weyl nodes near the Fermi level through magnetic field manipulation of the magnetization orientation, as revealed by band structure calculations, is consistent with the observed in-plane MR and Hall effect.

Title: Rashba Spin-Orbit Coupling Induced Topological Phases Transition in Honeycomb Nanoribbon Heterojunction
Authors: Hao-Ru Wu, Jhih-Shih You, Yiing-Rei Chen, Hong-Yi Chen
Abstract: We explore the emergence of non-trivial topological phases arising from the interplay between structural geometry and the spin degree of freedom. Our system is a honeycomb nanoribbon heterostructure with armchair edges, consisting of a central Rashba spin-orbit coupled (SOC) region sandwiched between two pristine armchair nanoribbons. As the strength of Rashba SOC is increased, topological edge states exhibit at the interface between the Rashba SOC and pristine armchair honeycomb nanoribbon (ANR), and these edge states remain robust under edge perturbations. In addition, we find that for a finite width ANR, Rashba SOC can open/close a gap depending on its strength, which leads to a topological phase transition. This work provides an alternative perspective on how Rashba SOC influences topological properties.

Title: From Quantum Chaos to a Reversed Quantum Disentangled Liquid in a Disorder-Free Spin Ladder
Authors: Hanieh Najafzadeh, Abdollah Langari
Abstract: The mechanisms by which isolated interacting quantum systems evade thermalization extend beyond disorder-induced many-body localization, encompassing a growing class of interaction-driven phenomena. We investigate a spin-1/2 ladder with asymmetric XY leg couplings and tunable Ising interactions on the rungs, and identify the microscopic origin of many-body localization (MBL) in this setting. Through a suite of diagnostics -including entanglement dynamics, fidelity susceptibility, adiabatic gauge potential norms, level-spacing statistics and entropy of eigenstates- we uncover a reentrant progression of dynamical regimes as the rung coupling Jz is varied: integrable behavior at Jz=0, quantum chaos at intermediate Jz, and a robust nonthermal regime at strong coupling. In the latter regime, we demonstrate the emergence of a reversed quantum disentangled liquid (reversed-QDL), where the light species thermalizes while the heavy species remains localized. The strong-coupling limit further yields emergent local integrals of motion anchored in a fixed-point structure, providing a microscopic origin of the observed quasi-MBL dynamics. These results establish reversed-QDL as a distinct, disorder-free route to nonergodicity and broaden the classification of dynamical phases in quantum matter.

Title: Improving Reliability of Machine Learned Interatomic Potentials With Physics-Informed Pretraining
Authors: Qianyu Zheng, Victor Fung
Abstract: Machine learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have emerged as powerful tools for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with their competitive accuracy and computational efficiency. However, MLIPs are often observed to exhibit un-physical behavior when encountering configurations which deviate significantly from their training data distribution, leading to simulation instabilities and unreliable dynamics, thus limiting the reliability of MLIPs for materials simulations. We present a physics-informed pretraining strategy that leverages simple physical potentials which can improve the robustness and stability of graph-based MLIPs for MD simulations. We demonstrate this approach by deploying a pretraining-finetuning pipeline where MLIPs are initially pretrained on data labelled with embedded atom model potentials and subsequently finetuned on the quantum mechanical ground truth data. By evaluating across three diverse material systems (phosphorus, silica, and a subset of Materials Project) and three representative MLIP architectures (CGCNN, M3GNet, and TorchMD-NET), we find that this physics-informed pretraining consistently improves both prediction accuracy as well as stability in MD compared to the baselines.

Title: Rotational anisotropy Raman spectrometer for high-sensitivity crystallographic symmetry analysis
Authors: Di Cheng, Junxiang Li, Shizhuo Luo, Zehao Chen, Xinwei Li
Abstract: Raman spectroscopy stands as a cornerstone technique for probing collective excitations and emergent quantum phases in solids. While polarization-resolved Raman scattering has been widely used to extract symmetry information of eigenmodes, its conventional geometry suffers from significant limitations: it accesses only a subset of Raman tensor elements, enforces {\pi}-periodic intensity patterns that obscure intrinsic crystalline symmetries, and lacks sensitivity to wavevector-dependent anisotropy. To overcome these constraints, here we introduce rotational-anisotropy Raman spectroscopy (RA-Raman). By measuring scattering intensity during full azimuthal rotation of the optical scattering plane at oblique incidence, this geometry enables complete reconstruction of the Raman tensor and reveals rich rotational anisotropy patterns essential for accessing subtle symmetry information elusive to conventional methods. We developed a prototype instrument to validate this approach experimentally. For centrosymmetric crystals, RA-Raman unambiguously identifies phonon symmetry representations and determines crystallographic axes. In noncentrosymmetric crystals, it resolves directional anisotropy and angular dispersion of phonon-polaritons, enabling quantitative determination of the Faust-Henry coefficient and the separation of deformation-potential and electro-optic scattering contributions. By demonstrating unprecedented symmetry-resolving power in standard benchmark crystals, we establish RA-Raman as a powerful tool with far-reaching potential to discover and characterize symmetry-breaking phases and topological excitations in quantum materials.

Title: Coherent Phonon-Driven Band Renormalizations in 1T$'$-MoTe$_2$
Authors: Carl E. Jensen, Christoph Emeis, Stephan Jauernik, Petra Hein, Fabio Caruso, Michael Bauer
Abstract: Here, we investigate phonon mode- and electron band-selective electron-phonon couplings in centrosymmetric 1T$'$-MoTe$_2$ using time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy combined with frequency-domain analysis. Femtosecond near-infrared pulses excite coherent $A_g$-symmetric phonon modes at 2.34 THz, 3.34 THz, and 3.86 THz, which manifest as oscillatory modulations in photoemission intensity and binding energy across the valence bands. Pixel-wise Fourier analysis using recently developed methodologies reveals pronounced band selectivity with distinct coupling strengths for different electronic states and phonon modes, enabling the evaluation of band-renormalization amplitudes in the range of few meV. Ab initio calculations qualitatively reproduce the experimentally observed coupling patterns and relative trends, demonstrating the capability of combined experimental and theoretical approaches to resolve ultrafast electron-phonon interactions in quantum materials.

Title: Data-Driven Bath Fitting for Hamiltonian-Diagonalization Dynamical Mean-Field Theory
Authors: Taeung Kim, Jeongmoo Lee, Ara Go
Abstract: We propose a machine-learning-based initialization method to overcome the nonlinear bath-fitting bottleneck in Hamiltonian-diagonalization-based dynamical mean-field theory (HD-DMFT). In HD-DMFT, the continuous hybridization function is approximated by a finite set of bath-site energies and hybridization amplitudes, determined by minimizing a highly non-convex multivariable cost function. As the number of bath sites increases, the optimization becomes more sensitive to the initial guess and more prone to suboptimal local minima, which can slow or destabilize the DMFT self-consistency loop. We reformulate bath fitting as a supervised regression problem and train a kernel ridge regression model to predict near-optimal discrete bath parameters directly from the target hybridization function on the Matsubara axis. To ensure physical relevance and data diversity, we construct the training dataset from tight-binding Hamiltonians of layered-perovskite-like ruthenate models across systematically deformed structures, instead of relying on naive random parameter sampling, and obtain high-quality labels through fully converged conventional bath fitting. Time-reversal symmetry is explicitly incorporated in both feature and target representations to reduce effective dimensionality and enforce physical consistency. Benchmarks in the non-interacting limit show that the learned initialization systematically reduces the initial fitting error, decreases the number of conjugate-gradient iterations, and improves robustness against local minima over a wide range of bath sizes. We further demonstrate transferability to interacting DMFT calculations for $\mathrm{Sr_{2}RuO_{4}}$ solved with an adaptive-truncation impurity solver, where the ML initialization yields consistently faster convergence than a symmetry-preserving heuristic baseline while preserving the final fitted solution.

Title: Theory of strained quantum emitters
Authors: Vytautas Žalandauskas, Rokas Silkinis, Lukas Razinkovas, Ali Tayefeh Younesi, Minh Tuan Luu, Ronald Ulbricht, Ulrike Grossner, Lasse Vines, Marianne Etzelmüller Bathen
Abstract: Defects in semiconductors acting as optically active spin qubits are intriguing objects of fundamental study and future technological developments. These defect-based color centers are of particular interest for detection and response to physical variations such as pressure and strain. To investigate the defect emission response to strain, we have studied the vibrational structure of the negatively charged silicon vacancy ($\mathrm{V_{Si}^{-}}$) in 4H-SiC under applied tensile and compressive uniaxial strain using first-principles calculations. The strain variations of the emission spectrum can be explained by differing responses of bulk-like and quasi-localized vibrational modes. In particular, substantial differences are found between the hexagonal ($h$) and quasicubic ($k$) configurations of $\mathrm{V_{Si}^{-}}$ in 4H-SiC that result in a strain-induced improvement of the Debye-Waller factor for $\mathrm{V_{Si}^{-}}(h)$ under $+2\%$ uniaxial strain along the $a$-axis of 4H-SiC. Finally, strain-dependent changes in the phonon sideband enable distinguishing between compressive and tensile strain, opening up the possibility of magnetic field-free strain detection using only spin-conserving transitions of solid-state quantum emitters.

Title: Investigation of Corroded T91 Steel in Static Lead-Bismuth Eutectic Under an Oxidising Environment
Authors: Minyi Zhang, Weiyue Zhou, Michael P. Short, Paul A.J. Bagot, Michael P. Moody, Felix Hofmann
Abstract: Understanding corrosion in liquid metal-cooled nuclear systems is tantamount to controlling it. While much literature exists detailing corrosion rates and mechanisms of structural materials in liquid metals, much still remains to be discovered in new regimes of temperature, chemistry, and impurity levels. We focus on a less-studied set of conditions, specifically to investigate how liquid lead-bismuth eutectic (LBE) corrodes ferritic/martensitic steels in high-temperature oxidizing conditions. We find that corrosion follows grain boundaries, transitioning from intergranular attack to broader area corrosion as it progresses. Both the Cr and oxygen diffusion play vital roles in this process. Mechanistically speaking, the ingress of LBE induces regions of martensitic decomposition to ferrite via localized Cr depletion, somewhat blunting or slowing the corrosion from occurring. A stable, coherent oxide scale appears to be the deciding factor controlling whether intergranular LBE attack occurs or not. Most surprisingly, a layer of Fe enriched BCC phase forms on the surface of LBE-corroded T91 at these conditions, contradicting previous studies, including our own, which reported oxide-based surface layers.

Title: Bridging atomic and mesoscopic length scales with Replica Scanning Tunneling Microscopy: Visualizing the intra-unit cell pair density modulation of superconducting FeSe at micron length scale

Canfield, Georg Knebel, Midori Amano Patino, Gerard Lapertot, Jacques Flouquet, Jean Pascal Brison, Dai Aoki, Paula Giraldo-Gallo, Jose Augusto Galvis, Isabel Guillamón, Edwin Herrera Vasco, Hermann Suderow
Abstract: Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) is a cornerstone technique for visualizing the electronic density of states with atomic resolution (typically below 0.1 nm). While the field of view of most STM setups extends up to a few microns, obtaining atomic resolution over these large areas is often impractical and excessively time-consuming. This is due to the need to acquire maps with a point number reaching 107 or more with a full current or conductance vs voltage curve at each point. The standard procedure is to make large scale maps and then select small regions to zoom-in for high-resolution atomic scale analysis. However, this approach fails to address a question which is often critical: Does a specific atomic-scale modulation of the electronic density of states persist over much larger, mesoscopic length scales? Here we present a new method: Replica STM (R-STM), that overcomes this limitation, allowing the study of atomic-scale phenomena up to micron length scales. We obtained new large-area STM tunneling conductance maps in UTe2 and FeSe, spanning areas over 200 nm in size. In these large scale maps we discovered signals with wavelengths significantly exceeding interatomic distances. We show that these large-wavelength signals are replicas of the underlying atomic-scale density of states modulations. R-STM leverages these replica signals to efficiently track atomic-scale features over large areas. Using this novel technique, we show that the pair density modulation discovered recently in FeSe persists with the same characteristic wavelength up to hundreds of nm length scales. R-STM provides a powerful and practical new capability for STM to compare atomic scale with micrometer scale phenomena. The proof of principle of R-STM can be extended to any other scanning probe microscopy experiment where a periodic signal is traced as a function of position.

Title: Optical properties of single CsPbBr3 perovskite quantum dots synthesized by a modified ligand-assisted reprecipitation method
Authors: Marina Cagnon Trouche, Ernest Ruby, Margaux Cartier, Christophe Voisin, Maxime Vallet, Yannick Chassagneux, Cédric R. Mayer, Carole Diederichs
Abstract: Colloidal perovskite quantum dots (pQDs) are promising quantum light emitters, and investigations at the single pQD scale have so far relied mostly on hot-injection synthesis, which requires precise temperature control and an inert atmosphere. While alternative synthesis routes under milder conditions are often associated with structural and surface defects that may have limited impact in ensemble measurements, demonstrating high optical quality at the level of individual pQDs constitutes the most stringent benchmark for a new synthesis protocol. Here, we demonstrate that a modified ligand-assisted reprecipitation (LARP) approach yields CsPbBr3 pQDs showing state-of-the-art optical properties at the scale of single emitters. By combining an amine-mediated post-synthetic size-trimming strategy with didodecyldimethylammonium bromide (DDAB) ligands for enhanced surface passivation and colloidal stability, we obtain isolated pQDs with stable emission and minimal spectral diffusion at cryogenic temperatures. Micro-photoluminescence experiments resolve the characteristic fine structure of the bright exciton, its low-energy optical phonon replicas, and the trion and biexciton states. Time-resolved and photon correlation measurements show a ~90 ps lifetime and high purity single photon emission, respectively. These results demonstrate that modified LARP synthesis constitutes an accessible alternative to hot injection, preserving the intrinsic excitonic and quantum optical properties of individual pQDs while offering greater flexibility for post-synthetic ligand engineering, as exemplified here by the use of DDAB for surface passivation.

Title: Strain- and Field-Tunable Nonrelativistic Spin Splitting and Wave-Symmetry-Dependent Spin Transport in Twisted Bilayer Altermagnets
Authors: Shantanu Pathak, Saswata Bhattacharya
Abstract: Magnetism-driven nonrelativistic spin splitting (NRSS) provides a pathway toward efficient, spin-orbit-free spintronics. In centrosymmetric two-dimensional antiferromagnets, spin-polarized transport is symmetry-forbidden due to the combined space-time inversion ($PT$) symmetry. Here, by employing first-principles density functional theory and spin-group symmetry analysis, we demonstrate that twisting two antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic monolayers of CoCl$_2$, AX$_2$ (A = Mn, V; X = Cl, Br, I), NiF$_2$, NiBr$_2$, FeS, CoS, MnTe$_2$, MnSe$_2$, and RuSe induces finite NRSS even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. The relative twist breaks $[C_2||P]$ and $[E||C_{nz}]$ symmetries, giving rise to momentum-dependent spin polarization with distinct $d$-, $g$-, and $i$-wave altermagnetic patterns across the Brillouin zone. Using symmetry-invariant $k\cdot p$ modeling, we extract linear spin-splitting coefficients $\alpha^{(1)}$ ranging from 800-1100 meVÅ, comparable to SOC-induced Rashba-Dresselhaus strengths observed in noncentrosymmetric semiconductors. An out-of-plane electric field ($\mathcal{E}_z$) introduces Zeeman-type band splitting up to 110 meV at 10 MV/cm, while biaxial strain tunes the NRSS magnitude nearly linearly without altering symmetry. Crucially, the strain $u_{xx-yy}$ reduces the spin point group symmetry and drives reversible $g/i \rightarrow d$ wave-type transitions, resulting in finite spin conductivity and an enhanced spin-splitter angle (up to 18$^\circ$). These results extend the concept of altermagnetism to twisted bilayer geometries and establish a general route for realizing exchange-driven, nonrelativistic spin currents through symmetry engineering without requiring heavy elements or spin-orbit coupling.

Title: Anisotropic fully-gapped superconductivity in quasi-one-dimensional Li$_{0.9}$Mo$_6$O$_{17}$
Authors: M. J. Grant, T. M. Huijbregts, R. Nicholls, M. Greenblatt, P. Chudzinski, A. Carrington, N. E. Hussey
Abstract: Superconductivity in quasi-one-dimensional Li$_{0.9}$Mo$_6$O$_{17}$ emerges from an exotic, non-metallic normal state that exhibits signatures of Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid behavior, emergent symmetry and excitonic order. The high upper critical field, $H_{c2}$, in Li$_{0.9}$Mo$_6$O$_{17}$ suggests that that the favored pairing state is spin-triplet in nature. Here, we report measurements of the magnetic penetration depth down to $0.08\,\mathrm{K}$ ($T/T_c \lesssim 0.04$) and the specific heat down to $0.4\,\mathrm{K}$ ($T/T_c \lesssim 0.2$), and show that they are consistent with a moderately-coupled, fully-gapped superconducting state with marked gap anisotropy and a minimum ($\Delta_{\rm min} \simeq 0.4\,k_{\mathrm{B}}T_c$) occurring over a very narrow region in $k$-space. Combined with knowledge of $H_{c2}$, these measurements support the presence of a nodeless and possibly odd-parity spin-triplet superconducting order parameter in Li$_{0.9}$Mo$_6$O$_{17}$.

Title: Twist-induced altermagnetism in a metallic van der Waals antiferromagnet
Authors: Alberto M. Ruiz, Andrei Shumilin, Rafael González-Hernández, José J. Baldoví
Abstract: Altermagnetism -a magnetic state characterized by spin-polarized electronic bands at zero net magnetization- offers a promising route for next-generation spintronic devices. In two-dimensional (2D) magnets, twist engineering enables its realization by breaking the combined inversion and time-reversal symmetry (PT) while preserving crystal symmetries that ensure the altermagnetic order. Here, by means of first-principles calculations and symmetry analysis, we demonstrate that twist engineering applied to the recently synthesized metallic van der Waals antiferromagnet Co-doped bilayer Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ (Fe$_2$CoGaTe$_2$) provides a robust platform for altermagnetism. By twisting two layers of Fe$_2$CoGaTe$_2$, the PT symmetry between opposite spin sublattices is broken, resulting in a non-relativistic $i$-wave altermagnetic state with spin splitting up to 138 meV. In the absence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC), the electronic states are spin-degenerate along six high-symmetry directions, while the inclusion of SOC preserves this degeneracy along the three directions protected by twofold rotation axes. Furthermore, we unveil the microscopic mechanisms governing the magnetic behavior in twisted Fe$_2$CoGaTe$_2$. Our results establish twist engineering and metallic Fe-based van der Waals antiferromagnets as versatile platforms to realize 2D van der Waals altermagnetism, with potential for designing high-efficiency ultrathin nanodevices.

In this short note, I report on the discovery of two-parameter families of MPOs that commute with with the Heisenberg spin chain Hamiltonian in the XXX, XXZ, and XYZ cases. I describe a symbolic algebra approach for finding such integrals of motion and speculate about possible applications.

Abstract: Lasers serve as the fundamental workhorses of photonic quantum technologies, with perfectly coherent light fields being essential for many protocols that generate nonclassical light, implement coherent control schemes, and initialize qubits. However, no laser is absolutely ideal and the implications of deviations from perfect coherence in quantum technological tasks remain unclear. In this study, we theoretically and experimentally explore the quantum coherence properties of lasers from a resource theory perspective, establishing a significant connection between photonics, quantum optics, and quantum information science. We demonstrate that the maximum achievable quantum coherence for laser light is constrained by spontaneous emission and the purity of the dephased laser field state. As a critical example application in quantum information protocols, we show that the quantum coherence of a laser field with a given mean photon number directly governs the maximum purity attainable when initializing a qubit in a superposition state through resonant driving. Our findings are highly relevant for bridging applied physics and engineering with integrated photonic quantum technologies and resource theories, paving the way for reliable benchmarking of various coherent light sources for applications in photonics and quantum protocols.

Title: Thermodynamic Geometry of Classical and Quantum Statistics in the Relativistic Regime
Authors: Hosein Mohammadzadeh, Zahra Ebadi, Omid Yahyayi Monem, Mohammad Hossein Naghizadeh Ardabili
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic geometry of classical and quantum ideal gases in the relativistic regime, with particular emphasis on the effects of particle mass and spatial dimensionality. Relativistic kinematics is incorporated through the full energy-momentum dispersion relation and the corresponding relativistic density of states. Using the Fisher-Rao information metric derived from the partition function, we analyze the thermodynamic curvature for Maxwell-Boltzmann, Bose-Einstein, and Fermi-Dirac statistics. Exact analytical expressions are obtained in two spatial dimensions, while the three-dimensional case is studied numerically. We show that the thermodynamic curvature preserves its characteristic sign-positive for bosons and negative for fermions; even in the relativistic regime, reflecting effective attractive and repulsive statistical interactions, respectively. A distinctive relativistic effect is the shift of curvature singularities from the non-relativistic critical point to a mass-dependent threshold at $\mu=mc^{2}$. In addition, the relativistic Bose-Einstein condensation temperature is evaluated, revealing explicit mass-dependent corrections to the non-relativistic result. These findings provide a unified geometric perspective on relativistic statistical systems and clarify the interplay between quantum statistics, relativistic kinematics, and critical behavior.

Title: Machine learning protocol to identify pairing symmetries via quasiparticle interference imaging in Ising superconductors
Authors: Adam Hložný, Jozef Haniš, Martin Gmitra, Marko Milivojević
Abstract: Identifying the pairing symmetry in unconventional superconductors is essential for reliably characterizing their superconducting states and for enabling their integration into realistic quantum devices. Here, we introduce a machine-learning-guided strategy to determine pairing symmetry from quasiparticle interference (QPI) data, which integrates first-principles calculations, tight-binding modeling, and symmetry-based classification of the superconducting pairing function. We demonstrate the approach on monolayer NbSe2 as an experimentally accessible probe of superconductivity in real materials, within a single scalar-impurity Bogoliubov-de Gennes framework. Our analysis shows that the QPI-to-parameter inverse problem can be solved with high accuracy for most superconducting pairing channels in this setting, indicating that QPI carries rich, learnable information about the superconducting gap structure. Taken together, these results demonstrate that machine-learning-assisted QPI analysis provides a promising pathway for precise learning of superconducting pairing functions in quantum materials.

Title: Bismuth-substituted Lutetium Iron Garnet Films with Giant Visible-Range Magneto-Optical Sensitivity
Authors: Megan H. Dransfield, Matthijs H. J. de Jong, Lukáš Flajšman, Laure Mercier de Lépinay, Sebastiaan van Dijken
Abstract: Magneto-optical materials are indispensable across modern physics, serving as the foundation for precision magnetic sensing, nonreciprocal photonics, and optical isolation technologies. The continual pursuit of materials with high Verdet constants has driven the development of garnet-based compounds exhibiting extreme magneto-optical sensitivity. In this work, we report the growth and comprehensive magneto-optical characterization of bismuth-substituted lutetium iron garnet (LuBiIG), a material that combines the large spin-orbit coupling of bismuth with the lattice stability of lutetium iron garnet. The films exhibit an exceptionally high Verdet constant of up to -0.120 deg/um/mT, peaking in the visible spectral range near 520nm. LuBiIG films with thicknesses between 80 and 220nm were grown by pulsed laser deposition and characterized at room temperature over the 500-820nm wavelength range. These results position LuBiIG as a highly sensitive magneto-optical material suitable for advanced cryogenic detection and hybrid quantum applications.

Title: Floquet product mode and eigenphase order
Authors: Felix Möckel, Harald Schmid, Felix von Oppen
Abstract: We study the robustness of the Floquet quantum Ising model against integrability-breaking perturbations, focusing on the phase hosting both Majorana zero and $\pi$ modes. A recent work [Phys. Rev. B 110, 075117, (2024)] observed that the Floquet product mode, a composite edge mode constructed from both Majorana operators, is considerably more robust than the individual Majorana edge modes. We analyze these strong modes from the point of view of the eigenphase order present in finite chains with open boundary conditions. As a result of the Majorana modes, all Floquet eigenstates come in quadruplets in the integrable limit. We show that the robustness of the various modes as well as the behavior of the boundary spin correlation functions can be understood in terms of the spectral statistics of these quadruplets in the presence of integrability-breaking perturbations.

Title: Transcendental momentum quantization in semiconducting Rashba nanowires and zero energy states in their normal and superconducting phase
Authors: Nico Leumer, Harald Schmid, Milena Grifoni, Magdalena Marganska
Abstract: We study finite system properties of the canonical low energy model for a semiconducting nanowire with Rashba spin-orbit coupling. The case of an isolated wire as well as of one proximitized by an s-wave superconductor are considered. Already for the normal wire, the presence of spin-orbit coupling leads to eigenstates of the finite system composed of more than two momentum eigenstates. The quantization condition for the wavevectors is not that of a quantum box, but given instead by a transcendental equation linking the involved wavevectors. For the wire with superconducting pairing, the presence of electron and hole channels complicates the composition of the eigenstates. In this case we derive an approximate quantization condition close to the phase boundary, and a condition for the appearance of exact zero energy states. It can be satisfied both in the topological and in the trivial phase. Both the trivial and topological zero energy states contribute to the linear transport through Andreev reflection and direct transmission processes, with their relative importance depending on the degree of the states' localization at the boundary.

Title: A label-free method to quantify early-stage amyloid aggregation under flow via intrinsic phenylalanine fluorescence

Abstract: The aggregation of amyloid-forming peptides is a dynamic, complex process that underlies their diverse biological activities, from physiological functions to disease-associated dysfunctions. While the structure of fibrillar end-products is well-characterized for most amyloids, the heterogeneous and often transient oligomers, likely key in cytotoxicity, remain poorly investigated, especially for peptides with low-yield aromatic residues. Here, by exploiting and developing flow induced dispersion analysis in both peak and front modes, we demonstrate that intrinsic phenylalanine fluorescence can be harnessed to quantify the conversion of diffusing monomers into non-diffusing oligomers and fibrils. We further characterize low-molecular-weight oligomers, and their size evolution from 2 to 10 nm over time. Importantly, we validate the robustness of our approach using two tryptophan-free and fast-fibrillating amyloid peptides, PSM$\alpha$3 and hIAPP, known for their key roles in S. aureus virulence and type 2 diabetes respectively. Our results overcome the limitations of traditional biochemical and biophysical amyloid assays by extending analysis from large oligomers and fibrils to small heterogeneous oligomers, under near-physiological conditions. This study thus offers a new analytical framework, thereby filling a critical gap in amyloid research, to probe the early stages of aggregation, key in the design of alternative therapeutics for amyloid-diseases.

Title: Interface stability of beta-Ga2O3 (100) on oxidized Si- and C-terminated 3C-SiC (001) substrates: a first-principles investigation
Authors: Marica Licciardi, Aldo Ugolotti, Emilio Scalise, Leo Miglio
Abstract: We provide a first-principles modeling of the beta-Ga2O3/3C-SiC interface that takes into account the reconstructions occurring at the 3C-SiC (001) surface by oxidation, aiming to mimic the actual deposition process under the best structural and thermodynamic conditions. Using density functional theory calculations, we systematically investigate the interface configurations between beta-Ga2O3 (100) and both Si- and C-terminated 3C-SiC (001) substrates, considering realistic oxidation states that form at the SiC surface prior to epitaxial growth. Our analysis evaluates different stacking sequences and atomic-scale bonding arrangements, computing adhesion energies for various interface geometries to determine their relative thermodynamic stability. This work addresses the critical need for understanding beta-Ga2O3 integration on substrates with superior thermal conductivity, providing a theoretical framework for optimizing heteroepitaxial growth conditions in ultra-wide-bandgap power electronics applications.

Title: Suppressed Rupture of Thin Metal Films via van der Waals Epitaxy
Authors: Wenxiang Wang, Jiaxing Wang, Guotong Wang, Zhichao Yan, Chenxiao Jiang, Siqin Zhou, Chuanli Yu, Jianhao Chen, Kun Zheng, Thomas Salez (LOMA), Xiaoding Wei, Zhaohe Dai
Abstract: Ultrathin metal films exhibit liquid-like instabilities, rupturing via surface diffusion far below their melting points. This behavior constrains thermal budgets for advanced integrated circuits and emerging 2D-crystal devices. Here, we demonstrate that these instabilities can be fundamentally suppressed using graphene as a van der Waals (vdW) template. While conventional 20-nm-thick gold films break up into islands below 300 {\textdegree}C, templated films not only remain stable but also become structurally refined after annealing above 600 {\textdegree}C. This exceptional stability stems from a vdW-mediated crystallographic texture that reorganizes grain boundaries into a mechanically robust network. This mechanism significantly widens the processing window for nanoscale interconnects and enables high-temperature integration of metals with 2D-crystal technologies.

Title: Separation of the Kibble-Zurek Mechanism from Quantum Criticality
Authors: R. Jafari, Alireza Akbari
Abstract: When a system is swept through a quantum critical point (QCP), the Kibble-Zurek mechanism predicts that the average number of topological defects follows a universal power-law scaling with the ramp time scale. This scaling behavior is determined by the equilibrium critical exponents of the underlying phase transition. We show that the correspondence between Kibble-Zurek scaling and quantum criticality does not hold generally. In particular, the defect density can exhibit a suppression faster than the Kibble-Zurek prediction even when the quench crosses a critical point, while conventional Kibble-Zurek scaling may persist for quenches through a non-critical point. Our results, based on models representative of a broad class of quasi-one-dimensional Fermi systems, identify the dynamical conditions under which universal defect scaling emerges and clarify the relation between defect generation and equilibrium criticality.

Title: Kerr-like effect induced by quantum-metric nematicity
Authors: Wenhao Liang, Akito Daido, K. T. Law
Abstract: The magneto-optic Kerr effect (MOKE), which describes the rotation and ellipticity of linearly polarized light upon reflection, typically occurs in magnetic materials that break time-reversal ($\mathcal{T}$) symmetry. Here we theoretically demonstrate that a similar effect can emerge even in two-dimensional nonmagnetic systems with $\mathcal{T}$ symmetry, owing to the nontrivial quantum geometry of electrons. We reveal that the nematicity of the quantum metric, which corresponds to electric quadrupole moment of electron wave packets, gives rise to a Kerr-like effect (KLE) depending on the incident polarization angle. Notably, neither magnetic order nor spin-orbit coupling, which are conventionally considered essential for the MOKE, is required for its emergence. The KLE is demonstrated by using both a minimal tight-binding model and a model for strained MoS$_2$ with parameters determined by first-principle calculations. This work reveals a quantum-geometric origin for polarization rotation effects beyond the MOKE and offers a distinct approach to probe quantum geometry and multipole moments of electrons.

Title: Linearised Identification of Mechanical and Structural Anisotropy of Granular Materials from Hollow-Cylinder Experiments
Authors: Mehdi Pouragha, Gertraud Medicus, Selvarajah Premnath, Siva Sivathayalan
Abstract: Anisotropy in granular materials arises from both the internal fabric and the directionality of the stress state, yet separating these effects experimentally remains challenging. This study develops a first-order linearisation of the incremental stress-strain response that isolates mechanical anisotropy from structural anisotropy using two independent orientation measures. The formulation enables both contributions to be quantified directly from macroscopic laboratory data. The method is applied to hollow-cylinder tests with systematically varied loading directions. Results show that both anisotropy components intensify as the stress state becomes more deviatoric; mechanical anisotropy is consistently stronger; and its relative dominance decreases with increasing deviatoric stress. Comparison with an isotropic hypoplastic model confirms that mechanically induced directional effects are captured even without fabric anisotropy. The framework offers a practical and physically transparent means for quantifying and comparing anisotropy mechanisms in granular materials.

Title: Periodic drive induced unconventional superconductivity in a half-filled system
Authors: Suryashekhar Kusari, Arti Garg
Abstract: The non-equilibrium control of electronic properties has emerged as a transformative paradigm for engineering novel quantum phases. The most intriguing example of such a phase is light-induced superconductivity (SC) in non-superconducting materials. However, realizing unconventional SC at commensurate half-filling remains a formidable challenge even in non-equilibrium, as the regime is typically dominated by the robust stability of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) Mott insulating (MI) state. Here, we provide a novel non-equilibrium route to realize unconventional d-wave SC in a half-filled system through Floquet engineering. We analyze the periodically driven Fermi-Hubbard model on a bipartite lattice and demonstrate that a high-frequency drive can transform a weakly interacting insulator into a regime of strong correlations by the drive-induced renormalization of nearest-neighbor hopping. Furthermore, the drive induces staggered higher range hoppings that can frustrate the AFM order while simultaneously generate staggered potential that lifts the kinetic constraints inherent to the half-filled system, fostering the charge dynamics required to stabilize d-wave pairing against the competing AFM state. The resulting SC phase is protected by high-frequency prethermalization, maintaining stability over timescales exponentially large in the drive frequency. This protocol circumvents the need for chemical doping, offering a 'disorder-free' alternative for realizing unconventional pairing with direct applications in optimizing the performance of superconducting quantum computers, qubit arrays and other upcoming quantum technologies.

Title: Three-dimensional Bose-Fermi droplets at nonzero temperatures
Authors: Maciej Lewkowicz, Mirosław Brewczyk, Mariusz Gajda, Tomasz Karpiuk
Abstract: Using numerical methods, we study the formation of self-bound quantum Bose-Fermi droplets at nonzero temperatures. We describe an attractive atomic Bose-Fermi mixture using quantum hydrodynamics enriched by beyond-mean-field corrections and thermal fluctuations, together with a simplified self-consistent Hartree-Fock model. With these models, we determine that low-temperature droplets with finite lifetimes can exist in free space when the attraction between bosons and fermions is sufficiently strong. Additionally, Bose-Fermi droplets at nonzero temperatures can exist in a box potential in equilibrium with bosonic and fermionic vapor. We discuss the properties of Bose-Fermi droplets at nonzero temperatures in terms of the initial condensate fraction, total atom number, and interspecies attraction strength.

Title: Automated structure discovery for Tip Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy
Authors: Harshit Sethi, Markus Junttila, Orlando J Silveira, Adam S Foster
Abstract: Tip-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (TERS) provides nanoscale chemical fingerprints alongside high-resolution topographic mapping of molecules, offering a powerful tool for materials discovery. However, TERS image datasets are challenging to interpret and typically demand time-consuming, computationally intensive quantum-chemistry calculations. To overcome this problem, we present an encoder-decoder model trained and evaluated on simulated TERS images of planar molecules, enabling direct prediction of molecular structures from spectral simulated data with high accuracy. Our approach demonstrates the feasibility of automating molecular structure identification from TERS images, bypassing traditional manual analysis. These findings provide a foundation for extending machine learning methods to experimental TERS datasets, potentially accelerating molecular discovery by integrating nanoscale spectroscopy with automated computational analysis.

Title: Anisotropic magnons in a layered honeycomb ferromagnet
Authors: Travis J. Williams, Douglas L. Abernathy, Mark D. Lumsden, Jiaqiang Yan, Andrew D. Christianson
Abstract: Recent experimental and theoretical studies have suggested a possible Dirac magnon gap in the two-dimensional ferromagnetic semiconductor CrSiTe$_3$. Detailed neutron scattering measurements were performed to shed light on the existence of the magnon gap, and suggest that the gap is very small or non-existent, with previous measurements being complicated by experimental factors. During these measurements, it was found that the out-of-plane couplings could explain the usual property of the increase in the magnetic transition temperature when CrSiTe$_3$ is exfoliated to monolayers. Furthermore, the material was shown to have anisotropic magnons along the out-of-plane direction, through the proposed Dirac point. We speculate that this is due to an exchange anisotropy, though Kitaev-like interactions alone cannot explain the spectra.

Abstract: Photoemission, from core levels and valence band, and low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) have been employed to investigate the electronic and structural properties of novel graphene-ferromagnetic (G-FM) systems,obtained by intercalation of one mono-layer (1ML) and several layers (4ML) of Co on G grown on Ir(111). Upon intercalation of 1ML of Co, the Co lattice is resized to match the Ir-Ir lattice parameter, resulting in a mismatched G/Co/Ir(111) system. The intercalation of further Co layers leads to a relaxation of the Co lattice and a progressive formation of a commensurate G layer lying on top. We show the C 1s line shape and the band structure of G in the two artificial phases, mismatched and commensurate G/Co, through a comparison with the electronic structure of G grown directly on a Co thick film. Our results show that while the G valence band mainly reflects the hybridization with the d states of Co, regardless of the structural phase, the C 1s line shape is very sensitive to the rumpling of the G layer and the coordination of carbon atoms with the underlying Co. Even in the commensurate (1x1) G/Co phase, where graphene is in register with the Co film, from the angular dependence of the C 1s core level we infer the presence of a double component, due to in-equivalent adsorption sites of carbon sub-lattices.

Title: Non Fermi liquid signatures across strain engineered metal-insulator transition in line-graph lattices
Authors: Shashikant Singh Kunwar, Madhuparna Karmakar
Abstract: Controlling the properties and thus the functionalities of correlated electron systems via externally tunable perturbations has always remained a cherished goal in quantum condensed matter physics. Recently, straintronics has proved to be one such external control which can dictate the quantum phases and transitions in materials via the reconstruction of their electronic band structure. A particularly intriguing scenario arises in the context of flat band line-graph lattices wherein straintronics is found to bring forth non trivial phase transitions. This paper reports the phase transitions and thermal scales across the Lieb/Kagome interconversion in the electronic interaction-strain-temperature space. Based on the thermodynamic, spectroscopic and transport signatures across the strain tuned interconversion of these line-graph lattices we have mapped out the low temperature phases and thermal transition scales, numerically determined using non perturbative calculations. While at the low temperatures, interaction-strain plane is spanned by magnetically correlated insulators, flat band induced weak transiently localized insulators and non Fermi liquid metallic phases, thermal fluctuations aid in to stabilize coexistent magnetic correlations. Apart from quantifying the magnetic transition scales in this system our results on the spectroscopic and transport signatures distill the strain tuned metal-insulator transition and crossover scales which exhibit variable transport scaling exponents.

Title: The interplay of cation/anion and monovalent/divalent selectivity in negatively charged nanopores: local charge inversion and anion leakage
Authors: Eszter Lakics, Mónika Valiskó, Dirk Gillespie, Dezső Boda
Abstract: The anomalous mole fraction effect (AMFE) is widely regarded as a hallmark of calcium versus monovalent ion selectivity in negatively charged pores. While AMFE is well understood in highly cation-selective narrow ion channels, its microscopic origin in wide synthetic nanopores, where anions may also contribute to transport, remains less clear. Here, we use a reduced Nernst-Planck + Local Equilibrium Monte Carlo framework to study ionic transport in a negatively charged PET nanopore, with particular emphasis on how the modeling of surface carboxyl (COO$^{-}$) groups influences charge inversion, ionic currents, and AMFE. We systematically compare fixed point-charge models and explicit-particle representations of surface oxygens and identify two controlling parameters: the distance of closest approach (DCA) between ionic charges and pore charges and grid spacing that modulates localization (while keeping average surface charge constant). By fitting pore diffusion coefficients to three experimental conductance points, we reproduce the entire experimental AMFE curve as well as anion leakage in CaCl$_2$ seen in experiments and molecular dynamics simulations. Remarkably, vastly different microscopic models of the surface groups yield indistinguishable device-level conductance curves when the DCA is matched, despite substantial differences in local Ca$^{2+}$ concentration profiles. Our results demonstrate that AMFE in wide nanopores is governed by a delicate interplay between charge inversion, anion leakage, and ionic mobility, underlying that in wide pores monovalent vs.\ divalent cation selectivity is modulated by cations vs.\ anion selecivity.

Title: Arc-length characterization of finite, radial growth patterns
Authors: Andreas A. Hennig, Ilaria Beechey-Newman, Natalya Kizilova, Erika Eiser
Abstract: We present a method to characterize the distribution of length-scales of finite, disordered patterns with, on average, radial symmetry. This method makes it possible to quantify the distribution of characteristic length scales in cases where the conventional "linear" chord method does not work. We show that the method can clearly distinguish regular patterns, patterns that are formed by diffusion-limited aggregation, and patterns that form during the slow drying of confined, colloid-laden droplets, explained by Beechey-Newman et al.1 We also introduce a method to find the centre-point of these finite patterns, without assuming a full connectivity in the pattern. The method should be widely applicable to other, finite quasi-two-dimensional patterns.

Title: Cr3+ spin dynamics under the octahedral crystal field in van der Waals antiferromagnets
Authors: Rabindra Basnet, Subhashree Chatterjee, Paul Kigaya, Ezana Negusse, J. van Tol, Ramesh C. Budhani
Abstract: The magnetic moment in van der Waals (vdW) materials containing 3d transition metals originates from unpaired d-electron spins and their interaction with surrounding ligands. The interplay between exchange interactions and magnetic anisotropy stabilizes long-range ordering of such moments. The compound CuCrP2S6 (CCPS) presents an interesting class of vdW solids where the coupling of Cr3+ moments and ordering of Cu1+ ions give rise to a multiferroic ground state. Here we investigate the spin dynamics of Cr3+ ions in CCPS through magnetization and broadband as well as single sub-THz magnetic resonance measurements. The orbital moment of Cr3+ is quenched under the octahedral crystal field of surrounding chalcogen ions, resulting in negligible magnetic anisotropy-a feature common to Cr-based vdW antiferromagnets (AFM). Resonance spectra over a wide frequency-field-temperature range reveal quasi-2D AFM dynamics governed mainly by isotropic Cr-Cr exchange interactions, which determine the magnetic order, spin reorientation, and damping. Sub-THz resonance spectra also uncover a field-induced ferromagnetic polarization, highlighting the universal role of Cr-Cr exchange in layered Cr compounds. Moreover, persistent magnetic correlations far above the Néel temperature (TN ~ 32 K) points to short-range magnetic order in CCPS and motivates future studies of a possible interplay between AFM and antiferroelectric orders. These results establish CCPS as an exemplary system for exploring 2D magnetism and electric-field-tunable spintronic functionalities in layered multiferroics.

Title: The effect of the A-site cation on the phase transition temperature of metal halide perovskites
Authors: Tom Braeckevelt, Sander Vandenhaute, Sven M. J. Rogge, Johan Hofkens, Veronique Van Speybroeck
Abstract: A key challenge for the practical application of metal halide perovskites (MHPs) is the instability of the desired perovskite phase relative to the optically non-active $\delta$ phase. To determine the phase stability, we previously developed a procedure to compute the harmonic free energy as a function of temperature, which was suited for CsPbI$_3$ but fails when Cs is replaced by organic cations due to their rotational freedom. Herein we propose a multistep thermodynamic integration (TI) approach that corrects the harmonic free energy to obtain the Gibbs free energy. Given the abundance of local minima in these materials, we employ replica exchange to prevent simulations from getting trapped, while introducing an intermediate potential energy surface to improve convergence and reduce computational cost. Benchmarking energy and forces from different exchange-correlation functionals and dispersion methods against high-level RPA+HF calculations identifies PBE+D3(BJ) as the best trade-off between accuracy, computational efficiency, and precision. To perform molecular dynamics simulations within the TI framework, it was necessary to train a machine learning potential using the MACE architecture on ab initio data calculated with density functional theory. Our results show that, for all three materials, the free energy difference between the $\gamma$ and $\delta$ phases exhibits a very similar temperature dependence. This suggests that phase stability is primarily governed by differences in ground-state energy, rather than by material-specific thermal effects. Beyond these three materials, our methodology provides a robust framework for investigating the phase behavior of other MHPs, paving the way for the discovery of more stable perovskites.

Title: Coexisting magnetic, charge, and superconducting orders in the two-dimensional Hubbard model
Authors: Robin Scholle, Pietro M. Bonetti, Walter Metzner, Demetrio Vilardi
Abstract: We perform a renormalized mean-field study of the two-dimensional repulsive Hubbard model, focusing on the intricate interplay and possible coexistence of magnetic, charge, and superconducting orders. We improve on conventional mean-field theory by utilizing a renormalization group framework that captures high-energy fluctuations. This method generates effective magnetic and $d$-wave pairing interactions, and allows for an unbiased exploration of coexisting phases at weak and moderate interaction strengths. Unrestricted mean-field calculations of the effective Hamiltonian on large finite lattices are combined with analyses in the thermodynamic limit, revealing a rich phase diagram with extensive regions of coexisting orders. We find that $d$-wave superconductivity coexists with Néel order on the electron-doped side. On the hole-doped side, superconductivity is found to coexist with spiral or stripe magnetic orders. Within the stripe ordered region, the superconducting order parameter is spatially modulated, with a period that follows the charge modulation of the stripes. Below van Hove filling, pairing provides the primary energy gain, while the stripe order yields only a small, and hence fragile, additional energy lowering.

Title: Chemotaxis of cell aggregates: morphology and dynamics of migrating active droplets
Authors: Giulia L. Celora, Benjamin J. Walker, Mohit P. Dalwadi, Philip Pearce
Abstract: Biological tissues have been observed to display emergent fluid-like properties, owing to physical interactions between cells. However, it remains unclear in general how these fluid-like properties affect tissue structure and function. Here, we are motivated by recent experiments in which cell aggregates were observed to behave as active droplets during collective migration along chemical gradients, or chemotaxis. To understand this process, we develop a minimal model of a growing thin active droplet driven by a self-generated chemical gradient. In broad agreement with the experiments, dynamic simulations reveal that chemotacting droplets exhibit proliferation-driven morphological transitions. To fully characterise these transitions, we perform a multiple scales analysis to show that the droplet dynamics follow a sequence of travelling wave solutions defined by a nonlinear eigenvalue problem parametrised by the slowly increasing droplet volume. Our analysis reveals that morphological transitions can occur continuously or through a discontinuous bifurcation. Further asymptotic analysis of the travelling wave problem reveals that these morphological transitions arise from exponentially small ("beyond-all-orders") asymptotic terms that originate from the rear and front contact lines. Moreover, we show that the nature of the transitions is fully determined by two key dimensionless parameters, which quantify the internal stress balance within the droplet and the strength of the coupling between the droplet migration dynamics and the external chemical field. Overall, our results provide a complete characterisation of the morphodynamics of a class of migrating active thin droplets, with implications in a range of biological systems where cell aggregates exhibit fluid-like behaviour.

Title: Energy gap of quantum spin glasses: a projection quantum Monte Carlo study
Authors: L. Brodoloni, G. E. Astrakharchik, S. Giorgini, S. Pilati
Abstract: The performance of quantum annealing for combinatorial optimization is fundamentally limited by the minimum energy gap $\Delta$ encountered at quantum phase transitions. We investigate the scaling of $\Delta$ with system size $N$ for two paradigmatic quantum spin-glass models: the two-dimensional Edwards-Anderson (2D-EA) and the all-to-all Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) models. Utilizing a newly proposed unbiased energy-gap estimator for continuous-time projection quantum Monte Carlo simulations, complemented by high-performance sparse eigenvalue solvers, we characterize the gap distributions across disorder realizations. It is found that, in the 2D-EA case, the inverse-gap distribution develops a fat tail with infinite variance as $N$ increases. This indicates that the unfavorable super-algebraic scaling of $\Delta$, recently reported for binary couplings [Nature 631, 749 (2024)], persists for the Gaussian disorder considered here, pointing to a universal feature of 2D spin glasses. Conversely, the SK model retains a finite-variance distribution, with the disorder-averaged gap following a rather slow power law, close to $\Delta \propto N^{-1/3}$. This finding provides a promising outlook for the potential efficiency of quantum annealers for optimization problems with dense connectivity.

Title: Tunable dislocations overcome mechano-functional tradeoff in perovskite oxides
Authors: Jiawen Zhang, Wenjun Lu, Xufei Fang
Abstract: Recent advancements in dislocation engineering are reshaping the traditional view towards ceramics being brittle. Here, we use KTaO3 (KTO), a perovskite oxide that is newly discovered with room-temperature bulk plasticity, and demonstrate that the seeded dislocations can effectively tune both mechanical and functional properties. We uncover a novel brittle-ductile-brittle (BDB) transition: low dislocation densities lead to brittle failure, intermediate densities (~10*14 m-2) enable superior ductility with strains over 20%, and high dislocation densities (~10*15 m-2) induce again brittle fracture. This dislocation density-dependent non-monotonic mechanical response challenges the traditional behavior of ceramics and offers new design opportunities. Furthermore, dislocation densities can monotonically decrease thermal conductivity, revealing a tradeoff between mechanical strength and functionality. The findings reveal a critical threshold of dislocation density in optimizing the performance of functional oxides, and provide a new framework for using dislocations to design advanced materials where mechanical durability and enhanced functionality are intertwined.

Title: Microstructural Evolution and Crystallization Behavior of Amorphous Medium-Entropy Ti-Nb-Zr-Ag Thin Films
Authors: Anna Benediktová, Lucie Nedvědová, Michal Procházka, Zdeněk Jansa, Štěpánka Jansová, Christopher D. Woodgate, David Redka, Julie B. Staunton, Ján Minár
Abstract: Improving the performance of metallic implants increasingly relies on the development of multifunctional surface modifications that combine structural stability, bioactivity, and prevention of bacterial colonization. Medium-entropy alloys (MEAs) represent a promising approach for such coatings, as their chemical complexity allows the formation of structurally stable matrices with tunable properties. In this study, Ti-Nb-Zr and Ti-Nb-Zr-Ag thin films were deposited by magnetron sputtering and subjected to annealing at temperatures of up to 1100 $^{\circ}$C to evaluate the influence of Ag, added for its antibacterial potential, on structural evolution. The as-deposited Ag-free film was fully amorphous, whereas the Ag-containing film exhibited a predominantly amorphous matrix with finely dispersed crystalline nanoparticles, indicating that Ag promoted early-stage crystallization. Both films displayed a fine columnar morphology (column diameter $\sim$15 nm) with dome-like protrusions, a hierarchical surface structure favorable for protein adhesion. Upon annealing, the Ag-free film recrystallized into a granular, loosely packed morphology, while the Ag-containing film retained a compact structure, demonstrating the stabilizing role of Ag. These findings underscore the potential of Ag-containing amorphous MEAs for forming multifunctional coatings with enhanced thermal stability, antibacterial functionality, and biointerface-relevant surface features for advanced biomedical applications.

Title: Role of octahedral tilting induced acoustic softening on limiting thermal transport in SrSnO3
Authors: Yuzhou Hao, Turab Lookman, Xiangdong Ding, Jun Sun, Zhibin Gao
Abstract: Octahedral tilting is a fundamental structural distortion in perovskites, governing key phenomena such as lattice stabilizing, soft phonon dynamics, group-theoretical analysis, phase transitions, ferroelectricity, and even for tunable electronic band gap. However, its influence on lattice thermal conductivity (kL) remains poorly understood. In the archetypal perovskite SrTiO3, tilting in the low-temperature tetragonal phase is known to enhance kL by suppressing specific phonon scattering channels around 200 cm-1. Here, we investigate the thermal transport in strontium stannate (SrSnO3), another perovskite oxide that undergoes temperature-driven phase transitions, and reveal a completely opposite effect. Through a systematic study across its orthorhombic, tetragonal, and cubic phases, we demonstrate that octahedral tilting in the tetragonal phase of SrSnO3 anomalously triggers acoustic phonon softening. This softening manifests as reduced frequencies and group velocities in low-frequency (<3 THz) acoustic modes, creating a large decrease for heat transport, particularly along the c-axis. Consequently, kL is significantly suppressed, decreasing from 7.48 W m-1 K-1 to 6.06 W m-1 K-1 as the tilting angle increases by a mere 1 degree. These findings identify tilting-induced acoustic softening as a pivotal mechanism for limiting and controlling anisotropic thermal transport in SrSnO3, presenting a stark contrast to the established behavior in SrTiO3.

Title: Vortex Tunneling and Critical State in an Oxide Heterostructure
Authors: Jordan T. McCourt, Ryan Henderson, John Chiles, Chun-Chia Chen, Shama, Divine Kumah, Vadim Geshkenbein, Gleb Finkelstein
Abstract: Two-dimensional superconductors offer an excellent platform for the study of vortex matter due to their low superfluid stiffness and inability to effectively screen applied magnetic fields. Here we explore vortices in a two-dimensional superconductor formed at the surface of the complex oxide KTaO$_3$. Multiple regimes of vortex-mediated transport are identified and studied, revealing switching behaviour attributed to nucleation of individual vortices. Analysis of this regime allows us to identify the quantum tunneling of vortices, which transitions to thermally activated behaviour at elevated temperatures. Magnetic field dependence reveals rich histograms of the switching currents which we attribute to different configurations of pinned vortices.

Abstract: Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have attracted significant attention owing to their simple manufacturing process and unique optoelectronic properties. Their reversible electrical or optical properties changes in response to oxidizing or reducing environments make them prospective materials for gas detection technologies. Despite advancements in perovskite-based sensor research, the mechanisms behind perovskite-gas interactions, vital for sensor performance, are still unexclusive. This work presents the first evaluation of the sensing performance and long-term stability of MHPs, considering factors such as halide composition variation and Mn doping levels. The research reveals a clear correlation between halide composition and sensing behavior, with Br-rich sensors displaying a p-type response to O3 gas, while Cl-based counterparts exhibit an n-type sensing behavior. Notably, Mn-doping significantly enhances the O3 sensing performance by facilitating the gas adsorption process, as supported by both atomistic simulations and experimental evidence. Long-term evaluation of the sensors provides valuable insights into evolving sensing behaviors, highlighting the impact of dynamic instabilities over time. Overall, this research offers insights into optimal halide combination and Mn-doping levels, representing a significant step forward in engineering room temperature perovskite-based gas sensors that are not only low-cost and high-performing but also durable, marking a new era in sensor technology.

Title: Boltzmann Generators for Condensed Matter via Riemannian Flow Matching
Authors: Emil Hoffmann, Maximilian Schebek, Leon Klein, Frank Noé, Jutta Rogal
Abstract: Sampling equilibrium distributions is fundamental to statistical mechanics. While flow matching has emerged as scalable state-of-the-art paradigm for generative modeling, its potential for equilibrium sampling in condensed-phase systems remains largely unexplored. We address this by incorporating the periodicity inherent to these systems into continuous normalizing flows using Riemannian flow matching. The high computational cost of exact density estimation intrinsic to continuous normalizing flows is mitigated by using Hutchinson's trace estimator, utilizing a crucial bias-correction step based on cumulant expansion to render the stochastic estimates suitable for rigorous thermodynamic reweighting. Our approach is validated on monatomic ice, demonstrating the ability to train on systems of unprecedented size and obtain highly accurate free energy estimates without the need for traditional multistage estimators.

Title: Controlling emergent dynamical behavior via phase-engineered strong symmetries
Authors: Marc Nairn, Beatriz Olmos, Parvinder Solanki
Abstract: Symmetry constraints provide a powerful means to control the dynamics of open quantum systems. However, the set of accessible control parameters is often limited. Here, we show that a tunable phase in the collective light-matter coupling of a cavity QED system induces a phase-dependent strong symmetry of the Liouvillian, enabling dynamical control of the open quantum system evolution. We demonstrate that tuning this phase substantially reduces the critical driving strength for dissipative phase transitions between stationary and non-stationary phases. We illustrate this mechanism in two experimentally relevant cavity QED settings: a two-species ensemble of two-level atoms and a single-species ensemble of three-level atoms. Our results establish phase control as a versatile tool for engineering dissipative phase transitions, with implications for quantum state preparation.

Title: Learning Beyond Optimization: Stress-Gated Dynamical Regime Regulation in Autonomous Systems
Authors: Sheng Ran
Abstract: Despite their apparent diversity, modern machine learning methods can be reduced to a remarkably simple core principle: learning is achieved by continuously optimizing parameters to minimize or maximize a scalar objective function. This paradigm has been extraordinarily successful for well-defined tasks where goals are fixed and evaluation criteria are explicit. However, if artificial systems are to move toward true autonomy-operating over long horizons and across evolving contexts-objectives may become ill-defined, shifting, or entirely absent. In such settings, a fundamental question emerges: in the absence of an explicit objective function, how can a system determine whether its ongoing internal dynamics are productive or pathological? And how should it regulate structural change without external supervision? In this work, we propose a dynamical framework for learning without an explicit objective. Instead of minimizing external error signals, the system evaluates the intrinsic health of its own internal dynamics and regulates structural plasticity accordingly. We introduce a two-timescale architecture that separates fast state evolution from slow structural adaptation, coupled through an internally generated stress variable that accumulates evidence of persistent dynamical dysfunction. Structural modification is then triggered not continuously, but as a state-dependent event. Through a minimal toy model, we demonstrate that this stress-regulated mechanism produces temporally segmented, self-organized learning episodes without reliance on externally defined goals. Our results suggest a possible route toward autonomous learning systems capable of self-assessment and internally regulated structural reorganization.

Title: Acoustic Manipulation of Tangible Janus Icons on Liquid Droplets
Authors: Yusuke Koroyasu, Yoichi Ochiai, Tatsuki Fushimi
Abstract: Interfaces that couple digital information with physical matter enable computation to be expressed through tangible motion and touch, yet typically rely on embedded actuators, rigid mechanisms, or enclosed environments. Consequently, contactless manipulation and interaction with centimeter-scale tangible elements in open settings remain difficult to achieve. Here, we present PolygonWave, a solid--fluid acoustic interface that enables transport and tangible interaction by coupling airborne ultrasound with liquid-mediated support. The system employs lightweight Janus icons with asymmetric wettability: a superhydrophobic upper surface permits dry touch interaction, while a hydrophilic lower surface couples to a water droplet resting on a superhydrophobic mesh. Focused acoustic fields generated by a 256-element phased array induce lateral forces, enabling programmable motion without mechanical contact. Systematic characterization demonstrates transport of payloads up to 525 mg across variations in icon size, droplet volume, and applied load. Beyond translation, the liquid layer functions as a reconfigurable mechanical element, enabling button-like input with self-recovery and resonance-driven vibro-visual feedback, exhibiting a peak response near 22 Hz for 200 \textmu L droplets. Liquid-mediated acoustic coupling provides a unified mechanism for mechanically expressive, touch-accessible tangible interfaces bridging acoustics, soft matter physics, and physical human--computer interaction.

Title: Convex Analysis of Relaxation Dynamics in Chemical Reaction Networks and Generalized Gradient Flows
Authors: Keisuke Sugie, Dimitri Loutchko, Tetsuya J. Kobayashi
Abstract: We obtain bounds on the Kullback--Leibler divergence to equilibrium for mass-action chemical reaction networks (CRNs) with equilibrium. The associated decay rates are characterized in terms of the singular values of the stoichiometric matrix, convexity parameters, and time-integrated activities via deformed-exponential-type functions. We further extend these bounds within a generalized gradient flow framework. We highlight the biological relevance of this framework: the resulting bounds apply to quasi-steady-state regimes, where long transients and plateau-like behavior are common and functionally important. We illustrate the framework using a catalytic CRN exhibiting plateaus, where the bounds capture slow relaxation induced by local convexity and provide a bound-based approach to quantifying relaxation in CRNs.

Title: Predicting Magic from Very Few Measurements
Authors: J. M. Varela, L. L. Keller, A. de Oliveira Junior, D. A. Moreira, R. Chaves, R. A. Macêdo
Abstract: The nonstabilizerness of quantum states is a necessary resource for universal quantum computation, yet its characterization is notoriously demanding. Quantifying nonstabilizerness typically requires an exponential number of measurements and a doubly exponential classical post-processing cost to evaluate its standard monotones. In this work, we show that nonstabilizerness is, to a large extent, in the eyes of the beholder: it can be witnessed and quantified using any set of $m$ $n$-qubit Pauli measurements, provided the set contains anti-commuting pairs. We introduce a general framework that projects the stabilizer polytope onto the subspace defined by these observables and provide an algorithm that estimates magic from Pauli expectation values with runtime exponential in the number of measurements $m$ and polynomial in the number of qubits $n$. By relating the problem to a stabilizer-restricted variant of the quantum marginal problem, we also prove that deciding membership in the corresponding reduced stabilizer polytope is NP-hard. In particular, unless $\mathrm{P} = \mathrm{NP}$, no algorithm polynomial in $m$ can solve the problem in full generality, thus establishing fundamental complexity-theoretic limitations. Finally, we employ our framework to compute nonstabilizerness in different Hamiltonian ground states, demonstrating the practical performance of our method in regimes beyond the reach of existing techniques.

Title: Some effective operators for graphene monolayer superlattices, from variational perturbation theory
Authors: Louis Garrigue
Abstract: Our goal is to provide precise effective operators for monolayer graphene at Fermi energy. We consider the microscopic potential created by a lattice, and add a macroscopic potential with the same periodicity but varying at a scale $\varepsilon^{-1} \in \mathbb{N}$, creating a superlattice. Our approach consists in coupling the variational approximation, perturbation theory together with a multiscale method. At the effective level the usual massless Dirac operator is replaced by other operators, and we provide simulations in the case of graphene.

Title: Artificial Neural Network (ANN) -- Oscillatory Neural Network (ONN) Hybrid System Using Domain-Wall Synapse Devices and Nano-Constriction Spin Hall Nano Oscillators
Authors: Raman Hissariya, Gajjala Venkata Sreekar Reddy, Ashwin Tulapurkar, Debanjan Bhowmik
Abstract: A coupled spintronic oscillator array has been considered attractive for neuromorphic computing applications. Experimental reports have shown the nano-constriction geometry to be a relatively easier-to-fabricate platform for implementing such spin oscillators, but most prior reports on training and inference algorithms for neuromorphic computing using spin oscillators have been mostly restricted to the nano-pillar geometry. Also, those prior reports involve updating the natural frequency values of the oscillators and moving the synchronization regions on to the data clusters during the offline learning phase, which has associated challenges. In this context, we design and simulate a novel artificial neural network (ANN) - oscillator neural network (ONN) algorithm where in the offline learning phase, the weight parameters of the ANN are updated such that the data clusters are instead moved to the synchronization regions of spin Hall nano oscillators (SHNOs) in the nano-constriction geometry, as obtained through micromagnetic simulations. We further simulate the on-chip inference part of the ANN-ONN algorithm where the ANN is implemented on a crossbar array of domain-wall synapse devices, as simulated here through micromagnetics, and the ONN is implemented on nano-constriction SHNOs. We show successful data classification for both binary and multi-class classification tasks to demonstrate the generalizability of our proposed scheme.

Title: Entanglement dynamics of many-body quantum states: sensitivity to system conditions and a hidden universality
Authors: Devanshu Shekhar, Pragya Shukla
Abstract: We consider physical Hamiltonians that can be represented by the multiparametric Gaussian ensembles, theoretically derive the state ensembles for its eigenstates and analyze the effect of varying system conditions on its bipartite entanglement entropy. Our approach leads to a single parametric based common mathematical formulation for the evolution of the entanglement statistics of different states of a given Hamiltonian or different Hamiltonians subjected to same symmetry constraints. The parameter turns out to be a single functional of the system parameters and thereby reveals a deep web of connection hidden underneath different quantum states.

Title: Self-correction phase transition in the dissipative toric code
Authors: Sanjeev Kumar, Hendrik Weimer
Abstract: We analyze a time-continuous version of a cellular automaton decoder for the toric code in the form of a Lindblad master equation. In this setting, a self-correcting quantum memory becomes a thermodynamical phase of the steady state, which manifests itself through the steady state being topologically ordered. We compute the steady state phase diagram, finding a competition between the error correction rate and the update rate for the classical field of the cellular automaton. Strikingly, we find that self-correction of errors is possible even in situations where conventional quantum error correction does not have a finite threshold.

Title: Squirmers with arbitrary shape and slip: modeling, simulation, and optimization
Authors: Kausik Das, Hai Zhu, Marc Bonnet, Shravan Veerapaneni
Abstract: We consider arbitrary-shaped microswimmers of spherical topology and propose a framework for expressing their slip velocity in terms of tangential basis functions defined on the boundary of the swimmer using the Helmholtz decomposition. Given a time-independent slip velocity profile, we show that the trajectory followed by the microswimmer is a circular helix. We derive analytical expressions for the translational and rotational velocities of a prolate spheroid swimmer in terms of its Helmholtz decomposition modes and explore the effect of aspect ratio on these rigid body velocities. Then, for a given arbitrary swimmer shape of spherical topology, we investigate which slip profile minimizes the total power loss. A partial minimization is performed in which the direction of net motion of the swimmer is prescribed, followed by a global optimization procedure in which the best net motion direction is determined. The optimization results suggest that the competition between linear and rotational optimal motion is linked to symmetries in the shape of the microswimmer.

Title: Emergence of opinion splits in the Sznajd model with latency
Authors: Ryan W. Salatti, André M. Timpanaro
Abstract: In the modelling of social systems, opinion latency is the idea that once an agent changes its opinion, there will be a period of time where it is immune to other changes. When added to the voter model this leads to a situation where no matter how low the latency is or how many opinions are considered, all opinions end up in a coexistence where they are equally represented. In this work, we examine what happens when latency is added to the Sznajd model. What we find is that for low latency, the model behaves roughly like it does in the absence of latency, where one opinion will always eventually dominate. For high latency, the possibility for a symmetric coexistence of 2 opinions arises, but contrary to the voter model, a coexistence of more than 2 opinions is never stable. We provide evidence of this phenomenon with computer simulations of the model in Barabási-Albert networks, together with a mean field treatment that is able to capture the observed behavior. We argue that this could hint at an explanation for the prevalence of two opinion splits in the real world.

Title: Calderbank-Shor-Steane codes on group-valued qudits
Authors: Ben T. McDonough, Jian-Hao Zhang, Victor V. Albert, Andrew Lucas
Abstract: Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes are a versatile quantum error-correcting family built out of commuting $X$- and $Z$-type checks. We introduce CSS-like codes on $G$-valued qudits for any finite group $G$ that reduce to qubit CSS codes for $G = \mathbb{Z}_2$ yet generalize the Kitaev quantum double model for general groups. The $X$-checks of our group-CSS codes correspond to left and/or right multiplication by group elements, while $Z$-checks project onto solutions to group word equations. We describe quantum-double models on oriented two-dimensional CW complexes (which need not cellulate a manifold) and prove that, when $G$ is non-Abelian and simple, every $G$-covariant group-CSS code with suitably upper-bounded $Z$-check weight and lower-bounded $Z$-distance reduces to a CW quantum double. We describe the codespace and logical operators of CW quantum doubles via the same intuition used to obtain logical structure of surface codes. We obtain distance bounds for codes on non-Abelian simple groups from the graph underlying the CW complex, and construct intrinsically non-Abelian code families with asymptotically optimal rate and distances. Adding "ghost vertices" to the CW complex generalizes quantum double models with defects and rough boundary conditions whose logical structure can be understood without reference to non-Abelian anyons or defects. Several non-invertible symmetry-protected topological states, both with ordinary and higher-form symmetries, are the unique codewords of simply-connected CW quantum doubles with a single ghost vertex.

Title: Profiling THz Beams With Off-Label Use of Infrared Microbolometric Cameras
Authors: Gabriel Nagamine, Carlo Vicario, Tariq Leinen, Guy Matmon, Adrian L. Cavalieri, Flavio Giorgianni
Abstract: Visualizing the spatial profile of light beams is essential for evaluating irradiance, characterizing beam quality, and achieving precise alignment. In the optical spectral range, this is readily performed using silicon-based CCD and CMOS cameras. In the terahertz (THz) range, however, it typically requires specialized detectors with prohibitive costs. Here, we show that an infrared (IR) camera can be used outside of its labeled specifications to achieve similar performance as a dedicated microbolometric THz camera, at under 1% of the THz camera's cost. We compared the cameras by characterizing THz beam profiles from two sources: a pulsed broadband THz beam produced through optical rectification in organic crystals, and a narrowband quasi-continuous-wave (quasi-CW) THz beam emitted by a quantum cascade laser. For the broadband THz radiation, the beam width measured by the two cameras differed by only ~ 6%, well within the pixel resolution limit, and in the narrowband quasi-CW case by just ~ 1.3%. Additionally, both cameras show linear responsivity over a comparable irradiance range. These results expand the applicability of conventional IR cameras to the THz range, suggesting that they will become routine tools for high-fidelity THz beam diagnostics and imaging in scientific and industrial applications.

Title: Differentiable Maximum Likelihood Noise Estimation for Quantum Error Correction
Authors: Hanyan Cao, Dongyang Feng, Cheng Ye, Feng Pan
Abstract: Accurate noise estimation is essential for fault-tolerant quantum computing, as decoding performance depends critically on the fidelity of the circuit-level noise parameters. In this work, we introduce a differentiable Maximum Likelihood Estimation (dMLE) framework that enables exact, efficient, and fully differentiable computation of syndrome log-likelihoods, allowing circuit-level noise parameters to be optimized directly via gradient descent. Leveraging the exact Planar solver for repetition codes and a novel, simplified Tensor Network (TN) architecture combined with optimized contraction path finding for surface codes, our method achieves tractable and fully differentiable likelihood evaluation even for distance 5 surface codes with up to 25 rounds. Our method recovers the underlying error probabilities with near-exact precision in simulations and reduces logical error rates by up to 30.6(3)% for repetition codes and 8.1(2)% for surface codes on experimental data from Google's processor compared to previous state-of-the-art methods: correlation analysis and Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods. Our approach yields provably optimal, decoder-independent error priors by directly maximizing the syndrome likelihood, offering a powerful noise estimation and control tool for unlocking the full potential of current and future error-corrected quantum processors.

Title: Krylov Distribution and Universal Convergence of Quantum Fisher Information
Authors: Mohsen Alishahiha, Fatemeh Tarighi Tabesh, Mohammad Javad Vasli
Abstract: We develop a spectral-resolvent framework for computing the quantum Fisher information (QFI) using Krylov subspace methods, extending the notion of the Krylov distribution. By expressing the QFI as a resolvent moment of the superoperator $\mathcal{K}_\rho$ associated with a density matrix, the Krylov distribution quantifies how the QFI weight is distributed across Krylov levels in operator space and provides a natural measure for controlling the truncation error in Krylov approximations. Leveraging orthogonal polynomial theory, we identify two universal convergence regimes: exponential decay when the Liouville-space spectrum is gapped away from zero, and algebraic decay governed by hard-edge (Bessel) universality when small eigenvalues accumulate near zero. This framework establishes a direct connection between quantum metrology, spectral geometry, and Krylov dynamics, offering both conceptual insight and practical tools for efficient QFI computation in high-dimensional and many-body systems.

Title: Exact Discrete Stochastic Simulation with Deep-Learning-Scale Gradient Optimization
Authors: Jose M. G. Vilar, Leonor Saiz
Abstract: Exact stochastic simulation of continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs) is essential when discreteness and noise drive system behavior, but the hard categorical event selection in Gillespie-type algorithms blocks gradient-based learning. We eliminate this constraint by decoupling forward simulation from backward differentiation, with hard categorical sampling generating exact trajectories and gradients propagating through a continuous massively-parallel Gumbel-Softmax straight-through surrogate. Our approach enables accurate optimization at parameter scales over four orders of magnitude beyond existing simulators. We validate for accuracy, scalability, and reliability on a reversible dimerization model (0.09% error), a genetic oscillator (1.2% error), a 203,796-parameter gene regulatory network achieving 98.4% MNIST accuracy (a prototypical deep-learning multilayer perceptron benchmark), and experimental patch-clamp recordings of ion channel gating (R^2 = 0.987) in the single-channel regime. Our GPU implementation delivers 1.9 billion steps per second, matching the scale of non-differentiable simulators. By making exact stochastic simulation massively parallel and autodiff-compatible, our results enable high-dimensional parameter inference and inverse design across systems biology, chemical kinetics, physics, and related CTMC-governed domains.

Title: High-resolution spectroscopy of 162Dy Rydberg levels
Authors: G. Ferioli, P. Lombardi, P. Sekhar, E. Sole Cardona, N. Preti, C. Drevon, N. Antolini, L. Tanzi, G. Modugno, C. Gabbanini, F. Robicheaux, A. Fioretti
Abstract: Highly excited Rydberg states of lanthanides are a promising, yet largely unexplored, playground for quantum studies. Here, we report on the first high-resolution spectroscopy of 162Dy obtained by two-color trap depletion spectroscopy in a magneto-optical trap. The absolute excitation frequency of over 700 states with effective principal quantum number n between 21 and 130 is measured with an accuracy of 20 MHz. Most states are assigned to the 8 different series converging to the first 4f10(5I8)6s(2S1/2) J = 17/2 ionization potential. This energy is measured at EIP = 47901.8265 +/- 0.0008 cm-1, improving the precision of the literature value by over an order of magnitude. A multichannel quantum defect theory approach is used to benchmark and refine the assignments and to characterize six observed perturbing states belonging to higher ionization limits. These results pave the way for using dysprosium in Rydberg-based quantum architectures, leveraging the unique properties arising from its complex electronic structure. They also represent a compelling benchmark for ab-initio calculations of open-shell atomic systems.

Title: Rapid state-resolved single-atom imaging of alkaline-earth fermions
Authors: Thies Plassmann, Leon Schaefer, Meny Menashes, Guillaume Salomon
Abstract: Local Hilbert spaces with large dimension are of key interest for quantum information with applications in quantum computing and memories, quantum simulations and metrology. Thanks to its weak coupling to external perturbations, the large ground-state nuclear spin manifold of fermionic alkaline-earth atoms is an exciting resource to explore for quantum information. Simultaneous single atom and state-resolved detection however remains an outstanding challenge limiting the development of novel quantum computing and simulation schemes beyond qubits. Here, we report on a new imaging technique enabling the simultaneous detection of up to four quantum states encoded in the nuclear spin manifold of a single fermionic strontium atom within 100 microseconds, with state-resolved detection fidelities ranging from 0.936 to 0.997. This technique is further used to track the highly coherent nuclear spin dynamics after a quench highlighting the potential of this system for quantum information. These results offer fascinating perspectives for quantum science with multi-electron atoms ranging from qudit-based quantum computing to quantum simulations of the SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard model.

Title: A Physics-Regularized Neural Network and Kirchhoff Markov Random Field Framework for Inferring Internal Electrochemical States from Operando Spectromicroscopy
Authors: Naoki Wada, Yuta Kimura, Masaichiro Mizumaki, Koji Amezawa, Ichiro Akai, Toru Aonishi
Abstract: Quantitative understanding of coupled reaction and transport processes in lithium-ion battery (LIB) composite electrodes remains challenging because key internal states cannot be measured directly. In this study, we develop a physics-integrated, data-driven analysis pipeline to estimate internal electrochemical states from operando microscopic X-ray absorption fine structure ($\mu$-XAFS) hyperspectral data of LIB cathodes with LiPF$_6$ electrolyte. State-of-charge (SOC) maps are first constructed from Co K-edge spectra. To resolve ambiguities in the two-phase reaction region, a physics-regularized three-layer neural network is introduced, enforcing spatial continuity of SOC and current conservation. The inferred SOC dynamics are then incorporated into a Kirchhoff-based Markov random field framework that integrates Kirchhoff's current and voltage laws, Ohm's law, and a symmetric Butler-Volmer relation to estimate interfacial current, ionic current, electrolyte potential, and effective ionic conductivity. Application to composite electrodes with different initial electrolyte concentrations (0.3, 1, and 2M LiPF$_6$) reveals distinct reaction propagation behaviors governed by electrolyte concentration-dependent conductivity. The inferred electrolyte concentration distributions show qualitative agreement with independent operando X-ray transmission imaging performed on LIB composite cathodes employing a LiAsF$_6$ electrolyte. This framework enables quantitative visualization of otherwise inaccessible internal transport phenomena.

Title: Dielectric response in proteins: The proteotronics approach
Authors: E.Alfinito, M. Beccaria
Abstract: The dielectric properties of proteins, particularly in their hydrated state, have been extensively studied. Numerous theoretical and experimental investigations have reported values of both the permittivity and the intrinsic dipole moments of specific proteins under well-defined hydration conditions. Since even approximate estimates of these properties are relevant from both fundamental and applied perspectives, we propose a user-friendly method to calculate the relative permittivity that can be readily integrated into proteotronics workflows. To validate the proposed approach, we compare the results with those obtained using a classical macroscopic method. The outcomes are consistent and contribute further insight into this long-debated issue.

Title: Heat flow through the quantum heat valve coupled to ohmic baths via a master equation approach
Authors: Antti Vaaranta, Marco Cattaneo, Paolo Muratore-Ginanneschi, Jukka Pekola
Abstract: We provide a theoretical model for the non-equilibrium steady state heat flow through a quantum heat valve. The model is based on a master equation approach, where the partial secular approximation has been carefully performed in order to obtain accurate results. Our study assumes an ohmic spectral density for the two thermal baths of the model. This is in contrast with previous treatments of the quantum heat valve, where the baths have been assumed as being structured with a peaked spectral density near the resonance frequency of the resonator. These studies have also taken the resonator to be a part of the open quantum system of interest, which results in double counting of the resonator, as the latter appears both in the spectral density of the bath and as a part of the open system. Although this model accounts for the observations in a satisfactory way, it raises issues regarding its physical interpretation. Our method solves this conceptual problem. We apply it to describe an experiment on a quantum heat valve, showing that it successfully captures the experimental results and improves upon the previous theoretical model, which suffered from the resonator double-counting issue. Our findings confirm that the careful application of the master equation approach, in particular when it comes to the secular approximation, is a useful tool for explaining realistic experimental setups.

Title: Entanglement formation in two-dimensional materials within microcavity
Authors: Fabricio Danel Matias, Facundo Arreyes, Juan Sebastián Ardenghi
Abstract: In this work, the entanglement generation between two hexagonal-lattice layers embedded in a microcavity is studied, accounting for both electromagnetic coupling and intrinsic spin-orbit interaction (SOI). Utilizing a short-time dynamical approach, we perform a perturbative Taylor expansion of the reduced density matrix to characterize the bipartite quantum correlations between the hexagonal layers. We demonstrate that the system undergoes a rapid transition from a localized product state in the conduction bands at t = 0 to a coherent superposition of valence and conduction band states. Our results indicate that the degree of entanglement is highly sensitive to the interlayer photon propagator, which contains the geometric ratios of the layer positions and the height cavity, and the specific Fermi energy and SOI signatures of the respective layers. We show the emergence of spacelike-separated quantum correlations in the ultra-short evolution regime, suggesting that heterostructures in cavities may be suitable to develop experiments for a deep understanding of spacelike-separated quantum effects.

Title: Generalized $\mathbb{Z}_p$ toric codes as qudit low-density parity-check codes
Authors: Zijian Liang, Yu-An Chen
Abstract: We study two-dimensional translation-invariant CSS stabilizer codes over prime-dimensional qudits on the square lattice under twisted boundary conditions, generalizing the Kitaev $\mathbb{Z}_p$ toric code by augmenting each stabilizer with two additional qudits. Using the Laurent-polynomial formalism, we adapt the Gröbner basis to compute the logical dimension $k$ efficiently, without explicitly constructing large parity-check matrices. We then perform a systematic search over various stabilizer realizations and lattice geometries for $p\in\{3,5,7,11\}$, identifying qudit low-density parity-check codes with the optimal finite-size performance. Representative examples include $[[242,10,22]]_3$ and $[[120,6,20]]_{11}$, both achieving $k d^{2}/n=20$. Across the searched regime, the best observed $k d^{2}$ at fixed $n$ increases with $p$, with an empirical relation $k d^{2} = 0.0541 \, n^{2}\ln p + 3.84 \, n$, compatible with a Bravyi--Poulin--Terhal-type tradeoff when the interaction range grows with system size.

Title: Maxwell's demon for quantum transport
Authors: Kangqiao Liu, Masaya Nakagawa, Masahito Ueda
Abstract: While most of the existing quantum information engines assisted by Maxwell's demon harness thermal fluctuations, those that rectify only quantum fluctuations have recently been constructed. We propose an alternative type of quantum information engine that harnesses only quantum fluctuations to achieve cumulative energy storage and unidirectional transport of a particle. This unidirectional transport makes a stark contrast with the case without Maxwell's demon where the motion of a particle is confined to a finite region due to Bloch oscillations. We find a trade-off relationship between the maximum power and the maximum velocity. With an improved definition of efficiency that includes all possible energy flows in the engine cycle, we numerically demonstrate the absence of a trade-off relationship among power, efficiency, and power fluctuations that is present for classical heat engines and classical information engines. We also evaluate the influence of experimentally unavoidable measurement imprecision on the performance of the quantum Maxwell's demon.

Title: Global anomalies of Green's function zeros
Authors: Lei Su, Ivar Martin
Abstract: We study global anomalies of nonlocal effective theories proposed to describe symmetry-preserving Luttinger surfaces, i.e., the momentum-space manifolds of Green's function zeros (GFZs) at zero energy, in strongly interacting fermionic systems. In particular, we focus on simplest possible cases associated with a gapless Dirac zero, which is the counterpart of the gapless Dirac quasiparticle in weakly interacting systems. These theories may be derived by integrating out low-energy degrees of freedom that do not couple to the relevant gauge field. We discuss the global anomaly, the bulk-boundary correspondence, and the constraint on phases consistent with the anomaly, such as non-Fermi liquids and emergent gapless quasiparticles on Luttinger surfaces. Failing to avoid a spontaneous symmetry breaking in the thermodynamical limit inevitably leads unstable GFZs. We also provide some perspectives on why the related nonlocal fermionic effective theory studied recently is not a suitable starting point for a symmetrically gapped phase.

Title: Attractive and repulsive terms in multi-filament dispersion interactions
Authors: Subhojit Pal, John F. Dobson, Mathias Boström
Abstract: Filamentary objects such as nano-wires, nanotubes and DNA are of current interest in physics, nanoscience, chemistry, biology and medicine. They can interact via strong, exceptionally long-ranged many-object van der Waals (vdW, dispersion) forces, causing them to cluster into multi-object bundles. We analyse their vdW interactions perturbatively, predicting $N$-object vdW energy contributions that alternate in sign with increasing $N$. Our findings are confirmed here via the first detailed analysis of a 4-cylinder vdW model. We also provide novel insights permitting these tendencies to be understood simply in terms of electronic screening and anti-screening. Our results suggest that a non-perturbative calculation will be required for reliable prediction of dispersion interactions in these ubiquitous systems.

Title: Infinitely fast critical dynamics: Teleportation through temporal rare regions in monitored quantum circuits
Authors: Gal Shkolnik, Sarang Gopalakrishnan, David A. Huse, Snir Gazit, J. H. Pixley
Abstract: We consider measurement-induced phase transitions in monitored quantum circuits with a measurement rate that fluctuates in time, remaining spatially uniform at each time. The spatially correlated fluctuations in the measurement rate disrupt the volume-law phase for low measurement rates; at a critical measurement rate, they give rise to an entanglement phase transition with ``ultrafast'' dynamics, i.e., spacetime ($x,t$) scaling $\log x \sim t^{\psi_\tau}$. The ultrafast dynamics at the critical point can be viewed as a spacetime-rotated version of an infinite-randomness critical point; despite the spatial locality of the dynamics, ultrafast information propagation is possible because of measurement-induced quantum teleportation. We identify temporal Griffiths phases on either side of this critical point. We provide a physical interpretation of these phases, and support it with extensive numerical simulations of information propagation and entanglement dynamics in stabilizer circuits. The implications of our results on the general stability of phase transitions and ordered phases to such temporal randomness are discussed.

Title: Dual-Spaces Invariance as a Universal Criterion for Identifying Multifractal Critical States
Authors: Tong Liu
Abstract: In Anderson localization physics, eigenstates of disordered quantum systems are commonly classified as extended, localized, or critical, distinguished by their distinct spatial structures in real space. While critical states are known to exhibit multifractal characteristics, a precise and operational criterion for characterizing critical states remains an open challenge. In this work, we address this challenge by revisiting criticality from a dual-spaces perspective that treats position and momentum representations on equal footing. Building on the Liu--Xia criterion, which characterizes critical states by the simultaneous vanishing of Lyapunov exponents ($\gamma=\gamma_m=0$) in both spaces, we show that this dual-spaces characterization captures an essential feature of critical states that is not limited to Lyapunov exponents. In particular, through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the inverse participation ratio exhibits closely related scaling behavior in position and momentum space for critical states. This position-momentum correspondence clearly distinguishes critical states from extended or localized ones, which instead display a pronounced asymmetry between the two representations. Our results establish a robust and universal framework for precisely characterizing multifractal critical states in disordered quantum systems, and provide practical guidance for their identification in current quantum simulation platforms.

Title: Possible Liquid-Nitrogen-Temperature Superconductivity Driven by Perpendicular Electric Field in the Single-Bilayer Film of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at Ambient Pressure
Authors: Zhi-Yan Shao, Jia-Heng Ji, Congjun Wu, Dao-Xin Yao, Fan Yang
Abstract: Recently, high-temperature superconductivity (HTSC) is found in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$/SrLaAlO$_4$ ultrathin film with critical temperature $T_c$ above the McMillan limit at ambient pressure (AP). It is eager to enhance $T_c$ of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at AP. We propose that a perpendicular electric field strongly enhances $T_c$ in the single-bilayer film of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at AP. Under electric field, the layer with lower potential energy will accept electrons flowing from the other layer to fill in the Ni-$3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals, as the nearly half-filled Ni-$3d_{z^2}$ orbital cannot accommodate more electrons. With the enhancement of the filling fraction in the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals in this layer, the interlayer $s$-wave pairing is suppressed, but the intralayer $d$-wave pairing in this layer is strongly enhanced. We numerically verify this idea and yield that an imposed voltage of about $0.1\sim0.2$ volt between layers is enough to realize liquid-nitrogen-temperature HTSC in this single bilayer at AP. Our results appeal for experimental verification.

Title: Is a phonon excitation of a superfluid Bose gas a Goldstone boson?
Authors: Maksim Tomchenko
Abstract: It is generally accepted that phonons in a superfluid Bose gas are Goldstone bosons. This is justified by spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB), which is usually defined as follows: the Hamiltonian of the system is invariant under the $U(1)$ transformation $\hat{\Psi}(\mathbf{r},t)\rightarrow e^{i\alpha}% \hat{\Psi}(\mathbf{r},t)$, whereas the order parameter $\Psi(\mathbf{r},t)$ is not. However, the strict definition of SSB is different: the Hamiltonian and the boundary conditions are invariant under a symmetry transformation, while the ground state is not. Based on the latter criterion, we study a finite system of spinless, weakly interacting bosons using three approaches: the standard Bogoliubov method, the particle-number-conserving Bogoliubov method, and the approach based on the exact ground-state wave function. Our results show that the answer to the question in the title is ``no''. Thus, phonons in a real-world (finite) superfluid Bose gas are similar to sound in a classical gas: they are not Goldstone bosons, but quantised collective vibrational modes arising from the interaction between atoms. In the case of an infinite Bose gas, however, the picture becomes paradoxical: the ground state can be regarded as either infinitely degenerate or non-degenerate, making the phonon both similar to a Goldstone boson and different from it.

Title: Localizing entropy production along non-equilibrium trajectories
Authors: Biswajit Das, Sreekanth K Manikandan
Abstract: An important open problem in nonequilibrium thermodynamics is the quantification and spatiotemporal localisation of entropy production in complex processes from experimental data. Here we address this issue through a data-driven approach that combines the recently developed short-time thermodynamic uncertainty relation based inference scheme with machine learning techniques. Our approach leverages the flexible function representation provided by deep neural networks to achieve accurate reconstruction of high-dimensional, potentially time-dependent dissipative force fields as well as the localization of fluctuating entropy production in both space and time along nonequilibrium trajectories. We demonstrate the versatility of the framework through applications to diverse systems of fundamental interest and experimental significance, where it successfully addresses distinct challenges in localising entropy production.

Title: Minimal thermodynamic cost of computing with circuits
Authors: Abhishek Yadav, Mahran Yousef, David Wolpert
Abstract: All digital devices have components that implement Boolean functions, mapping that component's input to its output. However, any fixed Boolean function can be implemented by an infinite number of circuits, all of which vary in their resource costs. This has given rise to the field of circuit complexity theory, which studies the minimal resource cost to implement a given Boolean function with any circuit. Traditionally, circuit complexity theory has focused on the resource costs of a circuit's size (its number of gates) and depth (the longest path length from the circuit's input to its output). In this paper, we extend circuit complexity theory by investigating the minimal thermodynamic cost of a circuit's operation. We do this by using the mismatch cost (MMC) of a given circuit that is run multiple times in a row to calculate a lower bound on the entropy production (EP) incurred in each such run. Specifically, we discuss conditions under which MMC of a circuit is proportional to the size of a circuit, and when they are not. We also use our results to compare the thermodynamic costs of different circuit families implementing the same family of Boolean functions. In addition, we analyze how differences in the underlying physics of individual gates within a circuit influence the minimal thermodynamic cost of the circuit as a whole. These results lay the foundation for extending circuit complexity theory to include mismatch cost as a resource cost.

Title: Stochastic Thermodynamics of Non-reciprocally Interacting Particles and Fields
Authors: Atul Tanaji Mohite, Heiko Rieger
Abstract: Nonreciprocal interactions that violate Newton's law 'actio=reactio' are ubiquitous in nature and are currently intensively investigated in active matter, chemical reaction networks, population dynamics, and many other fields. An outstanding challenge is the thermodynamically consistent formulation of the underlying stochastic dynamics that obeys local detailed balance and allows for a rigorous analysis of the stochastic thermodynamics of non-reciprocally interacting particles. Here, we present such a framework for a broad class of active systems and derive by systematic coarse-graining exact expressions for the macroscopic entropy production. Four independent contributions to the thermodynamic dissipation can be identified, among which the energy flux sustaining vorticity currents manifests the presence of non-reciprocal interactions. Then, Onsager's non-reciprocal relations, the fluctuation-response relation, the fluctuation relation and the thermodynamic uncertainty relations for non-reciprocal systems are derived. Finally, we demonstrate that our general framework is applicable to a plethora of active matter systems and chemical reaction networks and opens new paths to understand the stochastic thermodynamics of non-reciprocally interacting many-body systems.

Title: Surface charge density wave in UTe2

Abstract: The spatially uniform electronic density characteristic of a metal can become unstable at low temperatures, leading to the formation of charge density waves (CDWs). These CDWs, observed in dichalcogenides, cuprates, and pnictides arise from features in the atomic lattice and its interaction with the electronic band structure that facilitate charge ordering. However, CDWs are rarely observed in presence of Kondo screening and heavy fermion quasiparticles. The heavy fermion topological superconductor candidate UTe$_2$ presents a notable exception, exhibiting a CDW whose origin remains elusive. Here we report high resolution Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) experiments that reveal the primitive wavevectors of the CDW in UTe$_2$. This allows for a refined identification of the nesting wavevectors in the electronic bandstructure. Although these wavevectors have no specific influence on the bulk properties, for example on antiferromagnetic fluctuations, they cause the interactions leading to the CDW at the surface. The heavy fermion hybridization pattern is spatially modulated specifically at the nesting wavevectors, suggesting that surface induced modifications in the U 5f electron valence enable a novel form of purely electron-driven charge ordering.

Title: Anomalous phonon magnetic moments
Authors: Swati Chaudhary, Carl P. Romao, Dominik M. Juraschek
Abstract: Circularly polarized phonons conventionally carry an angular momentum and a magnetic moment arising from circular motions of the atoms. Here, we present three anomalous cases that lead to phonon magnetic moments, which cannot be described in the conventional framework: rotationless axial phonons, which exhibit magnetic responses despite only carrying pseudo angular momentum, divergent gyromagnetic ratios of phonons, in which a magnetic moment is produced despite vanishing angular momentum, and anisotropic gyromagnetic ratios of phonons, which make the phonon angular momentum and magnetic moment noncollinear. Our results shed light on the origin and nature of phonon magnetism and suggest the existence of phononomagnetic hidden order.

Title: Effective synchronization amid noise-induced chaos
Authors: Benjamin Sorkin, Thomas A. Witten
Abstract: Two remote agents with synchronized clocks may use them to act in concert and communicate. This necessitates some means of creating and maintaining synchrony. One method, not requiring any direct interaction between the agents, is to expose them to a common, environmental, stochastic forcing. This "noise-induced synchronization" only occurs under sufficiently mild forcing; stronger forcing disrupts synchronization. We investigate the regime of strong noise, where the clocks' relative phases evolve chaotically. Using a simple realization of disruptive noise, we demonstrate effective synchronization. First, although the relative phases of the two clocks varied erratically, we confirm that they became statistically independent of initial conditions and hence equivalent after a well-defined timescale. Second, we show that an agent can estimate an effective phase that closely agrees with the other's phase. Thus, synchronization is practically attainable beyond the regime of conventional noise-induced synchronization. We finally discuss how it might be used in living systems.

Title: Pairing mechanism and superconductivity in pressurized La$_5$Ni$_3$O$_{11}$
Authors: Ming Zhang, Cui-Qun Chen, Dao-Xin Yao, Fan Yang
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity (SC) with critical temperature $T_c$ above the boiling point of liquid nitrogen in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ has sparked a surge of exploration of high-$T_c$ superconductors in the Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) phase nickelates. More recently, the RP phase nicklate La$_5$Ni$_3$O$_{11}$, which hosts layered structure with alternating bilayer and single-layer NiO$_2$ planes, is reported to accommodate SC under pressure, exhibiting a dome-shaped pressure dependence with highest $T_c\approx 64$ K, capturing a lot of interests. Here, using density functional theory (DFT) and random phase approximation (RPA) calculations, we systematically study the electronic properties and superconducting mechanism of this material. Our DFT calculations yield a band structure including two nearly decoupled sets of sub-band structures, with one set originating from the bilayer subsystem and the other from the single-layer one. RPA-based analysis demonstrates that SC in this material occurs primarily within the bilayer subsystem exhibiting an $s^\pm$ wave pairing symmetry similar to that observed in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$, while the single-layer subsystem mainly serves as a bridge facilitating the inter-bilayer phase coherence through the interlayer Josephson coupling (IJC). Since the IJC thus attained is extremely weak, it experiences a prominent enhancement under pressure, leading to the increase of the bulk $T_c$ with pressure initially. When the pressure is high enough, the $T_c$ gradually decreases due to the reduced density of states on the $\gamma$-pocket. In this way, the dome-shaped pressure dependence of $T_c$ observed experimentally is naturally understood.

Title: Nucleation and Antiphase Twin Control in Bi$_2$Se$_3$ via Step-Terminated Al$_2$O$_3$ Substrates

Zac Ward, Vitalii Starchenko, Nicholas Cucciniello, Robert G. Moore, Gyula Eres, Yue Cao, Debangshu Mukherjee, Liam Collins, Christopher Nelson, Danielle Reifsnyder Hickey, Fei Xue, Matthew Brahlek
Abstract: The epitaxial synthesis of high-quality 2D layered materials is an essential driver of both fundamental physics studies and technological applications. Bi$_2$Se$_3$, a prototypical 2D layered topological insulator, is sensitive to defects imparted during the growth, either thermodynamically or due to the film-substrate interaction. In this study, it is shown that step-terminated Al$_2$O$_3$ substrates with a high miscut angle (3°) can effectively suppress a particular hard-to-mitigate defect, the antiphase twin. Systematic investigations across a range of growth temperatures and substrate miscut angles confirm that atomic step edges act as preferential nucleation sites, stabilizing a single twin domain. First-principles calculations suggest that there is a significant energy barrier for twin boundary formation at step edges, supporting the experimental observations. Detailed structural characterization indicates that this twin-selectivity is lost through the mechanism of the 2D layers overgrowing the step edges, leading to higher twin density as the thickness increases. These findings highlight the complex energy landscape unique to 2D materials that is driven by the interplay between substrate properties, nucleation dynamics, and defect formation, and overcoming and controlling these are critical to improve material quality for quantum and electronic applications.

Title: Hall effect in topologically trivial isolated flat-band systems
Authors: Raigo Nagashima, Masao Ogata, Naoto Tsuji
Abstract: We study the Hall effect in topologically trivial isolated flat-band systems (i.e., flat bands are separated from other bands and have zero Chern number) for a weak magnetic field. In a naive semiclassical picture, the Hall conductivity vanishes when dispersive bands are unoccupied, since there are no mobile carriers. To go beyond the semiclassical picture, we establish a fully quantum mechanical gauge-invariant formula for the Hall conductivity that can be applied to any lattice models. We apply the formula to a general $N+M$-band model with $N$ dispersive bands and $M$-fold degenerate isolated flat bands, and find that when the dispersive bands are unoccupied, the total conductivity takes a universal form consisting of the energy difference between the dispersive and flat bands, and the non-Abelian quantum geometric tensor of the flat bands, which can be nonzero in systems with vanishing Berry curvature. We numerically confirm the Hall effect for isolated flat-band lattice models on the honeycomb lattice ($N=M=1$) and two different Kagome lattices ($N=2$, $M=1$ and $N=1$, $M=2$).

Title: Dirac edge states as signature of two-dimensional altermagnetic topological crystalline phase
Authors: Raghottam M. Sattigeri, Xujia Gong, Amar Fakhredine, Carmine Autieri, Giuseppe Cuono
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) metallic altermagnets present exciting opportunities for both fundamental research and practical innovations. Their ability to enhance tunneling magnetoresistance in magnetic tunnel junctions, combined with the direct control of spin currents via electric fields, makes them highly promising for spintronic devices. Moreover, the rich electronic structure of altermagnets can host nontrivial topological phases. In particular, topological crystalline insulators are compounds where the topological states are protected by both crystalline and time-reversal symmetries. Furthermore, manipulating the state of a system between topological and trivial phases through external parameters unlocks new possibilities for quantum materials and advanced electronics. We show the edge states of a 2D altermagnetic topological crystalline insulator, using as a representative example Cr$_2$BAl, a 2D MBene metallic altermagnet with a d$_{x^2-y^2}$ altermagnetic ordering. We find that the system can host an altermagnetic phase with extremely large ``weak ferrimagnetism" which is sizeable also with light atoms, only with an in-plane component of the Néel vector. The electronic structure of Cr$_2$BAl presents multiple crossings and anti-crossings in the vicinity of the Fermi level along [100] and [010] directions. When the spin-orbit coupling interaction is included, with the Néel vector along [001] direction, energy gaps open at the band crossing points, resulting in a pronounced peak in the spin Hall conductivity. The simulated Cr-B terminated [100] edge-projected band structure reveals Dirac dispersions at the bulk crossings and anti-crossings, which are absent in Cr-Al terminations.

Title: Specific heat and density anomaly in the Hubbard model
Authors: M. A. Habitzreuter, Willdauany C. de Freitas Silva, Eduardo O. Rizzatti, Thereza Paiva, Marcia C. Barbosa
Abstract: Understanding thermal properties of materials is fundamental to technological applications and to discovering new phenomena. In particular, advances in experimental techniques such as cold-atom measurements allow the simulation of paradigmatic Hamiltonians with great control over model parameters, such as the Hubbard model. One aspect of this model which is not much explored is the behavior of the specific heat as a function of density. In this work, we perform Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the Hubbard model interpolating between the square and triangular lattices to analyze the specific heat as the filling, interaction, and temperature of the system are changed. We found that, with strong correlations, the specific heat presents a three-maxima structure as a function of filling, with local minima between them. This effect can be explained by a decomposition of kinetic and potential contributions to the specific heat, demonstrating interesting phenomena away from the commonly studied half-filling regime. Moreover, by analyzing the kinetic contribution in momentum space we show that, connected to this specific heat behavior, there is a density anomaly detected through the thermal expansion coefficient. These momentum-space quantities are accessible using cold-atom experiments measurements at multiple temperatures. Finally, we map the location of these phenomena and connect the thermal expansion anomaly with the well-known Seebeck coefficient change of sign. Our results provide a new perspective to analyze this change of sign.

Title: Miniband Generation by Surface Acoustic Waves
Authors: Eli Meril, Unmesh Ghorai, Tobias Holder, Rafi Bistritzer
Abstract: We introduce a new class of tunable periodic structures, formed by launching two obliquely propagating surface acoustic waves on a piezoelectric substrate that supports a two-dimensional quantum material. The resulting acoustoelectric superlattice exhibits two salient features. First, its periodicity is widely tunable, spanning a length scale intermediate between moiré superlattices and optical lattices, enabling the formation of narrow, topologically nontrivial energy bands. Second, unlike moiré systems, where the superlattice amplitude is set by intrinsic interlayer tunneling and lattice relaxation, the amplitude of the acoustoelectric potential is externally tunable via the surface acoustic wave power. Using massive monolayer graphene as an example, we demonstrate that varying the frequencies and power of the surface acoustic waves enables in-situ control over the band structure of the 2D material, generating flat bands and nontrivial valley Chern numbers, featuring a highly localized Berry curvature.

Title: Artificial Intelligence for Quantum Matter: Finding a Needle in a Haystack
Authors: Khachatur Nazaryan, Filippo Gaggioli, Yi Teng, Liang Fu
Abstract: Neural networks (NNs) have great potential in solving the ground state of various many-body problems. However, several key challenges remain to be overcome before NNs can tackle problems and system sizes inaccessible with more established tools. Here, we present a general and efficient method for learning the NN representation of an arbitrary many-body complex wave function from its N-particle probability density and probability current density and successfully test on (non-Abelian) fractional quantum Hall states and chiral BCS wavefunction. Having reached overlaps as large as 99.9%, we employ our neural wave function for pre-training to effortlessly solve the fractional quantum Hall problem with Coulomb interactions and realistic Landau-level mixing for as many as 25 particles and uncover distinctive features of the edge. Our work demonstrates efficient, scalable and accurate simulation of highly-entangled quantum matter using general-purpose deep NNs enhanced with physics-informed initialization.

Title: Optically detected magnetic resonance of nitrogen-vacancy centers in microdiamonds inside nanopolycrystalline diamond anvil cell
Authors: Masahiro Ohkuma, Keigo Arai, Kenji Ohta, Toru Shinmei, Ryo Matsumoto, Yoshihiko Takano, Tetsuo Irifune
Abstract: We demonstrated optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in microdiamonds inside a diamond anvil cell pressurized with nanopolycrystalline diamond (NPD) anvils. NPD exhibits high optical transparency, superior hardness, and low thermal conductivity, making it suitable for optical and spectroscopic measurements under high-pressure and high-temperature conditions. We observed the ODMR signal from an ensemble of NV centers under conditions where NV centers in microdiamonds served as markers for pressures exceeding 30 GPa, with a culet diameter of 600 $\mu$m. We also performed ODMR measurements on multiple microdiamonds sealed inside a sample chamber and found that the resonance frequency varied with the pressure distribution. The combination of NPD and microdiamonds containing NV centers is auspicious for pressure and magnetic sensing under concurrent high-pressure and high-temperature conditions.

Title: Boundary-driven magnetization transport in the spin-$1/2$ XXZ chain: Role of the system-bath coupling strength and timescales
Authors: Mariel Kempa, Markus Kraft, Sourav Nandy, Jacek Herbrych, Jiaozi Wang, Jochen Gemmer, Robin Steinigeweg
Abstract: Understanding the transport properties of quantum many-body systems is a central challenge in condensed matter and statistical physics. Theoretical studies usually rely on two main approaches: Dynamics of linear-response functions in closed systems and boundary-driven dynamics governed by Markovian master equations for open systems. While the equivalence of their dynamical behavior has been explored in recent studies, a systematic comparison of the transport coefficients obtained from these two classes of approaches remains a largely open question. Here, we address this gap by comparing and contrasting the dc diffusion constant $\mathcal{D}_{\text{dc}}$ according to the two approaches, focusing on the specific example of magnetization transport in the spin-$1/2$ XXZ chain. Using exact numerical simulations for finite system sizes, we find (i) a clear mismatch between the two $\mathcal{D}_{\text{dc}}$ and (ii) a strong dependence of $\mathcal{D}_{\text{dc}}$ on the system-bath coupling strength for the open system, where neither (i) nor (ii) tend to vanish in the thermodynamic limit. These findings suggest limitations of the open-system approach to transport coefficients. To gain insight into the origin of (i) and (ii), we go beyond $\mathcal{D}_{\text{dc}}$ and analyze the full time dependence of the diffusion coefficient $D(t)$ in the open system. In this way, we find that both (i) and (ii) vanish up to a finite time scale. While this time scale gradually increases with system size and tends to be macroscopic in the thermodynamic limit, this increase is still slow compared to the increase of the time to reach the steady state, where (i) and (ii) do not vanish. This observation can be seen as a wrong, yet unavoidable order of limits of long times first and large system sizes afterwards.

Title: Finite-momentum mixed singlet-triplet pairing in chiral antiferromagnets induced by even-parity spin texture
Authors: Song-Bo Zhang, Lun-Hui Hu
Abstract: Non-relativistic spin-splitting in unconventional antiferromagnets has garnered much attention for its promising spintronic applications and open fundamental questions. Here, we uncover a unique even-parity spin texture in chiral non-collinear antiferromagnets, exemplified using a kagome lattice. We consider two distinct types of electrons in the system: one with Schrödinger-like dispersion and the other exhibiting Dirac-like behavior. Remarkably, we show that, for both electron types, this spin texture induces an exotic coexistence of opposite-spin singlet and equal-spin triplet Cooper pairs with finite momentum when proximity-coupled to conventional superconductors. The triplet pairing arises from the intrinsic spin rotation of the antiferromagnet and does not require net magnetization or spin-orbit coupling. Moreover, we identify an unprecedented and tunable phase difference between singlet and triplet pairings, controllable through junction orientation. This mixed pairing state can be experimentally probed via damped oscillations in order parameters and 0-$\pi$ transitions in Josephson junctions. Additionally, we analyze the effect of out-of-plane spin canting, elucidating its role in generating spin-polarized supercurrents, and discuss Mn$_3$Ga and Mn$_3$Ge to test our predictions.

Title: Robust two-dimensional surface superconductivity and vortex lattice in the Weyl semimetal $γ$-PtBi$_2$
Authors: Jose Antonio Moreno, Pablo García Talavera, Edwin Herrera, Sara López Valle, Zhuoqi Li, Lin-Lin Wang, Sergey Bud'ko, Alexander I. Buzdin, Isabel Guillamón, Paul C. Canfield, Hermann Suderow
Abstract: The layered compound $\gamma$-PtBi$_2$ is a topological semimetal with Fermi arcs at the surface joining bulk Weyl points. Recent work has found signatures of surface superconductivity consisting of gap openings compatible with a critical temperature orders of magnitude larger than the bulk value. However, no superconducting vortices have been identified, raising questions about the robustness of the phase coherence. Here we use very low temperature Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) and find robust superconductivity with T$_C=$2.9 K and H$_{C2}\approx$1.8 T linked to the Fermi arcs. We observe quantized superconducting vortices, demonstrating two-dimensional macroscopic quantum phase coherence.

Title: Sagnac and Mashhoon effects in graphene
Authors: Yu.V. Shtanov, T.-H.O. Pokalchuk, S.G. Sharapov
Abstract: We investigate the Sagnac and Mashhoon effects in graphene, taking into account both the pseudospin and intrinsic spin of electrons, within a simplified model of a rotating nanotube or infinitesimally narrow ring. Based on considerations of the relativistic phase of the wave function and employing the effective Larmor theorem, we demonstrate that the Sagnac fringe shift retains a form analogous to that for free electrons, governed by the electron's vacuum mass. In the case of a narrow ring, an additional $\pi$-phase shift arises due to the Berry phase associated with the honeycomb graphene lattice. The Mashhoon fringe shift retains its conventional form, with its dependence on the Fermi velocity.

Title: Inertia Tames Fluctuations in Autonomous Stationary Heat Engines
Authors: Enrique P. Cital, Viktor Holubec
Abstract: Thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs) provide fundamental constraints on the interplay between power fluctuations, entropy production, and efficiency in overdamped stationary autonomous heat engines. However, their validity in underdamped regimes remains limited and less explored. Here, we analytically and numerically study a physically realizable autonomous heat engine composed of two underdamped continuous degrees of freedom coupled to a two-level system. We show that this nonlinear setup can robustly violate TUR-based trade-offs by exploiting resonant coupling, effectively using one underdamped mode as an internal periodic drive. When this coupling is suppressed, the system recovers TUR-like bounds consistent with overdamped theory. Importantly, we demonstrate that the strongest suppression of current fluctuations occurs in a resonance regime that can be directly inferred from mean current measurements - a quantity typically much easier to access experimentally than fluctuations. Our results reveal new pathways to circumvent classical TUR constraints in underdamped systems and provide practical guidelines for designing efficient, precise microscopic engines and autonomous clocks.

Title: Revisiting the adiabatic limit in ballistic multiterminal Josephson junctions
Authors: Régis Mélin, Asmaul Smitha Rashid, Romain Danneau, Morteza Kayyalha
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments on multiterminal Josephson junctions (MJJs) that probe different ranges of the size and bias voltage parameters, we explore the regime of increasing bias voltage in large-scale devices, where the electrochemical potential becomes comparable to the 1D energy level spacing. We find that the relative number of quantum-correlated pairs formed by colliding Floquet--Kulik quartet levels is equal to the inverse of the number of channels. This observation motivates a model for the intermediate regime in which the ballistic central two-dimensional normal metal is treated as a continuum under the adiabatic approximation, while Andreev modes propagate in a background of voltage- and flux-tunable nonequilibrium electronic populations. The model predicts characteristic voltage scales that govern the mesoscopic oscillations of the critical current, and these scales are at the crossroads of interpreting experiments in all sectors of the MJJs: quartets, topology, and Floquet theory. Our model is specifically inspired by the recent Harvard and Penn State group experiments.

Title: Follow the curvature of viscoelastic stress: Insights into the steady arrowhead structure
Authors: Pierre-Yves Goffin, Yves Dubief, Vincent E. Terrapon
Abstract: Focusing on simulated dilute polymer solutions, this letter investigates the interactions between flow structures and organized polymer stress sheets for the steady arrowhead coherent structure in a two-dimensional periodic channel flow. Formulating the problem in a frame of reference moving with the arrowhead velocity, streamlines, which are also pathlines in this frame, enables the identification of two distinct topological regions linked to two stagnation points. The streamlines help connecting the spatial distribution of polymer stress within the sheets and the dynamics of polymers transported by the flow. Using stresslines, lines parallel to the eigenvectors of polymer stress, a novel formulation of the viscoelastic stress term in the momentum transport equation proposes a more intuitive interpretation of the relation between the curvature of the stresslines, and the variation of stress along these lines, with the local flow topology. An approximation of this formulation is shown to explain the pressure jump observed in the arrowhead structure as a function of the local curvature of the polymer stress sheet.

Title: Green's Function Methods for Computing Supercurrents in Josephson Junctions
Authors: Eduardo R. Mucciolo, Jouko Nieminen, Xiao Xiao, Wei-Chi Chiu, Michael N. Leuenberger, Arun Bansil
Abstract: Interest in Josephson junctions (JJs) has increased rapidly in recent years not only because of their use in qubits and other quantum devices but also due to the unique physics supported by the JJs. The advent of various novel quantum materials for both the barrier region and the superconducting leads has led to the possibility of adding new functionalities to the JJs. Thus, there is a growing need for accurate modeling of the JJs and related systems to enable their predictive control and atomistic level understanding. This review presents an in-depth discussion of a Green's function-based formalism for computing supercurrents in JJs. The formulation is tailored for large-scale atomistic simulations and encompasses both dc and ac supercurrents. We hope that this review will provide a timely and comprehensive reference for researchers as well as beginning practitioners interested in Green's-function-based methods to model supercurrents in JJs.

Title: Defects in Wigner crystals: fracton-elasticity duality and vacancy proliferation
Authors: Paweł Matus
Abstract: We develop a low-energy field theory for electrically charged crystals. Using the tools of fracton-elasticity duality, generalized to accommodate the magnetic 1-form symmetry of electromagnetism, we show how the elastic and electromagnetic degrees of freedom couple to the different crystal defects and to one another. The resulting field theory is then used to calculate vacancy-vacancy interaction energy, and to study the consequences of vacancy proliferation. We find that the longitudinal mode, which in a perfect crystal has a finite gap due to plasma oscillations, becomes gapless in the presence of vacancies. Our framework lays a foundation for a study of defect interactions, their collective dynamics, and consequences of defect-mediated melting in charged crystals.

Title: Ion Permeation in Nanoscale Films: Fundamental Limitation and Evaluation of Dielectric Properties
Authors: Jay Prakash Singh, Konstantin I. Morozov, Viatcheslav Freger
Abstract: Nanoscale films play a central role in biology and osmotic separations. Their water/salt selectivity is often regarded as intrinsic property, favoring thinner membranes for faster permeation. Here we highlight and quantify a fundamental limitation arising from the dependence of ion self-energy on film thickness, governed by its ratio to Bjerrum length. The resulting relation factors out this dependence from intrinsic ion permeability, which agrees well with available data and enables evaluation of dielectric properties of ultrathin films, advancing understanding of ion transport in membranes.

Title: Cation vacancies mediate thermochemical water splitting with iron aluminates
Authors: Nathan J. Szymanski, Kent J. Warren, Alan W. Weimer, Christopher J. Bartel
Abstract: Solar thermochemical water splitting enables hydrogen production by cycling metal oxides between reduced and oxidized states, typically through an oxygen vacancy mechanism. However, recent experimental work suggests that cation vacancies have a greater influence on the redox behavior of iron aluminate spinels used in water splitting. This remains debated, as calculations predict that such cation vacancies are thermodynamically unfavorable. In the current work, we show that Fe vacancies in (Fe$\zeta$Al1-$\zeta$)3O4 become accessible only when facilitated by inversion between Fe and Al. This antisite disorder lowers the formation energy of octahedral Fe vacancies in Al-rich spinels ($\zeta$ = 1/3) from over 3 eV to just 0.62 eV when one third of the cation sites are inverted, allowing high Fe vacancy concentrations under oxidizing conditions. This mechanism supports high H2 yields up to 361 $\mu$mol/g, consistent with experimental observations. Our findings support the notion that solar thermochemical water splitting can occur through a cation vacancy mechanism. They also clarify how site inversion, vacancy energetics, and defect interactions each contribute to redox performance, offering general design principles for identifying and optimizing materials that operate through cation vacancy cycling.

Title: Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials Enable Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Doped MoS2
Authors: Abrar Faiyad, Ashlie Martini
Abstract: Dopants can tune the performance of MoS2 in various applications, but use of molecular dynamics simulations for doped MoS2 materials discovery is limited by the lack of multi-dopant interatomic potentials. Universal machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) could be a solution, but the accuracy of these potentials must first be evaluated. Here, we evaluate the accuracy of a recently developed MLIP, META's Universal Model for Atoms (UMA), for 25 different MoS2 dopants spanning metals, non-metals, and transition metals in Mo substitution, S substitution, and intercalated positions by benchmarking the MLIP-predicted formation energy and the dopant-induced structural change against density functional theory calculations. The computational framework for MLIP validation and simulations are described in detail and the source code is made open source. The MLIP is then demonstrated by performing heating-cooling simulations of MoS2 supercells with all 25 dopants. These simulations capture complex phenomena including dopant clustering, MoS2 layer fracturing, interlayer diffusion, and chemical compound formation at orders-of-magnitude reduced computational cost compared to density functional theory. This work provides a computational workflow for application-oriented design of doped-MoS2, enabling high-throughput screening of dopant candidates and optimization of compositions for targeted tribological, electronic, and optoelectronic performance.

Title: Field-Induced SIT in Disordered 2D Electron systems: The case of amorphous Indium-Oxide thin films
Authors: Tsofar Maniv, Vladimir Zhuravlev
Abstract: The phenomenon of field-induced superconductor to insulator transition (SIT) in disordered 2D electron systems has been a subject of controversy since its discovery in the early 1990s. Here we present a phenomenological quantitative theory of this phenomenon which is not based exclusively on the boson-vortex duality used commonly in the field. Within a new low-temperature framework of the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) functional approach to superconducting fluctuations we propose and develop a scenario in which bosons of Cooper-pair fluctuations (CPFs) condense and localize in real-space mesoscopic puddles under increasing magnetic field due to diminishing stiffness of the fluctuation modes at low temperatures in a broad range of momentum space. Quantum tunneled CPFs relieving the condensed mesoscopic puddles, which consequently pair break into fermionic quasi-particle excitations, dominate the thermally activated inter-puddles transport. The spatially shrinking puddles of CPFs, embedded in expanding normal-state regions, upon further increasing field, suppress the quasi-particle excitation gap and so lead to high-field negative magneto-resistance (MR). Application to amorphous Indium-Oxide thin films shows good quantitative agreement with experimental sheet resistance data. In particular, in agreement with the experiment at low temperatures (i.e. well below the quantum tunneling pair breaking "temperature"), the sheet resistance isotherms are predicted to show a single crossing point at a quantum critical field not far below the MR peak.

Title: Roles of Electron-Magnon Cross-Diffusion in Unidirectional Magnetoresistance of Metallic Magnetic Bilayers
Authors: Shashank Gupta, Steven S.-L. Zhang
Abstract: Unidirectional magnetoresistance (UMR) in metallic bilayers arises from nonlinear spin-charge transport mediated by broken time-reversal and inversion symmetries, yet the role of magnons remains unsettled. We develop a theoretical framework that incorporates coupled electron-magnon dynamics, revealing cross diffusion and spin-angular-momentum transfer between the two subsystems, which renormalize the characteristic electron and magnon spin-diffusion lengths. We show that nonequilibrium magnons, indirectly excited by the electric field, can suppress UMR by absorbing spin angular momentum from conduction electrons. We also analyze the magnetic-field, thickness, and temperature dependencies and identify distinct features that constitute experimental fingerprints of magnonic contributions to UMR in metallic bilayers, providing qualitative to semiquantitative guidance for elucidating the underlying physical mechanisms.

Title: Osmotic forces modify lipid membrane fluctuations
Authors: Amaresh Sahu
Abstract: In hydrodynamic descriptions of lipid bilayers, the membrane is often approximated as being impermeable to the surrounding, solute-containing fluid. However, biological and in vitro lipid membranes are influenced by their permeability and the resultant osmotic forces -- whose effects remain poorly understood. Here, we study the dynamics of a fluctuating, planar lipid membrane that is ideally selective: fluid can pass through it, while the electrically-neutral solutes cannot. We find that the canonical membrane relaxation mode, in which internal membrane forces are balanced by fluid drag, no longer exists over all wavenumbers. Rather, this mode only exists when it is slower than solute diffusion -- corresponding to a finite range of wavenumbers. The well-known equipartition result quantifying the size of membrane undulations due to thermal perturbations is consequently limited in its validity to the aforementioned range. Moreover, this range shrinks as the membrane surface tension is increased, and above a critical tension the membrane mode vanishes. Our findings are relevant when interpreting experimental measurements of membrane fluctuations, especially in vesicles at moderate to high tensions.

Abstract: We investigate the adiabatic elimination of fast variables in relativistic stochastic mechanics, which is analyzed by using the equation of motion and the distribution function, with relativistic corrections explicitly derived. A new dimensionless parameter is introduced to characterize the timescale. The adiabatic elimination is compared with the path integral coarse graining, which is more general yet computationally demanding.

Title: Magnetization, excitations, and microwave power absorption in transition-metal/rare-earth ferrimagnets with disorder
Authors: D. A. Garanin, E. M. Chudnovsky
Abstract: Efficient numerical routines are developed for numerical studies of the dependence of the equilibrium magnetic states, excitations, and microwave power absorption on temperature and composition in transition-metal/rare-earth ferrites, including the reversal of the Néel vector occurring on both temperature and the concentration of the rare-earth atoms. It results in a drastic change in the behavior at the magnetization and angular-momentum compensation points. Dominant uniform oscillation modes are obtained by computing the magnetization correlation function. They are compared with the analytical solution, which is analyzed in detail. The fluctuation-dissipation theorem is used to compute the frequency dependence of the absorbed microwave power. A good agreement with analytical results is demonstrated. Disorder caused by random positions of rare-earth atoms in a diluted RE system leads to multiple localized modes that converge into broad absorption maxima as the size of the system increases. The power absorption integrated over frequency exhibits a minimum at the compensation point.

Title: Exploring transition pathways in the Landau-Brazovskii model
Authors: Zhiyi Zhang, Gang Cui, Kai Jiang, An-Chang Shi, Pingwen Zhang, Jianyuan Yin, Lei Zhang
Abstract: The Landau-Brazovskii model provides a theoretical framework for describing various phases arising from competing short- and long-range interactions in many physical systems. In this work, we investigate phase transitions among various ordered phases within the three-dimensional Landau-Brazovskii model. We construct the phase diagram of this model, which encompasses eight distinct phases, and systematically compute the transition pathways connecting various metastable and stable states using the Landau-Brazovskii saddle dynamics. Along each transition pathway, the critical nucleus is identified with some detailed analyses of its shape, energy barrier, and Hessian eigenvalues. Furthermore, we explore how the transition state is influenced by model parameters, revealing systematic trends in critical nucleus sizes and energy barrier heights. Our results provide a comprehensive characterization of the nucleation mechanisms within the Landau-Brazovskii model and offer valuable insights into the structural transformations of modulated-phase systems.

Title: Beyond Poisson: First-Passage Asymptotics of Renewal Shot Noise
Authors: Julien Brémont
Abstract: The first-passage time (FPT) of a stochastic signal to a threshold is a fundamental observable across physics, biology, and finance. While renewal shot noise is a canonical model for such signals, analytical results for its FPT have remained confined to the Poisson (Markovian) case, despite the prevalence of non-Poisson arrival statistics in applications from neuronal spiking to gene expression. We break this long-standing barrier by deriving the first universal asymptotic formula for the mean FPT $\langle T_b \rangle$ to reach level $b$ for renewal shot noise with general arrival statistics and exponential marks. Our central result is a closed-form expression that reveals precisely how general inter-arrival statistics impact the naive Arrhenius law. We show that the short-time behavior of the interarrival distribution dictates universal scaling corrections, ranging from stretched-exponential to algebraic, that can dramatically accelerate threshold crossing. Furthermore, we show analytically and confirm numerically that the full FPT distribution becomes exponential at large thresholds, implying that $\langle T_b \rangle$ provides a complete asymptotic characterization. Our work, enabled by a novel exact solution for the moments of the noise, establishes a general framework for analyzing extreme events in non-Markovian systems with relaxation.

Title: The Gravitational Aspect of Information: The Physical Reality of Asymmetric "Distance"
Authors: Tomoi Koide, Armin van de Venn
Abstract: We show that when a Brownian bridge is physically constrained to satisfy a canonical condition, its time evolution exactly coincides with an m-geodesic on the statistical manifold of Gaussian distributions. This identification provides a direct physical realization of a geometric concept in information geometry. It implies that purely random processes evolve along informationally straight trajectories, analogous to geodesics in general relativity. Our findings suggest that the asymmetry of informational ``distance" (divergence) plays a fundamental physical role, offering a concrete step toward an equivalence principle for information.

Title: Design principles for amorphous solid-state electrolytes
Authors: Qifan Yang, Xiao Fu, Xuhe Gong, Jingchen Lian, Liqi Wang, Ruijuan Xiao, Yong-Sheng Hu, Hong Li
Abstract: Amorphous solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) offer unique advantages for next-generation batteries, but their rational design is hindered by an unclear structure-property relationship. This study establishes universal design principles through atomistic simulations of 32 amorphous Li-M-X systems (M = B, Al, Si, P; X = F, Cl, Br, I, O, S, Se, N). We identify four structure types governed by a rule that saturated M-X groups with more negative charges preferentially form M-X-M chains, identify paddle-wheel and cooperative migration as two favorable transport mechanisms that are significantly enhanced in amorphous structures. We also pinpoint Oxides and fluorides as optimal for electrochemical and hydrolytic stability, and reveal bulk modulus as a simple predictor for $Li^+$ mobility. These insights are integrated into a practical design diagram, providing a novel and valuable framework for advancing high-performance amorphous SSEs.

Title: Role of on-site Coulomb energy and negative-charge transfer in a Dirac semi-metal NiTe$_2$
Authors: A. R. Shelke, C.-W. Chuang, S. Hamamoto, M. Oura, M. Yoshimura, N. Hiraoka, C.-N. Kuo, C.-S. Lue, A. Fujimori, A. Chainani
Abstract: Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) combined with band structure calculations have shown that the layered transition metal dichalcogenide(TMD) NiTe$_2$ is a type-II Dirac semimetal. However, conflicting conclusions were reported regarding the role of electron correlations in NiTe$_2$. We study core-levels and valence band electronic structure of single crystal NiTe$_2$ using soft and hard x-ray photoemission spectroscopy(SXPES, HAXPES), X-ray absorption spectroscopy(XAS) and Ni $2p-3d$ Resonant-PES to quantify electronic parameters in NiTe$_2$. The Ni $3d$ on-site Coulomb energy ($U_{dd}$) is quantified from measurements of the Ni $3d$ single particle density of states(DOS) and the two-hole correlation satellite. The Ni $2p$ core level and $L$-edge XAS spectra are analyzed by charge-transfer (CT) cluster model calculations using the experimental $U_{dd}$, and it shows that NiTe$_2$ exhibits a negative CT energy $\Delta$. A comparative analysis of NiO $L$-edge XAS confirms its well-known strongly correlated CT insulator character, with a larger $U_{dd}$ and positive $\Delta$. The $d$-$p$ hybridization strength $T_{eg}$ for NiTe$_2$$<$NiO, and shows that $T_{eg}$ is not responsible for reducing $U_{dd}$ in NiTe\textsubscript{2} compared to NiO. The negative-$\Delta$ and a reduced $U_{dd}$ leads to the increase in $d^n$ count on the Ni site in NiTe$_{2}$ by nearly one electron. However, importantly, since $U_{dd}$$>$$|\Delta|$, a finite repulsive $U_{dd}$ results in pushing $d$-states away from Fermi level and this is required to make NiTe$_{2}$ a moderately correlated Dirac semi-metal with band inversion in the $p$-$p$ type lowest energy excitations.

Abstract: The layered $3d$ transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) CoTe$_2$ is a topological Dirac Type-II metal. However, the Co $3d$-bands in CoTe$_2$ do not exhibit the expected correlation-induced band narrowing seen in CoO. We address this conundrum by studying the electronic structure of CoTe$_2$ using hard x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (HAXPES), x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and Resonant-PES. We quantify the on-site Coulomb energy $U_{dd}$ via single-particle partial density of states and the two-hole correlation satellite using valence band Resonant-PES), and obtain $U_{dd}$ = 3.0 eV for CoTe$_2$. Charge-transfer (CT) cluster model simulations of the measured core-level Co $2p$ PES and $L$-edge XAS spectra of CoTe\textsubscript{2} and CoO validate their contrasting electronic parameters:$U_{dd}$ and CT energy $\Delta$ are (3.0 eV, -2.0 eV) for CoTe\textsubscript{2}, and (5.0 eV, 4.0 eV) for CoO, respectively. The $d$-$p$ hybridization strength $T_{eg}$ for CoTe$_2$$<$CoO, and indicates that the reduced $U_{dd}$ in CoTe\textsubscript{2} is not due to $T_{eg}$. The increase in $d^n$-count$\sim$1 by CT from ligand to Co site in CoTe$_2$ is due to a negative-$\Delta$ and reduced $U_{dd}$. Yet, only because $U_{dd}$$>$$\big|\Delta\big|$, CoTe$_{2}$ becomes a topological metal with $p$$\rightarrow$$p$ type lowest energy excitations. The study reveals the nexus between negative-$\Delta$ and reduced $U_{dd}$ required for setting up the electronic structure framework for achieving topological behavior via band inversion in the correlated metal CoTe$_2$.

Title: Experimental confirmation of the magnetic ordering transition induced by an electronic structure change in the metallic triangular antiferromagnet Co$_{1/3}$TaS$_2$
Authors: Han-Jin Noh, En-Jin Cho, Byeong-Gyu Park, Hyowon Park, Ivar Martin, Cristian D. Batista, Pyeongjae Park, Woonghee Cho, Je-Guen Park
Abstract: We report ARPES studies combined with DFT+DMFT calculations to confirm that the magnetic ordering vector transition from \textbf{Q}=(1/2,0,0) to \textbf{Q}=(1/3,0,0) in the metallic triangular antiferromagnets Co$_{1/3\pm\epsilon}$TaS$_2$ ($\epsilon\approx$0.007) is induced by the electronic structure change in the system. The ARPES-measured Fermi surface (FS) maps of Co$_{0.325}$TaS$_2$ show two hexagonal and one circular hole-like FSs around $\Gamma$, which matches well with the triple-\textbf{Q} state by taking into account the contribution of nesting vectors occurring between Co 3$d$ and Ta 5$d$ orbitals. In the case of Co$_{0.340}$TaS$_2$, a new electron pocket around K appears and the FS geometry changes as a result of the correlation effect of Co$_4$S$_{18}$ tripods forming in the system. The magnetic susceptibility calculations based on the charge-self-consistent DFT+DMFT band structures and the random phase approximation indicate that the most stable magnetic ordering vector (1/2,0,0) split into (1/6,0,0) and (1/2,0,0), which is consistent with the magnetic phase transition around $x$=1/3 in Co$_{x}$TaS$_2$.

Title: Floquet Engineering Magnetism and Superconductivity in the Square-Lattice Hubbard Model
Authors: Jan-Niklas Herre, Takuya Okugawa, Ammon Fischer, Christoph Karrasch, Dante M. Kennes
Abstract: We study the interplay of magnetic order and superconductivity in the square-lattice Hubbard model under periodic driving with circularly polarized light. Formulating diagrammatic techniques based on the random-phase approximation in terms of Floquet Green's functions, allows us to analyze fluctuation-driven unconventional pairing for weak-to-moderate interactions. The interplay of repulsive interactions and photo-assisted hopping of electrons gives rise to a rich magnetic phase diagram featuring an antiferromagnetic-to-ferromagnetic transition prior to a Floquet Lifshitz transition. Close to the antiferromagnetic transition, topological $d+id$-wave superconductivity prevails in the phase diagram for a wide range of drive parameters. At intermediate-to-high frequency driving near the Floquet Lifshitz transition, superconducting orders are tuned from spin-singlet $d$-wave to spin-triplet $p$-wave character, providing an effective protocol for Floquet engineering topological superconductivity.

Title: Origin of the large topological Hall effect in the EuCd$_2$Sb$_2$ antiferromagnet
Authors: Faheem Gul, Orest Pavlosiuk, Tetiana Romanova, Dariusz Kaczorowski, Piotr Wiśniewski
Abstract: We study the origin of large topological Hall effect in the single-crystalline EuCd$_2$Sb$_2$, which orders antiferromagnetically at the Néel temperature $T_{\rm N}=7.4$ K. Measurements of magnetoresistance and Hall resistivity disclose anomalies that evolve with temperature and magnetic field, closely tracking the magnetization process. Analysis of these data identifies three possible mechanisms responsible for the enhanced Berry curvature driving the observed topological Hall effect. Below and above $T_{\rm N}$, Weyl states are the main sources of large momentum-space Berry curvature, though their formation mechanisms differ in these two temperature ranges. Below $T_{\rm N}$, breaking of $C_{3}$ symmetry generates Dirac points that split into Weyl nodes in applied magnetic field, whereas above $T_{\rm N}$, strong spin fluctuations can induce Weyl states. The third contribution, which occurs below $T_{\rm N}$, arises from scalar spin chirality developing within antiferromagnetic domain walls, which generates a real-space Berry curvature.

Title: Phase diagram of the one-dimensional three-state Potts model with an additional mean-field interaction
Authors: Alessandro Campa, Vahan Hovhannisyan, Stefano Ruffo, Andrea Trombettoni
Abstract: We derive the phase diagram of the one-dimensional three-state Potts model with an additional mean-field interaction in the canonical ensemble. The free energy is obtained by mapping the model onto the spin-$1$ Blume-Emery-Griffiths model and solving it by using an Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation combined with the transfer matrix method. A complex structure with lines of first-order transitions, two triple points and a critical point appears at finite temperature. The phase diagram is two-dimensional, since there are two adjustable parameters, the nearest-neighbour coupling $K$ and the temperature $T$. We show that the phase diagram does not present second-order phase transition lines, due to the fact that the order parameter is not a symmetry-breaking one. Quite remarkably, we are able to determine analytically one of the first-order phase-transition lines. We also prove that, when the nearest-neighbour coupling $K$ is large and negative, the first-order transition temperature becomes asymptotically independent of $K$.

Title: Hitting the blinking target under stochastic resetting
Authors: Bartosz Zbik, Bartłomiej Dybiec, Karol Capała, Zbigniew Palmowski, Igor M. Sokolov
Abstract: The first hitting times of a stochastic process, i.e., the first time a process reaches a particular level, are of significant interest across various scientific disciplines, including biology, chemistry, and economics. We modify the standard setup by allowing the target to spontaneously switch between two states, either active or inactive, and investigate the distribution of first hitting times accrued while the target is active. For this setup, we provide closed formulas for the distribution of the first hitting time. Additionally, we can introduce stochastic resetting to the underlying process and, utilizing our results, derive the formulas for the first time the active target is hit by the process under stochastic resetting. Interestingly, we show that resetting in this setup still leaves some memory; the system is no longer Markovian, which prevents a straightforward application of standard techniques. The analytical results are accompanied by computer simulations of Langevin dynamics.

Title: Topical Review: The rise of Klein tunneling in low-dimensional materials and superlattices
Authors: Yonatan Betancur-Ocampo, Guillermo Monsivais, Vít Jakubský
Abstract: We review recent advances in Klein and anti-Klein tunneling in one- and two-dimensional materials. Using a general tight-binding framework applied to multiple periodic systems, we establish the criteria for the emergence of Klein tunneling based on the conservation of an effective reduced pseudospin. The inclusion of higher-order terms in the wave vector leads to nontrivial matching conditions for wave scattering at interfaces. We further examine the emergence of multiple types of Klein tunneling in two-dimensional materials beyond graphene, including phosphorene and borophene, as well as in one-dimensional systems such as Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattices. Finally, we discuss how these tunneling phenomena can be tested in both synthesized and artificial lattices, including elastic metamaterials, optical, photonic, phononic, and superconducting platforms, demonstrating the universality of Klein tunneling across different wave natures and length scales.

Title: Fast and Slow Sound Excitations in Nematic Aerogel in superfluid 3He
Authors: A.M. Bratkovsky
Abstract: Nematic aerogel (nAG) supports so-called polar phase in liquid 3He. The experiments by [Dmitriev et al, JETP Lett. 112, 780 (2020)] showed that the onset of polar phase inside the nAG is accompanied by emergence of a sound wave with frequency quickly growing with cooling down from transition temperature and reaching a plateau. To describe this behavior, we start by calculating the elastic properties of the dry nematic AG that appear to depend only on Young's modulus of the parent material (e.g. mullite), the volume fraction of the solid phase and the aspect ratio of the representative volume of nAG. The elastic constants are then used to solve elasto-hydrodynamic equations for various sound vibrations of nAG filled with 3He. The (isotropic) first sound and anisotropic second sound in the polar phase are strongly hybridized with fourth sound and standard elastic modes in nAG. The hybrid second and the transverse fourth sound start with zero velocity at the transition, similar to pure 3He, and quickly grow with lowering temperature until they hit the sample finite size cutoff.

Title: Collinear Magnetic Structure in the Diamond Network Magnet EuTi$_2$Al$_{20}$
Authors: Masahiro Kawamata, Ryuji Higashinaka, Takeshi Matsumura, Maxim Avdeev, Kazuaki Iwasa, Hironori Nakao, Kazumasa Hattori, Tatsuma D. Matsuda
Abstract: The magnetic structure of EuTi$_2$Al$_{20}$, in which magnetic Eu$^{2+}$ ions form a diamond network, was investigated using neutron and resonant X-ray diffraction on powder and single-crystal samples. The propagation vector was determined to be $\textbf{\textit{q}}_{\rm m}=(1,0,0)$~r.l.u. from these diffraction measurements. All possible magnetic structures in the space group $Fd\bar{3}m$ with this propagation vector were examined using the irreducible representation method and magnetic space group analysis. This magnetic structure was identified as a collinear antiferromagnetic structure with the magnetic space group $P_Inna$ (\#52.320) or $P_Inn2$ (\#34.164) under zero magnetic field. In these magnetic structure, frustration arises from competing magnetic interactions on the diamond network. These findings provide a concrete experimental reference for assessing the role of competing interactions in diamond-network magnets and motivate further studies of interaction-driven quantum states.

Title: Janus MoSSe/WSSe Heterobilayers as Selective Photocatalysts for Water Splitting
Authors: Mostafa Torkashvand, Saeedeh Sarabadani Tafreshi, Caterina Cocchi, Surender Kumar
Abstract: Identifying materials that simultaneously straddle the water redox potentials and possess an intrinsic electric field is crucial for achieving high solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency. Using state-of-the-art first-principles calculations, including a range-separated hybrid functional and spin-orbit coupling, we investigate MoXY/WXY (X, Y = S, Se) Janus bilayers for overall water splitting. We find a critical competition between the metal-to-metal chemical potential difference and the intrinsic dipoles at the interface between the Janus monolayers. We find that the Se-Se interfaced heterobilayer is intrinsically capable of driving water splitting, while its S-S counterpart can meet the redox requirements through pH modulation. For both configurations, a remarkable STH efficiency of 17.1% is anticipated. Furthermore, we predict a threshold of 1.0 eV for the built-in potential gradient to govern the transition from overall water splitting to band-edge pinning. Compared to homobilayers, heterobilayers benefit from the reciprocity between layer-specific dipoles and the Mo/W chemical potential difference, which promotes spatial separation and suppresses recombination, overall enhancing hydrogen production. Our results establish specific electronic descriptors for Janus heterostructures, providing a rational design rule for maximizing solar-driven hydrogen production in asymmetric two-dimensional materials.

Title: Non-zero Momentum Implies Long-Range Entanglement When Translation Symmetry is Broken in 1D
Authors: Amanda Gatto Lamas, Taylor L. Hughes
Abstract: A result by Gioia and Wang [Phys Rev X 12, 031007 (2022)] showed that translationally symmetric states having nonzero momentum are necessarily long range entangled (LRE). Here, we consider the question: can a notion of momentum for non-translation symmetric states directly encode the nature of their entanglement, as it does for translation symmetric states? We show the answer is affirmative for 1D systems, while higher dimensional extensions and topologically ordered systems require further work. While Gioia and Wang's result applies to states connected via finite depth quantum circuits to a translation symmetric state, it is often impractical to find such a circuit to determine the nature of the entanglement of states that break translation symmetry. Here, instead of translation eigenstates, we focus on the many-body momentum distribution and the expectation value of the translation operator in many-body states of systems having broken translation symmetry. We show that in the continuum limit the magnitude of the expectation value of the translation operator $|<T>|$ necessarily goes to $1$ for delocalized states, a proxy for LRE states in 1D systems. This result can be seen as a momentum-space version of Resta's formula for the localization length. We investigate how accurate our results are in different lattice models with and without well-defined continuum limits. To that end, we introduce two models: a deterministic version of the random dimer model, illustrating the role of the thermodynamic and continuum limits for our result at a lattice level, and a simplified version of the Aubry-Andre model, with commensurate hopping for both momentum and position space. Finally, we use the random dimer model as a test case for the accuracy of $|<T>|$ as a localization (and thus entanglement) probe for 1D periodic lattice models without a well-defined continuum limit.

Title: Exactly Solvable Topological Phase Transition in a Quantum Dimer Model
Authors: Laura Shou, Jeet Shah, Matthew Lerner-Brecher, Amol Aggarwal, Alexei Borodin, Victor Galitski
Abstract: We introduce a family of generalized Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) Hamiltonians, which are reverse-engineered to have an arbitrary edge-weighted superposition of dimer coverings as their exact ground state at the RK point. We then focus on a quantum dimer model on the triangular lattice, with doubly-periodic edge weights. For simplicity we consider a $2\times1$ periodic model in which all weights are set to one except for a tunable horizontal edge weight labeled $\alpha$. We analytically show that the model exhibits a continuous quantum phase transition at $\alpha=3$, changing from a topological $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquid ($\alpha<3$) to a columnar ordered state ($\alpha>3$). The dimer-dimer correlator decays exponentially on both sides of the transition with the correlation length $\xi\propto1/|\alpha-3|$ and as a power-law at criticality. The vison correlator exhibits an exponential decay in the spin liquid phase, but becomes a constant in the ordered phase. We explain the constant vison correlator in terms of loops statistics of the double-dimer model. Using finite-size scaling of the vison correlator, we extract critical exponents consistent with the 2D Ising universality class.

Title: Machine Learning to Predict Spectral Anisotropy in Valence-to-Core X-ray Emission Spectroscopy
Authors: Charles A. Cardot, John R. Tichenor, Seth M. Shjandemaar, Josh J. Kas, Gerald T. Seidler, John J. Rehr
Abstract: Polarization analysis in x-ray spectroscopy provides an orientation dependent sensitivity to local bonding environments. For a cluster of atoms, polarization sensitivity is most often discussed through the lens of point group symmetries. However, this is a discrete, qualitative method of classifying clusters, and it does little to indicate the degree of spectral anisotropy. Here we adopt a random forest model for quantitative prediction of spectral anisotropy. Its input relies on simplified local geometric and chemical information that can be obtained from any crystal structure file. The model is trained on over 10,000 experimentally realized transition metal structures from the Materials Project, with the target being VtC-XES calculated using the real space Green's function code FEFF. We find that the model can strongly predict the degree of spectral anisotropy, with the primary factors being derived from the spatial moments of ligands in a cluster.

Title: Fooling the Landauer bound with a demon biased thermal bath
Authors: Salambô Dago, Ludovic Bellon
Abstract: The Landauer principle establishes a fundamental lower bound on the energetic cost of the erasure of a one-bit memory in thermal equilibrium. Here, we experimentally demonstrate how this bound can be effectively circumvented by introducing a hysteresis in the feedback-generated virtual potential of a micro-resonator acting as the information bit. By tuning the hysteresis, we engineer a non-equilibrium steady state with an adjustable effective temperature, enabling erasure processes that consume over 20 percents below the Landauer bound. Our results reveal that the hysteresis acts as an embedded Maxwell demon, exploiting temporal and spatial information to reduce the system's entropy and the thermodynamic transformation cost. This approach provides a versatile platform for exploring the interplay between feedback, information, and energy in stochastic systems.

Title: The Sokoban Random Walk: A Trapping Perspective
Authors: Prashant Singh, Eli Barkai, David A Kessler
Abstract: We study caging/trapping in Sokoban-type models, featuring a random walker moving through a disordered medium of obstacles and capable of pushing some obstacles blocking its path. In one-dimension, we allow the walker to push up to an arbitrary $N_{\rm P}$ number of obstacles. For $N_{\rm P}\gg 1$, we use large-deviation theory to show that the survival probability to remain uncaged exhibits crossover from an exponential decay with time at intermediate times to a stretched-exponential decay at long times, with an exponent $1/3$ independent of $N_{\rm P}$. The long-time exponent matches the Balagurov--Vaks--Donsker--Varadhan (BVDV) theory of the classical trapping problem, while the exponential decay is qualitatively distinct from the Rosenstock's intermediate-time theory for classical trapping. Similarly, in two dimensions, numerical simulations reveal that both the Sokoban model and its generalized version exhibit long-time stretched-exponential relaxation with exponent $1/2$, again consistent with the BVDV theory. Finally, in two dimensions, we find that the mean trap size is nonmonotonic in $\rho$: it is small at both low and high densities, but reaches a peak at a characteristic density $\rho_*$. We estimate $\rho_* \approx 0.55$ for the Sokoban model and $\rho_* \approx 0.675$ for the generalized Sokoban model.

Title: Topology optimization of type-II superconductors with superconductor-dielectric/vacuum interfaces based on Ginzburg-Landau theory under Weyl gauge
Authors: Yongbo Deng, Jan G. Korvink
Abstract: Geometry design is a crucial and challenging strategy for improving the performance of type-II superconductors. Topology optimization is one of the most powerful approaches used to determine structural geometries. Therefore, a topology optimization approach is presented to inversely design structural geometries of both low- and high-temperature type-II superconductors with superconductor-dielectric/vacuum interfaces. In the presented approach, the magnetic response of type-II superconductors is modeled using the Ginzburg-Landau theory, where the temporal evolution of the order parameter and vector potential is described by the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations under the Weyl gauge.

Title: Sub-1-Angstrom-Resolution Imaging Reveals Phase Contrast Transition in Ice Ih Caused by Basal Stacking Faults
Authors: Jingshan S. Du, Suvo Banik, Lehan Yao, Shuai Zhang, Subramanian K. R. S. Sankaranarayanan, James J. De Yoreo
Abstract: Phase-contrast transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of hexagonal ice (Ih) along [0001] sometimes shows a honeycomb-like pattern, often interpreted as individual oxygen columns in single crystals. Here, we show that this pattern commonly arises from intrinsic basal stacking faults instead. A translational boundary separating domains of comparable thickness, with an in-plane offset of $(\frac{2}{3} a_{1} + \frac{1}{3} a_{2})$, produces this honeycomb-like contrast. Stacking domains translated in nonequivalent directions yields patterns resembling cubic ice (Ic) along [111] but with a 3-fold symmetry. We imaged this structure at a record-breaking line resolution of 89 picometers, finer than the O-H covalent bond length. These findings highlight the defect tolerance of ice's molecular packing and clarify the structural relationships among hexagonal, stacking-disordered, and cubic ice phases. This resolution milestone opens new avenues for characterizing subtle structural perturbations of water in the solid state.

Title: Entropy Has No Direction: A Mirror-State Paradox Against Universal Monotonic Entropy Increase and a First-Principles Proof that Constraints Reshape the Entropy Distribution $P_{\infty}(S;λ)$
Authors: Ting Peng
Abstract: We present a purely theoretical, self-contained argument that the Second Law of Thermodynamics cannot be a universal fundamental law in the form ``entropy does not decrease'' (whether asserted trajectory-wise or as a universal statistical principle) when the underlying microscopic dynamics are time-reversal invariant. The core is a mirror-state construction: for any microstate $A$ one constructs its time-reversed partner $B$ (momenta inverted). If a universal monotonicity statement is applied to both $A$ and $B$, it implies that $A$ is a local minimum of entropy at every moment, which forces entropy to be constant and destroys any entropic arrow of time. The consistent replacement is that entropy is a stochastic variable described by a probability distribution $P(S)$, whose shape depends on constraints and boundary conditions. We then prove from first principles that constraints necessarily reshape the long-time entropy distribution $P_{\infty}(S;\lambda)$ by altering the invariant measure through changes in the Hamiltonian and/or the accessible phase space. A sharp criterion is given: in the microcanonical setting, the \emph{only} way $P_{\infty}^{(E)}(S;\lambda)$ can remain the same up to translation is when all accessible macrostate volumes are scaled by a common factor; otherwise the distribution changes structurally. Recent experimental work validates this framework: asymmetric constraints enable spontaneous low-entropy transitions, allowing systems to produce useful work by absorbing heat from a single thermal reservoir. With both theoretical and experimental barriers overcome, practical devices based on constraint-reshaped entropy distributions become feasible, with profound implications for energy generation and the long-term sustainability of civilization.

Title: Emergent Topological Complexity in the Barabasi-Albert Model with Higher-Order Interactions
Authors: Vadood Adami, Hosein Masoomy, Mirko Luković, Morteza Nattagh Najafi
Abstract: We examine the homological structure of the Barabasi-Albert model, focusing on the time evolution of $\Delta$-dimensional simplices and topological holes as functions of time $t$ and the attachment parameter $m$ (the number of edges added by each incoming node). Numerical simulations reveal a non-trivial topological transition (TT) in the $(\Delta, m)$ plane, marking a change from a topologically trivial regime to non-trivial topology. This transition signals the emergence of topological complexity in the model, where higher-order structures develop self-similarly across scales. Beyond this transition, the network exhibits self-similar topological growth, evidenced by a power-law decay in the increments of $\Delta$-simplices with $m$-dependent exponents. An analogous transition occurs in the Betti numbers, which display self-similar behavior near the TT and an arctangent dependence farther from it. Based on simulation data, we propose explicit scaling relations describing the behavior of both $\Delta$-simplices and Betti numbers near the TT. Overall, the analysis reveals a rich, gapful topological transition structure, where topological quantities exhibit discrete jumps at the transition point.

Title: Mott-insulating phases of the Bose-Hubbard model on quasi-1D ladder lattices
Authors: Lorenzo Carfora, Callum W. Duncan, Stefan Kuhr, Peter Kirton
Abstract: We calculate the phase diagram of the Bose-Hubbard model on a half-filled ladder lattice including the effect of finite on-site interactions. This shows that the rung-Mott insulator (RMI) phase persists to finite interaction strength, and we calculate the RMI-superfluid phase boundary in the thermodynamic limit. We show that the phases can still be distinguished using the number and parity variances, which are observables accessible in a quantum-gas microscope. Phases analogous to the RMI were found to exist in other quasi-1D lattice structures, with the lattice connectivity modifying the phase boundaries. This shows that the the presence of these phases is the result of states with one-dimensional structures being mapped onto higher dimensional systems, driven by the reduction of hopping rates along different directions.

Title: Perfect Wave Transfer in Continuous Quantum Systems
Authors: Per Moosavi, Matthias Christandl, Gian Michele Graf, Spyros Sotiriadis
Abstract: The transfer of information from one part of a quantum system to another is fundamental to the understanding and design of quantum information processing devices. In the realm of discrete systems such as spin chains, inhomogeneous networks have been engineered that allow for the perfect transfer of qubits from one end to the other. Here, by contrast, we investigate the perfect transfer of information in continuous systems, phrased in terms of wave propagation. A remarkable difference is found between systems that possess conformal invariance and those that do not. Systems in the first class enjoy perfect wave transfer (PWT), explicitly shown for one-particle excitations and anticipated in general. In the second class, those that exhibit PWT are characterized as solutions to an inverse spectral problem. As a concrete example, we demonstrate how to formulate and solve this problem for a prototypical class of bosonic theories, showing the importance of conformal invariance for these theories to enjoy PWT. Using bosonization, our continuum results extend to theories with interactions, broadening the scope of perfect information transfer to more general quantum systems.

Title: The Huang-Yang formula for the low-density Fermi gas: upper bound
Authors: Emanuela L. Giacomelli, Christian Hainzl, Phan Thành Nam, Robert Seiringer
Abstract: We study the ground state energy of a gas of spin $1/2$ fermions with repulsive short-range interactions. We derive an upper bound that agrees, at low density $\rho$, with the Huang-Yang conjecture. The latter captures the first three terms in an asymptotic low-density expansion, and in particular the Huang-Yang correction term of order $\rho^{7/3}$. Our trial state is constructed using an adaptation of the bosonic Bogoliubov theory to the Fermi system, where the correlation structure of fermionic particles is incorporated by quasi-bosonic Bogoliubov transformations. In the latter, it is important to consider a modified zero-energy scattering equation that takes into account the presence of the Fermi sea, in the spirit of the Bethe-Goldstone equation.

Title: Omnidirectional shuttling to avoid valley excitations in Si/SiGe quantum wells
Authors: Róbert Németh, Vatsal K. Bandaru, Pedro Alves, Emma Brann, Owen M. Eskandari, Hudaiba Soomro, Avani Vivrekar, M.A. Eriksson, Merritt P. Losert, Mark Friesen
Abstract: Conveyor-mode shuttling is a key approach for implementing intermediate-range coupling between electron-spin qubits in quantum dots. Initial implementations are encouraging; however, long shuttling trajectories are guaranteed to encounter regions of low conduction-band valley energy splittings, due to the presence of random-alloy disorder in Si/SiGe quantum wells. Here, we theoretically explore two schemes for avoiding valley-state excitations at these valley-splitting minima, by allowing the electrons to detour around them. A multichannel shuttling scheme allows electrons to tunnel between parallel channels, while a two-dimensional (2D) shuttler provides full omnidirectional control. Using simulations, we estimate shuttling fidelities in these two schemes, obtaining a clear preference for the 2D shuttler. Based on such encouraging results, we propose a modular qubit architecture based on 2D shuttling, which enables all-to-all connectivity within qubit plaquettes and high-fidelity communication between different plaquettes.

Title: Reshaping MOFs text mining with a dynamic multi-agents framework of large language model
Authors: Zuhong Lin, Daoyuan Ren, Kai Ran, Jing Sun, Songlin Yu, Xuefeng Bai, Xiaotian Huang, Haiyang He, Pengxu Pan, Ying Fang, Zhanglin Li, Haipu Li, Jingjing Yao
Abstract: Accurately identifying the synthesis conditions of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is essential for guiding experimental design, yet remains challenging because relevant information in the literature is often scattered, inconsistent, and difficult to interpret. We present MOFh6, a large language model driven system that reads raw articles or crystal codes and converts them into standardized synthesis tables. It links related descriptions across paragraphs, unifies ligand abbreviations with full names, and outputs structured parameters ready for use. MOFh6 achieved 99% extraction accuracy, resolved 94.1% of abbreviation cases across five major publishers, and maintained a precision of 0.93 +/- 0.01. Processing a full text takes 9.6 s, locating synthesis descriptions 36 s, with 100 papers processed for USD 4.24. By replacing static database lookups with real-time extraction, MOFh6 reshapes MOF synthesis research, accelerating the conversion of literature knowledge into practical synthesis protocols and enabling scalable, data-driven materials discovery.

Title: Multiplexity amplifies geometry in networks
Authors: Jasper van der Kolk, Dmitri Krioukov, Marián Boguñá, M. Ángeles Serrano
Abstract: Many real-world network are multilayer, with nontrivial correlations across layers. Here we show that these correlations amplify geometry in networks. We focus on mutual clustering--a measure of the amount of triangles that are present in all layers among the same triplets of nodes--and find that this clustering is abnormally high in many real-world networks, even when clustering in each individual layer is weak. We explain this unexpected phenomenon using a simple multiplex network model with latent geometry: links that are most congruent with this geometry are the ones that persist across layers, amplifying the cross-layer triangle overlap. This result reveals a different dimension in which multilayer networks are radically distinct from their constituent layers.

Title: Fluctuation theorems for multipartite quantum coherence and correlation dynamics
Authors: Kun Zhang, Mo-Yang Ni, Hai-Long Shi, Xiao-Hui Wang, Jin Wang
Abstract: Fluctuation theorems establish exact relations for nonequilibrium dynamics, profoundly advancing the field of stochastic thermodynamics. In this work, we extend quantum fluctuation theorems beyond the traditional thermodynamic framework to quantum multipartite information dynamics, where both the system and the environment are multipartite without assuming any thermodynamic constraints. Based on the two-point measurement scheme and the classical probability, we establish the fluctuation theorem for the dynamics of classical multipartite mutual information. By extending to quasiprobability, we derive quantum fluctuation theorems for multipartite coherence and quantum correlations, presenting them in both integral and detailed forms. Our theoretical results are illustrated and verified using three-qubit examples, and feasible experimental verification protocols are proposed. These findings uncover the statistical structure underlying the nonequilibrium quantum information dynamics, providing fundamental insights and alternative tools for advancing quantum technologies.

Title: Halogen-Terminated Carbon Atomic Wires by Laser Ablation in Halogenated Organic Solvents: Synthesis and Characterization
Authors: Pietro Marabotti, Simone Melesi, Piotr Pińkowski, Bartłomiej Pigulski, Sonia Peggiani, Alice Cartoceti, Patrick Serafini, Barbara Rossi, Valeria Russo, Sławomir Szafert, Carlo Spartaco Casari
Abstract: We report the synthesis of halogenated carbon atomic wires (halopolyynes) via pulsed laser ablation in liquid and their comprehensive Raman characterization. Using dichloromethane and dibromomethane-containing solutions, we produced polydisperse mixtures of monohalogenated (HC$_{2n}$X) and dihalogenated (XC$_{2n}$X) polyynes (X=Cl, Br; n=3-10). High-performance liquid chromatography enabled separation and analysis of these compounds, while chemical derivatization and mass spectrometry confirmed their molecular structures. A possible formation mechanism is proposed, involving carbon chain polymerization and termination by hydrogen and halogen atoms from atomized solvent molecules during the plasma phase. UV-Vis absorption and synchrotron-based UV Resonance Raman spectroscopy reveal that halogen terminations act as auxochromes through p-$\pi$ conjugation between their lone-pair electrons and the sp-carbon backbone, extending effective conjugation length. This interaction reduces bond length alternation and moderately redshifts vibronic absorption and vibrational modes. Resonance Raman spectra show selective overtone enhancement and vibrational anharmonicity consistent with carbyne-like materials. These findings expand the synthetic approaches for halogenated carbon atomic wires and establish halopolyynes as a platform for tailoring electronic and optical properties of sp-carbon wires.

Abstract: We investigate dynamical decoupling operated by $2\pi$-pulses in a two-level subspaces of a multilevel system showing that it may leads to selective decoupling. This provides a flexible strategy for decoupling transitions in a quantum network, when control to directly address them is not available which can be use to control internode interaction or actively suppress decoherence

Authors: Emma C. King, Giovanna Morigi, Raphaël Menu
Abstract: Quantum adiabatic dynamics is the crucial element of adiabatic quantum computing and quantum annealing. Shortcuts to adiabaticity enable acceleration of the computational time by suppressing unwanted non-adiabatic processes with designed classical fields. Here, we consider quantum state transfer in the Landau-Zener model, which exemplifies the key elements of quantum adiabatic dynamics. We argue that non-adiabatic transitions can be suppressed by autonomous quantum dynamics, which involves coupling the Landau-Zener qubit to a second quantum system. By tuning the coupling strength, the composite quantum dynamics can reduce the probability of unwanted processes by more than two orders of magnitude. This is a prime example of control where the quantum properties of the control fields are key for implementing shortcuts to adiabaticity.

Title: Single-gate, multipartite entanglement on a room-temperature quantum register
Authors: Joseph D. Minnella, Mathieu Ouellet, Amelia R. Klein, Lee C. Bassett
Abstract: Multipartite entanglement is an essential aspect of quantum systems, needed to execute quantum algorithms, implement error correction, and achieve quantum-enhanced sensing. In solid-state quantum registers such nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, entangled states are typically created using sequential, pairwise gates between the central electron and individual nuclear qubits. This sequential approach is slow and suffers from crosstalk errors. Here, we demonstrate a parallelized multi-qubit entangling gate to generate a four-qubit GHZ state using a room-temperature NV center in only 14.8 $\mu$s $-$ 10 times faster than using sequences of two-qubit gates and close to the fundamental limit set by the hyperfine coupling frequencies. Parallel three-qubit gates are also realized with all nuclear-qubit subsets. The entangled states are verified by measuring multiple quantum coherences. The four-qubit parallel gate has a fidelity of 0.92(4), whereas the sequential four-qubit gate fidelity is only 0.69(3). The approach is generalizable to other solid-state platforms, and it lays the foundation for scalable generation and control of entanglement in practical devices.

Title: Magnon squeezing near a quantum critical point in a cavity-magnon-qubit system
Authors: Gang Liu, Gen Li, Rong-Can Yang, Wei Xiong, Jie Li
Abstract: Preparing magnon nonclassical states is a central topic in the study of quantum magnonics. Here we propose to generate magnon squeezed states in a hybrid cavity-magnon-qubit system by engineering an effective Rabi-type magnon-qubit interaction. This is achieved by adiabatically eliminating the cavity mode and driving the qubit with two microwave fields, of which the driving frequencies and amplitudes are properly selected. By operating the system around the critical point associated with the ground-state superradiant phase transition in the normal phase, a magnon parametric amplification-like interaction is induced, leading to a dynamical magnon squeezing. We further analyze the effects of the dissipation, dephasing, and thermal noise on the magnon squeezing. Our results indicate that a moderate degree of squeezing can be produced using currently available parameters in the experiments.

Title: How to Build Anomalous (3+1)d Topological Quantum Field Theories
Authors: Arun Debray, Weicheng Ye, Matthew Yu
Abstract: We develop a systematic framework for constructing (3+1)-dimensional topological orders or topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) that realize specified anomalies of finite symmetries, as encountered in gauge theories with fermions or in fermionic lattice systems. Our approach generalizes the symmetry-extension construction to the fermionic setting, and is grounded in recent advances in the categorical classification of anomalous TQFTs in (3+1)d. In this framework, symmetry-extension data of a supercohomology theory are translated into a fusion 2-category, on which the anomalous TQFT is built. Building on this machinery, we demonstrate explicit calculations for various symmetry groups and their associated anomalies, with the help of a hastened Adams spectral sequence for computing supercohomology groups which we will detail in a planned sequel. Finally, we prove that all supercohomology anomalies can be realized by fermionic topological orders, whereas beyond-supercohomology anomalies cannot, resolving a question of Córdova--Ohmori for fermionic (3+1)d systems with finite symmetries.

Title: Anomaly induced transport from symmetry breaking in holography
Authors: Ashis Tamang, Nishal Rai, Karl Landsteiner, Eugenio Megias
Abstract: We study the transport properties of relativistic fluids induced by quantum anomalies in presence of explicit symmetry breaking. To this end we consider a holographic Einstein-Maxwell model in 5 dimensions with pure gauge and a mixed gauge-gravitational Chern-Simons terms, coupled with a scalar field. To study the chiral vortical effects and the energy transport sector, apart from the chiral magnetic effects, we have considered the full backreaction of the gauge field on the metric. We have studied the anomalous effects by using Kubo formulae involving correlators of the charged currents and the energy current. Our findings reveal that, in the presence of explicit symmetry breaking, anomaly-induced transport phenomena can extend beyond anomalous currents and affect non-anomalous sectors as well. In particular, we find that all the conductivities display a distinct sensitivity to the mass parameter controlling the symmetry breaking, thus reflecting the interplay between anomaly coefficients and explicit symmetry breaking terms. These findings highlight the role played by pure gauge and mixed gauge-gravitational anomalies in holographic transport, and their importance for strongly coupled systems with broken symmetries.

Title: Game Theory in Cosmology
Authors: Oem Trivedi, Venkat Venkatsubramanian
Abstract: We present a game-theoretic statistical framework for cosmology, which we term \textit{Cosmological Teleodynamics}. We recast the dark sector, cosmic acceleration, large-scale structure, and cosmic tensions as emergent consequences of nonlocal memory and intrinsically persistent organization in a self-gravitating Universe. By introducing a maximum-caliber weight on cosmic histories and a bias functional encoding structural memory, we derive modified Friedmann, Boltzmann, and Poisson equations that naturally generate dark energy-like acceleration, dark matter-like clustering, and scale-dependent growth suppression. We also show how this approach can naturally help alleviate the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions, can produce anisotropic velocity fields, and predict environment-dependent halo signatures that cannot arise from particle dark matter or scalar-field dark energy. We also derive a generalized horizon entropy and temperature, revealing a nonequilibrium statistical origin for cosmic acceleration and formulating a Law of Universal Arbitrage Equilibrium that governs the evolution of the Universe, showing that it is expanding towards a continuous form of Nash equilibrium. Cosmological Teleodynamics therefore offers a unified, emergent, and testable alternative to the conventional dark sector, rooted not in new particles but in the intrinsic statistical and systemic structure of cosmic memory, and shows that the universe itself operates like a giant potential game.

Title: Random purification channel made simple
Authors: Filippo Girardi, Francesco Anna Mele, Ludovico Lami
Abstract: The recently introduced random purification channel, which converts $n$ i.i.d. copies of any mixed quantum state into a uniform convex combination of $n$ i.i.d. copies of its purifications, has proved to be an extremely useful tool in quantum learning theory. Here we give a remarkably simple construction of this channel, making its known properties -- and several new ones -- immediately transparent. In particular, we show that the channel also purifies non-i.i.d. states: it transforms any permutationally symmetric state into a uniform convex combination of permutationally symmetric purifications, each differing only by a tensor-product unitary acting on the purifying system. We then apply the channel to give a one-line proof of (a stronger version of) the recently established Uhlmann's theorem for quantum divergences.

Title: Droplet Breakup Against an Isolated Obstacle
Authors: David J. Meer, Shivnag Sista, Mark D. Shattuck, Corey S. O'Hern, Eric R. Weeks
Abstract: We describe combined experiments and simulations of droplet breakup during flow-driven interactions with a circular obstacle in a quasi-two-dimensional microfluidic chamber. Due to a lack of in-plane confinement, the droplets can also slip past the obstacle without breaking. Droplets are more likely to break when they have a higher flow velocity, larger size (relative to the obstacle radius R), smaller surface tension, and for head-on collisions with the obstacle. We also observe that droplet-obstacle collisions are more likely to result in breakup when the height of the sample chamber is increased. We define a nondimensional breakup number Bk ~ Ca, where Ca is the Capillary number, that accounts for changes in the likelihood of droplet break up with variations in these parameters. As Bk increases, we find in both experiments and discrete element method (DEM) simulations of the deformable particle model that the behavior changes from droplets never breaking (Bk << 1) to always breaking for Bk >> 1, with a rapid change in the probability of droplet breakup near Bk = 1. We also find that Bk ~ S^(4/3), where S characterizes the symmetry of the collision, which implies that the minimum symmetry required for breakup is controlled by a characteristic distance h ~ R.

Title: Acoustic Analogy of Quantum Baldin Sum Rule for Optimal Causal Scattering
Authors: Sichao Qu, Zixiong Yu, Erqian Dong, Min Yang, Nicholas X. Fang
Abstract: The mass law is a cornerstone in predicting sound transmission loss, yet it neglects the constraints of causal dispersion. Current causality-based theories, such as the Rozanov limit, are applicable only to one-port reflective absorbers. Here, we derive a universal sum rule governing causal scattering in acoustic systems, establishing a rigorous analogy to the Baldin sum rule in quantum field theory. This relation reveals that the integral of the extinction cross-section is fundamentally locked by the scatterer's static effective mass and stiffness, which is validated numerically using seminal examples of underwater metamaterials. Furthermore, the proposed sum rule predicts an optimal condition for an anomalously broadened transmission loss bandwidth, as experimentally observed through the spectral shaping effect of an acoustic Fano resonator. Our findings open up an unexplored avenue for enhancing the scattering bandwidth of passive metamaterials.

Title: IEPDYN: Integral-equation formalism of population dynamics
Authors: Kento Kasahara, Ryo Okabe, Chia-en A. Chang, Toshifumi mori, Nobuyuki Matubayasi
Abstract: We propose the integral-equation formalism of population dynamics (IEPDYN) to describe the population dynamics of distinct configurational states. According to classical reaction dynamics theory, the probability density associated with a given state obeys the Liouville equation, including influx from and efflux to neighboring states. By introducing a Markov approximation for the crossing of boundaries separating the states, tractable integral equations governing the state populations are derived. Once the time-dependent quantities appearing in these equations are evaluated, the population dynamics on long timescales can be obtained. Because these quantities depend only on a few states in the local neighborhood of a given state, they can be computed using a set of short-timescale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The IEPDYN method is formulated in continuous time and therefore does not rely on a coarse-grained timescale (lag time). Consequently, kinetic quantities obtained from IEPDYN are free from lag-time dependence, which has been discussed as a limitation in other approaches. We apply the IEPDYN method to the binding and unbinding kinetics of CH$_4$/CH$_4$, Na$^+$/Cl$^-$, and 18-crown-6-ether (crown ether)/K$^+$ in water. For both kinetics, the time constants estimated from the IEPDYN method are almost comparable to those obtained from brute-force MD simulations. The required timescale of each MD trajectory in the IEPDYN method is approximately two orders of magnitude shorter than that in the brute-force MD approach in the crown ether/K$^+$ system. This reduction in the trajectory timescale enables applications to complex binding and unbinding systems whose characteristic timescales are far beyond those directly accessible by brute-force MD simulations.

Title: Quantum Cellular Automata on a Dual-Species Rydberg Processor
Authors: Ryan White, Vikram Ramesh, Alexander Impertro, Shraddha Anand, Francesco Cesa, Giuliano Giudici, Thomas Iadecola, Hannes Pichler, Hannes Bernien
Abstract: As quantum devices scale to larger and larger sizes, a significant challenge emerges in scaling their coherent controls accordingly. Quantum cellular automata (QCAs) constitute a promising framework that bypasses this control problem: universal dynamics can be achieved using only a static qubit array and global control operations. Despite an extensive history of theoretical explorations and proposals, QCAs have not been experimentally explored in the context of highly-scalable globally-controlled systems. Here we realize QCAs on a dual-species Rydberg array of rubidium and cesium atoms, leveraging independent global control of each species to perform multiple quantum protocols. Seeding an automaton with different initial states, we explore many-body dynamics of quasiparticles and grow GHZ states across both species, highlighting the flexibility of our approach. We further develop a second automaton using a novel mediated entangling gate, enabling generation of 96.7(1.7)%-fidelity Bell states, 17-qubit cluster states, and high-connectivity graph states. Our results demonstrate that simple global controls enable access to a rich variety of applications through the QCA framework. The versatility and scalability of QCAs present compelling opportunities for the development of quantum information systems, as well as new perspectives on quantum many-body dynamics.

Title: Universal rapid machine learning models for predicting unconvoluted and convoluted X-ray Absorption Spectra
Authors: Fei Zhan, Zhi Geng
Abstract: X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) is an essential tool for elucidating the atomic-scale, local three-dimensional (3D) structure of given materials and molecules. The rapid computation of XANES based on molecular 3D structures constitutes a vital element of quantitative XANES analysis. Here, we present an XANES prediction model. It takes 3D structures as input and generates either unconvoluted XANES or convoluted spectra as output, demonstrating excellent generalizability across diverse instrumental broadening. This model has validated its predictive capability for both hard X-ray XAS (exemplified by K-edges of 3d 4d metals and lanthanides) and soft X-ray XAS (using S K-edge as examples). Adopting the model, XANES spectra of multiple elements can be predicted using a single unified model. A highly efficient 3D structure fitting algorithm based on this unconvoluted XANES prediction model, aiming to serve as an online data analysis method suitable for XAS beamlines.

Title: Temperature as a Dynamically Maintained Steady State: Photonic Mechanisms, Maintenance Cost, and the Limits of the Infinite-Reservoir Idealization
Authors: David Vaknin
Abstract: Classical thermodynamics treats temperature as a state variable characterizing systems in equilibrium with idealized infinite reservoirs. We argue that this framing, while computationally exact, obscures an essential physical reality: any system at finite characteristic energy $E_c = k_B T$ continuously emits thermal radiation and cools unless energy input compensates these losses. What thermodynamics calls ``thermal equilibrium'' is, at the microscopic level, a dynamically sustained steady state maintained by continuous photon exchange. We derive that the average photon energy required to sustain a Planck distribution is $\langle h\nu \rangle = \pi^4 E_c/[30\,\zeta(3)] \approx 2.701\,E_c$, quantifying the energetic throughput that any real system must sustain to maintain a given temperature. We resolve the apparent contradiction with the purely mechanical Maxwell velocity distribution: billiard-ball kinetics correctly describe the \emph{shape} of the distribution at a given $E_c$, but cannot account for how $E_c$ is established or maintained against radiative losses in any real system of charged particles. We further show that every finite thermal reservoir is itself maintained by photon exchange at a larger scale, organizing physical systems into a natural hierarchy from individual samples through cryostats, laboratories, and planetary surfaces to stellar interiors, with the classical infinite reservoir emerging as the large-capacity limit within that hierarchy rather than a fundamental physical entity. We also comment on the relation between thermodynamic entropy $S = k_B \ln W$ and the dimensionless entropy $\mathcal{S} = \ln W$, emphasizing that $k_B$ primarily fixes units (J/K) rather than introducing new statistical content. These results do not modify thermodynamics but provide its mechanistic interpretation in terms of quantum electrodynamics.

Title: Liouvillian Gap in Dissipative Haar-Doped Clifford Circuits
Authors: Ha Eum Kim, Andrew D. Kim, Jong Yeon Lee
Abstract: Quantum chaos is commonly assessed through probe-dependent signatures that need not coincide. Recently, a dissipative signature was proposed for chaotic Floquet systems, where infinitesimal bulk dissipation induces a non-zero constant intrinsic relaxation rate quantified by the Liouvillian gap. This raises a question: what minimal departure from Clifford dynamics is required to generate such intrinsic relaxation? To address this, we study a Floquet two-qubit Clifford circuit doped with Haar-random single-qubit gates and subject to local dissipation of strength $\gamma$. We find a structure-dependent crossover. The undoped iSWAP-class circuit exhibits a weak-dissipation singularity, with a gap that grows with $N$ for any $\gamma>0$. Haar doping preserves this undoped-like growth for any subextensive doping pattern. At finite doping density, there exist patterns that yield an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ gap for any fixed $\gamma$ as $N\to\infty$, yet remain singular as $\gamma\to0^+$. Because our bounds depend only on the spatial doping pattern, they remain valid even when the Haar rotations are independently redrawn each Floquet period. Overall, our findings provide a circuit-level perspective on intrinsic relaxation, and thus irreversibility, in open many-body systems.

Title: Emergence of Krylov complexity through quantum walks: An exploration of the quantum origins of complexity
Authors: Dimitrios Patramanis, Watse Sybesma
Abstract: In this work we study the relationship between quantum random walks on graphs and Krylov/spread complexity. We show that the latter's definition naturally emerges through a canonical method of reducing a graph to a chain, on which we can identify the usual Krylov structure. We use this identification to construct families of graphs corresponding to special classes of systems with known complexity features and conversely, to compute Krylov complexity for graphs of physical interest. The two main outcomes are the analytic computation of the Lanczos coefficients for the SYK model for an arbitrary number $q$ of interacting fermions and the complete characterization of Krylov complexity for the hypercube graph in any number of dimensions. The latter serves as the starting point for an in-depth comparison between Krylov and circuit complexities as they purportedly arise in the context of black holes. We find that while under certain conditions Krylov complexity follows the growth and saturation pattern ascribed to such systems, the timescale at which saturation happens can generally be shorter than what is predicted by random unitary circuits, due to the effects of quantum speed-ups commonly occurring when comparing quantum and classical random walks.
