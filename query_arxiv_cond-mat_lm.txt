Title: Observation of a generalized Gibbs ensemble in photonics
Authors: Alvise Bastianello, Alexey Tikan, Francois Copie, Stephane Randoux, Pierre Suret
Abstract: In generic classical and quantum many-body systems, where typically energy and particle number are the only conserved quantities, stationary states are described by thermal equilibrium. In contrast, integrable systems showcase an infinite hierarchy of conserved quantities that inhibits conventional thermalization, forcing relaxation to a Generalized Gibbs Ensemble (GGE), a concept first introduced in quantum many-body physics. In this study, we provide experimental evidence for the emergence of a GGE in a photonic system. By investigating partially coherent waves propagating in a normal dispersion optical fiber, governed by the one-dimensional defocusing nonlinear Schroedinger equation, we directly measure the density of states of the spectral parameter (rapidity) to confirm the time invariance of the full set of conserved charges. We also observe the relaxation of optical power statistics to the GGE's theoretical prediction, obtained using the experimentally measured density of states. These complementary measurements unambiguously establish the formation of a GGE in our photonic platform, highlighting its potential as a powerful tool for probing many-body integrability and bridging classical and quantum integrable systems.

Title: Impact of UC2, UC, UBC and UB2 target compositions on the release of fission products
Authors: Julien Guillot, Brigitte Roussiere, Sandrine Tusseau-Nenez, Isabelle Deloncle, Martin Humenny, Matthieu Lebois, Jean-Francois Ledu, Jerome Roques, Francois Brisset
Abstract: The release properties of 4 targets (UC2, UC, UBC, UB2) were measured for 11 elements (Kr, Sr, Ru, Sn, Sb, Te, I, Cs, Ba, La, and Ce) using an off-line technique. The crystal packing fraction and the size of the studied element play a key role in the release process. However, physicochemical properties are also involved, notably melting and boiling points in vacuum and the minimal oxidation state. Principal component analysis was used to investigate the interrelationships between the physicochemical properties of fission products (from Fe to Dy) and the observed releases, thereby enabling predictions to be made about the release properties of the four crystallic configurations for elements that are inaccessible in off-line experiments.

Title: Ergodic behaviors in reversible 3-state cellular automata
Authors: Rustem Sharipov, Matija Koterle, Sašo Grozdanov, Tomaž Prosen
Abstract: Classical cellular automata represent a class of explicit discrete spacetime lattice models in which complex large-scale phenomena emerge from simple deterministic rules. With the goal to uncover different physically distinct classes of ergodic behavior, we perform a systematic study of three-state cellular automata (with a stable `vacuum' state and `particles' with $\pm$ charges). The classification is aided by the automata's different transformation properties under discrete symmetries: charge conjugation, spatial parity and time reversal. In particular, we propose a simple classification that distinguishes between types and levels of ergodic behavior in such system as quantified by the following observables: the mean return time, the number of conserved quantities, and the scaling of correlation functions. In each of the physically distinct classes, we present examples and discuss some of their phenomenology. This includes chaotic or ergodic dynamics, phase-space fragmentation, Ruelle-Pollicott resonances, existence of quasilocal charges, and anomalous transport with a variety of dynamical exponents.

Title: Surface properties of Co$_2$MnAl Heusler alloy
Authors: Amar Kumar, Sujeet Chaudhary, Sharat Chandra
Abstract: Using the plane-wave pseudopotential method within the framework of density functional theory, Co$_2$MnAl (100), (110), and (111) surfaces with different atomic terminations have been studied in the context of some key spintronics properties, viz., surface energy, half-metallicity, magnetization, and magnetic anisotropy. The present study reveals that the MnAl-(100), Co-Al-(111), and Al-(111) surfaces exhibit negative surface energies over a wide range of chemical potentials, indicating their strong structural stability. The MnAl-(100), CoCoMnAl-(110), and Co-Mn-(111) surfaces maintain the nearly half-metallic nature like the bulk-Co$_2$MnAl, while this nearly half-metallic nature even improved for the Al-(111) surface. In contrast, the rest of the considered surfaces, CoCo-(100), Co-Al-(111) and Mn-(111) surfaces, display the strong metallic nature. Magnetization is enhanced for most surface configurations, except for Al-(111), where it decreases due to reduced moments of the exterior atoms. Regarding magnetic anisotropy, only the MnAl-(100) and Co-Mn-(111) surfaces exhibit the positive magneto-crystalline anisotropy of $\sim$0.23 and $\sim$0.33 mJ/m2, respectively. All these findings suggest that the Co-Mn-(111) and MnAl-(100) surfaces are quite appealing for spintronics applications, considering the structural stability, electronic properties, and magnetic anisotropy.

Title: Strain-tunable anomalous Hall plateau in antiferromagnet CoNb$_3$S$_6$
Authors: Long Chen, Richard Lai, Shashi Pandey, Dapeng Cui, Alexander Brassington, Jian Liu, Haidong Zhou
Abstract: Antiferromagnets exhibiting the anomalous Hall effect represent a fascinating convergence of magnetism, topology, and electronic structure. Identifying antiferromagnets with large and tunable anomalous Hall effects is crucial for the development of spintronic applications. Here, we report a strain-tunable anomalous Hall plateau in CoNb$_3$S$_6$, which is a prime candidate for altermagnetism. The plateau emerges as a flat extended intermediate step of the anomalous Hall hysteresis loop with a controllable step height with temperature and strain. The remarkable tunability of the plateau position is in contrast with typical magnetic plateau associated with a field-induced metastable magnetic structure, but indicates the existence of a hidden phase transition that significantly alters the magnetic anisotropy energy without changing the magnetic order. The symmetry analysis of the strain tuning suggests that the hidden phase preserves the rotational symmetry of the ab-plane. Our results show the plateau reflects the phase coexistence during the hidden transition, and anomalous Hall resistivity of the plateau is thus non-volatile, enabling a novel four-state switching of the anomalous Hall effect.

Title: Electronic structure of a layered altermagnetic compound CoNb4Se8
Authors: Anup Pradhan Sakhya, Mazharul Islam Mondal, Milo Sprague, Resham Babu Regmi, Arun K Kumay, Himanshu Sheokand, Igor. I. Mazin, Nirmal J. Ghimire, Madhab Neupane
Abstract: Recently, there has been a growing interest in altermagnetism, a novel form of magnetism, characterized by unique spin-splitting even in the absence of both net magnetic moments and spin-orbit coupling. Despite numerous theoretical predictions, experimental evidence of such spin-splitting in real materials remains limited. In this study, we use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the electronic band structure of the altermagnet candidate CoNb4Se8. This material features an ordered sublattice of intercalated Co atoms within NbSe2 layers. Magnetization and electrical resistivity measurements reveal the onset of antiferromagnetism below 168 K. Temperature dependent ARPES data, supported by DFT calculations, uncover spin split bands along the MGM high-symmetry direction. The observation of spin splitting in this high temperature altermagnet opens new avenues for exploring its electronic properties and potential applications in spintronic technologies.

Title: Atomic Origins of Magnetic Anisotropy in Ru-substituted Manganite Films
Authors: Brajagopal Das, Cinthia Piamonteze, Lior Kornblum
Abstract: Magnetic anisotropy in complex oxides often originates from the complex interplay of several factors, including crystal structure, spin-orbit coupling, and electronic interactions. Recent studies on Ru-substituted $La_{0.70}Sr_{0.30}MnO_3$ (Ru-LSMO) films demonstrate emerging magnetic and magneto-transport properties, where magnetic anisotropy plays a crucial role. However, the atomic origin and underlying mechanisms of the magnetic anisotropy of this material system remain elusive. This work sheds light on these aspects. Detailed element-specific X-ray magnetic dichroism analysis suggests that Ru single ion anisotropy governs the overall magnetic anisotropy. Furthermore, the magnetic property of Mn ions changes dramatically due to strong antiferromagnetic coupling between Ru and Mn ions. Our findings clarify the role of Ru single ion anisotropy behind magnetic anisotropy in Ru-LSMO, offering a promising avenue for designing advanced materials with tailored magnetic properties for next generation magnetic and spintronic technologies. As the Curie temperature of these materials is close to room temperature, such tunable magnetic anisotropy holds prospects for functional room-temperature magnetic devices.

Title: Stabilizing open photon condensates by ghost-attractor dynamics
Authors: Aya Abouelela, Michael Turaev, Roman Kramer, Moritz Janning, Michael Kajan, Sayak Ray, Johann Kroha
Abstract: We study the temporal, driven-dissipative dynamics of open photon Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) in a dye-filled microcavity, taking the condensate amplitude and the noncondensed fluctuations into account on the same footing by means of a cumulant expansion within the Lindblad formalism. The fluctuations fundamentally alter the dynamics in that the BEC always dephases to zero for sufficiently long time. However, a ghost-attractor, although it is outside of the physically accessible configuration space, attracts the dynamics and leads to a plateau-like stabilization of the BEC for an exponentially long time, consistent with experiments. We also show that the photon BEC and the lasing state are separated by a true phase transition, since they are characterized by different fixed points. The ghost-attractor nonequilibrium stabilization mechanism is alternative to prethermalization and may possibly be realized on other dynamical platforms as well.

Title: Sub-singularities for shaping thin sheets
Authors: Thomas A. Witten, Anna Movsheva
Abstract: The principles behind the sharp, singular structures in a crumpled sheet are well understood. Here we discuss more general ways of exploiting such sharp structures to control the shape of a sheet by deforming or forcing it elsewhere. Often, the induced shape leads to further sharp structures -- ``sub-singularities". Though weaker and softer than the primary singularities, they nevertheless provide robust ways of shaping a sheet. In simple cases we understand the reason for these and their strength. This paper surveys a broad range of other sub-structure phenomena and reports recent progress in understanding some of them.

Title: Lower limit of percolation threshold on a square lattice with complex neighborhoods
Authors: Antoni Ciepłucha, Marcin Utnicki, Maciej Wołoszyn, Krzysztof Malarz
Abstract: In this paper, the 60-year-old concept of long-range interaction in percolation problems introduced by Dalton, Domb, and Sykes, is reconsidered. With Monte Carlo simulation -- based on Newman-Ziff algorithm and finite-size scaling hypothesis -- we estimate 64 percolation thresholds for random site percolation problem on a square lattice with neighborhoods that contain sites from the 7th coordination zone. The percolation thresholds obtained range from 0.27013 (for the neighborhood that contains only sites from the 7th coordination zone) to 0.11535 (for the neighborhood that contains all sites from the 1st to the 7th coordination zone). Similarly to neighborhoods with smaller ranges, the power-law dependence of the percolation threshold on the effective coordination number with exponent close to -1/2 is observed. Finally, we empirically determine the limit of the percolation threshold on square lattices with complex neighborhoods. This limit scales with the inverse square of the mean radius of the neighborhood. The boundary of this limit is touched for threshold values associated with extended (compact) neighborhoods.

Title: Perturbing finite temperature multicomponent DFT 1D Kohn-Sham systems: Peierls Gap & Kohn Anomaly
Authors: Adrian D. Scheppe, Michael V. Pak
Abstract: One of the greatest challenges when designing new technologies that make use of non-trivial quantum materials is the difficulty associated with predicting material-specific properties, such as critical temperature, gap parameter, etc. There is naturally a great amount of interest in these types of condensed matter systems because of their application to quantum sensing, quantum electronics, and quantum computation; however, they are exceedingly difficult to address from first principles because of the famous many-body problem. For this reason, a full electron-nuclear quantum calculation will likely remain completely out of reach for the foreseeable future. A practical alternative is provided by finite temperature, multi component density functional theory (MCDFT), which is a formally exact method of computing the equilibrium state energy of a many-body quantum system. In this work, we use this construction alongside a perturbative scheme to demonstrate that the phenomena Peierls effect and Kohn Anomaly are both natural features of the KS equations without additional structure needed. We find the temperature dependent ionic density for a simple 1D lattice which is then used to derive the ionic densities temperature dependent affect on the electronic band structure. This is accomplished by Fourier transforming the ionic density term found within this KS electronic equation. Using the Peierls effect phonon distortion gap openings in relation to the Fermi level, we then perturb the KS ionic equation with a conduction electron density, deriving the Kohn Anomaly. This provides a workable predictive strategy for interesting electro-phonon related material properties which could be extended to 2D and 3D real materials while retaining the otherwise complicated temperature dependence.

Title: Entropy of strongly correlated electrons in a partially filled Landau level
Authors: Alexandre Assouline, Taige Wang, Heun Mo Yoo, Ruihua Fan, Fangyuan Yang, Ruining Zhang, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Michael P. Zaletel, Andrea F. Young
Abstract: We use high-resolution chemical potential measurements to extract the entropy of monolayer and bilayer graphene in the quantum Hall regime via the Maxwell relation $\left.\frac{d\mu}{dT}\right|_N = -\left.\frac{dS}{dN}\right|_T$. Measuring the entropy from $T=300$K down to $T=200$mK, we identify the sequential emergence of quantum Hall ferromagnetism, fractional quantum Hall states (FQH), and various charge orders by comparing the measured entropy in different temperature regimes with theoretical models. At the lowest temperature of $T \approx 200$mK we perform a detailed study of the entropy near even-denominator fractional quantum Hall states in bilayer graphene, and comment on the possible topological origin of the observed excess entropy.

Title: Partition function for position-dependent mass systems from superestatistics
Authors: Ignacio S. Gomez, Matheus Gabriel Alves Santos, Daniela de Almeida dos Santos, Ronaldo Thibes
Abstract: In this work, we show a connection between superstatistics and position-dependent mass (PDM) systems in the context of the canonical ensemble. The key point is to set the fluctuation distribution of the inverse temperature in terms od the system PDM. For PDMs associated to Tsallis and Kaniadakis nonextensive statistics, the pressure and entropy of the ideal gas result lower than the standard case but maintaining monotonic behavior. Gas of non-interacting harmonic oscillators provided with quadratic and exponential PDMs exhibit a behavior of standard ED harmonic oscillator gas and a linear specific heat respectively, the latter being consistent with Nernst's third law of thermodynamics. Thus, a combined PDM-superstatistics scenario offers an alternative way to study the effects of the inhomogeneities of PDM systems in their thermodynamics.

Title: Single-Shot Magnetization Reversal in Ferromagnetic Spin Valves Enabled by Heat Control
Authors: Kazuaki Ishibashi, Junta Igarashi, Alberto Anadón, Michel Hehn, Yann Le Guen, Satoshi Iihama, Julius Hohlfeld, Jon Gorchon, Stéphane Mangin, Grégory Malinowski
Abstract: We study laser-induced ultrafast magnetization reversal in ferromagnetic spin valve by comparing the effect of a direct laser excitation and an ultrashort hot-electron pulse. A wedged Cu layer is grown on top of the spin valve in order to tune the energy transmission to the magnetic stack, for both optical and hot-electron pulses. We demonstrate single-pulse magnetization reversal of the free layer by a hot-electron pulse. The influence of laser fluence, Cu thickness ($t_{\mathrm{Cu}}$), and pulse duration is investigated in detail. These results suggest that free layer heating plays a significant role in magnetization reversal. This work contributes to the understanding of ultrafast magnetization reversal due to nonlocal heat and spin transport occurring under strongly out-of-equilibrium conditions.

Title: Valley-dependent giant orbital moments and transport feature in rhombohedral graphene multilayers
Authors: X. Mu, J. Zhou
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a great interest in orbital related electronics (also termed as orbitronics). In the current work, we present a first-principles density functional theory calculation on the orbital magnetic moments, intrinsic orbital Hall effect, and ordinary magnetoconductivity effects in rhombohedral graphene multilayers. Our calculations suggest a giant orbital moment that arises from inter-atomic cycloid motion, reaching over 30 muB under an intermediate gate voltage. This leads to a valley polarization under an external magnetic field, as observed in recent experiments [Nature 623, 41-47 (2023)]. In addition, the orbital-related transport feature exhibit significant responses that are potentially observed in experiments. We also suggest that under a periodic field driven (such as high frequency light field), the ungated graphene multilayers could host strong quantum anomalous and orbital Hall effects, engineered by the layer number. As the graphene multilayers are intrinsically nonmagnetic with negligible spin-orbit coupling, the orbital moments would not be entangled by spin-related signals. Thus, they serve as an ideal platform to conduct orbitronic measurements and utilization for next generation information read/write nanodevices.

Title: Unraveling phase transformation with phononic hyperbolicity using off-resonant terahertz light
Authors: H. Cui, J. Zhou
Abstract: Noncontacting and nondestructive control of geometric phase in conventional semiconductors plays a pivotal role in various applications. In the current work, we present a theoretical and computational investigation on terahertz (THz) light-induced phase transformation of conventional binary semiconducting compounds among different structures including rock-salt, zinc-blende, wurtzite, and hexagonal phases. Using MgS and MgSe as prototypical examples, we perform anharmonic phonon mediated calculations and reveal large contrasting lattice contributed dielectric susceptibility in the THz regime. We then construct a THz-induced phase diagram under intermediate temperature and reveal rock-salt to hexagonal and then wurtzite structure transformations with increasing light intensity. This does not require a high temperature environment as observed in traditional experiments. The low energy barrier suggests that the phase transition kinetics can be fast, and the stable room temperature phonon dispersions guarantee their non-volatile nature. Furthermore, we disclose the phononic hyperbolicity with strong anisotropic THz susceptibility components, which serves as a natural hyperbolic material with negative refractive index. Our work suggests the potential to realize metastable hidden phases using noninvasive THz irradiation, which expands the conventional pressure-temperature ($P-T$) phase diagram by adding light as an additional control factor.

Title: Multi-property directed generative design of inorganic materials through Wyckoff-augmented transfer learning
Authors: Shuya Yamazaki, Wei Nong, Ruiming Zhu, Kostya S. Novoselov, Andrey Ustyuzhanin, Kedar Hippalgaonkar
Abstract: Accelerated materials discovery is an urgent demand to drive advancements in fields such as energy conversion, storage, and catalysis. Property-directed generative design has emerged as a transformative approach for rapidly discovering new functional inorganic materials with multiple desired properties within vast and complex search spaces. However, this approach faces two primary challenges: data scarcity for functional properties and the multi-objective optimization required to balance competing tasks. Here, we present a multi-property-directed generative framework designed to overcome these limitations and enhance site symmetry-compliant crystal generation beyond P1 (translational) symmetry. By incorporating Wyckoff-position-based data augmentation and transfer learning, our framework effectively handles sparse and small functional datasets, enabling the generation of new stable materials simultaneously conditioned on targeted space group, band gap, and formation energy. Using this approach, we identified previously unknown thermodynamically and lattice-dynamically stable semiconductors in tetragonal, trigonal, and cubic systems, with bandgaps ranging from 0.13 to 2.20 eV, as validated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Additionally, we assessed their thermoelectric descriptors using DFT, indicating their potential suitability for thermoelectric applications. We believe our integrated framework represents a significant step forward in generative design of inorganic materials.

Title: Photoinduced phase transitions and lattice deformation in 2D NbOX$_{2}$ (X=Cl, Br, I)
Authors: Carmel Dansou, Charles Paillard, Laurent Bellaiche
Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation of light-induced phase transitions and strain in two-dimensional NbOX$_{2}$ (X = Cl, Br, I) using first-principles calculations. In particular, we identify a light-induced ferroelectric-to-paraelectric phase transition in these 2D systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate the possibility of inducing an antiferroelectric-to-paraelectric transition under illumination. Additionally, we find that these 2D systems exhibit significant photostrictive behavior, adding a new functionality to their already notable optical properties. The ability to control and manipulate ferroelectric order in these nanoscale materials through external stimuli, such as light, holds considerable promise for the development of next-generation electronic and optoelectronic devices.

Title: Finite-time scaling with two characteristic time scales: Driven critical dynamics with emergent symmetry
Authors: Yu-Rong Shu, Li-Ying Yang, Shuai Yin
Abstract: Critical points with emergent symmetry exhibit intriguing scaling properties induced by two divergent length scales, attracting extensive investigations recently. We study the driven critical dynamics in a three-dimensional $q$-state clock model, in which the ordered phase breaks the $Z_q$ discrete symmetry, while an emergent $U(1)$ symmetry appears at the critical point. By increasing the temperature at a finite velocity $v$ to traverse the critical point from the ordered phase, we uncover rich dynamic scaling properties beyond the celebrated Kibble-Zurek mechanism. Our findings reveal the existence of two finite-time scaling (FTS) regions, characterized by two driving-induced time scales $\zeta_d\propto v^{-z/r}$ and $\zeta_d'\propto v^{-z/r'}$, respectively. Here $z$ is the dynamic exponent, $r$ is the usual critical exponent of $v$, and $r'$ represents an additional critical exponent of $v$ associated with the dangerously irrelevant scaling variable. While the square of the order parameter $M^2$ obeys the usual FTS form, the angular order parameter $\phi_q$ shows remarkably distinct scaling behaviors controlled by both FTS regions. For small $v$, $\phi_q$ is dominated by the time scale $\zeta_d$, whereas for large $v$, $\phi_q$ is governed by the second time scale $\zeta_d'$. We verify the universality of these scaling properties in models with both isotropic and anisotropic couplings. Our theoretical insights provide a promising foundation for further experimental investigations in the hexagonal RMnO$_3$ (R=rare earth) materials.

Title: Opening and closing a bandgap via alternating softening and hardening nonlinearities
Authors: Weijian Jiao
Abstract: Recent studies have shown some unusual nonlinear dispersion behaviors that are disconnected from the linear regime. However, existing analytical techniques, such as perturbation methods, fail to correctly capture these behaviors. Here we propose a general theoretical approach that converts the nonlinear wave equation to an equivalent linear eigenvalue problem, which directly gives the nonlinear dispersion relation and modal vectors. The theoretical approach is employed to 1D phononic chains and 2D hexagonal lattices with alternating softening and hardening nonlinearities, revealing amplitude-induced bandgap opening and closing phenomena. The theoretical results are validated via full-scale simulations with periodic boundary conditions, in which steady-state nonlinear plane wave responses are numerically obtained. Moreover, we leverage these nonlinear phenomena to achieve tunable frequency splitting and focusing effects. Thus, our work opens new paradigms for understanding nonlinear wave physics and for achieving novel wave control capabilities.

Title: Nuclear magnetic resonance investigation of strain-tuned iron-based superconductors (Druckabhängige Untersuchung eisenbasierter Supraleiter mittels Kernspinresonanz)
Authors: Adam P. Dioguardi
Abstract: Final report for a Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Eigenestelle Grant, summarizing work mainly on uniaxial-pressure-dependent nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) investigations of BaFe$_2$As$_2$. We have conducted systematic $^{75}$As NMR experiments in BaFe$_2$As$_2$ under in-situ controlled conditions of uniaxial pressure. We find that the electric field gradient (EFG), spin--lattice relaxation rate T$_1^{-1}$, spin--spin relaxation rate T$_2^{-1}$, and Knight shift $K$ at the As site are sensitive to applied uniaxial pressure. These properties allow us to locally probe the nematic susceptibility, as well as orbital and spin degrees of freedom. Our spectral measurements in the magnetic state provide no evidence for spin reorientation below the T$_N$ for both positive and negative applied uniaxial pressure up to the point of sample failure.

Title: Topological blocking at the Bi(111) surface due to surface relaxation
Authors: Kazuki Koie, Rikako Yaguchi, Yuki Fuseya
Abstract: The topological characteristics of Bi and its alloys with Sb have fueled intense debate since the prediction of three-dimensional topological insulators. However, a definitive resolution has not been reached to date. Here, we provide theoretical evidence that surface relaxation conceals the underlying bulk topology of pure Bi. Using density functional theory calculations for thin Bi(111) films (up to 17 bilayers), we first demonstrate a substantial inter-bilayer expansion near the surface. Motivated by this finding, we extend our analysis to thick Bi(111) films (up to 250 bilayers) incorporating relaxation layers, within the framework of a relativistic empirical tight-binding model. Our results reveal that these relaxation layers topologically block the emergence of surface state and significantly suppress the one-particle spectrum of surface states, thereby obscuring the experimental identification of Bi's topological properties. This phenomenon, which we term "topological blocking", provides crucial insights into the long-standing difficulty of observing surface states of Bi(111) at the $\bar{M}$ point. Furthermore, it establishes a framework for understanding and predicting the topological behavior in systems where surface relaxation disrupts the bulk-edge correspondence.

Title: Giant Self Spin-Valve Effect in the Kagome Helimagnet
Authors: Xitong Xu, Yonglai Liu, Kesen Zhao, Che-Min Lin, Miao He, Haitian Zhao, Qingqi Zeng, Yubin Hou, Qingyou Lu, Ding-Fu Shao, Shuang Jia, Haifeng Du, Wenjie Meng, Tay-Rong Chang, Zhe Qu
Abstract: Kagome magnets can combine non-trivial band topology and electron correlations, offering a versatile playground for various quantum phenomena. In this work we propose that kagome magnets with frustrated interlayer interactions can intrinsically support a self spin-valve effect, and experimentally confirm this in the kagome helimagnet TmMn$_6$Sn$_6$. Under a magnetic field perpendicular to the helical axis, using magnetic force microscopy we observed stripe domains that stack strictly along the helical axis, which we attribute to the stability loss of the kagome helimagnetic state. Such a domain pattern spontaneously mimics the artificial multilayered structure in traditional spin valves, which, combined with the high spin polarization, leads to a giant magnetoresistance (GMR) ratio over 160%. This discovery opens an avenue to realize inherent spin valves in a variety of quantum magnets, and can hold promise in future spintronics.

Title: Non-Lorentzian model for strong exciton-plasmon coupling
Authors: Tigran V. Shahbazyan
Abstract: We develop a non-Lorentzian approach for quantum emitters (QE) resonantly coupled to localized surface plasmons (LSP) in metal-dielectric structures. Using the exact LSP Green function, we derive non-Lorentzian version of Maxwell-Bloch equations which describe LSP in terms of metal complex dielectric function rather than via Lorentzian resonances. For a single QE coupled to the LSP, we obtain an explicit expression for the system effective optical polarizability which, in the Lorentzian approximation, recovers the classical coupled oscillator (CO) model. We demonstrate that non-Lorentzian effects originating from the temporal dispersion of metal dielectric function affect dramatically the optical spectra as the system transitions to the strong coupling regime. Specifically, in contrast to Lorentzian models, the main spectral weight is shifted towards the lower energy polaritonic band, consistent with the experiment.

Title: A nonlinear model of shearable elastic rod from an origami-like microstructure displaying folding and faulting
Authors: M. Paradiso, F. Dal Corso, D. Bigoni
Abstract: A new continuous model of shearable rod, subject to large elastic deformation, is derived from nonlinear homogenization of a one-dimensional periodic microstructured chain. As particular cases, the governing equations reduce to the Euler elastica and to the shearable elastica known as 'Engesser', that has been scarcely analysed so far. The microstructure that is homogenized is made up of elastic hinges and four-bar linkages, which may be realized in practice using origami joints. The equivalent continuous rod is governed by a Differential-Algebraic system of nonlinear Equations (DAE), containing an internal length ratio, and showing a surprisingly rich mechanical landscape, which involves a twin sequence of bifurcation loads, separated by a 'transition' mode. The latter occurs, for simply supported and cantilever rods in a 'bookshelf-like' mode and in a mode involving faulting (formation of a step in displacement), respectively. The postcritical response of the simply supported rod exhibits the emergence of folding, an infinite curvature occurring at a point of the rod axis, developing into a curvature jump at increasing load. Faulting and folding, excluded for both Euler and Reissner models and so far unknown in the rod theory, represent 'signatures' revealing the origami design of the microstructure. These two features are shown to be associated with bifurcations and, in particular folding, with a secondary bifurcation of the corresponding discrete chain when the number of elements is odd. Beside the intrinsic theoretical relevance to the field of structural mechanics, our results can be applied to various technological contexts involving highly compliant mechanisms, such as the achievement of objective trajectories with soft robot arms through folding and localized displacement of origami-inspired or multi-material mechanisms.

Title: A formally exact real-space representation of the Berry phase on infinite lattices: Applications to dipole and quadrupole moments
Authors: Y. Onaya, F. Hamano, T. Fukui
Abstract: Inspired by Kitaev's real-space representation of Chern numbers, we develop a real-space formulation of the Berry phase for infinite lattices. While the well-known Resta formula for the Berry phase is defined under periodic boundary conditions for finite lattices, our approach constructs the Berry phase directly on an infinite lattice without requiring momentum-space discretization. We apply this method to several disordered models to examine its validity. Furthermore, we attempt to generalize the real-space representation to the quadrupole moment, drawing an analogy to the generalization of the Resta formula for the quadrupole moment.

Title: Current-induced Zero Resistance in Trigonal Fulde-Ferrell Superconductors
Authors: Akito Daido, Youichi Yanase, Kam Tuen Law
Abstract: Current-induced zero resistance (CIZR) in twisted trilayer graphene/WSe$_2$ has posed a theoretical challenge, as it goes beyond understanding of the existing theories of critical current and superconducting diode effect. In this Letter, we demonstrate that CIZR can be understood based on three-fold (near-)degenerate Fulde-Ferrell states, by studying a minimal tight-binding model on a triangular lattice with valley polarization and trigonal warping. We ellucidate that Fulde-Ferrell states are stabilized due to broken two-fold rotational symmetry, making an exception to the common belief that Larkin-Ovchinnikov states are stable in most cases. After establishing the thermodynamic phase diagram in electric current, we propose a scenario that predicts nonreciprocal and reciprocal CIZR in the presence of domains of different Fulde-Ferrell states. The triangular finite-momentum state is also predicted, unraveling another fascinating aspect of valley-polarized superconductors.

Title: Tunable Magneto-optical Kerr effect in two-dimensional non-collinear antiferromagnetic material HfFeCl6
Authors: Di Zhou, Ning Ding, Haoshen Ye, Shuai Dong, Shan-Shan Wang
Abstract: With the development of two-dimensional (2D) magnetic materials, magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) is widely used to measure ferromagnetism in 2D systems. Although this effect is usually inactive in antiferromagnets (AFM), recent theoretical studies have demonstrated that the presence of MOKE relies on the symmetry of the system and antiferromagnets with noncollinear magnetic order can also induce a significant MOKE signal even without a net magnetization. However, this phenomenon is rarely studied in 2D systems due to a scarcity of appropriate materials hosting noncollinear AFM order. Here, based on first-principles calculations, we investigate the HfFeCl6 monolayer with noncollinear Y-AFM ground states, which simultaneously breaks the time-reversal (T) and time-inversion (TI) symmetry, activating the MOKE even though with zero net magnetic moment. In addition, four different MOKE spectra can be obtained in the four permutation states of spin chirality and crystal chirality. The MOKE spectra are switchable when reversing both crystal and spin chirality. Our study provides a material platform to explore the MOKE effect and can potentially be used for electrical readout of AFM states.

Title: Thermodynamically consistent lattice Monte Carlo method for active particles
Authors: Ki-Won Kim, Euijoon Kwon, Yongjoo Baek
Abstract: Recent years have seen a growing interest in the thermodynamic cost of dissipative structures formed by active particles. Given the strong finite-size effects of such systems, it is essential to develop efficient numerical approaches that discretize both space and time while preserving the original dynamics and thermodynamics of active particles in the continuum limit. To address this challenge, we propose two thermodynamically consistent kinetic Monte Carlo methods for active lattice gases, both of which correctly reproduce the continuum dynamics. One method follows the conventional Kawasaki dynamics, while the other incorporates an extra state-dependent prefactor in the transition rate to more accurately capture the self-propulsion velocity. We find that the error scales linearly with time step size and that the state-dependent prefactor improves accuracy at high Péclet numbers by a factor of $\mathrm{Pe}^2$. Our results are supported by rigorous proof of convergence as well as extensive simulations.

Title: Designing Non-Relativistic Spin Splitting in Oxide Perovskites
Authors: Subhadeep Bandyopadhyay, Silvia Picozzi, Sayantika Bhowal
Abstract: We investigate the role of atomic distortions in non-relativistic spin splitting in perovskite oxides with Pbnm symmetry. Using LaMnO3 as a representative material, we analyze its non-relativistic spin splitting through a combined phonon and multipolar analysis. Our study provides key insights into how structural distortions and magnetic ordering drive ferroically ordered magnetic multipoles, which, in turn, give rise to non-relativistic spin splitting. Based on these findings, we propose three strategies for engineering non-relativistic spin splitting: modifying the A-site cation size, strain engineering, and electric field control in superlattice structures. Our work establishes a framework for designing non-relativistic spin splitting in the Brillouin zone of oxide perovskites.

Title: Anyon braiding on the single edge of a fractional quantum Hall state
Authors: Flavio Ronetti, Noé Demazure, Jérôme Rech, Thibaut Jonckheere, Benôit Grémaud, Laurent Raymond, Masayuki Hashisaka, Takeo Kato, Thierry Martin
Abstract: Anyons are quasiparticles with fractional statistics, bridging between fermions and bosons. We propose an experimental setup to measure the statistical angle of topological anyons emitted from a quantum point contact (QPC) source. The setup involves an droplet along a fractional quantum Hall liquid edge, formed by defining a droplet with two negatively biased gates. In the weak tunneling regime, we calculate the charge current, showing its time evolution depends solely on the anyons' statistical properties, with temperature and scaling dimension affecting only the constant prefactor. We compute the cross-correlation between the anyon current transmitted from the source and the current after the junction, providing a direct method to detect anyon braiding statistics.

Title: Fluctuations of local plastic strain in granular media
Authors: I. Awada, M. Bornert, V. Langlois, J. Léopoldès
Abstract: We experimentally study the heterogeneity of strain in a granular medium subjected to oscillatory shear in a rotating drum. Two complementary methods are used. The first method relies on optical imaging and grain tracking, allowing us to compute some components of the strain tensor and their variance. The second method, Diffusive Acoustic Wave Spectroscopy (DAWS), provides the variance of strain components within the bulk. Our results show that strain is spatially heterogeneous, with fluctuations about ten times larger than the mean, primarily dominated by variability at the grain scale. We then analyze in detail the strain fluctuations occurring during the forward and backward branches of the shear cycles, as well as the plastic strain at the completion of each cycle. Both methods reveal that each shear cycle consists of two consecutive diffusive-like branches, and that the resulting plastic strain fluctuations grow linearly with shear. We propose a simple framework to rationalize these effects, suggesting that plastic strain fluctuations increase with the diffusion coefficient and decrease with the anticorrelation between forward and backward strain, which is enhanced in denser packings.

Title: Wall torque controls curvature-driven propulsion in bacterial baths

Abstract: The persistent dynamics of active particles makes them explore extended portions of an obstacle's boundary during collisions. From impact to escape, the net applied forces depend on the curvature of the wall and increase in the presence of concave features. Here we systematically investigate the forces exerted by swimming bacteria on microfabricated structures, where the radii of curvature can be varied parametrically. We find that these micro-sails are propelled with a speed that scales linearly with curvature and is directed from concave to convex side along the axis of symmetry. By solving the collision problem for microswimmers with aligning torque interactions, we demonstrate that, unlike spherical active particles, curvature mainly affects cell orientation during sliding, leading to greater normal thrust on the concave side and an net applied thrust that scales linearly with curvature.

Title: Voltage-Controlled Rotation of Magnetic Anisotropy in the Ni90Fe10/BaTiO3(001) Heterostructure
Authors: A. Begué, M. W. Khaliq, N. Cotón, I. Lorenzo-Feijoo, M. A. Niño, M. Foerster, R. Ranchal
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate the voltage control of magnetic anisotropy in a strain-mediated Ni90Fe10/BaTiO3(001) heterostructure. In the pristine state of the heterostructure, the Magneto-Optical Kerr Effect measurements show a transcritical hysteresis loop for the Ni90Fe10 film, indicating a weak perpendicular anisotropy. This was further confirmed by X-ray Magnetic Circular Dichroism - Photoemission Electron Microscopy, revealing stripe domains in this film. X-ray diffraction analysis of the BaTiO3 substrate under varying electric fields was used to analyze the orientation of ferroelectric domains. These results indicated that BaTiO3 exhibits two distinct states depending on the applied electric field: one with domains aligned with the electric field and another with random domain orientation when the field is removed. After substrate poling, the Ni90Fe10 layer switches from weak perpendicular anisotropy to an in-plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy, with the in-plane direction of anisotropy being controllable by 90° through an electric field. This effect is due to an efficient strain transfer from BaTiO3 to the Ni90Fe10 lattice, induced by ferroelectric polarization, as shown by XRD. Remarkably, this rotation of the magnetic anisotropy leads to an enhanced converse magnetoelectric coupling value of 1.43 {\mu}s/m, surpassing previously reported values for other BaTiO3-based heterostructures by an order of magnitude. These results emphasize the potential of Ni90Fe10 alloys for next-generation magnetoelectric devices.

Title: High-performance Andreev interferometer-based electronic coolers
Authors: Francesco Cioni, Fabio Taddei
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an electronic refrigerator based on a ballistic Andreev interferometer that allows to reach a maximum cooling power per channel up to five orders of magnitude larger than that of the conventional normal metal-insulator-superconductor cooler. This effect is achieved by exploiting the destructive interference that occurs when the superconducting phase difference equals $\pi$. This results in a strongly suppressed charge current below the superconducting gap, while still allowing the extraction of excitations above the gap, leading to a cooler with enhanced performance. Interestingly, we find that such a large cooling power per channel enables the achievement of an electronic temperature close to the theoretical lower bound. Additionally, we derive an approximate expression for this bound in the regime of low bath temperatures. Finally, we propose potential implementations of the ballistic Andreev interferometer cooler using semiconductors, graphene, and topological insulators.

Title: PINK: physical-informed machine learning for lattice thermal conductivity
Authors: Yujie Liu, Xiaoying Wang, Yuzhou Hao, Xuejie Li, Jun Sun, Turab Lookman, Xiangdong Ding, Zhibin Gao
Abstract: Lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_L$) is crucial for efficient thermal management in electronics and energy conversion technologies. Traditional methods for predicting \k{appa}L are often computationally expensive, limiting their scalability for large-scale material screening. Empirical models, such as the Slack model, offer faster alternatives but require time-consuming calculations for key parameters such as sound velocity and the Gruneisen parameter. This work presents a high-throughput framework, physical-informed kappa (PINK), which combines the predictive power of crystal graph convolutional neural networks (CGCNNs) with the physical interpretability of the Slack model to predict \k{appa}L directly from crystallographic information files (CIFs). Unlike previous approaches, PINK enables rapid, batch predictions by extracting material properties such as bulk and shear modulus from CIFs using a well-trained CGCNN model. These properties are then used to compute the necessary parameters for $\kappa_L$ calculation through a simplified physical formula. PINK was applied to a dataset of 377,221 stable materials, enabling the efficient identification of promising candidates with ultralow $\kappa_L$ values, such as Ag$_3$Te$_4$W and Ag$_3$Te$_4$Ta. The platform, accessible via a user-friendly interface, offers an unprecedented combination of speed, accuracy, and scalability, significantly accelerating material discovery for thermal management and energy conversion applications.

Title: Correlation of the role of Li-doping in control of O-vacancies and Li interstitial formations in NiO with electrochemical properties
Authors: Poonam Singh, P. Maneesha, Manju Kumari, Abdelkrim Mekki, Khalil Harrabi, Somaditya Sen
Abstract: Aliovalent doping in an oxide material introduces modifications in the valence state of the host cation and often leads to tailoring the oxygen content in the lattice. Moreover, if the dopant cation is larger than the host cation, the lattice strain and disorder may be affected. Such changes are expected to modify the electronic clouds and lead to different ligand fields, which in turn should modify the bond lengths, and therefore phonons, electronic properties, transport properties, and charge storage properties. To understand such correlations an example is being investigated in this study by doping a larger Li+ ion in a NiO lattice. The effect on structure, phonons, electronic properties, and charge storage properties are investigated and correlated in a first-of-its-kind report. The charge storage properties are observed to improve with Li+ doping until 3% substitution and thereafter decrease due to the generation of Li+ interstitial in a 6% incorporated sample. The connection of oxygen vacancies and Ni3+ formation with Li+ incorporation is the backbone of this report.

Title: The inconvenient truth about flocks
Authors: Ananyo Maitra, Patrick Jentsch, Leiming Chen, Chiu Fan Lee, John Toner, Sriram Ramaswamy
Abstract: We reanalyze the hydrodynamic theory of "flock" that is, polar ordered "dry" active fluids in two dimensions. For "Malthusian" flocks, in which birth and death cause the density to relax quickly, thereby eliminating density as a hydrodynamic variable, we are able to obtain two exact scaling laws relating the three scaling exponents characterizing the long-distance properties of these systems. We also show that it is highly plausible that such flocks display long-range order in two dimensions. In addition, we demonstrate that for "immortal" flocks, in which the number of flockers is conserved, the extra non-linearities allowed by the presence of an extra slow variable (number density) make it impossible to obtain any exact scaling relations between the exponents. We thereby demonstrate that several past published claims of exact exponents for Malthusian and immortal flocks are all incorrect.

Title: Gate and Carriers tunable Valley Imbalance in Topological Proximitized Rhombohedral Trilayer Graphene
Authors: Sovan Ghosh, Bheema Lingam Chittari
Abstract: We investigated the electronic structure, Fermi surface topology and the emergence of valley imbalance in rhombohedral trilayer graphene (RTG) induced by the topological proximity and the electric fields. We show that, a strong proximity strength isolates the unperturbed low energy bands at the charge neutrality and the isolated topological bands show metallic nature under the influence of applied electric fields. Our calculations indicate that valley-resolved metallic states with a finite Chern number $|C| =$3 can appear near charge neutrality for appropriate electric fields and second-nearest-neighbor strengths. The Fermi surface topology of these metallic bands greatly influenced by the applied electric fields and carrier doping. The valley imbalance lead to the dominant carriers of either $e^-$ or $h^+$ Fermi surface pockets and the choice of carriers is subjected to the direction of electric fields. The gate-tunable and carrier-induced valley imbalance in topologically proximated rhombohedral trilayer graphene may have potential applications toward the realization of superconductivity.

Title: Multi-orbital effects on superconductivity in kagome metals: Parquet renormalization group analysis
Authors: Jae-Ho Han, SungBin Lee
Abstract: The Van Hove singularities (VHSs), where the electronic density of states diverges due to saddle points in the band structure, play a crucial role in enhancing electronic correlations and driving various instabilities. In particular, VHS-induced superconductivity has earned significant attention due to its potential to achieve high transition temperatures and its tendency to favor exotic pairing states beyond conventional electron-phonon mechanisms. Despite extensive research on VHS-driven superconductivity, the multi-orbital effect on such systems remains less explored. Motivated by recent experiments on several kagome metals under doping and pressure [this http URL {\it et al.}, Phys.Rev.B {\bf 103}, 224513 (2021), this http URL {\it et al.}, this http URL. {\bf 14}, 3899 (2023)], we explore the effects of multi-orbital physics and strong correlations induced by VHS in the kagome lattice, focusing on their impact on superconductivity. Using parquet renormalization group analysis, we uncover eight distinct superconducting instabilities, characterized by order parameters with mixed orbital degrees of freedom. Among these, we identify a parameter regime where $d$-wave-like orbital-singlet spin-triplet order parameters dominate as the leading instability. The degenerate spin-triplet states in this regime are capable of breaking time-reversal symmetry, which is a multi-orbital analogue of chiral spin-triplet superconductivity. These findings highlight the interplay between multi-orbital effects on superconductivity and can apply to the kagome metal systems such as $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A$ = K, Rb, Cs) family.

Title: High-throughput study of kagome compounds in the AV3Sb5 family
Authors: Thalis H. B. da Silva, Tiago F. T. Cerqueira, Hai-Chen Wang, Miguel A. L. Marques
Abstract: The kagome lattice has emerged as a fertile ground for exotic quantum phenomena, including superconductivity, charge density waves, and topologically nontrivial states. While AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, Cs) compounds have been extensively studied in this context, the broader AB3C5 family remains largely unexplored. In this work, we employ machine-learning-accelerated, high-throughput density functional theory calculations to systematically investigate the stability and electronic properties of kagome materials derived from atomic substitutions in the AV3Sb5 structure. We identify 36 promising candidates that are thermodynamically stable, with many more close to the convex hull. Stable compounds are not only found with a pnictogen (Sb or Bi) as the C atom but also with Au, Hg, Tl, and Ce. This diverse chemistry opens the way to tune the electronic properties of the compounds. In fact, many of these compounds exhibit Dirac points, Van Hove singularities, or flat bands close to the Fermi level. Our findings provide an array of compounds for experimental synthesis and further theoretical exploration of kagome superconductors beyond the already known systems.

Title: A model of full thermodynamic stabilization of nanocrystalline alloys
Authors: Omar Hussein, Yuri Mishin
Abstract: We propose a model of a polycrystalline alloy combining the Potts model for grain orientations with a lattice-gas model for solute thermodynamics and diffusion. The alloy evolution with this model is implemented by kinetic Monte Carlo simulations with nonlinear transition barriers between the states. The model is applied to investigate the long-standing question of whether grain boundary (GB) segregation of an appropriate solute can drive the GB free energy to zero, creating a fully stabilized polycrystalline state with a finite grain size. The model reproduces stable polycrystalline states under certain conditions, provided the solute-solute interactions are repulsive. The structure minimizing the total free energy is not static. It exists in a state of dynamic equilibrium between the competing processes of grain growth and grain refinement. The alloy eliminates triple junctions by forming a set of smaller grains embedded into a larger matrix grain. It is predicted that, if a fully stabilized nanocrystalline state is implemented experimentally, it will look very different from the conventional (unstable) nanocrystalline materials.

Title: Enhancing Electronic and Optical Properties of $α$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ by Introducing B, Y, and Nb Dopants for Improved Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting
Authors: Abdul Ahad Mamun, Muhammad Anisuzzaman Talukder
Abstract: Advanced theoretical investigations are crucial for understanding the structural growth mechanisms, optoelectronic properties, and photocatalytic activity of photoelectrodes for efficient photoelectrochemical water splitting. In this work, we conducted first-principles calculations aimed at designing $\alpha$-Fe2O3 photoelectrodes incorporating mono-dopants such as boron (B), yttrium (Y), and niobium (Nb), as well as co-dopants (B, Y) and (B, Nb) to enhance the performance of photoelectrochemical cells. We assessed the thermodynamic phase stability by calculating formation enthalpy ($E_f$) and examining material properties, including microstrain ($\mu_\epsilon$) and crystallite size ($D$). The mono-dopants, Y and Nb, and the co-dopants, (B, Y) and (B, Nb), exhibited negative $E_f$ values under the substitutional doping method, confirming their thermodynamic phase stability and suggesting their practical viability for experimental implementation. Notably, the values of $\mu_\epsilon$ and $D$ fell within the ranges observed experimentally for $\alpha$-Fe2O3, indicating their effectiveness in growth mechanisms. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the optoelectronic properties of doped $\alpha$-Fe2O3, we calculated the electronic band structure, density of states, atom's ionic charge, and optical absorption coefficient. This analysis allowed us to examine the improvements in the electronic charge characteristics and photon-electron interactions. B-doped $\alpha$-Fe2O3 led to the formation of impurity bands, which were mitigated by utilizing co-dopants (B, Y) and (B, Nb). The metal dopants, Y and Nb, significantly increased the charge carrier density, while the co-dopants, (B, Y) and (B, Nb), substantially enhanced light absorption in the visible spectrum.

Title: Hearing the shape of a Dirac drum: Dual quantum Hall states on curved surfaces
Authors: Ioachim Dusa, Denis Kochan, Maximilian Fürst, Cosimo Gorini, Klaus Richter
Abstract: The geometry of a physical system is intimately related to its spectral properties, a concept colloquially referred to as "hearing the shape of a drum". Three-dimensional topological insulator nanowires in a strong magnetic field $B$ generally host Dirac-type quantum Hall (QH) surface states. The surface itself is shaped by spatial variations of the wires' cross section, yielding a curved geometrical background, the "drum", with imprints in the corresponding QH spectra. We show that the latter are composed of two different classes. The first one is asymptotically insensitive to the surface shape, scaling as $B^{1/2}$, like regular planar QH states. Instead, the second has an asymptotic $B$-field dependence intimately related to the wire geometry. We further demonstrate that an (axial-symmetric) curved nanowire surface possesses a reciprocal partner surface, such that the respective QH spectra are dual to each other upon exchanging angular momentum and magnetic flux. Notably, a cone-shaped nanowire, and the Corbino geometry as its limiting case, has a reciprocal partner with a dual QH spectrum that is $B$-field independent, with corresponding non-magnetic QH-type states. We support our analytical findings by numerical results for $B$-field ranges and wire geometries within reach of current experiment.

Title: Wafer scale reactive sputter deposition of ferroelectric Al$_{0.6}$Sc$_{0.4}$N from 300 mm AlSc Targets
Authors: Tom-Niklas Kreutzer, Muhammad Zubair Ghori, Md Redwanul Islam, Fabian Lofink, Fabian Stoppel, Axel Müller-Groeling, Simon Fichtner
Abstract: This paper presents progress towards the large-scale manufacturability of piezo- and ferroelectric Al$_{1-x}$Sc$_x$N thin films with very high Sc content. Al$_{0.6}$Sc$_{0.4}$N layers were deposited by reactive sputtering from a 300 mm diameter Al$_{0.6}$Sc$_{0.4}$N target on standard 200 mm Si wafers with Pt bottom- and Mo top-electrodes. The deposited films were analyzed in depth with X-Ray diffraction (XRD), Reciprocal Space Mapping (RSM), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDX) showing well oriented c-axis growth over the full wafer with slight variation in the film thickness and Sc content over the wafer radius. An overall low density of abnormally oriented grains (AOG) was found. Further wafer mapping for piezoelectric and dielectric properties showed a piezoelectric performance increase by 40 % in comparison to Al$_{0.7}$Sc$_{0.3}$N while only moderately increasing the permittivity and loss factor. Switching measurements revealed ferroelectric behavior of the film on all measured positions with an average remanent polarization of 88.36 uC/cm$^2$ and an average coercive field of 244 V/um. This successful demonstration opens new opportunities for MEMS applications with demands for high forces like microspeakers or quasi static micromirrors.

Title: Colloidal Pivots Enable Brownian Metamaterials and Machines
Authors: Julio Melio, Martin van Hecke, Silke E. Henkes, Daniela J. Kraft
Abstract: Biological machines harness targeted deformations that can be actuated by Brownian fluctuations. However, while synthetic micromachines can similarly leverage targeted deformations they are too stiff to be driven by thermal fluctuations and thus require strong forcing. Furthermore, systems that are able to change their conformation by thermal fluctuations do so uncontrollably or require external control. Here we leverage DNA-based sliding contacts to create colloidal pivots, rigid anisotropic objects that freely fluctuate around their pivot point, and use a hierarchical strategy to assemble these into Brownian metamaterials and machines with targeted deformation modes. We realize the archetypical rotating diamond and rotating triangle, or Kagome, geometries, and quantitatively show how thermal fluctuations drive their predicted auxetic deformations. Finally, we implement magnetic particles into the colloidal pivots to achieve an elementary Brownian machine with easily actuatable deformations that can harness Brownian fluctuations. Together, our work introduces a strategy for creating thermal mechanical metamaterials and leverages them for functional Brownian devices, paving the way to materialize flexible, actuatable structures for micro-robots, smart materials, and nano-medicine.

Title: Enhanced shot noise in graphene quantum point contacts with electrostatic reconstruction

Abstract: Shot noise measurements in quantum point contacts are a powerful tool to investigate charge transport in the integer and fractional quantum Hall regime, in particular to unveil the charge, quantum statistics and tunneling dynamics of edge excitations. In this letter, we describe shot noise measurements in a graphene quantum point contact in the quantum Hall regime. At large magnetic field, the competition between confinement and electronic interactions gives rise to a quantum dot located at the saddle point of the quantum point contact. We show that the presence of this quantum dot leads to a $50-100~\%$ increase in the shot noise, which we attribute to correlated charge tunneling. Our results highlight the role played by the electrostatic environment in those graphene devices.

Title: Geometrical fingerprints of shear transformation zones in network glasses
Authors: Franz Bamer, Zhao Wu, Somar Shekh Alshabab
Abstract: Oxide glasses have the structure of disordered covalent networks that are accountable for their mechanical response. Identifying the topological phenomena of the elastic structural response, we statistically backpropagate local regions that have the highest susceptibility of rearrangement. Shear transformation zones in network glasses highly correlate with regions of the highest variance in their bond stretch distributions projected into the direction of macroscopic deformation. However, directional influence is significantly less essential than bond stretch variance, which shows that shear transformation zones in network glasses are mainly state-dependent. Exclusively depending on the local geometry of the initial material state, our indicators are physically informing and can be evaluated directly from images with insignificant computational effort.

Title: $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ Fermi-Hubbard gas with three-body losses: symmetries and dark states
Authors: Alice Marché, Alberto Nardin, Hosho Katsura, Leonardo Mazza
Abstract: We study an $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ invariant Fermi-Hubbard gas undergoing on-site three-body losses. The model presents eight independent strong symmetries preventing the complete depletion of the gas. By making use of a basis of semi-standard Young tableaux states, we reveal the presence of a rich phenomenology of stationary states. We classify the latter according to the irreducible representation of $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ to which they belong. We finally discuss the presence of three-particle stationary states that are not protected by the SU(3) symmetry.

Title: Electronic structures and multi-orbital models of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films
Authors: Xunwu Hu, Wenyuan Qiu, Cun-Qun Chen, Zhihui Luo, Dao-Xin Yao
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity with $T_c$ exceeding 40 K in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and (La,Pr)$_{3}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films at ambient pressure marks a significant breakthrough in nickelate superconductors. Using density functional theory (DFT), we propose the double-stacked two-orbital effective models for La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films, based on the Ni$-e_g$ orbitals. Our analysis reveals the presence of three electron pockets $\alpha,\alpha^{\prime},\beta$ and two hole pockets $\gamma,\gamma^{\prime}$ on the Fermi surface, where the additional pockets $\alpha^{\prime}$ and $\gamma^{\prime}$ emerge due to inter-stack interactions. Furthermore, we construct higher-energy models incorporating O-$p$ orbitals to facilitate further investigations. The spin susceptibility, calculated within the random phase approximation (RPA), indicates enhanced magnetic correlations primarily driven by nesting effects of the $\gamma$ pocket, which is predominantly contributed by the Ni$-d_{z^2}$ orbital. These models provide fundamental framework for further theoretical and experimental studies, offering critical insights into the superconducting mechanism of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films.

Title: Graphene Straintronics by Molecular Trapping
Authors: Pawan Kumar Srivastava, Vedanki Khandelwal, Ramesh Reddy, Kartick Tarafder, Subhasis Ghosh
Abstract: Here, we report on controlling strain in graphene by trapping molecules at the graphene-substrate interface, leveraging molecular dipole moments. Spectroscopic and transport measurements show that strain correlates with the dipole moments of trapped molecules, with a dipole range of 1.5 D to 4.9 D resulting in a 50-fold increase in strain and a substantial rise in the residual carrier density. This has been possible by charge transfer between graphene and trapped molecules, altering the C=C bond length, and causing biaxial strain. First-principles density functional theory calculations confirm a consistent dependence of bending height on molecular dipole moments.

Title: Superconducting non-volatile memory based on charge trapping and gate-controlled superconductivity
Authors: Leon Ruf, Angelo Di Bernardo, Elke Scheer
Abstract: Superconducting electronics represents a promising technology, offering not only efficient integration with quantum computing systems, but also the potential for significant power reduction in high-performance computing. Nonetheless, the lack of superconducting memories better than conventional metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) memories represent a major obstacle towards the development of computing systems entirely based on superconducting electronics. In this work, we combine the emerging concept of gate-controlled supercurrent (GCS) with the well-established mechanism of charge-trapping memory to demonstrate a novel, highly scalable, voltage-controlled and non-volatile superconducting memory. GCS denotes the observation that the supercurrent in a superconducting constriction can be suppressed by applying a certain gate voltage (VG) to it. Our findings show that charge trapping within the gate dielectric, here sapphire, influences the voltage threshold needed to suppress the supercurrent. We demonstrate reliable reading and reversible writing of two distinct charge-trapping memory states, associated with different supercurrent values. Based on our memory device demonstrator, we discuss its integration into a NOT AND (NAND) gate layout, outlining the significant improvements offered by this novel memory concept over other existing NAND memory technologies.

Title: The Energy Barrier of Precritical Nuclei in Hard Spheres is Consistent with Predictions
Authors: Lars Kürten, Antoine Castagnède, Frank Smallenburg, C. Patrick Royall
Abstract: Predicting crystal nucleation is among the most significant long--standing challenges in condensed matter. In the system most studied (hard sphere colloids), the comparison between experiments performed using static light scattering and computer simulations is woeful, with a discrepancy of over 10 orders of magnitude. The situation with other well-studied materials (such as water and sodium chloride) is no better. It has thus far proven impossible to access the regime of this discrepancy with particle-resolved techniques which might shed light on the origins of this discrepancy due to the relatively sluggish dynamics of the larger colloids required for confocal microscopy. Here we address this challenge with two developments. Our work is a marked improvement in the precision of mapping the state point of experiments to simulation. For this, we employed a combination of novel machine-learning methods for particle tracking and higher-order correlation functions. Our second innovation is to consider the free energy of \emph{pre--critical} nuclei which can be detected in the discrepancy regime. These are in agreement with computer simulation. This is the first time that such free energies have been directly compared between experiment and simulation in any material as far as we are aware. The agreement provides important validation of rare event sampling techniques which are used very widely in simulation, but which can seldom be directly compared with experiment.

Title: Coarsening in the Persistent Voter Model: analytical results
Authors: R.G. de Almeida, J.J. Arenzon, F. Corberi, W.G. Dantas, L. Smaldone
Abstract: We investigate the coarsening dynamics of a simplified version of the persistent voter model in which an agent can become a zealot -- i.e. resistent to change opinion -- at each step, based on interactions with its nearest neighbors. We show that such a model captures the main features of the original, non-Markovian, persistent voter model. We derive the governing equations for the one-point and two-point correlation functions. As these equations do not form a closed set, we employ approximate closure schemes, whose validity was confirmed through numerical simulations. Analytical solutions to these equations are obtained and well agree with the numerical results.

Title: Modeled vortex dynamics on a Bose-Einstein condensate in a rotating lattice
Authors: P. Capuzzi, D. M. Jezek
Abstract: We study the dynamics of vortices in a Bose-Einstein condensate within a rotating four-site lattice which can be effectively described by a multimode model. Such a vortex dynamics develops along the low-density paths that separate the sites, and it is ruled by the phase differences between them. Hence, by appropriately selecting the initial conditions for on-site populations and phase differences, one can access distinct types of evolutions. We show that, by choosing equal populations in alternate sites, one can construct two-mode model Hamiltonians which allows us to model a large variety of associated vortex orbits. In particular, one can select the type of trajectory of the vortex and predict the creation and annihilation of vortex-antivortex pairs near the trap center. Estimates for the periods of closed vortex orbits and for the times that the vortices spend inside the lattice when dealing with open orbits, are obtained in terms of the two-mode models parameters and the rotation frequency only. We believe that the present study establishes a suitable platform to engineer different vortex dynamics.

Title: Lattice Materials with Topological States Optimized On-Demand
Authors: Pegah Azizi, Rahul Dev Kundu, Weichen Li, Kai Sun, Xiaojia Shelly Zhang, Stefano Gonella
Abstract: Topological states of matter, first discovered in quantum systems, have opened new avenues for wave manipulation beyond the quantum realm. In elastic media, realizing these topological effects requires identifying lattices that support the corresponding topological bands. However, among the vast number of theoretically predicted topological states, only a small fraction has been physically realized. To close this gap, we present a new strategy capable of systematically and efficiently discovering metamaterials with any desired topological state. Our approach builds on topological quantum chemistry (TQC), which systematically classifies topological states by analyzing symmetry properties at selected wavevectors. Because this method condenses the topological character into mathematical information at a small set of wavevectors, it encodes a clear and computationally efficient objective for topology optimization algorithms. We demonstrate that, for certain lattice symmetries, this classification can be further reduced to intuitive morphological features of the phonon band structure. By incorporating these band morphology constraints into topology optimization algorithms and further fabricating obtained designs, we enable the automated discovery and physical realization of metamaterials with targeted topological properties. This methodology establishes a new paradigm for engineering topological elastic lattices on demand, addressing the bottleneck in material realization and paving the way for a comprehensive database of topological metamaterial configurations.

Title: Superconducting properties of commercially available solders for low-field applications
Authors: C. Hickman, K. K. H. Leung, A. H. Al-Tawhid, B. W. Filippone, P. R. Huffman, E. Korobkina, D. P. Kumah, C. M. Swank
Abstract: Solders with superconducting properties around $4\,{\rm K}$ are useful in low magnetic field environments for AC current leads or in electrical and mechanical bonds. Accurate knowledge of these properties are needed in high precision experiments. We have measured the electrical resistance of five commercially-available solders: 50\%Sn-50\%Pb, 60\%Sn-40\%Pb, 60\%Sn-40\%Pb-0.3\%Sb, 52\%In-48\%Sn, and 96.5\%Sn-3.5\%Ag, down to $2.3\,{\rm K}$ and in applied magnetic fields from 0 to 0.1$\,{\rm T}$. Their critical temperatures $T_c$ and critical fields $B_c$ were extracted in our analysis, taking into account the observed 90\%-to-10\% transition widths. Our best candidate for low-loss AC current leads in low fields is 50\%Sn-50\%Pb, which had zero-field $T_{c,0} = (7.1 \pm 0.3)\,{\rm K}$, and remained high to $T_c(B=0.1\,{\rm T}) = (6.9 \pm 0.3) \,{\rm K}$. We report $T_c$ and $B_c$ of 60\%Sn-40\%Pb-0.3\%Sb and $B_{c,0}$ of 96.5\%Sn-3.5\%Ag for the first time. Our $T_{c,0}= (3.31 \pm 0.04)\,{\rm K}$ for 96.5\%Sn-3.5\%Ag disagrees with a widely adopted value.

Title: Tight-Binding Energy-Phase Calculation for Topological Josephson Junction Nanowire Architecture
Authors: Adrian D. Scheppe, Michael V. Pak
Abstract: The current state of Quantum computing (QC) is extremely optimistic, and we are at a point where researchers have produced highly sophisticated quantum algorithms to address far reaching problems. However, it is equally apparent that the noisy quantum environment is a larger threat than many may realize. The noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) era can be viewed as an inflection point for the enterprise of QC where decoherence could stagnate progress if left unaddressed. One tactic for handling decoherence is to address the problem from a hardware level by implementing topological materials into the design. In this work, we model several Josephson junctions that are modified by the presence of topological superconducting nanowires in between the host superconductors. Our primary result is a numerical calculation of the energy-phase relationship for topological nanowire junctions which are a key parameter of interest for the dynamics of qubit circuits. In addition to this, we report on the qualitative physical behavior of the bound states as a function of superconducting phase. These results can be used to further develop and inform the construction of more complicated systems, and it is hopeful that these types of designs could manifest as a fault tolerant qubit.

Title: Development of High-Quality $α$-Ta Film at Room Temperature via Seed Layer Engineering
Authors: Senthil Kumar Karuppannan, Naga Manikanta Kommanaboina, Hui Hui Kim, Nelson Lim Chee Beng, Yap Lee Koon Sherry, Yan Guangxu, Manas Mukherjee
Abstract: The growth of high-quality superconducting thin film on silicon substrates is essential for quantum computing, and low signal interconnects with industrial compatibility. Recently, the growth of $\alpha$-Ta (alpha-phase tantalum) thin films has gained attention over conventional superconductors like Nb and Al due to their high-density native oxide ($Ta_2O_5$), which offers excellent chemical resistance, superior dielectric properties, and mechanical robustness. The growth of $\alpha$-Ta thin films can be achieved through high-temperature/cryogenic growth, ultra-thin seed layers, or thick films (>300 nm). While high-temperature deposition produces high-quality films, it can cause thermal stress, silicide formation at the interface, and defects due to substrate-film mismatch. Room-temperature deposition minimizes these issues, benefiting heat-sensitive substrates and device fabrication. Low-temperature growth using amorphous (defective) seed layers such as TaN and TiN has shown promise for phase stabilization. However, nitrogen gas, used as a source of metallic nitride, can introduce defects and lead to the formation of amorphous seed layers. This study explores using crystalline seed layers to optimize $\alpha$-Ta thin films, demonstrating improved film quality, including reduced surface roughness, enhanced phase orientation, and higher transition temperatures compared to amorphous seed layers like metal nitrides. These advancements could interest the superconducting materials community for fabricating high-quality quantum devices.

Title: Prospects to bypass nonlocal phenomena in metals using phonon-polaritons
Authors: Jacob T. Heiden, Eduardo J. C. Dias, Minhyuk Kim, Martin Nørgaard, Vladimir A. Zenin, Sergey G. Menabde, Hu Young Jeong, N. Asger Mortensen, Min Seok Jang
Abstract: Electromagnetic design relies on an accurate understanding of light-matter interactions, yet often overlooks electronic length scales. Under extreme confinement, this omission can lead to nonclassical effects, such as nonlocal response. Here, we use mid-infrared phonon-polaritons in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) screened by monocrystalline gold flakes to push the limits of nanolight confinement unobstructed by nonlocal phenomena, even when the polariton phase velocity approaches the Fermi velocities of electrons in gold. We employ near-field imaging to probe polaritons in nanometre-thin crystals of hBN on gold and extract their complex propagation constant, observing effective indices exceeding 90. We further show the importance of sample characterisation by revealing a thin low-index interfacial layer naturally forming on monocrystalline gold. Our experiments address a fundamental limitation posed by nonlocal effects in van der Waals heterostructures and outline a pathway to bypass their impact in high-confinement regimes.

Title: Topological order in symmetric blockade structures
Authors: Tobias F. Maier, Hans Peter Büchler, Nicolai Lang
Abstract: The bottom-up design of strongly interacting quantum materials with prescribed ground state properties is a highly nontrivial task, especially if only simple constituents with realistic two-body interactions are available on the microscopic level. Here we study two- and three-dimensional structures of two-level systems that interact via a simple blockade potential in the presence of a coherent coupling between the two states. For such strongly interacting quantum many-body systems, we introduce the concept of blockade graph automorphisms to construct symmetric blockade structures with strong quantum fluctuations that lead to equal-weight superpositions of tailored states. Drawing from these results, we design a quasi-two-dimensional periodic quantum system that - as we show rigorously - features a topological $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid as its ground state. Our construction is based on the implementation of a local symmetry on the microscopic level in a system with only two-body interactions.

Title: Fabrication Optimization of van der Waals Metasurfaces: Inverse Patterning Boosts Resonance Quality Factor
Authors: Jonas Biechteler, Connor Heimig, Thomas Weber, Dmytro Gryb, Luca Sortino, Stefan A. Maier, Leonardo de S. Menezes, Andreas Tittl
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) materials have garnered growing interest for use as nanophotonic building blocks that offer precise control over light-matter interaction at the nanoscale, such as optical metasurfaces hosting sharp quasi-bound states in the continuum resonances. However, traditional fabrication strategies often rely on lift-off processes, which inherently introduce imperfections in resonator shape and size distribution, ultimately limiting the resonance performance. Here, an optimized fabrication approach for vdW-metasurfaces is presented that implements inverse patterning of the etching mask, resulting in increased resonator quality solely limited by the resolution of the electron beam lithography resist and etching. Applying this inverse fabrication technique on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), quality (Q) factors exceeding $10^3$ in the visible spectral range were demonstrated, significantly surpassing previous results shown by lift-off fabricated structures. Additionally, the platforms potential as a biosensor was displayed, achieving competitive sensitivity and figure of merit of 220 in a refractive index sensing experiment. The inverse technique was applied to create chiral metasurfaces from hBN, using a two-height resonator geometry to achieve up to 50 % transmittance selectivity. This inverse lithography technique paves the way towards high-performances vdW-devices with high-Q resonances, establishing hBN as a cornerstone for next-generation nanophotonic and optoelectronic devices.

Title: Jitter in photon-number-resolved detection by superconducting nanowires
Authors: Mariia Sidorova, Timon Schapeler, Alexej D. Semenov, Fabian Schlue, Michael Stefszky, Benjamin Brecht, Christine Silberhorn, Tim J. Bartley
Abstract: By analyzing the physics of multi-photon absorption in superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs), we identify physical components of jitter. From this, we formulate a quantitative physical model of the multi-photon detector response which combines local detection mechanism and local fluctuations (hotspot formation and intrinsic jitter) with thermoelectric dynamics of resistive domains. Our model provides an excellent description of the arrival-time histogram of a commercial SNSPD across several orders of magnitude, both in arrival-time probability and across mean photon number. This is achieved with just three fitting parameters: the scaling of the mean arrival time of voltage response pulses, as well as the Gaussian and exponential jitter components. Our findings have important implications for photon-number-resolving detector design, as well as applications requiring low jitter such as light detection and ranging (LIDAR).

Title: Ubiquitous order known as chaos
Authors: Igor V. Ovchinnikov
Abstract: A close relation has recently emerged between two of the most fundamental concepts in physics and mathematics: chaos and supersymmetry. In striking contrast to the semantics of the word 'chaos,' the true physical essence of this phenomenon now appears to be a spontaneous order associated with the breakdown of the topological supersymmetry (TS) hidden in all stochastic (partial) differential equations, i.e., in all systems from a broad domain ranging from cosmology to nanoscience. Among the low-hanging fruits of this new perspective, which can be called the supersymmetric theory of stochastic dynamics (STS), are theoretical explanations of 1/f noise and self-organized criticality. Central to STS is the physical meaning of TS breaking order parameter (OP). In this paper, we discuss that the OP is a field-theoretic embodiment of the 'butterfly effect' (BE) -- the infinitely long dynamical memory that is definitive of chaos. We stress that the formulation of the corresponding effective theory for the OP would mark the inception of the first consistent physical theory of the BE. Such a theory, potentially a valuable tool in solving chaos-related problems, would parallel the well-established and successful field theoretic descriptions of superconductivity, ferromagentism and other known orders arising from the spontaneous breakdown of various symmetries of nature.

Title: Quantum geometric tensors from sub-bundle geometry
Authors: Marius A. Oancea, Thomas B. Mieling, Giandomenico Palumbo
Abstract: The geometric properties of quantum states are crucial for understanding many physical phenomena in quantum mechanics, condensed matter physics, and optics. The central object describing these properties is the quantum geometric tensor, which unifies the Berry curvature and the quantum metric. In this work, we use the differential-geometric framework of vector bundles to analyze the properties of parameter-dependent quantum states and generalize the quantum geometric tensor to this setting. This construction is based on an arbitrary connection on a Hermitian vector bundle, which defines a notion of quantum state transport in parameter space, and a sub-bundle projector, which constrains the set of accessible quantum states. We show that the sub-bundle geometry is similar to that of submanifolds in Riemannian geometry and is described by a generalization of the Gauss-Codazzi-Mainardi equations. This leads to a novel definition of the quantum geometric tensor, which contains an additional curvature contribution. To illustrate our results, we describe the sub-bundle geometry arising in the semiclassical treatment of Dirac fields propagating in curved spacetime and show how the quantum geometric tensor, with its additional curvature contributions, is obtained in this case. As a concrete example, we consider Dirac fermions confined to a hyperbolic plane and demonstrate how spatial curvature influences the quantum geometry. This work sets the stage for further exploration of quantum systems in curved geometries, with applications in both high-energy physics and condensed matter systems.

Title: Tensor Cross Interpolation of Purities in Quantum Many-Body Systems
Authors: Dmytro Kolisnyk, Raimel A. Medina, Romain Vasseur, Maksym Serbyn
Abstract: A defining feature of quantum many-body systems is the exponential scaling of the Hilbert space with the number of degrees of freedom. This exponential complexity naïvely renders a complete state characterization, for instance via the complete set of bipartite Renyi entropies for all disjoint regions, a challenging task. Recently, a compact way of storing subregions' purities by encoding them as amplitudes of a fictitious quantum wave function, known as entanglement feature, was proposed. Notably, the entanglement feature can be a simple object even for highly entangled quantum states. However the complexity and practical usage of the entanglement feature for general quantum states has not been explored. In this work, we demonstrate that the entanglement feature can be efficiently learned using only a polynomial amount of samples in the number of degrees of freedom through the so-called tensor cross interpolation (TCI) algorithm, assuming it is expressible as a finite bond dimension MPS. We benchmark this learning process on Haar and random MPS states, confirming analytic expectations. Applying the TCI algorithm to quantum eigenstates of various one dimensional quantum systems, we identify cases where eigenstates have entanglement feature learnable with TCI. We conclude with possible applications of the learned entanglement feature, such as quantifying the distance between different entanglement patterns and finding the optimal one-dimensional ordering of physical indices in a given state, highlighting the potential utility of the proposed purity interpolation method.

Title: On the Importance of Error Mitigation for Quantum Computation

Abstract: Quantum error mitigation (EM) is a family of hybrid quantum-classical methods for eliminating or reducing the effect of noise and decoherence on quantum algorithms run on quantum hardware, without applying quantum error correction (EC). While EM has many benefits compared to EC, specifically that it requires no (or little) qubit overhead, this benefit comes with a painful price: EM seems to necessitate an overhead in quantum run time which grows as a (mild) exponent. Accordingly, recent results show that EM alone cannot enable exponential quantum advantages (QAs), for an average variant of the expectation value estimation problem. These works raised concerns regarding the role of EM in the road map towards QAs. We aim to demystify the discussion and provide a clear picture of the role of EM in achieving QAs, both in the near and long term. We first propose a clear distinction between finite QA and asymptotic QA, which is crucial to the understanding of the question, and present the notion of circuit volume boost, which we claim is an adequate way to quantify the benefits of EM. Using these notions, we can argue straightforwardly that EM is expected to have a significant role in achieving QAs. Specifically, that EM is likely to be the first error reduction method for useful finite QAs, before EC; that the first such QAs are expected to be achieved using EM in the very near future; and that EM is expected to maintain its important role in quantum computation even when EC will be routinely used - for as long as high-quality qubits remain a scarce resource.

Title: Controlled Floquet Dynamics and Topological Bound States in Continuum via Colored Quantum Random Walks
Authors: Zahra Jalali-Mola, Ortwin Hess
Abstract: We demonstrate the emergence and control of Floquet states and topological bound states in the continuum (TBICs) in a two-dimensional colored quantum random walk (cQRW) on a square lattice. By introducing three internal degrees of freedom-termed "colors"-and leveraging SU(3) group representations, we realize dispersive TBICs and intrinsic Floquet dynamics without the need for external periodic driving. Through Chern number calculations, we identify three distinct topological bands, revealing color-induced band mixing as a key mechanism underlying the natural formation of Floquet states. The cQRW framework enables precise tuning of quasi-energy spectra, supporting the emergence of localized edge states in topological band gaps and dispersive TBICs embedded within the bulk of other bands. These TBICs exhibit tunable group velocity, controllable excitation across energy regimes, and robustness, providing theoretical validation for their existence in a first-order Floquet system. Our findings position cQRWs as a powerful platform for investigating and harnessing TBICs and Floquet states, with potential applications in quantum information and communication technologies.

Title: Dynamic mass generation on two-dimensional electronic hyperbolic lattices
Authors: Noble Gluscevich, Abhisek Samanta, Sourav Manna, Bitan Roy
Abstract: Free electrons hopping on hyperbolic lattices embedded on a negatively curved space can foster (a) Dirac liquids, (b) Fermi liquids, and (c) flat bands, respectively characterized by a vanishing, constant, and divergent density of states near the half filling. From numerical self-consistent mean-field Hartree analyses, we show that nearest-neighbor Coulomb and on-site Hubbard repulsions respectively give rise to charge-density-wave and antiferromagnetic orders featuring staggered patterns of average electronic density and magnetization in all these systems, when the hyperbolic tessellation is accomplished by periodic arrangements of even $p$-gons. Both quantum orders dynamically open mass gaps near the charge neutrality point via spontaneous symmetry breaking. Only on hyperbolic Dirac materials these orderings take place via quantum phase transitions (QPTs) beyond critical interactions, which however decrease with increasing curvature, showcasing curvature-induced weak-coupling QPTs. We present scaling of these masses with the corresponding interaction strengths.

Title: Quantum defects in 2D transition metal dichalcogenides for THz-technologies
Authors: Jingda Zhang, Su Ying Quek
Abstract: Substitutional transition metal (TM) point defects have recently been controllably introduced in two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides. We identify quantum defect candidates through a first principles materials discovery approach with 25 TM elements substituting Mo and W in 2D MoS2 and WSe2, respectively. We elucidate trends in the charge transition levels for these 50 systems and report the existence of defects with spin-triplet ground states and a zero field splitting (ZFS) in the terahertz (THz) regime, in contrast to typical gigahertz values. These defects can couple to resonant near-infrared radiation, providing a route to applications as high fidelity qubits controlled by spin-dependent optical transitions. The THz ZFS implies that these high-fidelity operations can take place at higher temperatures compared to the case for GHz qubits. Our results also point toward the possibility of realizing a single photon THz emitter. This work broadens the scope of quantum defects, laying the foundation for next generation THz quantum technologies, a timely and significant research area given the rapid advancement in the development of THz sources and detectors.

Title: Matsubara-Frequency-Resolved Spin Exchange-Correlation Kernel for the Three-Dimensional Uniform Electron Gas
Authors: Zhiyi Li, Pengcheng Hou, Youjin Deng, Kun Chen
Abstract: The spin Coulomb drag effect, arising from the exchange of momentum between electrons of opposite spins, plays a crucial role in the spin transport of interacting electron systems and can be characterized by the exchange-correlation (XC) kernel in the spin channel $K_{\rm XC}^-(q,\omega)$. Using the state-of-the-art Variational Diagrammatic Monte Carlo approach, we compute the Matsubara-frequency-resolved spin XC kernel $K_{\rm XC}^-(q,i\omega_n)$ for the three-dimensional uniform electron gas at sufficiently low temperatures with high precision. In the long-wavelength limit, we identified a singular behavior of the form $A(i\omega_n)/q^2$, confirming the theoretically predicted ultranonlocal behavior associated with spin Coulomb drag. Analysis of this structure in the low frequency region enables precise determination of two crucial parameters characterizing the spin Coulomb drag effect: the spin mass enhancement factor and spin diffusion relaxation time. We observe a significant trend of increasing enhancement of the spin mass factor with decreasing electron density, and provide clear evidence for the suppression of spin diffusion at low temperatures. These quantitative findings advance our understanding of Coulomb interaction effects on spin transport and provide essential parameters for time-dependent density functional theory and spintronics applications.

Title: A fractal geometry immersed in a hierarchical magnetic flux distribution
Authors: Biplab Pal
Abstract: Fractal geometry presents us with a self-similarity in their pattern at various length scales that is prevalent in our natural world. We present theoretical model of a Sierpinski gasket (SPG) fractal geometry with a deterministic perturbation in the form of a hierarchical distribution of magnetic flux. Such flux configuration induces a deterministic disorder in the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) phases picked up by the electron wavefunction. Using the tight-binding formalism, we show that by tunning the strength of the hierarchy parameter of those AB phases, one can systematically engineer quantum states in a SPG fractal lattice. In addition to this, we have also observed that by controlling the strength of this hierarchy parameter in the magnetic flux, one can effectively regulate the persistent current in the SPG fractal structure. This characteristic is found to be true for various filling factors. Our results could be useful for designing nanoelectronic devices using molecular fractal structures fabricated by chemical synthesis technique.

Title: Angle-dependent planar thermal Hall effect by quasi-ballistic phonons in black phosphorus
Authors: Xiaokang Li, Xiaodong Guo, Zengwei Zhu, Kamran Behnia
Abstract: The origin of the phonon thermal Hall effect in insulators is a matter of ongoing debate. The large amplitude of the signal in an elemental non-magnetic solid, such as black phosphorus (BP), calls for a minimal mechanism not invoking the spin degree of freedom. Here, we show that a longitudinal heat flow generates a transverse temperature gradient in BP even when the magnetic field, the heat current and the thermal gradient lie in the same plane. The phonon mean-free-path is close to the sample thickness. Therefore, it is unlikely that scattering by point-like symmetry-breaking defects play a major role. We show that the angular dependence of the signal can be mapped to the sum of two sinusoidal components each peaking when the magnetic field is parallel to a high symmetry. We propose that anharmonicity may play a major role and argue that the magnetic field can exert a torque on electric dipolar waves traveling with phonons.

Title: Ballistic Entanglement Cloud after a Boundary Quench
Authors: Bedoor Alkurtass, Abolfazl Bayat, Pasquale Sodano, Sougato Bose, Henrik Johannesson
Abstract: Entanglement has been extensively used to characterize the structure of strongly correlated many-body systems. Most of these analyses focus on either spatial properties of entanglement or its temporal behavior. Negativity, as an entanglement measure, quantifies entanglement between different non-complementary blocks of a many-body system. Here, we consider a combined spatial-temporal analysis of entanglement negativity in a strongly correlated many-body system to characterize complex formation of correlations through non-equilibrium dynamics of such systems. A bond defect is introduced through a local quench at one of the boundaries of a uniform Heisenberg spin chain. Using negativity and entanglement entropy, computed by the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group, we analyze the extension of entanglement in the model as a function of time. We find that an entanglement cloud is formed, detached from the boundary spin and composed of spins with which it is highly entangled. The cloud travels ballistically in the chain until it reaches the other end where it reflects back and the cycle repeats. The revival dynamics exhibits an intriguing contraction (expansion) of the cloud as it moves away from (towards) the boundary spin.

Title: Precursor to Quantum Criticality in Ce-Au-Al Quasicrystal Approximants
Authors: A. Khansili, Y.-C. Huang, U. Häussermann, C. Pay Gomez, A. Rydh
Abstract: Rare-earth element containing aperiodic quasicrystals and their related periodic approximant crystals can exhibit non-trivial physical properties at low temperatures. Here, we investigate the 1/1 and 2/1 approximant crystal phases of the Ce-Au-Al system by studying the ac-susceptibility and specific heat at low temperatures and in magnetic fields up to 12 T. We find that these systems display signs of quantum criticality similar to the observations in other claimed quantum critical systems, including the related Yb-Au-Al quasicrystal. In particular, the ac-susceptibility at low temperatures shows a diverging behavior $\chi \propto 1/T$ as the temperature decreases as well as cutoff-behavior in magnetic field. Notably, the field dependence of $\chi$ closely resembles that of quantum critical systems. However, the ac-susceptibility both in zero and nonzero magnetic fields can be understood from the splitting of a ground state Kramers doublet of Ce$^{3+}$. The high-temperature Curie-Weiss fit yields an effective magnetic moment of approximately 2.54$\mu_{\mathrm{B}}$ per Ce for both approximant systems, which is reduced to $\sim$2.0$\mu_{\mathrm{B}}$ at temperatures below 10 K. The low-temperature specific heat is dominated by the Schottky anomaly originating from the splitting of the Ce$^{3+}$ Kramers doublet, resulting in an entropy of $R\ln 2$ at around 10 K.

Title: Experimental observation of vortex gyrotropic mode excited by surface acoustic waves
Authors: R. Lopes Seeger, F. Millo, G. Soares, J.-V. Kim, A. Solignac, G. de Loubens, T. Devolder
Abstract: The traditional method for exciting spin-wave dynamics in magnetic materials involves microwave magnetic fields generated by current injection into inductive antennas. However, there is a growing interest in non-inductive excitation methods. Magneto-acoustic effects present a viable alternative, where strains produced by applying voltages to a piezoelectric substrate can couple to spin-waves in a magnetic film. Recently, it has been proposed that surface acoustic waves (SAWs) can excite the gyrotropic mode of the vortex state in a magnetic disk. Here we report on experiments utilizing a magnetic resonance force microscope to investigate magnetization dynamics in CoFeB sub-micrometer disks in the vortex state, grown on a Z-cut LiNbO$_3$ substrate. The device design enables excitation of the gyrotropic mode either inductively, using an antenna on top of the disks, or acoustically via SAWs launched from an interdigital transducer. Our modelling indicates that the lattice rotation {\omega}xz generates a localized magneto-acoustic field that displaces the vortex core from the disk center, initiating the gyration motion. Tuning of the magneto-acoustic torque acting on the vortex structure is achieved by a perpendicular magnetic field. These results demonstrate the clear excitation of the vortex gyrotropic mode by magneto-acoustic excitation.

Title: Intertwined charge and spin instability of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$
Authors: Guiwen Jiang, Chenye Qin, Kateryna Foyevtsova, Liang Si, Mona Berciu, George A. Sawatzky, Mi Jiang
Abstract: Research on nickel-based superconductors has progressed from infinite-layer LaNiO$_2$ to finite-layer La$_{6}$Ni$_{5}$O$_{12}$, and most recently to the Ruddlesden-Popper phase La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, which was found to exhibits onset of superconductivity at $\sim$80\,K under a pressure of $\sim$16\,GPa. Unlike the superconductivity mainly driven by the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital in infinite-layer nickelates, the Ni-$d_{z^2}$ and O-2$p$ orbitals contribute significantly to the low energy states and potentially to the superconducting electron pairing mechanism of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Employing density functional calculations and multi-orbital multi-atom cluster exact diagonalization including local exchange and Coulomb interactions, here we analyze the pressure dependent low-energy electronic states of the Ni$_2$O$_9$ cluster, relevant for the bilayer phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. The various possible spin states and the exchange and superexchange mechanisms of the Ni$_2$O$_9$ cluster are quantified via the involvement of the Ni-$3d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals and the atomic Hund's rule exchange, the apical bridging O-$2p_z$ orbitals, and the orbitals involved in the formation of local Zhang-Rice singlet like states. We find that the leading configurations contributiong to the cluster ground-states both for nominal valence and also with local charge fluctuations, do not involve occupation of the apical oxygen, instead they favor formation of in-plane Zhang-Rice singlet like states between an O ligand hole and the Ni $3d_{z^2-y^2}$ orbital. We also highlight two possible charge and spin ordered states suggested by our cluster results, that are nearly degenerate at all relevant pressures within our modelling.

Title: Collective Foraging and Behavioural Syndromes in Ants: First-Passage Statistics with Heterogeneous Walkers on a Honeycomb Lattice
Authors: Daniel Marris, Pol Fernández-López, Frederic Bartumeus, Luca Giuggioli
Abstract: Behavioral heterogeneities in animals, also known as syndromes, play a crucial role in understanding how natural populations flexibly adapt to environmental changes. In ant species like \textit{Aphaenogaster senilis}, two key roles in collective foraging are commonly recognised: scouts, who discover food patches, and recruits, who exploit these patches and transport food back to the nest. These roles involve distinct movement patterns and exploratory behaviours. In this chapter, we develop a correlated random walk model on a bounded honeycomb lattice to interpret and replicate empirical observations of foraging ants in an enclosed arena with honeycomb tiling. We do so by extending the theory of first-passage processes for $\mathcal{N}$ random walkers when individuals belong to a heterogeneous population. We apply this theory to examine how individual behavioural heterogeneity in ants affects collective foraging efficiency, focusing on first-passage time statistics for nest-to-patch and patch-to-patch movements. With the combined use of the mathematical model and the controlled experimental setup we evaluate (i) the impact of distinct movement strategies by scouts and recruits on finding food items and (ii) whether ants practice strict central place foraging or utilise previously discovered patches as starting points for further exploration.

Title: Hierarchy-Boosted Funnel Learning for Identifying Semiconductors with Ultralow Lattice Thermal Conductivity
Authors: Mengfan Wu, Shenshen Yan, Jie Ren
Abstract: Data-driven machine learning (ML) has demonstrated tremendous potential in material property predictions. However, the scarcity of materials data with costly property labels in the vast chemical space presents a significant challenge for ML in efficiently predicting properties and uncovering structure-property relationships. Here, we propose a novel hierarchy-boosted funnel learning (HiBoFL) framework, which is successfully applied to identify semiconductors with ultralow lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_\mathrm{L}$). By training on only a few hundred materials targeted by unsupervised learning from a pool of hundreds of thousands, we achieve efficient and interpretable supervised predictions of ultralow $\kappa_\mathrm{L}$, thereby circumventing large-scale brute-force \textit{ab initio} calculations without clear objectives. As a result, we provide a list of candidates with ultralow $\kappa_\mathrm{L}$ for potential thermoelectric applications and discover a new factor that significantly influences structural anharmonicity. This HiBoFL framework offers a novel practical pathway for accelerating the discovery of functional materials.

Title: Direct Imaging of Hydrogen-Driven Dislocation and Strain Field Evolution in a Stainless Steel Grain
Authors: David Yang, Mujan Seif, Guanze He, Kay Song, Adrien Morez, Benjamin de Jager, Dmytro Nykypanchuk, Ross J. Harder, Wonsuk Cha, Edmund Tarleton, Ian K. Robinson, Felix Hofmann
Abstract: Hydrogen embrittlement (HE) poses a significant challenge to the durability of materials used in hydrogen production and utilization. Disentangling the competing nanoscale mechanisms driving HE often relies on simulations and electron-transparent sample techniques, limiting experimental insights into hydrogen-induced dislocation behavior in bulk materials. This study employs in situ Bragg coherent X-ray diffraction imaging to track three-dimensional dislocation and strain field evolution during hydrogen charging in a bulk grain of austenitic 316 stainless steel. Tracking a single dislocation reveals hydrogen-enhanced mobility and relaxation, consistent with dislocation dynamics simulations. Subsequent observations reveal dislocation unpinning and climb processes, likely driven by osmotic forces. Additionally, nanoscale strain analysis around the dislocation core directly measures hydrogen-induced elastic shielding. These findings experimentally validate theoretical predictions and offer mechanistic insights into hydrogen-driven dislocation behavior, paving the way for the design of HE-resistant materials.

Title: Random packing fraction of binary hyperspheres with small or large size difference: a geometric approach
Authors: H.J.H. Brouwers
Abstract: The random packing fraction of binary particles in D-dimensional Euclidean space R^D is studied using a geometric approach. First, the binary packing fraction of assemblies with small size difference are studied, using the excluded volume model by Onsager for particles in three-dimensional space (D = 3). According to this model the packing increase by bidispersity is proportional to (1 - f)(u^D - 1)^2, with f as monosized packing fraction, u as size ratio and D as space dimension. The model predictions are compared with computational results for disks in two dimensions (D = 2) and hyperspheres in the large-dimension limit (D to infinity), yielding good agreement. Subsequently, the packing of hyperspheres with large size difference is modeled, employing the classic theory of Furnas. This theory, developed for three dimensions, starts from an infinite size ratio of larger and smaller particles (u to infinity). Here, the pertaining equations are applied to hyperspheres, and successfully compared with computational results for hyperspheres in the large-dimension limit. Furthermore, an asymptotic approximation of the binary packing fraction for large size ratio is derived, which shows that the first order variation of the Furnas packing fraction (u^-1 = 0) is proportional to (2 - f)u^-1. Finally, a scaled D-dimensional binary packing graph is presented, governing a simplified phase diagram that borders the binary random packing fraction of amorphous assemblies. To summarize, basic space-filling and geometric (athermal) theories on simple hard spheres appear to be a valuable tool for the study of hyperspheres packing and amorphization.

Title: Anomalous proximity effect of a spin-singlet superconductor with a spin-orbit interaction
Authors: Jaechul Lee, Satoshi Ikegaya, Yasuhiro Asano
Abstract: The anomalous proximity effect of a spin-triplet $p$-wave superconductor has been known as a part of the Majorana physics and is explained by the penetration of zero-energy states from a surface of a superconductor to a dirty normal metal. We demonstrate that a spin-singlet $d$-wave superconductor without any surface zero-energy states exhibits the anomalous proximity effect in the presence of a specific spin-orbit interaction. The results show the quantization of the zero-bias conductance in a dirty normal-metal/superconductor junction. We also discuss a relation between our findings and results in an experiment on a CoSi$_2$/TiSi$_2$ junction.

Title: High temperature surface state in Kondo insulator U$_3$Bi$_4$Ni$_3$

Abstract: The resurgence of interest in Kondo insulators has been driven by two major mysteries: the presence of metallic surface states and the observation of quantum oscillations. To further explore these mysteries, it is crucial to investigate another similar system beyond the two existing ones, SmB$_6$ and YbB$_{12}$. Here, we address this by reporting on a Kondo insulator, U$_3$Bi$_4$Ni$_3$. Our transport measurements reveal that a surface state emerges below 250 K and dominates transport properties below 150 K, which is well above the temperature scale of SmB$_6$ and YbB$_{12}$. At low temperatures, the surface conductivity is about one order of magnitude higher than the bulk. The robustness of the surface state indicates that it is inherently protected. The similarities and differences between U$_3$Bi$_4$Ni$_3$ and the other two Kondo insulators will provide valuable insights into the nature of metallic surface states in Kondo insulators and their interplay with strong electron correlations.

Title: Reactive sputtering of SnS thin films using sulfur plasma and a metallic tin target: achieving stoichiometry and large grains
Authors: Daiki Motai, Issei Suzuki, Taichi Nogami, Takahisa Omata
Abstract: This study presents a novel method for fabricating stoichiometric SnS thin films with large grain sizes via reactive sputtering using a metallic Sn target and sulfur plasma (S-plasma). Unlike conventional approaches that rely on toxic H2S gas, this method employs a S-plasma to enhance sulfur reactivity and mitigate sulfur deficiencies during film deposition. By optimizing the balance between the sputtering conditions of the Sn target and the supply conditions of the S-plasma, dense single-phase SnS thin films with micron-scale grain sizes were achieved at a substrate temperature of 300 degree C, achieving an in-plane Hall mobility of 13 cm2 V-1 s-1. Furthermore, crystalline SnS thin films were fabricated even on a room-temperature substrate, enabling potential applications in flexible devices with heat-sensitive substrates. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of S-plasma in advancing SnS thin film fabrication, providing a safer and more efficient route to high-performance photovoltaic materials.

Title: Reflection of Phase Anisotropy on Molecule
Authors: Yoshiaki Uchida, Go Watanabe
Abstract: This study explores how molecular shape changes influence the phase behavior of liquid crystals, particularly the nematic (N) phase of 5CB, through all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The results demonstrate that molecular shape anisotropy increases in the N phase, with molecules adopting more elongated conformations as aggregation occurs. We find that the shape distribution is temperature- and aggregation-dependent, and the molecular shape relaxation time is longer in the N phase compared to isolated molecules. Additionally, the study proposes a revision to Onsager and Maier-Saupe theories, considering molecular shape distribution changes, which could improve the explanation of the N-I phase transition in liquid crystals. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the molecular behavior in liquid crystalline phases.

Title: Sergeants and Soldiers in Chiral Nematic Liquid Crystal
Authors: Yoshiaki Uchida, Go Watanabe
Abstract: This study explores the mechanisms behind the helical structures in cholesteric liquid crystalline (CLC) phases using molecular dynamics simulations. By adding chiral agents to the nematic liquid crystalline (NLC) compound, 5CB, the research examines how the shape and motion chirality of the agents influence the overall twisting behavior. The results show that chiral agents induce shape chirality in the 5CB molecules, but dynamic chirality is not detectable at this stage. The study suggests that equilibrium is required for motion chirality to become evident, highlighting the need for further investigation.

Title: Schrödinger Bridges for Systems of Interacting Particles
Authors: Henri Orland
Abstract: A Schrödinger bridge is the most probable time-dependent probability distribution that connects an initial probability distribution $w_{i}$ to a final one $w_{f}$. The problem has been solved and widely used for the case of simple Brownian evolution (non-interacting particles). It is related to the problem of entropy regularized Wasserstein optimal transport. In this article, we generalize Brownian bridges to systems of interacting particles. We derive some equations for the forward and backward single particle ``wave-functions'' which allow to compute the most probable evolution of the single-particle probability between the initial and final distributions.

Title: Solving the SU($N$) Orbital Hatsugai-Komoto Model
Authors: Nico A. Hackner, Peizhi Mai, Philip W. Phillips
Abstract: We show that the physics of the SU($N$) Hubbard model can be realistically simulated with the recent advance of the orbital Hatsugai-Kohmoto model. In this approach, the momentum mixing absent from the band Hatsugai-Kohmoto model is included by grouping $n-$Hubbard atoms into a cluster. We take advantage of the rapid convergence of this scheme ($1/n^2$) and show that for $n\approx O(10)$, quantitative agreement with determinantal quantum Monte Carlo arises for the double occupancy and the compressibility across the Mott transition, as well as the spin structure factor in the Mott insulating state. Additional features of this work are that we can obtain low-temperature physics, which could be qualitatively different from its high-temperature counterpart, and dynamical quantities without resorting to analytical continuation, thereby establishing a clear advantage of the orbital Hatsugai-Kohmoto model over quantum Monte Carlo methodology in the study of strong correlations.

Title: Chemical Foundation Model Guided Design of High Ionic Conductivity Electrolyte Formulations
Authors: Murtaza Zohair, Vidushi Sharma, Eduardo A. Soares, Khanh Nguyen, Maxwell Giammona, Linda Sundberg, Andy Tek, Emilio A. V. Vital, Young-Hye La
Abstract: Designing optimal formulations is a major challenge in developing electrolytes for the next generation of rechargeable batteries due to the vast combinatorial design space and complex interplay between multiple constituents. Machine learning (ML) offers a powerful tool to uncover underlying chemical design rules and accelerate the process of formulation discovery. In this work, we present an approach to design new formulations that can achieve target performance, using a generalizable chemical foundation model. The chemical foundation model is fine-tuned on an experimental dataset of 13,666 ionic conductivity values curated from the lithium-ion battery literature. The fine-tuned model is used to discover 7 novel high conductivity electrolyte formulations through generative screening, improving the conductivity of LiFSI and LiDFOB based electrolytes by 82% and 172%, respectively. These findings highlight a generalizable workflow that is highly adaptable to the discovery of chemical mixtures with tailored properties to address challenges in energy storage and beyond.

Title: BaZrS$_\text{3}$ Lights Up: The Interplay of Electrons, Photons, and Phonons in Strongly Luminescent Single Crystals
Authors: Rasmus Svejstrup Nielsen, Ángel Labordet Álvarez, Yvonne Tomm, Galina Gurieva, Andres Ortega-Guerrero, Joachim Breternitz, Lorenzo Bastonero, Nicola Marzari, Carlo Pignedoli, Susan Schorr, Mirjana Dimitrievska
Abstract: Chalcogenide perovskites have emerged as a promising class of materials for the next generation of optoelectronic applications, with BaZrS$_\text{3}$ attracting significant attention due to its wide bandgap, earth-abundant composition, and thermal and chemical stability. However, previous studies have consistently reported weak and ambiguous photoluminescence (PL), regardless of synthesis method, raising questions about the intrinsic optoelectronic quality of this compound. In this work, we demonstrate strong, band-to-band-dominated PL at room temperature in high-quality BaZrS$_\text{3}$ single crystals. Despite the narrow, single-component PL emission band, time-resolved PL measurements reveal a carrier lifetime of $1.0\pm0.2$ ns. To understand the origin of the strong PL and short carrier lifetime, we perform multiwavelength excitation and polarization-dependent Raman measurements, supported by first-principles lattice dynamics calculations. We identify all 23 theoretically predicted Raman-active modes and their symmetries, providing a comprehensive reference for future studies. Our results indicate that phonon-assisted carrier decay and strong electron-phonon coupling contribute to the short carrier lifetimes, as evidenced by Raman spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Further studies on compositional variations or partial cation/anion substitutions could mitigate electron-phonon coupling and enhance carrier lifetimes. By establishing a detailed reference for the intrinsic vibrational and optoelectronic properties of BaZrS$_\text{3}$, this work paves the way for further advancements in chalcogenide perovskites for energy and optoelectronic technologies.

Title: Absence of barren plateaus and scaling of gradients in the energy optimization of isometric tensor network states
Authors: Thomas Barthel, Qiang Miao
Abstract: Vanishing gradients can pose substantial obstacles for high-dimensional optimization problems. Here we consider energy minimization problems for quantum many-body systems with extensive Hamiltonians and finite-range interactions, which can be studied on classical computers or in the form of variational quantum eigensolvers on quantum computers. Barren plateaus correspond to scenarios where the average amplitude of the energy gradient decreases exponentially with increasing system size. This occurs, for example, for quantum neural networks and for brickwall quantum circuits when the depth increases polynomially in the system size. Here we prove that the variational optimization problems for matrix product states, tree tensor networks, and the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz are free of barren plateaus. The derived scaling properties for the gradient variance provide an analytical guarantee for the trainability of randomly initialized tensor network states (TNS) and motivate certain initialization schemes. In a suitable representation, unitary tensors that parametrize the TNS are sampled according to the uniform Haar measure. We employ a Riemannian formulation of the gradient based optimizations which simplifies the analytical evaluation.

Title: Digital-analog quantum computing of fermion-boson models in superconducting circuits
Authors: Shubham Kumar, Narendra N. Hegade, Anne-Maria Visuri, B. A. Bhargava, Juan F. R. Hernandez, Enrique Solano, Francisco Albarrán-Arriagada, Gabriel Alvarado Barrios
Abstract: High-fidelity quantum simulations demand hardware-software co-design architectures, which are crucial for adapting to complex problems such as strongly correlated dynamics in condensed matter. By leveraging co-design strategies, we can enhance the performance of state-of-the-art quantum devices in the noisy intermediate quantum (NISQ) and early error-correction regimes. In this direction, we propose a digital-analog quantum algorithm for simulating the Hubbard-Holstein model, describing strongly-correlated fermion-boson interactions, in a suitable architecture with superconducting circuits. It comprises a linear chain of qubits connected by resonators, emulating electron-electron (e-e) and electron-phonon (e-p) interactions, as well as fermion tunneling. Our approach is adequate for digital-analog quantum computing (DAQC) of fermion-boson models, including those described by the Hubbard-Holstein model. We show the reduction in the circuit depth of the DAQC algorithm, a sequence of digital steps and analog blocks, outperforming the purely digital approach. We exemplify the quantum simulation of a half-filled two-site Hubbard-Holstein model. In this example, we obtain time-dependent state fidelities larger than 0.98, showing that our proposal is suitable for studying the dynamical behavior of solid-state systems. Our proposal opens the door to computing complex systems for chemistry, materials, and high-energy physics.

Title: Real-time correlators in 3+1D thermal lattice gauge theory
Authors: Kirill Boguslavski, Paul Hotzy, David I. Müller
Abstract: We present the first direct ab-initio computation of unequal-time correlation functions in non-Abelian lattice gauge theory. We demonstrate non-trivial consistency relations among correlators, time-translation invariance, and agreement with Monte-Carlo results for thermal equilibrium in 3+1 dimensions by employing our stabilized complex Langevin method. Our work sets the stage to extract real-time observables, relevant to quark-gluon plasma physics within a first-principles real-time framework.

Title: The classical limit of Quantum Max-Cut
Authors: Vir B. Bulchandani, Stephen Piddock
Abstract: It is well-known in physics that the limit of large quantum spin $S$ should be understood as a semiclassical limit. This raises the question of whether such emergent classicality facilitates the approximation of computationally hard quantum optimization problems, such as the local Hamiltonian problem. We demonstrate this explicitly for spin-$S$ generalizations of Quantum Max-Cut ($\mathrm{QMaxCut}_S$), equivalent to the problem of finding the ground state energy of an arbitrary spin-$S$ quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnet ($\mathrm{QHA}_S$). We prove that approximating the value of $\mathrm{QHA}_S$ to inverse polynomial accuracy is QMA-complete for all $S$, extending previous results for $S=1/2$. We also present two distinct families of classical approximation algorithms for $\mathrm{QMaxCut}_S$ based on rounding the output of a semidefinite program to a product of Bloch coherent states. The approximation ratios for both our proposed algorithms strictly increase with $S$ and converge to the Briët-Oliveira-Vallentin approximation ratio $\alpha_{\mathrm{BOV}} \approx 0.956$ from below as $S \to \infty$.

Title: Opinion inertia and coarsening in the Persistent Voter model
Authors: Luis Carlos F. Latoski, W. G. Dantas, Jeferson J. Arenzon
Abstract: We consider the Persistent Voter model (PVM), a variant of the Voter model (VM) that includes transient, dynamically-induced zealots. Due to peer reinforcement, the internal confidence $\eta_i$ of a normal voter increases by steps of size $\Delta\eta$ and once it gets above a given threshold, it becomes a zealot. Then, its opinion remains frozen until enough interactions with the opposite opinion occur and its confidence is reset. No longer a zealot, the regular voter may change opinion once again. This opinion inertia mechanism, albeit simplified, is responsible for an effective surface tension and the PVM has a crossover from a fluctuation-driven dynamics, as in the VM, to a curvature-driven one, as in the Ising Model at low temperature (IM0). The average time $\tau$ to attain consensus is non-monotonic on $\Delta\eta$ and has a minimum at $\Delta\eta_{\min}$. In this paper we clarify the mechanisms that accelerate the system towards consensus close to $\Delta\eta_{\min}$. Close to the crossover at $\Delta\eta_{\min}$, the intermediate region around the domains where the regular voters accumulate (the active region, AR) is large and the surface tension, albeit small, is still enough to keep the shape and reduce the fragmentation of the domains. The large size of the AR in the region of $\Delta\eta_{\min}$ has two important effects that accelerates the dynamics. First, it dislodges the zealots in the bulk of the domains and second, it maximally suppresses the slowly-evolving stripes that normally form in Ising-like models. This suggests the importance of understanding the role of the AR, where the change of opinion is facilitated, and the interplay between regular voters and zealots when attempting to disrupt polarized states.

Title: A multiscale cavity method for sublinear-rank symmetric matrix factorization
Authors: Jean Barbier, Justin Ko, Anas A. Rahman
Abstract: We consider a statistical model for symmetric matrix factorization with additive Gaussian noise in the high-dimensional regime where the rank $M$ of the signal matrix to infer scales with its size $N$ as $M={\rm o}(\sqrt{\ln N})$. Allowing for an $N$-dependent rank offers new challenges and requires new methods. Working in the Bayes-optimal setting, we show that whenever the signal has i.i.d.~entries, the limiting mutual information between signal and data is given by a variational formula involving a rank-one replica symmetric potential. In other words, from the information-theoretic perspective, the case of a (slowly) growing rank is the same as when $M=1$ (namely, the standard spiked Wigner model). The proof is primarily based on a novel multiscale cavity method allowing for growing rank along with some information-theoretic identities on worst noise for the vector Gaussian channel. We believe that the cavity method developed here will play a role in the analysis of a broader class of inference and spin models where the degrees of freedom are large arrays instead of vectors.

Title: A gradient atmospheric model reveals enhanced radiative cooling potential and demonstrates the advantages of broadband emitters
Authors: Yeonghoon Jin, Mikhail A. Kats
Abstract: Passive radiative cooling toward the sky is a developing technology for adaptation in hot climates. Previous calculations of cooling performance have generally used uniform atmospheric models that assume a single sky temperature and atmospheric transmittance spectrum. Here, we introduce a gradient atmospheric model that accounts for altitude-dependent temperature and gas composition, revealing that uniform models underestimate cooling power by 10 - 40%. Using our improved model, we systematically compared broadband emitters (BEs) and wavelength-selective emitters (SEs) for sky-facing radiative cooling at various locations on Earth. We find that the differences in cooling power between the two types of emitters in the sub-ambient temperature range are generally small, even under ideal conditions. Furthermore, in practice, BEs actually have superior performance than realistic SEs, because they have fewer design degrees of freedom and thus can be engineered to have lower solar absorption. Our analysis suggests that large-scale deployment of sky-facing passive radiative cooling technologies should prioritize the development of scalable, low-cost surfaces with minimal solar absorption, rather than focusing on achieving selective thermal emission.

Title: Thermalization in Trapped Bosonic Systems With Disorder
Authors: Javier de la Cruz, Carlos Diaz-Mejia, Sergio Lerma-Hernandez, Jorge G. Hirsch
Abstract: A detailed study of thermalization is conducted on experimentally accessible states in a system of bosonic atoms trapped in an open linear chain with disorder. When the disorder parameter is large, the system exhibits regularity and localization. In contrast, weak disorder introduces chaos and raises questions about the validity of the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH), especially for states at the extremes of the energy spectrum which remain regular and non-thermalizing. The validity of ETH is assessed by examining the dispersion of entanglement entropy and the number of bosons on the first site across various dimensions, while maintaining a constant particle density of one. Experimentally accessible states in the occupation basis are categorized using a crowding parameter that linearly correlates with their mean energy. Using full exact diagonalization to simulate temporal evolution, we study the equilibration of entanglement entropy, the number of bosons, and the reduced density matrix of the first site for all states in the occupation basis. Comparing equilibrium values of these observables with those predicted by microcanonical ensembles, we find that, within certain tolerances, most states in the chaotic region thermalize. However, states with low participation ratios in the energy eigenstate basis show greater deviations from thermal equilibrium values.

Title: Persistent oscillation of a Cooper-pair condensate of topological defects in a nonintegrable quantum Ising chain
Authors: Francis A. Bayocboc Jr., Jacek Dziarmaga, Marek M. Rams, Wojciech H. Zurek
Abstract: We identify persistent oscillations in a nonintegrable quantum Ising chain. In the integrable chain with nearest-neighbor interactions, the nature, origin, and decay of post-transition oscillations are tied to the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. Remarkably, when coupling to the next-nearest neighbor is added, the resulting nonintegrable ''zigzag'' chain (still in the quantum Ising universality class) supports persistent oscillation: Topological defects (kinks) appear as a result of the quantum phase transition. However, in a ''zigzag'' Ising chain defects can form Cooper pairs. The oscillation of the Cooper-pair condensate has a frequency that depends on the binding energy gap between the paired and the unpaired defects, so it can be excited by resonant driving. While one might have expected that the integrability-breaking ''zigzag'' coupling causes relaxation, the oscillations we identify are persistent: Their longevity in our simulations is likely limited only by numerical accuracy. This oscillation of the Cooper-pair condensate of kinks is a manifestation of quantum coherence and should be experimentally accessible.

Title: An analog of topological entanglement entropy for mixed states
Authors: Ting-Tung Wang, Menghan Song, Zi Yang Meng, Tarun Grover
Abstract: We propose the convex-roof extension of quantum conditional mutual information ("co(QCMI)") as a diagnostic of topological order in a mixed state. We focus primarily on topological states subjected to local decoherence, and employ the Levin-Wen scheme to define co(QCMI), so that for a pure state, co(QCMI) equals topological entanglement entropy (TEE). By construction, co(QCMI) is zero if and only if a mixed state can be decomposed as a convex sum of pure states with zero TEE. We show that co(QCMI) is non-increasing with increasing decoherence when Kraus operators are proportional to the product of onsite unitaries. This implies that unlike a pure state transition between a topologically trivial and a non-trivial phase, the long-range entanglement at a decoherence-induced topological phase transition as quantified by co(QCMI) is less than or equal to that in the proximate topological phase. For the 2d toric code decohered by onsite bit/phase-flip noise, we show that co(QCMI) is non-zero below the error-recovery threshold and zero above it. Relatedly, the decohered state cannot be written as a convex sum of short-range entangled pure states below the threshold. We conjecture and provide evidence that in this example, co(QCMI) equals TEE of a recently introduced pure state. In particular, we develop a tensor-assisted Monte Carlo (TMC) computation method to efficiently evaluate the Rényi TEE for the aforementioned pure state and provide non-trivial consistency checks for our conjecture. We use TMC to also calculate the universal scaling dimension of the anyon-condensation order parameter at this transition.

Title: Slow approach to adiabaticity in many-body non-Hermitian systems: the Hatano-Nelson Model
Authors: Léonce Dupays, Adolfo del Campo, Balázs Dóra
Abstract: We explore the near adiabatic dynamics in a non-Hermitian quantum many-body system by investigating a finite-time ramp of the imaginary vector potential in the interacting Hatano-Nelson model. The excess energy, the Loschmidt echo, and the density imbalance are analyzed using bosonization and exact diagonalization. The energy becomes complex valued, despite the instantaneous Hamiltonian having the same real spectrum throughout. The adiabatic limit is approached very slowly through damped oscillations. The decay scales with $\tau^{-1}$ with $\tau$ the ramp duration, while the oscillation period is $2L/v$ with $v$ the Fermi velocity and $L$ the system length. Yet, without the need for auxiliary controls, a shortcut to adiabaticity is found for ramp times commensurate with the period. Our work highlights the intricate interplay of adiabaticity and non-Hermitian many-body physics.

Title: Monte Carlo Simulation of Operator Dynamics and Entanglement in Dual-Unitary Circuits
Authors: Menghan Song, Zhaoyi Zeng, Ting-Tung Wang, Yi-Zhuang You, Zi Yang Meng, Pengfei Zhang
Abstract: We investigate operator dynamics and entanglement growth in dual-unitary circuits, a class of locally scrambled quantum systems that enables efficient simulation beyond the exponential complexity of the Hilbert space. By mapping the operator evolution to a classical Markov process,we perform Monte Carlo simulations to access the time evolution of local operator density and entanglement with polynomial computational cost. Our results reveal that the operator density converges exponentially to a steady-state value, with analytical bounds that match our simulations. Additionally, we observe a volume-law scaling of operator entanglement across different subregions,and identify a critical transition from maximal to sub-maximal entanglement growth, governed by the circuit's gate parameter. This transition, confirmed by both mean-field theory and Monte Carlo simulations, provides new insights into operator entanglement dynamics in quantum many-body systems. Our work offers a scalable computational framework for studying long-time operator evolution and entanglement, paving the way for deeper exploration of quantum information dynamics.

Title: All-passive upconversion of incoherent near-infrared light at intensities down to 10$^{-7}$ W/cm$^2$
Authors: Rabeeya Hamid, Demeng Feng, Pournima Narayanan, Justin S. Edwards, Manchen Hu, Emma Belliveau, Minjeong Kim, Sanket Deshpande, Chenghao Wan, Linda Pucurimay, David A. Czaplewski, Daniel N. Congreve, Mikhail A. Kats
Abstract: Frequency upconversion, which converts low-energy photons into higher-energy ones, typically requires intense coherent illumination to drive nonlinear processes or the use of externally driven optoelectronic devices. Here, we demonstrate an upconversion system that converts low-intensity (down to ~10-7 W/cm$^2$) incoherent near-infrared (NIR) light into the visible, reaching intensities perceptible by the human eye, without the use of any external power input. Our upconverting element is enabled by the following ingredients: (1) photon upconversion via triplet-triplet annihilation in a bulk heterojunction of the organic semiconductors Y6 and rubrene; (2) plasmonic enhancement of absorption and field intensity in the heterojunction layer; (3) collection enhancement using a dichroic thin-film assembly. To enable high-resolution imaging, the upconverting element is inserted at an intermediate image plane of a dual-wavelength telescope system, which preserves the relative directionality of rays between the incident NIR light and output visible light. Our all-passive upconversion imaging system will enable NIR imaging and sensing in low-light environments under energy constraints.

Title: Scaling of connectivity metrics in river networks
Authors: E. H. Colombo, A. B. García-Andrade, Ismail, J. M. Calabrese
Abstract: Rivers exhibit fractal-like properties that are associated with scaling laws linking geometry and size. The optimal channel network (OCN) model, which is a mathematically tractable representation of river networks often used in theoretical studies, is based on the fractal properties of rivers and consequently reproduces geometric scaling laws. However, purely geometric relationships may not fully capture the interaction between river structure and species' movement strategies that is most relevant to many large-scale ecological processes. In contrast, connectivity, which is a concept that blends habitat geometry and individual movement, has been shown both theoretically and empirically to influence relevant large-scale ecological outcomes across a broad array of ecosystems. Here, we analyze networks from more than 1000 major rivers around the world, including the Amazon, Mississippi, and Nile, to investigate how river network connectivity metrics scale with system size. Specifically, we found clear power-law scaling of both the harmonic centrality and betweenness centrality network connectivity metrics. To assess the extent to which OCNs can capture these empirical connectivity patterns, we generated synthetic river networks by fitting an OCN model to each real river. We found excellent agreement between empirical and OCN-based scaling laws, supporting the notion that OCNs can accurately represent rivers in network-based models and analyses. Finally, we examined the robustness of the connectivity scaling laws to species movement strategies ranging from ideal shortest-path navigation to suboptimal random-path navigation. Surprisingly, we found that random navigation breaks the power-law scaling relationship for harmonic centrality, but not for betweenness centrality.

Title: The study of double kicked top: a classical and quantum perspective
Authors: Avadhut V. Purohit, Udaysinh T. Bhosale
Abstract: We study the double kicked top (DKT), which is an extension of the standard quantum kicked top (QKT) model. The model allows us to study the transition from time-reversal symmetric to broken time-reversal symmetric dynamics. Our transformation in the kick strength parameter space $(k, k') \to (k_r, k_\theta)$ reveals interesting features. The transformed kicked strength parameter $k_r$ drives a higher growth of chaos and is equivalent to the standard QKT, whereas the other transformed kicked strength parameter $k_\theta$ leads to a weaker growth. We discuss the fixed points, their stability, and verify results obtained by computing the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE) and the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy (KSE). We exactly solve 2- to 4-qubit versions of DKT by obtaining its eigenvalues, eigenvectors and the entanglement dynamics. Furthermore, we find the criteria for periodicity of the entanglement dynamics. We investigate measures of quantum correlations from two perspectives: the deep quantum and the semi-classical regime. Signatures of phase-space structure are numerically shown in the long-time averages of the quantum correlations. Our model can be realised experimentally as an extension of the standard QKT.

Title: Quantifying Trapped Magnetic Vortex Losses in Niobium Resonators at mK Temperatures
Authors: D. Bafia, B. Abdisatarov, R. Pilipenko, Y. Lu, G. Eremeev, A. Romanenko, A. Grassellino
Abstract: Trapped magnetic vortices in niobium can introduce microwave losses in superconducting devices, affecting both niobium-based qubits and resonators. While our group has extensively studied this problem at temperatures above 1~K, in this study we quantify for the first time the losses driven by magnetic vortices for niobium-based quantum devices operating down to millikelvin temperature, and in the low photon counts regime. By cooling a single interface system a 3-D niobium superconducting cavity in a dilution refrigerator through the superconducting transition temperature in controlled levels of magnetic fields, we isolate the flux-induced losses and quantify the added surface resistance per unit of trapped magnetic flux. Our findings indicate that magnetic flux introduces approximately 2~n$\Omega /$mG at 10 mK and at 6 GHz in high RRR niobium. We find that the decay rate of a 6 GHz niobium cavity at 10 mK which contains a native niobium pentoxide will be dominated by the TLS oxide losses until vortices begin to impact $T_1$ for trapped magnetic field ($B_{\text{trap}}$) levels of $>$100 mG. In the absence of the niobium pentoxide, $B_{\text{trap}}=$ 10 mG limits $Q_0\sim$ 10$^{10}$, or $T_1\sim$ 350 ms, highlighting the importance of magnetic shielding and magnetic hygiene in enabling $T_1>$ 1 s. We observe that the flux-induced resistance decreases with temperature-yet remains largely field-independent, qualitatively explained by thermal activation of vortices in the flux-flow regime. We present a phenomenological model which captures the salient experimental observations. Our results suggest that niobium-based transmon qubits could be robust against vortex dissipation up to several hundreds mG. We are directly addressing vortex losses in transmon qubits made with low RRR Nb films in a separate experimental study.

Title: Uni-3DAR: Unified 3D Generation and Understanding via Autoregression on Compressed Spatial Tokens
Authors: Shuqi Lu, Haowei Lin, Lin Yao, Zhifeng Gao, Xiaohong Ji, Weinan E, Linfeng Zhang, Guolin Ke
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models and their multi-modal extensions have demonstrated the effectiveness of unifying generation and understanding through autoregressive next-token prediction. However, despite the critical role of 3D structural generation and understanding (3D GU) in AI for science, these tasks have largely evolved independently, with autoregressive methods remaining underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce Uni-3DAR, a unified framework that seamlessly integrates 3D GU tasks via autoregressive prediction. At its core, Uni-3DAR employs a novel hierarchical tokenization that compresses 3D space using an octree, leveraging the inherent sparsity of 3D structures. It then applies an additional tokenization for fine-grained structural details, capturing key attributes such as atom types and precise spatial coordinates in microscopic 3D structures. We further propose two optimizations to enhance efficiency and effectiveness. The first is a two-level subtree compression strategy, which reduces the octree token sequence by up to 8x. The second is a masked next-token prediction mechanism tailored for dynamically varying token positions, significantly boosting model performance. By combining these strategies, Uni-3DAR successfully unifies diverse 3D GU tasks within a single autoregressive framework. Extensive experiments across multiple microscopic 3D GU tasks, including molecules, proteins, polymers, and crystals, validate its effectiveness and versatility. Notably, Uni-3DAR surpasses previous state-of-the-art diffusion models by a substantial margin, achieving up to 256\% relative improvement while delivering inference speeds up to 21.8x faster. The code is publicly available at this https URL.
