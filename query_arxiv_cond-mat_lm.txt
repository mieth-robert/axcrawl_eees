Title: Quantum Spin Liquids in Pyrochlore Magnets With Non-Kramers Local Moments
Authors: Tony An, Félix Desrochers, Yong Baek Kim
Abstract: Numerous experiments on pyrochlore oxides Pr$_2$(Zr, Sn, Hf, Ir)$_2$O$_7$ with non-Kramers Pr$^{3+}$ ions suggest that they support a quantum spin liquid (QSL) ground state, but the precise nature of the QSL remains unclear. Quantum spin ice with dominant dipolar Ising and smaller quadrupolar transverse exchange interactions is one such candidate, but a dominant inelastic neutron scattering signal suggests that such a picture may not be consistent with experimental results. The microscopic exchange couplings of these compounds are also not known, leaving room for many possible QSL states. In this work, we use Schwinger boson mean-field theory supplemented by a projective symmetry group classification to study possible $\mathbb{Z}_2$ QSLs in pyrochlore magnets with dipolar-quadrupolar non-Kramers local moments. We build a mean-field phase diagram and find four QSLs in the frustrated region of parameter space that are consistent with inelastic signals observed in neutron scattering data on Pr$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ and Pr$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$. Among these, two robust QSLs occur in the regime with dominant transverse exchange rather than Ising exchange. We then compute the static and dynamic spin structure factors for these QSL candidates, which can be used to distinguish them in neutron scattering experiments.

Title: Universal temperature-dependent power law excitation gaps in frustrated quantum spin systems harboring order-by-disorder
Authors: Alexander Hickey, Jeffrey G. Rau, Subhankar Khatua, Michel J. P. Gingras
Abstract: When magnetic moments are subject to competing or frustrated interactions, continuous degeneracies that are not protected by any symmetry of the parent Hamiltonian can emerge at the classical (mean-field) level. Such "accidental" degeneracies are often lifted by both thermal and quantum fluctuations via a mechanism known as order-by-disorder (ObD). The leading proposal to detect and characterize ObD in real materials, in a way that quantitatively distinguishes it from standard energetic selection, is to measure a small fluctuation-induced pseudo-Goldstone gap in the excitation spectrum. While the properties of this gap are known to leading order in the spin wave interactions, in both the zero-temperature and classical limits, the pseudo-Goldstone (PG) gap in quantum magnets at finite temperature has yet to be characterized. Using non-linear spin wave theory, we compute the PG gap to leading order in a $1/S$ expansion at low temperature for a variety of frustrated quantum spin systems. We also develop a formalism to calculate the PG gap in a way that solely uses linear spin-wave theory, circumventing the need to carry out tedious quantum many-body calculations. We argue that, at leading order, the PG gap acquires a distinct power-law temperature dependence, proportional to either $T^{d+1}$ or $T^{d/2+1}$ depending on the gapless dispersion of the PG mode predicted at the mean-field level. Finally, we examine the implications of these results for the pyrochlore oxide compound Er$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$, for which there is compelling evidence of ObD giving rise to the experimentally observed long-range order.

Title: Nonuniversal equation of state for Rabi-coupled bosonic gases: a droplet phase
Authors: Emerson Chiquillo
Abstract: Through an effective quantum field theory including zero temperature Gaussian fluctuations we derive analytical and explicit expressions for the equation of state of three-dimensional ultracold Rabi-coupled two-component bosonic gases with nonuniversal corrections to the interactions. At mean-field level the system presents two ground-states, one symmetric and one non-symmetric or unbalanced. For the symmetric ground state, in the regime where inter-species interactions are weakly attractive and subtly higher than repulsive intra-species, the instability by collapse is avoided by the contribution arising from Gaussian fluctuations, driving thus to formation of a liquidlike phase or droplet phase. This self-bound state is crucially affected by the dependence on the nonuniversal corrections to the interactions, which acts controlling the droplet stability. By tuning the ratio between the inter-species scattering length and the intra-species scattering lengths or the nonuniversal contribution to the interactions we address and establish conditions under which the formation and stability of self-bound Rabi-coupled droplets with nonuniversal corrections to the interactions is favorable.

Title: Mechanochemical feedback drives complex inertial dynamics in active solids
Authors: Siddhartha Sarkar, Biswarup Ash, Yueyang Wu, Nicholas Boechler, Suraj Shankar, Xiaoming Mao
Abstract: Active solids combine internal active driving with elasticity to realize states with nonequilibrium mechanics and autonomous motion. They are often studied in overdamped settings, e.g., in soft materials, and the role of inertia is less explored. We construct a model of a chemically active solid that incorporates mechanochemical feedback and show that, when feedback overwhelms mechanical damping, autonomous inertial dynamics can spontaneously emerge through sustained consumption of chemical fuel. By combining numerical simulations, analysis and dynamical systems approaches, we show how active feedback drives complex nonlinear dynamics on multiple time-scales, including limit cycles and chaos. Our results suggest design principles for creating ultrafast actuators and autonomous machines from soft, chemically-powered solids.

Title: Correlations, mean-field limits, and transition to the concentrated regime in motile particle suspensions
Authors: Bryce Palmer, Scott Weady, Michael O'Brien, Blakesley Burkhart, Michael J. Shelley
Abstract: Suspensions of swimming particles exhibit complex collective behaviors driven by hydrodynamic interactions, showing persistent large-scale flows and long-range correlations. While heavily studied, it remains unclear how such structures depend on the system size and swimmer concentration. To address these issues, we simulate very large systems of suspended swimmers across a range of system sizes and volume fractions. For this we use high-performance simulation tools that build on slender body theory and implicit resolution of steric interactions. At low volume fractions and long times, the particle simulations reveal dynamic flow structures and correlation functions that scale with the system size. These results are consistent with a mean-field limit and agree well with a corresponding kinetic theory. At higher concentrations, the system departs from mean-field behavior. Flow structures become cellular, and correlation lengths scale with the particle size. Here, translational motion is suppressed, while rotational dynamics dominate. These findings highlight the limitations of dilute mean-field models and reveal new behaviors in dense active suspensions.

Title: Circuit-level-configurable Zero-field Superconducting Diodes: A Universal Platform Beyond Intrinsic Symmetry Breaking
Authors: Xiaofan Shi, Ziwei Dou, Dong Pan, Guoan Li, Yupeng Li, Anqi Wang, Zhiyuan Zhang, Xingchen Guo, Xiao Deng, Bingbing Tong, Zhaozheng Lyu, Peiling Li, Fanming Qu, Guangtong Liu, Jianhua Zhao, Jiangping Hu, Li Lu, Jie Shen
Abstract: Modern industry seeks next-generation microelectronics with ultra-low dissipation and noise beyond semiconducting systems, where the superconducting electronics offer promise. Its physical foundation is the superconducting diode effect (SDE) with nonreciprocal supercurrent. SDE has hitherto mainly relied on material-specific intrinsic symmetry breaking in superconductors, suffering from low yield, controllability, and compatibility with further functional extension - an undesirable aspect for applications. Here, we demonstrated a field-free SDE due to the chemical potential shift from external circuit line resistance, which is generic and challenges the previous interpretations of the intrinsic symmetry breaking in superconductivity for zero-field SDE. Moreover, this SDE is circuit-level configurable since it can be electrically switched on/off with its polarity and efficiency precisely modulated via gate voltage and circuit reconfiguration, facilitating functional extension. Such a generic, controllable and extensible SDE addresses critical challenges in dissipationless circuit towards application, and thus establishes a robust platform for scalable superconducting electronics.

Title: Quantum spin Hall effects in van der Waals materials
Authors: Jian Tang, Thomas Siyuan Ding, Chengdong Wang, Ning Mao, Vsevolod Belosevich, Yang Zhang, Xiaofeng Qian, Qiong Ma
Abstract: The quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect, first predicted in graphene by Kane and Mele in 2004, has emerged as a prototypical platform for exploring spin-orbit coupling, topology, and electronic interactions. Initially realized experimentally in quantum wells exhibiting characteristic QSH signatures, the field has since expanded with the discovery of van der Waals (vdW) materials. This review focuses on vdW systems, which offer unique advantages: their exposed surfaces enable a combination of surface-sensitive spectroscopic and microscopic tools for comprehensive detection of the QSH state; mechanical stacking with other vdW layers facilitates symmetry engineering and proximity effects; and moiré engineering introduces layer skyrmion topological phases and strong correlation effects. We highlight two monolayer families, 1T$^\prime$-MX$_2$ and MM$^\prime$X$_4$, represented by WTe$_2$ and TaIrTe$_4$, respectively. These materials exhibit QSH phases intertwined with or in close proximity to other quantum phases, such as excitonic insulators, charge density waves, and superconductivity. Their low crystal symmetry and topology enable rich quantum geometrical responses, ranging from nonlinear Hall effects to circular photogalvanic effects. We also discuss moiré systems, which combine topology with flatband physics and enhanced correlations, driving spontaneous symmetry breaking and transitions from QSH to quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) states. Remarkably, fractionalized QAH and QSH states have recently been observed in moiré systems, significantly advancing the field of condensed matter physics. Finally, we explore emerging applications of QSH and derived materials, such as using nonlinear Hall effects for quantum rectification in microwave energy harvesting and harnessing fractional anomalous states for topological quantum computing.

Title: Strain Modulated Catalytic Activity of Pt2XSe3 (X = Hg, Zn) for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction
Authors: Caique C. Oliveira, Pedro A. S. Autreto
Abstract: The catalytic properties of Pt2XSe3 (X = Hg, Zn) in hydrogen-electrode- (HER-) based catalysts have been investigated based on state-of-the-art ab initio simulations. Our results show that the late transition metal sites (Hg and Zn) exhibit the best activity for HER in an acidic environment. Furthermore, lattice stretching and compression can effectively modulate the H binding energy, achieving almost thermoneutral adsorption at 3% compressive strain. The changes are attributed to the modulation in the d-band centers of late transition metal sites, as well as the depletion of charge population on bonding states, contributing to the destabilization of the H-metal bonds. Our contribution explores strain engineering as an effective strategy to tailor the activity of 2D mineral-based catalyst materials for HER, advancing our understanding of how mechanical manipulation can effectively modulate the catalytic properties of these materials.

Title: Getting out of a tight spot: Cooperative unclogging of hydrogel particles in disordered porous media
Authors: Sanjana Kamath, Laurent Talon, Meera Ramaswamy, Christopher A. Browne, Sujit S. Datta
Abstract: We use event-driven pore network modeling to study the transport of hydrogel particles through disordered porous media -- a process that underlies diverse applications. By simulating particle advection, deformation, and clogging at the pore scale, we identify a dimensionless "squeezing parameter" that quantitatively predicts the depth to which particles penetrate into a given medium across diverse conditions. Our simulations also uncover a surprising cooperative effect: adding more particles enables them to penetrate deeper into the medium. This phenomenon arises because individual particles redirect fluid to adjacent throats, forcing nearby particles through tight pores that they would otherwise clog. Altogether, these results help to establish a quantitative framework that connects microscopic particle mechanics to macroscopic transport behavior.

Title: Generalized many-body exciton g-factors: magnetic hybridization and non-monotonic Rydberg series in monolayer WSe\textsubscript{2}
Authors: Paulo E. Faria Junior, Daniel Hernangómez-Pérez, Tomer Amit, Jaroslav Fabian, Sivan Refaely-Abramson
Abstract: Magneto-optics of low dimensional semiconductors, such as monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides, offers a vast playground for exploring complex quantum phenomena. However, current \textit{ab initio} approaches fail to capture important experimental observations related to brightening of excitonic levels and their g-factor dependence. Here, we develop a robust and general first principles framework for many-body exciton g-factors by incorporating off-diagonal terms for the spin and orbital angular momenta of single-particle bands and many-body states for magnetic fields pointing in arbitrary spatial directions. We implement our framework using many-body perturbation theory via the GW-Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) and supplement our analysis with robust symmetry-based models, establishing a fruitful synergy between many-body GW-BSE and group theory. Focusing on the archetypal monolayer WSe\textsubscript{2}, we accurately reproduce the known results of the low-energy excitons including the Zeeman splitting and the dark/grey exciton brightening. Furthermore, our theory naturally reveals fundamental physical mechanisms of magnetic-field hybridization of higher-energy excitons (s- and p-like) and resolves the long-standing puzzle of the experimentally measured non-monotonic Rydberg series (1s--4s) of exciton g-factors. Our framework offers a comprehensive approach to investigate, rationalize, and predict the non-trivial interplay between magnetic fields, angular momenta, and many-body exciton physics in van der Waals systems.

Title: Theory of two-component superfluidity of microcavity polaritons
Authors: A. Nafis Arafat, Oleg L. Berman, Godfrey Gumbs, Peter B. Littlewood
Abstract: We investigate Bose-Einstein condensation and two-component superfluidity composed of upper (UP) and lower (LP) polaritons confined to a two-dimensional microcavity. By studying a modified Hamiltonian which incorporates interactions between both polariton branches, we derive the collective excitation spectrum and express the sound velocity as a function of detuning and Rabi splitting. Our analysis reveals that the interplay between effective masses and exciton-photon fractions in the UP and LP branches can significantly enhance the superfluid properties compared to a one-component condensate of only lower polaritons. Specifically, we discover that larger Rabi splitting increases the sound velocity and raises the critical temperature for superfluidity, while negative and positive detuning further favors a two-component condensate. Additionally, we demonstrate that these trends are consistent and applicable to various materials, including GaAs and the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), thereby indicating the potential for high-temperature superfluid phenomena in two-dimensional polariton systems. We hope these findings will provide a deeper understanding of the physics of structures containing multi-component polariton systems and generate experimental realizations of tunable quantum fluids with light.

Title: Strong coupling of chiral magnons in altermagnets
Authors: Zhejunyu Jin, Tianci Gong, Jie Liu, Huanhuan Yang, Zhaozhuo Zeng, Yunshan Cao, Peng Yan
Abstract: Altermagnets recently are identified as a new class of magnets that break the time-reversal symmetry without exhibiting net magnetization. The role of the dipole-dipole interaction (DDI) on their dynamical properties however is yet to be addressed. In this work, we show that the DDI can induce the strong coupling between exchange magnons with opposite chiralities in altermagnets, manifesting as a significant level repulsion in the magnon spectrum. Crucially, the predicted magnon-magnon coupling is highly anisotropic, and observable in practical experiments. These exotic features are absent in conventional antiferromagnets. Our findings open a new pathway for quantum magnonic information processing based on altermagnetism.

Title: Establishment of a compensation rule between the parameters of the Jonschers's Universal Relaxation Law in disordered materials
Authors: Anthony N. Papathanassiou, Elias Sakellis
Abstract: Experimental results for a huge number of different materials published during the past fifty years confirm the validity of the Jonscher's Universal Dielectric Response Law. Accordingly,the ac conductivity is a fractional power of frequency. Otemperatures evidence for a proportionality between the logarithm of the pre-exponential factor to the fractional exponent, spectra recorded at different temperatures evidence for a proportionality between the logarithm of the pre-exponential factor to the fractional exponent, as well. The dc conductivity, pre-exponential factor and fractional exponent of the ac conductivity are three state variables, which describe the electric and dielectric properties. These constitute a unique relation by merging the Dielectric Response Law and the Almond - West Scaling Rule, respectively. A partial differentiation chain theorem combined with the temperature dependencies of the dc conductivity, pre-exponential factor and fractional exponent of the ac response, establishes a compensation rule between the parameters of the Universal Dielectric Response Law. The compatibility of the present theorynwth published experimental data is discussed.

Title: Implementing advanced trial wave functions in fermion quantum Monte Carlo via stochastic sampling
Authors: Zhi-Yu Xiao, Zixiang Lu, Yixiao Chen, Tao Xiang, Shiwei Zhang
Abstract: We introduce an efficient approach to implement correlated many-body trial wave functions in auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC). To control the sign/phase problem in AFQMC, a constraint is derived from an exact gauge condition but is typically imposed approximately through a trial wave function or trial density matrix, whose quality can affect the accuracy of the method. Furthermore, the trial wave function can also affect the efficiency through importance sampling. The most natural form of the trial wave function has been single Slater determinants or their linear combinations. More sophisticated forms, for example, with the inclusion of a Jastrow factor or other explicit correlations, have been challenging to use and their implementation is often assumed to require a quantum computer. In this work, we demonstrate that a large class of correlated wave functions, written in the general form of multi-dimensional integrals over hidden or auxiliary variables times Slater determinants, can be implemented as trial wave function by coupling the random walkers to a generalized Metropolis sampling. We discuss the fidelity of AFQMC with stochastically sampled trial wave functions, which are relevant to both quantum and classical algorithms. We illustrate the method and show that an efficient implementation can be achieved which preserves the low-polynomial computational scaling of AFQMC. We test our method in molecules under bond stretching and in transition metal diatomics. Significant improvements are seen in both accuracy and efficiency over typical trial wave functions, and the method yields total ground-state energies systematically within chemical accuracy. The method can be useful for incorporating other advanced wave functions, for example, neural quantum state wave functions optimized from machine learning techniques, or for other forms of fermion quantum Monte Carlo.

Title: Anomalous Transport Gaps of Fractional Quantum Hall Phases in Graphene Landau Levels are Induced by Spin-Valley Entangled Ground States
Authors: Jincheng An, Ajit C. Balram, Udit Khanna, Ganpathy Murthy
Abstract: We evaluate the transport gaps in the most prominent fractional quantum Hall states in the $\mathbf{n}{=}0$ and $\mathbf{n}{=}1$ Landau Levels of graphene, accounting for the Coulomb interaction, lattice-scale anisotropies, and one-body terms. We find that the fractional phases in the $\mathbf{n}{=}0$ Landau level are bond-ordered, while those in the $\mathbf{n}{=}1$ Landau level are spin-valley entangled. This resolves a long-standing experimental puzzle [Amet, $\textit{et al.}$, Nat. Comm. $\mathbf{6}$, 5838 (2015)] of the contrasting Zeeman dependence of the transport gaps in the two Landau levels. The spin-valley entangled phases host gapless Goldstone modes that can be probed via bulk thermal transport measurements. As a byproduct of our computations, we place strong constraints on the values of the microscopic anisotropic couplings such that these are consistent with all known experimental results.

Title: High-Entropy Solid Electrolytes Discovery: A Dual-Stage Machine Learning Framework Bridging Atomic Configurations and Ionic Transport Properties
Authors: Xiao Fu, Jing Xu, Qifan Yang, Xuhe Gong, Jingchen Lian, Liqi Wang, Zibin Wang, Ruijuan Xiao, Hong Li
Abstract: The rapid development of computational materials science powered by machine learning (ML) is gradually leading to solutions to several previously intractable scientific problems. One of the most prominent is machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), which expedites the study of dynamical methods for large-scale systems. However, a promising field, high-entropy (HE) solid-state electrolytes (SEs) remain constrained by trial-and-error paradigms, lacking systematic computational strategies to address their huge and high-dimensional composition space. In this work, we establish a dual-stage ML framework that combines fine-tuned MLIPs with interpretable feature-property mapping to accelerate the high-entropy SEs discovery. Using Li$_3$Zr$_2$Si$_2$PO$_{12}$ (LZSP) as a prototype, the fine-tuned CHGNet-based relaxation provides atomic structure for each configuration, the structure features - mean squared displacement (SF-MSD) model predicts the ionic transport properties and identifies critical descriptors. The theoretical studies indicate that the framework can satisfy the multiple requirements including computational efficiency, generalization reliability and prediction accuracy. One of the most promising element combinations in the quinary HE-LZSP space containing 4575 compositions is identified with a high ionic conductivity of 4.53 mS/cm as an application example. The framework contains generalizability and extensibility to other SE families.

Title: Signatures of edge states in antiferromagnetic van der Waals Josephson junctions
Authors: Celia González-Sánchez, Ignacio Sardinero, Jorge Cuadra, Alfredo Spuri, José A. Moreno, Hermann Suderow, Elke Scheer, Pablo Burset, Angelo Di Bernardo, Rubén Seoane Souto, Eduardo J. H. Lee
Abstract: The combination of superconductivity and magnetic textures represents a promising approach to explore unconventional superconducting phenomena, including new correlated and topological phases. Van der Waals (vdW) materials have emerged in this context as a versatile platform to explore the interplay between these two competing orders. Here, we report on individual NbSe2/NiPS3/NbSe2 vdW Josephson junctions behaving as superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs), which we attribute to the interplay between the superconductivity of NbSe2 and the spin texture of the vdW antiferromagnetic insulator NiPS3. The SQUID behavior, which persists for in-plane magnetic fields of at least 6 T, is the result of interference between localized transport channels that form in two separate regions of the sample. Microscopic modeling of the antiferromagnet insulator/superconductor (AFI/S) interface reveals the formation of localized states at the edges of the junction that can lead to localized channels that dominate the transport. Our findings highlight the potential of vdW superconducting heterostructures with AFs as platforms for engineering and probing novel superconducting phenomena, and they establish a new route for lithographic-free SQUIDs that operate in high magnetic fields.

Title: Ligand-SOC enhanced $4f^5$ Kitaev antiferromagnet: Application to $\mathrm{SmI}_3$
Authors: Li-Hao Xia, Yi-Peng Gao, Zhao-Yang Dong, Jian-Xin Li
Abstract: The search for Kitaev quantum spin liquids (Kitaev-QSLs) in real materials has mainly focused on $4d$- and $5d$-electron honeycomb systems. A recent experimental study on the $4f^5$ honeycomb iodide $\mathrm{SmI}_3$ reported the absence of long-range magnetic order down to $0.1\ \text{K}$, suggesting a possible Kitaev-QSL phase. Motivated by the interplay between the complex exchange processes inherent to the $4f^5$ multi-electron configuration and the strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) of the iodine ligands, we systematically investigate the effective exchange interactions in $\mathrm{SmI}_3$ using the strong coupling expansion method. Our findings reveal that bond-dependent SOCs (bond-SOCs), extracted from relativistic density functional theory (DFT) calculations, significantly enhance the antiferromagnetic (AFM) Kitaev interaction, driving the system close to the AFM Kitaev point. A microscopic analysis based on the Slater-Koster approach further indicates that the strong SOC of the iodine ligands (ligand-SOC) is the origin of bond-SOCs and plays a pivotal role in mediating the superexchange processes. Additionally, we identify a spin-flop transition induced by the bond-SOCs, where the enhanced AFM Kitaev interactions shift the AFM order from the out-of-plane $[1, 1, 1]$-direction to an in-plane orientation, breaking the $C_3$ rotational symmetry. Linear spin-wave theory (LSWT) further predicts the emergence of gapless modes following the spin-flop transition, indicating enhanced fluctuations and increased instability near the AFM Kitaev point. Our results highlight the crucial role of strong ligand-SOC in stabilizing the dominant AFM Kitaev interactions in $\mathrm{SmI}_3$ and provide valuable insights for discovering new $f$-electron Kitaev-QSL candidates.

Title: AI-predicted PT-symmetric magnets
Authors: Hao Wu, Daniel F. Agterberg
Abstract: Parity-time-reversal-symmetric odd-parity antiferromagnetic (AFM1) materials are of interest for their symmetry-enabled quantum transport and optical effects. These materials host odd-parity terms in their band dispersion, leading to asymmetric energy bands and enabling responses such as the magnetopiezoelectric effect, nonreciprocal conductivity, and photocurrent generation. In addition, they may support a nonlinear spin Hall effect without spin-orbit coupling, offering an efficient route to spin current generation. We identify 23 candidate AFM1 materials by combining artificial intelligence, density functional theory (DFT), and symmetry analysis. Using a graph neural network model and incorporating AFM1-specific symmetry constraints, we screen Materials Project compounds for high-probability AFM1 candidates. DFT calculations show that AFM1 has the lowest energy among the tested magnetic configurations in 23 candidate materials. These include 3 experimentally verified AFM1 materials, 10 synthesized compounds with unknown magnetic structures, and 10 that are not yet synthesized.

Title: Coupling an elastic string to an active bath: the emergence of inverse damping
Authors: Aaron Beyen, Christian Maes, Ji-Hui Pei
Abstract: We consider a slow elastic string with Klein-Gordon dynamics coupled to a bath of run-and-tumble particles. We derive and solve the induced Langevin-Klein-Gordon string dynamics with explicit expressions for the streaming term, friction coefficient, and noise variance. These parameters are computed exactly in a weak coupling expansion. The induced friction is a sum of two terms: one entropic, proportional to the noise variance as in the Einstein relation for a thermal equilibrium bath, and a frenetic contribution that can take both signs. The frenetic part wins for higher bath persistence, making the total friction negative, and hence creating a wave instability akin to inverse Landau damping; the wave acceleration decreases again when the propulsion speed of the active particles gets too high.

Title: Unraveled origin of the multi-directional and super wide optical-response found on metal/n-Si
Authors: Takanari Yasuia, Kazuya Nakayama
Abstract: The optical responses for UV to NIR and muti-directional photo current have been found on Au (metal) on n-Si device. The unique phenomena have been unresolved since the first sample fabricated in 2007. The self organized sub-micron metal with various crystal faces was supposed to activate as an optical wave guide into Si surface. This, however, is insufficient to explain the unique features above. Thus, for more deep analysis, returning to consider the Si-band structure, indirect/direct transitions of inter conduction bands: X-W, X-K and {\Gamma}-L in the 1st Brillouin Zone/Van Hove singularity at L point, synchronizing with scattering, successfully give these characteristics a reasonable explanation. The calculation of the quantum efficiency between X-W and X-K agreed with those sensitivity for visible region (1.1 to 2.0 eV), the doping process well simulates it for NIR (0.6 to 1.0 eV). Doping electrons (~10^18/cm3) are filled up the zero-gap at around X of a reciprocal lattice point. This is why a lower limit of 0.6 eV was arisen in the sensitivity measurement. When the carrier scattering model was applied to the inter band (X-W, X-K and {\Gamma}-L) transitions, the reasonable interpretation was obtained for the directional dependence of photo-currents with UV (3.4 eV) and Visible (3.1 and 1.9 eV) excitation. Band to band scatterings assist to extend the available optical range and increase variety of directional responses. Utilizing this principle for some indirect transition semiconductors, it will be able to open the new frontier in photo-conversion system, where it will be released from those band gaps and directivity limitations.

Title: Ubiquity of rotational symmetry breaking in superconducting films, from Fe(Te,Se)/Bi$_2$Te$_3$ to Nb, and the effect of measurement geometry
Authors: Debarghya Mallick, Hee Taek Yi, Xiaoyu Yuan, Seongshik Oh
Abstract: FeTe$_{0.5}$Se$_{0.5}$/Bi$_2$Te$_3$ heterostructure is a promising new platform in the journey toward topological quantum computation, considering that first, FeTe$_{0.5}$Se$_{0.5}$ is itself known to be a topological superconductor (TSC) and second, the heterostructure has topological interface states that can be proximitized into TSC even if FTS fails to become TSC on its own. Here, we show that this system exhibits quasi-2D superconductivity, and utilizing the standard in-plane magneto-transport measurements, we discover two-fold anisotropy (a.k.a nematicity) in R$_{xx}$ and I$_c$ measurement, even though the system exhibits globally 12-fold symmetry. Then, we carried out similar measurements on a polycrystalline niobium (Nb) thin film, a well-known s-wave elemental superconductor, and found a similar two-fold symmetry even for this Nb system. This implies either that nematic behavior is ubiquitous or that the in-plane magneto-transport measurement scheme routinely used to detect nematicity is not a reliable method to probe nematicity. We show that the angle-dependent response of vortices in the superconducting regime to the magnetic Lorentz force is very likely the main cause behind the ubiquitous nematic behaviors of this measurement scheme. In other words, this measurement scheme is intrinsically two-fold, and is therefore not suitable to detect the nematicity. Accordingly, all the previous reports of nematicity based on similar measurement practices, reported on various samples, including thin films, bulk crystals, and exfoliated flakes, need to be reinterpreted.

Title: Statistical Mechanics and Categorical Entropy
Authors: Haiqi Wu, Kai Xu
Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between categorical entropy and von Neumann entropy of quantum lattices. We begin by studying the von Neumann entropy, proving that the average von Neumann entropy per site converges to the logarithm of an algebraic integer in the low-temperature and thermodynamic limits. Next, we turn to categorical entropy. Given an endofunctor of a saturated A-infinity-category, we construct a corresponding lattice model, through which the categorical entropy can be understood in terms of the information encoded in the model. Finally, by introducing a gauged lattice framework, we unify these two notions of entropy. This unification leads naturally to a sufficient condition for a conjectural algebraicity property of categorical entropy, suggesting a deeper structural connection between A-infinity-categories and statistical mechanics.

Title: Spinodal and Equilibrium Global Phase Diagram of the d=3 Merged Potts-Cubic-Clock Model: First-Order Equilibrium and Second-Order Spinodal Boundaries with Hidden Topologies from Renormalization-Group Theory
Authors: Umut Acikel, A. Nihat Berker
Abstract: A model that merges the Potts, cubic, and clock models is studied in spatial dimension d=3 by renormalization-group theory. Effective vacancies are included in the renormalization-group initial conditions. In the global phase diagram, 5 different ordered phases, namely ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic, antiferrimagnetic, axial, and a disordered phase are found, separated by first- and second-order phase boundaries. 8 different phase diagram cross-sections occur. When the effective vacancies are suppressed, the global spinodal phase diagram is found: All disordering phase transitions become second order, the disordered phase recedes, and 17 different phase diagram cross-sections occur, spinodality thus much enriching ordering behavior. In the spinodal phase diagram, the ferrimagnetic and antiferrimagnetic phases have reentrance. The employed renormalization group transformation is exact on the d=3 dimensional hierarchical model and Migdal-Kadanoff approximate on the cubic lattice.

Title: Self-patterning of Liquid Field's Metal for Enhanced Performance of Two-dimensional Semiconductor
Authors: Kwanghee Han, Heeyeon Lee, Minseong Kwon, Vinod Menon, Chaun Jang, Young Duck Kim
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals semiconductors show promise for atomically thin flexible and transparent optoelectronic devices in future this http URL, developing high-performance field-effect transistors (FETs) based on 2D materials is impeded by two key challenges, the high contact resistance at the 2D semiconductors-metal interface and the limited effective doping strategies. Here, we present a novel approach to overcome these challenges using self-propagating liquid Fields metal, a eutectic alloy with a low melting point of approximately 62 C. By modifying pre-patterned electrodes on WSe2 FETs through the deposition of Fields metal onto contact pad edges followed by vacuum annealing, we create new semimetal electrodes that seamlessly incorporate the liquid metal into 2D semiconductors. This integration preserves the original electrode architecture while transforming to semimetal compositions of Fields metal such as Bi, In, and Sn modifies the work functions to 2D semiconductors, resulting in reduced contact resistance without inducing Fermi-level pinning and charge carrier mobilities. Our method enhances the electrical performance of 2D devices and opens new avenues for designing high-resolution liquid metal circuits suitable for stretchable, flexible, and wearable 2D semiconductor applications.

Title: Supervised and Unsupervised protocols for hetero-associative neural networks
Authors: Andrea Alessandrelli, Adriano Barra, Andrea Ladiana, Andrea Lepre, Federico Ricci-Tersenghi
Abstract: This paper introduces a learning framework for Three-Directional Associative Memory (TAM) models, extending the classical Hebbian paradigm to both supervised and unsupervised protocols within an hetero-associative setting. These neural networks consist of three interconnected layers of binary neurons interacting via generalized Hebbian synaptic couplings that allow learning, storage and retrieval of structured triplets of patterns. By relying upon glassy statistical mechanical techniques (mainly replica theory and Guerra interpolation), we analyze the emergent computational properties of these networks, at work with random (Rademacher) datasets and at the replica-symmetric level of description: we obtain a set of self-consistency equations for the order parameters that quantify the critical dataset sizes (i.e. their thresholds for learning) and describe the retrieval performance of these networks, highlighting the differences between supervised and unsupervised protocols. Numerical simulations validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the robustness of the captured picture about TAMs also at work with structured datasets. In particular, this study provides insights into the cooperative interplay of layers, beyond that of the neurons within the layers, with potential implications for optimal design of artificial neural network architectures.

Title: Cooperative ligand-mediated transitions in simple macromolecules

Abstract: In biology, ligand mediated transitions (LMT), where the binding of a molecular ligand onto the binding site of a receptor molecule leads to a well-defined change in the conformation of the receptor, are often referred to as 'the second secret of life'. Sharp, cooperative transitions arise in many biological cases, while examples of synthetic cooperative systems are rare. This is because well-defined conformational states are hard to 'program' into a molecular design. Here, we impose an external constraint in the form of two immiscible liquids that effectively define and limit the available conformational states of two different synthetic and relatively simple macromolecules. We show that the mechanism of the observed cooperative transitions with ligand concentration is the coupling of ligand binding and conformation, similar to more complex biological systems. The systems studied are: (1) Hydrophobic polyelectrolytes (HPE), which are (bio) polymers that consist of hydrophobic as well as ionizable (proton and hydroxyl ligand-binding) functional groups. (2) Oligomeric metal chelators (OMC), which are oligomers composed of metal ion chelating repeating groups that are able to bind metal ions (considered as the 'ligands'), resulting in gel-like networks of oligomers crosslinked by coordinated metal ions. We find that in HPE, interactions between ligands and individual macromolecules explain the observed cooperative transitions. For OMC, coordinated bonds significantly enhance the degree of cooperativity, compared to HPE.

Title: Temperature- and charge carrier density-dependent electronic response in methylammonium lead iodide
Authors: Jiacheng Wang Jungmin Park, Lei Gao, Lucia Di Virgilio, Sheng Qu, Heejae Kim, Hai I. Wang, Li-Lin Wu, Wen Zeng, Mischa Bonn, Zefeng Ren, Jaco J. Geuchies
Abstract: Understanding carrier dynamics in photoexcited metal-halide perovskites is key for optoelectronic devices such as solar cells (low carrier densities) and lasers (high carrier densities). Trapping processes at low carrier densities and many-body recombination at high densities can significantly alter the dynamics of photoexcited carriers. Combining optical-pump/THz probe and transient absorption spectroscopy we examine carrier responses over a wide density range (10^14-10^19 cm-3) and temperatures (78-315K) in the prototypical methylammonium lead iodide perovskite. At densities below ~10^15 cm-3 (room temperature, sunlight conditions), fast carrier trapping at shallow trap states occurs within a few picoseconds. As excited carrier densities increase, trapping saturates, and the carrier response stabilizes, lasting up to hundreds of picoseconds at densities around ~10^17 cm-3. Above 10^18 cm-3 a Mott transition sets in: overlapping polaron wavefunctions lead to ultrafast annihilation through an Auger recombination process occurring over a few picoseconds. We map out trap-dominated, direct recombination-dominated, and Mott-dominated density regimes from 78-315 K, ultimately enabling the construction of an electronic phase diagram. These findings clarify carrier behavior across operational conditions, aiding material optimization for optoelectronics operating in the low (e.g. photovoltaics) and high (e.g. laser) carrier density regimes.

Title: Magnetic Anisotropy and Absence of Long-Range Order in the Triangular Magnet NdMgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$
Authors: Sonu Kumar, Jan Prokleška, Karol Załęski, Andrej Kancko, Cinthia Correa, Małgorzata Śliwińska-Bartkowiak, Gaël Bastien, Ross H. Colman
Abstract: The rare-earth triangular-lattice magnet NdMgAl11O19 offers an ideal platform for examining the interplay of crystal electric field effects, geometric frustration, and weak exchange interactions. Using high-quality single crystals, we measured magnetic susceptibility and magnetization down to 1.8 K, while specific heat was measured down to 45 mK. The system exhibits uniaxial anisotropy along the c-axis, with a ground-state Kramers doublet. A Curie-Weiss temperature of -0.38 K indicates weak antiferromagnetic interactions, while a specific heat anomaly at 81 mK suggests weak magnetic correlations with no long-range magnetic order. The absence of long-range magnetic order down to 45 mK makes it a very interesting material, which is highly frustrated but weakly correlated. Under external fields, the Zeeman splitting of the ground-state doublet leads to a field-tunable Schottky anomaly, with the specific heat peak shifting to 0.65 meV at 3 T, with g ~ 3.7. A Brillouin function fit to magnetization yields g ~ 3.72, confirming the quasi-paramagnetic nature of NdMgAl11O19. These findings highlight NdMgAl11O19 as a promising candidate to investigate quantum spin liquid and exotic spin states in frustrated triangular magnets.

Title: Uncovering relationships between the electronic self-energy and coupled-cluster doubles theory
Authors: Christopher J. N. Coveney
Abstract: We derive the coupled-cluster doubles (CCD) amplitude equations by introduction of the particle-hole-time decoupled electronic self-energy. This leads to an alternative ground state correlation energy obtained from the Green's function formalism which is exactly of the form obtained in coupled-cluster doubles theory. We demonstrate the relationship to the ionization potential/electron affinity equation-of-motion coupled-cluster doubles (IP/EA-EOM-CCD) eigenvalue problem by coupling the reverse-time self-energy contributions while maintaining particle-hole separability. The formal relationships established are demonstrated by exact solution of the Hubbard dimer.

Title: Ab Initio Prediction of Large Thermoelectric Effect in Distorted Heusler Alloy Ti-Fe-Sb Compound
Authors: Rifky Syariati, Athorn Vora-ud, Fumiyuki Ishii, Tosawat Seetawan
Abstract: The thermoelectric figure of merit of the Heusler alloy TiFe$_{1.5}$Sb was investigated by first-principles calculations of lattice thermal conductivity. The electronic thermal conductivity, electrical conductivity, and Seebeck coefficient are calculated by semi-classical Boltzmann transport theory. TiFe$_{1.5}$Sb was found to be thermally and dynamically stable, as confirmed by its phonon dispersion. Additionally, the small phonon band gap between acoustic and optical modes enhances phonon scattering, leading to a low lattice thermal conductivity of 0.703 W/mK at 300 K. Our study also reveals that TiFe$_{1.5}$Sb is a non-magnetic semiconductor. Notably, it demonstrates a significant longitudinal thermoelectric effect, with a Seebeck coefficient of 359.4 $\mu$V/K at 300 K. The combination of low lattice thermal conductivity and a high Seebeck coefficient results in a high thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) of 0.88 and 0.91 at 300 K and 500 K, respectively. These findings highlight the considerable potential of TiFe$_{1.5}$Sb as a promising material for thermoelectric device applications.

Title: First principles investigation of zb-TiSn: A promising narrow bandgap semiconductor
Authors: Sudeep R, Sarojini M, Uma Mahendra Kumar Koppolu
Abstract: We have investigated the structural stability of a binary compound TiSn in the zincblende symmetry. The phonon dispersion studies confirms that, TiSn with a nominal composition of 1:1 can exist in zincblende form. No imaginary frequencies are observed indicating the stable bonding nature of Ti-Sn. From the First principles calculations based on density functional theory, the resulting electronic band structure had revealed that zb-TiSn, is a narrow band gap semiconductor with an energy gap of 0.3 eV with GGA- PBE. The bonding nature is identified as polar covalent, determined from charge density difference plots and Bader charge analysis. Further more, the linear optical properties of zb-TiSn are derived from the Khon-Sham eigenvalues.

Title: Dirac fermions on a surface with localized strain
Authors: Samuel B. B. Almeida, J. E. G. Silva, C. A. S. Almeida
Abstract: We study the influence of a localized Gaussian deformation on massless Dirac fermions confined to a two-dimensional curved surface. Both in-plane and out-of-plane displacements are considered within the framework of elasticity theory. These deformations couple to the Dirac spinors via the spin connection and the vielbeins, leading to a position-dependent Fermi velocity and an effective geometric potential. We show that the spin connection contributes an attractive potential centered on the deformation and explore how this influences the fermionic density of states. Analytical and numerical solutions reveal the emergence of bound states near the deformation and demonstrate how the Lamé coefficients affect curvature and state localization. Upon introducing an external magnetic field, the effective potential becomes confining at large distances, producing localized Landau levels that concentrate near the deformation. A geometric Aharonov-Bohm phase is identified through the spinor holonomy. These results contribute to the understanding of strain-induced electronic effects in Dirac materials, such as graphene.

Title: G-type Antiferromagnetic BiFeO$_3$ is a Multiferroic $g$-wave Altermagnet
Authors: Andrea Urru, Daniel Seleznev, Yujia Teng, Se Young Park, Sebastian E. Reyes-Lillo, Karin M. Rabe
Abstract: G-type antiferromagnetic BiFeO$_3$ is shown to be an altermagnet. We present the band structure using an unconventional scheme designed to highlight the distinctive spin splitting which is characteristic of altermagnets. We define and show plots of the spin-splitting function in reciprocal space. We show that the nodal surfaces of the spin-splitting function that follow from symmetry can be classified into two types, which we call symmetry-enforced and continuity-enforced. We describe the spin-splitting function with a simple parametrization in a basis of symmetry-adapted plane waves. Using group-theory analysis based on irreducible representations of the crystallographic Laue group, we confirm that the altermagnetism of G-type BiFeO$_3$ is $g$-wave and present a complete classification table for the general three-dimensional case. Finally, we discuss the effect of ferroelectric switching on the altermagnetic order, and identify three classes of ferroelectric altermagnets.

Title: Dynamics of Poro-viscoelastic Wetting with Large Swelling
Authors: B. X. Zheng, T. S. Chan, E. H. van Brummelen, J. H. Snoeijer
Abstract: The deposition of droplets onto a swollen polymer network induces the formation of a wetting ridge at the contact line. Current models typically consider either viscoelastic effects or poroelastic effects, while polymeric gels often exhibit both properties. In this study, we investigate the growth of the wetting ridge using a comprehensive large deformation theory that integrates both dissipative mechanisms - viscoelasticity and poroelasticity. In the purely poroelastic case, following an initial instantaneous incompressible deformation, the growth dynamics exhibit scale-free behavior, independent of the elastocapillary length or system size. A boundary layer of solvent imbibition between the solid surface (in contact with the reservoir) and the region of minimal chemical potential is created. At later times, the ridge equilibrates on the diffusion timescale given by the elastocapillary length. When viscoelastic properties are incorporated, our findings show that, during the early stages (prior to the viscoelastic relaxation timescale), viscoelastic effects dominate the growth dynamics of the ridge and solvent transport is significantly suppressed. Beyond the relaxation time, the late-time dynamics closely resemble those of the purely poroelastic case. These findings are discussed in light of recent experiments, showing how our approach offers a new interpretation framework for wetting of polymer networks of increasing complexity.

Title: Room-temperature spin-lifetime anisotropy exceeding 60 in bilayer graphene spin valves proximity coupled to WSe$_2$
Authors: Timo Bisswanger, Anne Schmidt, Frank Volmer, Christoph Stampfer, Bernd Beschoten
Abstract: A spin lifetime anisotropy between in-plane and out-of-plane spins in bilayer graphene (BLG) can be achieved by spin-orbit proximity coupling of graphene to transition metal dichalcogenides. This coupling reduces the in-plane spin lifetime due to proximity-induced spin scattering, while the out-of-plane spin lifetime remains largely unaffected. We show that at room temperature spin lifetime anisotropy exceeds 60 in a bilayer graphene lateral spin valve proximity coupled to WSe$_2$. The out-of-plane spin lifetime of about 250 ps closely matches that of a BLG reference region not in contact with WSe$_2$. In contrast, the estimated in-plane spin lifetime of less than 4 ps leads to a complete suppression of the in-plane spin signal at the ferromagnetic Co/MgO spin detector. The proximity coupling of WSe$_2$ to BLG is particularly promising, as it does not compromise the charge carrier mobility within the graphene channel.

Title: A high-efficiency neuroevolution potential for tobermorite and calcium silicate hydrate systems with ab initio accuracy
Authors: Xiao Xu, Shijie Wang, Haifeng Qin, Zhiqiang Zhao, Zheyong Fan, Zhuhua Zhang, Hang Yin
Abstract: Tobermorite and Calcium Silicate Hydrate (C-S-H) systems are indispensable cement materials but still lack a satisfactory interatomic potential with both high accuracy and high computational efficiency for better understanding their mechanical performance. Here, we develop a Neuroevolution Machine Learning Potential (NEP) with Ziegler-Biersack-Littmark hybrid framework for tobermorite and C-S-H systems, which conveys unprecedented efficiency in molecular dynamics simulations with substantially reduced training datasets. Our NEP model achieves prediction accuracy comparable to DFT calculations using just around 300 training structures, significantly fewer than other existing machine learning potentials trained for tobermorite. Critically, the GPU-accelerated NEP computations enable scalable simulations of large tobermorite systems, reaching several thousand atoms per GPU card with high efficiency. We demonstrate the NEP's versatility by accurately predicting mechanical properties, phonon density of states, and thermal conductivity of tobermorite. Furthermore, we extend the NEP application to large-scale simulations of amorphous C-S-H, highlighting its potential for comprehensive analysis of structural and mechanical behaviors under various realistic conditions.

Title: Strain-induced magnetic damping anomaly in La$_{1-x}$Sr$_{x}$MnO$_{3}$ ($x=0.3$-$0.5$) thin films
Authors: Ryotaro Arakawa, Sachio Komori, Tomoyasu Taniyama
Abstract: Magnetic properties of La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$MnO$_{3}$ (LSMO) are highly sensitive to various factors such as the Sr doping level $x$, lattice strain, and oxygen stoichiometry due to the strongly correlated nature of $3d$ electrons. For the development of energy-efficient spintronic devices with ultra-low magnetic damping of LSMO, a thorough understanding of its complex magnetization dynamics is of great importance. In this work, we have measured ferromagnetic resonance of LSMO thin films on Nb-doped SrTiO$_3$ (Nb-STO) substrates over a wide temperature and frequency range and observed an anomalous increase in the Gilbert damping constant and a decrease in the effective saturation magnetization at temperatures below 100 K. The anomalies become more pronounced as the LSMO thickness decreases while they are not observed for LSMO on (LaAlO$_3$)$_{0.3}$(Sr$_2$TaAlO$_6$)$_{0.7}$ substrates with relatively small epitaxial strain. The results suggest that the epitaxial strain-induced magnetically dead layer at the LSMO/Nb-STO interface acts as a spin sink and leads to the anomalies in the magnetization dynamics.

Title: Fermi-liquid transport beyond the upper critical field in superconducting La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_7$ thin films
Authors: Yu-Te Hsu, Yidi Liu, Yoshimitsu Kohama, Tommy Kotte, Vikash Sharma, Yaoju Tarn, Yijun Yu, Harold Y. Hwang
Abstract: Unconventional superconductivity typically emerges out of a strongly correlated normal state, manifesting as a Fermi liquid with highly enhanced effective mass or a strange metal with $T$-linear resistivity in the zero-temperature limit. In Ruddlesden-Popper bilayer nickelates $R_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, superconductivity with a critical temperature ($T_{\rm c}$) exceeding 80 and 40 K has been respectively realised in bulk crystals under high pressure and thin films under compressive strain. These advancements create new materials platforms to study the nature of high-$T_{\rm c}$ superconductivity, calling for the characterisation of fundamental normal-state and superconducting parameters therein. Here we report detailed magnetotransport experiments on superconducting La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_7$ (LPNO) thin films under pulsed magnetic fields up to 64 T and access the normal-state behaviour over a wide temperature range between 1.5 and 300 K. We find that the normal state of LPNO exhibits the hallmarks of Fermi liquid transport, including $T^2$ temperature dependence of resistivity and Hall angle, and $H^2$ magnetoresistance obeying Kohler scaling. Using the empirical Kadowaki-Woods ratio relating the transport coefficient and electronic specific heat, we estimate a quasiparticle effective mass $m^*/m_e \simeq 10$ in PLNO, thereby revealing the highly renormalized Fermi liquid state which hosts the high-temperature nickelate superconductivity. Our results demonstrate that LPNO follows the same $T_{\rm c}/T_{\rm F}^*$ scaling observed across a wide variety of strongly correlated superconductors and provide crucial constraints for a viable model for superconductivity in bilayer nickelates.

Title: Bayesian sparse modeling for interpretable prediction of hydroxide ion conductivity in anion-conductive polymer membranes
Authors: Ryo Murakami, Kenji Miyatake, Ahmed Mohamed Ahmed Mahmoud, Hideki Yoshikawa, Kenji Nagata
Abstract: Anion-conductive polymer membranes have attracted considerable attention as solid electrolytes for alkaline fuel cells and electrolysis cells. Their hydroxide ion conductivity varies depending on factors such as the type and distribution of quaternary ammonium groups, as well as the structure and connectivity of hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains. In particular, the size and connectivity of hydrophilic domains significantly influence the mobility of hydroxide ions; however, this relationship has remained largely qualitative. In this study, we calculated the number of key constituent elements in the hydrophilic and hydrophobic units based on the copolymer composition, and investigated their relationship with hydroxide ion conductivity by using Bayesian sparse modeling. As a result, we successfully identified composition-derived features that are critical for accurately predicting hydroxide ion conductivity.

Title: Thermoelectric performance of Ni-Au metallic alloys determined by resonant scattering
Authors: Kacper Pryga, Bartlomiej Wiendlocha
Abstract: This work presents a theoretical study of the electronic structure and transport properties of Ni-Au alloys, recently identified as excellent thermoelectric metals with a power factor significantly exceeding that of conventional semiconductor thermoelectrics. Using first-principles calculations based on the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker method combined with the coherent-potential approximation (KKR-CPA) and the Kubo-Greenwood formalism, we demonstrate the key role of resonant scattering in determining the thermoelectric properties of these alloys. This is supported by calculated densities of states, Bloch spectral functions, electrical conductivity, and thermopower. Alloying Ni with Au not only induces resonant scattering but also leads to the formation of a flat band below the Fermi level. The combination of these two features results in high thermopower, arising from a transition between resonant and weak scattering regimes near the Fermi level. Our findings are further compared with analogous calculations for constantan, a Ni-Cu alloy long regarded as a reference thermoelectric metal. We show that differences between the Ni-Au and Ni-Cu systems explain why Ni-Au exhibits nearly twice the thermopower of Ni-Cu. Finally, we simulate the effect of lattice parameter variation on the thermoelectric performance of Ni-Au and suggest that this is a promising pathway for further enhancement, for example through additional alloying or layer deposition.

Title: Coherence, Transport, and Chaos in 1D Bose-Hubbard Model: Disorder vs. Stark Potential
Authors: Asad Ali, M.I. Hussain, Saif Al-Kuwari, M. T. Rahim, H. Kuniyil, Seyed Mohammad Hosseiny, Jamileh Seyed-Yazdi, Hamid Arian Zad, Saeed Haddadi
Abstract: We study quantum coherence and phase transitions in a finite-size one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model using exact numerical diagonalization. The system is investigated under the competing effects of thermal fluctuations, a Stark potential, and a disorder term. We compute several observables, including the condensate fraction, superfluid fraction, visibility, number fluctuations, and the $\ell_1$-norm of quantum coherence, to characterize the transition from the Mott insulator to the superfluid phase. In the standard Bose-Hubbard model, ground-state properties exhibit signatures of a quantum phase transition under open boundary conditions. While finite-size effects preclude an exact realization of the thermodynamic transition, our findings serve as indicators of the underlying quantum critical behavior of the disordered Bose-Hubbard model. At finite temperatures, this critical point shifts to a smooth crossover, reflecting the suppression of long-range coherence typical of larger systems. A nonzero Stark potential delays this crossover, promoting localization and the formation of non-superfluid condensates. In contrast, thermal fluctuations can induce unexpected coherence through fluctuation-driven tunneling. Disorder disrupts superfluidity but preserves local coherence, with thermal states exhibiting an enhanced $\ell_1$-norm of coherence within the Bose glass regime. Our results highlight how disorder, tilt, and temperature jointly reshape the coherence landscape, and offer valuable insights for quantum simulation and the characterization of quantum phases in strongly correlated systems. Non-ergodic behavior is observed in the clean system where the mean gap ratio stays below Poisson and Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE) values. With a Stark potential, level statistics shift from Poisson-like to near-GOE as tunneling increases, which indicates a crossover to semi-ergodic dynamics.

Title: Tunable Fujita-Miyazawa-Type Three-Body Force in Ultracold Atoms
Authors: Hiroyuki Tajima, Eiji Nakano, Kei Iida
Abstract: We show how a Fujita-Miyazawa-type three-body force emerges among three impurity atoms immersed in an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate near an interspecies Feshbach resonance. As a result of thermal average over excitations in the medium and impurities as well as expansion with respect to the impurity-medium and Feshbach resonance couplings, two superfluid phonons and a closed channel resonance play a role in producing an effective three-body force, as in the original three-nucleon case in which two pions and a $\Delta$ resonance are involved. The proposed Fujita-Miyazawa-type three-body force can be enhanced by tuning the closed-channel energy level via an external magnetic field, and moreover, its strength can be confirmed experimentally by measuring the impurity equation of state. Our result gives a new insight into an analogy between atomic polarons and nuclear few-body systems.

Title: Attraction-Induced Cluster Fragmentation and Local Alignment in Active Particle Systems
Authors: Sota Shimamura, Nen Saito, Shuji Ishihara
Abstract: We numerically studied active Brownian particles with attractive interactions. Contrary to our intuition, the attractive force between particles disrupts the formation of a single cluster observed in motility-induced phase separation, giving rise to a multi-cluster state characterized by a power-law distribution of cluster sizes. Remarkably, the self-propulsion directions spontaneously align within each cluster, resulting in enhanced cluster motility despite the absence of alignment interactions. This study revealed the intricate role of attractive interactions in the aggregation of motile systems.

Authors: Takumi Tagaki, Seiya Nishikawa, Shuji Ishihara
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of self-propelled particles under cyclic stretching, inspired by the characteristic pattern dynamics observed in microtubule (MT) motility assays subjected to uniaxial cyclic substrate stretching. We develop a self-propelled particle model that incorporates the elastic energy acting on the filaments due to substrate deformation, successfully reproducing the experimentally observed MT patterns. Additionally, the general framework of the model enables systematic exploration of collective responses to various substrate deformations, offering potential applications in the manipulation of MT patterns and other active matter systems.

Title: Extreme value statistics in a continuous time branching process: a pedagogical primer
Authors: Satya N. Majumdar, Alberto Rosso
Abstract: We study a continuous time branching process where an individual splits into two daughters with rate b and dies with rate a, starting from a single individual at t=0. We show that the model can be mapped exactly to a random walk problem where the population size N(t) performs a random walk on a positive semi-infinite lattice. The hopping rate of this random walker out of a site labelled n is proportional to n, i.e., the walker gets more and more `agitated' as it moves further and further away from the origin--we call this an `agitated random walk' (ARW). We demonstrate that this random walk problem is particularly suitable to obtain exact explicit results on the extreme value statistics, namely, on the distribution of the maximal population size M(t)= \max_{0\tau\le t}[N(\tau)] up to time t. This extreme value distribution displays markedly different behaviors in the three phases: (i) subcritical (b<a) (ii) critical (b=a) and (iii) supercritical (b>a). In the subcritical and critical phases , Q(L,t) becomes independent of time t for large t and the stationary distribution Q(L, \infty) decays to zero with increasing L, respectively exponentially (subcritical) and algebraically (critical). For finite but large t, the distribution at the critical point exhibits a scaling form Q(L,t)\sim f_c(L/{at})/L^2 where the scaling function f_c(z) has a nontrivial shape that we compute analytically. In the supercritical phase, the distribution Q(L,t) has a `fluid' part that becomes independent of t for large t and a `condensate' part (a delta peak centered at e^{(b-a)t}) which gets disconnected from the `fluid' part and moves rapidly to \infty as time increases. We also verify our analytical predictions via numerical simulations finding excellent agreement.

Title: teMatDb: A High-Quality Thermoelectric Material Database with Self-Consistent ZT Filtering
Authors: Byungki Ryu, Ji Hui Son, Sungjin Park, Jaywan Chung, Hye-Jin Lim, SuJi Park, Yujeong Do, SuDong Park
Abstract: This study presents a curated thermoelectric material database, teMatDb, constructed by digitizing literature-reported data. It includes temperature-dependent thermoelectric properties (TEPs), Seebeck coefficient, electrical resistivity, thermal conductivity, and figure of merit (ZT), along with metadata on materials and their corresponding publications. A self-consistent ZT (Sc-ZT) filter set was developed to measure ZT errors by comparing reported ZT's from figures with ZT's recalculated from digitized TEPs. Using this Sc-ZT protocol, we generated tMatDb272, comprising 14,717 temperature-property pairs from 272 high-quality TEP sets across 262 publications. The method identifies various types of ZT errors, such as resolution error, publication bias, ZT overestimation, interpolation and extrapolation error, and digitization noise, and excludes inconsistent samples from the dataset. teMatDb272 and the Sc-ZT filtering framework offer a robust dataset for data-driven and machine-learning-based materials design, device modeling, and future thermoelectric research.

Title: Revealing molecule-internal mechanisms that control phonon heat transport through single-molecule junctions by a genetic algorithm
Authors: Matthias Blaschke, Fabian Pauly
Abstract: Measurements of the thermal conductance of single-molecule junctions have recently been reported for the first time. It is presently unclear, how much the heat transport can be controlled through molecule-internal effects. The search for molecules with lowest and highest thermal conductance is complicated by the gigantic chemical space. Here we describe a systematic search for molecules with a low or a high phononic thermal conductance using a genetic algorithm. Beyond individual structures of well performing molecules, delivered by the genetic algorithm, we analyze patterns and identify the different physical and chemical mechanisms to suppress or enhance phonon heat flow. In detail, mechanisms revealed to reduce phonon transport are related to the choice of terminal linker blocks, substituents and corresponding mass disorder or destructive interference, meta couplings and molecule-internal twist. For a high thermal conductance, the molecules should instead be rather uniform and chain-like. The identified mechanisms are systematically analyzed at different levels of theory, and their significance is classified. Our findings are expected to be important for the emerging field of molecular phononics.

Title: A many-body marker for three-dimensional topological insulators with inversion symmetry
Authors: Federico Becca, Alberto Parola
Abstract: We introduce a generalization of the previously defined many-body marker for two-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological insulators [I. Gilardoni {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. B {\bf 106}, L161106 (2022)] to distinguish trivial, weak-, and strong-topological insulators in three dimensions, in presence of the inversion symmetry. The marker is written in term of ground-state expectation values of position operators and can be employed to detect topological phases of interacting systems beyond mean-field approximations, e.g., within quantum Monte Carlo techniques. Here, we show that the correct results of the non-interacting limit is reproduced by the many-body marker.

Authors: James P. Crutchfield, Alexandra Jurgens
Abstract: We develop information theory for the temporal behavior of memoryful agents moving through complex -- structured, stochastic -- environments. We introduce information processes -- stochastic processes produced by cognitive agents in real-time as they interact with and interpret incoming stimuli. We provide basic results on the ergodicity and semantics of the resulting time series of Shannon information measures that monitor an agent's adapting view of uncertainty and structural correlation in its environment.

Title: C-BerryANC: A first-principle C++ code to calculate Berry Curvature dependent anomalous Nernst conductivity in any material
Authors: Vivek Pandey, Sudhir K. Pandey
Abstract: The anomalous Nernst conductivity (ANC) is a key transport property in magnetic and topological materials, arising from the Berry curvature ($\boldsymbol\Omega$) of electronic bands. It offers deep insight into the underlying topology and thermoelectric behavior. While Wannier interpolation have become popular for calculating ANC due to their computational efficiency, their accuracy critically depends on the quality of the Wannierization, which can be challenging for entangled bands or materials with complex band crossings. These limitations highlight the need for a direct first-principles approach to reliably compute ANC from ab-initio electronic structures. Here, we present a C++ based code named C-BerryANC that calculates $\boldsymbol\Omega$-dependent ANC by directly using the eigenvalues and momentum-matrices obtained from DFT calculations. Presently, the code is interfaced with WIEN2k package which uses all-electron approach and full-potential linearized augmented plane wave (FP-LAPW) based method. For efficiently handling dense k-mesh, calculation of $\boldsymbol\Omega$ is made parallel over k-points using the OpenMP method. Additionally, the code stores band-resolved components of $\boldsymbol\Omega$ in binary files thereby reducing the memory occupancy and providing fast post-process option to compute ANC for any range of chemical potential and temperature values. Also, as compilation of C++ modules produce executable files which are in machine level language, computational speed of C-BerryANC is very fast. The code is benchmarked over some well-known materials exhibiting ANC. These includes- Pd, Fe$_3$Al & Co$_2$FeAl. The obtained values of ANC is found to in good agreement with the previously reported data. This highlights the accuracy, efficieny and reliability of the C-BerryANC code.

Title: Exploring Self-Organized Criticality through Memory-Driven Random Walks on Complex Networks
Authors: Mohammad Jafari
Abstract: We present a stochastic model of memory-driven random walks on complex networks, where a single walker explores the network through a combination of local random walks and memory-based resetting. The walker either moves to a neighboring node or resets to a previously visited node with a probability proportional to the visitation this http URL node in the network accumulates stress with every visit, and once the accumulated stress exceeds a threshold, the node topples, redistributing the stress to its neighbors. This redistribution can trigger cascading avalanches across the network. We demonstrate that this simple memory-driven mechanism, combined with local stress dynamics, leads to the emergence of self-organized criticality (SOC) across various network topologies, including Small-World and BA this http URL resulting avalanche size distributions follow power-law statistics, with exponents that are consistent with those found in classical SOC systems. Our model requires no fine-tuning of parameters to achieve criticality and offers a novel insight into how memory, network structure, and local stress interactions can give rise to emergent critical phenomena. These findings have implications for understanding cascading failures in infrastructure, neural avalanches in brain dynamics, and information spread in complex networks.

Title: Review of point defect structures in hexagonal close packed metals and across the Periodic Table
Authors: Andrew Ralph Warwick, Pui-Wai Ma, Sergei Lvovich Dudarev
Abstract: We present a comprehensive ab initio dataset of formation energies and elastic properties of intrinsic point defects across all the transition and rare earth hexagonal close packed (hcp) metals, as well as metalloid elements with hcp crystal structure. Point defect properties appear weakly correlated with the c/a ratio of the hcp lattice. Instead, it is the position of an element in the Periodic Table that primarily defines the relaxation volume tensor, elastic dipole tensor and formation energy of a point defect. This suggests that the local variations in the electronic structure and interatomic bonding at the core of a defect dominate its properties, as opposed to long-range elastic deformations. Across all the metals, we find that the relaxation volumes of vacancies and self-interstitial defects are correlated with atomic volumes, with values of -0.35 and 1.46 atomic volumes for a vacancy and a self-interstitial defect, respectively, providing a universally good approximation independent of the crystal structure. This study complements and completes the existing point defect databases spanning body-centred cubic and face-centred cubic metals.

Title: Structural, magnetic, and nanoacoustic characterization of Co/Pt superlattices
Authors: E. R. Cardozo de Oliveira, C. Xiang, C. Borrazás, S. Sandeep, J. E. Gómez, M. Vásquez Mansilla, N. Findling, L. Largeau, N. D. Lanzillotti-Kimura, M. Granada
Abstract: Superlattices presenting a spatial modulation of the elastic properties appear as a main tool to reach the THz regime in nanoacoustic devices. The exploration of alternative materials with multifunctional properties remains a fertile domain of research. In this work, we study the structural, magnetic, and acoustic characteristics of nanometric superlattices made of Pt/Co. The samples present a well defined periodicity, as determined by X-ray reflectometry, whereas scanning transmission electron microscopy with local compositional analysis reveals that the superlattices present a modulation in composition instead of sharp interfaces. The policrystalline nature of the superlattices is evidenced both by X ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. Magnetization measurements show a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy for the higher Co concentrations. Picosecond acoustic experiments evidence that the studied samples support short-lived acoustic modes up to 900 GHz, and up to 7 acoustic echoes at lower this http URL are promising results for the development of magnetoacoustic devices working at ultrahigh frequencies.

Title: Disorder-Induced Suppression of Antiferromagnetic Magnon Transport in Cr2O3
Authors: Josiah Keagy, Haoyu Liu, Junyu Tang, Weilun Tan, Wei Yuan, Sumukh Mahesh, Ran Cheng, Jing Shi
Abstract: We explore the impact of spin disorder associated with structural defects on antiferromagnetic magnon transport by probing the spin-flop transition of Cr2O3 using spin Seebeck effect measurements. By fabricating homoepitaxial Cr2O3 films grown on smooth Cr2O3 crystals, we systematically vary the thickness of the films in which the presence of point defects modulates the spin-flop transition field. We find that magnon propagation through the film is entirely suppressed for film thickness greater than 3 nm, revealing the pivotal role of disorder in governing antiferromagnetic magnon transport.

Title: Driven Probe Particle Dynamics in a Bubble Forming System
Authors: C. Reichhardt, C.J.O. Reichhardt
Abstract: We numerically examine the dynamics of a probe particle driven at a constant force through an assembly of particles with competing long-range repulsion and short-range attraction that forms a bubble or stripe state. In the bubble regime, we identify several distinct types of motion, including an elastic or pinned regime where the probe particle remains inside a bubble and drags all other bubbles with it. There is also a plastic bubble phase where the bubble in which the probe particle is trapped is able to move past the adjacent bubbles. At larger drives, there is a breakthrough regime where the probe particle jumps from bubble to bubble, and in some cases, can induce correlated rotations or plastic rearrangements of the particles within the bubbles. At the highest drives, the probe particle moves sufficiently rapidly that the background particles undergo only small distortions. The distinctive dynamic flow states and the transitions between them are accompanied by signatures in the effective drag on the driven particle, jumps in the velocity-force curves, and changes in the time-dependent velocity fluctuations. We map the dynamic phase diagram for this system for varied interaction lengths, bubble sizes, and densities.

Title: Fluctuations in DNA Packing Density Drive the Spatial Segregation between Euchromatin and Heterochromatin
Authors: Luming Meng, Boping Liu, Qiong Luo
Abstract: In the crowded eukaryotic nucleus, euchromatin and heterochromatin segregate into distinct compartments, a phenomenon often attributed to homotypic interactions mediated by liquid liquid phase separation of chromatin associated proteins. Here, we revisit genome compartmentalization by examining the role of in vivo DNA packing density fluctuations driven by ATP dependent chromatin remodelers. Leveraging DNA accessibility data, we develop a polymer based model that captures these fluctuations and successfully reproduces genome wide compartment patterns observed in HiC data, without invoking homotypic interactions. Further analysis reveals that density fluctuations in a crowded nuclear environment elevate the system energy, while euchromatin heterochromatin segregation facilitates energy dissipation, offering a thermodynamic advantage for spontaneous compartment formation. These findings suggest that euchromatin heterochromatin segregation may arise through a non equilibrium, self organizing process, providing new insights into genome organization.

Title: Universal Symmetries in Twisted Moiré Materials
Authors: Mohammed M. Al Ezzi, Albert Zhu, Daniel Bennett, Daniel T. Larson, Efthimios Kaxiras
Abstract: Two-dimensional multi-layer materials with an induced moiré pattern, either due to strain or relative twist between layers, provide a versatile platform for exploring strongly correlated and topological electronic phenomena. While these systems offer unprecedented tunability, their theoretical description remains challenging due to their complex atomic structures and large unit cells. A notable example is twisted bilayer graphene, where even the relevant symmetry group remains unsettled despite its critical role in constructing effective theories. Here, we focus on twisted bilayer graphene and use a combination of analytical methods, molecular dynamics simulations, and first-principles calculations to show that twisted atomic configurations with distinct microscopic symmetries converge to a universal interlayer structure that governs the low-energy physics. This emergent universality provides a robust foundation for symmetry-respecting models and offers insight into the role of commensurability in real twisted moiré systems.

Title: Improvement of the simplification method for the local two-particle full-vertex towards precise frequency behavior
Authors: Ryota Mizuno, Kazuhiko Kuroki, Masayuki Ochi
Abstract: Estimating the local two-particle vertex functions, which are crucial for capturing the spatial fluctuation of the effective field beyond the single-site DMFT, is still challenging. In our previous work, we developed a computationally efficient method for estimating the local full-vertex in DMFT, where we can obtain the local two-particle full-vertex from the one-particle self-energy. In this study, we further enhance our method by refining its formulation to be more faithful to the diagrammatic structure of the full-vertex. With this improvement, we can qualitatively reproduce the characteristic frequency structures of the full-vertex obtained by the numerically exact methods. In particular, the improved version of the simplified full-vertex captures a sharp value change in the cross structure.

Title: $b$-axis and $c$-axis Knight shift measurements in the superconducting state on ultraclean UTe$_2$ with $T_c$ = 2.1 K
Authors: Hiroki Matsumura, Yuki Takahashi, Katsuki Kinjo, Shunsaku Kitagawa, Kenji Ishida, Yo Tokunaga, Hironori Sakai, Shinsaku Kambe, Ai Nakamura, Yusei Shimizu, Yoshiya Homma, Dexin Li, Fuminori Honda, Atsushi Miyake, Dai Aoki
Abstract: Knight shifts along the $b$ and $c$ axes ($K_b$ and $K_c$) at two crystallographically distinct Te sites were measured down to 70 mK using $^{125}$Te nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) on an ultraclean UTe$_2$ single crystal with a superconducting (SC) transition temperature $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ = 2.1 K. This was carried out to determine the $\boldsymbol{d}$-vector components, which are the order parameter in the spin-triplet pairing. Although the decrease in $K_b$ and $K_c$ is comparable to the theoretical estimation of the SC diamagnetic shielding effect, it is confirmed, by taking the difference between two Knight shifts at the distinct Te sites, that the spin susceptibility along the $b$ and $c$ axes decreases in the SC state. Taking into account the large decrease in $K_a$ in the SC state, we conclude that the $\boldsymbol{d}$ vector has components along all three crystal axes.

Title: In-depth Investigation of Conduction Mechanism on Defect-induced Proton-conducting Electrolytes BaHfO$_3$
Authors: Peng Feng, Hang Ma, Kuan Yang, Yingjie Lv, Ying Liang, Tianxing Ma, Jiajun Linghu, Zhi-Peng Li
Abstract: This study utilizes first-principles computational methods to comprehensively analyze the impact of A-site doping on the proton conduction properties of BaHfO$_3$. The goal is to offer theoretical support for the advancement of electrolyte materials for solid oxide fuel cells. Our research has uncovered that BaHfO$_3$ demonstrates promising potential for proton conduction, with a low proton migration barrier of 0.28 eV, suggesting efficient proton conduction can be achieved at lower temperatures. Through A-site doping, particularly with low-valence state ions and the introduction of Ba vacancies, we can effectively decrease the formation energy of oxygen vacancies (Evac), leading to an increase in proton concentration. Additionally, our study reveals that the primary mechanism for proton migration in BaHfO$_3$ is the Grotthuss mechanism rather than the Vehicle mechanism. Examination of the changes in lattice parameters during proton migration indicates that while doping or vacancy control strategies do not alter the mode of H+ migration, they do influence the migration pathway and barrier. These findings provide valuable insights into optimizing the proton conduction properties of BaHfO$_3$ through A-site doping and lay a solid theoretical foundation for the development of novel, highly efficient Solid oxide fuel cell electrolyte materials.

Title: Longitudinal magnetoconductivity in chiral multifold semimetals exemplified by pseudospin-1 nodal points
Authors: Ipsita Mandal
Abstract: We embark on computing the longitudinal magnetoconductivity within the semiclassical Boltzmann formalism, where an isotropic triple-point semimetal (TSM) is subjected to collinear electric ($\boldsymbol E $) and magnetic ($\boldsymbol B$) fields. Except for the Drude part, the $B$-dependence arises exclusively from topological properties like the Berry curvature and the orbital magnetic moment. We solve the Boltzmann equations exactly in the linear-response regime, applicable in the limit of weak/nonquantising magnetic fields. The novelty of our investigation lies in the consideration of the truly multifold character of the TSMs, where the so-called flat-band (flatness being merely an artifact of linear-order approximations) is made dispersive by incorporating the appropriate quadratic-in-momentum correction in the effective Hamiltonian. It necessitates the consideration of interband scatterings within the same node as well, providing a complex interplay of intraband, interband, intranode, and internode processes. The exact results are compared with those obtained from a naive relaxation-time approximation.

Title: Spin-Waves without Spin-Waves: A Case for Soliton Propagation in Starling Flocks
Authors: Andrea Cavagna, Guido Cimino, Javier Cristín, Matteo Fiorini, Irene Giardina, Angelo Giustiniani, Tomás S. Grigera, Stefania Melillo, Roberto A. Palombella, Leonardo Parisi, Antonio Ponno, Mattia Scandolo, Zachary S. Stamler
Abstract: Collective turns in starling flocks propagate linearly with negligible attenuation, indicating the existence of an underdamped sector in the dispersion relation. Beside granting linear propagation of the phase perturbations, the real part of the frequency should also yield a spin-wave form of the unperturbed correlation function. However, new high-resolution experiments on real flocks show that underdamped traveling waves coexist with an overdamped Lorentzian correlation. Theory and experiments are reconciled once we add to the dynamics a Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou term.

Title: Magnon-Driven Phononic Frequency Comb in Linear Elastic Media
Authors: Ziyang Yu, Zhejunyu Jin, Qianjun Zheng, Peng Yan
Abstract: Phononic frequency combs (PFCs) typically require nonlinear elastic media, limiting their frequency range and stability. Here, we propose a transformative approach to generate PFCs in purely linear elastic media by harnessing the magnon nonlinearities, offering a new paradigm for frequency comb physics. By tuning the magnon-phonon coupling confined in a magnetic disk of a vortex state into the strong coupling regime, we demonstrate an efficient nonlinearity transfer from magnons to phonons. This mechanism is able to produce GHz-range PFCs with comb spacing set by the vortex core's gyration frequency. Full micromagnetic simulations verify our theoretical predictions, confirming robust comb formation at 3.5 GHz with 0.4 GHz spacing. This approach overcomes the sub-MHz constraints of conventional PFCs, enabling applications in high-precision metrology, nanoscale sensing, and quantum technologies. Our findings also deepen the understanding of the nonlinear dynamics in hybrid magnon-phonon systems and provide a versatile platform for exploring frequency combs in diverse physical systems.

Title: Symmetry-broken charge-ordered ground state in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ Kagome metal
Authors: Manex Alkorta, Martin Gutierrez-Amigo, Chunyu Guo, Philip J. W. Moll, Maia G. Vergniory, Ion Errea
Abstract: The newly discovered family of non-magnetic Kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=K,Rb,Cs) offers a unique platform for studying the interplay between a charge density wave transition with superconductivity, non-trivial topology, and spontaneous time-reversal this http URL characterizing the charge density wave phase is crucial to understand and model all these exotic properties, it remains unresolved. In this work, we use first-principles calculations of the free-energy, incorporating both ionic kinetic energy and anharmonic effects, to resolve the atomistic phase diagram of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ and its charge ordering structure. Our results reveal a competition between metastable stacking orders of the reconstructed vanadium Kagome layers, which are energetically favored to form exclusively a triangular-hexagonal arrangement, allowing the possibility of competitive different domains and chiral order. Consistent with experimental observations, we find that the $2\times2\times2$ and $2\times2\times4$ modulations are nearly degenerate in free energy, and are abruptly melted into the high-symmetry hexagonal phase around 90 K. The transition is first-order but compatible with a measurable phonon-softening. Remarkably, even if the six-fold and inversion symmetry are intrinsically broken by the out-of-plane stacking, this does not lead to measurable anisotropy in the in-plane conductivity as suggested by measurements.

Title: Composition dependent $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ band parameters for wurtzite (Al,Ga)N alloys from density functional theory
Authors: Amit Kumar Singh, Alvaro Gomez-Iglesias, Stefan Schulz
Abstract: UV emitters based on the semiconductor alloy aluminium gallium nitride, (Al,Ga)N, have attracted significant interest in recent years due to their potential for optoelectronic devices. To guide the design of such devices with improved efficiencies, theoretical frameworks based on so-called k.p methods have found widespread application in the literature. Given that k.p models are empirical in nature, parameters such as effective masses or crystal field splitting energies of (Al,Ga)N alloys have to be provided as input from first-principles calculations or experiment. Although these parameters are available for GaN and AlN, detailed information on their composition dependence is sparse. Here, we address this question and provide (Al,Ga)N band parameters for widely used k.p Hamiltonians. We start from density functional theory (DFT) to sample the electronic structure of (Al,Ga)N alloys over the full composition range. The k.p parameters are treated as free parameters to reproduce the DFT data. For GaN and AlN the parameters extracted here agree well with literature values. When turning to the composition dependence of the k.p parameters, our calculations show that most parameters deviate significantly from a linear interpolation of the GaN and AlN values, an approximation widely made in the literature. Moreover, to describe changes in the band parameters with Al content, composition dependent bowing parameters have to be considered for an accurate description of the DFT data. Finally, our analysis also provides initial insight into consequences of the nonlinear composition dependence of the k.p parameters for the electronic structure of (Al,Ga)N alloys. We find that in particular the band ordering is affected by the nonlinear evolution of the crystal field splitting energy with composition, an important aspect for the light polarization characteristics of high Al content (Al,Ga)N alloys.

Title: Machine Learning the Energetics of Electrified Solid/Liquid Interfaces
Authors: Nicolas Bergmann, Nicéphore Bonnet, Nicola Marzari, Karsten Reuter, Nicolas G. Hörmann
Abstract: We present a response-augmented machine learning (ML) approach to the energetics of electrified metal surfaces. We leverage local descriptors to learn the work function as the first-order energy change to introduced bias charges and stabilize this learning through Born effective charges. This permits the efficient extension of ML interatomic potential architectures to include finite bias effects up to second-order. Application to OH at Cu(100) rationalizes the experimentally observed pH-dependence of the preferred adsorption site in terms of a non-Nernstian charge-induced site switching.

Title: Boundary local time on wedges and prefractal curves
Authors: Yilin Ye, Denis S. Grebenkov
Abstract: We investigate the boundary local time on polygonal boundaries such as finite generations of the Koch snowflake. To reveal the role of angles, we first focus on wedges and obtain the mean boundary local time, its variance, and the asymptotic behavior of its distribution. Moreover, we establish the coupled partial differential equations for higher-order moments. Next, we propose an efficient multi-scale Monte Carlo approach to simulate the boundary local time, as well as the escape duration and position of the associated reaction event on a polygonal boundary. This numerical approach combines the walk-on-spheres algorithm in the bulk with an approximate solution of the escape problem from a sector. We apply it to investigate how the statistics of the boundary local time depends on the geometric complexity of the Koch snowflake. Eventual applications to diffusion-controlled reactions on partially reactive boundaries, including the asymptotic behavior of the survival probability, are discussed.

Title: Giant spontaneous polarization in zincblende III-V semiconductors
Authors: Jesus Cañas, Mohamed Yassine, Oliver Ambacher
Abstract: The discovery of ferroelectricity in wurtzite nitrides has paved the way for measuring and understanding spontaneous polarization in III-V semiconductors. However, the calculation of polarization effects at heterointerfaces - crucial for numerous electronic and photonic applications - remains a topic of debate. The need for a reference structure to calculate spontaneous polarization has led to discussions over whether to use the zincblende or layered hexagonal structures as the reference for wurtzite crystals. In this work, we argue that the layered hexagonal structure is not only a better reference due to its vanishing formal polarization but also the only physically correct choice for the wurtzite system. This follows from the fact that spontaneous polarization is rigorously defined through the ferroelectric switching. Applying this definition, we extend our analysis to III-V zincblende semiconductors and reveal that their spontaneous polarization is approximately three times larger than that of wurtzite, thereby refuting the longstanding assumption that it is zero. Through this example, we illustrate that spontaneous polarization is not inherently linked to charge density at interfaces.

Title: Statistical physics of active matter, cell division and cell aggregation
Authors: Jean-François Joanny, Joseph O. Indekeu
Abstract: In these Lecture Notes we aim at clarifying how soft matter physics, and herein notably statistical mechanics and fluid mechanics, can be engaged to understand and manipulate non-equilibrium systems consisting of numerous (microscopic) constituents that convert (chemical) energy to mechanical energy, or vice versa, and that are known as active matter. Hydrodynamic theory, vitally extended to include (anisotropic) active stress, provides an astonishingly successful scaffold for tackling the problem of spontaneous flow in active nematics, all the way to active turbulence. The laws of physics, nonchalantly tresspassing the border crossing between inanimate particle and living cell, are seen to perform cum laude in describing the bi-directional coupling between division and apoptosis on the one hand and mechanical stress on the other. Fluidization of cellular tissue by cell division is a conceptual leap in this arena. The active behavior of nematic tissues (cell extrusion, multilayer formation, ...) turns out to be controlled by topological defects in the orientational order. Playgrounds by excellence for exhibiting stress-growth coupling are multicellular spheroids serving as model tumors, and cysts used as stem cell factories for cell therapy. Finally, our study of villi and crypts in the intestine furnishes a synthesis of various concepts explored. Cell mechanical pressure and cell layer geometrical curvature turn out to provide the dynamical ingredients which, when coupled to the cell division rate, allow one to develop a physical theory of tissue morphology which hopefully will have practical impact on cancer research.

Title: Density-Functional Green Function Theory: Dynamical exchange-correlation field in lieu of self-energy
Authors: F. Aryasetiawan
Abstract: The one-particle Green function of a many-electron system is traditionally formulated within the self-energy picture. A different formalism was recently proposed, in which the self-energy is replaced by a dynamical exchange-correlation field, which acts on the Green function locally in both space and time. It was found that there exists a fundamental quantity, referred to as the dynamical exchange-correlation hole, which can be interpreted as effective density fluctuations induced in a many-electron system when a hole or an electron is introduced into the system, as in photoemission and inverse photoemission experiments. The dynamical exchange-correlation potential is simply the Coulomb potential of this exchange-correlation hole, which fulfils a sum rule and an exact constraint, identical to those satisfied by the static exchange-correlation hole in density-functional theory. The proposed formalism has been applied to a number of model systems such as the half-filled one-dimensional Hubbard model, the one-dimensional antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model, and the single-impurity Anderson model. The dynamical exchange-correlation hole and field of the homogeneous electron gas have also been studied with the view of constructing a density-functional approximation such as the local-density approximation. The availability of simple but accurate approximations for the exchange-correlation potential would circumvent costly computations of the traditional self-energy. The formalism may also provide new perspectives and insights into the many-body problem.

Title: Beyond the Electric Dipole Approximation: Electric and Magnetic Multipole Contributions Reveal Biaxial Water Structure from SFG Spectra at the Air-Water Interface
Authors: Louis Lehmann, Maximilian R. Becker, Lucas Tepper, Alexander P. Fellows, Álvaro Díaz Duque, Martin Thämer, Roland R. Netz
Abstract: The interpretation of sum-frequency generation (SFG) spectra has been severely limited by the absence of quantitative theoretical predictions for multipole contributions. The previously unknown magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole contributions are determined by the bulk media but appear in all experimental SFG spectra, obscuring the connection between measured spectra and interfacial structure. We present the simulation-based framework that predicts the full set of multipole contributions to the SFG spectrum. This framework also yields depth-resolved spectra, enabling the precise localization of spectroscopic features. Applied to the air-water interface, our approach achieves quantitative agreement with experimental spectra for different polarization combinations in both the bending and stretching regions. Multipole contributions are crucial for correctly interpreting SFG spectra: in the bending band, the electric dipole contribution is of an intensity similar to the magnetic dipole contribution, and both are dominated by the electric quadrupole contribution. In the OH-stretch region, the electric quadrupole contribution is found to be responsible for the mysterious shoulder at 3600 cm$^{-1}$. Crucially, subtracting the multipole contributions isolates the second-order electric dipole susceptibility, which is a quantitative probe for interfacial orientational anisotropy. This electric-dipole susceptibility reveals a pronounced biaxial ordering of water at the air-water interface. By resolving a fundamental limitation of the interpretation of SFG spectroscopy, our framework allows for the detailed extraction of interfacial water ordering from SFG spectra.

Title: Design Rules for Optimizing Quaternary Mixed-Metal Chalcohalides
Authors: Pascal Henkel, Jingrui Li, Patrick Rinke
Abstract: Quaternary mixed-metal M(II)2M(III)Ch2X3 chalcohalides are an emerging material class for photovoltaic absorbers that combines the beneficial optoelectronic properties of lead-based halide perovskites with the stability of metal chalcogenides. Inspired by the recent discovery of lead-free mixed-metal chalcohalides materials, we utilized a combination of density functional theory and machine learning to determine compositional trends and chemical design rules in the lead-free and lead-based materials spaces. We explored a total of 54 M(II)2M(III)Ch2X3 materials with M(II) = Sn, Pb, M(III) = In, Sb, Bi, Ch = S, Se, Te, and X = Cl, Br, I per phase (Cmcm, Cmc21 , and P21/c). The P21/c phase is the equilibrium phase at low temperatures, followed by Cmc21 and Cmcm. The fundamental band gaps in Cmcm and Cmc21 are smaller than those in P21/c, but direct band gaps are more common in Cmcm and Cmc21. The effective electron masses in P21/c are significantly larger compared to Cmcm and Cmc21, while the effective hole masses are nearly the same across all three phases. Using random forest regression, we found that the two electron acceptor sites (Ch and X) are crucial in shaping the properties of mixed-metal chalcohalide compounds. Furthermore, the electron donor sites (M(II) and M(III)) can be used to finetune the material properties to desired applications. These design rules enable precise tailoring of mixed-metal chalcohalide compounds for a variety of applications.

Title: Laser-dressed partial density of states
Authors: Tatiana Bezriadina, Daria Popova-Gorelova
Abstract: The manipulation of material properties by laser light holds great promise for the development of future technologies. However, the full picture of the electronic response to laser driving remains to be uncovered. We present a novel approach to reveal details of the electron dynamics of laser-dressed materials, which consists of calculating and analysing the time-dependent partial density of states (PDOS) of materials during their interaction with a driving electromagnetic field. We show that the laser-dressed PDOS provides information about the structure of the bonds that form the laser-dressed electron density, analogous to the information that a PDOS can provide about the electron structure in a field-free case. We illustrate how our method can provide insights into the electron dynamics of materials in a site- and orbital-selective manner with calculations for a laser-dressed wurtzite ZnO crystal. Our work provides an analytical tool for the interpretation of subcycle-resolved experiments on laser-dressed materials and for the development of strategies for optical manipulation of material properties.

Title: Yielding and memory in a driven mean-field model of glasses
Authors: Makoto Suda, Edan Lerner, Eran Bouchbinder
Abstract: Glassy systems reveal a wide variety of generic behaviors inherited from their intrinsically-disordered, non-equilibrium nature. These include universal non-phononic vibrational spectra, and driven phenomena such as thermal and mechanical annealing, yielding transitions and memory formation, all linked to the underlying complex energy landscape of glasses. Yet, a unified theory of such diverse glassy phenomena is currently lacking. Here, we study a recently introduced mean-field model of glasses, shown to reproduce the universal non-phononic vibrational spectra of glasses, under oscillatory driving forces. We show that the driven mean-field model, admitting a Hamiltonian formulation in terms of a collection of random-stiffness anharmonic oscillators with disordered interactions, naturally predicts the salient dynamical phenomena in cyclically deformed glasses. Specifically, it features a yielding transition as a function of the amplitude of the oscillatory driving force, characterized by an absorbing-to-diffusive transition in the system's microscopic trajectories and large-scale hysteresis. The model also reveals dynamic slowing-down from both sides of the transition, as well as mechanical and thermal annealing effects that mirror their glass counterparts. We demonstrate a non-equilibrium ensemble equivalence between the driven post-yielding dynamics at fixed quenched disorder and quenched disorder averages of the non-driven system. Finally, mechanical memory formation is demonstrated, in which memories can be stored in the model and subsequently extracted. Overall, the mean-field model offers a theoretical framework that unifies a broad range of glassy behaviors.

Title: Diffusion with stochastic resetting on a lattice
Authors: Alexander K. Hartmann, Satya N. Majumdar
Abstract: We provide an exact formula for the mean first-passage time (MFPT) to a target at the origin for a single particle diffusing on a $d$-dimensional hypercubic {\em lattice} starting from a fixed initial position $\vec R_0$ and resetting to $\vec R_0$ with a rate $r$. Previously known results in the continuous space are recovered in the scaling limit $r\to 0$, $R_0=|\vec R_0|\to \infty$ with the product $\sqrt{r}\, R_0$ fixed. However, our formula is valid for any $r$ and any $\vec R_0$ that enables us to explore a much wider region of the parameter space that are inaccessible in the continuum limit. For example, we have shown that the MFPT, as a function of $r$ for fixed $\vec R_0$, diverges in the two opposite limits $r\to 0$ and $r\to \infty$ with a unique minimum in between, provided the starting point is not a nearest neighbour of the target. In this case, the MFPT diverges as a power law $\sim r^{\phi}$ as $r\to \infty$, but very interestingly with an exponent $\phi= (|m_1|+|m_2|+\ldots +|m_d|)-1$ that depends on the starting point $\vec R_0= a\, (m_1,m_2,\ldots, m_d)$ where $a$ is the lattice spacing and $m_i$'s are integers. If, on the other hand, the starting point happens to be a nearest neighbour of the target, then the MFPT decreases monotonically with increasing $r$, approaching a universal limiting value $1$ as $r\to \infty$, indicating that the optimal resetting rate in this case is infinity. We provide a simple physical reason and a simple Markov-chain explanation behind this somewhat unexpected universal result. Our analytical predictions are verified in numerical simulations on lattices up to $50$ dimensions. Finally, in the absence of a target, we also compute exactly the position distribution of the walker in the nonequlibrium stationary state that also displays interesting lattice effects not captured by the continuum theory.

Title: Disentangling hierarchical relaxations in glass formers via dynamic eigenmodes
Authors: Wensi Sun, Yanshuang Chen, Wencheng Ji, Yi Zhou, Hua Tong, Ke Chen, Xiaosong Chen, Hajime Tanaka, Peng Tan
Abstract: Hierarchical dynamics in glass-forming systems span multiple timescales, from fast vibrations to slow structural rearrangements, appearing in both supercooled fluids and glassy states. Understanding how these diverse processes interact across timescales remains a central challenge. Here, by combining direct particle-level observations with a dynamic eigenmode approach that decomposes intermediate-timescale responses into distinct modes, we reveal the microscopic organisation of relaxation dynamics in two-dimensional colloidal systems. We identify five classes of modes characterizing hierarchical dynamics: (i) quasi-elastic modes, (ii) slow-reversible string modes contributing to dynamic heterogeneity, (iii) slow-irreversible string modes leading to flow, (iv) fast-$\beta$ modes with fast-reversible strings, and (v) random noise modes. The emergence of quasi-elastic modes marks the onset of glassy dynamics, while reversible string modes dominate dynamic heterogeneity throughout both supercooled and glassy regimes. Our findings offer a unified microscopic framework for understanding how distinct relaxation processes interconnect across timescales, illuminating the mechanisms driving glass formation.

Title: Nonlinear Transport in Carbon Quantum Dot Electronic Devices: Experiment and Theory
Authors: Scott Copeland, Sungguen Ryu, Kazunari Imai, Nicholas Krasco, Zhixiang Lu, David Sanchez, Paul Czubarow
Abstract: Carbon quantum dots (CQDs) are a promising material for electronic applications due to their easy fabrication and interesting semiconductor properties. Further, CQDs exhibit quantum confinement and charging effects, which may lead not only to improved performances but also to devices with novel functionalities. Here, we investigate the electronic transport of CQDs embedded on epoxy polymer. Our samples are coupled to interdigitated electrodes with individually addressable microelectrodes. Remarkably, the current-voltage characteristics show strongly nonlinear regimes at room temperature, ranging from Schottky diode to Coulomb blockade and even negative differential conductance behavior. We propose a master equation theoretical framework which allows us to compute current curves that agree well with the observations. This model emphasizes the importance of interacting dots and electron traps in generating a cohesive picture that encompasses all transport regimes. Overall, our results suggest that CQDs constitute a versatile materials platform for 3D integrated electronic purposes.

Title: Investigation of local surrounding of Mn atoms in Ni-Mn-Ga Heusler alloy using nuclear magnetic resonance
Authors: Vojtěch Chlan, Martin Adamec, Oleg Heczko
Abstract: The local environment of Mn atoms in stoichiometric and off-stoichiometric (with Mn excess) Ni-Mn-Ga Heusler alloys was investigated using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and interpreted with the help of Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods. In cubic austenite, the significant amount of structural defects was observed in $^{55}$Mn NMR experiments and interpreted using DFT calculations as individual antisite defects or defects accompanying anti-phase boundaries. The spectrum of non-modulated martensite was similar to that of austenite, albeit with increasing disorder due to excess Mn. In 10M modulated martensite, the main lines were split. The splitting is ascribed to structural modulation and quantitative analysis shows that the amplitude of modulation evolves with temperature and its magnitude is in agreement with diffraction data.

Title: Analysis of real-space transport channels for electrons and holes in halide perovskites
Authors: Frederik Vonhoff, Maximilian J. Schilcher, David R. Reichman, David A. Egger
Abstract: Predicting and explaining charge carrier transport in halide perovskites is a formidable challenge because of the unusual vibrational and electron-phonon coupling properties of these materials. This study explores charge carrier transport in two prototypical halide perovskite materials, MAPbBr$_3$ and MAPbI$_3$, using a dynamic disorder model. Focusing on the role of real-space transport channels, we analyze temporal orbital occupations to assess the impact of material-specific on-site energy levels and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) strengths. Our findings reveal that both on-site energies and SOC magnitude significantly influence the orbital occupation dynamics, thereby affecting charge dispersal and carrier mobility. In particular, energy gaps across on-site levels and the halide SOC strength govern the filling of transport channels over time. This leads us to identify the $pp\pi$ channel as a critical bottleneck for charge transport and to provide insights into the differences between electron and hole transport across the two materials.

Title: Capillary wave formation in conserved active emulsions
Authors: Florian Raßhofer, Simon Bauer, Alexander Ziepke, Ivan Maryshev, Erwin Frey
Abstract: The dynamics of phase-separated interfaces shape the behavior of both passive and active condensates. While surface tension in equilibrium systems minimizes interface length, non-equilibrium fluxes can destabilize flat or constantly curved interfaces, giving rise to complex interface morphologies. Starting from a minimal model that couples a conserved, phase-separating species to a self-generated chemical field, we identify the conditions under which interfacial instabilities may emerge. Specifically, we show that non-reciprocal chemotactic interactions induce two distinct types of instabilities: a stationary (non-oscillatory) instability that promotes interface deformations, and an oscillatory instability that can give rise to persistent capillary waves propagating along the boundaries of phase-separated domains. To characterize these phenomena, we develop a perturbative framework that predicts the onset, wavelength, and velocity of capillary waves, and quantitatively validate these predictions through numerical simulations. Beyond the linear regime, our simulations reveal that capillary waves undergo a secondary instability, leading to either stationary or dynamically evolving superpositions of different wave modes. Finally, we investigate whether capillary waves can facilitate directed mass transport, either along phase boundaries (conveyor belts) or through self-sustained liquid gears crawling along a solid wall. Taken together, our results establish a general framework for interfacial dynamics in active phase-separating systems and suggest new strategies for controlling mass transport in soft matter and biological condensates.

Title: Crystallographic control of hydrogen ingress in bcc-Iron: Insights from ab initio simulations
Authors: Lukas Meier, Asif I. Bhatti, Leo Kestens, Stefaan Cottenier
Abstract: Hydrogen uptake into body-centered cubic (bcc) iron as a root cause for subsequent hydrogen embrittlement, is initiated at the surface. In this paper, we quantify how readily H diffuses from the surface into the bulk. We consider a set of low-index, vicinal and general Fe surfaces and treat H-permeation as a two-step process. First, density-functional calculations determine the adsorption energy of an isolated H atom at every crystallographically distinct surface site. Second, for each adsorption site we map the minimum-energy pathway that carries the atom beneath the surface and into the lattice. Across all ten orientations studied, a clear trend emerges: sites that bind hydrogen most weakly (highest adsorption energy) are the starting point of the lowest-barrier diffusion channels into the metal interior. Thus, the least-favorable adsorption pockets act as gateways for efficient subsurface penetration. These insights provide a practical design rule: suppressing or minimizing exposure of such high-energy adsorption motifs - through appropriate surface texturing or orientation control - should make bcc-iron components less susceptible to hydrogen uptake and the associated embrittlement.

Title: Impact of anharmonicity on the carrier mobility of the Pb-free CsSnBr$_3$ perovskite
Authors: Junwen Yin, Olle Hellman, Samuel Poncé
Abstract: Charge carrier mobilities are critical parameters in halide perovskite solar cells, governing their average carrier velocity under an applied electric field and overall efficiency. Recent advances in first-principles calculations of electron-phonon interactions and carrier mobilities have enabled predictive computations for perovskite solar cells. However, the flexible octahedral frameworks and cationic displacements in these materials challenge the harmonic approximation, leading to significant difficulties in accurately calculating transport properties. To address these issues, we combine temperature-dependent effective potentials with the ab initio Boltzmann transport equations to compute carrier mobilities in a representative lead-free perovskite, CsSnBr$_3$. At room temperature, the electron/hole Hall mobilities in CsSnBr$_3$ are 106/256 cm$^2$/Vs when neglecting anharmonic effects and 59/145 cm$^2$/Vs when included. This overestimation of the harmonic approximation arises from the neglect of scattering coming from soft modes. We provide a workflow for performing first-principles carrier mobility calculations in anharmonic systems, advancing the predictive modeling of perovskite solar cells.

Title: The finite-difference parquet method: Enhanced electron-paramagnon scattering opens a pseudogap
Authors: Jae-Mo Lihm, Dominik Kiese, Seung-Sup B. Lee, Fabian B. Kugler
Abstract: We present the finite-difference parquet method that greatly improves the applicability and accuracy of two-particle correlation approaches to interacting electron systems. This method incorporates the nonperturbative local physics from a reference solution and builds all parquet diagrams while circumventing potentially divergent irreducible vertices. Its unbiased treatment of different fluctuations is crucial for reproducing the strong-coupling pseudogap in the underdoped Hubbard model, consistent with diagrammatic Monte Carlo calculations. We reveal a strong-coupling spin-fluctuation mechanism of the pseudogap with decisive vertex corrections that encode the cooperation of direct- and exchange-type scattering between electrons and antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations.

Title: Integrability of the Kondo model with time dependent interaction strength
Authors: Parameshwar R. Pasnoori
Abstract: In this letter we consider the time dependent Kondo model where a magnetic impurity interacts with the electrons through a time dependent interaction strength $J(t)$. Using the Bethe ansatz framework, an exact solution to the time dependent Schrodinger equation is constructed. We show that when periodic boundary conditions are applied, the consistency of the solution results in a constraint equation which relates the amplitudes corresponding to a certain ordering of the particles in the configuration space. This constraint equation takes the form of a matrix difference equation, and the associated consistency conditions restrict the interaction strength $J(t)$ for the system to be integrable. For a given $J(t)$ satisfying these constraints, the solution to the matrix difference equations provides the exact many-body wavefunction that satisfies the time-dependent Schrodinger equation. The framework developed in this work is general and provides a method to solve new class of Hamiltonians with time-dependent interaction strength which are based on quantum Yang-Baxter algebra.

Title: Auger parameter analysis for TiN and AlN thin films via combined in-situ XPS and HAXPES
Authors: O.V. Pshyk. J. Patidar, C. Cancellieri, S. Siol
Abstract: Auger parameter analysis provides in-depth information about the electronic and chemical bonding properties of TiN and AlN thin films, which are relevant across a wide range of technologies. Meaningful interpretation and analysis of the Auger parameter of these materials have been hindered due to, among other reasons, the absence of reliable references. Here we present a comprehensive study of Auger parameters for TiN and AlN thin films using a dual-source lab-based XPS/HAXPES system equipped with Al Ka and Cr Ka x-ray sources. Due to a large spread of excitation x-ray energy, bulk- and surface-sensitive core-level photoelectrons and Auger transitions are probed. This allows us to study a wide range of Auger and core-level emission lines of TiN and AlN. These measurements can serve as references for further identification of chemical state changes, oxidation state or any deviations in the local chemical environment in these materials. UHV sample transfer was employed to minimise surface contamination. Additionally, we demonstrate how common procedures such as ambient air exposure and Ar+ sputter-etching influence the Auger parameters, highlighting the importance of surface preparation in spectroscopic analysis.

Title: Many-body localization in a quantum Ising model with the long-range interaction: Accurate determination of the transition point
Authors: Illia Lukin, Andrii Sotnikov, Alexander L. Burin
Abstract: Many-body localization (MBL) transition emerges at strong disorder in interacting systems, separating chaotic and reversible dynamics. Although the existence of MBL transition within the macroscopic limit in spin chains with a short-range interaction was proved rigorously, the transition point is not found yet because of the dramatic sensitivity of the transition point to the chain length at computationally accessible lengths, possible due to local fluctuations destroying localization. Here we investigate MBL transition in the quantum Ising model (Ising model in a transverse field) with the long-range interaction suppressing the fluctuations similarly to that for the second-order phase transitions. We estimate the MBL threshold within the logarithmic accuracy using exact results for a somewhat similar localization problem on a Bethe lattice problem and show that our expectations are fully consistent with the estimate of the transition point using exact diagonalization. In spite of unlimited growing of the critical disorder within the thermodynamic limit, this result offers the opportunity to probe the critical behavior of the system near the transition point. Moreover, the model is relevant for the wide variety of physical systems with the long-range dipole-dipole, elastic or indirect exchange interactions.

Title: Structure and Elastic properties of Titanium MXenes: evaluation of COMB3, REAXFF and MEAM force fields
Authors: Luis F. V. Thomazini, Alexandre F. Fonseca
Abstract: Titanium carbide and nitride MXenes are two-dimensional inorganic materials that exhibit noteworthy physical and chemical properties. These materials are considered for a variety of technological applications, ranging from energy harvesting to optical and biomedical applications. Given the growing interest in titanium MXenes, there is an expanding demand for computational studies to predict physical properties and behaviors under diverse physical conditions. Complex and large-scale systems necessitate computational methodologies that surpass the constraints imposed by ab initio calculations. In this regard, it is imperative to ascertain the reliability of the computational tools employed to simulate and predict the physical properties of titanium MXenes. In this study, the ability of three known classical molecular dynamics (MD) potentials to provide the structural and elastic properties of titanium carbide and nitride MXenes is evaluated. The MD potentials that were the focus of this study include the Charge-Optimized Many-Body (COMB3), the Reactive Force Field (REAXFF) and the Modified Embedded Atom Method (MEAM). These three potentials possess two or more sets of parameters, herein referred to as force fields, capable of simulating Ti-C and Ti-N systems. The MD results for the lattice parameter and thickness of the MXenes are then compared to those from DFT calculations found in the literature. A total of ten force fields were considered; of these, two REAXFF and two MEAM ones were identified as the most adequate to simulate both the structure and elastic properties of titanium MXenes. Additionally, the values for the linear compressibility of MXenes are presented for the first time. Consequently, researchers can utilize the obtained results to design novel MD-based computational studies of titanium MXenes, leveraging the established relative validity of the available force fields.

Title: Mechanism of defect formation in the quantum annealing of random transverse-field Ising chain
Authors: Róbert Juhász
Abstract: Based on the strong-disorder renormalization group method, a microscopic mechanism of defect formation in the quantum annealing of the random transverse-field Ising chain is proposed, which represents the annealing process as a gradual aggregation of strongly coupled spin clusters. The ferromagnetic ground states of clusters are either preserved or get excited in pairwise fusions of clusters, depending on the effective annealing rate of the fusion, the latter events being responsible for the appearance of defects in the final state. An interesting consequence of the theory is that, although the Griffiths-McCoy phases surrounding the critical point are gapless, these phases are still effectively gapped from the point of view of quantum annealing. Thereby we provide an a posteriori justification of the assumption on the finiteness of gap outside of the critical point tacitly used in earlier works, and also refine the functional form of its vanishing at the critical point. The defect density in the final state is found to decrease with the annealing time $\tau$ asymptotically as $n(\tau)\sim \ln^{-2}\left(\frac{\tau}{\ln^2\tau}\right)$. In addition to this, our approach gives access also to the time-dependent density of defects accumulated during the annealing process at intermediate times.

Title: Floquet engineering spin triplet states in unconventional magnets
Authors: Pei-Hao Fu, Sayan Mondal, Jun-Feng Liu, Yukio Tanaka, Jorge Cayao
Abstract: We consider unconventional magnets with and without spin-singlet $s$-wave superconductivity and demonstrate the emergence of spin triplet states due to light drives. In particular, we find that a high-frequency linearly polarized light drive induces a spin-triplet density in $d$-wave altermagnets which does not exist in the static regime and can directly reveal the strength of the altermagnetic field. In this high-frequency regime, we also show that linearly polarized light enables the formation of odd-frequency spin-triplet superconducting correlations possessing $d$-wave and $s$-wave parities, which can be controlled by the light drive and accessed by measuring the spin density. Moreover, for low-frequency linearly and circularly polarized light drives, we obtain that the types of superconducting correlations are broadened due to the presence of Floquet bands, enabling spin-triplet pairs in $d$- and $p$-wave unconventional magnets, which are absent in the undriven phase.

Title: Universal non-thermal fixed point for quasi-1D Bose gases
Authors: Qi Liang, RuGway Wu, Pradyumna Paranjape, Ben Schittenkopf, Chen Li, Jörg Schmiedmayer, Sebastian Erne
Abstract: Spatio-temporal scaling dynamics connected to non-thermal fixed points has been suggested as a universal framework to describe the relaxation of isolated far-from-equilibrium systems. Experimental studies in weakly-interacting cold atom systems have found scaling dynamics connected to specific attractors. In our experiments, we study a quantum gas of strongly interacting $^6$Li$_2$ Feshbach molecules, brought far out of equilibrium by imprinting a white-noise phase profile. The observed relaxation follows the same universal dynamics as for the previously observed formation of the order parameter in a shock-cooled gas of weakly interacting $^{87}$Rb atoms. Our results point to a single universal fixed point with a large basin of attraction governing the relaxation of quasi-1D bosonic systems, independent of their specific initial conditions and microscopic details.

Title: Biaxial characterization of soft elastomers: experiments and data-adaptive configurational forces for fracture
Authors: Miguel Angel Moreno-Mateos, Simon Wiesheier, Ali Esmaeili, Mokarram Hossain, Paul Steinmann
Abstract: Understanding the fracture mechanics of soft solids remains a fundamental challenge due to their complex, nonlinear responses under large deformations. While multiaxial loading is key to probing their mechanical behavior, the role of such loading in fracture processes is still poorly understood. Here, we present a combined experimental-computational framework to investigate fracture in soft elastomers under equi-biaxial loading. We report original equi-biaxial quasi-static experiments on five elastomeric materials, revealing a spectrum of material and fracture behavior, from brittle-like to highly deformable response with crack tip strains exceeding 150 %. Motivated by these observations, we develop a hybrid computational testbed that mirrors the experimental setup and enables virtual biaxial tests. Central to this framework are two components: a data-adaptive formulation of hyperelastic energy functions that flexibly captures material behavior, and a post-processing implementation of the Configurational Force Method, providing a computationally efficient estimate of the J-integral at the crack tip. Our data-adaptive framework for hyperelastic energy functions proves versatility to capture with high accuracy the hyperelastic behavior observed in the biaxial experiments. This is important because accurately capturing the constitutive behaviour of soft solids is key for a reliable application of the Configurational Force Method to soft solids. In the limit of crack onset, a critical value of the crack tip configurational force allows for a criterion of fracture toughness. Together, our experimental, theoretical, and computational contributions offer a new paradigm for characterizing and designing soft materials with tailored fracture properties.

Title: Dynamics of Clusters of Anyons in Fractional Quantum Hall Fluids
Authors: Qianhui Xu, Guangyue Ji, Yuzhu Wang, Ha Quang Trung, Bo Yang
Abstract: We investigates the effective interactions between anyons emerging from either model or realistic bare electron-electron (e-e) interactions in Laughlin and Moore-Read fractional quantum Hall (FQH) fluids. Instead of being purely repulsive or attractive, such anyons display rich dynamics with interesting experimental consequences. Two Laughlin anyons prefer to form bound states with short-range e-e interactions, leading to $2e/3$ bunched quasiholes at low temperatures instead of the $e/3$ quasiholes. In non-Abelian Moore-Read FQH phases, two $e/4$ quasiholes can fuse into topologically distinct ''1'' or ''$\psi$'' anyons that are no longer degenerate with realistic two-body e-e interactions. This suggests the possibility to energetically separate and manipulate the two types of anyons by tuning the bare electron-electron interactions. We propose that the recently developed high-resolution STM measurements can be used to probe effective anyon interactions when anyons are clustered together after the tunneling of electrons. The local density of states from various bound states of anyon clusters are simulated for both Abelian and non-Abelian systems with (screened) Coulomb interactions.

Title: Degradation of methylparaben by anodic oxidation, electro-Fenton, and photoelectro-Fenton using carbon felt-BDD cell
Authors: Aline B. Trench, Nihal Oturan, Aydeniz Demir, João P. C. Moura, Clément Trellu, Mauro C. Santos, Mehmet A. Oturan
Abstract: In this study, the comparative efficiency of different electrochemical advanced oxidation processes, such as anodic oxidation with electrogenerated H2O2 (AO- H2O2), electro-Fenton (EF), and its combination with UV irradiation (photoelectron-Fenton (PEF)), was investigated for the removal of methylparaben (MP) using a carbon felt cathode and a boron-doped diamond anode. The EF process achieved a higher MP removal efficiency than the AO-H2O2 process for all applied current densities. The total organic carbon (TOC) removal after 6 h of treatment at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 reached 75.0% and 91.9% for the AO- H2O2 and EF processes, respectively. The combination of EF and UV light improved the efficiency of the EF process. The PEF process achieved a TOC removal of 84.6% in only 2 h at 5 mA cm-2 and 96.8% after 6 h of treatment. Furthermore, based on identifying oxidation reaction intermediates and short-chain carboxylic acids generated during the treatment, a reaction pathway for methylparaben mineralization by hydroxyl radicals was proposed.

Title: Time Independence Does Not Limit Information Flow. I. The Free-Particle Case
Authors: Dong Yuan, Chao Yin, T. C. Mooney, Christopher L. Baldwin, Andrew M. Childs, Alexey V. Gorshkov
Abstract: The speed of information propagation in long-range interacting quantum systems is limited by Lieb-Robinson-type bounds, whose tightness can be established by finding specific quantum state-transfer protocols. Previous works have given quantum state-transfer protocols that saturate the corresponding Lieb-Robinson bounds using time-dependent Hamiltonians. Are speed limits for quantum information propagation different for time-independent Hamiltonians? In a step towards addressing this question, we present and analyze two optimal time-independent state-transfer protocols for free-particle systems, which utilize continuous-time single-particle quantum walks with hopping strength decaying as a power law. We rigorously prove and numerically confirm that our protocols achieve quantum state transfer, with controllable error over an arbitrarily long distance in any spatial dimension, at the speed limits set by the free-particle Lieb-Robinson bounds. This shows that time independence does not limit information flow for long-range free-particle Hamiltonians.

Title: Evidence of Memory Effects in the Dynamics of Two-Level System Defect Ensembles Using Broadband, Cryogenic Transient Dielectric Spectroscopy
Authors: Qianxu Wang, Sara Magdalena Gómez, Juan S. Salcedo-Gallo, Roy Leibovitz, Jake Freeman, Salil Bedkihal, Mattias Fitzpatrick
Abstract: Two-level system defects (TLSs) in dielectrics are believed to be the primary source of decoherence in superconducting circuits. However, the precise origin of these defects, including their atomistic morphology, frequency distributions, and dipole moments, remains relatively unexplored. A significant reason for this lack of understanding is that TLS defects are currently probed with resonators or qubits that require complex multi-stage fabrication processes. These probes are packaged, cooled in a dilution refrigerator, and measured to infer their corresponding coherence times. However, even frequency-tunable probes only gather information about TLS defects within their mode volume and a narrow bandwidth around their resonance frequency. As a result, a detailed understanding of the atomistic origins of TLS defects in isolated materials and interfaces is currently lacking, making it challenging to design the next generation of superconducting devices and dielectric materials from first principles. Here, we introduce a novel approach that enables probing the cryogenic dielectric response of TLS defect ensembles using a broadband 3D waveguide. This technique provides evidence of memory effects in the dynamics of TLS defect ensembles that may enable the extraction of critical information about the origins of the underlying TLS defects and their interactions. Importantly, this novel spectroscopy technique can be used at all stages of fabrication and ultimately inform mitigation strategies to reduce the impact of TLS defects on superconducting circuits. As a result, this technique will help usher in a new understanding of the atomistic origin of TLS defects, which will have profound consequences for quantum information science and the broader materials science community.

Title: Non-Clifford gates between stabilizer codes via non-Abelian topological order
Authors: Rohith Sajith, Zijian Song, Brenden Roberts, Varun Menon, Yabo Li
Abstract: We propose protocols to implement non-Clifford logical gates between stabilizer codes by entangling into a non-Abelian topological order as an intermediate step. Generalizing previous approaches, we provide a framework that generates a large class of non-Clifford and non-diagonal logical gates between qudit surface codes by gauging the topological symmetry of symmetry-enriched topological orders. As our main example, we concretely detail a protocol that utilizes the quantum double of $S_3$ to generate a controlled-charge conjugation ($C\mathcal{C}$) gate between a qubit and qutrit surface code. Both the preparation of non-Abelian states and logical state injection between the Abelian and non-Abelian codes are executed via finite-depth quantum circuits with measurement and feedforward. We discuss aspects of the fault-tolerance of our protocol, presenting insights on how to construct a heralded decoder for the quantum double of $S_3.$ We also outline how analogous protocols can be used to obtain logical gates between qudit surface codes by entangling into $\mathcal{D}(G),$ where $G$ is a semidirect product of Abelian groups. This work serves as a step towards classifying the computational power of non-Abelian quantum phases beyond the paradigm of anyon braiding on near-term quantum devices.

Title: Thermal Conductivity above 2000 W/m.K in Boron Arsenide by Nanosecond Transducer-less Time-Domain Thermoreflectance
Authors: Hong Zhong, Ying Peng, Feng Lin, Ange Benise Niyikiza, Fengjiao Pan, Chengzhen Qin, Jinghong Chen, Viktor G. Hadjiev, Liangzi Deng, Zhifeng Ren, Jiming Bao
Abstract: Cubic boron arsenide (c-BAs) has been theoretically predicted to exhibit thermal conductivity \k{appa} comparable to that of diamond, yet experimental measurements have plateaued at ~1300W/mK. We report room-temperature \k{appa} exceeding 2000W/mK in c-BAs, on par with single-crystal diamond. This finding is enabled by high-quality single crystals and a newly developed nanosecond, transducer-less time-domain thermoreflectance technique that allows spatial mapping of \k{appa} without metal transducers. Thermal conductivity correlates with crystal quality, as evidenced by stronger photoluminescence and longer photoluminescence lifetimes. However, the observed nanosecond lifetimes remain shorter than expected for an indirect bandgap semiconductor, suggesting room for further crystal quality improvement and higher \k{appa}. These results challenge current theoretical models and highlight c-BAs as a promising material for next-generation electronics.

Title: Improving variational counterdiabatic driving with weighted actions and computer algebra
Authors: Naruo Ohga, Takuya Hatomura
Abstract: Variational counterdiabatic (CD) driving is a disciplined and widely used method to robustly control quantum many-body systems by mimicking adiabatic processes with high fidelity and reduced duration. Central to this technique is a universal structure of the adiabatic gauge potential (AGP) over a parameterized Hamiltonian. Here, we reveal that introducing a new degree of freedom into the theory of the AGP can significantly improve variational CD driving. Specifically, we find that the algebraic characterization of the AGP is not unique, and we exploit this non-uniqueness to develop the weighted variational method for deriving a refined driving protocol. This approach extends the conventional method in two aspects: it effectively incorporates nonlocal information, and it assigns customized weights to matrix elements relevant to specific problems. We also develop an efficient numerical algorithm to compute the refined driving protocol using computer algebra. Our framework is broadly applicable, as it can replace almost all previous uses of variational CD driving. We demonstrate its practicality by applying it to adiabatic evolution along the ground state of a parameterized Hamiltonian. This proposal outperforms the conventional method in terms of fidelity, as confirmed by extensive numerical simulations on quantum Ising models.

Abstract: The Institute for Solid State Physics (ISSP) at The University of Tokyo has been carrying out a software development project named ``the Project for Advancement of Software Usability in Materials Science (PASUMS)". Since the launch of PASUMS, various open-source software programs have been developed/advanced, including ab initio calculations, effective model solvers, and software for machine learning. We also focus on activities that make the software easier to use, such as developing comprehensive computing tools that enable efficient use of supercomputers and interoperability between different software programs. We hope to contribute broadly to developing the computational materials science community through these activities.

Title: State Engineering of Unsteerable Hamiltonians
Authors: Yi-Xuan Wang, Yuval Gefen
Abstract: Lindbladian dynamics of open systems may be employed to steer a many-body system towards a non-trivial ground state of a local Hamiltonian. Such protocols provide us with tunable platforms facilitating the engineering and study of non-trivial many-body states. Steering towards a degenerate ground state manifold provides us with a protected platform to employ many-body states as a resource for quantum information processing. Notably, ground states of frustrated local Hamiltonians have been known not to be amenable to steering protocols. Revisiting this intricate physics we report two new results: (i) we find a broad class of (geometrically) frustrated local Hamiltonians for which steering of the ground state manifold is possible through a sequence of discrete steering steps. Following the steering dynamics, states within the degenerate ground-state manifold keep evolving in a non-stationary manner. (ii) For the class of Hamiltonians with ground states which are non-steerable through local superoperators, we derive a "glass floor" on how close to the ground state one can get implementing a steering protocol. This is expressed invoking the concept of cooling-by-steering (a lower bound of the achievable temperature), or through an upper bound of the achievable fidelity. Our work provides a systematic outline for studying quantum state manipulation of a broad class of strongly correlated states.

Title: Photon emission gain in Er doped Si light emitting diodes by impact excitation
Authors: Huayou Liu, Jiayuan Zhao, Jing Zhang, Huan Liu, Jiajing He, Ulrich Kentsch, Shengqiang Zhou, Manfred Helm, Yaping Dan
Abstract: This work demonstrates photon emission gain, i.e., emission of multiple photons per injected electron, through impact excitation in Er-doped silicon light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Conventional methods for exciting Er ions in silicon suffer from low efficiency due to mismatched energy transfer between exciton recombination and Er excitation. Here, we propose a reverse-biased Si PN junction diode where ballistically accelerated electrons induce inelastic collisions with Er ions, enabling tunable excitation via electric field modulation. Theoretical modeling reveals that photon emission gain arises from multiple impact excitations by a single electron traversing the electroluminescence region, with the gain value approximating the ratio of emission region width to electron mean free path, i.e., G = Lex/l. Experimental results show an internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of 1.84% at 78 K, representing a 20-fold enhancement over room-temperature performance. This work provides a critical foundation for on-chip integration of silicon-based communication-band lasers and quantum light sources.

Title: Performance report of heuristic algorithm that cracked the largest Gset Ising problems (G81 cut=14060)
Authors: Kenneth M. Zick
Abstract: For the past 25 years, the Gset benchmark problems have challenged all manner of Ising and Max-Cut solvers. The largest of these problems have remained unsolved by any heuristic algorithm. In this report we provide data showing dramatically better speed and accuracy on these large sparse problems. Our newly discovered heuristic algorithm called Cosm reaches high (99.9% of best) solution quality orders of magnitude faster than the previous best heuristic solver results. Additionally, when afforded enough steps Cosm attains higher cuts than ever previously reported, specifically on instances G72 (cut=7008), G77 (cut=9940), and the 20,000-variable G81 (cut=14060). This report includes solution bitstrings so that the cuts can be independently validated. Remarkably, the new best solutions appear to be optimal. We believe the results are an early hint of disruptive opportunities for unconventional, hardware-centric approaches to algorithm discovery.

Title: Disparity between multipartite entangling and disentangling powers of unitaries: Even vs Odd
Authors: Mrinmoy Samanta, Sudipta Mondal, Aditi Sen De
Abstract: We compare the multipartite entangling and disentangling powers of unitary operators by assessing their ability to generate or eliminate genuine multipartite entanglement. Our findings reveal that while diagonal unitary operators can exhibit equal entangling and disentangling powers, certain non-diagonal unitaries demonstrate an imbalance when acting on fully separable states, thereby extending the known disparity from bipartite systems to those with any number of parties. Counterintuitively, we construct classes of unitaries and their adjoints that display unequal entanglement generation capacities, behaving differently when applied to systems with an even number of qubits compared to those with an odd number. Further, we illustrate that this asymmetry can be simulated using physically realizable Hamiltonians: systems with an even number of qubits employ nearest-neighbor Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions, while those with an odd number utilize a combination of Heisenberg and DM interactions. Additionally, we present a circuit composed of random noncommuting unitaries, constructed from alternating layers of two-qubit Haar-random gates, to illustrate the discrepancy in the entangling and disentangling capabilities of unitaries.

Title: On the Emergence of Linear Analogies in Word Embeddings
Authors: Daniel J. Korchinski, Dhruva Karkada, Yasaman Bahri, Matthieu Wyart
Abstract: Models such as Word2Vec and GloVe construct word embeddings based on the co-occurrence probability $P(i,j)$ of words $i$ and $j$ in text corpora. The resulting vectors $W_i$ not only group semantically similar words but also exhibit a striking linear analogy structure -- for example, $W_{\text{king}} - W_{\text{man}} + W_{\text{woman}} \approx W_{\text{queen}}$ -- whose theoretical origin remains unclear. Previous observations indicate that this analogy structure: (i) already emerges in the top eigenvectors of the matrix $M(i,j) = P(i,j)/P(i)P(j)$, (ii) strengthens and then saturates as more eigenvectors of $M (i, j)$, which controls the dimension of the embeddings, are included, (iii) is enhanced when using $\log M(i,j)$ rather than $M(i,j)$, and (iv) persists even when all word pairs involved in a specific analogy relation (e.g., king-queen, man-woman) are removed from the corpus. To explain these phenomena, we introduce a theoretical generative model in which words are defined by binary semantic attributes, and co-occurrence probabilities are derived from attribute-based interactions. This model analytically reproduces the emergence of linear analogy structure and naturally accounts for properties (i)-(iv). It can be viewed as giving fine-grained resolution into the role of each additional embedding dimension. It is robust to various forms of noise and agrees well with co-occurrence statistics measured on Wikipedia and the analogy benchmark introduced by Mikolov et al.

Title: The Gilbert Damping Factor of Heavy Quark Spin Polarization in the Magnetic Field
Authors: Tianyang Li, Anping Huang, Baoyi Chen
Abstract: We employ the linear response theory to calculate the polarization rate of heavy quark spin in the presence of a strong magnetic field and the hot QCD matter, both of which are simultaneously generated in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The hot QCD medium is simplified as a fermionic system consisting of only quarks. The spin of heavy quarks can be polarized as a result of combined contributions from spin-spin interactions between quarks and spin-magnetic field interactions. This spin dynamics is modeled as consisting of a polarization term and a dissipation term, which is described by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation and widely studied in condensed matter physics, analogous to the momentum evolution in the Langevin equation. In this study, we calculate the Gilbert damping factor that characterizes the spin polarization rate of heavy quarks, considering a Coulomb potential between two fermions in the medium. The dependence of the heavy quark spin polarization rate on the strength of the magnetic field, the heavy quark mass, temperature, and baryon chemical potential is studied in detail. This analysis contributes to a better understanding of quark spin dynamics in the hot QCD medium and the magnetic field.

Title: A physics-guided smoothing method for material modeling with digital image correlation (DIC) measurements
Authors: Jihong Wang, Chung-Hao Lee, William Richardson, Yue Yu
Abstract: In this work, we present a novel approach to process the DIC measurements of multiple biaxial stretching protocols. In particular, we develop a optimization-based approach, which calculates the smoothed nodal displacements using a moving least-squares algorithm subject to positive strain constraints. As such, physically consistent displacement and strain fields are obtained. Then, we further deploy a data-driven workflow to heterogeneous material modeling from these physically consistent DIC measurements, by estimating a nonlocal constitutive law together with the material microstructure. To demonstrate the applicability of our approach, we apply it in learning a material model and fiber orientation field from DIC measurements of a porcine tricuspid valve anterior leaflet. Our results demonstrate that the proposed DIC data processing approach can significantly improve the accuracy of modeling biological materials.

Title: Degradation-Aware and Machine Learning-Driven Uncertainty Quantification in Crystal Plasticity Finite Element: Texture-Driven Plasticity in 316L Stainless Steel
Authors: Dinesh Kumar, Eralp Demir, Julio Spadotto, Kazuma Kobayashi, Syed Bahauddin Alam, Brian Connolly, Ed Pickering, Paul Wilcox, David Knowles, Mahmoud Mostafavi
Abstract: The mechanical properties and long-term structural reliability of crystalline materials are strongly influenced by microstructural features such as grain size, morphology, and crystallographic texture. These characteristics not only determine the initial mechanical behavior but also govern the progression of degradation mechanisms, such as strain localization, fatigue damage, and microcrack initiation under service conditions. Variability in these microstructural attributes, introduced during manufacturing or evolving through in-service degradation, leads to uncertainty in material performance. Therefore, understanding and quantifying microstructure-sensitive plastic deformation is critical for assessing degradation risk in high-value mechanical systems. This study presents a first-of-its-kind machine learning-driven framework that couples high-fidelity crystal plasticity finite element (CPFE) simulations with data-driven surrogate modeling to accelerate degradation-aware uncertainty quantification in welded structural alloys. Specifically, the impact of crystallographic texture variability in 316L stainless steel weldments, characterized via high-throughput electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), is examined through CPFE simulations on calibrated representative volume elements (RVEs). A polynomial chaos expansion-based surrogate model is then trained to efficiently emulate the CPFE response using only 200 simulations, reducing computational cost by several orders of magnitude compared to conventional Monte Carlo analysis. The surrogate enables rapid quantification of uncertainty in stress-strain behavior and identifies texture components such as Cube and Goss as key drivers of degradation-relevant plastic response.

Title: The universality class of the first levels in low-dimensional gravity
Authors: Alexander Altland, Jeremy van der Heijden, Tobias Micklitz, Moshe Rozali, Joaquim Telles de Miranda
Abstract: We investigate the physics of a small group of quantum states defined above the sharply defined ground state of a chaotic ensemble. This `universality class of the first levels' (UFL) is realized in the majority of `synthetic' random matrix models but, for all we know, in only one microscopically defined system: low-dimensional gravity. We discuss the physical properties of these states, notably their exceptional rigidity against external perturbations, as quantified by the so-called quantum state fidelity. Examining these structures through the lenses of random matrix and string theory, we highlight their relevance to the physics of low-dimensional holographic principles.

Title: An Ultra-Low Power and Fast Ising Machine using Voltage-Controlled Magnetoresistive Random Access Memory
Authors: Yihao Zhang, Sai Li, Albert Lee, Zheng Zhu, Lang Zeng, Peng Wang, Lei Gao, Di Wu, Weisheng Zhao
Abstract: Physics-inspired computing paradigms, such as Ising machines, are emerging as promising hardware alternatives to traditional von Neumann architectures for tackling computationally intensive combinatorial optimization problems (COPs). While quantum, optical, and electronic devices have garnered significant attention for their potential in realizing Ising machines, their translation into practical systems for industry-relevant applications remains challenging, with each approach facing specific limitations in power consumption and speed. To address this challenge, we report the first chip-level spintronic Ising machine using voltage-controlled magnetoresistive random access memory. The core of our design leverages magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) driven by the voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy effect to realize the probabilistic update of Ising spins through a new mechanism. It enables a latency below 1 ns and an energy consumption under 40 fJ per spin update, achieving a 1000-times improvement over previous current-driven MTJ-based implementations. We map two real-world COPs in electronic design automation-global routing and layer assignment-onto the Ising model and demonstrate high-quality results with an energy efficiency of 25000 solutions per second per watt. This outperforms state-of-the-art quantum and graphics processing units by six and seven orders of magnitude, respectively. These results establish voltage-controlled spintronics as a compelling route towards next-generation physics-inspired machine intelligence, offering a paradigm for ultra-low-power, high-speed, and scalable computation.

Title: Running a six-qubit quantum circuit on a silicon spin qubit array
Authors: I. Fernández de Fuentes, E. Raymenants, B. Undseth, O. Pietx-Casas, S. Philips M. Mądzik, S. L. de Snoo, S. V. Amitonov, L. Tryputen, A. T. Schmitz, A. Y. Matsuura, G. Scappucci, L. M. K. Vandersypen
Abstract: The simplicity of encoding a qubit in the state of a single electron spin and the potential for their integration into industry-standard microchips continue to drive the field of semiconductor-based quantum computing. However, after decades of progress, validating universal logic in these platforms has advanced little beyond first-principles demonstrations of meeting the DiVincenzo criteria. Case in point, and specifically for silicon-based quantum dots, three-qubit algorithms have been the upper limit to date, despite the availability of devices containing more qubits. In this work, we fully exploit the capacity of a spin-qubit array and implement a six qubit quantum circuit, the largest utilizing semiconductor quantum technology. By programming the quantum processor, we execute quantum circuits across all permutations of three, four, five, and six neighbouring qubits, demonstrating successful programmable multi-qubit operation throughout the array. The results reveal that, despite the high quality of individual units, errors quickly accumulate when combining all of them in a quantum circuit. This work highlights the necessity to minimize idling times through simultaneous operations, boost dephasing times, and consistently improve state preparation and measurement fidelities.

Title: Fractional Nonlinear Schrodinger Equation Revisited
Authors: Morteza Nattagh Najafi, Fatemeh Foroughirad
Abstract: We investigate the space time fractional nonlinear Schrodinger equation (FNLSE) incorporating the modified Riemann Liouville derivative introduced by Jumari. The equation is characterized by two parameters: the fractional derivative parameter (alpha, which captures the memory effects) and the non linearity parameter a. We present analytical solutions via three complementary approaches: the fractional Riccati method, the Adomian decomposition method, and the scaling method. The FNLSE is formulated in terms of generalized Hamiltonian and momentum operators, allowing a unified framework to explore various solution structures. A continuity equation is derived, and a general class of solutions based on Mittag Leffler (ML) plane waves is proposed, from which generalized momentum and energy eigenvalues are systematically classified. Utilizing a generalized Wick rotation, we establish a connection between the FNLSE and a fractional Fokker Planck equation governing a dual stochastic process, revealing links to Q Gaussian statistics. Through separation of variables, we classify a family of solutions including chiral ML plane waves. Additionally, we construct Riccati type bright and dark solitons and assess their stability using a dynamical distance metric. As alpha changes, i.e. the memory effects are tuned, the bright solitons transform to dark solitons, which is equivalent to focusing defocusing transition. A series solution is developed via the Adomian decomposition technique, applied to both chiral and plane wave cases. Finally, we reduce the dimensionality of the FNLSE using the scaling arguments, leading to self similar solutions, and find pure phase as well as Adomian type solutions. Our results highlight the rich analytical landscape of the FNLSE and provide insights into its underlying physical and mathematical structure.

Title: Numerical Analysis of Damage Evolution in Open Hole CFRP Laminates Modified with Electrospun Self Healing Diels Alder Interleaves
Authors: Marianna Chantzi, Vassilis Kostopoulos, Spyridon Psarras
Abstract: The study analyzes open hole carbon fiber reinforced polymer CFRP laminates modified with electrospun interleaves containing Diels Alder-based self-healing agents. It develops a high-fidelity simulation framework to investigate the quasistatic tensile behavior of these composites. The study uses Hashin's failure criteria to capture intralaminar damage and surface-based cohesive contact interactions to model interlaminar delamination. Two interleave configurations are examined: solution electrospinning (SEP) for full thickness coverage and melt electrospinning (MEP) for localized reinforcement. Results show good agreement with experimental data, capturing key failure mechanisms like matrix cracking, fiber breakage, and delamination. The study emphasizes the importance of spatially resolved cohesive properties and meshing strategies in accurately simulating damage progression.

Title: On the transmission of texts: written cultures as complex systems
Authors: Jean-Baptiste Camps, Julien Randon-Furling, Ulysse Godreau
Abstract: Our knowledge of past cultures relies considerably on written material. For centuries, texts have been copied, altered, then transmitted or lost - eventually, from surviving documents, philologists attempt to reconstruct text phylogenies ("stemmata"), and past written cultures. Nonetheless, fundamental questions on the extent of losses, representativeness of surviving artefacts, and the dynamics of text genealogies have remained open since the earliest days of philology. To address these, we radically rethink the study of text transmission through a complexity science approach, integrating stochastic modelling, computer simulations, and data analysis, in a parsimonious mindset akin to statistical physics and evolutionary biology. Thus, we design models that are simple and general, while accounting for diachrony and other key aspects of the dynamical process underlying text phylogenies, such as the extinction of entire branches or trees. On the well-known case study of Medieval French chivalric literature, we find that up to 60% of texts and 99% of manuscripts were lost (consistent with recent synchronic "biodiversity" analyses). We also settle a hundred-year-old controversy on the bifidity of stemmata. Further, our null model suggests that pure chance ("drift") is not the only mechanism at play, and we provide a theoretical and empirical framework for future investigation.

Title: Universal dissipators for driven open quantum systems and the correction to linear response
Authors: Lorenzo Bernazzani, Balázs Gulácsi, Guido Burkard
Abstract: We investigate in parallel two common pictures used to describe quantum systems interacting with their surrounding environment, i.e., the stochastic Hamiltonian description, where the environment is implicitly included in the fluctuating internal parameters of the system, and the explicit inclusion of the environment via the time-convolutionless projection operator method. Utilizing these two different frameworks, we show that the dissipator characterizing the dynamics of the reduced system, determined up to second order in the noise strength or bath-system coupling, is universal. That is, it keeps the same form regardless of the drive term, as long as the drive is weak. We thoroughly discuss the assumptions on which this treatment is based and its limitations. By considering the first non-vanishing higher-order term in our expansion, we also derive the linear response correction due to memory-mediated environmental effects in driven-dissipative systems. We demonstrate this technique to be highly accurate for the problems of dephasing in a driven qubit and for the theory of pseudomodes for quantum environments.

Title: Spin-qubit readout analysis based on a Hidden Markov Model
Authors: Maria Spethmann, Peter Stano, Daniel Loss
Abstract: Across most qubit platforms, the readout fidelities do not keep up with the gate fidelities, and new ways to increase the readout fidelities are searched for. For semiconductor spin qubits, a typical qubit-readout signal consists of a finite stretch of a digitized charge-sensor output. Such a signal trace is usually analyzed by compressing it into a single value, either maximum or sum. The binary measurement result follows by comparing the single value to a decision threshold fixed in advance. This threshold method, while simple and fast, omits information that could potentially improve the readout fidelity. Here, we analyze what can be achieved by more sophisticated signal-trace processing using the Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The HMM is a natural choice, being the optimal statistical processing if the noise is white. It also has a computationally efficient implementation, known as the forward-backward algorithm, making HMM processing practical. However, unlike in many computer-simulation studies, in real experiments the noise is correlated. How this change affects the HMM implementation and reliability is our subject. We find that the HMM using white noise as the system statistical model is surprisingly sensitive to correlations; it only tolerates very small correlation times. We suggest alleviating this deficiency by a signal pre-filtering. The correlations have a similar strongly negative impact on the HMM model calibration (the Baum-Welch algorithm). Besides studying the effects of noise correlations, as a specific application of the HMM we calculate the readout fidelity at elevated temperatures, relevant to recent experimental pursuits of `hot' spin qubits.

Title: Matrix-product-state approach for qubits-waveguide systems in real space
Authors: Shimpei Goto
Abstract: We present a matrix-product-state-based numerical approach for simulating systems composed of several qubits and a common one-dimensional waveguide. In the presented approach, the one-dimensional waveguide is modeled in real space. Thus, one can use the advantage of matrix-product states that are suited for simulating low-entangled one-dimensional systems. The price to pay is that the vacuum of the waveguide in this modeling becomes the Bogoliubov vacuum, and one has to consider a not-so-small local Hilbert space for bosonic degrees of freedom. To manage the large local Hilbert space, we adopt the recently proposed single-site schemes. We demonstrate the potential of the presented approach by simulating superradiant phenomena within the Hamiltonian dynamics.

Title: Recurrent Self-Attention Dynamics: An Energy-Agnostic Perspective from Jacobians
Authors: Akiyoshi Tomihari, Ryo Karakida
Abstract: The theoretical understanding of self-attention (SA) has been steadily progressing. A prominent line of work studies a class of SA layers that admit an energy function decreased by state updates. While it provides valuable insights into inherent biases in signal propagation, it often relies on idealized assumptions or additional constraints not necessarily present in standard SA. Thus, to broaden our understanding, this work aims to relax these energy constraints and provide an energy-agnostic characterization of inference dynamics by dynamical systems analysis. In more detail, we first consider relaxing the symmetry and single-head constraints traditionally required in energy-based formulations. Next, to investigate more general SA architectures capable of oscillatory dynamics without necessarily admitting an energy function, we analyze the Jacobian matrix of the state. We reveal that normalization layers effectively normalize the Jacobian's complex eigenvalues, forcing the dynamics close to a critical state. This significantly enhances inference performance. Furthermore, we utilize the Jacobian perspective to develop regularization methods for training and a pseudo-energy for monitoring inference dynamics.

Title: On the asymptotic scaling of the von Neumann entropy in quasifree fermionic right mover/left mover systems
Authors: Walter H. Aschbacher
Abstract: For the general class of quasifree fermionic right mover/left mover systems over the infinitely extended two-sided discrete line introduced in [8] within the algebraic framework of quantum statistical mechanics, we study the von Neumann entropy of a contiguous subsystem of finite length in interaction with its environment. In particular, under the assumption of spatial translation invariance, we analyze the asymptotic behavior of the von Neumann entropy for large subsystem lengths and prove that its leading order density is, in general, nonvanishing and displays the signature of a mixture of the independent thermal species underlying the right mover/left mover system. As special cases, the formalism covers so-called nonequilibrium steady states, thermal equilibrium states, and ground states. Moreover, for general Fermi functions, we derive a necessary and sufficient criterion for the von Neumann entropy density to vanish.

Title: Tight Generalization of Robertson-Type Uncertainty Relations
Authors: Gen Kimura, Aina Mayumi, Haruki Yamashita
Abstract: We establish the tightest possible Robertson-type preparation uncertainty relation, which explicitly depends on the eigenvalue spectrum of the quantum state. The conventional constant 1/4 is replaced by a state-dependent coefficient with the largest and smallest eigenvalues of the density operator. This coefficient is optimal among all Robertson-type generalizations and does not admit further improvement. Our relation becomes more pronounced as the quantum state becomes more mixed, capturing a trade-off in quantum uncertainty that the conventional Robertson relation fails to detect. In addition, our result provides a strict generalization of the Schroedinger uncertainty relation, showing that the uncertainty trade-off is governed by the sum of the covariance term and a state-dependent improvement over the Robertson bound. As applications, we also refine error-disturbance trade-offs by incorporating spectral information of both the system and the measuring apparatus, thereby generalizing the Arthurs-Goodman and Ozawa inequalities.

Title: Effective potential of scalar Lee-Wick pseudo-electrodynamics
Authors: M. J. Neves
Abstract: The study of effective potential for the scalar Lee-Wick pseudo-electrodynamics in one-loop is presented in this letter. The planar and non-local Lee-Wick pseudo-electrodynamics is so coupled to a complex scalar field sector in 1+2 dimensions, where we achieve the Lee-Wick pseudo-scalar electrodynamics. The effective action formalism is applied such that the quantum corrections are examined in one loop to the scalar effective potential as function of the classical field, of the Lee-Wick mass, and also of the coupling constants of this model. The instability of the effective potential is investigated due to Lee-Wick mass.

Title: Universal scaling of intra-urban climate fluctuations
Authors: Marc Duran-Sala, Martin Hendrick, Gabriele Manoli
Abstract: Urban-induced changes in local microclimate, such as the urban heat island effect and air pollution, are known to vary with city size, leading to distinctive relations between average climate variables and city-scale quantities (e.g., total population or area). However, these approaches suffer from biases related to the choice of city boundaries and they neglect intra-urban variations of urban characteristics. Here we use high-resolution data of urban temperatures, air quality, population counts, and street intersections from 142 cities worldwide and show that their marginal and joint probability distributions follow universal scaling functions. By using a logarithmic relation between urban spatial features and climate variables, we show that average street network properties are sufficient to characterize the entire variability of the temperature and air pollution fields observed within and across cities. We further demonstrate that traditional models linking climate variables to the distance from the city center fail to reproduce the observed distributions unless the stochasticity of urban structure is fully considered. These findings provide a unified statistical framework for characterizing intra-urban climate variability, with important implications for climate modelling and urban planning.

Title: Exploring Aperiodic Order in Photonic Time Crystals
Authors: Marino Coppolaro, Massimo Moccia, Giuseppe Castaldi, Vincenzo Galdi
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for analyzing aperiodically ordered photonic time quasicrystals (PTQCs), which are the temporal analogs of spatial photonic quasicrystals. Using a general two-symbol substitutional sequence to model temporal modulations, we extend the trace and anti-trace map formalism used for spatial photonic quasicrystals to the temporal domain. Focusing on the Thue-Morse sequence as a representative example, we examine the band structure and wave-transport properties, discussing their physical origins and highlighting both similarities and key differences with conventional periodic photonic time crystals. Furthermore, we investigate the peculiar features of PTQCs, such as multiscale spectral response and localization effects. Our findings provide valuable insights into the complex interplay between aperiodic order and wave dynamics in time-varying media, highlighting its potential to enable the development of advanced photonic devices.

Title: Sublimation of orientated amino acid films for reliable, amplified piezoelectric performance
Authors: Ciaran O Malley, Muhammad Usaid Memon, Krishna Hari, Tara Ryan, Sarah Guerin
Abstract: Biomolecular crystals, such as amino acids, peptides, and proteins, have emerged as potential next generation piezoelectric materials due to their low-cost, biocompatibility, eco-friendliness, and reduced permittivity versus ceramics. However, many challenges have limited their acceleration into mainstream sensing applications. Their natural self-assembly from saturated solutions into polycrystalline films reduces their effective piezoelectric output, and results in high variability within individual samples, and across sample batches when scaled-up. Here we validate the sublimation of a variety of amino acids onto conductive substrates as an effective technique for overcoming these challenges. This solvent-free crystallisation technique results in polycrystalline films with uniformly orientated crystals, and a resulting piezoelectric response that exceeds that of single crystals. We report a maximum piezoelectric response of 9.6 pC/N in films of L-Valine, which matches the predicted single crystal response, and a maximum voltage output of 4.6 V. For L-Methionine and L-Valine sublimated films the material properties are consistent at all points on the piezoelectric films and repeatable across any number of films grown under the same conditions.

Title: Vortex Fractional Fermion Number through Heat Kernel methods and Edge States
Authors: Sylvain Fichet, Rodrigo Fresneda, Lucas de Souza, Dmitri Vassilevich
Abstract: Computing the vacuum expectation of fermion number operator on a soliton background is often challenging. A recent proposal in arXiv:2305.1360(6) simplifies this task by considering the soliton in a bounded region and relating the $\eta$ invariant, and thus the fermion number, to a specific heat kernel coefficient and to contributions from the edge states. We test this method in a system of charged fermions living on an Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen (ANO) vortex background. We show that the resulting $\eta$ invariant is independent of boundary conditions, confirming the validity of the method. Our analysis reveals a nontrivial feature for the fermionic spectrum in the vortex-induced Higgs phase. As a by-product, we also find that for a vortex living on a disk, the edge states carry fractional charge.

Title: Theoretical Study of Charge Transport Properties of Curved PAH Organic Semiconductors
Authors: Hengyu Jin, Xiaoqi Sun, Guiya Qin, Zhipeng Tong, Rui Wang, Qi Zhao, Ai-Min Ren, Jingfu Guo
Abstract: Curved polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) exhibit distinctive geometric and electronic structures, rendering them highly promising in addressing issues of solubility and air stability, which are faced for large linear arene $\pi$-conjugated organic semiconductors. In this study, a series of surface-curved PAHs and the heteroatom doped derivatives are selected and designed, and the relationship between electronic structure and charge transport properties of these molecules is investigated by using density functional theory (DFT). And the effects of sulfur/oxygen, nitrogen and boron doping on the charge transport performance of curved PAH semiconductors are explored. The results show that curved PAHs exhibit improved solubility and stability, with the degree of molecular curvature significantly affecting the material's transport properties.

Title: Local Electronic Structure around a Single Impurity in an Anderson Lattice Model for Topological Kondo Insulators
Authors: C.-C. Joseph Wang, Jean-Pierre Julien, A. V. Balatsky, Jian-Xin Zhu
Abstract: Shortly after the discovery of topological band insulators, the topological Kondo insulators (TKIs) have also been theoretically predicted. The latter has ignited revival interest in the properties of Kondo insulators. Currently, the feasibility of topological nature in SmB$_6$ has been intensively analyzed by several complementary probes. Here by starting with a minimal-orbital Anderson lattice model, we explore the local electronic structure in a Kondo insulator. We show that the two strong topological regimes sandwiching the weak topological regime give rise to a single Dirac cone, which is located near the center or corner of the surface Brillouin zone. We further find that, when a single impurity is placed on the surface, low-energy resonance states are induced in the weak scattering limit for the strong TKI regimes and the resonance level moves monotonically across the hybridization gap with the strength of impurity scattering potential; while low energy states can only be induced in the unitary scattering limit for the weak TKI regime, where the resonance level moves universally toward the center of the hybridization gap. These impurity induced low-energy quasiparticles will lead to characteristic signatures in scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, which has recently found success in probing into exotic properties in heavy fermion systems.

Title: Missing odd-order Shapiro steps do not uniquely indicate fractional Josephson effect
Authors: P. Zhang, S. Mudi, M. Pendharkar, J.S. Lee, C.P. Dempsey, A.P. McFadden, S.D. Harrington, J.T. Dong, H. Wu, A.-H. Chen, M. Hocevar, C.J. Palmstrøm, S.M. Frolov
Abstract: Topological superconductivity is expected to spur Majorana zero modes -- exotic states that are also considered a quantum technology asset. Fractional Josephson effect is their manifestation in electronic transport measurements, often under microwave irradiation. A fraction of induced resonances, known as Shapiro steps, should vanish, in a pattern that signifies the presence of Majorana modes. Here we report patterns of Shapiro steps expected in topological Josephson junctions, such as the missing first Shapiro step, or several missing odd-order steps. But our junctions, which are InAs quantum wells with Al contacts, are studied near zero magnetic field, meaning that they are not in the topological regime. We also observe other patterns such as missing even steps and several missing steps in a row, not relevant to topological superconductivity. Potentially responsible for our observations is rounding of not fully developed steps superimposed on non-monotonic resistance versus voltage curves, but several origins may be at play. Our results demonstrate that any single pattern, even striking, cannot uniquely identify topological superconductivity, and a multifactor approach is necessary to unambiguously establish this important phenomenon.

Title: Highly ordered LIPSS on Au thin film for plasmonic sensing fabricated by double femtosecond pulses
Authors: Fotis Fraggelakis, Panagiotis Lingos, George D. Tsibidis, Emma Cusworth, N. Kay, L. Fumagalli, Vasyl G. Kravets, Alexander N. Grigorenko, Andrei V. Kabashin, Emmanuel Stratakis
Abstract: Periodic plasmonic arrays making possible excitations of surface lattice resonances (SLRs) or quasi-resonant features are of great importance for biosensing and other applications. Fabrication of such arrays over a large area is typically very costly and time-consuming when performed using conventional electron beam lithography and other methods, which reduce application prospects. Here, we propose a technique of double femtosecond pulse (~ 170 fs) laser-assisted structuring of thin (~ 32 nm) Au films deposited on a glass substrate and report a single-step fabrication of homogeneous and highly ordered Au-based Laser Induced Periodic Surface Structures (LIPSS) over a large area. Our experimental results unveil the key importance of the interpulse delay as the determining factor rendering possible the homogeneity of laser induced structures and confirm that highly ordered, functional LIPSS occur solely upon double pulse irradiation under a specific interpulse delay range. A theoretical investigation complements experimental results providing remarkable insights on the structure formation mechanism. Ellipsometric measurements show that such LIPSS structures can exhibit highly valuable plasmonic features in light reflection. In particular, we observed ultranarrow resonances associated with diffraction-coupled SLRs, which are of paramount importance for biosensing and other applications. The presented data suggest that femtosecond double pulse structuring of thin metal films can serve as a valuable and low-cost tool for a large-scale fabrication of highly ordered functional elements and structures.

Title: Bounds on eigenstate thermalization
Authors: Shoki Sugimoto, Ryusuke Hamazaki, Masahito Ueda
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which asserts that every eigenstate of a many-body quantum system is indistinguishable from a thermal ensemble, plays a pivotal role in understanding thermalization of isolated quantum systems. Yet, no evidence has been obtained as to whether the ETH holds for all few-body operators in a chaotic system; such few-body operators include key quantities in statistical mechanics, such as the total magnetization, the momentum distributions, and their low-order thermal and quantum fluctuations. Here, we formulate a conjecture that for a generic nonintegrable system the ETH holds for all $m$-body operators with $m < {\alpha}_{\ast} N$ in the thermodynamic limit for some nonzero constant ${\alpha}_{\ast} > 0$. We first prove this statement for systems with Haar-distributed energy eigenstates to analytically motivate our conjecture. We then verify the conjecture for generic spin, Bose, and Fermi systems with local and few-body interactions by large-scale numerical calculations. Our results imply that generic systems satisfy the ETH for all few-body operators, including their thermal and quantum fluctuations.

Title: Electric and thermoelectric response for Weyl and multi-Weyl semimetals in planar Hall configurations including the effects of strain
Authors: Rahul Ghosh, Ipsita Mandal
Abstract: We investigate the response tensors in planar Hall (or planar thermal Hall) configurations such that a three-dimensional Weyl or multi-Weyl semimetal is subjected to the influence of an electric field $\mathbf E $ (or temperature gradient $\nabla_{\mathbf r } T$) and an effective magnetic field $\mathbf B^{\rm tot}$, which are oriented at a generic angle with respect to each other. The effective magnetic field consists of two parts: (a) an actual/physical magnetic field $\mathbf B $, and (b) an emergent magnetic field $\mathbf B_5 $ which quantifies the elastic deformations of the sample. $\mathbf B_5 $ is an axial pseudomagnetic field because it couples to conjugate nodal points with opposite chiralities with opposite signs. We study the interplay of the orientations of these two components of $\mathbf B^{\rm tot}$ with respect to the direction of the electric field (or temperature gradient) and elucidate how it affects the characteristics involving the chirality of the node. Additionally, we show that the magnitude and sharpness of the conductivity tensor profiles strongly depend on the value of the topological charge at the node in question.

Title: Efficient fabrication of high-density ensembles of color centers via ion implantation on a hot diamond substrate

Abstract: Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are promising systems for quantum technologies, including quantum metrology and sensing. A promising strategy for the achievement of high sensitivity to external fields relies on the exploitation of large ensembles of NV centers, whose fabrication by ion implantation is upper limited by the amount of radiation damage introduced in the diamond lattice. In this works we demonstrate an approach to increase the density of NV centers upon the high-fluence implantation of MeV N2+ ions on a hot target substrate (>550 °C). Our results show that, with respect to room-temperature implantation, the high-temperature process increases the vacancy density threshold required for the irreversible conversion of diamond to a graphitic phase, thus enabling to achieve higher density ensembles. Furthermore, the formation efficiency of color centers was investigated on diamond substrates implanted at varying temperatures with MeV N2+ and Mg+ ions revealing that the formation efficiency of both NV centers and magnesium-vacancy (MgV) centers increases with the implantation temperature.

Title: Topological transport of vorticity on curved magnetic membranes
Authors: Chau Dao, Ji Zou, Eric Kleinherbers, Yaroslav Tserkovnyak
Abstract: In this work, we study the transport of vorticity on curved dynamical two-dimensional magnetic membranes. We find that topological transport can be controlled by geometrically reducing symmetries, enabling processes absent from flat magnetic systems. To this end, the vorticity 3-current is constructed, which obeys a continuity equation immune to local disturbances of the magnetic texture and spatiotemporal fluctuations of the membrane. We show how electric current can manipulate vortex transport in geometrically nontrivial magnetic systems. As an illustrative example, we propose a minimal setup that realizes an experimentally feasible energy storage device and discuss its thermodynamic efficiency in terms of a vortexoelectric counterpart of the thermoelectric figure of merit $ZT$.

Title: Chiral electronic excitations and strong electron-phonon coupling to Weyl fermions in the Kagome semimetal Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$
Authors: G. He, M. Kute, Z. C. Xu, L. Peis, R. Stumberger, A. Baum, D. Jost, E. M. Been, B. Moritz, J. Shen, Y. G. Shi, T. P. Devereaux, R. Hackl
Abstract: We present results of a Raman scattering study of the Kagome ferromagnet Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$, with a focus on electronic and phononic excitations and their interplay. We provide a theoretical analysis of the electronic band structure, enabling a semi-quantitative explanation of the spectra. A prominent feature in the electronic spectra is a redistribution of spectral weight from low to high energies in all polarization configurations starting at the Curie temperature T$_C$. In the symmetry-resolved spectra, the suppression of the A$_{1g}$ continuum in the ferromagnetic state arises from the redistribution of electronic states below T$_C$, while a strong enhancement of the A$_{2g}$ continuum is linked to the dynamics of fermions near the Fermi level $E_{\rm F}$ being characterized by spin-momentum locking near Weyl points. The A$_{1g}$ phonon modulates the position of these Weyl points and couples strongly to the related fermions close to $E_{\rm F}$. These results allow a comprehensive understanding of the bulk band structure evolution as a function of temperature in Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$, offering key insights for further studies of the driving force behind the long-range magnetic order and novel topological states in this compound.

Title: Macroscopic Irreversibility in Quantum Systems: Free Expansion in a Fermion Chain
Authors: Hal Tasaki
Abstract: We consider a free fermion chain with uniform nearest-neighbor hopping and let it evolve from an arbitrary initial state with a fixed macroscopic number of particles. We then prove that, at a sufficiently large and typical time, the measured coarse-grained density distribution is almost uniform with (quantum mechanical) probability extremely close to one. This establishes the emergence of irreversible behavior, i.e., a ballistic diffusion, in a system governed by quantum mechanical unitary time evolution. It is conceptually important that irreversibility from any initial state is proved here without introducing any randomness to the initial state or the Hamiltonian, while the known examples, both classical and quantum, rely on certain randomness or apply to limited classes of initial states. The essential new ingredient in the proof is the large deviation bound for every energy eigenstate, which is reminiscent of the strong ETH (energy eigenstate thermalization hypothesis).

Title: Isolated nearly flat higher Chern band in monolayer transition metal trihalides
Authors: Kejie Bao, Huan Wang, Jiaxuan Guo, Yadong Jiang, Haosheng Xu, Jing Wang
Abstract: The interplay between non-trivial topology and strong electron interaction can generate a variety of exotic quantum matter. Here we theoretically propose that monolayer transition metal trihalides MoF$_3$ and W$X_3$ ($X$= Cl, Br, I) have isolated nearly flat band near the Fermi level with higher Chern number $\mathcal{C}=+3$ and $\mathcal{C}=-2$, respectively. The nontrivial topology of these flat Chern bands originates from the effective $sd^2$ hybridization of transition metal atom, which transform the apparent atomic $d$ orbitals on a hexagonal lattice into $(s, p_+, p_-)$ orbitals on a triangular lattice. Interestingly, the quantum geometry of flat Chern bands in these materials are comparable with those in moiré systems exhibiting fractional Chern insulator state. The Hofstadter butterfly of such flat Chern bands are further studied. These natural materials, if realized experimentally, could offer new platforms to explore correlated phenomena driven by flat Chern band with higher Chern number.

Title: Merons, hedgehogs and magnetoelectric switching in spiral multiferroics
Authors: Luca Maranzana, Naoto Nagaosa, Sergey Artyukhin
Abstract: In spiral multiferroics, magnetism induces ferroelectricity, thus holding a promise for novel memory devices where an electric field switches magnetic bits. However, such a switching process, in which magnetic domain walls are moved electrically, is still poorly understood. We find multiferroic domain walls containing arrays of meron (half-skyrmion) strings with a plethora of topological defects, which profoundly affect wall dynamics. Minimum energy walls have alternating meron topological charges and move as relativistic massive particles, with velocity limited by the magnon speed. During domain nucleation, walls with non-alternating meron charges appear. Such defects result in a peculiar non-local dynamics where all the spins in the system rotate, and the wall mobility is suppressed. Meron strings possess 0D hedgehog defects, analogous to Bloch points, that pin the wall to the lattice. This fascinating interplay of magnetoelectric switching with a variety of topological defects and non-local spin dynamics opens a new playground for the electric manipulation of spins.

Title: The Interplay Between Forces, Particle Rearrangements, and Macroscopic Stress Fluctuations in Sheared 2D Granular Media
Authors: Kwangmin Lee, Ryan C. Hurley
Abstract: Recent studies have established correlations between non-affine motion and macroscopic stress fluctuations in sheared granular media. However, a comprehensive examination of the relationship between non-affine motion, macroscopic stress fluctuations, and inter-particle forces remains lacking. We investigated this interplay in simulations of 2D granular media during stick-slip events under plane shear. We found that, during most large slip events, particles with the greatest non-affine motion, as quantified by D2min, initially coalesce into one or two dominant connected clusters. These clusters coincide with the region exhibiting the greatest instantaneous reduction in inter-particle forces, indicating a significant correlation between inter-particle force fluctuations and particle rearrangements. Furthermore, the magnitude of the greatest non-affine motion within these clusters correlates strongly with the magnitude of macroscopic stress fluctuations during slip events. This correlation increased when the non-affine motion of particles in a neighborhood around the point of greatest non-affine motion was included in the analysis, suggesting that plastic events are best understood as regional rather than point-like occurrences. Our results held for various inter-particle friction coefficients. Our findings suggest that elastoplastic models should consider plastic events as regional rather than point-like and highlight the importance of studying the propagation of particle rearrangements.

Title: Quasiperiodic Quadrupole Insulators
Authors: Raul Liquito, Miguel Gonçalves, Eduardo V. Castro
Abstract: Higher-order topological insulators are an intriguing new family of topological states that host lower-dimensional boundary states. Concurrently, quasiperiodic systems have garnered significant interest due to their complex localization and topological properties. In this work we study the impact of chiral symmetry preserving quasiperiodic modulations on the paradigmatic Benalcazar-Bernevig-Hughes model, which hosts topological insulating phases with zero-energy sublattice-polarized modes. We find that the topological properties are not only robust to the quasiperiodic modulation, but can even be enriched. In particular, we unveil the first instance of a quasiperiodic induced second-order topological insulating phase. Furthermore, in contrast with disorder, we find that quasiperiodic modulations can induce multiple reentrant topological transitions, showing an intricate sequence of localization properties. Our results open a promising avenue for exploring the rich interplay between higher-order topology and quasiperiodicity.

Title: Connected Network Model for the Mechanical Loss of Amorphous Materials
Authors: Steven Blaber, Daniel Bruns, Jörg Rottler
Abstract: Dissipation in amorphous solids at low frequencies is commonly attributed to activated transitions of isolated two-level systems (TLS) that come in resonance with elastic or electric fields. Materials with low mechanical or dielectric loss are urgently needed for applications in gravitational wave detection, high precision sensors, and quantum computing. Using atomistic modeling, we explore the energy landscape of amorphous silicon and titanium dioxide, and find that the pairs of energy minima that constitute single TLS form a sparsely connected network with complex topologies. Motivated by this observation, we develop an analytically tractable theory for mechanical loss of the full network from a nonequilibrium thermodynamic perspective. We demonstrate that the connectivity of the network introduces new mechanisms that can both reduce low frequency dissipation through additional low energy relaxation pathways, and increase dissipation through a broad distribution of energy minima. As a result, the connected network model predicts mechanical loss with distinct frequency profiles compared to the isolated TLS model. This not only calls into question the validity of the TLS model, but also gives us many new avenues and properties to analyze for the targeted design of low mechanical loss materials.

Title: Modeling the differential susceptibility by Lorentzians
Authors: Alexej Perevertov
Abstract: The idea to extract information on magnetically different phases from magnetic measurements is very attractive and many efforts have been made in this area. One of the most popular direction is to use the Preisach model formalism to analyze the 2D Preisach distribution function (PDF) obtained either from first order reversal curves (FORC) or minor loops. Here we present an alternative a much simpler procedure -- the analysis of the derivative of the saturation magnetization loop, the differential susceptibility curve. It follows the Lorentzian shape with very high accuracy for ferromagnetic polycrystalline materials. This allows decomposing any differential susceptibility curve of a complex multi-phase material into individual components representing different magnetic phases by Lorenzian peaks -- in the same way as it is done in X-ray diffraction analysis of materials. We show that the minor differential susceptibility curves also have the Lorenzian shape that can facilitate calculation of the Preisach distribution function from the experimental curves and reduce noise in the resulting PDF.

Title: +SSLIP: Automated Radon-Assisted and Rotation-Corrected Identification of Complex HCP Slip System Activity Fields from DIC Data
Authors: T. Vermeij, G. Slokker, C.J.A. Mornout, D. König, J.P.M. Hoefnagels
Abstract: Identification of crystallographic slip in metals and alloys is crucial to understand and improve their mechanical behavior. Recently, a novel slip system identification framework, termed SSLIP (for Slip Systems based Local Identification of Plasticity), was introduced to leap from conventional trace-based identification to automated, point-by-point identification, exploiting the full deformation kinematics. Using sub-micron-scale Digital Image Correlation (DIC) deformation fields aligned to Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) data, SSLIP matches the measured in-plane displacement gradient tensor to the kinematics of the optimal combination of multiple slip system activities, at each DIC datapoint. SSLIP was demonstrated to be successful on virtual and experimental case studies of FCC and BCC metals. However, for more challenging HCP crystal structures, the complete identification of all slip systems was found to be more challenging, posing limitations on automation and flexibility. To extend the capabilities of SSLIP, we propose an extended framework, hereinafter referred to as the +SSLIP method, which includes (i) a preselection of slip systems using a Radon transform, (ii) robustness to measured rigid body rotation by simultaneous identification of the local rotation field, (iii) identification of the two best matching slip systems for each data point, and (iv) a procedure to determine groups of slip systems with in-plane displacement gradient tensors that cannot be discriminated. This procedure yields the full (HCP) slip system activity maps for every slip system in each grain. The resulting objective identification method does not rely on the Schmid factor to select which slip system is active at each point. We show how slip systems from multiple slip families are successfully identified on virtual and real experiments on a Zn polycrystalline coating.

Title: Multiscale Excitations in the Diluted Two-dimensional S = 1/2 Heisenberg Antiferromagnet
Authors: Liuyun Dao, Hui Shao, Anders W. Sandvik
Abstract: We study the excitation spectrum of the $S=1/2$ Heisenberg model on the randomly diluted square lattice by analytic continuation of QMC data. At dilution fractions $p=1/16$ and $p=1/8$, the dynamic structure factor $S({\bf q},\omega)$ exhibits a damped magnon peak with anomalous dispersion near ${\bf q}=(0,0)$ and $(\pi,\pi)$, a non-dispersive low-energy localization peak, and a second peak between these two features. A magnon with anomalous dispersion, close to our result, was predicted in spin wave and $T$-matrix theory [A. Chernyshev et al., PRB {\bf 65}, 104407 (2002)], above the localization energy. However, no intermediate mode was predicted. Analyzing spectral functions in real space for individual vacancy realizations by energy tomography, we find that these excitations are concentrated on a small subset of the spins adjacent to vacancies. We argue that the low-energy excitations are those of a sparse random network of effective moments at a fraction of the vacancies. There is a shift in magnon spectral weight distribution, from the spins away from vacancies at high energy to those adjacent to vacancies at lower energy. We also analyze the Anderson quantum rotor excitation at $\omega \propto N^{-1}$ (with $N=L^2$ the system size), which in the clean system is visible in $S({\bf q},\omega)$ only at ${\bf q}=(\pi,\pi)$ but spreads through the Brillouin zone when $p>0$. Weight close to ${\bf q}=(0,0)$ and $(\pi,\pi)$ is explained by local sublattice imbalance within a dimer-monomer model but there is also structure arising from correlated singlet fluctuations, which we demonstrate by enhancing said fluctuations with four-spin couplings. All spectral features found here should be observable by elastic neutron scattering experiments on layered quantum antiferromagnets doped with nonmagnetic impurities.

Title: Nonequilibrium chemical short-range order in metallic alloys
Authors: Mahmudul Islam, Killian Sheriff, Yifan Cao, Rodrigo Freitas
Abstract: Metallic alloys are routinely subjected to nonequilibrium processes during manufacturing, such as rapid solidification and thermomechanical processing. It has been suggested in the high-entropy alloy literature that chemical short-range order (SRO) could offer a ''new knob'' to tailor materials properties. While evidence of the effect of SRO on materials properties accumulates, the state of SRO evolution during alloy manufacturing remains obscure. Here, we employ high-fidelity atomistic simulations to track SRO evolution during the solidification and thermomechanical processing of alloys. Our investigation reveals that alloy processing can lead to nonequilibrium steady-states of SRO that are different from any equilibrium state. The mechanism behind nonequilibrium SRO formation is shown to be an inherent ordering bias present in nonequilibrium events. These results demonstrate that conventional manufacturing processes provide pathways for tuning SRO that lead to a broad nonequilibrium spectrum of SRO states beyond the equilibrium design space of alloys.

Title: Hyperdisordered cell packing on a growing surface
Authors: Robert J. H. Ross, Giovanni D. Masucci, Chun Yen Lin, Teresa L. Iglesias, Sam Reiter, Simone Pigolotti
Abstract: While the physics of disordered packing in non-growing systems is well understood, unexplored phenomena can emerge when packing takes place in growing domains. We study the arrangements of pigment cells (chromatophores) on squid skin as a biological example of a packed system on an expanding surface. We find that relative density fluctuations in cell numbers grow with spatial scale. We term this behavior ``hyperdisordered'', in contrast with hyperuniform behavior in which relative fluctuations tend to zero at large scale. We find that hyperdisordered scaling, akin to that of a critical system, is quantitatively reproduced by a model in which hard disks are randomly inserted in a homogeneously growing surface. In addition, we find that chromatophores increase in size during animal development, but maintain a stationary size distribution. The physical mechanisms described in our work may apply to a broad class of growing dense systems.

Title: Magnon Nonlinear Hall Effect in 2D Antiferromagnetic Insulators
Authors: Jinyang Ni, Yuanjun Jin, Guoqing Chang
Abstract: The efficient detection of the magnetism in 2D antiferromagnetic (AFM) insulators is crucial for the advancement of 2D AFM spintronics and remains a challenging problem. In this letter, we introduce the magnon nonlinear Hall current, a second-order Hall response of collective spin excitations in ordered magnets, as a novel probe for 2D layered AFM insulators. We theoretically demonstrate that the nonlinear Hall effect is intrinsically coupled to the underlying spin configuration. In particular, it exhibits a pronounced layer dependence in layered antiferromagnets, enabling direct characterization of the nature and strength of interlayer magnetic coupling in multilayer AFM insulators. Furthermore, we show that a a slight external field perturbation can induce and manipulate the magnon nonlinear Hall response. Our work establishes a novel approach for exploring 2D antiferromagnetism and holds great promise for AFM spintronic applications

Title: Dissipation enables robust extensive scaling of multipartite correlations
Authors: Krzysztof Ptaszynski, Massimiliano Esposito
Abstract: We investigate the multipartite mutual information between $N$ discrete-state stochastic units interacting in a network that is invariant under unit permutations. We show that when the system relaxes to fixed point attractors, multipartite correlations in the stationary state either do not scale extensively with $N$, or the extensive scaling is not robust to arbitrarily small perturbations of the system dynamics. In particular, robust extensive scaling cannot occur in thermodynamic equilibrium. In contrast, mutual information scales extensively when the system relaxes to time-dependent attractors (e.g., limit cycles), which can occur only far from equilibrium. This demonstrates the essential role of dissipation in the generation and maintenance of multipartite correlations. We illustrate our theory with the nonequilibrium Potts model.

Title: Universal Linear Response of the Mean First-Passage Time
Authors: Tommer D. Keidar, Shlomi Reuveni
Abstract: First-passage processes are pervasive across numerous scientific fields, yet a general framework for understanding their response to external perturbations remains elusive. While the fluctuation-dissipation theorem offers a complete linear response theory for systems in steady-state, it fails to apply to transient first-passage processes. We address this challenge by focusing on rare, rather than weak, perturbations. Surprisingly, we discover that the linear response of the mean first-passage time (MFPT) to such perturbations is universal. It depends solely on the first two moments of the unperturbed first-passage time and the mean completion time following perturbation activation, without any assumptions about the underlying system's dynamics. To demonstrate the utility of our findings, we analyze the MFPT response of drift-diffusion processes in two scenarios: (i) stochastic resetting with information feedback, and (ii) an abrupt transition from a linear to a logarithmic potential. In both cases, our approach bypasses the need for explicit determination of the perturbed dynamics, unraveling a highly non-trivial response landscape with minimal effort. Finally, we show how our framework enables a new type of experiment-inferring molecular-level fluctuations from bulk measurements, a feat previously believed to be impossible. Overall, the newly discovered universality reported herein offers a powerful tool for predicting the impact of perturbations on kinetic processes, and for inferring underlying fluctuations from response measurements.

Title: Unsupervised Machine Learning Phase Classification for Falicov-Kimball Model
Authors: Lukáš Frk, Pavel Baláž, Elguja Archemashvili, Martin Žonda
Abstract: We apply various unsupervised machine learning methods for phase classification to investigate the finite-temperature phase diagram of the spinless Falicov-Kimball model in two dimensions. Using only particle occupation snapshots from Monte Carlo simulations as input, each technique, including a straightforward classification based on principal component analysis (PCA), successfully identifies the phase boundary between ordered and disordered phases, independent of the type of phase transition. Remarkably, these techniques also distinguish between the weakly localized and Anderson-localized regimes within the disordered phase, accurately identifying their crossover, which is a challenging task for standard methods. Among the machine learning approaches used, PCA based analysis outperforms more complex methods, such as neural network predictors and autoencoders. These results underscore the effectiveness of simple unsupervised techniques in examining phase transitions and electron localization in complex correlated systems.

Title: Orbital Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state in 2H-NbS2 flakes
Authors: Xinming Zhao, Guoliang Guo, Chengyu Yan, Noah F.Q. Yuan, Chuanwen Zhao, Huai Guan, Changshuai Lan, Yihang Li, Xin Liu, Shun Wang
Abstract: Symmetry breaking in a layered superconductor with Ising spin-orbit coupling has offered an opportunity to realize unconventional superconductivity. To be more specific, orbital Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, exhibiting layer-dependent finite-momentum pairing, may emerge in transition metal dichalcogenides materials (TMDC) in the presence of an in-plane magnetic field. Orbital FFLO state can be more robust against the magnetic field than the conventional superconducting state with zero-momentum pairing. This feature renders its potential in field-resilient superconducting functionality. Although, orbital FFLO state has been reported in NbSe2 and MoS2, it is not yet clear if orbital FFLO state can be extended to other TMDC superconductor. Here, we report the observation of orbital FFLO state in 2H-NbS2 flakes and its dependence on the thickness of flake. We conclude that the relatively weak interlayer coupling is instrumental in stabilizing orbital FFLO state at higher temperature with respect to the critical temperature and lower magnetic field with respect to paramagnetic limit in NbS2 in comparison to its NbSe2 counterpart.

Title: Efficient calculation of reactor noise via Ito-Langevin Process for correlated fluctuations
Authors: Guy Gabrieli, Yair Shokef, Izhar Neder
Abstract: We derive an Ito-Langevin stochastic process that captures the time-dependent deviation from Poisson behavior of the noise detected from a general heterogeneous sub-critical neutron system. Using the probability generating function for the actual physical process, we deduce the super-Poisson deviation of the covariance matrix of counts at the detector due to neutron multiplication upon fission. This leads to a general form that coincides with the second moment of an Ito process. This comparison facilitates the formulation of a corresponding effective Langevin equation, which potentially enables simulations that significantly reduce the computational resources required compared to direct simulation of the system's actual noise. This method could assist in designing sub-critical noise experiments for licensing new research reactors, for improving cross-section libraries and for non-destructive assays of spent fuel.

Title: Strong and weak wave turbulence regimes in Bose-Einstein condensates
Authors: Ying Zhu, Giorgio Krstulovic, Sergey Nazarenko
Abstract: When a turbulent Bose-Einstein condensate is driven out-of-equilibrium at a scale much smaller than the system size, nonlinear wave interactions transfer particles towards large scales in an inverse cascade process. In this work, we study numerically wave turbulence in a three-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate in forced and dissipated inverse cascade settings. We observe that when the forcing rate increases, thereby increasing the particle flux, the turbulence spectrum gradually transitions from the weak-wave Kolmogorov-Zakharov cascade to a critical balance state characterized by a range of scales with balanced linear and nonlinear dynamic timescales. Further forcing increases lead to a coherent condensate component superimposed with Bogoliubov-type acoustic turbulence. We then use our predictions and numerical data to formulate a new out-of-equilibrium equation of state for the 3D inverse cascade.

Title: Introduction of Additive Particle Theory for Path Integral Approaches
Authors: Ken-ichi Amano
Abstract: Path integral approaches have been used for boson and fermion systems. The path integral approach has been successful in the many-boson system. However, in the many-fermion system, the path integral approach is not feasible due to the sign problem. In this letter, I introduce additive particle (AP) theory in order to generate an approximation method that avoids the sign problem. The AP theory considers one electron as a string polymer, and virtual particles are added into the system. The AP theory is an approximation, but it is constructed to be able to generate the pair distribution function between free electrons and the density of states of the free electrons at an arbitrary temperature. Hence, when the electrostatic interactions are decreased, the AP theory converges to the free electron system. On the other hand, it deviates from the actual system when the electrostatic interactions are increased.

Title: A phenomenological magnetomechanical model for hysteresis loops
Authors: Alexej Perevertov
Abstract: In this work we propose a simple phenomenological model for magnetization curves of stressed samples. The effect of stress is introduced by scaling the arctangent function argument (magnetic field) proportionally to stress. The magnetization curve is modelled by one or two arctangent functions. Despite of its simplicity, the model gives a very good agreement with experimental curves, reproducing all stress-induced features usually observed on the magnetization curves including the common crossover point and constricted hysteresis loops. The popular effective field concept in this model is just a consequence of a simple scaling of the magnetic field. We show that the differential susceptibility is inversely proportional to the applied stress for all magnetization values. We propose to analyze the field and differential susceptibility as a function of magnetization in contrast to convenient M(H) loops.

Title: Quantum transport theory for unconventional magnets: Interplay of altermagnetism and p-wave magnetism with superconductivity
Authors: Tim Kokkeler, Ilya Tokatly, F. Sebastian Bergeret
Abstract: We present a quantum transport theory for generic magnetic metals, in which magnetism occurs predominantly due to exchange interactions, such as ferromagnets, antiferromagnets, altermagnets and p-wave magnets. Our theory is valid both for the normal and the superconducting state. We derive the effective low-energy action for each of these materials, where the spin space groups are used to determine the form of the tensor coefficients appearing in the action. The transport equations, which are obtained as the saddle point equations of this action, describe a wider range of phenomena than the usual quasiclassical equations. In ferromagnets, in addition to the usual exchange field and spin relaxation effects, we identify a spin-dependent renormalization of the diffusion coefficient, which provides a description of spinpolarized currents in both the normal and superconducting equal spin-triplet states. In the normal state, our equations provide a complete description of the spin-splitting effect in diffusive systems, recently predicted in ideal clean altermagnets. In the superconducting state, our equations predict a proximity induced magnetization, the appearance of a spontaneous magnetic moment in hybrid superconductor-altermagnet systems. The distribution and polarization direction of this magnetic moment depend on the symmetry of the structure, thus measurements of such polarization reveal the underlying microscopic symmetry of the altermagnet. Finally, for inversionsymmetry broken antiferromagnets, such as the p-wave magnet, we show that spin-galvanic effects which are distinguishable from the spin-galvanic effect induced by spin-orbit coupling only in the superconducting state. Besides these examples, our model applies to arbitrary magnetic systems, providing a complete theory for nonequilibrium transport in diffusive nonconventional magnets at arbitrary temperatures.

Title: Collinear Altermagnets and their Landau Theories
Authors: Hana Schiff, Paul McClarty, Jeffrey G. Rau, Judit Romhanyi
Abstract: Altermagnets exhibit spontaneously spin-split electronic bands in the zero spin-orbit coupling (SOC) limit arising from the presence of collinear compensated magnetic order. The distinctive magneto-crystalline symmetries of altermagnets ensure that these spin splittings have a characteristic anisotropy in crystal momentum space. These systems have attracted a great deal of interest due to their potential for applications in spintronics. In this paper, we provide a general Landau theory that encompasses all three-dimensional altermagnets where the magnetic order does not enlarge the unit cell. We identify all crystal structures that admit altermagnetism and then reduce these to a relatively small set of distinct possible Landau theories governing such systems. In the zero SOC limit, we determine the possible local multipolar orders that are tied to the spin splitting of the band structure. We make precise the connection between altermagnetism as defined at zero SOC ("ideal" altermagnets) and the effects of weak SOC. In particular, we examine which response functions allowed by symmetry when SOC is present are guaranteed by the spin-orbit free theory, and spell out the distinctive properties of altermagnets in comparison with conventional collinear antiferromagnets. Finally, we show how these ideas can be applied by considering a number of altermagnetic candidate materials.

Title: Elastic tensor-derived properties of composition-dependent disordered refractory binary alloys
Authors: Surya T. Bijjala, Susan R. Atlas, Pankaj Kumar
Abstract: The elastic tensor provides valuable insight into the mechanical behavior of a material with lattice strain, such as disordered binary alloys. Density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) based on density functional theory (DFT) provides a powerful mechanism for computing and probing the microscopic features of elastic tensor-related properties. Here we present results for the rigid-ion and relaxed-ion elastic tensors computed using DFPT, for a comprehensive set of structural refractory body-centered cubic (BCC) binary alloys of molybdenum (Mo), niobium (Nb), tantalum (Ta), and tungsten (W). For the first time, we have mapped the heterogeneity in elastic constants and shear modulus and associated relaxation fields at each lattice site by computing the force response internal strain tensor ($\Lambda$) and displacement response internal strain tensors ($\Gamma$). Derived properties -- the bulk modulus ($B$), shear modulus ($G$), Young's modulus ($E$), Poisson's ratio ($\nu$), Pugh's ratio ($B/G$), Cauchy pressure and elastic anisotropy -- are reported as a function of composition for all refractory binaries. The computed mechanical properties data for the refractory binary alloys at systematically-varied Mo, Nb, Ta, and W compositions are in excellent agreement with available experimental data.

Title: Thouless approach in transport in integrable and perturbed easy-axis Heisenberg chains
Authors: J. Pawlowski, M. Mierzejewski, P. Prelovsek
Abstract: We study transport in spin chains employing the Thouless approach based on the level sensitivity to the boundary conditions, $R$. Although spin transport in the integrable easy-axis XXZ model is diffusive, corresponding $R$ is much closer to ballistic chains than to chaotic diffusive systems. In the case of the grand canonical ensemble, this observation can be rigorously justified, while in the case of the canonical ensemble it can be demonstrated by numerical calculations. Integrability breaking perturbation (IBP) strongly reduces $R$ which reveals a pronounced minimum at the crossover from anomalous diffusive to normal dissipative transport. This minimum coincides with the onset of the universality of the random matrix theory. Results for various IBP suggest a discontinuous jump of the spin conductivity in the thermodynamic limit, and moreover that its value is proportional to the strength of the IBP.

Title: Anomalous topological edge modes in a periodically-driven trimer lattice
Authors: Mohammad Ghuneim, Raditya Weda Bomantara
Abstract: Periodically driven systems have a longstanding reputation for establishing rich topological phenomena beyond their static counterpart. In this work, we propose and investigate a periodically driven extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with three sites per unit cell, obtained by replacing the Pauli matrices with their $3\times 3$ counterparts. The system is found to support a number of edge modes over a range of parameter windows, some of which have no static counterparts. Among these edge modes, of particular interest are those which are pinned at a specific quasienergy value. Such quasienergy-fixed edge modes arise due to the interplay between topology and chiral symmetry, which are typically not expected in a three-band static model due to the presence of a bulk band at the only chiral-symmetric energy value, i.e., zero. In our time-periodic setting, another chiral-symmetric quasienergy value exists at half the driving frequency, which is not occupied by a bulk band and could then host chiral-symmetry-protected edge modes ($\pi$ modes). Finally, we verify the robustness of all edge modes against spatial disorder and briefly discuss the prospect of realizing our system in experiments.

Title: Double Microwave Shielding
Authors: Tijs Karman, Niccolò Bigagli, Weijun Yuan, Siwei Zhang, Ian Stevenson, Sebastian Will
Abstract: We develop double microwave shielding, which has recently enabled evaporative cooling to the first Bose-Einstein condensate of polar molecules [Bigagli et al., Nature 631, 289 (2024)]. Two microwave fields of different frequency and polarization are employed to effectively shield polar molecules from inelastic collisions and three-body recombination. Here, we describe in detail the theory of double microwave shielding. We demonstrate that double microwave shielding effectively suppresses two- and three-body losses. Simultaneously, dipolar interactions and the scattering length can be flexibly tuned, enabling comprehensive control over interactions in ultracold gases of polar molecules. We show that this approach works universally for a wide range of molecules. This opens the door to studying many-body physics with strongly interacting dipolar quantum matter.

Title: Nonflat bands and chiral symmetry in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene
Authors: Miguel Sánchez Sánchez, José González, Tobias Stauber
Abstract: In this work, we study an interacting tight-binding model of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG), with a twist angle of $1.05^\circ$. We derive effective theories based on a mean-field normal state at charge neutrality, thereby including the renormalizations coming from integrating out high-energy modes. In these theories, the flat bands display a sizable increase of the bandwidth, suggesting the renormalization of the magic angle. Additionally, the corresponding wavefunctions flow towards the limit of perfect particle-hole symmetry and sublattice polarization (the 'chiral' limit). We further represent the flat bands in the 'vortex Chern' basis and discuss the implications on the dynamics, regarding the 'flat' and 'chiral' symmetries of MATBG, as manifested in the symmetry-broken states at neutrality.

Title: Detecting Many-Body Scars from Fisher Zeros
Authors: Yuchen Meng, Songtai Lv, Yang Liu, Zefan Tan, Erhai Zhao, Haiyuan Zou
Abstract: The far-from-equilibrium dynamics of certain interacting quantum systems still defy precise understanding. One example is the so-called quantum many-body scars (QMBSs), where a set of energy eigenstates evade thermalization to give rise to long-lived oscillations. Despite the success of viewing scars from the perspectives of symmetry, commutant algebra and quasiparticles, it remains a challenge to elucidate the mechanism underlying all QMBS and to distinguish them from other forms of ergodicity breaking. In this work, we introduce an alternative route to detect and diagnose QMBS based on Fisher zeros, i.e., the patterns of zeros of the analytically continued partition function $Z$ on the complex $\beta$ (inverse temperature) plane. For systems with scars, a continuous line of Fisher zeros will appear off the imaginary $\beta$ axis and extend upward, separating the $\beta$-plane into regions with distinctive thermalization behaviors. This conjecture is motivated from interpreting the complex $Z$ as the return amplitude of the thermofield double state, and it is validated by analyzing two models with QMBS, the $\bar{P}X\bar{P}$ model and the Ising chain in external fields. These models also illustrate the key difference between QMBS and strong ergodicity breaking including their distinctive renormalization group flows on the complex $\beta$-plane. This ``statistical mechanics" approach places QMBS within the same framework of thermal and dynamical phase transitions. It has the advantage of spotting scars without exhaustively examining each individual quantum state.

Title: Almost Strong Zero Modes at Finite Temperature
Authors: Niklas Tausendpfund, Aditi Mitra, Matteo Rizzi
Abstract: Interacting fermionic chains exhibit extended regions of topological degeneracy of their ground states as a result of the presence of Majorana or parafermionic zero modes localized at the edges. In the opposite limit of infinite temperature, the corresponding non-integrable spin chains, obtained via generalized Jordan-Wigner mapping, are known to host so-called Almost Strong Zero Modes, which are long-lived with respect to any bulk excitations. Here, we study the fairly unexplored territory that bridges these two extreme cases of zero and infinite temperature. We blend two established techniques for states, the Lanczos series expansion and a tensor network ansatz, uplifting them to the level of operator algebra. This allows us to efficiently simulate large system sizes for arbitrarily long timescales and to extract the temperature-dependent decay rates. We observe that for the Kitaev-Hubbard model, the decay rate of the edge mode depends exponentially on the inverse temperature $\beta$, and on an effective energy scale $\Delta_{\rm eff}$ that is greater than the thermodynamic gap of the system $\Delta$.

Title: Electronic interactions in a vacancy-engineered honeycomb lattice: Transition from a nodal-line semimetal to a magnetic insulator
Authors: Andressa R. Medeiros-Silva, Mariana Malard, Rodrigo G. Pereira, Thereza Paiva
Abstract: Nodal-line semimetals (NLSMs) harbor a variety of novel physical properties owing to the particularities of the band degeneracies that characterize the spectrum of these materials. In symmetry-enforced NLSMs, band degeneracies, being imposed by symmetries, are robust to arbitrarily strong perturbations that preserve the symmetries. We investigate the effects of electron-electron interactions on a recently proposed vacancy-engineered NLSM known as holey graphene. Using mean-field calculations and quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we show that the Hubbard model on the depleted holey-graphene lattice at half-filling exhibits a transition from a NLSM to an insulating antiferromagnetic phase for an arbitrarily weak repulsive interaction $U$. In contrast to the semi-metal-insulator transition in the pristine honeycomb lattice, which occurs at a finite critical value of $U$, in the depleted lattice, the transition at $U=0$ is associated with a van Hove singularity arising from the crossing of accidental nodal lines and those enforced by symmetry. We also employ linear spin wave theory (LSWT) to the effective Heisenberg model in the strong-coupling limit and obtain the global antiferromagnetic order parameter $m_{\rm AFM} \approx 0.146$. The order parameters from both QMC and LSWT agree quantitatively. Our findings indicate that vacancy engineering offers an effective way to tailor the magnetic properties of quantum materials.

Title: Weighted Point Configurations with Hyperuniformity: An Ecological Example and Models
Authors: Ayana Ezoe, Makoto Katori, Tomoyuki Shirai
Abstract: Random point configurations are said to be in hyperuniform states, if density fluctuations are anomalously suppressed in large-scale. Typical examples are found in Coulomb gas systems in two dimensions especially called log-gases in random matrix theory, in which points are repulsively correlated by long-range potentials. In infertile lands like deserts continuous survival competitions for water and nutrition will cause long-ranged repulsive interactions among plants. We have prepared digital data of spatial configurations of center-of-masses for bushes weighted by bush sizes which we call masses. Data analysis shows that such ecological point configurations do not show hyperuniformity as unmarked point processes, but are in hyperuniform states as marked point processes in which mass distributions are taken into account. We propose the non-equilibrium statistical-mechanics models to generate marked point processes having hyperuniformity, in which iterations of random thinning of points and coalescing of masses transform initial uncorrelated point processes into non-trivial point processes with hyperuniformity. Combination of data analysis and computer simulations shows the importance of strong correlations in probability law between spatial point configurations and mass distributions of individual points to realize hyperuniform marked point processes.

Abstract: The emerging field of valleytronics harnesses the valley degree of freedom of electrons, akin to how electronic and spintronic devices utilize the charge and spin degrees of freedom of electrons respectively. The engineering of valleytronic devices typically relies on the coupling between valley and other degrees of freedom such as spin, giving rise to valley-spintronics where an external magnetic field manipulates the information stored in valleys. Here, the valley gapless semiconductor is proposed as a potential electrically controlled valleytronic platform because the valley degree of freedom is coupled to the carrier type, i.e., electrons and holes. The valley degree of freedom can be electrically controlled by tuning the carrier type via the device gate voltage. We demonstrate the proposal for realizing a valley gapless semiconductor in the honeycomb lattice with the Haldane and modified Haldane models. The system's valley-carrier coupling is further studied for its transport properties in an all-electrically controlled valley filter device setting. Our work highlights the significance of the valley gapless semiconductor for valleytronic devices.

Title: SymmCD: Symmetry-Preserving Crystal Generation with Diffusion Models
Authors: Daniel Levy, Siba Smarak Panigrahi, Sékou-Oumar Kaba, Qiang Zhu, Kin Long Kelvin Lee, Mikhail Galkin, Santiago Miret, Siamak Ravanbakhsh
Abstract: Generating novel crystalline materials has the potential to lead to advancements in fields such as electronics, energy storage, and catalysis. The defining characteristic of crystals is their symmetry, which plays a central role in determining their physical properties. However, existing crystal generation methods either fail to generate materials that display the symmetries of real-world crystals, or simply replicate the symmetry information from examples in a database. To address this limitation, we propose SymmCD, a novel diffusion-based generative model that explicitly incorporates crystallographic symmetry into the generative process. We decompose crystals into two components and learn their joint distribution through diffusion: 1) the asymmetric unit, the smallest subset of the crystal which can generate the whole crystal through symmetry transformations, and; 2) the symmetry transformations needed to be applied to each atom in the asymmetric unit. We also use a novel and interpretable representation for these transformations, enabling generalization across different crystallographic symmetry groups. We showcase the competitive performance of SymmCD on a subset of the Materials Project, obtaining diverse and valid crystals with realistic symmetries and predicted properties.

Title: Classification of Gapped Domain Walls of Topological Orders in 2+1 dimensions: A Levin-Wen Model Realization
Authors: Yanyan Chen, Siyuan Wang, Yu Zhao, Yuting Hu, Yidun Wan
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel systematic construction of gapped domain walls (GDWs) within the Levin-Wen (LW) model. By gluing two LW models along their open sides in a compatible way, we achieve a complete GDW classification by subsets of bulk input data, which encompass the classifications in terms of bimodule categories. A generalized bimodule structure is introduced to capture domain-wall excitations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that folding along any GDW yields a gapped boundary (GB) described by a Frobenius algebra of the input UFC for the folded model, thus bridging our GDW classification and the GB classification in \cite{hu2018boundary}.

Title: Phase space contraction rate for classical mixed states
Authors: Mohamed Sahbani, Swetamber Das, Jason R. Green
Abstract: Physical systems with non-reciprocal or dissipative forces evolve according to a generalization of Liouville's equation that accounts for the expansion and contraction of phase space volume. Here, we connect geometric descriptions of these non-Hamiltonian dynamics to a recently established classical density matrix theory. In this theory, the evolution of a ``maximally mixed'' classical density matrix is related to the well-known phase space contraction rate that, when ensemble averaged, is the rate of entropy exchange with the surroundings. Here, we extend the definition of mixed states to include statistical and mechanical components, describing both the deformations of local phase space regions and the evolution of ensembles within them. As a result, the equation of motion for this mixed state represents the rate of contraction for an ensemble of dissipative trajectories. Recognizing this density matrix as a covariance matrix, its contraction rate is another measure of entropy flow characterizing nonequilibrium steady states.

Title: Memorization and Generalization in Generative Diffusion under the Manifold Hypothesis
Authors: Beatrice Achilli, Luca Ambrogioni, Carlo Lucibello, Marc Mézard, Enrico Ventura
Abstract: We study the memorization and generalization capabilities of Diffusion Models (DMs) when data lies on a structured latent manifold. Specifically, we consider a set of $P$ data points in $N$ dimensions confined to a latent subspace of dimension $D = \alpha_D N$, following the Hidden Manifold Model (HMM). We analyze the reverse diffusion process using the empirical score function as a proxy, and characterize it in the high-dimensional limit $P = \exp(\alpha N)$, $N \gg 1$, by exploiting a connection with the Random Energy Model (REM). We show that a characteristic time $t_o$ marks the emergence of traps in the time-dependent potential, which however do not affect typical trajectories. The size of their basins of attraction is computed at all times. We derive the collapse time $t_c < t_o$, at which trajectories fall into the basin of a training point, signaling memorization. An explicit formula for $t_c$ as a function of $P$ and $\alpha_D$ shows that the curse of dimensionality is avoided for structured data ($\alpha_D \ll 1$), even with nonlinear manifolds. We also prove that collapse corresponds to the condensation transition in the REM. Generalization is quantified via the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the exact distribution and the reverse one at time $t$. We find a distinct time $t_g < t_c < t_o$ minimizing this divergence. Surprisingly, the best generalization occurs inside the memorization phase. We conclude that generalization in DMs improves with data structure, as $t_g \to 0$ faster than $t_c$ when $\alpha_D \to 0$.

Title: Finite-rate quench in disordered Chern and $Z_2$ topological insulators
Authors: Sheng-Nan Du, Zhao Liu
Abstract: We study the quantum quench of a finite rate across topological quantum transitions in two-dimensional Chern and $Z_2$ topological insulators. We choose the representative Haldane model and the Kane-Mele model to investigate the behavior of excitation density generated by the quench and the impact of disorder on it. For the Haldane model, as long as the spectral gap is not closed by disorder, we find the excitation density at the end of the quench obeys the power-law decay with decreasing quench rate, and the power is consistent with the prediction of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. By contrast, the Kibble-Zurek scaling of excitation density is absent in the Kane-Mele model once disorder is switched on, which we attribute to the emergence of a disorder-induced gapless region. In particular, the anti-Kibble-Zurek behavior of excitation density, namely, larger excitation density at slower quench, is observed at suitable model parameters. Moreover, we demonstrate that particle's onsite occupation can be used as a local measurable quantity to probe the breakdown of adiabatic evolution. The difference of onsite occupation between the time-evolved state and instantaneous ground state at the end of the quench can successfully capture the key features of excitation density for both the Haldane and Kane-Mele models under periodic and more realistic open boundary conditions, thus facilitating the experimental characterization of the quench dynamics in these models.

Title: Electrostatics in semiconducting devices I : The Pure Electrostatics Self Consistent Approximation
Authors: A. Lacerda-Santos, Xavier Waintal
Abstract: In quantum nanoelectronics devices, the electrostatic energy is the largest energy scale at play and, to a large extend, it determines the charge distribution inside the devices. Here, we introduce the Pure Electrostatic Self consistent Approximation (PESCA) that provides a minimum model that describes how to include a semiconductor in an electrostatic calculation to properly account for both screening and partial depletion due to e.g. field effect. We show how PESCA may be used to reconstruct the charge distribution from the measurement of pinch-off phase diagrams in the gate voltages space. PESCA can also be extended to account for magnetic field and calculate the edge reconstruction in the quantum Hall regime. The validity of PESCA is controlled by a small parameter $\kappa = C_g/C_q$, the ratio of the geometrical capacitance to the quantum capacitance, which is, in many common situations, of the order of 1%, making PESCA a quantitative technique for the calculation of the charge distribution inside devices.

Title: Generative diffusion for perceptron problems: statistical physics analysis and efficient algorithms
Authors: Elizaveta Demyanenko, Davide Straziota, Carlo Baldassi, Carlo Lucibello
Abstract: We consider random instances of non-convex perceptron problems in the high-dimensional limit of a large number of examples $M$ and weights $N$, with finite load $\alpha = M/N$. We develop a formalism based on replica theory to predict the fundamental limits of efficiently sampling the solution space using generative diffusion algorithms, conjectured to be saturated when the score function is provided by Approximate Message Passing. For the spherical perceptron with negative margin $\kappa$, we find that the uniform distribution over solutions can be efficiently sampled in most of the Replica Symmetric region of the $\alpha-\kappa$ plane. In contrast, for binary weights, sampling from the uniform distribution remains intractable. A theoretical analysis of this obstruction leads us to identify a potential $U(s) = -\log(s)$, under which the corresponding tilted distribution becomes efficiently samplable via diffusion. Moreover, we show numerically that an annealing procedure over the shape of this potential yields a fast and robust Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm for sampling the solution space of the binary perceptron.

Title: Effects of the three-dimensional interplanar coupling on the centrosymmetric skyrmion crystal formation in the frustrated stacked-triangular Heisenberg model
Authors: R. Osamura, K. Aoyama, K. Mitsumoto, H. Kawamura
Abstract: Effects of the three-dimensional (3D) interplanar coupling on centrosymmetric skyrmion crystal (SkX) formation is investigated via extensive Monte Carlo simulations on the frustrated isotropic Heisenberg model on a stacked-triangular lattice in both cases of the ferromagnetic (F) and the antiferromagnetic (AF) nearest-neighbor interplanar coupling $J_{1c}$. The SkX phase is stabilized at finite fields and at finite temperatures for both F and AF $J_{1c}$, although it is destabilized by modestly weak AF $J_{1c}$. The magnetic phase diagram of the 3D short-range model is more or less similar to those of the 2D short-range model and of the 2D long-range RKKY model. We find that an intriguing phenomenon of replica-symmetry breaking, popular in glass physics and recently identified in the SkX phase of the 3D long-range RKKY model [K. Mitsumoto and H. Kawamura, Phys. Rev. B {\bf 104}, 184432 (2021)], does not arise in the 3D short-range model, suggesting that the long-range nature of interaction might be necessary to realize the RSB in centrosymmetric SkX state.

Title: Shortcut to spin dynamics for quantum mixtures
Authors: Pablo Capuzzi, Zehra Akdeniz, Patrizia Vignolo
Abstract: The study of the long-time dynamics of quantum systems can be a real challenge, especially in systems like ultracold gases, where the required timescales may be longer than the lifetime of the system itself. In this work, we show that it is possible to access the long-time dynamics of a strongly repulsive atomic gas mixture in shorter times. The shortcut-to-dynamics protocol that we propose does not modify the fate of the observables, but effectively jumps ahead in time without changing the system's inherent evolution. Just like the next-chapter button in a movie player that allows to quickly reach the part of the movie one wants to watch, it is a leap into the future.

Title: Abundance of spin liquids in the $S=1$ bilinear-biquadratic model on the pyrochlore lattice, and its application to $\mathrm{NaCaNi}_2\mathrm{F}_7$
Authors: Rico Pohle, Nic Shannon
Abstract: Long considered the ''poor cousins'' of spin-1/2 systems, magnets built of spin-1 moments have recently come to fore as a rich source of novel phases of matter. Here we explore the phases which arise in a spin-1 magnet on the pyrochlore lattice, once biquadratic interactions are taken into account. Using a combination of variational and Monte Carlo techniques, built around the exact treatment of spin-1 at the level of a single site, we uncover seven distinct spin liquid phases. Dynamical calculations for one of these spin liquids are shown to be in good agreement with inelastic neutron scattering on the spin-1 pyrochlore $\mathrm{NaCaNi}_2\mathrm{F}_7$. These results suggest that the range of spin liquid phases found in spin-1 pyrochlores may be even richer than in materials with (pseudo-)spin-1/2 moments.

Title: A theory of quasiballistic spin transport
Authors: Jeffrey Z. Song, Hyunsoo Ha, Wen Wei Ho, Vir B. Bulchandani
Abstract: A recent work [Mierzejewski et al., Phys. Rev. B 107, 045134 (2023)] observed "quasiballistic spin transport" - long-lived and transiently ballistic modes of the magnetization density - in numerical simulations of infinite-temperature XXZ chains with power-law exchange interactions. We develop an analytical theory of such quasiballistic spin transport. Previous work found that this effect was maximized along a specific locus in the space of model parameters, which interpolated smoothly between the integrable Haldane-Shastry and XX models and whose shape was estimated from numerics. We obtain an analytical estimate for the lifetime of the spin current and show that it has a unique maximum along a different locus, which interpolates more gradually between the two integrable points. We further rule out the existence of a conserved two-body operator that protects ballistic spin transport away from these integrable points by proving that a corresponding functional equation has no solutions. We discuss connections between our approach and an integrability-transport conjecture for spin.

Title: Lanczos-Pascal approach to correlation functions in chaotic quantum systems
Authors: Merlin Füllgraf, Jiaozi Wang, Robin Steinigeweg, Jochen Gemmer
Abstract: We suggest a method to compute approximations to temporal correlation functions of few-body observables in chaotic many-body systems in the thermodynamic limit based on the respective Lanczos coefficients. Given the knowledge of these Lanczos coefficients, the method is very cheap. Usually accuracy increases with more Lanczos coefficients taken into account, however, we numerically find and analytically argue that the convergence is rather quick, if the Lanczos coefficients exhibit a smoothly increasing structure. For pertinent examples we compare with data from dynamical typicality computations for large but finite systems and find good agreement if few Lanczos coefficients are taken into account. From the method it is evident that in these cases the correlation functions are well described by a low number of damped oscillations.

Title: Topological effect on order-disorder transitions in U(1) sigma models
Authors: Ryuichi Shindou, Pengwei Zhao
Abstract: U(1) non-linear sigma model (NLSM) with a one-dimensional (1D) Berry phase is studied by a renormalization group theory. Order-disorder transition in U(1) NLSMs in $D \!\ (\ge 2)$-dimensional space ($d+1$-dimensional spacetime; $d\ge 1$) is instigated by the proliferation of vortex excitations, where the 1D Berry phase term confers finite phase factors upon those vortex excitations that have finite projection in a subspace complementary to a topological direction with the 1D Berry phase. A destructive interference effect caused by the phase factors may help to develop an intermediate quasi-disorder phase between ordered and disorder phases, which has a divergent order-parameter correlation length along the topological direction, and a finite correlation length along the other directions. In order to explore such a possibility in $D=3$, we develop a perturbative renormalization group theory of a 3D model of vortex loops, in which loop segments interact via a $1/r$ Coulomb interaction. We derive renormalization group (RG) equations among vortex-loop fugacity, Berry phase term, and the Coulomb potential. Approximate analyses of the RG equations show that near an order-disorder transition point, vortex loops are anomalously elongated along the topological direction. Utilizing a duality mapping to a lattice model of a type-II superconductor under a magnetic field, we also argue that a global phase diagram of the 3D U(1) sigma model with 1D Berry phase must have the quasi-disorder phase between ordered and disorder phases.

Title: Visualization of spin-splitter effect in altermagnets via non-equilibrium Green functions on a lattice
Authors: Karl Bergson Hallberg, Erik Wegner Hodt, Jacob Linder
Abstract: When a charge current is injected into an altermagnet along a suitable crystallographic direction, a transverse spin current can be generated. This so-called spin-splitter effect does not rely on spin-orbit coupling, and is thus distinct from the spin Hall effect. The spin-splitter effect was predicted by \textit{ab initio} calculations and has been experimentally confirmed. To utilize the spin-splitter effect for practical purposes in spintronic devices, it is important to understand (i) how the system parameters affect the transverse spin current, such as filling fraction, altermagnetic strength, interface parameters, spin-orbit interactions, and impurities and (ii) determine the properties of any associated spin accumulation, which is the measurable quantity. Here, we determine the answer to these questions and provide a real-space visualization of the spin flow and spin accumulation due to the spin-splitter effect. We utilize the non-equilibrium Keldysh Green function method on a 2D square lattice to this end. We find that the presence of edges induces oscillations in the spin accumulation and strongly modify the signal for small samples. At half-filling, the spin accumulation acquires an anomalous pattern and the spin-splitter effect vanishes. We prove analytically that this follows from a combined particle-hole and spin-reversal symmetry of the model used for the altermagnetic state. Increasing the altermagnetic strength leads to a larger spin accumulation, as expected. However, when adding Rashba spin-orbit interaction, providing an additional spin Hall signal, we find that the spin accumulation is not simply the sum of the spin Hall and spin-splitter contribution. Finally, we show that the spin-splitter effect is robust towards moderate impurity scattering with a potential of the same order as the hopping parameter, which facilitates its observation in real materials.

Title: Excitability and travelling waves in renewable active matter
Authors: M. Abhishek, Ankit Dhanuka, Deb Sankar Banerjee, Madan Rao
Abstract: Activity and renewability are distinctive features of living matter, and constitute a new class of materials that we term renewable active matter. A striking example is the cell cytoskeleton, where myosin filaments bind to the actin meshwork, apply contractile stresses and undergo continual stress/strain dependent turnover, thus acting as both force generators and sensors. As a consequence of nonreciprocity, arising from the independence of action and response, such living matter exhibits unusual mechanical properties like, segregation without attraction, fragility and force chains. Here we show that the interplay between activity and turnover gives rise to mechanical excitability in the form of travelling waves and pulses, and spatiotemporal chaos. We provide a systematic study of the nucleation, movement and shape of the travelling pulse, and present a boundary layer analysis to establish the existence of homoclinic orbits. Our analytical results are supported by detailed numerical analysis of the governing partial differential equations. This study has implications for the observed mechanical excitability in a variety of cellular contexts such as in isolated adherent cells and confluent cells within tissues.

Title: SEMIDV: A Compact Semiconductor Device Simulator with Quantum Effects
Authors: Chien-Ting Tung
Abstract: In this paper, I present SEMIDV - a compact semiconductor device simulator incorporating quantum effects. SEMIDV solves the Poisson-Drift-Diffusion equations for semiconductor devices and provides a user-friendly Python interface for scripting and data analysis. Localization landscape theory is introduced to provide quantum corrections to the Drift-Diffusion equation. This theory directly solves the ground state of the Schrodinger equation without further approximation, offering an efficient solution for quantum effect modeling. Additionally, a compact mobility model considering ballistic transport is developed to capture the ballistic length dependence of mobility and the velocity overshoot effect in short-channel devices. Finally, a study on a nanosheet FET using SEMIDV is conducted. I analyze the electrical characteristics of a state-of-the-art GAA/RibbonFET with a 6 nm gate length and discuss the effects of velocity overshoot and quantum confinement on currents and capacitances. A design for an ultra-short-channel transistor with a gate length down to 4.5 nm with a Vdd = 0.45 V is proposed to push the boundaries of integrated circuit technology further.

Title: Chiral vortex-line liquid of three-dimensional interacting Bose systems with moat dispersion
Authors: Bahar Jafari-Zadeh, Chenan Wei, Tigran A. Sedrakyan
Abstract: We formulate and investigate a novel quantum state, the Chiral Vortex-Line Liquid (CVLL), emerging in three-dimensional interacting Bose systems exhibiting moat-band dispersions. Such dispersions feature extensive degeneracy along closed manifolds in momentum space, significantly amplifying quantum fluctuations that suppress conventional Bose-Einstein condensation. By extending the two-dimensional Chern-Simons (CS) flux-attachment transformation to three dimensions through a combination of planar CS phases and Jordan-Wigner fermionization along vortex lines, we construct the CVLL state, characterized by preserved rotational $SO(2)$ symmetry, broken time-reversal symmetry, nontrivial vortex-line excitations, and topological gapless edge surface states. We construct the associated field theory in a curved spatial geometry and analyze the low-energy effective theory of the CVLL state, demonstrating its topological nature. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we numerically determine the scaling of the chemical potential of the CVLL ground state as a function of boson density for interacting bosons in a cylindrical moat-band geometry and demonstrate that the CVLL phase energetically outcompetes traditional condensate phases at low densities, highlighting its relevance to experimental platforms including frustrated quantum magnets, ultracold atomic gases, the physics of rotons in $^4$He, and moat regimes in heavy-ion collisions.

Title: Chiral magnetic excitations and domain textures of g-wave altermagnets
Authors: Volodymyr P. Kravchuk, Kostiantyn V. Yershov, Jorge I. Facio, Yaqian Guo, Oleg Janson, Olena Gomonay, Jairo Sinova, Jeroen van den Brink
Abstract: Altermagnets (AMs) constitute a novel class of spin-compensated materials in which opposite-spin sublattices are connected by a crystal rotation, causing their electronic iso-energy surfaces to be spin-split. While cubic and tetragonal crystal symmetries tend to produce AMs in which the splitting of electronic iso-energy surfaces has $d$-wave symmetry, hexagonal AMs, such as CrSb and MnTe, are $g$-wave AMs. Here we investigate the purely magnetic modes and spin-textures of $g$-wave AMs and show that they are drastically different for easy-axial (CrSb) and easy-planar (MnTe) materials. We show that in CrSb the splitting of the chiral magnon branches possesses $g$-wave symmetry, with each branch carrying a fixed momentum-independent magnetic moment. The altermagnetic splitting is not affected by the easy-axial anisotropy and is the same as that in the nonrelativistic limit. The magnon splitting of MnTe, however, does not strictly possess $g$-wave symmetry due to its easy-planar anisotropy. Instead, the magnetic moment of each branch becomes momentum-dependent, with a distribution that is of $g$-wave symmetry. To generalize the concept of the altermagnetic splitting beyond the nonrelativistic limit, we introduce alternative, directly observable splitting parameter which comprises both the magnon eigenenergy and its magnetic moment and possesses the $g$-wave symmetry in both easy-axial and easy-planar cases. The associated altermagnetic domain walls in easy-axial CrSb possess a net magnetization with an amplitude that depends on their orientation.

Title: Symphony of Symmetry Selective Resonances in Fe-MgO-ZnO-MgO-Fe
Authors: Sabarna Chakraborti, Arti Kashyap, Abhishek Sharma
Abstract: We propose the perspective of symmetry-selective resonance of the $\Delta_1$ states in the Fe/MgO/ZnO/MgO/Fe heterostructures, offering a broad landscape to design magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) that yield a towering tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) up to $3.5\times10^4\%$ with the resistance area (RA) product dipping down to a minimum of $0.05~\Omega\cdot\mu \text{m}^2$, while maintaining a nearly perfect (99\%) spin polarization. Our predictions are based on the self-consistent coupling of the non-equilibrium Green's function with density functional theory. We also present the charge current, spin current, and TMR with applied voltage of the Fe/MgO(3-layer)/ZnO(3-layer)/MgO(3-layer)/Fe MTJ, which offers a superior performance triad of TMR ($1.3\times10^4\%$), RA ($0.45~\Omega\cdot\mu \text{m}^2$), and spin polarization (99\%) over a regular Fe/MgO(6-layer)/Fe based MTJ (TMR $\approx 3.4\times10^3\%$, RA $\approx 22~\Omega\cdot\mu \text{m}^2$). We provide a comprehensive insight integrating the transmission eigenchannel, spectral density, and the band structure of the Fe contacts to establish the role of symmetry-selective resonance in the Fe/MgO/ZnO/MgO/Fe MTJ.

Title: XDiag: Exact Diagonalization for Quantum Many-Body Systems
Authors: Alexander Wietek, Luke Staszewski, Martin Ulaga, Paul L. Ebert, Hannes Karlsson, Siddhartha Sarkar, Henry Shackleton, Aritra Sinha, Rafael D. Soares
Abstract: Exact diagonalization (ED) is a cornerstone technique in quantum many-body physics, enabling precise solutions to the Schrödinger equation for interacting quantum systems. Despite its utility in studying ground states, excited states, and dynamical behaviors, the exponential growth of the Hilbert space with system size presents significant computational challenges. We introduce XDiag, an open-source software package designed to combine advanced and efficient algorithms for ED with and without symmetry-adapted bases with user-friendly interfaces. Implemented in C++ for computational efficiency and wrapped in Julia for ease of use, XDiag provides a comprehensive toolkit for ED calculations. Key features of XDiag include the first publicly accessible implementation of sublattice coding algorithms for large-scale spin system diagonalizations, efficient Lin table algorithms for symmetry lookups, and random-hashing techniques for distributed memory parallelization. The library supports various Hilbert space types (e.g., spin-1/2, electron, and t-J models), facilitates symmetry-adapted block calculations, and automates symmetry considerations. The package is complemented by extensive documentation, a user guide, reproducible benchmarks demonstrating near-linear scaling on thousands of CPU cores, and over 20 examples covering ground-state calculations, spectral functions, time evolution, and thermal states. By integrating high-performance computing with accessible scripting capabilities, XDiag allows researchers to perform state-of-the-art ED simulations and explore quantum many-body phenomena with unprecedented flexibility and efficiency.

Title: Soft superconductivity in covalent bismuth dihydride BiH$_2$ under extreme conditions
Authors: Jianning Guo, Dmitrii V. Semenok, Ivan A. Troyan, Di Zhou, Yulong Wang, Yuzhi Chen, Su Chen, Kexin Zhang, Xinyue Wu, Sven Luther, Toni Helm, Andrey V Sadakov, Alexey S. Usoltsev, Leonid A Morgun, Vladimir M Pudalov, Viktor V Struzhkin, Xiaoli Huang
Abstract: Strong magnetic fields provide a unique environment for investigating the fundamental properties of superconducting materials, especially for hydride superconductors with large upper critical fields. Following this idea, we have investigated the effect of pulsed magnetic fields on covalent bismuth dihydride (BiH$_2$), successfully synthesized under pressure up to 211 GPa. The electrical resistance measurements indicate that the superconducting phase $P2_1/m$-BiH$_2$ exhibits the highest superconducting critical temperature ($T_c$) of 70 K among MH$_2$-type hydride apart from H$_2$S. The electrical transport experiments under both pulsed (up to 50 T) and steady magnetic fields (up to 16 T) for $P2_1/m$- and $C2/m$-BiH$_2$ indicate that the upper critical fields $\mu_0 H_{c2}(0)$ = 12--16 T are unusually low, much lower than that of clathrate-like metal polyhydrides with similar $T_c$. This is due to the unexpectedly high Fermi velocity in BiH$_2$, about $1.1 \times 10^6$ m/s, which allows to classify BiH$_2$ as a 'soft' molecular superconducting hydride with relatively weak vortex pinning. Measurements of the current-voltage characteristics in the pulsed mode make it possible to experimentally establish the temperature dependence of the critical current density (the maximum $J_c(0) = 10$ kA/mm$^2$), which indicates the presence of two $s$-wave superconducting gaps in BiH$_2$ at 172--176 GPa: $\Delta_L(0) = 6.9 \pm 1.2$ meV and $\Delta_S(0) \sim 1.5$ meV.

Title: Triplet Excitons Reconcile Charge Generation and Recombination in Low-Offset Organic Solar Cells: Efficiency Limits from a 5-State Model
Authors: Jonathan L. Langentepe-Kong, Manasi Pranav, Safa Shoaee, Dieter Neher
Abstract: The power conversion efficiency of organic solar cells has recently improved beyond 20%. The active layers of these devices comprise of at least two organic semiconductors, forming a type II heterojunction. Hereby, the device performance is determined by the kinetic interplay of various species, including localized excitons, charge transfer states as well as charge-separated states. However, a model which describes all relevant photovoltaic measures has yet to be developed. Herein, we present a comprehensive 5-state rate model which includes both singlet and triplet charge transfer states and takes into account the formation, re-splitting and decay of the local triplet state, parametric in the respective energy offset. We show that this model not only describes key device properties such as charge generation efficiency, photoluminescence, electroluminescence and Langevin reduction factor simultaneously but also elucidate how these vary across material combinations based on the D:A interfacial energy offset alone. We find that the electroluminescence and Langevin reduction factor depend strongly on the triplet properties and that the triplet decay becomes the dominant charge recombination pathway for systems with moderate offset, in full agreement to previous experimental results. Validation against literature data demonstrates the model's ability to predict the device efficiency accurately. Subsequently, we identify material combinations with singlet exciton to charge transfer state energetic offset of roughly 150meV as particularly promising. Our model explains further why recent certified efficiency records for binary blends remain at ca. 20% if no further means to improve photon and charge carrier harvesting are taken.

Title: Sliding Friction of Hard Sliders on Rubber: Theory and Experiment
Authors: R. Xu, B.N.J. Persson
Abstract: We present a study of sliding friction for rigid triangular steel sliders on soft rubber substrates under both lubricated and dry conditions. For rubber surfaces lubricated with a thin film of silicone oil, the measured sliding friction at room temperature agrees well with theoretical predictions obtained from a viscoelastic model originally developed for rolling friction. On the lubricated surface, the sliding friction is primarily due to bulk viscoelastic energy dissipation in the rubber. The model, which includes strain-dependent softening of the rubber modulus, accurately predicts the experimental friction curves. At lower temperatures ($T = -20^\circ {\rm C}$ and $-40^\circ {\rm C}$), the measured friction exceeds the theoretical prediction. We attribute this increase to penetration of the lubricant film by surface asperities, leading to a larger adhesive contribution. For dry surfaces, the adhesive contribution becomes dominant. By subtracting the viscoelastic component inferred from the lubricated case, we estimate the interfacial frictional shear stress. This shear stress increases approximately linearly with the logarithm of the sliding speed, consistent with stress-augmented thermal activation mechanisms.

Title: Majorana vortex phases in time-reversal invariant higher-order topological insulators and topologically trivial insulators
Authors: Xun-Jiang Luo
Abstract: Majorana vortex phases have been extensively studied in topological materials with conventional superconducting pairing. Inspired by recent experimental progress in realizing time-reversal invariant higher-order topological insulators (THOTIs) and inducing superconducting proximity effects, we investigate Majorana vortex phases in these systems. We construct THOTIs as two copies of a topological insulator (TI) with time-reversal symmetry-preserving mass terms that anisotropically gap the surface states. We find that these mass terms have a negligible impact on the vortex phase transitions of double TIs when treated as perturbations, and no additional topological phase transitions are induced. Consequently, $\mathbb{Z}_2$-protected Majorana vortex end modes (MVEMs) emerge when the chemical potential lies between the critical chemical potentials $\mu_c^{(1)}$ and $\mu_c^{(2)}$ of the two TI vortex phase transitions. We demonstrate this behavior across multiple THOTI models, including rotational symmetry-protected THOTI, inversion symmetry-protected THOTI, rotational and inversion symmetries-protected THOTI bismuth, and extrinsic THOTI. Remarkably, MVEMs persist even when all surfaces are gapped with the same sign, rendering the system topologically trivial in both first- and second-order classifications. Our findings establish that MVEMs can be realized in time-reversal invariant systems with fully gapped surfaces, encompassing both topologically nontrivial and trivial insulators, thus significantly broadening the solid state material platforms for hosting Majorana vortex phases.

Title: Strong Topological Trivialization of Multi-Species Spherical Spin Glasses
Authors: Brice Huang, Mark Sellke
Abstract: We study the landscapes of multi-species spherical spin glasses. Our results determine the phase boundary for annealed trivialization of the number of critical points, and establish its equivalence with a quenched strong topological trivialization property. Namely in the "trivial" regime, the number of critical points is constant, all are well-conditioned, and all approximate critical points are close to a true critical point. As a consequence, we deduce that Langevin dynamics at sufficiently low temperature has logarithmic mixing time. Our approach begins with the Kac--Rice formula. We characterize the annealed trivialization phase by explicitly solving a suitable multi-dimensional variational problem, obtained by simplifying certain asymptotic determinant formulas from (Ben Arous--Bourgade--McKenna 2023, McKenna 2024). To obtain more precise quenched results, we develop general purpose techniques to avoid sub-exponential correction factors and show non-existence of approximate critical points. Many of the results are new even in the 1-species case.

Title: The Fate of Entanglement
Authors: Gilles Parez, William Witczak-Krempa
Abstract: Quantum entanglement manifests itself in non-local correlations between the constituents of a system. In its simplest realization, a measurement on one subsystem is affected by a prior measurement on its partner, irrespective of their separation. For multiple parties, purely collective types of entanglement exist but their detection, even theoretically, remains an outstanding open question. Here, we argue that all forms of multipartite entanglement entirely disappear during the typical evolution of a physical state as it heats up, evolves in time in a large family of dynamical protocols, or as its parts become separated. We focus on the generic case where the system interacts with an environment. These results mainly follow from the geometry of the entanglement-free continent in the space of physical states, and hold in great generality. We illustrate these phenomena with a frustrated molecular quantum magnet in and out of equilibrium, and a quantum spin chain. In contrast, if the particles are fermions, such as electrons, another notion of entanglement exists that protects bipartite quantum correlations. However, genuinely collective fermionic entanglement disappears during typical evolution, thus sharing the same fate as in bosonic systems. These findings provide fundamental knowledge about the structure of entanglement in quantum matter and architectures, paving the way for its manipulation.

Title: Protein-DNA Co-condensation is Prewetting to a Collapsed Polymer
Authors: Mason N. Rouches, Benjamin B. Machta
Abstract: The three-dimensional organization of chromatin is thought to play an important role in controlling gene expression. Specificity in expression is achieved through the interaction of transcription factors and other nuclear proteins with particular sequences of DNA. At unphysiological concentrations many of these nuclear proteins can phase-separate in the absence of DNA, and it has been hypothesized that, in vivo, the thermodynamic forces driving these phases help determine chromosomal organization. However it is unclear how DNA, itself a long polymer subject to configurational transitions, interacts with three-dimensional protein phases. Here we show that a long compressible polymer can be coupled to interacting protein mixtures, leading to a generalized prewetting transition where polymer collapse is coincident with a locally stabilized liquid droplet. We use lattice Monte-Carlo simulations and a mean-field theory to show that these phases can be stable even in regimes where both polymer collapse and coexisting liquid phases are unstable in isolation, and that these new transitions can be either abrupt or continuous. For polymers with internal linear structure we further show that changes in the concentration of bulk components can lead to changes in three-dimensional polymer structure. In the nucleus there are many distinct proteins that interact with many different regions of chromatin, potentially giving rise to many different Prewet phases. The simple systems we consider here highlight chromatin's role as a lower-dimensional surface whose interactions with proteins are required for these novel phases.

Title: Emergence of Fluctuation Relations in UNO
Authors: Peter Sidajaya, Jovan Hsuen Khai Low, Clive Cenxin Aw, Valerio Scarani
Abstract: In the last two decades, fluctuation theorems have been proved formally and demonstrated experimentally for several variables (such as entropy production, work, or flux) and different noises causing the fluctuations (of either thermal or other origin; Markovian or non-Markovian). Here we report the observation of a detailed fluctuation relation in a statistical process outside thermodynamics and physics: the card game UNO. As the fluctuating variable, we consider the number of steps $W$ needed for one player's deck to change from $x$ to $y$ number of cards. The other players and the remaining cards play the role of a finite non-Markovian bath. Numerical simulations of runs of the game show that $W$ obeys a fluctuation relation analogous to Crooks' theorem. While the observed behavior shares some common features with infinite random walks, it also exhibits deviations that are clear signatures of non-Markovianity and the finiteness of the bath: Notably, the parameter corresponding to temperature depends strongly on the transition $x\rightarrow y$. Our paper contributes to extending the scope of fluctuation theorems beyond their usual thermodynamic setting.

Title: Effective field theories of dissipative fluids with one-form symmetries
Authors: Shreya Vardhan, Sašo Grozdanov, Samuel Leutheusser, Hong Liu
Abstract: A system with a one-form global symmetry at finite temperature can be viewed as a dissipative fluid of string-like objects. In this work, we classify and construct the most general effective field theories for hydrodynamics of such string fluids, in a probe limit where the one-form charge density is decoupled from the energy-momentum tensor. We show that at leading order in the derivative expansion, there are two distinct types of diffusive transport in a string fluid depending on the discrete spacetime symmetries present in it. One particular application of interest is magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), where the effective field theories describe the diffusion of magnetic field lines. Due to the distinction between the effective field theories for different discrete symmetries, we show that the MHD of a fluid with charge conjugation symmetry is qualitatively different from that of a neutron star, which we previously discussed in arXiv:2207.01636. The explicit effective actions that we write down can be used to obtain the dispersion relations $\omega(k)$ up to cubic order in momenta for each of the different discrete symmetry choices. As another application of this formalism, we show that when the one-form symmetry is spontaneously broken, the effective action reduces to the Maxwell theory. This confirms the interpretation of the photon as a Goldstone boson arising from the spontaneous breaking of a one-form symmetry.

Title: On the Hamiltonian structure of the intrinsic evolution of a closed vortex sheet
Authors: Banavara N. Shashikanth
Abstract: Motivated by the work of previous authors on vortex sheets and their applications, the intrinsic inviscid evolution equations of a closed vortex sheet in a plane, separating two piecewise constant density fluids, and their Hamiltonian form are investigated. The model has potential applications to problems involving the dynamics of interfaces of two immiscible fluids. A boundary Poisson bracket, which appears to be new and related to the KdV bracket, is obtained containing the curve-tangential derivative $\partial / \partial s$. Lagrangian invariants of the sheet motion by its self-induced velocity--the Cauchy principal value of the Biot-Savart integral--are also derived.

Title: Geometric Optimization of Quantum Control with Minimum Cost
Authors: Chengming Tan, Yuhao Cai, Jinyi Zhang, Shengli Ma, Chenwei Lv, Ren Zhang
Abstract: We investigate the optimization of quantum control from a differential geometric perspective. In our approach, optimal control minimizes the cost associated with evolving a quantum state, with the cost quantified by the length of the trajectory on a relevant Riemannian manifold. We demonstrate the optimization protocol in systems with SU(2) and SU(1,1) dynamical symmetries, which encompass a broad range of physical systems. In these systems, the time evolution can be represented by trajectories on a three-dimensional manifold. Given the initial and final states, the minimum-cost quantum control corresponds to a geodesic on the manifold. When the trajectory between the initial and final states is specified, the minimum-cost control corresponds to a geodesic within a submanifold embedded in the three-dimensional space. This framework provides a geometric method for optimizing shortcuts to adiabatic driving.

Title: Non-Markovian Rock-Paper-Scissors games
Authors: Ohad Vilk, Mauro Mobilia, Michael Assaf
Abstract: There is mounting evidence that species interactions often involve long-term memory, with highly-varying waiting times between successive events and long-range temporal correlations. Accounting for memory undermines the common Markovian assumption, and dramatically impacts key ingredients of population dynamics including birth, foraging, predation, and competition processes. Here, we study a critical aspect of population dynamics, namely non-Markovian multi-species competition. This is done in the realm of the zero-sum rock-paper-scissors (zRPS) model that is broadly used in the life sciences to metaphorically describe cyclic competition between three interacting species. We develop a general non-Markovian formalism for multi-species dynamics, allowing us to determine the regions of the parameter space where each species dominates. In particular, when the dynamics are Markovian, the waiting times are exponentially distributed and the fate of the zRPS model in large well-mixed populations is encoded in a remarkably simple condition, often referred to as the ``law of the weakest'' (LOW), stating that the species with the lowest growth rate is the most likely to prevail. We show that the survival behavior and LOW of the zRPS model are critically affected by non-exponential waiting times, and especially, by their coefficient of variation. Our findings provide key insight into the influence of long waiting times on non-Markovian evolutionary processes.

Title: Causality and instability in wave propagation in random time-varying media
Authors: Romain Pierrat, Julia Rocha, Rémi Carminati
Abstract: We develop a theoretical model to investigate wave propagation in media with random time-varying properties, where temporal fluctuations lead to complex scattering dynamics. Focusing on the ensemble-averaged field, we derive an exact expression for the average Green's function in the presence of finite temporal disorder, and extend the analysis to the thermodynamic limit. In contrast to spatial disorder, causality prevents recurrent scattering, allowing us to achieve a non-perturbative solution. We introduce an effective medium description providing a simple analysis of the propagation regimes. Our findings offer new insights into wave dynamics in temporally disordered media, with potential applications in time-varying metamaterials, dynamic sensing, and imaging in turbulent or chaotic environments.

Title: MolMiner: Towards Controllable, 3D-Aware, Fragment-Based Molecular Design
Authors: Raul Ortega-Ochoa, Tejs Vegge, Jes Frellsen
Abstract: We introduce MolMiner, a fragment-based, geometry-aware, and order-agnostic autoregressive model for molecular design. MolMiner supports conditional generation of molecules over twelve properties, enabling flexible control across physicochemical and structural targets. Molecules are built via symmetry-aware fragment attachments, with 3D geometry dynamically updated during generation using forcefields. A probabilistic conditioning mechanism allows users to specify any subset of target properties while sampling the rest. MolMiner achieves calibrated conditional generation across most properties and offers competitive unconditional performance. We also propose improved benchmarking methods for both unconditional and conditional generation, including distributional comparisons via Wasserstein distance and calibration plots for property control. To our knowledge, this is the first model to unify dynamic geometry, symmetry handling, order-agnostic fragment-based generation, and high-dimensional multi-property conditioning.

Title: Berry Curvature and Spin-One Color Superconductivity
Authors: Noriyuki Sogabe, Yi Yin
Abstract: We explore the interplay between Berry curvature and topological properties in single-flavor color superconductors, where quarks form spin-one Cooper pairs. By deriving a new relation, we connect the topological nodal structure of the gap function in momentum space to the (nonabelian) Berry flux associated with paired quarks. This generalizes the early work by Li and Haldane [Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 067003 (2018)] to systems with additional internal quantum numbers, such as color. In the ultrarelativistic limit, we uncover rich topological structures driven by the interplay of spin, chirality, and color. Specifically, we identify chirality-induced topological nodes in the transverse (opposite chirality pairing) polar and A phases. In contrast, the color-spin-locking phase lacks these nodes due to a nontrivial color Berry flux, which in turn induces gapless excitations with total Berry monopole charges of $\pm 3/2-$differing from conventional Weyl fermions. Our findings can be potentially extended to other fermionic systems carrying additional internal degrees of freedom.

Title: Higher obstructions to conformal boundary conditions and lattice realizations
Authors: Ruizhi Liu, Weicheng Ye
Abstract: Although it is long believed that vanishing of chiral central charges of a 2d conformal field theory (CFT) implies the existence of conformal boundary conditions, there are yet higher obstructions. In this paper, we focus on 2d rational CFTs, for which we identify a series of obstructions, known as higher central charges. We also discuss its implication for lattice realizations and the generalization with global symmetries.

Title: Electrochemically induced hyperfluorescence based on the formation of charge-transfer excimers
Authors: Chang-Ki Moon, Yuka Yasuda, Yu Kusakabe, Anna Popczyk, Shohei Fukushima, Julian F. Butscher, Nachiket Pathak, Hironori Kaji, Malte C. Gather
Abstract: Used extensively in sensing applications, the application of solution-state electrochemiluminescent devices (ECLDs) in lighting and displays has been constrained by their low luminance and short operational lifetime. Here, we report a record improvement in the luminance, efficiency, and operational longevity of ECLDs by introducing electrochemically induced hyperfluorescence (ECiHF) and demonstrate its use in a calligraphic display. We use the double-decker arrangement assumed by the electron donor and acceptor segments of the molecule TpAT-tFFO to realize thermally activated delayed fluorescence from an electrogenerated charge-transfer (CT) excimer state and a subsequent energy transfer to the rubrene emitter TBRb. ECLDs based on this strategy achieve an unprecedented luminance of >6,200 cd/m2 and their operational lifetime is more than 10-fold longer than all previous ECLDs with meaningful efficiency or brightness. We identify energy level alignment between excimer and emitter as a crucial factor for efficient ECiHF; spectroelectrochemical analysis reveals that devices with energy gaps < 0.4 eV operate on a pure excimer mechanism across a wide range of frequencies. Our findings highlight the potential of ECiHF for improving ECLDs and pave the way to commercial applications of this form of fluid light.

Title: Momentum coupling of classical atoms
Authors: Andras Suto
Abstract: A new method, dual-space cluster expansion, is proposed to study classical phases transitions in the continuum. It relies on replacing the particle positions as integration variables by the momenta of the relative displacements of particle pairs. Due to the requirement that the particles must be static, coupling via the momenta partitions the set of particles into a set of clusters, and transforms the partition function into a sum over the different cluster decompositions. This allows us to derive a formula for the density that finite clusters can carry in the infinite system. In a simplified example, we then demonstrate that in two and higher dimensions this density has a threshold, beyond which the particles form infinite clusters. The transition is accompanied by a singularity in the free energy. We also show that infinite clusters are always present in condensed phases, most likely submacroscopic in liquids and macroscopic in crystals.

Title: Emergence of network communities driven by local rules
Authors: Alexei Vazquez
Abstract: Natural systems are modeled by networks with nodes and links. Often the nodes are segregated into communities with different connectivity patterns. Node heterogeneity such as political affiliation in social networks or biological function in gene networks are highlighted as key factors driving the segregation of nodes into communities. Here, by means of numerical simulations, I show that node heterogeneity is not a necessary requirement. To this end I introduce the Ramsey community number, $r_\kappa$, the minimum graph size that warranties the emergence of network communities with almost certainty. Using the stochastic block model for community detection with correction for degree sequence, I show that networks generated by local rules have finite $r_\kappa$ values while their randomized versions do not have emergent communities. I conjecture that network communities are an emergent property of networks evolving with local rules.

Title: Gain compression in Josephson Traveling-Wave Parametric Amplifiers
Authors: Gwenael Le Gal, Guilliam Butseraen, Arpit Ranadive, Giulio Cappelli, Bekim Fazliji, Edgar Bonet, Eric Eyraud, Luca Planat, Nicolas Roch
Abstract: Superconducting traveling-wave parametric amplifiers (TWPAs) are increasingly used in various applications, including quantum computing, quantum sensing, and dark matter detection. However, one important characteristic of these amplifiers, gain compression, has not received much attention. As a result, there is a lack of comprehensive experimental exploration of this phenomenon in the existing literature. In this study, we present an experimental investigation of gain compression in a Josephson traveling-wave parametric amplifier based on a four-wave mixing process. We have implemented a novel setup to monitor the complex transmission of both the pump and signal tones, which allows us to simultaneously track pump depletion and signal amplification as functions of signal power and frequency across the entire bandwidth of the device. Our findings indicate that, while pump depletion occurs during gain compression, it is not the only mechanism involved in the saturation of a TWPA. Power-induced phase-matching processes also take place within the device. This study provides valuable insights for optimizing TWPAs for applications that require high total input power, such as multiplexed qubit readout or broadband photon emission.

Title: Periodic Motzkin chain: Ground states and symmetries
Authors: Andrei G. Pronko
Abstract: Motzkin chain is a model of nearest-neighbor interacting quantum $s=1$ spins with open boundary conditions. It is known that it has a unique ground state which can be viewed as a sum of Motzkin paths. We consider the case of periodic boundary conditions and provide several conjectures about structure of the ground state space and symmetries of the Hamiltonian. We conjecture that the ground state is degenerate and independent states are distinguished by eigenvalues of the third component of total spin operator. Each of these states can be described as a sum of paths, similar to the Motzkin paths. Moreover, there exist two operators commuting with the Hamiltonian, which play the roles of lowering and raising operators when acting at these states. We conjecture also that these operators generate a $C$-type Lie algebra, with rank equal to the number of sites. The symmetry algebra of the Hamiltonian is actually wider, and extended, besides the cyclic shift operator, by a central element contained in the third component of total spin operator.

Title: Super diffusive length dependent thermal conductivity in one-dimensional materials with structural defects: longitudinal to transverse phonon scattering leads to $κ\propto L^{1/3}$ law
Authors: Alexander L. Burin
Abstract: Structural defects in one-dimensional heat conductors couple longitudinal (stretching) and transverse (bending) vibrations. This coupling results in the scattering of longitudinal phonons to transverse phonons and backwards. We show that the decay rate of longitudinal phonons due to this scattering scales with their frequencies as $\omega^{3/2}$ within the long wavelength limit ($\omega \rightarrow 0$), which is more efficient scattering compared to the traditionally considered Rayleigh scattering within the longitudinal band ($\omega^2$). This scattering results in temperature independent thermal conductivity depending on the size as $\kappa \propto L^{1/3}$ for sufficiently long materials. This predicted length dependence is observed in nanowires, though the temperature dependence is seen there possibly because of deviations from pure one-dimensional behavior. The significant effect of interaction of longitudinal phonons with transverse phonons is consistent with the earlier observations of a substantial suppression of thermal energy transport by kinks, obviously leading to such interaction, though anharmonic interaction can also be significant.

Title: Symmetry resolved entanglement entropy after an inhomogeneous quench
Authors: Hui-Huang Chen, Xin-Liang Zhou, Jiayu Yin, Ming Zhang
Abstract: We investigate the non-equilibrium time evolution of symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy (SREE) following an inhomogeneous quench in a critical one-dimensional free fermion system. Using conformal field theory, we derive an exact expression for the SREE and analyze its behavior. We find that, at leading order in the long-time limit, the SREE grows logarithmically as $\log t$. While the equipartition of entanglement holds at leading order, we identify subleading corrections that break it. Our numerical simulations corroborate the analytical predictions with excellent agreement.

Title: Uncovering complementary information sharing in spider monkey collective foraging using higher-order spatial networks
Authors: Gabriel Ramos-Fernandez, Ross S. Walker, Matthew J. Silk, Denis Boyer, Sandra E. Smith-Aguilar
Abstract: Collectives are often able to process information in a distributed fashion, surpassing each individual member's processing capacity. In fission-fusion dynamics, where group members come together and split from others often, sharing complementary information about uniquely known foraging areas could allow a group to track a heterogenous foraging environment better than any group member on its own. We analyse the partial overlaps between individual core ranges, which we assume represent the knowledge of an individual during a given season. We identify sets of individuals whose overlap shows a balance between redundantly and uniquely known portions and we use simplicial complexes to represent these higher-order interactions. The structure of the simplicial complexes shows holes in various dimensions, revealing complementarity in the foraging information that is being shared. We propose that the complex spatial networks arising from fission-fusion dynamics allow for adaptive, collective processing of foraging information in dynamic environments.

Title: Expedited thermalization dynamics in incommensurate systems
Authors: Mingdi Xu, Zijun Wei, Xiang-Ping Jiang, Lei Pan
Abstract: We study the thermalization dynamics of a quantum system embedded in an incommensurate potential and coupled to a Markovian thermal reservoir. The dephasing induced by the bath drives the system toward an infinite-temperature steady state, erasing all initial information-including signatures of localization. We find that initially localized states can relax to the homogeneous steady state faster than delocalized states. Moreover, low-temperature initial states thermalize to infinite temperature more rapidly than high-temperature states -- a phenomenon reminiscent of the Mpemba effect, in which hotter liquids freeze faster than colder ones. The slowest relaxation mode in the Liouvillian spectrum plays a critical role in the expedited thermalization for localized or cold initial states. Our results reveal that the combination of disordered structure and environmental dissipation may lead to non-trivial thermalization behavior, which advances both the conceptual framework of the Mpemba effect and the theoretical understanding of nonequilibrium processes in dissipative disordered systems.

Title: Robustly optimal dynamics for active matter reservoir computing
Authors: Mario U. Gaimann, Miriam Klopotek
Abstract: Information processing abilities of active matter are studied in the reservoir computing (RC) paradigm to infer the future state of a chaotic signal. We uncover an exceptional regime of agent dynamics that has been overlooked previously. It appears robustly optimal for performance under many conditions, thus providing valuable insights into computation with physical systems more generally. The key to forming effective mechanisms for information processing appears in the system's intrinsic relaxation abilities. These are probed without actually enforcing a specific inference goal. The dynamical regime that achieves optimal computation is located just below a critical damping threshold, involving a relaxation with multiple stages, and is readable at the single-particle level. At the many-body level, it yields substrates robustly optimal for RC across varying physical parameters and inference tasks. A system in this regime exhibits a strong diversity of dynamic mechanisms under highly fluctuating driving forces. Correlations of agent dynamics can express a tight relationship between the responding system and the fluctuating forces driving it. As this model is interpretable in physical terms, it facilitates re-framing inquiries regarding learning and unconventional computing with a fresh rationale for many-body physics out of equilibrium.

Title: Farm Size Matters: A Spatially Explicit Ecological-Economic Framework for Biodiversity and Pest Management
Authors: Elia Moretti, Michel Loreau, Michael Benzaquen
Abstract: The intensification of European agriculture, characterized by increasing farm sizes, landscape simplification and reliance on synthetic pesticides, remains a key driver of biodiversity decline. While many studies have investigated this phenomenon, they often focus on isolated elements, resulting in a lack of holistic understanding and leaving policymakers and farmers with unclear priorities. This study addresses this gap by developing a spatially explicit ecological economic model designed to dissect the complex interplay between landscape structure and pesticide application, and their combined effects on natural enemy populations and farmers' economic returns. In particular, the model investigates how these relationships are modulated by farm size (a crucial aspect frequently overlooked in prior research). By calibrating on the European agricultural sector, we explore the ecological and economic consequences of various policy scenarios. We show that the effectiveness of ecological restoration strategies is strongly contingent upon farm size. Small to medium-sized farms can experience economic benefits from reduced pesticide use when coupled with hedgerow restoration, owing to enhanced natural pest control. In contrast, large farms encounter challenges in achieving comparable economic gains due to inherent landscape characteristics. This highlights the need to account for farm size in agri-environmental policies in order to promote biodiversity conservation and agricultural sustainability.
