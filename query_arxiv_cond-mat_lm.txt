Title: Odd-Parity Magnetism and Gate-Tunable Edelstein Response in van der Waals Heterostructures
Authors: Hanbyul Kim, Chan Bin Bark, Seik Pak, Gibaik Sim, Moon Jip Park
Abstract: Odd-parity magnetism has attracted significant interest for its unconventional spin splitting. However, a concrete microscopic route for its realization remains elusive. In this work, we propose van der Waals heterostructures of stripe antiferromagnets (sAFMs) as an ideal platform for electrically controllable $p$-wave magnetism. In the sAFM/metal/sAFM structure, the leading RKKY-type exchange interaction is canceled due to the symmetry of the stacking pattern. This exposes a higher-order biquadratic interaction as a dominant contribution that drives a filling-controlled transition from a collinear phase to an orthogonal $p$-wave configuration. The resulting $p$-wave phase exhibits a gate-tunable Edelstein response, which originates from magnetic symmetry breaking rather than conventional relativistic spin-momentum locking and remains robust even under substantial spin-orbit coupling. Finally, we propose material candidates for the realization of our theory. Our results establish van der Waals heterostructures as a practical platform for non-relativistic spintronics with electric control of odd-parity spin textures.

Title: Sondheimer magneto-oscillations as a probe of Fermi surface reconstruction in underdoped cuprates
Authors: Alexander Nikolaenko, Carsten Putzke, Philip J. W. Moll, Subir Sachdev, Pavel A. Nosov
Abstract: Determining the Fermi surface (FS) volume in underdoped cuprates is crucial for understanding the nature of the strongly correlated pseudogap phase. Conventional quantum oscillation techniques, typically used for this purpose, are inapplicable in this high-temperature regime due to thermal and disorder-induced smearing of Landau levels. We propose Sondheimer oscillations (SO), semiclassical oscillations of in-plane magnetoresistivity in thin films, as a robust alternative probe of FS reconstruction. SO arise from the commensuration between the cyclotron radius and film thickness, do not rely on Landau quantization, and remain observable at moderate fields and elevated temperatures where quantum oscillations are suppressed. Their frequencies depend solely on the FS parameters (e.g., curvature), and not on specific details of scattering mechanisms. SO are also sensitive to the coherence of inter-layer tunneling, allow contributions from individual FS pockets to be distinguished in the frequency domain, and naturally include the Yamaji angle effect (if present in the system) as a prominent feature in the frequency spectrum. We compute SO spectra as a function of the magnetic field orientation for three representative scenarios: (i) an unreconstructed large FS, (ii) a spin density wave reconstructed FS with volume $p/4$, and (iii) a fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL$^*$) with pocket volume $p/8$ (here $p$ is the hole doping). We show that the SO spectrum offers a wealth of universal features that could be used to differentiate between these scenarios. In particular, we highlight a FS geometry-dependent phase shift between oscillations in longitudinal and transverse conductivities, characterize how the FS curvature can be extracted from SO if the film orientation is perpendicular to the crystallographic $c$-axis, and analyze the evolution of the SO spectrum with doping.

Title: Unlearnable phases of matter
Authors: Tarun Advaith Kumar, Yijian Zou, Amir-Reza Negari, Roger G. Melko, Timothy H. Hsieh
Abstract: We identify fundamental limitations in machine learning by demonstrating that non-trivial mixed-state phases of matter are computationally hard to learn. Focusing on unsupervised learning of distributions, we show that autoregressive neural networks fail to learn global properties of distributions characterized by locally indistinguishable (LI) states. We demonstrate that conditional mutual information (CMI) is a useful diagnostic for LI: we show that for classical distributions, long-range CMI of a state implies a spatially LI partner. By introducing a restricted statistical query model, we prove that nontrivial phases with long-range CMI, such as strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking phases, are hard to learn. We validate our claims by using recurrent, convolutional, and Transformer neural networks to learn the syndrome and physical distributions of toric/surface code under bit flip noise. Our findings suggest hardness of learning as a diagnostic tool for detecting mixed-state phases and transitions and error-correction thresholds, and they suggest CMI and more generally ``non-local Gibbsness'' as metrics for how hard a distribution is to learn.

Title: Lieb-Schultz-Mattis constraints from stratified anomalies of modulated symmetries
Authors: Salvatore D. Pace, Daniel Bulmash
Abstract: We introduce stratified symmetry operators and stratified anomalies in quantum lattice systems as generalizations of onsite symmetry operators and onsite projective representations. A stratified symmetry operator is a symmetry operator that factorizes into mutually independent subsystem symmetry operators; its stratified anomaly is defined as the collection of anomalies associated with these subsystem operators. We develop a cellular chain complex formalism for stratified anomalies of internal symmetries and show that, in the presence of crystalline symmetries, they give rise to Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) constraints. This includes LSM anomalies and SPT-LSM theorems. We apply this framework to modulated $G$ symmetries, which are symmetries whose total symmetry group is ${G_\mathrm{tot} = G \rtimes G_\mathrm{s}}$, with $G_\mathrm{s}$ the crystalline symmetry group. Notably, a nonzero stratified anomaly within a fundamental domain of $G_\mathrm{s}$ (e.g., a unit cell) does not always imply an LSM anomaly for modulated symmetries. Instead, the existence of an LSM anomaly also depends on how $G_\mathrm{s}$ acts on $G$. When $G_\mathrm{s}$ is the lattice translation group, we find an explicit criterion for when a stratified anomaly causes an LSM anomaly, and classify LSM anomalies using homology groups of $G_\mathrm{s}$-invariant cellular chains. We illustrate this through examples of exponential and dipole symmetries with stratified anomalies, both in ${(1+1)}$D and ${(2+1)}$D, and construct a stabilizer code model of a modulated SPT subject to an SPT-LSM theorem.

Title: Jamming-controlled stochasticity in metal-insulator switching
Authors: Nicolò D'Anna, Nareg Ghazikhanian, Katherine Matthews, Daseul Ham, Su Yong Lee, Alex Frano, Ivan K. Schuller, Oleg Shpyrko
Abstract: Understanding and controlling phase transitions is a fundamental part of physics and has been central to many technological revolutions, from steam engines to field-effect transistors. At present, there is strong interest in materials with strongly coupled structural and electronic phase transitions, which hold promise for energy-efficient technologies. Utilizing a structural phase transition and controlling its plasticity naturally leads to built-in memory, a key feature for emulating neurons and synapses in neuromorphic technologies. Here, $\textit{operando}$ Bragg X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy is used to study the evolution of the nano-domain distribution at the micron-scale in neuromorphic devices made from the archetypal Mott insulator vanadium dioxide. It is found that after electrical switching, slow nano-domain reconfiguration occurs on timescales of thousands of seconds and that the domains undergo a jamming transition, offering control over switching stochasticity at the micron scale. More precisely, repetitive above-threshold currents plastically drive the system into a jammed/glassy state where switching becomes deterministic, while sub-threshold currents erase the short-term memory contained in the nano-domain distribution, recovering stochastic switching, thus offering a path for in-device learning. The results illustrate the importance of studying the nanoscale physics associated with phase transitions in strongly correlated materials, even for macroscopic devices, and offer guidance for future device operation schemes.

Title: Renormalization group analysis of directed percolation process: Towards multiloop calculation of scaling functions
Authors: Michal Hnatič, Matej Kecer, Tomáš Lučivjanský, Lukáš Mižišin
Abstract: In this work, we employ a field-theoretic renormalization group approach to study a paradigmatic model of directed percolation. We focus on the perturbative calculation of the equation of state, extending the analysis to the three-loop order in the expansion parameter $\varepsilon = 4-d$. We show that a large group of the necessary three-loop Feynman diagrams can be mapped onto already existing three-loop results, and develop a technique for the calculation of the remaining -- truly novel -- ones. The described semi-analytic procedure is further used to verify existing two-loop results. The main aim of this study is to provide an update on this ongoing work, as full three-loop calculations utilizing the described procedure are in progress.

Title: When Blinking Helps: Suppressed Biexciton Emission in Lead Halide Perovskite Quantum Dots
Authors: Adam Olejniczak, Jehyeok Ryu, Francesco Di Stasio, Yury Rakovich, Victor Krivenkov
Abstract: Blinking and multiphoton emission in metal halide perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) limit their use as single-photon quantum emitters. Conventional models distinguish between trion-related A-type blinking and defect-assisted BC-type blinking, both expected to degrade single-photon purity in a dark state. Here, time-resolved spectroscopy on individual PQDs reveals a qualitatively different regime in which low emitting dark states exhibit higher single-photon purity than bright states. For those PQDs state-resolved $g^{(2)}(\tau)$ analysis shows that the exciton photoluminescence quantum yield decreases by a factor of $\sim 8$, while the biexciton one is suppressed by a factor of $\sim 10$. This leads to a moderate improvement of single-photon purity with $g^{(2)}_0$ decreased from 0.155 to 0.120. In contrast, PQDs with fluorescence lifetime--intensity distribution patterns characteristic for A-type blinking, display the expected increase of $g^{(2)}_0$ in charged, trion-dominated states. To explain the observed improvement of single-photon purity of low-emitting dark states, we propose a self-trapped-exciton (STE) mechanism that selectively blocks biexciton formation by diverting hot excitons into long-lived, weakly emissive STE configurations. This STE-mediated blinking channel explains why certain low-emitting states improve, rather than degrade, single-photon purity and suggests a lattice-driven route to perovskite quantum emitters with intrinsically suppressed multiphoton events.

Title: Gaussian Expansion Method for few-body states in two-dimensional materials
Authors: Luiz G. M. Tenório, André J. Chaves, Emiko Hiyama, Tobias Frederico
Abstract: We investigate the properties of trions in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) monolayers using the Gaussian Expansion Method (GEM) adapted to two-dimensional systems. Excitons and trions in monolayer TMDCs with the chemical composition MX$_2$ in the 2H phase are studied systematically. We computed the associated exciton and trion binding energies. We find in addition to the known $J = 0$ trion the existence of a bound state with orbital angular momentum $J = 1$. The results for $J = 0$ are benchmarked against existing calculations from the Stochastic Variational Method (SVM) and Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC). Furthermore, we analyze the trion internal structure and geometry through their probability density distributions, accounting for the effects of different material shows that GEM -- widely used in studies of strongly interacting few-body systems -- is well adapted to allow comprehensive and computationally efficient investigations of trions and potentially other weakly bound few-body states in layered materials. In addition, we systematically exploit the effect of strain and dieletric environment in the $J = 1$ trion predictions, illustrated for the MoS$_2$ monolayer example.

Title: Metastable Dynamical Computing with Energy Landscapes: A Primer
Authors: Christian Z. Pratt, Kyle J. Ray, James P. Crutchfield
Abstract: Smartphones, laptops, and data centers are CMOS-based technologies that ushered our world into the information age of the 21st century. Despite their advantages for scalable computing, their implementations come with surprisingly large energetic costs. This challenge has revitalized scientific and engineering interest in energy-efficient information-processing designs. One current paradigm -- dynamical computing -- controls the location and shape of minima in potential energy landscapes that are connected to a thermal environment. The landscape supports distinguishable metastable energy minima that serve as a system's mesoscopic memory states. Information is represented by microstate distributions. Dynamically manipulating the memory states then corresponds to information processing. This framing provides a natural description of the associated thermodynamic transformations and required resources. Appealing to bifurcation theory, a computational protocol in the metastable regime can be analyzed by tracking the evolution of fixed points in the state space. We illustrate the paradigm's capabilities by performing 1-bit and 2-bit computations with double-well and quadruple-well potentials, respectively. These illustrate how dynamical computing can serve as a basis for designing universal logic gates and investigating their out-of-equilibrium thermodynamic performance.

Title: Non-Fermi liquid and Weyl superconductivity from the weakly interacting 3D electron gas at high magnetic fields
Authors: Nandagopal Manoj, Valerio Peri, Jason Alicea
Abstract: Three-dimensional electron gases in strong magnetic fields host partially flat bands that disperse along the field direction yet exhibit Landau-level quantization in the transverse dimensions. Early work established that for spin-polarized electrons confined to the lowest Landau level band, repulsion triggers a charge density wave (CDW) in which electrons 'self-layer' into integer quantum Hall states, while attraction generates a non-Fermi liquid (rather than a superconductor). We revisit this problem with physically motivated deformations -- including generalized local interactions, higher Landau level bands, restoration of spin, and explicit breaking of spatial symmetries -- paying particular attention to the competition between CDWs and superconductivity. Our main findings are: (1) Generic local interactions can stabilize a nematic CDW in which integer quantum Hall layers spontaneously 'tilt', yielding unconventional Hall response. (2) We numerically establish that the non-Fermi liquid appears stable to perturbations that preserve effective dipole conservation symmetries that emerge within a Landau level band. (3) Upon explicitly breaking translation symmetry, attraction catalyzes a novel layered superconductor that hosts Weyl nodes, superconducts within each layer, and insulates transverse to the layers. These results expand the rich phenomenology of interacting bulk electrons in the high-field regime and potentially inform the design of field-resistant superconductivity in low-carrier-density materials.

Title: Optical gain in colloidal quantum dots is limited by biexciton absorption, not biexciton recombination
Authors: Davide Zenatti, Patanjali Kambhampati
Abstract: Despite three decades of experimental study, optical gain in colloidal quantum dots still lacks a microscopic theory capable of explaining gain thresholds approaching one exciton per dot, their size dependence, or the anomalously small effective stimulated-emission cross sections observed across materials. Existing descriptions treat quantum dots as effective two-level systems comprised of an exciton and a biexciton, attributing gain thresholds to biexciton Auger recombination. This assumption is inconsistent with state-resolved optical pumping experiments and basic spectroscopic constraints. Here we present a microscopic theory of optical gain explicitly anchored in the Einstein relations governing absorption and stimulated emission. Within this framework, gain is determined by a spectral balance between stimulated emission from single excitons and excited-state absorption into biexcitonic manifolds, rather than by biexciton lifetimes. Using a spin-boson description of excitons coupled to a lattice bath, we show that gain thresholds and effective gain cross sections are controlled by the interplay of biexciton stabilization and exciton-lattice dressing. The theory unifies disparate materials by quantitatively explaining all longstanding gain phenomenology in CdSe quantum dots and predicts a continuous crossover to effective four-level, near-thresholdless gain in dynamically disordered lattices such as perovskite quantum dots.

Title: Thermodynamics and kinetics of lithium at the silver-lithium battery interface
Authors: Grace M. Lu (Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, Illinois, USA, Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, University of California at Irvine, Irvine, California, USA), Dallas R. Trinkle (Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, Illinois, USA)
Abstract: Silver interlayers have been shown to enable smooth lithium deposition and cycling in anode-free solid-state batteries. Here, we report the atomic structure of the Ag and Li interface, showing that Li preferentially plates as FCC on both the (111) and (100) Ag surfaces. This forms an energetically favorable coherent interface with Ag, while the BCC phase forms a semi-coherent interface due to large lattice mismatch. We also calculate vacancy formation energies and migration energies for Li diffusion through the interface. We show that vacancy formation energies increase at the interface, leading to an energetic driving force for vacancies to diffuse away from the interface. Additionally, the migration barriers for vacancies from the Ag to the Li are small (29 meV), and therefore promote rapid alloying between Ag and Li. Rapid Li diffusion kinetics directly at the interface leads to smooth deposition of Li, reducing the onset of dendrites. However, diffusion in the 2nd and 3rd Li layers is slower compared to bulk FCC or BCC Li, leading to kinetically hindered alloying when multiple layers of pure Li form. The diffusion kinetics for Ag nanoparticles may be improved by alloying with Mg to expand the Ag lattice constant while forming a solid solution with both Ag and Li.

Title: Krylov space perturbation theory for quantum synchronization in closed systems
Authors: Nicolas Loizeau, Berislav Buča
Abstract: Strongly interacting quantum many-body systems are expected to thermalize, however, some evade thermalization due to symmetries. Quantum synchronization provides one such example of ergodicity breaking, but previous studies have focused on open systems. Here, motivated by the problem of ergodicity breaking in closed systems and the study of non-trivial dynamics, we investigate synchronization in a closed disordered Heisenberg spin chain. In the presence of large random disorder, strongly breaking the permutation symmetry of the system, we observe the emergence of spatial synchronization, where spins lock into locally synchronized patches. This behavior can be interpreted as a fragmentation of the global dynamical symmetry $S^+$ into a collection of local dynamical symmetries, each characterized by a distinct frequency. In the weak-disorder regime, still without permutation symmetry, we show that the synchronization mechanism can be understood perturbatively within Krylov space. In the absence of disorder, the Krylov space associated with the dynamical symmetry $S^+$ is two-dimensional. Introducing disorder couples this subspace to the remainder of the Krylov space. This coupling leads only to a second-order correction to the frequency of the dynamical symmetry, thereby preserving coherent oscillations despite the presence of small disorder. At stronger disorder, the perturbation modifies $S^+$ so that it acquires a finite lifetime, providing an example of a transient dynamical symmetry.

Title: Intermediate Thermal Equilibrium Stages in Molecular Dynamics Simulations of two Bodies in Contact
Authors: Jonathas N. da Silva, Octavio D. Rodriguez Salmon, Minos A. Neto
Abstract: The Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics states that if two systems are in thermal equilibrium with a third one, then they are also in equilibrium with each other. This study explores not only the final state of thermal equilibrium between ideal gases separated by heat-conducting walls, but also the intermediate stages leading up to equilibrium, using classical molecular dynamics simulations. Two- and three-region models with argon atoms are analyzed. Fluctuations, correlations, and temperature distributions are observed, highlighting how heat conduction between regions influences the time to reach equilibrium. This work is distinguished by its detailed analysis of the intermediate stages that occur until the system reaches thermal equilibrium, in accordance with the Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics.

Title: Nanoscopic Imaging of Acoustic Dynamics in van der Waals Ferroelectric NbOI2
Authors: Zhaodong Chu, Carter Fox, Zixin Zhai, Haihua Liu, Priti Yadav, Bing Lv, Yue Li, Thomas E Gage, Jun Xiao, Haidan Wen
Abstract: Understanding how low-dimensional ferroelectrics respond to ultrafast excitation at nanoscales is essential for controlling energy flow and mechanical functionality in next-generation polar materials and devices. Here, we report spatiotemporally resolved structural dynamics in the van der Waals ferroelectric NbOI2 using combined ultrafast electron microscopy and diffraction. Above-band-gap photoexcitation rapidly screens the in-plane polarization and heats the lattice, launching three coherent acoustic phonons: two transverse shear modes and one longitudinal breathing mode. The transverse mode that shears the layers perpendicular to the in-plane polar axis dominates over that along the polar axis, reflecting anisotropic coupling between polarization and strain. Spatially resolved measurements further reveal spatially correlated heterogeneity in the mode amplitudes and lifetimes. Regions dominated by a single shear mode exhibit significantly longer lifetime of acoustic oscillations than that of multimode regions, suggesting that acoustic phonon-phonon scattering is a major source of decoherence. Our results provide a microscopic understanding of polarization-strain coupling and spatially heterogeneous energy dissipation in van der Waals ferroelectrics under ultrafast excitation.

Title: Nonmonotonic Magnetic Friction from Collective Rotor Dynamics
Authors: Hongri Gu, Anton Lüders, Clemens Bechinger
Abstract: Amontons' law postulates a monotonic relationship between frictional force and the normal load applied to a sliding contact. This empirical rule, however, fails in systems where internal degrees of freedom - such as structural or electronic order - play a central role. Here, we demonstrate that friction can emerge entirely from magnetically driven configurational dynamics in the absence of physical contact. Using a two-dimensional array of rotatable magnetic dipoles sliding over a commensurate magnetic substrate, we observe a pronounced non-monotonic dependence of friction on the interlayer separation, and thus on the effective load. The friction peaks at an intermediate distance where competing ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions induce dynamical frustration and hysteretic torque cycles during sliding. Molecular dynamics simulations and a simplified two-sublattice model confirm that energy dissipation is governed by collective magnetic reorientations and their hysteresis. Our results establish the occurrence of sliding-induced changes in collective magnetic order, which has a strong impact on friction, and thus open new possibilities for contactless friction control, magnetic sensing, and the design of reconfigurable, wear-free frictional interfaces and metamaterials.

Title: Efficient molecular dynamics simulation of 2D penta-silicene materials using machine learning potentials
Authors: Le Huu Nghia, Pham Thi Bich Thao, Truong Do Anh Kha, Vo Khuong Dien, Nguyen Thanh Tien
Abstract: Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) are a modern computational method that allows achieving near-quantum mechanical accuracy (DFT) while still describing large-scale systems in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In this work, we use MLIP from DeepMD package and the classical Tersoff potential for SiC (this http URL potential) to fully and accurately describe atomic interactions and apply them to molecular dynamics simulations of penta silicene sheet. The results show that the melting points (T$_g$) temperatures of the system in the canonical NVT and isobaric NPT sets are 632 K and 606 K, while the this http URL potential have the high melting points, respectively. In addition, the radial distribution function exhibits characteristic peaks at interatomic distances of 2.275 Å\text{} and 2.375 Å, while the this http URL potential only describe distance of 2.375 Å. Furthermore, penta silicene was also simulated using on-the-fly machine learning for 10 ps to evaluate the structural stability of the system. This study investigates the thermodynamic properties of two-dimensional penta silicene sheets with pentagonal structures using a high-precision, cost-effective method, contributing further evidence to support experimental synthesis and opening up potential future applications of this material.

Title: Enhanced and Tunable Superconductivity Enabled by Mechanically Stable Halogen-Functionalized Mo2C MXenes
Authors: Jakkapat Seeyangnok, Udomsilp Pinsook
Abstract: We present a comprehensive first-principles investigation of the structural, electronic, vibrational, and superconducting properties of halogen-functionalized Mo2YX2 (Y = C, N; X = F, Cl, Br, I) MXene monolayers. Density functional theory and density functional perturbation theory calculations reveal that, among the halogenated systems considered, only Br- and I-functionalized Mo2C monolayers are dynamically stable, as confirmed by positive definite phonon spectra throughout the Brillouin zone. Electronic structure calculations show metallic behavior with states near the Fermi level dominated by Mo d orbitals with pronounced electronic density of states, providing favorable conditions for strong electron-phonon coupling (EPC). The resulting EPC constants place both systems in the strong coupling regime, yielding superconducting transition temperatures of Tc = 13.1 K for Mo2CBr2 and Tc = 18.1 K for Mo2CI2 within the Allen-Dynes formalism. Notably, halogen functionalization itself plays a crucial role in enhancing superconductivity in Mo2C, which has Tc = 7.2 K, leading to a substantial increase in the superconducting transition temperature compared with pristine Mo2C through strengthened electron-phonon coupling. Furthermore, we demonstrate that superconductivity in these systems is highly tunable via carrier doping and biaxial tensile strain. Electron doping significantly enhances EPC and raises Tc up to 21.7 K for Mo2CBr2 and 21.3 K for Mo2CI2. Our results identify halogen-functionalized Mo2C MXenes as mechanically robust, phonon mediated two dimensional superconductors and highlight carrier doping as an effective strategy for optimizing their superconducting performance.

Title: How unconventional oxidation state Au$^{2+}$ is stabilized in halide perovskite Cs$_4$Au$_3$Cl$_{12}$: a first-principles study of its polaron crystal nature
Authors: Kazuki Morita, Andrew M. Rappe
Abstract: Gold in crystalline compounds is typically only stable in oxidation states Au1+ and Au3+. Even compounds with nominal Au2+ usually disproportionate into Au1+ and Au3+. Recently, Cs4Au3Cl12 was synthesized, where gold took the 2+ state in the bulk. Here, we investigate this compound using first-principles calculations and show that stabilization of the Au2+ ion is through the formation of a polaron crystal. The electronic and phononic structure suggest that the bonding network can be interpreted as a collection of [Au2+Cl4]2- and [Au3+Cl4]1- square planar motifs, and the crystal lacks a smooth pathway for Au2+ to disproportionate into Au1+ and Au3+. The electronic states of Au are contained within each [AuCl4] motif, which allows for the Au2+ state to be localized and isolated electronically. The Au2+-sites form an ordered structure, which is driven by a strong repulsive interaction between [Au2+Cl4]2- motifs due to their lattice distortion. The electron-phonon coupling between Au2+ and Cl explains the stability of Au2+, which suggests this material to be interpreted as a polaron crystal. By considering redox reaction, we show that Cs4Au3Cl12 has the maximal density of Au2+, and further oxidation will induce a delocalized state. Cs4Au3Cl12 has distinctive electronic structure, with a narrow gap, isolated HOMO and LUMO bands strongly localized at the Au-sites, and magnetization at the Au2+-sites making Cs4Au3Cl12 unique among quantum materials. Magnetism in gold is rare, and Cs4Au3Cl12 can be a testbed to explore novel gold chemistry as well as polaron crystal transport. The strategy to stabilize an unconventional oxidation state through engineering of lattice distortions is quite general; therefore, we propose that a similar approach will be applicable to a wide variety of transition metal compounds.

Title: Coupling Lattice Distortion and Cation Disorder to Control Li-ion Transport in Cation-Disordered Rocksalt Oxides
Authors: Zichang Zhang, Lihua Feng, Jiewei Cheng, Peng-Hu Du, Chu-Liang Fu, Jian Peng, Shuo Wang, Dingguo Xia, Xueliang Sun, Qiang Sun
Abstract: Cation-disordered solids offer a rich chemical landscape where local coordination, lattice responses, and configurational disorder collectively, yet often implicitly, govern ion transport. In cation-disordered rocksalt oxides, Li+ diffusion has conventionally been rationalized by the static 0-transition-metal (0-TM) percolation rule, which assumes an ideal, passive lattice and thus fails to capture experimentally accessible capacities. Here, we show that lattice distortion is an essential, previously overlooked degree of freedom that actively reshapes Li+ percolation networks. By developing a lattice-responsive framework combining Monte Carlo sampling of cation configurations with machine-learning-accelerated molecular dynamics, we quantitatively predict Li+ percolation and electrochemical capacities within 5% of experiment. Our results reveal a causal coupling between lattice distortion and cation short-range order: enhanced local distortions precede and suppress short-range ordering, activating Li+ migration through nominally inaccessible 1-TM channels, fundamentally extending percolation beyond the 0-TM paradigm. Guided by this, we design and synthesize a high-entropy oxide, Li1.2Mn0.2Ti0.2V0.2Mo0.2O2, which exhibits enhanced distortion and achieves a 71.9% Li+ percolation network, surpassing 65.8% in Li1.2Mn0.4Ti0.4O2, delivering 256.3 mAh/g capacity, closely matching our prediction of 255.1 mAh/g. These findings establish lattice distortion as an active control parameter for ion transport, revising percolation concepts and offering a general design principle beyond metal-ion cathodes.

Title: Charge density wave and superconductivity modulated by c-axis stacking in the TaSe2 polytypes
Authors: Kusal Dharmasiri, Maxim Avdeev, Despina Louca
Abstract: The layered transition metal dichalcogenide, TaSe2, exhibits rich electronic phenomena across its polymorphs, 1T, 2H, and 3R, largely driven by differences in atomic coordination and c-axis stacking. In the 1T phase, octahedral coordination and AA stacking promote strong interlayer coupling and stabilize a commensurate charge density wave (CDW) with star-of-David clusters that set in at high temperatures. The 2H phase exhibits trigonal prismatic coordination with AB stacking, and hosts both incommensurate and commensurate CDW phases and weak superconductivity at very low temperatures. The 3R phase, characterized by ABC stacking and trigonal prismatic coordination, exhibits enhanced superconductivity along with CDW order, attributed to modified interlayer hybridization and reduced CDW competition. These stacking-dependent variations in interlayer coupling are critical in tuning correlated states in the dichalcogenides.

Title: Thermodynamics of Shastry-Sutherland Model under Magnetic Field
Authors: Menghan Song, Chengkang Zhou, Cheng Huang, Zi Yang Meng
Abstract: Motivated by the recent experimental discovery of the $T$-linear specific heat in pressurized and magnetized Shastry-Sutherland Mott insulator SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$, we perform the state-of-the-art thermal tensor-network computation on the Shastry-Sutherland model under a magnetic field. Our simulation results suggest the existence of a symmetric intermediate phase with $T$-linear specific heat at low temperature, occupying a large parameter space and separating the plaquette-singlet phase and antiferromagnetic phase at low fields and other symmetry-breaking phases at high fields before the system is fully polarized. Such an unexpected novel state bears an astonishing similarity to the experimental findings in the material. It opens the door to further investigations of the possible liberation of deconfined magnetized Dirac spinons by the competing interactions in this highly frustrated quantum magnet model, and by the combined effects of magnetic field and pressure in the the associated Shastry-Sutherland Mott insulator SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$.

Title: Quantum Spin-1/2 Rings Built from [2]Triangulene Molecular Units

Abstract: Quantum spin rings represent fundamental model systems that exhibit distinctive quantum phenomena-such as quantum critical behavior and quasiparticle excitations-arising from their periodic boundary conditions and enhanced quantum fluctuations. Here, we report the on-surface synthesis and atomic-scale characterization of antiferromagnetic S=1/2 quantum spin rings composed of pristine and unmodified [2]triangulene units on a Au(111) surface. Using stepwise on-surface synthesis followed by STM tip-induced dehydrogenation, we precisely constructed cyclic five- and six-membered spin rings and investigated their spin states via scanning probe microscopy and multireference calculations. Nc-AFM imaging reveals that the six-membered ring retains a planar geometry, whereas the five-membered ring exhibits pronounced structural distortion. The six-membered ring hosts a uniform excitation gap that can be accurately described by a Heisenberg spin model and multireference CASCI calculations. In contrast, the distorted five-membered ring displays spin ground states with asymmetric spatial distributions due to degeneracy lifting induced by structural distortion. Our findings establish a versatile molecular platform for exploring correlated magnetism and quantum spin phenomena in cyclic organic magnetic architectures with disorder.

Title: Strain-Driven Altermagnetic Spin Splitting Effect in RuO$_2$
Authors: Seungjun Lee, Seung Gyo Jeong, Jian-Ping Wang, Bharat Jalan, Tony Low
Abstract: The non-relativistic spin-momentum locking in altermagnets gives rise to a time-reversal-odd spin Hall effect, known as the altermagnetic spin-splitting effect (ASSE). Although ASSE was first reported in RuO$_2$, subsequent experiments have yielded inconsistent results, leaving its spin-transport mechanism unclear. Here, we systematically investigate how strain, crystal orientation, and the Hubbard $U$ parameter influence the magnetic ground state and spin Hall response of RuO$_2$. Guided by recent experimental observations, we find that $U$ is likely smaller than the value required to induce intrinsic magnetism, suggesting that bulk RuO$_2$ and (001)/(101) RuO$_2$ thin films grown on TiO$_2$ are nonmagnetic in the absence of extrinsic effects. In contrast, (100) and (110) films exhibit strain-induced altermagnetic spin splitting, leading to a strong ASSE even without Hubbard $U$ corrections. These results reconcile previous experimental discrepancies and provide design guidelines for RuO$_2$-based spintronic devices.

Title: Quantization Mapping on Dirac Dynamics via Voltage-Driven Charge Density in Monolayer Graphene: A Klein Paradox and Entropy-Ruled Wavevector Mechanics Study
Authors: Karuppuchamy Navamani
Abstract: Thermodynamics coupled with quantum features on electron and hole dynamics in Dirac materials is quite interesting and crucial for real device applications. The correlation between the formation of electron-hole puddles in nearer to the charge neutrality point (CNP), and the role of disorder is fundamentally important for Dirac transport in graphene systems. Numerous studies on graphene further urge the necessity to find a better descriptor for disorder-charge puddles relation, which directly influences electrical conductivity. In principle, the external bias-driven energy level shift and its relevant density of states (DOS) provide information about the effect of total interactive potential on linear energy dispersion in terms of wavevector, but yet to be well-explored. With this ground, here we map the energy quantization for Dirac materials through the empirical relation of voltage-driven charge density in monolayer graphene, using the differential entropy (h)-ruled wavevector (k) mechanics. For this work, we propose the four postulates which are the key observable descriptions of earlier research reports, to study the precise electronic transport via an entropy-guided wavevector propagation approach, along with the Klein paradox, which pertains to the ultrafast dynamics in the Dirac or quasi-Dirac systems. The introduced h-ruled k and h-ruled N relations generalize the electron dynamics in both the unbounded and potentially bounded Dirac systems. Through the quantization mapping procedure under different voltage-driven potential (U=eV) boundary conditions, the observed energy shift from lower to excited quantum state obeys the relation of N(k)=N(U)^3; here, N(U) is the voltage-driven potential energy contribution factor for the quantum state existence. This study reveals information about the interaction potential-DOS relationship in the Dirac materials.

Title: Quantum-geometric thermal conductivity of superconductors
Authors: Maximilian Buthenhoff, Yusuke Nishida
Abstract: By coupling Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory with isolated bands to an external gravitomagnetic vector potential via a gravitomagnetic Peierls substitution, we identify a quantum-geometric contribution to the electronic contribution of the thermal conductivity. This contribution is governed by the quantum metric in the parameter space spanned by the components of the external gravitomagnetic vector potential which corresponds to a weighted quantum metric in momentum space. In the flat-band limit, we establish an upper and lower Wiedemann-Franz-type bound for the ratio of thermal Meissner stiffness and electric Meissner stiffness (superfluid weight), whose prefactors are provided by the extrema of the squared energy offsets of the outer single-particle bands of the system. Similarly to the superfluid weight, this also leads to a lower bound of the thermal Meissner stiffness in terms of the Chern number. Our results apply to both superconductors and other fermionic superfluids.

Title: Spin-Chain Incipient Magnetocaloric Effect and Rare-Earth Controlled Switching in the Haldane-Chain System, R2BaNiO5
Authors: Mohit Kumar, Gourab Roy, Sayan Ghosh, Ekta Kushwaha, Kiran Singh, Tathamay Basu
Abstract: We have experimentally investigated the magnetocaloric effect (MCE) of a prototype spin-frustrated one-dimensional spin-chain system, the famous Haldane-chain system, R2BaNiO5 (R = Nd, Gd, Er, Dy). The significant MCE is observed far above long-range ordering, even in the paramagnetic region, which is attributed to the change in magnetic entropy due to short-range spin correlation arising from (low-dimensional) magnetic frustration. Such a spin-chain incipient MCE above long-range ordering is rarely reported. Interestingly, multiple magnetocaloric switching from conventional to inverse MCE (and vice versa) are observed below long-range magnetic ordering, as a function of temperature and magnetic field, for the R = Nd, Dy, and Er members. However, such MCE switching is absent in the Gd member, which is an S-state atom (orbital moment L = 0). Our systematic investigation of this series demonstrates that the interplay between crystal-electric field (CEF), strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and rare earth anisotropy of R-ions play an important role in spin reorientation, leading to multiple MCE switching due to intriguing changes in magnetic and lattice entropy. The maximum change of entropy for Er, Gd, Dy and Nd is 7.8, 6.8, 4.0 and 1.0 J Kg-1 K-1 respectively. Our study presents a pathway for tuning MCE switching and the MCE effect over large temperature regions in d-f coupled spin-frustrated and spin-chain oxide systems.

Title: First-order phase transition in atom-molecule quantum degenerate mixtures with coherent three-body recombination
Authors: G. A. Bougas, A. Vardi, H. R. Sadeghpour, C. Chin, S. I. Mistakidis
Abstract: We map the phase diagram of a two-mode atom-molecule Bose-Einstein condensate with Fano-Feshbach and coherent three-body recombination (cTBR) terms. The standard second order phase transition observed as the molecular energy is tuned through the Feshbach resonance, is replaced by a first order transition when cTBR becomes prominent, due to a double-well structure in the free energy landscape. This transition is associated with atom-molecule entanglement, bistability, and molecular metastability. Our results establish cTBR as a powerful knob for quantum state engineering and control of reaction dynamics in ultracold chemistry.

Title: Epitaxial Growth and Anomalous Hall Effect in High-Quality Altermagnetic $α$-MnTe Thin Films
Authors: Tian-Hao Shao, Xingze Dai, Wenyu Hu, Ming-Yuan Zhu, Yuanqiang He, Lin-He Yang, Jingjing Liu, Meng Yang, Xiang-Rui Liu, Jing-Jing Shi, Tian-Yi Xiao, Yu-Jie Hao, Xiao-Ming Ma, Yue Dai, Meng Zeng, Qinwu Gao, Gan Wang, Junxue Li, Chao Wang, Chang Liu
Abstract: The recent identification of $\alpha$-MnTe as a candidate altermagnet has attracted considerable interest, particularly for its potential application in magnetic random-access memory. However, the development of high-quality thin films - essential for practical implementation - has remained limited. Here, we report the epitaxial growth of centimeter-scale $\alpha$-MnTe thin films on InP(111) substrates via molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Through X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, we construct a MnTe phase diagram that provides clear guidance for stabilizing the pure $\alpha$-MnTe phase, revealing that it is favored under high Te/Mn flux ratios and elevated growth temperatures. Cross-sectional electron microscopy confirms an atomically sharp film-substrate interface, consistent with a layer-by-layer epitaxial growth mode. Remarkably, these high-quality $\alpha$-MnTe films exhibit a pronounced anomalous Hall effect (AHE) originating from Berry curvature, despite a net magnetic moment approaching zero - a signature of robust altermagnetic character. Our work establishes a viable route for synthesizing wafer-scale $\alpha$-MnTe thin films and highlights their promise for altermagnet-based spintronics and magnetic sensing.

Title: Ordered states of undoped AB bilayer graphene: bias induced cascade of transitions
Authors: A.V. Rozhkov, A.O. Sboychakov, A.L. Rakhmanov
Abstract: Using mean-field theory, we determine the electronic phase diagram of undoped AB-stacked bilayer graphene in the presence of a transverse electric field. In addition to multiple competing electronic instabilities characterized by excitonic order parameters, our framework incorporates the long-range Coulomb energy associated with interlayer polarization. This long-range interaction plays a crucial role, as it significantly influences both the structure and the relative energies of the competing ordered states. We derive a set of self-consistency equations and solve them both numerically and analytically. Our findings reveal that, as the bias field is varied, the bilayer undergoes a cascade of first-order transitions between several ordered insulating phases for which order-parameter structures are explicitly identified. Some of these phases are characterized by two inequivalent single-particle gaps, whose magnitudes depend on the valley and spin quantum numbers. Field-driven transitions are accompanied by discontinuous and non-monotonic variations of the single-electron gap. We relate our results to Hartree-Fock numerical calculations and to experimental research, including observations of fractional metallic phases that emerge upon doping the bilayer system.

Title: Emergent spin-resolved electronic charge density waves and pseudogap phenomena from strong $d$-wave altermagnetism
Authors: Fei Yang, Guo-Dong Zhao, Binghai Yan, Long-Qing Chen
Abstract: Inspired by recent discovery of metallic $d$-wave altermagnetism in KV$_2$Se$_2$O, we develop a self-consistent microscopic many-body calculation of density-wave order for an itinerant altermagnetic metal. We show that the strong $d$-wave spin-momentum locking inherent to the altermagnetic band structure reconstructs the Fermi surface into spin-selective quasi-1D open sheets. This unique topology of Fermi surface drives an instability toward spin-resolved electronic charge density waves (CDWs), in which the ordering wave vectors for spin-up and spin-down electrons condense along two mutually orthogonal directions, forming spin-resolved stripe phases. As a consequence, this results in pronounced gap openings near the Fermi surface, and the superposition of these spin-resolved stripe orders leads to a checkerboard CDW in the charge channel and an antiphase spin-density-wave modulation in the spin channel. Upon increasing temperature, the density-wave order melts at $T_c$ due to thermal phase fluctuation while the gap opening persists, giving rise to a robust pseudogap regime, which eventually closes at a higher temperature $T_g$. The resulting simulations quantitatively reproduce the key features observed in the spectroscopic measurements, offering a consistent and generic understanding of the reported phenomena in KV$_2$Se$_2$O and, more broadly, in metallic altermagnets with strong spin-momentum locking.

Title: Symmetry Spans and Enforced Gaplessness
Authors: Takamasa Ando, Kantaro Ohmori
Abstract: Anomaly matching for continuous symmetries has been the primary tool for establishing symmetry enforced gaplessness - the phenomenon where global symmetry alone forces a quantum system to be gapless in the infrared. We introduce a new mechanism based on \textit{symmetry spans}: configurations in which a global symmetry $\mathcal{E}$ is simultaneously embedded into two larger symmetries, as $\mathcal{D}\hookleftarrow\mathcal{E}\hookrightarrow\mathcal{C}$. Any gapped phase with the full symmetry must, upon restriction to $\mathcal{E}$, arise as the restriction of both a gapped $\mathcal{C}$-symmetric phase and a gapped $\mathcal{D}$-symmetric phase. When no such compatible phase exists, gaplessness is enforced. This mechanism can operate with only discrete and non-anomalous continuous symmetries in the UV, both of which admit well-understood lattice realizations. We construct explicit symmetry spans enforcing gaplessness in 1+1 dimensions, exhibit their realization in conformal field theories, and provide lattice Hamiltonians with the relevant symmetry embeddings.

Title: Rust-accelerated powder X-ray diffraction simulation for high-throughput and machine-learning-driven materials science
Authors: Miroslav Lebeda, Jan Drahokoupil, Petr Veřtát, Petr Vlčák
Abstract: High-throughput powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) simulations are a key prerequisite for generating large datasets used in the development of machine-learning models for XRD-based materials analysis. However, the widely used pymatgen powder XRD calculator, implemented entirely in Python, can be computationally inefficient for large-scale workloads, limiting throughput. We present XRD-Rust, a Rust-accelerated implementation of the pymatgen powder XRD calculator that maintains full compatibility with existing Python-based workflows. The method retains pymatgen for crystal structure handling and symmetry analysis while reimplementing the computationally intensive parts of the XRD calculation in Rust. Performance benchmarks were carried out on large crystallographic datasets from the Materials Cloud Three-Dimensional Structure Database (MC3D, 33 142 structures) and the Crystallography Open Database (COD 515 181). For the MC3D dataset, XRD-Rust achieves an average speedup of 4.7 +- 1.6 and a maximum speedup of 25, reducing computation from 34.9 s to 1.4 s. For the COD dataset, the average speedup is 6.1 +- 4.6 with a maximum speedup of 719 (1437 min to 2 min). These benchmarks demonstrate that XRD-Rust significantly accelerates powder XRD simulations, enabling efficient high-throughput dataset generation and improved performance in interactive diffraction analysis applications.

Title: Emergence of a spin Hall topological Hall effect in the non-collinear phase of the ferrimagnetic insulator terbium-iron garnet
Authors: Mehak Loyal, Akashdeep Akashdeep, Edoardo Mangini, Edgar Galíndez-Ruales, Maja Eich, Nan Wang, Qianqian Lan, Lei Jin, Rafal Dunin-Borkowski, Timo Kuschel, Mathias Kläui, Gerhard Jakob
Abstract: Magnetic compensation in rare-earth iron garnets (REIGs) offers a unique setting for which competing sublattice moments can give rise to non-collinear (canted) magnetic configurations, in which the sublattice magnetizations are not aligned with each other or with the external magnetic field. We show that this compensation regime can also host non-trivial magnetic textures. To explore this behavior, we investigated (111)-oriented epitaxial Tb$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$/Pt heterostructures across the compensation temperature region using combined transverse magneto-transport and polar Kerr microscopy. Notably, we observe a topological Hall-like signal in the vicinity of the compensation temperature, a feature often interpreted as evidence for skyrmions in the absence of direct imaging. Here, in contrast, complementary Kerr microscopy reveals instead a non-collinear multidomain state which collapses outside the compensation regime, correlating directly with the appearance and disappearance of the spin Hall topological Hall effect (SH-THE) signal. These observations cannot be accounted for by a simple multi-anomalous-Hall-effect model, ruling out common artifacts as the origin, but indicate the presence of a topologically non-trivial contribution to the Hall response. These results establish strained REIG films as a tunable platform for exploring topological responses arising from compensation-driven non-collinear ferrimagnetic phases.

Title: Phase-Space Topology and Spectral Flow in Screened Magnetized Plasmas
Authors: Xianhao Rao, Adil Yolbarsop, Hong Li, Wandong Liu
Abstract: Topological wave phenomena in continuous media are fundamentally challenged by unbounded spectra and the absence of a compact Brillouin zone, which obstruct conventional bulk--interface formulations. We develop a unified phase-space framework for screened magnetized plasma based on a pseudo-Hermitian formulation with a positive-definite metric, enabling a generalized Schrödinger description and a Weyl-symbol analysis of the bulk generator. We show that the bulk symbol hosts isolated band degeneracies acting as Berry--Chern monopoles, including a higher-order spin-1 degeneracy with topological charge $+2$ that generically splits into two spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ Weyl points under symmetry breaking. To characterize topology in this noncompact setting, we introduce a strip-gap Chern number associated with finite real-frequency strips of the bulk spectrum, extending band Chern topology to continuum systems. This invariant governs the spectral flow of interface modes induced by spatial variations of the magnetic field and establishes a bulk--interface correspondence at the level of phase-space symbols. By solving the interface eigenvalue problem, we demonstrate that the net spectral flow across the strip gap is determined by the enclosed monopole charge. We further show that this correspondence persists under collisional damping, provided that a finite strip gap remains and no exceptional points enter it. Our results provide a systematic phase-space framework for topological wave transport in continuous media beyond compact-band and idealized Hermitian settings.

Title: Stacking-dependent magnetic ordering in bilayer ScI$_{2}$
Authors: Soumyajit Sarkar, Soham Chandra
Abstract: Stacking-dependent magnetism in two-dimensional van der Waals materials offers an effective route for controlling magnetic order without chemical modification. Here, we present a combined first-principles and finite-temperature study of magnetic ordering in bilayer ScI$_{2}$ with different stacking configurations. Using density functional theory with Hubbard-U corrections, we investigate the structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of monolayer and bilayer ScI$_{2}$ in $AA$, $AB$, and $BA$ stackings. The electronic structure exhibits a spin-polarized ground state dominated by Sc-$d$ states near the Fermi level. Mapping total energies onto an effective Heisenberg spin Hamiltonian reveals strong intralayer ferromagnetic exchange that is largely insensitive to stacking, while the inter-layer exchange depends strongly on stacking geometry, favoring ferromagnetic coupling for $AA$ and $BA$ stackings and antiferromagnetic coupling for the $AB$ stacking. Spin-orbit coupling calculations show that both monolayer and bilayer ScI$_{2}$ possess a robust out-of-plane magnetic easy axis. Finite-temperature Monte Carlo simulations indicate that all bilayer configurations sustain magnetic ordering at and above room temperature, with ordering temperatures in the range $360-375$ K, as confirmed by Binder cumulant analysis and finite-size scaling. These results demonstrate that stacking geometry enables control of the magnetic ground state in bilayer ScI$_{2}$ without significantly affecting its thermal stability.

Title: Early stages of collective cell invasion: Biomechanics
Authors: R. González-Albaladejo, M. Carretero, L. L. Bonilla
Abstract: The early stages of the collective invasion may occur by single mesenchymal cells or hybrid epithelial-mesenchymal cell groups that detach from cancerous tissue. Tumors may also emit invading protrusions of epithelial cells, which could be led (or not) by a basal cell. Here we devise a fractional step cellular Potts model comprising passive and active cells able to describe these different types of collective invasion before cells start proliferating. Durotaxis and active forces have different symmetry properties and are included in different half steps of the fractional step method. Compared with a single step method, fractional step produces more realistic cellular invasion scenarios with little extra computational effort. Biochemical mechanisms that determine how cells acquire their different phenotypes and cellular proliferation will be incorporated to the model in future publications.

Title: Parity-dependent double degeneracy and spectral statistics in the projected dice lattice
Authors: Koushik Swaminathan, Anouar Moustaj, Jose L. Lado, Sebastiano Peotta
Abstract: We investigate the spectral statistics of an interacting fermionic system derived by projecting the Hubbard interaction onto the two lowest-energy, degenerate flat bands of the dice lattice subjected to a $\pi$-flux. Surprisingly, the distributions of level spacings and gap ratios correspond to distinct Gaussian ensembles, depending on the parity of the particle number. For an even number of particles, the spectra conform to the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble, as expected for a time-reversal-symmetric Hamiltonian. In stark contrast, the odd-parity sector exhibits exact double degeneracy of all eigenstates even after resolving all known symmetries, and the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble accurately describes the spacing distribution between these doublets. The simultaneous emergence of two different random-matrix ensembles within a single physical system constitutes an unprecedented finding, opening new avenues for both random matrix theory and flat-band physics.

Title: Phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo method with spin-orbit coupling
Authors: Zheng Liu, Shiwei Zhang, Fengjie Ma
Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is incorporated into the phaseless plane-wave-based auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (pw-AFQMC) method. This integration is implemented using optimized multiple-projector norm-conserving pseudopotentials, which are derived from the fully-relativistic (FR) atomic all-electron Dirac-like equation. The inclusion of SOC enables accurate phaseless pw-AFQMC calculations that capture both electronic correlation and SOC effects concurrently, greatly improving the method's applicability for studying systems containing heavy atoms. We discuss the form of FR pseudopotentials and detail the corresponding formulations of phaseless pw-AFQMC with a two-component Hamiltonian in the spinor basis. The accuracy of our approach is demonstrated by computing the dissociation energy of molecule I2 and the cohesive energy of bulk Pb, highlighting the large influence of SOC in both. Subsequently, we determine the transition pressure of the III-V compound InP from its zinc-blende to rock-salt phase by constructing and analyzing their respective equations of state.

Title: Emergence of charge and spin current in non-Hermitian quantum ring
Authors: Soumya Ranjan Padhi, Souvik Roy, Tapan Mishra
Abstract: We investigate the charge and spin transport in a non-Hermitian ring of electrons subject to an external Zeeman field. By introducing non-Hermiticity through anti-Hermitian hopping in the nearest neighbour bonds, we demonstrate that anti-Hermiticity, along with the applied Zeeman field significantly modify the energy spectrum and strongly influence transport properties. As a result, we obtain that when antiferromagnetic Zeeman field is considered, a finite charge current emerges in both the real and imaginary parts of the current, which are in contrast to the ferromagnetic case where only the imaginary current exist. On the other hand, in both cases, the spin current vanishes. Interestingly, we reveal an emergence and strong enhancement of spin currents under balanced spin population upon introducing quasiperiodicity in the presence of antiferromagnetic ordering. At the same time, the charge current also exhibits substantial enhancement due to quasiperiodic modulation. These results highlight non-Hermitian quantum rings as versatile platforms for unconventional spin-charge transport.

Title: Microscopic field theory for active Brownian particles with translational and rotational inertia
Authors: Michael te Vrugt
Abstract: While active matter physics has traditionally focused on particles with overdamped dynamics, recent years have seen an increase of experimental and theoretical work on active systems with inertia. This also leads to an increased need for theoretical models that describe inertial active dynamics. Here, we present a microscopic derivation for a general continuum model describing the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of inertial active matter that generalizes several previously existing works. It applies to particles with translational and rotational inertia and contains particle density, velocity, angular velocity, temperature, polarization, velocity polarization, and angular velocity polarization as dynamical variables. We moreover discuss to which extend commonly used approximations (factorization and local equilibrium) used in the derivation of hydrodynamic models are applicable to inertial active matter.

Title: Emergence of a Helical Metal in Rippled Ultrathin Topological Insulator Sb\textsubscript{2}Te\textsubscript{3} on Graphene
Authors: Francisco Munoz, Manuel Fuenzalida, Paula Mellado, Hari C. Manoharan, Valentina Gallardo, Carolina Parra
Abstract: The integration of topological insulators (TIs) with graphene offers a pathway to engineer hybrid quantum states, yet the impact of strain at the 2D limit remains a critical open question. Here, we investigate the structural properties of ultrathin (1 quintuple layer) Sb$_2$Te$_3$ grown on single-layer graphene and, motivated by the structural modulations observed at the TI surface, explore theoretically how such nanoscale corrugations may influence the electronic behavior of the system. Using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (LT-STM), we observe a periodic rippling of the heterostructure with a wavelength of ~$\sim8.7$ nm. Energetic analysis reveals that these ripples are not intrinsic but are driven by strain from the substrate during cooling. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that while the ideal flat heterostructure exhibits a hybridization gap of $\sim40$ meV, the ripple-induced structural modulation closes this gap, restoring a metallic state. This gapless phase is not a trivial metal. By combining an effective moiré ladder model with spin-resolved DFT, we find that the proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling is redistributed across a dense manifold of minibands. The resulting ``Helical Metal'' has a complex spin-texture beyond a simple Rashba splitting. Remarkably, while the flat system is effectively spinless in this ultrathin limit due to hybridization, the ripples actively restore the spin polarization. Our findings suggest that rippled TI/graphene heterostructures provide an interesting platform to develop spintronics, where geometric modulation unlocks dense helical states that are inaccessible in the pristine flat limit.

Title: Proposal for realizing unpaired Weyl points in a three-dimensional periodically driven optical Raman lattice
Authors: Xiao-Dong Lin, Jinyi Zhang, Long Zhang
Abstract: In static lattice systems, the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem enforces the pairing of Weyl points with opposite chiralities, which precludes the chiral magnetic effect (CME) in equilibrium. Periodic driving provides a viable route to circumvent this no-go constraint. Here, we propose a scheme to realize and control unpaired Weyl points using ultracold atoms in a three-dimensional (3D) optical Raman lattice under continuous periodic driving. By engineering distinct relative symmetries between the lattice and multiple Raman potentials, the configuration generates an effective 3D spin-orbit coupling and yields a tunable topological-insulator phase. Through adiabatic periodic modulation of this system, we show that eight Weyl points emerge in the quasienergy spectrum of the low-energy sector, whose net chirality can be precisely tuned. A nonzero total chirality directly corresponds to the formation of unpaired Weyl points. Furthermore, by implementing a synthetic magnetic field via laser-assisted tunneling in this setup, we demonstrate that the chirality imbalance drives a quantized charge current in the weak-field regime, providing a direct signature of the CME. We verify that the adiabatic condition of the driving protocol, as well as the proposed experimental preparation and detection techniques, are within reach of current ultracold-atom experiments. This work establishes a realistic and controllable platform for exploring chiral-anomaly physics and nonequilibrium topological phenomena linked to Weyl fermions.

Title: Melting of quantum Hall Wigner and bubble crystals
Authors: H. Xia, Qianhui Xu, Jiasen Niu, Jian Sun, Yang Liu, L. N. Pfeiffer, K. W. West, Pengjie Wang, Bo Yang, Xi Lin
Abstract: A two-dimensional crystal melts via the proliferation and unbinding of topological defects, yet quantitatively predicting the melting temperature $T_m$ in real systems is challenging. Here we resolve this discrepancy in quantum Hall electron bubble phases by combining Corbino-geometry transport experiment in an ultraclean GaAs/AlGaAs quantum well for Landau levels 2 to 5 with Hartree--Fock elasticity and the full Kosterlitz--Thouless--Halperin--Nelson--Young melting criterion including the finite-temperature renormalization-group calculation. The theoretically obtained $T_m$ quantitatively captures the measured solid-liquid phase transition boundaries across all probed ranges, validating the bubble-crystal interpretation and establishing defect--mediated melting as a predictive framework for strongly interacting electronic solids. This agreement further supports using bulk transport to probe the energetics of topological defects and screening in quantum Hall physics, and the approach is readily extendable to other electronic crystals, including the generalized Wigner crystal in moiré Chern bands.

Title: RING: Rabi oscillations induced by nonresonant geometric drive
Authors: Baksa Kolok, András Pályi
Abstract: Coherent control of two-level quantum systems is typically achieved using resonant driving fields, forming the basis for qubit operations. Here, we report a mechanism for inducing complete Rabi oscillations in monochromatically driven two-level quantum systems, when the drive frequency is much larger than the Larmor frequency of the qubit. This effect$\unicode{x2015}$Rabi oscillations induced by nonresonant geometric drive (RING)$\unicode{x2015}$requires that the control field is elliptical, enclosing a nonzero area per cycle. We illustrate the effect with numerical simulations, and provide an analytical understanding via a simple effective Hamiltonian obtained from Floquet theory and perturbation theory. We show that RING enables coherent oscillations without relying on resonant energy exchange, allows for high-pass noise filtering, provides access to non-Abelian phases in finite magnetic fields. We detail a realization in electrically driven spin-orbit qubits and argue that the RING mechanism enables amplification of the Rabi frequency using the same gate voltage amplitudes at higher drive frequencies. Our results broaden the landscape of quantum control techniques, by highlighting a pathway to achieving coherent oscillations under off-resonant driving conditions.

Title: Dynamics and thermodynamics of the S = 5/2 almost-Heisenberg triangular lattice antiferromagnet K2Mn(SeO3)2
Authors: Mengze Zhu, V. Romerio, D. Moser, K. Yu. Povarov, R. Sibille, R. Wawrzynczak, Z. Yan, S. Gvasaliya, A. L. Chernyshev, A. Zheludev
Abstract: We report calorimetric, magnetic, and neutron scattering studies on an S = 5/2, nearly Heisenberg triangular-lattice antiferromagnet K2Mn(SeO3)2 with weak XXZ easy-axis anisotropy. Multiple magnetic phases are identified, including a non-collinear Y phase in zero field, a field-induced collinear m = 1/3 magnetization plateau, and a high-field V phase. In the Y phase, the magnetic excitation spectrum exhibits both single-magnon excitations and an extended high-energy continuum. Both features are well described by non-linear spin wave theory. In the field-induced phases, complex effects of the spectrum renormalization even for large S = 5/2 material are clearly detectable. These results underscore the essential role of magnon-magnon interactions in the dynamics of large-S Heisenberg spin systems on a triangular lattice.

Title: Topological chiral random walker
Authors: Saeed Osat, Ellen Meyberg, Jakob Metson, Thomas Speck
Abstract: Understanding how biological and synthetic systems achieve robust function in noisy environments remains a fundamental challenge across the physical and life sciences. To connect robust behavior with non-trivial topological features present already in the dynamics of individual units, here we introduce the topological chiral random walker (TCRW) model. While exploring the system, a TCRW locates edges and boundaries in the system and develops topologically protected edge currents even in the presence of defects and disorder. Drawing on the bulk-boundary correspondence found in hard condensed matter systems allows us to rationalize the emergence of robust edge currents through topological features of the dynamic spectrum. We show that chiral motion and rotational noise with opposite chirality are two crucial components in our inherently non-Hermitian model. As proofs of principle, we first show that a topological walker outperforms diffusive motion to efficiently solve complex mazes due to its property of remaining on the edge with some rare detachments. Second, we use this model to design building blocks that can perform efficient self-assembly overcoming the timescale bottlenecks of diffusion-limited growth and reducing self-assembly times by approximately 80%.

Title: Thermodynamic Stability and Hydrogen Bonds in Mixed Halide Perovskites
Authors: Liz Camayo-Gutierrez, Javiera Ubeda, Ana L. Montero-Alejo, Ricardo Grau-Crespo, Eduardo Menéndez-Proupin
Abstract: The stability of mixed halide perovskites against phase separation is crucial for their optoelectronic applications, yet difficult to rationalize due to the interplay of enthalpic, configurational, and dynamical effects. Here we present a simple thermodynamic framework for multicomponent halide perovskites of composition FA$_{1-x}$MA$_{x-y}$Cs$_y$Pb(I$_{1-z}$Br$_z$)$_3$, based on \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics. By decomposing the free energy of mixing into enthalpic, configurational, and rotational entropic contributions, we show that although the enthalpy of mixing is generally positive, the solid solutions are thermodynamically stable against phase separation due to the large configurational entropy associated with random substitution on cation and halide sublattices. Mixing reduces the rotational entropy of the organic cations, partially offsetting the configurational stabilization. However, within our model, this rotational penalty is not sufficient to overcome the configurational driving force, and a curvature analysis within a regular-solution model does not predict a miscibility gap for any of the mixing channels considered. Analysis of hydrogen-bond dynamics shows that MA--Y (Y = I, Br) interactions are more persistent than FA--Y interactions, while the dominant FA-donated N$-$H$\cdots$I hydrogen bonds remain nearly composition-invariant. Cs-containing mixtures, in which Cs$^{+}$ forms no hydrogen bonds, can nevertheless be thermodynamically stable. These results demonstrate that hydrogen bonding does not control thermodynamic stability in mixed halide perovskites. Instead, phase stability is governed by the balance between strong configurational entropy and a smaller, systematically destabilizing rotational-entropy correction.

Title: Markov State Models for Tracking Reaction Dynamics on Catalytic Nanoparticles
Authors: Caitlin A. McCandler, Chatipat Lorpaiboon, Timothy C. Berkelbach, Jutta Rogal
Abstract: Markov state models (MSMs) are a powerful tool to analyze and coarse-grain complex dynamical data into interpretable kinetic processes. This capability is particularly important in heterogeneous catalysis, where a medley of reactants and intermediates interact on surfaces that might simultaneously experience structural fluctuations. For these very complex systems, standard transition state theory (TST) approaches are no longer appropriate, motivating alternative approaches that can retain dynamical complexity while providing physical insight. With machine learned interatomic potentials being more and more ubiquitous, directly simulating complex catalytic systems with molecular dynamics (MD) is becoming increasingly feasible. Extending MSMs to dynamically coarse grain MD simulation data of catalytic processes, we analyze hydrogen dynamics on rhodium catalysts with slab and nanoparticle geometries over a range of hydrogen surface concentrations. Somewhat counterintuitively, nanoparticle features, such as corners and edges, effectively slow down the association/dissociation process, and the cooperative behavior of hydrogen-hydrogen interactions leads to a non-monotonic concentration dependence of the rates, which would not be predicted with standard TST.

Title: Non-Hermitian topology of quantum spin-Hall systems to detect edge-state polarization
Authors: Raghav Chaturvedi, Ion Cosma Fulga, Jeroen van den Brink, Ewelina M. Hankiewicz
Abstract: We study the non-Hermitian topology of multi-terminal transport in a quantum spin-Hall device described by the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model. We show that breaking time-reversal symmetry alone does not imply non-reciprocal transport or a non-Hermitian conductance matrix. Instead, non-Hermitian topology arises only when transport becomes directionally imbalanced. We identify two distinct mechanisms that generate such a response: spin-selective coupling at the contacts and an out-of-plane Zeeman field that unbalances the counter-propagating helical edge modes. We show, for unpolarized leads, that the spin polarization-dependent response to Zeeman fields, provides a transport-based probe of the intrinsic spin polarization of the helical edge states. Moreover, we demonstrate that non-Hermitian skin effect is more sensitive than conductance elements to detect the spin polarization of the edge states. Our results clarify the conditions required for non-Hermitian topology in quantum spin-Hall transport and establish non-Hermitian skin effect as a diagnostic tool for spin-selective coupling and edge-state polarization.

Title: Remarks on non-invertible symmetries on a tensor product Hilbert space in 1+1 dimensions
Authors: Kansei Inamura
Abstract: We propose an index of non-invertible symmetry operators in 1+1 dimensions and discuss its relation to the realizability of non-invertible symmetries on the tensor product of finite dimensional on-site Hilbert spaces on the lattice. Our index generalizes the Gross-Nesme-Vogts-Werner index of invertible symmetry operators represented by quantum cellular automata (QCAs). Assuming that all fusion channels of symmetry operators have the same index, we show that the fusion rules of finitely many symmetry operators on a tensor product Hilbert space can agree, up to QCAs, only with those of weakly integral fusion categories. We also discuss an attempt to establish an index theory for non-invertible symmetries within the framework of tensor networks. To this end, we first propose a general class of matrix product operators (MPOs) that describe non-invertible symmetries on a tensor product Hilbert space. These MPOs, which we refer to as topological injective MPOs, include all invertible symmetries, non-anomalous fusion category symmetries, and the Kramers-Wannier symmetries for finite abelian groups. For topological injective MPOs, we construct the defect Hilbert spaces and the corresponding sequential quantum circuit representations. We also show that all fusion channels of topological injective MPOs have the same index if there exist fusion and splitting tensors that satisfy appropriate conditions. The existence of such fusion and splitting tensors has not been proven in general, although we construct them explicitly for all examples of topological injective MPOs listed above.

Title: Bond failure in peridynamics: Nonequivalence of critical stretch and critical energy density criteria
Authors: Pablo Seleson, Pablo Raúl Stinga, Mary Vaughan
Abstract: This paper rigorously analyzes bond failure in the peridynamic theory of solid mechanics, which is a fundamental component of fracture modeling. We compare analytically and numerically two common bond-failure criteria:~{\em critical stretch} and~{\em critical energy density}. In the former, bonds fail when they stretch to a critical value, whereas in the latter, bonds fail when the bond energy density exceeds a threshold. By focusing the analysis on bond-based models, we prove mathematically that the critical stretch criterion and the critical energy density criterion are not equivalent in general and result in different bond-breaking and fracture phenomena. Numerical examples showcase the striking differences between the effect of the two criteria on crack dynamics, including the crack tip evolution, crack propagation, and crack branching.

Title: Stacking theory for bilayer two-dimensional magnets
Authors: Jun-Xi Du, Sike Zeng, Yu-Jun Zhao
Abstract: Two-dimensional unconventional magnetism has recently attracted growing interest due to its intriguing physical properties and promising applications in spintronics. However, existing studies on stacking-induced unconventional magnetism mainly focus on specific materials and stacking configurations. Here, we develop a general symmetry-based stacking theory for two-dimensional magnets. We first introduce spin layer groups as the fundamental symmetry framework, providing the essential magnetic symmetry information for the stacking theory. Based on this framework, we construct the complete set of 448 collinear spin layer groups for describing two-dimensional collinear magnets. Subsequently, we develop a general magnetic stacking theory applicable to arbitrary magnetic systems and derive its general solutions. Using CrF$_3$ as an illustrative example, we show how this theory enables designs of two-dimensional unconventional magnetism, as validated by first-principles calculations. We realize two-dimensional fully compensated ferrimagnetism through our stacking theory. Our work provides a general symmetry-guided platform for discovering and designing stacking-induced unconventional magnetism.

Title: Two-photon-assisted collisions in ultracold gases of polar molecules II : Optical shielding of ultracold polar molecular collisions
Authors: Gohar Hovhannesyan, Charbel Karam, Romain Vexiau, Leon Karpa, Maxence Lepers, Nadia Bouloufa-Maafa, Olivier Dulieu
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the collisions between ultracold polar molecules in the presence of two lasers ensuring a Raman resonant transition on individual molecules to suppress photon scattering, taking the example of bosonic $^{23}$Na$^{39}$K molecules. By varying laser detunings and intensities, we enable a repulsive long-range interaction potential between molecules. After solving a set of coupled Schrödinger equations with the Hamiltonian written in the basis of laser-dressed states of the molecule pair at infinite distance, we identify quasi-resonant conditions under which elastic collisions are favored over inelastic and reactive ones, by a factor of about 2, thus demonstrating a promising pathway for efficient two-photon optical shielding of ultracold molecular collisions. The results are analyzed in terms of scattering length of the colliding laser-dressed molecules, which exhibit prominent resonances assigned to the interaction of the entrance channel with other specific channels, consistent with the existence of a quasi-bound level of the long-range molecular pair induced by the lasers.

Title: Solvothermal vapor annealing and environmental control setup with adjustable magnetic field module for GISAXS studies
Authors: Christian Kjeldbjerg, Bo Jakobsen, Miriam Varón, Kim Lefmann, Cathrine Frandsen, Dorthe Posselt
Abstract: A compact, modular environmental control and solvothermal vapor annealing chamber designed for maintaining a controlled atmosphere with regard to solvent humidity and temperature is presented. The setup allows ex situ and in situ grazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) investigations of thin film self-assembly and reorganization. Its modular slotting system enables stable reconfiguration, including the integration of an adjustable magnetic field module. The temperature is maintained via a water-based heating and cooling loop supplemented by resistive elements, and the solvent vapor environment is regulated using a commercial controlled mixing and evaporation unit. The performance of the setup is validated through measurements of fill and quench times together with magnetic field mapping with Gauss meter measurements and finite element simulations. Further, the versatility of the setup is demonstrated with four research examples using the chamber for solvothermal vapor annealing of block copolymer thin films together with lab-based ex situ and in situ GISAXS measurements. The portable new design offers robust environmental control and flexibility for advanced thin film investigations both in the lab and at large scale facilities. The design can be adapted for grazing incidence small-angle neutron scattering, GISANS.

Title: A critical assessment of bonding descriptors for predicting materials properties
Authors: Aakash Ashok Naik, Nidal Dhamrait, Katharina Ueltzen, Christina Ertural, Philipp Benner, Gian-Marco Rignanese, Janine George
Abstract: Most machine learning models for materials science rely on descriptors based on materials compositions and structures, even though the chemical bond has been proven to be a valuable concept for predicting materials properties. Over the years, various theoretical frameworks have been developed to characterize bonding in solid-state materials. However, integrating bonding information from these frameworks into machine learning pipelines at scale has been limited by the lack of a systematically generated and validated database. Recent advances in high-throughput bonding analysis workflows have addressed this issue, and our previously computed Quantum-Chemical Bonding Database for Solid-State Materials was extended to include approximately 13,000 materials. This database is then used to derive a new set of quantum-chemical bonding descriptors. A systematic assessment is performed using statistical significance tests to evaluate how the inclusion of these descriptors influences the performance of machine-learning models that otherwise rely solely on structure- and composition-derived features. Models are built to predict elastic, vibrational, and thermodynamic properties typically associated with chemical bonding in materials. The results demonstrate that incorporating quantum-chemical bonding descriptors not only improves predictive performance but also helps identify intuitive expressions for properties such as the projected force constant and lattice thermal conductivity via symbolic regression.

Title: Elastoresistance as probe of strain-controlled entropy from Kondo scattering
Authors: Soumendra Nath Panja, Jacques G. Pontanel, Julian Kaiser, Anton Jesche, Philipp Gegenwart
Abstract: Heavy-fermion metals are prototype correlated electron systems for the study of Kondo entanglement and quantum criticality. We use the symmetry decomposed elastoresistance to uncover the fingerprints of strain-dependent Kondo scattering as function of temperature and magnetic field in the prototypical tetragonal Kondo lattice YbRh$_2$Si$_2$. By combining longitudinal and transverse resistance measurements under uniaxial strain applied along the tetragonal $[100]$ and $[110]$ directions, we obtain the elastoresistive responses in the $A_{1g}$, $B_{1g}$, and $B_{2g}$ symmetry channels. While the responses in the symmetry-breaking channels are negligible, the isotropic $A_{1g}$ elastoresistance displays characteristic sign changes and approaches huge values at low temperatures. Scaling analysis and comparison with linear thermal expansion measurements reveals that the elastoresistance probes the contribution of Kondo scattering to the strain dependence of magnetic entropy and signals strain-controlled quantum criticality upon cooling to 2 K.

Title: Protocols for a many-body phase microscope: From coherences and d-wave superconductivity to Green's functions
Authors: Christof Weitenberg, Luca Asteria, Ola Carlsson, Annabelle Bohrdt, Fabian Grusdt
Abstract: Quantum gas microscopes probe quantum many-body lattice states via projective measurements in the occupation basis, enabling access to various density and spin correlations. Phase information, however, cannot be directly obtained in these setups. Recent experiments went beyond this by measuring local current operators and local phase fluctuations. Here we propose how Fourier-space manipulation in a matter-wave microscope allows access to various long-range off-diagonal correlators in experimentally realistic settings, realizing a many-body phase microscope. We demonstrate in particular how the fermionic d-wave superconducting order parameter in arbitrary Hubbard-type models, the non-equal time Green's function yielding the spectral function, or the hidden order of composite bosons in a fractional Chern insulator can be directly measured. Our results show the great potential of matter-wave microscopy for accessing exotic correlators including phases and coherences and characterizing intriguing quantum many-body states.

Title: Magnetopological mechanics in Maxwell lattice frustrated Mott insulators
Authors: Hong-Hao Song, Pengwei Zhao, Gang v. Chen
Abstract: Topological boundary modes, a hallmark of quantum topological phases, remarkably occur in classical mechanical systems through an interesting correspondence with the quantum case. Here, we explore the Maxwell lattice frustrated Mott insulators and argue that the combination of the intrinsic spin-lattice coupling and the spin exchanges could induce the topological mechanics with topological boundary floppy modes in the phonon spectra. This mechanism and phenomena are dubbed magnetic topological mechanics, or, magnetopological mechanics in short. Focusing on a two-dimensional kagomé lattice spin model, we illustrate how strong spin-lattice coupling drives a spontaneous lattice distortion, resulting in the topological Maxwell lattice with the topological polarization and non-trivial phonon spectra. Moreover, the magnetic field, that directly changes the spin state, indirectly influences the lattice structure via the spin-lattice coupling, thereby providing a method to control the Maxwell lattice and the boundary modes. We expect this work to inspire interests in the Maxwell lattice Mott insulating materials and the coupling between lattices and electronic orders.

Title: Charged moments and symmetry-resolved entanglement from Ballistic Fluctuation Theory
Authors: Giorgio Li, Léonce Dupays, Paola Ruggiero
Abstract: The charged moments of a reduced density matrix provide a natural starting point for deriving symmetry-resolved Rényi and entanglement entropies, which quantify how entanglement is distributed among symmetry sectors in the presence of a global internal symmetry in a quantum many-body system. In this work, we study charged moments within the framework of Ballistic Fluctuation Theory (BFT). This theory describes large-scale ballistic fluctuations of conserved charges and associated currents and, by exploiting the height-field formulation of twist fields, gives access to the asymptotic behaviour of their two-point correlation functions. In Del Vecchio Del Vecchio et al. $[1]$, this approach was applied to the special case of branch-point twist fields used to compute entanglement entropies within the replica approach. Here, we extend those results by applying BFT to composite branch-point twist fields, obtained by inserting an additional gauge field. Focusing on free fermions, we derive analytic expressions for charged Rényi entropies both at equilibrium, in generalized Gibbs ensembles, and out of equilibrium following a quantum quench from $U(1)$ preserving pair producing integrable initial states. In the latter case, our results agree with the conjecture arising from the quasiparticle picture.

Title: Kagome edge states under lattice termination, spin-orbit coupling, and magnetic order
Authors: Sajid Sekh, Annica M. Black-Schaffer, Andrzej Ptok
Abstract: We study the edge state properties of a two-dimensional kagome lattice using a tight-binding approach, focusing on the role of lattice termination, spin-orbit coupling, and magnetic order. In the pristine limit, we show that the existence of localized edge states is highly sensitive to boundary geometry, with certain terminations completely suppressing edge modes. Kane-Mele spin-orbit coupling opens a bulk gap and stabilizes topologically protected helical edge states, yielding a robust $\mathbb{Z}_2$ insulating phase that is insensitive to termination details. In contrast, the combined effect of a Zeeman field and Rashba spin-orbit coupling drives the system into Chern insulating phases, with Chern numbers consistent with the number of chiral edge modes. We further demonstrate that non-coplanar magnetic textures generate multiple Chern phases through finite scalar spin chirality, with Kane-Mele coupling strongly tuning the topological gaps. Our results provide important insights into the tunability of edge states in the kagome lattice, which can be key to designing materials with novel electronic properties and topological phases.

Title: Second excited state of ${}^4\mathrm{He}$ tetramer
Authors: A. Deltuva
Abstract: The four-boson universality suggests the existence of the second excited tetramer state in a system of cold ${}^4\mathrm{He}$ atoms. It is not bound but could be seen as a resonance in the atom-trimer scattering. This process is rigorously calculated using the momentum-space transition operator framework with two realistic interatomic potentials. The $S$-wave phase shift and cross section show a resonant behavior below the excited trimer threshold, but there are sizable nonresonant contributions from $P$ and $D$ waves as well. The position and width of the resonant state is determined, and for the latter significant finite-range effects are found.

Title: Simultaneous High-Fidelity Readout and Strong Coupling for a Donor-Based Spin Qubit
Authors: Si Yan Koh, Weifan Wu, Kelvin Onggadinata, Arghya Maity, Mark Chiyuan Ma, Calvin Pei Yu Wong, Kuan Eng Johnson Goh, Bent Weber, Hui Khoon Ng, Teck Seng Koh
Abstract: Superconducting resonators coupled to solid-state qubits offer a scalable architecture for long-range entangling operations and fast, high-fidelity readout. Realizing this requires low photon-loss rates and qubits with tunable electric dipole moments that couple strongly to the resonator's electric field while maintaining long coherence times. For spin qubits, spin-photon coupling is typically achieved via spin-charge hybridization. However, this introduces a fundamental trade-off: a large spin-charge admixture enhances the coupling strength, which boosts readout and resonator-mediated gate speeds, but exposes the qubit to increased decoherence, thereby increasing the threshold required for strong coupling and limiting the time available for accurate state measurement. This makes it essential to identify optimal operating points for each qubit platform. We address this for the donor-based flip-flop qubit, whose microwave-controllable electron-nuclear spin states make it suitable for coupling to microwave resonators. We demonstrate that, by choosing intermediate tunnel couplings that balance strong interaction with long qubit lifetimes, high-fidelity readout and strong coupling are simultaneously achievable. We also map out the respective charge-photon couplings and photon-loss rates required. Furthermore, we show that experimental constraints on charge-photon coupling and photon loss can be mitigated using squeezed input fields. As similar trade-offs appear in quantum-dot-based qubits, our methods and insights extend naturally to these platforms, offering a potential route toward scalable architectures.

Title: A Stochastic Cluster Expansion for Electronic Correlation in Large Systems
Authors: Annabelle Canestraight, Anthony J. Dominic, Andres Montoya-Castillo, Libor Veis, Vojtech Vlcek
Abstract: Accurate many-body treatments of condensed-phase systems are challenging because correlated solvers such as full configuration interaction (FCI) and the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) scale exponentially with system size. Downfolding and embedding approaches mitigate this cost but typically require prior selection of a correlated subspace, which can be difficult to determine in heterogeneous or extended systems. Here, we introduce a stochastic cluster expansion framework for efficiently recovering the total correlation energy of large systems with near-DMRG accuracy, without the need to select an active space a priori. By combining correlation contributions from randomly sampled environment orbitals with an exactly treated subspace of interest, the method reproduces total energies for non-reacting and reactive systems while drastically reducing computational cost. The approach also provides a quantitative diagnostic for molecule-solvent correlation, guiding principled embedding decisions. This framework enables systematically improvable many-body calculations in extended systems, opening the door to high-accuracy studies of chemical processes in condensed phase environments.

Title: Lightweight Error-Correction Code Encoders in Superconducting Electronic Systems
Authors: Yerzhan Mustafa, Berker Peköz, Selçuk Köse
Abstract: Data transmission from superconducting electronic circuits, such as single flux quantum (SFQ) logic, to room-temperature electronics is susceptible to bit errors, which may result from flux trapping, fabrication defects, and process parameter variations (PPV). Due to the cooling power budget at 4.2 K and constraints on the chip area, the size of the error-correction code encoders is limited. In this work, three lightweight error-correction code encoders are proposed that are based on Hamming(7,4), Hamming(8,4), and Reed-Muller(1,3) codes and implemented with SFQ logic. The performance of these encoders is analyzed in the presence of PPV. The trade-offs between the theoretical complexity and physical size of error-correction code encoders are identified.

Title: Predicting the post-wildfire mudflow onset using machine learning models on multi-parameter experimental data
Authors: Mahta Movasat, Ingrid Tomac
Abstract: Post-wildfire mudflows are increasingly hazardous due to the prevalence of wildfires, including those on the wildland-urban interface. Upon burning, soil on the surface or immediately beneath becomes hydrophobic, a phenomenon that occurs predominantly on sand-based hillslopes. Rainwater and eroded soil blanket the downslope, leading to catastrophic debris flows. Soil hydrophobicity enhances erosion, resulting in post-wildfire debris flows that differ from natural mudflows in intensity, duration, and destructiveness. Thus, it is crucial to understand the timing and conditions of debris-flow onset, driven by the coupled effects of critical parameters: varying rain intensities (RI), slope gradients, water-entry values, and grain sizes (D50). Machine Learning (ML) techniques have become increasingly valuable in geotechnical engineering due to their ability to model complex systems without predefined assumptions. This study applies multiple ML algorithms: multiple linear regression (MLR), logistic regression (LR), support vector classifier (SVC), K-means clustering, and principal component analysis (PCA) to predict and classify outcomes from laboratory experiments that model field conditions using a rain device on various soils in sloped flumes. While MLR effectively predicted total discharge, erosion predictions were less accurate, especially for coarse sand. LR and SVC achieved good accuracy in classifying failure outcomes, supported by clustering and dimensionality reduction. Sensitivity analysis revealed that fine sand is highly susceptible to erosion, particularly under low-intensity, long-duration rainfall. Results also show that the first 10 minutes of high-intensity rain are most critical for discharge and failure. These findings highlight the potential of ML for post-wildfire hazard assessment and emergency response planning.

Title: Generalizing Deconfined Criticality to 3D $N$-Flavor $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ Quantum Chromodynamics on the Fuzzy Sphere
Authors: Emilie Huffman, Zheng Zhou, Yin-Chen He, Johannes S. Hofmann
Abstract: The infra-red behaviour of gauge theories coupled to matter remains an open problem in quantum field theory. For a given gauge group, such theories are expected to flow to an interacting conformal fixed point over a range of fermion or scalar flavours, known as the `conformal window.' Their nature is important for understanding critical phases and phase transitions beyond the Landau paradigm like the deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP), yet remains challenging for conventional non-perturbative approaches. In this work, we study a family of fuzzy-sphere models corresponding to non-linear sigma models with $\mathrm{Sp}(N)$ global symmetry extended to the strongly-coupled region. These theories are expected have an infra-red fixed point described by $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ quantum chromodynamics (QCD) in three space-time dimensions with $N$ flavours of fermions. They can be viewed as a generalisation of the $\mathrm{SO}(5)$ DQCP, corresponding to $N=2$. We investigate them using quantum Monte Carlo for $N$ up to $16$. We find evidence that for $N\geq4$ the phase diagram contains a critical phase that appears to be absent for $N=2$. Within this phase, we measure the two-point correlation function and the excitation spectrum, which exhibit emergent conformal symmetry. We also extract the scaling dimension $\Delta_\phi$ of a leading operator and find consistency with large-$N$ expectations.

Title: Quantum computing with anyons is fault tolerant
Authors: Anasuya Lyons, Benjamin J. Brown
Abstract: In seminal work (arXiv:quant-ph/9707021) Alexei Kitaev proposed topological quantum computing (arXiv:cond-mat/0010440, arXiv:quant-ph/9707021, arXiv:quant-ph/0001108, arXiv:0707.1889), whereby logic gates of a quantum computer are conducted by creating, braiding and fusing anyonic particles on a two-dimensional plane. Furthermore, he showed the proposal is inherently robust to local perturbations (arXiv:cond-mat/0010440, arXiv:quant-ph/9707021, arXiv:1001.0344, arXiv:1001.4363) when anyons are created as quasiparticle excitations of a topologically ordered lattice model prepared at zero temperature. Over the decades following this proposal there have been considerable technological developments towards the construction of a fault-tolerant quantum computer. Rather than maintaining some target ground state at zero temperature, a modern approach is to actively correct the errors a target state experiences, where we use noisy quantum circuit elements to identify and subsequently correct for deviations from the ideal state. We present an error-correction scheme that enables us to carry out robust universal quantum computation by braiding anyons. We show that our scheme can be carried out on a suitably large device with an arbitrarily small failure rate assuming circuit elements are below some threshold level of local noise. The error-corrected scheme we have developed therefore enables us to carry out fault-tolerant topological quantum computation using modern quantum hardware that is now under development.

Title: Thermal precondensation in gauge-fermion theories
Authors: Álvaro Pastor-Gutiérrez, Jan M. Pawlowski, Franz R. Sattler
Abstract: Precondensation is a peculiar phenomenon in phase transitions, characterised by the occurrence of a condensate only over a finite range of length scales. It is closely connected to the emergence of domains, pseudo-gapped phases and spatial inhomogeneities in equilibrium. In this work, we show its occurrence in gauge-fermion theories in the chiral limit, close to the thermal chiral phase transition. We further show that the precondensation regime becomes increasingly pronounced and extends over a wider temperature range as the number of fermion flavours is increased. We analyse the underlying dynamics which is shared by a broad class of fermionic systems, ranging from condensed matter to high-energy physics. Specifically, we discuss the potential relevance of this phenomenon for physics beyond the Standard Model.

Title: Long-Range Pairing in the Kitaev Model: Krylov Subspace Signatures
Authors: Rishabh Jha, Heiko Georg Menzler
Abstract: Krylov subspace methods quantify operator growth in quantum many-body systems through Lanczos coefficients that encode how operators spread under time evolution. While these diagnostics have been proposed to distinguish quantum chaos from integrability, quadratic fermionic Hamiltonians are widely expected to exhibit trivial Lanczos structure. Here we demonstrate that Lanczos coefficients generated from local boundary operators provide a quantitative diagnostic of whether the lowest excitation gap is controlled by boundary-localized or bulk-extended modes in the long-range Kitaev chain, the model for topological superconductivity with algebraically decaying couplings. We introduce \emph{Krylov staggering parameter}, defined as the logarithmic ratio of consecutive odd and even Lanczos coefficients, whose sign structure correlates robustly with the edge versus bulk character of the gap across the full phase diagram. This correlation arises from a bipartite Krylov structure induced by pairing, power-law couplings, and open boundaries. We derive an exact single-particle operator Lanczos algorithm that reduces the recursion from exponentially large operator space to a finite-dimensional linear problem, achieving machine precision for chains of hundreds of sites. These results establish Krylov diagnostics as operational probes of how low-energy excitations are localized along the chain and how strongly they are tied to the boundaries with broken U(1) symmetry, with potential applications to trapped-ion and cold-atom quantum simulators.

Title: Revealing Exotic Nanophase Iron in Lunar Samples Through Impact-Driven Spatial Fingerprints
Authors: Ziyu Huang, Masatoshi Hirabayashi
Abstract: Nanophase iron (npFe) plays a crucial role in controlling the optical, chemical, and physical evolution of lunar regolith grains. While in-situ formation of npFe via reduction of native Fe-bearing minerals has long been considered a dominant pathway, recent mineralogical evidence from this http URL et al. (2025) reveals that the source of a significant fraction of npFe may be delivered directly by exotic micrometeoroid impacts (exotic npFe). Yet the atomic-scale processes governing how exotic np-Fe forms and survives during hypervelocity impacts remain largely unknown. To quantitatively compare in-situ and exotic delivery and formation of npFe, we perform a series of innovative atomistic modeling of micrometeoroid impacts with distinct projectile target compositions: (1) SiO$_2$ projectiles on Fe$_2$SiO$_4$ targets (in-situ formation), (2) Fe$_2$SiO$_4$ projectiles on SiO$_2$ targets (exotic delivery). Our results reveal distinct mechanistic fingerprints: in-situ np-Fe forms diffusely and radially around the impact site, whereas exotic np-Fe is efficiently retained and concentrated in asymmetric, momentum-aligned clusters. These contrasting spatial signatures provide a potential diagnostic criterion for distinguishing exotic versus in-situ np-Fe in returned lunar soils. In agreement with Chang'e-5 observations, our simulations demonstrate that exotic np-Fe production can be substantial, particularly in Fe-poor terrains such as highland regions. These findings highlight the need to account for exotic np-Fe when interpreting space weathering processes and remote-sensing data for the Moon and other airless bodies.

Title: A physics-informed data-driven framework for modeling hyperelastic materials with progressive damage and failure
Authors: Kshitiz Upadhyay
Abstract: This work presents a two-stage physics-informed, data-driven constitutive modeling framework for hyperelastic soft materials undergoing progressive damage and failure. The framework is grounded in the concept of hyperelasticity with energy limiters and employs Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to separately learn the intact (undamaged) elastic response and damage evolution directly from data. In Stage I, GPR models learn the intact hyperelastic response through volumetric and isochoric response functions (or only the isochoric response under incompressibility), ensuring energetic consistency of the intact response and satisfaction of fundamental principles such as material frame indifference and balance of angular momentum. In Stage II, damage is modeled via a separate GPR model that learns the mapping between the intact strain energy density predicted by Stage I models and a stress-reduction factor governing damage and failure, with monotonicity, non-negativity, and complete-failure constraints enforced through penalty-based optimization to ensure thermodynamic admissibility. Validation on synthetic datasets, including benchmarking against analytical constitutive models and competing data-driven approaches, demonstrates high in-distribution accuracy under uniaxial tension and robust generalization from limited training data to compression and shear modes not used during training. Application to experimental brain tissue data demonstrates the practical applicability of the framework and enables inference of damage evolution and critical failure energy. Overall, the proposed framework combines the physical consistency, interpretability, and generalizability of analytical models with the flexibility, predictive accuracy, and automation of machine learning, offering a powerful approach for modeling failure in soft materials under limited experimental data.

Title: Nonlinear integrated quantum photonics with AlGaAs
Authors: F. Baboux, G. Moody, S. Ducci
Abstract: Integrated photonics provides a powerful approach for developing compact, stable and scalable architectures for the generation, manipulation and detection of quantum states of light. To this end, several material platforms are being developed in parallel, each providing its specific assets, and hybridization techniques to combine their strengths are now possible. This review focuses on AlGaAs, a III-V semiconductor platform combining a mature fabrication technology, direct band-gap compliant with electrical injection, low-loss operation, large electro-optic effect, and compatibility with superconducting detectors for on-chip detection. We detail recent implementations of room-temperature sources of quantum light based on the high second- and third-order optical nonlinearities of the material, as well as photonic circuits embedding various functionalities ranging from polarizing beamsplitters to Mach-Zehnder interferometers, modulators and tunable filters. We then present several realizations of quantum state engineering enabled by these recent advances and discuss open perspectives and remaining challenges in the field of integrated quantum photonics with AlGaAs.

Title: Structural control of two-level defect density revealed by high-throughput correlative measurements of Josephson junctions
Authors: Oliver F. Wolff, Harshvardhan Mantry, Rahim Raja, Wei-Hsiang Peng, Kaushik Singirikonda, Seungkyun Lee, Shishir Sudhaman, Rafael Goncalves, Pinshane Y. Huang, Angela Kou, Wolfgang Pfaff
Abstract: Materials defects in Josephson junctions (JJs), often referred to as two-level systems (TLS), couple to superconducting qubits and are a critical bottleneck for scalable quantum processors. Despite their importance, understanding the microscopic sources of TLS and how to mitigate them has remained a major challenge. Here, we demonstrate a high-throughput, correlated approach to trace the microstructural origins of strongly-coupled TLS in Josephson circuits. We assembled a massive dataset of TLS across 6,000 Al/AlOx/Al JJs and more than 600 atomic resolution transmission electron microscopy images. We statistically link fabrication, microstructure, and TLS occurrence, revealing a strong correlation between Al electrode thickness, Al grain size, and TLS density. Correspondingly, we find a two-thirds reduction in TLS prompted by a change in electrode fabrication parameters. These results demonstrate a robust, data-driven methodology to understand and control defects in quantum circuits and pave the way for significantly reducing TLS density.

Title: Collaboration drives phase transitions towards cooperation in prisoner's dilemma
Authors: Joy Das Bairagya, Jonathan Newton, Sagar Chakraborty
Abstract: We present a collaboration ring model -- a network of players playing the prisoner's dilemma game and collaborating among the nearest neighbours by forming coalitions. The microscopic stochastic updating of the players' strategies are driven by their innate nature of seeking selfish gains and shared intentionality. Cooperation emerges in such a structured population through non-equilibrium phase transitions driven by propensity of the players to collaborate and by the benefit that a cooperator generates. The robust results are qualitatively independent of number of neighbours and collaborators.

Title: Krylov Subspace Dynamics as Near-Horizon AdS$_2$ Holography
Authors: Hyun-Sik Jeong
Abstract: We establish a holographic gravitational dual for the fundamental dynamical equations governing operator growth in Krylov subspace. Specifically, we show that the deep interior of the Krylov subspace maps directly to the near-horizon regime of AdS$_2$ gravity. We demonstrate that, in the continuum limit, the discrete evolution on the Krylov chain transforms into the dynamics of a continuous field, which is isomorphic to the Klein-Gordon equation for a scalar field in the AdS$_2$ throat. This correspondence identifies the linear growth rate of Lanczos coefficients with the Hawking temperature, $\alpha=\pi T$, thereby recovering the saturation of the maximal chaos bound. Notably, the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound, a fundamental stability criterion in AdS gravity, emerges as a necessary consistency requirement for the dual description of Krylov subspace dynamics. Our results advance a Krylov-based holographic dictionary in a unified $SL(2, \mathbb{R})$ representation, revealing that the emergent geometry of Krylov subspace is a reflection of the near-horizon AdS spacetime.

Title: Experimental challenges and prospects for quantum-enhanced energy conversion: Stationary Fano coherence in V-type qutrits interacting with polarized incoherent radiation
Authors: Ludovica Donati, Francesco Saverio Cataliotti, Stefano Gherardini
Abstract: Quantum coherence offers potential for energy conversion technologies. It influences light absorption and emission, affecting energy conversion limits and efficiency. As a result, quantum coherence is being harnessed to boost performance in quantum heat engines, photocells, and photosynthetic-inspired platforms. Of particular interest in this context is the generation of Fano coherences, i.e., the formation of quantum coherences due to the interaction with the continuum of modes characterizing an incoherent process. We aim to formalize mathematically the possibility of achieving steady-state Fano coherence in a V-type three-level quantum system using polarized incoherent radiation, without requiring the energy difference between the excited levels to tend to zero. We perform this analysis by deriving the Bloch-Redfield equation from first-principles by quantizing the incoherent radiation. The resulting reduced dynamics of the system are analysed, so as to determine the lifetime of Fano coherence and identify the conditions under which it becomes stationary. We characterise distinct dynamical regimes, ranging from weak to strong pumping, in which steady-state Fano coherence emerges, and we quantitatively determine its magnitude. For each regime, we analyse the generation of Fano coherence as a function of both the intensity of the incoherent pumping and the energy splitting between the excited levels. We also assess how obtaining Fano coherence is modified by symmetric or asymmetric decay rates. These findings indicate that a three-level quantum system driven by polarized incoherent light can act as a robust resource for coherence-assisted energy conversion and storage. Finally, we discuss the experimental challenges associated with the implementation of the proposed model using an ensemble of Rubidium atoms.

Title: QCD phase diagram in a magnetic field with baryon and isospin chemical potentials
Authors: Yu Hamada, Muneto Nitta, Zebin Qiu
Abstract: Based on the chiral perturbation theory at the leading order, we present the phase diagram of low-energy QCD in a magnetic field at finite baryon and isospin chemical potentials. The phase diagram consists of the QCD vacuum, the chiral soliton lattice, the uniform charged pion condensation, an Abrikosov vortex lattice of the charged pions, a baryonic vortex lattice composed of neutral and charged pion vortices with their topological linking number being the baryon number, and a hybrid phase of chiral soliton and vortex lattices, with their intersections carrying the baryon number. While the chiral soliton lattice demands ultra-strong magnetic field $\sim 10^{19}$ G,the intersection phase appears at $\sim10^{17}$ G, which is more realistic in neutron stars.

Title: What is a Fluctuation Theorem?
Authors: Noé Cuneo, Vojkan Jakšić, Claude-Alain Pillet, Armen Shirikyan
Abstract: This book provides a modern review of Fluctuation Relations and Fluctuation Theorems in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. It focuses on the pioneering perspectives of Gallavotti and Cohen, according to which a fluctuation theorem describes the statistics of the deviations of entropy production from its expected value. For time-reversal invariant systems, these fluctuations obey a universal (i.e., model-independent) symmetry called the fluctuation relation. The probabilistic framework introduced in the first part of the book allows for a very general formulation of Fluctuation Relations and Theorems for both deterministic and stochastic dynamical systems. The authors further explore models of physical interest, illustrating this framework by concrete applications. The second part of the book focuses on chaotic dynamics. The formulation of two general Fluctuation Theorems, followed by the detailed study of a concrete example, provides the reader with an understanding of both the theoretical and practical aspects of the subject.

Title: Tuning Optical Properties of FTO via Carbonaceous Al2O3 Microdot Deposition by DC plasma sputtering
Authors: Sarah Salah, Ahmed Atlam, Nagat Elkahwagy, Abdelhamid Elshaer, Mohammed Shihab
Abstract: Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) is a key transparent conductive oxide for photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices, yet its high reflectance limits light-trapping efficiency. This work demonstrates a simple DC plasma sputtering approach to deposit carbonaceous Al2O3 microdots on FTO under controlled Ar, O2, and Ar-O2 atmospheres. For plasma discharge in the normal mode, with plasma density 10^-9 cm^-3 and temperature of 2 eV, Volmer-Weber growth produced discrete microdots whose size and distribution were tuned by gas composition: dense, uniform dots in Ar (approximately 0.89 um radius), agglomerated structures in O2, and intermediate morphologies in mixed atmospheres. Structural analysis confirmed gamma-Al2O3 formation with carbon incorporation, while SEM revealed morphology-driven optical behavior. UV-Vis measurements showed that Ar-O2 coatings achieved the lowest reflectance across the visible range, outperforming bare FTO and other conditions. These findings establish a clear link between sputtering parameters, surface morphology, and optical performance, offering a scalable route to anti-reflective, light-trapping coatings for next-generation solar cells and optoelectronic devices.

Title: Two-point functions in boundary loop models
Authors: Max Downing, Jesper Lykke Jacobsen, Rongvoram Nivesvivat, Hubert Saleur
Abstract: Using techniques of conformal bootstrap, we propose analytical expressions for a large class of two-point functions of bulk fields in critical loop models defined on the upper-half plane. Our results include the two-point connectivities in the Fortuin--Kasteleyn random cluster model with both free and wired boundary conditions. We link the continuum expressions to lattice quantities by computing universal ratios of amplitudes for the two-point connectivities, and find excellent agreement with transfer-matrix numerics.

Title: Momentum Distribution of the Dilute Fermi Gas
Authors: Niels Benedikter, Emanuela L. Giacomelli, Asbjørn Bækgaard Lauritsen, Sascha Lill
Abstract: We consider a dilute quantum gas of interacting spin-1/2 fermions in the thermodynamic limit. For a trial state that resolves the ground state energy up to the precision of the Huang--Yang formula, we rigorously derive its momentum distribution. Our result agrees with the formal perturbative argument of Belyakov (Sov. Phys. JETP 13: 850--851 (1961)).

Title: Refined half-integer condition on RG flows
Authors: Ken Kikuchi
Abstract: Renormalization group flows are constrained by symmetries. Traditionally, we have made the most of 't Hooft anomalies associated to the symmetries. The anomaly is mathematically part of the data for the monoidal structure on symmetry categories. The symmetry categories sometimes admit additional structures such as braiding. It was found that the additional structures give further constraints on renormalization group flows. One of these constraints is the half-integer condition. The condition claims the following. Braidings are characterized by conformal dimensions. A symmetry object $c$ in a braided symmetry category surviving all along the flow thus has two conformal dimensions, one in ultraviolet $h_c^\text{UV}$ and the other in infrared $h_c^\text{IR}$. In a renormalization group flow with a renormalization group defect, they add up to a half-integer $h_c^\text{UV}+h_c^\text{IR}\in\frac12\mathbb Z$. We find a necessary condition for the sum to be half-integer. We solve some flows with the refined half-integer condition.

Title: Theoretical description of a photonic topological insulator based on a cubic lattice of bianisotropic resonators
Authors: Alina Rozenblit, Nikita Olekhno
Abstract: In the present paper, we construct a theoretical description of a three-dimensional photonic topological insulator in the form of a simple cubic lattice of bianisotropic resonators that is based on a dyadic Green's function approach. By considering electric and magnetic dipole modes and the interactions between different numbers of the nearest resonators, we obtain the Bloch Hamiltonians and the corresponding tight-binding models and analyze the band diagrams, spatial structure of the eigenmodes, and their localization, revealing quadratic degeneracies in the vicinity of high-symmetry points in the absence of bianisotropy and the emergence of in-gap states localized at a domain wall upon the introduction of bianisotropy. Finally, we visualize the Berry curvature distributions to study the topological properties of the considered models.

Title: Quantum-Coherent Thermodynamics: Leaf Typicality via Minimum-Variance Foliation
Authors: Maurizio Fagotti
Abstract: Equilibrium statistical ensembles commute with the Hamiltonian and thus carry no coherence in the energy eigenbasis. We develop a thermodynamic framework in which energy fluctuations can retain genuinely quantum-coherent contributions. We foliate state space into "minimum-variance leaves," defined by minimizing the average energy variance over all pure-state decompositions, with the minimum set by the quantum Fisher information. On each leaf we construct the least-biased state compatible with normalization and mean energy, defining a leaf-canonical ensemble. The Gibbs ensemble is recovered on the distinguished commuting leaf, while generic states are organized by their leaf label. This structure provides a natural setting to extend eigenstate thermalization beyond equilibrium via a "leaf typicality" hypothesis. According to that hypothesis, under unitary time evolution local observables depend only on the leaf and energy and, at all times, are reproduced by evolving a representative (pure) state drawn from the optimal ensemble.

Title: Non-Abelian Quantum Low-Density Parity Check Codes and Non-Clifford Operations from Gauging Logical Gates via Measurements
Authors: Maine Christos, Chiu Fan Bowen Lo, Vedika Khemani, Rahul Sahay
Abstract: In this work, we introduce constructions for non-Abelian qLDPC codes obtained by gauging transversal Clifford gates using measurement and feedback. In particular, we identify two qualitatively different approaches to gauging qLDPC codes to obtain their non-Abelian counterparts. The first approach applies to codes that exhibit a generalized form of Poincaré duality and leads to a qLDPC non-Abelian Clifford stabilizer code, whose stabilizers are reminiscent of the action of a Type-III twisted quantum double. Our second approach applies to general qLDPC codes, and uses a graph of ancilla qubits which may be tailored to properties of the input codes to gauge a single transversal gate. For both constructions, the resulting gauged codes are shown to have properties analogous to 2D non-Abelian topological order -- e.g. the analog of a single anyon on a torus. We conclude by demonstrating that our gauging procedures enable magic state preparation via the measurement of logical Clifford gates. Consequently, our gauging constructions offer a protocol for performing non-Clifford operations on any qLDPC code.

Title: MagneX: A High-Performance, GPU-Enabled, Data-Driven Micromagnetics Solver for Spintronics
Authors: Andy Nonaka, Yingheng Tang, Julian C. LePelch, Prabhat Kumar, Weiqun Zhang, Jorge A. Munoz, Christian Fernandez-Soria, Cesar Diaz, David J. Gardner, Zhi Jackie Yao
Abstract: In order to comprehensively investigate the multiphysics coupling in spintronic devices, it is essential to parallelize and utilize GPU-acceleration to address the spatial and temporal disparities inherent in the relevant physics. Additionally, the use of cutting-edge time integration libraries as well as machine learning (ML) approaches to replace and potentially accelerate expensive computational routines are attractive capabilities to enhance modeling capabilities moving forward. Leveraging the Exascale Computing Project software framework AMReX, as well as SUNDIALS time-integration libraries and python-based ML workflows, we have developed an open-source micromagnetics modeling tool called MagneX. This tool incorporates various crucial magnetic coupling mechanisms, including Zeeman coupling, demagnetization coupling, crystalline anisotropy interaction, exchange coupling, and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) coupling. We demonstrate the GPU performance and scalability of the code and rigorously validate MagneX's functionality using the mumag standard problems and widely-accepted DMI benchmarks. Furthermore, we demonstrate the data-driven capability of MagneX by replacing the computationally-expensive demagnetization physics with neural network libraries trained from our simulation data. With the capacity to explore complete physical interactions, this innovative approach offers a promising pathway to better understand and develop fully integrated spintronic and electronic systems.

Title: Vision Transformer for Multi-Domain Phase Retrieval in Coherent Diffraction Imaging
Authors: Jialun Liu, David Yang, Ian Robinson
Abstract: Bragg coherent diffraction imaging (BCDI) phase retrieval becomes rapidly difficult in the strong-phase regime, where a crystal contains distortions beyond half a lattice spacing. An important special case is the phase domain problem, where blocks of a crystal are displaced with sharp jumps at domain walls. The strong-phase, here defined as beyond $\pm \pi/2$, generates split Bragg peaks and dense fringe structure for which classical iterative solvers often stagnate or return different solutions from different initialisations. Here, we introduce an unsupervised Fourier Vision Transformer (Fourier ViT) to solve this block-phase, multi-domain phase-retrieval problem directly from measured 2D Bragg diffraction intensities. Fourier ViT couples reciprocal-space information globally through multiscale Fourier token mixing, while shallow convolutional front and back-ends provide local filtering and reconstruction. We validate the approach on large-scale synthetic datasets of Voronoi multi-domain crystals with strong-phase contrast under realistic noise corruptions, and on experimental diffraction from a $\mathrm{La}_{2-x}\mathrm{Ca}_x\mathrm{MnO}_4$ nanocrystal. Across the regimes considered, Fourier ViT achieves the lowest reciprocal-space mismatch ($\chi^2$) among the compared methods and preserves domain-resolved phase reconstructions for increasing numbers of domains. On experimental data, with the same real-space support, Fourier ViT matches the iterative benchmark $\chi^2$ while improving robustness to random initialisations, yielding a higher success rate of low-$\chi^2$ reconstructions than the complex convolutional neural network baseline.

Title: Magneto-transport signatures in periodically-driven Weyl and multi-Weyl semimetals
Authors: Shivam Yadav, Serena Fazzini, Ipsita Mandal
Abstract: We investigate the influence of a time-periodic driving (for example, by shining circularly polarized light) on three-dimensional Weyl and multi-Weyl semimetals, in the planar Hall and planar thermal Hall set-ups. We incorporate the effects of the drive by using the Floquet formalism in the large frequency limit. We evaluate the longitudinal magneto conductivity, planar Hall conductivity, longitudinal thermo-electric coefficient, and transverse thermo-electric coefficient, using the semi-classical Boltzmann transport equations. We demonstrate the explicit expressions of these transport coefficients in certain limits of the parameters, where it is possible to perform the integrals analytically. We cross-check our analytical approximations by comparing the physical values with the numerical results, obtained directly from the numerical integration of the integrals. The answers obtained show that the topological charges of the corresponding semimetals have profound signatures in these transport properties, which can be observed in experiments.

Title: Chemically Regulated Conical Channel Synapse for Neuromorphic and Sensing Applications
Authors: T. M. Kamsma, M. S. Klop, W. Q. Boon, C. Spitoni, B. Rueckauer, R. van Roij
Abstract: Fluidic iontronics offer a unique capability for emulating the chemical processes found in neurons. We extract multiple distinct chemically regulated synaptic features from an experimentally accessible conical microfluidic channel carrying functionalized surface groups, using finite-element calculations of continuum transport equations. By modeling a Langmuir-type surface reaction on the channel wall we couple fast voltage-induced volumetric salt accumulation with a long-term channel surface charge modulation by means of fast charging and slow discharging. These nonlinear charging dynamics emerge across several orders of magnitude of reaction rates and equilibria, and are understood through an analytic approximation rooted in first-principles. We show how short-and long-term potentiation and depression, frequency-dependent plasticity, and chemical-electrical signal spike-timing dependence and coincidence detection (acting like a chemical-electrical AND logic gate), akin to the NMDA mechanism for Hebbian learning in biological synapses, can all be emulated.

Authors: Liang Z. Tan, Xavier Andrade, Sangeeta Rajpurohit, Alfredo A. Correa, Tadashi Ogitsu
Abstract: First principles real-time time dependent density functional theory (rt-TDDFT) calculations reveal the existence of ballistic photocurrents generated by Coulomb scattering, which has not previously been considered as a mechanism for the bulk photovoltaic effect. With monolayer GeS as an example, it is predicted that ballistic currents can be comparable to shift currents under experimentally accessible conditions.

Title: Paramagnon-Interference Mechanism for Three-Dimensional Bond Order in Kagome Metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=Cs, Rb, K): Analysis by the Density-Wave Equation
Authors: Seiichiro Onari, Rina Tazai, Youichi Yamakawa, Hiroshi Kontani
Abstract: The mechanism of CDW and its 3D structure are important fundamental issues in kagome metals. We have previously shown that, based on a 2D model, $2\times 2$ bond order (BO) emerges due to the paramagnon-interference (PMI) mechanism and that its fluctuations lead to $s$-wave superconductivity. This paper studies these issues based on realistic 3D models of kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=Cs, Rb, K). We reveal that a commensurate 3D $2\times 2\times 2$ BO is caused by the PMI mechanism, by performing the 3D density-wave (DW) equation analysis for all A=Cs, Rb, K models in detail. Our results indicate a BO transition temperature $T_{\rm BO}\sim 100$K within the regime of moderate electron correlation. The 3D structure of BO is attributed to the three-dimensionality of the Fermi surface, while the 3D structure of BO is sensitively changed, since the Fermi surface is quasi-2D. Based on the analysis of the DW equation, by taking into account a finite third-order Ginzburg-Landau (GL) term, (i) shift stacking $2\times 2\times 2$ BO can be realized via a first-order transition below $T_{\rm BO}$. Here, the in-plane BO pattern (tri-hexagonal or star-of-David) is determined by the sign of the third-order GL term, with hole doping tending to favor the tri-hexagonal state. On the other hand, if the third-order GL term is very small, (ii) alternating vertical stacking BO may instead be realized via a second-order transition. The present study enhances our understanding of the rich variety of BOs observed experimentally. It is confirmed that the PMI mechanism is the essential origin of the 3D CDW of kagome metals.

Title: Nonlinear Terahertz Electroluminescence from Dirac Landau Polaritons

Abstract: We report Dirac Landau polaritons observed by terahertz (THz) magnetoreflectivity spectroscopy, demonstrating strong coupling between cyclotron transitions of two-dimensional (2D) Dirac fermions in HgTe quantum wells and optical cavity modes. Under pulsed electrical injection we observe efficient nonlinear electroluminescence, with a strongly out-of-equilibrium polariton distribution dominated by emission from the upper polariton branches. Model analysis of the bias-dependent emission intensity and spectral narrowing indicates a polariton occupancy per mode approaching unity, with a possible contribution from stimulated polariton emission in the spectral region of the upper anticrossing. These results open prospects toward Dirac Landau polariton condensates and low-threshold, tunable THz polariton lasers based on cyclotron emission.

Title: Altermagnetic Skyrmions in 2D Lattices Exhibiting Anisotropic Skyrmion Hall Effect
Authors: Kaiying Dou, Zhonglin He, Wenhui Du, Ying Dai, Baibiao Huang, Yandong Ma
Abstract: Anisotropic skyrmion Hall effect (A-SkHE) in two-dimensional (2D) magnetic systems represents a captivating phenomenon in condensed-matter physics and materials science. While conventional antiferromagnetic systems inherently suppress this effect through parity-time symmetry-mediated cancellation of Magnus forces acting on skyrmions, A-SkHE is primarily confined to ferromagnetic platforms. Here, we present a paradigm-shifting demonstration of this phenomenon in spin-splitting 2D antiferromagnets through the investigation of altermagnetic skyrmions. Combining comprehensive symmetry analysis with theoretical modeling, we elucidate the mechanism governing A-SkHE realization in 2D altermagnetic systems and establish a quantitative relationship between the transverse velocity of altermagnetic skyrmions and applied current orientation. Using first-principles calculations and micromagnetic simulations, this mechanism is further illustrated in a prototypical altermagnetic monolayer V2SeTeO. Crucially, we identify that the [C2C4zt] symmetry-protected anisotropic field serves as the critical stabilizer for maintaining the A-SkHE in this system. Our results greatly enrich the research on 2D altermagnetism and skyrmions.

Title: Quantum phase transition driven by competing intralayer and interlayer hopping in bilayer nickelates
Authors: Xiaoyu Zhu, Wei Qin, Ping Cui, Zhenyu Zhang
Abstract: Bilayer nickelates exhibit high-temperature superconductivity under proper hydrostatic pressure or epitaxial strain, signifying the emergence of quantum phase transitions whose physical mechanisms remain unclear. Using a minimal bilayer Hubbard model incorporating only the Ni-$d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals, we demonstrate that a phase transition naturally arises from tuning the ratio of intralayer to interlayer hopping amplitudes. The transition point separates regimes with a rich interplay between superconducting and density-wave orders. In the regime of weaker intralayer hopping, the ground state is characterized by quasi-long-range spin-density-wave order. As the intralayer hopping increases, the system undergoes a transition marked by the opening of a finite spin gap and the disappearance of spin-density-wave order. Meanwhile, superconductivity is dramatically enhanced, accompanied by the emergence of quasi-long-range charge-density-wave order, indicating that the system enters Luther-Emery phase. This quantum phase transition, driven by the competition between intralayer and interlayer hopping, provides a plausible microscopic explanation for the experimentally observed correlation between the superconducting transition temperature and ratio of out-of-plane to in-plane lattice constants. Our findings reveal a possible link between the suppression of spin-density-wave order and the prominence of superconducting order, which may assist future efforts to optimize experimental conditions for further enhancing superconductivity in bilayer nickelates.

Title: Excitation and tunneling spectra of a fractional quantum Hall system in the thin cylinder limit
Authors: Jyesta M. Adhidewata, Joel E. Moore
Abstract: The excitations of fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) states have been largely inaccessible to experimental probes until recently. New electron scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) results from Hu this http URL. (arXiv:2308.05789) show promise in detecting and identifying these excited states via the local density of states (LDOS) spectrum. On a torus, there exists a mapping {from the lowest Landau level states} to a 1D lattice {with a Hamiltonian that features} dipole moment conservation. In this work, we apply perturbation theory starting from the thin cylinder limit ($L_x \rightarrow \infty, L_y <l_B$ for torus dimensions $L_x$ and $L_y$ {and magnetic length $l_B$}) to obtain an analytical approach to the low-lying neutral and charged excitations of the $\nu =1/3$ FQHE state. Notably, in the thin cylinder we can systematically enumerate all the low-lying excitations by the patterns of 'dipoles' formed by the electron occupation pattern on the 1D lattice. We find that the thin-cylinder limit predicts a significant dispersion of the low-lying neutral excitations but sharpness of the LDOS spectra, which measure charged excitations. We also discuss connections between our work and several different approaches to the FQHE STM spectra, including those using the composite fermion theory. Numerical exact diagonalization beyond the thin-cylinder limit suggests that the energies of charged excitations remain largely confined to a narrow range of energies, which in experiments might appear as a single peak.

Title: Entropy production in non-reciprocal polar active mixtures
Authors: Kim L. Kreienkamp, Sabine H. L. Klapp
Abstract: The out-of-equilibrium character of active systems is often twofold, arising from both the activity itself and from non-reciprocal couplings between constituents. A well-established measure to quantify the system's distance from equilibrium is the informatic entropy production rate. Here, we ask the question whether and how the informatic entropy production rate reflects collective behaviors and transitions in an active mixture with non-reciprocal polar couplings. In such systems, non-reciprocal orientational couplings can induce chiral motion of particles. At the field-theoretical level, transitions to these time-dependent chiral states are marked by so-called critical exceptional points. Here, we show that at a particle level, the entropy production rate within the chiral states increases with the degree of non-reciprocity, provided it is sufficiently strong. Moreover, even at small degrees of non-reciprocity, the transitions via exceptional points leave clear signatures in the entropy production rate, which exhibits pronounced peaks at coupling strengths corresponding to the field-theoretical exceptional points. Overall, the increase and peaks of the entropy production rate mirror the susceptibility of the polarization vector at the particle level. This correspondence is supported by a field-theoretical analysis, which reveals that, in the long-wavelength limit, the entropy production rate scales with the susceptibilities of the polarization fields.

Title: Performance Improvement of Deorbitalized Exchange-Correlation Functionals
Authors: H. Francisco, B. Thapa, S.B. Trickey, A.C. Cancio
Abstract: Deorbitalization of a conventional meta-generalized-gradient exchange-correlation approximation replaces its dependence upon the Kohn-Sham kinetic energy density with a dependence on the density gradient and Laplacian. In principle, that simplification should provide improved computational performance relative to the original meta-GGA form because of the shift from an orbital-dependent generalized Kohn-Sham potential to a true KS local potential. Often that prospective gain is lost because of problematic roughness in the density caused by the density Laplacian and consequent roughness in the exchange-correlation potential from the resulting higher-order spatial derivatives of the density in it. We address the problem by constructing a deorbitalizer based on the RPP deorbitalizer [Phys. Rev. Mater. 6, 083803 (2022)] with comparative smoothness of the potential along with retention of constraint satisfaction as design goals. Applied to the r^2SCAN exchange-correlation functional [J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 11, 8208 (2020)], we find substantial timing improvements for solid-state calculations over both r^2SCAN and its earlier deorbitalization for high precision calculations of structural properties, while improving upon the accuracy of RPP deorbitalization for both solids and molecules.

Title: Phase Diagram and dynamical phases of self organization of a Bose-Einstein condensate in a transversely pumped red-detuned cavity
Authors: Julian Mayr, Maria Laura Staffini, Simon B. Jäger, Corinna Kollath, Jonathan Keeling
Abstract: We study a transversely pumped atomic Bose-Einstein Condensate coupled to a single-mode optical cavity, where effective atom-atom interactions are mediated by pump and cavity photons. A number of experiments and theoretical works have shown the formation of a superradiant state in this setup, where interference of pump and cavity light leads to an optical lattice in which atoms self-consistently organize. This self-organization has been extensively studied using the approximate Dicke model (truncating to two momentum states), as well as through numerical Gross-Pitaevskii simulations in one and two dimensions. Here, we perform a full mean-field analysis of the system, including all relevant atomic momentum states and the cavity field. We map out the steady-state phase diagram vs pump strength and cavity detuning, and provide an in-depth understanding of the instabilities that are linked to the emergence of spatio-temporal patterns. We find and describe parameter regimes where mean-field predicts bistability, regimes where the dynamics form chaotic trajectories, instabilities caused by resonances between normal mode excitations, and states with atomic dynamics but vanishing cavity field.

Title: Zero and Nonzero Energy Majorana Modes in an Extended Kitaev Chain
Authors: Mohammad Ghuneim, Raditya Weda Bomantara
Abstract: This paper studies an extended Kitaev chain with three sublattices per unit cell. This extended version is obtained by hybridizing a modified Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model featuring trimerized unit cells with the standard Kitaev chain, resulting in a hexamer structure on the Majorana basis. Due to the interplay between the sublattice configuration and the $p$-wave superconducting pairing, a rich structure of edge modes beyond the expected Majorana zero modes is obtained. The various Majorana edge modes are further found to demonstrate considerable robustness against some generic perturbations and disorder. The presence of the non-zero Majorana edge modes in our system has the potential advantage that they could, in principle, be more unambiguously detected as compared to their zero energy counterparts, the detection of which remains an open problem. Therefore, while our system does not directly solve this open problem, it potentially offers a route to an intermediate solution that involves unambiguously detecting non-zero energy Majorana edge modes instead.

Title: Orbital magnetization and magnetic susceptibility of interacting electrons
Authors: Jian Kang, Minxuan Wang, Oskar Vafek
Abstract: We present a rigorous derivation of the orbital magnetization for interacting electrons within the self-consistent Hartree-Fock approximation. Our method also allows us to derive formulas for the orbital magnetic susceptibility. The results are expressed entirely in terms of the self-consistent wavefunctions and the Hartree-Fock energy spectrum at zero magnetic field. We find that the formula for the orbital magnetization is the same as in the non-interacting case, provided that the Hamiltonian and Bloch wave functions are replaced by their Hartree-Fock counterparts. By contrast, the orbital magnetic susceptibility contains an additional interaction-induced contribution that cannot be obtained by such a replacement. We test the formulas on an interacting Rashba model, finding an agreement with calculations performed at a small but non-zero external magnetic field.

Title: Stationary densities and delocalized domain walls in asymmetric exclusion processes competing for finite pools of resources
Authors: Sourav Pal, Parna Roy, Abhik Basu
Abstract: We explore the stationary densities and domain walls in the steady states of a pair of asymmetric exclusion processes (TASEP) antiparallelly coupled to two particle reservoirs without any spatial extent by using the model in Haldar et al., Phys. Rev. E {\bf 111}, 014154 (2025). We show that the model admits a pair of {\em delocalized} domain walls, which exist for some choices of the model parameters that define the effective entry and exit rates into the TASEP lanes. Surprisingly, in the parameter space spanned by these model parameters, the region corresponding to delocalized domain walls covers an {\em extended} region, in contrast to the delocalized domain walls that appear only along a line in the relevant parameter space of the other known variants of TASEP. This implies large fluctuations in the TASEP particle numbers even in the thermodynamic limit that can be found over a range of the control parameters. The corresponding phase diagrams in the plane of the control parameters have different topology from those for an open TASEP or other models with multiple TASEPs connected to two reservoirs.

Title: Observation of Hexagonal Close-Packed Water Ice at Conditions in Ice Giant Planetary Interiors
Authors: Alexis Forestier, Gunnar Weck, Sandra Ninet, Gaston Garbarino, Mohamed Mezouar, Frédéric Datchi, Paul Loubeyre
Abstract: Knowing the phase transformations in dense water ice is key to unraveling the peculiar geophysical properties of Uranus and Neptune, whose stratified interior models predict a thick ice layer beneath a convective ionic fluid layer. In the latter, water ice is currently assumed to adopt an fcc superionic structure, a phase that has recently been observed experimentally. Here, we report the observation of an hcp ice phase under such planetary conditions, using synchrotron x-ray diffraction in laser-heated diamond anvil cells. Between 80 and 200 GPa, we observe the coexistence of fcc and hcp ices, arising from stacking disorder developing within the fcc oxygen lattice upon temperature cycling. Above 200 GPa, the hcp phase dominates at high temperature, indicating increased thermodynamic stability upon entering a superionic state suggested by an anomalous thermal expansion. An anisotropic proton conductivity of superionic hcp ice, and the existence of a fcc-hcp martensitic transition may have planetary implications for dynamo models and for the dynamics of the ice mantle.

Title: Superconductivity in overdoped cuprates can be understood from a BCS perspective!
Authors: B.J. Ramshaw, Steven A. Kivelson
Abstract: We summarize key experimental studies of the low energy properties of overdoped cuprate high temperature superconductors and conclude that a theoretical understanding of the ``essential physics" is achievable in terms of a conventional Fermi-liquid treatment of the normal state, and a BCS mean-field treatment of the (d-wave) superconducting state. For this perspective to be consistent, it is necessary to posit that there is a crossover from a strongly correlated underdoped regime (where a different theoretical perspective is necessary) to the more weakly correlated overdoped regime. It is also necessary to argue that the various observed features of the overdoped materials that are inconsistent with this perspective can be attributed to the expected effects of the intrinsic disorder associated with most of the materials being solid state solutions (alloys). As a test of this idea, we make a series of falsifiable predictions concerning the expected behavior of an ``ideal" (disorder free) overdoped cuprate.

Title: Photoluminescence Quenching in WSe$_2$ via p-Doping Induced by Functionalized Rylene Dyes
Authors: Ana M. Valencia, Theresa Kuechle, Maximiliam Tomoscheit, Sarah Jasmin Finkelmeyer, Olga Utismenko, Kalina Peneva, Martin Presselt, Giancarlo Soavi, Caterina Cocchi
Abstract: Hybrid heterostructures combining transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) with light-harvesting dyes are promising materials for next-generation optoelectronics. Yet, controlling and understanding interfacial charge transfer mechanisms in these complex systems remains a major challenge. Here, we investigate the microscopic origin of photoluminescence (PL) quenching in $\text{WSe}_2$ functionalized with a novel, strongly electron-deficient perylene monoimide dye, $\text{CN}_4\text{PMI}$. Experimentally, the hybridization induces a $\sim$97\% PL quenching in $\text{WSe}_2$, confirming substantial static charge transfer and increased $p$-doping from the dye. To isolate the dominant electronic mechanism, we investigate from first principles various interface morphologies, including differing molecular orientations and layer thicknesses. Our density-functional theory results confirm that $\text{CN}_4\text{PMI}$ acts as a strong electron acceptor, inducing $p$-doping and forming a type-II level alignment with all considered configurations, giving rise to a small or vanishing band gap. Based on these findings, we attribute the observed PL suppression in $\text{WSe}_2$ to these strong electronic interactions with the dye. Our study provides a clear and validated strategy for tailoring the electronic structure of TMDs through targeted, electron-deficient organic functionalization.

Title: Parameter-free prediction of irradiation defect structures in tungsten at room temperature using stochastic cluster dynamics
Authors: Sicong He, Brandon Schwendeman, George Tynan, Jaime Marian
Abstract: The foundations of irradiation damage theory were laid in the 1950s and 60s within the framework of chemical reaction kinetics. While helpful to analyze qualitative aspects of irradiation damage, the theory contained gaps that delayed its implementation and applicability as a predictive tool. The advent of computer simulations with atomistic resolution in the 80s and 90s revealed a series of mechanisms that have proved essential to understand key aspects of irradiation damage in crystalline solids. However, we still lack a comprehensive model that can connect atomic-level defect physics with experimental measurements of quantitative features of the irradiated microstructure. In this work, we present a mesoscale model that draws from our improved understanding of irradiation damage processes collected over the last few decades, bridging knowledge gained from our most sophisticated atomistic simulations with defect kinetics taking place over time scales many orders of magnitude larger than atomic interaction times. Importantly, the model contains no adjustable parameters and combines several essential pieces of irradiation damage physics: each playing an irreplaceable role in the context of the full model but of limited utility if considered in isolation. Crucially, we carry out a set of experiments carefully designed to isolate the key irradiation damage variables and facilitate validation. Using tungsten as a model material, we find exceptionally good agreement between our numerical predictions and experimental measurements of defect densities and defect cluster sizes.

Title: Transition Metal Dichalcogenide MoS${}_2$: oxygen and fluorine functionalization for selective plasma processing
Authors: Yury Polyachenko, Yuri Barsukov, Shoaib Khalid, Igor Kaganovich
Abstract: Low-temperature plasma processing is a promising technique for tailoring the properties of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) because it allows for precise control of radical and ion energies and fluxes. For chalcogen substitution, a key challenge is to identify the ion energy window that enables selective chalcogen removal while preserving the metal lattice. Using ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD), we demonstrate that oxygen and fluorine functionalization through thermal chemisorption significantly lowers the sputtering energy threshold ($E_{sputt}$) of MoS${}_2$ from $\sim 35$ eV to $\sim 10$ eV. In addition, we find that a non-orthogonal impact angle $\sim 30{}^{\circ}$ reduces the sputtering energy threshold, while cryogenic-range TMD temperatures may increase. To explain the observed trends, a multi-step sputtering mechanism is proposed. Our results show that oxygen/fluorine functionalization, impact angle, and material temperature are key control parameters for selective, damage-free chalcogen removal in TMD processing.

Title: Electrical conductivity of a random nanowire network: comparison of two-dimensional and quasi-three-dimensional models
Authors: Yuri Yu. Tarasevich, Andrei V. Eserkepov
Abstract: It is shown that the widely used two-dimensional model of random networks of metallic nanowires or carbon nanotubes significantly overestimates the number of contacts between elements compared to real systems, which, within the mean-field approach, leads to overestimated estimates of electrical conductivity, especially when the contact resistances between conductors make the main contribution to the electrical conductivity of the system. In the case of a two-dimensional model, the electrical conductivity of the system depends quadratically on the number density of conductors, whereas in the case of a three-dimensional model this dependence is linear.

Title: Tuning Terahertz Optomechanics of MoS2 Bilayers with Homogeneous In-plane Strain
Authors: S. Patel, Jose D. Mella, S. Puri, Salvador Barraza-Lopez, H. Nakamura
Abstract: Homogeneous in-plane biaxial tensile strain strengthens the out-of-plane van der Waals interaction in \MoS\ bilayers (BLs) and can be used to fine-tune their terahertz (THz) oscillations. Using ultralow-frequency Raman spectroscopy on hexagonal (2H) and rhombohedral (2R) stacked BLs, we observe a hardening of the interlayer breathing modes originating from a strain-induced Poisson contraction of the vdW separation between the layers, and characterized by an effective out-of-plane Poisson's ratio of $\nu_\mathrm{eff} \approx 0.19\text{--}0.24$. Strikingly, this geometric contraction drives the system into a highly repulsive regime of the intermolecular potential, corresponding to a Grüneisen parameter of $\gamma \approx 10\text{--}14$. This value surpasses even the `giant' one reported for phosphorene, establishing these van der Waals BLs as highly tunable nonlinear mechanical platforms that can be addressed at the THz regime, couple strongly with light, and do not need external pressure knobs.

Title: Current precision in interacting hybrid Normal-Superconducting systems
Authors: Nahual Sobrino, Fabio Taddei, Rosario Fazio, Michele Governale
Abstract: We study Andreev-mediated transport and current fluctuations in interacting normal-superconducting quantum-dot systems. Using a generalized master equation based on real-time diagrammatics and full counting statistics, we compute the steady-state current, zero-frequency noise, and rate of entropy production in the large superconducting-gap limit. We show how Coulomb interactions modify Andreev-mediated transport by renormalizing resonant conditions and suppressing superconducting coherence, leading to a pronounced reduction of current precision even when average currents are only weakly affected. These effects are particularly evident at high temperatures, where conventional Coulomb-blockade features are thermally smeared while fluctuation properties remain highly sensitive. By analyzing thermodynamic uncertainty relations, we demonstrate that violations of the quantum bound present in the noninteracting regime are progressively reduced and eventually suppressed as interactions increase, whereas the recently proposed hybrid bound remains satisfied. Our results clarify how Coulomb interactions, and nonequilibrium fluctuations jointly determine transport properties in hybrid superconducting devices, and establish current precision as a robust benchmark for interacting Andreev transport beyond the noninteracting limit.

Title: Field-Dependent Qubit Flux Noise Simulated from Materials-Specific Disordered Exchange Interactions Between Paramagnetic Adsorbates
Authors: Keith G. Ray, Yaniv Rosen, Jonathan L Dubois, Vincenzo Lordi
Abstract: Superconducting quantum devices, from qubits and magnetometers to dark matter detectors, are influenced by magnetic flux noise originating from paramagnetic surface defects and impurities. These spin systems can feature complex dynamics, including a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition, that depend on the lattice, interactions, external fields, and disorder. However, the disorder included in typical models is not materials-specific, diminishing the ability to accurately capture measured flux noise phenomena. We present a first principles-based simulation of a spin lattice consisting of paramagnetic O$_2$ molecules on an Al$_2$O$_3$ surface, a likely flux noise source in superconducting qubits, to elucidate opportunities to mitigate flux noise. We simulate an ensemble of surface adsorbates with disordered orientations and calculate the orientation-dependent exchange couplings using density functional theory. Thus, our spin simulation has no free parameters or assumed functional form of the disorder, and captures correlation in the defect landscape that would appear in real systems. We calculate a range of exchange interactions between electron pairs, with the smallest values, 0.016 meV and -0.023 meV, being in the range required to act as a two-level system and couple to GHz resonators. We calculate the flux noise frequency, temperature, and applied external magnetic field dependence, as well as the susceptibility-flux noise cross-correlation. Calculated trends agree with experiment, demonstrating that a surface harboring paramagnetic adsorbates arranged with materials-specific disorder and interactions captures the various properties of magnetic flux noise observed in superconducting circuits. In addition, we find that an external electric field can tune the spin-spin interaction strength and reduce magnetic flux noise.

Title: High-Harmonic Spin and Charge Pumping in Altermagnets
Authors: Ousmane Ly
Abstract: We report the emergence of highly nonlinear spin and charge pumping in an altermagnetic system driven by magnetic dynamics. The nonrelativistic spin-momentum coupling inherent to altermagnets generates a giant momentum dependent spin splitting, leading to strong spin-flip scattering in the presence of a precessing magnetic order driving the altermagnetic system out of equilibrium. Our simulations reveal the emission of hundreds of harmonics under realistic conditions, with amplitudes far exceeding those obtained in light-driven schemes. Notably, in contrast to ferromagnetic and conventional antiferromagnetic systems, where nonlinear emission typically requires additional spin-orbit coupling, altermagnets intrinsically support high-harmonic spin and charge pumping. These results identify altermagnetic systems as a promising platform for efficient THz emitters and highly nonlinear spintronic devices.

Title: Properties of Bose-Einstein condensates with altermagnetism
Authors: Jia Wang, Zhao Liu, Xia-Ji Liu, Hui Hu
Abstract: We investigate a weakly interacting two-component Bose--Einstein condensate in the miscible regime in the presence of \emph{altermagnetism}, i.e., a collinear and globally compensated magnetic order that breaks spin-rotation symmetry while maintaining zero net magnetization. Within Bogoliubov theory, we derive the quasiparticle spectrum and coherence factors and show that altermagnetic order generically induces an angular dependence of the low-energy excitations. As a result, the sound velocity, momentum-resolved magnetization in the quantum depletion, and density--spin response functions acquire anisotropic components. We show that these anisotropic contributions vanish after angular averaging, consistent with the defining feature of altermagnetism: nontrivial local spin polarization without a global magnetization. Finally, we evaluate the Lee--Huang--Yang correction to the ground-state energy in the altermagnetic phase. Our results should be testable with ultracold-atom experiments in the foreseeable future.

Title: Distorted polyhedral architecture enabled high thermoelectric performance of columnar double halide perovskites Cs2AgPdCl5 and Cs2AgPtCl5
Authors: Heena, Vineet Kumar Pandey, Ambesh Dixit, Anver Aziz, Sung Gu Kang, K.C. Bhamu
Abstract: We investigate the thermoelectric properties of two newly synthesized columnar double halide perovskites Cs$_2$AgPdCl$_5$ and Cs$_2$AgPtCl$_5$. These materials accommodate a distorted local polyhedral architecture with tetrahedral symmetry compared to traditional double halide perovskites. By employing density functional theory along with the semiclassical transport model, we have analyzed the electronic and transport properties of these materials. Our results show that at 800 K, the largest figure of merit ($zT$) is 1.30 (0.86) for p-type (n-type) Cs$_2$AgPdCl$_5$ and 0.87 for n-type Cs$_2$AgPtCl$_5$ at doping concentrations of $1.94 \times 10^{20}$ ($3.76 \times 10^{19}$) cm$^{-3}$ and $3.52 \times 10^{19}$ cm$^{-3}$, respectively. Remarkably, a very low doping concentration is required to achieve a high $zT$, setting these materials apart from others in this field. Our calculations demonstrate that Cs$_2$AgPdCl$_5$ benefits from the presence of conduction and valence band valleys near the band edges; however, the flat bands present in the valence band of Cs$_2$AgPtCl$_5$ do not improve its thermoelectric performance. Among these systems, hole doping in Cs$_2$AgPdCl$_5$ has shown remarkable thermoelectric performance. Interestingly, the local octahedral distortions present in these perovskites contribute to a marked reduction in the lattice thermal conductivity to 0.27 W/mK in Cs$_2$AgPtCl$_5$ and 0.20 W/mK in Cs$_2$AgPdCl$_5$ by causing enhanced phonon scattering, further improving the thermoelectric figure of merit. This drop in thermal conductivity, combined with the favorable electronic properties, underscores the potential use of these materials for applications in highly efficient thermoelectric devices.

Title: Fluctuation Theorem and Thermodynamic Formalism
Authors: Noé Cuneo, Vojkan Jakšić, Claude-Alain Pillet, Armen Shirikyan
Abstract: We study the Fluctuation Theorem (FT) for entropy production in chaotic discrete-time dynamical systems on compact metric spaces, and extend it to empirical measures, all continuous potentials, and all weak Gibbs states. In particular, we establish the FT in the phase transition regime. These results hold under minimal chaoticity assumptions (expansiveness and specification) and require no ergodicity conditions. They are also valid for systems that are not necessarily invertible and involutions other than time reversal. Further extensions involve asymptotically additive potential sequences and the corresponding weak Gibbs measures. The generality of these results allows to view the FT as a structural facet of the thermodynamic formalism of dynamical systems.

Title: Hydrostatic Newton-Cartan Membranes
Authors: Domingo Gallegos, Carlos Málaga
Abstract: An application of the Newton-Cartan framework to the study of membranes is presented. Specifically, for membranes of co-dimension one in hydrostatic equilibrium embedded in a flat ambient Newton-Cartan spacetime. For such membranes, the corresponding equilibrium partition function at second order in the hydrodynamic derivative expansion is shown. Equilibrium constraints and the corresponding set of equilibrium constitutive relations are found. For the generically non-constant elastic subset of thermodynamic coefficients, the Young-Laplace equation is presented for the case of two-dimensional axisymmetric closed membranes embedded in a flat three-dimensional spacetime with constant ambient vorticity. Some numerical solutions to this Young-Laplace equation are examined, and some analytic solutions for particular choices of the thermodynamic coefficients are also discussed.

Title: Arbitrary gauge quantisation of light-matter theories with time-dependent constraints
Authors: Adam Stokes, Ahsan Nazir
Abstract: We provide a general framework for the quantisation of light-matter theories with time-dependent holonomic constraints. Unless time dependence is present from the outset at the Lagrangian level, different gauges generally produce non-equivalent canonical theories. The irrotational gauge is defined as that which also yields a correct theory when time dependence is introduced at the Hamiltonian level. Our framework unifies examples of such gauges found in existing literature. In particular, we show that for describing time-dependent light-matter interactions the Coulomb gauge is not generally irrotational, so it does not enjoy any special status.

Title: Successive randomized compression: A randomized algorithm for the compressed MPO-MPS product
Authors: Chris Camaño, Ethan N. Epperly, Joel A. Tropp
Abstract: Tensor networks like matrix product states (MPSs) and matrix product operators (MPOs) are powerful tools for representing exponentially large states and operators, with applications in quantum many-body physics, machine learning, numerical analysis, and other areas. In these applications, computing a compressed representation of the MPO--MPS product is a fundamental computational primitive. For this operation, this paper introduces a new single-pass, randomized algorithm, called successive randomized compression (SRC), that improves on existing approaches in speed or in accuracy. The performance of the new algorithm is evaluated on synthetic problems and unitary time evolution problems for quantum spin systems.

Title: Wigner Cat Phases: A finely tunable system for exploring the transition to quantum chaos
Authors: M. Süzen
Abstract: A transition to quantum chaos is characterized by a finely tunable mixed random matrix ensemble. The {\it mixed Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (mGOE)} offers a pedagogically accessible framework for simulating {\it Many-Body Localization (MBL)} transitions. It can be tuned from chaotic to localized and heavy-tailed phases in a continuous fashion, providing an opportunity to explore new phases. We numerically study how the spectral properties of mGOE evolve across these transitions. Characterization of the transition to quantum chaos is computed and analyzed via empirical spectral density, nearest-neighbor spacing, and adjacent gap, with statistical uncertainty quantification that strengthens the robustness of the evidence for transitions. The transitions are identified as the {\it Wigner Cat Phases}, due to the shape of empirical spectral density, which depend on the tunable parameter. These simulated phases in mGOE provide a valuable framework to study the {\it Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH)} and its related transitions, representing a family of systems with tunable localization and disorder.

Title: Gradually opening Schrödinger's box reveals a cascade of sharp dynamical transitions
Authors: Barkay Guttel, Danielle Gov, Noam Netzer, Uri Goldblatt, Sergey Hazanov, Lalit M. Joshi, Alessandro Romito, Yuval Gefen, Parveen Kumar, Kyrylo Snizhko, Fabien Lafont, Serge Rosenblum
Abstract: Quantum mechanics predicts that unobserved systems may exist in a superposition of states, yet measurement produces definite outcomes, a tension at the heart of the quantum-to-classical boundary. How the transformation between these opposing regimes unfolds as observation strength increases has remained experimentally unexplored. Here, by continuously tuning the measurement strength on a superconducting qubit, we reveal that measurement-dominated dynamics emerge not gradually but through three distinct transitions: coherent oscillations abruptly halt; the system then freezes near a stable quantum state; and finally enters the quantum Zeno regime, where stronger observation paradoxically slows relaxation. Decoherence, rather than washing out this structure, reorganizes it, inverting the order in which transitions appear and decoupling signatures that coincide in idealized models. These results establish that the route from quantum dynamics to measurement-dominated behavior unfolds in sharp transitions governed by the interplay between observation and environment.

Title: Thermodynamics of the Heisenberg XXX chain with negative spin
Authors: Rong Zhong, Yang-Yang Chen, Kun Hao, Wen-li Yang, Vladimir Korepin
Abstract: We study the thermodynamics of the isotropic Heisenberg XXX spin chain with negative spin, focusing on the case $s=-1$. The model is equivalent to the quantum lattice nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) model and appears as an effective theory in deep inelastic scattering in high-energy quantum chromodynamics. Owing to its integrability, it admits a consistent Bethe Ansatz description and a well-defined thermodynamic limit. Using the thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz, we analyze the ground state, elementary excitations, and finite-temperature properties. In contrast to the conventional positive spin XXX chain, the negative spin model exhibits a distinct vacuum structure and excitation spectrum, leading to modified TBA equations and unconventional low-temperature behavior. Although the integral equations resemble those of the Lieb-Liniger Bose gas, the thermodynamics and scaling properties are qualitatively different and cannot be continuously connected. We derive the free energy, entropy, and specific heat, and identify a quantum phase transition separating different thermodynamic regimes. At zero temperature, the excitation spectrum becomes linear in the continuum limit and can be described by a conformal field theory. The low-temperature regime realizes a Luttinger-liquid like phase with features unique to the negative spin XXX chain.
