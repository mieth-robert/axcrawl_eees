Title: How to Measure and Model Light-Induced Spin Transfer
Authors: Sinéad A. Ryan, Mohamed F. Elhanoty, Anya Grafov, Peter C. Johnsen, Na Li, Justin M. Shaw, Anna Delin, Anastasios Markou, Edouard Lesne, Claudia Felser, Olle Eriksson, Erna K. Delczeg-Czirjak, Debjani Karmakar, Henry C. Kapteyn, Oscar Grånäs, Margaret M. Murnane
Abstract: Femtosecond laser light can transfer spin angular momentum between magnetic subspecies that exhibit hybridized valence bands within an alloy or compound, and represents the fastest route for manipulating the magnetization of a material. To date, ultrafast spin transfer has predominantly been explained in terms of the initial and final states available for laser excitation. Here, by comparing the measured and calculated dynamics across the entire $M$-edges of two very similar Heusler compounds, $Co_2MnGa$ and $Co_2MnGe$ as well as a sample of elemental Co, we find that simply accounting for the initial and final electron states available for laser excitation cannot alone explain the experimental observations. The influence of spin lifetimes must also be included, due to the shifting of the Fermi level upon replacing Ga with Ge, or the presence of crystalline disorder. This explains why the ordered $L2_1$ phase of $Co_2MnGa$ demonstrates strong laser-induced magnetic signal enhancements across the entire Co-edge, while similar enhancements were not observed in partially disordered $Co_2MnGe$. Although intra-site spin-transfers were expected in the minority channel in pure Co due to the presence of many more available states in the minority channel above the Fermi level, no such signal was observed due to very short few-femtosecond spin lifetimes in a metal. Finally, we identify key regions in the magnetic asymmetry where a transiently enhanced signal could be misinterpreted as a light-induced spin-transfer signature.

Title: Eliashberg Theory and Superfluid Stiffness of Band-Off-Diagonal Pairing in Twisted Graphene
Authors: Bernhard Putzer, Mathias S. Scheurer
Abstract: Recently, band-off-diagonal superconductivity has been proposed [Nat. Commun. 14, 7134 (2023)] as a candidate pairing state for twisted graphene systems. Based on mean-field theory, it was shown that it not only naturally emerges from both intervalley electron-phonon coupling and fluctuations of the nearby correlated insulator, but also exhibits nodal and gapped regimes as indicated by scanning tunneling microscopy experiments. Here we study band-off-diagonal pairing within Eliashberg theory. We show that despite the additional frequency dependence, the leading-order description of both intervalley coherent fluctuations or intervalley phonons exhibits a symmetry prohibiting admixture of an intraband component to the interband pairing state. It is found that even- and odd-frequency pairing mix, which originates from the reduced number of flavor degrees of freedom in the normal state. From analytic continuation, we obtain the electronic spectral function showing that, also within Eliashberg theory, the interband nature leads to an enhanced spectral weight below the order-parameter energy compared to band-diagonal pairing. Finally, we also study the superfluid stiffness of band-off-diagonal pairing, taking into account multi-band and quantum geometry effects. It is shown that for $s$-wave and chiral momentum dependencies, conventionally leading to fully gapped phases, an interband structure reduces the temperature scale below which the stiffness saturates. Depending on parameters, for the chiral state, this scale can even be suppressed all the way to zero temperature leading to a complex competition of multiple dispersive and geometrical contributions. Our results show that interband pairing might also be able to explain more recent stiffness measurements in the superconducting state of twisted multilayer graphene.

Title: Field-induced phase transitions in the Kitaev-Heisenberg model: A sign-problem-free quantum Monte Carlo study and possible application to $\alpha$-RuCl3
Authors: Xuan Zou, Shuo Liu, Wenan Guo, Hong Yao
Abstract: The frustrated magnet $\alpha$-RuCl3 is one of the prime candidates for realizing a Kitaev quantum spin liquid (QSL). However, the existence of a field-induced intermediate QSL phase in this material remains under debate. Here, we employ sign-free numerically exact quantum Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the Kitaev-Heisenberg (KH) model on the honeycomb lattice with $K=-2J$ under an applied magnetic field along the z-direction. Our findings reveal that the system undergoes a direct quantum phase transition from a zigzag magnetically ordered phase to a spin-polarized phase at zero temperature, which belongs to the 3D XY universality class. At finite temperatures, a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition line separates the spin-polarized phase from a quasi-long-range ordered state, eventually terminating at the quantum critical point. Our results convincingly show that there is no intermediate QSL phase in the KH model with a z-direction magnetic field, which we believe will shed important light on understanding experimental observations in $\alpha$-RuCl3.

Title: Classical Fractons: Local chaos, global broken ergodicity and an arrow of time
Authors: Aryaman Babbar, Ylias Sadki, Abhishodh Prakash, S. L. Sondhi
Abstract: We report new results on classical, Machian, fractons. For fractons of strictly bounded Machian range, we show that local clusters do not exhibit chaos while the global state breaks ergodicity. We show that the many fracton evolution characteristically exhibits a central time or Janus point and thus a generic non-equilibrium arrow of time as discussed previously in the context of classical Cosmology.

Title: Transfer learning electronic structure: millielectron volt accuracy for sub-million-atom moir\'e semiconductor
Authors: Ting Bao, Ning Mao, Wenhui Duan, Yong Xu, Adrian Del Maestro, Yang Zhang
Abstract: The integration of density functional theory (DFT) with machine learning enables efficient \textit{ab initio} electronic structure calculations for ultra-large systems. In this work, we develop a transfer learning framework tailored for long-wavelength moiré systems. To balance efficiency and accuracy, we adopt a two-step transfer learning strategy: (1) the model is pre-trained on a large dataset of computationally inexpensive non-twisted structures until convergence, and (2) the network is then fine-tuned using a small set of computationally expensive twisted structures. Applying this method to twisted MoTe$_2$, the neural network model generates the resulting Hamiltonian for a 1000-atom system in 200 seconds, achieving a mean absolute error below 0.1 meV. To demonstrate $O(N)$ scalability, we model nanoribbon systems with up to 0.25 million atoms ($\sim9$ million orbitals), accurately capturing edge states consistent with predicted Chern numbers. This approach addresses the challenges of accuracy, efficiency, and scalability, offering a viable alternative to conventional DFT and enabling the exploration of electronic topology in large scale moiré systems towards simulating realistic device architectures.

Title: Effect of Pt bottom electrode texture selection on the tetragonality and physical properties of Ba0.8Sr0.2TiO3 thin films produced by pulsed laser deposition
Authors: J. P. B. Silva, K. C. Sekhar, A. Almeida, J. Agostinho Moreira, J. Martín-Sánchez, M. Pereira, A. Khodorov, M. J. M. Gomes
Abstract: The effect of platinum (Pt) bottom electrode texture on the tetragonality, dielectric, ferroelectric, and polarization switching response of pulsed laser deposited Ba0.8Sr0.2TiO3 (BST) thin films has been studied. The x-ray diffraction and Raman analysis revealed the higher tetragonality of BST films when they were grown on higher (111) textured Pt layer. The properties like dielectric permittivity, polarization, switching time, and leakage currents were found to be correlated to tetragonality and orientation of the BST films. The polarization current was observed to be higher in BST films on Pt epitaxial layer and it exhibits exponential dependence on the electric field. The voltage-current measurements displayed Ohmic behavior of leakage current irrespective of Pt texture for low voltages (up to 1 V), whereas at higher voltages the conduction mechanism was found to be dependent on texture selection of bottom Pt electrode.

Title: Self-assembling of Ge quantum dots in an alumina matrix
Authors: M. Buljan, S. R. C. Pinto, A. G. Rolo, J. Martín-Sánchez, M. J. M. Gomes, J. Grenzer, A. Mücklich, S. Bernstorff, V. Holý
Abstract: In this work we report on a self-assembled growth of a Ge quantum dot lattice in a single 600-nm-thick Ge+Al2O3 layer during magnetron sputtering deposition of a Ge+Al2O3 mixture at an elevated substrate temperature. The self-assembly results in the formation of a well-ordered threedimensional body-centered tetragonal quantum dot lattice within the whole deposited volume. The quantum dots formed are very small in size less than 4.0 nm, have a narrow size distribution and a large packing density. The parameters of the quantum dot lattice can be tuned by changing the deposition parameters. The self-ordering of the quantum dots is explained by diffusionmediated nucleation and surface-morphology effects and simulated by a kinetic Monte Carlo model.

Title: Critical Dynamics of Spin Boson Model
Authors: M. G. Vasin, S. V. Remizov, A. A. Elistratov
Abstract: In this work, we study the low-energy properties of the spin-boson model (SBM), which describes the dynamics of a 1/2 spin associated with a thermostat characterized by a power law spectral density, $f(\omega)\propto |\omega|^s$. The theoretical description is constructed in the Schwinger--Keldysh technique, based on the representation of the 1/2-spin by Majorana fermions. We study the critical dynamics of the system near the quantum phase transition by constructing and analyzing the system of renormalization group equations. Our theoretical approach is more universal, contrary to the one based on quantum classical mapping, since it is applicable for $0<s\leq 1$. We show that in both the ohmic case $s=1$, and subohmic case $0<s<1$, the second order quantum phase transition is observed in the model considered, and the critical magnetization exponent agrees with the exact hyperscaling result, $1/\delta=(1-s)/(1+s)$. Furthermore, we obtain the dependence of the critical value of the spin-boson coupling constant on the temperature of the bosonic thermal bath.

Title: Entanglement asymmetry dynamics in random quantum circuits
Authors: Filiberto Ares, Sara Murciano, Pasquale Calabrese, Lorenzo Piroli
Abstract: We study the dynamics of entanglement asymmetry in random unitary circuits (RUCs). Focusing on a local $U(1)$ charge, we consider symmetric initial states evolved by both local one-dimensional circuits and geometrically non-local RUCs made of two-qudit gates. We compute the entanglement asymmetry of subsystems of arbitrary size, analyzing the relaxation time scales. We show that the entanglement asymmetry of the whole system approaches its stationary value in a time independent of the system size for both local and non-local circuits. For subsystems, we find qualitative differences depending on their size. When the subsystem is larger than half of the full system, the equilibration time scales are again independent of the system size for both local and non-local circuits and the entanglement asymmetry grows monotonically in time. Conversely, when the subsystems are smaller than half of the full system, we show that the entanglement asymmetry is non-monotonic in time and that it equilibrates in a time proportional to the quantum-information scrambling time, providing a physical intuition. As a consequence, the subsystem-equilibration time depends on the locality of interactions, scaling linearly and logarithmically in the system size, respectively, for local and non-local RUCs. Our work confirms the entanglement asymmetry as a versatile and computable probe of symmetry in many-body physics and yields a phenomenological overview of entanglement-asymmetry evolution in typical non-integrable dynamics.

Title: Global symmetries of quantum lattice models under non-invertible dualities
Authors: Weiguang Cao, Yuan Miao, Masahito Yamazaki
Abstract: Non-invertible dualities/symmetries have become an important tool in the study of quantum field theories and quantum lattice models in recent years. One of the most studied examples is non-invertible dualities obtained by gauging a discrete group. When the physical system has more global symmetries than the gauged symmetry, it has not been thoroughly investigated how those global symmetries transform under non-invertible duality. In this paper, we study the change of global symmetries under non-invertible duality of gauging a discrete group $G$ in the context of (1+1)-dimensional quantum lattice models. We obtain the global symmetries of the dual model by focusing on different Hilbert space sectors determined by the $\mathrm{Rep}(G)$ symmetry. We provide general conjectures of global symmetries of the dual model forming an algebraic ring of the double cosets. We present concrete examples of the XXZ models and the duals, providing strong evidence for the conjectures.

Title: Director-layer dynamics in the smectic-ZA phase of a ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal
Authors: Arjun Ghimire, Bijaya Basnet, Hao Wang, Parikshit Guragain, Alan Baldwin, Robert Twieg, Oleg Lavrentovich, James Gleeson, Antal Jakli, Samuel Sprunt
Abstract: A dynamic light scattering study of director-layer fluctuations in the anti-ferroelectric smectic-ZA phase of the ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal DIO is reported. The dynamics are consistent with the distinctive feature of the ZA phase that the smectic layers form parallel to the axis of molecular orientational order (director). A model is developed to describe quantitatively the dispersion of the fluctuation relaxation rates. The model is based on a specialization of the elastic free energy density of the smectic-C phase to the case of 90 degree director tilt, a "first-order" approximation of the viscous stresses by their form for an incompressible uniaxial fluid, and a treatment of the effect of chevron layer structure that develops in planar sample cells due to temperature-dependent layer shrinkage, as documented in previous studies on DIO. From the modeling, the layer compression elastic constant is estimated to be ~100 times lower in the smectic-ZA phase than in an ordinary smectic-A liquid crystal. Possible effects of the antiferroelectric layer polarization on the director splay elasticity and viscosity are described. The temperature dependencies of the splay, twist, and bend elastic constants and associated viscosities in the higher temperature nematic phase are also presented.

Title: Structural and mechanical properties of W-Cu compounds characterized by a neural-network-based potential
Authors: Jianchuan Liu, Tao Chen, Sheng Mao, Mohan Chenb
Abstract: Tungsten-copper (W-Cu) compounds are widely utilized in various industrial fields due to their exceptional mechanical properties. In this study, we have developed a neural-network-based deep potential (DP) model that covers a wide range of temperatures, ranging from 0 to 3,000 K, and pressures, varying from 0 to 10 GPa. This study presents a model trained using density functional theory data for full concentration CuxW100-x compounds. Through this model, we systematically investigate the structural and mechanical properties of W-Cu alloys and have the following findings. First, the bulk modulus (B) and Young's modulus (E) of W-Cu alloys exhibit a linear decline as the Cu content increases, indicating a softening trend in the CuxW100-x compounds as the Cu concentration rises. Second, a higher Cu content results in higher critical strain and lower critical stress for these compounds. A brittle-to-ductile transition in the deformation mode predicted is predicted at around 37.5 at. % Cu content. Third, tensile loading tests in the W-Cu gradient structure reveal that Cu-poor region serves as a barrier, hindering shear band propagation while promoting new shear band formation in the Cu-rich region. The above results from the DP model are anticipated to aid in exploring the physical mechanisms underlying the complex phenomena of W-Cu systems and contribute to the advancement of methodologies for materials simulation.

Title: On the nature of rubber wear
Authors: R. Xu, N. Miyashita, B.N.J. Persson
Abstract: Rubber wear results from the removal of small (micrometer-sized) rubber particles through crack propagation. In this study, we investigate the wear behavior of Styrene-Butadiene Rubber (SBR) and Natural Rubber (NR) sliding on two different concrete surfaces under dry and wet conditions. Experiments were conducted at low sliding speeds ($\approx 1 \ {\rm mm/s}$) to minimize frictional heating and hydrodynamic effects. For two SBR compounds, we observe significantly higher wear rates in water compared to the dry state, with enhancement factors of $1.5-2.5$ for a low-glass-transition-temperature SBR compound ($T_{\rm g} = -50^\circ {\rm C}$) and approximately $4$ for a higher-glass-transition compound ($T_{\rm g} = -7^\circ {\rm C}$). In contrast, the NR compound showed no wear in water at low nominal contact pressures ($\sigma_0 \approx 0.12$, $0.16$, and $0.25 \ {\rm MPa}$), while at higher pressures ($\sigma_0 \approx 0.36$ and $0.49 \ {\rm MPa}$), the wear rates in dry and wet states were similar. The experimental results are analyzed using a recently developed rubber wear theory. The findings provide insights into the mechanisms of rubber wear under varying environmental and mechanical conditions, highlighting the influence of material properties, interfacial effects, and applied pressures on wear behavior.

Title: Spin-Triplet Excitonic Insulator in the Ultra-Quantum Limit of HfTe5
Authors: Jinyu Liu, Varsha Subramanyan, Robert Welser, Timothy McSorley, Triet Ho, David Graf, Michael T. Pettes, Avadh Saxena, Laurel E. Winter, Shi-Zeng Lin, Luis A. Jauregui
Abstract: More than fifty years ago, excitonic insulators, formed by the pairing of electrons and holes due to Coulomb interactions, were first predicted. Since then, excitonic insulators have been observed in various classes of materials, including quantum Hall bilayers, graphite, transition metal chalcogenides, and more recently in moire superlattices. In these excitonic insulators, an electron and a hole with the same spin bind together and the resulting exciton is a spin singlet. Here, we report the experimental observation of a spin-triplet exciton insulator in the ultra-quantum limit of a three-dimensional topological material HfTe5. We observe that the spin-polarized zeroth Landau bands, dispersing along the field direction, cross each other beyond a characteristic magnetic field in HfTe5, forming the one-dimensional Weyl mode. Transport measurements reveal the emergence of a gap of about 250 {\mu}eV when the field surpasses a critical threshold. By performing the material-specific modeling, we identify this gap as a consequence of a spin-triplet exciton formation, where electrons and holes with opposite spin form bound states, and the translational symmetry is preserved. The system reaches charge neutrality following the gap opening, as evidenced by the zero Hall conductivity over a wide magnetic field range (10 - 72 T). Our finding of the spin-triplet excitonic insulator paves the way for studying novel spin transport including spin superfluidity, spin Josephson currents, and Coulomb drag of spin currents in analogy to the transport properties associated with the layer pseudospin in quantum Hall bilayers.

Title: Universal scaling of electrostatic effects of a curved counter-electrode on the emitter field enhancement
Authors: Thiago A. de Assis, Fernando F. Dalll'Agnol
Abstract: Experiments on field electron emission from single-tip nanoemitters have typically been carried out using a counter-electrode with a finite curvature radius $R$, positioned at a distance $d_{\rm{gap}}$ from the emitter's apex. The effects of the counter-electrode's curvature on the apex field enhancement factor ($\gamma_{\rm{Ca}}$) of the emitter are still not understood. In this Letter, we theoretically explore how the apex field enhancement factor of an emitter, represented by a hemisphere on a cylindrical post (HCP) with apex radius $r_{\rm{a}} = 50$nm, is influenced by the curvature of a spherical-shaped counter-electrode. Importantly, our results show that for HCPs with sharpness aspect ratios typically between $10^2$ and $10^3$, there is a universal scaling such that $\gamma_{\rm{Ca}} = \gamma_{\rm{Pa}} \Psi\left({R}/{d_{\rm{gap}}} \right)$, where $\gamma_{\rm{Pa}}$ represents the apex field enhancement factor for the emitter assuming a planar counter-electrode, and $\Psi\left({R}/{d_{\rm{gap}}} \right)$ is a universal scaling function such that $\Psi \sim 1$ for ${R}/{d_{\rm{gap}}} \gg 1$ and $\Psi \sim \left({R}/{d_{\rm{gap}}} \right)^{\alpha}$, with $\alpha$ close to unity, for $ {R}/{d_{\rm{gap}}} \ll 1$. These findings help partially explain discrepancies observed in orhtodox field electron emission experiments, who reported that the effective $\gamma_{\rm{Ca}}$ values extracted from the current-voltage characteristics of single-tip carbon nanotubes typically underestimate the theoretical $\gamma_{\rm{Pa}}$ values when $R \sim d_{\rm{gap}} \gg r_{\rm{a}}$, a trend that is predicted by our results.

Title: Tuning the topological winding number by rolling up graphene
Authors: Ying-Je Lee, Yu-An Cheng, Yu-Jie Zhong, Ion Cosma Fulga, Ching-Hao Chang
Abstract: Nanoscrolls, radial superlattices formed by rolling up a nanomembrane, exhibit distinct electronic and magneto-transport properties compared to their flat counterparts. In this study, we theoretically demonstrate that the conductance can be precisely enhanced N times by rolling up graphene into an N-turn nanoscroll and applying a longitudinal magnetic field. This tunable positive magnetoconductance stems from the topological winding number which is activated in a carbon nanoscroll with magnetic flux and its maximum value purely increases with the scroll winding number (the number of turns). By integrating material geometry and topology, our work opens the door to artificially creating, customizing, and designing topological materials in rolled-up graphene-like systems.

Title: Enhanced Field-Free Perpendicular Magnetization Switching via spin splitting torque in Altermagnetic RuO2-based Heterostructures
Authors: Badsha Sekh, Hasibur Rahaman, Ramu Maddu, Pinkesh Kumar Mishra, Tianli Jin, S.N. Piramanayagam
Abstract: Current-induced spin-orbit torque (SOT) has emerged as a promising method for achieving energy-efficient magnetization switching in advanced spintronic devices. However, technological advancement has been inadequate because an external in-plane magnetic field is required to attain deterministic switching. Several approaches have been explored to address these challenges. In this work, we explored the potential of a newly emerged altermagnetic material RuO2 in combination with a Pt layer to achieve both field-free and low-power switching concurrently. We leveraged out-of-plane (OOP) spin polarization via the spin-splitter effect (SSE) in RuO2 for field-free switching (FFS) and in-plane spin polarization combined with spin Hall effect (SHE) in Pt for enhanced SOT efficiency. We revealed that the effective OOP magnetic field and FFS can be maximized by tuning the nominal thickness of the Pt underlayer and the direction of the applied current. We observed a significant enhancement in FFS at an optimized Pt thickness of 1.5 nm for an applied current density as low as 2.56e11 A/m2 at a crystal angle of 90 deg. Our study paves the way for energy-efficient spintronics devices for non-volatile memory, logic circuits, and neuromorphic computing.

Title: Ferroelectricity in undoped HfO2 down to one-unit-cell on Si substrate
Authors: Tiantian Wang, He Zhang, Yongjie Xie, Subi Du, Da Sheng, Zhaolong Liu, Sheng Wang, Hui Li, Qinghua Zhang, Kai Wang, Bing Xu, Xianggang Qiu, Yang Xu, Lin Gu, Xiaolong Chen
Abstract: Hafnium oxide (HfO2), particularly at low-dimensional scales, exhibits extensive promising applications in ultrahigh density devices like low-power logic and non-volatile memory devices due to its compatibility with current semiconductor technology1-5. However, achieving ferroelectricity (FE) at ultimate scale especially in undoped HfO2 remains challenging as the non-centrosymmetric FE phase, so-called O-III (space group: Pca21) is metastable and FE has a strong tendency of depolarization with the decrease in thickness6. Up to now, this phase has usually stabilized via doping with other elements7-9. But the minimum film thickness is still limited to 1 nm, about 2-unit-cell, to keep FE8. Thinner and undoped films, conducive to further miniature device size and avoid contamination during deposition process, have been a challenge to fabricate on Si substrates. Herein, we report the robust FE observed in undoped HfO2 ultrathin films directly grown on Si substrate via atomic layer deposition (ALD) and post-heat treat in vacuum. The so-fabricated ferroelectric O-III phase contains about 4.48 at% oxygen vacancy, is robust even monoclinic phase (space group: P21/c) coexists. The spontaneous and switchable polarization is remarkably stable, still surviving even in films down to 0.5 nm (one-unit-cell). Our results show the robust FE O-III phase can be obtained in films down to one-unit-cell in thickness on Si, providing a practical way to fabricating this important material in thickness limit.

Title: Stretching the Printability Metric in Direct-ink Writing with Highly Extensible Yield-Stress Fluids
Authors: Chaimongkol Saengow, Samya Sen, Joaquin Yus, Eliza E. Lovrich, Amanda G. Hoika, Kelly M. Chang, Arielle A. Pfeil, Nellie Haug, Amy J. Wagoner Johnson, Randy H. Ewoldt
Abstract: Direct-ink writing leverages the rheological complexity of yield-stress fluids to construct complex geometries, particularly those with large gaps across internal structures. However, extensional rheological properties have rarely been considered in work that studies rheology-printability correlations. Here, we test our hypothesis that extensional properties correlate with drawability, a key indicator of printability that signifies speed robustness, printing resolution, and gap-spanning performance. We formulated cementitious suspensions using hydroxyapatite (HAp) particles, independently tuning them for yield stress and extensibility, two crucial rheological properties, and test-printed. To enhance extensibility, we incorporated hydroxypropyl methylcellulose as a polymeric modifier, but this enhancement may decrease as yield stress increases, presenting a challenge in materials design. We modulated particle interactions to achieve a wide range of yield stress and extensibility, allowing for rigorous testing of our hypothesis. This approach created inks with high extensibility and high yield stress, generally considered mutually exclusive properties. We evaluated correlations between drawability and key rheological properties, finding the strongest positive correlation with extensional failure strains (strain-to-break) rather than yield stress. We establish a bijective property-manufacturing relationship (one-on-one mapping of shear yield stress to buildability and extensional strain-to-break to drawability) by combining our findings on drawability with previous studies on buildability. This relationship provides a comprehensive framework for designing high-performance inks that can be self-supporting, capable of high-speed printing, and allow gap-spanning features.

Title: Giant Third-Order Nonlinearity Induced by the Quantum Metric Quadrupole in Few-Layer WTe2
Authors: Xing-Yu Liu, An-Qi Wang, Dong Li, Tong-Yang Zhao, Xin Liao, Zhi-Min Liao
Abstract: The quantum geometric properties of topological materials underpin many exotic physical phenomena and applications. Quantum nonlinearity has emerged as a powerful probe for revealing these properties. The Berry curvature dipole in nonmagnetic materials and the quantum metric dipole in antiferromagnets have been explored by studying the second-order nonlinear Hall effect. Although the quadrupole moment of the quantum geometric tensor is theoretically predicted to induce higher-order quantum nonlinearity, the quantum metric quadrupole remains experimentally unexplored. Here, we report the quantum metric quadrupole induced third-order nonlinear longitudinal electrical response in few-layer WTe2, persisting up to room temperature. Angle-resolved third-harmonic current-voltage characteristics are found consistent with the intrinsic crystal symmetry of WTe2. Through temperature variation and scaling analysis, we identify the quantum metric quadrupole as the physical origin of the observed third-order longitudinal nonlinearity. Additionally, we determine the angle dependence of the quantum metric quadrupole, establishing third-order nonlinearity as an efficient method for revealing the quantum metric structure.

Title: Tensor cross interpolation approach for quantum impurity problems based on the weak-coupling expansion
Authors: Shuta Matsuura, Hiroshi Shinaoka, Philipp Werner, Naoto Tsuji
Abstract: We apply the tensor cross interpolation (TCI) algorithm to solve equilibrium quantum impurity problems with high precision based on the weak-coupling expansion. The TCI algorithm, a kind of active learning method, factorizes high-dimensional integrals that appear in the perturbative expansion into a product of low-dimensional ones, enabling us to evaluate higher-order terms efficiently. This method is free from the sign problem which quantum Monte Carlo methods sometimes suffer from, and allows one to directly calculate the free energy. We benchmark the TCI impurity solver on an exactly solvable impurity model, and find good agreement with the exact solutions. We also incorporate the TCI impurity solver into the dynamical mean-field theory to solve the Hubbard model, and show that the metal-to-Mott insulator transition is correctly described with comparable accuracy to the Monte Carlo methods. Behind the effectiveness of the TCI approach for quantum impurity problems lies the fact that the integrands in the weak-coupling expansion naturally have a low-rank structure in the tensor-train representation.

Title: Current-induced magnetoresistance hysteresis in the kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$
Authors: Han-Xin Lou, Xing-Guo Ye, Xin Liao, Qing Yin, Da-Peng Yu, Zhi-Min Liao
Abstract: We report the observation of current-modulated magnetoresistance hysteresis below the superconducting transition temperature in the kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. This highly tunable hysteresis behavior is confined to the superconducting state and vanishes when superconductivity is fully suppressed, directly linking magnetoresistance hysteresis to the superconducting order in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. Additionally, the superconducting diode effect driven by a small magnetic field is observed, indicating the enhanced electronic magnetochiral anisotropy by the chiral domain-wall scattering. Our findings position CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ as a promising platform for exploring nontrivial physical phenomena, including unconventional pairing mechanisms and topological superconductivity.

Title: Absence of superconductivity and density-wave transition in ambient-pressure tetragonal La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$
Authors: Mengzhu Shi, Yikang Li, Yuxing Wang, Di Peng, Shaohua Yang, Houpu Li, Kaibao Fan, Kun Jiang, Junfeng He, Qiaoshi Zeng, Dongsheng Song, Binghui Ge, Ziji Xiang, Zhenyu Wang, Jianjun Ying, Tao Wu, Xianhui Chen
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ under high pressure stimulates intensive research interests. These nickelates crystallize in an orthogonal/monoclinic structure with tilted NiO$_6$ octahedra at ambient pressure and enter a density-wave-like phase at low temperatures. The application of pressure suppresses the octahedral tilting and triggers a transition to tetragonal structure (I4/mmm), which is believed to be a key prerequisite for the emergence of superconducting state. Here, by developing a high oxidative environment growth technology, we report the first tetragonal nickelates La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ microcrystals without octahedral tilting at ambient pressure. In tetragonal La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, transport measurements find that both density-wave and superconducting transitions are absent up to 160 GPa, indicating a robust tetragonal metallic ground state. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the band structure of ambient-pressure tetragonal La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ involves more $d_{z2}$ orbital contribution to the Fermi surface, compared to the monoclinic phase or the high-pressure superconducting tetragonal phase. The concurrent absence of density-wave state and high-pressure superconductivity in our ambient-pressure tetragonal crystals of La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ suggests an underlying correlation between these two orders. It suggests that the tetragonal structure is not necessary, while the density-wave state is crucial for the superconductivity in nickelates. Our findings impose important constraints on the mechanism of pressure-induced superconductivity in nickelates and sheds new light on exploring ambient pressure high-temperature Ni-based superconductors.

Title: Engineering nonlinear Hall effect in bilayer graphene/black phosphorus heterostructures
Authors: Xing-Guo Ye, Zhen-Tao Zhang, Peng-Fei Zhu, Wen-Zheng Xu, An-Qi Wang, Zhi-Min Liao
Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals materials offer a highly tunable platform for generating emergent quantum phenomena through symmetry breaking. Stacking-induced symmetry breaking at interfaces provides an effective method to modulate their electronic properties for functional devices. Here, we strategically stack bilayer graphene with black phosphorus, a low-symmetry semiconductor, to break the symmetries and induce the nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE) that can persist up to room temperature. Intriguingly, it is found the NLHE undergoes sign reversals by varying the electrical displacement field under fixed carrier density. The scaling analysis reveals that the sign reversal of the NLHE is contributed from both the Berry curvature dipole (BCD) and extrinsic scatterings. The displacement field-induced sign reversal of the BCD indicates asymmetric distributions of Berry curvature hot spots across different Fermi pockets in bilayer graphene. Our findings suggest that symmetry engineering of van der Waals heterostructures is promising for room-temperature applications based on nonlinear quantum devices, such as high-frequency rectifiers and wireless charging.

Title: Heat Transport Hysteresis Generated through Frequency Switching of a Time-Dependent Temperature Gradient
Authors: Renai Chen, Galen T. Craven
Abstract: A stochastic energetics framework is applied to examine how periodically shifting the frequency of a time-dependent oscillating temperature gradient affects heat transport in a nanoscale molecular model. We specifically examine the effects that frequency switching, i.e., instantaneously changing the oscillation frequency of the temperature gradient, has on the shape of the heat transport hysteresis curves generated by a particle connected to two thermal baths, each with a temperature that is oscillating in time. Analytical expressions are derived for the energy fluxes in/out of the system and the baths, with excellent agreement observed between the analytical expressions and the results from nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. We find that the shape of the heat transport hysteresis curves can be significantly altered by shifting the frequency between fast and slow oscillation regimes. We also observe the emergence of features in the hysteresis curves such as pinched loops and complex multi-loop patterns due to the frequency shifting. The presented results have implications in the design of thermal neuromorphic devices such as thermal memristors and thermal memcapacitors.

Title: Inducing Spin Splitting and Anomalous Valley Hall Effect in A-Type AFM Fe$_2$C(OH)$_2$ through Electric Field and Janus Engineering
Authors: Ankita Phutela, Saswata Bhattacharya
Abstract: The antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials are distinguished by zero net magnetic moment, high resistance to external magnetic disturbances, and ultrafast dynamic responses. For advancing AFM materials in spintronic and valleytronic applications, achieving spontaneous valley polarization and the anomalous valley Hall effect (AVHE) is pivotal. We predict an A-type AFM monolayer Fe$_2$C(OH)$_2$, which shows a significant spontaneous valley polarization of 157 meV. In Fe$_2$C(OH)$_2$, spatial inversion symmetry (P) and time-reversal symmetry (T) are individually broken, yet the combined PT symmetry is preserved. This symmetry conservation leads to spin degeneracy, resulting in zero Berry curvature in the momentum space and absence of AVHE. However, a layer-locked hidden Berry curvature is produced, leading to the observation of the valley layer-spin Hall effect. Further, an external out-of-plane electric field can induce spin splitting by introducing layer-dependent electrostatic potential, enabling the layer-locked AVHE. Additionally, the introduction of a built-in electric field caused by the Janus structure also induces spin splitting in monolayer Fe$_2$C(OH)F due to the electric-potential-difference-AFM mechanism. The high out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy and realization of AVHE, offer promising opportunities for next-generation spintronic technologies.

Title: Quantum Emitters in Hexagonal Boron Nitride: Principles, Engineering and Applications
Authors: Thi Ngoc Anh Mai, Md Shakhawath Hossain, Nhat Minh Nguyen, Yongliang Chen, Chaohao Chen, Xiaoxue Xu, Quang Thang Trinh, Toan Dinh, Toan Trong Tran
Abstract: Solid-state quantum emitters, molecular-sized complexes releasing a single photon at a time, have garnered much attention owing to their use as a key building block in various quantum technologies. Among these, quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have emerged as front runners with superior attributes compared to other competing platforms. These attributes are attainable thanks to the robust, two-dimensional lattice of the material formed by the extremely strong B-N bonds. This review discusses the fundamental properties of quantum emitters in hBN and highlights recent progress in the field. The focus is on the fabrication and engineering of these quantum emitters facilitated by state-of-the-art equipment. Strategies to integrate the quantum emitters with dielectric and plasmonic cavities to enhance their optical properties are summarized. The latest developments in new classes of spin-active defects, their predicted structural configurations, and the proposed suitable quantum applications are examined. Despite the current challenges, quantum emitters in hBN have steadily become a promising platform for applications in quantum information science.

Title: Electron transport properties of heterogeneous interfaces in solid electrolyte interphase on lithium metal anodes
Authors: Xiangyi Zhou, Rongzhi Gao, Ziyang Hu, Weijun Zhou, YanHo Kwok, GuanHua Chen
Abstract: In rechargeable batteries, electron transport properties of inorganics in the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) critically determine the safety, lifespan and capacity loss of batteries. However, the electron transport properties of heterogeneous interfaces among different solid inorganics in SEI have not been studied experimentally or theoretically yet, although such heterogeneous interfaces exist inevitably. Here, by employing non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) method, we theoretically evaluated the atomic-scale electron transport properties under bias voltage for LiF/Li2O interfaces and single-component layers of them, since LiF and Li2O are common stable inorganics in the SEI. We reveal that heterogeneous interfaces orthogonal to the external electric-field direction greatly impede electron transport in SEI, whereas heterogeneous parallel-orientated interfaces enhance it. Structural disorders induced by densely distributed interfaces can severely interfere with electron transport. For each component, single-crystal LiF is highly effective to block electron transport, with a critical thickness of 2.9 nm, much smaller than that of Li2O (19.0 nm). This study sheds a new light into direct and quantitative understanding of the electron transport properties of heterogeneous interfaces in SEI, which holds promise for the advancement of a new generation of high-performance batteries.

Title: Strong shape-dependent intensity of inelastic light scattering by gold nanocrystals
Authors: Lucien Saviot, Vincent Laude
Abstract: We present a numerical approach to calculate inelastic light scattering spectra from gold nanocrystals, based on the finite element method. This approach is validated by comparison with previous analytic calculations for spherically symmetric scatterers. Superellipsoid nanocrystals are considered in order to smoothly vary the shape from octahedra to cubes via spheres, while preserving cubic symmetry. Spectra are calculated and discussed taking into account the irreducible representation of the involved vibration modes. A strong increase in the inelastically scattered light intensity is observed for small variations of the shape around the sphere. This increase is related to variations of the electric field inside the nanocrystals, which are very small for small nanospheres but increase quickly for non-spherical nanocrystals. This strong dependence with shape must be taken into account when interpreting experimental spectra acquired from inhomogeneous ensembles of nanocrystals whose shape dispersion are usually neglected. The overall changes in the spectra when varying the shape of the nanocrystals provide additional insight into previously published results. Preliminary calculations for chiral shapes further show a significant difference between spectra obtained with right or left circularly polarized light.

Title: Energy symmetry and interlayer wave function ratio of tunneling electrons in partially overlapped graphene
Authors: Ryo Tamura
Abstract: Oscillations of tunneling probability concerning the tunneling barrier thickness have been less studied than the decay length. In this paper, we theoretically study the dependence of the tunneling probability on the electron energy $E$ and barrier thickness, or overlap length, in partially overlapped graphene where a gap is formed only in the central bilayer region due to a perpendicular electric field. We compare an $\uparrow$ junction, where the current path must pass through interlayer states, with a $\downarrow$ junction, where such interlayer transmission is not required. The valley-reversed tunneling probability of the $\uparrow$ junction is symmetric concerning $E$, whereas other tunneling probabilities are not. Additionally, the valley valve effect spans the entire energy gap in double $\uparrow$ junctions, whereas it occurs only within a much narrower energy range in double $\downarrow$ junctions. Surprisingly, these results suggest that the interlayer wavefunction ratio $\beta$ has a more significant effect in the $\downarrow$ junction than in the $\uparrow$ junction. This can be understood through the energy symmetry arising from chirality operation, $\pi$ rotation, and probability conservation. This energy symmetry offers a new perspective for analyzing the effects of $\beta$.

Title: Anomalous Lattice Effect Originated Metal-Insulator Transition in FeSe$_x$
Authors: Shubham Purwar, Shinjini Paul, Kritika Vijay, R. Venkatesh, Soma Banik, P. Mahadevan, S. Thirupathaiah
Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation of the structural, electrical transport, and magnetic properties of FeSe$_{\it{x}}$ ($\it{x}$ = 1.14, 1.18, 1.23, 1.28, and 1.32) to unravel the mechanism of the metal-insulator transition observed in these systems. For this, we systematically evaluated the structural parameters of FeSe$_{\it{x}}$ as a function of Se concentration and temperature. We observe increased lattice constants and cell volume with increased Se concentration. On the other hand, the temperature-dependent XRD studies suggest unusual lattice change around the metal-insulator (MI) transition temperature of the respective compositions. This remarkable observation suggests that the anomalous lattice effect originates the MI transition in these systems. Additionally, our density of states (DOS) calculations on FeSe$_{1.14}$ qualitatively explain the MI transition, as the low-temperature (50 K) structure DOS suggests a metallic nature and the high-temperature (300 K) structure DOS shows a gap near the Fermi level.

Title: Thermodynamics of $s_{\pm}-to-s_{++}$ transition in iron pnictides in the vicinity of the Born limit
Authors: Vadim Shestakov, Maxim M. Korshunov
Abstract: To study thermodynamical properties of the disorder-induced transition between $s_{\pm}$ and $s_{++}$ superconducting gap functions, we calculate the grand thermodynamic potential $\Omega$ in the normal and the superconducting states. Expression for the difference between the two, $\Delta\Omega$, is derived for a two-band model for Fe-based systems with nonmagnetic impurities. The disorder is considered in a $\mathcal{T}$-matrix approximation within the multiband Eliashberg theory. In the vicinity of the Born limit near the $s_{\pm}$-to-$s_{++}$ transition, we find two solutions obtained for opposite directions of the system's evolution with respect to the impurity scattering rate. By calculating the change in entropy $\Delta S$ and the change in electronic specific heat $\Delta C$ from $\Delta\Omega$, we show that such a hysteresis is not due to the time-reversal symmetry breaking state, but it rather points out to the first order phase transition induced by the nonmagnetic disorder. Based on the $\Delta\Omega$ calculations, phase diagram is plotted representing the energetically favourable $s_{\pm}$ and $s_{++}$ states and the transition between them. At finite temperature, a first order phase transition line there is limited by a critical end point. Above that point, the sharp $s_{\pm} \to s_{++}$ transition transforms to a crossover between $s_{\pm}$ and $s_{++}$ states.

Title: Open questions on defining and computing the vapour-liquid surface tension by virial and test transformation approaches
Authors: Martin Thomas Horsch
Abstract: This work addresses four problems in defining and computing the surface tension of vapour-liquid interfaces: (1) The apparent kinetic contribution to the surface tension, and what it is that makes it appear; (2) the problem of defining the local virial, which for some purposes appears to be necessary; (3) the disagreement between results for spherical interfaces when using different methods, specifically the virial and the test area method; (4) how the surface tension values obtained from these methods can be related to the definition of the surface tension from thermodynamics - since if they cannot, it is a meaningless exercise to compute them. At the end, all these problems remain unsolved: They are "open questions."

Title: Correlation between magnetism and the Verwey transition in magnetite

Abstract: Seeking to unravel the enigmatic Verwey transition and its interplay with magnetism, we have conducted comprehensive measurements on the temperature-dependent electrical resistivity and magnetic moment of stoichiometric and doped-magnetite single crystals at temperatures reaching 1000 K. These investigations have allowed us to identify the Curie temperature, $T_C$, and other characteristic temperatures of the electrical resistivity. Remarkably, we have identified correlations between these temperatures and the Verwey temperature, $T_V$, indicating that the electrical transport properties and the mechanism of the Verwey transition are closely related to the magnetic properties.

Title: Weighted Point Configurations with Hyperuniformity: An Ecological Example and Models
Authors: Ayana Ezoe, Makoto Katori, Tomoyuki Shirai
Abstract: Random point configurations are said to be in hyperuniform states, if density fluctuations are anomalously suppressed in large-scale. Typical examples are found in Coulomb gas systems in two dimensions especially called log-gases in random matrix theory, in which points are repulsively correlated by long-range potentials. In infertile lands like deserts continuous survival competitions for water and nutrition will cause long-ranged repulsive interactions among plants. We have prepared digital data of spatial configurations of center-of-mass for bushes weighted by bush sizes which we call masses. Data analysis shows that such ecological point configurations do not show hyperuniformity as unmarked point processes, but are in hyperuniform states as marked point processes in which mass distributions are taken into account. We propose the non-equilibrium statistical-mechanics models to generate marked point processes having hyperuniformity, in which iterations of random thinning of points and coalescing of masses transform initial uncorrelated point processes into non-trivial point processes with hyperuniformity. Combination of real data-analysis and computer simulations shows the importance of strong correlations in probability law between spatial point configurations and mass distributions of individual points to realize hyperuniform marked point processes.

Title: Hydrophilic direct bonding of (100) diamond and deposited SiO$_2$ substrates
Authors: Tianyin Chen, Jeffrel Hermias, Salahuddin Nur, Ryoichi Ishihara
Abstract: Diamond has emerged as a leading material for solid-state spin quantum systems and extreme environment electronics. However, a major limitation is that most diamond devices and structures are fabricated using bulk diamond plates. The absence of a suitable diamond-on-insulator (DOI) substrate hinders the advanced nanofabrication of diamond quantum and electronic devices, posing a significant roadblock to large-scale, on-chip diamond quantum photonics and electronics systems. In this work, we demonstrate the direct bonding of (100) single-crystal (SC) diamond plates to PECVD-grown SiO$_2$/Si substrates at low temperatures and atmospheric conditions. The surfaces of the SiO$_2$ and diamond plates are then activated using oxygen plasma and piranha solution, respectively. Bonding occurs when the substrates are brought into contact with water in between and annealed at 200$^{\circ}$C under atmospheric conditions, resulting in a DOI substrate. We systematically studied the influence of piranha solution treatment time and diamond surface roughness on the shear strength of the bonded substrate, devising an optimal bonding process that achieves a high yield rate of 90$\%$ and a maximum shear strength of 9.6 MPa. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used for quantitative analysis of the surface chemicals at the bonding interface. It appears that the amount of -OH bindings increases with the initial roughness of the diamond, facilitating the strong bonding with the SiO$_2$. This direct bonding method will pave the way for scalable manufacturing of diamond nanophotonic devices and enable large-scale integration of diamond quantum and electronic systems.

Title: Charging of quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride - graphene heterostructures due to electrostatic screening
Authors: Madhava Krishna Prasad, Jonathan Paul Goss, Jonathan David Mar
Abstract: Defect color centers in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have gained significant interest as single-photon emitters and spin qubits for applications in a wide range of quantum technologies. As the integration of these solid-state quantum emitters into electronic devices necessitates electrical control, it is essential to gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of charge control for these defect color centers in hBN/graphene heterostructures. In this Letter, we show that screening due to the encapsulation of hBN with graphene modifies the electrical levels of hBN, leading to charge transfer. Furthermore, we show that the charged defects have low-energy barriers for defect reorientation which can be overcome by moderate gate voltages. This study shows that accurate modeling of the charge state of the defect is necessary to be able to electrically control defects.

Title: Coupling of plasmons to the two-magnon continuum in antiferromagnets
Authors: Pieter M. Gunnink, Alexander Mook
Abstract: The coupling of magnons and plasmons offers a promising avenue for hybrid quantum systems, facilitating coherent energy and information transfer between magnetic and charge excitations. However, existing mechanisms often depend on weak spin-orbit coupling or temperature-activated processes, limiting their robustness for low-temperature quantum technologies. Here, we propose a novel coupling mechanism between plasmons and the two-magnon continuum in antiferromagnetic insulators, which operates at zero temperature and does not require spin-orbit coupling. Using a model system consisting of a two-dimensional electron gas on an insulating antiferromagnetic substrate, we show that the electric field of the plasmons interacts with the magnetically mediated electric polarization in the antiferromagnet, arising from bonds with broken inversion symmetry. This interaction enables strong coupling to the spin-conserving two-magnon continuum, allowing for efficient hybridization.

Title: Super-enhanced Sensitivity in Non-Hermitian Systems at Infernal Points
Authors: Shu-Xuan Wang, Zhongbo Yan
Abstract: The emergence of exceptional points in non-Hermitian systems represents an intriguing phenomenon characterized by the coalescence of eigenenergies and eigenstates. When a system approaches an exceptional point, it exhibits a heightened sensitivity to perturbations compared to the conventional band degeneracy observed in Hermitian systems. This sensitivity, manifested in the splitting of the eigenenergies, is amplified as the order of the exceptional point increases. Infernal points constitute a unique subclass of exceptional points, distinguished by their order escalating with the expansion of the system's size. In this paper, we show that, when a non-Hermitian system is at an infernal point, a perturbation of strength $\epsilon$, which couples the two opposing boundaries of the system, causes the eigenenergies to split according to the law $\sqrt[k]{\epsilon}$, where $k$ is an integer proportional to the system's size. Utilizing the perturbation theory of Jordan matrices, we demonstrate that the exceptional sensitivity of the eigenenergies at infernal points to boundary-coupling perturbations is a ubiquitous phenomenon, irrespective of the specific form of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. Notably, we find that this phenomenon remains robust even when the system deviates slightly from the infernal point. The universal nature and robustness of this phenomenon suggest potential applications in enhancing sensor sensitivity.

Title: Magnetic phase diagram of cuprates and universal scaling laws
Authors: Yves Noat, Alain Mauger, William Sacks
Abstract: In this article we consider the magnetic field phase diagram of hole-doped high-$T_c$ cuprates, which has been given much less attention than the temperature diagram. In the framework of the {\it pairon model}, we show that the two characteristic energies, the pair binding energy (the gap $\Delta_p$) and the condensation energy ($\beta_c$) resulting from pair correlations, give rise to two major magnetic fields, the upper critical field $B_{c2}$ and a second field, $B_{pg}$, associated with the pseudogap (PG). The latter implies a second length scale in addition to the coherence length, characteristic of incoherent pairs. Universal scaling laws for both $B_{c2}$ and $B_{pg}$ are derived: $B_{c2}$ scales with the critical temperature, $B_{c2}/T_c\simeq 1.65$ T/K, in agreement with many experiments, and $B_{pg}$ has a similar scaling with respect to $T^*$. Finally, Fermi arcs centered on the nodal directions are predicted to appear as a function of magnetic field, an effect testable experimentally.

Title: Topologically Charged Vortices at Superconductor/Quantum Hall Interfaces
Authors: Enderalp Yakaboylu, Thomas Schmidt
Abstract: We explore interface states between a type-II $s$-wave superconductor (SC) and a Chern insulator in the integer quantum Hall (QH) regime. Our results show that the effective interaction at this boundary gives rise to two emergent Abelian Higgs fields, representing paired electrons at the SC/QH interface. These fields couple to a gauge field that includes both Chern-Simons term, originating from the QH sector, and Maxwell term. Using this framework, we investigate the effects of magnetic flux vortices on the SC/QH interface. The emergence of the Chern-Simons term significantly modifies the magnetic penetration depth, influencing the Abrikosov lattice period and potentially altering the superconducting behavior at the interface. Furthermore, we demonstrate that vortex solutions at the interface carry a fractional charge of $e/2$, which reflects the ratio between the effective Chern-Simons level parameter and the charge of the Cooper pairs.

Title: Universal Catalyst Design Framework for Electrochemical Hydrogen Peroxide Synthesis Facilitated by Local Atomic Environment Descriptors
Authors: Zhijian Liu, Yan Liu, Bingqian Zhang, Yuqi Zhang, Tianxiang Gao, Mingzhe Li, Xue Jia, Di Zhang, Heng Liu, Xuqiang Shao, Li Wei, Hao Li, Weijie Yang
Abstract: Developing a universal and precise design framework is crucial to search high-performance catalysts, but it remains a giant challenge due to the diverse structures and sites across various types of catalysts. To address this challenge, herein, we developed a novel framework by the refined local atomic environment descriptors (i.e., weighted Atomic Center Symmetry Function, wACSF) combined with machine learning (ML), microkinetic modeling, and computational high-throughput screening. This framework is successfully integrated into the Digital Catalysis Database (DigCat), enabling efficient screening for 2e- water oxidation reaction (2e- WOR) catalysts across four material categories (i.e., metal alloys, metal oxides and perovskites, and single-atom catalysts) within a ML model. The proposed wACSF descriptors integrating both geometric and chemical features are proven effective in predicting the adsorption free energies with ML. Excitingly, based on the wACSF descriptors, the ML models accurately predict the adsorption free energies of hydroxyl ({\Delta}GOH*) and oxygen ({\Delta}GO*) for such a wide range of catalysts, achieving R2 values of 0.84 and 0.91, respectively. Through density functional theory calculations and microkinetic modeling, a universal 2e- WOR microkinetic volcano model was derived with excellent agreement with experimental observations reported to date, which was further used to rapidly screen high-performance catalysts with the input of ML-predicted {\Delta}GOH*. Most importantly, this universal framework can significantly improve the efficiency of catalyst design by considering multiple types of materials at the same time, which can dramatically accelerate the screening of high-performance catalysts.

Title: Fermi surface origin of the low-temperature magnetoresistance anomaly
Authors: Yejun Feng, Yishu Wang, T. F. Rosenbaum, P. B. Littlewood, Hua Chen
Abstract: A magnetoresistance (MR) anomaly at low temperatures has been observed in a variety of systems, ranging from low-dimensional chalcogenides to spin and charge density wave (SDW/CDW) metals and, most recently, topological semimetals. In some systems parabolic magnetoresistance can rise to hundreds of thousands of times its low-temperature, zero-field value. While the origin of such a dramatic effect remains unresolved, these systems are often low-carrier-density compensated metals, and the physics is expected to be quasi-classical. Here we demonstrate that this MR anomaly in temperature also exists in high conductivity good metals with large Fermi surfaces, namely Cr, Mo, and W, for both linear and quadratic field-dependent regimes with their non-saturation attributed to open orbit and electron-hole compensation, respectively. We provide evidence that quantum transport across sharp Fermi surface arcs, but not necessarily the full cyclotron orbit, governs this low-temperature MR anomaly. In Cr, extremely sharp curvatures are induced by superposed lattice and SDW band structures. One observes an overlay of the temperature dependence of three phenomena: namely, MR at a constant high field, linear MR in the low-field limit, and Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations of the lightest orbit. In Mo, the temperature dependence of low-T MR anomaly extends beyond those of its SdH oscillations but disappears at temperatures where Kohler's scaling reemerges. In the low-temperature and high-field limit, large magnetoresistance from carriers circling quantum orbits is the three-dimensional analogy to the zero-conductance state of carrier localization in the integer quantum Hall effect, especially with regard to the adverse effect of disorder.

Title: Magnetic Properties of epitaxial $\text{Re}/\text{Co}_{1-x}\text{Au}_{x}/\text{Pt}$ heterostructures

Abstract: We investigate epitaxial $\text{Co}(20 \, \text{Å})$ and $\text{Co}_{1-x}\text{Au}_{x}(20 \, \text{Å})$ alloy thin-films surrounded by asymmetric heavy metals layers of $\text{Re}(10 \, \text{Å})$ as a buffer and $\text{Pt}(30 \, \text{Å})$ as a cap to study the magnetic anisotropy, interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (iDMI) and damping. The increase of Au from 0% to 25% in the $\text{Co}_{1-x}\text{Au}_{x}$ alloy generates the spin-reorientation transition of around 13% of Au. The increase in Au concentration provides a significant decrease in saturation magnetization from 1690 kA/m to 982 kA/m measured for Co and $\text{Co}_{75}\text{Au}_{25}$, respectively. The effective anisotropy constant $\text{K}_{eff}$ is elevated up to 0.33 $\text{MJ/m}^{3}$ by changing the Au content. Further, our investigations of the magnetization dynamics have confirmed that the overall effective damping constant rises with the Au concentration which can be attributed to the spin pumping effect. The spin pumping leads to the highest value of effective spin mixing conductance $g^{(\uparrow \downarrow)} \approx 2.91 \times 10^{18} \, \text{m}^{-2}$ in the $\text{Co}_{90}\text{Au}_{10}(20 \, \text{Å})$ system, while the lowest value of $g^{(\uparrow \downarrow)} \approx 2.25 \times 10^{18} \, \text{m}^{-2}$ is found for the $\text{Co}(20 \, \text{Å})$ system. Additionally, we have investigated the iDMI strength, and the amplitude of iDMI decreases with increasing Au concentration. The highest surface iDMI constant value equal to 2.62 pJ/m is observed for Co.

Title: Wafer-scale robust graphene electronics under industrial processing conditions

Abstract: For commercial grade electronic devices, stable structures are required to ensure a long device life span. When such devices contain nanomaterials like graphene, it is crucial that these materials resist industrial processes and harsh environments. For environments that contain water, graphene delamination is a notorious drawback, as water intercalation and eventually liftoff readily occur in aqueous and especially in alkaline solutions. This limitation renders graphene incompatible with key wafer-processing steps in the semiconductor industry. In this work, a covalent pyrene-based adhesion layer is synthesized in a facile, two-step procedure. Through {\pi}-{\pi} interactions, the adhesion of graphene to silicon wafers was maintained under conditions that resemble harsh processes, i.e. acidic and alkaline solutions, several organic solvents, and sonication. Moreover, they could be produced with a device measurement yield up to 99.7% and reproducible device-to-device electronic performance on 4-inch silicon wafers. Our results show that a straightforward functionalization of silicon wafers with an adhesive layer can be directly applicable in industrial-scale fabrication processes, giving access to robust graphene field effect devices that are built to last long.

Title: Coherent interaction of 2s and 1s exciton states in TMDC monolayers
Authors: Max Wegerhoff, Moritz Scharfstädt, Stefan Linden, Andrea Bergschneider
Abstract: We use femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopy to study the coherent interaction of excited exciton states in WSe2 and MoSe2 monolayers via the optical Stark effect. For co-circularly polarized pump and probe, we measure a blueshift which points to a repulsive interaction between the 2s and 1s exciton states. The determined 2s-1s interaction strength is on par with that of the 1s-1s, in agreement with the semiconductor Bloch equations. Furthermore, we demonstrate the existence of a 2s-1s biexciton bound state in the cross-circular configuration in both materials and determine their binding energy.

Title: Hole Transfer Dynamics in Thin Films of Mixed-Dimensional Quasi-2D Perovskites

Abstract: The understanding of charge transfer processes in mixed-dimensional quasi-2D perovskites is crucial for their application in high-performance photovoltaic devices. In this work, we investigate the link between charge transport dynamics and morphology in a thin film of quasi-2D perovskites (PEA2MAn-1PbnI3n+1), grown with a distinct dimensionality gradient, where the n=1 phase is concentrated near the substrate and phases with higher dimensionality progressively increase in concentration toward the surface. By selectively exciting the n=4 phase, we observe efficient hole transfer to the n=2 and n=3 phases occurring within few tens of picoseconds after excitation. In contrast, the n=1 phase acts as a hole-blocking layer, limiting the overall charge transport efficiency. These results emphasize the critical importance of minimizing or eliminating the n=1 layer to enhance charge carrier separation and transport, offering valuable insights into the optimization of quasi-2D perovskite-based solar cells.

Title: Stability of the Mott phase in excitonic double layers
Authors: K. Ziegler, R. Ya. Kezerashvili
Abstract: We study the stability of excitonic Mott phases in the presence of a periodic potential and a non-local exciton-exciton interaction. The non-local interaction is treated in a mean-field approximation, while the local repulsion of the excitons is treated in a hopping expansion. The convergence of the latter is the criterion for the stability of the Mott phase with respect to quantum and thermal fluctuations. This hybrid approach enables us to establish a phase diagram for a bosonic Mott to superfluid transition. Our results could be useful to interpret recent experiments on electron-hole crystals in van der Waals heterostructures.

Title: Fully-frustrated octahedral antiferromagnet: emergent complexity in external field
Authors: A. S. Gubina, T. Ziman, M. E. Zhitomirsky
Abstract: Octahedral antiferromagnets are distinguished by crystal lattices composed of octahedra of magnetic ions. In the fully frustrated case, the Heisenberg Hamiltonian can be represented as a sum of squares of total spins for each octahedral block. We study the fully frustrated spin model for a lattice of edge-shared octahedra, which corresponds to the J1-J2 fcc antiferromagnet with J2/J1 = 1/2. The magnetization process at this strongly frustrated point features a remarkably rich sequence of different magnetic phases that include fractional plateaus at m = 1/3 and 2/3 values of the total magnetization. By performing extensive Monte Carlo simulations we construct the H-T phase diagram of the classical model with eight field-induced states, which acquire stability via the order by disorder mechanism. These antiferromagnetic states have distinct spin configurations of their octahedral blocks. The same spin configurations are also relevant for the fully frustrated corner-shared model bringing an apparent similarity to their field-induced states.

Title: Microtubes and nanomembranes by ion-beam-induced exfoliation of $\beta$-Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$
Authors: Duarte Magalhães Esteves, Ru He, Calliope Bazioti, Sérgio Magalhães, Miguel Carvalho Sequeira, Luís Filipe Santos, Alexander Azarov, Andrej Kuznetsov, Flyura Djurabekova, Katharina Lorenz, Marco Peres
Abstract: This paper reports an innovative process to fabricate $\beta$-Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$ microtubes and nanomembranes based on ion implantation in (100)-oriented single-crystals. We show that, under specific flux and fluence conditions, the irradiation-induced strain profile promotes the detachment and rolling-up of a thin surface layer, forming a microtube. The strain-disorder interplay was investigated in detail for Cr-implanted $\beta$-Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$ with a range of complementary methods, showing an excellent agreement between experimental and simulation data, and suggesting an exfoliation mechanism that is correlated with the anisotropic nature of the $\beta$-Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$ monoclinic system and its easy-cleavage planes. Moreover, these microtubes can be unrolled upon a subsequent annealing step, resulting in nanomembranes with bulk-like crystalline quality that can be transferred to other substrates. The recovery of the implantation-induced damage under thermal annealing has also been studied, showing a remarkable recovery at moderate temperatures (~500 °C). This observation underscores the potential of this method for the scalable production of nanomembranes with improved reproducibility compared to conventional mechanical exfoliation techniques. Importantly, such exfoliation can be done employing different ions, providing simultaneous $\beta$-Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$ doping, chosen to control the structural, optical, magnetic and electrical properties of the nanomembranes, thus tailoring them to fit the desired applications.

Title: Dimensional Crossover and Emergence of Novel Phases in Puckered PdSe$_2$ under Pressure
Authors: Tanima Kundu, Soumik Das, Koushik Dey, Boby Joseph, Mainak Palit, Sanjoy Kr Mahatha, Kapildeb Dolui, Subhadeep Datta
Abstract: We investigate the pressure-driven structural and electronic evolution of PdSe\(_2\) using powder X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and first-principles calculations. Beyond 2.3 GPa, suppression of the Jahn-Teller distortion induces in-plane lattice expansion and metallization. Around 4.8 GPa, the interlayer \(d_{z^2}-\pi^*\) orbital hybridization drives the dimensional crossover, facilitating the transformation from the 2D distorted to a 3D undistorted pyrite phase. Above 9 GPa, a novel phase emerges, characterized by octahedral distortions in the $d$ orbitals of Pd. Structural analysis suggests the presence of marcasite (\(Pnnm\)) or arsenopyrite (\(P2_1/c\)) phase with orthorhombic and monoclinic configurations, respectively. Furthermore, the observed phonon anomaly and electronic structure modifications, including the emergence of flat bands in the high-pressure phases, elucidate the fundamental mechanisms underlying the previously reported exotic superconductivity with an enhanced critical temperature. These results highlight the pivotal role of dimensional crossover and structural transitions in tuning the electronic properties of puckered materials, providing pathways for novel functionalities.

Title: Bound states and deconfined spinons in the dynamical structure factor of the $J_1 - J_2$ spin-1 chain
Authors: Aman Sharma, Mithilesh Nayak, Henrik M. Rønnow, Frédéric Mila
Abstract: Using a time-dependent density matrix renormalization group approach, we study the dynamical structure factor of the $J_1 - J_2$ spin-1 chain. As $J_2$ increases, the magnon mode develops incommensurability. The system undergoes a first-order transition at $J_2 = 0.76 J_1$, and at that point, domain walls lead to a continuum of fractional quasi-particles or spinons. By studying small variations in $J_2$ around the transition point, we observe the confinement of spinons into bound states in the spectral function and find a smooth evolution of the spectrum into magnon modes away from the phase transition. We employ the single-mode approximation to accurately account for the dispersion of the magnon mode away from the phase transition and describe the associated continua and bound states. We extend the single-mode approximation to describe the dispersion of a spinon at the phase transition point and obtain its dispersion throughout the Brillouin zone. This allows us to relate the incommensurability at and around the transition point to the competition between a negative nearest-neighbour hopping amplitude and a positive next-nearest-neighbour one for the domain wall.

Title: Long-distance genuine multipartite Entanglement between Magnetic Defects in Spin Chains
Authors: Mirko Consiglio, Jovan Odavić, Riccarda Bonsignori, Gianpaolo Torre, Marcin Wieśniak, Fabio Franchini, Salvatore M. Giampaolo, Tony J. G. Apollaro
Abstract: We investigate the emergence and properties of long-distance genuine multipartite entanglement, induced via three localized magnetic defects, in a one-dimensional transverse-field XX spin-$1/2$ chain. Using both analytical and numerical techniques, we determine the conditions for the existence of bound states localized at the defects. We find that the reduced density matrix (RDM) of the defects exhibits long-distance genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) across the whole range of the Hamiltonian parameter space, including regions where the two-qubit concurrence is zero. We quantify the entanglement by using numerical lower bounds for the GME concurrence, as well as by analytically deriving the GME concurrence in regions where the RDM is of rank two. Our work provides insights into generating multipartite entanglement in many-body quantum systems via local control techniques.

Title: Weak and strong turbulence in self-focusing and defocusing media
Authors: Vladimir Rosenhaus, Gregory Falkovich
Abstract: While the focusing and defocusing Nonlinear Schrodinger Equations have similar behavior in the weak turbulence regime, they must differ dramatically in the strong turbulence regime. Here, we show that this difference is already present at next-to-leading order in the nonlinearity in the weak turbulence regime: The one-loop correction to the interaction vertex suppresses repulsion (like screening in electrodynamics), leading to a steeper spectrum in the defocusing case. In contrast, attraction enhancement (like antiscreening in chromodynamics) makes the spectrum less steep in the focusing case. To describe strong turbulence, we consider a vector model in the limit of a large number of components. A large-N kinetic equation, valid at all scales, can be derived analytically. It has an inverse-cascade solution whose two asymptotics, at high and low wavenumbers, describe weak and strong turbulence, respectively. We find two forms of universality in the strong turbulence spectrum: in focusing media it is independent of the flux magnitude, while in defocusing media it is independent of the bare coupling constant, with the largest scale appearing instead.

Title: The BCS-Bogoliubov gap equation with external magnetic field and the first-order phase transition
Authors: Shuji Watanabe
Abstract: We deal with a type I superconductor in a constant external magnetic field. We obtain the BCS-Bogoliubov gap equation with external magnetic field and apply the implicit function theorem to it. We show that there is a unique magnetic field (the critical magnetic field) given by a smooth function of the temperature and that there is also a unique nonnegative solution (the gap function) given by a smooth function of both the temperature and the external magnetic field. Using the grand potential, we show that the transition from the normal state to the superconducting state in a type I superconductor is of the first order. Moreover we obtain the explicit expression for the entropy gap.

Title: A topology optimisation framework to design test specimens for one-shot identification or discovery of material models
Authors: Saeid Ghouli, Moritz Flaschel, Siddhant Kumar, Laura De Lorenzis
Abstract: The increasing availability of full-field displacement data from imaging techniques in experimental mechanics is determining a gradual shift in the paradigm of material model calibration and discovery, from using several simple-geometry tests towards a few, or even one single test with complicated geometry. The feasibility of such a "one-shot" calibration or discovery heavily relies upon the richness of the measured displacement data, i.e., their ability to probe the space of the state variables and the stress space (whereby the stresses depend on the constitutive law being sought) to an extent sufficient for an accurate and robust calibration or discovery process. The richness of the displacement data is in turn directly governed by the specimen geometry. In this paper, we propose a density-based topology optimisation framework to optimally design the geometry of the target specimen for calibration of an anisotropic elastic material model. To this end, we perform automatic, high-resolution specimen design by maximising the robustness of the solution of the inverse problem, i.e., the identified material parameters, given noisy displacement measurements from digital image correlation. We discuss the choice of the cost function and the design of the topology optimisation framework, and we analyse a range of optimised topologies generated for the identification of isotropic and anisotropic elastic responses.

Title: Local slip length and surfactant effects on liquid-infused surfaces
Authors: Sofia Saoncella, Julien Cerutti, Théo Lenavetier, Kasra Amini, Fredrik Lundell, Shervin Bagheri
Abstract: Robust surfaces capable of reducing flow drag, controlling heat and mass transfer, and resisting fouling in fluid flows are important for various applications. In this context, textured surfaces impregnated with a liquid lubricant show promise due to their ability to sustain a liquid-liquid layer that induces slippage. However, theoretical and numerical studies suggest that the slippage can be compromised by surfactants in the overlying fluid, which contaminate the liquid-liquid interface and generate Marangoni stresses. In this study, we use Doppler-optical coherence tomography, an interferometric imaging technique, combined with numerical simulations to investigate how surfactants influence the slip length of lubricant-infused surfaces with longitudinal grooves in a laminar flow. We introduce surfactants by adding tracer particles (milk) to the working fluid (water). Local measurements of slip length at the liquid-liquid interface are significantly smaller than theoretical predictions for clean interfaces (Schönecker & Hardt 2013). In contrast, measurements are in good agreement with numerical simulations of fully immobilized interfaces, indicating that milk particles adsorbed at the interface are responsible for the reduction in slippage. This work provides the first experimental evidence that liquid-liquid interfaces within textured surfaces can become immobilized in the presence of surfactants and flow.

Title: Spacing ratios in mixed-type systems
Authors: Hua Yan
Abstract: The distribution of the consecutive level-spacing ratio is now widely used as a tool to distinguish integrable from chaotic quantum spectra, mostly due to its avoiding of the numerical spectral unfolding. Similar to the use of the Rosenzweig-Porter approach to obtain the Berry-Robnik distribution of level-spacings in mixed-type systems, in this work we extend this approach to derive analytically the distribution of spacing ratios, for random matrices comprised of independent integrable blocks and chaotic blocks. We have numerically confirmed this analytical result using random matrix theory in paradigmatic models such as the quantum kicked rotor and the Hénon-Heiles system.

Title: Measurement-induced L\'evy flights of quantum information
Authors: Igor Poboiko, Marcin Szyniszewski, Christopher J. Turner, Igor V. Gornyi, Alexander D. Mirlin, Arijeet Pal
Abstract: We explore a model of free fermions in one dimension, subject to frustrated (non-commuting) local measurements across adjacent sites, which resolves the fermions into non-orthogonal orbitals, misaligned from the underlying lattice. For maximal misalignment, superdiffusive behavior emerges from the vanishing of the measurement-induced quasiparticle decay rate at one point in the Brillouin zone, which generates fractal-scaling entanglement entropy $S \propto \ell^{1/3}$ for a subsystem of length $\ell$. We derive an effective non-linear sigma model with long-range couplings responsible for Lévy flights in entanglement propagation, which we confirm with large-scale numerical simulations. When the misalignment is reduced, the entanglement exhibits, with increasing $\ell$, consecutive regimes of superdiffusive, $S\propto \ell^{1/3}$, diffusive, $S\propto \ln \ell$, and localized, $S = \rm{const}$, behavior. Our findings show how intricate fractal-scaling entanglement can be produced for local Hamiltonians and measurements.

Title: Contrastive Language-Structure Pre-training Driven by Materials Science Literature
Authors: Yuta Suzuki, Tatsunori Taniai, Ryo Igarashi, Kotaro Saito, Naoya Chiba, Yoshitaka Ushiku, Kanta Ono
Abstract: Understanding structure-property relationships is an essential yet challenging aspect of materials discovery and development. To facilitate this process, recent studies in materials informatics have sought latent embedding spaces of crystal structures to capture their similarities based on properties and functionalities. However, abstract feature-based embedding spaces are human-unfriendly and prevent intuitive and efficient exploration of the vast materials space. Here we introduce Contrastive Language--Structure Pre-training (CLaSP), a learning paradigm for constructing crossmodal embedding spaces between crystal structures and texts. CLaSP aims to achieve material embeddings that 1) capture property- and functionality-related similarities between crystal structures and 2) allow intuitive retrieval of materials via user-provided description texts as queries. To compensate for the lack of sufficient datasets linking crystal structures with textual descriptions, CLaSP leverages a dataset of over 400,000 published crystal structures and corresponding publication records, including paper titles and abstracts, for training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CLaSP through text-based crystal structure screening and embedding space visualization.

Title: A Denser Hydrogen Inferred from First-Principles Simulations Challenges Jupiter's Interior Models
Authors: Cesare Cozza, Kousuke Nakano, Saburo Howard, Hao Xie, Ravit Helled, Guglielmo Mazzola
Abstract: First-principle modeling of dense hydrogen is crucial in materials and planetary sciences. Despite its apparent simplicity, predicting the ionic and electronic structure of hydrogen is a formidable challenge, and it is connected with the insulator-to-metal transition, a century-old problem in condensed matter. Accurate simulations of liquid hydrogen are also essential for modeling gas giant planets. Here we perform an exhaustive study of the equation of state of hydrogen using Density Functional Theory and quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We find that the pressure predicted by Density Functional Theory may vary qualitatively when using different functionals. The predictive power of first-principle simulations is restored by validating each functional against higher-level wavefunction theories, represented by computationally intensive variational and diffusion Monte Carlo calculations. Our simulations provide evidence that hydrogen is denser at planetary conditions, compared to currently used equations of state. For Jupiter, this implies a lower bulk metallicity (i.e., a smaller mass of heavy elements). Our results further amplify the inconsistency between Jupiter's atmospheric metallicity measured by the Galileo probe and the envelope metallicity inferred from interior models.

Title: Is fixed-node diffusion quantum Monte Carlo reproducible?
Authors: Flaviano Della Pia, Benjamin Shi, Yasmine S.

Abstract: Fixed-node diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (FN-DMC) is a widely-trusted many-body method for solving the Schrödinger equation, known for its reliable predictions of material and molecular properties. Furthermore, its excellent scalability with system complexity and near-perfect utilization of computational power makes FN-DMC ideally positioned to leverage new advances in computing to address increasingly complex scientific problems. Even though the method is widely used as a computational gold standard, reproducibility across the numerous FN-DMC code implementations has yet to be demonstrated. This difficulty stems from the diverse array of DMC algorithms and trial wave functions, compounded by the method's inherent stochastic nature. This study represents a community-wide effort to address the titular question, affirming that: Yes, FN-DMC is reproducible (when handled with care). Using the water-methane dimer as the canonical test case, we compare results from eleven different FN-DMC codes and show that the approximations to treat the non-locality of pseudopotentials are the primary source of the discrepancies between them. In particular, we demonstrate that, for the same choice of determinantal component in the trial wave function, reliable and reproducible predictions can be achieved by employing the T-move (TM), the determinant locality approximation (DLA), or the determinant T-move (DTM) schemes, while the older locality approximation (LA) leads to considerable variability in results. This work lays the foundation to establish accurate and reproducible FN-DMC estimates for all future studies across applications in materials science, physics, chemistry, and biology.

Title: Neural network enhanced cross entropy benchmark for monitored circuits
Authors: Yangrui Hu, Yi Hong Teoh, William Witczak-Krempa, Roger G. Melko
Abstract: We explore the interplay of quantum computing and machine learning to advance experimental protocols for observing measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPT) in quantum devices. In particular, we focus on trapped ion monitored circuits and apply the cross entropy benchmark recently introduced by [Li et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 220404 (2023)], which can mitigate the post-selection problem. By doing so, we reduce the number of projective measurements -- the sample complexity -- required per random circuit realization, which is a critical limiting resource in real devices. Since these projective measurement outcomes form a classical probability distribution, they are suitable for learning with a standard machine learning generative model. In this paper, we use a recurrent neural network (RNN) to learn a representation of the measurement record for a native trapped-ion MIPT, and show that using this generative model can substantially reduce the number of measurements required to accurately estimate the cross entropy. This illustrates the potential of combining quantum computing and machine learning to overcome practical challenges in realizing quantum experiments.

Title: Sunny.jl: A Julia Package for Spin Dynamics

Abstract: Sunny is a Julia package designed to serve the needs of the quantum magnetism community. It supports the specification of a very broad class of spin models and a diverse suite of numerical solvers. These include powerful methods for simulating spin dynamics both in and out of equilibrium. Uniquely, it features a broad generalization of classical and semiclassical approaches to SU(N) coherent states, which is useful for studying systems exhibiting strong spin-orbit coupling or local entanglement effects. Sunny also offers a well-developed framework for calculating the dynamical spin structure factor, enabling direct comparison with scattering experiments. Ease of use is a priority, with tools for symmetry-guided modeling and interactive visualization.

Title: Is there a conflict between causality and diamagnetism?
Authors: Niclas Westerberg, Stephen M. Barnett
Abstract: There is a long-standing apparent conflict between the existence of diamagnetism and causality as expressed through the Kramers-Kronig relations. In essence, using causality arguments, along with a handful of other seemingly well-justified assumptions, one can show that diamagnetism is impossible. Nature naturally does not mind this, and experiments show diamagnetic responses from magnetic media. We present a resolution to this issue, which also explains the absence of observed dia-electric responses in optical media.

Title: New scaling of Adam-Gibbs relation in glass-forming systems
Authors: Szymon Starzonek, Aleksandra Drozd-Rzoska, Sylwester J. Rzoska
Abstract: In this letter we introduced a new scaling method based on Adam-Gibbs model. Moreover, generalised critical-like expression of configurational entropy S_C (T)=S_0 (1-T_K/T)^n is used. Obtained values of pseudocritical exponent n seem to be universal for studied systems and corresponds well with thermodynamic data. Relation between dynamic portrayal represented by primary relaxation time and thermodynamic (specific heat capacity) is in a good agreement.

Title: Thermodynamics of exponential Kolmogorov-Nagumo averages
Authors: Pablo A. Morales, Jan Korbel, Fernando E. Rosas
Abstract: This paper investigates generalized thermodynamic relationships in physical systems where relevant macroscopic variables are determined by the exponential Kolmogorov-Nagumo average. We show that while the thermodynamic entropy of such systems is naturally described by Rényi's entropy with parameter $\gamma$, an ordinary Boltzmann distribution still describes their statistics under equilibrium thermodynamics. Our results show that systems described by exponential Kolmogorov-Nagumo averages can be interpreted as systems originally in thermal equilibrium with a heat reservoir with inverse temperature $\beta$ that are suddenly quenched to another heat reservoir with inverse temperature $\beta' = (1-\gamma)\beta$. Furthermore, we show the connection with multifractal thermodynamics. For the non-equilibrium case, we show that the dynamics of systems described by exponential Kolmogorov-Nagumo averages still observe a second law of thermodynamics and the H-theorem. We further discuss the applications of stochastic thermodynamics in those systems -- namely, the validity of fluctuation theorems -- and the connection with thermodynamic length. namic length.

Title: Symmetry fractionalization, mixed-anomalies and dualities in quantum spin models with generalized symmetries
Authors: Heidar Moradi, Ömer M. Aksoy, Jens H. Bardarson, Apoorv Tiwari
Abstract: We investigate the gauging of higher-form finite Abelian symmetries and their sub-groups in quantum spin models in spatial dimensions $d=2$ and 3. Doing so, we naturally uncover gauged models with dual higher-group symmetries and potential mixed 't Hooft anomalies. We demonstrate that the mixed anomalies manifest as the symmetry fractionalization of higher-form symmetries participating in the mixed anomaly. Gauging is realized as an isomorphism or duality between the bond algebras that generate the space of quantum spin models with the dual generalized symmetry structures. We explore the mapping of gapped phases under such gauging related dualities for 0-form and 1-form symmetries in spatial dimension $d=2$ and 3. In $d=2$, these include several non-trivial dualities between short-range entangled gapped phases with 0-form symmetries and 0-form symmetry enriched Higgs and (twisted) deconfined phases of the gauged theory with possible symmetry fractionalizations. Such dualities also imply strong constraints on several unconventional, i.e., deconfined or topological transitions. In $d=3$, among others, we find, dualities between topological orders via gauging of 1-form symmetries. Hamiltonians self-dual under gauging of 1-form symmetries host emergent non-invertible symmetries, realizing higher-categorical generalizations of the Tambara-Yamagami fusion category.

Title: Microscopic theory of field-tuned topological transitions in the Kitaev honeycomb model
Authors: Jagannath Das, Aman Kumar, Vikram Tripathi
Abstract: We microscopically construct an abelian mutual Chern-Simons lattice gauge theory for magnetic field-tuned topological transitions in the Kitaev model and obtain a complete characterization of the phases, including their quasiparticles. At low fields for both ferro and antiferromagnetic (FM(AFM)) Kitaev interactions, we demonstrate nonabelian Ising topological order (ITO), and explicitly construct the Majorana anyon as an intrinsic excitation -- a twist defect in our \textit{abelian} gauge theory. For the AFM case, an abelian chiral phase appears at intermediate fields with trivial topological order and fermionic bulk excitations. Remarkably, both the ITO phase and the intermediate phase have the same chiral central charge $c=1/2,$ implying no change in the quantized thermal Hall response across the transition. For the FM case, there is a direct transition from ITO to a partially polarized nontopological phase. Our study completes the proof of Kitaev's original proposal of the low-field ITO with $c=1/2$ going beyond his mean-field arguments by including the crucial effect of the gauge fluctuations, and provides a resolution of the debate surrounding the intermediate field phase in the AFM case.

Title: Role of magnetic anisotropy constant orders and thermal noise on skyrmion formation in the Co/Pt square nanostructure
Authors: Tamali Mukherjee, V Satya Narayana Murthy
Abstract: Skyrmions, which are topologically stable magnetic structures, have manifested promising features to be used as an information carrier in new-age, non-volatile data storage devices. In this article, Co/Pt square nano-structure with Co-free layer thickness in the range of 1 nm to 5 nm is taken to study the controlled creation of skyrmions. The magnetization dynamics controlled by the current-induced spin transfer torque help to nucleate skyrmions by transforming the perpendicularly magnetized ground state. This process leads to a stable state of isolated skyrmions via a complex transformation of the Neel wall following its image inversion. Skyrmion numbers vary with increasing thickness as the current density gradually increases. The impact of higher-order anisotropy constants (up to the second order) on the relaxed state of a system, compared to first-order anisotropy alone, has been examined. Additionally, the effect of temperature on the formation of skyrmions has been analyzed for all thicknesses.

Title: Phonon-limited valley life times in single-particle bilayer graphene quantum dots
Authors: Luca Banszerus, Katrin Hecker, Lin Wang, Samuel Möller, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Guido Burkard, Christian Volk, Christoph Stampfer
Abstract: The valley degree of freedom in 2D semiconductors, such as gapped bilayer graphene (BLG) and transition metal dichalcogenides, is a promising carrier of quantum information in the emerging field of valleytronics. While valley dynamics have been extensively studied for moderate band gap 2D~semiconductors using optical spectroscopy techniques, very little is known about valley lifetimes in narrow band gap BLG, which is difficult to study using optical techniques. Here, we report single-particle valley relaxation times ($T_1$) exceeding several microseconds in electrostatically defined BLG quantum dots (QDs) using a pulse-gating technique. The observed dependence of $T_1$ on perpendicular magnetic field can be understood qualitatively and quantitatively by a model in which $T_1$ is limited by electron-phonon coupling. We identify the coupling to acoustic phonons via the bond length change and via the deformation potential as the limiting mechanisms.

Title: Correlation decoupling of Casimir interaction in an electrolyte driven by external electric fields
Authors: Guangle Du, David S. Dean, Bing Miao, Rudolf Podgornik
Abstract: It has been established for a long time that the long range van der Waals or thermal Casimir interaction between two semi-infinite dielectrics separated by a distance $H$ is screened by an intervening electrolyte. Here we show how this interaction is modified when an electric field of strength $E$ is applied parallel to the dielectric boundaries, leading to a non-equilibrium steady state with a current. The presence of the field induces a long range thermal repulsive interaction, scaling just like the thermal Casimir interaction between dielectrics without the intervening electrolyte, {\em i.e.} as $1/H^3$. At small $E$ the effect is of order $E^2$ while at large fields it saturates to an $E$ independent value. We explain the results in terms of a decoupling mechanism between the charge density fluctuations of cations and anions at large applied fields.

Title: Odd-frequency superconducting pairing due to multiple Majorana edge modes in driven topological superconductors
Authors: Eslam Ahmed, Shun Tamura, Yukio Tanaka, Jorge Cayao
Abstract: Majorana zero modes have been shown to be the simplest quasiparticles exhibiting pure odd-frequency pairing, an effect that has so far been theoretically established in the static regime. In this work, we investigate the formation of Majorana modes and odd-frequency pairing in $p$-wave spin-polarized superconductors under a time-dependent drive. We first show that the driven system hosts multiple Majorana modes emerging at zero and $\pi$, whose formation can be controlled by an appropriate tuning of the drive frequency and chemical potential, in agreement with previous studies. Then we explore the induced pair correlations and find that odd-frequency spin-polarized $s$-wave pairing is broadly induced, acquiring large values in the presence of Majorana modes. We discover that, while odd-frequency pairing is proportional to $\sim1/\omega$ in the presence of Majorana zero modes, it is proportional to $\sim 1/(\omega-\pi\hbar/T)$ in the presence of Majorana $\pi$ modes, where $T$ is the periodicity of the drive. Furthermore, we find that the amount of odd-frequency pairing becomes larger when multiple Majorana modes appear but the overall divergent profile as a function of frequency remains. We also show that the divergent odd-frequency pairing is robust against scalar disorder. Notably, we establish a spectral bulk-boundary correspondence between the amount of boundary odd-$\omega$ pairing and the bulk topological invariants in driven chiral systems, which we show to be protected by chiral symmetry and is thus robust against disorder. Our work thus paves the way for understanding the emergent pair correlations in driven topological superconductors

Title: Towards a classification of mixed-state topological orders in two dimensions
Authors: Tyler Ellison, Meng Cheng
Abstract: The classification and characterization of topological phases of matter is well understood for ground states of gapped Hamiltonians that are well isolated from the environment. However, decoherence due to interactions with the environment is inevitable -- thus motivating the investigation of topological orders in the context of mixed states. Here, we take a step toward classifying mixed-state topological orders in two spatial dimensions by considering their (emergent) generalized symmetries. We argue that their 1-form symmetries and the associated anyon theories lead to a partial classification under two-way connectivity by quasi-local quantum channels. This allows us to establish mixed-state topological orders that are intrinsically mixed, i.e., that have no ground state counterpart. We provide a wide range of examples based on topological subsystem codes, decohering $G$-graded string-net models, and "classically gauging" symmetry-enriched topological orders. One of our main examples is an Ising string-net model under the influence of dephasing noise. We study the resulting space of locally-indistinguishable states and compute the modular transformations within a particular coherent space. Based on our examples, we identify two possible effects of quasi-local quantum channels on anyon theories: (1) anyons can be incoherently proliferated -- thus reducing to a commutant of the proliferated anyons, or (2) the system can be "classically gauged", resulting in the symmetrization of anyons and an extension by transparent bosons. Given these two mechanisms, we conjecture that mixed-state topological orders are classified by premodular anyon theories, i.e., those for which the braiding relations may be degenerate.

Title: Dynamical Mean-Field Theory of Complex Systems on Sparse Directed Networks
Authors: Fernando L. Metz
Abstract: Although real-world complex systems typically interact through sparse and heterogeneous networks, analytic solutions of their dynamics are limited to models with all-to-all interactions. Here, we solve the dynamics of a broad range of nonlinear models of complex systems on sparse directed networks with a random structure. By generalizing dynamical mean-field theory to sparse systems, we derive an exact equation for the path-probability describing the effective dynamics of a single degree of freedom. Our general solution applies to key models in the study of neural networks, ecosystems, epidemic spreading, and synchronization. Using the population dynamics algorithm, we solve the path-probability equation to determine the phase diagram of a seminal neural network model in the sparse regime, showing that this model undergoes a transition from a fixed-point phase to chaos as a function of the network topology.

Title: Inertial effects in discrete sampling information engines
Authors: Aubin Archambault, Caroline Crauste-Thibierge, Sergio Ciliberto, Ludovic Bellon
Abstract: We describe an experiment on an underdamped mechanical oscillator used as an information engine. The system is equivalent to an inertial Brownian particle confined in a harmonic potential whose center is controlled by a feedback protocol which measures the particle position at a specific sampling frequency $1/{\tau}$. Several feedback protocols are applied and the power generated by the engine is measured as a function of the oscillator parameters and the sampling frequency. The optimal parameters are then determined. The results are compared to the theoretical predictions and numerical simulations on overdamped systems. We highlight the specific effects of inertia, which can be used to increase the amount of power extracted by the engine. In the regime of large $\tau$, we show that the produced work has a tight bound determined by information theories.

Title: Large positive magnetoconductance in carbon nanoscrolls
Authors: Yu-Jie Zhong, Jia-Cheng Li, Xuan-Fu Huang, Ying-Je Lee, Ting-Zhen Chen, Jia-Ren Zhang, Angus Huang, Hsiu-Chuan Hsu, Carmine Ortix, Ching-Hao Chang
Abstract: We theoretically demonstrate that carbon nanoscrolls -- spirally wrapped graphene layers with open endpoints -- can be characterized by a large positive magnetoconductance. We show that when a carbon nanoscroll is subject to an axial magnetic field of several Tesla, the ballistic conductance at low carrier densities of the nanoscroll has an increase of about 200%. Importantly, we find that this positive magnetoconductance is not only preserved in an imperfect nanoscroll (with disorder or mild inter-turn misalignment) but can even be enhanced in the presence of on-site disorder. We prove that the positive magnetoconductance comes about the emergence of magnetic field-induced zero energy modes, specific of rolled-up geometries. Our results establish curved graphene systems as a new material platform displaying sizable magnetoresistive phenomena.

Title: Dipole representation of composite fermions in graphene quantum Hall systems
Authors: Sonja Predin
Abstract: The even denominator fractional quantum Hall effect has been experimentally observed in graphene in the fourth Landau level ($n = 3$). This paper is motivated by recent studies regarding the possibility of pairing and the nature of the ground state in this system. By extending the dipole representation of composite fermions, we adapt this framework to the context of graphene's quantum Hall systems, with a focus on half-filled Landau levels. We derive an effective Hamiltonian that incorporates the key symmetry of half-filled Landau levels, particularly particle-hole symmetry. At the Fermi level, the energetic instability of the dipole state is influenced by the interplay between topology and symmetry, driving the system towards a critical state. We explore the possibility that this critical state stabilizes into one of the paired states with well-defined pairing solutions. However, our results demonstrate that the regularized state which satisfies boost invariance at Fermi level and lacks well-defined pairing instabilities emerges as energetically more favorable. Therefore, we find no well-defined pairing instabilities of composite fermions in the dipole representation in the half-filled fourth Landau level ($ n = 3 $) of electrons in graphene. Although the theory of composite fermions has its limitations, further research is required to investigate other possible configurations. We discuss the consistency of our results with experimental and numerical studies, and their relevance for future research efforts.

Title: Efficient post-selection in light-cone correlations of monitored quantum circuits

Abstract: We consider how to target evolution conditioned on atypical measurement outcomes in monitored quantum circuits, i.e., the post-selection problem. We show that for a simple class of measurement schemes, post-selected light-cone dynamical correlation functions can be obtained efficiently from the averaged correlations of a different unitary circuit. This connects rare measurement outcomes in one circuit to typical outcomes in another one. We derive conditions for the existence of this rare-to-typical mapping in brickwork quantum circuits made of XYZ gates. We illustrate these general results with a model system that exhibits a dynamical crossover (a smoothed dynamical transition) in event statistics, and discuss extensions to more general dynamical correlations.

Title: Quantum-critical and dynamical properties of the XXZ bilayer with long-range interactions
Authors: Patrick Adelhardt, Antonia Duft, Kai Phillip Schmidt
Abstract: We study the XXZ square lattice bilayer model with antiferromagnetic non-frustrating long-range interactions that decay as a power law with the distance. Employing large-scale high-order series expansions with classical Monte Carlo integration (pCUT+MC) about the limit of isolated Heisenberg dimers in the rung-singlet phase, we investigate the one-triplon dispersion and the corresponding spectral weight along the parameter axes of the long-range decay exponent and the XXZ anisotropy. By tuning the latter, we observe two extended regions of 3d XY and Ising universality as well as 3d Heisenberg critical exponents at the isotropic point. Along the decay exponent axis, we demonstrate mean-field behavior for strong long-range couplings, the aforementioned three universality classes for sufficiently weak interactions, and continuously varying critical exponents in-between. Using extrapolations we are able to determine the one-triplon dispersion in a quantitative fashion up to the quantum-critical breakdown of the rung-singlet phase. This allows to extract the dynamical critical exponent $z$ as a function of the decay exponent, displaying a universal behavior. The detected $z<1$ for small decay exponents is in agreement with the expected properties of the anomalous Goldstone modes in the ordered phases with broken continuous symmetry.

Title: Long wavelength interdomain phonons and instability of dislocations in small-angle twisted bilayers
Authors: V.V. Enaldiev
Abstract: We develop a theory for long wavelength phonons originating at dislocations separating domains in small-angle twisted homobilayers of 2D materials such as graphene and MX$_2$ transition metal dichalcogenides (M=Mo,W; X=S,Se). We find that both partial and perfect dislocations, forming due to lattice relaxation in the twisted bilayers with parallel and anti-parallel alignment of unit cells of the constituent layers, respectively, support several one-dimensional subbands of the {\it interdomain} phonons. We show that spectrum of the lowest gapless subband is characterized by imaginary frequencies, for wave-numbers below a critical value, dependent on the dislocation orientation, which indicates an instability for long enough straight partial and perfect dislocations. We argue that pinning potential and/or small deformations of the dislocations could stabilize the gapless phonon spectra. The other subbands are gapped, with subband bottoms lying below the frequency of interlayer shear mode in domains, which facilitates their detection with the help of optical and magnetotransport techniques.

Title: Low temperature state in strontium titanate microcrystals using in situ multi-reflection Bragg coherent X-ray diffraction imaging
Authors: David Yang, Sung Soo Ha, Sungwook Choi, Jialun Liu, Daniel Treuherz, Nan Zhang, Zheyi An, Hieu Minh Ngo, Muhammad Mahmood Nawaz, Ana F. Suzana, Longlong Wu, Gareth Nisbet, Daniel G. Porter, Hyunjung Kim, Ian K. Robinson
Abstract: Strontium titanate is a classic quantum paraelectric oxide material that has been widely studied in bulk and thin films. It exhibits a well-known cubic-to-tetragonal antiferrodistortive phase transition at 105 K, characterized by the rotation of oxygen octahedra. A possible second phase transition at lower temperature is suppressed by quantum fluctuations, preventing the onset of ferroelectric order. However, recent studies have shown that ferroelectric order can be established at low temperatures by inducing strain and other means. Here, we used in situ multi-reflection Bragg coherent x-ray diffraction imaging to measure the strain and rotation tensors for two strontium titanate microcrystals at low temperature. We observe strains induced by dislocations and inclusion-like impurities in the microcrystals. Based on radial magnitude plots, these strains increase in magnitude and spread as the temperature decreases. Pearson's correlation heat maps show a structural transition at 50 K, which could possibly be the formation of a low-temperature ferroelectric phase in the presence of strain. We do not observe any change in local strains associated with the tetragonal phase transition at 105 K.

Abstract: We use density functional methods to identify the atomic configurations of H and D atoms trapped by O impurities and embedded in bulk Nb. We calculate the double-well potential for O-H and O-D impurities, wave functions, and tunnel splittings for H and D atoms. Our results are in agreement with those obtained from analysis of heat capacity and neutron scattering measurements on Nb with low concentrations of O-H and O-D.

Title: Enhanced Krylov Methods for Molecular Hamiltonians via Tensor Hypercontraction
Authors: Yu Wang, Maxine Luo, Christian B. Mendl
Abstract: We present a matrix product operator (MPO) construction based on the tensor hypercontraction (THC) format for ab initio molecular Hamiltonians. Such an MPO construction dramatically lowers the memory requirement and cost scaling of Krylov subspace methods. These can find low-lying eigenstates while avoiding local minima and simulate quantum time evolution with high accuracy. In our approach, the molecular Hamiltonian is represented as a sum of products of four MPOs, each with a bond dimension of only $2$. Iteratively applying the MPOs to the current quantum state in matrix product state (MPS) form, summing and re-compressing the MPS leads to a scheme with the same asymptotic memory cost as the bare MPS and reduces the computational cost scaling compared to the Krylov method based on a conventional MPO construction. We provide a detailed theoretical derivation of these statements and conduct supporting numerical experiments to demonstrate the advantage. We also propose that our method is compatible with parallel computing, which is essential for calculating large-size systems.

Title: Condensate Size Control by Net Charge
Authors: Chengjie Luo, Nathaniel Hess, Dilimulati Aierken, Yicheng Qiang, Jerelle A. Joseph, David Zwicker
Abstract: Biomolecular condensates are complex droplets comprising diverse molecules that interact using various mechanisms. Condensation is often driven by short-ranged attraction, but net charges can also mediate long-ranged repulsion. Using molecular dynamics simulations and an equilibrium field theory, we show that such opposing interactions can suppress coarsening so that many droplets of equal size coexist at equilibrium. This size control depends strongly on the charge asymmetry between constituents, while the strength of the short-ranged attractions has a weak influence. Essentially, droplets expel ions, so they cannot screen electrostatics effectively, implying droplets acquire a net charge and cannot grow indefinitely. Our work reveals how electrostatic effects control droplet size, which is relevant for understanding biomolecular condensates and creating synthetic patterns in chemical engineering.

Title: Self-organization and memory in an disordered solid subject to random loading
Authors: Muhittin Mungan, Dheeraj Kumar, Sylvain Patinet, Damien Vandembroucq
Abstract: We consider self-organization and memory formation in a mesoscopic model of an amorphous solid subject to a random shear strain protocol confined to a strain range $\pm \varepsilon_{\rm max}$. We develop proper read-out protocols to show that the response of the driven system retains a memory of the strain range, which can be subsequently retrieved. Our findings generalize previous results obtained upon oscillatory driving and suggest that self-organization and memory formation of disordered materials can emerge under more general conditions, such as a disordered system interacting with its fluctuating environment. The self-organization results in a correlation between the dynamics of the system and its environment. We conclude by discussing our results within the context of environmental sensing, highlighting their generalizability to adaptation strategies of simple organisms under changing conditions.

Title: Zero external magnetic field quantum standard of resistance at the 10-9 level

Abstract: The quantum anomalous Hall effect holds promise as a disruptive innovation in condensed matter physics and metrology, as it gives access to Hall resistance quantization in terms of the von-Klitzing constant RK = h/e2 at zero external magnetic field. In this work, we study the accuracy of Hall resistance quantization in a device based on the magnetic topological insulator material (V,Bi,Sb)2Te3. We show that the relative deviation of the Hall resistance from RK at zero external magnetic field is (4.4 +/- 8.7) nohm/ohm when extrapolated to zero measurement current, and (8.6 +/- 6.7) nohm/ohm when extrapolated to zero longitudinal resistivity (each with combined standard uncertainty, k = 1), which sets a new benchmark for the quantization accuracy in topological matter. This precision and accuracy at the nohm/ohm level (or 10-9 of relative uncertainty) achieve the thresholds for relevant metrological applications and establish a zero external magnetic field quantum standard of resistance - an important step towards the integration of quantum-based voltage and resistance standards into a single universal quantum electrical reference.

Title: Kinetics, thermodynamics, and catalysis of the cation incorporation into GeO2, SnO2, and (SnxGe1-x)O2 during suboxide molecular beam epitaxy
Authors: Wenshan Chen, Kingsley Egbo, Joe Kler, Andreas Falkenstein, Jonas Lähnemann, Oliver Bierwagen
Abstract: Rutile GeO$_2$ is a promising ultra-wide bandgap semiconductor for future power electronic devices whose alloy with the wide bandgap semiconductor rutile-SnO$_2$ enables bandgap engineering and the formation of heterostructure devices. The (Sn$_x$Ge$_{1-x}$)O$_2$ alloy system is in its infancy and molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) is a well-suited technique for its thin-film growth, yet presents challenges in controlling the alloy composition and growth rate. To understand and mitigate this challenge, the present study comprehensively investigates the kinetics and thermodynamics of suboxide incorporation into GeO$_2$, SnO$_2$, and (Sn$_x$Ge$_{1-x}$)O$_2$ during suboxide MBE, the latest development in oxide MBE using suboxide sources. We find suboxide MBE to simplify the growth kinetics, offering better control over growth rates than conventional MBE but without supporting cation-driven oxide layer etching. During binary growth, SnO incorporation is kinetically favored due to its higher oxidation efficiency and lower vapor pressure compared to those of GeO. In (Sn$_x$Ge$_{1-x}$)O$_2$ growth, however, the GeO incorporation is preferred and the SnO incorporation is suppressed, indicating a catalytic effect, where SnO promotes GeO incorporation through cation exchange. The origin of this cation exchange is likely thermodynamic yet calls for further theoretical studies. Our experimental study provides guidance for controlling the growth rate and alloy composition of (Sn$_x$Ge$_{1-x}$)O$_2$ in suboxide MBE, highlighting the impact of the substrate temperature and active oxygen flux besides that of the mere SnO:GeO flux stoichiometry. The results are likely transferable to further physical and chemical vapor deposition methods, such as conventional and hybrid MBE, pulsed laser deposition, mist- or metalorganic chemical vapor deposition.

Title: Microscopic Modeling of Polarization Dynamics in Leaky Dielectrics: Insights into Ferroelectric-Like Behavior
Authors: Igor Ricardo Filgueira e Silva, Ovidiu Lipan, Fabian Hartmann, Sven Höfling, Victor Lopez-Richard
Abstract: Based on a microscopic model of nonequilibrium carrier generation in a leaky dielectric, we analytically derive hysteresis loops for the dielectric response of non-polar, non-ferroelectric materials. We demonstrate how complex dielectric responses can emerge solely from the influence of transport processes that depend on energy levels, voltage polarity, and asymmetries in charge transfer rates. By combining Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy and voltammetry, we address critical questions related to the microscopic mechanisms in poorly conductive systems dominated by displacement currents. The impedance analysis, extended to higher-order harmonics, provides deeper insights into the dynamic behavior of dielectric materials, emphasizing the need to correlate impedance spectroscopy with dielectric spectroscopy for a thorough understanding of dipole relaxation and transport phenomena. Our approach provides a fully analytical framework that directly correlates microscopic charge dynamics with macroscopic dielectric responses, offering enhanced accuracy and predictive capability for systems dominated by displacement currents.

Title: Supersymmetry-like tunneling current noise as a probe of Goldstino excitation in a Bose-Fermi mixture
Authors: Tingyu Zhang
Abstract: The Goldstino, which is a fermionic Nambu-Goldstone mode, has been predicted in a Bose-Fermi mixture when the supersymmetry is broken. To detect this excitation mode, we theoretically investigate the shot noise of the supersymmetry-like tunneling current in a weakly interacting ultracold Bose-Fermi mixture. The Fano factor, which is defined by the noise-to-current ratio, reflect the elementary carriers of the tunneling process. The change of the Fano factor microscopically as the density changes evinces a crossover from the quasiparticle transport to multiparticle (Goldstino) transport. The tunneling channel can also be changed by tuning the potential barrier.

Title: High-order van Hove singularities and nematic instability in the kagome superconductor CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$
Authors: Bikash Patra, Amrita Mukherjee, Bahadur Singh
Abstract: ATi$_3$Bi$_5$ (A = Cs or Rb) are emerging topological kagome metals that exhibit superconductivity and nematicity without intertwining translational symmetry-breaking charge orders. In this work, we explore the fermiology of their titanium kagome electrons and identify a set of sublattice-pure, high-order van Hove singularities (VHSs) that can suppress charge ordering and enhance electronic correlations and superconductivity. Our calculations of charge susceptibility for kagome bands with both normal and high-order VHSs emphasize the role of these VHSs in driving electronic nematicity in CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$. Additionally, we compute the phonon spectrum and electron-phonon interactions for CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$ under pristine, doped, and kagome-exposed surface conditions, revealing its robustness against structural instabilities while enhancing the superconducting transition temperature. Our work positions ATi$_3$Bi$_5$ as a key platform for investigating superconductivity and electronic nematicity without translational symmetry-breaking states in kagome metals.

Title: Entropy alternatives for equilibrium and out of equilibrium systems
Authors: Eugenio E. Vogel, Francisco J. Peña, G. Saravia, P. Vargas
Abstract: We propose an entropy-related function (non-repeatability) that describes dynamical behaviors in complex systems. A normalized version of this function (mutability) has been previously used in statistical physics. To illustrate their characteristics, we apply these functions to different systems: (a) magnetic moments on a square lattice and (b) real seismic data extracted from the IPOC-2007-2014 catalog. These systems are well-established in the literature, making them suitable benchmarks for testing the new approach. Shannon entropy is used as a reference to facilitate comparison, enabling us to highlight similarities, differences, and the potential benefits of the new measure. Notably, non-repeatability and mutability are sensitive to the order in which the data sequence is collected, distinguishing them from traditional entropy measures.

Title: Ferroelectric switchable altermagnetism
Authors: Mingqiang Gu, Yuntian Liu, Haiyuan Zhu, Kunihiro Yananose, Xiaobing Chen, Yongkang Hu, Alessandro Stroppa, Qihang Liu
Abstract: We propose a novel ferroelectric switchable altermagnetism effect, the reversal of ferroelectric polarization is coupled to the switching of altermagnetic spin splitting. We demonstrate the design principles for the ferroelectric altermagnets and the additional symmetry constraints necessary for switching the altermagnetic spin splitting through flipping the electric polarization based on the state-of-the-art spin-group symmetry techniques. 22 ferroelectric altermagnets are found by screening through the 2001 experimental reported magnetic structures in the MAGNDATA database and 2 of them are identified as ferroelectric switchable altermagnets. Using the hybrid improper ferroelectric material [C(NH2)3]Cr(HCOO)3 as an example, we show how the altermagnetic spin splitting is tightly coupled to the ferroelectric polarization, providing an ideal platform for designing electric-field-controllable multiferroic devices. Finally, we find that such manipulation of altermagnetism can be detected by monitoring the physical quantities that are related to the non-vanishing Berry curvature dipole, such as the linearly polarized photogalvanic spin current.

Title: Insights into Dermal Permeation of Skin Oil Oxidation Products from Enhanced Sampling Molecular Dynamics Simulation
Authors: Rinto Thomas, Praveen Ranganath Prabhakar, Douglas J. Tobias, Michael von Domaros
Abstract: The oxidation of human sebum, a lipid mixture covering our skin, generates a range of volatile and semi-volatile carbonyl compounds that contribute largely to indoor air pollution in crowded environments. Kinetic models have been developed to gain a deeper understanding of this complex multiphase chemistry, but they rely partially on rough estimates of kinetic and thermodynamic parameters, especially those describing skin permeation. Here, we employ atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to study the translocation of selected skin oil oxidation products through a model stratum corneum membrane. We find these simulations to be non-trivial, requiring extensive sampling with up to microsecond simulation times, in spite of employing enhanced sampling techniques. We identify the high degree of order and stochastic, long-lived temporal asymmetries in the membrane structure as the leading causes for the slow convergence of the free energy computations. We demonstrate that statistical errors due to insufficient sampling are substantial and propagate to membrane permeabilities. These errors are independent of the enhanced sampling technique employed and very likely independent of the precise membrane model.

Title: Electron microscopy and spectroscopy investigation of atomic, electronic, and phonon structures of NdNiO2/SrTiO3 interface
Authors: Yin Yuan, Wu Mei, Ding Xiang, He Peiyi, Li Qize, Zhang Xiaowen, Zhu Ruixue, Mao Ruilin, Gao Xiaoyue, Shi Ruochen, Qiao Liang, Gao Peng
Abstract: The infinite-layer nickelates, proposed as analogs to superconducting cuprates, provide a promising platform for exploring the mechanisms of unconventional superconductivity. However, the superconductivity under atmospheric pressure has only been observed in thin films, indicating the heterointerface is essential. Here, we employed the advanced Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy-Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (STEM-EELS) technique to thoroughly investigate the atomic configuration, layer-resolved electronic states and phonon across the NdNiO2/SrTiO3 interface. We found the Sr atoms diffusion at the interface, which results in hole doping into oxygen and nickel band to form a p-type interface. A pronounced redshift of the highest-energy optical phonon (HEOP) of NdNiO2 (~78 meV) is observed at the interface, which is primarily attributed to the epitaxial strain. Our work clarifies that the effects of the interface on electron and phonon states are mainly due to elemental intermixing and epitaxial strain, which could lay the foundation for future investigations into superconducting mechanisms of infinite-layer nickelates.

Title: Thermodynamic computing out of equilibrium
Authors: Stephen Whitelam, Corneel Casert
Abstract: We present the design for a thermodynamic computer that can perform arbitrary nonlinear calculations in or out of equilibrium. Simple thermodynamic circuits, fluctuating degrees of freedom in contact with a thermal bath and confined by a quartic potential, display an activity that is a nonlinear function of their input. Such circuits can therefore be regarded as thermodynamic neurons, and can serve as the building blocks of networked structures that act as thermodynamic neural networks, universal function approximators whose operation is powered by thermal fluctuations. We simulate a digital model of a thermodynamic neural network, and show that its parameters can be adjusted by genetic algorithm to perform nonlinear calculations at specified observation times, regardless of whether the system has attained thermal equilibrium. This work expands the field of thermodynamic computing beyond the regime of thermal equilibrium, enabling fully nonlinear computations, analogous to those performed by classical neural networks, at specified observation times.

Title: Density of electronic states in density-wave compounds with imperfect nesting
Authors: A. V. Tsvetkova, Ya. I. Rodionov, P. D. Grigoriev
Abstract: We study the effects of imperfect nesting in a simple 2D tight-binding model on the electronic properties in the density-wave (DW) state. The discussed model reflects the main features of quasi-1D metals, where the DW emerges. We show that an imperfect nesting leads to unusual singularities in the quasi-particle density of states, leading to a strong renormalization of the superconducting critical temperature. We also compute the conductivity tensor of the normal state and obtain a satisfactory agreement with the experimental data on rare-earth tritellurides and many other DW materials.

Title: Soft symmetries of topological orders
Authors: Ryohei Kobayashi, Maissam Barkeshli
Abstract: (2+1)D topological orders possess emergent symmetries given by a group $\text{Aut}(\mathcal{C})$, which consists of the braided tensor autoequivalences of the modular tensor category $\mathcal{C}$ that describes the anyons. In this paper we discuss cases where $\text{Aut}(\mathcal{C})$ has elements that neither permute anyons nor are associated to any symmetry fractionalization but are still non-trivial, which we refer to as soft symmetries. We point out that one can construct topological defects corresponding to such exotic symmetry actions by decorating with a certain class of gauged SPT states that cannot be distinguished by their torus partition function. This gives a physical interpretation to work by Davydov on soft braided tensor autoequivalences. This has a number of important implications for the classification of gapped boundaries, non-invertible spontaneous symmetry breaking, and the general classification of symmetry-enriched topological phases of matter. We also demonstrate analogous phenomena in higher dimensions, such as (3+1)D gauge theory with gauge group given by the quaternion group $Q_8$.

Title: Knit Happens: Designing the Mechanics of Machine Knitting
Authors: Cosima du Pasquier, Sehui Jeong, Pan Liu, Susan Williams, Allison M. Okamura, Skylar Tibbits, Tian Chen
Abstract: Knit fabrics are mechanically durable and tough while sufficiently flexible to conform to curved substrates such as the human body. Recent advancements in industrial knitting enable unprecedented control over the pattern design and functionality of next generation knit fabrics. However, the ability to leverage this granular control to predict and tune the mechanical behavior of these fabrics remains limited due to their complex hierarchical and entangled microstructure. This study establishes a comprehensive experimental and numerical framework to characterize and model the mechanical properties of industrial knitted fabrics. By integrating precise experiments, finite element modeling, and a strain energy-based homogenization approach, we provide an accurate demonstration of how stitch length, pattern, and yarn material govern the anisotropic mechanical response of knitted fabrics. In doing so, we establish clear quantitative links between these parameters and key material properties, including stiffness and anisotropy, that emerge directly from our energy-based model. Recognizing that industrial knitting systems can produce fabrics with spatially varying parameters, we extend our framework to predict heterogeneous knits. We show that material transitions have minimal impact on the fabric's overall mechanical response, so heterogeneous fabrics can be modeled with our framework as patchworks of homogeneous samples. We design the first industrially knit sleeve explicitly optimized for both fit and function, using heterogeneous patterns that conform to target arm musculature and ensure uniform stress distribution. This work bridges the gap between computational modeling and scalable manufacturing, unlocking new possibilities for wearable devices, assistive textiles, and functional applications.

Title: Atomic-scale metastable structure formation in nickel-aluminum alloys synthesized far from equilibrium

Abstract: This study reports a new meta-stable structure in epitaxial nickel-aluminum (Ni-Al) films (Al content up to 24.4 at.%) grown on MgO(001) substrates by magnetron sputtering. Structure probes by XRD, HRTEM and nano-indentation combined with atomistic simulations consistently demonstrate that in thin film samples with coexisting {\gamma} and {\gamma}' phases, domains of the two phases are homogeneously intermixed at the atomic-scale, forming a coherent matched lattice with one overall lattice parameter. It expands as aluminum (Al) concentration increases, with {\gamma} phase domains being progressively replaced by {\gamma}' phase domains. This behavior is similar to a solid solution, where the atomic-scale domain of the {\gamma} and {\gamma}' phases act as solute and solvent, respectively. Isothermal annealing and nanoindentation reveal that the structure decomposes into distinct {\gamma}' and {\gamma} phases due to the loss of lattice matching at 400 °C, resulting in an increase in hardness. This is followed by further relaxation and domain growth at higher temperatures (600 °C and 800 °C), accompanied by a decrease in hardness. These observations confirm the metastable nature of the nanoscale {\gamma} and {\gamma}' phases system, enhance the understanding of the Ni-Al alloy system and providing new insights for meta-stable intermetallic thin film synthesis.

Title: Spin-flip Scattering at a Chiral Interface of Helical Chains
Authors: Keita Matsubara, Kazumasa Hattori
Abstract: We investigate spin-flip scattering processes of electrons when they pass a chiral interface, which is the boundary between right- and left-handed one-dimensional chain. We construct a minimal $p$-orbital model consisting of the right- and left-handed one-dimensional threefold helical chains connected at $z=0$ with the nearest neighbor hopping and the spin-orbit coupling. The dynamics of spin-polarized wave packet passing through the interface, the Green's functions, and electronic states near the interface are analyzed numerically. We find that the microscopic structure of the interface is important and this strongly affects the local electronic orbital state. This in addition to the spin-orbit coupling determines whether the spin flip occurs or not at the chiral interface and suggests a possible spin transport control by the orbital configuration at the chiral interface.

Title: Effect of interface on magnetic exchange coupling in Co/Ru/Co trilayer: from ab-initio simulations to micromagnetics
Authors: Sergiu Arapan, Jan Priessnitz, Alexander Kovacs, Harald Oezelt, David Böhm, Markus Gusenbauer, Thomas Schrefl, Dominik Legut
Abstract: Interfaces play a substantial role for the functional properties of structured magnetic materials and magnetic multilayers. Modeling the functional behavior of magnetic materials requires the treatment of the relevant phenomena at the device level. Properties predicted from the electronic structure and spin dynamics at the atomistic level have to be properly transferred into a continuum level treatment. In this work we show how Co/Ru/Co three layers can be simulated with the continuum theory of micromagnetism, with interface coupling energies and bulk intrinsic properties properly derived from the results of \emph{ab initio} and spin dynamics simulations at different temperatures.

Title: Double-tough ceramics: Optimization-supported multiscale computational design
Authors: Jian Zhang, Francesco Aiello, Mauro Salazar, Diletta Giuntini
Abstract: To overcome the brittleness limitation of ceramics, various toughening mechanisms have been proposed. Some of the most remarkable, especially for oxides, include the tetragonal-to-monoclinic phase transformation leading to crack shielding in zirconia, and bioinspired brick-and-mortar microstructures fostering crack deflection. It has, however, proven challenging to incorporate both these mechanisms into a single all-ceramic material. In this work, we propose a computational methodology for the design of a material that combines these two toughening strategies, using a multiscale modeling approach that captures both their individual contributions and the overall fracture performance. This is achieved by developing an all-ceramic composite with a brick-and-mortar microstructure, in which the nanocrystalline mortar is transformation-toughened. Key factors influencing phase transformation, such as grain boundary properties, grain orientations, and kinetic coefficients, are analyzed, and the resulting transformation stress-strain behavior is incorporated into the microscale mortar constitutive model. We demonstrate that the synergistic effect of the two toughening mechanisms is achievable, and that it is an extremely effective strategy to boost fracture performance. The influence of brick size, mortar thickness, and properties of the constituent materials is then systematically investigated. Finally, a gradient-free optimization algorithm is employed to identify optimal geometric and material parameters, revealing that longer, thinner bricks with minimal mortar thickness provide the best fracture resistance. Optimal combinations of material properties are identified for given brick sizes and mortar thicknesses.

Title: Charge-density-wave quantum critical point under pressure in 2$H$-TaSe$_2$

Abstract: Suppressing of an ordered state that competes with superconductivity is one route to enhance superconducting transition temperatures. Whereas the effect of suppressing magnetic states is still not fully understood, materials featuring charge-density waves and superconductivity offer a clearer scenario as both states can be associated with electron-phonon coupling. Metallic transition-metal dichalcogenides are prime examples for such intertwined electron-phonon-driven phases, yet, various compounds do not show the expected interrelation or feature additional mechanisms which makes an unambiguous interpretation difficult. Here, we report high-pressure X-ray diffraction and inelastic X-ray scattering measurements of the prototypical transition-metal dichalcogenide 2$H$-TaSe$_2$ and determine the evolution of the charge-density-wave state and its lattice dynamics up to and beyond its suppression at the critical pressure $p_c = 19.9(1)\,\rm{GPa}$ and at low temperatures. The high quality of our data allows the full refinement of the commensurate charge-density-wave superstructure at low pressure and we find the quantum critical point of the charge-density-wave to be in close vicinity to the reported maximum superconducting transition temperature $T_{sc} = 8.2\,\rm{K}$. $Ab-initio$ calculations corroborate that 2$H$-TaSe$_2$ is a reference example of order-suppressed enhanced superconductivity and can serve as a textbook case to investigate superconductivity near a charge-density-wave quantum critical point.

Title: Rheology of concentrated suspension of fibers with load dependent friction coefficient
Authors: Monsurul Khan, Rishabh V. More, Arash Alizad Banaei, Luca Brandt, Arezoo M. Ardekani
Abstract: We numerically investigate the effects of fiber aspect ratio, roughness, flexibility, and flow inertia on the rheology of concentrated suspensions. We perform direct numerical simulations modeling the fibers, suspended in an incompressible Newtonian fluid, as continuous flexible slender bodies obeying the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation. An immersed Boundary Method (IBM) is employed to solve for the motion of fibers. In concentrated suspensions, fibers come into contact due to the presence of asperities on their surface. We assume a normal load-dependent friction coefficient to model contact dynamics and friction, which successfully recovers the shear-thinning behaviour observed in experiments. First, we report the shear rate dependent behavior and the increase in the suspension viscosity with the increasing volume fraction of fibers, fiber roughness, and rigidity. The increase in the viscosity is stronger at a lower shear rate and finite inertia. Simulation results indicate that for the concentrated suspensions, contact stresses between fibers form the dominant contribution to the viscosity. Moreover, we find the first normal stress difference to be positive and to increase with the Reynolds number for flexible fibers. Lastly, we explore the divergence of viscosity for different aspect ratios and roughness of the fibers and predict the jamming volume fraction by fitting the data to the Maron-Pierce law. The jamming volume fraction decreases with increasing the aspect ratio and roughness. We conclude that the contact forces and interparticle friction become one of the crucial factors governing the rheology of flexible fiber suspensions at high concentrations.

Title: Intrinsic Mixed-state Topological Order
Authors: Zijian Wang, Zhengzhi Wu, Zhong Wang
Abstract: Decoherence is a major obstacle to the preparation of topological order in noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Here, we show that decoherence can also give rise to new types of topological order. Specifically, we construct concrete examples by proliferating fermionic anyons in the toric code via local quantum channels. The resulting mixed states retain long-range entanglement, which manifests in the nonzero topological entanglement negativity, though the topological quantum memory is destroyed by decoherence. By comparison with the gapless spin liquid in pure states, we show that the identified states represent a novel intrinsic mixed-state topological order, which has no counterpart in pure states. Through the lens of quantum anomalies of 1-form symmetries, we then provide general constructions of intrinsic mixed-state topological order and reveal the existence of nonbosonic deconfined anyons as another key feature of these novel phases. The extended meaning and characterization of deconfined excitations and their statistics in mixed states are clarified. Moreover, when these deconfined anyons have nontrivial braiding statistics, we prove that the mixed states cannot be prepared via finite-depth local quantum channels from any bipartite separable states. We further demonstrate our construction using the decohered Kitaev honeycomb model and the decohered double-semion model. In the latter case, a surprising scenario arises where decoherence gives rise to additional types of deconfined anyons.

Title: Hamiltonian Forging of a Thermofield Double
Authors: Daniel Faílde, Juan Santos-Suárez, David A. Herrera-Martí, Javier Mas
Abstract: We address the variational preparation of the Thermofield Double as the ground state of a suitably engineered Hamiltonian acting on the doubled Hilbert space. Through the use of the Entanglement Forging ansatz, we propose a solution that involves only circuits of width $N$. We illustrate the method with generic fermionic Hamiltonians. The free fermion case can be solved in closed form, and yields a warm start state for the variational circuits whenever interactions are present. As an important side product, this method returns the complete energy spectrum and eigenbasis of the system.

Title: Towards Quantum Simulation of Non-Markovian Open Quantum Dynamics: A Universal and Compact Theory
Authors: Xiang Li, Su-Xiang Lyu, Yao Wang, Rui-Xue Xu, Xiao Zheng, YiJing Yan
Abstract: Non-Markovianity, the intricate dependence of an open quantum system on its temporal evolution history, holds tremendous implications across various scientific disciplines. However, accurately characterizing the complex non-Markovian effects has posed a formidable challenge for numerical simulations. While quantum computing technologies show promise, a universal theory enabling practical quantum algorithm implementation has been elusive. We address this gap by introducing the dissipaton-embedded quantum master equation in second quantization (DQME-SQ). This exact and compact theory offers two key advantages: representability by quantum circuits and universal applicability to any Gaussian environment. We demonstrate these capabilities through digital quantum simulations of non-Markovian dissipative dynamics in both bosonic and fermionic environments. The DQME-SQ framework opens a new horizon for the efficient exploration of complex open quantum systems by leveraging the rapidly advancing quantum computing technologies.

Title: Thermalization in Krylov Basis
Authors: Mohsen Alishahiha, Mohammad Javad Vasli
Abstract: We study thermalization in closed non-integrable quantum systems using the Krylov basis. We demonstrate that for thermalization to occur, the matrix representation of typical local operators in the Krylov basis should exhibit a specific tridiagonal form with all other elements in the matrix are exponentially small, reminiscent of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Within this framework, we propose that the nature of thermalization, whether weak or strong, can be examined by the infinite time average of the Krylov complexity. Moreover, we analyze the variance of Lanczos coefficients as another probe for the nature of thermalization. One observes that although the variance of Lanczos coefficients may capture certain features of thermalization, it is not as effective as the infinite time average of complexity.

Title: Quantum thermodynamics of nonequilibrium processes in lattice gauge theories
Authors: Zohreh Davoudi, Christopher Jarzynski, Niklas Mueller, Greeshma Oruganti, Connor Powers, Nicole Yunger Halpern
Abstract: A key objective in nuclear and high-energy physics is to describe nonequilibrium dynamics of matter, e.g., in the early universe and in particle colliders, starting from the Standard Model. Classical-computing methods, via the framework of lattice gauge theory, have experienced limited success in this mission. Quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories holds promise for overcoming computational limitations. Because of local constraints (Gauss's laws), lattice gauge theories have an intricate Hilbert-space structure. This structure complicates the definition of thermodynamic properties of systems coupled to reservoirs during equilibrium and nonequilibrium processes. We show how to define thermodynamic quantities such as work and heat using strong-coupling thermodynamics, a framework that has recently burgeoned within the field of quantum thermodynamics. Our definitions suit instantaneous quenches, simple nonequilibrium processes undertaken in quantum simulators. To illustrate our framework, we compute the work and heat exchanged during a quench in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory coupled to matter in 1+1 dimensions. The thermodynamic quantities, as functions of the quench parameter, evidence a phase transition. For general thermal states, we derive a simple relation between a quantum many-body system's entanglement Hamiltonian, measurable with quantum-information-processing tools, and the Hamiltonian of mean force, used to define strong-coupling thermodynamic quantities.

Title: Designing open quantum systems with known steady states: Davies generators and beyond
Authors: Jinkang Guo, Oliver Hart, Chi-Fang Chen, Aaron J. Friedman, Andrew Lucas
Abstract: We provide a systematic framework for constructing generic models of nonequilibrium quantum dynamics with a target stationary (mixed) state. Our framework identifies (almost) all combinations of Hamiltonian and dissipative dynamics that relax to a steady state of interest, generalizing the Davies' generator for dissipative relaxation at finite temperature to nonequilibrium dynamics targeting arbitrary stationary states. We focus on Gibbs states of stabilizer Hamiltonians, identifying local Lindbladians compatible therewith by constraining the rates of dissipative and unitary processes. Moreover, given terms in the Lindbladian not compatible with the target state, our formalism identifies the operations -- including syndrome measurements and local feedback -- one must apply to correct these errors. Our methods also reveal new models of quantum dynamics: for example, we provide a "measurement-induced phase transition" in which measurable two-point functions exhibit critical (power-law) scaling with distance at a critical ratio of the transverse field and rate of measurement and feedback. Time-reversal symmetry -- defined naturally within our formalism -- can be broken both in effectively classical and intrinsically quantum ways. Our framework provides a systematic starting point for exploring the landscape of dynamical universality classes in open quantum systems, as well as identifying new protocols for quantum error correction.

Title: Molecule Graph Networks with Many-body Equivariant Interactions
Authors: Zetian Mao, Chuan-Shen Hu, Jiawen Li, Chen Liang, Diptesh Das, Masato Sumita, Kelin Xia, Koji Tsuda
Abstract: Message passing neural networks have demonstrated significant efficacy in predicting molecular interactions. Introducing equivariant vectorial representations augments expressivity by capturing geometric data symmetries, thereby improving model accuracy. However, two-body bond vectors in opposition may cancel each other out during message passing, leading to the loss of directional information on their shared node. In this study, we develop Equivariant N-body Interaction Networks (ENINet) that explicitly integrates l = 1 equivariant many-body interactions to enhance directional symmetric information in the message passing scheme. We provided a mathematical analysis demonstrating the necessity of incorporating many-body equivariant interactions and generalized the formulation to $N$-body interactions. Experiments indicate that integrating many-body equivariant representations enhances prediction accuracy across diverse scalar and tensorial quantum chemical properties.

Title: Linear Criterion for an Upper Bound on the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer Critical Temperature
Authors: Barbara Roos
Abstract: Since Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory of superconductivity is non-linear, it is difficult to study superconducting properties analytically. There is a more tractable linear criterion which determines a temperature $T_l$ below which the system is superconducting. Here, we observe that there is a similar linear criterion which gives a temperature $T_u$ above which no superconductivity occurs. We provide examples of translation invariant systems where $T_u>T_l$ as well as systems where $T_u=T_l$. Furthermore, we estimate $T_u$ for half-spaces and show that it is exponentially small in the weak coupling limit, exhibiting the same asymptotics as the critical temperature for full space.

Title: Theory of metastable states in many-body quantum systems
Authors: Chao Yin, Federica M. Surace, Andrew Lucas
Abstract: We present a mathematical theory of metastable pure states in closed many-body quantum systems with finite-dimensional Hilbert space. Given a Hamiltonian, a pure state is defined to be metastable when all sufficiently local operators either stabilize the state, or raise its average energy. We prove that short-range entangled metastable states are necessarily eigenstates (scars) of a perturbatively close Hamiltonian. Given any metastable eigenstate of a Hamiltonian, in the presence of perturbations, we prove the presence of prethermal behavior: local correlation functions decay at a rate bounded by a time scale nonperturbatively long in the inverse metastability radius, rather than Fermi's Golden Rule. Inspired by this general theory, we prove that the lifetime of the false vacuum in certain $d$-dimensional quantum models grows at least as fast as $\exp(\epsilon^{-d} )$, where $\epsilon\rightarrow 0$ is the relative energy density of the false vacuum; this lower bound matches, for the first time, explicit calculations using quantum field theory. We identify metastable states at finite energy density in the PXP model, along with exponentially many metastable states in "helical" spin chains and the two-dimensional Ising model. Our inherently quantum formalism reveals precise connections between many problems, including prethermalization, robust quantum scars, and quantum nucleation theory, and applies to systems without known semiclassical and/or field theoretic limits.

Title: Hilbert space fragmentation at the origin of disorder-free localization in the lattice Schwinger model
Authors: Jared Jeyaretnam, Tanmay Bhore, Jesse J. Osborne, Jad C. Halimeh, Zlatko Papić
Abstract: Lattice gauge theories, discretized cousins of continuum gauge theories arising in the Standard Model, have become important platforms for exploring non-equilibrium quantum phenomena. Recent works have reported the possibility of disorder-free localization in the lattice Schwinger model. Using degenerate perturbation theory and numerical simulations based on exact diagonalization and matrix product states, we perform a detailed characterization of thermalization breakdown in the Schwinger model, including its spectral properties, structure of eigenstates, and out-of-equilibrium quench dynamics. We scrutinize the strong-coupling limit of the model, in which an intriguing double-logarithmic-in-time growth of entanglement was previously proposed from the initial vacuum state. We identify the origin of this ultraslow growth of entanglement as due to approximate Hilbert space fragmentation and the emergence of a dynamical constraint on particle hopping, which gives rise to sharp jumps in the entanglement entropy dynamics within individual background charge sectors. Based on the statistics of jump times, we argue that entanglement growth, averaged over charge sectors, is more naturally explained as either single-logarithmic or a weak power law in time. Our results suggest the existence of a single ergodicity-breaking regime due to Hilbert space fragmentation, whose properties are reminiscent of conventional many-body localization within numerically accessible system sizes.

Title: UV complete local field theory of persistent symmetry breaking in 2+1 dimensions
Authors: Bilal Hawashin, Junchen Rong, Michael M. Scherer
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking can persist at all temperatures in certain biconical $\mathrm{O}(N)\times \mathbb{Z}_2$ vector models when the underlying field theories are ultraviolet complete. So far, the existence of such theories has been established in fractional dimensions for local but nonunitary models or in 2+1 dimensions but for nonlocal models. Here, we study local models at zero and finite temperature directly in 2+1 dimensions employing functional methods. At zero temperature, we establish that our approach describes the quantum critical behaviour with high accuracy for all $N\geq 2$. We then exhibit the mechanism of discrete symmetry breaking from $\mathrm{O}(N)\times \mathbb{Z}_2\to \mathrm{O}(N)$ for increasing temperature near the biconical critical point when $N$ is finite but large. We calculate the corresponding finite-temperature phase diagram and further show that the Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner theorem is fully respected within this approach, i.e., symmetry breaking only occurs in the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ sector. Finally, we determine the critical $N$ above which this phenomenon can be observed to be $N_c \approx 15$.

Title: Kaleidoscopic reorganization of network communities across different scales
Authors: Wonhee Jeong, Daekyung Lee, Heetae Kim, Sang Hoon Lee
Abstract: The notion of structural heterogeneity is pervasive in real networks, and their community organization is no exception. Still, a vast majority of community detection methods assume neatly hierarchically organized communities of a characteristic scale for a given hierarchical level. In this work, we demonstrate that the reality of scale-dependent community reorganization is convoluted with simultaneous processes of community splitting and merging, challenging the conventional understanding of community-scale adjustment. We provide a mathematical argument concerning the modularity function, the results from real-network analysis, and a simple network model for a comprehensive understanding of the nontrivial community reorganization process. The reorganization is characterized by a local drop in the number of communities as the resolution parameter varies. This study suggests a need for a paradigm shift in the study of network communities, which emphasizes the importance of considering scale-dependent reorganization to better understand the genuine structural organization of networks.

Title: Two-dimensional Rashba semiconductors and inversion-asymmetric topological insulators in monolayer Janus MAA'ZxZ'(4-x) family
Authors: Jinghui Wei, Qikun Tian, XinTing Xu, Guangzhao Qin, Xu Zuo, Zhenzhen Qin
Abstract: The Rashba effect in Janus structures, accompanied by nontrivial topology, plays an important role in spintronics and even photovoltaic applications. Herein, through first-principles calculations, we systematically investigate the geometric stability and electronic structures of 135 kinds of Janus MAA'ZxZ'(4-x) family derived from two-dimensional MA2Z4 (M=Mg, Ga, Sr; A=Al, Ga; Z=S, Se, Te) monolayers, and design numerous Rashba semiconductors and inversion-asymmetric topological insulators. Specifically, there are a total of 26 Rashba semiconductors with isolated spin splitting bands contributed by Se/Te-pz orbitals at conduction band minimum, and their Rashba constant is closely related to the intrinsic electric field and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) strength. As the atomic number increases, the bandgap of Janus MAA'ZxZ'(4-x) continually decreases until it shrinks to a point where, when SOC is considered, band inversion occurs and it reopens with a nontrivial topology. In conjunction with band inversion, pz orbitals near the Fermi level can introduce double Rashba splitting featuring a distinctive hybrid spin texture, which can be further effectively adjusted through small biaxial strains and show a continuous evolution of topological to non-topological accompanied by different spin textures. This work provides new insights into Rashba and topology physics and further presents indispensable inversion asymmetry materials for the development of nonlinear optoelectronics.

Title: Entanglement transition in a cluster spin chain coupled with free spins
Authors: Kevissen Sellapillay, Laurent Raymond, Alberto D. Verga
Abstract: We investigate the entanglement of a ladder of spins formed by two sublattices, a ''cluster'' chain and the ''environment'', consisting of independent spins, both coupled by an exchange interaction and evolving under a unitary discrete time dynamics. The automaton is defined by the composition of the two body spin swap gate (between sublattices) and the three body cluster interaction. We observe that, depending on the set of coupling constants, the cluster subsystem evolves towards states corresponding to different entanglement phases. In the weak coupling regime the subsystem remains near the topological cluster state. Increasing the coupling strength leads to random states which transform from almost pure to fully mixed, according to the effective number of the environment active degrees of freedom.
