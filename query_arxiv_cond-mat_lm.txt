Title: Comment on "Instability of the ferromagnetic quantum critical point and symmetry of the ferromagnetic ground state in two-dimensional and three-dimensional electron gases with arbitrary spin-orbit splitting"
Authors: D. Belitz, T.R. Kirkpatrick
Abstract: Metallic quantum ferromagnets in the absence of quenched disorder are known to generically undergo a first-order quantum phase transition, avoiding the quantum critical point that had originally been expected. This is due to soft modes in the underlying Fermi liquid that lead to long-ranged correlations. These correlations in turn yield a nonanalytic dependence of the free energy on the magnetization even at a mean-field level that results in a fluctuation-induced first-order transition. Kirkpatrick and Belitz [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 124}, 147201 (2020)] have pointed out that one notable exception are non-centrosymmetric metals with a strong spin-orbit interaction. In such materials the spin-orbit interaction gives the relevant soft modes a mass, which inhibits the mechanism leading to a first-order transition. Miserev, Loss, and Klinovaja [Phys. Rev. B {\bf 106}, 134417 (2022)] have claimed that this conclusion does not hold if electron-electron interactions in the particle-particle channel, or 2$\kF$ scattering processes, are considered. They concluded that this interaction channel leads to soft modes that are not rendered massive by the spin-orbit interaction and again lead to a first-order quantum phase transition. In this Comment we show that this conclusion is not correct in three-dimensional magnets if the screening of the interaction is properly taken into account.

Title: Global Plane Waves From Local Gaussians: Periodic Charge Densities in a Blink
Authors: Jonas Elsborg, Felix Ærtebjerg, Luca Thiede, Alán Aspuru-Guzik, Tejs Vegge, Arghya Bhowmik
Abstract: We introduce ELECTRAFI, a fast, end-to-end differentiable model for predicting periodic charge densities in crystalline materials. ELECTRAFI constructs anisotropic Gaussians in real space and exploits their closed-form Fourier transforms to analytically evaluate plane-wave coefficients via the Poisson summation formula. This formulation delegates non-local and periodic behavior to analytic transforms, enabling reconstruction of the full periodic charge density with a single inverse FFT. By avoiding explicit real-space grid probing, periodic image summation, and spherical harmonic expansions, ELECTRAFI matches or exceeds state-of-the-art accuracy across periodic benchmarks while being up to $633 \times$ faster than the strongest competing method, reconstructing crystal charge densities in a fraction of a second. When used to initialize DFT calculations, ELECTRAFI reduces total DFT compute cost by up to ~20%, whereas slower charge density models negate savings due to high inference times. Our results show that accuracy and inference cost jointly determine end-to-end DFT speedups, and motivate our focus on efficiency.

Title: Detecting half-quantum superconducting vortices by spin-qubit relaxometry
Authors: Gábor B. Halász, Nirjhar Sarkar, Yueh-Chun Wu, Joshua T. Damron, Chengyun Hua, Benjamin Lawrie
Abstract: Half-quantum vortices in spin-triplet superconductors are predicted to harbor Majorana zero modes and may provide a viable avenue to topological quantum computation. Here, we introduce a novel approach for directly measuring the half-integer-quantized magnetic fluxes, $\Phi = h / (4e)$, carried by such half-quantum vortices via spin-qubit relaxometry. We consider a superconducting strip with a narrow pinch point at which vortices cross quasi-periodically below a spin qubit as a result of a bias current. We demonstrate that the relaxation rate of the spin qubit exhibits a pronounced peak if the vortex-crossing frequency matches the transition frequency of the spin qubit and conclude that the magnetic flux $\Phi$ of a single vortex can be obtained by dividing the corresponding voltage along the strip with the transition frequency. We discuss experimental constraints on implementing our proposed setup in spin-triplet candidate materials like UTe$_2$, UPt$_3$, and URhGe.

Title: Unifying Dirac Spin Liquids on Square and Shastry-Sutherland Lattices via Fermionic Deconfined Criticality
Authors: Andreas Feuerpfeil, Leyna Shackleton, Atanu Maity, Ronny Thomale, Subir Sachdev, Yasir Iqbal
Abstract: We present a fermionic gauge theory for deconfined quantum criticality on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice and reveal its shared low-energy field-theoretic structure with the square lattice. Starting from an SU(2) $\pi$-flux parent state, we construct a continuum theory of Dirac spinons coupled to an SU(2) gauge field and adjoint Higgs fields whose condensates drive transitions to a staggered-flux U(1) spin liquid and a gapless $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ Dirac spin liquid. While the Shastry-Sutherland lattice permits additional symmetry-allowed fermion bilinears compared to the square lattice, the quantum field theories are identical up to additional irrelevant terms. Consequently, the Higgs potential structure and the leading low-energy theory coincide with the square-lattice case at the quantum critical point. The SO(5) critical point is expected to realize conformal deconfined criticality: we analyze it in a large flavor expansion, calculate its critical exponents, and identify the Yukawa coupling between the fermions and Higgs fields as the relevant perturbation that destabilizes it, consistent with pseudocritical behavior observed in recent Monte Carlo studies. We show that the emergent SO(5) order parameter acquires a large anomalous dimension at the critical point, leading to strongly enhanced Néel and VBS susceptibilities-a hallmark of fermionic deconfined quantum criticality consistent with numerical studies. Our results place recent numerical evidence for a gapless $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ Dirac spin liquid on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice within a controlled field-theoretic framework and demonstrate that fermionic deconfined criticality on the square lattice-including critical exponents and stability-extends to frustrated lattices with reduced symmetry.

Title: Stability and Decay of Macrovortices in Rotating Bose Gases Beyond Mean Field
Authors: Paolo Molignini, M. A. Caracanhas, V. S. Bagnato, Barnali Chakrabarti
Abstract: We study the formation, stability, and decay of macrovortices in a rotating Bose gas confined by a Mexican-hat potential with a multiconfigurational ansatz. By systematically including correlations beyond the mean-field level, we map the equilibrium phase diagram and identify regimes of coexistence between vortex lattices and multiply charge central vortices. Quench dynamics reveals that macrovortices are robust under changes in rotation or interaction strength, sustaining clean monopole oscillations with well-separated, vorticity-dependent breathing frequencies. In contrast, trap quenches trigger a universal decay process mediated by vortex-phonon coupling, in which rotational energy is progressively transferred to compressible modes until the macrovortex splits into singly quantized vortices. Our results demonstrate that macrovortex lifetimes and decay pathways can be tuned by trap confinement, providing experimentally accessible signatures of vortex-phonon interactions and collective energy transfer in correlated quantum fluids.

Title: Scattering State Theory for One-dimensional Floquet Lattices
Authors: Ren Zhang, Xiao-Yu Ouyang, Xu-Dong Dai, Xi Dai
Abstract: We develop a Floquet transfer matrix method to solve scattering in extended 1D Floquet lattices, uncovering an underlying conjugate symplectic structure that enforces current conservation across sidebands. By engineering a spatial adiabatic boundary, we suppress multi-channel sideband interference, allowing us to establish a direct mapping between the bulk winding number $C$ and a rigid shift in the transmission energy windows--quantified as $C\hbar\omega$. We further propose two experimental realizations: cold-atom Bragg scattering to directly verify the transmission shift, and surface-acoustic-wave-induced transport demonstrating the quantized zero-bias current plateau.

Title: Deep Learning the Small-Angle Scattering of Polydisperse Hard Rods
Authors: Lijie Ding, Changwoo Do
Abstract: We present a deep learning framework for modeling and analyzing the small-angle scattering data of polydisperse hard-rod systems, a widely used models for anisotropic colloidal particles. We use a variational autoencoder-based neural network to learn the mapping from the system parameters such as the volume fraction, rod length, and polydispersity, to the scattering function. The dataset for training and testing such neural network model is obtained from Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation of 20,000 hard spherocylinders using the hard particle Monte Carlo package from the HOOMD-blue. Four datasets were generated, each with 5,500 pairs of system parameters and corresponding scattering functions. We use one of the dataset to investigate the feasibility of the learning, and three additional datasets with different polydisperse distribution to demonstrate the generality of our approach. The neural network model transcends the fundamental limitations of the Percus-Yevick approximation by accurately capturing anisotropic interactions and high-concentration effects that analytical models often fail to resolve. This framework achieves significantly higher accuracy in reproducing scattering functions and enables a least-square fitting routine for quantitative data analysis.

Title: Correlated dynamics of three-particle bound states induced by emergent impurities in Bose-Hubbard model
Authors: Wenduo Zhao, Boning Huang, Yongguan Ke, Chaohong Lee
Abstract: Bound states, known as particles tied together and moving as a whole, are profound correlated effects induced by particle-particle interactions. While dimer-monomer bound states are manifested as a single particle attached to dimer bound pair, it is still unclear about quantum walks and Bloch oscillations of dimer-monomer bound states. Here, we revisit three-particle bound states in the Bose-Hubbard model and find that interaction-induced impurities adjacent to bound pair and boundaries cause two kinds of bound states: one is dimer-monomer bound state and the other is bound edge states. In quantum walks, the spread velocity of dimer-monomer bound state is determined by the maximal group velocity of their energy band, which is much smaller than that in the single-particle case. In Bloch oscillations, the period of dimer-monomer bound states is one third of that in the single-particle case. Our works provide new insights to the collective dynamics of three-particle bound states.

Title: Superfluidity in the spin-1/2 XY model with power-law interactions
Authors: Muhammad Shaeer Moeed, Costanza Pennaforti, Adrian Del Maestro, Roger G. Melko
Abstract: In trapped-ion quantum simulators, effective spin-1/2 XY interactions can be engineered via laser-induced coupling between internal atomic states and collective phonon modes. In the simplest one-dimensional ($1d$) traps, these interactions decay as a power-law with distance $1/r^{\alpha}$, with a tunable exponent $\alpha$. For small $\alpha$, the resulting long-range $1d$ XY model exhibits continuous symmetry breaking, in marked contrast to its nearest neighbor counterpart. In this paper, we examine this model near the phase transition at $\alpha_c$ from the lens of the spin stiffness, or superfluid density. We develop a stochastic series expansion (SSE) quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulation and a generalized winding number estimator to measure the superfluid density in the presence of power-law interactions, which we test against exact diagonalization for small lattice sizes. Our results show how conventional superfluidity in the $1d$ XY model is enhanced in the long-range interacting regime. This is observed as a diverging superfluid density as $\alpha \rightarrow 0$ in the thermodynamic limit, which we show is consistent with linear spin-wave theory. Finally, we define a normalized superfluid density estimator that clearly distinguishes the short, medium, and long-range interacting regimes, providing a novel QMC probe of the critical value $\alpha_c$.

Title: Tuning the strength of emergent correlations in a Brownian gas via batch resetting
Authors: Gabriele de Mauro, Satya N. Majumdar, Gregory Schehr
Abstract: We study a gas of $N$ diffusing particles on the line subject to batch resetting: at rate $r$, a uniformly random subset of $m$ particles is reset to the origin. Despite the absence of interactions, the dynamics generates a nonequilibrium stationary state (NESS) with long-range correlations. We obtain exact results, both for the NESS and for the time dependence of the correlations, which are valid for arbitrary $m$ and $N$. By varying $m$, the system interpolates between an uncorrelated regime ($m=1$) and the fully synchronous resetting case ($m=N$). For all $1<m<N$, correlations exhibit a non-monotonic time dependence due to the emergence of an intrinsic decorrelation mechanism. In the stationary state, the correlation strength can be tuned by varying $m$, and it displays a transition at a critical value $N_c=6$. Our predictions extend straightforwardly to any spatial dimension $d$ and the critical value $N_c=6$ remains the same in all dimensions. Our predictions are testable in existing experimental setups on optically trapped colloidal particles.

Title: Quantum-geometry-enabled Landau-Zener tunneling in singular flat bands
Authors: Xuanyu Long, Feng Liu
Abstract: Flat-band materials have attracted substantial interest for their intriguing quantum geometric effects. Here we investigate how singular flat bands (SFBs) respond to a static, uniform electric field and whether they can support single-particle dc transport. By constructing a minimal two-band lattice model, we show that away from the singular band crossing point (BCP), the Wannier-Stark (WS) spectrum of the flat band is well captured by an intraband Berry phase $\Phi_{\mathrm{B}}$. The associated WS eigenstates are exponentially localized along the field direction, precluding dc transport. In contrast, near the BCP the interband Berry connection becomes prominent and drives Landau-Zener tunneling, which bends the flat-band WS ladder and delocalizes the SFB wavefunctions. Remarkably, this regime is governed solely by the maximal quantum distance $d$ through two geometric phases $(\theta,\varphi)$: $\theta$ characterizes the tunneling rate and $\varphi$ acts as a generalized Berry phase. These results highlight the essential role of quantum geometry in enabling nontrivial transport signatures in SFBs.

Title: First-Hitting Location Laws as Boundary Observables of Drift--Diffusion Processes
Authors: Yen-Chi Lee
Abstract: We investigate first-hitting location (FHL) statistics induced by drift--diffusion processes in domains with absorbing boundaries, and examine how such boundary laws give rise to intrinsic information observables. Rather than introducing explicit encoding or decoding mechanisms, information is viewed as emerging directly from the geometry and dynamics of stochastic transport through first-passage events. Treating the FHL as the primary observable, we characterize how geometry and drift jointly shape the induced boundary measure. In diffusion-dominated regimes, the exit law exhibits scale-free, heavy-tailed spatial fluctuations along the boundary, whereas a nonzero drift component introduces an intrinsic length scale that suppresses these tails and reorganizes the exit statistics. Within a generator-based formulation, the FHL arises naturally as a boundary measure induced by an elliptic operator, allowing explicit boundary kernels to be derived analytically in canonical geometries. Planar absorbing boundaries in different ambient dimensions are examined as benchmark cases, illustrating how directed transport regularizes diffusion-driven fluctuations and induces qualitative transitions in boundary statistics. Overall, the present work provides a unified structural framework for first-hitting location laws and highlights FHL statistics as natural probes of geometry, drift, and irreversibility in stochastic transport.

Title: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks Applied to Materials Property Prediction
Authors: Ryan Jacobs, Lane E. Schultz, Dane Morgan
Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) were proposed as an alternative to traditional neural network architectures based on multilayer perceptrons (MLP-NNs). The potential advantages of KANs over MLP-NNs, including significantly enhanced parameter efficiency and increased interpretability, make them a promising new regression model in supervised machine learning problems. We apply KANs to prediction of materials properties, focusing on a diverse set of 33 properties consisting of both experimental and calculated data. We compare the KAN results to random forest, a method that generally gives excellent performance on a wide range of properties predictions with very little optimization. The KANs were worse, on par, or better than random forest about 35%, 60%, and 5% of the time, respectively, and KANs are in practice more difficult to fit than random forest. By tuning the network architecture, we found property fits often resulted in 10-20% lower errors compared to the standard KAN, and typically gave results comparable to random forest. In the specific context of predicting reactor pressure vessel transition temperature shifts, we explored the parameter efficiency and the interpretable power of KANs by comparing predictions of simple KAN models (e.g., < 50 parameters) and closed-form expressions suggested by the KAN fits to previously published deep MLP-NNs and hand-tuned models created using domain expertise of embrittlement physics. We found that simple KAN models and the resulting closed-form expressions produce prediction errors on par with established hand-tuned models with a comparable number of parameters, and required essentially no domain expertise to produce. These findings reinforce the potential applicability of KANs for machine learning in materials science and suggest that KANs should be explored as a regression model for prediction of materials properties.

Title: Establishing Atomic Coherence in Twisted Oxide Membranes Containing Volatile Elements
Authors: Young-Hoon Kim, Reza Ghanbari, Min-Hyoung Jung, Young-Min Kim, Ruijuan Xu, Miaofang Chi
Abstract: Twisted oxide membranes represent a promising platform for exploring moire physics and emergent quantum phenomena. However, the presence of amorphous interfacial dead layers in conventional oxide heterostructures impedes coherent coupling and suppresses moire-induced interactions. While high-temperature thermal treatments can facilitate interfacial bonding, additional care is needed for materials containing volatile elements, where elevated temperatures may cause elemental loss. This study demonstrates the realization of atomically coherent, chemically bonded interface in twisted NaNbO3 heterostructures through controlled oxygen-annealing treatment. Atomic-resolution imaging and spectroscopy reveal ordered perovskite registry accompanied by systematic lattice contraction and modified electronic structure at the twisted interface, providing signatures of chemical reconstruction rather than physical adhesion. This reconstructed interface mediates highly asymmetric strain propagation in which the bottom membrane remains nearly relaxed while the top membrane accommodates substantial shear strain, thereby establishing a strain gradient that enables long-range electromechanical coupling throughout the twisted oxide membranes. By resolving the nature of the reconstructed interface, these findings establish a robust pathway for achieving coherent and strain-tunable oxide moire superlattices, opening pathways to engineer emergent ferroic and electronic functionalities.

Title: Revealing Strain Effects on the Graphene-Water Contact Angle Using a Machine Learning Potential
Authors: Darren Wayne Lim, Xavier R. Advincula, William C. Witt, Fabian L. Thiemann, Christoph Schran
Abstract: Understanding how water wets graphene is critical for predicting and controlling its behavior in nanofluidic, sensing, and energy applications. A key measure of wetting is the contact angle made by a liquid droplet against the surface, yet experimental measurements for graphene span a wide range, and no consensus has emerged for free-standing graphene. Here, we use a machine learning potential with approaching ab initio accuracy to perform nanosecond-scale molecular dynamics and provide an atomistic first-principles benchmark for this unsolved problem. We find the contact angle of water on free-standing graphene, after finite-size correction, to be $72.1 \pm 1.5 °$. We also show that the three-phase contact line of a nanoscale water droplet couples strongly to the intrinsic thermal ripples of free-standing graphene, and that graphene's wetting properties are highly sensitive to mechanical strain. Tensile strain makes graphene significantly more hydrophobic, while compressive strain induces coherent ripples that the droplet "surfs", resulting in pronounced anisotropic wetting and contact angle hysteresis. Our results demonstrate that graphene's wetting properties are governed not only by its chemistry but also by its dynamic morphology, offering an additional explanation for the variability of experimental measurements. Furthermore, mechanical strain may be a practical route to controlling wetting in graphene-based technologies, with promising consequences for nanofluidic and nano-filtration applications.

Title: Tunable Nanoparticle Stripe Patterns at Inclined Surfaces

Abstract: Periodic assemblies of nanoparticles are central to surface patterning, with applications in biosensing, energy conversion, and nanofabrication. Evaporation of colloidal droplets on substrates provides a simple yet effective route to achieve such assemblies. This work reports the first experimental demonstration of patterns formed through stick-slip dynamics of the three-phase contact line during evaporation of gold nanoparticle suspensions on inclined substrates. Variation in nanoparticle concentration and substrate inclination alter the balance of interfacial and gravitational forces, producing multiple stick-slip events that generate periodic stripes. Stripe density exhibits a sinusoidal dependence on inclination angle, while inter-stripe spacing remains nearly invariant. Independent control over inter-stripe spacing is achieved through adjustment of nanoparticle or surfactant concentration. These results highlight the complex interplay of gravitational and interfacial forces in directing periodic nanoparticle assembly and establish a versatile, programmable framework for surface patterning with tunable nano/microscale dimensions.

Title: Complex nonlinear sigma model
Authors: Kazuki Yamamoto, Kohei Kawabata
Abstract: Motivated by the recent interest in the criticality of open quantum many-body systems, we study nonlinear sigma models with complexified couplings as a general framework for nonunitary field theory. Applying the perturbative renormalization-group analysis to the tenfold symmetric spaces, we demonstrate that fixed points with complex scaling dimensions and critical exponents arise generically, without counterparts in conventional nonlinear sigma models with real couplings. We further clarify the global phase diagrams in the complex-coupling plane and identify both continuous and discontinuous phase transitions. Our work elucidates universal aspects of critical phenomena in complexified field theory.

Title: High-precision ground state parameters of the two-dimensional spin-1/2 Heisenberg model on the square lattice
Authors: Anders W. Sandvik
Abstract: Several ground state properties of the square-lattice $S=1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet are computed (the energy, order parameter, spin stiffness, spinwave velocity, long-wavelength susceptibility, and staggered susceptibility) using extensive quantum Monte Carlo simulations with the stochastic series expansion method. Moderately sized lattices are studied at temperatures $T$ sufficiently low to realize the $T \to 0$ limit. Results for periodic $L\times L$ lattices with $L \in [6,96]$ are tabulated versus $L$ and extrapolations to infinite system size are carried out. The extrapolated ground state energy density is $e_0=-0.669441857(7)$, which represents an improvement in precision of three orders of magnitude over the previously best result. The leading and subleading finite-size corrections to $e_0$ are in full quantitative agreement with predictions from chiral perturbation theory, thus further supporting the soundness of both the extrapolations and the theory. The extrapolated sublattice magnetization is $m_s=0.307447(2)$, which agrees well with previous estimates but with a much smaller statistical error. The coefficient of the linear in $L^{-1}$ correction to $m^2_s$ agrees with the value from chiral perturbation theory and the presence of a factor $\ln^\gamma(L)$ in the second-order correction is also confirmed, with the previously not known value of the exponent being $\gamma = 0.82(4)$. The finite-size corrections to the staggered susceptibility point to logarithmic corrections also in this quantity. To facilitate benchmarking of methods for which periodic boundary conditions are challenging, results for systems with open and cylindrical boundaries are also listed and their spatially inhomogeneous order parameters are analyzed.

Title: Steering Active-Colloid Assembly by Biasing Dissipation
Authors: Chaoqun Du, Zhiyu Cao, Zhonghuai Hou
Abstract: Complex nonequilibrium self-assembly enables the formation of materials with specific patterns and functions from the bottom up. How to directionally control the assembly to form the target configuration is a challenge. Here, we propose a dissipation bias principle for targeted assembly, which highlights that controlling the dissipation tendency can play an important role by modulating the frequency and intensity of local rearrangements. Following this principle, one can induce ordered target configurations from disordered structures and also achieve directional selection among multiple assembly pathways. We use the assembly of active colloids as a platform to show our results.

Title: Vibrational and Electronic Properties of Np2O5 from Experimental Spectroscopy and First Principles Calculations
Authors: Binod K Rai, Shuxiang Zhou, Benjamin R. Heiner, Gia Thinh Tran, Jennifer E. S. Szymanowski, Santosh KC, Thomas C. Shehee, Peter C. Burns, Miles F. Beaux II, Luke R Sadergaski
Abstract: High-valence actinide oxides are critical to understanding the behavior of 5f-electrons, yet their structural and electronic properties remain poorly understood due to challenges in synthesis and handling. We report the first Raman spectroscopic study of single-crystalline Np2O5 and the first scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) measurement on any neptunium-containing material. Hydrothermally synthesized crystals were structurally verified by X-ray diffraction. Raman spectra revealed sharply resolved vibrational features, including previously unreported low-frequency modes. STS measurements revealed a band gap of 1.5 eV. Density functional theory (DFT) enables vibrational mode assignments, reveals neptunium-dominated low-frequency phonons, oxygen-dominated high-frequency modes, and predicts an indirect band gap of 1.68 eV. This predicted value is in excellent agreement with the experimentally measured STS gap. This combined Raman, DFT, and STS approach provides a robust framework for correlating lattice dynamics and electronic structure in actinide materials, providing benchmark data for Np2O5, and opening new avenues for probing structure-property relationships in complex f-electron materials.

Title: Quantum capacitance and parity switching of a quantum-dot-based Kitaev chain
Authors: Chun-Xiao Liu
Abstract: An array of quantum dots coupled via superconductivity provides a new platform for creating Kitaev chains with Majorana zero modes, offering a promising avenue toward topological quantum computing. In this work, we theoretically study the quantum capacitance of a minimal Kitaev chain weakly coupled to an external normal lead. We find that in the open regime, charge stability diagrams of quantum capcaitance can help to identify the sweet spot of a Kitaev chain, consistent with tunnel spectroscopy. Moreover, the quantum capacitance of a single quantum dot coupled to Andreev bound states reveals the interplay between two distinct parity switching mechanisms: coupling to an external normal lead and intrinsic quasiparticle poisoning. Our work provides useful physical insights into the quantum capacitance and parity dynamics in a quantum-dot-based Kitaev chain device.

Title: ALD-Derived WO3-x Leads to Nearly Wake-Up-Free Ferroelectric Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 at Elevated Temperatures

Abstract: Breaking the memory wall in advanced computing architectures will require complex 3D integration of emerging memory materials such as ferroelectrics-either within the back-end-of-line (BEOL) of CMOS front-end processes or through advanced 3D packaging technologies. Achieving this integration demands that memory materials exhibit high thermal resilience, with the capability to operate reliably at elevated temperatures such as 125C, due to the substantial heat generated by front-end transistors. However, silicon-compatible HfO2-based ferroelectrics tend to exhibit antiferroelectric-like behavior in this temperature range, accompanied by a more pronounced wake-up effect, posing significant challenges to their thermal reliability. Here, we report that by introducing a thin tungsten oxide (WO3-x) layer-known as an oxygen reservoir-and carefully tuning its oxygen content, ultra-thin Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (5 nm) films can be made robust against the ferroelectric-to-antiferroelectric transition at elevated temperatures. This approach not only minimizes polarization loss in the pristine state but also effectively suppresses the wake-up effect, reducing the required wake-up cycles from 105 to only 10 at 125C- a qualifying temperature for back-end memory integrated with front-end logic, as defined by the JEDEC standard. First-principles density functional theory calculations reveal that WO3 enhances the stability of the ferroelectric orthorhombic phase at elevated temperatures by increasing the tetragonal-to-orthorhombic phase energy gap, and promoting favorable phonon mode evolution, thereby supporting o-phase formation under both thermodynamic and kinetic constraints.

Title: Microscopic Determination of the c-axis-Oriented Antiferromagnetic Structure in LaMnSi by $^{55}$Mn and $^{139}$La NMR
Authors: Yusuke Sakai, Fumiya Hori, Hiroki Matsumura, Shumpei Oguchi, Shunsaku Kitagawa, Kenji Ishida, Hiroshi Tanida
Abstract: We report a microscopic investigation of the magnetic structure and electronic properties of LaMnSi in its antiferromagnetic (AFM) state using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Field-swept $^{55}$Mn- and $^{139}$La-NMR spectra, as well as zero-field 55Mn-NMR (ZFNMR) spectra, reveal that the Mn ordered moments are parallel to the tetragonal c axis, consistent with the C-type AFM structure and the realization of an odd-parity multipole order. The internal field at the Mn site is determined to be 19.64 T at 4.2 K, corresponding to a hyperfine coupling constant of Ahf = 6.0 T/uB. Nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T1 exhibits a characteristic behavior of itinerant antiferromagnetism, showing metallic behavior at low temperatures and magnon-induced enhancement upon approaching the Neel temperature (TN = 295 K). These results show LaMnSi as an ideal compound to study 3d electron magnetism and odd-parity multipole order in the RT Si (R = rare-earth, T = transition metal) system, free of the complexities of 4f electrons.

Title: Low-temperature anomaly and anisotropy of critical magnetic fields in transition-metal dichalcogenide superconductors
Authors: Tomoya Sano, Kota Tabata, Akihiro Sasaki, Yasuhiro Asano
Abstract: We clarify why spin-singlet superconductivity persists in monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides even in high magnetic fields beyond the Pauli limit. The phenomenon called Ising protection is caused by two magnetically active potentials: a Zeeman field and an Ising spin-orbit interaction. These potentials induce two spin-triplet pairing correlations in a spin-singlet superconductor. One belonging to odd-frequency symmetry class arises solely from a Zeeman field and always makes the superconducting state unstable. The other belonging to even-frequency symmetry class arise from the interaction between the two magnetic potentials and eliminate the instability caused by odd-frequency pairs. The presence or absence of even-frequency spin-triplet pairs explains the anisotropy of the Ising protection. The analytical expression of the superfluid weight enables us to conclude that even-frequency spin-triplet Cooper pairs support spin-singlet superconductivity in high Zeeman fields.

Title: Tuning field amplitude to minimise heat-loss variability in magnetic hyperthermia
Authors: Necda Çam, Iago López-Vázquez, Òscar Iglesias, David Serantes
Abstract: In this work, we theoretically investigate how shape-induced anisotropy dispersion and magnetic field amplitude jointly control both the magnitude and heterogeneity of heating in magnetite nanoparticle assemblies under AC magnetic fields. Using real time Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert simulations with thermal fluctuations, and a macrospin model that includes both the intrinsic cubic magnetocrystalline anisotropy and a shape-induced uniaxial contribution, we analyze shape-polydisperse systems under clinically and technologically relevant field conditions. We show that for relatively large particles, around 25 to 30 nm, the relative dispersion of local (single-particle) losses exhibits a well-defined minimum at moderate field amplitudes (between 4 to 12 mT), hence identifying an optimal operating regime that minimizes heating heterogeneity while maintaining substantial power dissipation. The position of this critical field depends mainly on particle size and excitation frequency, and only weakly on shape dispersion, offering practical guidelines for improving heating uniformity in realistic MFH systems.

Title: Ground-State Phase Diagram of (1/2,1/2,1) Mixed Diamond Chains with Single-Site Anisotropy
Authors: Kazuo Hida
Abstract: The ground-state phases of mixed diamond chains with ($S, \tau^{(1)}, \tau^{(2)})=(1/2,1/2,1)$, where $S$ is the magnitude of vertex spins, and $\tau^{(1)}$ and $\tau^{(2)}$ are those of apical spins, are investigated with the single-site anisotropy $D$ on the $\tau^{(2)}$-site. The two apical spins in each unit cell are coupled by an exchange coupling $\lambda$. The vertex spins are coupled with the top and bottom apical spins by exchange couplings $1+\delta$ and $1-\delta$, respectively. The ground-state phase diagram is determined using the numerical exact diagonalization and DMRG method in addition to the analytical approximations in various limiting cases. The phase diagram consists of a Néel ordered phase, a nonmagnetic Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid phase, quantized and partial ferrimagnetic phases. A region with anisotropy inversion is found where the Ising-like Néel phase is realized for the easy-plane anisotropy $D >0$ and the XY-like Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid phase is realized for the easy-axis anisotropy $D <0$ on the $S=1$ sites.

Title: Coupled-wire descriptions of unconventional quantum states in twisted nanostructures
Authors: Chen-Hsuan Hsu, Anna Ohorodnyk
Abstract: Coupled-wire description has been developed as a powerful framework for providing bosonic descriptions of strongly correlated quantum matter, with early applications to systems such as the cuprates and the integer and fractional quantum Hall states. In this topical review, we discuss recent developments of coupled-wire description in nanoscale systems, where it emerges not only as a theoretical tool but also as a highly tunable physical platform. In these nanoscale realizations, coupled-wire networks are formed by one-dimensional channels embedded in two-dimensional materials, most prominently in moiré and twisted structures. Such networks host a broad range of unconventional states of matter, including superconductivity, charge density waves, spin density waves, Mott insulating phases, Anderson insulating phases, quantum spin Hall states, quantum anomalous Hall states, and their fractionalized counterparts. The ability to electrically control interaction strength, confinement, and coupling between wires makes these systems qualitatively different from earlier realizations and allows continuous tuning between competing phases. Notably, recent work has demonstrated that the coupled-wire framework in moiré networks completes the trio of quantum Hall phenomena, encompassing quantum Hall, quantum spin Hall, and quantum anomalous Hall states, together with their fractional analogues. This development highlights coupled-wire networks in nanoscale materials as a versatile and experimentally relevant setting for exploring the interplay of topology, strong correlations, and low-dimensional physics.

Title: Transit-time oscillations in nanoscale vacuum diode with a pure resistive load
Authors: Bjartþhór Steinn Alexandersson, Kristinn Torfason, Andrei Manolescu, Ágúst Valfells
Abstract: We examine the Ramo current in a nanoscale planar vacuum diode undergoing field emission in the presence of a DC voltage supply and an external resistor. We describe a simple mechanism for generating persistent current oscillations in the diode due to the voltage drop across the external resistor (beam loading) which reduces the total field and inhibits the emission. The amplitude and the frequency, which is in the THz domain, depend on the operating parameters of the diode. Molecular dynamics simulations are used to find the characteristics and physical basis of the mechanism, and a simple analytical model is presented, in good agreement with the simulation.

Title: Complex segregation patterns in confined nonuniform granular shearing flows
Authors: Santiago Caro (MAST-GPEM), Riccardo Artoni (IFSTTAR/MAST/GPEM), Patrick Richard (GMCM), Michele Larcher, James T. Jenkins (CU)
Abstract: When polydisperse granular systems are sheared, the transverse dynamics is characterized by the interplay of size segregation and diffusion. Segregation in nonuniform and confined shearing flows is studied using annular shear cell experiments complemented with discrete numerical simulations of bidisperse, inelastic, and frictional spheres under gravity. We explored the role of shear localization, granular temperature, boundaries, and mixture properties in the evolution of the segregation rate and the maximum degree of segregation achieved by a bidisperse granular system in the steady state. A faster segregation process and a more developed degree of segregation is observed for bidisperse mixtures with a larger size ratio and a higher proportion of large particles. Normally, in the presence of gravity, size segregation induces large particles to rise and small particles to sink. However, two additional complex segregation patterns were found: inverse segregation and horizontal segregation. The first might be related to the kinematics of the flow, while the second is a geometrical effect. This additional segregation mechanism, in addition to diffusion fluxes and high confining pressure, hampers complete segregation in the steady state, where some degree of mixing always persists.

Title: Mechanical sensing of metamagnetic tricriticality in two-dimensional CrI3
Authors: Feng Liu, Jiayong Xiao, Shengwei Jiang, Kin Fai Mak, Jie Shan
Abstract: Layered Ising metamagnets are antiferromagnetic (AF) materials consisting of monolayer Ising ferromagnets coupled to each other via interlayer AF interactions. They exhibit rich magnetic phase diagrams, featuring tricritical and critical end points, due to the competing magnetic interactions and the Ising anisotropy. While conventional thermodynamic probes can identify these critical points in bulk Ising metamagnets, achieving this in the two-dimensional (2D) limit, where enhanced fluctuation effects can substantially modify critical phenomena, remains to be realized. Here, we combine specific heat capacity (C_V) and magnetic circular dichroism measurements to identify these critical points, extract a tricritical exponent, and map out the complete magnetic phase diagram of 2D Ising metamagnetic CrI3. This is achieved in a nanomechanical device of 6-layer CrI3, in which a direct measurement of the temperature derivative of its mechanical resonance frequency gives C_V. The tricritical point is identified by the onset of an abrupt spin-flip transition on one side and, on the other side, by a vanishing specific heat {\lambda}-anomaly for a continuous AF phase transition. In contrast, only the spin-flip transition remains near the critical end point. Our results establish nanomechanical calorimetry as a general route to classify metamagnetic phase transitions and to study multicritical phenomena in 2D magnets.

Title: Giant anomalous Josephson effect as a probe of spin texture in topological insulators
Authors: Niklas Hüttner, Andreas Costa, Leandro Tosi, Michael Barth, Wolfgang Himmler, Dmitriy A. Kozlov, Leonid Golub, Nikolay N. Mikhailov, Klaus Richter, Dieter Weiss, Christoph Strunk, Nicola Paradiso
Abstract: Surface states of topological insulators feature chiral spin-momentum locking. When such states are used as weak link between two superconductors, their spin texture gives rise to the anomalous Josephson effect, i.e., to a $\varphi_0$ shift in the current phase relation. In this work, we explore the anomalous Josephson effect in junctions where the weak link is a HgTe nanowire. We observe a giant anomalous $\varphi_0$-shift of the current-phase relation, which we attribute to the fact that HgTe surface states feature a single Fermi contour. Moreover, by varying the orientation of the in-plane magnetic field, we obtain information about the spin texture in momentum space. In particular, we found that the spin is not exactly perpendicular to the momentum, but shows a significant deviation of 19 degrees. Our results establish the anomalous Josephson effect as a sensitive tool to probe the spin texture of chiral 2D systems.

Title: Contrasting impurity-induced magnetism and dynamics in 2H-MoTe2

Abstract: We investigate the behavior of interstitial $^8$Li$^+$ implanted near the surface of 2H-MoTe$_2$ using $\beta$-detected NMR. We find that, unlike the muon, $^8$Li$^+$ does not show any signature of induced magnetism. This result is consistent with density functional theory, which identifies the Li stopping site at the 2a Wyckoff position in the van der Waals gap and confirms the absence of detectable Li-induced electronic spin polarization. Both the spin-lattice relaxation and the resonance lines show evidence of strong spin dynamics above $\sim 200$ K, reminiscent of local stochastic $^8$Li$^+$ motion within a cage. The resonance line shape consists of quadrupolar satellites on top of a broad central peak. To better understand the interaction of $^8$Li$^+$ with the host material, we employ a frequency-comb measurement, by simultaneously exciting four frequencies corresponding to the first-order quadrupolar satellite transitions, $\nu_0 \pm 3\nu_{\mathrm{comb}}$ and $\nu_0 \pm\nu_{\mathrm{comb}}$ around the Larmor frequency $\nu_0$ as a function of $\nu_{\mathrm{comb}}$. This offers an enhanced sensitivity to the quadrupolar split portion of the line. Using this method, we find a small decrease of the quadrupolar frequency with increasing temperature, showing the typical behavior associated with thermally excited phonons and the absence of any magnetic response which was observed with other defects in 2H-MoTe$_2$.

Title: Topological-transition-driven Giant Enhancement of Second-harmonic Generation in Ferroelectric Bismuth Monolayer
Authors: Wen-Zheng Chen, Hongjun Xiang, Yusheng Hou
Abstract: The interplay between band topology and light in condensed materials could unlock intriguing nonlinear optical phenomena, enabling modern photonic technologies such as quantum light sources and sub-wavelength topological lasers. Here, we unveil that a buckling-tuned topological transition in ferroelectric bismuth monolayer unleashes a giant second-harmonic generation. Using first-principles calculations, we surprisingly find that ferroelectric bismuth monolayer with a buckling parameter, $\Delta h$, has a large susceptibility $\chi^{(2)}$ on the order of $10^{7}$ $\mathrm{pm}^2/\mathrm{V}$, exceeding monolayer MoS$_2$ by about two orders of magnitude. When $\Delta h$ is engineered to the critical window where Dirac electrons emerge, a low-frequency resonance appears, boosting $\chi^{(2)}$ by an additional order of magnitude. We show that this enhancement is localized on the Dirac cones and dominated by intraband modification contributions. Based on an extended Dirac model, we establish that this enhancement physically originates from the ultralight effective masses $m^{*}$ of Dirac electrons through scaling with the Fermi velocity $v_F$ and band gap $E_g$. Our findings provide a general paradigm for achieving exceptional second-harmonic generation via engineering topological criticality, and could serve as an experimental signature of Dirac electrons in topological materials.

Title: Critical Charge and Current Fluctuations across a Voltage-Driven Phase Transition
Authors: José F. B. Afonso, Stefan Kirchner, Pedro Ribeiro
Abstract: We investigate bias-driven non-equilibrium quantum phase transitions in a paradigmatic quantum-transport setup: an interacting quantum dot coupled to non-interacting metallic leads. Using the Random Phase Approximation, which is exact in the limit of a large number of dot levels, we map out the zero-temperature non-equilibrium phase diagram as a function of interaction strength and applied bias. We focus our analysis on the behavior of the charge susceptibility and the current noise in the vicinity of the transition. Remarkably, despite the intrinsically non-equilibrium nature of the steady state, critical charge fluctuations admit an effective-temperature description, $T_{\text{eff}}(T,V)$, that collapses the steady-state behavior onto its equilibrium form. In sharp contrast, current fluctuations exhibit genuinely non-equilibrium features: the fluctuation-dissipation ratio becomes negative in the ordered phase, corresponding to a negative effective temperature for the current degrees of freedom. These results establish current noise as a sensitive probe of critical fluctuations at non-equilibrium quantum phase transitions and open new directions for exploring voltage-driven critical phenomena in quantum transport systems.

Title: Spin-orbit coupling and beyond in Chiral-Induced Spin Selectivity
Authors: Ruggero Sala, Sushant Kumar Behera, Abhirup Roy Karmakar, Matteo Moioli, Rocco Martinazzo, Matteo Cococcioni
Abstract: Chiral-Induced Spin Selectivity (CISS) describes the emergence of spin-polarized electron transport in chiral systems without magnetic fields, a remarkable effect in light-element materials with weak intrinsic spin-orbit coupling (SOC). This mini-review analyzes the microscopic origins of CISS, highlighting how molecular chirality, local electric fields, and dynamic distortions enhance effective SOC and drive spin-dependent transport. We critically assess existing models in terms of their symmetry constraints, phenomenological assumptions, and compliance with Onsager reciprocity. Recent developments combining relativistic quantum mechanics and complete multipole representations reveal a direct link between chirality density and spin current pseudoscalars, suggesting a field-theoretic foundation for CISS. These insights could help position light-element chiral nanomaterials as tunable platforms for probing and engineering spin-selective phenomena at the nanoscale.

Title: Nonequilibrium noise emerging from broken detailed balance in active gels
Authors: Ashot Matevosyan, Frank Jülicher, Ricard Alert
Abstract: In thermodynamic equilibrium, the fluctuation-dissipation theorem links thermal fluctuations and dissipation. Biological systems, however, are driven out of equilibrium by internal processes that produce additional, active fluctuations. Despite being relevant for biological functions such as intracellular transport, predicting the statistical properties of active fluctuations remains challenging. Here, we address this challenge in a minimal model of an active gel as a network of elastic elements connected by transient crosslinks. The crosslinkers' binding and unbinding rates break detailed balance, which drives the system out of equilibrium. Through coarse-graining, we derive fluctuating hydrodynamic equations including an active noise term, which emerges explicitly from the breaking of detailed balance. Finally, we provide predictions for the stochastic motion of a tracer particle embedded in the active gel, which enables comparisons with microrheology experiments both in synthetic active gels and in cells. Overall, our work provides an explicit link between the statistical properties of active fluctuations and the molecular breaking of detailed balance. Thus, it paves the way toward complementing the fluctuation-dissipation theorem with a fluctuation-activity relation in active systems.

Title: Microscopic structure of the vortex cores in granular niobium: A coherent quantum puzzle

Abstract: When macroscopic quantum condensates -- superconductors, superfluids, cold atoms and ions, polaritons etc. -- are put in rotation, a quantum vortex lattice forms inside. In homogeneous type-II superconductors, each vortex has a tiny core where the superconducting gap $\Delta(r)$ is known to smoothly vanish towards the core centre on the scale of the coherence length $\xi$. The cores host quantized quasiparticle energy levels known as Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon (CdGM) bound states [Caroli {\it et al.,} Phys. Lett. v. 9, 307 (1964)]. In pure materials, the spectrum of the low-lying CdGM states has the characteristic level spacing $\sim \Delta_0^2/E_F$, where $E_F$ is the Fermi energy and $\Delta_0$ is the bulk gap. In disordered ones, the CdGM states shift and broaden due to scattering. Here, we show, both experimentally and theoretically, that the situation is completely different in granular Nb films, which are commonly used in superconducting electronics. In these films, in which the grains are smaller than $\xi$, the gap $\Delta$ in the quasiparticle spectrum reduces towards the vortex core centres by discrete jumps at the grain boundaries. The bound states adapt to the local environment and appear at unexpectedly high energies. Both $\Delta(r)$ and bound states form a puzzle-like spatial structure of the core, elements of which are whole grains. Our discovery shakes up the established understanding of the quantum vortex and encourages a reconsideration of the vortex motion and pinning mechanisms in granular superconductors.

Title: Epitaxial Ni/Cu Superlattice Nanowires with Atomically Sharp Interfaces for Spin Transport
Authors: Janez Zavašnik, Sama Derakshan-Nejad, Maryam Ghaffari, Amir Hassan Montazer, Mohammad Reza Mardaneh, Mohammad Almasi Kashi, Alexandre Nomine, Stephane Mangin, Uroš Cvelbar
Abstract: The importance of microstructure increases when decreasing the size of an object to the nanoscale, along with the complexity of controlling it. For instance, it is particularly complicated to create nano-object with controlled interfaces. Therefore, progressing towards 1D epitaxial nanostructures poses a challenge, and realization of their full potential is linked to technological issues of achieving large-scale, precise atom stacking of two or more different chemical elements. Achieving such coherent, epitaxial interfaces is a key step toward enabling spintronic phenomena in 1D objects, by minimizing interface scattering and strain-driven defects. Our results demonstrate a successful realization of controlled nanoscale heteroepitaxy in one-dimensional single-crystal structures. We fabricated nanowires composed of alternating magnetic (nickel) and non-magnetic, highly conductive (copper) segments. This periodic stacking modulates electron transport under magnetic stimuli. The epitaxial precision achieved eliminates detrimental electron scattering that has historically limited the magnetotransport properties of such 1D structures and hindered their development. Such materials are crucial for further advancements in the miniaturisation of nanosensors, actuators, and next-generation 3D spintronic devices.

Title: Silicon Driven Facet Regulation Enables Tunable Micro-Diamond Architectures in Liquid Ga In
Authors: Zhi Jiang, Xueying Zhang, António José Silva Fernandes, Marco Peres, Gil Gonçalves
Abstract: We report an ambient pressure liquid metal assisted CVD strategy that enables shape programmable growth of micro scale diamond by coupling liquid metl Ga In with ferrocene (Fe(C5H5)2) as an carbon precursor, nanodiamond seeds, and nanosilicon. Building on liquid metal diamond synthesis, this approach pushes liquid metal growth toward a low temperature (900 °C, 1 atm) while enabling single crystal diamonds to be scaled from ~10 {\mu}m to several tens of micrometers with well developed faceting. Ferrocene decomposition supplies a sustained interfacial carbon flux that is captured and redistributed by the Ga In melt toward seed rich liquid solid interfaces. Defect rich nanodiamond provides the crystallographic template required for reliable sp3 nucleation despite the intrinsically low carbon solubility of Ga In. Nanosilicon plays a distinct, complementary role by tuning interfacial kinetics and facet competition, enabling deliberate control of crystal habit: cubic (~10 {\mu}m), truncated tetrahedral, and fully faceted octahedral diamonds are reproducibly obtained by adjusting the nanosilicon:nanodiamond ratio, with octahedral crystals reaching ~50 {\mu}m. Importantly, crystal size is further scaled by regulating hydrogen flow: lowering the H2 rate increases net carbon retention at the liquid metal interface, raises effective supersaturation, and accelerates diamond deposition. Together, habit control (via nanosilicon: nanodiamond) and size scaling (via H2 flow) establish a practical route silicon driven facet regulation and size under ambient pressure, offering a pathway to tunable micro sized single crystal diamonds under mild conditions.

Title: Three-body scattering area of identical bosons in two dimensions
Authors: Junjie Liang, Hongye Yu, Shina Tan
Abstract: We study the wave function $\phi^{(3)}$ of three identical bosons scattering at zero energy, zero total momentum, and zero orbital angular momentum in two dimensions, interacting via short-range potentials with a finite two-body scattering length $a$. We derive asymptotic expansions of $\phi^{(3)}$ in two regimes: the 111-expansion, where all three pairwise distances are large, and the 21-expansion, where one particle is far from the other two. In the 111-expansion, the leading term grows as $\ln^3(B/a)$ at large hyperradius $B=\sqrt{(s_1^2+s_2^2+s_3^2)/2}$. At order $B^{-2}\ln^{-3}(B/a)$, we identify a three-body parameter $D$ with dimension of length squared, which we term the three-body scattering area. This quantity should be contrasted with the three-body scattering area previously studied for infinite or vanishing two-body scattering length. If the two-body interaction is attractive and supports bound states, $D$ acquires a negative imaginary part, and we derive its relation to the probability amplitudes for the production of two-body bound states in three-body collisions. Under weak modifications of the interaction potentials, we derive the corresponding shift of $D$ in terms of $\phi^{(3)}$ and the changes of the two-body and three-body potentials. We also study the effects of $D$ and $\phi^{(3)}$ on three-body and many-body physics, including the three-body ground-state energy in a large periodic volume, the many-body energy and the three-body correlation function of the dilute two-dimensional Bose gas, and the three-body recombination rates of two-dimensional ultracold atomic Bose gases.

Title: Magnetic states of the Kondo lattice Ce$_2$PdSi$_3$ and their pressure evolution

Abstract: Frustrated Kondo lattices are ideal platforms for exploring unconventional forms of quantum criticality, as well as magnetism and other emergent phases. Here we report the magnetic properties of the candidate frustrated heavy fermion compound Ce$_2$PdSi$_3$, and map their evolution upon applying magnetic fields and hydrostatic pressure. We find that at ambient pressure Ce$_2$PdSi$_3$ exhibits two distinct magnetic phase transitions, a ferromagnetic-like transition at $T_{\mathrm{M1}}=3.8$ K and an incommensurate antiferromagnetic transition at $T_{\mathrm{M2}}=2.9$ K. Upon applying pressure, $T_{\mathrm{M1}}$ is continuously suppressed and becomes undetectable above 4.2 GPa, whereas $T_{\mathrm{M2}}$ increases and remains robust up to at least 7.5 GPa. The observed pressure evolution of magnetic order in Ce$_2$PdSi$_3$ suggests the presence of competing magnetic orders, and cannot be simply encapsulated by the Doniach phase diagram, motivating further investigations for its origin, including discerning the role of geometric frustration.

Title: Superconducting density of states of nitridized Aluminum thin films
Authors: Jose Antonio Moreno, Pablo García Talavera, Alba Torras-Coloma, Gemma Rius, P. Forn-Díaz, Edwin Herrera Vasco, Isabel Guillamón, Hermann Suderow
Abstract: Nitride-based superconductors represent a family of superconducting thin film materials displaying higher quality than their corresponding bare superconductor when used in devices for applications such as cosmic radiation sensing. In recent times, Niobium-based and Titanium-based nitrides were used to improve the quality of superconducting devices in quantum technology applications. Recently, nitridized Aluminum (NitrAl) has been found to display higher critical temperatures and enhanced resilience to magnetic fields compared to those of Al, making it a new interesting candidate for superconducting quantum circuit applications. However, the microscopic properties of NitrAl remain highly unexplored. Here we use Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM) to measure the superconducting density of states of a thin film sample of nitridized-Aluminum (NitrAl), with a room temperature resistivity between pure Al and fully insulating aluminum nitride. We show that the in-gap density of states is zero up to about $\hbar\omega=250~\mathrm{\mu eV}$ and that there is a distribution of values of the superconducting gap around $\Delta_0=360~\mathrm{\mu eV}$, close to the BCS expectation $\Delta=1.76 k_{\mathrm{B}}T_{\mathrm{c}}$. We also find varying superconducting gap values at the nanometer scale, by approximately 10\%, when probing different regions of the sample. These results suggest a gap which is larger than the one of pure Al, and is spatially more homogeneous than the superconducting gap values often found in thin films. Our work demonstrates that STM is as a powerful tool to screen materials for quantum devices through the measurement of the spatial dependence of the superconducting density of states.

Title: A Unified Symmetry Classification of Many-Body Localized Phases
Authors: Yucheng Wang
Abstract: Anderson localization admits a complete symmetry classification given by the Altland-Zirnbauer (AZ) tenfold scheme, whereas an analogous framework for interacting many-body localization (MBL) has remained elusive. Here we develop a symmetry-based classification of static MBL phases formulated at the level of local integrals of motion (LIOMs). We show that a symmetry is compatible with stable MBL if and only if its action can be consistently represented within a quasi-local LIOM algebra, without enforcing extensive degeneracies or nonlocal operator mixing. This criterion sharply distinguishes symmetry classes: onsite Abelian symmetries are compatible with stable MBL and can host distinct symmetry-protected topological MBL phases, whereas continuous non-Abelian symmetries generically preclude stable MBL. By systematically combining AZ symmetries with additional onsite symmetries, we construct a complete classification table of MBL phases, identify stable, fragile, and unstable classes, and provide representative lattice realizations. Our results establish a unified and physically transparent framework for understanding symmetry constraints on MBL.

Title: Topological Polar Textures in Freestanding Ultrathin Ferroelectric Oxides
Authors: Franco N. Di Rino, Tim Verhagen
Abstract: The remarkable advances achieved in two-dimensional materials are now being directly transposed to low-dimensional oxides. Here we show using first-principles-based atomistic simulations that ultrathin freestanding ferroelectric layers host a rich variety of polar states, from liquid-like ferroelectric domains with long-range orientational order to helix-wave and chiral bubbles configurations reminiscent of those observed in twisted freestanding oxide layers. Time-dependent electric fields enable reversible control, revealing freestanding oxide layers as ideal platforms to explore complex polar states and their potential applications in future ferroic devices.

Title: Ion-Modulated Polyelectrolyte Complexation of DNA and Polyacrylic Acid from Molecular Dynamics Simulations
Authors: Sisem Ektirici, Vagelis Harmandaris, Christos N. Likos, Terpsichori S. Alexiou
Abstract: The formation of complexes between like-charged polyelectrolytes challenges conventional electrostatic intuition and highlights the central role of ions in mediating macromolecular organization. Here, we investigate the salt-dependent association of DNA with poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations in NaCl, MgCl$_2$, and CaCl$_2$ solutions. A time-resolved state classification scheme, based on heavy-atom distance and hydrogen-bond formation, was applied to distinguish bound and unbound configurations, enabling quantitative analysis of how ion valency modulates complex stability and structure. The results reveal a clear hierarchy of association strength with Ca$^{2+}$ promoting persistent complex formation through direct inner-sphere coordination between DNA phosphates and PAA carboxylates, Mg$^{2+}$ mediating weaker, transient bridging interactions and Na$^+$ exhibiting only electrostatic screening action with negligible bridge formation. Structural analysis shows that multivalent ions not only enhance complex stability but also reshape the molecular organization of both macromolecules. Ca$^{2+}$ induces expansion of DNA and compaction of PAA within a strongly bridged complex characterized by directional alignment and backbone-dominated binding, whereas Mg$^{2+}$ promotes more transient groove associations and Na$^+$ supports flexible, weakly correlated contacts. Our findings provide molecular-level insight into ion-specific mechanisms underlying polyelectrolyte organization and inform the design of responsive biomaterials and nucleic acid-based assemblies in multivalent ionic environments.

Title: Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) with row-update Projected Entangled-Pair States (PEPS) and its applications in quantum spin glasses
Authors: Tao Chen, Jing Liu, Yantao Wu, Pan Zhang, Youjin Deng
Abstract: Solving the quantum many-body ground state problem remains a central challenge in computational physics. In this context, the Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) framework based on Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS) has witnessed rapid development, establishing itself as a vital approach for investigating strongly correlated two-dimensional systems. However, standard PEPS-VMC algorithms predominantly rely on sequential local updates. This conventional approach often suffers from slow convergence and critical slowing down, particularly in the vicinity of phase transitions or within frustrated landscapes. To address these limitations, we propose an efficient autoregressive row-wise sampling algorithm for PEPS that enables direct, rejection-free sampling via single-layer contractions. By utilizing autoregressive single-layer row updates to generate collective, non-local configuration proposals, our method significantly reduces temporal correlations compared to local Metropolis moves. We benchmark the algorithm on the two-dimensional transverse-field Ising model and the quantum spin glass. Our results demonstrate that the row-wise scheme effectively mitigates critical slowing down near the Ising critical point. Furthermore, in the rugged landscape of the quantum spin glass, it yields improved optimization stability and lower ground-state energies. These findings indicate that single-layer autoregressive row updates provide a flexible and robust improvement to local PEPS-VMC sampling and may serve as a basis for more advanced sampling schemes.

Title: Exchange-dominated origin of spin-wave nonreciprocity in planar magnetic multilayers
Authors: Claudia Negrete (1), Attila Kákay (2), Jorge A. Otálora (2) ((1) Departamento de Física, Universidad Católica del Norte, Avenida Angamos, Antofagasta, Chile, (2) Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden Rossendorf, Institute of Ion Beam Physics and Materials Research, Bautzner Landstr. Dresden, Germany)
Abstract: Spin-wave nonreciprocity, manifested as a frequency difference between counterpropagating modes, underpins many proposed magnonic devices. While this effect is commonly attributed to dipolar interactions or interfacial chirality, the microscopic origin of nonreciprocal dispersion in magnetic multilayers remains under debate. Here, we analyze nonreciprocal spin-wave dispersion in planar multilayer heterostructures without Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Using a frequency-shift dynamic matrix and an interaction-resolved dynamic energy-density formalism, we show that the frequency asymmetry cannot generally be ascribed to dipolar effects alone. Instead, once counterpropagating modes differ in their geometric structure along the thickness, interlayer exchange dominates the frequency shift. Applied to representative multilayer systems, we find that the interlayer exchange contribution exceeds dipolar and intralayer exchange effects by up to two to three orders of magnitude over a broad wave-vector range. Our results establish interlayer exchange as the primary mechanism controlling nonreciprocal dispersion in multilayer magnonic systems and provide a quantitative framework for engineering large frequency shifts in nonreciprocal magnonic devices.

Title: Double-exchange ferromagnetism of fermionic atoms in a $p$-orbital hexagonal lattice
Authors: Haoran Sun, Erhai Zhao, Youjin Deng, W. Vincent Liu
Abstract: A large class of correlated quantum materials feature strong Hund's coupling. Yet cold-atom quantum simulators have so far focused primarily on single-orbital Fermi-Hubbard systems near a Mott insulator. Here we show that repulsively interacting fermions loaded into the $p$-bands of a hexagonal lattice offer a unique platform to study the interplay of "Hundness" and "Mottness." Our theory predicts that the orbital degrees of freedom, despite geometric frustration, produce a rich phase diagram featuring a competing itinerant ferromagnetic (FM) metal and a spin-1 antiferromagnetic (AFM) insulator, with a surprising first-order transition between them controlled by density near half-filling. Ferromagnetism emerges at low fillings from the flat band and persists to stronger interactions and higher fillings via a double-exchange mechanism, where spins align to avoid Hund-rule penalties at the expense of Dirac-fermion kinetic energy. We further argue that the paramagnetic regime is a correlated "Hund metal." $p$-orbital Fermi gases thus provide an ideal experimental setting to investigate competing exchange mechanisms in multi-orbital systems with coexisting localized and itinerant spins.

Title: Impact of O concentration on the thermal stability and decomposition mechanism of (Cr,Al)N compared to (Ti,Al)N thin films
Authors: Pauline Kümmerl, Ganesh Kumar Nayak, Felix Leinenbach, Zsolt Czigány, Daniel Primetzhofer, Szilárd Kolozsvári, Peter Polcik, Marcus Hans, Jochen M. Schneider
Abstract: The composition-dependent thermal stability of (Cr$_{0.47 \mp 0.03}$Al$_{0.53 \mp 0.03}$)$_{z}$(O$_{y}$N$_{1-y}$)$_{1-z}$ thin films with O concentrations of y = 0, 0.15, and 0.40 is investigated up to 1200 °C and then compared to (Ti$_{0.56}$Al$_{0.44}$)$_{z}$(O$_{y}$N$_{1-y}$)$_{1-z}$. X-ray diffraction reveals a thermal stability limit of 1150 °C independent of the O concentration, as witnessed by the formation of decomposition products, namely h-Cr$_{2}$N for (Cr$_{0.50}$Al$_{0.50}$)$_{0.49}$N$_{0.51}$ and c-Cr for both (Cr$_{0.48}$Al$_{0.52}$)$_{0.48}$(O$_{0.15}$N$_{0.85}$)$_{0.52}$ and (Cr$_{0.44}$Al$_{0.56}$)$_{0.46}$(O$_{0.40}$N$_{0.60}$)$_{0.54}$. Based on TEM and ERDA data, the thermal stability limit is extended to 1100 - 1150 °C. DFT calculations indicate that bond breaking limits the thermal stability. In (Cr,Al)N, N has the lowest activation energy for migration. Furthermore, the O vacancy formation energy is highest in (Cr,Al)(O,N). It has to be overcome to enable diffusion on the non-metal sublattice, which is necessary for forming decomposition products like w-AlN or c-Cr. However, once Cr-N bonds break, decomposition into h-Cr$_{2}$N and subsequent c-Cr together with N$_{2}$ is triggered. This results in N evaporation, generating sufficient non-metal vacancies that greatly enhance diffusion and render the extensive vacancy formation energies for non-metals irrelevant. This reduction of the activation energy for mass transport on the non-metal sublattice to the migration barrier causes the similar thermal stability in (Cr$_{0.47 \mp 0.03}$Al$_{0.53 \mp 0.03}$)$_{z}$(O$_{y}$N$_{1-y}$)$_{1-z}$. In contrast, Al bonds break first without creating non-metal vacancies in (Ti,Al)(O,N). Thus, the high O vacancy formation energy in (Ti,Al)(O,N) significantly increases the thermal stability compared to (Ti,Al)N as well as the here investigated films.

Abstract: Quantum control of the many-body wavefunction is a central challenge in quantum materials research, as it could yield a precise control knob to manipulate emergent phenomena. Floquet engineering, the coherent dressing of quantum states with periodic non-resonant optical fields, has become an important strategy for quantum control. Most applications to solid-state systems have targeted weakly interacting or single-ion states, leaving the manipulation of many-body wavefunctions largely unexplored. Here, we use Floquet engineering to achieve quantum control of a strongly correlated Hubbard exciton in the one-dimensional Mott insulator Sr$_2$CuO$_3$. A nonresonant midinfrared optical field coherently dresses the exciton wavefunction, driving its rotation between bright and dark states. We use resonant third-harmonic generation to quantify ultrafast $\pi/2$ rotations on the Bloch sphere spanned by these exciton states. Our work advances the quest towards programmable control of correlated states and exciton-based quantum sensing.

Title: Collective excitations in chiral spin liquid: chiral roton and long-wavelength nematic mode
Authors: Hongyu Lu, Wei Zhu, Wang Yao
Abstract: Chiral spin liquid (CSL) is a magnetic analogue of the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) liquid. Collective excitations play a vital role in shaping our understanding of these exotic quantum phases of matter and their quantum phase transitions. While the magneto-roton and long-wavelength chiral graviton modes in the FQH liquids have been extensively explored, the collective excitations of CSLs remain elusive. Here we explore the collective excitations in the SU(2) symmetric CSL phase of the spin-1/2 square-lattice $J_1-J_2-J_\chi$ model, where an intriguing quantum phase diagram was recently revealed. Combining exact diagonalization and time-dependent variational principle calculations, we observe two spin-singlet collective modes: a chiral p-wave (low-energy) roton mode at finite momentum and a d-wave (higher-energy) nematic mode at zero momentum, both of which are prominent across the CSL phase. Such exotic modes exhibit fingerprints distinct from those of FQH liquids, and to the best of our knowledge, are reported for the first time. By tuning $J_2$, we find the nematic mode to be pronouncedly soft, together with the spin-triplet two-spinon bound states, potentially promoting strong nematic and spin stripe instabilities. Our work paves the way for further understanding CSL from the dynamical perspective and provides new spectroscopic signatures for future experiments of CSL candidates.

Title: Manipulating ferroelectricity without electrical bias: A perspective
Authors: Bixin Yan, Valentine Gillioz, Ipek Efe, Morgan Trassin
Abstract: Ferroelectric materials are established candidates for beyond complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technology, owing to their non-volatile spontaneous electrical polarization. The recent boom in electric dipole texture engineering and manipulation in such materials has revealed exciting routes for controlling ferroelectric polarization, offering alternatives to the classical, sometimes challenging, application of electrical fields. In this short perspective, we shed light on electrode-free external stimuli enabling control over polar states in thin films. We bring awareness to the polarizing role of chemically-engineered surface contributions and provide insights into the combination of chemical substitution and mechanical pressure, complementing the polar state tuning capabilities readily enabled by flexoelectricity. Finally, we describe recent developments in the optical modulation of polarization. Thus, our perspective aims to stimulate the advancement of alternative means to act on polarization states and facilitate the development of ferroelectric-based applications.

Title: Universality of Type-II Multiferroicity in Monolayer Nickel Dihalides
Authors: Aleš Cahlík, Antti Karjasilta, Anshika Mishra, Robert Drost, Mohammad Amini, Javaria Arshad, Büşra Arslan, Peter Liljeroth
Abstract: The recent discovery of type-II multiferroicity in monolayer NiI${_2}$ indicated a new pathway for intrinsic magnetoelectric coupling in the two-dimensional limit. However, determining whether this phenomenon is a unique anomaly or a general, chemically tunable property of the material class remains unresolved. Here, we demonstrate the universality of type-II multiferroicity in the transition metal dihalides by visualizing the ferroelectric order in monolayer NiBr${_2}$. Using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), we resolve atomic-scale ferroelectric domains and confirm their magnetoelectric origin through reciprocal manipulation experiments: reorienting magnetic order via electric fields and suppressing the electric polarization with external magnetic fields. Furthermore, we find that the multiferroic state in NiBr${_2}$ is energetically less robust than in its iodide counterpart, consistent with modified superexchange interactions and the reduced spin-orbit coupling. Our results establish the transition metal dihalides as a versatile platform where the stability of magnetoelectric phases can be engineered through chemical substitution.

Title: From biting to engulfment: curvature-actin coupling controls phagocytosis of soft, deformable targets
Authors: Shubhadeep Sadhukhan, Caitlin E. Cornell, Mansehaj Kaur Sandhu, Youri Peeters, Samo Penič, Aleš Iglič, Daniel A. Fletcher, Valentin Jaumouillé, Daan Vorselen, Nir S. Gov
Abstract: Phagocytosis is a fundamental process of the innate immune system, yet the physical determinants that govern the engulfment of soft, deformable targets remain poorly understood. Existing theoretical models typically approximate targets as rigid particles, overlooking the fact that both immune cells and many biological targets undergo significant membrane deformation during contact. Here, we develop a Monte Carlo-based membrane simulation framework to model the interactions of multiple vesicles, enabling us to explore phagocytosis-like processes in systems where both the phagocyte and the target possess flexible, thermally fluctuating membranes. We first validate our approach against established observations for the engulfment of rigid objects. We then investigate how the mechanical properties of a soft target -- specifically membrane bending rigidity govern the outcome of phagocytic interactions. Our simulations reveal three distinct mechanical regimes: (i) biting or trogocytosis, in which the phagocyte extracts a portion of the target vesicle; (ii) pushing, where the target is displaced rather than engulfed; and (iii) full engulfment, in which the target is completely internalized. Increasing membrane tension via internal pressure produces analogous transitions, demonstrating a unified mechanical origin for these behaviours. Qualitative comparison with experiments involving Giant Unilamellar Vesicles (GUVs, deformable microparticles) and lymphoma cells supports the relevance of these regimes to biological phagocytosis. Together, these results highlight how target deformability fundamentally shapes phagocytic success and suggest that immune cells may exploit mechanical cues to recognize among different classes of soft targets.

Title: Directionality and node heterogeneity reshape criticality in hypergraph percolation
Authors: Yunxue Sun, Xueming Liu, Ginestra Bianconi
Abstract: Directed and heterogeneous hypergraphs capture directional higher-order interactions with intrinsically asymmetric functional dependencies among nodes. As a result, damage to certain nodes can suppress entire hyperedges, whereas failure of others only weakens interactions. Metabolic reaction networks offer an intuitive example of such asymmetric dependencies. Here we develop a message-passing and statistical mechanics framework for percolation in directed hypergraphs that explicitly incorporates directionality and node heterogeneity. Remarkably, we show that these hypergraph features have a fundamental effect on the critical properties of hypergraph percolation, reshaping criticality in a way that depends on network structure. Specifically, we derive anomalous critical exponents that depend on whether node or hyperedge percolation is considered in maximally correlated, heavy-tailed regimes. These theoretical predictions are validated on synthetic hypergraph models and on a real directed metabolic network, opening new perspectives for the characterization of the robustness and resilience of real-world directed, heterogeneous higher-order networks.

Title: Star-like microgels vs star polymers: similarities and differences
Authors: Tommaso Papetti, Elisa Ballin, Francesco Brasili, Emanuela Zaccarelli
Abstract: Star-like microgels have recently emerged as a promising class of thermoresponsive soft colloids, that have an internal architecture similar to that of star polymers. Here, we perform extensive monomer-resolved simulations to theoretically establish this analogy. First, we characterize the effective potential between star-like microgels, finding that it is Gaussian for an extended range of distances, in stark contrast to the Hertzian-like one of standard microgels, but almost identical to that of star polymers with a core partially covered by chains. Next, we investigate the ratio between gyration and hydrodynamic radii across the volume-phase transition, showing qualitative agreement with both star polymers and experimental data. Finally, we estimate the bulk modulus, finding star-like microgels significantly softer than standard microgels and comparable to star polymers. The present work thus demonstrates that star-like microgels behave as ultrasoft particles, akin to star polymers, paving the way for their exploration at high concentrations.

Title: Morphological Stability of Metal Anodes: Roles of Solid Electrolyte Interphases (SEIs) and Desolvation Kinetics
Authors: Jin Zhang, Peter W. Voorhees
Abstract: Achieving stable lithium metal anodes requires control over the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) and desolvation kinetics. Here, we develop a unified theoretical framework integrating ion transport, desolvation, charge transfer, and SEI breakdown to predict morphological instabilities during electrodeposition. Using linear stability analysis, we identify six dimensionless parameters that govern the onset and evolution of instabilities. We show that SEI transport and desolvation rate effectively modulate apparent reaction kinetics, shifting the system toward a stable, reaction-limited regime. Extending the classical limiting current concept, we demonstrate that a thick, poorly conductive SEI and sluggish desolvation significantly reduce the limiting current. We introduce an apparent Damköhler number to quantify the critical balance: suppressing diffusion-limited instabilities by reaction rate reduction, while maintaining a high limiting current. Our theory enables predictive mapping of electrodeposition morphologies across diverse materials and operating conditions, guiding the rational design of stable lithium metal anodes.

Title: Multiscale Numerical Modelling of Ultrafast Laser-Matter Interactions: Maxwell Two Temperature Model Molecular Dynamics (M-TTM-MD)
Authors: Othmane Benhayoun, Martin E. Garcia
Abstract: In this work, we present a comprehensive numerical framework that couples numerical solutions of Maxwell's equations using the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) approach, Molecular Dynamics (MD), and the Two-Temperature Model (TTM) to describe ultrafast laser-matter interactions in metallic systems at the atomic scale. The proposed Maxwell-Two-Temperature Model-Molecular Dynamics (M-TTM-MD) bridges the gap between electromagnetic field propagation, electron-phonon energy exchange, and atomic motion, allowing for a self-consistent treatment of energy absorption, transport, and structural response within a unified simulation environment. The calculated electromagnetic fields incorporate dispersive dielectric properties derived using the Auxiliary Differential Equation (ADE) technique, while the electronic and lattice subsystems are dynamically coupled through spatially and temporally resolved energy exchange terms. The changes in the material topography are then reflected in the updated grid for the FDTD scheme. The developed M-TTM-MD model provides a self-consistent numerical framework that offers insights into laser-induced phenomena in metals, including energy transport and surface dynamics under extreme nonequilibrium conditions.

Title: Observation of Dipolar Spin-ice--like Correlations in the Quantum Spin Ice Candidate Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$
Authors: Bo Yuan, M. Powell, X. Liu, J. Ni, E. M. Smith, F. Ye, J. Dudemaine, A. D. Bianchi, J. W. Kolis, B. D. Gaulin
Abstract: The Ce$_2$X$_2$O$_7$ (X=Sn, Hf, Zr) family of cubic pyrochlores has emerged as one of the most promising classes of Quantum Spin Ice candidates. However, understanding their microscopic exchange Hamiltonian and spin correlations has been hampered by varying sample quality, and poor signal-to-noise in the existing neutron data due to a small Ce$^{3+}$ magnetic dipole moment. In this work, we overcome these challenges and report single-crystal diffuse neutron scattering from hydrothermally grown Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$ -- the highest quality crystals obtained to date for the Ce$_2$X$_2$O$_7$ family. In contrast to the broad diffuse scattering observed in Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ and Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$, we find highly structured diffuse scattering from Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$ featuring strong intensities along the Brillouin zone boundaries. The observed $\mathbf{Q}$-dependence disagrees with predictions of the nearest neighbour XYZ model commonly used for Ce$_2$X$_2$O$_7$, but is remarkably similar to the diffuse scattering observed in \textit{classical} Dipolar Spin Ice. Our study highlights the importance of further neighbour interactions in determining the low energy physics of the Ce-pyrochlores, and calls for a revision of the current theoretical framework to incorporate their effects.

Title: Millisecond spin coherence of electrons in semiconducting perovskites revealed by spin mode locking
Authors: Sergey R. Meliakov, Evgeny A. Zhukov, Vasilii V. Belykh, Dmitri R. Yakovlev, Bekir Turedi, Maksym V. Kovalenko, Manfred Bayer
Abstract: Long spin coherence times of carriers are essential for implementing quantum technologies using semiconductor devices for which, however, a possible obstacle is spin relaxation. For the spin dynamics, decisive features are the band structure, crystal symmetry, and quantum confinement. Perovskite semiconductors recently have come into focus of studies of their spin states, notivated by efficient optical access and potentially long-living coherence. Here, we report an electron spin coherence time $T_2$ of the order of 1 ms, measured for a bulk FA$_{0.95}$Cs$_{0.05}$PbI$_3$ lead halide perovskite crystal. Using periodic laser pulses, we synchronize the electron spin Larmor precession about an external magnetic field in an inhomogeneous ensemble, the effect known as spin mode locking. It appears as a decay of the optically created ensemble spin polarization within the dephasing time $T_2^*$ of up to 20 ns and its revival during the spin coherence time $T_2$ reaching the millisecond range. This exceptionally long spin coherence time in a bulk crystal is complemented by millisecond-long longitudinal spin relaxation times $T_1$ for electrons and holes, measured by optically-detected magnetic resonance. These long-lasting spin dynamics highlight perovskites as promising platform for the quantum devices with all-optical control.

Title: A Purely Magnetic Route to High-Harmonic Spin Pumping
Authors: Ousmane Ly
Abstract: Spin pumping provides a fundamental route for dynamical spin transport, yet in its conventional form it produces only linear spin responses at the driving frequency. Recent studies have shown that spin-orbit coupling (SOC) can lift these restrictions and enable highly nonlinear spin and charge currents. Here we propose a distinct mechanism for high-harmonic spin pumping that does not rely on spin-orbit interactions. We show that nonlinearities in the adiabatic energy spectrum--rather than SOC itself--constitute the essential ingredient for high-harmonic generation in pumped spin currents. Such nonlinearities can arise in purely magnetic systems when a secondary magnetic order parameter is introduced perpendicular to the cone axis of a precessing magnetic moment. As a result, spin pumping and its higher harmonics emerge even in the complete absence of SOC. Our findings establish a new route to ultrafast spin pumping based solely on magnetic structure and dynamics.

Title: Controlling the snap-through behavior of kirigami arches
Authors: Eszter Fehér
Abstract: This work examines the snap-through behavior of clamped-clamped kirigami arches made from initially flat, thin, cut sheets under increasing vertical concentrated load acting at midspan. A two-parameter, symmetric pattern is introduced to conduct a numerical parameter analysis across three different support distances. When the support distance is one-quarter of the total length of the sheet, the structure loses stability at a symmetry point bifurcation over a wide range of parameters. Additionally, there exists a small range of parameters where limit point bifurcation occurs. In this case, the cuts can induce symmetry in the stability loss. For larger support distances (half or three-quarters of the total length), limit point bifurcation occurs only for small cuts, and there is a range of cut parameters that leads to monotonic monostability, indicating that no stability loss occurs. These findings are supported by experimental data. Overall, our research demonstrates that carefully designed cut patterns can either control the mode of stability loss in kirigami arches or suppress it entirely.

Title: Fingerprinting superconductors by disentangling Andreev and quasiparticle currents across tunable tunnel junctions
Authors: Petro Maksymovych, Sang Yong Song, Benjamin Lawrie, Wonhee Ko, Jose L. Lado
Abstract: Tunneling Andreev reflection (TAR) spectroscopy offers a powerful new approach to fingerprint superconducting pairing symmetry at the atomic scale. By leveraging the exponential sensitivity of excess tunneling decay rate to Andreev reflection, TAR robustly distinguishes between s-wave, d-wave, and more complex order parameters, overcoming limitations of traditional conductance-based techniques. Here, using atomistic superconducting transport simulations, we show that the additivity of excess decay rate enables clear separation of Andreev and quasiparticle currents. In particular, we reveal how their competition as well as higher-order scattering processes shape both the decay rate spectra and their dependence on the coupling strength. We show that this phenomenology stems from the fact that Andreev reflection dominates mid-gap conductance for s-wave superconductors, it is suppressed for the d-wave, and it coexists with quasiparticle tunneling in sign-changing symmetries if the expectation value for the superconducting gap remains finite. These distinct spectral fingerprints pave the way for atomically resolved identification of unconventional superconducting states.

Title: Observation of Real-Space Dynamic Electron Correlation in Beryllium
Authors: Rudra B. Bista, Yuya Shinohara, Wojciech Dmowski, Chae Woo Ryu, Jung Ho Kim, Mary Upton, Hlynur Gretarsson, Martin Sundermann, Takeshi Egami
Abstract: Electron correlation in solid has a major impact on material properties. However, it has been studied mainly by theory, with very limited direct experimental investigations. Here, we report the results of real-space measurement of dynamic electron correlation using inelastic X-ray scattering on polycrystalline beryllium. The data are expressed as the energy-resolved dynamic pair-distribution function. Our results confirm the size of the exchange-correlation hole as ~2 Å, consistent with theoretical expectations. However, at the plasmon energy of ~21 eV, the exchange-correlation hole is extended up to 4-5 Å, suggesting a unique influence of the dynamic plasmon state.

Title: Stripe antiferromagnetism and chiral superconductivity in tWSe$_2$
Authors: Erekle Jmukhadze, Sam Olin, Allan H. MacDonald, Wei-Cheng Lee
Abstract: The layer-dependent Hamiltonians of parallel-stacked MoTe$_2$ and WSe$_2$ homobilayer moiré materials are topologically non-trivial, both in real space and in momentum space, and have been shown to support integer and fractional quantum anomalous Hall states, as well as antiferromagnetic and superconducting states. Here, we address the interplay between the antiferromagnetic and superconducting states observed in tWSe$_2$ when the Fermi level is close to its $M$-point van Hove singularity and the displacement field is small. We combine DFT with path-integrals to construct a minimal moiré band model that accounts for lattice relaxation along the $c$-axis and perform Hartree-Fock calculations to identify competing charge and spin ordered states. For tWSe$_2$ at $\theta=2.7^\circ$ and $\theta=3.65^\circ$, we find that a layer antiferromagnet (AFM), a stripe spin-density-wave (SDW), and the ferromagnetic Chern insulator (FM) are the primary candidates for the ground state at zero displacement field, and argue that antiferromagnetic spin interactions on the next neighbor bond $J_2$ can induce a time-reversal symmetry breaking chiral superconducting state.

Title: Field induced superconductivity in a magnetically doped two-dimensional crystal
Authors: Adrian Llanos, Veronica Show, Reiley Dorrian, Joseph Falson
Abstract: Magnetic field induced superconductivity is a rare property in nature due to the sensitivity of spin-singlet Cooper pairing to time-reversal symmetry breaking perturbations. However, in rare cases, an interplay between magnetic fields and ions can be engineered to bring about superconductivity at finite fields. Here we use ultra-thin LaSb$_2$ doped with dilute Ce paramagnetic impurities to demonstrate a magnetic field-induced superconducting dome in a two-dimensional crystal. The reduced dimensionality of the structure enables the use of an in-plane magnetic field to dynamically suppress spin fluctuations on the Ce-site, which leads to an anomalous enhancement of the critical temperature with increasing field. By modelling the spin scattering dynamics across the experimental parameter space, we reveal insight into the complex nature of paramagnetic impurities in magnetic fields at low temperature, and how their manipulation can result in the ability to tune between competing magnetic pair-breaking regimes. Realizing this physics in a two-dimensional crystalline setting invites the application of similar approaches to unconventional forms of superconductivity while also highlighting new experimental standards which should be employed when studying ultra-thin materials in general.

Title: Heat, work, and fluctuations in a driven quantum resonator
Authors: Riya Baruah, Pedro Portugal, Jun-Zhe Chen, Joachim Wabnig, Christian Flindt
Abstract: A central building block of a heat engine is the working fluid, which mediates the conversion of heat into work. In nanoscale heat engines, the working fluid can be a quantum system whose behavior and dynamics are non-classical. A particularly versatile realization is a quantum resonator, which allows for precise control and coupling to thermal reservoirs, making it an ideal platform for exploring quantum thermodynamic processes. Here, we investigate the thermodynamic properties of a driven quantum resonator whose temperature is controlled by modulating its natural frequency. We evaluate the work performed by the external drive and the resulting heat flow between the resonator and its environment, both within linear response and beyond. To further elucidate these processes, we determine the full distribution of photon exchanges between the resonator and its environment, characterized by its first few cumulants. Our results provide quantitative insights into the interplay between heat, work, and fluctuations, and may help in designing future heat engines.

Title: Advances in ion-doping of Ca-Mg silicate bioceramics for bone tissue engineering
Authors: Ashkan Namdar, Erfan Salahinejad
Abstract: The use of bioceramics as hard tissue substitutes is extensive due to their excellent biocompatible and osteogenic behaviors. Among various bioceramics, Ca-Mg silicates are unique from the viewpoints of osteoinductive and mechanical properties, as well as their outstanding osteoconductive and angiogenic behaviors owing to the release of Si, Ca and Mg. Despite these distinct advantages, different compositions of these bioceramics still require mechanical and biological enhancements for further applications. For this purpose, doping with some ions like F-, Sr2+, Cu2+, Eu2+, Ba+, Ce3+ and some alkali cations has been proved to be a valued approach. This review attempts to bring together areas for the performance improvement of the further researched Ca-Mg silicates (i.e., diopside, akermanite, bredigite and monticellite) and the alteration of these compositions via ion-doping. It is concluded that a correct choice of dopants incorporated at the optimal concentration makes these silicates ideal bone substitutes competing or even superior to calcium phosphates (apatites) and bioglasses which are known as the most prominent bioceramics.

Title: Controlled drug delivery from chitosan-coated heparin-loaded nanopores anodically grown on nitinol shape-memory alloy
Authors: M. Moradi, E. Salahinejad, E. Sharifi, L. Tayebi
Abstract: Nitinol (NiTi shape-memory alloy) is an interesting candidate in various medical applications like dental, orthopedic, and cardiovascular devices, owing to its unique mechanical behaviors and proper biocompatibility. The aim of this work is the local controlled delivery of a cardiovascular drug, heparin, loaded onto nitinol treated by electrochemical anodizing and chitosan coating. In this regard, the structure, wettability, drug release kinetics, and cell cytocompatibility of the specimens were analyzed in vitro. The two-stage anodizing process successfully developed a regular nanoporous layer of Ni-Ti-O on nitinol, which considerably decreased the sessile water contact angle and induced hydrophilicity. The application of the chitosan coatings controlled the release of heparin mainly by a diffusional mechanism, where the drug release mechanisms were evaluated by the Higuchi, first-order, zero-order, and Korsmeyer-Pepass models. Human umbilical cord endothelial cells (HUVECs) viability assay also showed the non-cytotoxicity of the samples, so that the best performance was found for the chitosan-coated samples. It is concluded that the designed drug delivery systems are promising for cardiovascular, particularly stent applications.

Abstract: Fluorescent spin qubits are central building blocks of quantum technologies. Placing these qubits at surfaces maximizes coupling to nearby spins and fields, enabling nanoscale sensing and facilitating integration with photonic and superconducting devices. However, reducing the dimensions or size of established qubit systems without sacrificing the qubit performance or degrading the coherence lifetime remains challenging. Here, we introduce a surface molecular qubit formed by pentacene molecules scaffolded on a two-dimensional (2D) material, hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). The qubit exhibits stable fluorescence and optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) from cryogenic to ambient conditions. With fully deuterated pentacene, the Hahn-echo coherence reaches 22 $\mu$s and further extends to 214 $\mu$s under dynamical decoupling, outperforming state-of-the-art shallow NV centers in diamond, despite being positioned directly on the surface. We map the local spin environment, resolving couplings to nearby nuclear and electron spins that can serve as auxiliary quantum resources. This platform combines true surface integration, long qubit coherence, and scalable fabrication, opening routes to quantum sensing, quantum simulation, and hybrid quantum devices. It also paves the way for a broader family of 2D material-supported molecular qubits.

Title: On the Wilson-Fisher fixed point in the limit of integer spacetime dimensions
Authors: Bernardo Zan
Abstract: The Wilson-Fisher fixed point defines a continuous family of interacting conformal field theories in non-integer dimensions. In integer dimensions, it is widely believed to lie in the same universality class as the critical Ising model. In this work, we revisit the identification between the Wilson-Fisher fixed point at integer dimensions and the Ising CFT. We argue that a literal equality between the two theories is incompatible with the emergence of Virasoro symmetry in two dimensions. Instead, we propose that the Ising model emerges only as a subsector of the Wilson-Fisher fixed point. We support this scenario through a detailed study of the two-dimensional $O(n)$ model and by examining operators transforming in irreducible representations of the orthogonal group whose multiplicities become negative for integer values of the spacetime dimension. Finally, we comment on the implications of these results for attempts to construct a $d=2+\epsilon$ expansion starting from exact two-dimensional data.

Title: Timelike Entanglement Signatures of Ergodicity and Spectral Chaos
Authors: Rathindra Nath Das, Arnab Kundu, Nemai Chandra Sarkar
Abstract: We investigate timelike entanglement measures derived from the spacetime density kernel in the Rosenzweig-Porter model and show that they sharply diagnose both eigenvector ergodicity and spectral chaos. For several Hilbert-space bipartitions, we compute the second Tsallis entropy, the entanglement imagitivity that quantifies non-Hermiticity, and Schatten-norm diagnostics of the kernel. The imagitivity and Frobenius norm exhibit rapid growth and high late-time plateaus in the ergodic regime, are suppressed in the localized regime, and show intermediate behavior in the fractal phase. The real part of the second Tsallis entropy displays a spectral form factor-like dip-ramp-plateau throughout the chaotic window and a suppressed ramp in the localized regime. We further introduce a kernel negativity, defined as the negative spectral weight of the Hermitian part of the kernel. This negativity equals the trace-norm distance to the set of positive semidefinite operators and the maximal witnessable negative quasiprobability, and its time-averaged value decreases across the ergodic-fractal-localized crossover in close correspondence with the fractal dimension.

Title: The superradiant phase is a finite size effect in two-photon processes
Authors: Fabrizio Ramírez, David Villaseñor, Nahum Vázquez, Jorge G. Hirsch
Abstract: Two-photon light-matter interactions exhibit distinctive features such as spectral collapse. The two-photon Dicke model has been reported to exhibit a superradiant phase which could be useful in quantum applications. Here we show that this superradiant phase is not a genuine thermodynamic phase but a finite-size effect. Combining analytical and numerical analyses, we demonstrate that the superradiant region shrinks with increasing system size and disappears in the thermodynamic limit, while spectral collapse remains. Our results clarify the nature of superradiant conditions in two-photon systems and constrain its realization in quantum platforms.

Abstract: Optically addressable spins at material surfaces have represented a long-standing ambition in quantum sensing, providing atomic resolution and quantum-limited sensitivity. However, they are constrained by a finite depth at which the quantum spins can be stabilized. Here, we demonstrate a hybrid molecular-2D architecture that realizes quantum spin sensors directly on top of the surface. By anchoring spin-active molecules onto hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), we eliminate the depth of the quantum sensor while also exhibiting robust spin properties from 4~K to room temperature (RT). The Hahn-echo spin coherence time exceeds \(T_2 = 3.4~\upmu\text{s}\) at 4~K, outperforming values in bulk organic crystals and overturning the prevailing expectation that spin inevitably deteriorates upon approaching the surface. By chemically tuning the molecule through deuteration, \(T_2\) improves by more than 10-fold, and under dynamic decoupling, coherence is prolonged to the intrinsic lifetime limit, exceeding 300~\(\upmu\text{s}\). Proximal proton spins and the magnetic response of two-dimensional magnets beneath the hBN layer have been detected at RT. These molecular spins form surface quantum sensors with long coherence, optical addressability, and interfacial versatility, enabling a scalable, adaptable architecture beyond what conventional solid-state platforms offer.

Title: Krypton-sputtered tantalum films for scalable high-performance quantum devices
Authors: Maciej W. Olszewski, Lingda Kong, Simon Reinhardt, Daniel Tong, Xinyi Du, Gabriele Di Gianluca, Haoran Lu, Saswata Roy, Luojia Zhang, Aleksandra B. Biedron, David A. Muller, Valla Fatemi
Abstract: Superconducting qubits based on tantalum (Ta) thin films have demonstrated the highest-performing microwave resonators and qubits. This makes Ta an attractive material for superconducting quantum computing applications, but, so far, direct deposition has largely relied on high substrate temperatures exceeding \SI{400}{\celsius} to achieve the body-centered cubic phase, BCC (\textalpha-Ta). This leads to compatibility issues for scalable fabrication leveraging standard semiconductor fabrication lines. Here, we show that changing the sputter gas from argon (Ar) to krypton (Kr) promotes BCC Ta synthesis on silicon (Si) at temperatures as low as \SI{200}{\celsius}, providing a wide process window compatible with back-end-of-the-line fabrication standards. Furthermore, we find these films to have substantially higher electronic conductivity, consistent with clean-limit superconductivity. We validated the microwave performance through coplanar waveguide resonator measurements, finding that films deposited at \SI{250}{\celsius} and \SI{350}{\celsius} exhibit a tight performance distribution at the state of the art. Higher temperature-grown films exhibit higher losses, in correlation with the degree of Ta/Si intermixing revealed by cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy. Finally, with these films, we demonstrate transmon qubits with a relatively compact, \SI{20}{\micro\meter} capacitor gap, achieving a median quality factor up to 14 million.

Title: Quantum statistics from classical simulations via generative Gibbs sampling
Authors: Weizhou Wang, Xuanxi Zhang, Jonathan Weare, Aaron R. Dinner
Abstract: Accurate simulation of nuclear quantum effects is essential for molecular modeling but expensive using path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD). We present GG-PI, a ring-polymer-based framework that combines generative modeling of the single-bead conditional density with Gibbs sampling to recover quantum statistics from classical simulation data. GG-PI uses inexpensive standard classical simulations or existing data for training and allows transfer across temperatures without retraining. On standard test systems, GG-PI significantly reduces wall clock time compared to PIMD. Our approach extends easily to a wide range of problems with similar Markov structure.

Abstract: Scanning transmission X-ray microscopy and ptychography have become mature tools for high-resolution, element-specific imaging of nanoscale structures. However, transmission geometries impose stringent constraints on sample thickness and preparation, thereby limiting investigations of extended or bulk specimens, especially in the soft X-ray region. Here, we demonstrate reflection geometry soft X-ray ptychography as a robust imaging mode. Instrumental feasibility and spatial resolution are established using a lithographically defined Siemens star and barcode test pattern on a multilayer substrate. We empirically demonstrate a full-pitch spatial resolution of ca. 45 nm from Fourier ring correlation analysis of the reconstructed object. The results highlight the potential of the reflection geometry for nondestructive X-ray studies of materials without the need for transmissive samples.

Title: Fingerprints of classical memory in quantum hysteresis
Authors: Francesco Caravelli
Abstract: We present a simple framework for classical and quantum ``memory'' in which the Hamiltonian at time $t$ depends on past values of a control Hamiltonian through a causal kernel. This structure naturally describes finite-bandwidth or filtered control channels and provides a clean way to distinguish between memory in the control and genuine non-Markovian dynamics of the state. We focus on models where $H(t)=H_0+\int_{-\infty}^{t}K(t-s)\,H_1(s)\,ds$, and illustrate the framework on single-qubit examples such as $H(t)=\sigma_z+\Phi(t)\sigma_x$ with $\Phi(t)=\int_{-\infty}^{t}K(t-s)\,u(s)\,ds$. We derive basic properties of such dynamics, discuss conditions for unitarity, give an equivalent time-local description for exponential kernels, and show explicitly how hysteresis arises in the response of a driven qubit.

Title: SITH: A Quantum-Chemical Framework for Predicting Bond Destabilization in Stretched Molecules
Authors: Daniel Sucerquia, Mikaela Farrugia, Andreas Dreuw, Frauke Gräter
Abstract: Mechanical forces can selectively destabilize chemical bonds of molecular systems, particularly in biological and synthetic polymers. While experimental and theoretical methods have advanced our understanding of mechanochemical processes, predicting where energy concentrates within a molecule remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce SITH (Splitting Intramolecular Tension due to stretcHing), a novel method that decomposes the total electronic energy change of a stretched molecule into contributions from individual degrees of freedom -- such as bond lengths, angles, and dihedrals -- using numerical integration of the work-energy theorem. Unlike previous approaches that rely on harmonic approximations, SITH provides high accuracy and robustness to study the distribution of energies of stretched molecules up to a first bond cleavage. Although SITH uses 3N-6 degrees of freedom for the energy decomposition, we show that it can work even for ring structures like prolines. We apply SITH to a dataset of tripeptides and demonstrate that glycine and proline exhibit significantly different energy distributions in their Ca-C backbone bonds under tension: glycine stores more energy, making it more prone to rupture, while proline has the opposite behaviour. These findings reveal intrinsic differences in mechanochemical susceptibility across amino acids, offering more accurate predictions of bond rupture in proteins, and similarly in other (bio)polymers. SITH thus provides a powerful, interpretable tool for understanding energy distribution at the quantum level, with possible implications in mechanochemistry and force field validation.

Title: Time complexity of a monitored quantum search with resetting
Authors: Emma C. King, Sayan Roy, Francesco Mattiotti, Maximilian Kiefer-Emmanouilidis, Markus Bläser, Giovanna Morigi
Abstract: Searching a database is a central task in computer science and is paradigmatic of transport and optimization problems in physics. For an unstructured search, Grover's algorithm predicts a quadratic speedup, with the search time $\tau(N)=\Theta(\sqrt{N})$ and $N$ the database size. Numerical studies suggest that the time complexity can change in the presence of feedback, injecting information during the search. Here, we determine the time complexity of the quantum analog of a randomized algorithm, which implements feedback in a simple form. The search is a continuous-time quantum walk on a complete graph, where the target is continuously monitored by a detector. Additionally, the quantum state is reset if the detector does not click within a specified time interval. This yields a non-unitary, non-Markovian dynamics. We optimize the search time as a function of the hopping amplitude, detection rate, and resetting rate, and identify the conditions under which time complexity could outperform Grover's scaling. The overall search time does not violate Grover's optimality bound when including the time budget of the physical implementation of the measurement. For databases of finite sizes monitoring can warrant rapid convergence and provides a promising avenue for fault-tolerant quantum searches.

Title: Noise-induced excitability: bloom, bust and extirpation in autotoxic population dynamics
Authors: Pablo Moreno-Spiegelberg, Javier Aguilar
Abstract: Species populations often modify their environment as they grow. When environmental feedback operates more slowly than population growth, the system can undergo boom-bust dynamics, where the population overshoots its carrying capacity and subsequently collapses. In extreme cases, this collapse leads to total extinction. While deterministic models typically fail to capture these finite-time extinction events, we propose a stochastic framework, derived from an individual-based model, to describe boom-bust-extirpation dynamics. We identify a noise-driven, threshold-like behavior where, depending on initial conditions, the population either undergoes a "boom" or is extirpated before the expansion occurs. Furthermore, we characterize a transition between an excitable regime, where most trajectories are captured by the absorbing state immediately after the first bust, and a persistent regime, where most populations reach a metastable state. We show that this transition is governed by the diffusion strength and the ratio of environmental-to-population timescales. This framework provides a theoretical basis for understanding irreversible transitions in invasive species, plant succession, and microbial dynamics.

Title: A scalable flow-based approach to mitigate topological freezing
Authors: Claudio Bonanno, Andrea Bulgarelli, Elia Cellini, Alessandro Nada, Dario Panfalone, Davide Vadacchino, Lorenzo Verzichelli
Abstract: As lattice gauge theories with non-trivial topological features are driven towards the continuum limit, standard Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations suffer for topological freezing, i.e., a dramatic growth of autocorrelations in topological observables. A widely used strategy is the adoption of Open Boundary Conditions (OBC), which restores ergodic sampling of topology but at the price of breaking translation invariance and introducing unphysical boundary artifacts. In this contribution we summarize a scalable, exact flow-based strategy to remove them by transporting configurations from a prior with a OBC defect to a fully periodic ensemble, and apply it to 4d SU(3) Yang--Mills theory. The method is based on a Stochastic Normalizing Flow (SNF) that alternates non-equilibrium Monte Carlo updates with localized, gauge-equivariant defect coupling layers implemented via masked parametric stout smearing. Training is performed by minimizing the average dissipated work, equivalent to a Kullback--Leibler divergence between forward and reverse non-equilibrium path measures, to achieve more reversible trajectories and improved efficiency. We discuss the scaling with the number of degrees of freedom affected by the defect and show that defect SNFs achieve better performances than purely stochastic non-equilibrium methods at comparable cost. Finally, we validate the approach by reproducing reference results for the topological susceptibility.

Title: Neural Quantum States in Mixed Precision
Authors: Massimo Solinas, Agnes Valenti, Nawaf Bou-Rabee, Roeland Wiersema
Abstract: Scientific computing has long relied on double precision (64-bit floating point) arithmetic to guarantee accuracy in simulations of real-world phenomena. However, the growing availability of hardware accelerators such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) has made low-precision formats attractive due to their superior performance, reduced memory footprint, and improved energy efficiency. In this work, we investigate the role of mixed-precision arithmetic in neural-network based Variational Monte Carlo (VMC), a widely used method for solving computationally otherwise intractable quantum many-body systems. We first derive general analytical bounds on the error introduced by reduced precision on Metropolis-Hastings MCMC, and then empirically validate these bounds on the use-case of VMC. We demonstrate that significant portions of the algorithm, in particular, sampling the quantum state, can be executed in half precision without loss of accuracy. More broadly, this work provides a theoretical framework to assess the applicability of mixed-precision arithmetic in machine-learning approaches that rely on MCMC sampling. In the context of VMC, we additionally demonstrate the practical effectiveness of mixed-precision strategies, enabling more scalable and energy-efficient simulations of quantum many-body systems.

Title: Voltage characteristics of hydrodynamic Dirac electron nozzles with supersonic flow
Authors: Kristof Moors, Oleksiy Kashuba, Thomas L. Schmidt
Abstract: In clean Dirac electron systems such as graphene, electron-electron interactions can dominate over other relaxation mechanisms such as phonon or impurity scattering. In this limit, collective electron dynamics can be described by hydrodynamic equations. The prerequisites for electron hydrodynamics have already been fulfilled in experiments, and signatures of hydrodynamic flow have been identified in transport measurements. Here, we derive the pressure-driven hydrodynamic flow profile across a de Laval nozzle profile for Dirac electrons in the subsonic and supersonic regimes. Based on this, we resolve the local voltage characteristics, which provide clear signatures of supersonic hydrodynamic flow. In particular, we identify two distinct features in the experimentally measurable potential profile: a pronounced asymmetry of the local voltage profile on opposite sides of the nozzle, and a sharp differential resistance signature induced by an electron shock wave on the exit side of the nozzle.

Title: Seven Etudes on dynamical Keldysh Model
Authors: D. V. Efremov, M. N. Kiselev
Abstract: We present a comprehensive pedagogical discussion of a family of models describing the propagation of a single particle in a multicomponent non-Markovian Gaussian random field. We report some exact results for single-particle Green's functions, self-energy, vertex part and T-matrix. These results are based on a closed form solution of the Dyson equation combined with the Ward identity. Analytical properties of the solution are discussed. Further we describe the combinatorics of the Feynman diagrams for the Green's function and the skeleton diagrams for the self-energy and vertex, using recurrence relations between the Taylor expansion coefficients of the self-energy. Asymptotically exact equations for the number of skeleton diagrams in the limit of large N are derived. Finally, we consider possible realizations of a multicomponent Gaussian random potential in quantum transport via complex quantum dot experiments.

Title: Transient Elasticity -- A Unifying Framework for Thixotropy, Polymers, and Granular Media
Authors: Mario Liu
Abstract: In solid-dynamics, letting the elastic strain $\bm{\varepsilon^e}$ relax interpolates between solid- and fluid-dynamics, which is appropriate for systems that display both types of behavior. Realizing in addition that complex systems such as structured fluids often sustain two temperatures, yields a model called \textit{Transient Elasticity}. Its adequacy for polymers and granular media was shown in previous papers. Here, it is applied to \textit{thixotropic yield-stress fluids}, showing that typical effects are all accounted for: Stress over- and undershoot, viscosity bifurcation, shear band, yield stresses, oscillatory rheography, and elastic shear waves. So equations capable of accounting for three systems -- deemed unrelated hitherto -- are given. This suggests a unified understanding of many non-Newtonian phenomena, based mainly on how energy is stored and dissipated, in two stages.

Title: Enhanced Kohn-Luttinger topological superconductivity in bands with nontrivial geometry
Authors: Ammar Jahin, Shi-Zeng Lin
Abstract: We study the effect of the electron wavefunction on Kohn-Luttinger superconductivity. The role of the wavefunction is encoded in a complex form factor describing the topology and geometry of the bands. We show that the electron wavefunction significantly impacts the superconducting transition temperature and superconducting order parameter. We illustrate this using the lowest Landau level form factor and find exponential enhancement of Tc for the resulting topological superconductor. We find that the ideal band geometry, which favors a fractional Chern insulator in the flat band limit, has an optimal Tc. Finally, we apply this understanding to a model relevant to rhombohedral graphene multilayers and unravel the importance of the band geometry for achieving robust superconductivity.

Title: Observation of emergent scaling of spin-charge correlations at the onset of the pseudogap
Authors: Thomas Chalopin, Petar Bojović, Si Wang, Titus Franz, Aritra Sinha, Zhenjiu Wang, Dominik Bourgund, Johannes Obermeyer, Fabian Grusdt, Annabelle Bohrdt, Lode Pollet, Alexander Wietek, Antoine Georges, Timon Hilker, Immanuel Bloch
Abstract: In strongly correlated materials, interacting electrons are entangled and form collective quantum states, resulting in rich low-temperature phase diagrams. Notable examples include cuprate superconductors, in which superconductivity emerges at low doping out of an unusual "pseudogap" metallic state above the critical temperature. The Fermi-Hubbard model, describing a wide range of phenomena associated with strong electron correlations, still offers major computational challenges despite its simple formulation. In this context, ultracold atoms quantum simulators have provided invaluable insights into the microscopic nature of correlated quantum states. Here, we use a quantum gas microscope Fermi-Hubbard simulator to explore a wide range of dopings and temperatures in a regime where a pseudogap is known to develop. By measuring multi-point correlation functions up to fifth order, we uncover a novel universal scaling behaviour in magnetic and higher-order spin-charge correlations characterised by a doping-dependent temperature scale. Accurate comparisons with determinant Quantum Monte Carlo and Minimally Entangled Typical Thermal States simulations confirm that this temperature scale is comparable to the pseudogap temperature T*. Our quantitative findings reveal a novel qualitative behaviour of magnetic properties and spin-charge correlations in an emergent pseudogap and pave the way towards the exploration of charge pairing and collective phenomena expected at lower temperatures.

Title: Moduli spaces and breather dynamics of analytic solutions in Heisenberg exchange-free chiral magnets
Authors: Bruno Barton-Singer, Stefano Bolognesi, Sven Bjarke Gudnason, Roberto Menta
Abstract: We investigate the special case of the chiral magnet with vanishing Heisenberg exchange energy, whose axisymmetric Skyrmion solution has previously been found. The dynamical equations of this model look like inviscid fluid flow, and by investigating path lines of this flow we can construct explicit static and dynamic solutions. We find an infinite-dimensional family of static Skyrmions that are related to the axisymmetric Skyrmion by co-ordinate transformations thus discovering a new moduli space, and further infinite-dimensional families of axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric breather-like supercompactons.

Title: Large deviations of density in the non-equilibrium steady state of boundary-driven diffusive systems
Authors: Soumyabrata Saha, Tridib Sadhu
Abstract: A diffusive system coupled to unequal boundary reservoirs reaches a non-equilibrium steady state. While the full-counting-statistics of current fluctuations in these states are well understood for generic systems, results for steady-state density fluctuations remain limited to only a few integrable models. By obtaining an exact solution of the Macroscopic Fluctuation Theory, we characterize steady-state density fluctuations through large deviations for a wide range of boundary-driven diffusive systems. This allows us to identify two distinct classes of systems, one with only short-range correlations and another displaying long-range correlations. We also quantitatively describe the irreversible dynamical paths leading to these rare fluctuations in such systems. For very generic systems in arbitrary dimensions, we use a perturbation around the equilibrium state to solve for large deviations and the corresponding fluctuation paths. We find that non-locality in the large deviations emerges only at quadratic order in the perturbation, revealing non-trivial features of long-range correlations in non-equilibrium steady states.

Title: Spin fluctuations steer the electronic behavior in the FeSb$_{3}$ skutterudite
Authors: Enrico Di Lucente, Flaviano José dos Santos, Nicola Marzari
Abstract: Skutterudites are promising materials for thermoelectric and spintronics applications. Here we explore spin fluctuations in the FeSb$_{3}$ skutterudite and their effect on its electronic structure using Hubbard-corrected density-functional theory calculations. We identify multiple magnetic and charge-disproportionated configurations, with an antiferromagnetic metallic ground state. Paramagnetic fluctuations modeled through a special quasirandom spin structure open a 61 meV gap, consistent with experiments. This state features non-degenerate spin channels and band-avoided crossings, resembling a Luttinger-compensated ferrimagnet. Mapping the electronic structure to a Heisenberg Hamiltonian fails to explain the low Néel temperature ($\lesssim$10 K), suggesting that factors such as stoichiometry and magnetic exchange frustration may play an important role, calling for more detailed experimental investigations.

Title: Forces and symmetry breaking of a living meso-swimmer
Authors: Rafael A. Lara, N. Sharadhi, Anna A. L. Huttunen, Lotta Ansas, Ensio J. G. Rislakki, Guilherme M. Bessa, Matilda Backholm
Abstract: Swimming is ubiquitous in nature and crucial for the survival of a wide range of organisms. The physics of swimming at the viscosity-dominated microscale and inertia-dominated macroscale is well studied. However, in between lies a complicated mesoscale with swimmers affected by non-linear and time-dependent fluid mechanics. The intricate motility strategies, combined with complex and periodically changing body shapes add extra challenges for accurate meso-swimming modelling. Here, we have further developed the micropipette force sensor to directly probe the swimming forces of the meso-organism Artemia. Through deep neural network-based image analysis, we show how Artemia achieves an increased propulsive force by increasing its level of time-reversal symmetry breaking. We present a universal force-based scaling law for a wide range of micro- to meso-organisms with different body shapes, swimming strategies, and level of inertia at the mesoscale. These results capture fundamental aspects of biological meso-swimming dynamics and provide guidance for future biomimicking meso-robot designs.

Title: Thermal Analog Computing: Application to Matrix-vector Multiplication with Inverse-designed Metastructures
Authors: Caio Silva, Giuseppe Romano
Abstract: The rising computational demand of modern workloads has renewed interest in energy-efficient paradigms such as neuromorphic and analog computing. A fundamental operation in these systems is matrix-vector multiplication (MVM), ubiquitous in signal processing and machine learning. Here, we demonstrate MVM using inverse-designed metastructures that exploit heat conduction as the signal carrier. The proposed approach is based on a generalization of effective thermal conductivity to systems with multiple input and output ports: The input signal is encoded as a set of applied temperatures, while the output is represented by the power collected at designated terminals. The metastructures are obtained via density-based topology optimization, enabled by a differentiable thermal transport solver and automatic differentiation, achieving an accuracy $>99\%$ in most cases across a pool of matrices with dimensions $2\times2$ and $3\times3$. We apply this methodology -- termed thermal analog computing -- to realize matrices relevant to practical tasks, including the discrete Fourier transform and convolutional filters. These findings open new avenues for analog information processing in thermally active environments, including temperature-gradient sensing in microelectronics and thermal control systems.

Title: Q-ball mechanism of electron transport properties of high-T$_c$ superconductors
Authors: S. I. Mukhin
Abstract: A theory is presented of a mechanism of high-Tc superconductivity in cuprates, based on the fact that 'nested' fermionic states near the Fermi surface of electrons/holes cause instability with respect to formation of the Q-balls (nontopological solitons) of coherently condensed spin/charge density wave fluctuations (SDW/CDW) with the wave-vector that matches the 'nesting' one. Simultaneously, the 'nested' fermions form superconducting condensate of Cooper/local pairs inside the Q-balls, with Q-ball SDW/CDW field being a 'pairing glue'. Thus, Q-balls possess lower total energy with respect to not condensed thermal SDW/CDW fluctuations and form a Q-balls 'gas' via first order phase transition below a temperature T$^*$. Besides, superconducting condensates inside the Q-balls induce a spectral gap on the nested parts of the Fermi surface, thus creating pseudogap phase. The Q-ball semiclassical field breaks chiral symmetry along the Matsubara time axis in Euclidean space-time possessing conserved Noether "charge" Q that makes the Q-ball volume finite. Prediction of the Q-ball scenario in cuprates is supported by micro X-ray diffraction data in HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+y}$ in the pseudogap phase. The Q-balls of baryonic fields were originally predicted in Minkowski space-time by Sidney Coleman. In this paper it is demonstrated analytically that scattering of itinerant fermions on the Q-balls causes linear temperature dependence of electrical resistivity, that may explain famous 'Plankian' behavior in the 'strange metal' phase of high-Tc cuprates. Calculated diamagnetic response of Q-balls gas in the 'strange metal' phase and the phase diagram of high-Tc cuprates, with superconducting dome touching the 'strange metal' area at the optimal (holes)doping, are also in qualitative accord with experimental data.

Abstract: The stability of hydrogenated monolayer graphene was investigated via X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) for two different environmental conditions: ultra-high vacuum (UHV) and ambient pressure. The study is carried out by measuring the C 1s line shape evolution for two hydrogenated samples one kept in the UHV chamber and the other progressively exposed to air. In particular, the $sp^3$ relative intensity in the C 1s core-level spectrum, represented by the area ratio $\frac{sp^3}{sp^2+sp^3}$, was used as a marker for the hydrogenation-level. After four months in UHV, it resulted almost unchanged within the experimental uncertainty. Thus, a long-term stability of hydrogenated monolayer graphene was found, that indicates this material as a good candidate for hydrogen (or tritium) storage as long as it is kept in vacuum. On the other hand, the C 1s spectrum of the sample exposed to air shows a significant oxidation. A rapid growth up to saturation of the carbon oxides was observed with a time constant $\tau$ = 2.8 $\pm$ 1.2 hours. Finally, the re-exposure of the oxidised sample to atomic hydrogen was found to be an effective method for the recovery of hydrogenated graphene. The CH stretching mode was measured via electron energy loss spectroscopy as direct footprint of hydrogenated graphene recovery.

Title: Gapped Boundaries of Kitaev's Quantum Double Models: A Lattice Realization of Anyon Condensation from Lagrangian Algebras
Authors: Mu Li, Xiao-Han Yang, Xiao-Yu Dong
Abstract: The macroscopic theory of anyon condensation, rooted in the categorical structure of topological excitations, provides a complete classification of gapped boundaries in topologically ordered systems, where distinct boundaries correspond to the condensation of different Lagrangian algebras. However, an intrinsic and direct understanding of anyon condensation in lattice models, grounded in the framework of Lagrangian algebras, remains undeveloped. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework for constructing all gapped boundaries of Kitaev's quantum double models directly from the data of Lagrangian algebras. Central to our approach is the observation that bulk interactions in the quantum double models admit two complementary interpretations: the anyon-creating picture and the anyon-probing picture. Generalizing this insight to the boundary, we derive the consistency condition for boundary ribbon operators that respect the mathematical axiomatic structure of Lagrangian algebras. Solving these conditions yields explicit expressions for the local boundary interactions required to realize gapped boundaries. We also provide three families of solutions that cover a broad range of cases. Our construction provides a microscopic characterization of the bulk-to-boundary anyon condensation dynamics via the action of ribbon operators. Moreover, all these boundary terms are supported within a common effective Hilbert space, making further studies on pure boundary phase transitions natural and convenient. Given the broad applicability of anyon condensation theory, we believe that our approach can be generalized to planar topological codes, extended string-net models, or higher-dimensional topologically ordered systems.

Title: Towards Scalable Braiding: Topological Superconductivity Unlocked under Arbitrary Magnetic Field Directions in Curved Planar Josephson Junctions
Authors: Richang Huang, Yongliang Hu, Xianzhang Chen, Peng Yu, Siwei Tan, Igor Zutic, Tong Zhou
Abstract: The non-Abelian statistics of Majorana zero modes (MZMs) are central to fault-tolerant topological quantum computing. Planar Josephson junctions provide a particularly versatile platform for realizing robust topological superconductivity hosting MZMs over a broad parameter space. However, it is generally believed that such topological superconductivity is restricted to a narrow range of in-plane magnetic field orientations, posing a major obstacle to scalable and noncollinear junction-network architectures. Here, we uncover that the apparent suppression of MZMs under misaligned fields does not arise from the destruction of topological superconductivity itself, but instead originates from emergent shifted bulk states at other momenta that obscure the global excitation gap and MZMs. By introducing spatial modulations along the junction to scatter and gap out these bulk states, we restore a global topological gap and recover MZMs for arbitrary in-plane magnetic field orientations. Remarkably, such modulations can be naturally realized by transforming a straight junction into a curved geometry, rendering the topological gap robust against field misalignment and enabling MZMs survival in complex junction networks. Building on this robustness, we propose a scalable protocol for MZMs braiding and fusion using gate or superconducting-phase control, opening new routes toward scalable topological quantum computing.

Title: Nondestructive optomechanical detection scheme for Bose-Einstein condensates
Authors: Cisco Gooding, Cameron R. D. Bunney, Samin Tajik, Sebastian Erne, Steffen Biermann, Jörg Schmiedmayer, Jorma Louko, William G. Unruh, Silke Weinfurtner
Abstract: We present a two-tone heterodyne optical readout scheme to extract unequal-time density correlations along an arbitrary stationary interaction path from a pancake-shaped Bose-Einstein condensate, using a modulated laser probe. Analysing the measurement noise both from imprecision and backaction, we identify the standard quantum limit for the signal-extraction scheme, and examine how a class of two-mode squeezed initial states can be used to push beyond this limit. As an application, we show how the readout scheme can be used for an experimentally feasible realisation of acceleration-dependence of quantum-vacuum fluctuations in the system, including the analogue spacetime circular motion Unruh effect. The scheme is adaptable beyond Bose-Einstein condensates, providing nondestructive access to unequal-time correlations in quantum fluids.

Title: Bipartite entanglement and surface criticality: The extra contribution of non-ordinary edge in entanglement
Authors: Yanzhang Zhu, Zenan Liu, Zhe Wang, Yan-Cheng Wang, Zheng Yan
Abstract: Recent works on the scaling behaviors of entanglement entropy at the SO(5) deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) sparked a huge controversy. Different bipartitions gave out totally different conclusions for whether the DQCP is consistent with a unitary conformal field theory. In this work, we connect two previously disconnected fields -- the many-body entanglement and the surface criticality -- to reveal the behaviors of entanglement entropy in various bipartite scenarios, and point out that only the ordinary bipartition purely reflects the criticality of the bulk; otherwise, the extra gapless edge mode will also contribute to the entanglement. We have demonstrated that the correspondence between the entanglement spectrum and the edge energy spectrum still approximately persists even at a bulk-gapless point, thereby influencing the behavior of entanglement entropy. Our results establish that boundary conditions induced by the cut are decisive for entanglement-based probes and provide practical protocols to separate bulk from boundary contributions.

Title: Mid-infrared LEDs based on lattice-mismatched hybrid IV-VI/III-V heterojunctions
Authors: Jarod E. Meyer, Biridiana Rodriguez, Leland Nordin, Kunal Mukherjee
Abstract: Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) can bridge the gap between narrow linewidth, expensive lasers and broadband, inefficient thermal globars for low-cost chemical sensing in the mid-infrared (mid-IR). However, the efficiency of III-V based mid-IR LEDs at room temperature is low, primarily limited by strong nonradiative Auger-Meitner recombination that is only partially overcome with complex quantum-engineered active regions. Here, we exploit the intrinsically low Auger Meitner recombination rates of the IV-VI semiconductors PbSe and PbSnSe, while leveraging the mature III-V platform through the fabrication of hybrid heterojunctions that mediate the ~8% lattice mismatch to GaAs. Electrically injected n-PbSe/p-GaAs LEDs emit at 3.8 um with output powers up to 400 uW under pulsed operation and a peak wall plug efficiency of 0.08% at room temperature, approaching the performance of commercial III-V LEDs at similar wavelengths. Incorporating 7% Sn extends the emission to 5 um in GeSe/PbSnSe/GaAs LEDs with output powers up to 45 uW. Notably, both devices operate despite threading dislocation densities on the order of 1e9/cm^2, underscoring the potential of hybrid IV-VI/III-V heterojunction architectures. We show that combining the complementary advantages of IV-VI and III-V semiconductors offers a simple and efficient mid IR optoelectronic platform for a rapidly expanding set of applications.

Title: Comparative study of magnetic exchange parameters and magnon dispersions in NiO and MnO from first principles
Authors: Flaviano José dos Santos, Luca Binci, Guido Menichetti, Ruchika Mahajan, Nicola Marzari, Iurii Timrov
Abstract: Spin-wave excitations are fundamental to understanding the behavior of magnetic materials and hold promise for future information and communication technologies. Yet, modeling these accurately in transition-metal compounds remains challenging, starting from the self-interaction errors affecting localized and partially filled $d$-orbitals in density-functional theory (DFT) with (semi-)local functionals. In this work, we compare three advanced first-principles approaches for computing magnetic exchange parameters and magnon dispersions in NiO and MnO, all based on a common DFT+$U$ ground state with ab initio Hubbard $U$ values obtained from density-functional perturbation theory. Two methods extract exchange parameters directly: one via total-energy differences using the four-state mapping ($\Delta E$), and the other via the magnetic force theorem (MFT) using infinitesimal spin rotations. Magnon dispersions are then obtained from a Heisenberg Hamiltonian through linear spin-wave theory (LSWT). The third approach, time-dependent density-functional perturbation theory with $U$ (TDDFPT+$U$), yields magnon dispersions directly from the dynamical spin susceptibility, with exchange parameters fitted a posteriori, for comparison, via LSWT. Our results show that TDDFPT+$U$ and the Heisenberg model based on $\Delta E$-derived parameters align well with experimental neutron scattering data, whereas the MFT-based approach shows larger discrepancies, possibly due to some inherent approximations and limitations of the particular implementation used. This study benchmarks the accuracy of state-of-the-art first-principles techniques for spin-wave modeling and contributes to advancing reliable computational tools for the study and design of magnetic materials.

Title: Unified theory of classical and quantum ergotropy
Authors: Michele Campisi
Abstract: Quantifying the ergotropy (a.k.a. available energy), namely the maximal amount of energy that can be extracted from a thermally isolated system, is a central problem in quantum thermodynamics. Notably, the same problem has been long studied for classical systems as well, e.g. in plasma physics and astrophysics, where the basic principles for its solution are known for the case of collisionless fluids. Here we provide the general analytical expression of ergotropy of classical systems valid regardless of their size and the type of interparticle interactions, and show that it emerges as the classical limit of the quantum expression of ergotropy, for quantum systems that are classically ergodic. We thus establish a unified theory of classical and quantum ergotropy, whose applicability ranges from atomic to galactic scale. Such unified theory is indispensable for studying the genuine quantum signatures of ergotropy: We show that the celebrated decomposition of quantum ergotropy into coherent ant inchoherent parts survives in the classical regime, indicating that coherences do not necessarily reveal quantumness. The unified theory also allows to port tools and methods across the classical-quantum boundary to unlock the solution of standing problems. We apply this to swiftly solve the open problem of ergotropy extraction in the classical regime.

Title: Fabrication, characterization and mechanical loading of Si/SiGe membranes for spin qubit devices
Authors: Lucas Marcogliese, Ouviyan Sabapathy, Rudolf Richter, Jhih-Sian Tu, Dominique Bougeard, Lars R. Schreiber
Abstract: Si/SiGe heterostructures on bulk Si substrates have been shown to host high fidelity electron spin qubits. Building a scalable quantum processor would, however, benefit from further improvement of critical material properties such as the valley-splitting landscape. Flexible control of the strain field and the out-of-plane electric field $\mathcal{E}_z$ may be decisive for valley splitting enhancement in the presence of alloy disorder. We envision the Si/SiGe membrane as a versatile scientific platform for investigating intervalley scattering mechanisms which have thus far remained elusive in conventional Si/SiGe heterostructures and have the potential to yield favourable valley-splitting distributions. Here, we report the fabrication of locally etched, suspended SiGe/Si/SiGe membranes from two different heterostructures and apply the process to realize a spin-qubit shuttling device on a membrane for future valley mapping experiments. The membranes have a thickness in the micrometer range and can be metallized to form a back-gate contact for extended control over the electric field. To probe their elastic properties, the membranes are stressed by loading with a profilometer stylus at room temperature. We distinguish between linear elastic and buckling modes, each offering mechanisms through which strain can be coupled to spin qubits.

Title: Ab initio study of anomalous temperature dependence of resistivity in V-Al alloys
Authors: Gabor Csire, Oleg E. Peil
Abstract: V$_{1-x}$Al$_x$ is a representative example of highly resistive metallic alloys exhibiting a crossover to a negative temperature coefficient of resistivity (TCR), known as the Mooij correlation. Despite numerous proposals to explain this anomalous behavior,none have provided a satisfactory quantitative explanation thus far. In this work, we calculate the electrical conductivity using an ab initio methodology that combines the Kubo-Greenwood formalism with the coherent potential approximation (CPA). The temperature dependence of the conductivity is obtained within a CPA-based model of thermal atomic vibrations. Using this approach, we observe the crossover to the negative TCR behavior in V$_{1-x}$Al$_x$, with the temperature coefficient following the Mooij correlation, which matches experimental observations in the intermediate-to-high temperature range. Analysis of the results allows us to clearly identify a non-Boltzmann contribution responsible for this behavior and describe it as a function of temperature and composition.

Title: Holographic Aspects of Dynamical Mean-Field Theory
Authors: Kouichi Okunishi, Akihisa Koga
Abstract: Dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) is one of the most standard theoretical frameworks for addressing strongly correlated electron systems. Meanwhile, the concept of holography, developed in the field of quantum gravity, provides an intrinsic relationship between quantum many-body systems and space-time geometry. In this study, we demonstrate that these two theories are closely related to each other by shedding light on holographic aspects of DMFT, particularly for electrons with a semicircle density of states. We formulate a holographic renormalization group for the branch Green's function from the outer edge to the interior of the Bethe lattice network, and then find that its fixed point can be interpreted as a self-consistent solution of Green's function in DMFT. By introducing an effective two-dimensional anti-de Sitter space, moreover, we clarify that the scaling dimensions for the branch Green's function and the boundary correlation functions of electrons at the outer edge of the Bethe lattice network are characterized by the fixed-point Green's function. We also perform DMFT computations for the Bethe-lattice Hubbard model, which illustrate that the scaling dimensions capture the Mott transition in the deep interior.

Title: Detecting quantum spin liquid on Kitaev model through a superconducting junction
Authors: A. R. Moura, L. V. Santos
Abstract: The Kitaev model belongs to an unconventional class of two-dimensional spin systems characterized by anisotropic, bond-dependent interactions that give rise to Quantum Spin Liquid (QSL) states. These exotic phases, marked by the absence of magnetic ordering even at zero temperature, support fractionalized excitations and emergent gauge fields. A particularly compelling feature of the Kitaev model is its exact solvability, which reveals low-energy excitations in the form of itinerant Majorana fermions-quasiparticles that obey non-Abelian statistics and are of central interest in topological quantum computation due to their inherent robustness against local perturbations and decoherence. Despite extensive theoretical advancements, the experimental identification of QSLs remains challenging, as conventional magnetic probes fail to detect their defining properties. In this work, we present a theoretical investigation of spin current injection from a superconducting metal into a Kitaev quantum spin liquid. By employing a spintronic framework, we derive the dynamics of the injected spin current and demonstrate how its signatures can be traced back to the underlying Majorana excitations in the spin liquid phase. Superconductivity plays a pivotal role in this context, not only as a source of coherent quasiparticles but also as a platform with potential for interfacing with topological quantum devices. Our analysis contrasts the Kitaev-superconductor interface with conventional ferromagnetic junctions, where spin transport is carried by magnons, and highlights distinctive features in the spin current response. These findings open new directions for the detection of QSLs and contribute to the broader effort of integrating topological quantum materials into scalable quantum technologies.

Title: Impacting spheres: from liquid drops to elastic beads
Authors: Saumili Jana, John Kolinski, Detlef Lohse, Vatsal Sanjay
Abstract: A liquid drop impacting a non-wetting rigid substrate laterally spreads, then retracts, and finally jumps off again. An elastic solid, by contrast, undergoes a slight deformation, contacts briefly, and bounces. The impact force on the substrate - crucial for engineering and natural processes - is classically described by Wagner's (liquids) and Hertz's (solids) theories. This work bridges these limits by considering a generic viscoelastic medium. Using direct numerical simulations, we study a viscoelastic sphere impacting a rigid, non-contacting surface and quantify how the elasticity number ($El$, dimensionless elastic modulus) and the Weissenberg number ($Wi$, dimensionless relaxation time) dictate the impact force. We recover the Newtonian liquid response as either $El \to 0$ or $Wi \to 0$, and obtain elastic-solid behavior in the limit $Wi \to \infty$ and $El \ne 0$. In this elastic-memory limit, three regimes emerge - capillary-dominated, Wagner scaling, and Hertz scaling - with a smooth transition from the Wagner to the Hertz regime. Sweeping $Wi$ from 0 to $\infty$ reveals a continuous shift from materials with no memory to materials with permanent memory of deformation, providing an alternate, controlled route from liquid drops to elastic beads. The study unifies liquid and solid impact processes and offers a general framework for the liquid-to-elastic transition relevant across systems and applications.

Title: When Normality Tests Detect Equilibrium Distributions of Finite N-Body Systems
Authors: Jae Wan Shim
Abstract: The particle number $N$ can be used as a quantitative gauge of non-Gaussianity. This idea extends to systems that are not literally finite by assigning them a notional $N$ that captures the same deviation. For an ideal gas with \(N\) insufficiently large for the thermodynamic limit, the velocity distribution that maximises Havrda-Charvát entropy departs markedly from the Maxwell-Boltzmann (Gaussian) form obtained in that limit. We explore how five standard normality tests -- Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Anderson-Darling, Cramér--von Mises, Jarque-Bera and Shapiro-Wilk -- respond to samples drawn from this finite-$N$ equilibrium distribution. A large-scale Monte Carlo study maps the tests' statistical power across system size \(N\) and sample size \(n\), providing practical reference tables and a heuristic scaling law, visualised as a contour plot, that together indicate when finite-size effects remain detectable.

Title: Ultrafast Terahertz Photoconductivity and Near-Field Imaging of Nanoscale Inhomogeneities in Multilayer Epitaxial Graphene Nanoribbons
Authors: Arvind Singh, Jan Kunc, Tinkara Troha, Hynek Němec, Petr Kužel
Abstract: We study broadband terahertz (THz) conductivity and ultrafast photoconductivity spectra in lithographically fabricated multilayer epitaxial graphene nanoribbons grown on C- face of 6H-SiC substrate. THz near-field spectroscopy reveals local conductivity variations across nanoscale structural inhomogeneities such as wrinkles and grain boundaries within the multilayer graphene. Ultrabroadband THz far-field spectroscopy (0.15-16 THz) distinguishes doped graphene layers near the substrate from quasi-neutral layers (QNLs) further from the substrate. Temperature-dependent THz conductivity spectra are dominated by intra-band transitions both in the doped and QNLs. Photoexcitation then alters mainly the response of the QNLs: these exhibit a very high carrier mobility and a large positive THz photoconductivity with picosecond lifetime. The response of QNLs strongly depends on the carrier temperature $T_c$: the scattering time drops by an order of magnitude down to ~10 fs upon an increase of $T_c$ from 50 K to $T_c >$ 1000 K, which is attributed to an enhanced electron-electron and electron-phonon scattering and to an interaction of electrons with mid-gap states.

Title: Numerical analysis of heat transport in classical one-dimensional systems
Authors: Antonio Politi
Abstract: Numerical studies of some unidimensional systems suggest that Fourier law is satisfied, where theory predicts a divergence of heat conductivity with the system size. Here, I revisit some such models, finding that in all cases a divergence asymptotically emerges. This includes a variant of the ding-a-ling model, where I find that, contrary to previous claims, the ``anomalous" growth starts already for moderate system sizes. More conceptually interesting is the case of non-binding potentials, whose behavior is well reproduced by assuming that the energy flux across the nonequilibrium stationary state is the sum of two contributions: a diffusive and a hydrodynamic one. This approach, which extends an idea previously formulated for nearly integrable systems, allows to conclude that the asymptotic regime is always dominated by the anomalous hydrodynamic component, but the crossover may occur for extremely long system sizes.

Title: Quantum geometry and $X$-wave magnets with $X=p,d,f,g,i$
Authors: Motohiko Ezawa
Abstract: Quantum geometry is a differential geometry based on quantum mechanics. It is related to various transport and optical properties in condensed matter physics. The Zeeman quantum geometry is a generalization of quantum geometry including the spin degrees of freedom. It is related to electromagnetic cross responses. Quantum geometry is generalized to non-Hermitian systems and density matrices. Especially, the latter is quantum information geometry, where the quantum Fisher information naturally arises as quantum metric. We apply these results to the $X$-wave magnets, which include $d$% -wave, $g$-wave and $i$-wave altermagnets as well as $p$-wave and $f$-wave magnets. They have universal physics for anomalous Hall conductivity, tunneling magneto-resistance and planar Hall effect. We also study magneto-optical conductivity, magnetic circular dichroism and Friedel oscillations in the $X$-wave magnets. Various analytic formulas are derived in the case of two-band Hamiltonians. This paper presents a review of recent progress together with some original results.

Title: Real-Time Dynamics in Two Dimensions with Tensor Network States via Time-Dependent Variational Monte Carlo
Authors: Yantao Wu, Jannes Nys
Abstract: Reliably simulating two-dimensional many-body quantum dynamics with projected entangled pair states (PEPS) has long been a difficult challenge. In this work, we overcome this barrier for low-energy quantum dynamics by developing a stable and efficient time-dependent variational Monte Carlo (tVMC) framework for PEPS. By analytically removing all gauge redundancies of the PEPS manifold and exploiting tensor locality, we obtain a numerically well-conditioned stochastic reconfiguration (SR) equation amenable to robust solution using the efficient Cholesky decomposition, enabling long-time evolution in previously inaccessible regimes. We demonstrate the power and generality of the method through four representative real-time problems in two dimensions: (I) chiral edge propagation in a free-fermion Chern insulator; (II) fractionalized charge transport in a fractional Chern insulator; (III) vison confinement dynamics in the Higgs phase of a Z2 lattice gauge theory; and (IV) superfluidity and critical velocity in interacting bosons. All simulations are performed on 12x12 or 13x13 lattices with evolution times T = 10 to 12 using modest computational resources (1 to 5 days on a single GPU card). Where exact benchmarks exist (case I), PEPS-tVMC matches free-fermion dynamics with high accuracy up to T = 12. These results establish PEPS-tVMC as a practical and versatile tool for real-time quantum dynamics in two dimensions. The method extends the reach of classical tensor-network simulations for studying elementary excitations in quantum many-body systems and provides a valuable computational counterpart to emerging quantum simulators.

Title: Alteraxial Phonons in Collinear Magnets
Authors: Fuyi Wang, Junqi Xu, Xinqi Liu, Huaiqiang Wang, Lifa Zhang, Haijun Zhang
Abstract: Axial phonons, carrying angular momentum through rotational lattice vibrations, offer a promising platform for exploring phonon-magnetic coupling effects. However, how the interplay of lattice and magnetism determine the phonon angular momentum (PAM) of axial phonons remains elusive. Here, based on magnetic point group theory, we establish a symmetry framework to classify phonons in collinear magnets (e.g. ferromagnets, antiferromangets, altermagnets) into three distinct categories: ferroaxial, antiferro-nonaxial, and alteraxial phonons, which are distinguished by their different PAM patterns. Beyond the ferroaxial phonons featuring $s$-wave PAM, we reveal a complete series of alteraxial phonons, characterized by higher-order-wave PAM patterns ranging from $p$- to $j$-wave. Notably, alteraxial phonons are not limited to altermagnets, but also emerge in ferromagnets and antiferromagets. Our high-throughput search predicts hundreds of candidate magnetic materials hosting alteraxial phonons. Ab initio calculations on representative magnets further confirm the existence and distinct symmetry-enforced nodal structures of PAM in alteraxial phonons. Our work provides a complete classification for axial phonons in collinear magnetic systems and paves the way for engineering magneto-phononic phenomena.

Title: Diffusion and relaxation of topological excitations in layered spin liquids
Authors: Aprem P. Joy, Roman Lange, Achim Rosch
Abstract: Relaxation processes in topological phases such as quantum spin liquids are controlled by the dynamics and interaction of fractionalized excitations. In layered materials hosting two-dimensional topological phases, elementary quasiparticles can diffuse freely within the layer, whereas only pairs (or more) can hop between layers - a fundamental consequence of topological order. Using exact solutions of emergent nonlinear diffusion equations and particle-based stochastic simulations, we explore how pump-probe experiments can provide unique signatures of the presence of $2d$ topological excitations in a $3d$ material. Here we show that the characteristic time scale of such experiments is inversely proportional to the initial excitation density, set by the pump intensity. A uniform excitation density created on the surface of a sample spreads subdiffusively into the bulk with a mean depth $\bar z$ scaling as $\sim t^{1/3}$ when annihilation processes are absent. The propagation becomes logarithmic, $\bar z \sim \log t$, when pair-annihilation is allowed. Furthermore, pair-diffusion between layers leads to a new decay law for the total density, $n(t) \sim (\log^2 t)/t$ - slower than in a purely $2d$ system. We discuss possible experimental implications for pump-probe experiments in samples of finite width.

Title: Unidirectional magnetoresistance driven by nonequilibrium antiferromagnetic magnons
Authors: Xue He, Hans Gløckner Giil, Caiqiong Xu, Jicheng Wang, Arne Brataas, Jinbo Yang, Yanglong Hou, Rui Wu, Shilei Ding
Abstract: Magnetoresistive effects are typically symmetric under magnetization reversal. However, nonlinear spin transport can give rise to unidirectional magnetoresistance in systems with strong spin-orbit interaction and broken inversion symmetry. Here, we demonstrate that the nonequilibrium magnon accumulation characterized by a finite magnon chemical potential can lead to a large and robust magnonic unidirectional spin Hall magnetoresistance (USMR) in the weakly coupled van der Waals antiferromagnet CrPS4 in contact with Pt. Unlike conventional magnonic USMR driven by magnetization fluctuations, this effect persists under strong magnetic fields and low temperatures, with a pronounced peak near the spin-flip transition. The magnitude of magnonic USMR in CrPS4/Pt exceeds that of YIG/Pt by more than two orders of magnitude and surpasses the electrical USMR in metallic Ta/Co bilayers by a factor of two. The observed field and temperature dependence indicates that spin transport is dominated by magnon chemical potential gradients rather than thermal- or fluctuation-driven magnon generation. These findings establish a new mechanism for nonlinear magnetoresistance in antiferromagnetic van der Waals heterostructures and open a route to magnon-based antiferromagnetic spintronic functionalities in two-terminal device geometries.

Title: Quantum Entanglement of Anyonic Charges and Emergent Spacetime Geometry
Authors: Hoang-Anh Le, Hyun Cheol Lee, S.-R. Eric Yang
Abstract: Intrinsically topologically ordered phases can host anyons. Here, we take the view that entanglement between anyons can give rise to an emergent geometry resembling Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space. We analyze the entanglement structure of fractionalized anyons using mutual information and interpret the results within this emergent geometric framework. As a concrete example, we consider pairs of $e/2$-charged semions that arise from instanton configurations in a disordered zigzag graphene nanoribbon. These fractional charges, located on opposite zigzag edges, show long-range quantum entanglement despite being spatially separated. We analyze the scale dependence of their entanglement and embed the ribbon into an AdS-like bulk geometry. In this setup, the entanglement structure defines minimal surfaces in the bulk, providing a geometric view of the edge correlations. This gives a holographic picture of fractionalized degrees of freedom in quasi-one-dimensional systems and shows how quantum entanglement can generate emergent geometry even without conformal symmetry.

Title: Fractional Chern insulator with higher Chern number in optical lattice
Authors: Ying-Xing Ding, Wen-Tong Li, Li-Min Zhang, Yu-Biao Wu, Duanlu Zhou, Lin Zhuang, Wu-Ming Liu
Abstract: Fractional Chern insulators arise in topologically nontrivial flat bands, characterized by an integer Chern number C that corresponds to the number of dissipationless edge states in the non-interacting regime. Higher Chern numbers can replicate the physics of higher Landau levels and often confer enhanced topological robustness. However, realizing correlated fractional phases with higher Chern numbers in such flat band systems remains challenging. Here, we propose an interlayer coupling scheme to generate higher Chern numbers in a flat-band system, where the interlayer coupling transforms two C = 1 bands in a bilayer checkerboard lattice into a single flat band with C = 2 by lifting their degeneracy and merging their topological indices. Exact diagonalization calculation reveals that this engineered band hosts two fractional Chern insulator states with C = 2/3 and 2/5, respectively. An experimental setup is proposed to simulate these states using cold alkaline-earth-like atoms in an effective bilayer optical lattice. Our work provides a general and widely applicable strategy for constructing higher Chern number flat bands, opening a pathway to explore exotic fractional quantum phases.

Title: Spin Response of a Magnetic Monopole and Quantum Hall Response in Topological Lattice Models through Local Invariants and Light
Authors: Karyn Le Hur, Andrea Baldanza
Abstract: Here, we elaborate on and develop the geometrical approach introduced in K. Le Hur, Physics Reports 1104 1-42 (2025) between the magnetic monopole created from a radial field, quantum physics and topological lattice models through quantum phase transitions. We introduce an effective magnetic moment for a monopole when applying an additional source field along z-direction which also mediates the quantum phase transition. We present its relation with the transverse pumped quantum Hall current. The magnetic susceptibility can be introduced as a measure of the topological invariant i.e. it remains quantized within the topological phase until the transition. We show the relation with two-dimensional topological lattice models such as a honeycomb Haldane model in real space. We develop the theory and present a numerical analysis between local invariants in momentum space introduced from Dirac points, correlation functions and the responses to circularly polarized light. We develop the formalism for coupled-planes materials including the possibility of quantum spin Hall effect and address a relation between the Ramanujan infinite alternating series and an interface in real space with a topological number one-half.

Title: Active-Absorbing Phase Transitions in the Parallel Minority Game
Authors: Aryan Tyagi, Soumyajyoti Biswas, Anirban Chakraborti
Abstract: The Parallel Minority Game (PMG) is a synchronous adaptive multi-agent model that exhibits active-absorbing transitions characteristic of non-equilibrium statistical systems. We perform a comprehensive numerical study of the PMG under two families of microscopic decision rules: (i) agents update their choices based on instantaneous population in their alternative choices, and (ii) threshold-based activation that activates agents movement only after overcrowding density crossing a threshold. We measure time-dependent and steady state limits of activity $A(t)$, overcrowding fraction $F(t)$ as functions of the control parameter $g=N/D$, where $N$ is the number of agents and $D$ is the total number of sites. Instantaneous rules display mean-field directed-percolation (MF-DP) scaling with $\beta\approx1.00$, $\delta\approx0.5$, and $\nu_{\parallel}\approx2.0$. Threshold rules, however, produce a distinct non-mean-field universality class with $\beta\approx0.75$ and a systematic failure of dynamical scaling. We show that thresholding acts as a relevant perturbation to the critical behavior of the model. The results highlight how minimal cognitive features at the agent level fundamentally alter large-scale critical behavior in socio-economic and active systems.

Title: Gap solitons of the Wannier and Bloch types in spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensates with a moiré lattice
Authors: Jun-Tao He, Xue-Ping Cheng, Xin-Wei Jin, Hui-Jun Li, Ji Lin, Boris A. Malomed
Abstract: Gap solitons (GSs) bifurcating from flat bands, which may be represented in terms of Wannier functions, have garnered significant interest due to their strong localization with extremely small norms. Moiré lattices (MLs), with multiple flat bands, offer an appropriate platform for creating such solitons. We explore the formation mechanism and stability of GSs in spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates under the combined action of the Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and an ML potential. We identify five Wannier-type GS families bifurcating from the lowest five energy bands in the spectrum induced by the ML with sufficiently large period and depth. These fundamental GSs serve as basic elements for constructing more complex Wannier-type GS states. Reducing the lattice period and depth triggers a transition from the Wannier-type GSs to ones of the Bloch type, the latter exhibiting higher norm thresholds and pronounced spatial broadening near edges of the energy bands. In addition to tuning the lattice-potential parameters, adjusting the SOC strength can also modulate the flatness of energy bands and enhance the localization of gap solitons, enabling reversible transitions between the GSs of the Wannier and Bloch types. Distinctive properties of GSs in the quasiperiodic ML are uncovered too. Thus, we propose the theoretical foundation for the creation of and manipulations with strongly localized GSs.

Title: Two-Point Stabilizer Rényi Entropy: a Computable Magic Proxy of Interacting Fermions
Authors: Jun Qi Fang, Fo-Hong Wang, Xiao Yan Xu
Abstract: Quantifying non-stabilizerness (``magic'') in interacting fermionic systems remains a formidable challenge, particularly for extracting high order correlations from quantum Monte Carlo simulations. In this Letter, we establish the two-point stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE) and its mutual counterpart as robust, computationally accessible probes for detecting magic in diverse fermionic phases. By deriving local estimators suitable for advanced numerical methods, we demonstrate that these metrics effectively characterize quantum phase transitions: in the one-dimensional spinless $t$-$V$ model, they sharply identify the Luttinger liquid to charge density wave transition, while in the two-dimensional honeycomb lattice via determinant quantum Monte Carlo, they faithfully capture the critical exponents of the Gross-Neveu-Ising universality class. Furthermore, extending our analysis to the fractional quantum Hall regime, we unveil a non-trivial spatial texture of magic in the Laughlin state, revealing signatures of short-range exclusion correlations. Our results validate the two-point SRE as a versatile and sensitive diagnostic, forging a novel link between quantum resource theory, critical phenomena, and topological order in strongly correlated matter.

Title: Altermagnets versus Antiferromagnets
Authors: V.P.Mineev
Abstract: Altermagnets are metals with a momentum-dependent spin splitting of electron bands due to a specific crystal structure, which is invariant under time reversal only in combination with rotations and reflections. The developed phenomenological approach makes it possible to obtain a spectrum of electron bands in an altermagnet corresponding to an antiferromagnet with the same symmetry. The anomalous Hall effect is an inherent property of substances whose electron band dispersion is characterized by the Berry curvature. Calculations of the Berry curvature were performed for altermagnet analogs of collinear antiferromagnet, weak ferromagnetic antiferromagnet, and ferrimagnetic structures. It was shown that in the specific cases under consideration, the anomalous Hall effect in the absence of an external magnetic field is possible only in the state of a weak ferromagnet.

Title: Demonstration of a Field-Effect Three-Terminal Electronic Device with an Electron Mobility Exceeding 40 Million cm^2/(Vs)
Authors: T. J. Martz-Oberlander, B. Bulgaru, Z. Berkson-Korenberg, Q. Hawkins, K.W. West, K.W. Baldwin, A. Gupta, L. N. Pfeiffer, G. Gervais
Abstract: We report the fabrication and operation of a source-drain-gate three-terminal field-effect electronic device with an electron mobility exceeding $40\times 10^6$ cm$^2$ / (Vs). Several devices were fabricated, with the highest achieved electron mobility obtained using a symmetrically-doped GaAs/AlGaAs quantum well forming a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) with a density of $1.47(1) \times 10^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$ and a pristine, pre-fabrication electron mobility of $44(2) \times 10^6$ cm$^2$/(\text{Vs}). To circumvent the well-known degradation of electron mobility during fabrication, devices were fabricated using a flip-chip technique where all lithographic processing steps were performed on a separate sapphire substrate. This method demonstrates the successful operation of various gate assembly designs on distinct 2DEGs without observable mobility degradation. This advance doubles the previous record for field-effect electronic device mobility and enables access to new regimes of quantum transport and applications that were previously unfathomable due to mobility limitations.

Title: Materials design based on a material-motif network and heterogeneous graphs
Authors: Anoj Aryal, Weiyi Gong, Huta Banjade, Qimin Yan
Abstract: Machine learning models for functional materials design require precise and informative representations of material systems. Common representations encode atomic composition and bonding but often do not include local coordination environments across chemically diverse crystals. Recurring structural motifs provide a motif level description of crystalline solids and can serve as interpretable descriptors for structure property learning. To analyze the motif connectivity in materials, we construct a bipartite material motif network from 131,548 Materials Project entries, with materials and motifs as the two node sets. Edges connect materials to their constituent motifs and are weighted by motif distortion, which quantifies the strength of each material motif association. Network connectivity is analyzed to identify motif-defined material clusters that capture recurring local geometries relevant to structure property trends. Most shared motifs act as hubs that connect otherwise disconnected regions of the network, enabling motif guided screening by expanding from known motifs to nearby materials in the same neighborhoods. A network embedding step converts this weighted connectivity into vector representations of materials. Using these motif informed embeddings, property prediction yields a formation energy mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.157 eV per atom and a bandgap MAE of 0.601 eV. These results indicate that motif connectivity provides a compact, interpretable representation that complements existing descriptors for scalable screening and structure property modeling.

Title: Magnetic Signatures of a Putative Fractional Topological Insulator in Twisted MoTe2
Authors: Yiping Wang, Gillian E. Minarik, Weijie Li, Yves Kwan, Shuai Yuan, Eric Anderson, Chaowei Hu, Julian Ingham, Jeongheon Choe, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Xavier Roy, Jiun-Haw Chu, Raquel Queiroz, James C. Hone, N. Regnault, Xiaodong Xu, Xiaoyang Zhu
Abstract: The interplay among electronic correlation, topology, and time-reversal-symmetry (TRS) often leads to exotic quantum states of matter. Primary examples include the recently realized fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) in twisted MoTe2 bilayers (tMoTe2) and multilayer graphene aligned with hBN, where TRS is broken in partially filled flat moire Chern bands. Among the FCIs in tMoTe2, the most robust is at a hole filling of v = -2/3 per moire unit cell. Interestingly, transient optical sensing and more recent transport measurements revealed a correlated state at v = -4/3, twice the filling factor for the v = -2/3 FCI. Here, employing pump-probe circular dichroism (CD) measurements on tMoTe2 with twist angles = 3.9 degree and 3.7 degree, we find that the v = -4/3 state exhibits vanishing magnetization (m = 0) in finite windows of out-of-plane magnetic field less than ~2-4 mT, and a first order phase transition to + - m states at higher fields. This out-of-plane antiferromagnetic (AFM) like behavior is notably absent for all other correlated states and disappears for the v = -4/3 state at higher or lower twist angles = 4.0 degree and 3.3 degree. The observed magnetic signature at v = -4/3 is consistent with a predicted fractional topological insulator (FTI) with TRS, consisting of two copies of -2/3 FCIs with opposite chiralities. We support these findings with calculations in the interacting continuum model of tMoTe2. Our work presents a candidate for fractional topological insulators with TRS.

Title: Moiré magnetism in a bilayer Ising model
Authors: Ryan Flynn, Anders W. Sandvik
Abstract: Moiré patterns in magnetic bilayers generate spatially modulated interlayer exchange interactions that can give rise to nonuniform magnetic textures. We study a minimal classical bilayer Ising model with a moiré-modulated interlayer coupling, generated either by relative twist or differential strain between the layers. Using large-scale classical Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the ordering transition remains in the conventional two-dimensional Ising universality class, even when the low-temperature state is domain-textured. At low temperatures, we find a smooth crossover between a uniform ferromagnet and domain-textured state, in which the spins locally follow the sign of the interlayer exchange. We demonstrate that there is no breaking of layer symmetry for twisted bilayers. The location of the crossover is determined by a simple geometric energy balance between bulk interlayer exchange and intralayer domain-wall costs. Our results provide a minimal framework for understanding how moiré-modulated magnetic textures can emerge from geometric energetics without requiring a thermodynamic phase transition.

Title: Topological hybridisation of plasmons with ferrimagnetic magnons
Authors: Cooper Finnigan, Mehdi Kargarian, Dmitry K. Efimkin
Abstract: We study the formation of hybrid plasmon-magnon modes in a heterostructure comprising a monolayer semiconductor with strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling -- specifically, Janus transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) -- and an insulating ferrimagnet, such as yttrium iron garnet-based compounds. Using a combined microscopic-macroscopic framework for plasmon-magnon coupling, we show that plasmons and magnons strongly hybridize over both GHz and THz frequency ranges, enabling experimental access well above cryogenic temperatures. Moreover, the developed approach provides an efficient and natural classification of the topology of the hybrid modes, rooted in the phase winding of the plasmon-magnon coupling induced by spin-momentum locking and the associated chiral winding of the electronic spin along the Fermi contours. Finally, we identify experimentally accessible manifestations of the hybridization, such as topological interface modes and an anomalous thermal Hall response.

Title: Bosonic phases across the superconductor-insulator transition in infinite-layer samarium nickelate

Abstract: Superconductivity arises from the global phase coherence of Cooper pairs. Modulation of phase coherence leads to quantum phase transitions, serving as an important tool for studying unconventional superconductivity. Here, we demonstrate bosonic phases across the superconductor-insulator transition in infinite-layer nickelate superconducting films by the control of spatially periodic network patterns. Magnetoresistance oscillations with a periodicity of h/2e provide direct evidence of 2e Cooper pairing in nickelates. The phase transition is predominantly driven by enhanced superconducting fluctuations, and Cooper pairs are involved in charge transport across the transition. Notably, we observe two types of anomalous metallic phases, emerging respectively at finite magnetic fields and down to zero magnetic field. They can be characterized by bosonic excitations, suggesting the dynamic roles of vortices in the ground states. Our work establishes nickelates as a key platform for investigating the rich landscape of bosonic phases controlled via the phase coherence of Cooper pairs.

Title: Fundamental Relations as the Leading Order in Nonlinear Thermoelectric Responses with Time-Reversal Symmetry
Authors: Ying-Fei Zhang, Zhi-Fan Zhang, Hua Jiang, Zhen-Gang Zhu, Gang Su
Abstract: In recent years, nonlinear transport phenomena have garnered significant interest in both theoretical explorations and experiments. In this work, we utilize the semi-classical wave packet theory to calculate disorder-induced second-order transport coefficients: second-order electrical ($\sigma$), thermoelectric ($\alpha$), and thermal ($\kappa$) coefficients, capturing the interplay between side-jump and skew-scattering contributions in systems with time-reversal symmetry. Using a topological insulator model, we quantitatively characterize the Fermi-level dependence of these second-order transport coefficients by explicitly including Coulomb impurity potentials. Furthermore, we elucidate the relationships between these coefficients, establishing the second-order Mott relation and the Wiedemann-Franz law induced by disorder. This study develops a comprehensive theoretical framework elucidating the nonlinear thermoelectric transport mechanisms in quantum material systems.

Title: Non-invertible symmetries of two-dimensional Non-Linear Sigma Models
Authors: Guillermo Arias-Tamargo, Chris Hull, Maxwell L. Velásquez Cotini Hutt
Abstract: Global symmetries can be generalised to transformations generated by topological operators, including cases in which the topological operator does not have an inverse. A family of such topological operators are intimately related to dualities via the procedure of half-space gauging. In this work we discuss the construction of non-invertible defects based on T-duality in two dimensions, generalising the well-known case of the free compact boson to any Non-Linear Sigma Model with Wess-Zumino term which is T-dualisable. This requires that the target space has an isometry with compact orbits that acts without fixed points. Our approach allows us to include target spaces without non-trivial 1-cycles, does not require the NLSM to be conformal, and when it is conformal it does not need to be rational; moreover, it highlights the microscopic origin of the topological terms that are responsible for the non-invertibility of the defect. An interesting class of examples are Wess-Zumino-Witten models, which are self-dual under a discrete gauging of a subgroup of the isometry symmetry and so host a topological defect line with Tambara-Yamagami fusion. Along the way, we discuss how the usual 0-form symmetries match across T-dual models in target spaces without 1-cycles, and how global obstructions can prevent locally conserved currents from giving rise to topological operators.

Title: Connectivity determines the capability of sparse neural network quantum states
Authors: Brandon Barton, Juan Carrasquilla, Christopher Roth, Agnes Valenti
Abstract: The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) posits that within overparametrized neural networks, there exist sparse subnetworks that are capable of matching the performance of the original model when trained in isolation from the original initialization. We extend this hypothesis to the unsupervised task of approximating the ground state of quantum many-body Hamiltonians, a problem equivalent to finding a neural-network compression of the lowest-lying eigenvector of an exponentially large matrix. Focusing on two representative quantum Hamiltonians, the transverse field Ising model (TFIM) and the toric code (TC), we demonstrate that sparse neural networks can reach accuracies comparable to their dense counterparts, even when pruned by more than an order of magnitude in parameter count. Crucially, and unlike the original LTH, we find that performance depends only on the structure of the sparse subnetwork, not on the specific initialization, when trained in isolation. Moreover, we identify universal scaling behavior that persists across network sizes and physical models, where the boundaries of scaling regions are determined by the underlying Hamiltonian. At the onset of high-error scaling, we observe signatures of a sparsity-induced quantum phase transition that is first-order in shallow networks. Finally, we demonstrate that pruning enhances interpretability by linking the structure of sparse subnetworks to the underlying physics of the Hamiltonian.

Title: AiiDA-TrainsPot: Towards automated training of neural-network interatomic potentials
Authors: Davide Bidoggia, Nataliia Manko, Maria Peressi, Antimo Marrazzo
Abstract: Crafting neural-network interatomic potentials (NNIPs) remains a complex task, demanding specialized expertise in both machine learning and electronic-structure calculations. Here, we introduce AiiDA-TrainsPot, an automated, open-source, and user-friendly workflow that streamlines the creation of accurate NNIPs by orchestrating density-functional-theory calculations, data augmentation strategies, and classical molecular dynamics. Our active-learning strategy leverages on-the-fly calibration of committee disagreement against ab initio reference errors to ensure reliable uncertainty estimates. We use electronic-structure descriptors and dimensionality reduction to analyze the efficiency of this calibrated criterion, and show that it minimizes both false positives and false negatives when deciding what to compute from first principles. AiiDA-TrainsPot has a modular design that supports multiple NNIP backends, enabling both the training of NNIPs from scratch and the fine-tuning of foundation models. We demonstrate its capabilities through automated training campaigns targeting pristine and defective carbon allotropes, including amorphous carbon, as well as structural phase transitions in monolayer $\mathrm{W_xMo_{1-x}Te_2}$ alloys.

Title: Analytically Continuing the Randomized Measurement Toolbox
Authors: Akash Vijay, Ayush Raj, Jonah Kudler-Flam, Benoît Vermersch, Andreas Elben, Laimei Nie
Abstract: We develop a framework for extracting non-polynomial analytic functions of density matrices in randomized measurement experiments by a method of analytical continuation. A central advantage of this approach, dubbed stabilized analytic continuation (SAC), is its robustness to statistical noise arising from finite repetitions of a quantum experiment, making it well-suited to realistic quantum hardware. As a demonstration, we use SAC to estimate the von Neumann entanglement entropy of a numerically simulated quenched Néel state from Rényi entropies estimated via the randomized measurement protocol. We then apply the method to experimental Rényi data from a trapped-ion quantum simulator, extracting subsystem von Neumann entropies at different evolution times. Finally, we briefly note that the SAC framework is readily generalizable to obtain other nonlinear diagnostics, such as the logarithmic negativity and Rényi relative entropies.

Title: Orthogonal Attosecond Control of Solid-State Harmonics by Optical Waveforms and Quantum Geometry Engineering
Authors: Zhenjiang Zhao, Zhihua Zheng, Zhiyi Xu, Xing Ran, Xiaolong Yao, Fangping Ouyang
Abstract: High-harmonic generation (HHG) in two-dimensional materials offers a compelling route toward compact extreme ultraviolet sources and probing electron dynamics on the attosecond scale. However, achieving precise control over the emission and disentangling the complex interplay between intraband and interband quantum pathways remains a central challenge. Here, we demonstrate through first-principles simulations that HHG in monolayer WS2 can be subjected to precise, complementary control by combining all-optical two-color laser fields with mechanical strain engineering. This dual-mode strategy provides distinct, orthogonal control over harmonic yield, polarization, and spectral features. We reveal that sculpting the two-color field's relative phase provides a sub-femtosecond switch for the quantum coherence of electron-hole pairs, thereby optimizing harmonic emission. Crucially, we uncover that tensile strain modulates the total harmonic yield and specifically amplifies the perpendicular harmonic component by nearly a factor of two. This enhancement arises through a dual mechanism - while strain-modified band dispersion enhances the intraband current, a significant reshaping of the Berry curvature (BC) substantially increases the anomalous velocity contribution to the interband response. This quantum geometric effect manifests as a robust, monotonic dependence of the harmonic yield on strain and a significant amplification of the perpendicularly polarized harmonics, providing a clear experimental signature for probing quantum geometric effects. Our findings establish a versatile framework for optimizing solid-state HHG and introduce a powerful all-optical method to map strain and quantum geometric properties of materials, positioning monolayer WS2 as a model system for exploring attosecond physics at the nexus of bulk and atomic scales.

Title: Concentrated Monte Carlo sampling for local observables in quantum spin chains
Authors: Wenxuan Zhang, Dingzu Wang, Dario Poletti
Abstract: Monte Carlo methods are widely used to estimate observables in many-body quantum systems. However, conventional sampling schemes often require a large number of samples to achieve sufficient accuracy. In this work we propose the concentrated Monte Carlo sampling approach, which builds on the idea that in systems with only short range correlations, to obtain accurate expectation values for local observables, one would favor detailed information in the surroundings of this observable compared to far away from it. In this approach we consider all possible configurations in the surroundings of a local observable, and unique samples from the remaining of the setup drawn using Markov chain Monte Carlo. We have tested the performance of this approach for ground states of the spin-1/2 tilted Ising model in different phases, and also for thermal states in the a spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic model. Our results demonstrate that CMCS yields higher accuracy for local observables in short-range correlated states while requiring substantially fewer samples, showcasing in which regimes one can obtain acceleration for the evaluation of expectation values.

Title: Nonlinear skin breathing modes in one-dimensional nonreciprocal mechanical lattices
Authors: Bertin Many Manda
Abstract: We investigate the interplay of nonreciprocity and nonlinearity in a one-dimensional nonlinear Klein-Gordon chain of classical oscillators coupled by asymmetric springs, akin to a mechanical analogue of the Hatano-Nelson model with onsite nonlinearity. Using multiple-scale analysis, we show that families of nonlinear skin breathing modes -- time-periodic, boundary-localized oscillations -- emerge from their linear counterparts at any nonreciprocal strength. We derive an explicit nonlinear frequency shift for these families of nonlinear breathing modes, showing its dependence on amplitude, nonlinearity type, lattice size, and nonreciprocity, and we predict the emergence of genuine skin end breathers at the boundary once their oscillation frequency and higher harmonics enter the spectral gaps of the linear spectrum. Numerical pseudo-arclength continuation confirms full families of solutions for both hardening and softening nonlinearities. Furthermore, the Floquet analysis shows that these modes can be either linearly stable or unstable, with Floquet eigenvectors exhibiting skin localization inherited from the asymmetric couplings. Our results extend the nonlinear non-Hermitian skin effect from stationary modes to intrinsically time-periodic excitations, providing a pathway to engineer and control breathing modes in nonreciprocal mechanical metamaterials.

Title: CASCADE: Cumulative Agentic Skill Creation through Autonomous Development and Evolution
Authors: Xu Huang, Junwu Chen, Yuxing Fei, Zhuohan Li, Philippe Schwaller, Gerbrand Ceder
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents currently depend on predefined tools or early-stage tool generation, limiting their adaptability and scalability to complex scientific tasks. We introduce CASCADE, a self-evolving agentic framework representing an early instantiation of the transition from "LLM + tool use" to "LLM + skill acquisition". CASCADE enables agents to master complex external tools and codify knowledge through two meta-skills: continuous learning via web search, code extraction, and memory utilization; self-reflection via introspection, knowledge graph exploration, and others. We evaluate CASCADE on SciSkillBench, a benchmark of 116 materials science and chemistry research tasks. CASCADE achieves a 93.3% success rate using GPT-5, compared to 35.4% without evolution mechanisms. We further demonstrate real-world applications in computational analysis, autonomous laboratory experiments, and selective reproduction of published papers. Along with human-agent collaboration and memory consolidation, CASCADE accumulates executable skills that can be shared across agents and scientists, moving toward scalable AI-assisted scientific research.

Title: Scalable Spin Squeezing in Power-Law Interacting XXZ Models with Disorder
Authors: Samuel E. Begg, Bishal K. Ghosh, Chong Zu, Chuanwei Zhang, Michael Kolodrubetz
Abstract: While spin squeezing has been traditionally considered in all-to-all interacting models, recent works have shown that it can also occur in systems with power-law interactions, enabling direct tests in Rydberg atoms, trapped ions, ultracold atoms, and nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. For the latter, Wu et al. Nature 646 (2025) demonstrated that spin squeezing is heavily affected by positional disorder, reducing any capacity for a practical squeezing advantage, which requires scalability with the system size. In this Letter we explore the robustness of spin squeezing in two-dimensional lattices with a fraction of unoccupied lattice sites. Using semiclassical modeling, we demonstrate the existence of scalable squeezing in power-law interacting XXZ models up to a disorder threshold, above which squeezing is not scalable. We produce a phase diagram for scalable squeezing, and explain its absence in the aforementioned NV experiment. Our work illustrates the maximum disorder allowed for realizing scalable spin squeezing in a host of quantum simulators, highlights a regime with substantial tolerance to disorder, and identifies controlled defect creation as a promising route for scalable squeezing in solid-state systems.

Title: Creation of ultracold heteronuclear p-wave Feshbach molecules
Authors: Fan Jia, Zhichao Guo, Zerong Huang, Dajun Wang
Abstract: We report the creation of optically trapped ultracold heteronuclear p-wave Feshbach molecules in a mixture of 23Na and 87Rb atoms. With loss spectroscopy and binding energy measurements, we systematically characterize the interspecies p-wave Feshbach resonances near 284 G. Leveraging this understanding, we use magneto-association to form p-wave NaRb Feshbach molecules, producing both pure samples and mixtures of molecules in different angular momentum states. Additionally, we investigate the inelastic loss of these molecules, primarily influenced by atom-molecule and molecule-molecule collisions. Our results represent a significant step toward realizing tunable p-wave interactions in heteronuclear ultracold systems and provide a foundation for exploring non-zero angular momentum molecules.

Title: Quantum field theory approach for multistage chemical kinetics in liquids
Authors: Roman V. Li, Oleg A. Igoshin, Eugine B. Krissinel, Pavel A. Frantsuzov
Abstract: Reaction-diffusion processes play an important role in a variety of physical, chemical, and biological systems. Conventionally, the kinetics of these processes are described by the law of mass action. However, there are various cases where these equations are insufficient. A fundamental challenge lies in accurately accounting for the microscopic correlations that inevitably arise in bimolecular reactions. While approaches to describe microscopic correlations in many specific cases exist, no general theory for multistage reactions has been established. In this article, we apply the quantum field theory approach to derive kinetic equations for general multistage reactive systems termed CMET (complete modified encounter theory). CMET can be formulated as a set of coupled partial differential equations that can be easily integrated numerically, thereby serving as a versatile tool for investigating reaction-diffusion processes. Across multiple case studies, we demonstrated that CMET reproduces the kinetics predicted by many other theories within their respective scopes of applicability.

Title: Order Out of Noise and Disorder: Fate of the Frustrated Manifold
Authors: Igor Halperin
Abstract: We study Langevin dynamics of $N$ Brownian particles on two-dimensional Riemannian manifolds, interacting through pairwise potentials linear in geodesic distance with quenched random couplings. These \emph{frustrated Brownian particles} experience competing demands of random attractive and repulsive interactions while confined to curved surfaces. We consider three geometries: the sphere $S^2$, torus $T^2$, and bounded cylinder. Our central finding is disorder-induced dimension reduction with spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking: order emerges from two sources of randomness (thermal noise and quenched disorder), with manifold topology determining the character of emerging structures. Glassy relaxation drives particles from 2D distributions to quasi-1D structures: bands on $S^2$, rings on $T^2$, and localized clusters on the cylinder. Unlike conventional symmetry breaking, the symmetry-breaking direction is not frozen but evolves slowly via thermal noise. On the sphere, the structure normal precesses diffusively on the Goldstone manifold with correlation time $\tau_c \approx 18$, a classical realization of type-A dissipative Nambu-Goldstone dynamics. The model requires no thermodynamic gradients, no fine-tuning, and no slow external input. We discuss connections to spin glass theory, quantum field theory, astrophysical structure formation, and self-organizing systems. The model admits a large-$N$ limit yielding statistical field theory on Riemannian surfaces, while remaining experimentally realizable in colloidal and soft matter systems.
