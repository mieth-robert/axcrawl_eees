Title: Nano-optomechanical exploration of the dynamical photothermal response of suspended nanowires to laser-induced thermal waves
Authors: Gouriou Clément, Dousset Cattleya, Fontana Alex, Reigue Antoine, Fogliano Francesco, Weltz Hugo, Judéaux Lucas, Croquette Michael, Pigeau Benjamin, Arcizet Olivier
Abstract: Thermal and photothermal effects play an increasing role at the nanoscale due to the general decrease of thermal conductances and to the increasing role of interfaces. Here we present a non-contact optomechanical analysis of the thermal and photothermal properties of suspended nanowires based on pump-probe response measurements: a probe laser measures the nanowire deformations and property changes caused by an intensity-modulated pump laser launching thermal waves propagating along the 1D conductor. The analysis of the dominant photothermal contributions to the nanowires response in the spectral and spatial domains allows in particular to quantify the interfacial contact resistance, to detect its internal optical resonances and to image absorption inhomogeneities. Additionally, by exploiting the temperature-induced optical reflectivity changes of the nanowire, we directly image the spatial structure of the thermal waves propagating within the nanowire. Finally we investigate how those thermal waves are responsible for a dynamical modulation of the nanowire vibration frequency, in the resolved sideband regime, providing novel analytical tools to further inspect the structural properties of nano-optomechanical systems with a large signal to noise ratio. Those methods are generic and critical to correctly understand the photothermal dynamical back action processes and improve the intrinsic sensitivity of those ultrasensitive force probes.

Title: Thermodynamics: A Clear Conceptual Framework
Authors: Joaquim Anacleto
Abstract: Building on the fundamental equation, this study revisits key thermodynamic concepts in a cohesive and innovative manner. It demonstrates the consistency of thermodynamic theory while addressing and clarifying common misconceptions and errors found in the literature, particularly regarding discussions on heat and work. Although the latter two concepts could potentially be set aside, they can be retained if their various and different definitions are clearly articulated and properly understood. The proposed theoretical framework was tested using the free expansion of an ideal gas, a particularly demanding example due to its abrupt nature. From an educational standpoint, this article is invaluable as it consolidates fundamental yet often subtle concepts in an assertive and comprehensible way. Furthermore, it promotes a clearer and more accessible understanding of thermodynamics, challenging the widespread notion that is inherently difficult to grasp.

Title: Hall-on-Toric: Descendant Laughlin state in the chiral $\mathbb{Z}_p$ toric code
Authors: Robin Schäfer, Claudio Chamon, Chris R. Laumann
Abstract: We demonstrate that the chiral $\mathbb{Z}_p$ toric code -- the quintessential model of topological order -- hosts additional, emergent topological phases when perturbed: descendant fractional quantum Hall-like states, which we term \textit{Hall-on-Toric}. These hierarchical states feature fractionalized $\mathbb{Z}_p$ charges and increased topological ground-state degeneracy. The Hall-on-Toric phases appear in the vicinity of the transitions between deconfined $\mathbb{Z}_p$ phases with different background charge per unit cell, in a fixed non-trivial flux background. We confirm their existence through extensive infinite density matrix renormalization group (iDMRG) simulations, analyzing the topological entanglement entropy, entanglement spectra, and a generalized Hall conductance. Remarkably, the Hall-on-Toric states remain robust even in the absence of $U(1)$ symmetry. Our findings reinforce the foundational interpretation of star and plaquette defects as magnetic and electric excitations, and reveal that this perspective extends to a much deeper level.

Title: Spacetime symmetry-enriched SymTFT: from LSM anomalies to modulated symmetries and beyond
Authors: Salvatore D. Pace, Ömer M. Aksoy, Ho Tat Lam
Abstract: We extend the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) framework beyond internal symmetries by including geometric data that encode spacetime symmetries. Concretely, we enrich the SymTFT of an internal symmetry by spacetime symmetries and study the resulting symmetry-enriched topological (SET) order, which captures the interplay between the spacetime and internal symmetries. We illustrate the framework by focusing on symmetries in 1+1D. To this end, we first analyze how gapped boundaries of 2+1D SETs affect the enriching symmetry, and apply this within the SymTFT framework to gauging and detecting anomalies of the 1+1D symmetry, as well as to classifying 1+1D symmetry-enriched phases. We then consider quantum spin chains and explicitly construct the SymTFTs for three prototypical spacetime symmetries: lattice translations, spatial reflections, and time reversal. For lattice translations, the interplay with internal symmetries is encoded in the SymTFT by translations permuting anyons, which causes the continuum description of the SymTFT to be a foliated field theory. Using this, we elucidate the relation between Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) anomalies and modulated symmetries and classify modulated symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. For reflection and time-reversal symmetries, the interplay can additionally be encoded by symmetry fractionalization data in the SymTFT, and we identify mixed anomalies and study gauging for such examples.

Title: Quantum Geometry in the NbSe$_2$ Family I: Obstructed Compact Wannier Function and New Perturbation Theory
Authors: Jiabin Yu, Yi Jiang, Yuanfeng Xu, Dumitru Călugăru, Haoyu Hu, Haojie Guo, Sandra Sajan, Yongsong Wang, Miguel M. Ugeda, Fernando De Juan, B. Andrei Bernevig
Abstract: We revisit the electronic structure and band topology of monolayer 1H-NbSe$_2$, which hosts both superconductivity and charge density wave, and its related compounds 1H-MoS$_2$, NbS$_2$, TaS$_2$, TaSe$_2$ and WS$_2$. We construct a 6-band, a 3-band, and - simplest of all - a single-band model for this material family, by directly Wannierizing the ab initio bands. All host obstructed atomic isolated bands away from the atomic positions near the Fermi energy. We find that in the 3-band model, the obstructed atomic Wannier function can be well approximated by an optimally compact Wannier function with more than 90% accuracy for all the compounds, rising to a remarkable 94% accuracy in NbSe$_2$. Interestingly, the simplest single-band model has next nearest-neighboring hopping larger than the nearest-neighboring hopping (by nearly an order of magnitude for MoS$_2$, NbSe$_2$, TaSe$_2$ and WS$_2$), which comes from the cancellation between the atomic onsite terms and the atomic nearest-neighboring hopping after projecting to the obstructed atomic Wannier functions. Furthermore for NbSe$_2$, we employ a novel approximation scheme to obtain an effective Hamiltonian that captures the 3 bands originating mainly from the Nb atom. We also use conventional perturbation theory to derive the ab initio obstructed Wannier function with 95% accuracy. Our results pave the way for future study of the effect of quantum geometry on the correlated phases in this family of materials.

Title: Unconventional Spintronics from Chiral Perovskites
Authors: Yuntian Liu, Reshna Shrestha, Konstantin Denisov, Denzel Ayala, Mark van Schilfgaarde, Wanyi Nie, Igor Žutić
Abstract: Spintronic devices typically employ heterostructures with ferromagnets which break time-reversal symmetry and have non-vanishing magnetization. With the growing class of materials that support spin-polarized carriers, current, and excitations,it is possible to envision emerging spintronic applications that are not limited to magnetoresistance. Here we focus on chiral perovskites with no net magnetization where the space-inversion and mirror symmetries are broken to induce chiral structure. The known importance of these perovskites is further expanded by the demonstration of the chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS). However, the generation of the spin-polarized carriers across the interface with these chiral perovskites remains to be fully understood. Our first-principles studies for two-dimensional PbBr$_4$-based chiral perovskites provide their electronic structure and an orbital-based symmetry analysis, which allows us to establish an effective Hamiltonian to elucidate the underlying origin of their chirality. We also use this analysis for the Edelstein effect, responsible for electrical generation of the nonequilibrium spin polarization in many materials, which in chiral perovskites could be a mechanism contributing to CISS. Furthermore, by examining optical properties of chiral perovskites and the opportunity to use them to realize tunable altermagnets, another class of zero-magnetization spintronic materials, we put forth a versatile materials platform for unconventional spintronics.

Title: Periodically Driven anharmonic chain: Convergent Power Series and Numerics
Authors: Pedro L. Garrido, Tomasz Komorowski, Joel L. Lebowitz, Stefano Olla
Abstract: We investigate the long time behavior of a pinned chain of $2N+1$ oscillators, indexed by $x \in\{-N,\ldots, N\}$. The system is subjected to an external driving force on the particle at $x=0$, of period $\theta=2\pi/\omega$, and to frictional damping $\gamma>0$ at both endpoints $x=-N$ and $N$. The oscillators interact with a pinned and nearest neighbor harmonic plus anharmonic potentials of the form $\frac{\omega_0^2 q_x^2}{2}+\frac12 (q_{x}-q_{x-1})^2 +\nu\left[V(q_x)+U(q_x-q_{x-1}) \right]$, with $V''$ and $U''$ bounded and $\nu\in \mathbb{R}$. We recall the recently proven convergence and the global stability of a perturbation series in powers of $\nu$ for $|\nu| < \nu_0$, yielding the long time periodic state of the system. Here $\nu_0$ depends only on the supremum norms of $V''$ and $U''$ and the distance of the set of non-negative integer multiplicities of $\omega$ from the interval $[\omega_0,\sqrt{\omega_0^2+4}]$ - the spectrum of the infinite harmonic chain for $\nu=0$. We describe also some numerical studies of this system going beyond our rigorous results.

Title: Quantum Hall Andreev Conversion in Graphene Nanostructures
Authors: Alexey Bondarev, William H. Klein, Harold U. Baranger
Abstract: We study Andreev conversion in clean nanostructures containing an interface between graphene in the quantum Hall (QH) state and a superconductor, focusing on the lowest Landau level. First, several graphene nanostructures formed from zigzag edges with sharp corners are considered using a tight-binding model. We find the scattering state for an electron impinging on the interface from the upstream QH edge state, together with the probability of it exiting as a hole in the downstream QH edge state (Andreev conversion). From these results, we deduce the behavior for edges at an arbitrary angle and for rounded corners. A key issue is whether the graphene-superconductor interface is fully transparent or only partially transparent. For full transparency, we recover previous results. In contrast, interfaces with partial but substantial transparency (well away from the tunneling limit) behave very differently: (i) the hybrid electron-hole interfacial modes are not valley degenerate and (ii) intervalley scattering can occur at the corners, even when rounded. As a result, interference between the two hybrid modes can occur, even in the absence of disorder. Finally, we compare the sensitivity of Andreev conversion to interface transparency in the QH regime to that in the absence of a magnetic field. While the zero-field result closely follows the classic Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk relation, Andreev conversion in the QH regime is considerably more robust.

Title: Unlocking Quantum Control and Multi-Order Correlations via Terahertz Two-Dimensional Coherent Spectroscopy
Authors: Chuankun Huang, Martin Mootz, Liang Luo, Ilias E. Perakis, Jigang Wang
Abstract: Terahertz two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (THz-2DCS) is transforming our ability to probe, visualize, and control quantum materials far from equilibrium. This emerging technique brings multi-dimensional resolution to the ultrafast dynamics of nonequilibrium phases of matter, enabling new capabilities demanding precise coherent control and measurement of many-body dynamics and multi-order correlations. By mapping complex excitations across time and frequency dimensions, THz-2DCS delivers coherence tomography of driven quantum matter, thus revealing hidden excitation pathways, measuring higher order nonlinear response functions, disentangling various quantum pathways, capturing collective modes on ultrafast timescales and at terahertz frequencies. These experimental features frequently remain obscured in traditional single particle measurements, ultrafast spectroscopy techniques, and equilibrium-based probes. This Review traces the early development of THz-2DCS and showcases significant recent progress in leveraging this technique to probe and manipulate quantum material properties, including nonequilibrium superconductivity, nonlinear magnonics, dynamical topological phases, and the detection of novel excitations and exotic collective modes with potential technological impact. Looking forward, we identify critical opportunities in advancing THz-2DCS instrumentation and experimental strategies that are shaping future applications in THz optoelectronics, quantum information processing, and sensing.

Title: An alternative approach to the phonon theory of liquids: Evolution of the energy of diffusion
Authors: M. Y. Esmer, Bahtiyar A. Mamedov
Abstract: With regard to the three basic states of matter (solid, liquid, gas), the calculation of the heat capacity of liquids in a general form has been considered one of the deepest and most interesting challenges in condensed matter physics, due to the strong, system-specific interactions involved. Notwithstanding the theoretical difficulties, there have recently been significant advances in our understanding of liquids, and the phonon theory of liquids has been proposed. However, this theory uses the virial theorem to calculate the liquid energy. Here, we propose an alternative version of the phonon theory of liquids by taking into account the numbers of oscillating atoms and diffusing atoms, rather than using the virial theorem. A new formula is derived for the liquid energy in both the quantum and the classical anharmonic cases. To verify the proposed approach, theoretical predictions are compared with the experimental specific heat of liquid mercury. Finally, we obtain a new expression for the energy of a supercritical system.

Title: Engineering Quantum Wire States for Atom Scale Circuitry
Authors: Max Yuan, Lucian Livadaru, Roshan Achal, Jason Pitters, Furkan Altincicek, Robert Wolkow
Abstract: Recent advances in hydrogen lithography on silicon surfaces now enable the fabrication of complex and error-free atom-scale circuitry. The structure of atomic wires, the most basic and common circuit elements, plays a crucial role at this scale, as the exact position of each atom matters. As such, the characterization of atomic wire geometries is critical for identifying the most effective configurations. In this study, we employed low-temperature (4.5 K) scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) to systematically fabricate and characterize six planar wire configurations made up of silicon dangling bonds (DBs) on the H-Si(100) surface. Crucially, the characterization was performed at the same location and under identical tip conditions, thereby eliminating artifacts due to the local environment to reveal true electronic differences among the line configurations. By performing dI/dV line spectroscopy on each wire, we reveal their local density of states (LDOS) and demonstrate how small variations in wire geometry affect orbital hybridization and induce the emergence of new electronic states. Complementarily, we deploy density functional theory (DFT) and non-equilibrium Green's functions to compute the LDOS and evaluate transmission coefficients for the most promising wire geometries. Our results indicate that dimer and wider wires exhibit multiple discrete mid-gap electronic states which could be exploited for signal transport or as custom quantum dots. Furthermore, wider wires benefit from additional current pathways and exhibit increased transmission, while also demonstrating enhanced immunity to hydrogen defects.

Title: Tuning Incommensurate Charge Order in Ba$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$Al$_4$ and Ba$_{1-y}$Eu$_y$Al$_4$
Authors: Prathum Saraf, Eleanor M. Clements, Danila Sokratov, Shanta Saha, Peter Zavalij, Thomas W. Heitmann, Jeffrey W. Lynn, Camille Bernal-Choban, Dipanjan Chaudhuri, Caitlin Kengle, Yue Su, Simon Bettler, Nathan Manning, Peter Abbamonte, Sananda Biswas, Roser Valentí, Johnpierre Paglione
Abstract: The BaAl$_4$-type structure family is home to a vast landscape of interesting and exotic properties, with descendant crystal structures hosting a variety of electronic ground states including magnetic, superconducting and strongly correlated electron phenomena. BaAl$_4$ itself hosts a non-trivial topological band structure, but is otherwise a paramagnetic metal. However, the other members of the $A$Al$_4$ family ($A$= alkali earth), including SrAl$_4$ and EuAl$_4$, exhibit symmetry-breaking ground states including charge density wave (CDW) and magnetic orders. Here we investigate the properties of the solid solution series Ba$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$Al$_4$ and Ba$_{1-y}$Eu$_y$Al$_4$ using transport, thermodynamic and scattering experiments to study the evolution of the charge-ordered state as it is suppressed with Ba substitution to zero near 50% substitution in both systems. Neutron and x-ray diffraction measurements reveal an incommensurate CDW state in SrAl$_4$ with $c$-axis-oriented ordering vector (0, 0, 0.097) that evolves with Ba substitution toward a shorter wavelength. A similar progression is observed in the Ba$_{1-y}$Eu$_y$Al$_4$ series that also scales with the ordering temperature, revealing a universal correlation between charge-order transition temperature and ordering vector that points to a critical wavevector that stabilizes CDW order in both systems. We study the evolution of the phonon band structure in the Ba$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$Al$_4$ system, revealing the suppression of the CDW phase matches the suppression of a phonon instability at precisely the same momentum as observed in experiments, confirming the electron-phonon origin of charge order in this system.

Title: Coercivity-size map of magnetic nanoflowers: spin disorder tunes the vortex reversal mechanism and tailors the hyperthermia sweet spot
Authors: Elizabeth M Jefremovas, Lisa Calus, Jonathan Leliaert
Abstract: Iron-oxide nanoflowers (NFs) are one of the most efficient nanoheaters for magnetic hyperthermia therapy (MHT). However, the physics underlying the spin texture of disordered iron-oxide nanoparticles beyond the single-domain limit remains still poorly understood. Using large-scale micromagnetic simulations we completely map the magnetization of NFs over an unprecedented size range, from 10 to 400 nm in diameter, connecting their microstructure to their macroscopic magnetic response. Above the single domain (d > 50 nm), the magnetization folds into a vortex state, within which the coercivity describes a secondary maximum, not present for non-disordered nanoparticles. We have extended our understanding by resolving also the NF magnetization dynamics, capturing the physics of the magnetization reversal. Within the vortex regime, two distinct reversal modes exist: i) A core-dominated one, in which the core immediately switches along the direction of the applied field, resulting in an increasing coercivity for larger sizes; and ii) a flux-closure dominated reversal mode, going through the perpendicular alignment of the vortex core to the field, resulting in a decreasing coercivity-size dependence. The coercivity maximum is located at the transition between both reversal modes, and results from the combination of grain anisotropy and grain-boundary pinning: weak (but non-negligible) inter-grain exchange keeps the vortex profile coherent, yet allows the core to be pinned by the random anisotropy easy axes of the single grains, maximizing magnetic losses. Our results provide the first full description of spin textures in iron oxide NFs beyond the macrospin framework, and clarify the role of internal spin disorder in magnetic hyperthermia heating. By adjusting the grain size, the coercivity "sweet spot" can be tailored, offering a practical route to next-generation, high-efficiency nanoheaters.

Title: Is the hyperscaling relation violated below the upper critical dimension in some particular cases?
Authors: Hung T. Diep, Van-Thanh Ngo
Abstract: In this review, we show our results with new interpretation on the critical exponents of thin films obtained by high-performance multi-histogram Monte Carlo simulations. The film thickness $N_z$ consists of a few layers up to a dozen of layers in the $z$ direction. The free boundary condition is applied in this direction while in the $xy$ plane periodic boundary conditions are used. Large $xy$ plane sizes are used for finite-size scaling. The Ising model is studied with nearest-neighbor (NN) interaction. When $N_z=1$, namely the two-dimensional (2D) system, we find the critical exponents given by the renormalization group. While, for $N_z>1$, the critical exponents calculated with the high-precision multi-histogram technique show that they deviate slightly but systematically from the 2D values. If we use these values of critical exponents in the hyperscaling relation with $d=2$, then the hyperscaling relation is violated. However, if we use the hyperscaling relation and the critical exponents obtained for $N_z>1$ to calculate the dimension of the system, we find the system dimension slightly larger than 2. This can be viewed as an "effective" dimension. More discussion is given in the paper. We also show the cross-over between the first- and second-order transition while varying the film thickness in an antiferromagnetic FCC Ising frustrated thin film. In addition, we will show evidence that when a 2D system has two order parameters of different symmetries with a single transition, the critical exponents are new, suggesting a universality class of coupled two-symmetry breakings. In this case, the 2D hyperscaling does not hold. Another case is the 3D Ising model coupled to the lattice vibration: the critical exponents deviate from the 3D Ising ones, the results suggest the violation of the hyperscaling.

Title: Superconductivity in Ternary Zirconium Telluride Zr6RuTe2
Authors: Kosuke Yuchi, Haruka Matsumoto, Daisuke Nishio-Hamane, Kodai Moriyama, Keita Kojima, Ryutaro Okuma, Jun-ichi Yamaura, Yoshihiko Okamoto
Abstract: Zr6CoAl2-type Zr6RuTe2 is found to show bulk superconductivity below the superconducting transition temperature Tc = 1.1 K, according to the electrical resistivity, magnetization, and heat capacity measurements using synthesized polycrystalline samples. This Tc exceeds that of Zr6MTe2 compounds in which M is other transition metals, indicating that M = Ru is favorable for superconductivity in Zr6CoAl2-type Zr6MX2.

Title: Symmetries of electron interactions in Hubbard models of unconventional superconductors
Authors: Sergei Urazhdin, Yiou Zhang
Abstract: We use symmetry arguments to show that the matrix elements of electron-electron interaction on a lattice reach extrema in states composed of wavevectors near high-symmetry points of the Brillouin zone. The mechanism is illustrated by minimal models of cuprates and Fe-based superconductors, where this dependence originates from the wavevector-dependent orbital composition of wavefunctions. We discuss how these dependences can facilitate finite-momentum pairing. Our results provide symmetry-based guidance for the search for new high-temperature superconductors.

Title: Enhancement of quantum coherence in solid-state qubits via interface engineering
Authors: Wing Ki Lo, Yaowen Zhang, Ho Yin Chow, Jiahao Wu, Man Yin Leung, Kin On Ho, Xuliang Du, Yifan Chen, Yang Shen, Ding Pan, Sen Yang
Abstract: Shallow nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are promising quantum sensors but suffer from noise-induced short coherence times due to bulk and surface impurities. We present interfacial engineering via oxygen termination and graphene patching, extending shallow NV coherence to over 1 ms, approaching the T1 limit. Raman spectroscopy and density-functional theory reveal surface termination-driven graphene charge transfer reduces spin noise by pairing surface electrons, supported by double electron-electron resonance spectroscopy showing fewer unpaired spins. Enhanced sensitivity enables detection of single weakly coupled 13C nuclear spins and external 11B spins from a hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) layer, achieving nanoscale nuclear magnetic resonance. A protective h-BN top layer stabilizes the platform, ensuring robustness against harsh treatments and compatibility with target materials. This integrated approach advances practical quantum sensing by combining extended coherence, improved sensitivity, and device durability.

Title: Noninvertible symmetry and topological holography for modulated SPT in one dimension
Authors: Jintae Kim, Yizhi You, Jung Hoon Han
Abstract: We examine noninvertible symmetry (NIS) in one-dimensional (1D) symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases protected by dipolar and exponential-charge symmetries, which are two key examples of modulated SPT (MSPT). To set the stage, we first study NIS in the $\mathbb{Z}_N \times \mathbb{Z}_N$ cluster model, extending previous work on the $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ case. For each symmetry type (charge, dipole, exponential), we explicitly construct the noninvertible Kramers-Wannier (KW) and Kennedy-Tasaki (KT) transformations, revealing dual models with spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB). The resulting symmetry group structure of the SSB model is rich enough that it allows the identification of other SSB models with the same symmetry. Using these alternative SSB models and KT duality, we generate novel MSPT phases distinct from those associated with the standard decorated domain wall picture, and confirm their distinctiveness by projective symmetry analyses at their interfaces. Additionally, we establish a topological-holographic correspondence by identifying the 2D bulk theories-two coupled layers of toric codes (charge), anisotropic dipolar toric codes (dipole), and exponentially modulated toric codes (exponential)-whose boundaries host the respective 1D MSPT phases.

Title: Nodal-line semimetals and their variance
Authors: Po-Yao Chang
Abstract: Topological nodal-line semimetals (NLSMs) are a new family of topological materials characterized by electronic band crossings that form lines in the Brillouin zone. These NLSMs host exotic nodal-line structures and exhibit distinct features such as drumhead surface states and unique electromagnetic responses. This review classifies various NLSM types based on their nodal structures and protecting symmetries, highlighting that these nodal-line structures can form links, knots, and chains. We discuss their characteristic electromagnetic responses, including Landau level spectroscopy, optical conductivity, and permittivity. Furthermore, the strong correlation effects in these NLSMs modify their semimetallic phases and lead to novel quantum phases where magnetism and superconductivity intertwine.

Title: High-Throughput NEB for Li-Ion Conductor Discovery via Fine-Tuned CHGNet Potential
Authors: Jingchen Lian, Xiao Fu, Xuhe Gong, Ruijuan Xiao, Hong Li
Abstract: Solid-state electrolytes are essential in the development of all-solid-state batteries. While density functional theory (DFT)-based nudged elastic band (NEB) and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) methods provide fundamental insights on lithium-ion migration barriers and ionic conductivity, their computational costs make large-scale materials exploration challenging. In this study, we developed a high-throughput NEB computational framework integrated with the fine-tuned universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs), enabling accelerated prediction of migration barriers based on transition state theory for the efficient discovery of fast-ion conductors. This framework automates the construction of initial/final states and migration paths, mitigating the inaccurate barriers prediction in pretrained potentials due to the insufficient training data on high-energy states. We employed the fine-tuned CHGNet model into NEB/MD calculations and the dual CHGNet-NEB/MD achieves a balance between computational speed and accuracy, as validated in NASICON-type Li$_{1+x}$Al$_x$Ti$_{2-x}$(PO$_4$)$_3$ (LATP) structures. Through high-throughput screening, we identified orthorhombic Pnma-group structures (LiMgPO$_4$, LiTiPO$_5$, etc.) which can serve as promising frameworks for fast ion conductors. Their aliovalent-doped variants, Li$_{0.5}$Mg$_{0.5}$Al$_{0.5}$PO$_4$ and Li$_{0.5}$TiPO$_{4.5}$F$_{0.5}$, were predicted to possess low activation energies, as well as high ionic conductivity of 0.19 mS/cm and 0.024 mS/cm, respectively.

Title: Discontinuous percolation via suppression of neighboring clusters in a network
Authors: Young Sul Cho
Abstract: Our recent study on the Bethe lattice reported that a discontinuous percolation transition emerges as the number of occupied links increases and each node rewires its links to locally suppress the growth of neighboring clusters. However, since the Bethe lattice is a tree, a macroscopic cluster forms as an infinite spanning tree but does not contain a finite fraction of the nodes. In this paper, we study a bipartite network that can be regarded as a locally tree-like structure with long-range neighbors. In this network, each node in one of the two partitions is allowed to rewire its links to nodes in the other partition to suppress the growth of neighboring clusters. We observe a discontinuous percolation transition characterized by the emergence of a single macroscopic cluster containing a finite fraction of nodes, followed by critical behavior of the cluster size distribution. We also provide an analytical explanation of the underlying mechanism.

Title: A statistical theory for polymer elasticity: from molecular kinematics to continuum behavior
Authors: Lin Zhan, Siyu Wang, Rui Xiao, Shaoxing Qu, Paul Steinmann
Abstract: Predicting the macroscopic mechanical behavior of polymeric materials from the micro-structural features has remained a challenge for decades. Existing theoretical models often fail to accurately capture the experimental data, due to non-physical assumptions that link the molecule kinematics with the macroscopic deformation. In this work, we construct a novel Hamiltonian for chain segments enabling a unified statistical description of both individual macromolecular chains and continuum polymer networks. The chain kinematics, including the stretch and orientation properties, are retrieved by the thermodynamic observables without phenomenological assumptions. The theory shows that the chain stretch is specified by a simple relation via its current spatial direction and the continuum Eulerian logarithmic strain, while the probability of a chain in this spatial direction is governed by the new Hamiltonian of a single segment. The model shows a significantly improved prediction on the hyperelastic response of elastomers, relying on minimal, physically-grounded parameters.

Title: Time- and Polarization-Resolved Extreme Ultraviolet Momentum Microscopy
Authors: Sotirios Fragkos, Quentin Courtade, Olena Tkach, Jérôme Gaudin, Dominique Descamps, Guillaume Barrette, Stéphane Petit, Gerd Schönhense, Yann Mairesse, Samuel Beaulieu
Abstract: We report the development of an instrument combining an ultrafast, high-repetition-rate, polarization-tunable monochromatic extreme ultraviolet (XUV, 21.6 eV) beamline and a next-generation momentum microscope endstation. This setup enables time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy of quantum materials, offering multimodal photoemission dichroism capabilities. The momentum microscope simultaneously detects the full surface Brillouin zone over an extended binding energy range. It is equipped with advanced electron optics, including a new type of front lens that supports multiple operational modes. Enhanced spatial resolution is achieved by combining the small XUV beam footprint (33 $\mu$m by 45 $\mu$m) with the selection of small regions of interest using apertures positioned in the Gaussian plane of the momentum microscope. This instrument achieves an energy resolution of 44 meV and a temporal resolution of 144 fs. We demonstrate the capability to perform linear, Fourier, and circular dichroism in photoelectron angular distributions from photoexcited 2D materials. This functionality paves the way for time-, energy-, and momentum-resolved investigations of orbital and quantum geometrical properties underlying electronic structures of quantum materials driven out of equilibrium.

Title: Dynamic Avalanches: Rate-Controlled Switching and Race Conditions
Authors: Lishuai Jin, Martin van Hecke
Abstract: Avalanches are rapid cascades of rearrangements driven by cooperative flipping of hysteretic local elements. Here we show that flipping dynamics and race conditions -- where multiple elements become unstable simultaneously -- give rise to dynamic avalanches that cannot be captured by static models of interacting elements. We realize dynamic avalanches in metamaterials with controlled flipping times, and demonstrate how this allows to modify, promote, and direct avalanche behavior. Our work elucidates the crucial role of internal dynamics in complex materials and introduces dynamic design principles for materializing targeted pathways and sequential functionalities.

Title: Ginzburg-Landau theory for unconventional surface superconductivity in PtBi$_2$
Authors: Harald Waje, Fabian Jakubczyk, Jeroen van den Brink, Carsten Timm
Abstract: Recent experimental evidence suggests the presence of an unconventional, nodal surface-superconducting state in trigonal PtBi\textsubscript{2}. We construct a Ginzburg--Landau theory for the three superconducting order parameters, which correspond to the three irreducible representations of the point group $C_{3v}$. The irreducible representations $A_1$ and $A_2$ are the most likely. We develop a systematic method to determine the symmetry-allowed terms and apply it to derive all terms up to fourth order in the three order parameters. The Ginzburg--Landau functional also includes coupling to the magnetic field. The functional is employed to determine the effect of an applied uniform magnetic field on the nodal structure for $A_1$ and $A_2$ pairing. The results facilitate clear-cut experimental differentiation between these symmetries. We also predict field-induced pair-density waves.

Title: Generation of a single-cycle surface acoustic wave pulse on LiNbO$_3$ for application to thin film materials
Authors: Koji Fujiwara, Shunsuke Ota, Tetsuo Kodera, Yuma Okazaki, Nobu-Hisa Kaneko, Nan Jiang, Yasuhiro Niimi, Shintaro Takada
Abstract: Surface acoustic wave (SAW) technology has been explored in thin-film materials to discover fundamental phenomena and to investigate their physical properties. It is used to excite and manipulate quasi-particles such as phonons or magnons, and can dynamically modulate the properties of the materials. In the field, SAWs are typically excited by a continuous wave at a resonant frequency. Recently, generation of a single-cycle SAW pulse has been demonstrated on GaAs substrate. Such a SAW pulse provides a potential to access a single quasi-particle excitation and to investigate its dynamics by time-resolved measurements. On the other hand, to modulate and control the properties of thin film materials, it is generally required to generate high-intensity SAWs. In this work, we demonstrate the efficient generation of a SAW pulse using a chirp interdigital transducer (IDT) on LiNbO$_3$ substrate. We have fabricated chirp IDT devices with bandwidths from 0.5 GHz to 5.5 GHz. We also confirmed the generation of a SAW pulse with 0.3 ns FWHM (full width at half maximum) by performing time-resolved measurements. The conversion efficiency between input power and SAW on LiNbO$_3$ substrate is approximately 45 times larger than that on GaAs substrate. This enables us to generate a high-intensity SAW pulse, meeting the requirement for the modulation of thin films. Our results will expand the research in the field, such as spintronics and magnonics, and lead to their further advancements.

Title: Thermodynamic bounds and error correction for faulty coarse graining
Authors: Jann van der Meer, Keiji Saito
Abstract: At the nanoscale, random effects govern not only the dynamics of a physical system but may also affect its observation. This work introduces a novel paradigm for coarse graining that eschews the assignment of a unique coarse-grained trajectory to a microscopic one. Instead, observations are not only coarse-grained but are also accompanied by a small chance of error. Formulating the problem in terms of path weights, we identify a condition on the structure of errors that ensures that the observed entropy production does not increase. As a result, the framework of stochastic thermodynamics for estimating entropy production can be extended to this broader class of systems. As an application, we consider Markov networks in which individual transitions can be observed but may be mistaken for each other. We motivate, derive, and illustrate thermodynamic bounds that relate the error sensitivity of the observed entropy production to the strength of the driving and are valid for arbitrary network topologies. If sufficiently many transitions in the network can be observed, redundancies in the coarse-grained trajectories can be used to detect and correct errors, which potentially improves naive estimates of entropy production. We conclude with an outlook on subsequent research on thermodynamic bounds for erroneous coarse graining.

Title: Observation of terahertz spin-Hall magnetoresistance in insulating magnet YIG/Pt

Abstract: We report on the observation of spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR) in prototypical bilayers of ferrimagnetic yttrium iron garnet (YIG) and platinum in the frequency range from 0 THz to as high as 1.5 THz. The spectral composition of the effect exhibits a strong low-pass behavior, decreasing by approximately 75% from 0 THz to 0.2 THz and vanishing entirely at 1.5 THz. Using a dynamic magnetoresistive model, we can fully explain the spectral dependence by competition of transverse spin-torque (coherent) and longitudinal (incoherent) contributions to the spin current and their characteristic response times. Our analysis suggests that the slow dissipation of incoherent magnons from the interface is the limiting process responsible for the dramatic spectral decay of the SMR. These results establish THz SMR as a powerful probe of ultrafast interfacial spin-magnon coupling.

Title: Synergistic Effects of Spin-Orbit Coupling and Intercomponent Interactions in Two-Component (2+1)D Photonic Fields
Authors: Suri Deekshita, S. Sanjay, S. Saravana Veni, Conrad B. Tabi, Timoleon C. Kofane
Abstract: The study investigates the formation, stability and dynamic advancement of two-dimensional vortex quantum droplets within binary Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), shaped by the interplay of photonic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and quantum fluctuation effects. SOC leads to significant droplet stretching, resulting in vortex clusters forming in each component. The competition between photonic SOC and Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) interactions introduces vortices into the condensate, described by the numerically solved Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE). The results show that droplets like structures arise at low SOC strengths and interaction parameters. The transition to vortex takes place as the SOC increases. Enhanced interactions give rise to the emergence of quantum droplets as the vortices dissipate, demonstrating fascinating dynamics. These findings enhance understanding of the physical properties of photonic SOC coupled binary BECs in 2D with LHY correction, impacting cold-atom physics and condensed matter research. The study can also be expanded to explore quantum droplets with a small atom count, which is advantageous for experimental applications.

Title: Spin-charge bound states and emerging fermions in a quantum spin liquid
Authors: Jens H. Nyhegn, Kristian Knakkergaard Nielsen, Leon Balents, Georg M. Bruun
Abstract: The complex interplay between charge and spin dynamics lies at the heart of strongly correlated quantum materials, and it is a fundamental topic in basic research with far reaching technological perspectives. We explore in this paper the dynamics of holes in a single band extended $t-J$ model where the background spins form a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ quantum spin liquid (QSL). Using a field theory approach based on a parton construction, we show that while the electrons for most momenta fractionalize into uncorrelated charge carrying holons and spin carrying spinons as generally expected for a QSL, the spinon-holon scattering cross-section diverges for certain momenta signalling strong correlations. By deriving an effective low-energy Hamiltonian describing this dynamics, we demonstrate that these divergencies are due to the formation of long lived spinon-holon bound states. We then show that quantum gas microscopy with atoms in optical lattices provides an excellent platform for verifying and probing the internal spatial structure of these emergent fermions. The fermions will furthermore show up as clear quasiparticle peaks in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with an intensity determined by their internal structure. For a non-zero hole concentration, the fermions form hole pockets with qualitatively the same location, shape, and intensity variation in the Brillouin zone as the so-called Fermi arcs observed in the pseudogap phase. Such agreement is remarkable since the Fermi arcs arise from the delicate interplay between the symmetry of the QSL and the internal structure of the emerging fermions in a minimal single band model with no extra degrees of freedom added. Our results, therefore, provide a microscopic mechanism for the conjectured fractionalized Fermi liquid and open up new pathways for exploring the pseudogap phase and high temperature superconductivity as arising from a QSL.

Title: Magnetic octupole Hall effect in heavy transition metals
Authors: Insu Baek, Seungyun Han, Hyun-Woo Lee
Abstract: d-wave altermagnets have the magnetic octupole as their primary order parameter. A recent study [Han et al. arXiv 2409.14423 (2024)] demonstrated that magnetic octupole current can induce Néel vector dynamics. Therefore, identifying materials that can efficiently generate a magnetic octupole current is essential. In this paper, we investigate the magnetic octupole Hall effect in 4d and 5d transition metals. By employing atomic magnetic octupole operators, we calculate the magnetic octupole Hall conductivity using first-principles calculations. We also explore the microscopic origin of the magnetic octupole Hall effect and find that it results from the combined effect of orbital texture and spin-orbit coupling. Additionally, we analyze the ratio of spin Hall conductivity to magnetic octupole Hall conductivity across various materials and identify those that are optimal for observing magnetic octupole physics. We also discuss potential applications arising from the magnetic octupole Hall effect. Our work serves as a valuable reference for identifying materials suitable for studying magnetic octupole physics.

Title: Triboelectric charge transfer theory driven by interfacial thermoelectric effect
Authors: Ji-Ho Mun, Eui-Cheol Shin, Jaeuk Seo, Yong-Hyun Kim
Abstract: Despite extensive study and the practical significance of friction-driven static electricity, a quantitative triboelectric charge transfer theory has yet to be established. Here, we elucidate the detailed dynamics of triboelectric charge transfer driven by interfacial thermoelectric bias maintaining a steady state at the interface. We demonstrate that triboelectric charge exists in a delta-like distribution at a steady state. We suggest that the transferred triboelectric charge is dictated by half of the difference between thermoelectrically induced surface charges. Moreover, we quantitatively discuss electrostatic adhesion and static discharge between the transferred charges, which we may experience every day, including the role of surface charge inhomogeneity. Our findings may have significant implications for applications ranging from static electricity phenomena to advanced energy harvesting devices.

Title: Radiation stability of nanocomposite scintillators
Authors: L. Prouzova Prochazkova, F. Hajek, M. Buryi, Z. Remes, V. Cuba
Abstract: Radiation hardness of scintillating nanocomposites consisting of inorganic scintillating nanocrystalline powders dispersed in organic matrices was studied under electron, X-ray and {\gamma}-ray irradiation. Samples including pure press-compacted pellets of powder ZnO:Ga and YSO:Ce, and the nanocomposites of powder ZnO:Ga and YSO:Ce embedded in polystyrene matrix with different fillings were investigated. Effects of radiation on radioluminescence and other optical properties of studied materials were evaluated. Bright burn effect related to nanocrystalline powder scintillators was observed at lower doses. Radiation damage in nanocomposite materials is related to the formation of radicals in polystyrene matrix. Extent of radiation damage decreases with ZnO:Ga filling. Presented results show the importance of systematic and complex study of the radiation stability of composite scintillators.

Title: Aharanov-Bohm oscillations and perfectly transmitted mode in amorphous topological insulator nanowires
Authors: Miguel F. Martínez, Adolfo G. Grushin, Jens H. Bardarson
Abstract: Crystalline topological insulator nanowires with a magnetic flux threaded through their cross section display Aharanov-Bohm conductance oscillations. A characteristic of these oscillations is the perfectly transmitted mode present at certain values of the magnetic flux, due to the appearance of an effective time-reversal symmetry combined with the topological origin of the nanowire surface states. In contrast, amorphous nanowires display a varying cross section along the wire axis that breaks the effective time-reversal symmetry. In this work, we use transport calculations to study the stability of the Aharanov-Bohm oscillations and the perfectly transmitted mode in amorphous topological nanowires. We observe that at low energies and up to moderate amorphicity the transport is dominated, as in the crystalline case, by the presence of a perfectly transmitted mode. In an amorphous nanowire the perfectly transmitted mode is protected by chiral symmetry or, in its absence, by a statistical time-reversal symmetry. At high amorphicities the Aharanov-Bohm oscillations disappear and the conductance is dominated by nonquantized resonant peaks. We identify these resonances as bound states and relate their appearance to a topological phase transition that brings the nanowires into a trivial insulating phase.

Title: Spatiotemporal hierarchy of thermal avalanches
Authors: Vladimir Yu. Rudyak, Dor Shohat, Yoav Lahini
Abstract: In amorphous solids, frustrated elastic interactions conspire with thermal noise to trigger anomalously slow sequences of plastic rearrangements, termed "thermal avalanches", which play an important role during creep and glassy relaxations. Here we uncover the complex spatiotemporal structure of thermal avalanches in simulations of a model amorphous solid. We systematically disentangle mechanical and thermal triggering during logarithmic creep, revealing a hierarchy of fast localized cascades linked by slow, long-range, noise-mediated facilitation. These thermal avalanches exhibit heavy-tailed temporal correlations, reminiscent of seismic activity. Our work sheds light on the rich relaxation dynamics of amorphous solids, while providing a framework for identifying noise-mediated correlations. We validate this approach by revealing a similar hierarchy in experiments with crumpled thin sheets.

Title: Learning and Testing Inverse Statistical Problems For Interacting Systems Undergoing Phase Transition
Authors: Stefano Bae, Dario Bocchi, Luca Maria Del Bono, Luca Leuzzi
Abstract: Inverse problems arise in situations where data is available, but the underlying model is not. It can therefore be necessary to infer the parameters of the latter starting from the former. Statistical mechanics offers a toolbox of techniques to address this challenge. In this work, we illustrate three of the main methods: the Maximum Likelihood, Maximum Pseudo-Likelihood, and Mean-Field approaches. We begin with a thorough theoretical introduction to these methods, followed by their application to inference in several well-known statistical physics systems undergoing phase transitions. Namely, we consider the ordered and disordered Ising models, the vector Potts model, and the Blume-Capel model on both regular lattices and random graphs. This discussion is accompanied by a GitHub repository that allows users to both reproduce the results and experiment with new systems.

Title: A unifying approach to self-organizing systems interacting via conservation laws
Authors: Frank Barrows, Guanming Zhang, Satyam Anand, Zizi Chen, Jonathan Lin, Amman Desai, Stefano Martiniani, Francesco Caravelli
Abstract: We present a unified framework for embedding and analyzing dynamical systems using generalized projection operators rooted in local conservation laws. By representing physical, biological, and engineered systems as graphs with incidence and cycle matrices, we derive dual projection operators that decompose network fluxes and potentials. This formalism aligns with principles of non-equilibrium thermodynamics and captures a broad class of systems governed by flux-forcing relationships and local constraints. We extend this approach to collective dynamics through the PRojective Embedding of Dynamical Systems (PrEDS), which lifts low-dimensional dynamics into a high-dimensional space, enabling both replication and recovery of the original dynamics. When systems fall within the PrEDS class, their collective behavior can be effectively approximated through projection onto a mean-field space. We demonstrate the versatility of PrEDS across diverse domains, including resistive and memristive circuits, adaptive flow networks (e.g., slime molds), elastic string networks, and particle swarms. Notably, we establish a direct correspondence between PrEDS and swarm dynamics, revealing new insights into optimization and self-organization. Our results offer a general theoretical foundation for analyzing complex networked systems and for designing systems that self-organize through local interactions.

Title: Electron-hole tunnelling probed in de Haas - van Alphen oscillations in the (double) Dirac semimetal NbTe$_4$
Authors: Maximilian Daschner, F. Malte Grosche
Abstract: NbTe$_4$ undergoes multiple charge density wave transitions that have attracted great interest in this material for decades. Previous work has shown that the crystal obtains the space group P4/ncc (130) at temperatures below 50K which allows for the existence of eightfold degenerate double Dirac points in the band structure. We provide insights into the electronic structure of this material through density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and a rotation study of de Haas - van Alphen (dHvA) oscillations in the magnetic torque. We find that NbTe$_4$ exhibits magnetic breakdown orbits between electron and hole pockets.

Title: Statistical mechanics of vector Hopfield network near and above saturation
Authors: Flavio Nicoletti, Francesco D'Amico, Matteo Negri
Abstract: We study analytically and numerically a Hopfield fully-connected network with $d$-vector spins. These networks are models of associative memory that generalize the standard Hopfield with Ising spins. We study the equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium properties of the system, considering the system in its retrieval phase $\alpha<\alpha_c$ and beyond. We derive the Replica Symmetric solution for the equilibrium thermodynamics of the system, together with its phase diagram: we find that the retrieval phase of the network shrinks with growing spin dimension, having ultimately a vanishing critical capacity $\alpha_c\propto 1/d$ in the large $d$ limit. As a trade-off, we observe that in the same limit vector Hopfield networks are able to denoise corrupted input patterns in the first step of retrieval dynamics, up to very large capacities $\widetilde{\alpha}\propto d$. We also study the static properties of the system at zero temperature, considering the statistical properties of soft modes of the energy Hessian spectrum. We find that local minima of the energy landscape related to memory states have ungapped spectra with rare soft eigenmodes: these excitations are localized, their measure condensating on the noisiest neurons of the memory state.

Title: Thermodynamic potentials of metallic alloys in the undercooled liquid and solid glassy states
Authors: A.S. Makarov, R.A. Konchakov, N.P. Kobelev, V.A. Khonik
Abstract: We first present a comparative analysis of temperature evolution of the excess thermodynamic potentials (state functions), the enthalpy $\Delta H$, entropy $\Delta S$ and Gibbs free energy $\Delta \Phi$, determined for \textit{i}) undercooled melts using literature data and \textit{ii}) solid glassy state calculated on the basis of calorimetry measurements using an approach proposed recently. Three metallic alloys were taken as an example for data analysis. It is found that temperature dependences $\Delta H(T)$, $\Delta S(T)$ and $\Delta G(T)$ calculated with both approaches coincide in the supercooled liquid range (i.e. at temperatures $T_g<T<T_x$, where $T_g$ and $T_x$ are the glass transition and crystallization onset temperatures, respectively). However, the necessary conditions for this coincidence is the introduction of important changes to the above approach \textit{i}), which are related to the calculation of the melting entropy. We also introduce and calculate a dimensionless order parameter $\xi$, which changes in the range $0<\xi<1$ and characterizes the evolution of the structural order from liquid-like to crystal-like one. It is shown that the order parameter $\xi_{scl}$ calculated for the end of the supercooled liquid range (i.e. for a temperature just below $T_x$) correlates with the melt critical cooling rate $R_c$: the smaller the order parameter $\xi_{scl}$ (i.e. the closer the structure to that of the equilibrium liquid), the smaller $R_c$ is.

Title: Mechanical enhancement of quantum oscillations
Authors: Maximilian Daschner, Ivan Kokanović, F. Malte Grosche
Abstract: We investigate quantum oscillation measurements in the Dirac nodal-line semimetal TaNiTe$_5$ which exhibit a strongly enhanced amplitude in the magnetoresistance. We show that mechanical properties of the measurement setup in combination with de Haas - van Alphen oscillations in the magnetic torque can cause this enhancement in the measured resistance, without involvement of any topological properties in this material. To support the empirical data, a numerical model is provided, showing good agreement.

Title: Importance of anisotropic interactions for hard-axis/plane ordering of Ce-based ferromagnets
Authors: Hanshang Jin, Rahim R. Ullah, Peter Klavins, Valentin Taufour
Abstract: Ferromagnetic (FM) Kondo-lattice (KL) compounds often exhibit intriguing magnetic behavior driven by strong crystal electric field (CEF) anisotropy and exchange interactions. Recent studies suggest that many Ce-based and Yb-based KL ferromagnets order along the hard-axis or hard-plane determined by their CEF ground state. We performed a survey of Ce-based FM compounds, complemented with new single crystal synthesis, magnetization measurements, and analysis of the CEF scheme. Our results reveal that hard-axis/plane ordering is less common than previously reported, with most compounds ordering along their easy-axis/plane. We also find no clear correlation between the strength of the Kondo effect and whether a compound adopts hard-axis/plane or easy-axis/plane ordering. Instead, the key driver appears to be the competition between CEF anisotropy and exchange interaction anisotropy. A direct comparison of CeCuSi and CeAgSb$_2$ further indicates that antiferromagnetic (AFM) interactions along the CEF easy-axis can be crucial in stabilizing the hard-axis FM ordering observed in CeAgSb$_2$. Finally, our results suggest that an anisotropic Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) model could offer deeper insights into the complicated magnetic properties of Ce-based and other heavy-fermion systems.

Title: Interplay of frustration and quantum fluctuations in a spin-1/2 anisotropic square lattice
Authors: L. M. Ramos, F. M. Zimmer, M. Schmidt
Abstract: Motivated by theoretical and experimental studies reported by Yamaguchi et al. (Phys. Rev. B 98, 094402 (2018)), we performed a cluster mean-field analysis of an anisotropic Heisenberg model with six competing exchange interactions. We study the ground and thermal states by tuning the spin anisotropy, magnetic field, and temperature. Our results show that an external magnetic field induces quantum fluctuations, suppressing local moments and leading to the occurrence of a magnetization plateaulike state. When weak spin anisotropy is considered, the competing interactions are affected, and the field-induced fluctuations can lead to a well-defined magnetization plateau within a field range, in which an exotic quantum state can emerge. This state exhibits the coexistence of ferromagnetic and dimerized chains driven by the relation between frustration and the external field. Moreover, we identify a phase transition from a collinear antiferromagnetic order to a disordered state at a finite temperature. Our findings reveal unconventional magnetic properties at low temperatures that can guide future experimental studies of verdazyl-based compounds with anisotropic exchange interactions.

Title: The covariance matrix spectrum of correlated charge insulators reveals hidden connections to Coupled Cluster, Matrix Product, and Rokhsar-Kivelson states
Authors: Izak Snyman, Serge Florens
Abstract: Charge ordering induced by strong short-range repulsion in itinerant fermion systems typically follows a two-sites alternation pattern. However, the covariance matrix spectrum of the one-dimensional, half-filled, spinless $t$-$V$ model reveals a post-Hartree-Fock picture at strong repulsion, with emergent four-site disruptions of the underlying staggered mean-field state. These disruptions are captured in a thermodynamically extensive manner by a compact four-fermion Coupled Cluster (doubles) state (CCS). Remarkably, all properties of this state may be computed analytically by combinatorial means, and also derived from an exactly solvable correlated hopping Hamiltonian. Furthermore, this Coupled Cluster state can be re-expressed as a low-rank Matrix Product State (MPS) with bond dimension exactly four. In addition, we unveil a hidden connection between this Coupled Cluster ansatz and a Rokhsar-Kivelson state (RKS), which is the ground state of a solvable parent quantum tetramer model. The broad picture that we uncover here thus provides deep connections between several core concepts of correlated fermions and quantum chemistry that have previously enjoyed limited synergy. In contrast to a recent perturbative treatment on top of Hartree-Fock theory, our approach asymptotically captures the correct correlations in the $t$-$V$ model at small $t/V$, and remains a qualitatively accurate approximation even outside the perturbative regime. Our results make the case for further studies of the covariance matrix for correlated electron systems in which ground states have non-trivial unit-cell structure.

Title: Pressure-induced band gap energy increase in crystalline lactose
Authors: Igor A. Fedorov
Abstract: Lactose is widely used in agri-food and pharma industries. New materials that can be obtained from renewable sources are currently being sought. I have studied the effect of hydrostatic pressure on structural properties of currently known forms of crystalline lactose within the framework of density functional theory with van der Waals interactions. The computed parameters have good agreement with experimental data. The effect of mechanical deformations on electron structure of crystalline lactose was also studied. Compression of the crystal leads to the band gap increase. The analysis of partial density of states of lactose crystals was performed. The band gap of different forms of crystalline lactose was also computed using the quasiparticle G0W0 approximation.

Title: Radical scaling: beyond our feet and fingers
Authors: Marc-Antoine Fardin, Mathieu Hautefeuille, Vivek Sharma
Abstract: Scaling laws arise and are eulogized across disciplines from natural to social sciences for providing pithy, quantitative, `scale-free', and `universal' power law relationships between two variables. On a log-log plot, the power laws display as straight lines, with a slope set by the exponent of the scaling law. In practice, a scaling relationship works only for a limited range, bookended by crossovers to other scaling laws. Leading with Taylor's oft-cited scaling law for the blast radius of an explosion against time, and by collating an unprecedented amount of datasets for laser-induced, chemical and nuclear explosions, we show distinct kinematics arise at the early and late stages. We illustrate that picking objective scales for the two axes using the transitions between regimes leads to the collapse of the data for the two regimes and their crossover, but the third regime is typically not mapped to the master curve. The objective scales permit us to abandon the arbitrarily chosen anthropocentric units of measurement, like feet for length and heart-beat for time, but the decimal system with ten digits (fingers) is still part of the picture. We show a remarkable collapse of all three regimes onto a common master curve occurs if we replace the base 10 by a dimensionless radix that combines the scales from the two crossovers. We also illustrate this approach of radical scaling for capillarity-driven pinching, coalescence and spreading of drops and bubbles, expecting such generalizations will be made for datasets across many disciplines.

Title: Single Photon Emitters in Ultra-Thin Hexagonal Boron Nitride Layers
Authors: Le Liu, Igor Khanonkin, Johannes Eberle, Bernhard Rizek, Stefan Fält, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Ataç Imamoğlu, Martin Kroner
Abstract: Single-photon emitters (SPE) in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) are promising for applications ranging from single-photon sources to quantum sensors. Previous studies exclusively focused on the generation and characterization of SPEs in relatively thick h-BN layers ($\geq$ 30 nm). However, for electrical and magnetic sensing applications, the thickness of the h-BN limits the attainable spatial resolution. Here, we report the observation of blue-wavelength emitters (B-centers) activated by electron beam irradiation in ultra-thin ($\simeq$ 3 nm) h-BN. These SPEs in ultra-thin flakes exhibit reduced brightness, broader zero-phonon line, and enhanced photobleaching. Remarkably, upon encapsulation in thicker h-BN, we restore their brightness, narrow linewidth 230$\mu$eV at 5K, resolution limited), suppress photobleaching, and confirm single-photon emission with $ g^{(2)}(0) < 0.4$ at room temperature. The possibility of generating SPEs in a few-layer h-BN and their subsequent incorporation into a van der Waals heterostructure paves the way for achieving quantum sensing with unprecedented nanometer-scale spatial resolution.

Title: Optimal boron-doped graphene substrate for glucose Raman signal enhancement
Authors: Jan Komeda, Antonio Cammarata, Tomas Polcar
Abstract: Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) is a highly sensitive and selective technique that greatly enhances the signal of an analyte, compared with its signal from classical Raman Spectroscopy, due to its interaction with a substrates surface. It has been shown that low concentration boron-doped graphene (B-graphene) enhances the Raman signal of simple organic molecules like pyridine. Recent studies also suggest that B-graphene can remain thermodynamically stable when doped with significantly higher concentrations of boron than previously observed. In this framework, we use quantum mechanical simulations to investigate the influence of dopant concentration and geometric distribution on the effectiveness of B-doped graphene as a SERS substrate, with glucose as analyte. By combining analysis of interatomic force constants and of phonon eigenvectors composition, we conclude that higher doping concentrations provide a larger enhancement to glucose's Raman signal, while the molecule orientation relative to the surface plays a fundamental role in the Raman response. We suggest that high concentration B-graphene presents itself as a potential substrate for SERS based detection of glucose, while the used phonon-based analysis can be promptly applied for the search of promising candidates as substrate materials for enhanced Raman response.

Title: Solving the Hubbard model with Neural Quantum States
Authors: Yuntian Gu, Wenrui Li, Heng Lin, Bo Zhan, Ruichen Li, Yifei Huang, Di He, Yantao Wu, Tao Xiang, Mingpu Qin, Liwei Wang, Dingshun Lv
Abstract: The rapid development of neural quantum states (NQS) has established it as a promising framework for studying quantum many-body systems. In this work, by leveraging the cutting-edge transformer-based architectures and developing highly efficient optimization algorithms, we achieve the state-of-the-art results for the doped two-dimensional (2D) Hubbard model, arguably the minimum model for high-Tc superconductivity. Interestingly, we find different attention heads in the NQS ansatz can directly encode correlations at different scales, making it capable of capturing long-range correlations and entanglements in strongly correlated systems. With these advances, we establish the half-filled stripe in the ground state of 2D Hubbard model with the next nearest neighboring hoppings, consistent with experimental observations in cuprates. Our work establishes NQS as a powerful tool for solving challenging many-fermions systems.

Walko, Haidan Wen, Svetlana V. Boriskina, Gang Chen, Jeehwan Kim, Mingda Li
Abstract: Efficient thermal management is essential for the reliability of modern power electronics, where increasing device density leads to severe heat dissipation challenges. However, in thin-film systems, thermal transport is often compromised by interfacial resistance and microscale defects introduced during synthesis or transfer, which are difficult to characterize using conventional techniques. Here we present a non-contact, spatiotemporal-resolved ultrafast x-ray diffraction method to extract in-plane thermal conductivity and thermal boundary conductance, using GaN thin films on silicon as a model system. By tracking the pump-induced lattice strain, we reconstruct the lateral heat flow dynamics and quantitatively probe thermal transport near a wrinkle defect. We uncover pronounced asymmetric heat dissipation across the wrinkle, with a four-fold reduction in the local thermal conductivity near the wrinkle and a 25% drop in interfacial conductance. Our work demonstrates that ultrafast x-ray diffraction can serve as a precise thermal metrology tool for characterizing heat transport in multilayered thin-film structures for next-generation microelectronic devices.

Title: A finite element implementation of a large deformation gradient-damage theory for fracture with Abaqus user material subroutines
Authors: Keven Alkhoury, Shawn A. Chester, Vikas Srivastava
Abstract: Recent advancements in computations have enabled the application of various modeling approaches to predict fracture and failure, such as the gradient-damage (phasefield) method. Several existing studies have leveraged the heat equation solver in Abaqus to model gradient-damage, due to its mathematical resemblance to the heat equation. Particular care is required when extending the approach to large deformation scenarios due to differences in the referential and spatial configurations, especially since the heat equation in Abaqus is solved in the spatial configuration, whereas most gradient-damage frameworks are formulated in the referential configuration. This work provides a pedagogic view of an appropriate Abaqus implementation of a gradient-damage theory for fracture in materials undergoing large deformation using Abaqus UMAT and UMATHT user subroutines. Key benchmark problems from the literature are used to demonstrate the robustness of our implementation across various materials exhibiting different constitutive behaviors, such as non-linear elasticity, linear elasticity, and large deformation rate-dependent plasticity, ensuring its applicability regardless of the specific material constitutive choice. The details of the implementation, along with the codes, which are a direct outcome of this work, are also provided.

Title: Diffusive charge transport in the gapped 1D Hubbard model at all finite temperatures
Authors: J.M.P. Carmelo, P.D. Sacramento
Abstract: Studies relying on hydrodynamic theory and Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) scaling have found that in the one-dimensional Hubbard model spin and charge transport are for all temperatures T > 0 anomalous superdiffusive at zero magnetic field, h = 0, and zero chemical potential, {\mu} = 0, respectively. However, this contradicts recent exact results that at very low temperature charge transport rather is normal diffusive. In this Letter we identify the mechanisms that control the different types of temperature dependence of the h = 0 spin and {\mu} = 0 charge transport and find that the latter is normal diffusive for all finite temperatures T > 0, in contrast to the hydrodynamic theory and KPZ scaling predictions.

Title: Spin Caloritronics in irradiated chiral ferromagnetic systems
Authors: Sudin Ganguly, Moumita Dey, Santanu K. Maiti
Abstract: We study the charge and spin-dependent thermoelectric response of a ferromagnetic helical system irradiated by arbitrarily polarized light, using a tight-binding framework and the Floquet-Bloch formalism. Transport properties for individual spin channels are determined by employing the non-equilibrium Green's function technique, while phonon thermal conductance is evaluated using a mass-spring model with different lead materials. The findings reveal that that light irradiation induces spin-split transmission features, suppresses thermal conductance, and yields favorable spin thermopower and figure of merit (FOM). The spin FOM consistently outperforms its charge counterpart under various light conditions. Moreover, long-range hopping is shown to enhance the spin thermoelectric performance, suggesting a promising strategy for efficient energy conversion in related ferromagnetic systems.

Title: Analytic Phase Solution and Point Vortex Model for Dipolar Quantum Vortices
Authors: Ryan Doran, Thomas Bland
Abstract: We derive an analytic expression for the phase of a quantum vortex in a dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate, capturing anisotropic effects from long-range dipole-dipole interactions. This solution provides a foundation for a dipolar point vortex model (DPVM), incorporating both phase-driven flow and dipolar forces. The DPVM reproduces key features of vortex pair dynamics seen in full simulations, including anisotropic velocities, deformed orbits, and directional motion, offering a minimal and accurate model for dipolar vortex dynamics. Our results open the door to analytic studies of vortices in dipolar quantum matter and establish a new platform for exploring vortex dynamics and turbulence in these systems.

Title: Ultrafast optical excitation of magnons in 2D antiferromagnets via spin torque exerted by photocurrent of excitons: Signatures in charge pumping and THz emission
Authors: Jalil Varela-Manjarres, Yafei Ren, Branislav K. Nikolic
Abstract: Recent experiments observing femtosecond laser pulse (fsLP) exciting magnons within two-dimensional (2D) antiferromagnetic (AF) semiconductors -- such as CrSBr, NiPS$_3$, and MnPS$_3$, or their van der Waals heterostructures -- suggest exciton-mediation of such an effect. However, its microscopic details remain obscure as resonant coupling of magnons, living in the sub-meV energy range, to excitons, living in \mbox{$\sim 1$ eV} range, can hardly be operative. Here, we develop a quantum transport theory of this effect, in which time-dependent nonequilibrium Green's function (TDNEF) for electrons driven by classical vector potential of fsLP are coupled to the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation describing classical dynamics of localized magnetic moments (LMMs) within 2D AF semiconductor. Our TDNEGF+LLG theory explains how fsLP, with central frequency above the semiconductor gap, generates a photocurrent that subsequently exerts spin-transfer torque (STT) onto LMMs as a genuine nonequilibrium spintronic effect. The collective motion of LMMs analyzed by windowed Fast Fourier transform (FFT) reveals frequencies of excited magnons, as well as their lifetime governed by nonlocal damping due to the bath of electrons. In addition, the TDNEGF part of our TDNEGF+LLG self-consistent loop computes a time-dependent density matrix whose off-diagonal elements are utilized to describe, at the mean-field level, inter-orbital Coulomb interaction binding electrons and holes into excitons. Our TDNEGF+LLG theory predicts how excited magnons {\em pump} charge current into the attached electrodes, or locally within AF semiconductor responsible for microwave emission. The windowed FFT of the former signal contains imprints of excited magnons, as well as their interaction with excitons, which could be exploited as a novel probe in future experiments.

Title: Tailoring the Electronic Properties of Monoclinic (InxAl1-x)2O3 Alloys via Substitutional Donors and Acceptors
Authors: Mohamed Abdelilah Fadla, Myrta Grüning, Lorenzo Stella
Abstract: Ultra-wide bandgap semiconductors such as \b{eta}-Ga2O3 are ideal materials for next-generation power electronic devices. Electronic and mechanical properties of \b{eta}-Ga2O3 can be tuned by alloying with other sesquioxides, notably Al2O3 and In2O3. Moreover, by tuning the In content of a (InxAl1-x)2O3 alloy, its lattice constants can be matched to those of Ga2O3, while preserving a large conduction-band offset. In view of potential applications to \b{eta}-Ga2O3-based heterostructure, we performed atomistic modelling of (InxAl1-x)2O3 alloys using density functional theory to investigate thermodynamic and electrical properties of conventional group IV dopants (Si, Sn, C, Ge), alternative metal donors (Ta, Zr, Hf), and acceptors (Mg, Zn, Cu). The hybrid Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof functional (HSE06) is used to accurately quantify the defect formation energies, ionization levels, and concentrations over a wide range of experimentally relevant conditions for the oxygen chemical potential and temperature. In our atomistic models, Hf and Zr show favourable properties as alternative donors to Si and other group IV impurities, especially under oxygen-poor conditions. Our findings also suggest that acceptors Mg, Zn, and Cu, while they cannot promote p-doping, can be still beneficial for the compensation of unintentionally n-doped materials, e.g., to generate semi-insulating layers and improve rectification.

Title: Prediction of synthesis parameters for N, Si, Ge and Sn diamond vacancy centers using machine learning
Authors: Zhi Jiang, Marco Peres, Carlo Bradac, Gil Gonçalves
Abstract: Diamond and diamond color centers have become prime hardware candidates for solid state-based technologies in quantum information and computing, optics, photonics and (bio)sensing. The synthesis of diamond materials with specific characteristics and the precise control of the hosted color centers is thus essential to meet the demands of advanced applications. Yet, challenges remain in improving the concentration, uniform distribution and quality of these centers. Here we perform a review and meta-analysis of some of the main diamond synthesis methods and their parameters for the synthesis of N-, Si-, Ge- and Sn-vacancy color-centers, including worldwide trends in fabrication techniques and processes. We extract quantitative data from over 60 experimental papers and organize it in a large database (170 data sets and 1692 entries). We then use the database to train two machine learning algorithms to make robust predictions about the fabrication of diamond materials with specific properties from careful combinations of synthesis parameters. We use traditional statistical indicators to benchmark the performance of the algorithms and show that they are powerful and resource-efficient tools for researchers and material scientists working with diamond color centers and their applications.

Title: Helicons in tilted-Weyl semimetals
Authors: Shiv Kumar Ram, Amit Gupta
Abstract: Helicons are transverse electromagnetic modes in three-dimensional (3D) electron systems in the presence of a static magnetic field. These modes have been proposed in isotropic or single Weyl semimetals(WSMs) (Francesco M.D. Pellegrino et al, Phys.\ Rev.\ B {\bf 92}, 201407(R) (2015)). In this work, we introduce a tilt term to investigate helicon modes in gapless WSMs within a semiclassical Boltzmann approach and show that the helicon modes exist in tilted WSMs.

Title: Electric Field Induced Superconductivity in Bilayer Octagraphene
Authors: Yitong Yao, Jun Li, Jiacheng Ye, Fan Yang, Dao-Xin Yao
Abstract: We investigate the energy bands, magnetism, and superconductivity of bilayer octagraphene with A-A stacking under a perpendicular electric field. A tight-binding model is used to analyze the band structure of the system. The doubling of the unit cell results in each band of the single layer splitting into two. We find that applying a perpendicular electric field increases the band splitting. As the electric field strength increases, the nesting of the Fermi Surface(FS) weakens, eventually disrupting the antiferromagnetic order and bilayer octagraphene exhibits superconductivity. Spin fluctuations can induce unconventional superconductivity with s+--wave pairing. Applying a perpendicular electric field to bilayer octagraphene parent weakens the nesting of the FS, ultimately killing the spin-density-wave (SDW) ordered state and transitioning it into the superconducting state, whichworks as a doping effect. We use the random-phase approximation approach to obtain the pairing eigenvalues and pairing symmetries of the perpendicular electric field-tuned bilayer octagraphene in the weak coupling limit. By tuning the strength of the perpendicular electric field, the critical interaction strength for SDW order can be modified, which in turn may promote the emergence of unconventional superconductivity.

Title: On the non-integrability of driven-dissipative one-dimensional hard-core bosons
Authors: Martina Zündel
Abstract: In one dimension, in a closed system, the Tonks-Girardau gas is integrable even for finite temperatures and time-evolving systems. We address the question if it remains integrable once the system is no longer closed. We consider its lattice version under incoherent local pump and loss and show by using random matrix theory that the statistics of the complex spatial ratio indicates that the system is chaotic. Further, we show that the model belongs in the AI$^{\dagger}$ universality class of random matrices. In addition to this analysis, we investigate an emergent stripe-pattern in the spectrum and relate it to the dissipative parameters of the model.

Title: Inclined flow of a second-gradient incompressible fluid with pressure-dependent viscosity
Authors: C. Balitactac, C. Rodriguez
Abstract: Many viscous liquids behave effectively as incompressible under high pressures but display a pronounced dependence of viscosity on pressure. The classical incompressible Navier-Stokes model cannot account for both features, and a simple pressure-dependent modification introduces questions about the well-posedness of the resulting equations. This paper presents the first study of a second-gradient extension of the incompressible Navier-Stokes model, recently introduced by the authors, which includes higher-order spatial derivatives, pressure-sensitive viscosities, and complementary boundary conditions. Focusing on steady flow down an inclined plane, we adopt Barus' exponential law and impose weak adherence at the lower boundary and a prescribed ambient pressure at the free surface. Through numerical simulations, we examine how the flow profile varies with the angle of inclination, ambient pressure, viscosity sensitivity to pressure, and internal length scale.

Title: Growth of block diagonal operators and symmetry-resolved Krylov complexity
Authors: Pawel Caputa, Giuseppe Di Giulio, Tran Quang Loc
Abstract: This work addresses how the growth of invariant operators is influenced by their underlying symmetry structure. For this purpose, we introduce the symmetry-resolved Krylov complexity, which captures the time evolution of each block into which an operator, invariant under a given symmetry, can be decomposed. We find that, at early times, the complexity of the full operator is equal to the average of the symmetry-resolved contributions. At later times, however, the interplay among different charge sectors becomes more intricate. In general, the symmetry-resolved Krylov complexity depends on the charge sector, although in some cases this dependence disappears, leading to a form of Krylov complexity equipartition. Our analysis lays the groundwork for a broader application of symmetry structures in the study of Krylov space complexities with implications for thermalization and universality in many-body quantum systems.

Title: Topological Reality Switch: Towards Bulk-Boundary Selective Lasing
Authors: Sayed Ali Akbar Ghorashi, Masatoshi Sato
Abstract: The emergence of complex spectra in non-Hermitian systems causes dramatic changes even under weak perturbations, significantly hindering their precise control for study and integration into practical applications. Achieving a controlled method to generate a real spectrum in non-Hermitian systems has long been a key objective in the field. In this study, we explore the 2D non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model and introduce a reality switch that allows for the controllable induction of a real spectrum depending on the imposed boundary condition. We show that a topological phase transition in the complex gap accompanies the switching process. Our work lays the cornerstone for developing a selective bulk-boundary control mechanism for the gain and lasing behaviors in non-Hermitian systems.

Title: Particle deposit patterns from evaporation of a sessile colloidal droplet
Authors: A. Mokhtari, M. AitSaada, S. Chikh, L. Tadrist
Abstract: The present work investigates numerically the transport of colloidal particles within an evaporating sessile droplet and their deposition on the substrate in unfavourable conditions. The coupled phenomena of fluid flow and heat and mass transfer with phase change are modelled by taking into account for the evaporative cooling effect, the surface tension gradient effect at liquid air interface and the particles-substrate interaction effect due to DLVO attractive this http URL results show that in presence of the particles-substrate interaction, the outward radial internal flow is the main responsible for the coffee ring effect giving rise a ring like pattern with inner traces, while the thermal Marangoni internal flow reduces this effect giving rise a uniform deposit with a dark periphery.

Title: Examining the Anomalous Nature of Chiral Effects in Thermodynamics
Authors: Rémy Larue, Jérémie Quevillon, Diego Saviot
Abstract: Quantum anomalies give rise to novel transport phenomena, including the generation of a current in a relativistic fluid due to the presence of magnetic field or vorticity. We present an exclusive and direct computation of the chiral anomaly within the path integral for a massless fermion on a generic electromagnetic and curved background, including local temperature and chemical potential. We identify new thermodynamical contributions to the anomaly which induce the Chiral Separation and Vortical Effects. Additionally, we show that the anomaly fully vanishes at global equilibrium.

Title: Subwavelength Localisation in Nonreciprocal Disordered Systems
Authors: Habib Ammari, Silvio Barandun, Clemens Thalhammer, Alexander Uhlmann
Abstract: We investigate the competing mechanisms of localisation in one-dimensional disordered block subwavelength resonator systems subject to nonreciprocal damping, induced by an imaginary gauge potential. Using a symmetrisation approach to enable the adaptation of tools from Hermitian systems, we derive the limiting spectral distribution of these systems as the number of blocks goes to infinity and characterise their spectral properties in terms of the spectral properties of their constituent blocks. By employing a transfer matrix approach, we then clarify, in terms of Lyapunov exponents, the competition between the edge localisation due to imaginary gauge potentials and the bulk localisation due to disorder. In particular, we demonstrate how the disorder acts as insulation, preventing edge localisation for small imaginary gauge potentials.

Title: Scattering States in One-Dimensional Non-Hermitian Baths
Authors: Jimin Li, Yuwen E. Zhang, Franco Nori, Zongping Gong
Abstract: A single quantum emitter coupled to a structured non-Hermitian environment shows anomalous bound states and real-time dynamics without Hermitian counterparts, as shown in [Gong et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 223601 (2022)]. In this work, we establish a general approach for studying the scattering states of a single quantum emitter coupled to one-dimensional non-Hermitian single-band baths. We formally solve the exact eigenvalue equation for all the scattering states defined on finite periodic lattices. In the thermodynamic limit, the formal solution reduces to the celebrated Lippmann-Schwinger equation for generic baths. In this case, we find that the scattering states are no longer linear superpositions of plane waves in general, unlike those in Hermitian systems; Instead, the wave functions exhibit a large, yet finite localization length proportional to the lattice size. Furthermore, we show and discuss the cases where the Lippmann-Schwinger equation breaks down. We find the analytical solutions for the Hatano-Nelson and unidirectional next-to-nearest-neighbor baths in the thermodynamic limit.

Title: A semi-analytical solution for the lubrication force between two spheres approaching in viscoelastic fluids described by the Oldroyd-B model under small Deborah numbers
Authors: Alan Rosales-Romero, Adolfo Vázquez-Quesada, Marco Ellero, J. Esteban López-Aguilar
Abstract: Viscoelastic fluids play a critical role in various engineering and biological applications, where their lubrication properties are strongly influenced by relaxation times ranging from microseconds to minutes. Although the lubrication mechanism for Newtonian fluids is well-established, its extension to viscoelastic materials - particularly under squeezing flow conditions - remains less explored. This study presents a semi-analytical solution for the lubrication force between two spheres approaching in a Boger fluid under small Deborah numbers. Unlike previous works that assumed a Newtonian velocity field, we derive the velocity profile directly from the mass-momentum conservation and Oldroyd-B constitutive equations using lubrication theory and order-of-magnitude analysis techniques. Under steady-state conditions, viscoelasticity induces a marginal increase in the surface-to-surface normal force as a result of the increased pressure required to overcome the original resistance from the first normal-stress difference. Transient analyses reveal that the normal lubrication force is bounded by two Newtonian plateaus and is nonsymmetric as the spheres approach or separate. Our findings highlight the role of viscoelasticity in improving load capacity and provide new insight for modelling dense particle suspensions in Boger fluids, where short-range interactions dominate.

Title: Mixed-state phases from local reversibility
Authors: Shengqi Sang, Leonardo A. Lessa, Roger S. K. Mong, Tarun Grover, Chong Wang, Timothy H. Hsieh
Abstract: We propose a refined definition of mixed-state phase equivalence based on locally reversible channel circuits. We show that such circuits preserve topological degeneracy and the locality of all operators including both strong and weak symmetries. Under a locally reversible channel, weak unitary symmetries are locally dressed into channel symmetries, a new generalization of symmetry for open quantum systems. For abelian higher-form symmetries, we show the refined definition preserves anomalies and spontaneous breaking of such symmetries within a phase. As a primary example, a two-dimensional classical loop ensemble is trivial under the previously adopted definition of mixed-state phases. However, it has non-trivial topological degeneracy arising from a mutual anomaly between strong and weak 1-form symmetries, and our results show that it is not connected to a trivial state via locally reversible channel circuits.

Title: Quantum Mpemba Effects from Symmetry Perspectives
Authors: Hui Yu, Shuo Liu, Shi-Xin Zhang
Abstract: Non-equilibrium dynamics have become a central research focus, exemplified by the counterintuitive Mpemba effect where initially hotter systems can cool faster than colder ones. Studied extensively in both classical and quantum regimes, this phenomenon reveals diverse and complex behaviors across different systems. This review provides a concise overview of the quantum Mpemba effect (QME), specifically emphasizing its connection to symmetry breaking and restoration in closed quantum many-body systems. We begin by outlining the classical Mpemba effect and its quantum counterparts, summarizing key findings. Subsequently, we introduce entanglement asymmetry and charge variance as key metrics for probing the QME from symmetry perspectives. Leveraging these tools, we analyze the early- and late-time dynamics of these quantities under Hamiltonian evolution and random unitary circuits. We conclude by discussing significant challenges and promising avenues for future research.

Title: An Ultra-Cold Mechanical Quantum Sensor for Tests of New Physics
Authors: Andraz Omahen, Simon Storz, Marius Bild, Dario Scheiwiller, Matteo Fadel, Yiwen Chu
Abstract: Initialization of mechanical modes in the quantum ground state is crucial for their use in quantum information and quantum sensing protocols. In quantum processors, impurity of the modes' initial state affects the infidelity of subsequent quantum algorithms. In quantum sensors, excitations out of the ground state contribute to the noise of the detector, and their prevalence puts a bound on rare events that deposit energy into the mechanical modes. In this work, we measure the excited-state populations of GHz-frequency modes in a high-overtone bulk acoustic wave resonator (HBAR). We find that the population of the first excited state can be as low as $P_p$=(1.2$\pm$5.5)$\times10^{-5}$, corresponding to an effective temperature of 25.2 mK, which are upper bounds limited by imperfections in the measurement process. These results compare favorably to the lowest populations measured in superconducting circuits. Finally, we use the measured populations to constrain the amplitude of high-frequency gravitational waves, the kinetic mixing strength of ultra-light dark matter, and non-linear modifications of the Schrödinger equation describing wavefunction collapse mechanisms. Our work establishes HBARs as a versatile resource for quantum state initialization and studies of fundamental physics.

Title: Cosmic structure from the path integral of classical mechanics and its comparison to standard perturbation theory
Authors: Marvin Sipp, Hannes Heisler, Matthias Bartelmann
Abstract: We investigate cosmic structure formation in the framework of a path-integral formulation of an $N$-particle ensemble in phase space, dubbed Resummed Kinetic Field Theory (RKFT), up to one-loop perturbative order. In particular, we compute power spectra of the density contrast, the divergence and curl of the momentum density and arbitrary $n$-point cumulants of the stress tensor. In contrast to earlier works, we propose a different method of sampling initial conditions, with a Gaussian initial phase-space density. Doing so, we exactly reproduce the corresponding results from Eulerian standard perturbation theory (SPT) at one-loop order, showing that formerly found deviations can be fully attributed to inconsistencies in the previous sampling method. Since, in contrast to SPT, the full phase-space description does not assume a truncation of the Vlasov hierarchy, our findings suggest that non-perturbative techniques are required to accurately capture the physics of cosmic structure formation.

Title: Super high capacity of silicon carbon anode over 6500 mAh g-1 for lithium battery
Authors: Shisheng Lin, Minhui Yang, Zhuang Zhao, Mingjia Zhi, Xiaokai Bai
Abstract: As silicon is approaching its theoretical limit for the anode materials in lithium battery, searching for a higher limit is indispensable. Herein, we demonstrate the possible of achieving ultrahigh capacity over 6500 mAh g-1 in silicon-carbon composites. Considering the numerous defects inside the silicon nanostructures, it is deduced the formation of quasi-Bose Einstein condensation should be possible, which can lead to the low viscosity flow of lithium-ions through the anode. At a charge-discharge rate of 0.1C (0.42 A g-1), the initial discharge specific capacity reaches 6694.21 mAh g-1, with a Coulomb efficiency (CE) of 74.71%, significantly exceeding the theoretical capacity limit of silicon. Further optimization of the anode material ratio results in improved cycling stability, with a discharge specific capacity of 5542.98 mAh g-1 and a CE of 85.25% at 0.1C. When the initial discharge capacity is 4043.01 mAh g-1, the CE rises to 86.13%. By training a multilayer perceptron with material parameters as inputs and subsequently optimizing it using a constrained genetic algorithm, an initial discharge specific capacity of up to 7789.55 mAh g-1 can be achieved theoretically. This study demonstrates that silicon-carbon composites have great potential to significantly enhance the energy density of lithium-ion batteries.

Title: Designs from magic-augmented Clifford circuits
Authors: Yuzhen Zhang, Sagar Vijay, Yingfei Gu, Yimu Bao
Abstract: We introduce magic-augmented Clifford circuits -- architectures in which Clifford circuits are preceded and/or followed by constant-depth circuits of non-Clifford (``magic") gates -- as a resource-efficient way to realize approximate $k$-designs, with reduced circuit depth and usage of magic. We prove that shallow Clifford circuits, when augmented with constant-depth circuits of magic gates, can generate approximate unitary and state $k$-designs with $\epsilon$ relative error. The total circuit depth for these constructions on $N$ qubits is $O(\log (N/\epsilon)) +2^{O(k\log k)}$ in one dimension and $O(\log\log(N/\epsilon))+2^{O(k\log k)}$ in all-to-all circuits using ancillas, which improves upon previous results for small $k \geq 4$. Furthermore, our construction of relative-error state $k$-designs only involves states with strictly local magic. The required number of magic gates is parametrically reduced when considering $k$-designs with bounded additive error. As an example, we show that shallow Clifford circuits followed by $O(k^2)$ single-qubit magic gates, independent of system size, can generate an additive-error state $k$-design. We develop a classical statistical mechanics description of our random circuit architectures, which provides a quantitative understanding of the required depth and number of magic gates for additive-error state $k$-designs. We also prove no-go theorems for various architectures to generate designs with bounded relative error.

Title: Early time hydrodynamic attractor in a nearly-unitary Fermi gas
Authors: Michal P. Heller, Clemens Werthmann
Abstract: The hydrodynamic attractors paradigm aims to explain fast applicability of hydrodynamics at ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions at RHIC and LHC in terms of the emergence of a universal behaviour across different initial states. The attractors observed in theoretical models are first driven by a rapid expansion of matter, which later gives way to the decay of exponentially damped transient excitations into the viscous fluid regime. Recently a theoretical proposal was made how to realize hydrodynamic attractors in cold atomic gases focusing on the decay of transients and opening prospects for a future experimental realization in table top experiments. Motivated by this, in the present paper we show how the far-from-equilibrium, expansion-driven part of the hydrodynamic attractor emerges in a model of a nearly-unitary Fermi gas dynamics under full theoretical control.

Title: Imprints of information scrambling on eigenstates of a quantum chaotic system
Authors: Bikram Pain, Ratul Thakur, Sthitadhi Roy
Abstract: How are the spatial and temporal patterns of information scrambling in locally interacting quantum many-body systems imprinted on the eigenstates of the system's time-evolution operator? We address this question by identifying statistical correlations among sets of minimally four eigenstates that provide a unified framework for various measures of information scrambling. These include operator mutual information and operator entanglement entropy of the time-evolution operator, as well as more conventional diagnostics such as two-point dynamical correlations and out-of-time-ordered correlators. We demonstrate this framework by deriving exact results for eigenstate correlations in a minimal model of quantum chaos -- Floquet dual-unitary circuits. These results reveal not only the butterfly effect and the information lightcone, but also finer structures of scrambling within the lightcone. Our work thus shows how the eigenstates of a chaotic system can encode the full spatiotemporal anatomy of quantum chaos, going beyond the descriptions offered by random matrix theory and the eigenstate thermalisation hypothesis.

Title: Emergent interaction-driven elliptic flow of few fermionic atoms
Authors: Sandra Brandstetter, Philipp Lunt, Carl Heintze, Giuliano Giacalone, Lars H. Heyen, Maciej Gałka, Keerthan Subramanian, Marvin Holten, Philipp M. Preiss, Stefan Floerchinger, Selim Jochim
Abstract: Hydrodynamics provides a successful framework to effectively describe the dynamics of complex many-body systems ranging from subnuclear to cosmological scales by introducing macroscopic quantities such as particle densities and fluid velocities. According to textbook knowledge, it requires coarse graining over microscopic constituents to define a macroscopic fluid cell, which is large compared to the interparticle spacing and the mean free path. In addition, the entire system must consist of many such fluid cells. In high energy heavy ion collisions, hydrodynamic behaviour is inferred from the observation of elliptic flow. Here, we demonstrate the emergence of elliptic flow in a system of few strongly interacting atoms. In our system a hydrodynamic description is a priori not applicable, as all relevant length scales, i.e. the system size, the inter-particle spacing, and the mean free path are comparable. The single particle resolution, deterministic control over particle number and interaction strength in our experiment allow us to explore the boundaries between a microscopic description and a hydrodynamic framework in unprecedented detail.

Title: Quantum Magnetic Skyrmions on Kondo-type Lattices
Authors: Zhen Zhao, Emil Östberg, Ferdi Aryasetiawan, Claudio Verdozzi
Abstract: A quantum description is given of nanoskyrmions in 2D textures with localised spins and itinerant electrons, isolated or coupled to leads, in or out-of-equilibrium. The spin-electron exchange is treated at the mean-field level, while Tensor Networks and exact diagonalization or nonequilibrium Green's functions are used for localised spins and itinerant electrons. We motivate our scheme via exact and mean-field benchmarks, then show by several examples that itinerant electrons distinctly affect the properties of quantum nanoskyrmions. Finally, we mention lines of future work and improvement of the approach.

Title: Dissipative realization of Kondo models
Authors: Martino Stefanini, Yi-Fan Qu, Tilman Esslinger, Sarang Gopalakrishnan, Eugene Demler, Jamir Marino
Abstract: We demonstrate that the Kondo effect can be induced through non-linear dissipative channels, without requiring any coherent interaction on the impurity site. Specifically, we consider a reservoir of noninteracting fermions that can hop on a few impurity sites that are subjected to strong two-body losses. In the simplest case of a single lossy site, we recover the Anderson impurity model in the regime of infinite repulsion, with a small residual dissipation as a perturbation. While the Anderson model gives rise to the Kondo effect, this residual dissipation competes with it, offering an instance of a nonlinear dissipative impurity where the interplay between coherent and incoherent dynamics emerges from the same underlying physical process. We further outline how this dissipative engineering scheme can be extended to two or more lossy sites, realizing generalizations of the Kondo model with spin 1 or higher. Our results suggest alternative implementations of Kondo models using ultracold atoms in transport experiments, where localized dissipation can be naturally introduced, and the Kondo effect observed through conductance measurements.

Title: Stable singular fractional skyrmion spin texture from the quantum Kelvin-Helmholtz instability
Authors: SeungJung Huh, Wooyoung Yun, Gabin Yun, Samgyu Hwang, Kiryang Kwon, Junhyeok Hur, Seungho Lee, Hiromitsu Takeuchi, Se Kwon Kim, Jae-yoon Choi
Abstract: Topology profoundly influences diverse fields of science, providing a powerful framework for classifying phases of matter and predicting nontrivial excitations, such as solitons, vortices, and skyrmions. These topological defects are typically characterized by integer numbers, called topological charges, representing the winding number in their order parameter field. The classification and prediction of topological defects, however, become challenging when singularities are included within the integration domain for calculating the topological charge. While such exotic nonlinear excitations have been proposed in the superfluid $^3$He-A phase and spinor Bose-Einstein condensate of atomic gases, experimental observation of these structures and studies of their stability have long been elusive. Here we report the observation of a singular skyrmion that goes beyond the framework of topology in a ferromagnetic superfluid. The exotic skyrmions are sustained by undergoing anomalous symmetry breaking associated with the eccentric spin singularity and carry half of the elementary charge, distinctive from conventional skyrmions or merons. By successfully realizing the universal regime of the quantum Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, we identified the eccentric fractional skyrmions, produced by emission from a magnetic domain wall and a spontaneous splitting of an integer skyrmion with spin singularities. The singular skyrmions are stable and can be observed after 2~s of hold time. Our results confirm the universality between classical and quantum Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities and broaden our understanding on complex nonlinear dynamics of nontrivial texture beyond skyrmion in topological quantum systems.

Title: Theory of Casimir Forces: A Unified Approach Using Finite-Temperature Field Theory
Authors: P.E. Brandyshev, Yu.A. Budkov
Abstract: We present a quantum theory of Casimir forces between perfect electrical conductors, based on quantum electrodynamics and quantum statistical physics. This theory utilizes Kapusta's finite-temperature quantum field theory, combined with the Faddeev-Popov ghost formalism. This approach allows us to calculate Casimir forces at finite temperatures, providing both previously known and new physical insights from a unified perspective. Furthermore, our method enables us to compute the stress tensor associated with Casimir forces, in accordance with the Helmholtz free energy of an equilibrium quantum electromagnetic field. Using this methodology, we calculate the excess surface tension on the walls of slit-like pores due to the Casimir effect.

Title: Magnifying the Wave Function of Interacting Fermionic Atoms
Authors: Sandra Brandstetter, Carl Heintze, Paul Hill, Philipp M. Preiss, Maciej Gałka, Selim Jochim
Abstract: Understanding many body systems is a key challenge in physics. Single atom resolved imaging techniques have unlocked access to microscopic correlations in ultracold quantum gases. However they cannot be used when the relevant length scales are obscured by the resolution of the detection technique. We present a matterwave magnification scheme, based on evolutions in optical potentials, tailored to magnify the wave function of atoms, such that all length scales can be resolved. To showcase this method, we image atoms in the strongly interacting regime, establishing a new way to characterize correlated systems.

Title: Activation entropy of dislocation glide in body-centered cubic metals from atomistic simulations
Authors: Arnaud Allera, Thomas D. Swinburne, Alexandra M. Goryaeva, Baptiste Bienvenu, Fabienne Ribeiro, Michel Perez, Mihai-Cosmin Marinica, David Rodney
Abstract: The activation entropy of dislocation glide, a key process controlling the strength of many metals, is often assumed to be constant or linked to enthalpy through the empirical Meyer-Neldel law-both of which are simplified approximations. In this study, we take a more direct approach by calculating the activation Gibbs energy for kink-pair nucleation on screw dislocations of two body-centered cubic metals, iron and tungsten. To ensure reliability, we develop machine learning interatomic potentials for both metals, carefully trained on dislocation data from density functional theory. Our findings reveal that dislocations undergo harmonic transitions between Peierls valleys, with an activation entropy that remains largely constant, regardless of temperature or applied stress. We use these results to parameterize a thermally-activated model of yield stress, which consistently matches experimental data in both iron and tungsten. Our work challenges recent studies using classical potentials, which report highly varying activation entropies, and suggests that simulations relying on classical potentials-widely used in materials modeling-could be significantly influenced by overestimated entropic effects.

Title: Thermoelectric performance of a minimally nonlinear voltage probe and voltage-temperature probe heat engine with broken time-reversal symmetry
Authors: Jayasmita Behera, Salil Bedkihal, Bijay Kumar Agarwalla, Malay Bandyopadhyay
Abstract: We investigate the thermoelectric performance of minimally nonlinear irreversible heat engines with broken time-reversal symmetry (TRS), realized through voltage and voltage-temperature probe configurations. Our framework extends the Onsager relations by incorporating a nonlinear power dissipation term into the heat current. We derive and analyze analytical expressions for the efficiency at a given power and the efficiency at maximum power (EMP), expressed in terms of asymmetry parameters and generalized figures of merit. Our analysis reveals that the combined effects of broken TRS and nonlinear dissipation give rise to two universal bounds on the EMP that can surpass the Curzon-Ahlborn (CA) limit. Although these bounds share a similar analytical form, differences in Carnot efficiency and asymmetry parameters lead to distinct operational characteristics, as shown through numerical simulations. We consider a triple-quantum-dot Aharonov-Bohm heat engine incorporating either a voltage probe or a voltage-temperature probe. In both cases, TRS is broken by the magnetic flux. However, the voltage-temperature probe requires an additional anisotropy in the system for its TRS-breaking effects to significantly influence transport. We examine the role of this anisotropy in enhancing performance. Our results show that the EMP and efficiency at a given power can be enhanced by increasing the strength of nonlinear power dissipation, even though the output power remains unchanged. The voltage probe configuration generally yields higher power, while the voltage-temperature probe is more efficient, except in certain regimes where large asymmetries and high figures of merit allow the voltage probe setup to outperform.

Abstract: Electric conduction mechanisms are studied in the pressed nanoflake powder of the molybdenum-disulfide-oxide (MoSxOy) depending on their content and structure. The MoSxOy nanoflakes were prepared by reaction of (NH4)6Mo7O24 with thiourea in aqueous solution followed by aerial oxidation. The sintered nanoflakes are 10-20 nm thick and self-assembled in the "nanoflower"-shape aggregates forming powder particles. The chemical composition and structure of the powders were studied by XPS, EDS and Raman spectroscopy, which show that the powders have different chemical composition and structure depending on the preparation conditions. These studies revealed the existence of different forms of MoS2 and its oxides in the powders. These features are impactful on electric transport properties. The current-voltage (I-V) curves of the pressed MoSxOy nanoflakes reveal hysteresis-like behavior; at that the loop width depends on the chemical composition and structure. The negative differential conductivity is observed for the highest content of Mo in oxide/sulfoxide form. The I-V curves of all MoSxOy nanoflake samples manifest the three-state resistive switching and the long-lasting transient charge/discharge on switching "on/off" the voltage across the sample, which evidences the role of interface charges in their conductivity. To describe theoretically the observed I-V curves, polar and electric-transport properties of the pressed MoSxOy nanoflakes, the Landau-Cahn-Hilliard approach considering flexo-chemical field has been used. The revealed experimentally and explained theoretically features of resistive switching and charge accumulation look promising for applications in memristors and high-performance supercapacitors.

Title: Geometric orthogonal metals: Hidden antiferromagnetism and pseudogap from fluctuating stripes
Authors: Henning Schlömer, Annabelle Bohrdt, Fabian Grusdt
Abstract: One of the key features of hole-doped cuprates is the presence of an extended pseudogap phase, whose microscopic origin has been the subject of intense investigation since its discovery and is believed to be crucial for understanding high-temperature superconductivity. Various explanations have been proposed for the pseudogap, including links to symmetry-breaking orders such as stripes or pairing, and the emergence of novel fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) and orthogonal metal (OM) phases. The topological nature of FL* and OM phases has been identified as scenarios compatible with a small Fermi surface without symmetry breaking, as suggested experimentally. With recent experimental and numerical studies supporting an intricate relationship between stripe order and the pseudogap phase, we here propose an alternative scenario: an orthogonal metal with a geometric origin (GOM) driven by fluctuating domain walls. The essential mechanism behind our proposal is hidden order, where the proliferation of domain walls stabilized by charge fluctuations obscures the underlying long-range antiferromagnetic order in real-space, but order is preserved in the reference frame of the background spins. As a result, well-defined fermionic quasiparticles in the form of magnetic polarons exist, which couple to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological excitations of the domain wall string-net condensate in the ground state and constitute a small Fermi surface. At a critical doping value, we argue that hidden order is lost, driving a transition to a regular Fermi liquid at a hidden quantum critical point (hQCP) featuring quantum critical transport properties. Our GOM framework establishes a deep connection between the antiferromagnetic, stripe, and pseudogap phases, and suggests a possible unification of superconductivity in (electron and hole) doped cuprates and heavy fermion compounds.

Title: First order Quantum Hall to Wigner crystal phase transition on a triangular lattice: an iDMRG study
Authors: Gleb Fedorovich, Clemens Kuhlenkamp, Atac Imamoglu, Ivan Amelio
Abstract: In this work we study a system of interacting fermions on a triangular lattice in the presence of an external magnetic field. We neglect spin and fix a density of one third, with one unit of magnetic flux per particle. The infinite density matrix renormalization group algorithm is used to compute the ground state of this generalized Fermi-Hubbard model. Increasing the strength of the nearest-neighbor repulsion, we find a first order transition between an Integer Quantum Hall phase and a crystalline, generalized Wigner crystal state. The first-order nature of the phase transition is consistent with a Ginzburg-Landau argument. We expect our results to be relevant for moiré heterostructures of two-dimensional materials.

Title: Condensation of Composite Bosonic Trions in Interacting Bose-Fermi Mixtures
Authors: Qi Song, Jie Lou, Yan Chen
Abstract: We reveal a quantum coherent state characterized by composite bosonic trions, wherein paired fermions further bind with bosons, in one-dimensional Bose-Fermi this http URL phase emerges in two separate models, both featuring onsite boson-fermion attraction that induces negative binding energy for the composite trions. The first is the pair-hopping model, in which spinless fermions undergo pair hopping to form preformed pairs. The second is the extended Bose-Fermi Hubbard model, describing dipolar bosons and fermions with density-density interactions. Notably, the formation of composite trions is independent of the specific pairing interactions of fermions. Extensive density matrix renormalization group calculations demonstrate the quasi-condensation of the composite trions, evidenced by algebraically decaying correlations of trions, gapped single-particle excitations, and suppressed fermion pair correlations. Our findings provide valuable insights into the three-body pairing mechanism in mixed-particle systems.

Title: Variational approach to the dynamics of dissipative quantum impurity models
Authors: Yi-Fan Qu, Martino Stefanini, Tao Shi, Tilman Esslinger, Sarang Gopalakrishnan, Jamir Marino, Eugene Demler
Abstract: Recent experiments with quantum simulators using ultracold atoms and superconducting qubits have demonstrated the potential of controlled dissipation as a versatile tool for realizing correlated many-body states. However, determining the dynamics of dissipative quantum many-body systems remains a significant analytical and numerical challenge. In this work, we focus on a dissipative impurity problem as a testbed for new methodological developments. We introduce an efficient non-perturbative framework that combines the superposition of Gaussian states (SGS) variational ansatz with the quantum trajectory approach to simulate open systems featuring a dissipative impurity. Applying this method to a spinful impurity subject to two-body losses and embedded in a bath of noninteracting fermions, we explore the full crossover from weak to strong dissipation regimes. The non-perturbative nature of the SGS ansatz allows us to thoroughly examine this crossover, providing comprehensive insights into the system's behavior. In the strong dissipation regime, our approach reproduces the finding that localized two-body losses can induce the Kondo effect [arXiv:2406.03527], characterized by a slowdown of spin relaxation and an enhancement of charge conductance. Furthermore, we reveal an exotic ``negative conductance" phenomenon at zero potential bias -- a counter-intuitive single-body effect resulting from intermediate dissipation and finite bandwidth. Finally, we investigate the formation of ferromagnetic domains and propose an extension to realize a higher-spin Kondo model using localized dissipation.

Title: Echoes and defects in the Calogero model
Authors: Benjamin Liégeois, Ramasubramanian Chitra, Nicolò Defenu
Abstract: In this work, we extend the study of the interplay between scaling symmetries and statistics to one-dimensional fluids by studying the Calogero model in a harmonic trap modulated through time. The latter harbors an interpretation in terms of free particles imbued with exclusion statistics and is an example of a scale invariant fluid in one-dimension displaying $\mathrm{SO(2,1)}$ dynamical symmetry preserved by harmonic traps. Taking advantage of the dynamical symmetry, two experimentally relevant drive protocols spanning both quasistatic and nonadiabatic regimes are investigated and universal signatures of the interactions and exclusion statistics are uncovered in the ground-state echo amplitude and closely related ground-state fidelity. In particular, under both periodic modulation and slow drive through the gapless point of the trap frequency, enhanced interactions and exclusion are shown to favor the proliferation of defects and to hinder their annihilation, which leads to a universal decrease of ground-state fidelities and echo amplitudes. We also show that increasing exclusion sparks a sharp suppression of the likelihood of intermediate echoes beyond those imposed by the commensurability of a periodic drive and the natural frequency of the trap.

Title: Large Kohn anomaly and phonon collapse induced by charge density wave in UPt$_2$Si$_2$
Authors: Jooseop Lee, Greta L. Chappell, Ryan E. Baumbach, Ayman H. Said, Igor A. Zaliznyak
Abstract: Using high-energy-resolution inelastic x-ray scattering, we observe anomalous softening and damping of the transverse acoustic phonon in UPt$_2$Si$_2$ as the system is cooled towards the charge density wave (CDW) transition temperature, T$_{\rm{CDW}}$. The phonon exhibits a marked Kohn-type anomaly around the CDW wave vector, Q$_{\rm{CDW}}$, and becomes overdamped within a finite momentum range already well above T$_{\rm{CDW}}$. The dispersion anomaly is consistent with potential Fermi surface nesting, which together with the extended phonon collapse indicate strong electron-phonon coupling. The transition temperature estimated from the phonon softening is markedly lower than T$_{\rm{CDW}}$, consistent with a primarily electronic instability rather than a phonon-driven transition. Our results establish UPt$_2$Si$_2$ as a prime example of a strongly correlated electron CDW system with exceptionally strong electron-phonon coupling driving phonon softening and collapse.

Title: Estimate of equilibration times of quantum correlation functions in the thermodynamic limit based on Lanczos coefficients
Authors: Jiaozi Wang, Merlin Füllgraf, Jochen Gemmer
Abstract: We study the equilibration times $T_\text{eq}$ of local observables in quantum chaotic systems by considering their auto-correlation functions. Based on the recursion method, we suggest a scheme to estimate $T_\text{eq}$ from the corresponding Lanczos coefficients that is expected to hold in the thermodynamic limit. We numerically find that if the observable eventually shows smoothly growing Lanczos coefficients, a finite number of the former is sufficient for a reasonable estimate of the equilibration time. This implies that equilibration occurs on a realistic time scale much shorter than the life of the universe. The numerical findings are further supported by analytical arguments.

Title: Delocalized Excitation Transfer in Open Quantum Systems with Long-Range Interactions
Authors: Diego Fallas Padilla, Visal So, Abhishek Menon, Roman Zhuravel, Han Pu, Guido Pagano
Abstract: The interplay between coherence and system-environment interactions is at the basis of a wide range of phenomena, from quantum information processing to charge and energy transfer in molecular systems, biomolecules, and photochemical materials. In this work, we use a Frenkel exciton model with long-range interacting qubits coupled to a damped collective bosonic mode to investigate vibrationally assisted transfer processes in donor-acceptor systems featuring internal substructures analogous to light-harvesting complexes. We find that certain delocalized excitonic states maximize the transfer rate and that the entanglement is preserved during the dissipative transfer over a wide range of parameters. We investigate the reduction in transfer caused by static disorder, white noise, and finite temperature and study how transfer efficiency scales as a function of the number of dimerized monomers and the component number of each monomer, finding which excitonic states lead to optimal transfer. Finally, we provide a realistic experimental setting to realize this model in analog trapped-ion quantum simulators. Analog quantum simulation of systems comprising many and increasingly complex monomers could offer valuable insights into the design of light-harvesting materials, particularly in the non-perturbative intermediate parameter regime examined in this study, where classical simulation methods are resource-intensive.

Title: Tunable altermagnetism via inter-chain engineering in parallelassembled atomic chains
Authors: Deping Guo, Canbo Zong, Weihan Zhang, Cong Wang, Junwei Liu, Wei Ji
Abstract: Altermagnetism has recently drawn considerable attention in three- and twodimensional materials. Here, we extend this concept to quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) monolayers assembled from single-atomic magnetic chains. Through systematically examining nine types of structures, two stacking orders, and intra-/inter-chain magnetic couplings, we identify four out of thirty promising structural prototypes for hosting altermagnetism, which yields 192 potential monolayer materials. We further confirm eight thermodynamically stable Q1D monolayers via high-throughput calculations. Using symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we find that the existence of altermagnetism is determined by the type of inter-chain magnetic coupling and predict three intrinsic altermagnets,\(CrBr_3\),\(VBr_3\),\(MnBr_3\),due to their ferromagnetic inter-chain couplings and five extrinsic ones,\(CrF_3\),\(CrCl_3\),\(CrI_3\),\(FeCl_3\)and \(CoTe_3\), ascribed to their neglectable or antiferromagnetic inter-chain couplings. Moreover, the inter-chain magnetic coupling here is highly tunable by manipulating the inter-chain spacing, leading to experimentally feasible transitions between altermagnetic and nodal-line semiconducting states. In addition, applying external electric fields can further modulate the spin splitting. Our findings establish a highly tunable family of Q1D altermagnets, offering fundamental insights into the intricate relationship between geometry, electronic structure, and this http URL discoveries hold significant promises for experimental realization and future spintronic applications.

Title: Interstitials as a key ingredient for P segregation to grain boundaries in polycrystalline $α$-Fe
Authors: Amin Reiners-Sakic, Alexander Reichmann, Christoph Dösinger, Lorenz Romaner, David Holec
Abstract: The segregation of solutes to grain boundaries can significantly influence material behavior. Most previous computational studies have concentrated on substitutional solute segregation, neglecting interstitial segregation due to its increased complexity. The site preference, interstitial or substitutional, for P segregation in $\alpha$-Fe still remains under debate. In this work, we investigate the full GB-segregation spectrum for both substitutional and interstitial GB sites in a polycrystalline atomistic structure of ferrite with the aid of classical interatomic potentials combined with machine learning techniques. The method is qualitatively tested for H and Ni, where the segregation behavior in $\alpha$-Fe is well understood. Our findings for P show that segregation to both types of GB sites is possible, with a preference for the substitutional sites based on the mean segregation energy. However, due to the much larger number of interstitial sites, interstitial segregation significantly contributes to the GB enrichment with P. This underscores the importance of considering interstitial P segregation in addition to the substitutional one. Furthermore, we also argue that equally important for quantitative predictions (that agree with experimental data) is to get a representative spectrum of the segregation energies.

Title: From pure to mixed: Altermagnets as intrinsic symmetry-breaking indicators
Authors: Aline Ramires
Abstract: We investigate the impact of the presence of altermagnetism on physical observables in the presence of explicit or spontaneous symmetry-breaking fields. We focus on unconventional superconductivity as a potential source of spontaneous symmetry-breaking fields and derive the symmetry considerations for the transmutation of altermagnets from pure to mixed, which can give rise to unusual phenomena. Based on this analysis, we put forward scenarios that could explain the apparent onset of time-reversal symmetry breaking at the superconducting critical temperature in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, and the hidden magnetic phase and magnetic memory in 4Hb-TaS$_2$.

Title: Visualizing isospin magnetic texture and intervalley exchange interaction in rhombohedral tetralayer graphene
Authors: Nadav Auerbach, Surajit Dutta, Matan Uzan, Yaar Vituri, Yaozhang Zhou, Alexander Y. Meltzer, Sameer Grover, Tobias Holder, Peleg Emanuel, Martin E. Huber, Yuri Myasoedov, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Yuval Oreg, Erez Berg, Eli Zeldov
Abstract: The tunable band structure and nontrivial topology of multilayer rhombohedral graphene lead to a variety of correlated electronic states with isospin orders-meaning ordered states in the combined spin and valley degrees of freedom-dictated by the interplay of spin-orbit coupling and Hunds exchange interactions. However, methods for mapping local isospin textures and determining the exchange energies are currently lacking. Here, we image the magnetization textures in tetralayer rhombohedral graphene using a nanoscale superconducting quantum interference device. We observe sharp magnetic phase transitions that indicate spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking. In the quarter-metal phase, the spin and orbital moments align closely, providing a bound on the spin-orbit coupling energy. We also show that the half-metal phase has a very small magnetic anisotropy, which provides an experimental lower bound on the intervalley Hunds exchange interaction energy. This is found to be close to its theoretical upper bound. The ability to resolve the local isospin texture and the different interaction energies will allow a better understanding of the phase transition hierarchy and the numerous correlated electronic states arising from spontaneous and induced isospin symmetry breaking in graphene heterostructures.

Title: Reentrant localization transition induced by a composite potential
Authors: Xingbo Wei
Abstract: We numerically investigate the localization transition in a one-dimensional system subjected to a composite potential consisting of periodic and quasi-periodic components. For the rational wave vector $\alpha=1/2$, the periodic component reduces to a staggered potential, which has been reported to induce the reentrant localization transition. In addition to $\alpha=1/2$, we find that other rational wave vectors can also lead to the reentrant phenomenon. To investigate the underlying mechanisms of the reentrant localization transition, we vary the parameters of the composite potential and find that the reentrant localization transition is sensitive to the phase factor of the periodic component. By further studying the structure of the periodic component, we confirm that this sensitivity arises from the periodic phase factor modulating the mirror symmetry. Finally, we map out a global phase diagram and reveal that the reentrant localization transition originates from a paradoxical effect: increasing the amplitude of the periodic component enhances localization but simultaneously strengthens the mirror symmetry, which favors the formation of extended states. Our numerical analysis suggests that the interplay between these competing factors drives the reentrant localization transition.

Title: Orbital orders under magnetic fields in cubic PrIr$_2$Zn$_{20}$
Authors: Hitoko Okanoya, Kazumasa Hattori
Abstract: We study orbital orders in quadrupolar heavy-fermion compound PrIr$_2$Zn$_{20}$ under magnetic fields on the basis of the Landau theory. Assuming E$_g$ orbital (electric quadrupolar) orders in the cubic symmetry with the ordering wavenumber at the L points in the face-centered cubic lattice Brillouin zone as observed experimentally, we construct the Landau free energy and analyze it. We find that the unidentified high-temperature ordered phase under the magnetic field H ||[001] reported earlier can be interpreted as the consequence of the internal rotation in the orbital moments of f electrons at the Pr site. We discuss the phase diagram for various magnetic-field directions and also possible double-q quadrupolar orders in this system.

Title: Are shocks in conserved driven single-file motions with bottlenecks universal?
Authors: Sourav Pal, Abhik Basu
Abstract: Driven single-file motion sets the paradigm for wide variety of one-dimensional directed movements, ranging from intracellular transport and urban traffic to ant trails and controlled robot swarms. Motivated by the phenomenologies of these systems in closed geometries, regulated by number conservation and bottlenecks, we explore the domain walls (DWs) or shocks in a conceptual one-dimensional cellular automaton with a fixed particle number and a bottleneck. For high entry and exit rates of the cellular automaton, and with {sufficiently large} particle numbers, the DWs formed are independent of the associated rate parameters, revealing a {\em hitherto unknown universality} in their {\em shapes}. In contrast, the DWs do depend upon these parameters, if they are small, and hence have nonuniversal shapes. Our predictions on the DWs are testable in experiments.

Title: Compressing local vertex functions from the multipoint numerical renormalization group using quantics tensor cross interpolation
Authors: Markus Frankenbach, Marc Ritter, Mathias Pelz, Nepomuk Ritz, Jan von Delft, Anxiang Ge
Abstract: The multipoint numerical renormalization group (mpNRG) is a powerful impurity solver that provides accurate spectral data useful for computing local, dynamic correlation functions in imaginary or real frequencies non-perturbatively across a wide range of interactions and temperatures. It gives access to a local, non-perturbative four-point vertex in imaginary and real frequencies, which can be used as input for subsequent computations such as diagrammatic extensions of dynamical mean--field theory. However, computing and manipulating the real-frequency four-point vertex on large, dense grids quickly becomes numerically challenging when the density and/or the extent of the frequency grid is increased. In this paper, we compute four-point vertices in a strongly compressed quantics tensor train format using quantics tensor cross interpolation, starting from discrete partial spectral functions obtained from mpNRG. This enables evaluations of the vertex on frequency grids with resolutions far beyond the reach of previous implementations. We benchmark this approach on the four-point vertex of the single-impurity Anderson model across a wide range of physical parameters, both in its full form and its asymptotic decomposition. For imaginary frequencies, the full vertex can be represented to an accuracy on the order of $2\cdot 10^{-3}$ with maximum bond dimensions not exceeding 120. The more complex full real-frequency vertex requires maximum bond dimensions not exceeding 170 for an accuracy of $\lesssim 2\%$. Our work marks another step toward tensor-train-based diagrammatic calculations for correlated electronic lattice models starting from a local, non-perturbative mpNRG vertex.

Title: Hydrodynamic Origin of Friction Between Suspended Rough Particles
Authors: Jake Minten, Bhargav Rallabandi
Abstract: Tangential interactions between particles play a central role in suspension rheology. We show theoretically that these interactions, often attributed to contact friction, are a direct consequence of fluid flows between rough particles in relative motion. We find that small surface asperities generically lead to localized hydrodynamic sliding forces and torques that can exceed their smooth counterparts by orders of magnitude. A fully analytic thin-film theory shows that these forces grow inversely with the surface separation, significantly more singular than the logarithmic scaling for smooth particles. The impending singularity tightly constrains the particles' rotation with their translation, recovering a crucial ingredient in dense suspension rheology. Despite their purely hydrodynamic origin, these features resemble several aspects of dry rolling and sliding friction.

Title: What Does The Korringa Ratio Measure?
Authors: B. Sriram Shastry (AT&amp; T Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill, New Jersey), Elihu Abrahams (Serin Physics Laboratory, Rutgers University, Piscataway, New Jersey)
Abstract: We present an analysis of the Korringa ratio in a dirty metal, emphasizing the case where a Stoner enhancement of the uniform susceptibilty is present. We find that the relaxation rates are significantly enhanced by disorder, and that the inverse problem of determining the bare density of states from a study of the change of the Knight shift and relaxation rates with some parameter, such as pressure, has rather constrained solutions, with the disorder playing an important role. Some preliminary applications to the case of chemical substitution in the Rb$_{3-x}$K$_x $C$_{60}$ family of superconductors is presented and some other relevant systems are mentioned.

Title: The $1/r^2$ Integrable system: The Universal Hamiltonian for Quantum Chaos
Authors: B. Sriram Shastry (AT\&amp;T Bell Labs, Murray Hill, NJ)
Abstract: We summarize recent work showing that the $1/r^2$ model of interacting particles in 1-dimension is a universal Hamiltonian for quantum chaotic systems. The problem is analyzed in terms of random matrices and of the evolution of their eigenvalues under changes of parameters. The robustness of bulk space-time correlations of a many particle system to changing boundary conditions is suggested to be at the root of the universality. The explicit density-density correlation functions of the $1/r^2$ model, now available through the above mapping at two values of the coupling constant, are interpreted in the light of Bethe's {\it Ansatz}, giving a vivid picture of the fractionalization of bare particles or holes into ``quark'' like Bethe quasi-particles and holes.

Title: GLIMPSE: Graphene-based super-Light Invisible Matter Particle SEarch
Authors: Doojin Kim, Jong-Chul Park, Gil-Ho Lee, Kin Chung Fong
Abstract: We propose a new dark-matter detection strategy that will potentially enable the search for super-light dark matter $m_\chi \simeq 0.1$ keV, improving the minimum detectable mass by more than three orders of magnitude compared to ongoing experiments. This can be achieved by intimately integrating the target material, specifically the $\pi$-bond electrons in graphene, into a Josephson junction to create a highly sensitive detector capable of detecting energy deposits from dark matter as small as $\sim 0.1$ meV. We investigate detection prospects of pg-, ng-, and $\mu$g-scale detectors by calculating the scattering rate between dark matter and free electrons confined in two-dimensional graphene, including Pauli-blocking factors and in-medium screening effects. We find that the proposed detector is expected to not only serve as a complementary probe of super-light dark matter but also achieve higher experimental sensitivities than other proposed experiments, assuming zero readout noise, thanks to the extremely low threshold energy of our graphene Josephson junction sensor.

Title: Classification of modular data up to rank 12
Authors: Siu-Hung Ng, Eric C. Rowell, Xiao-Gang Wen
Abstract: We use the computer algebra system GAP to classify modular data up to rank 12. This extends the previously obtained classification of modular data up to rank 6. Our classification includes all the modular data from modular tensor categories up to rank 12, with a few possible exceptions at rank 12 and levels $5,7$ and $14$. Those exceptions are eliminated up to a certain bound by an extensive finite search in place of required infinite search. Our list contains a few potential unitary modular data which are not known to correspond to any unitary modular tensor categories (such as those from Kac-Moody algebra, twisted quantum doubles of finite group, as well as their Abelian anyon condensations). It remains to be shown if those potential modular data can be realized by modular tensor categories or not. We provide some evidence that all may be constructed from centers of near-group categories or gauging group symmetries of known modular tensor categories, with the exception of a total of five cases at rank 11 (with $D^2 =1964.590$) and 12 (with $D^2 =3926.660$). The classification of modular data corresponds to a classification of modular tensor categories (up to modular isotopes which are not expected to be present at low ranks). The classification of modular tensor categories leads to a classification of gapped quantum phases of matter in 2-dimensional space for bosonic lattice systems with no symmetry, as well as a classification of generalized symmetries in 1-dimensional space.

Dolgirev, Nishad Maskara, Marcin Kalinowski, Subir Sachdev, David A. Huse, Markus Greiner, Vladan Vuletić, Mikhail D. Lukin
Abstract: Understanding the collective quantum dynamics of nonequilibrium many-body systems is an outstanding challenge in quantum science. In particular, dynamics driven by quantum fluctuations are important for the formation of exotic quantum phases of matter, fundamental high-energy processes, quantum metrology, and quantum algorithms. Here, we use a programmable quantum simulator based on Rydberg atom arrays to experimentally study collective dynamics across a (2+1)D Ising quantum phase transition. After crossing the quantum critical point, we observe a gradual growth of correlations through coarsening of antiferromagnetically ordered domains. By deterministically preparing and following the evolution of ordered domains, we show that the coarsening is driven by the curvature of domain boundaries, and find that the dynamics accelerate with proximity to the quantum critical point. We quantitatively explore these phenomena and further observe long-lived oscillations of the order parameter, corresponding to an amplitude (Higgs) mode. These observations offer a unique viewpoint into emergent collective dynamics in strongly correlated quantum systems and nonequilibrium quantum processes.

Title: Non-Hermitian Delocalization Induced by Residue Imaginary Velocity
Authors: Shi-Xin Hu, Yong-Xu Fu, Yi Zhang
Abstract: The dichotomy of localization versus delocalization is a historic topic central to quantum and condensed matter physics. We discover a new delocalization mechanism attributed to a residue imaginary (part of) velocity $\operatorname{Im}(v)$, feasible for ground states or low-temperature states of non-Hermitian quantum systems under periodic boundary conditions. In sharp contrast to conventional formalisms through extended wavefunctions, these target systems exhibit delocalization in collective physical properties such as correlation and entanglement (of the Fermi Seas) despite sometimes localized left and right single-particle eigenstates, as we demonstrate numerically and generalize to scenarios with finite temperatures and interaction. Interestingly, disorder contributing to $\operatorname{Im}(v)$ may also allow strong-disorder delocalization. Thus, the nontrivial physics of $\operatorname{Im}(v)$ significantly enriches our understanding of delocalization and harbors interesting experiments and practical applications.

Title: Optical effects in unmagnetized cold plasmas by a chiral axion factor
Authors: Filipe S. Ribeiro, Pedro D. S. Silva, Manoel M. Ferreira Jr
Abstract: Unmagnetized cold plasma modes are investigated in the context of the chiral Maxwell-Carroll-Field-Jackiw (MCJF) electrodynamics, where the axion chiral factor acts retrieving some typical properties of magnetized plasmas. The Maxwell equations are rewritten for a cold, uniform, and collisionless fluid plasma model, allowing us to determine the dispersion relation, new refractive indices, and propagating modes. We find four distinct refractive indices modified by the purely timelike CFJ background that plays the magnetic conductivity chiral parameter role associated with right-circularly polarized (RCP) and left-circularly polarized (LCP) waves. For each refractive index, the propagation and absorption zones are determined and illustrated for some specific parameter values. Modified RCP and LCP helicons are found in the low-frequency regime. The optical behavior is investigated, revealing that the chiral factor induces birefringence, measured in terms of the rotatory power (RP). The dichroism coefficient is carried out for the absorbing zones. The negative refraction zones may enhance the involved rotatory power, yielding RP sign reversion, a feature of rotating plasmas and MCFJ chiral plasmas. Charge density oscillations and Langmuir waves are also discussed, revealing no modified dispersion relation due to the chiral axion factor.

Title: Generalization vs. Specialization under Concept Shift
Authors: Alex Nguyen, David J. Schwab, Vudtiwat Ngampruetikorn
Abstract: Machine learning models are often brittle under distribution shift, i.e., when data distributions at test time differ from those during training. Understanding this failure mode is central to identifying and mitigating safety risks of mass adoption of machine learning. Here we analyze ridge regression under concept shift -- a form of distribution shift in which the input-label relationship changes at test time. We derive an exact expression for prediction risk in the thermodynamic limit. Our results reveal nontrivial effects of concept shift on generalization performance, including a phase transition between weak and strong concept shift regimes and nonmonotonic data dependence of test performance even when double descent is absent. Our theoretical results are in good agreement with experiments based on transformers pretrained to solve linear regression; under concept shift, too long context length can be detrimental to generalization performance of next token prediction. Finally, our experiments on MNIST and FashionMNIST suggest that this intriguing behavior is present also in classification problems.

Title: Symmetry verification for noisy quantum simulations of non-Abelian lattice gauge theories
Authors: Edoardo Ballini, Julius Mildenberger, Matteo M. Wauters, Philipp Hauke
Abstract: Non-Abelian gauge theories underlie our understanding of fundamental forces of modern physics. Simulating them on quantum hardware is an outstanding challenge in the rapidly evolving field of quantum simulation. A key prerequisite is the protection of local gauge symmetries against errors that, if unchecked, would lead to unphysical results. While an extensive toolkit devoted to identifying, mitigating, and ultimately correcting such errors has been developed for Abelian groups, non-commuting symmetry operators complicate the implementation of similar schemes in non-Abelian theories. Here, we discuss two techniques for error mitigation through symmetry verification, tailored for non-Abelian lattice gauge theories implemented in noisy qudit hardware: dynamical post-selection (DPS), based on mid-circuit measurements without active feedback, and post-processed symmetry verification (PSV), which combines measurements of correlations between target observables and gauge transformations. We illustrate both approaches for the discrete non-Abelian group $D_3$ in 2+1 dimensions, explaining their usefulness for current NISQ devices even in the presence of fast fluctuating noise. Our results open new avenues for robust quantum simulation of non-Abelian gauge theories, for further development of error-mitigation techniques, and for measurement-based control methods in qudit platforms.

Title: Optimal Symbolic Construction of Matrix Product Operators and Tree Tensor Network Operators
Authors: Hazar Çakır, Richard M. Milbradt, Christian B. Mendl
Abstract: This research introduces an improved framework for constructing matrix product operators (MPOs) and tree tensor network operators (TTNOs), crucial tools in quantum simulations. A given (Hamiltonian) operator typically has a known symbolic "sum of operator strings" form that can be translated into a tensor network structure. Combining the existing bipartite-graph-based approach and a newly introduced symbolic Gaussian elimination preprocessing step, our proposed method improves upon earlier algorithms in cases when Hamiltonian terms share the same prefactors. We test the performance of our method against established ones for benchmarking purposes. Finally, we apply our methodology to the model of a cavity filled with molecules in a solvent. This open quantum system is cast into the hierarchical equation of motion (HEOM) setting to obtain an effective Hamiltonian. Construction of the corresponding TTNO demonstrates a sub-linear increase of the maximum bond dimension.

Title: Superdiffusion, normal diffusion and chaos in semiclassical Bose-Hubbard chains
Authors: Dragan Marković, Mihailo Čubrović
Abstract: We study the evolution of two-point correlation functions of one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model in the semiclassical regime in the framework of Truncated Wigner Approximation (TWA) with quantum jumps as first-order corrections. At early times, the correlation functions show strong superdiffusion with universal integer exponents determined solely by the initial conditions and completely insensitive to system parameters and chaos. Only after a long time this regime crosses over to normal diffusion regime which is most robust when nonintegrability is strong. For strong nonintegrability, the system ends up in a homogeneous state while for weak nonintegrability the oscillations and inhomogeneities persist, despite the fact that chaos is nearly always strong and only weakly depends on nonintegrability parameter. We conclude that the superidiffusive regime is neither prethermalized nor a precursor to thermalization but a novel early-time phenomenon related to a special scaling symmetry of the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian.

Abstract: Bamboo slips are a crucial medium for recording ancient civilizations in East Asia, and offers invaluable archaeological insights for reconstructing the Silk Road, studying material culture exchanges, and global history. However, many excavated bamboo slips have been fragmented into thousands of irregular pieces, making their rejoining a vital yet challenging step for understanding their content. Here we introduce WisePanda, a physics-driven deep learning framework designed to rejoin fragmented bamboo slips. Based on the physics of fracture and material deterioration, WisePanda automatically generates synthetic training data that captures the physical properties of bamboo fragmentations. This approach enables the training of a matching network without requiring manually paired samples, providing ranked suggestions to facilitate the rejoining process. Compared to the leading curve matching method, WisePanda increases Top-50 matching accuracy from 36% to 52% among more than one thousand candidate fragments. Archaeologists using WisePanda have experienced substantial efficiency improvements (approximately 20 times faster) when rejoining fragmented bamboo slips. This research demonstrates that incorporating physical principles into deep learning models can significantly enhance their performance, transforming how archaeologists restore and study fragmented artifacts. WisePanda provides a new paradigm for addressing data scarcity in ancient artifact restoration through physics-driven machine learning.

Title: Toward extracting scattering phase shift from integrated correlation functions IV: Coulomb corrections
Authors: Peng Guo, Frank X. Lee
Abstract: The formalism developed in Refs.~\cite{Guo:2023ecc,Guo:2024zal,Guo:2024pvt} that relates the integrated correlation functions for a trapped system to the infinite volume scattering phase shifts through a weighted integral is further extended to include Coulomb interaction between charged particles. The original formalism cannot be applied due to different divergent asymptotic behavior resulting from the long-range nature of the Coulomb force. We show that a modified formula in which the difference of integrated correlation functions between particles interacting with Coulomb plus short-range interaction and with Coulomb interaction alone is free of divergence, and has rapid approach to its infinite volume limit. Using an exactly solvable model, we demonstrate that the short-range potential scattering phase shifts can be reliably extracted from the formula in the presence of Coulomb interaction.

Title: Structure and dynamics of finite three-dimensional Yukawa clusters in complex plasmas : Newtonian versus Langevin Dynamics
Authors: Hirakjyoti Sarma, Nilakshi Das
Abstract: The structure and dynamics of a harmonically confined three dimensional finite dust cluster are investigated via both Langevin Dynamics (LD) and frictionless Molecular Dynamics (fMD) simulation. The static structure of the system is analyzed through the Radial Distribution Function, Center-two-particle correlation function(C2P) and angular correlation function. The intra-shell angular correlation, Radial Distribution Function and C2P remains largely unaffected by the dynamics employed. However, the inter-shell angular correlation exhibits sharp peaks at irregular angular intervals in fMD which are not seen in LD indicating strongly correlated motion of the two spherical shells in the cluster in fMD. The single particle dynamics of the cluster is characterized by the Van - Hove self autocorrelation function and Mean Squared Displacement (MSD). Notably, the Van - Hove autocorrelation function in fMD simulations exhibits narrower width and higher peak height as compared to the LD simulations, suggesting greater particle mobility in LD. Trajectory analysis reveals a rotational motion of the particles about a common axis in fMD which disappears with progressively increasing friction coefficient. We show that the disappearance of rotational motion with the introduction of neutral friction in the dynamics is due to the much faster relaxation of the interparticle distance as well as interparticle angular separation in LD as compared to fMD.

Title: Nine circles of elastic brittle fracture: A series of challenge problems to assess fracture models
Authors: Farhad Kamarei, Bo Zheng, John E. Dolbow, Oscar Lopez-Pamies
Abstract: Since the turn of the millennium, capitalizing on modern advances in mathematics and computation, a slew of computational models have been proposed in the literature with the objective of describing the nucleation and propagation of fracture in materials subjected to mechanical, thermal, and/or other types of loads. By and large, each new proposal focuses on a particular aspect of the problem, while ignoring others that have been well-established. This approach has resulted in a plethora of models that are, at best, descriptors of fracture only under a restricted set of conditions, while they may predict grossly incorrect and even non-physical behaviors in general. In an attempt to address this predicament, this paper introduces a vetting process in the form of nine challenge problems that any computational model of fracture must convincingly handle if it is to potentially describe fracture nucleation and propagation in general. The focus is on the most basic of settings, that of isotropic elastic brittle materials subjected to quasi-static mechanical loads. The challenge problems have been carefully selected so that: $i$) they can be carried out experimentally with standard testing equipment; $ii$) they can be unambiguously analyzed with a sharp description of fracture; and, most critically, $iii$) in aggregate they span the entire range of well settled experimental knowledge on fracture nucleation and propagation that has been amassed for over a century. For demonstration purposes, after their introduction, each challenge problem is solved with two phase-field models of fracture.
