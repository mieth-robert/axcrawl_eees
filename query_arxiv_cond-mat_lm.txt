Title: Study on the SDW and Superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ at ambient pressure
Authors: Yu-Bo Liu, Hongyi Sun, Ming Zhang, Qihang Liu, Wei-Qiang Chen, Fan Yang
Abstract: The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity (SC) with $T_c\approx 80$ K in the pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ has aroused great interests. Currently, due to technical difficulties, most experiments on La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ can only be performed at ambient pressure (AP). Particularly, various experiments have revealed the presence of spin-density wave (SDW) in the unidirectional diagonal double-stripe pattern with wave vector near $(\pi/2,\pi/2)$ in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ at AP. In this work, we employ first-principle calculations followed by the random phase approximation (RPA)-based study to clarify the origin of this special SDW pattern and potential SC in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ at AP. Starting from our density-functional-theory (DFT) band structure, we construct an eight-band bilayer tight-binding model using the Ni-$3d_{z^2}$ and $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals, which is equipped with the standard multi-orbital Hubbard interaction. Our RPA calculation reveals an SDW order driven by Fermi-surface nesting with wave vector $Q\approx(0,0.84\pi)$ in the folded Brillouin zone (BZ). From view in the unfolded BZ, the wave vector turns to $Q_0\approx(0.42\pi,0.42\pi)$, which is near the one detected by various experiments. Further more, this SDW exhibits an interlayer antiferromagnetic order with a unidirectional diagonal double-stripe pattern, consistent with recent soft X-ray scattering experiment. This result suggests that the origin of the SDW order in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ at AP can be well understood in the itinerant picture as driven by FS-nesting. In the aspect of SC, our RPA study yields an approximate $s^\pm$-wave spin-singlet pairing with $T_c$ considerably lower than that under high pressure, which is consistent with experiments. Furthermore, the $T_c$ can be strongly enhanced through hole doping, leading to possible high-temperature SC in the material.

Title: Atypical vortex lattice and the magnetic penetration depth in superconducting Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ deduced by $\mu$SR
Authors: M. Yakovlev, Z. Kartsonas, J. E. Sonier
Abstract: The muon spin rotation ($\mu$SR) technique has been applied to determine the behavior of the in-plane magnetic penetration depth ($\lambda_{ab}$) in the vortex state of the unconventional superconductor Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ as a means of gaining insight into its still unknown superconducting order parameter. A recent $\mu$SR study of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ reported a $T$-linear temperature dependence for $\lambda_{ab}$ at low temperatures that was not identified in an earlier $\mu$SR study. Here we show that there is no significant difference between the data in the early and recent $\mu$SR studies and both are compatible with the limiting low-temperature $\lambda_{ab} \sim T^2$ dependence expected from measurements of the change in $\lambda_{ab}(T)$ in the Meissner state by other techniques. However, we argue that at this time there is no valid theoretical model for reliably determining the absolute value of $\lambda_{ab}$ in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ from $\mu$SR measurements. Instead, we identify the formation of an unusual square vortex lattice that introduces a new constraint on candidate superconducting order parameters for Sr$_2$RuO$_4$.

Title: Two-body contact of a Bose gas near the superfluid--Mott-insulator transition
Authors: Moksh Bhateja, Nicolas Dupuis, Adam Rançon
Abstract: The two-body contact is a fundamental quantity of a dilute Bose gas which relates the thermodynamics to the short-distance two-body correlations. For a Bose gas in an optical lattice, near the superfluid--Mott-insulator transition, a ``universal'' contact $C_{\rm univ}$ can be defined from the singular part $P-P_{\rm MI}$ of the pressure ($P_{\rm MI}$ is the pressure of the Mott insulator). Its expression $C_{\rm univ}=C_{\rm DBG}(|n-n_{\rm MI}|,a^*)$ coincides with that of a dilute Bose gas provided we consider the effective ``scattering length'' $a^*$ of the quasi-particles at the quantum critical point (QCP) rather than the scattering length in vacuum, and the excess density $|n-n_{\rm MI}|$ of particles (or holes) with respect to the Mott insulator. Sufficiently close to the transition, there is a broad momentum range in the Brillouin zone where the singular part $n^{\rm sing}_{\bf k}=n_{\bf k}-n^{\rm MI}_{\bf k}$ of the momentum distribution exhibits the high-momentum tail $Z_{\rm QP} C_{\rm univ}/|{\bf k}|^4$, where $Z_{\rm QP}$ the quasi-particle weight of the elementary excitations at the QCP. We argue that the contact $C_{\rm univ}$ can be measured in state-of-the-art experiments on Bose gases in optical lattices, and in magnetic insulators.

Title: Strong-coupling RPA theory of a Bose gas near the superfluid--Mott-insulator transition: universal thermodynamics and two-body contact
Authors: Nicolas Dupuis, Nicolas Dupuis, Adam Rançon
Abstract: We present a strong-coupling expansion of the Bose-Hubbard model based on a mean-field treatment of the hopping term, while onsite fluctuations are taken into account exactly. This random phase approximation (RPA) describes the universal features of the generic Mott-insulator--superfluid transition (induced by a density change) and the superfluid phase near the phase transition. The critical quasi-particles at the quantum critical point have a quadratic dispersion with an effective mass $m^*$ and their mutual interaction is described by an effective $s$-wave scattering length $a^*$. The singular part of the pressure takes the same form as in a dilute Bose gas, provided we replace the boson mass $m$ and the scattering length in vacuum $a$ by $m^*$ and $a^*$, and the density $n$ by the excess density $|n-n_{\rm MI}|$ of particles (or holes) with respect to the Mott insulator. We define a ``universal'' two-body contact $C_{\rm univ}$ that controls the high-momentum tail $\sim 1/|{\bf k}|^4$ of the singular part $n^{\rm sing}_{\bf k}$ of the momentum distribution. We also apply the strong-coupling RPA to a lattice model of hard-core bosons and find that the high-momentum distribution is controlled by a universal contact, in complete agreement with the Bose-Hubbard model. Finally, we discuss a continuum model of bosons in an optical lattice and define two additional two-body contacts: a short-distance ``universal'' contact $C_{\rm univ}^{\rm sd}$ which controls the high-momentum tail of $n^{\rm sing}_{\bf k}$ at scales larger than the inverse lattice spacing, and a ``full'' contact $C$ which controls the high-momentum tail of the full momentum distribution $n_{\bf k}$.

Title: Partition Function Zeros of Paths and Normalization Zeros of ASEPS
Authors: Zdzislaw Burda, Desmond A. Johnston
Abstract: We exploit the equivalence between the partition function of an adsorbing Dyck walk model and the Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process (ASEP) normalization to obtain the thermodynamic limit of the locus of the ASEP normalization zeros from a conformal map. We discuss the equivalence between this approach and using an electrostatic analogy to determine the locus, both in the case of the ASEP and the random allocation model.

Title: Crystalline superconductor-semiconductor Josephson junctions for compact superconducting qubits
Authors: Jesse Balgley, Jinho Park, Xuanjing Chu, Ethan G. Arnault, Martin V. Gustafsson, Leonardo Ranzani, Madisen Holbrook, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Vasili Perebeinos, James Hone, Kin Chung Fong
Abstract: The narrow bandgap of semiconductors allows for thick, uniform Josephson junction barriers, potentially enabling reproducible, stable, and compact superconducting qubits. We study vertically stacked van der Waals Josephson junctions with semiconducting weak links, whose crystalline structures and clean interfaces offer a promising platform for quantum devices. We observe robust Josephson coupling across 2--12 nm (3--18 atomic layers) of semiconducting WSe$_2$ and, notably, a crossover from proximity- to tunneling-type behavior with increasing weak link thickness. Building on these results, we fabricate a prototype all-crystalline merged-element transmon qubit with transmon frequency and anharmonicity closely matching design parameters. We demonstrate dispersive coupling between this transmon and a microwave resonator, highlighting the potential of crystalline superconductor-semiconductor structures for compact, tailored superconducting quantum devices.

Title: A Micromechanical Model for Light-interactive Molecular Crystals
Authors: Devesh Tiwari, Ananya Renuka Balakrishna
Abstract: Molecular crystals respond to a light stimulus by bending, twisting, rolling, jumping, or other kinematic behaviors. These behaviors are known to be affected by, among others, the intensity of the incident light, the aspect ratios of crystal geometries, and the volume changes accompanying phase transformation. While these factors, individually, explain the increase in internal energy of the system and its subsequent minimization through macroscopic deformation, they do not fully explain the diversity of deformations observed in molecular crystals. Here, we propose a micromechanical model based on the Cauchy-Born rule and photoreaction theory to predict the macroscopic response in molecular crystals. By accounting for lattice geometry changes and microstructural patterns that emerge during phase transformation, we predict a range of deformations in a representative molecular crystal (salicylideneamine). Doing so, we find that the interplay between photoexcited states and the energy minimization pathways, across a multi-well energy landscape, is crucial to the bending and twisting deformations. We use our model to analyze the role of particle geometries and the intensity of incident light on macroscopic deformation, and identify geometric regimes for shearing and twisting deformations in salicylideneamine crystals. Our micromechanical model is general and can be adapted to predict photomechanical deformation in other molecular crystals undergoing a solid-to-solid phase change and has potential as a computational design tool to engineer reversible and controllable actuation in molecular crystals.

Title: Towards perfect quantum insulation
Authors: Rafael Hipolito, Paul M. Goldbart
Abstract: Electric fields, applied to insulators, cause transitions between valence and conduction bands, giving rise to current. Adjustments of the Hamiltonian can perfect the quality of the insulator, shutting down transitions whilst fully preserving the many-particle state, but they are challenging to implement. Instead, adjusted Hamiltonians having desirable features are addressed variationally, via the analysis of a suitable figure of merit. They suppress current-enabling transitions whilst tending to preserve the many-particle state, and hence they yield optimal insulation. Emerging naturally from this approach are two established concepts: transitionless quantum driving [M. V. Berry, J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 42, 365303 (2009)] and (a modified) localization tensor [R. Resta and S. Sorella, Phys. Rev. Lett. 82, 370-373 (1999)]. The variational approach is illustrated via application to a tight-binding model. In this setting, the optimally adjusted Hamiltonian has a powerful impact on transition suppression and localization-tensor reduction, suggesting strong enhancement of insulation. These features are expected to be more general than the model that displays them.

Title: A structural instability drives the VO2 metal-insulator transition

Abstract: VO2 features concomitant structural and metal-insulator transitions. This poses a challenge for understanding the underlying mechanism: is the transition triggered by a structural or by an electronic instability? Here, we address this question by studying pre-transitional fluctuations in the metallic state. By measuring resonant diffuse X-ray scattering we find no evidence that spatial fluctuations of d-electrons are any different from those of vanadium ion cores. That is, charge and lattice remain coupled as they fluctuate jointly towards the insulating phase, strongly supporting the case that the VO2 metal-insulator transition is triggered by a structural instability. Our work offers a novel approach to solve similar problems in other strongly correlated systems.

Title: Atomic collapse in gapped graphene: lattice and valley effects
Authors: Jing Wang, Xiaotai Wu, Wen-Sheng Zhao, Yuhua Cheng, Yue Hu, Francois M. Peeters
Abstract: We study the atomic collapse phenomenon in $K$ and $K'$ valley of gapped graphene. Bound states induced by Coulomb impurity in the gap turn into atomic collapse resonances as the charge increases beyond the supercritical charge $Z_c$. $Z_c$ increases sublinear with the band gap $\Delta$. The atomic collapse resonances result in peaks in the LDOS at the same energies in $K$ and $K'$ valley, but the strong (weak) LDOS peaks in $K$ valley are weak (strong) LDOS peaks in $K'$ valley reminiscent of pseudospin polarization phenomenon. From a spatial LDOS analysis of the atomic collapse resonance states, we assign specific atomic orbitals to the atomic collapse resonances. Remarkably, the two $p$ atomic orbital atomic collapse states are no longer degenerate and splits into two having lobes in different directions in the graphene plane.

Title: Selective Hydrogen Molecule Dissociation on Ca2N Monolayer
Authors: Gwan Woo Kim, Soonmin Jang, Gunn Kim
Abstract: Developing efficient hydrogen storage and conversion technologies is essential for sustainable energy. This study investigates the catalytic potential of a dicalcium nitride (Ca2N) monolayer for hydrogen dissociation using density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. We find that atomic hydrogen preferentially adsorbs at Ca-centered hollow sites (labeled A sites), while molecular hydrogen adsorption is limited to bridge sites (labeled B sites). AIMD simulations reveal that H2 dissociation at B sites inhibits further adsorption, suggesting a mechanism of controlled H2 dissociation. The current findings emphasize the potential of pristine Ca2N as a catalyst for H2 dissociation-related processes and motivate future investigations of its activity in hydrogen evolution reactions.

Title: Dynamic Modulation of Electronic and Optical Properties in GaN Bilayers by Interlayer Sliding
Authors: Heeju Kim, Gunn Kim
Abstract: In this study, we present a first-principles investigation of the electronic and optical properties of gallium nitride (GaN) bilayers, focusing on the influence of interlayer sliding and spacing. In contrast to the earlier studies on discrete stacking configurations, we explore the dynamic evolution of the properties during transitions between stable stacking arrangements. Using density functional theory calculations, we systematically analyze the impact of these structural variations on the electronic band structure and optical absorption spectra of GaN bilayers. The analysis includes both high-symmetry stacking configurations (AA', AB', and AC') and intermediate states generated by controlled in-plane atomic displacements, thereby providing a comprehensive understanding of the property changes associated with interlayer sliding. The findings of this study provide valuable insights into the potential for tuning the electronic and optical response of two-dimensional GaN for applications in nanoscale photonic and electronic devices, where precise control over interlayer interactions and stacking is crucial.

Title: Tuning Catalytic Efficiency: Thermodynamic Optimization of Zr-Doped \ce{Ti3C2} and \ce{Ti3CN} MXenes for HER Catalysis
Authors: Shrestha Dutta, Rudra Banerjee
Abstract: Hydrogen production via the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) is critical for sustainable energy solutions, yet the reliance on expensive platinum (Pt) catalysts limits scalability. Zirconium-doped (\ce{Zr}-doped) MXenes, such as \ce{Ti3C2} and \ce{Ti3CN}, emerge as transformative alternatives, combining abundance, tunable electronic properties, and high catalytic potential. Using first-principles density functional theory (DFT), we show that \ce{Zr} doping at 3\% and 7\% significantly enhances HER activity by reducing the work function to the optimal range of 3.5-4.5~eV and achieving near-zero Gibbs free energy (\dgh) values of 0.18-0.16~eV, conditions ideal for efficient hydrogen adsorption and desorption. Bader charge analysis reveals substantial charge redistribution with enhanced electron accumulation at \ce{Zr} and \ce{N} sites, further driving catalytic performance. This synergy between optimized electronic structure and catalytic properties establishes \ce{Zr}-doped MXenes as cost-effective, high-performance alternatives to noble metals for HER. By combining exceptional catalytic efficiency with scalability, our work positions \ce{Zr}-doped MXenes as a breakthrough for green hydrogen production, offering a robust pathway toward renewable energy technologies and advancing the design of next-generation non-precious metal catalysts.

Title: Temperature-Distance Relations in Casimir Physics
Authors: Mathias Bostrom, A. Gholamhosseinian, J. J. Marchetta, R. W. Corkery, I. Brevik
Abstract: The Casimir-Lifshitz force arises from thermal and quantum mechanical fluctuations between classical bodies and becomes significant below the micron scale. We explore temperature-distance relations based on the concepts of Wick and Bohr arising from energy-time uncertainty relations. We show that temperature-distance relations similar to those arising from the uncertainty principle are found in various Casimir interactions, with an exact relation occurring in the low-temperature regime when the zero point energy contribution cancels the thermal radiation pressure contribution between two plates.

Title: Charge density wave modulated third-order nonlinear Hall effect in 1$T$-VSe$_2$ nanosheets
Authors: Zhao-Hui Chen, Xin Liao, Jing-Wei Dong, Xing-Yu Liu, Tong-Yang Zhao, Dong Li, An-Qi Wang, Zhi-Min Liao
Abstract: We report the observation of a pronounced third-order nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE) in 1$T$-phase VSe$_2$ nanosheets, synthesized using chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The nanosheets exhibit a charge density wave (CDW) transition at $\sim$77 K. Detailed angle-resolved and temperature-dependent measurements reveal a strong cubic relationship between the third-harmonic Hall voltage $V_{3\omega}^\perp$ and the bias current $I_\omega$, persisting up to room temperature. Notably, the third-order NLHE demonstrates a twofold angular dependence and significant enhancement below the CDW transition temperature, indicative of threefold symmetry breaking in the CDW phase. Scaling analysis suggests that the intrinsic contribution from the Berry connection polarizability tensor is substantially increased in the CDW phase, while extrinsic effects dominate at higher temperatures. Our findings highlight the critical role of CDW-induced symmetry breaking in modulating quantum geometric properties and nonlinear transport phenomena in VSe$_2$, paving the way for future explorations in low-dimensional quantum materials.

Title: Accurate THz Measurements of Permittivity and Permeability of BiFeO3 Thin Films
Authors: Gian Paolo Papari, Zahra Mazaheri, Francesca Lo Presti, Graziella Malandrino, Antonello Andreone
Abstract: The electrodynamic properties of BiFeO3 films in the THz region are investigated via time domain spectroscopy. Combining the use of transmission ($\tilde{T}$) and reflection ($\tilde{R}$) measurements under normal incidence, the refractive index and impedance of the samples under test are evaluated using a retrieval method. From $\tilde{T}$(($\tilde{R}$)) data two complex functions describing the refractive index $\tilde{n}_T$ ($\tilde{n}_R$) and impedance $\tilde{z}_T$ ($\tilde{z}_R$) are extracted from the independent minimization of the error functions given by the difference between the theoretical model and measurements. Knowledge of the pairs ($\tilde{n}_T, \tilde{n}_R$) and ($\tilde{z}_T, \tilde{z}_R$) enables to calculate with a high accuracy both complex permittivity $\tilde{\varepsilon}$ and permeability $\tilde{\mu}$ of the sample. Signatures of magnetoelectric effects and phononic resonances are observed in the permittivity and permeability functions and discussed in detail.

Title: Unravelling The potential of Hybrid Borocarbonitride Biphenylene 2D Network for Thermoelectric Applications: A First Principles Study
Authors: Ajay Kumar Parbati Senapati, Prakash Parida
Abstract: In this study, we investigate a novel hybrid borocarbonitrides (bpn-BCN) 2D material inspired by recent advances in carbon biphenylene synthesis, using first-principles calculations and semi-classical Boltzmann transport theory. Our analysis confirms the structural stability of bpn-BCN through formation energy, elastic coefficients, phonon dispersion, and molecular dynamics simulations at 300 K and 800 K. The material exhibits an indirect band gap of 0.19 eV (PBE) between the X and Y points and a direct band gap of 0.58 eV (HSE) at the X point. Thermoelectric properties reveal a high Seebeck coefficient, peaking at for n-type carriers at 200K along the x-axis, while n-type has a maximum of The electrical conductivity is for hole carriers, surpassing that of conventional 2D materials. The consequences of the high Seebeck coefficient and conductivity reflect a high-power factor with a peak value of at 1000K for p-type carriers along the y-axis whereas, for n-type. Moreover, the highest observed values were 0.78 (0.72) along the x (y) direction at 750 K for p-type and 0.57 (0.53) at 750 K along the x (y) axis for n-type. Our findings suggest that the bpn-BCN 2D network holds significant potential for thermoelectric applications due to its exceptional performance.

Title: Iron-Arsenide monolayer as an anode materials for Lithium-ion batteries: A first-principles study
Authors: Ajay Kumar, Prakash Parida
Abstract: This theoretical investigation delves into the structural, electronic, and electrochemical properties of two hexagonal iron-arsenide monolayers, 1T-FeAs and 1H-FeAs, focusing on their potential as anode materials for Lithium-ion batteries. Previous studies have highlighted the ferromagnetic nature of 1T-FeAs at room this http URL calculations reveal that both phases exhibit metallic behaviour with spin-polarized electronic band structures. Electrochemical studies show that the 1T-FeAs monolayer has better ionic conductivity for Li ions than the 1H-FeAs phase, attributed to a lower activation barrier of 0.38 eV. This characteristic suggests a faster charge/discharge rate. Both FeAs phases exhibit comparable theoretical capacities 374 mAh/g, outperforming commercial graphite anodes. The average open-circuit voltage for maximum Li atom adsorption is 0.61 V for 1H-FeAs and 0.44 V for 1T-FeAs. The volume expansion over the maximum adsorption of Li atoms on both phases is also remarkably less than the commercially used anode material such as graphite. Further, the adsorption of Li atoms onto 1H-FeAs induces a remarkable transition from ferromagnetism to anti-ferromagnetism, with minimal impact on the electronic band structure. In contrast, the original state of 1T-FeAs remains unaffected by Li adsorption. To summarize, the potential of both 1T-FeAs and 1H-FeAs monolayers as promising anode materials for Lithium-ion batteries, offering valuable insights into their electrochemical performance and phase transition behaviour upon Li adsorption.

Title: Theoretical study of {\delta}-5 boron monolayer as an anode material for Li and non-Li ion batteries
Authors: Ajay Kumar, Prakash Parida
Abstract: We have studied the electrochemical performance of the delta-5 boron monolayer as an anode material for alkali metal (AM) and alkali earth metal (AEM) ion batteries using density functional theory simulations. The electronic properties, adsorption, diffusion rate, and storage behavior of various metal atoms (M) in the {\delta}-5 boron monolayer are explored. Our study shows that the delta-5 boron monolayer possesses high electrical conductivity and a low activation barrier for electron and metal ion transit (0.46-1.72 eV), indicating a fast charge/discharge rate. Furthermore, the theoretical capacities of the {\delta}-5 boron monolayer for Li, Na, and K are found to be greater than those of commercial graphite. The average open-circuit voltage for AM and AEM is reasonably low and in the range of 0.14-0.88 V. Our results show that {\delta}-5 boron monolayer could be a promising anode material in lithium-ion and non-lithium ion rechargeable batteries.

Title: Spin nematic order and superconductivity in $J_1$-$J_2$ Kondo lattice model on square lattice
Authors: Sho Uraga, Yasuhiro Tada
Abstract: We investigate competition and cooperation of magnetic frustration and the Kondo effect in the $J_1$-$J_2$ Kondo lattice model on the square lattice at zero temperature. In this model, the frustrated interactions $J_1,J_2$ between the localized spins stabilize spin nematic orders, while the Kondo coupling favors local spin singlets. Using the slave boson mean field approximation, we find that the spin nematic order remains stable against small Kondo coupling, and the localized spins and the conduction electrons are effectively decoupled. On the other hand, a standard Fermi liquid state is formed for sufficiently strong Kondo interactions. Furthermore, in an intermediate region with moderate Kondo coupling, the spin nematic order and the Kondo effect coexist, and superconducting pairing of the conduction electrons is induced by the spinon pairing. We discuss the ground state phase diagram and nature of the quantum phase transitions between the different superconducting states.

Title: Tailoring magnetic properties of CoFeB films via tungsten buffer and capping layers
Authors: L. Saravanan, Nanhe Kumar Gupta, Carlos Garcia, Sujeet Chaudhary
Abstract: Controlling the interface between W and CoFeB-based buffer or capping layers at an appropriate temperature is essential for modifying the strength of magnetic anisotropy. In this work, we systematically explore the impact of W buffer and capping layers on the structural, topological, and magnetic anisotropy properties of W (5 nm)/CoFeB(10 nm) and CoFeB(10 nm)/W(3 nm) bilayers sputtered at room temperature (RT) and annealed at an optimal annealing temperature (TA) of 400 C. Our findings demonstrate that the bilayer films uniaxial magnetic anisotropy (UMA) with out-of-plane coercivity (Hcp) is highly influenced by the W buffer, capping layers, and TA. Specifically, the Hcp of the CoFeB layer with the buffer and capping layers annealed at 400 C samples exceed several times the coercivity of those unannealed. CoFeB buffered with W and annealed at 400 C shows larger Hcp, two-fold UMA, and higher in-plane UMA energy density (Keff) than the CoFeB/W bilayers, which can be attributed to the W buffer layer inducing the crystallization of CoFeB during annealing. The W buffer, capping layers, and the TA for W and CoFeB-based bilayer samples significantly alter the surface morphology, grain sizes, and surface roughness. The XRD analysis reveals nano-crystallites embedded in the larger grains of the 400 C annealed samples. Hence, this work offers a promising approach to achieving high thermal stability of UMA in W and CoFeB-based spintronic applications.

Title: Nanoscale resolved mapping of the dipole emission of hBN color centers with a scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscope

Abstract: Color centers in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are promising candidates as quantum light sources for future technologies. In this work, we utilize a scattering-type near-field optical microscope (s-SNOM) to study the photoluminescence (PL) emission characteristics of such quantum emitters in metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy grown hBN. On the one hand, we demonstrate direct near-field optical excitation and emission through interaction with the nanofocus of the tip resulting in a sub-diffraction limited tip-enhanced PL hotspot. On the other hand, we show that indirect excitation and emission via scattering from the tip significantly increases the recorded PL intensity. This demonstrates that the tip-assisted PL (TAPL) process efficiently guides the generated light to the detector. We apply the TAPL method to map the in-plane dipole orientations of the hBN color centers on the nanoscale. This work promotes the widely available s-SNOM approach to applications in the quantum domain including characterization and optical control.

Title: A Monte Carlo examination for the numerical values of universal quantities in spatial dimension two
Authors: Fu-Jiun Jiang
Abstract: By simulating a two-dimensional (2D) dimerized spin-1/2 antiferromagnet with the quantum Monte Carlo method, the numerical values of two universal quantities associated with the quantum critical regime (QCR), namely $S(\pi,\pi)/\left(\chi_s T\right)$ and $c/\left(T\xi\right)$, are determined. Here $S(\pi,\pi)$, $\chi_s$, $c$, $\xi,$ and $T$ are the staggered structure factor, the staggered susceptibility, the spin-wave velocity, the correlation length, and the temperature, respectively. For other QCR universal quantities, such as the Wilson ratio $W$ and $\chi_u c^2/T$ ($\chi_u$ is the uniform susceptibility), it is shown that the addition of higher order theoretical contribution makes the agreement between the numerical and the analytic results worse. We find that the same scenario applies to $S(\pi,\pi)/\left(\chi_s T\right)$ and $c/\left(T\xi\right)$ as well. Specifically, our calculations lead to $S(\pi,\pi)/\left(\chi_s T\right)\sim 1.073$ and $c/\left(T\xi\right)\sim 0.963$ which are in better consistence with the leading theoretical predictions than those with the next-to-leading order terms. The presented outcome here as well as those in some relevant literature suggest that it is desirable to conduct a refinement of the analytic calculation to resolve the puzzle of why the inclusion of higher order terms leads to less accurate predictions for these universal quantities.

Title: Resolving Contradictory Estimates of Band Gaps of Bulk PdSe$_2$: A Wannier-Localized Optimally-Tuned Screened Range-Separated Hybrid Density Functional Theory Study
Authors: Fred Florio, María Camarasa-Gómez, Guy Ohad, Doron Naveh, Leeor Kronik, Ashwin Ramasubramaniam
Abstract: Palladium diselenide (PdSe$_2$) -- a layered van der Waals material -- is attracting significant attention for optoelectronics due to the wide tunability of its band gap from the infrared through the visible range as a function of the number of layers. However, there continues to be disagreement over the precise nature and value of the optical band gap of bulk PdSe$_2$, owing to the rather small value of this gap that complicates experimental measurements and their interpretation. Here, we design and employ a Wannier-localized optimally-tuned screened range-separated hybrid (WOT-SRSH) functional to investigate the electronic bandstructures and optical absorption spectra of bulk and monolayer PdSe$_2$. In particular, we account carefully for the finite exciton center-of-mass momentum within a time-dependent WOT-SRSH framework to calculate the \emph{indirect} optical gap and absorption onset accurately. Our results agree well with the best available photoconductivity measurements, as well as with state-of-the-art many-body perturbation theory calculations, confirming that bulk PdSe$_2$ has an optical gap in the mid-infrared (upper-bound of 0.44 eV). More generally, this work further bolsters the utility of the WOT-SRSH approach for predictive modeling of layered semiconductors.

Title: Pyrochlore NaYbO2: A potential Quantum Spin Liquid Candidate
Authors: Chuanyan Fan, Tieyan Chang, Longlong Fan, Simon J. Teat, Feiyu Li, Xiaoran Feng, Chao Liu, Shi-lei Wang, Huifen Ren, Jiazheng Hao, Zhaohui Dong, Lunhua He, Shanpeng Wang, Chengwang Niu, Yu-Sheng Chen, Xutang Tao, Junjie Zhang
Abstract: The search for quantum spin liquids (QSL) and chemical doping in such materials to explore superconductivity have continuously attracted intense interest. Here, we report the discovery of a potential QSL candidate, pyrochlore-lattice beta-NaYbO2. Colorless and transparent NaYbO2 single crystals, layered alpha-NaYbO2 (~250 um on edge) and octahedral beta-NaYbO2 (~50 um on edge), were grown for the first time. Synchrotron X-ray single crystal diffraction unambiguously determined that the newfound beta-NaYbO2 belongs to the three-dimensional pyrochlore structure characterized by the R-3m space group, corroborated by synchrotron X-ray and neutron powder diffraction and pair distribution function. Magnetic measurements revealed no long-range magnetic order or spin glass behavior down to 0.4 K with a low boundary spin frustration factor of 17.5, suggesting a potential QSL ground state. Under high magnetic fields, the potential QSL state was broken and spins order. Our findings reveal that NaYbO2 is a fertile playground for studying novel quantum states.

Title: Quantum correlations and spatial localization in trapped one-dimensional ultra-cold Bose-Bose-Bose mixtures
Authors: Tran Duong Anh-Tai, Miguel A. García-March, Thomas Busch, Thomás Fogarty
Abstract: We systematically investigate and illustrate the complete ground-state phase diagram for a one-dimensional, three-species mixture of a few repulsively interacting bosons trapped harmonically. To numerically obtain the solutions to the many-body Schrödinger equation, we employ the improved Exact Diagonalization method [T. D. Anh-Tai {\it et al.}, SciPost Physics 15, 048 (2023)], which is capable of treating strongly-correlated few-body systems from first principles in an efficiently truncated Hilbert space. We present our comprehensive results for all possible combinations of intra- and interspecies interactions in the extreme limits that are either the ideal limit ($g=0$) or close to the hard-core limit ($g\to\infty$). These results show the emergence of unique ground-state properties related to correlations, coherence and spatial localization stemming from strongly repulsive interactions.

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal carbides and nitrides, known as MXenes, possess unique physical and chemical properties, enabling diverse applications in fields ranging from energy storage to communication, catalysis, sensing, healthcare, and beyond. The transition metal and nonmetallic atoms in MXenes can exhibit distinct coordination environments, potentially leading to a wide variety of 2D phases. Despite extensive research and significant advancements, a fundamental understanding of MXenes' phase diversity and its relationship with their hierarchical precursors, including intermediate MAX phases and parent bulk phases, remains limited. Using high-throughput modeling based on first-principles density functional theory, we unveil a wide range of MXenes and comprehensively evaluate their relative stabilities across a large chemical space. The key lies in considering both octahedral and trigonal prismatic coordination environments characteristic of various bulk phases. Through this comprehensive structural library of MXenes, we uncover a close alignment between the phase stability of MXenes and that of their hierarchical 3D counterparts. Building on this, we demonstrate a new design strategy where the atomic coordination environments in parent bulk phases can serve as reliable predictors for the design of MXenes, reducing reliance on intermediate MAX phases. Our study significantly expands the landscape of MXenes, at least doubling the number of possible structures.

Title: Giant Anomalous Hall Effect in Kagome Nodal Surface Semimetal Fe$_3$Ge
Authors: Shu-Xiang Li, Wencheng Wang, Sheng Xu, Tianhao Li, Zheng Li, Jinjin Wang, Jun-Jian Mi, Qian Tao, Feng Tang, Xiangang Wan, Zhu-An Xu
Abstract: It is well known that the intrinsic anomalous Hall effect (AHE) arises from the integration of the non-zero Berry curvature (BC), conventionally observed in the Dirac/Weyl and nodal-line semimetals. Moreover, nodal surface semimetals are expected to exhibit more significant BC under the prevalence of degenerate points near the Fermi level. In this work, we report the detection of a giant AHE in the Kagome magnet Fe$_3$Ge with a two-dimensional (2D) nodal surface (NS) at $k_{z}=\pi$ plane, exhibiting an anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) of 1500 $\Omega^{-1}$cm$^{-1}$ at 160 K, the highest among all reported Kagome topological materials. This finding suggests a new platform for searching large AHC materials and facilitates potential room-temperature applications in spintronic devices and quantum computing.

Title: Optimizing the Critical Temperature and Superfluid Density of a Metal-Superconductor Bilayer
Authors: Yutan Zhang, Philip M. Dee, Benjamin Cohen-Stead, Thomas A. Maier, Steven Johnston, Richard Scalettar
Abstract: A promising path to realizing higher superconducting transition temperatures $T_c$ is the strategic engineering of artificial heterostructures. For example, quantum materials exhibiting some but not all of the characteristics necessary for a robust superconducting state could, in principle, be coupled with other materials in a way that alleviates their intrinsic shortcomings. In this work, we add numerical support to the hypothesis that a strongly interacting superconductor weakened by phase fluctuations can boost its $T_c$ by hybridizing the system with a metal. Using determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC), we simulate a two-dimensional bilayer composed of an attractive Hubbard model and a metallic layer in two regimes of the interaction strength $-|U|$. In the strongly interacting regime, we find that increasing the interlayer hybridization $t_\perp$ results in a nonmonotonic enhancement of $T_c$, with an optimal value comparable to the maximum $T_c$ observed in the single-layer attractive Hubbard model, confirming trends inferred from other approaches. In the intermediate coupling regime, when $-|U|$ is close to the value associated with the maximum $T_c$ of the single-layer model, increasing $t_\perp$ tends to decrease $T_c$, implying that the correlated layer was already optimally tuned. Importantly, we demonstrate that the mechanism behind these trends is related to enhancement in the superfluid stiffness, as was initially proposed by Kivelson [Physica B: Condensed Matter 318, 61 (2002)].

Title: The Connection between Spin Wave Polarization and Dissipation
Authors: Yutian Wang, Jiongjie Wang, Ruoban Ma, Jiang Xiao
Abstract: This study establishes a fundamental connection between the dissipation and polarization of spin waves, which are often treated as independent phenomena. Through theoretical analysis and numerical validation, we demonstrate that within the linearized spin wave regime, a spin wave mode's dissipation rate, defined as the ratio of linewidth to the resonance frequency, exceeds Gilbert damping by a factor given by its spatially averaged polarization. This average is governed by a non-positive definite weight, whose magnitude depends on the magnon density of the local excitation, while its sign is dictated by the local polarization handedness. Remarkably, this universal connection applies across diverse magnetic interactions and textures, offering crucial insights into spin wave dynamics and dissipation.

Title: Spin-imbalance induced buried topological edge currents in Mott \& topological insulator heterostructures
Authors: Rahul Ghosh, Subhajyoti Pal, Kush Saha, Anamitra Mukherjee
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the heterostructure between a ferrimagnetic Mott insulator and a time-reversal invariant topological band insulator on the two-dimensional Lieb lattice with periodic boundary conditions. Our Hartree-Fock and slave-rotor mean-field results incorporate long-range Coulomb interactions. We present charge and magnetic reconstructions at the two edges of the heterostructure and reveal how \textit{buried} topological edge modes adapt to these heterostructure edge reconstructions. In particular, we demonstrate that the interface magnetic field induces a spin imbalance in the edge modes while preserving their topological character and metallic nature. We show that this imbalance leads to topologically protected buried spin and charge currents. The inherent spin-momentum locking ensures that left and right movers contribute to the current at the two buried interfaces in opposite directions. We show that the magnitude of the spin-imbalance induced charge and spin current can be tuned by adjusting the spin-orbit coupling of the bulk topological insulator relative to the correlation strength of the bulk Mott insulator. Thus, our results demonstrate a controlled conversion of a spin Hall effect into an analog of a charge Hall effect driven by band topology and interaction effects. These topologically protected charge and spin currents pave the way for advances in low-energy electronics and spintronic devices.

Title: Synthetic Gauge Field for Ultracold Atoms Induced by Vector Beams
Authors: Huan Wang, Shangguo Zhu, Yun Long, Mingbo Pu, Xiangang Luo
Abstract: Vector beams (VBs) with spatially varying polarization have broad applications across various fields of optics. We introduce a novel use of VBs to generate synthetic gauge fields for ultracold atoms. By leveraging VBs' rich tunability, this scheme enables the emergence of angular stripe phases over a significantly expanded parameter range, achieving a three-orders-of-magnitude enhancement in the phase diagram and thereby making experimental observation feasible. It also allows for the creation of topologically nontrivial giant skyrmions in spin space, with tunable topology controlled by VB parameters and without requiring rotation. Our work opens new avenues for utilizing VBs in quantum control of ultracold atoms and the exploration of exotic quantum states and phases.

Title: Transverse Field Dependence of the Ground State in the Z2 Bose-Hubbard Model
Authors: Yuma Watanabe, Shohei Watabe, Tetsuro Nikuni
Abstract: The study of interaction between the particle and lattice degrees of freedom is one of the central interests in the quantum many-body systems. The Z2 Bose-Hubbard model has been proposed to describe ultracold bosons in a dynamical optical lattice. This model introduces the lattice degrees of freedom by placing half-spins on the bonds between neighboring lattice sites. In this study, we investigate the effect of spin fluctuations on the ground state by using the density-matrix renormalization group method. By calculating the spin structure factor and the compressibility, we show that there is a phase transition between two spatially nonuniform states. We also discuss the ground state in the strong transverse magnetic field.

Title: Bi-Josephson Effect in a Driven-Dissipative Supersolid
Authors: Jieli Qin, Shijie Li, Yijia Tu, Maokun Gu, Lin Guan, Weimin Xu, Lu Zhou
Abstract: The Josephson effect is a macroscopic quantum tunneling phenomenon in a system with superfluid property, when it is split into two parts by a barrier. Here, we examine the Josephson effect in a driven-dissipative supersolid realized by coupling Bose-Einstein condensates to an optical ring cavity. We show that the spontaneous breaking of spatial translation symmetry in supersolid makes the location of the splitting barrier have a significant influence on the Josephson effect. Remarkably, for the same splitting barrier, depending on its location, two different types of DC Josephson currents are found in the supersolid phase (compared to only one type found in the superfluid phase). Thus, we term it a bi-Josephson effect. We examine the Josephson relationships and critical Josephson currents in detail, revealing that the emergence of supersolid order affects these two types of DC Josephson currents differently -- one is enhanced, while the other is suppressed. The findings of this work unveil unique Josephson physics in the supersolid phase, and show new opportunities to build novel Josephson devices with supersolids.

Title: Complete classification of integrability and non-integrability of S=1/2 spin chains with symmetric next-nearest-neighbor interaction
Authors: Naoto Shiraishi
Abstract: We study S=1/2 quantum spin chains with shift-invariant and inversion-symmetric next-nearest-neighbor interaction, also known as zigzag spin chains. We completely classify the integrability and non-integrability of the above class of spin systems. We prove that in this class there are only two integrable models, a classical model and a model solvable by the Bethe ansatz, and all the remaining systems are non-integrable. Our classification theorem confirms that within this class of spin chains, there is no missing integrable model. This theorem also implies the absence of intermediate models with a finite number of local conserved quantities.

Title: Determination of the London penetration depth with the tunnel diode oscillator technique
Authors: G. P. Mikitik
Abstract: Using a distribution of the Meissner currents over the surface of an infinitely long superconducting slab with a rectangular cross section, the magnetic moment of the slab is calculated, taking into account corrections associated with a small but finite value of the London penetration depth $\lambda$. Since these corrections determine the shift of the resonant frequency in the tunnel diode oscillator technique, formulas for determination of $\lambda$ within this technique are derived for the slab. These formulas are valid for any aspect ratio of its cross section, and they differ from those that are often used in analyzing experimental data. Namely, it is shown that sharp edges of the slab can cause the large frequency shift proportional to the change in the value of $\lambda^{2/3}$. Although this result complicates the extraction of a temperature dependence of $\lambda$ from the frequency shift, it also opens up new possibilities in determining the London penetration depth. In particular, under certain conditions, it is possible not only to measure the changes in $\lambda$ with the temperature, but also to estimate its absolute value.

Title: Improving accuracy of tree-tensor network approach by optimization of network structure
Authors: Toshiya Hikihara, Hiroshi Ueda, Kouichi Okunishi, Kenji Harada, Tomotoshi Nishino
Abstract: Numerical methods based on tensor networks have been extensively explored in the research of quantum many-body systems in recent years. It has been recognized that the ability of tensor networks to describe a quantum many-body state crucially depends on the spatial structure of the network. In the previous work, we proposed an algorithm based on tree tensor networks (TTNs) that automatically optimizes the structure of TTN according to the spatial profile of entanglement in the state of interest. In this paper, we precisely analyze how detailed updating schemes in the structural optimization algorithm affect its computational accuracy for the random XY-exchange model under random magnetic fields and the Richardson model. We then find that for the random XY model, on the one hand, the algorithm achieves improved accuracy, and the stochastic algorithm, which selects the local network structure probabilistically, is notably effective. For the Richardson model, on the other hand, the resulting numerical accuracy subtly depends on the initial TTN and the updating schemes. In particular, the algorithm without the stochastic updating scheme certainly improves the accuracy, while the one with the stochastic updates results in poor accuracy due to the effect of randomizing the network structure at the early stage of the calculation. These results indicate that the algorithm successfully improves the accuracy of the numerical calculations for quantum many-body states, while it is essential to appropriately choose the updating scheme as well as the initial TTN structure, depending on the systems treated.

Title: Simultaneous Superconducting and Topological Properties in Mg-Li Electrides at High Pressures
Authors: D. Wang, H. Song, Q. Hao, G. Yang, H. Wang, L. Zhang, Y. Chen, X. Chen, Hua Y. Geng
Abstract: Electrides as a unique class of emerging materials exhibit fascinating properties and hold important significance for understanding the matter under extreme conditions, which is characterized by valence electrons localized into the interstitial space as quasi-atoms (ISQs). In this work, using crystal structure prediction and first-principles calculations, we identified seven stable phases of Mg-Li that are electride with novel electronic properties under high pressure. Among them, MgLi10 is a semiconductor with a band gap of 0.22 eV; and Pm-3m MgLi is superconductor with a superconducting transition temperature of 22.8 K. The important role played by the localization degree of ISQ in the superconducting transition temperature of these electrides is revealed by systematic comparison of Mg-Li with other Li-rich electride superconductors. Furthermore, we proved that Pm-3m MgLi and Pnma MgLi also have distinct topological behavior with metallic surface states and the non-zero $Z_2$ invariant. The simultaneous coexistence of superconductivity, electronic band topology and electride property in the same structure of Pm-3m MgLi and Pnma MgLi demonstrates the feasibility of realizing multi-quantum phases in a single material, which will stimulate further research in these interdisciplinary fields.

Title: Gate Tunable Josephson Diode Effect in Josephson Junctions made from InAs Nanosheets
Authors: Shili Yan, Yi Luo, Haitian Su, Han Gao, Xingjun Wu, Dong Pan, Jianhua Zhao, Ji-Yin Wang, Hongqi Xu
Abstract: We report the observation of Josephson diode effect (JDE) in hybrid devices made from semiconductor InAs nanosheets and superconductor Al contacts. By applying an in-plane magnetic field ($B_{\mathrm{xy}}$), we detect non-reciprocal superconducting switching current as well as non-reciprocal superconducting retrapping current. The strength of the JDE depends on the angle between the in-plane magnetic field and the bias current ($I_{\mathrm{b}}$), reaching its maximum when $B_{\mathrm{xy}} \perp I_{\mathrm{b}}$ and dropping to nearly zero when $B_{\mathrm{xy}}\parallel I_{\mathrm{b}}$. Additionally, the diode efficiency is tunable via an electrostatic gate with a complete suppression at certain gate voltages. Our findings indicate that the observed JDE in InAs nanosheet-based Josephson junctions most likely arises from the Rashba spin-orbit interaction (SOI) in the nanosheets. Such gate-tunable JDE in Josephson junctions made from semiconductor material with SOI is useful not only for constructing advanced superconducting electronics but also for detecting novel superconducting states.

Title: Pressure induced Structure Change and Anomalies in Thermodynamic Quantities and Transport Properties in Liquid Lithium Hydride
Authors: X. Z. Yan, Y. M. Chen, Hua Y. Geng, Y. F. Wang, Y. Sun, L. L. Zhang, H. Wang, Y. L. Xu
Abstract: Understand the nature of liquid structure and its evolution under different conditions is a major challenge in condensed physics and materials science. Here, we report a pressure-induced structure change spanning a wide pressure range in liquid-state lithium hydride (LiH) by first-principles molecular dynamic simulations. This behavior can be described as a continuous crossover from low pressure liquid with Li$^+$-H$^-$ duality symmetry to high pressure one with broken of duality symmetry. The thermodynamic quantities such as heat capacity and ionic transport properties such as diffusivity are also saliently impacted. It is important to stress that such behavior is firstly predicted for this category of materials, which is ubiquitous in universe as well as in industry applications. Lastly, a comprehensive high-pressure high-temperature phase diagram of LiH is constructed, which embodies rich physics in this previously-thought-simple ionic compound.

Title: Dispersive measurement of spin shot noise in a Bose--Einstein condensate
Authors: Kosuke Shibata, Naota Sekiguchi, Junnosuke Takai, Takuya Hirano
Abstract: We report dispersive spin shot noise measurement of a Bose--Einstein condensate (BEC). While dispersive probing has been used for quantum spin noise measurement of thermal and cold gases for decades, confirmative measurement of spin shot noise, i.e.,\ the linear dependence of the spin variance on the number of atoms in a BEC has been lacking. Here, we demonstrate precise spin noise measurement of a BEC of rubidium atoms at the spin shot noise level by polarization rotation using a two-color probe at optimal detunings, with power balance stabilization to suppress probe-induced excess spin noise. This work opens the possibility for the unexplored study of quantum spin fluctuations in multi-component or spinor BECs and offers an approach to improve spin measurement precision, which is relevant to atomic spin-based sensors.

Title: Mixing and Ergodicity in Systems with Long-Range Interactions
Authors: Tarcísio Nunes Teles, Renato Pakter, Yan Levin
Abstract: We present a theory of collisionless relaxation in systems with long-range interactions. Contrary to Lynden-Bell's theory of violent relaxation, which assumes global ergodicity and mixing, we show that quasi-stationary states (qSS) observed in these systems exhibit broken global ergodicity. We propose that relaxation towards equilibrium occurs through a process of local mixing, where particles spread over energy shells defined by the manifold to which their trajectories are confined. To demonstrate our theory, we study the Hamiltonian Mean Field (HMF) model, a paradigmatic system with long-range interactions. Our theory accurately predicts the particle distribution functions in qSS observed in molecular dynamics simulations without any adjustable parameters. Additionally, it precisely forecasts the phase transitions observed in the HMF model.

Title: First-principle based Floquet engineering of solids in the velocity gauge
Authors: Vishal Tiwari, Ignacio Franco
Abstract: We introduce a practical and accurate strategy to capture light-matter interactions using the Floquet formalism in the velocity gauge in combination with realistic first-principle models of solids. The velocity gauge, defined by the linear coupling to the vector potential, is a standard method to capture the light-matter interaction in solids. However, its use with first-principle models has been limited by the challenging fact that it requires a large number of bands for convergence and its incompatibility with non-local pseudopotential plane wave methods. To improve its convergence properties, we explicitly take into account the truncation of Hilbert space in the construction of the Floquet Hamiltonian in the velocity gauge. To avoid the incompatibility with the pseudopotentials, we base our computations on generalized tight-binding Hamiltonians derived from first-principles through maximally-localized Wannier functions. We exemplify the approach by computing the optical absorption spectra of laser-dressed trans-polyacetylene chain using realistic electronic structure. We show that, by proceeding in this way, Floquet consideration involving the truncated Hilbert spaces reproduces the full basis calculations with only a few bands and with significantly reduced computation time. The strategy has been implemented in FloqticS, a general code for the Floquet engineering of the optical properties of materials. Overall, this work introduces a useful theoretical tool to realize Floquet engineering of realistic solids in the velocity gauge.

Title: The Impact of Mechanical Strain on Magnetic and Structural Properties of 2D Materials: A Monte Carlo study
Authors: Aytac Celik
Abstract: The inherent flexibility of two dimensional materials allows for efficient manipulation of their physical properties through strain application, which is essential for the development of advanced nanoscale devices. This study aimed to understand the impact of mechanical strain on the magnetic properties of two dimensional materials using Monte Carlo simulations. The effects of several strain states on the magnetic properties were investigated using the Lennard Jones potential and bond length-dependent exchange interactions. The key parameters analyzed include the Lindemann coefficient, radial distribution function, and magnetization in relation to temperature and magnetic field. The results indicate that applying biaxial tensile strain generally reduces the critical temperature. In contrast, the biaxial compressive strain increased Tc within the elastic range, but decreased at higher strain levels. Both compressive and tensile strains significantly influence the ferromagnetic properties and structural ordering, as evidenced by magnetization hysteresis. Notably, pure shear strain did not induce disorder, leaving the magnetization unaffected. In addition, our findings suggest the potential of domain-formation mechanisms. This study provides comprehensive insights into the influence of mechanical strain on the magnetic behavior and structural integrity of 2D materials, offering valuable guidance for future research and advanced material design applications.

Title: Sensitive particle shape dependence of growth-induced mesoscale nematic structure
Authors: Jonas Isensee, Philip Bittihn
Abstract: Directed growth, anisotropic cell shapes, and confinement drive self-organization in multicellular systems. We investigate the influence of particle shape on the distribution and dynamics of nematic microdomains in a minimal in-silico model of proliferating, sterically interacting particles, akin to colonies of rod-shaped bacteria. By introducing continuously tuneable tip variations around a common rod shape with spherical caps, we find that subtle changes significantly impact the emergent dynamics, leading to distinct patterns of microdomain formation and stability. Our analysis reveals separate effects of particle shape and aspect ratio, as well as a transition from exponential to scale-free size distributions, which we recapitulate using an effective master equation model. This allows us to relate differences in microdomain size distributions to different physical mechanisms of microdomain breakup. Our results thereby contribute to the characterization of the effective dynamics in growing aggregates at large and intermediate length scales and the microscopic properties that control it. This could be relevant both for biological self-organization and design strategies for future artificial systems.

Title: Floquet optical selection rules in black phosphorus
Authors: Benshu Fan, Umberto De Giovannini, Hannes Hübener, Shuyun Zhou, Wenhui Duan, Angel Rubio, Peizhe Tang
Abstract: The optical selection rules endorsed by symmetry are crucial for understanding the optical properties of quantum materials and the associated ultrafast spectral phenomena. Herein, we introduce momentum-resolved Floquet optical selection rules using the group theory to elucidate the pump-probe photoemission spectral distributions of monolayer black phosphorus (BP), which are governed by the symmetries of both the material and the lasers. Using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), we further investigate the dynamical evolution of Floquet(-Volkov) states in the photoemission spectra of monolayer BP, revealing their spectral weights at specific momenta for each sideband. These observations are comprehensively explained by the proposed Floquet optical selection rules. Our framework not only clarifies experimental photoemission spectra but also uncovers novel characteristics under different pump-probe configurations. Our results are expected to deepen the understanding of light-induced ultrafast spectra in BP and can be further extended to other Floquet systems.

Title: Anomalous temperature-dependent magnetization in the nearly collinear antiferromagnet Y$_2$Co$_3$
Authors: Yunshu Shi, Huibo Cao, Hung-Cheng Wu, Li Yin, Neil Harrison, David S. Parker, Tushar Bhowmick, Tessa McNamee, Fatemeh Safari, Sergey L. Budko, James C. Fettinger, Susan M. Kauzlarich, Peter Klavins, Dmitry Popov, Ravhi Kumar, Russell J. Hemley, Shanti Deemyad, Taku J. Sato, Paul. C. Canfield, Valentin Taufour
Abstract: Y$_2$Co$_3$ is a newly discovered antiferromagnetic (AFM) compound with distorted kagome layers. Previous investigations via bulk magnetization measurements suggested a complex noncollinear magnetic behavior, with magnetic moments primarily anti-aligned along the $b$ axis and some canting towards the $ac$ plane. In this study, we report the magnetic structure of Y$_2$Co$_3$ to be an A-type AFM structure with ferromagnetic (FM) interactions within the distorted kagome plane and an interplane antiferromagnetic interaction, as determined by single-crystal neutron diffraction. The magnetic moments align along the $b$ axis, with minimal canting towards the $c$ axis, at odds with the previous interpretation of bulk magnetization measurements. The magnetic moments on the two distinct Co sites are [0, -0.68(3), 0] $\mu_B$ and [0, 1.25(4), 0.07(1)] $\mu_B$. We attribute the previously reported "noncollinear" behavior to the considerable temperature dependence of itinerant AFM exchange interactions, induced by thermal contraction along the $b$ axis. Additionally, our examination of lattice constants through pressure studies reveals compensating effects on FM and AFM interactions, resulting in negligible pressure dependence of $T_\textrm{N}$.

Title: The significance of "stripes" in the physics of the cuprates, the Hubbard model, and other highly correlated electronic systems
Authors: Thomas P. Devereaux, Steven A. Kivelson
Abstract: "Stripes" - meaning unidirectional charge-density-waves, sometimes (but not always) accompanied by spin-density-waves with twice the period - are now known to arise in broad swathes of the cuprate phase diagram, and appear as a strong ordering tendency in numerical studies of Hubbard-like models of highly correlated electron systems. Jan Zaanen's work played a seminal role in predicting their existence, and exploring their possible significance. They are {\it not} related to any weak-coupling physics associated with some form of Fermi-surface nesting. And whether one likes them or not, they are surprisingly difficult to avoid; in the Hubbard model, for example, they often appear as an alternative order that can out-compete the otherwise favored $d$-wave superconductivity.

Title: Quasi-aperiodic grain boundary phases in {\Sigma}5 tilt grain boundaries in refractory metals
Authors: Enze Chen, Timofey Frolov
Abstract: We report new quasi-aperiodic, ground-state structures and phase transitions in $\Sigma5$ tilt grain boundaries (GBs) in body-centered cubic (BCC) refractory metals Nb, Ta, Mo, and W. $\Sigma5$ tilt GBs have been extensively investigated over the past several decades, with their ground-state structure -- composed of kite-shaped structural units -- previously thought to be well understood. By performing a rigorous GB structure search that optimizes the number of atoms in the boundary core, we predict new quasi-aperiodic "split kite" phases analogous to those previously found in GBs in face-centered cubic metals. Our results suggest that complex aperiodic phases of GBs appear to be a general phenomenon. Density functional theory calculations yield similar GB energies and structures for kite and split kite phases in all BCC metals studied. Phase-contrast image simulations of split kites show better agreement with experimental observations, offering an alternative explanation for previous microscopy results and motivating future atomically resolved imaging of the GB structure.

Title: The geometric impact of the quantum Hall interface on a cone
Authors: Jie Li, Qi Li, Zi-Xiang Hu
Abstract: Recently, quantum Hall interface has become a popular subject of research; distinct from that of the quantum Hall edge, which is constrained by external background confinement, the interface has the freedom to move, likely towards a string-like state. In disk geometry, it was known that the interface energy has an extra correction due to its curvature which depends on the size of the disk. In this work, we analytically calculate the energy of the integer quantum Hall interface on a cone surface which has the advantage that its curvature is more easily adjustable. By tuning the length and curvature of the interface by the cone angle parameter $\beta$, we analyze the dependence of the quantum Hall interface energy on the curvature and verify this geometric correction. Moreover, we find that the tip of the cone geometry has an extra contribution to the energy that reflects on the $u_2,u_4$ term.

Title: An ab initio dataset of size-dependent effective thermal conductivity for advanced technology transistors
Authors: Han Xie, Ru Jia, Yonglin Xia, Lei Li, Yue Hu, Jiaxuan Xu, Yufei Sheng, Yuanyuan Wang, Hua Bao
Abstract: As the size of transistors shrinks and power density increases, thermal simulation has become an indispensable part of the device design procedure. However, existing works for advanced technology transistors use simplified empirical models to calculate effective thermal conductivity in the simulations. In this work, we present a dataset of size-dependent effective thermal conductivity with electron and phonon properties extracted from ab initio computations. Absolute in-plane and cross-plane thermal conductivity data of eight semiconducting materials (Si, Ge, GaN, AlN, 4H-SiC, GaAs, InAs, BAs) and four metallic materials (Al, W, TiN, Ti) with the characteristic length ranging from 5 to 50 nanometers have been provided. Besides the absolute value, normalized effective thermal conductivity is also given, in case it needs to be used with updated bulk thermal conductivity in the future. The dataset presented in this paper are openly available at this https URL.

Title: Electrically driven resonant magnetization, spin-pumping and charge-to-spin conversion from chiral-spin modes at THz frequencies
Authors: Mojdeh Saleh, Abhishek Kumar, Dmitrii L. Maslov, Saurabh Maiti
Abstract: Chiral-spin modes are collective excitations of a spin-orbit (SO) coupled system that lead to resonances in many observables. Here we identify resonances in "cross-response", i.e., electric-field induced magnetization and magnetic-field induced electric currents, known also as the Edelstein effect and its inverse, respectively. We show that the chiral-spin modes resonantly enhance the electrically induced magnetization. As specific examples, we consider a single-valley two-dimensional electron gas with Rashba or Dresselhaus SO coupling and a two-valley Dirac system with proximity-induced Rashba and valley-Zeeman SO couplings. We suggest an architecture for a spin-pumping experiment based on THz excitation of chiral-spin modes, which would demonstrate a resonant enhancement of charge-to-spin conversion.

Title: Magnon-mediated perpendicular magnetization switching by topological crystalline insulator SnTe with high spin Hall conductivity
Authors: Pengnan Zhao, Guoyi Shi, Wentian Lu, Lihuan Yang, Hui Ru Tan, Kaiwei Guo, Jia-Min Lai, Zhonghai Yu, Anjan Soumyanarayanan, Zhe Yuan, Fei Wang, Xiaohong Xu, Hyunsoo Yang
Abstract: Magnons possess the ability to transport spin angular momentum in insulating magnetic materials, a characteristic that sets them apart from traditional electronics where power consumption arises from the movement of electrons. However, the practical application of magnon devices demands room temperature operation and low switching power of perpendicular magnetization. Here we demonstrate the low-power manipulation of perpendicular magnetization via magnon torques in SnTe/NiO/CoFeB devices at room temperature. Topological crystalline insulator SnTe exhibits a high spin Hall conductivity of $\sigma_s \approx 6.1\times 10^4 (\hbar/2e)\cdot (\Omega \cdot m)^{-1}$, which facilitates the generation of magnon currents in an antiferromagnetic insulator NiO. The magnon currents traverse the 20-nm-thick NiO layer and subsequently exert magnon torques on the adjacent ferromagnetic layer, leading to magnetization switching. Notably, we achieve a 22-fold reduction in power consumption in SnTe/NiO/CoFeB heterostructures compared to Bi2Te3/NiO/CoFeB control samples. Our findings establish the low-power perpendicular magnetization manipulation through magnon torques, significantly expanding the range of topological materials with practical applications.

Title: On Virial Expansion in Hard Sphere Model
Authors: Kiyoharu Kawana
Abstract: Virial expansion is a traditional approach in statistical mechanics that expresses thermodynamic quantities, such as pressure $p$, as power series of density or chemical potential. Its radius of convergence can serve as a potential indicator of phase transition. In this study, we investigate the virial expansion of the hard-sphere model, using the known dimensionless virial coefficients $\tilde{B}_k^{}~(k=1,2,\cdots)$ up to the $12$th order. We find that it is well fitted by $\tilde{B}_k^{}=1.28\times k^{1.90}$, corresponding to the analytic continuation of the virial expansion of the pressure as $\sim \mathrm{Li}_{-1.90}^{}(\eta)$, where $\eta$ is the packing fraction and $\mathrm{Li}_s^{}(x)$ is the polylogarithm function. This implies the absence of singular behavior in the physical parameter space $\eta\leq \eta_{\mathrm{max}}^{}\approx 0.74$ and no indication of phase transition in the virial expansion approach. In addition, we calculate the cluster-integral coefficients $\{b_l^{}\}_{l=1}^\infty$ and observe that their asymptotic behavior resembles the results obtained in the large dimension limit ($D\rightarrow \infty$), suggesting that $D=3$ might be already regarded as large dimension. However, the existence of phase transition in the hard-sphere model has been confirmed by numerous simulations, which clearly indicates that a naive extrapolation of the virial series can lead to unphysical results.

Title: Absence of two-phonon quasi-elastic scattering in the normal state of doped--SrTiO$_3$ by THz pump-probe spectroscopy
Authors: K. Santhosh Kumar, David Barbalas, Rishi Bhandia, Dooyong Lee, Shivasheesh Varshney, Bharat Jalan, N. P. Armitage
Abstract: Multi-pulse nonlinear THz spectroscopies enable a new understanding of interacting metallic systems via their sensitivity to novel correlation functions. Here, we investigated the THz nonlinear properties of the dilute metallic phase of doped-SrTiO$_3$ thin films using nonlinear terahertz 2D coherent spectroscopy. We observed a large $\chi^{(3)}$ response in the low temperature region where the dc electrical resistivity follows a T$^2$-dependence. This is largely a pump-probe response, which we find is governed by a single energy relaxation rate that is much smaller at all temperatures than the momentum relaxation rates obtained from the optical conductivity. This indicates that the processes that dominate the resistive scattering are not the same as those that remove energy from the electronic system. Moreover the fact that the energy relaxation rate is an increasing function of temperature indicates that the excitations that do carry away energy from the electronic system cannot be considered as quasi-elastic and as such soft two-phonon electron scattering does not play a major role in the physics as proposed. This indicates that these materials' resistive T$^2$ scattering likely originates in electron-electron interactions despite the very small Fermi wave vectors at the lowest dopings.

Title: Overdoping YBa2Cu3O7 via a heterostructure with La0.67Sr0.33MnO3
Authors: Ankita Singh, Sawani Datta, Ram Prakash Pandeya, Srinivas C. Kandukuri, Mahesh Gokhale, Kalobaran Maiti
Abstract: YBa2Cu3Ox, the first superconductor discovered with Tc higher than 77 K, is among the most complex cuprates having both CuO chains and plains in the structure. YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO) exhibits slightly overdoped behavior and further doping is difficult as all the lattice sites in the CuO chains are occupied. We have grown high quality single crystalline films of YBCO and bilayer La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 (LSMO)/YBCO exhibiting superconductivity in both the cases. Photoemission spectra reveal different surface and bulk electronic structures; the difference reduces in the bilayer. Evidence of charge transfer across the bilayer interface is observed in the valence band and core level spectra indicating an overdoped condition in YBCO. While superconductivity in the presence of magnetic order in the bilayer is puzzling, this pathway to reach overdoped regime in YBCO opens up a new landscape to probe the exotic physics of unconventional superconductivity.

Title: Reliable Density Functional Theory Predictions of Bandgaps for Materials
Authors: Chenxi Lu, Musen Li, Michael J. Ford, Rika Kobayashi, Roger Amos, Jeffrey R.Reimers
Abstract: We consider methods for optimizing the bandgap calculation of 3D materials, considering 340 sample materials. Examined are the effects of the choice of the pseudopotential to describe core electrons, the plane-wave basis set cutoff energy, and the Brillouin zone integration. Cost-saving calculations in which the structure is optimized using reduced-quality Brillouin zone integrations and cutoff energies were found to lead to experimentally significant errors exceeding 0.1 eV in 18% of cases using the PBE functional and 21% of cases using PBE0. Such cost-savings approaches are therefore not recommended for general applications. Also, the current practice of using unoptimized grids to perform the Brillouin-zone integrations in bandgap calculations is found to be unreliable for 16% of materials using PBE and for 23% using PBE0. A k-space optimization scheme is introduced that interpolates extensive PBE results to determine a generally useful approach that when used in PBE0 calculations is found to be inadequate for only 1.6% of the materials studied.

Title: Investigation of Sub-configurations Reveals Stable Spin-Orbit Torque Switching Polarity in Polycrystalline Mn3Sn
Authors: Boyu Zhao, Zhengde Xu, Xue Zhang, Zhenhang Kong, Shuyuan Shi, Zhifeng Zhu
Abstract: Previous studies have demonstrated the switching of octupole moment in Mn3Sn driven by spin-orbit torque (SOT). However, they have not accounted for the polycrystalline nature of the sample when explaining the switching mechanism. In this work, we use samples with various atomic orientations to capture this polycrystalline nature. We thoroughly investigate their SOT-induced spin dynamics and demonstrate that the polycrystalline structure leads to distinct outcomes. Our findings reveal that configuration II, where the Kagome plane is perpendicular to the spin polarization, exhibits robust switching with stable polarity, whereas the signals from various sub-configurations in configuration I cancel each other out. By comparing our findings with experimental results, we pinpoint the primary sources contributing to the measured AHE signals. Additionally, we establish a dynamic balance model that incorporates the unique properties of Mn3Sn to elucidate these observations. Our study highlights the essential role of the polycrystalline nature in understanding SOT switching. By clarifying the underlying physical mechanisms, our work resolves the longstanding puzzle regarding the robust SOT switching observed in Mn3Sn.

Title: Nonlinear valley thermal physics in two dimensional materials
Authors: Shivam Sharma, Abir De Sarkar
Abstract: This study delves into the intrinsic nonlinear valley thermal effects, driven by the Quantum Metric of the system. Our findings elucidate that valley indices in the nonlinear effect are distinguishable by the thermoelectric correction to the orbital magnetization, which adopts opposite signs across valleys mirroring the role of orbital angular momentum in the linear valley Hall effect. Through a prototypical two-band model on an anisotropic tilted Dirac semimetal, we investigate how intrinsic material parameters modulate this nonlinear valley thermal response. Extending to realistic PT symmetric anisotropic semiconductors, our findings enrich the understanding of valley-based phenomena, with implications for advanced theoretical and experimental pursuits in valleytronics and valley caloritonics.

Title: CrySPAI: A new Crystal Structure Prediction Software Based on Artificial Intelligence
Authors: Zongguo Wang, Ziyi Chen, Yang Yuan, Yangang Wang
Abstract: Crystal structure predictions based on the combination of first-principles calculations and machine learning have achieved significant success in materials science. However, most of these approaches are limited to predicting specific systems, which hinders their application to unknown or unexplored domains. In this paper, we present CrySPAI, a crystal structure prediction package developed using artificial intelligence (AI) to predict energetically stable crystal structures of inorganic materials given their chemical compositions. The software consists of three key modules, an evolutionary optimization algorithm (EOA) that searches for all possible crystal structure configurations, density functional theory (DFT) that provides the accurate energy values for these structures, and a deep neural network (DNN) that learns the relationship between crystal structures and their corresponding energies. To optimize the process across these modules, a distributed framework is implemented to parallelize tasks, and an automated workflow has been integrated into CrySPAI for seamless execution. This paper reports the development and implementation of AI AI-based CrySPAI Crystal Prediction Software tool and its unique features.

Title: Self-Adapted Josephson Oscillation of Dark-Bright Solitons under Constant Forces
Authors: Ling-Zheng Meng, Xi-Wang Luo, Li-Chen Zhao
Abstract: We study the propagation of dark-bright solitons in two-component Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) with general nonlinear parameters, and explore how nonlinear interactions enrich the soliton dynamics giving rise to nonsinusoidal oscillations under constant forces. Treating the bright soliton as an effective barrier, we reveal that such oscillations are characterized by the Josephson equations with self-adapted critical current and bias voltage, whose explicit analytic expressions are derived using the Lagrangian variational method. The dynamical phase diagram in nonlinear parameter space is presented, identifying oscillation regions with different skewed sinusoidal dependence, and diffusion regions with irreversible soliton spreading due to instability of the barrier. Furthermore, we obtain periodic dispersion relations of the solitons, indicating a switch between positive and negative inertial masses, consistent with the oscillation behaviors. Our results provide a general and comprehensive theoretical framework for soliton oscillation dynamics and pave the way for investigating various nonlinear transports and their potential applications.

Title: Mapping Sandpiles to Complex Networks
Authors: Abbas Shoja-Daliklidash, Morteza Nattagh-Najafi, Nasser Sepehri-Javan
Abstract: In this paper, we address a longstanding challenge in self-organized criticality (SOC) systems: establishing a connection between sandpiles and complex networks. Our approach employs a similarity-based transfer function characterized by two parameters, $\mathcal{R}=(r_1, r_2)$. Here, $r_1$ quantifies the similarity of local activities, while $r_2$ governs the filtration process used to convert a weighted network into a binary one. We reveal that the degree centrality distribution of the resulting network follows a generalized Gamma distribution (GGD), which transitions to a power-law distribution under specific conditions. The GGD exponents, estimated numerically, exhibit a dependency on $\mathcal{R}$. Notably, while both decreasing $r_1$ and $r_2$ lead to denser networks, $r_2$ plays a more significant role in influencing network density. Furthermore, the Shannon entropy is observed to decrease linearly with increasing $r_2$, whereas its variation with $r_1$ is more gradual. An analytical expression for the Shannon entropy is proposed. To characterize the network structure, we investigate the clustering coefficient ($cc$), eigenvalue centrality ($e$), closeness centrality ($c$), and betweenness centrality ($b$). The distributions of $cc$, $e$, and $c$ exhibit peaked profiles, while $b$ displays a power-law distribution over a finite interval of $k$. Additionally, we explore correlations between the exponents and identify a specific parameter regime of $\mathcal{R}$ and $k$ where the $e-k$, $c-k$, and $b-k$ correlations become negative.

Title: Probing Glass Formation in Perylene Derivatives via Atomic Scale Simulations and Bayesian Regression
Authors: Eric Lindgren, Jan Swensson, Christian Müller, Paul Erhart
Abstract: While the structural dynamics of chromophores are of interest for a range of applications, it is experimentally very challenging to resolve the underlying microscopic mechanisms. Glassy dynamics are also challenging for atomistic simulations due to the underlying dramatic slowdown over many orders of magnitude. Here, we address this issue by combining atomic scale simulations with autocorrelation function analysis and Bayesian regression, and apply this approach to a set of perylene derivatives as prototypical chromophores. The predicted glass transition temperatures and kinetic fragilities are in semi-quantitative agreement with experimental data. By analyzing the underlying dynamics via the normal vector autocorrelation function, we are able to connect the beta and alpha-relaxation processes in these materials to caged (or librational) dynamics and cooperative rotations of the molecules, respectively. The workflow presented in this work serves as a stepping stone toward understanding glassy dynamics in many-component mixtures of perylene derivatives and is readily extendable to other systems of chromophores.

Title: Thermoelectric properties of magic angle twisted bilayer graphene-superconductor hetero-junction: effect of valley polarization and trigonal warping
Authors: Kamalesh Bera, Pritam Chatterjee, Priyanka Mohan, Arijit Saha
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the thermoelectric properties (electronic contribution) of a normal-superconductor (NS) hybrid junction, where the normal region consists of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG). The superconducting region is characterized by a common $s$-wave superconductor closely proximitized to the MATBG. We compute various thermoelectric coefficients, including thermal conductance, thermopower, and the figure of merit ($zT$), using the scattering matrix formalism. These results are further supported by calculations based on a lattice-regularized version of the effective Hamiltonian. Additionally, we explore the impact of trigonal warping and valley polarization on the thermoelectric coefficients. Notably, we find a significant variation in $zT$ as a function of these parameters, reaching values as high as 2.5. Interestingly, we observe a violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law near the charge neutrality point with the superconducting correlation, indicating that MATBG electrons behave as slow Dirac fermions in this regime. This observation is further confirmed by the damped oscillatory behavior of the thermal conductance as a function of the barrier strength when an insulating barrier is modelled at the interface of the NS junction. Beyond theoretical insights, our findings suggest new possibilities for thermoelectric applications using MATBG based NS junctions.

Title: Eigenstate solutions of the Fermi-Hubbard model via symmetry-enhanced variational quantum eigensolver
Authors: Shaohui Yao, Wenyu Wang
Abstract: The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), as a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm, is an important tool for effective quantum computing in the current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. However, the traditional hardware-efficient ansatz without taking into account symmetries requires more computational resources to explore the unnecessary regions in the Hilbert space. The conventional Subspace-Search VQE (SSVQE) algorithm, which can calculate excited states, is also unable to effectively handle degenerate states since the loss function only contains the expectation value of the Hamiltonian. In this study, the energy eigenstates of the one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model with two lattice sites and the two-dimensional Hubbard model with four lattice sites are calculated. By incorporating symmetries into the quantum circuits and loss function, we find that both the ground state and excited state calculations are improved greatly compared to the case without symmetries. The enhancement in excited state calculations is particularly significant. This is because quantum circuits that conserve the particle number are used, and appropriate penalty terms are added to the loss function, enabling the optimization process to correctly identify degenerate states. The results are verified through repeated simulations.

Title: A flux-controlled two-site Kitaev chain

Abstract: In semiconducting-superconducting hybrid devices, Andreev bound states (ABSs) can mediate the coupling between quantum dots (QDs), allowing for the realisation of artificial Kitaev chains. In order to engineer Majorana bound states (MBSs) in these systems, one must control the energy of the ABSs. In this work, we show how extended ABSs in a flux tunable Josephson junction can be used to control the coupling between distant quantum dots separated by $\approx$ 1 $\mathrm{\mu}$m. In particular, we demonstrate that the combination of electrostatic control and phase control over the ABSs significantly increases the parameter space in which MBSs are observed. Finally, by employing an additional spectroscopic probe in the hybrid region between the QDs, we gain information about the spatial distribution of the Majorana wave function in a two-site Kitaev chain.

Title: Low volume fraction of high-Tc superconductivity in La3Ni2O7 at 80 K and ambient pressure
Authors: Mengwu Huo, Peiyue Ma, Chaoxin Huang, Xing Huang, Hualei Sun, Meng Wang
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in pressurized La3Ni2O7 with a transition temperature of approximately 80 K above the boiling point of liquid nitrogen has sparked significant attention. It is essential to search for high-temperature superconductivity in bulk samples and at ambient pressure in nickelates. In this study, we report influential factors that affect the appearance of superconductivity in La3Ni2O7 at ambient pressure. From direct-current magnetic measurements, we observe a clear diamagnetic response at 80 K in post-annealed single crystals of La3Ni2O7 in oxygen. The superconducting volume fraction is estimated to be within 0.2%, resulting in a decrease in resistivity. This work presents a practical approach for further investigating high-temperature superconductivity in nickelates at ambient pressure.

Title: Spin fluctuations steer electronic behavior and altermagnetism in the FeSb$_{3}$ skutterudite
Authors: Enrico Di Lucente, Flaviano José dos Santos, Nicola Marzari
Abstract: Skutterudites are promising materials for thermoelectric and spintronics applications. Here we explore spin fluctuations in the FeSb$_{3}$ skutterudite and their effect on its electronic structure using Hubbard-corrected density-functional theory calculations. We identify multiple magnetic and charge-disproportionated configurations, with an antiferromagnetic metallic ground state. Paramagnetic fluctuations modeled through a special quasirandom spin structure open a 61 meV gap, consistent with experiments. This state features non-degenerate spin channels and band-avoided crossings, hinting at a potential altermagnetic transition with topological features. Mapping the electronic structure to a Heisenberg Hamiltonian fails to explain the low Néel temperature ($\lesssim$10 K), highlighting the role of magnetic exchange frustration and the need for more in-depth experimental investigations.

Title: Magnetoelastic coupling in the stretched diamond lattice of TbTaO$_4$
Authors: Xiaotian Zhang, Nicola Kelly, Denis Sheptyakov, Cheng Liu, Shiyu Deng, Siddharth Saxena, Siân Dutton
Abstract: The magnetic structure of diamond-like lattice has been studied extensively in terms of the magnetic frustration. Here we report the distortion of stretched diamond lattice of Tb$^{3+}$ (4$f^8$) in M-TbTaO$_4$ on application of a magnetic field. We have investigated the structural and magnetic properties of M phase terbium tantalate M-TbTaO$_4$ as a function of temperature and magnetic field using magnetometry and powder neutron diffraction. Sharp ${\lambda}$-shape transitions in $d(\chi T)/dT$, $dM/dH$ and specific heat data confirm the previously reported three-dimensional (3D) antiferromagnetic ordering at $T_N \approx 2.25$ K. On application of a magnetic field the Néel temperature is found to decrease and variable field neutron diffraction experiments below $T_N$ at 1.6 K show an increase in both the bond and angle distortion of the stretched diamond lattice with magnetic field, indicating a potential magneto-elastic coupling effect. By combining our magnetometry, heat capacity and neutron diffraction results we generate a magnetic phase diagram for M-TbTaO$_4$ as a function of temperature and field.

Title: Band gap renormalization, carrier mobility and transport in Mg2Si and Ca2Si: Ab-initio scattering and Boltzmann transport equation study
Authors: Vinod Kumar Solet, Sudhir K. Pandey
Abstract: We perform first-principles electron-phonon interaction (EPI) calculations based on many-body perturbation theory to study the temperature-dependent band-gap and charge-carrier transport properties for Mg$_{2}$Si and Ca$_{2}$Si using the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) under different relaxation-time approximations (RTAs). For a PBE band gap of 0.21 (0.56) eV in Mg$_{2}$Si (Ca$_{2}$Si), a zero-point renormalization correction of 29-33 (37-51) meV is obtained using various approaches, while the gap at 300 K is 0.15-0.154 (0.46-0.5) eV. The electron mobility ($\mu_{e}$), with a detailed convergence study at 300 K, is evaluated using linearized (self-energy and momentum RTA, or SERTA and MRTA) and iterative BTE (IBTE) solutions. At 300 K, the $\mu_{e}$ values are 351 (100), 573 (197), and 524 (163) cm$^{2}V^{-1}s^{-1}$ from SERTA, MRTA, and IBTE, respectively, for Mg$_{2}$Si (Ca$_{2}$Si). SERTA (MRTA) provides results in better agreement with IBTE at higher (lower) temperatures, while SERTA-derived $\mu_{e}$ closely matches experimental $\mu_{e}$ values for Mg$_{2}$Si. Thermoelectric (TE) transport coefficients significantly influenced by the choice of RTA, with SERTA and MRTA yielding improved agreement with experimental results compared to constant RTA (CRTA) for Mg$_{2}$Si over an electron concentration range of $10^{17}$ to $10^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$. The lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{ph}$) at 300 K due to phonon-phonon interactions is estimated to be 22.7 (7.2) W m$^{-1}K^{-1}$ for Mg$_{2}$Si (Ca$_{2}$Si). The highest calculated figure of merit (zT) under CRTA is 0.35 (0.38), which decreases to 0.08 (0.085) when EPI is included using MRTA. This study clearly identifies the critical role of EPI in accurate transport predictions of TE silicides. Finally, we explore strategies to enhance zT by reducing $\kappa_{ph}$ through nanostructuring and mass-difference scattering.

Title: Non-reciprocal interactions drive emergent chiral crystallites
Authors: S. J. Kole, Xichen Chao, Abraham Mauleon-Amieva, Ryo Hanai, C. Patrick Royall, Tanniemola B. Liverpool
Abstract: We study a new type of 2D active material that exhibits macroscopic phases with two emergent broken symmetries: self-propelled achiral particles that form dense hexatic clusters, which spontaneously rotate. We experimentally realise active colloids that self-organise into both polar and hexatic crystallites, exhibiting exotic emergent phenomena. This is accompanied by a field theory of coupled order parameters formulated on symmetry principles, including non-reciprocity, to capture the non-equilibrium dynamics. We find that the presence of two interacting broken symmetry fields leads to the emergence of novel chiral phases built from (2D) achiral active colloids (here Quincke rollers). These phases are characterised by the presence of both clockwise and counterclockwise rotating clusters. We thus show that spontaneous rotation can emerge in non-equilibrium systems, even when the building blocks are achiral, due to non-reciprocally coupled broken symmetries. This interplay leads to self-organized stirring through counter-rotating vortices in confined colloidal systems, with cluster size controlled by external electric fields.

Title: Single-shot capable surface acoustic wave dispersion measurement of a layered plate
Authors: Georg Watzl, Stefan Eder, Martin Ryzy, Mike Hettich, Edgar Scherleitner, Martin Schagerl, Clemens Grünsteidl
Abstract: Established techniques for characterizing a layer on a substrate system via surface acoustic wave (SAW) dispersion measurement are often slow due to the need for scanning excitation or detection positions. We present a method for determining discrete points on the SAW mode at equidistant wavenumbers that requires only a single measurement, overcoming these speed limitations. A pulsed laser, shaped into an array of equidistant lines, generates elastic waves on the sample surface. A vibrometer detects the resulting surface displacement next to the line array. The periodic excitation arrangement results in constructive interference of the SAW at wavelengths corresponding to integer fractions of the line spacing. This leads to distinct peaks in the response spectrum, whose higher orders we term spatial harmonics of the SAW. The known line spacing determines the wavelengths, allowing the peak frequencies to be mapped to discrete points on the SAW dispersion curve, effectively sampling the SAW at specific equidistant wavenumbers. By solving an inverse problem, a model can be fit to the experimental data to obtain properties of the layered system. We demonstrate this technique on copper-clad epoxy laminate and roll-cladded aluminum alloy plates and compare our results with dispersion relation scans and micrography. Additionally, we analyze the method's sensitivity to elastic parameters and layer thickness. This approach offers a viable alternative to established SAW scanning methods, particularly in scenarios where the trade-off of lower wavenumber sampling density is acceptable to achieve exceptionally fast measurements while avoiding moving parts.

Title: Binary random packing fraction of hyperspheres with small or large size difference: a geometric approach
Authors: H.J.H. Brouwers
Abstract: The random packing fraction of binary particles in D-dimensional Euclidean space R^D is studied using a geometric approach. First, the binary packing fraction of assemblies with small size difference are studied, using the excluded volume model by Onsager for particles in three-dimensional space (D = 3). According to this model the packing increase by bidispersity is proportional to (1 - f)(u^D - 1)^2, with f as monosized packing fraction, u as size ratio and D as space dimension. The model predictions are compared with computational results for disks in two dimensions (D = 2) and hyperspheres in the large-dimension limit (D to infinity), yielding good agreement. Subsequently, the packing of hyperspheres with large size difference is modeled, employing the classic theory of Furnas. This theory, developed for three dimensions, starts from an infinite size ratio of larger and smaller particles (u to infinity). Here, the pertaining equations are applied to hyperspheres, and successfully compared with computational results for hyperspheres in the large-dimension limit. Furthermore, an asymptotic approximation of the binary packing fraction for large size ratio is derived, which shows that the first order variation of the Furnas packing fraction (u^-1 = 0) is proportional to (2 - f)u^-1. Finally, a scaled D-dimensional binary packing graph is presented, governing a simplified phase diagram that borders the binary random packing fraction of amorphous assemblies. To summarize, basic space-filling and geometric (a-thermal) theories on simple hard spheres appear to be a valuable tool for the study of hyperspheres packing and amorphization.

Title: Superstructure reflexions in tilted perovskites Part 1
Authors: Richard Beanland, Robin Sjokvist
Abstract: The superstructure spots that appear in diffraction patterns of tilted perovskites are well documented and easily calculated using crystallographic software. Here, by considering a distortion mode as a perturbation of the prototype perovskite structure, we show how the structure factor equation yields Boolean conditions for the presence of first order superstructure reflexions. A subsequent article describes conditions for second order reflexions, which appear only in structures with mixed in-phase and anti-phase oxygen octahedral tilting. This approach may have some advantages for the analysis of electron diffraction patterns of perovskites.

Title: Superstructure reflexions in tilted perovskites part 2
Authors: Richard Beanland, Robin Sjokvist
Abstract: In a previous article (Beanland & Sjokvist, 2024), we derived Boolean conditions for the appearance of superstructure reflexions in diffraction patterns from perovskites with tilted oxygen octahedra, using the structure factor equation. Assuming that the deviation from the untilted prototype perovskite structure was infinitesimally small, we expanded the structure factor as a Taylor series, truncated at the first term. This gave an elegant and simple method giving conditions on the presence or absence of superstructure reflexions. However, in real perovskite materials these distortions are sufficiently large for higher order terms to become significant, giving an additional set of superstructure reflexions. Here, we consider the second term in the expansion and show that it gives rise to second order reflexions with indices of the form half-even-even-odd. Boolean conditions for their presence are given.

Title: Beyond traditional box-covering: Determining the fractal dimension of complex networks using a fixed number of boxes of flexible diameter
Authors: Michal Lepek, Kordian Makulski, Agata Fronczak, Piotr Fronczak
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel box-covering algorithm for analyzing the fractal properties of complex networks. Unlike traditional algorithms that impose a predefined box size, our approach assigns nodes to boxes identified by the nearest local hubs without rigid distance constraints. This flexibility directly relates to the recently proposed scaling theory of fractal complex networks and is clearly consistent with the idea of hidden metric spaces in which network nodes are embedded. It also allows us to determine the box dimension of various real and model-based complex networks more accurately, including those previously unrecognized as fractal, such as the Internet at the level of autonomous systems. We show that our algorithm not only significantly reduces computational complexity compared to the classical greedy coloring method but also enables more precise determination of various scaling exponents describing the structure of fractal networks.

Title: Circular dichroism in resonant inelastic x-ray scattering from birefringence in CuO
Authors: Abhishek Nag, Gérard Sylvester Perren, Hiroki Ueda, A. T. Boothroyd, D. Prabhakaran, M. García-Fernández, S. Agrestini, Ke-Jin Zhou, Urs Staub
Abstract: Resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) has become a prominent technique to study quasiparticle excitations. With advances in polarization analysis capabilities at different facilities, RIXS offers exceptional potential for investigating symmetry-broken quasiparticles like chiral phonons and magnons. At optical wavelengths birefringence can severely affect polarization states in low-symmetry systems. Here we show its importance for soft x-ray resonances. Given the growing interest in Circular Dichroism (CD) in RIXS, it is important to evaluate how birefringence may affect the RIXS spectra of anisotropic systems. We investigate CuO, a well-known anisotropic material, using Cu $L_3$-edge RIXS and detect significant CD in both magnetic and orbital excitations in the collinear antiferromagnetic phase. We demonstrate that the CD can be modeled by a proper treatment of RIXS scattering amplitudes derived from single-ion calculations with birefringence. Recognizing these effects is crucial for unambiguous identification of subtle dichroic effects induced by symmetry-broken quasiparticles. Furthermore, the combined sensitivity of RIXS and birefringence to local symmetry presents an opportunity to study microscopic changes driven by external perturbations.

Title: Strain-time engineering via exciton interactions
Authors: Maurício F. C. Martins Quintela, Miguel Sá, Alejandro J. Uría-Álvarez, Mikhail Malakhov, Giovanni Cistaro, Jorge Quereda, Juan J. Palacios, Antonio Picón
Abstract: The technology to produce attosecond pulses opens the door to manipulate electrons in matter before their loss of quantum coherence. In two-dimensional materials, where excitonic interactions dominate the optical response, a laser-induced quantum superposition of excitons may induce a migration of charge across the system. Here, instead of tailoring the laser pulse in order to control the exciton superposition, we propose strain as a more feasible and robust scheme to control exciton migration. Uniaxial strain may break the crystal symmetry and lift the degeneracy of 1s exciton states. We show in monolayer hBN a precise control of the exciton oscillation between different valleys via strain. We perform numerical simulations of the laser-driven electron dynamics that demonstrate this effect. This work paves the way of using strain for tailoring exciton oscillations at the attosecond time scale.

Title: Self-propelled particles undergoing cyclic transitions
Authors: Ye Zhang, Duanduan Wan
Abstract: Cyclic transitions between active and passive states are central to many natural and synthetic systems, ranging from light-driven active particles to animal migrations. Here, we investigate a minimal model of self-propelled Brownian particles undergoing cyclic transitions across three spatial zones: gain, loss, and neutral regions. Particles become active in the gain region, passive in the loss region, and retain their state in the neutral region. By analyzing the steady-state behavior as a function of particle number and the size of the loss region, we identify a threshold particle number, below and above which distinct structural changes are observed. Interestingly, below this threshold, increasing the particle number reduces the state-switching time (the time required for a particle to transition from active to passive and back to active). In contrast, above the threshold, further increases in particle number result in longer switching times. In the subthreshold regime, our analytical model predicts structural characteristics and switching dynamics that align well with simulations. Above the threshold, we observe an emergent spatial clustering, with particles transitioning from passive to active states in close proximity. These findings provide insights into the collective dynamics of cyclic processes between active and passive states across distinct spatial zones in active matter systems.

Title: A generative material transformer using Wyckoff representation
Authors: Pierre-Paul De Breuck, Hashim A. Piracha, Miguel A. L. Marques
Abstract: Materials play a critical role in various technological applications. Identifying and enumerating stable compounds, those near the convex hull, is therefore essential. Despite recent progress, generative models either have a relatively low rate of stable compounds, are computationally expensive, or lack symmetry. In this work we present Matra-Genoa, an autoregressive transformer model built on invertible tokenized representations of symmetrized crystals, including free coordinates. This approach enables sampling from a hybrid action space. The model is trained across the periodic table and space groups and can be conditioned on specific properties. We demonstrate its ability to generate stable, novel, and unique crystal structures by conditioning on the distance to the convex hull. Resulting structures are 8 times more likely to be stable than baselines using PyXtal with charge compensation, while maintaining high computational efficiency. We also release a dataset of 3 million unique crystals generated by our method, including 4,000 compounds verified by density-functional theory to be within 0.001 eV/atom of the convex hull.

Title: Braiding Majoranas in a linear quantum dot-superconductor array: Mitigating the errors from Coulomb repulsion and residual tunneling
Authors: Sebastian Miles, Francesco Zatelli, A. Mert Bozkurt, Michael Wimmer, Chun-Xiao Liu
Abstract: Exchanging the positions of two non-Abelian anyons transforms between many-body wavefunctions within a degenerate ground-state manifold. This behavior is fundamentally distinct from fermions, bosons and Abelian anyons. Recently, quantum dot-superconductor arrays have emerged as a promising platform for creating topological Kitaev chains that can host non-Abelian Majorana zero modes. In this work, we propose a minimal braiding setup in a linear array of quantum dots consisting of two minimal Kitaev chains coupled through an ancillary, normal quantum dot. We focus on the physical effects that are peculiar to quantum dot devices, such as interdot Coulomb repulsion and residual single electron tunneling. We find that the errors caused by either of these effects can be efficiently mitigated by optimal control of the ancillary quantum dot that mediates the exchange of the non-Abelian anyons. Moreover, we propose experimentally accessible methods to find this optimal operating regime and predict signatures of a successful Majorana braiding experiment.

Title: Irreversible thermodynamics and Glansdorff-Prigogine principle derived from stochastic thermodynamics
Authors: Tânia Tomé, Mário J. de Oliveira
Abstract: We derive the main equations of irreversible thermodynamic including the expression for the Glansdorff-Prigogine extremal principle from stochastic thermodynamics. To this end, we analyze a system that is subject to gradients of temperature and external forces that induce the appearance of fluxes of several sorts and the creation of entropy. We show that the rate of entropy production is a convex function of the fluxes, from which follows that the excess entropy production is nonnegative, which is an expression of the Glansdorff-Prigogine principle. We show that the Lyapunov function associated with the excess entropy production can be identified with a thermodynamic potential in the special case where the gradients of temperature are absent.

Title: Overlay-aware Variation Study of Flip FET and Benchmark with CFET
Authors: Wanyue Peng, Haoran Lu, Jingru Jiang, Jiacheng Sun, Ming Li, Runsheng Wang, Heng Wu, Ru Huang
Abstract: In this work, we carried out an overlay-aware variation study on Flip FET (FFET) considering the impact on RC parasitics induced by the lithography misalignment in backside processes, and benchmarked it with CFET in terms of the power-performance (PP) and variation sources. The iso-leakage frequency degrades up to 2.20% with layout misalignment of 4 nm. It's found that the Drain Merge resistance degrades significantly with misalignment increasing and is identified as the major variation source. Through careful DTCO with design rule optimization, the variation can be greatly suppressed, while the resistance fluctuation of the DM also drops substantially. Monte Carlo random experiments were also conducted, validating the variation reduction. Comparing with the CFET featuring self-aligned gate and much less overlay induced misalignment, fortunately, FFET's PP is still better except when misalignment reaches 8 nm, which is out of spec and nearly impossible. Considering the variabilities induced by the high aspect ratio processes, CFET still faces big challenges compared with FFET.

Title: Environment-limited transfer of angular momentum in Bose liquids
Authors: Alberto Cappellaro, Giacomo Bighin, Igor Cherepanov, Mikhail Lemeshko
Abstract: Impurity motion in a many-body environment has been a central issue in the field of low-temperature physics for decades. In bosonic quantum fluids, the onset of a drag force experienced by point-like objects is due to collective environment excitations, driven by the exchange of linear momentum between the impurity and the many-body bath. In this work we consider a rotating impurity, with the aim of exploring how angular momentum is exchanged with the surrounding bosonic environment. In order to elucidate this issues, we employ a quasiparticle approach based on the angulon theory, which allows us to effectively deal with the non-trivial algebra of quantized angular momentum in presence of a many-body environment. We uncover how impurity dressing by environmental excitations can establish an exchange channel, whose effectiveness crucially depends on the initial state of the impurity. Remarkably, we find that there is a critical value of initial angular momentum, above which this channel effectively freezes.

Title: The hidden architecture of equilibrium self-assembly
Authors: Maximilian C. Hübl, Thomas E. Videbæk, Daichi Hayakawa, W. Benjamin Rogers, Carl P. Goodrich
Abstract: Experiments have reached a monumental capacity for designing and synthesizing microscopic particles for self-assembly, making it possible to precisely control particle concentrations, shapes, and interactions. However, we lack a comprehensive inverse-design framework for tuning these particle-level attributes to obtain desired system-level assembly outcomes, like the yield of a user-specified target structure. This severely limits our ability to take full advantage of this vast design space to assemble nanomaterials with complex structure and function. Here we show that a hidden mathematical architecture controls equilibrium assembly outcomes and provides a single comprehensive view of the entire design space. This architecture predicts which structures can be assembled at high yield and reveals constraints that govern the coexistence of structures, which we verify through detailed, quantitative assembly experiments of nanoscale particles synthesized using DNA origami. Strong experimental agreement confirms the importance of this underlying architecture and motivates its use as a predictive tool for the rational design of self-assembly. These results uncover a universal core logic underpinning all equilibrium self-assembly that forms the basis for a robust inverse-design framework, applicable to a wide array of systems from biological protein complexes to synthetic nanomachines.

Title: Superlubric sliding ferroelectricity
Authors: Zihao Yang, Menghao Wu
Abstract: Sliding ferroelectricity may emerge in many van der Waals bilayers/multilayers and the low switching barriers render ultrafast data writing with low energy cost. We note that such barriers are still much higher compared with structural superlubricity, and in this paper we propose a type of superlubric sliding ferroelectricity in homobilayers separated by a different layer that leads to unprecedented low switching barriers due to incommensurate interfaces. For example, the switching barrier of 3R bilayer MoS2 will be respectively reduced by around 2 or 1 order of magnitudes if they are separated by a graphene or BN monolayer, and the required voltage for switching can be about 1 order of magnitude lower. Such superlubric sliding ferroelectricity widely exists in various similar sandwich trilayer systems where the polarizations stem from symmetry breaking in across-layer stacking configurations, and with ultralow barriers of superlubric sliding, their performances for various applications are greatly enhanced compared with homobilayer sliding ferroelectrics.

Title: Effect of Anisotropic Peierls Barrier on the Evolution of Discrete Dislocation Networks in Ni
Authors: John D. Shimanek, Darshan Bamney, Laurent Capolungo, Zi-Kui Liu, Allison M. Beese
Abstract: Over low and intermediate strain rates, plasticity in face centered cubic (FCC) metals is governed by the glide of dislocations, which manifest as complex networks that evolve with strain. Considering the elastic anisotropy of FCC metals, the characteristics of dislocation motion are also anisotropic (i.e., dislocation character angle-dependent), which is expected to notably influence the overall evolution of the dislocation network, and consequently, the plastic response of these materials. The aggregate influence of the anisotropy in the Peierls stress on the mechanical response of single crystal Ni was investigated in the present work using discrete dislocation dynamics simulations. Twenty initial dislocation networks, differing in their configuration and dislocation density, were deformed under uniaxial tension up to at least 0.9% strain, and the analysis of character-dependent dynamics showed a suppression of plasticity only for segments of nearly screw character. While the increased screw component of the Peierls stress raised the initial strain hardening rate, it also resulted in longer dislocation segments overall, contrary to the reasoning that longer pinned segments exhibit a lower resistance to motion and might give a weaker response. A non-linear superposition principle is demonstrated to predict the hardening reasonably well, considering the cumulative effects of forest and Peierls stress-related strengthening. Further analysis of the network topology revealed a tendency to maintain connectivity over the course of deformation for those networks simulated using an unequal Peierls stress. The general increases in hardening rate and network connectivity contrast with the localized reduction of dislocation motion, which occurred mainly for segments of nearly screw-type character.

Title: Exactly Solvable Models of Interacting Chiral Bosons and Fermions on a Lattice
Authors: Manuel Valiente
Abstract: We consider one-dimensional theories of chiral fermions and bosons on a lattice, which arise as edge states of two-dimensional topological matter breaking time-reversal invariance. We show that hard core bosons or their spin chain equivalent exhibit properties that are similar to free fermions, solving the many-body problem exactly. For fermions, we study the effect of a static impurity exactly and show the orthogonality catastrophe in the continuum limit via bosonization. The interacting many-fermion problem in the continuum limit is solved exactly using simple momentum conservation arguments.

Title: Quantum Transport with Spin Orbit Coupling: New Developments in TranSIESTA
Authors: Nils Wittemeier, Nick Papior, Mads Brandbyge, Zeila Zanolli, Pablo Ordejón
Abstract: We present the implementation of spinor quantum transport within the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) code TranSIESTA based on Density Functional Theory (DFT). First-principles methods play an essential role in molecular and material modelling, and the DFT+NEGF approach has become a widely-used tool for quantum transport simulation. Exisiting (open source) DFT-based quantum transport codes either model non-equilibrium/finite-bias cases in an approximate way or rely on the collinear spin approximation. Our new implementation closes this gap and enables the TranSIESTA code to use full spinor-wave functions. Thereby it provides a method for transport simulation of topological materials and devices based on spin-orbit coupling (SOC) or non-collinear spins. These materials hold enormous potential for the development of ultra-low energy electronics urgently needed for the design of sustainable technology. The new feature is tested for relevant systems determining magnetoresistance in iron nanostructures and transport properties of a lateral transition metal dichalcogenide heterojunction.

Title: Melting through Barrier-Crossing: The Role of Equilibrium Thermally Activated Particles
Authors: Rongchao Ma
Abstract: Melting is often understood in purely equilibrium terms, where crystalline order disappears once the free energy of the solid equals that of the liquid. Yet at the microscopic level, the initiating events for melting can often be traced to the formation of defects or local ``jumps'' over interatomic barriers. In this work, we offer a unified interpretation of melting by focusing on the equilibrium fraction of particles whose energy exceeds a characteristic barrier \(E_a\). We show that when this fraction surpasses a small but critical threshold \cite{Feder1958,Kraftmakher1998} (on the order of \(10^{-4}\)-\(10^{-3}\)), the crystal loses its rigidity, thus reconciling Born's mechanical-instability picture with the older Lindemann notion of large atomic displacements. We derive this threshold condition from standard Boltzmann (and Bose/Fermi) statistics, ensuring consistency with standard thermodynamics. Our approach naturally extends to vortex lattices in superconductors (where vortex activation energies play the role of \(E_a\)) and to quantum-lattice systems (Hubbard-type models). Crucially, while the interpretation emphasizes barrier crossing, the criterion itself is built on equilibrium statistical mechanics, offering a transparent link between defect formation rates and the macroscopic transition.

Title: Revisiting the phonon theory of liquid heat capacity: low-frequency shear modes and intramolecular vibrations
Authors: Yu Liu, Matteo Baggioli
Abstract: Modeling the heat capacity of liquids present fundamental difficulties due to the strong intermolecular particle interactions and large diffusive-like displacements. Based on the experimental evidence that the microscopic dynamics of liquids closely resemble those of solids, a phonon theory of liquid thermodynamics has been developed. Despite its success, the phonon theory of liquids relies on the questionable assumption that low-frequency shear excitations are propagating in nature and follow a Debye density of states. Furthermore, the same framework does not capture the contribution of intramolecular vibrations, which play a significant role in molecular liquids. In this work, we revisit the phonon theory of liquid heat capacity, introducing alternative approaches to model low-frequency shear modes. In particular, we consider the recently proposed idea of treating such modes as pure kinetic and we propose a novel approach based on identifying those low-frequency excitations as overdamped liquid-like modes with linear in frequency density of states. Moreover, we complete the theory by incorporating the effects of intramolecular vibrations. By comparing the theoretical predictions from these different approaches with the available data for the heat capacity of several liquids, we present a comprehensive evaluation of the original model and the newly proposed extensions. Despite all approaches perform well at low-temperatures, our results indicate that modeling low-frequency modes as overdamped liquid-like excitations yields the most accurate agreement with the data in the whole temperature range. Conversely, we demonstrate that treating these excitations as purely gas-like leads to significant inaccuracies, particularly at high temperatures.

Title: Critical Current Density and AC Magnetic Susceptibility of High-quality FeTe$_{0.5}$Se$_{0.5}$ Superconducting Tapes
Authors: Xin Zhou, Wenjie Li, Qiang Hou, Wei Wei, Wenhui Liu, Ke Wang, Xiangzhuo Xing, Linfei Liu, Jun-Yi Ge, Yanpeng Qi, Huajun Liu, Li Ren, Tsuyoshi Tamegai, Yue Sun, Zhixiang Shi
Abstract: Iron telluride-selenium superconducting materials, known for their non-toxicity, ease of preparation, simple structure, and high upper critical fields, have attracted much research interest in practical application. In this work, we conducted electrical transport measurements, magneto-optical imaging, and AC magnetic susceptibility measurements on FeTe$_{0.5}$Se$_{0.5}$ superconducting long tapes fabricated via reel-to-reel pulsed laser deposition. Our transport measurements revealed a high critical current density that remains relatively stable even with increasing external magnetic fields, reaching over $1\times 10^5$ A/cm$^2$ at 8 K and 9 T. The calculated pinning force density indicates that normal point pinning is the primary mechanism in these tapes. The magneto-optical images demonstrated that the tapes show homogeneous superconductivity and uniform distribution of critical current density. The AC magnetic susceptibility measurements also confirmed their strong flux pinning nature of withstanding high magnetic field. Based on these characteristics, FeTe$_{0.5}$Se$_{0.5}$ superconducting tapes show promising prospects for applications under high magnetic fields.

Title: Probing non-Gaussian correlations through entanglement generation in a many-body quantum system
Authors: J. van de Kraats, D.J.M. Ahmed-Braun, V.E. Colussi, S.J.J.M.F. Kokkelmans
Abstract: In understanding strongly correlated quantum systems, quantifying the non-Gaussian nature of interparticle correlations is invaluable. We show that, for a uniform quantum gas, there exists a natural connection between non-Gaussian correlations and the generation of momentum-space entanglement. Furthermore, this entanglement can be directly measured in an experiment using time-of-flight techniques. To prototype our method, we numerically study entanglement generation in a degenerate Bose gas following a quench to the unitary regime, where Gaussian and non-Gaussian correlations are generated sequentially in time.

Title: Non-Gaussian density fluctuations in the Dean-Kawasaki equation
Authors: Pierre Illien
Abstract: Computing analytically the $n$-point density correlations in systems of interacting particles is a long-standing problem of statistical physics, with a broad range of applications, from the interpretation of scattering experiments in simple liquids, to the quantitative description of the slow and cooperative dynamics in glass formers. For Brownian particles, i.e. with overdamped Langevin dynamics, the microscopic density obeys a stochastic evolution equation, known as the Dean-Kawasaki equation. In spite of the importance of this equation, its complexity makes it very difficult to analyze the statistics of the microscopic density beyond simple Gaussian approximations. In this work, resorting to a path-integral description of the stochastic dynamics and relying on the formalism of macroscopic fluctuation theory, we go beyond the usual linearization of the Dean-Kawasaki equation, and we compute perturbatively the three-point density correlation functions, in the limit of high-density and weak interactions between the particles. This exact result opens the way to using the Dean-Kawasaki beyond the simple Gaussian treatments, and could find applications to understand many fluctuation-related effects in soft and active matter systems.

Title: Quantum oscillations of holes in GaN

Abstract: GaN has emerged to be a major semiconductor akin to silicon due to its revolutionary impacts in solid state lighting, critically enabled by p-type doping, and high-performance radio-frequency and power electronics. Suffering from inefficient hole doping and low hole mobility, quantum oscillations in p-type GaN have not been observed, hindering fundamental studies of valence bands and hole transport in GaN. Here, we present the first observation of quantum oscillations of holes in GaN. Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations in hole resistivity are observed in a quantum-confined two-dimensional hole gas at a GaN/AlN interface, where polarization-induced doping overcomes thermal freeze-out, and a sharp and clean interface boosts the hole mobility enough to unmask the quantum oscillations. These holes degenerately occupy the light and heavy hole bands of GaN and have record-high mobilities of ~1900 cm2/Vs and ~400 cm2/Vs at 3K, respectively. We use magnetic fields up to 72 T to resolve SdH oscillations of holes from both valence bands to extract their respective sheet densities, quantum scattering times, and the effective masses of light holes (0.5-0.7 m0) and heavy holes (1.9 m0). SdH oscillations of heavy and light holes in GaN constitute a direct metrology of valence bands and open new venues for quantum engineering in this technologically important semiconductor. Like strained silicon transistors, strain-engineering of the valence bands of GaN is predicted to dramatically improve hole mobilities by reducing the hole effective mass, a proposal that can now be explored experimentally, particularly in a fully fabricated transistor, using quantum oscillations. Furthermore, the findings of this work suggest a blueprint to create 2D hole gases and observe quantum oscillations of holes in related wide bandgap semiconductors such as SiC and ZnO in which such techniques are not yet possible.

Title: Transition Metal-Driven Variations in Structure, Magnetism, and Photocatalysis of Monoclinic M3Se4 (M = Fe, Co, Ni) Nanoparticles
Authors: Monika Ghalawat, Inderjeet Chauhan, Dinesh Singh, Chinnakonda S. Gopinath, Pankaj Poddar (CSIR-National Chemical Laboratory, Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research)
Abstract: The transition metal selenides (MxSey) have gained attention for their unique physical and chemical properties, especially those associated with the transition metal (M). Despite advancements in synthesis, fabricating these selenides is challenging due to their complex stoichiometry and high asymmetry. One such system is monoclinic iron selenide (Fe3Se4), which can be used in permanent-magnet technologies and serve as a model system for understanding magnetism. This study focuses on fabricating monoclinic M3Se4 (M = Fe, Co, or Ni) compounds via thermal decomposition, examining how solution chemistry influences their morphology and properties. With a Curie temperature of about 322 K, Fe3Se4 is ferrimagnetic, whereas Co3Se4 and Ni3Se4 are paramagnetic between 5 and 300 K. The latter two compounds also show higher catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution in water splitting, with maximum H2-evolution rates of 1.01, 5.16, and 6.83 mmol h-1g-1 for Fe3Se4, Co3Se4, and Ni3Se4, respectively.

Title: Synthesis, crystal structure, site occupancy and magnetic properties of aluminum substituted M-type Sr hexaferrite SrFe12-xAlxO19 nanoparticles
Authors: Matilde Saura-Múzquiz, Anna Zink Eikeland, Marian Stingaciu, Henrik Lyder Andersen, Maxim Avdeev, Mogens Christensen
Abstract: The synthesis of aluminum substituted strontium hexaferrite nanoparticles (SrFe12-xAlxO19 with x = 0-3), via three different preparation methods, is investigated. The synthesis methods are hydrothermal autoclave (AC) synthesis, a citrate sol-gel (SG) synthesis and a solid-salt matrix (SSM) sol-gel synthesis. Evaluation of macroscopic magnetic properties and of lattice parameters obtained by Rietveld analysis of powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) data indicate that successful substitution of Al into the crystal structure is only achieved for the SG method. For the SG sample with x = 3, the coercivity was found to increase by 73% to 830 kA/m, while the saturation magnetization was reduced by 68% to 22.6 Am2/kg compared to the non-substituted x = 0 SG sample. The SSM and AC samples did not show any significant changes in their magnetic properties. To examine the nature of the Al insertion in detail, neutron powder diffraction (NPD) data were collected on the SSM and SG samples. Combined Rietveld refinements of the PXRD and NPD data confirm that effective substitution of the Al ions is only achieved for the SG sample and reveal that Al occupies mainly the (2a)Oh and (12k)Oh sites and to a lesser extent the (4e)BP, (4f)Oh and (4f)Td sites. Moreover, the relative degree of site occupation varies with increasing Al substitution. The intrinsic magnetization according to the refined atomic magnetic moments and Al site occupation fractions was extracted from the NPD data and compared with the measured macroscopic magnetization. A remarkable agreement exists between the two, confirming the robustness and accuracy of the Rietveld analysis.

Title: Protecting Intercavity Polaritons in Strongly Coupled Cavities
Authors: Rodrigo Sánchez-Martínez, Yesenia A. García-Jomaso, David Ley-Domínguez, Hugo A. Lara-García, Giuseppe Pirruccio, Arturo Camacho-Guardian
Abstract: We theoretically designed and experimentally demonstrated a mechanism to protect a spatially segregated mixed light-matter state, known as intercavity exciton-polariton in strongly coupled optical cavities. This excitation, shared across the coupled cavity array, exhibits remarkable robustness over a wide momentum range, without compromising photon-exciton mixing or the spatial separation of its photonic and excitonic components, which also enables a tunable heavy mass. Additionally, we unveil a direct connection between the transparency window, characteristic of slow-light experiments, and the protection of the intercavity polariton nature. Both phenomena originate from the strategic design of an energy-level landscape featuring a $\Lambda$-scheme, opening new avenues for exploring and utilizing these unique optical excitations in advanced photonic applications.

Title: Electric transport as a probe to unveil microscopic aspects of oxygen-depleted YBCO
Authors: C. Acha, A. Camjayi, T. Vaimala, H. Huhtinen, P. Paturi
Abstract: We report on the characterization of Pt-YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ interfaces, focusing on how oxygen vacancies content ($\delta$) affects electrical transport mechanisms. Our study examines four Pt-YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ samples with varying $\delta$ (0.12 $\leq \delta \leq$ 0.56) using voltage-current measurements across a temperature range. We successfully model the electrical behavior using a Poole-Frenkel conduction framework, revealing that oxygen vacancies create potential wells that trap carriers, directly influencing conduction. We observe that the energy of these traps increases as $\delta$ rises, in agreement with a peak previously detected in optical conductivity measurements. This result supports earlier interpretations, strengthening the proposed connection between oxygen vacancies and the ionization energy associated with impurity bands in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$.

Title: Strongly correlated states of transition metal spin defects: the case of an iron impurity in aluminum nitride
Authors: Leon Otis, Yu Jin, Victor Wen-zhe Yu, Siyuan Chen, Laura Gagliardi, Giulia Galli
Abstract: We investigate the electronic properties of an exemplar transition metal impurity in an insulator, with the goal of accurately describing strongly correlated, defect states. We consider iron in aluminum nitride, a material of interest for hybrid quantum technologies, and we carry out calculations with quantum embedding methods -- density matrix embedding theory (DMET) and quantum defect embedding theory (QDET) and with spin-flip time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). We show that both DMET and QDET accurately describe the ground state and low-lying excited states of the defect, and that TDDFT yields photoluminescence spectra in agreement with experiments. In addition, we provide a detailed discussion of the convergence of our results as a function of the active space used in the embedding methods, thus defining a protocol to obtain converged data, directly comparable with experiments.

Title: The droplet size distribution and its dynamics in chemically active emulsions
Authors: Jonathan Bauermann, Giacomo Bartolucci, Christoph A. Weber, Frank Jülicher
Abstract: We present a dynamic theory for the droplet size distribution in chemically active emulsions, considering a simple ternary mixture with a conserved density. We show that the collective behavior of many droplets, such as monodispersity, emerges through a coupling of the conserved density in the far field. Using our theory, we determine the stationary state of such emulsions and characterize the relaxation of the droplet size distributions at late times. A key finding is a universal scaling behavior, leading to the collapse of the rescaled size distributions at late times. Our results suggest that the key features of our dynamic theory are generic and apply to the broader class of multi-component systems with conservation laws and active chemical reactions.

Title: Twisted gauging and topological sectors in (2+1)d abelian lattice gauge theories
Authors: Bram Vancraeynest-De Cuiper, Clement Delcamp
Abstract: Given a two-dimensional quantum lattice model with an abelian gauge theory interpretation, we investigate a duality operation that amounts to gauging its invertible 1-form symmetry, followed by gauging the resulting 0-form symmetry in a twisted way via a choice of discrete torsion. Using tensor networks, we introduce explicit lattice realisations of the so-called condensation defects, which are obtained by gauging the 1-form symmetry along submanifolds of spacetime, and employ the same calculus to realise the duality operators. By leveraging these tensor network operators, we compute the non-trivial interplay between symmetry-twisted boundary conditions and charge sectors under the duality operation, enabling us to construct isometries relating the dual Hamiltonians. Whenever a lattice gauge theory is left invariant under the duality operation, we explore the possibility of promoting the self-duality to an internal symmetry. We argue that this results in a symmetry structure that encodes the 2-representations of a 2-group.

Title: Shift of the Bose-Einstein condensation temperature due to dipolar interactions
Authors: Milan Krstajić, Jiří Kučera, Lucas R. Hofer, Gavin Lamb, Péter Juhász, Robert P. Smith
Abstract: We report the first measurements of the BEC critical temperature shift due to dipolar interactions, employing samples of ultracold erbium atoms which feature significant (magnetic) dipole-dipole interactions in addition to tuneable contact interactions. Using a highly prolate harmonic trapping potential, we observe a clear dependence of the critical temperature on the orientation of the dipoles relative to the trap axis. Our results are in good agreement with mean-field theory for a range of contact interaction strengths. This work opens the door for further investigations into beyond-mean-field effects and the finite-temperature phase diagram in the more strongly dipolar regime where supersolid and droplet states emerge.

Title: Measuring full counting statistics in a quantum simulator
Authors: Lata Kh Joshi, Filiberto Ares, Manoj K. Joshi, Christian F. Roos, Pasquale Calabrese
Abstract: In quantum mechanics, the probability distribution function (PDF) and full counting statistics (FCS) play a fundamental role in characterizing the fluctuations of quantum observables, as they encode the complete information about these fluctuations. In this letter, we measure these two quantities in a trapped-ion quantum simulator for the transverse and longitudinal magnetization within a subsystem. We utilize the toolbox of classical shadows to postprocess the measurements performed in random bases. The measurement scheme efficiently allows access to the FCS and PDF of all possible operators on desired choices of subsystems of an extended quantum system.

Title: Shape Morphing Metamaterials
Authors: Krzysztof K. Dudek, Muamer Kadic, Corentin Coulais, Katia Bertoldi
Abstract: Mechanical metamaterials leverage geometric design to achieve unconventional properties, such as high strength at low density, efficient wave guiding, and complex shape morphing. The ability to control shape changes builds on the complex relationship between geometry and nonlinear mechanics, and opens new possibilities for disruptive technologies across diverse fields, including wearable devices, medical technology, robotics, and beyond. In this review of shape-morphing metamaterials, we examine the current state of the field and propose a unified classification system for the mechanisms involved, as well as the design principles underlying them. Specifically, we explore two main categories of unit cells-those that exploit structural anisotropy or internal rotations-and two potential approaches to tessellating these cells: based on kinematic compatibility or geometric frustration. We conclude by discussing the available design tools and highlighting emerging challenges in the development of shape-morphing metamaterials.

Title: Origin of performance enhancement of superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors by He-ion irradiation
Authors: Stefan Strohauer, Fabian Wietschorke, Markus Döblinger, Christian Schmid, Stefanie Grotowski, Lucio Zugliani, Björn Jonas, Kai Müller, Jonathan J. Finley
Abstract: Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) are indispensable in fields such as quantum science and technology, astronomy, and biomedical imaging, where high detection efficiency, low dark count rates and high timing accuracy are required. Recently, helium (He) ion irradiation was shown to be a promising method to enhance SNSPD performance. Here, we study how changes in the underlying superconducting NbTiN film and the SiO2/Si substrate affect device performance. While irradiated and unirradiated NbTiN films show similar crystallinity, we observe He bubble formation below the SiO2/Si interface and an amorphization of the Si substrate. Both reduce the thermal conductance between the superconducting thin film and the substrate from 210 W/m^2/K^4 to 70 W/m^2/K^4 after irradiation with 2000 ions/nm^2. This effect, combined with the lateral straggle of He ions in the substrate, allows the modification of the superconductor-to-substrate thermal conductance of an SNSPD by selectively irradiating the regions around the nanowire. With this approach, we achieved an increased plateau width of saturating intrinsic detection efficiency of 9.8 uA compared to 3.7 uA after full irradiation. Moreover, the critical current remained similar to that of the unirradiated reference device (59 uA versus 60.1 uA), while full irradiation reduced it to 22.4 uA. Our results suggest that the irradiation-induced reduction of the thermal conductance significantly enhances SNSPD sensitivity, offering a novel approach to locally engineer substrate properties for improved detector performance.

Title: Predictive Modeling and Uncertainty Quantification of Fatigue Life in Metal Alloys using Machine Learning
Authors: Jiang Chang, Deekshith Basvoju, Aleksandar Vakanski, Indrajit Charit, Min Xian
Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning-based methods have demonstrated great potential for improved property prediction in material science. However, reliable estimation of the confidence intervals for the predicted values remains a challenge, due to the inherent complexities in material modeling. This study introduces a novel approach for uncertainty quantification in fatigue life prediction of metal materials based on integrating knowledge from physics-based fatigue life models and machine learning models. The proposed approach employs physics-based input features estimated using the Basquin fatigue model to augment the experimentally collected data of fatigue life. Furthermore, a physics-informed loss function that enforces boundary constraints for the estimated fatigue life of considered materials is introduced for the neural network models. Experimental validation on datasets comprising collected data from fatigue life tests for Titanium alloys and Carbon steel alloys demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The synergy between physics-based models and data-driven models enhances the consistency in predicted values and improves uncertainty interval estimates.

Title: Thermal Stability and Depinning Currents of Domain Wall-Based Artificial Synapses
Authors: Guntas Kaur, Tanmoy Pramanik
Abstract: Micromagnetic modeling is employed to optimize the design of artificial synapse devices based on the spin-orbit-torque (SOT) driven domain wall (DW) motion along a nanotrack with triangular notches. Key attributes, such as the thermal stability of the pinned DW and depinning currents, are obtained for varied nanotrack geometry and pinning strength. Depinning probability as a function of SOT current density and pulse width is studied using finite temperature micromagnetic simulations for varying pinning potential. Results show that wider notches provide better thermal stability - depinning current trade-off. On the other hand, narrow notches exhibit less variation in the depinning times at finite temperatures. It is observed that the DW position can be set precisely to any desired location by the SOT current pulse if the thermal stability is sufficiently high. It is also observed that the meta-plastic functionality can be obtained by adding notches of progressively higher depinning currents along the rectangular nanotrack.

Abstract: In the quest for secure and reliable random number generation, Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (MTJs) have emerged as a promising technology due to their unique ability to exploit the stochastic nature of magnetization switching. This paper presents an engineering-oriented design of a drift-resilient MTJ-based True Random Number Generator (TRNG) utilizing a hybrid control strategy. We address the critical issue of switching probability drift, which can compromise the randomness and bias the output of MTJ-based TRNGs. Our approach combines a self-stabilization strategy, which dynamically adjusts the driving voltage based on real-time feedback, with pulse width modulation to enhance control over the switching probability. Through comprehensive experimental and simulation results, we demonstrate significant improvements in the stability, uniformity, and quality of the random numbers generated. The proposed system offers flexibility and adaptability for diverse applications, making it a reliable solution for high-quality randomness in cryptography, secure communications, and beyond.

Title: Optimal spectral transport of non-Hermitian systems
Authors: Mingtao Xu, Zongping Gong, Wei Yi
Abstract: The optimal transport problem seeks to minimize the total transportation cost between two distributions, thus providing a measure of distance between them. In this work, we study the optimal transport of the eigenspectrum of one-dimensional non-Hermitian models as the spectrum deforms on the complex plane under a varying imaginary gauge field. Notably, according to the non-Bloch band theory, the deforming spectrum continuously connects the eigenspectra of the original non-Hermitian model (with vanishing gauge field) under different boundary conditions. It follows that the optimal spectral transport should contain key information of the model. Characterizing the optimal spectral transport through the Wasserstein metric, we show that, indeed, important features of the non-Hermitian model, such as the (auxiliary) generalized Brillouin zone, the non-Bloch exceptional point, and topological phase transition, can be determined from the Wasserstein-metric calculation. We confirm our conclusions using concrete examples. Our work highlights the key role of spectral geometry in non-Hermitian physics, and offers a practical and convenient access to the properties of non-Hermitian models.

Title: Heat Transfer in Composite Materials: Mechanisms and Applications
Authors: Mohammad Alaghemandi, Morgan Alamandi
Abstract: Understanding heat transfer in composite materials is essential for optimizing their performance in critical applications across industries such as aerospace, automotive, renewable energy, and construction. This review offers a comprehensive examination of the various heat transfer mechanisms within composite materials and explores how these processes, spanning different length and time scales, are influenced by the materials' composition and structure.

Title: A Tale of Two Sides of Wafer: Physical Implementation and Block-Level PPA on Flip FET with Dual-sided Signals
Authors: Haoran Lu, Xun Jiang, Yanbang Chu, Ziqiao Xu, Rui Guo, Wanyue Peng, Yibo Lin, Runsheng Wang, Heng Wu, Ru Huang
Abstract: As the conventional scaling of logic devices comes to an end, functional wafer backside and 3D transistor stacking are consensus for next-generation logic technology, offering considerable design space extension for powers, signals or even devices on the wafer backside. The Flip FET (FFET), a novel transistor architecture combining 3D transistor stacking and fully functional wafer backside, was recently proposed. With symmetric dual-sided standard cell design, the FFET can deliver around 12.5% cell area scaling and faster but more energy-efficient libraries beyond other stacked transistor technologies such as CFET. Besides, thanks to the novel cell design with dual-sided pins, the FFET supports dual-sided signal routing, delivering better routability and larger backside design space. In this work, we demonstrated a comprehensive FFET evaluation framework considering physical implementation and block-level power-performance-area (PPA) assessment for the first time, in which key functions are dual-sided routing and dual-sided RC extraction. A 32-bit RISC-V core was used for the evaluation here. Compared to the CFET with single-sided signals, the FFET with single-sided signals achieved 23.3% post-P&R core area reduction, 25.0% higher frequency and 11.9% lower power at the same utilization, and 16.0 % higher frequency at the same core area. Meanwhile, the FFET supports dual-sided signals, which can further benefit more from flexible allocation of cell input pins on both sides. By optimizing the input pin density and BEOL routing layer number on each side, 10.6% frequency gain was realized without power degradation compared to the one with single-sided signal routing. Moreover, the routability and power efficiency of FFET barely degrades even with the routing layer number reduced from 12 to 5 on each side, validating the great space for cost-friendly design enabled by FFET.

Title: Turing in the shadows of Nobel and Abel: an algorithmic story behind two recent prizes
Authors: David Gamarnik
Abstract: The 2021 Nobel Prize in physics was awarded to Giorgio Parisi ``for the discovery of the interplay of disorder and fluctuations in physical systems from atomic to planetary scales,'' and the 2024 Abel Prize in mathematics was awarded to Michel Talagrand ``for his groundbreaking contributions to probability theory and functional analysis, with outstanding applications in mathematical physics and statistics.'' What remains largely absent in the popular descriptions of these prizes, however, is the profound contributions the works of both individuals have had to the field of \emph{algorithms and computation}. The ideas first developed by Parisi and his collaborators relying on remarkably precise physics intuition, and later confirmed by Talagrand and others by no less remarkable mathematical techniques, have revolutionized the way we think algorithmically about optimization problems involving randomness. This is true both in terms of the existence of fast algorithms for some optimization problems, but also in terms of our persistent failures of finding such algorithms for some other optimization problems. The goal of this article is to highlight these developments and explain how the ideas pioneered by Parisi and Talagrand have led to a remarkably precise characterization of which optimization problems admit fast algorithms, versus those which do not, and furthermore to explain why this characterization holds true.

Title: SUSY transformation as the coupler of non-interacting systems
Authors: Vit Jakubsky
Abstract: Quasi-one-dimensional chains of atoms can be effectively described by one-dimensional Dirac-type equation. Crystal structure of the chain is reflected by pseudo-spin of the quasi-particles. In the article, we present a simple framework where supersymmetric transformation is utilized to generate an interaction between two, initially non-interacting systems described by pseudo-spin-one Dirac-type equation. In the presented example, the transformation converts two asymptotically non-interacting atomic chains into a saw chain locally. The model possesses a flat band whose energy can be fine-tuned deliberately.

Title: On-demand storage and retrieval of single photons from a semiconductor quantum dot in a room-temperature atomic vapor memory
Authors: Benjamin Maaß, Avijit Barua, Norman Vincenz Ewald, Elizabeth Robertson, Kartik Gaur, Suk In Park, Sven Rodt, Jin-Dong Song, Stephan Reitzenstein, Janik Wolters
Abstract: Interfacing light from solid-state single-photon sources with scalable and robust room-temperature quantum memories has been a long-standing challenge in photonic quantum information technologies due to inherent noise processes and time-scale mismatches between the operating conditions of solid-state and atomic systems. Here, we demonstrate on-demand storage and retrieval of single photons from a semiconductor quantum dot device in a room-temperature atomic vapor memory. A deterministically fabricated InGaAs quantum dot light source emits single photons at the wavelength of the cesium D1 line at 895\,nm which exhibit an inhomogeneously broadened linewidth of 5.1(7)\,GHz and are subsequently stored in a low-noise ladder-type cesium vapor memory. We show control over the interaction between the single photons and the atomic vapor, allowing for variable retrieval times of up to 19.8(3)\,ns at an internal efficiency of $\eta_\mathrm{int}=0.6(1)\%$. Our results significantly expand the application space of both room-temperature vapor memories and semiconductor quantum dots in future quantum network architectures.

Title: Transient Finite Element Simulation of Accelerator Magnets Using Thermal Thin Shell Approximation
Authors: Erik Schnaubelt, Andrea Vitrano, Mariusz Wozniak, Emmanuele Ravaioli, Arjan Verweij, Sebastian Schöps
Abstract: Thermal transient responses of superconducting magnets can be simulated using the finite element (FE) method. Some accelerator magnets use cables whose electric insulation is significantly thinner than the bare electric conductor. The FE discretisation of such geometries with high-quality meshes leads to many degrees of freedom. This increases the computational time, particularly since non-linear material properties are involved. In this work, we propose to use a thermal thin-shell approximation (TSA) to improve the computational efficiency when solving the heat diffusion equation in two dimensions. We apply the method to compute the thermal transient response of superconducting accelerator magnets used for CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and High-Luminosity LHC. The TSA collapses thin electrical insulation layers into lines while accurately representing the thermal gradient across the insulation's thickness. The TSA is implemented in the multipole module of the open-source Finite Element Quench Simulator (FiQuS), which can generate the multipole magnet models programmatically from input text files. First, the TSA approach is verified by comparison to classical FE simulations with meshed surface insulation regions for a simple block of four cables and a detailed model of the MBH dipole. The results show that the TSA approach reduces the computational time significantly while preserving the accuracy of the solution. Second, the quench heater (QH) delay computed with the TSA method is compared to measurements for the MBH magnet. To this end, the thermal transient simulation is coupled to a magnetostatic solution to account for magneto-resistive effects. Third, the TSA's full capabilities are showcased in non-linear magneto-thermal simulations of several LHC and HL-LHC superconducting magnet models. The full source code, including all input files, is publicly available.

Title: Two-Photon Interference from an InAs Quantum Dot emitting in the Telecom C-Band
Authors: Jaewon Kim, Jochen Kaupp, Yorick Reum, Giora Peniakov, Johannes Michl, Felix Kohr, Monika Emmerling, Martin Kamp, Yong-Hoon Cho, Tobias Huber-Loyola, Sven Höfling, Andreas T. Pfenning
Abstract: Two-photon interference from an InAs/InAlGaAs quantum dot (QD) emitting in the telecom C-band with a raw two-photon interference visibility of $V_{HOM}=(71.9\pm0.2)$ % is demonstrated. This is achieved by a two-fold approach: an improvement of the molecular beam epitaxial growth for better QDs, and integration of the QDs into an optical circular Bragg grating resonator for a Purcell enhancement of the radiative decay rate. The quantum optical properties of the fabricated device are studied by means of time-correlated single-photon counting under quasi-resonant excitation of the charged exciton line. A reduced lifetime of $T_1=(257.5\pm0.2)$ ps is found corresponding to a Purcell factor of $F_P\geqq(4.7\pm0.5)$. Pronounced anti-bunching of the second-order autocorrelation function at zero time delay $g^{(2)} (0)=(0.0307\pm0.0004)$ confirms the single-photon emission character. The two-photon interference is demonstrated with an unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer in Hong-Ou-Mandel configuration. We discuss strategies how to further improve the indistinguishability, and provide a survey of the state-of-the art.

Title: Large area monocrystalline and surfactant-free copper microflake synthesis
Authors: Elif Nur Dayi, Diotime Pellet, Priscila Vensaus, Fatemeh Kiani, Alan R. Bowman, Omer Can Karaman, Giulia Tagliabue
Abstract: Copper is one of the most extensively studied materials for energy conversion and catalytic systems, with a wide range of other applications from nanophotonics to biotechnology. However, existing synthesis methods are limited with many undesirable by-products and poorly defined morphologies. Here, we report a surfactant-free on-substrate wet synthesis approach that yields monocrystalline metallic Cu microflakes with (111) crystalline exposed surface. By systematically studying the growth mechanism, we achieve unprecedented sizes of more than 130 {\mu}m, which is two orders of magnitude larger than reported in most previous studies, along with higher aspect ratios of over 400. Furthermore, we show distinctly higher stability against oxidation provided by the halide adlayer. Overall, our facile synthesis approach delivers an exciting venue for the emerging fields of catalysis and nanophotonics.

Title: Sharp low-temperature spectral asymptotics for reversible diffusions in temperature-dependent domains
Authors: Noé Blassel, Tony Lelièvre, Gabriel Stoltz
Abstract: We derive novel sharp low-temperature asymptotics for the spectrum of the infinitesimal generator of the overdamped Langevin dynamics. The novelty is that this operator is endowed with homogeneous Dirichlet conditions at the boundary of a domain which depends on the temperature. From the point of view of stochastic processes, this gives information on the long-time behavior of the diffusion conditioned on non-absorption at the boundary, in the so-called quasistationary regime. Our results provide sharp estimates of the spectral gap and principal eigenvalue, extending the Eyring--Kramers formula. The phenomenology is richer than in the case of a fixed boundary and gives new insight into the sensitivity of the spectrum with respect to the shape of the domain near critical points of the energy function. Our work is motivated by--and is relevant to--the problem of finding optimal hyperparameters for accelerated molecular dynamics algorithms.

Title: Laser cooled 137BaF molecules for measuring nuclear-spin-dependent parity violation
Authors: Felix Kogel, Tatsam Garg, Marian Rockenhäuser, Tim Langen
Abstract: We demonstrate optical cycling and transverse laser cooling of a beam of fermionic 137BaF molecules. Their high masses and nuclear spins make these molecules sensitive probes for parity violation and properties of the weak interaction. However, the nuclear spins also lead to a quasi-closed cycling transition currently involving up to 112 levels, which significantly exceeds the complexity in other laser-cooled molecules. Optical cycling and cooling are facilitated through carefully designed optical spectra tailored to this molecular structure. Our results pave the way for efficient state preparation, detection, and cooling in precision measurements using this species and other similar species.

Title: Graphene-Assisted Chemical Stabilization of Liquid Metal Nano Droplets for Liquid Metal Based Energy Storage
Authors: Afsaneh L. Sanati, Timur Nikitin, Rui Fausto, Carmel Majidi, Mahmoud Tavakoli
Abstract: Energy storage devices with liquid_metal electrodes have attracted interest in recent years due to their potential for mechanical resilience, self_healing, dendrite_free operation, and fast reaction kinetics. Gallium alloys like Eutectic Gallium Indium (EGaIn) are appealing due to their low melting point and high theoretical specific capacity. However, EGaIn electrodes are unstable in highly alkaline electrolytes due to Gallium oxide dissolution. In this letter, this bottleneck is addressed by introducing chemically stable films in which nanoscale droplets of EGaIn are coated with trace amounts of graphene oxide (GO). It is demonstrated that a GO to EGaIn weight ratio as low as 0.01 provides enough protection for a thin film formed by GO EGaIn nanocomposite against significantly acidic or alkaline environments (pH 1-14). It is shown that GO coating significantly enhances the surface stability in such environments, thus improving the energy storage capacity by over 10x. Microstructural analysis confirms GO EGaIn composite stability and enhanced electrochemical performance. Utilizing this, a thin film supercapacitor is fabricated. Results indicate that when coating the EGaIn with GO to EGaIn ratio of 0.001 the areal capacitance improves by 10 times, reaching 20.02 mF cm_2. This breakthrough paves the way for advanced liquid metal-based thin film electrodes, promising significant improvements in energy storage applications.

Title: Acceleration as refrigeration: Acceleration-induced spontaneous symmetry breaking in thermal medium
Authors: Maxim N. Chernodub
Abstract: We argue that a uniform acceleration of matter produces an effect similar to cooling, thus leading, in particular, to the enhancement effect of spontaneous symmetry breaking. This conclusion is supported by the observation by Unruh and Weiss that thermal correlation functions computed at a temperature equal to the Unruh temperature are identical to the corresponding correlation functions in a Minkowski (zero-temperature) vacuum. We consider an example of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model in a co-accelerating reference frame and show that the uniform acceleration of hot gas of interacting fermions enhances the mass gap generation and increases the critical temperature of the chiral transition. We derive a simple dependence of the critical temperature of a second-order phase transition on acceleration that, as we argue, should be applicable to a broad range of field theories.

Title: Expediting quantum state transfer through long-range extended XY model
Authors: Sejal Ahuja, Tanoy Kanti Konar, Leela Ganesh Chandra Lakkaraju, Aditi Sen De
Abstract: Going beyond short-range interactions, we explore the role of long-range interactions in the extended XY model for transferring quantum states through evolution. In particular, employing a spin-1/2 chain with interactions decaying as a power law, we demonstrate that long-range interactions significantly enhance the efficiency of a quantum state transfer (QST) protocol, reducing the minimum time required to achieve fidelity beyond the classical limit. Our study identifies the long-range regime as providing an optimal balance between interaction range and transfer efficiency, outperforming the protocol with the short-range interacting model. Our detailed analysis reveals the impact of system parameters, such as anisotropy, magnetic field strength, and coordination number, on QST dynamics. Specifically, we find that intermediate coordination numbers lead to a faster and more reliable state transfer, while extreme values diminish performance. Further, we exhibit that the presence of long-range interactions also improves the achievable fidelity, mitigating its decline associated with increasing system-size.

Title: The Effect of Optimal Self-Distillation in Noisy Gaussian Mixture Model
Authors: Kaito Takanami, Takashi Takahashi, Ayaka Sakata
Abstract: Self-distillation (SD), a technique where a model refines itself from its own predictions, has garnered attention as a simple yet powerful approach in machine learning. Despite its widespread use, the mechanisms underlying its effectiveness remain unclear. In this study, we investigate the efficacy of hyperparameter-tuned multi-stage SD in binary classification tasks with noisy labeled Gaussian mixture data, utilizing a replica theory. Our findings reveals that the primary driver of SD's performance improvement is denoising through hard pseudo-labels, with the most notable gains observed in moderately sized datasets. We also demonstrate the efficacy of practical heuristics, such as early stopping for extracting meaningful signal and bias fixation for imbalanced data. These results provide both theoretical guarantees and practical insights, advancing our understanding and application of SD in noisy settings.

Title: Colossal orbital-Edelstein effect in non-centrosymmetric superconductors
Authors: Luca Chirolli, Maria Teresa Mercaldo, Claudio Guarcello, Francesco Giazotto, Mario Cuoco
Abstract: In superconductors that lack inversion symmetry, the flow of supercurrent can induce a non-vanishing magnetization, a phenomenon which is at the heart of non-dissipative magneto-electric effects, also known as Edelstein effects. For electrons carrying spin and orbital moments a question of fundamental relevance deals with the orbital nature of magneto-electric effects in conventional spin-singlet superconductors with Rashba coupling. Remarkably, we find that the supercurrent-induced orbital magnetization is more than one order of magnitude greater than that due to the spin, giving rise to a colossal magneto-electric effect. The induced orbital magnetization is shown to be sign tunable, with the sign change occurring for the Fermi level lying in proximity of avoiding crossing points in the Brillouin zone. In the presence of superconducting phase inhomogeneities, a modulation of the Edelstein signal on the scale of the superconducting coherence length appears, leading to domains with opposite orbital moment orientations. These hallmarks are robust to real-space self-consistent treatment of the superconducting order parameter. The orbital-dominated magneto-electric phenomena, hence, have clear-cut marks for detection both in the bulk and at the edge of the system and are expected to be a general feature of multi-orbital superconductors with inversion symmetry breaking.

Title: Microscopic dynamics and Bose-Einstein condensation in liquid helium
Authors: K. Trachenko
Abstract: We review fundamental problems involved in liquid theory including both classical and quantum liquids. Understanding classical liquids involves exploring details of their microscopic dynamics and its consequences. Here, we apply the same general idea to quantum liquids. We discuss momentum condensation in liquid helium which is consistent with microscopic dynamics in liquids and high mobility of liquid atoms. We propose that mobile transit atoms accumulate in the finite-energy state where the transit speed is close to the speed of sound. In this state, the transit energy is close to the zero-point energy. In momentum space, the accumulation operates on a sphere with the radius set by interatomic spacing and corresponds to zero net momentum. We show that this picture is supported by experiments, including the kinetic energy of helium atoms below the superfluid transition and sharp peaks of scattered intensity at predicted energy. We discuss the implications of this picture including the macroscopic wave function and superfluidity. The superfluid transition temperature is evaluated to be within 15% of the experimental value.

Title: Computationally accelerated experimental materials characterization -- drawing inspiration from high-throughput simulation workflows
Authors: Markus Stricker, Lars Banko, Nik Sarazin, Niklas Siemer, Jan Janssen, Lei Zhang, Jörg Neugebauer, Alfred Ludwig
Abstract: Computational materials science increasingly benefits from data management, automation, and algorithm-based decision-making for the simulation of material properties and behavior. Experimental materials science also changes rapidly by incorporation of `machine learning' in materials discovery campaigns. The obvious benefits which include automation, reproducibility, data provenance, and reusability of managed data, however, is not widely available in the experimental domain. We present an implementation of a Active Learning loop with a direct interface to an experimental measurement device in pyiron, a framework designed for high-throughput simulations, as demonstrator how to combine experimental and simulated data in one framework. Apart from the acceleration provided by the active learning approach, additional acceleration of the experimental characterization is achieved by using prior knowledge from density functional theory simulations as well as composition-property predictions from literature mining using correlations in word embeddings. With data from all domains in the same framework, a heretofore untapped and much-needed potential for the acceleration of materials characterization and materials discovery campaigns becomes available.

Title: Ab initio quantum many-body description of superconducting trends in the cuprates
Authors: Zhi-Hao Cui, Junjie Yang, Johannes Tölle, Hong-Zhou Ye, Shunyue Yuan, Huanchen Zhai, Gunhee Park, Raehyun Kim, Xing Zhang, Lin Lin, Timothy C. Berkelbach, Garnet Kin-Lic Chan
Abstract: Using a systematic ab initio quantum many-body approach that goes beyond low-energy models, we directly compute the superconducting pairing order and estimate the pairing gap of several doped cuprate materials and structures within a purely electronic picture. We find that we can correctly capture two well-known trends: the pressure effect, where the pairing order and gap increase with intra-layer pressure, and the layer effect, where the pairing order and gap vary with the number of copper-oxygen layers. From these calculations, we observe that the strength of superexchange and the covalency at optimal doping are the best descriptors for these trends. Our microscopic analysis further identifies that strong short-range spin fluctuations and multi-orbital charge fluctuations drive the development of the pairing order. Our work illustrates the possibility of a material-specific ab initio understanding of unconventional high-temperature superconducting materials.

Title: Orbital Pumping Incorporating Both Orbital Angular Momentum and Position
Authors: Seungyun Han, Hye-Won Ko, Jung Hyun Oh, Hyun-Woo Lee, Kyung-Jin Lee, Kyoung-Whan Kim
Abstract: We develop a theory of adiabatic orbital pumping, highlighting qualitative differences from spin pumping. An oscillating magnetic field pumps not only orbital angular momentum current but also orbital angular position current. The latter, which has no spin counterpart, underscores the incompleteness of existing orbital torque theories. Importantly, both types of orbital currents can be detected as transverse electric voltages, which contain considerable second harmonic components unlike in spin pumping. Moreover, orbital currents can be pumped by lattice dynamics that carry phonon angular momentum, implying that orbital currents can, in turn, induce phonon angular momentum. Our work open up new possibilities for generating orbital currents and provides a broader understanding of the interplay between spin, orbital, and phonon dynamics.

Title: Boundary phase transitions of two-dimensional quantum critical XXZ model
Authors: Hong-Hao Song, Long Zhang
Abstract: The boundary critical behavior of the two-dimensional (2D) quantum antiferromagnetic (AF) XXZ model coupled with either a dangling spin-1/2 XXZ chain or a dangling two-leg ladder on the boundary is studied with the bosonization and renormalization group analysis. A rich boundary phase diagram is obtained in each case. In the dangling chain case, the boundary either develops a long-range AF order in the easy-plane or the easy-axis direction with extraordinary critical behavior, or has a valence bond solid order with ordinary boundary critical behavior. In the case of a dangling two-leg ladder, besides the possible easy-plane or easy-axis AF ordered phases on the boundary with extraordinary critical behavior, the boundary can form a singlet phase with ordinary critical behavior without breaking any symmetry. These results are consistent with recent numerical simulations on the boundary critical behavior of 2D quantum spin models.

Title: Small-amplitude synchronisation in driven Potts models
Authors: Jan Meibohm, Massimiliano Esposito
Abstract: We study driven $q$-state Potts models with thermodynamically consistent dynamics and global coupling. For a wide range of parameters, these models exhibit a dynamical phase transition from decoherent oscillations into a synchronised phase. Starting from a general microscopic dynamics for individual oscillators, we derive the normal form of the high-dimensional Hopf-Bifurcation that underlies the phase transition. The normal-form equations are exact in the thermodynamic limit and close to the bifurcation. Exploiting the symmetry of the model, we solve these equations and thus uncover the intricate stable synchronisation patterns of driven Potts models, characterised by a rich phase diagram. Making use of thermodynamic consistency, we show that synchronisation reduces dissipation in such a way that the most stable synchronised states dissipate the least entropy. Close to the phase transition, our findings condense into a linear dissipation-stability relation that connects entropy production with phase-space contraction, a stability measure. At finite system size, our findings suggest a minimum-dissipation principle for driven Potts models that holds arbitrarily far from equilibrium.

Title: Minimum-dissipation principle for synchronised stochastic oscillators far from equilibrium
Authors: Jan Meibohm, Massimiliano Esposito
Abstract: We prove a linear stability-dissipation relation (SDR) for $q$-state Potts models driven far from equilibrium by a nonconservative force. At a critical coupling strength, these models exhibit a synchronisation transition from a decoherent into a synchronised state. In the vicinity of this transition, the SDR connects the entropy production rate per oscillator to the phase-space contraction rate, a measure of stability, in a simple way. For large but finite systems, we argue that the SDR implies a minimum-dissipation principle for driven Potts models as the dynamics selects stable non-equilibrium states with least dissipation. This principle holds arbitrarily far from equilibrium, for any stochastic dynamics, and for all $q$.

Title: Noncollinear phase of the antiferromagnetic sawtooth chain
Authors: R. Rausch, C. Karrasch
Abstract: The antiferromagnetic sawtooth chain is a prototypical example of a frustrated spin system with vertex-sharing triangles, giving rise to complex quantum states. Depending on the interaction parameters, this system has three phases, of which the gapless non-collinear phase (for strongly coupled basal spins and loosely attached apical spins) has received little theoretical attention so far. In this work, we comprehensively investigate the properties of the non-collinear phase using large-scale tensor network computations which exploit the full SU(2) symmetry of the underlying Heisenberg model. We study the ground state both for finite systems using the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) as well as for infinite chains via the variational uniform matrix-product state (VUMPS) formalism. Finite temperatures and correlation functions are tackled via imaginary- or real time evolutions, which we implement using the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP). We find that the non-collinear phase is characterized by a low-momentum peak and a diffuse tail for the apex-apex correlations. Deep into the phase, the pattern sharpens into a peak indicating a 90-degree spiral. The apical spins are soft and highly susceptible to external perturbations; they give rise to a large number of gapless magnetic states that are polarized by weak fields and cause a long low-temperature tail in the specific heat. The dynamic spin-structure factor exhibits additive contributions from a two-spinon continuum (excitations of the basal chain) and a gapless peak at $k=\pi/2$ (excitations of the apical spins). Small temperatures excite the gapless states and smear the spectral weight of the $k=\pi/2$ peak out into a homogeneous flat-band structure. Our results are relevant, e.g., for the material atacamite Cu$_2$Cl(OH)$_3$ in high magnetic fields.

Title: Many-body computing on Field Programmable Gate Arrays
Authors: Songtai Lv, Yang Liang, Yuchen Meng, Xiaochen Yao, Jincheng Xu, Yang Liu, Qibin Zheng, Haiyuan Zou
Abstract: A new implementation of many-body calculations is of paramount importance in the field of computational physics. In this study, we leverage the capabilities of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) for conducting quantum many-body calculations. Through the design of appropriate schemes for Monte Carlo and tensor network methods, we effectively utilize the parallel processing capabilities provided by FPGAs. This has resulted in a tenfold speedup compared to CPU-based computation for a Monte Carlo algorithm. By using a supercell structure and simulating the FPGA architecture on a CPU with High-Level Synthesis, we achieve $O(1)$ scaling for the time of one sweep, regardless of the overall system size. We also demonstrate, for the first time, the utilization of FPGA to accelerate a typical tensor network algorithm for many-body ground state calculations. Additionally, we show that the current FPGA computing acceleration is on par with that of multi-threaded GPU parallel processing. Our findings unambiguously highlight the significant advantages of hardware implementation and pave the way for novel approaches to many-body calculations.

Title: SU($N$) altermagnetism: Lattice models, magnon modes, and flavor-split bands
Authors: Pedro M. Cônsoli, Matthias Vojta
Abstract: Altermagnetism, a type of magnetic order that combines properties of ferro- and antiferromagnets, has stirred great interest lately not only as a promising source of spintronics applications, but also as a potential gateway to exotic phases of matter. Here, we demonstrate how to generalize collinear altermagnetism to SU($N$) magnets with $N>2$. Guided by symmetry principles, we present a recipe to construct Heisenberg models for such generalized altermagnets and apply it explicitly for $N=3,4$. Using flavor-wave theory, we compute the excitation spectrum of a two-dimensional SU(3) model and show that it exhibits magnon bands with altermagnetic splitting according to magnetic quantum numbers; we connect this quantum-number splitting to the frequently used concept of magnon chirality. We also compute the electronic band structure for a metallic system of the same symmetry and map out the polarization of the resulting flavor-split bands.

Title: Discovering High-Strength Alloys via Physics-Transfer Learning
Authors: Yingjie Zhao, Hongbo Zhou, Zian Zhang, Zhenxing Bo, Baoan Sun, Minqiang Jiang, Zhiping Xu
Abstract: Predicting the strength of materials requires considering various length and time scales, striking a balance between accuracy and efficiency. Peierls stress measures material strength by evaluating dislocation resistance to plastic flow, reliant on elastic lattice responses and crystal slip energy landscape. Computational challenges due to the non-local and non-equilibrium nature of dislocations prohibit Peierls stress evaluation from state-of-the-art material databases. We propose a data-driven framework that leverages neural networks trained on force field simulations to understand crystal plasticity physics, predicting Peierls stress from material parameters derived via density functional theory computations, which are otherwise computationally intensive for direct dislocation modeling. This physics transfer approach successfully screen the strength of metallic alloys from a limited number of single-point calculations with chemical accuracy. Guided by these predictions, we fabricate high-strength binary alloys previously unexplored, utilizing high-throughput ion beam deposition techniques. The framework extends to problems facing the accuracy-performance dilemma in general by harnessing the hierarchy of physics of multiscale models in materials sciences.

Title: Theoretical lower limit of coercive field in ferroelectric hafnia
Authors: Jiyuan Yang, Jing Wu, Jingxuan Li, Chao Zhou, Yang Sun, Zuhuang Chen, Shi Liu
Abstract: The high coercive field ($\mathcal{E}_c$) of hafnia-based ferroelectrics presents a major obstacle to their applications. The ferroelectric switching mechanisms in hafnia that dictate $\mathcal{E}_c$, especially those related to domain nucleation in the Nucleation-Limited-Switching (NLS) model and domain wall motion in the Kolmogorov-Avrami-Ishibas (KAI) model, have remained elusive. We develop a deep-learning-assisted multiscale approach, incorporating atomistic insights into the critical nucleus, to predict both NLS- and KAI-type coercive fields. The theoretical NLS-type $\mathcal{E}_c$ values agree with previous experimental results as well as our own measurements and also exhibit the correct thickness scaling for films between 3 and 20 nm. Combined theoretical and experimental investigations reveal that the giant $\mathcal{E}_c$ in hafnia-based ferroelectrics arises from the ultra-thin geometry, which confines switching to the NLS mechanism. We predict that the theoretical lower limit for KAI-type $\mathcal{E}_c$ is 0.1 MV/cm arsing from mobile domain walls. The activation of KAI-type switching to achieve lower $\mathcal{E}_c$ is supported by our experimental demonstration of a low coercive field of 1 MV/cm in a 60 nm ferroelectric (HfO$_2$)$_n$/(ZrO$_2$)$_n$ ($n=3$ unit cells) superlattices. These findings establish a comprehensive framework for understanding ferroelectric switching in hafnia and highlight the potential of geometry and domain-wall engineering to achieve low-$\mathcal{E}_c$ devices.

Title: Combined X-ray diffraction, electrical resistivity, and $ab$ $initio$ study of (TMTTF)$_2$PF$_6$ under pressure: implications to the unified phase diagram
Authors: Miho Itoi, Kazuyoshi Yoshimi, Hanming Ma, Takahiro Misawa, Takao Tsumuraya, Dilip Bhoi, Tokutaro Komatsu, Hatsumi Mori, Yoshiya Uwatoko, Hitoshi Seo
Abstract: We present a combined experimental and theoretical study on the quasi-one-dimensional organic conductor (TMTTF)$_2$PF$_6$, and elucidate the variation of its physical properties under pressure. We fully resolve the crystal structure by single crystal x-ray diffraction measurements using a diamond anvil cell up to 8 GPa, and based on the structural data, we perform first-principles density-functional theory calculations and derive the $ab$ $initio$ extended Hubbard-type Hamiltonians. Furthermore, we compare the behavior of the resistivity measured up to 3 GPa using a BeCu clamp-type cell and the ground state properties of the obtained model numerically calculated by the many-variable variational Monte Carlo method. Our main findings are as follows: i) The crystal was rapidly compressed up to about 3 GPa where the volume drops to 80% and gradually varies down to 70% at 8 GPa. The transfer integrals increase following such behavior whereas the screened Coulomb interactions decrease, resulting in a drastic reduction of correlation effect. ii) The degree of dimerization in the intrachain transfer integrals, as the result of the decrease in structural dimerization together with the change in the intermolecular configuration, almost disappears above 4 GPa; the interchain transfer integrals also show characteristic variations under pressure. iii) The results of identifying the characteristic temperatures in the resistivity and the charge and spin orderings in the calculations show an overall agreement: The charge ordering sensitively becomes unstable above 1 GPa, while the spin ordering survives up to higher pressures. These results shed light on the similarities and differences between applying external pressure and substituting the chemical species (chemical pressure).

Title: Chiral magnon in ferromagnetic chiral crystals
Authors: Dapeng Yao, Takehito Yokoyama
Abstract: We theoretically propose chiral magnon in ferromagnetic chiral crystals. We show that the crystal chirality is imprinted in orbital angular momentum of magnons which exhibits the opposite signs for opposite chiralities of the crystal. We also show that a finite magnon orbital angular momentum can be induced by a temperature gradient which is a magnonic analogue of the Edelstein effect.

Title: A universal phenomenology of charge-spin interconversion and dynamics in diffusive systems with spin-orbit coupling
Authors: Tim Kokkeler, F. Sebastian Bergeret, Ilya Tokatly
Abstract: We present an effective field theory for a unified description of transport in normal and superconducting metals in the presence of generic spin-orbit coupling (SOC). The structure of the quantum kinetic theory in the diffusive regime is determined by a set of fundamental constraints -- charge conjugation symmetry, the causality principle, and the crystal symmetry of a material. These symmetries uniquely fix the action of the Keldysh non-linear $\sigma$ model (NLSM), which at the saddle point yields the quantum kinetic Usadel-type equation. Our phenomenological approach is reminiscent of the Ginzburg-Landau theory, but is valid for superconductors in the whole temperature range, describes the diffusive transport in the normal state, and naturally captures the effects of superconducting fluctuations. As an application, we derive the NLSM and quantum transport equations which include all effects of spin-orbit coupling, allowed by the crystal symmetry, for example, the spin Hall, spin current swapping or spin-galvanic effects. Our approach can be extended to systems with broken time reversal symmetry, as well as to the description of hybrid interfaces, where the spin-charge interconversion can be enhanced due to strong interfacial SOC.

Title: Giant Impurity Effects on Charge Loop Current Order States in Kagome Metals
Authors: Seigo Nakazawa, Rina Tazai, Youichi Yamakawa, Seiichiro Onari, Hiroshi Kontani
Abstract: The exotic electronic states in the charge loop current (cLC) phase, in which the permanent charge current breaks the time-reversal-symmetry (TRS), have been attracting increasing attention in recently discovered kagome metal AV3Sb5 (A = Cs, Rb, K). Interestingly, the cLC state is sensitively controlled by applying small magnetic field as well as tiny uniaxial strain. In addition, many experiments indicate that the cLC state is sensitive to the small number of impurities. To understand the impurity effects on the cLC electronic states accurately, we analyze the giant unit-cell (up to 1200 sites) kagome lattice model with single impurity potential. The loop current is found to be strongly suppressed within the current correlation length $\xi_J$ centered on the impurity site, where $\xi_J$ increases as the cLC order parameter $\eta$ decreases. (The cLC order is the pure imaginary hopping integral modulation $\delta t_{i,j}=\pm i\eta$.) In addition, both the uniform orbital magnetization $M_{orb}$ and the anomalous Hall conductivity $\sigma_{xy}$ are drastically suppressed by dilute impurities. Especially, the suppression ratio $R=-\Delta M_{orb}/M_{orb}^0$ can exceed 50% by introducing $\sim1\,\%$ impurities. Unexpectedly, the ratio $R$ is qualitatively insensitive to $\eta$, in highly contrast to a naive expectation that $R$ is proportional to the current suppression area $\pi \xi_J^2$. The obtained giant impurity effect of $M_{orb}$ would originate from the non-local contribution from the itinerant circulation of electrons. The present study gives a natural explanation why the cLC electronic states in kagome metals are sensitive to the dilute impurities.

Title: Comparison of superconducting pairing in doped cuprates and nickelates within an extended Hubbard model
Authors: Yicheng Xiong, Hang Ma, Hongxing Liu, Runyu Ma, Tianxing Ma
Abstract: Within a Hubbard model, we investigate the superconducting pairing behavior of infinite-layer nickelate $\mathrm{NdNiO_2}$ and cuprate superconductors by using the determinant quantum Monte Carlo method. Our focus is on comparing their dominant pairing symmetries. The results indicate that the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing interaction is significantly enhanced at low temperatures in both doped nickelates and cuprates, whereas other typical pairing symmetries are effectively suppressed, highlighting the dominance of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing form. Additionally, we find that the effective pairing interaction for $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing in doped nickelates is slightly lower than that in doped cuprates, which may be attributed to the different degrees of Fermi surface warping caused by the third-nearest hopping $t''$. Further studies show that the hole doping and interaction strength have significant effects on the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing interaction within the selected parameter range. The $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing interaction is notably weakened when the hole doping increases, whereas it is significantly enhanced with increasing Coulomb interaction strength $U$. This comparative analysis reveals the similarities and differences in the pairing behaviors of doped nickelates and cuprates, which may provide further insights into understanding the superconducting properties of these two classes of materials.

Title: Lindblad quantum dynamics from correlation functions of classical spin chains
Authors: Markus Kraft, Mariel Kempa, Jiaozi Wang, Robin Steinigeweg
Abstract: The Lindblad quantum master equation is one of the central approaches to the physics of open quantum systems. In particular, boundary driving enables the study of transport, where a steady state emerges in the long-time limit, which features a constant current and a characteristic density profile. While the Lindblad equation complements other approaches to transport in closed quantum systems, it has become clear that a connection between closed and open systems exists in certain cases. Here, we build on this connection for magnetization transport in the spin-1/2 XXZ chain with and without integrability-breaking perturbations. Specifically, we study the question whether the time evolution of the open quantum system can be described on the basis of classical correlation functions, as generated by the Hamiltonian equations of motion for real vectors. By comparing to exact numerical simulations of the Lindblad equation, we find a good accuracy of such a description for a range of model parameters, which is consistent with previous studies on closed systems. While this agreement is an interesting physical observation, it also suggests that classical mechanics can be used to solve the Lindblad equation for comparatively large system sizes, which lie outside the possibilities of a quantum mechanical treatment. We also point out counterexamples and limitations for the quantitative extraction of transport coefficients. Remarkably, our classical approach to large open systems allows to detect superdiffusion at the isotropic point.

Title: Learning local equivariant representations for quantum operators
Authors: Zhanghao Zhouyin, Zixi Gan, MingKang Liu, Shishir Kumar Pandey, Linfeng Zhang, Qiangqiang Gu
Abstract: Predicting quantum operator matrices such as Hamiltonian, overlap, and density matrices in the density functional theory (DFT) framework is crucial for material science. Current methods often focus on individual operators and struggle with efficiency and scalability for large systems. Here we introduce a novel deep learning model, SLEM (strictly localized equivariant message-passing) for predicting multiple quantum operators, that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while dramatically improving computational efficiency. SLEM's key innovation is its strict locality-based design for equivariant representations of quantum tensors while preserving physical symmetries. This enables complex many-body dependency without expanding the effective receptive field, leading to superior data efficiency and transferability. Using an innovative SO(2) convolution and invariant overlap parameterization, SLEM reduces the computational complexity of high-order tensor products and is therefore capable of handling systems requiring the $f$ and $g$ orbitals in their basis sets. We demonstrate SLEM's capabilities across diverse 2D and 3D materials, achieving high accuracy even with limited training data. SLEM's design facilitates efficient parallelization, potentially extending DFT simulations to systems with device-level sizes, opening new possibilities for large-scale quantum simulations and high-throughput materials discovery.

Title: Modeling drop deformations and rheology of dilute to dense emulsions
Authors: Rodrigo B Reboucas, Nadia N Nikolova, Vivek Sharma
Abstract: We highlight the current state-of-the-art in modeling emulsion rheology, ranging from dilute to jammed dense systems. We focus on analytical and numerical methods developed for calculating, computing, and tracking drop deformation en route to developing constitutive models for flowing emulsions. We identify material properties and dimensionless parameters, collate the small deformation theories and resulting expressions for viscometric quantities, list theoretical and numerical methods, and take stock of challenges for capturing connections between drop deformation, morphology, and rheology of emulsions. We highlight the substantial progress in providing quantitative descriptions of the rheological response using analytical theories, dimensional analysis, and powerful computational fluid dynamics to determine how macroscopic rheological properties emerge from microscopic features, including deformation and dynamics of non-interacting or interacting drops and molecular aspects that control the interfacial properties.

Title: Enhanced Strange Metallicity due to Hubbard-U Coulomb Repulsion
Authors: Andrew Hardy, Olivier Parcollet, Antoine Georges, Aavishkar A. Patel
Abstract: We solve a model of electrons with Hubbard-$U$ Coulomb repulsion and a random Yukawa coupling to a two-dimensional bosonic bath, using an extended dynamical mean field theory scheme. Our model exhibits a quantum critical point, at which the repulsive component of the electron interactions strongly enhances the effects of the quantum critical bosonic fluctuations on the electrons, leading to a breakdown of Fermi liquid physics and the formation of a strange metal with `Planckian' ($\mathcal{O}(k_B T/\hbar)$) quasiparticle decay rates at low temperatures $T\rightarrow 0$. Furthermore, the eventual Mott transition that occurs as the repulsion is increased seemingly bounds the maximum decay rate in the strange metal. Our results provide insight into low-temperature strange metallicity observed in proximity to a Mott transition, as is observed, for instance, in recent experiments on certain moiré materials.

Title: Nonuniversality in random criticality
Authors: Gesualdo Delfino
Abstract: We consider $N$ two-dimensional Ising models coupled in presence of quenched disorder and use scale invariant scattering theory to exactly show the presence of a line of renormalization group fixed points for any fixed value of $N$ other than 1. We show how this result relates to perturbative studies and sheds light on numerical simulations. We also observe that the limit $N\to 1$ may be of interest for the Ising spin glass, and point out potential relevance for nonuniversality in other contexts of random criticality.

Title: Fractional Quantum Hall phases of graphene beyond ultra-short range intervalley-anisotropic interaction
Authors: Oleg Grigorev, Ankur Das
Abstract: Recent experimental and theoretical development in the Quantum Hall effect in monolayer graphene showed that the previous model of the valley-anisotropy interaction is incomplete, as it was assumed to be ultra-short range (USR). In this work, we use exact diagonalization to go beyond the ultra-short range to find the different phases for $\nu=2/3$. We model the interaction as Yukawa so that we can control the range as a proof of concept. Even in this simple setting, we discovered how dropping the USR condition shifts the transition borders in favour of certain phases, leads to a new bond-ordered phase appearing, and breaks the ferromagnetic phase in two competing states as a result of lifting the USR-driven degeneracy.

Title: Nonlocal Moments in the Chern Bands of Twisted Bilayer Graphene
Authors: Patrick J. Ledwith, Junkai Dong, Ashvin Vishwanath, Eslam Khalaf
Abstract: Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) has elements in common with two paradigmatic examples of strongly correlated physics: quantum Hall physics and Hubbard physics. On one hand, TBG hosts flat topological Landau-level-like bands which exhibits quantum anomalous Hall effects. On the other hand, these bands have concentrated charge density and show signs of extensive entropy resembling local moments. The combination of these features leads to a question: can decoupled moments emerge in an isolated topological band, despite the lack of exponentially localized Wannier states? In this work, we answer the question affirmatively by proposing a minimal model for these bands in TBG that combines topology and charge concentration at the AA sites, leading to analytic wavefunctions that closely approximate those of the BM model with realistic parameters. Importantly, charge concentration also leads to Berry curvature concentration at $\Gamma$, generating a small parameter $s$ that yields analytic tractability. We show that, rather surprisingly, the model hosts nearly decoupled flavor moments without any extra degrees of freedom. These moments are non-local due to topology-enforced power-law tails, yet have parametrically small overlap. We further develop a diagrammatic expansion in which the self energy can be computed exactly to leading order in $s^2$ in the fluctuating moment regime. At charge neutrality, we find a "Mott semimetal", with large flavor entropy and a Mott gap everywhere in the BZ except for the vicinity of the $\Gamma$ point. Away from neutrality, the Mott semimetal gaps out in a spectrally imbalanced manner, with one Mott band having zero $Z_k$ at the $\Gamma$ point. The model accurately reproduces results from finite temperature thermodynamic measurements, leads to new experimental predictions, and resolves the problem of the emergence of Hubbard physics in isolated topological bands.

Title: Inverse Design of Winding Tuple for Non-Hermitian Topological Edge Modes
Authors: Zihe Yang, Kunling Zhou, Bowen Zeng, Yong Hu
Abstract: The interplay between topological localization and non-Hermiticity localization in non-Hermitian crystal systems results in a diversity of shapes of topological edge modes (EMs), offering opportunities to manipulate these modes for potential topological applications. The characterization of the domain of EMs and the engineering of these EMs require detailed information about their wave functions, which conventional calculation of topological invariants cannot provide. In this Letter, by recognizing EMs as specified solutions of eigenequation, we derive their wave functions in an extended non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. We then inversely construct a winding tuple $\left \{ w_{\scriptscriptstyle GBZ},w_{\scriptscriptstyle BZ}\right \} $ that characterizes the existence of EMs and their spatial distribution. Moreover, we define a novel spectral winding number equivalent to $w_{\scriptscriptstyle BZ}$, which is determined by the product of energies of different bands. The inverse design of topological invariants allows us to categorize the localized nature of EMs even in systems lacking sublattice symmetry, which can facilitate the manipulation and utilization of EMs in the development of novel quantum materials and devices.

Title: Tensor network Monte Carlo simulations for the two-dimensional random-bond Ising model
Authors: Tao Chen, Erdong Guo, Wanzhou Zhang, Pan Zhang, Youjin Deng
Abstract: Disordered lattice spin systems are crucial in both theoretical and applied physics. However, understanding their properties poses significant challenges for Monte Carlo simulations. In this work, we investigate the two-dimensional random-bond Ising model using the recently proposed Tensor Network Monte Carlo (TNMC) method. This method generates biased samples from conditional probabilities computed via tensor network contractions and corrects the bias using the Metropolis scheme. Consequently, the proposals provided by tensor networks function as block updates for Monte Carlo simulations. Through extensive numerical experiments, we demonstrate that TNMC simulations can be performed on lattices as large as $1024\times 1024$ spins with moderate computational resources, a substantial increase from the previous maximum size of $64\times 64$ in MCMC. Notably, we observe an almost complete absence of critical slowing down, enabling the efficient collection of unbiased samples and averaging over a large number of random realizations of bond disorders. We successfully pinpoint the multi-critical point along the Nishimori line with significant precision and accurately determined the bulk and surface critical exponents. Our findings suggest that TNMC is a highly efficient algorithm for exploring disordered and frustrated systems in two dimensions.

Title: Perturbation theory for dispersion relations of spacetime-periodic materials
Authors: Erik Orvehed Hiltunen
Abstract: We consider Bloch states of weak spacetime-periodic perturbations of homogeneous materials in one spatial dimension. The interplay of space- and time-periodicity leads to an infinitely degenerate dispersion relation in the free case. We consider a general perturbation term, and, as consequence of the infinite degeneracy, we show that the effective equations are given by the eigenvalue problem of an infinite matrix. Our method can be viewed as a time-modulated generalisation of the nearly-free electron model. Based on this result, we find that the infinite degeneracy may split into a family of non-degenerate bands. Our results are illustrated with numerical calculations, and we observe close agreement between the perturbation theory and the numerically computed full solution.

Title: Linear response of a Chern insulator to finite-frequency electric fields
Authors: Jason G. Kattan, Alistair H. Duff, J. E. Sipe
Abstract: We derive the macroscopic charge and current densities of a Chern insulator initially occupying its electronic ground state as it responds to a finite-frequency electric field; we use a previously developed formalism based on microscopic polarization and magnetization fields in extended media. In a topologically trivial insulator, our result reduces to the familiar expression for the induced current density in linear response obtained from a Kubo analysis. But for a Chern insulator we find an extra "topological" term involving the (first) Chern number associated with the occupied bands, encoding the quantum anomalous Hall effect in the presence of a frequency-dependent electric field. While an analogous term has been introduced in the "modern theories of polarization and magnetization" for the linear response of finite-sized systems to static electric fields, our expression is valid for bulk Chern insulators in the presence of both static and finite-frequency electric fields, being derived analytically from a microscopic treatment of the electronic degrees of freedom, and can be generalized in a straightforward way to describe the response of a Chern insulator to electromagnetic fields that are not only frequency-dependent but also spatially inhomogeneous.

Title: High-Throughput Discovery of Kagome Materials in Transition Metal Oxide Monolayers
Authors: Renhong Wang, Cong Wang, Ruixuan Li, Deping Guo, Jiaqi Dai, Canbo Zong, Weihan Zhang, Wei Ji
Abstract: Kagome materials are known for hosting exotic quantum states, including quantum spin liquids, charge density waves, and unconventional superconductivity. The search for kagome monolayers is driven by their ability to exhibit neat and well-defined kagome bands near the Fermi level, which are more easily realized in the absence of interlayer interactions. However, this absence also destabilizes the monolayer forms of many bulk kagome materials, posing significant challenges to their discovery. In this work, we propose a strategy to address this challenge by utilizing oxygen vacancies in transition metal oxides within a "1+3" design framework. Through high-throughput computational screening of 349 candidate materials, we identified 12 thermodynamically stable kagome monolayers with diverse electronic and magnetic properties. These materials were classified into three categories based on their lattice geometry, symmetry, band gaps, and magnetic configurations. Detailed analysis of three representative monolayers revealed kagome band features near their Fermi levels, with orbital contributions varying between oxygen 2p and transition metal d states. This study demonstrates the feasibility of the "1+3" strategy, offering a promising approach to uncovering low-dimensional kagome materials and advancing the exploration of their quantum phenomena.

Title: Temperature-Stable Tunneling Current in Serial Double Quantum Dots: Insights from Nonequilibrium Green Functions and Pauli Spin Blockade
Authors: David M T Kuo
Abstract: We theoretically investigate charge transport through serial double quantum dots (SDQDs) with strong electron correlations using nonequilibrium Green's function techniques. In the linear response regime, we compute the charge stability diagram and analyze the Coulomb oscillatory tunneling current, revealing both thermal and nonthermal broadening effects on the current spectra in relation to two gate voltages. In the nonlinear response regime, we focus on tunneling currents in SDQDs under the Pauli spin blockade (PSB) scenario. We find that current rectification with negative differential conductance is significantly degraded as temperature increases, making it challenging to distinguish between the inter-site spin triplet and singlet states. Notably, we observe a robust reversed tunneling current that remains stable against temperature variations, provided the resonant channel in the PSB scenario is coupled to the states of the right (left) electrode, which is fully occupied (unoccupied) by particles. This characteristic provides valuable insights for designing transistors capable of operating over a wide temperature range.

Title: On the time complexity analysis of numerical percolation threshold estimation
Authors: Daniel García Solla
Abstract: The main purpose of percolation theory is to model phase transitions in a variety of random systems, which is highly valuable in fields related to materials physics, biology, or otherwise unrelated areas like oil extraction or even quantum computing. Thus, one of the problems encountered is the calculation of the threshold at which such transition occurs, known as percolation threshold. Since there are no known closed forms to determine the threshold in an exact manner in systems with particular properties, it is decided to rely on numerical methods as the Monte Carlo approach, which provides a sufficiently accurate approximation to serve as a valid estimate in the projects or research where it is involved. However, in order to achieve an exact characterization of the threshold in two-dimensional systems with site percolation, in this work it is performed an analysis of the complexity, both temporal and spatial, of an algorithm that implements its computation from the aforementioned numerical method. Specifically, the conduction of an accurate analysis of the cost of such algorithm implies a deep enough knowledge about certain metrics regarding its duration, or work completed per iteration, which along with its formalization may contribute to the determination of the threshold based on these metrics. Nevertheless, as a result, various bounds are achieved for the best, average and worst cases of the execution on systems spanning several dimensions, revealing that in 1 and 2 the complexity is directly conditioned by the duration, although from 3 onwards no proof for this point has been found, notwithstanding the evidence suggesting its compliance. Furthermore, based on the average case, several methods are proposed that could be applied to characterize the threshold, although they have not been thoroughly explored beyond what is necessary for the complexity analysis.

Title: Interplay of Quantum and Thermal Fluctuations in Two-Dimensional Randomly Pinned Charge Density Waves
Authors: Matthew C. O'Brien, Eduardo Fradkin
Abstract: The interplay between quantum and thermal fluctuations in the presence of quenched random disorder is a long-standing open theoretical problem which has been made more urgent by advances in modern experimental techniques. The fragility of charge density wave order to impurities makes this problem of particular interest in understanding a host of real materials, including the cuprate high-temperature superconductors. To address this question, we consider the quantum version of an exactly solvable classical model of two-dimensional randomly pinned incommensurate charge density waves first introduced by us in a recent work, and use the large-$N$ technique to obtain the phase diagram and order parameter correlations. Our theory considers quantum and thermal fluctuations and disorder on equal footing by accounting for all effects non-perturbatively, which reveals a novel crossover between under-damped and over-damped dynamics of the fluctuations of the charge density wave order parameter.

Title: From scale-free to Anderson localization: a size-dependent transition
Authors: Burcu Yılmaz, Cem Yuce, Ceyhun Bulutay
Abstract: Scale-free localization in non-Hermitian systems is a distinctive type of localization where the localization length of certain eigenstates, known as scale-free localized (SFL) states, scales proportionally with the system size. Unlike skin states, where the localization length is independent of the system size, SFL states maintain a spatial profile that remains invariant as the system size changes. We consider a model involving a single non-Hermitian impurity in an otherwise Hermitian one-dimensional lattice. Introducing disorder into this system transforms SFL states into Anderson-localized states. In contrast to the Hatano-Nelson model, where disorder typically leads to the localization of skin states and a size-independent Anderson transition, the scale-free localization in our model causes a size-dependent Anderson transition.

Title: Geometric properties of the additional third-order transitions in the two-dimensional Potts model
Authors: Wei Liu, Xin Zhang, Lei Shi, Kai Qi, Xiang Li, Fangfang Wang, Zengru Di
Abstract: Within the canonical ensemble framework, this paper investigates the presence of higher-order transition signals in the $q$-state Potts model (for $q \geq 3$), using two geometric order parameters: isolated spins number and the average perimeter of clusters. Our results confirm that higher-order transitions exist in the Potts model, where the number of isolated spins reliably indicates third-order independent transitions. This signal persists regardless of the system's phase transition order, even at higher values of $q$. In contrast, the average perimeter of clusters, used as an order parameter for detecting third-order dependent transitions, shows that for $q = 6$ and $q = 8$, the signal for third-order dependent transitions disappears, indicating its absence in systems undergoing first-order transitions. These findings are consistent with results from microcanonical inflection-point analysis, further validating the robustness of this approach.

Title: Modeling Extensive Defects in Metals through Classical Potential-Guided Sampling and Automated Configuration Reconstruction
Authors: Fei Shuang, Kai Liu, Yucheng Ji, Wei Gao, Luca Laurenti, Poulumi Dey
Abstract: Extended defects such as dislocation networks and general grain boundaries are ubiquitous in metals, and accurately modeling these extensive defects is crucial for understanding their deformation mechanisms. Existing machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) often fall short in adequately describing these defects, as their significant characteristic sizes exceed the computational limits of first-principles calculations. In this study, we address these challenges by establishing a comprehensive defect genome through empirical interatomic potential-guided sampling. To further enable accurate first-principles calculations on this defect genome, we have developed an automated configuration reconstruction technique. This method transforms defect atomic clusters into periodic configurations through precise atom insertion, utilizing Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations. These strategies enable the development of highly accurate and transferable MLIPs for modeling extensive defects in metals. Using body-centered cubic tungsten as a model system, we develop an MLIP that reveals unique plastic mechanisms in simulations of nanoindentation. This framework not only improves the modeling accuracy of extensive defects in crystalline materials but also establishes a robust foundation for further advancement of MLIP development through the strategic use of defect genomes.

Title: Comparison of Kikuchi Diffraction Geometries in Scanning Electron Microscope
Authors: Tianbi Zhang, Lukas Berners, Jakub Holzer, T. Ben Britton
Abstract: Recent advances in scanning electron microscope (SEM) based Kikuchi diffraction have demonstrated the important potential for reflection and transmission methods, like transmission Kikuchi diffraction (TKD) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). Furthermore, with the advent of compact direct electron detectors (DED) it has been possible to place the detector in a variety of configurations within the SEM chamber. This motivates the present work where we explore the similarities and differences of the different geometries that include on-axis TKD & off-axis TKD using electron transparent samples, as well as more conventional EBSD. Furthermore, we compare these with the newest method called "reflection Kikuchi diffraction" RKD where the sample is placed flat in the chamber and the detector is placed below the pole piece. Through remapping collected diffraction patterns, all these methods can be used to generate an experimental "diffraction sphere" that can be used to explore diffraction from any scattering vector from the unit cell, as well as the ability to perform band profile analysis. This diffraction sphere approach enables us to further probe specific differences between the methods, including for example thickness effects in TKD that can result in the generation of diffraction spots, as well as electron scattering path length effects that result in excess and deficiency variations, as well as inversion of bands in experimental patterns.

Title: Electronic Structure, mass fluctuation, and Localized Bond Properties of two-dimensional double-layer transition metal chalcogenide MX$_2$ (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se, Te) Calculated Based on Density Functional Theory and BBC model
Authors: Yaorui Tan, Maolin Bo
Abstract: This study systematically investigates the electronic structure and bonding properties of two-dimensional bilayer transition metal chalcogenides MX$_2$ (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se, Te) using density functional theory calculations. Through the analysis of band gaps, deformation bond energies, and non-Hermitian bonding characteristics of various MX$_2$ compounds, the electronic properties and chemical bonding features are comprehensively examined. The findings demonstrate that charge transfer plays a critical role in electron mass fluctuation, with the incorporation of topological geometric analysis confirming the influence of mass changes on atomic bonding and electronic states. Furthermore, Heterojunctions between distinct atomic layers are shown to effectively modulate the band gap of two-dimensional bilayer transition metal chalcogenides. This work establishes a theoretical foundation for advancing the application of these materials.

Title: Perspective: Time irreversibility in systems observed at coarse resolution
Authors: Cai Dieball, Aljaž Godec
Abstract: A broken time-reversal symmetry, i.e. broken detailed balance, is central to non-equilibrium physics and is a prerequisite for life. However, it turns out to be quite challenging to unambiguously define and quantify time-reversal symmetry (and violations thereof) in practice, that is, from observations. Measurements on complex systems have a finite resolution and generally probe low-dimensional projections of the underlying dynamics, which are well known to introduce memory. In situations where many microscopic states become "lumped" onto the same observable "state" or when introducing "reaction coordinates" to reduce the dimensionality of data, signatures of a broken time-reversal symmetry in the microscopic dynamics become distorted or masked. In this perspective we highlight why in defining and discussing time-reversal symmetry, and quantifying its violations, the precise underlying assumptions on the microscopic dynamics, the coarse graining, and further reductions, are not a technical detail. These assumptions decide whether the conclusions that are drawn are physically sound or inconsistent. We summarize recent findings in the field and reflect upon key challenges.

Title: Altermagnetic and Noncentrosymmetric Metals
Authors: V.P.Mineev
Abstract: A theory of the normal and superconducting states of piezomagnetic metals, which are altermagnetic materials, has been developed. This has been done in comparison with the corresponding theoretical description for metals that do not have spatial inversion symmetry. Particular attention has been paid to the problem of the anomalous Hall effect, and its absence has been demonstrated in both altermagnetic and non-centrosymmetric metals. It has been shown that the superconducting state in altermagnets always arises by pairing electrons from zones split by spin-orbit interaction, which makes the existence of such superconductors unlikely.

Title: Proof of absence of local conserved quantities in two- and higher-dimensional quantum Ising models
Authors: Yuuya Chiba
Abstract: We prove that the Ising models with transverse and longitudinal fields on the hypercubic lattices with dimensions higher than one have no local conserved quantities other than the Hamiltonian. This holds for any value of the longitudinal field, including zero, as far as the transverse field and the Ising interactions are nonzero. The conserved quantity considered here is ``local'' in a very weak sense: it can be written as a linear combination of operators whose side lengths of the supports in one direction do not exceed half the system size, while the side lengths in the other directions are arbitrary. We also prove that the above result holds even in the ladder system. Our results extend the recently developed technique of the proof of absence of local conserved quantities in one-dimensional systems to higher dimensions and to the ladder.

Title: Theory of Valley Splitting in Si/SiGe Spin-Qubits: Interplay of Strain, Resonances and Random Alloy Disorder
Authors: Abel Thayil, Lasse Ermoneit, Markus Kantner
Abstract: Electron spin-qubits in silicon-germanium (SiGe) heterostructures are a major candidate for the realization of scalable quantum computers. A critical challenge in strained Si/SiGe quantum wells (QWs) is the existence of two nearly degenerate valley states at the conduction band minimum that can lead to leakage of quantum information. To address this issue, various strategies have been explored to enhance the valley splitting (i.e., the energy gap between the two low-energy conduction band minima), such as sharp interfaces, oscillating germanium concentrations in the QW (known as wiggle well) and shear strain engineering. In this work, we develop a comprehensive envelope-function theory augmented by empirical nonlocal pseudopotential theory to incorporate the effects of alloy disorder, strain, and non-trivial resonances arising from interaction between valley states across different Brillouin zones. We apply our model to analyze common epitaxial profiles studied in the literature with a focus on wiggle well type structures and compare our results with previous work. Our framework provides an efficient tool for quantifying the interplay of these effects on the valley splitting, enabling complex epitaxial profile optimization in future work.

Title: Native antisite defects in h-BN
Authors: Song Li, Pei Li, Adam Gali
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is an excellent host for solid-state single phonon emitters. Experimental observed emission ranges from infrared to ultraviolet. The emission centers are generally attributed to either intrinsic or extrinsic point defects embedded into hBN. Nevertheless, the microscopic structure of most of these defect emitters is uncertain. Here, through density-functional theory calculations we studied the native antisite defects in hBN. We find that the neutral boron antisite might be a nonmagnetic single photon source with zero-phonon-line (ZPL) at 1.58 eV and such a lineshape that is often observed in experiments. Furthermore, the positively charged nitrogen antisite might be associated with a dim color center recently observed as a blue emitter with ZPL at 2.63 eV. These simple single substitution defects indicate the existence of out-of-plane phonon mode which significantly affects the optical properties. Our results could provide useful information for identification of quantum emitters in hBN.

Title: Optimal control for preparing fractional quantum Hall states in optical lattices
Authors: Ling-Na Wu, Xikun Li, Nathan Goldman, Botao Wang
Abstract: Preparing fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states represents a key challenge for quantum simulators. While small Laughlin-type states have been realized by manipulating two atoms or two photons, scaling up these settings to larger ensembles stands as an impractical task using existing methods and protocols. In this work, we propose to use optimal-control methods to substantially accelerate the preparation of small Laughlin-type states, and demonstrate that the resulting protocols are also well suited to realize larger FQH states under realistic preparation times. Our schemes are specifically built on the recent optical-lattice experiment [Leonard et al., Nature (2023)], and consist in optimizing very few control parameters: the tunneling amplitudes and linear gradients along the two directions of the lattice. We demonstrate the robustness of our optimal-control schemes against control errors and disorder, and discuss their advantages over existing preparation methods. Our work paves the way to the efficient realization of strongly-correlated topological states in quantum-engineered systems.

Abstract: Here we present experimental evidence of the pseudo-doublet ground state of the non-Kramers compound SrTm2O4, based on specific heat, magnetic entropy and electron paramagnetic resonance. We demonstrate that the two crystallographic Tm3+ sites give rise to distinct single-ion anisotropies, and by extension, SrTm2O4 hosts two magnetic sublattices. Inelastic neutron scattering reveals low-lying dispersing crystal-field excitations, which we modelled using an effective charge model and mean field random phase approximation. The extracted magnetic exchange interactions are both antiferromagnetic and frustrated for both chains. Interchain magnetic exchange interactions are negligible. The strength of the magnetic exchange interactions in relation to the size of crystal field gaps, together with the frustration and low dimensionality, force the system to remain paramagnetic down to the lowest experimentally reachable temperature despite the pseudo-doublet nature of its ground state.

Title: Topological $X$-states in a quantum impurity model
Authors: Moallison F. Cavalcante, Marcus V. S. Bonança, Eduardo Miranda, Sebastian Deffner
Abstract: Topological qubits are inherently resistant to noise and errors. However, experimental demonstrations have been elusive as their realization and control is highly complex. In the present work, we demonstrate the emergence of topological $X$-states in the long-time response of a locally perturbed quantum impurity model. The emergence of the double-qubit state is heralded by the lack of decay of the response function as well as the out-of-time order correlator signifying the trapping of excitations, and hence information in local edge modes.

Title: Broadband High-Performance Terahertz Polarizers by Nanoimprint Lithography for Advanced Applications
Authors: Alexandre Chicharo, Zdenek Kaspar, Tatiana G. Rappoport, Ajinkya Punjal, Chun-Da Liao, Pieter De Beule, Jerome Borme, Nuno M. R. Peres, Pedro Alpuim
Abstract: Terahertz polarizers are essential for advanced spectroscopic systems but face challenges like low transmission, short bandwidths and low extinction ratios. This study demonstrates the development of ultrabroadband THz polarizers using nanoimprint lithography, achieving high performance through double-wire-grid polarizer (DWGP) structures on cyclic olefin copolymer (COC) substrates. Compared to silicon-based alternatives, the polymer DWGPs demonstrated over twice the TM-polarized transmittance across the 0.1 - 25 THz range. The degree of polarization exceeded 98% in a 0.1-16 THz range, with a maximum extinction ratio above 65.4 dB at 4.2 THz. Simultaneous characterization of materials using THz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) covered extended frequency ranges of 0.1 - 40 THz and 0.9 - 20 THz, respectively. Nanofabricated polymer DWGP revealed the superior optical properties, including enhanced TM transmittance and reduced TE leakage when compared to Si DWGP. Additionally, the fabricated polymer polarizers showcased cost-effectiveness, scalability, and durability, offering a sustainable alternative to conventional Si-based polarizers. The significant developments demonstrated in this study position polymer-based DWGPs as significant components for THz imaging, sensing, and wireless communication systems, paving the way for next-generation technologies.

Title: Corrections to the Hamiltonian induced by finite-strength coupling to the environment
Authors: Marcin Łobejko, Marek Winczewski, Gerardo Suárez, Robert Alicki, Michał Horodecki
Abstract: If a quantum system interacts with the environment, then the Hamiltonian acquires a correction known as the Lamb-shift term. There are two other corrections to the Hamiltonian, related to the stationary state. Namely, the stationary state is to first approximation a Gibbs state with respect to original Hamiltonian. However, if we have finite coupling, then the true stationary state will be different, and regarding it as a Gibbs state to some effective Hamiltonian, one can extract a correction, which is called "steady-state" correction. Alternatively, one can take a static point of view, and consider the reduced state of total equilibrium state, i.e., system plus bath Gibbs state. The extracted Hamiltonian correction is called the "mean-force" correction. This paper presents several analytical results on second-order corrections (in coupling strength) of the three types mentioned above. Instead of the steady state, we focus on a state annihilated by the Liouvillian of the master equation, labeling it as the "quasi-steady state." Specifically, we derive a general formula for the mean-force correction as well as the quasi-steady state and Lamb-shift correction for a general class of master equations. Furthermore, specific formulas for corrections are obtained for the Davies, Bloch-Redfield, and cumulant equation (refined weak coupling). In particular, the cumulant equation serves as a case study of the Liouvillian, featuring a nontrivial fourth-order generator. This generator forms the basis for calculating the diagonal quasi-steady-state correction. We consider spin-boson model as an example, and in addition to using our formulas for corrections, we consider mean-force correction from the reaction-coordinate approach.

Title: Nonlinearity of the post-spinel transition and its expression in slabs and plumes worldwide
Authors: Junjie Dong, Rebecca A. Fischer, Lars Stixrude, Matthew C. Brennan, Kierstin Daviau, Terry-Ann Suer, Katlyn M. Turner, Yue Meng, Vitali B. Prakapenka
Abstract: At the interface of Earth's upper and lower mantle, the post-spinel transition boundary controls the dynamics and morphologies of downwelling slabs and upwelling plumes, and its Clapeyron slope is hence one of the most important constraints on mantle convection. In this study, we reported a new in situ experimental dataset on phase stability in Mg$_{2}$SiO$_{4}$ at mantle transition zone pressures from laser-heated diamond anvil cell experiments, along with a compilation of corrected in situ experimental datasets from the literature. We presented a machine learning framework for high-pressure phase diagram determination and focused on its application to constrain the location and Clapeyron slope of the post-spinel transition: ringwoodite $\leftrightarrow$ bridgmanite + periclase. We found that the post-spinel boundary is nonlinear and its Clapeyron slope varies locally from $-2.3_{-1.4}^{+0.6}$ MPa/K at 1900 K, to $-1.0_{-1.7}^{+1.3}$ MPa/K at 1700 K, and to $0.0_{-2.0}^{+1.7}$ MPa/K at 1500 K. We applied the temperature-dependent post-spinel Clapeyron slope to estimate its lateral variation across the "660-km" seismic discontinuity in subducting slabs and hotspot-associated plumes worldwide, as well as the ambient mantle. We found that, in the present-day mantle, the average post spinel Clapeyron slope in the plumes is three times more negative than that in slabs, and we then discussed the effects of a nonlinear post-spinel transition on the dynamics of Earth's mantle.

Title: Scalar Conformal Field Theories from Lattice Systems
Authors: Junchen Rong
Abstract: We discuss scalar conformal field theories (CFTs) that can be realized in structural phase transitions. The Landau condition and Lifshitz condition are reviewed, which are necessary conditions for a structural phase transition to be second order. We also review the perturbative analysis in $4-\epsilon$ expansion of the corresponding Landau actions, which were already analyzed thoroughly in the 80s. By identifying the global symmetries of these fixed points, it turns out that in perturbation theory only 6 different CFTs can be realized by commensurate structural phase transitions. ${\rm \textbf{Updated in version 2:}}$ We discuss how to classify all the phases of a Landau theory using the computer algebra system GAP. We also discuss the fully packed quantum loop model on the triangular lattice, where the Cubic CFT is realized. This is a lecture note based on a series of talks given by the author. The goal of the lecture note is to bridge the gap between condensed matter physicists and conformal field theorists. The note will be further updated in the future.

Title: Enhancing Noise-Robust Losses for Large-Scale Noisy Data Learning
Authors: Max Staats, Matthias Thamm, Bernd Rosenow
Abstract: Large annotated datasets inevitably contain noisy labels, which poses a major challenge for training deep neural networks as they easily memorize the labels. Noise-robust loss functions have emerged as a notable strategy to counteract this issue, but it remains challenging to create a robust loss function which is not susceptible to underfitting. Through a quantitative approach, this paper explores the limited overlap between the network output at initialization and regions of non-vanishing gradients of bounded loss functions in the initial learning phase. Using these insights, we address underfitting of several noise robust losses with a novel method denoted as logit bias, which adds a real number $\epsilon$ to the logit at the position of the correct class. The logit bias enables these losses to achieve state-of-the-art results, even on datasets like WebVision, consisting of over a million images from 1000 classes. In addition, we demonstrate that our method can be used to determine optimal parameters for several loss functions -- without having to train networks. Remarkably, our method determines the hyperparameters based on the number of classes, resulting in loss functions which require zero dataset or noise-dependent parameters.

Title: The Timescales of Quantum Breaking
Authors: Marco Michel, Sebastian Zell
Abstract: Due to the inevitable existence of quantum effects, a classical description generically breaks down after a finite quantum break-time $t_q$. We aim to find criteria for determining $t_q$. To this end, we construct a new prototype model that features numerous dynamically accessible quantum modes. Using explicit numerical time evolution, we establish how $t_q$ depends on the parameters of the system such as its particle number $N$. The presence of a classical instability leads to $t_q \sim \ln N$ or $t_q\sim \sqrt{N}$. In the stable case, we observe $t_q\sim N$, although full quantum breaking may not take place at all. We find that the different regimes merge smoothly with $t_q\sim N^\gamma$ ($0<\gamma<1$). As an outlook, we point out possibilities for transferring our results to black holes and expanding spacetimes.

Title: Entanglement of weighted graphs uncovers transitions in variable-range interacting models
Authors: Debkanta Ghosh, Keshav Das Agarwal, Pritam Halder, Aditi Sen De
Abstract: The cluster state acquired by evolving the nearest-neighbor (NN) Ising model from a completely separable state is the resource for measurement-based quantum computation. Instead of an NN system, a variable-range power law interacting Ising model can generate a genuine multipartite entangled (GME) weighted graph state (WGS) that may reveal intrinsic characteristics of the evolving Hamiltonian. We establish that the pattern of generalized geometric measure (GGM) in the evolved state with an arbitrary number of qubits is sensitive to fall-off rates and the range of interactions of the evolving Hamiltonian. We report that the time-derivative and time-averaged GGM at a particular time can detect the transition points present in the fall-off rates of the interaction strength, separating different regions, namely long-range, quasi-local and local ones in one- and two-dimensional lattices with deformation. Moreover, we illustrate that in the quasi-local and local regimes, there exists a minimum coordination number in the evolving Ising model for a fixed total number of qubits which can mimic the GGM of the long-range model. In order to achieve a finite-size subsystem from the entire system, we design a local measurement strategy that allows a WGS of an arbitrary number of qubits to be reduced to a local unitarily equivalent WGS having fewer qubits with modified weights.

Title: Hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for the transverse-field Ising model in the thermodynamic limit
Authors: Sumeet, M. Hörmann, K.P. Schmidt
Abstract: We describe a hybrid quantum-classical approach to treat quantum many-body systems in the thermodynamic limit. This is done by combining numerical linked-cluster expansions (NLCE) with the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). Here, the VQE algorithm is used as a cluster solver within the NLCE. We test our hybrid quantum-classical algorithm (NLCE$+$VQE) for the ferromagnetic transverse-field Ising model on the one-dimensional chain and the two-dimensional square lattice. The calculation of ground-state energies on each open cluster demands a modified Hamiltonian variational ansatz for the VQE. One major finding is convergence of NLCE$+$VQE to the conventional NLCE result in the thermodynamic limit when at least $N/2$ layers are used in the VQE ansatz for each cluster with $N$ sites. Our approach demonstrates the fruitful connection of techniques known from correlated quantum many-body systems with hybrid algorithms explored on existing quantum-computing devices.

Title: Fundamental charges for dual-unitary circuits
Authors: Tom Holden-Dye, Lluis Masanes, Arijeet Pal
Abstract: Dual-unitary quantum circuits have recently attracted attention as an analytically tractable model of many-body quantum dynamics. Consisting of a 1+1D lattice of 2-qudit gates arranged in a 'brickwork' pattern, these models are defined by the constraint that each gate must remain unitary under swapping the roles of space and time. This dual-unitarity restricts the dynamics of local operators in these circuits: the support of any such operator must grow at the effective speed of light of the system, along one or both of the edges of a causal light cone set by the geometry of the circuit. Using this property, it is shown here that for 1+1D dual-unitary circuits the set of width-$w$ conserved densities (constructed from operators supported over $w$ consecutive sites) is in one-to-one correspondence with the set of width-$w$ solitons - operators which, up to a multiplicative phase, are simply spatially translated at the effective speed of light by the dual-unitary dynamics. A number of ways to construct these many-body solitons (explicitly in the case where the local Hilbert space dimension $d=2$) are then demonstrated: firstly, via a simple construction involving products of smaller, constituent solitons; and secondly, via a construction which cannot be understood as simply in terms of products of smaller solitons, but which does have a neat interpretation in terms of products of fermions under a Jordan-Wigner transformation. This provides partial progress towards a characterisation of the microscopic structure of complex many-body solitons (in dual-unitary circuits on qubits), whilst also establishing a link between fermionic models and dual-unitary circuits, advancing our understanding of what kinds of physics can be explored in this framework.

Title: Exact, Average, and Broken Symmetries in a Simple Adaptive Monitored Circuit
Authors: Zhi Li, Zhu-Xi Luo
Abstract: Symmetry is a powerful tool for understanding phases of matter in equilibrium. Quantum circuits with measurements have recently emerged as a platform for novel states of matter intrinsically out of equilibrium. Can symmetry be used as an organizing principle for these novel states, their phases and phase transitions? In this work, we give an affirmative answer to this question in a simple adaptive monitored circuit, which hosts an ordering transition in addition to a separate entanglement transition, upon tuning a single parameter. Starting from a symmetry-breaking initial state, depending on the tuning parameter, the steady state could (i) remain symmetry-broken, (ii) exhibit the average symmetry in the ensemble of trajectories, or (iii) exhibit the exact symmetry for each trajectory. The ordering transition is mapped to the transition in a classical majority vote model, described by the Ising universality class, while the entanglement transition lies in the percolation class. Numerical simulations are further presented to support the analytical understandings.

Title: Lowering the Exponential Wall: Accelerating High-Entropy Alloy Catalysts Screening using Local Surface Energy Descriptors from Neural Network Potentials
Authors: Tomoya Shiota, Kenji Ishihara, Wataru Mizukami
Abstract: Computational screening is indispensable for the efficient design of high-entropy alloys (HEAs), which hold considerable potential for catalytic applications. However, the chemical space of HEAs is exponentially vast with respect to the number of constituent elements, making even machine learning-based screening calculations time-intensive. To address this challenge, we propose a rapid method for predicting HEA properties using data from monometallic systems (or few-component alloys). Central to our approach is the newly introduced local surface energy (LSE) descriptor, which captures local surface reactivity at atomic resolution. We established a correlation between LSE and adsorption energies using monometallic systems. Using this correlation in a linear regression model, we successfully estimated molecular adsorption energies on HEAs with significantly higher accuracy than a conventional descriptor (i.e., generalized coordination numbers). Furthermore, we developed high-precision models by employing both classical and quantum machine learning. Our method enabled CO adsorption-energy calculations for 1000 quinary nanoparticles, comprising 201 atoms each, within a few days, considerably faster than density functional theory, which would require hundreds of years or neural network potentials, which would have taken hundreds of days. The proposed approach accelerates the exploration of the vast HEA chemical space, facilitating the design of novel catalysts.

Title: Hydrodynamic modes in holographic multiple-axion model
Authors: Ling-Zheng Xia, Wei-Jia Li
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the shear viscoelasticity and the hydrodynamic modes in a holographic solid model with several sets of axions that all break the translations spontaneously on boundary. Comparing with the single-axion model, the shear modulus is enhanced at high temperatures and the shear viscosity is always suppressed in the presence of additional axions. However, the different sets of axions exhibit competitive relationship in determining the shear modulus at low temperatures. Furthermore, by calculating the black hole quasi-normal modes, it is found that adding more axions only increases the amount of diffusive modes. The number of the sound modes always remains unchanged.

Title: Phase transitions in debt recycling
Authors: Sabrina Aufiero, Preben Forer, Pierpaolo Vivo, Fabio Caccioli, Silvia Bartolucci
Abstract: Debt recycling is an aggressive equity extraction strategy that potentially permits faster repayment of a mortgage. While equity progressively builds up as the mortgage is repaid monthly, mortgage holders may obtain another loan they could use to invest on a risky asset. The wealth produced by a successful investment is then used to repay the mortgage faster. The strategy is riskier than a standard repayment plan since fluctuations in the house market and investment's volatility may also lead to a fast default, as both the mortgage and the liquidity loan are secured against the same good. The general conditions of the mortgage holder and the outside market under which debt recycling may be recommended or discouraged have not been fully investigated. In this paper, to evaluate the effectiveness of traditional monthly mortgage repayment versus debt recycling strategies, we build a dynamical model of debt recycling and study the time evolution of equity and mortgage balance as a function of loan-to-value ratio, house market performance, and return of the risky investment. We find that the model has a rich behavior as a function of its main parameters, showing strongly and weakly successful phases - where the mortgage is eventually repaid faster and slower than the standard monthly repayment strategy, respectively - a default phase where the equity locked in the house vanishes before the mortgage is repaid, signalling a failure of the debt recycling strategy, and a permanent re-mortgaging phase - where further investment funds from the lender are continuously secured, but the mortgage is never fully repaid. The strategy's effectiveness is found to be highly sensitive to the initial mortgage-to-equity ratio, the monthly amount of scheduled repayments, and the economic parameters at the outset. The analytical results are corroborated with numerical simulations with excellent agreement.

Title: Phase Transitions in Anisotropic Turbulence
Authors: Adrian van Kan
Abstract: Turbulence is a widely observed state of fluid flows, characterized by complex, nonlinear interactions between motions across a broad spectrum of length and time scales. While turbulence is ubiquitous, from teacups to planetary atmospheres, oceans and stars, its manifestations can vary considerably between different physical systems. For instance, three-dimensional (3D) turbulent flows display a forward energy cascade from large to small scales, while in two-dimensional (2D) turbulence, energy cascades from small to large scales. In a given physical system, a transition between such disparate regimes of turbulence can occur when a control parameter reaches a critical value. The behavior of flows close to such transition points, which separate qualitatively distinct \textit{phases} of turbulence, has been found to be unexpectedly rich. Here, we survey recent findings on such transitions in highly anisotropic turbulent fluid flows, including turbulence in thin layers and under the influence of rapid rotation. We also review recent work on transitions induced by turbulent fluctuations, such as random reversals and transitions between large-scale vortices and jets, among others. The relevance of these results and their ramifications for future investigations are discussed.

Title: Prediction of NMR Parameters and geometry in 133Cs-containing compounds using Density Functional Theory
Authors: Nurit Manukovsky, Noy Vaisleib, Michal Arbel-Haddad, Amir Goldbourt
Abstract: The need to immobilize low-level nuclear waste, in particular 137Cs-bearing waste, has led to a growing interest in geopolymer-based waste matrices, in addition to optimization attempts of cement matrix compositions for this specific application. Although the overall phase composition and structure of these matrices are well characterized, the binding sites of Cs in these materials have not been clearly identified. Recent studies have suggested that combining the sensitivity of solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (SSNMR) to the local atomic structure with other structural techniques provides insights into the mode of Cs binding and release. Density Functional Theory (DFT) can provide the connection between spectroscopic parameters and geometric properties. However, the reliability of DFT results strongly relies on the choice of a suitable exchange-correlation functional, which for 133Cs, the NMR surrogate for such studies, is not well-established. In this work we benchmark various functionals against their performance in predicting the geometry of various simple Cs compounds, their NMR quadrupolar coupling constants, and their chemical shift values, while prioritizing the ability to incorporate dispersion interactions and maintaining low computational cost. We examined Cs salts, Cs oxides, perovskites, caged materials, a borate glass and a cesium fluoroscandate. While no single functional performs equally well for all parameters, the results show rev-vdW-DF2 and PBEsol+D3 to be leading candidates for these systems, in particular with respect to geometry and chemical shifts, which are of high importance for Cs-immobilization matrices.

Title: A note on the canonical approach to hydrodynamics and linear response theory
Authors: Luca Martinoia, Rajeev Singh
Abstract: This note provides a comprehensive examination of the various approaches to formulating relativistic hydrodynamics, with a particular emphasis on the canonical approach. Relativistic hydrodynamics plays a crucial role in understanding the behavior of fluids in high-energy astrophysical phenomena and heavy-ion collisions. The canonical approach is explored in detail, highlighting its foundational principles, mathematical formulations, and practical implications in modeling relativistic fluid dynamics. Following this, we delve into the linear response theory, elucidating its relevance in the context of hydrodynamics. We analyze the response of relativistic fluids to external perturbations, discussing the theoretical framework and key results. This dual focus aims to bridge the gap between theoretical foundations and practical applications, offering a robust perspective on the dynamic interplay between relativistic hydrodynamics and linear response theory.

Title: Absorbing State Phase Transitions and Stability of Long-Range Coherence in Dissipative Quantum State Preparation
Authors: Matthew Wampler, Nigel R. Cooper
Abstract: We investigate the absorbing state phase transition in a purely dissipative quantum reaction-diffusion model where the absorbing state itself has long range phase coherence. The model may also be viewed as a dissipative quantum state preparation procedure for the (generalized) W-state with errors. The 'error' Lindblad jump operators preserve the W-state as a dark state, but nonetheless act to decohere the system and induce the phase transition. We find cases where the preparation protocol is either fragile or robust against weak error quantum jump rates, and show that remnants of the coherence persist even after the phase transition to the decohering phase. Furthermore, we argue that the long range coherence of the absorbing state leads to critical behavior distinct from Directed Percolation, the typical universality class for reaction-diffusion models.

Title: Viscoelastic Effects on the Hydrodynamics of an Active Compound Particle
Authors: KVS Chaithanya, Sumesh P. Thampi
Abstract: Understanding the hydrodynamics of microswimmers in viscoelastic fluids and confined environments is crucial for interpreting their behaviour in natural settings and designing synthetic microswimmers for practical applications like cargo transport. In this study, we explore the hydrodynamics of a concentric active compound particle - a model microswimmer (a squirmer) positioned at the centre of a viscoelastic fluid droplet (a model cargo) suspended in another viscoelastic medium. We consider the Oldroyd-B constitutive model to characterize the fluids and employ a perturbative approach in the Deborah number to analyze viscoelastic effects analytically, assuming a small Capillary number so that the droplet remains spherical and does not deform. We examine three cases: (i) a squirmer confined within a viscoelastic fluid droplet suspended in a Newtonian fluid, (ii) a squirmer confined within a Newtonian fluid droplet suspended in a viscoelastic fluid, and (iii) a squirmer confined within a viscoelastic fluid droplet suspended in another viscoelastic fluid. Our findings reveal that the swimming speeds of the squirmer and the droplet are determined by the complex interplay of viscoelasticity, the size ratio of the droplet to the squirmer (confinement strength), and the viscosity ratio of the surrounding fluid to the droplet fluid. A critical aspect of this interaction is the positioning of stagnation points within the fluid flow, which governs the distribution of polymeric stress. This distribution, in turn, plays a crucial role in determining the influence of viscoelasticity on the squirmer's dynamics. Our analysis suggests that viscoelastic effects can either enhance or hinder the swimming speed of the squirmer when confined in a droplet, depending on the specific configuration of the system.

Authors: Xiao Wang
Abstract: The development of future quantum devices requires understanding the dynamics of driven many-body systems, in which the Floquet-induced interactions play a central role. This understanding is crucial for coherently controlling quantum states, minimising errors, and benchmarking the performance of these devices. In this thesis, we analyse the enhancement on the Floquet-induced interactions by many-body correlations, and develop an advanced Floquet method to understand the Floquet-induced interactions relevant for future quantum devices.

Title: Toward the Observation of Entangled Pairs in BEC analogue Expanding Universes
Authors: Ivan Agullo, Adrià Delhom, Álvaro Parra-López
Abstract: Pair creation is a fundamental prediction of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes. While classical aspects of this phenomenon have been observed, the experimental confirmation of its quantum origin remains elusive. In this article, we quantify the entanglement produced by pair creation in two dimensional Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) analogues of expanding universes and examine the impact of various experimental factors, including decoherence from thermal noise and losses. Our analysis evaluates the feasibility of detecting entanglement in these systems and identifies optimal experimental configurations for achieving this goal. Focusing on the experimental setup detailed in \cite{Viermann:2022wgw}, we demonstrate that entanglement can be observed in these BEC analogues at a significance level of $\sim 2\sigma$ with current capabilities, and at $\gtrsim 3.3\sigma$ with modest improvements. Achieving this would provide unequivocal evidence of the quantum nature of pair creation and validate one of the most iconic predictions of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes.

Title: Strong and weak symmetries and their spontaneous symmetry breaking in mixed states emerging from the quantum Ising model under multiple decoherence
Authors: Takahiro Orito, Yoshihito Kuno, Ikuo Ichinose
Abstract: Discovering and categorizing quantum orders in mixed many-body systems are currently one of the most important problems. Specific types of decoherence applied to typical quantum many-body states can induce a novel kind of mixed state accompanying characteristic symmetry orders, which has no counterparts in pure many-body states. We study phenomena generated by interplay between two types of decoherence applied to the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model (TFIM). We show that in the doubled Hilbert space formalism, the decoherence can be described by filtering operation applied to matrix product states (MPS) defined in the doubled Hilbert system. The filtering operation induces specific deformation of the MPS, which approximates the ground state of a certain parent Hamiltonian in the doubled Hilbert space. In the present case, such a parent Hamiltonian is the quantum Ashkin-Teller model, having a rich phase diagram with a critical lines and quantum phase transitions. By investigating the deformed MPS, we find various types of mixed states emergent from the ground states of the TFIM, and clarify phase transitions between them. In that study, strong and weak $Z_2$ symmetries play an important role, for which we introduce efficient order parameters, such as Rényi-2 correlators, entanglement entropy, etc., in the doubled Hilbert space.

Title: Bidirectional microwave-optical conversion with an integrated soft-ferroelectric barium titanate transducer
Authors: Charles Möhl, Annina Riedhauser, Max Glantschnig, Daniele Caimi, Ute Drechsler, Antonis Olziersky, Deividas Sabonis, David I. Indolese, Thomas M. Karg, Paul Seidler
Abstract: Efficient, low-noise, and high-bandwidth transduction between optical and microwave photons is key to long-range quantum communication between distant superconducting quantum processors. Recent demonstrations of microwave-optical transduction using the broadband direct electro-optic (Pockels) effect in optical thin films made of AlN or LiNbO$_3$ have shown promise. To improve efficiency and added noise, materials with larger Pockels coefficients, such as the soft ferroelectrics BaTiO$_3$ or SrTiO$_3$, are required. However, these materials require adapted designs and fabrication approaches due to their nonlinear and, in some cases, hysteretic electro-optic response. Here, we engineer an on-chip, triply resonant transducer comprising low-loss BaTiO$_3$-on-SiO$_2$ waveguides monolithically integrated with a superconducting microwave resonator made of Nb. We demonstrate bidirectional microwave-optical transduction and reach total off-chip efficiencies of $1\times10^{-6}$ using pulsed pumping. Our novel device concept permits in-situ poling of the ferroelectric material without introducing excess microwave loss, using a fully subtractive fabrication process with superconducting air bridges. In addition, we investigate optically induced heating, revealing fast thermalization and quasiparticle resilience of the microwave resonator. Our transducer concept and fabrication process are applicable to other materials with a large bias-induced Pockels effect and pave the way for efficient, low-power quantum interconnects.

Title: Non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm Cage in Bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes Systems
Authors: Kunling Zhou, Bowen Zeng, Yong Hu
Abstract: The non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm (AB) cage is a unique localization phenomenon that confines all possible excitations. This confinement leads to fully flat spectra in momentum space, which are typically accompanied with the degeneracy with various types. Classifying the degeneracy type is crucial for studying the dynamical properties of the non-Hermitian AB cage, but the methods for such classification and their physical connections remain not very clear. Here, we construct a non-Hermitian AB cage in a bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) system with various types of degenerate flat bands (DFBs). Using the transfer matrix, we demonstrate the localization mechanism for the formation of AB cage and derive the minimal polynomial in mathematics for classifying the degeneracy types of DFBs, thus providing comprehensive understanding of the correspondence among the degeneracy type of DFBs, the minimal polynomial, and the transfer matrix. With such correspondence, we propose a scheme to realize highly degenerate flat bands.

Title: Nonlinear optomechanical systems with quasi-periodic and chaotic dynamics
Authors: A.P. Saiko, G.A. Rusetsky, S.A. Markevich, R. Fedaruk
Abstract: Model optomechanical systems with photon-vibration interactions linear, quadratic, and cubic in mechanical displacements are studied under conditions for adiabatic elimination of the photon field. The opportunity of transformation of effective potential describing the dynamics of the mechanical resonator from single-well to double-well is demonstrated. The dynamics of the mechanical resonator is considered in the presence of (i) only linear interaction, (ii) only quadratic interaction, (iii) both linear and quadratic interactions, and (iv) all three interactions, while other parameters of the optomechanical system, the modulation optical field, and the initial conditions remain fixed. Quasiperiodic oscillations of the mechanical resonator in the case (i) are replaced by chaotic ones when the cases (ii) or (iii) are realized. It is interesting that in the presence of all three interactions, the chaotic behavior of the mechanical oscillator becomes quasi-periodic. However, increasing the power of the modulation field again leads to chaos.
