Title: Topological effect on order-disorder transitions in U(1) sigma models
Authors: Ryuichi Shindou, Pengwei Zhao
Abstract: U(1) non-linear sigma models (NLSM) with a one-dimensional (1D) Berry phase are studied by a renormalization group theory. Order-disorder transition in U(1) NLSMs in $D \!\ (\ge 2)$-dimensional space ($d+1$-dimensional spacetime; $d\ge 1$) is instigated by the proliferation of vortex excitations, where the 1D Berry phase term confers finite phase factors upon those vortex excitations with finite projection in a subspace complementary to a topological direction with the 1D Berry phase. A destructive interference effect caused by the phase factors may help to develop an intermediate quasi-disorder phase between ordered and disorder phases, which has a divergent order-parameter correlation length along the topological direction, and a finite correlation length along the other directions. In order to explore such a possibility in $D=3$, we develop a perturbative renormalization group theory of a 3D model of vortex loops, in which loop segments interact via a $1/r$ Coulomb interaction. We derive renormalization group (RG) equations among vortex-loop fugacity, Berry phase term, and the Coulomb potential. Approximate analyses of the RG equations show that near an order-disorder transition point, vortex loops are anomalously elongated along the topological direction. Utilizing a duality mapping to a lattice model of a type-II superconductor under a magnetic field, we also argue that a global phase diagram of the 3D U(1) sigma model with 1D Berry phase must have the quasi-disorder phase between ordered and disorder phases.

Title: Machine Learning - Driven Materials Discovery: Unlocking Next-Generation Functional Materials - A minireview
Authors: Dilshod Nematov, Mirabbos Hojamberdiev
Abstract: The rapid advancement of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven techniques is revolutionizing materials discovery, property prediction, and material design by minimizing human intervention and accelerating scientific progress. This review provides a comprehensive overview of smart, machine learning (ML)-driven approaches, emphasizing their role in predicting material properties, discovering novel compounds, and optimizing material structures. Key methodologies ranging from deep learning, graph neural networks, and Bayesian optimization to automated generative models, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs) enable the autonomous design of materials with tailored functionalities. By leveraging AutoML frameworks (e.g., AutoGluon, TPOT, and this http URL), researchers can automate the model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and feature engineering, significantly improving the efficiency of materials informatics. Furthermore, the integration of AI-driven robotic laboratories and high-throughput computing has established a fully automated pipeline for rapid synthesis and experimental validation, drastically reducing the time and cost of material discovery. This review highlights real-world applications of automated ML-driven approaches in predicting mechanical, thermal, electrical, and optical properties of materials, demonstrating successful cases in superconductors, catalysts, photovoltaics, and energy storage systems. We also address key challenges, such as data quality, interpretability, and the integration of AutoML with quantum computing, which are essential for future advancements. Ultimately, the synergy between AI, automated experimentation, and computational modeling transforms the way the materials are discovered, optimized, and designed, paving the way for next-generation innovations in energy, electronics, and nanotechnology.

Title: New Diamond Magnet CaCo2TeO6: Strong Quantum Fluctuations and Enhanced Competing Exchange Interactions Enabled by Octahedral Co2+ Ligand Fields
Authors: Xudong Huai, Luke Pritchard Cairns, Bridget Delles, Michał J. Winiarski, Maurice Sorolla II, Xinshu Zhang, Youzhe Chen, Anshul Kogar, Robert Birgeneau, James Analytis, Stuart Calder, Danielle Yahne, Thao T. Tran
Abstract: Diamond lattice magnets, formed by a framework of corner-sharing tetrahedra of magnetic cations, offer unique opportunities to realize novel states of matter for potential utility in information technology. However, research has mostly focused on AB2X4 spinels with Td magnetic ions. This hinders the atomically enabled tunability of competing interactions at different energy scales and the ability to harness many-body electronic states in quantum materials, making the discovery of quantum fluctuations and spin dynamics less accessible. We discover a new material CaCo2TeO6 featuring a diamond lattice of two distinct Oh-Co2+ sites. This material displays strong quantum fluctuations, increased competing magnetic exchange interactions, and field-induced tunability of magnetic structures. The results demonstrate how simple, fundamental refinements in ligand fields can profoundly influence the phase space of quantum matter.

Title: Equivalence of Chern bands and Landau levels from projected Interactions
Authors: Bo Yang
Abstract: We introduce a universal formulation of the generalized real space interactions with translational invariance, when projected into a single Landau level, can be equivalent to density-density interaction projected into any Chern bands (e.g. Landau levels, continuous moire Chern bands and discrete lattice Chern bands). By constructing a complete basis of generalized pseudopotentials, we define the projected interaction range that can be used to characterize important features of different Chern bands relevant to the robustness of interacting topological phases. The analytical construction allows us to study general Chern bands beyond the torus geometry, for example on the disk or spherical geometry where the edge dynamics and curvature effects can be explored. For moire systems (and lattice Chern bands with large incompressibility gap) one can see transparently the topological Hall viscosity for the fractional states are identical to those in the Landau levels. The physical unprojected interaction also provides a natural embedding for lattice systems, shedding light on the concerns of relying on quantum geometric tensor (varying with lattice embedding in real space) to understand the properties of interacting phases of matters.

Title: Tensor-Network Study of the Roughening Transition in (2 + 1)D lattice gauge theories
Authors: Wen-Tao Xu, Michael Knap, Frank Pollmann
Abstract: Within the confined phase of (2+1)D lattice gauge theories a roughening transition arises between a weakly confined regime with floppy string excitations and a strongly confined regime with stiff string excitations. In this work, we use an infinite Density Matrix Renormalization Group (iDMRG) algorithm to quantitatively characterize the properties of confined strings. To this end, we stabilize the state with a string excitation by 't Hooft loop operators. While for zero gauge-matter coupling we can use bare 't Hooft loop operators to do so, for finite gauge-matter coupling we have to transform them to emergent ones, which we achieve with an adiabatic protocol. By analyzing the scaling of both a novel order parameter and the entanglement entropy, our approach allows us to accurately determine the roughening transition, even at finite gauge-matter coupling.

Title: A Framework for Understanding Colossal Magnetoresistance and Complex Resistivity Behaviors in Magnetic Semiconductor
Authors: Zhihao Liu, Zhong Fang, Hongming Weng, Quansheng Wu
Abstract: Colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) is commonly observed in magnetic semiconductors when an external magnetic field is applied, usually accompanied by anomalous resistivity peaks or humps which were previously considered as evidence of a metal-insulator transition (MIT). Previous research efforts primarily focused on elucidating the CMR effect in ferromagnetic semiconductor systems, which may be inapplicable to antiferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic systems. In our work, we propose a framework to unravel the mechanisms underlying the CMR related phenomenon in magnetic semiconductor, and apply it to the ferrimagnetic semiconductor Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$. A two-carrier model, with electron and hole carriers generated by thermal excitation across the magnetization-dependent band gap, is employed, which accurately reproduces the observed $\rho(B, T)$ curves. Additionally, the shift of $T_c$ (or the anomalous resistivity peak) with increasing direct currents, previously attributed to current control of the chiral orbital current (COC) state, is also reproduced within our framework by properly accounting for the Joule heating effects. Our work provides a quantitative methodology for analyzing and calculating the novel resistivity curves in magnetic semiconductors and clarifies the controversy surrounding the origins of CMR and the concomitant complex behaviors.

Title: Quasiparticle Spectroscopy of Chiral Charge Order
Authors: Jiangchang Zheng, Caiyun Chen, Gaopei Pan, Xu Zhang, Chen Chen, Yuan Da Liao, Ganesh Pokharel, Andrea Capa Salinas, Yizhou Wei, Hoi Chun Po, Ding Pan, Stephen D. Wilson, Zi Yang Meng, Berthold Jäck
Abstract: Electronic interactions can give rise to novel charge density waves with unconventional ground states. Recent experiments report evidence for a chiral charge density wave (CDW) that breaks time-reversal symmetry in the kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=K, Rb or Cs). Theoretical analyses propose a topologically nontrivial loop current phase that spontaneously breaks time-reversal symmetry as the favorable CDW ground state. However, spectroscopic insights into the quasiparticle excitations of chiral charge order in AV$_3$Sb$_5$ compounds are still missing and conflicting experimental results question the presence of a loop current phase. We employed individual magnetic atoms as local quantum sensors to examine the quasiparticle excitations of chiral charge order in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ with the scanning tunneling microscope (STM). Our spectroscopic measurements show that the magnetic moment of Co induces a spatially-localized low-energy state in the CDW phase. The distinct spectral signatures of this state are consistent with theoretical expectations for the quasiparticle excitation of a loop current order parameter, while control experiment rule out alternative scenario. Our work provides unique insights into the ground state of chiral charge order in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ and introduces a novel method to examine other topological states, such as the fractional Chern insulators, with the STM.

Title: Effect of variable relative permittivity on the thermodynamics of asymmetric valency aqueous salts
Authors: A. O. Quiñones, Z. Abbas, C. W. Outhwaite, L. B. Bhuiyan
Abstract: Experimentally determined empirical formulae for the concentration dependent relative permittivity of aqueous solutions of MgCl$_{2}$ and NiCl$_{2}$ are utilized to calculate the osmotic coefficient and the mean activity coefficient of these salts for a range of concentrations. The systems are modelled using the primitive model of electrolytes and analyzed using the symmetric Poisson-Boltzmann theory, the modified Poisson-Boltzmann theory, the mean spherical approximation, and the Monte Carlo simulations. Generally, the mean spherical approximation and the modified Poisson-Boltzmann theory reproduce the benchmark simulation data well up to $\sim $1.6 mol/dm$^{3}$ or more in many instances, while the symmetric Poisson-Boltzmann results show discrepancies starting from $\sim $0.25 mol/dm$^{3}$. Both the simulations and the theories tend to deviate from the corresponding experimental results beyond $\sim $1 mol/kg.

Title: Visualization of spin-splitter effect in altermagnets via non-equilibrium Green functions on a lattice
Authors: Karl Bergson Hallberg, Erik Wegner Hodt, Jacob Linder
Abstract: When a charge current is injected into an altermagnet along a suitable crystallographic direction, a transverse spin current can be generated. This so-called spin-splitter effect does not rely on spin-orbit coupling, and is thus distinct from the spin Hall effect. The spin-splitter effect was predicted by \textit{ab initio} calculations and has been experimentally confirmed. To utilize the spin-splitter effect for practical purposes in spintronic devices, it is important to understand (i) how the system parameters affect the transverse spin current, such as filling fraction, altermagnetic strength, interface parameters, spin-orbit interactions, and impurities and (ii) determine the properties of any associated spin accumulation, which is the measurable quantity. Here, we determine the answer to these questions and provide a real-space visualization of the spin flow and spin accumulation due to the spin-splitter effect. We utilize the non-equilibrium Keldysh Green function method on a 2D square lattice to this end. We find that the presence of edges induces oscillations in the spin accumulation and strongly modify the signal for small samples. At half-filling, the spin accumulation acquires an anomalous pattern and the spin-splitter effect vanishes. We prove analytically that this follows from a combined particle-hole and spin-reversal symmetry of the model used for the altermagnetic state. Increasing the altermagnetic strength leads to a larger spin accumulation, as expected. However, when adding Rashba spin-orbit interaction, providing an additional spin Hall signal, we find that the spin accumulation is not simply the sum of the spin Hall and spin-splitter contribution. Finally, we show that the spin-splitter effect is robust towards moderate impurity scattering with a potential of the same order as the hopping parameter, which facilitates its observation in real materials.

Title: Jahn-Teller Effect for Controlling Quantum Correlations in Hexanuclear Fe$^{3+}$ Magnets
Authors: Hamid Arian Zad, Michal Jaščur, Asad Ali, Saif Al-Kuwari, Saeed Haddadi
Abstract: We investigate the low-temperature magnetic and quantum properties of hexanuclear Fe$^ {3+}_6$ complexes under an external magnetic field. We primarily study the impact of competing exchange interactions and their asymmetries induced by the Jahn-Teller distortion on the quantum properties of the complexes. The inequality in exchange interactions lifts the ground-state degeneracy that gives rise to complex quantum behavior. By constructing the ground-state phase diagram and analyzing magnetization, we identify key magnetic phases and critical phenomena. We further quantify quantum correlations using tripartite entanglement negativity and conditional von Neumann entropy to unveil how the Jahn-Teller effect enhances intra-triangle entanglement while modulating inter-triangle correlations. Our findings highlight the Fe$^{3+}_6$ complex as a promising molecular platform for tunable quantum correlations, with potential applications in quantum information processing and molecular qubits.

Title: The crack pattern of indented cohesive granular media
Authors: Marie-Julie Dalbe, Pierre Jodlowski, Nicolas Vandenberghe
Abstract: Cohesive granular materials, like wet sand, retain their shape before yielding under stress. This solid-like behavior is associated with elasticity. As the loading increases, the material typically flows. However, cohesive materials can also develop cracks, similar to those observed in brittle materials. This study explores the formation of cracks during the indentation of a granular pile. A solid cylindrical indenter is pushed quasi-statically into the wet granular medium, causing radial cracks to appear. These cracks resemble mode I cracks observed in brittle solid materials. We characterize the crack pattern through direct observation and three-dimensional X-ray micro-tomography. Notably, we highlight the correlation between the dilation of the material during shearing and the appearance of cracks.

Title: Fastest first-passage time statistics for time-dependent particle injection
Authors: Denis S. Grebenkov, Ralf Metzler, Gleb Oshanin
Abstract: A common scenario in a variety of biological systems is that multiple particles are searching in parallel for an immobile target located in a bounded domain, and the fastest among them that arrives to the target first triggers a given desirable or detrimental process. The statistics of such extreme events -- the \textit{fastest\/} first-passage to the target -- is well-understood by now through a series of theoretical analyses, but exclusively under the assumption that all $N$ particles start \textit{simultaneously\/}, i.e., all are introduced into the domain instantly, by $\delta$-function-like pulses. However, in many practically important situations this is not the case: in order to start their search, the particles often have to enter first into a bounded domain, e.g., a cell or its nucleus, penetrating through gated channels or nuclear pores. This entrance process has a random duration so that the particles appear in the domain sequentially and with a time delay. Here we focus on the effect of such an extended-in-time injection of multiple particles on the fastest first-passage time (fFPT) and its statistics. We derive the full probability density function $H_N(t)$ of the fFPT with an arbitrary time-dependent injection intensity of $N$ particles. Under rather general assumptions on the survival probability of a single particle and on the injection intensity, we derive the large-$N$ asymptotic formula for the mean fFPT, which is quite different from that obtained for the instantaneous $\delta$-pulse injection. The extended injection is also shown to considerably slow down the convergence of $H_N(t)$ to the large-$N$ limit -- the Gumbel distribution -- so that the latter may be inapplicable in the most relevant settings with few tens to few thousands of particles.

Title: A Recipe for Flat Bands in Pyrochlore Materials: A Chemist's Perspective
Authors: Fatmagül Katmer, Milena Jovanovic, Jennifer Cano, Lukas Muechler, Leslie M. Schoop
Abstract: Materials in which atoms are arranged in a pyrochlore lattice have found renewed interest, as, at least theoretically, orbitals on those lattices can form flat bands. However, real materials often do not behave according to theoretical models, which is why there has been a dearth of pyrochlore materials exhibiting flat band physics. Here we examine the conditions under which ideal 'pyrochlore bands' can exist in real materials and how to have those close to the Fermi level. We find that the simple model used in the literature does not apply to the bands at the Fermi level in real pyrochlore materials. However, surprisingly, certain oxide compounds which have oxygen orbitals inside the pyrochlore tetrahedra do exhibit near-ideal pyrochlore bands near the Fermi level. We explain this observation by a generalized tight-binding model including the oxygen orbitals. We further classify all known pyrochlore materials based on their crystal structure, band structure, and chemical characteristics and propose materials to study in future experiments.

Title: On the constitutive behavior of linear viscoelastic solids under the plane stress condition
Authors: Bojan B. Guzina, Marc Bonnet
Abstract: Motivated by the recent experimental and analytical developments enabling high-fidelity material characterization of (heterogeneous) sheet-like solid specimens, we seek to elucidate the constitutive behavior of linear viscoelastic solids under the plane stress condition. More specifically, our goal is to expose the relationship between the plane-stress viscoelastic constitutive parameters and their (native) ``bulk'' counterparts. To facilitate the sought reduction of the three-dimensional (3D) constitutive behavior, we deploy the concept of projection operators and focus on the frequency-domain behavior by resorting to the Fourier transform and the mathematical framework of tempered distributions, which extends the Fourier analysis to functions (common in linear viscoelasticity) for which Fourier integrals are not convergent. In the analysis, our primary focus is the on class of linear viscoelastic solids whose 3D rheological behavior is described by a set of constant-coefficient ordinary differential equations, each corresponding to a generic arrangement of ``springs'' and ``dashpots''. On reducing the general formulation to the isotropic case, we proceed with an in-depth investigation of viscoelastic solids whose bulk and shear modulus each derive from a suite of classical ``spring and dashpot'' configurations. To enable faithful reconstruction of the 3D constitutive parameters of natural and engineered solids via (i) thin-sheet testing and (ii) applications of the error-in-constitutive-relation approach to the inversion of (kinematic) sensory data, we also examine the reduction of thermodynamic potentials describing linear viscoelasticity under the plane stress condition. The analysis is complemented by a set of analytical and numerical examples, illustrating the effect on the plane stress condition on the behavior of isotropic and anisotropic viscoelastic solids.

Title: AI-Driven Defect Engineering for Advanced Thermoelectric Materials
Authors: Chu-Liang Fu, Mouyang Cheng, Nguyen Tuan Hung, Eunbi Rha, Zhantao Chen, Ryotaro Okabe, Denisse Córdova Carrizales, Manasi Mandal, Yongqiang Cheng, Mingda Li
Abstract: Thermoelectric materials offer a promising pathway to directly convert waste heat to electricity. However, achieving high performance remains challenging due to intrinsic trade-offs between electrical conductivity, the Seebeck coefficient, and thermal conductivity, which are further complicated by the presence of defects. This review explores how artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are transforming thermoelectric materials design. Advanced ML approaches including deep neural networks, graph-based models, and transformer architectures, integrated with high-throughput simulations and growing databases, effectively capture structure-property relationships in a complex multiscale defect space and overcome the curse of dimensionality. This review discusses AI-enhanced defect engineering strategies such as composition optimization, entropy and dislocation engineering, and grain boundary design, along with emerging inverse design techniques for generating materials with targeted properties. Finally, it outlines future opportunities in novel physics mechanisms and sustainability, highlighting the critical role of AI in accelerating the discovery of thermoelectric materials.

Title: Theory for Lattice Relaxation in Marginal Twist Moirés
Authors: Christophe De Beule, Gayani N. Pallewela, Mohammed M. Al Ezzi, Liangtao Peng, E. J. Mele, Shaffique Adam
Abstract: Atomically thin moiré materials behave like elastic membranes where at very small twist angles, the van der Waals adhesion energy much exceeds the strain energy. In this ``marginal twist" regime, regions with low adhesion energy expand, covering most of the moiré unit cell, while all the unfavorable energy configurations shrink to form topological defects linked by a periodic network of domain walls. We find analytical expressions that successfully capture this strong-coupling regime for both the triangular soliton network and the honeycomb soliton network matching predictions from LAMMPS molecular dynamics simulations, and numerical solutions of continuum elasticity theory. There is an emergent universality where the theory is characterized by a single twist-angle dependent parameter. Our formalism is essential to understand experiments on a wide-range of materials of current interest including twisted bilayer graphene, both parallel and antiparallel stacked tWSe2 and tMoTe2, and any other twisted homobilayer with the same stacking symmetry.

Title: A Matrix Quantum Kinetic Treatment of Impact Ionization in Avalanche Photodiodes
Authors: Sheikh Z. Ahmed, Shafat Shahnewaz, Samiran Ganguly, Joe C Campbell, Avik W. Ghosh
Abstract: Matrix based quantum kinetic simulations have been widely used for the predictive modeling of electronic devices. Inelastic scattering from phonons and electrons are typically treated as higher order processes in these treatments, captured using mean-field approximations. Carrier multiplication in Avalanche Photodiodes (APDs), however, relies entirely on strongly inelastic impact ionization, making electron-electron scattering the dominant term requiring a rigorous, microscopic treatment. We go well beyond the conventional Born approximation for scattering to develop a matrix-based quantum kinetic theory for impact ionization, involving products of multiple Green's functions. Using a model semiconductor in a reverse-biased p-i-n configuration, we show how its calculated non-equilibrium charge distributions show multiplication at dead-space values consistent with energy-momentum conservation. Our matrix approach can be readily generalized to more sophisticated atomistic Hamiltonians, setting the stage for a fully predictive, `first principles' theory of APDs.

Title: Life at the Boundary of Chemical Kinetics and Program Execution
Authors: Thomas Fischbacher
Abstract: This work introduces a generic quantitative framework for studying dynamical processes that involve interactions of polymer sequences. Possible applications range from quantitative studies of the reaction kinetics of polymerization processes to explorations of the behavior of chemical implementations of computational -- including basic life-like -- processes. This way, we establish a bridge between thermodynamic and computational aspects of systems that are defined in terms of sequence interactions. As by-products of these investigations, we clarify some common confusion around the notion of ``autocatalysis'' and show quantitatively how a chemically implemented Turing machine can operate close to the Landauer bound. Using a Markov process model of polymer sequence composition and dynamical evolution of the Markov process's parameters via an ordinary differential equation (ODE) that arises when taking the double ``chemical'' many-particle limit as well as ``rarefied interactions'' limit, this approach enables -- for example -- accurate quantitative explorations of entropy generation in systems where computation is driven by relaxation to thermodynamic equilibrium. The computational framework internally utilizes the Scheme programming language's intrinsic continuation mechanisms to provide nondeterministic evaluation primitives that allow the user to specify example systems in straight purely functional code, making exploration of all possible relevant sequence composition constellations -- which would be otherwise tedious to write code for -- automatic and hidden from the user. A collection of fully worked out examples elucidate how this modeling approach is quantitatively related to both exact and approximate analytic approaches. These examples can also serve as starting points for further explorations.

Title: Direct evidence and atomic-scale mechanisms of reduced dislocation mobility in an inorganic semiconductor under illumination
Authors: Mingqiang Li, Kun Luo, Xiumei Ma, Boran Kumral, Peng Gao, Tobin Filleter, Qi An, Yu Zou
Abstract: Photo-plasticity in semiconductors, wherein their mechanical properties such as strength, hardness and ductility are influenced by light exposure, has been reported for several decades. Although such phenomena have drawn significant attention for the manufacturability and usage of deformable semiconductor devices, their underlying mechanisms are not well understood due to the lack of direct evidence. Here we provide experimental observation and atomic insights into the reduced mobility of dislocations in zinc sulfide, as a model material, under light. Using photo-nanoindentation and transmission electron microscopy, we observe that dislocations glide shorter distances under light than those in darkness and there are no apparent deformation twins in both conditions. By atomic-scale simulations, we demonstrate that the decreased dislocation mobility is attributed to the increased Peierls stress for dislocation motion and enhanced stress fields around dislocation cores due to photoexcitation. This study improves the understanding of photo-plastic effects in inorganic semiconductors, offering the opportunities for modulating their mechanical properties using light.

Title: Lorenz ratios of diagonal and Hall conductivities in a Dirac electron liquid
Authors: Alex Levchenko
Abstract: The magnetotransport properties of a two-dimensional electron liquid in graphene are analyzed in the hydrodynamic limit under isothermal conditions. It is shown that the Wiedemann-Franz law does not hold in this regime and that the Lorenz ratios constructed from the diagonal and Hall conductivities generally differ from each other. The breakdown of the Wiedemann-Franz law is most pronounced near charge neutrality, where the Lorenz ratio can exceed its nominal universal Sommerfeld value by an order of magnitude. The corresponding Lorenz ratios exhibit a nonmonotonic dependence on the magnetic field, which is caused by emergent magnetic friction arising in liquids lacking Galilean invariance and possessing finite intrinsic conductivity.

Title: Lithium-ion dynamics in synthetic quartz studied via the NMR of implanted $^{8}$Li$^{+}$
Authors: W. Andrew MacFarlane, Ryan M. L. McFadden, Signy Spencer, Aris Chatzichristos, John O. Ticknor, David L. Cortie, Martin H. Dehn, Sarah R. Dunsiger, Derek Fujimoto, Z. H. Jang, Victoria L. Karner, Robert F. Kiefl, Gerald D. Morris, Monika Stachura
Abstract: We report $\beta$-detected nuclear magnetic resonance ($\beta$-NMR) measurements of implanted $^{8}$Li$^{+}$ in a synthetic single crystal of $\alpha$-SiO$_2$ (quartz). At 6.55 Tesla, the spectrum is comprised of a large amplitude broad resonance and a quadrupolar multiplet that is only revealed by an RF comb excitation. The quadrupole splitting is surprisingly small, increases with temperature, and provides information on the implantation site. Supercell density functional theory calculations show that the small EFG is consistent with an in-channel interstitial site (Wyckoff 3$a$). The spin-lattice relaxation is unexpectedly fast and strongly temperature dependent with a diffusive peak above 200 K and a second more prominent relaxation peak at lower temperature. Analysis of the diffusive relaxation yields an activation barrier 178(43) meV for the isolated Li$^{+}$, in the range of other measurements and calculations. To account for many of the other features of the data, it is suggested that some of the implanted ions trap an electron forming the neutral Li$^{0}$, which is stable over a narrow range of temperatures.

Title: Small-Mass Asymptotics of Massive Point Vortex Dynamics in Bose--Einstein Condensates
Authors: Tomoki Ohsawa, Andrea Richaud
Abstract: We perform an asymptotic analysis of the massive point vortex dynamics in Bose--Einstein condensates in the small-mass limit $\varepsilon \to 0$. We show that the orthogonal projection of the massive dynamics to a certain subspace $\mathcal{K}$ (called kinematic subspace) in the phase space yields the standard massless vortex dynamics or the Kirchhoff equations. We show that the massless dynamics is the zeroth-order approximation to the massive equation as $\varepsilon \to 0$, and also derive a first-order correction to the zeroth-order massless dynamics. The massive dynamics near $\mathcal{K}$ is well approximated by the corresponding massless dynamics. In fact, our main result proves that the massive dynamics starting in $\mathcal{K}$ stays $O(\varepsilon)$-close to $\mathcal{K}$ for short time. On the other hand, the massive dynamics starting outside $\mathcal{K}$ exhibits an oscillatory initial layer due to its inertia and deviates significantly from the massless dynamics. We also perform an asymptotic analysis with a rescaled time to derive the inner approximation to capture the initial layer. The 0th-order inner equations are exactly solvable, and the 1st-order inner equations can be solved by quadrature. The combined inner approximation captures the initial oscillatory layer of the massive dynamics.

Title: Symmetry-Constrained Anomalous Transport in the Altermagnetic Material CuX$_2$ (X=F,Cl)
Authors: Zhengxuan Wang, Ruqian Wu, Chunlan Ma, Shijing Gong, Shuaikang Zhang, Guangtao Wang, Tianxing Wang, Yipeng An
Abstract: Recently discovered, altermagnetism represents a third class of collinear magnets. These materials exhibit zero net magnetization, similar to antiferromagnets, but display anomalous transport properties resembling those of ferromagnets. Altermagnetic materials manifest various anomalous electronic transport phenomena, including the anomalous Hall effect, anomalous Nernst effect, and anomalous thermal Hall effect. Additionally, they exhibit magneto-optical Kerr and Faraday effects, previously considered exclusive to ferromagnetic materials. These anomalous transport phenomena are constrained by symmetry, as revealed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. However, an effective model-based approach to verify these symmetry constraints remains unavailable. In this Letter, we construct a $k\cdot p$ model for $d$-wave altermagnets CuX$_2$ (X=F,Cl) using spin space group representations and apply it to calculate the anomalous Hall effect. The symmetry-imposed transport properties predicted by the model are in agreement with the DFT results, providing a foundation for further investigation into symmetry-restricted transport phenomena in altermagnetic materials.

Title: Limited-angle x-ray nano-tomography with machine-learning enabled iterative reconstruction engine
Authors: Chonghang Zhao, Mingyuan Ge, Xiaogang Yang, Yong S. Chu, Hanfei Yan
Abstract: A long-standing challenge in tomography is the 'missing wedge' problem, which arises when the acquisition of projection images within a certain angular range is restricted due to geometrical constraints. This incomplete dataset results in significant artifacts and poor resolution in the reconstructed image. To tackle this challenge, we propose an approach dubbed Perception Fused Iterative Tomography Reconstruction Engine, which integrates a convolutional neural network (CNN) with perceptional knowledge as a smart regularizer into an iterative solving engine. We employ the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers to optimize the solution in both physics and image domains, thereby achieving a physically coherent and visually enhanced result. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach using various experimental datasets obtained with different x-ray microscopy techniques. All show significantly improved reconstruction even with a missing wedge of over 100 degrees - a scenario where conventional methods fail. Notably, it also improves the reconstruction in case of sparse projections, despite the network not being specifically trained for that. This demonstrates the robustness and generality of our method of addressing commonly occurring challenges in 3D x-ray imaging applications for real-world problems.

Title: Dynamics of one-dimensional spin models via complex-time evolution of tensor networks
Authors: Jeong Hyeok Cha, Hyun-Yong Lee, Heung-Sik Kim
Abstract: Studying the real-time dynamics of strongly correlated systems poses significant challenges, which have recently become more manageable thanks to advances in density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) and tensor network methods. A notable development in this area is the introduction of a complex-time evolution scheme for tensor network states, originally suggested for solving Anderson impurity model and designed to suppress the growth of entanglement under time evolution. In this study, we employ the complex-time evolution scheme to investigate the dynamics of one-dimensional spin systems, specifically the transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) and the XXZ model. Our analysis revisits the dynamic critical exponent $z$ of the TFIM and explores the dynamical structure factor in both gapped and gapless states of the XXZ model. Importantly, the complex-time evolution reproduces the results of real-time evolution while mitigating the rapid growth of quantum entanglement typically associated with the latter. These results demonstrate that the combination of complex-time evolution and extrapolation provides a robust and efficient framework for studying the dynamics of complex quantum systems, enabling more comprehensive insights into their behavior.

Title: Relevance of spatial quenched disorder in the Diffusive Epidemic Process
Authors: Valentin Anfray, Hong-Yan Shih
Abstract: The diffusive epidemic process is an example of reaction-diffusion system where diffusion constants of healthy and infected particles determine the universality class of the absorbing phase transition. Introducing spatial quenched disorder in the contamination rates and the diffusion rates of each species leads to a rich phase diagram depending on the disorder distribution. Particularly, signature of different infinite disorder fixed points and lack of active phase are reported. The relevance of disorder is correctly predicted by the Harris criterion in light of the effective macroscopic diffusion rates. However, the effective disorder strength depends on which diffusion rate heterogeneities are introduced.

Title: Ultralow-pressure mechanical-motion switching of ferroelectric polarization
Authors: Baoyu Wang, Xin He, Jianjun Luo, Yitong Chen, Zhixiang Zhang, Ding Wang, Shangui Lan, Peijian Wang, Xun Han, Yuda Zhao, Zheng Li, Huan Hu, Yang Xu, Zhengdong Luo, Weijin Hu, Bowen Zhu, Jian Sun, Yan Liu, Genquan Han, Xixiang Zhang, Bin Yu, Kai Chang, Fei Xue
Abstract: Ferroelectric polarization switching, achieved by mechanical forces, enables the storage of stress information in ferroelectrics, and holds promise for human-interfacing applications. The prevailing mechanical approach is locally induced flexoelectricity with large strain gradients. However, this approach usually requires huge mechanical pressures, which greatly impedes device applications. Here, we report an approach of using triboelectric effect to mechanically, reversibly switch ferroelectric polarization across {\alpha}-In2Se3 ferroelectric memristors. Through contact electrification and electrostatic induction effects, triboelectric units are used to sensitively detect mechanical forces and generate electrical voltage pulses to trigger {\alpha}-In2Se3 resistance switching. We realize multilevel resistance states under different mechanical forces, by which a neuromorphic stress system is demonstrated. Strikingly, we achieve the reversal of {\alpha}-In2Se3 ferroelectric polarization with a record-low mechanical pressure of ~ 10 kPa, and even with tactile touches. Our work provides a fundamental but pragmatic strategy for creating mechanical-tactile ferroelectric memory devices.

Abstract: Quantum geometry is a well-established framework for understanding transport and optical responses in quantum materials. In this work, I study the photon drag effect in Dirac electrons using the quantum geometric interpretation of non-vertical optical transitions. Due to the particle-hole symmetry inherent in Dirac electrons, the shift photon-drag photocurrent is dominated by dissipationless Fermi surface contributions, connected to the dipole of quantum metric tensor. I find that this dipole is significantly enhanced by a small band gap in massive Dirac electrons and remains robust in the massless limit. I demonstrate the existence of a circular shift photon-drag current in the effective Hamiltonian at the L-point of bismuth, where the bands exhibit trivial topology, highlighting the ubiquity of the circular photon-drag effect in centrosymmetric materials.

Title: Realizing a topological diode effect on the surface of a topological Kondo insulator
Authors: Jiawen Zhang, Zhenqi Hua, Chengwei Wang, Michael Smidman, David Graf, Sean Thomas, Priscila F. S. Rosa, Steffen Wirth, Xi Dai, Peng Xiong, Huiqiu Yuan, Xiaoyu Wang, Lin Jiao
Abstract: Introducing the concept of topology into material science has sparked a revolution from classic electronic and optoelectronic devices to topological quantum devices. The latter has potential for transferring energy and information with unprecedented efficiency. Here, we demonstrate a topological diode effect on the surface of a three-dimensional material, SmB6, a candidate topological Kondo insulator. The diode effect is evidenced by pronounced rectification and photogalvanic effects under electromagnetic modulation and radiation at radio frequency. Our experimental results and modeling suggest that these prominent effects are intimately tied to the spatially inhomogeneous formation of topological surface states (TSS) at the intermediate temperature. This work provides a manner of breaking the mirror symmetry (in addition to the inversion symmetry), resulting in the formation of pn-junctions between puddles of metallic TSS. This effect paves the way for efficient current rectifiers or energy-harvesting devices working down to radio frequency range at low temperature, which could be extended to high temperatures using other topological insulators with large bulk gap.

Title: Screening effect of a magnetically soft shell of single-domain ferromagnetic nanoparticles
Authors: Vladimir P. Savin, Yury A. Koksharov
Abstract: The possible manifestations of magnetic screening effects were theoretically investigated for a particle with a ferromagnetic single-domain core and a magnetically soft shell. The exact solution of the Laplace equation gave analytical formulas for the magnetic field created by the particle placed in a uniform external magnetic field. The system of non-interacting randomly oriented particles was investigated in the Langevin model. The effects of the shell on individual and thermodynamically averaged magnetic properties of the particles were described in a single way using the screening factor A. The screening effects are appeared in a decrease in: (i) the demagnetization factor of the particle core; (ii) the total dipole moment and, accordingly, the external magnetic field created by the particle; (iii) the effective magnetic moment in isothermal magnetization curves and in the Curie law. The magnetically soft shell of the particle also changes the behavior of the particle system in high magnetic fields: the magnetization does not reach saturation, and the differential magnetic susceptibility tends to a non-zero value.

Title: Four-terminal Josephson junctions: diode effects, anomalous currents and transverse currents
Authors: Bijay Kumar Sahoo, Abhiram Soori
Abstract: We propose a multi-terminal Josephson junction consisting of a central spin-orbit-coupled region with an in-plane Zeeman field connected to four superconducting terminals. This setup allows for the simultaneous measurement of both longitudinal and transverse Josephson currents in response to a phase bias and provides a platform to probe the planar Hall effect in superconducting transport. We find that the system exhibits the anomalous Josephson effect (AJE) and the Josephson diode effect (JDE) when the symmetry between opposite momentum modes is broken. Specifically, breaking the symmetry between $k_x$ and $-k_x$ results in JDE and AJE in the longitudinal Josephson current, while breaking the symmetry between $k_y$ and $-k_y$ leads to a finite transverse Josephson current that also exhibits JDE and AJE. Furthermore, for specific parameter choices, the current-phase relation in the transverse direction supports unidirectional transport, highlighting its potential for superconducting circuit applications. Our setup offers a new route to engineering nonreciprocal superconducting transport.

Title: Rapid Vapor-Assisted Solution Process of Metal-Organic Chalcogenides for High-Performance Light-Emitting Diodes
Authors: Sang-Hyun Chin, Daseul Lee, Donggyu Lee, Kwanghyun Chung, Eunjong Yoo, Tong-Il Kim, Su Hwan Lee, Sang Woo Bae, Young-Hoon Kim, Yeonjin Yi
Abstract: Metal-organic chalcogenides (MOCs), robust crystalline assemblies composed of coinage metals, chalcogens and organic ligands, are typically synthesized via prolonged, high temperature tarnishing of vacuum-deposited metal films with organochalcogen precursors. The prolonged exposure to high temperatures and the necessity for direct vacuum deposition of silver can induce damage to the underlying films, posing significant challenges to the fabrication of optoelectronic devices, despite their cost-effectiveness and chemical robustness. This study introduces vapor-assisted solution processing, a novel chemical vapor deposition method, enabling remarkably rapid fabrication of luminescent MOC films. Furthermore, the first MOC-based light-emitting diodes (MOCLEDs) are realized, achieving an external quantum efficiency (EQE) approaching 0.1% and electroluminescence peaking at 633 nm. These results highlight the potential of MOCs as next-generation emitters for displays and solid-state lighting. This work offers a promising fabrication strategy and insights for advancing MOCLEDs and expanding their optoelectronic potential.

Title: Interplay of canted antiferromagnetism and nematic order in Mott insulating Sr2Ir1-xRhxO4
Authors: Hyeokjun Heo, Jeongha An, Junyoung Kwon, Kwangrae Kim, Youngoh Son, B. J. Kim, Joonho Jang
Abstract: Sr2IrO4 is one of the prime candidates for realizing exotic quantum spin orders owing to the subtle combination of spin-orbit coupling and electron correlation. Sensitive local magnetization measurement can serve as a powerful tool to study these kinds of systems with multiple competing spin orders since the comprehensive study of the spatially-varying magnetic responses provide crucial information of their energetics. Here, using sensitive magneto-optical Kerr effect measurements and spin Hamiltonian model calculations, we show that Sr2IrO4 has non-trivial domain structures which cannot be understood by conventional antiferromagnetism. This unconventional magnetic response exhibits broken symmetry along the Ir-O-Ir bond direction and is enhanced upon spin-flip transition or Rh-doping. Our analysis, based on possible stacking patterns of spins, shows that introduction of an additional rotational-symmetry breaking is essential to describe the magnetic behavior of Sr2Ir1-xRhxO4, providing strong evidence for a nematic hidden order phase in this highly correlated spin-orbit Mott insulator.

Title: Robust spin-qubit control in a natural Si-MOS quantum dot using phase modulation

Abstract: Silicon quantum dots are one of the most promising candidates for practical quantum computers because of their scalability and compatibility with the well-established complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technology. However, the coherence time is limited in industry-standard natural silicon because of the $^{29}$Si isotopes, which have non-zero nuclear spin. Here, we protect an isotopically natural silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor (Si-MOS) quantum dot spin qubit from environmental noise via electron spin resonance with a phase-modulated microwave (MW) drive. This concatenated continuous drive (CCD) method extends the decay time of Rabi oscillations from 1.2 $\mathrm{\mu s}$ to over 200 $\mathrm{\mu s}$. Furthermore, we define a protected qubit basis and propose robust gate operations. We find the coherence time measured by Ramsey sequence is improved from 143 ns to 40.7 $\mu$s compared to that of the bare spin qubit. The single qubit gate fidelity measured with randomized benchmarking is improved from 95% to 99%, underscoring the effectiveness of the CCD method. The method shows promise for improving control fidelity of noisy qubits, overcoming the qubit variability for global control, and maintaining qubit coherence while idling.

Title: Advancing atom probe tomography capabilities to understand bone microstructures at the near-atomic scale
Authors: Tim M. Schwarz, Maïtena Dumont, Victoria Garcia-Giner, Chanwon Jung, Alexandra E. Porter, Baptiste Gault
Abstract: Bone structure is generally hierarchically organized into organic (collagen, proteins,...), inorganic (hydroxyapatite (HAP)) components. However, many fundamental mechanisms of the biomineralization processes such as HAP formation, the influence of trace elements, the mineral-collagen arrangement, etc., are not clearly understood. This is partly due to the analytical challenge of simultaneously characterizing the three-dimensional (3D) structure and chemical composition of biominerals in general at the nanometer scale, which can, in principle be achieved by atom probe tomography (APT). Yet, the hierarchical structures of bone represent a critical hurdle for APT analysis in terms of sample yield and analytical resolution, particularly for trace elements, and organic components from the collagen appear to systematically get lost from the analysis. Here, we applied in-situ metallic coating of APT specimens within the focused ion beam (FIB) used for preparing specimens, and demonstrate that the sample yield and chemical sensitivity are tremendously improved, allowing the analysis of individual collagen fibrils and trace elements such as Mg and Na. We explored a range of measurement parameters with and without coating, in terms of analytical resolution performance and determined the best practice parameters for analyzing bone samples in APT. To decipher the complex mass spectra of the bone specimens, reference spectra from pure HAP and collagen were acquired to unambiguously identify the signals, allowing us to analyze entire collagen fibrils and interfaces at the near-atomic scale. Our results open new possibilities for understanding the hierarchical structure and chemical heterogeneity of bone structures at the near-atomic level and demonstrate the potential of this new method to provide new, unexplored insights into biomineralization processes in the future.

Title: Dramatic reduction in thermal conductivity by high-density dislocations in SrTiO3
Authors: Jinxue Ding, Jiawen Zhang, Jinfeng Dong, Kimitaka Higuchi, Atsutomo Nakamura, Wenjun Lu, Bo Sun, Xufei Fang
Abstract: Decreasing thermal conductivity is important for designing efficient thermoelectric devices. Traditional engineering strategies have focused on point defects and interface design. Recently, dislocations as line defects have emerged as a new tool for regulating thermal conductivity. In ceramics-based thermoelectric materials, the key challenge lies in achieving sufficiently high-density dislocations to effectively scatter phonons, as the typical dislocation density in ceramics after bulk deformation is constrained to 10 to the power of 12 per square meter. In this work, we adopted the mechanical imprinting method and achieved a dislocation density of 10 to the power of 15 per square meter in single-crystal SrTiO3, which is known for its room-temperature plasticity and acts as a promising material for thermoelectric applications. Using the time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR) method, we measured about a 50% reduction in thermal conductivity over a broad temperature range (80 to 400 K) with the engineered high-density dislocations. These results suggest that tuning dislocations could offer a new path to minimizing thermal conductivity for engineering thermoelectric materials.

Title: Floquet-Nambu Theory of Electron Quantum Optics with Superconductors
Authors: Pablo Burset, Benjamin Roussel, Michael Moskalets, Christian Flindt
Abstract: We present a comprehensive Floquet-Nambu theory to describe the time-dependent quantum transport in mesoscopic circuits involving superconductors. The central object of our framework is the first-order correlation function, which accounts for the excitations that are generated by a time-dependent voltage and their coherent scattering off the interface with a superconductor. We analyze the time-dependent current generated by periodic voltage pulses and how it depends on the excitation energies of the voltage drive compared to the gap of the superconductor. Our formalism allows us to identify the conditions for the excitations that are scattered off the superconductor to become coherent electron-hole superpositions. To this end, we consider the purity of the outgoing states, which characterizes their ability to carry quantum information. Our framework paves the way for systematic investigations of time-dependent scattering problems involving superconductivity, and it may help interpret future experiments in electron quantum optics with superconductors.

Title: Persistent exclusion process with time-periodic drive
Authors: Deepsikha Das, Sakuntala Chatterjee
Abstract: We study a persistent exclusion process with time-periodic external potential on a 1d periodic lattice through numerical simulations. A set of run-and-tumble particles move on a lattice of length $L$ and tumbling probability $\gamma \ll 1$ and interact among each other via hardcore exclusion. The effect of the external potential has been modeled as a special site where the tumbling probability is $1$. We call it a "defect" site and move its location along the ring lattice with speed $u$. In the case of $\gamma=0$ the system goes to a jammed state when there is no defect. But introduction of the moving defect creates a strongly phase-separated state where almost all active particles are present in a single large cluster, for small and moderate $u$. This striking effect is caused by the long-range velocity correlation of the active particles, induced by the moving defect. For large $u$, a single large cluster is no longer stable and breaks into multiple smaller clusters. For nonzero $\gamma$ a competition develops between the timescales associated with tumbling and defect motion. While the moving defect attempts to create long-range velocity order, bulk tumbling tends to randomize the velocity alignment. If $\gamma$ is comparable to $u/L$, then a relatively small number of tumbles take place during the time the moving defect travels through the entire system. In this case, the defect has enough time to restore the order in the system and our simulations show that the long-range order in velocity and density survive for $\gamma$ values in this range. As $\gamma$ increases further, long range order is destroyed and the system develops multiple regions of high and low density. We characterize the density inhomogeneity in this case by measuring subsystem density fluctuations and present a heatmap in the $\gamma$-$u$ plane showing the regions with most pronounced density inhomogeneities.

Title: Evidence of spin-phonon-charge coupling in quasi-one-dimensional Ising spin chain system $α$-CoV$_2$O$_6$
Authors: Debismita Naik, Souvick Chakraborty, Akriti Singh, Ayan Mondal, Surajit Saha, Venkataramanan Mahalingam, Satyabrata Raj, Pradip Khatua
Abstract: The quasi-one-dimensional Ising spin chain system $\alpha$-CoV$_2$O$_6$ is considered to exhibit fascinating magnetic properties at lower temperatures. We comprehensively study magnetic properties and lattice dynamics using a combination of x-ray diffraction (XRD), DC magnetization, specific heat, temperature-dependent XRD and Raman scattering measurements, along with the theoretical charge density map calculations. The DC magnetization and specific heat confirm the antiferromagnetic (AFM) long-range order (LRO) at Neel temperature T$_N$ = 15 K as well as the short-range ordering (SRO) below 100 K. Temperature-dependent Raman measurement has been performed in the temperature range of 5 K to 180 K, revealing spin-phonon coupling (SPC) below 100 K, which is well above the T$_N$ and is attributed to SRO. The SPC is calculated for different vibrational modes. The temperature-dependent XRD supports the key finding of magnetoelastic coupling at T$_N$, which is strongly correlated to the magnetoelectric phenomena. The renormalization of Raman modes and lattice anomalies near T$_N$ illustrate spin-lattice coupling via magnetoelastic and spin-phonon interactions leading to the interplay between spin, charge, and phonon degrees of freedom in $\alpha$-CoV$_2$O$_6$. The presence of spin-charge coupling is confirmed by the theoretical charge density maps, which show that the formation of electric dipoles between the Co and O atoms in the AFM state results from the p-d hybridization.

Title: Observation of giant remnant polarization in ultrathin AlScN at cryogenic temperatures
Authors: Seunguk Song, Dhiren K. Pradhan, Zekun Hu, Yinuo Zhang, Rachael N. Keneipp, Michael A. Susner, Pijush Bhattacharya, Marija Drndić, Roy H. Olsson III, Deep Jariwala
Abstract: The discovery of wurtzite ferroelectrics opens new frontiers in polar materials, yet their behavior at cryogenic temperatures remains unexplored. Here, we reveal unprecedented ferroelectric properties in ultrathin (10 nm) Al$_{0.68}$Sc$_{0.32}$N (AlScN) at cryogenic temperatures where the properties are fundamentally distinct from those of conventional oxide ferroelectrics. At 12 K, we demonstrate a giant remnant polarization exceeding 250 $\mu$C/cm$^2$ -- more than twice that of any known ferroelectric -- driven by an enhanced c/a ratio in the wurtzite structure. Our devices sustain remarkably high electric fields (~13 MV/cm) while maintaining reliable switching, achieving over 104 polarization reversal cycles at 12 K. Critically, this breakdown field strength approaches that of passive dielectric materials while maintaining ferroelectric functionality. The extraordinary polarization enhancement and high-field stability at cryogenic temperatures contrasts sharply with oxide ferroelectrics, establishing wurtzite ferroelectrics as a distinct class of polar materials with implications spanning fundamental physics to cryogenic non-volatile memory and quantum technologies.

Title: Rubber Wear: History, Mechanisms, and Perspectives
Authors: R. Xu, W. Sheng, F. Zhou, B. N. J. Persson
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive review of wear mechanisms, with a primary focus on rubber wear under sliding conditions. Beginning with classical wear theories, including the Archard and Rabinowicz models, we analyze their applicability to both metals and elastomers and discuss extensions relevant to elastic contact and multiscale surface roughness. Various experimental studies on rubber, such as abrasion by sharp tools, erosion by particle impact, and wear during sliding on rough substrates, are reviewed and interpreted. The effects of environmental factors, such as oxygen and lubrication, are also discussed. In addition, we review a recently proposed wear model based on fatigue crack growth within asperity contact regions, which accounts for energy dissipation and multiscale interactions. This model explains the wide variability in the wear coefficient and predicts wear rates consistent with experimental observations across a broad range of conditions. It also explains the formation mechanism and provides the size distribution of rubber wear particles, from micrometer-scale up to severe cut-chip-chunk (CCC) wear. The results have implications for tire wear and the environmental impact of microscale wear debris (microplastics).

Title: On Tailoring Structural and Optoelectronic Properties of TiO2 Thin Films Synthesized via 'Room' Temperature High Power Impulse Magnetron Sputtering (HiPIMS)
Authors: Aarati Chacko, Erwin Hack, Sebastian Lohde, Robin Bucher, Oguz Yildirim, Arnold Mueller, Michel Calame, Hans J. Hug, Mirjana Dimitrievska
Abstract: Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is a wide-bandgap semiconductor that has gained increased attention as a cutting-edge material for application in the environmental, energy and biomedical fields. Here we employed High Power Impulse Magnetron Sputtering (HiPIMS) to synthesize TiO2 thin films at 'room' temperature (without additional substrate heating), and over a wide range of deposition parameters involving changes in the chamber pressure and relative abundance of oxygen during film growth. This allowed us to tune both the crystal quality and the anatase to rutile polymorph composition; thus tailoring structural, optical and electronic properties of the overall TiO2 thin films. Control over the properties of TiO2 films, as demonstrated here at low temperatures, without adjunct heating, is particularly important when employing temperature-sensitive substrates often encountered in next-generation applications and devices.

Title: Spin models from nonlinear cellular automata
Authors: Konstantinos Sfairopoulos, Luke Causer, Jamie F. Mair, Stephen Powell, Juan P. Garrahan
Abstract: We extend the study of 1D elementary cellular automata (CA) to the nonlinear rules, following our study of the linear rules in Ref.[arXiv:2309.08059]. We thus construct the respective classical spin models and obtain their zero temperature ground states. We argue that these models are examples of frustrated systems where their ground state space can be exactly and systematically calculated. By including quantum fluctuations through the addition of a transverse field, we study their ground state quantum phases and phase transitions. We use rules 30, 54 and 201 as a probe of our two main results: (a) for small transverse fields we identify an order-by-disorder mechanism which stabilizes the classical phase, and (ii) we observe a first-order quantum phase transition between the classical and quantum paramagnetic phases when the transverse field strength equals the classical coupling strength, as for the linear rules.

Title: Subleading-order theory for condensation transitions in large deviations of sums of independent and identically distributed random variables
Authors: Naftali R. Smith
Abstract: We study the full distribution $P_{N}\left(A\right)$ of sums $A = \sum_{i=1}^N$ where $x_1, \dots, x_N$ are $N \gg 1$ independent and identically distributed random variables each sampled from a given distribution $p(x)$ with a subexponential $x \to \infty$ tail. We consider two particular cases: (I) the one-sided stretched exponential distribution $p(x) \propto e^{-x^\alpha}$ where $0 < x < \infty$, (II) the two-sided stretched exponential distribution $p(x) \propto e^{-|x|^\alpha}$ where $-\infty < x < \infty$. We assume $0 < \alpha < 1$ (in both cases). As follows immediately from known theorems, for both cases (i) typical fluctuations of $\Delta A = A - \left\langle A\right\rangle $ are described by the central-limit theorem, (ii) the tail $A \to \infty$ is described by the big-jump principle $P_{N}\left(A\right) \simeq N p\left(A\right)$, and (iii) in between these two regimes there is a nontrivial intermediate regime which displays anomalous scaling $P_{N}\left(A\right) \sim e^{-N^\beta f(\Delta A/N^\gamma)}$ with anomalous exponents $\beta,\gamma \in (0,1)$ and large-deviation function $f(y)$ that are all exactly known. In practice, although these theoretical predictions of $P_{N}\left(A\right)$ work very well in regimes (i) and (ii), they often perform quite poorly in the intermediate regime (ii), with errors of several orders of magnitude for $N$ as large as $10^4$. We calculate subleading order corrections to the theoretical predictions in the intermediate regime. We find that for $0 < \alpha < \alpha_c$, these corrections scale as power laws in $N$, while for $\alpha_c < \alpha < 1$ they scale as stretched exponentials, where the threshold value is $\alpha_c = 1/2$ in case (I) and $\alpha_c = 2/3$ in case (II). This difference between the two cases is a result of the mirror symmetry $p(x) = p(-x)$ which holds only in the latter case.

Title: Bleaching of the Terahertz Magneto-Photogalvanic Effect in CdHgTe Crystals with Kane Fermions
Authors: M. D. Moldavskaya, L. E. Golub, V. V. Bel'kov, N. N. Mikhailov, S. A. Dvoretsky, D. Weiss, S. D. Ganichev
Abstract: We report the observation and comprehensive study of the complex nonlinear intensity dependence of the magneto-photogalvanic effect (MPGE) current induced by terahertz (THz) radiation in Cd$_{x}$Hg$_{1-x}$Te films with inverted ($x = 0.15$) and noninverted ($x = 0.22$) band structures. The nonlinearities are studied for the resonant MPGE caused by cyclotron resonance, interband transitions between Landau levels, and ionization impurities, as well as for nonresonant indirect Drude-like optical transitions. We show that all these processes lead to the saturation of the photocurrent caused by absorption bleaching. We develop a theoretical framework for each mechanism, which describes measured nonlinearities over an intensity range from 10$^{-3}$ to $4\times10^{4}$ W/cm$^2$. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the saturation processes for these absorption channels differ significantly, allowing us to analyze them independently by considering different intensity regimes. The observed nonlinearities enable us to determine the energy relaxation times of Kane fermions excited by CR and interband optical transitions.

Title: Floquet control of topological phases and Hall effects in Z2 nodal line semimetals
Authors: Pu Liu, Chaoxi Cui, Lei Li, Runze Li, Dong-Hui Xu, Zhi-Ming Yu
Abstract: Dynamic control of topological properties in materials is central to modern condensed matter physics, and Floquet engineering, utilizing periodic light fields, provides a promising avenue. Here, we use Floquet theory to theoretically study the topological response of a Z2 nodal line semimetal (NLSM) when driven by circularly polarized light (CPL). We demonstrate that the direction of CPL irradiation critically dictates the resulting topological phase transitions. Specifically, when light is incident perpendicular to the nodal line plane, increasing the light amplitude induces two successive topological phase transitions: first, from the Z2 NLSM to a vortex NLSM, a rare and intriguing topological state; and second, a transition from the vortex NLSM to a semimetal with a pair of Weyl points (WPs). In stark contrast, irradiation along other directions directly transforms the Z2 nodal line into a pair of WPs. We further investigate the transport properties of the Floquet Z2 NLSM, focusing on the anomalous and planar Hall effects. The anomalous Hall effect exhibits a direction-dependent amplitude variation, deviating from conventional two-band NLSM behavior. Importantly, we reveal a significant and tunable planar Hall effect, a phenomenon largely unexplored in Floquet topological materials, which is highly sensitive to both light amplitude and direction. Our findings not only present a novel route to realize the vortex NLSM, but also establish an efficient way to control Hall transport phenomena in Z2 NLSMs.

Title: Kernel Learning Assisted Synthesis Condition Exploration for Ternary Spinel
Authors: Yutong Liu, Mehrad Ansari, Robert Black, Jason Hattrick-Simpers
Abstract: Machine learning and high-throughput experimentation have greatly accelerated the discovery of mixed metal oxide catalysts by leveraging their compositional flexibility. However, the lack of established synthesis routes for solid-state materials remains a significant challenge in inorganic chemistry. An interpretable machine learning model is therefore essential, as it provides insights into the key factors governing phase formation. Here, we focus on the formation of single-phase Fe$_2$(ZnCo)O$_4$, synthesized via a high-throughput co-precipitation method. We combined a kernel classification model with a novel application of global SHAP analysis to pinpoint the experimental features most critical to single phase synthesizability by interpreting the contributions of each feature. Global SHAP analysis reveals that precursor and precipitating agent contributions to single-phase spinel formation align closely with established crystal growth theories. These results not only underscore the importance of interpretable machine learning in refining synthesis protocols but also establish a framework for data-informed experimental design in inorganic synthesis.

Title: Entanglement Hamiltonian of two disjoint blocks in the harmonic chain
Authors: Francesco Gentile, Andrei Rotaru, Erik Tonni
Abstract: We study the entanglement Hamiltonian of two disjoint blocks in the harmonic chain on the line and in its ground state. In the regime of large mass, the non vanishing terms are only the on-site and the nearest-neighbour ones. Analytic expressions are obtained for their profiles, which are written in terms of piecewise linear functions that can be discontinuous and display sharp transitions as the separation between the blocks changes. In the regime of vanishing mass, where the matrices characterising the entanglement Hamiltonian contain couplings at all distances, we explore the location of the subdominant terms and some combinations of matrix elements that are useful for the continuum limit, comparing the results with the corresponding ones for the free chiral current. The single-particle entanglement spectra of these entanglement Hamiltonians are also investigated.

Title: Topological kicks enhance colloidal diffusivity in topological turbulence
Authors: Timofey Kozhukhov, Benjamin Loewe, Kristian Thijssen, Tyler N. Shendruk
Abstract: Colloidal inclusions in nematic fluids induce topological defects that govern their dynamics. These defects create well-understood rheological behavior in passive nematics, but the interplay between colloid-associated defects and spontaneously generated activity-induced defects introduces new dynamical regimes in active nematic turbulence. Using mesoscale simulations, we study the motion of colloids with strong anchoring in an active nematic and find effective colloid diffusivity exhibits a striking non-monotonic dependence on activity. At low activities, topological kicks from the motile activity-induced bulk defects drive frequent rearrangements of the colloid-associated defects, enhancing colloidal transport. At high activity, defect interactions become isotropic, decorrelating colloidal motion and reducing the effective diffusivity. Our results reveal how the competition between colloid-associated and activity-induced defects fundamentally shapes transport in active nematics.

Title: Low-Moment Semiconducting Properties of Quaternary Heusler Alloy CoRuTiSn
Authors: Ravinder Kumar, Tufan Roy, Masafumi Shirai, Sachin Gupta
Abstract: We investigate structural, magnetic and transport properties of CoRuTiSn equiatomic quaternary Heusler alloy. CoRuTiSn was synthesized by arc-melt technique. The room temperature powder XRD pattern was analyzed, and it was found that CoRuTiSn has a tetragonal crystal structure. Magnetic measurements show non-zero but small hysteresis indicating CoRuTiSn as a soft ferromagnetic with a Curie temperature of ~200 K. The magnetic moment determined from magnetization data is found to be 0.84 {\mu}B/f.u. at 4 K, which is close to the value, calculated using first principles calculations. Electrical resistivity decreases with temperatures, indicating semiconducting nature of CoRuTiSn. Hall effect measurements show anomalous behavior, consistent with the ferromagnetic nature of the sample. The low moment ferromagnetic semiconducting nature of CoRuTiSn could make this material promising for semiconducting spintronics.

Title: Excitability and travelling waves in renewable active matter
Authors: Abhishek M, Ankit Dhanuka, Deb Sankar Banerjee, Madan Rao
Abstract: Activity and renewability are distinctive features of living matter, and constitute a new class of materials that we term renewable active matter. A striking example is the cell cytoskeleton, where myosin filaments bind to the actin meshwork, apply contractile stresses and undergo continual stress/strain dependent turnover, thus acting as both force generators and sensors. As a consequence of nonreciprocity, arising from the independence of action and response, such living matter exhibits unusual mechanical properties like, segregation without attraction, fragility and force chains. Here we show that the interplay between activity and turnover gives rise to mechanical excitability in the form of travelling waves and pulses, and spatiotemporal chaos. We provide a systematic study of the nucleation, movement and shape of the travelling pulse, and present a boundary layer analysis to establish the existence of homoclinic orbits. Our analytical results are supported by detailed numerical analysis of the governing partial differential equations. This study has implications for the observed mechanical excitability in a variety of cellular contexts such as in isolated adherent cells and confluent cells within tissues.

Title: Magnetic excitations in a trilayer antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model
Authors: Lan-Ye He, Xin-Man Ye, Dao-Xin Yao
Abstract: We investigate the sublattice magnetizations and magnetic excitations of a $S=1/2$ trilayer antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model with interlayer interaction $J_{\bot}$ and intralayer interaction $J_{//}$ by employing stochastic series expansion quantum Monte Carlo (SSE-QMC) and stochastic analytic continuation (SAC) methods. Compared with the bilayer model, the trilayer model has one inner layer and two outer layers. The change in its symmetry can lead to special magnetic excitations. Our study reveals that the maximum of the magnetization of the outer sublattice corresponds to smaller ratio parameter $g={J_{//}}/{J_{\bot}}$, a finding that is verified using the finite-size extrapolation. As $g$ decreases, the excitation spectra gradually evolve from a degenerate magnon mode with continua to low-energy and high-energy branches. Particularly when $g$ is small enough, like $0.02$, the high-energy spectrum further splits into characteristic doublon ($\approx J_{\bot}$) and quarton ($\approx 1.5 J_{\bot}$) spectral bands. Moreover, the accuracy of the magnetic excitations is confirmed through the SpinW software package and the dispersion relations derived through the first-order perturbation theory. Our results provide an important reference for experiments, which can be directly compared with experimental data from inelastic neutron scattering results to verify and guide the accuracy of experimental detection.

Title: Defects and Impurity Properties of VN precipitates in ARAFM Steels: Modelling using a Universal Machine Learning Potential and Experimental Validation
Authors: R. S. Stroud, C. Reynolds, T. Melichar, J. Haley, M. Carter, M. Moody, C. Hardie, D. Bowden, D.Nguyen-Manh, M. R. Wenman
Abstract: VN precipitates used to strengthen ARAFM steels for fusion applications, have been shown to undergo dissolution under high Fe ion irradiation doses of 100 dpa at dose rates of 10^-3 dpa/s at 600 C. Here, point defects and solute substitutions have been studied using atom probe tomography (APT), universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs), and density functional theory. Through a combination of transmission electron microscopy (TEM), APT, and atomic scale calculations, N-vacancies and substitutional Cr are found to be present in VN precipitates prior to irradiation. Ternary convex hulls were calculated for ten VNX (X=Cr, Fe, C, Si, Mn, W, Ta, B, S, P) systems with an uMLIP. These calculations predict Fe, P, Mn, and Si to be unstable solutes in the VN precipitate. Therefore, Fe, P, Mn and Si implantation via collision cascades is found to be a possible mechanism driving dissolution of VN.

Abstract: The phase transition in CrN epitaxial films is substantially suppressed by epitaxial constraint. Here, we propose that nitrogen (N) vacancies can be taken as a knob to regulate the phase transition of CrN(111) epitaxial films. To validate this concept, a series of CrN(111) films with controlled N concentrations (approximately from 0.0 to 5.0 at.%) were epitaxially grown on Al2O3(0001) substrates. Experimental characterization reveals that higher N vacancy concentrations significantly facilitate the out-of-plane contraction of the films at 273 K (0.8%), reaching up to 60% of the contraction magnitude of CrN powders (1.2%) without compromising the stability and reproducibility of the phase transition. Reducing N vacancy concentrations diminishes the lattice contraction, lowers the phase transition temperature to 193 K, and triggers a metallic to insulator transition in electrical behavior. First-principles calculations corroborate these findings, showing that N vacancies decrease the internal tensile stress within triangular Cr atomic layers, which enhances the out-of-plane contraction, elevates phase transition temperatures, and promotes bandgap closure. These results establish N vacancies as a critical factor governing phase transition dynamics in CrN systems and provide a practical strategy for successively engineering thermally responsive phase transitions in CrN films, advancing their potential for functional device applications.

Title: Biorthogonal basis approach to fractional Chern physics
Authors: Nobuyuki Okuma
Abstract: A fractional Chern insulator is thought to emerge from the competition between one-particle band topology and strong repulsive interactions. As an attempt to study lattice models of fractional Chern insulators, we introduce a biorthogonal basis constructed from coherent-like states on the von Neumann lattice. Focusing on the fact that this basis is diagonal to the vortex attachment in the infinite-volume limit, we convert the original fermions into composite fermions by applying a two-dimensional Jordan-Wigner transformation to the creation and annihilation operators of the biorthogonal basis. Furthermore, we apply the Hartree-Fock mean-field approximation to handle the interaction Hamiltonian of composite fermions. Due to the biorthogonal nature, the representation of the new Hamiltonian is no longer Hermitian, which implies that the introduction of the approximation does not guarantee the reality of the energy spectrum. In fact, there are many self-consistent solutions with complex spectra. Nevertheless, we numerically find that it is possible to construct a self-consistent solution where the band dispersion is nearly real and the ground-state energy is lower than in other solutions.

Title: Automated evaluation of imaginary time strong coupling diagrams by sum-of-exponentials hybridization fitting
Authors: Zhen Huang, Denis Golež, Hugo U. R. Strand, Jason Kaye
Abstract: We present an efficient separation of variables algorithm for the evaluation of imaginary time Feynman diagrams appearing in the bold pseudo-particle strong coupling expansion of the Anderson impurity model. The algorithm uses a fitting method based on AAA rational approximation and numerical optimization to obtain a sum-of-exponentials expansion of the hybridization function, which is then used to decompose the diagrams. A diagrammatic formulation of the algorithm leads to an automated procedure for diagrams of arbitrary order and topology. We also present methods of stabilizing the self-consistent solution of the pseudo-particle Dyson equation. The result is a low-cost and high-order accurate impurity solver for quantum embedding methods using general multi-orbital hybridization functions at low temperatures, appropriate for low-to-intermediate expansion orders. In addition to other benchmark examples, we use our solver to perform a dynamical mean-field theory study of a minimal model of the strongly correlated compound Ca$_2$RuO$_4$, describing the anti-ferromagnetic transition and the in- and out-of-plane anisotropy induced by spin-orbit coupling.

Title: Ab initio calculation on Herbertsmithite: exchange interactions including extra-plane magnetic impurities, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and anisotropic coupling
Authors: Flaurent Heully-Alary, Nadia Ben Amor, Nicolas Suaud, Laura Messio, Coen de Graaf, Nathalie Guihéry
Abstract: A detailed ab initio evaluation of the isotropic and anisotropic exchange interactions of Herbertsmithite is presented. This compound crystallizes in a so-called Kagome lattice and the S=1/2 spin structure is not fully resolved despite numerous experimental and theoretical studies. The present study not only focusses on the leading in-plane nearest neighbor isotropic interactions, but also other less well studied interactions such as the anisotropic exchange and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions. The anisotropic exchange is very weak, but the DM interactions are sizeable with a strong in-plane component, typically obviated in model studies. Moreover, it is shown that the extra-plane magnetic impurities have a non-negligible interaction with the regular in-plane magnetic sites. Combined with an estimated occurrence of these magnetic impurities of ~15%, the present results indicate that two-dimensional magnetic models only describe part of the physics.

Title: Grid-Free Evaluation of Phonon-Limited Electronic Relaxation Times and Transport Properties
Authors: Nenad Vukmirović
Abstract: Present calculations of electrical transport properties of materials require evaluations of electron-phonon coupling constants on dense predefined grids of electron and phonon momenta and performing the sums over these momenta. In this work, we present the methodology for calculation of carrier relaxation times and electrical transport properties without the use of a predefined grid. The relaxation times are evaluated by integrating out the delta function that ensures energy conservation and performing an average over the angular components of phonon momentum. The charge carrier mobility is then evaluated as a sum over appropriately sampled electronic momenta. We illustrate our methodology by applying to the Fr{ö}hlich model and to a real semiconducting material ZnTe. We find that rather accurate results can be obtained with a modest number of electron and phonon momenta, on the order of one hundred each, regardless of the carrier effective mass.

Title: A collision model for very flexible Cosserat rods and immersed-boundary fluid-structure coupling
Authors: Bastian Löhrer (1), Rolf Krause (2), Jochen Fröhlich (1) ((1) Institute of Fluid Mechanics, Technische Universität Dresden, Dresden, Germany, (2) Euler Institute, Università della Svizzera italiana, Lugano, Switzerland)
Abstract: The paper presents a constraint-based collision model for Cosserat rods, able to handle dynamic or static contact between a large number of highly flexible structures. The model provides the required collision impulses prior to updating the solution of the rods, with the impulses accounted for as external loads. The procedure avoids the need to modify the structure solver itself and circumvents any iteration between the collision model and the solver for the Cosserat rods, maintaining the efficiency of any chosen Cosserat solver. The collision model is adopted from Tschisgale et al. (Arch. Appl. Mech., 2019) and extended towards higher stability, which is found necessary in the case of very flexible rods. Furthermore, the model is supplemented with additional terms that arise when the colliding rods are immersed in a fluid. The latter is accounted for by an immersed-boundary method. A large number of tests are conducted to demonstrate the functionality of the final model.

Title: Fundamentals of heterodyne wave mixing spectroscopy: a tutorial
Authors: Daniel Groll, Thilo Hahn, Paweł Machnikowski, Tilmann Kuhn, Jacek Kasprzak, Daniel Wigger
Abstract: This tutorial provides a joint theoretical and experimental overview of heterodyne wave mixing spectroscopy, focusing mainly on four-wave mixing (FWM). This powerful and versatile time-resolved nonlinear optical spectroscopy technique enables the investigation of individual localized single photon emitters, as well as microscopy of extended samples, e.g., two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides. Starting with the fundamental theory of optically driven two-level systems, we motivate the utility of wave mixing spectroscopy via a discussion on homogeneous and inhomogeneous linewidths which can be independently measured using FWM. We then provide a detailed overview of the heterodyne wave mixing setup operated by one of the authors (JK) at Institut Néel in Grenoble, supported by theoretical modeling of the signal detection process. Throughout the paper we elaborate on important benefits of heterodyne wave mixing spectroscopy, e.g., background-free detection, measurement of the full signal field including amplitude and phase, and investigation of coupling mechanisms in few-level systems. Within the context of the latter point we discuss the significance of two-dimensional (2D) FWM spectra. This tutorial is dedicated to students, young researchers, as well as experts in the field of nonlinear spectroscopy in general and FWM in particular. It explains the fundamental concepts and building blocks required to operate a heterodyne wave mixing experiment both from the experimental and theoretical side. This joint approach is helpful for theoreticians who want to accurately and quantitatively model wave mixing signals, as well as for experimentalists who aim to interpret their recorded data.

Title: Emergent Pair Density Wave Order Across a Lifshitz Transition
Authors: Luhang Yang, Elbio Dagotto, Adrian E. Feiguin
Abstract: We numerically investigate the telltale signs of pair-density-wave order (PDW) in the Kondo-Heisenberg chain by focusing on the momentum resolved spectrum in different parameter regimes. Density matrix renormalization group calculations reveal that this phase is characterized by a dispersion with two minima and four Fermi points, indicating the emergence of an effective next-nearest-neighbor hopping that arises as a second-order effect to avoid magnetic frustration. The pairs appear in the spectrum as in-gap bound states with weight concentrated in the hole pockets. The low-energy physics can be understood by means of a generalized $t-J$ model with next-nearest-neighbor hopping. Our results offer a guide for searching for experimental signatures, and for other models that can realize PDW physics.

Title: Vibrational Instabilities in Charge Transport through Molecular Nanojunctions: The Role of Nonconservative Current-Induced Electronic Forces
Authors: Martin Mäck, Riley J. Preston, Michael Thoss, Samuel L. Rudge
Abstract: Understanding the current-induced vibrational dynamics in molecular nanojunctions is critical for gaining insight into the stability of such systems. While it is well known that Joule heating at higher bias voltages plays an important role for the stability of the nanojunction, a different mechanism caused by current-induced nonconservative forces has been reported to cause vibrational instabilities already at much lower voltages. In this paper, we apply a mixed quantum-classical approach based on electronic friction and Langevin dynamics to a model system for which vibrational instabilities have previously been reported. The electronic friction and other electronic forces can be calculated exactly using nonequilibrium Green's functions. We perform Langevin simulations of the vibrational dynamics to calculate the steady-state vibrational excitation and compare the results to a simplified eigenmode analysis, identifying the parameter regimes in which runaway modes appear.

Title: Plasticity Encoding and Mapping during Elementary Loading for Accelerated Mechanical Properties Prediction
Authors: Mathieu Calvat, Chris Bean, Dhruv Anjaria, Haoren Wang, Kenneth Vecchio, J.C. Stinville
Abstract: Encoding metal plasticity captured from high-resolution digital image correlation (DIC) can be leveraged to predict a wide range of monotonic and cyclic macroscopic properties of metallic materials. To capture the spatial heterogeneity of plasticity that develops in metals, latent space features describing plasticity of a small region are spatially mapped across a large field of view while maintaining the same spatial relationships as the experimental measurements. Latent space feature maps capture the complexity and heterogeneity of metal plasticity as a low-dimensional representation. These feature maps are then used to train a convolutional neural network-based model to predict monotonic and cyclic macroscopic properties. The approach is demonstrated on a large set of face-centered cubic metals, enabling rapid and accurate property prediction. The effects of hyperparameters and training strategies are analyzed, and the extension of the proposed approach to a broader range of metallic materials and loading conditions is discussed.

Title: Probing Rate-Dependent Liquid Shear Viscosity Using Combined Machine Learning and Non-Equilibrium Molecular Dynamics
Authors: Hongyu Gao, Minghe Zhu, Jia Ma, Marc Honecker, Kexian Li
Abstract: Accurately measuring liquid dynamic viscosity across a wide range of shear rates, from the linear-response to shear-thinning regimes, presents significant experimental challenges due to limitations in resolving high shear rates and controlling thermal effects. In this study, we integrated machine learning (ML) with non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations to address these challenges. A supervised artificial neural network (ANN) model was developed to predict viscosity as a function of shear rate, normal pressure, and temperature, effectively capturing the complex interplay among these variables. The model reveals distinct trends in shear viscosity, characterized by the shear-thinning exponent, and highlights non-monotonic behavior in the radius of gyration components, reflecting molecular morphological changes driven by rate-dependent volume expansion. Notably, temperature effects diminish at higher shear rates, where molecular alignment and spacing dominate the response to shear. By implementing the 'fix npt/sllod' command in LAMMPS, we achieve precise constant-pressure control in NEMD simulations, ensuring accurate representation of system dynamics. This study demonstrates the potential of ML-enhanced NEMD for efficient and accurate viscosity prediction, providing a robust framework for future research in complex fluid dynamics and material design.

Title: Ultrafast decoupling of polarization and strain in ferroelectric BaTiO$_3$

Vartanyants, Andreas Scherz, Giuseppe Mercurio
Abstract: A fundamental understanding of the interplay between lattice structure, polarization and electrons is pivotal to the optical control of ferroelectrics. The interaction between light and matter enables the remote and wireless control of the ferroelectric polarization on the picosecond timescale, while inducing strain, i.e., lattice deformation. At equilibrium, the ferroelectric polarization is proportional to the strain, and is typically assumed to be so also out of equilibrium. Decoupling the polarization from the strain would remove the constraint of sample design and provide an effective knob to manipulate the polarization by light. Here, upon an above-bandgap laser excitation of the prototypical ferroelectric BaTiO$_3$, we induce and measure an ultrafast decoupling between polarization and strain that begins within 350 fs, by softening Ti-O bonds via charge transfer, and lasts for several tens of picoseconds. We show that the ferroelectric polarization out of equilibrium is mainly determined by photoexcited electrons, instead of the strain. This excited state could serve as a starting point to achieve stable and reversible polarization switching via THz light. Our results demonstrate a light-induced transient and reversible control of the ferroelectric polarization and offer a pathway to control by light both electric and magnetic degrees of freedom in multiferroics.

Title: Magnetic domain wall curvature effects on the velocity in the creep regime
Authors: Adriano Di Pietro, Alessandro Magni, Giovanni Carlotti, Gianfranco Durin, Marco Madami, Cristopher H. Marrows, Silvia Tacchi, Emily Darwin, Alexandra J. Huxtable, Bryan J. Hickey, Michaela Kuepfeling
Abstract: We study the effect of magnetic domain wall curvature on its dynamics in the creep regime in systems displaying Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). We first derive an extended creep model able to account for the finite curvature effect in magnetic bubble domain expansion. We then discuss the relative importance of this effect and discuss its dependence on the main magnetic and disorder parameters. We show this effect can be easily measured in Pt/Co multi layer samples, reporting a strong velocity reduction below a sample dependent threshold value of the magnetic bubble radius. We finally show, both theoretically and experimentally, how the radius of magnetic bubbles can have a strong impact on the reproducibility of DMI measurements.

Title: Machine Learning and Data-Driven Methods in Computational Surface and Interface Science
Authors: Lukas Hörmann, Wojciech G. Stark, Reinhard J. Maurer
Abstract: Nanoscale design of surfaces and interfaces is essential for modern technologies like organic LEDs, batteries, fuel cells, superlubricating surfaces, and heterogeneous catalysis. However, these systems often exhibit complex surface reconstructions and polymorphism, with properties influenced by kinetic processes and dynamic behavior. A lack of accurate and scalable simulation tools has limited computational modeling of surfaces and interfaces. Recently, machine learning and data-driven methods have expanded the capabilities of theoretical modeling, enabling, for example, the routine use of machine-learned interatomic potentials to predict energies and forces across numerous structures. Despite these advances, significant challenges remain, including the scarcity of large, consistent datasets and the need for computational and data-efficient machine learning methods. Additionally, a major challenge lies in the lack of accurate reference data and electronic structure methods for interfaces. Density Functional Theory, while effective for bulk materials, is less reliable for surfaces, and too few accurate experimental studies on interface structure and stability exist. Here, we will sketch the current state of data-driven methods and machine learning in computational surface science and provide a perspective on how these methods will shape the field in the future.

Title: Single-band Triangular Lattice Hubbard Model with Tunable Anisotropy from Twisted Diamond Homobilayers
Authors: Wen Sun, Chuyi Tuo, Hong Yao
Abstract: The ground-state properties of the single-band triangular lattice Hubbard model with hopping anisotropy and strong interactions remain elusive so far. Here we show that twisted diamond homobilayers with band extrema at $Y$ valley can realize weakly-coupled chains with quasi-1D band structure; applying displacement field generates interchain hopping, transforming this quasi-1D system into a 2D one. The low-energy physics can be described by localized Wannier functions on the triangular lattice with tunable hopping anisotropy, providing a promising platform for studying the anisotropic triangular lattice Hubbard model. We further employ density matrix renormalization group to study this model with interaction $U=10t$ and anisotropy $0.5\leq t'/t\leq 1.5$ at half filling, and obtain a rich ground state phase diagram, including a chiral spin liquid phase, non-magnetic phases, and a Néel antiferromagnetic phase. This work provides a first realization of displacement-field tuned anisotropy in a single-band triangular Hubbard model within moiré systems, establishing them as a promising platform to investigate intriguing correlated physics with tunable anisotropy.

Title: TopoGEN: topology-driven microstructure generation for in silico modeling of fiber network mechanics
Authors: Sara Cardona, Mathias Peirlinck, Behrooz Fereidoonnezhad
Abstract: The fields of mechanobiology and biomechanics are expanding our understanding of the complex behavior of soft biological tissues across multiple scales. Given the intricate connection between tissue microstructure and its macroscale mechanical behavior, unraveling this mechanistic relationship remains an ongoing challenge. Reconstituted fiber networks serve as valuable in vitro models to simplify the intricacy of in vivo systems for targeted investigations. Concurrently, advances in imaging enable microstructure visualization and, through generative pipelines, modeling as discrete element networks. These mesoscale models provide insights into macroscale tissue behavior. However, a systematic study of how microstructural variations influence nonlinear tissue mechanics is still lacking. In this work, we develop a novel framework to generate topologically-driven discrete fiber networks. Leveraging these networks, we generate models of interconnected load-bearing fiber components that exhibit softening under compression and are bending-resistant. By virtually replicating microstructural features of reconstituted collagen networks, such as fiber volume fractions and cross-link concentration, we evaluate the robustness of our simulations. Analyzing the nonlinear elastic behavior at varying polymerization temperatures, we find consistency between the in silico results and in vitro data from the literature. We extend our investigation beyond empirically measurable factors to explore microstructural effects at the single fiber level (i.e., fibril morphology and stiffness) that are challenging to investigate experimentally. TopoGEN allows us to mechanistically explore localized microstructural phenomena and relate microstructural changes to the bulk mechanical response of soft biological materials, hence providing an indispensable tool to advance the fields of tissue biomechanics and engineering.

Title: Emergence of distinct exact mobility edges in a quasiperiodic chain
Authors: Sanchayan Banerjee, Soumya Ranjan Padhi, Tapan Mishra
Abstract: Mobility edges (MEs) constitute the energies separating the localized states from the extended ones in disordered systems. Going beyond this conventional definition, recent proposal suggests for an ME which separates the localized and multifractal states in certain quasiperiodic systems - dubbed as the anomalous mobility edges (AMEs). In this study, we propose an exactly solvable quasiperiodic system that hosts both the conventional and anomalous mobility edges under proper conditions. We show that with increase in quasiperiodic disorder strength, the system first undergoes a delocalization to localization transition through an ME of conventional type. Surprisingly, with further increase in disorder, we obtain that a major fraction of the localized states at the middle of the spectrum turn multifractal in nature. Such unconventional behavior in the spectrum results in two AMEs, which continue to exist even for stronger quasiperiodic disorder. We numerically obtain the signatures of the coexisting MEs complement it through analytical derivation using Avila's global theory. In the end we provide important signatures from the wavepacket dynamics.

Title: Neodymium ions as charge reservoir in NdNiO$_2$: from lack of long range order to electron-doping-induced antiferromagnetism
Authors: Adam Kłosiński, Krzysztof Wohlfeld, Wojciech Brzezicki
Abstract: We study magnetism in the electron-doped infinite-layer nickelate NdNiO$_2$. We perform an unrestricted Hartree-Fock calculation for a tight-binding model which contains both nickel and neodymium orbitals. We reproduce the self-doping effect, which is the escape of charge onto the neodymium bands. By fixing all free parameters to realistic values we find that undoped NdNiO$_2$ lies right {\it outside} the antiferromagnetic (AFM) region of the phase diagram. This is consistent with experiments, which find no long-range order in the ground state of NdNiO$_2$, yet see short-range AFM correlations and broad magnetic excitations. Finally, we find that the self-doping effect leads to a dramatic increase in the stability of the AFM solution upon electron doping -- a behavior that is strikingly different from what is, for instance, observed in the cuprates.

Title: Intrinsic back-switching phenomenon in SOT-MRAM devices
Authors: Kuldeep Ray, Jérémie Vigier, Perrine Usé, Sylvain Martin, Nicolas Lefoulon, Chloé Bouard, Marc Drouard, Gilles Gaudin
Abstract: The writing process of SOT-MRAMs is considered deterministic when additional symmetry-breaking factors, such as the application of an external magnetic field aligned with the current, are present. Notably, the write probability exhibits a unique behavior as a function of the current: it drops to zero at high currents or even oscillates with the current. This phenomenon is attributed to back-switching, an intrinsic effect of magnetization reversal driven by spin-orbit torques. A systematic investigation of this back-switching phenomenon is conducted on sub-100 nm CoFeB magnetic pillars positioned at the center of $\beta$-W Hall crosses. Using a statistical approach, the study examines the impact of various parameters, including the amplitude of current pulses and the application of magnetic fields in different directions. The findings reveal that the back-switching phenomenon is not statistically random. Macrospin simulations, employing realistic magnetic parameter values, accurately replicate the experimental observations and provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of back-switching. These simulations also explore strategies to mitigate the phenomenon, such as optimizing the shape of the writing pulses. Applying this approach to complete SOT-MRAM single cells achieves a write error rate below $2 \times 10^{-6}$, demonstrating the effectiveness of this strategy in expanding the operational current range for write operations in SOT-MRAMs.

Title: Quadrupolar and Dipolar Excitons in Bilayer 2$H$-MoSe$_2$
Authors: Shun Feng, Aidan J. Campbell, Bibi Mary Francis, Hyeonjun Baek, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Iann C. Gerber, Brian D. Gerardot, Mauro Brotons-Gisbert
Abstract: We report the experimental observation of quadrupolar exciton states in the reflectance contrast spectrum of 2$H$-stacked bilayer MoSe$_2$. The application of a vertical electric field results in a quadratic energy redshift of these quadrupolar excitons, in contrast to the linear energy splitting observed in the coexisting dipolar excitons within the bilayer MoSe$_2$. We perform helicity-resolved reflectance contrast measurements to investigate the spin and valley configurations of the quadrupolar exciton states as a function of applied vertical electric and magnetic fields. Comparing our results with a phenomenological coupled-oscillator model indicates that the electric- and magnetic-field dependence of the quadrupolar exciton states can be attributed to the intravalley and intervalley hybridization of spin-triplet interlayer excitons with opposite permanent dipole moments, mediated by interlayer hole tunneling. These results position naturally stacked MoSe$_2$ bilayers as a promising platform to explore electric-field-tunable many-body exciton phenomena.

Title: A Multi-Agent Framework Integrating Large Language Models and Generative AI for Accelerated Metamaterial Design
Authors: Jie Tian, Martin Taylor Sobczak, Dhanush Patil, Jixin Hou, Lin Pang, Arunachalam Ramanathan, Libin Yang, Xianyan Chen, Yuval Golan, Hongyue Sun, Kenan Song, Xianqiao Wang
Abstract: Metamaterials, renowned for their exceptional mechanical, electromagnetic, and thermal properties, hold transformative potential across diverse applications, yet their design remains constrained by labor-intensive trial-and-error methods and limited data interoperability. Here, we introduce CrossMatAgent--a novel multi-agent framework that synergistically integrates large language models with state-of-the-art generative AI to revolutionize metamaterial design. By orchestrating a hierarchical team of agents--each specializing in tasks such as pattern analysis, architectural synthesis, prompt engineering, and supervisory feedback--our system leverages the multimodal reasoning of GPT-4o alongside the generative precision of DALL-E 3 and a fine-tuned Stable Diffusion XL model. This integrated approach automates data augmentation, enhances design fidelity, and produces simulation- and 3D printing-ready metamaterial patterns. Comprehensive evaluations, including CLIP-based alignment, SHAP interpretability analyses, and mechanical simulations under varied load conditions, demonstrate the framework's ability to generate diverse, reproducible, and application-ready designs. CrossMatAgent thus establishes a scalable, AI-driven paradigm that bridges the gap between conceptual innovation and practical realization, paving the way for accelerated metamaterial development.

Title: Predicted third-order sweet spots for phi-junction Josephson parametric amplifiers
Authors: Tasnum Reza, Sergey M. Frolov
Abstract: Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowire Josephson junctions exhibit skewed and phi-shifted current phase relations when an in-plane magnetic field is applied along the weak link's spin-orbit effective field direction. These junctions can have an asymmetric Josephson potential with odd-order nonlinearities. A dominant third-order nonlinearity can be achieved by tuning the magnetic field to a sweet spot. Sweet spots persist when higher order Josephson harmonics are included. This makes it possible to have a single Josephson junction dipole element with three-wave mixing capability, which is favorable for pump-efficient amplification. Electrostatic gate tunability of the semiconductor weak link can make it operable within an extended range of working frequencies, and the inclusion of micromagnets can facilitate near-zero magnetic field operation.

Title: Universality of pseudo-Goldstone damping near critical points
Authors: Yang-yang Tan, Yong-rui Chen, Wei-jie Fu, Wei-Jia Li
Abstract: Real-time dynamics of strongly correlated systems, in particular its critical dynamics near phase transitions, have been always on the cutting edge of studies in diverse fields of physics, e.g., high energy physics, condensed matter, holography, etc. In this work, we investigate the critical damping of collective modes associated with spontaneous breaking of approximate symmetries, which are called pseudo-Goldstone modes, in strongly correlated systems. Using the Schwinger-Keldysh field theory, we find a universal pseudo-Goldstone damping via the critical O($N$) model that has never been found before by other approaches. Different from the conventional damping found in holography and hydrodynamics, the new one is controlled by critical fluctuations, hence is invisible in mean-field systems or strongly correlated systems with classical gravity duals. Since the critical damping depends solely on the universalities of the critical point, irrespective of the microscopic details, our conclusion should be applicable to a wide class of interacting systems.

Title: Non-Markovian dynamics of a qubit due to accelerated light in a lattice
Authors: Marcel Augusto Pinto, Giovanni Luca Sferrazza, Daniele De Bernardis, Francesco Ciccarello
Abstract: We investigate the emission of a qubit weakly coupled to a one-band coupled-cavity array where, due to an engineered gradient in the cavity frequencies, photons are effectively accelerated by a synthetic force F. For strong F, a reversible emission described by an effective Jaynes-Cummings model occurs, causing a chiral time-periodic excitation of an extensive region of the array, either to the right or to the left of the qubit depending on its frequency. For weak values of F instead, a complex non-Markovian decay with revivals shows up. This is reminiscent of dynamics induced by mirrors in standard waveguides, despite the absence of actual mirrors, and can be attributed to the finite width of the energy band which confines the motion of the emitted photon. In a suitable regime, the decay is well described by a delay differential equation formally analogous to the one governing the decay of an atom in a multi-mode cavity where the cavity length and time taken by a photon to travel between the two mirrors are now embodied by the amplitude and period of Bloch oscillations, respectively.

Title: Entanglement cones and horizons in analogue cosmological production of Dirac fermions
Authors: Carlos Fulgado-Claudio, Alejandro Bermudez
Abstract: Although gravitational particle production in curved quantum field theories (cQFTs) is key to our understanding of the early universe and black hole physics, its direct observation requires extreme conditions or unrealistic sensitivities. Recent progress in quantum simulators indicates that analogues of gravitational particle production can be observed in table-top experiments of cold atomic gases described by effective cQFTs. This promises a high degree of tunability in the synthesised curved spacetimes and, moreover, sets a clear roadmap to explore the interplay of gravitational particle production with other non-perturbative effects genuine to interacting QFTs. We hereby focus on the appearance of fermion condensates for self-interacting Dirac fermions, and study how dynamical mass generation and spontaneous symmetry breaking affects real-time dynamics. We use the entanglement contour as a tool to analyze the spatio-temporal causal structure of particle production, showing how it can account for the cosmological horizon in accelerating spacetimes, while also being sensitive to the effect of different symmetry-breaking processes. In particular, we show that the combined breakdown of time-reversal symmetry due to the expanding spacetime, and parity due to a pseudo-scalar condensate, manifest through the structure of the light-cone-like propagation of entanglement in this analogue cQFT.

Title: Nonlinear dynamics of air invasion in one-dimensional compliant fluid networks
Authors: Ludovic Jami, François-Xavier Gauci, Céline Cohen, Xavier Noblin, Ludovic Keiser
Abstract: Vascular networks exhibit a remarkable diversity of architectures and transport mechanisms across biological systems. Inspired by embolism propagation in plant xylem - where air invades water-filled conduits under negative pressure - we study air penetration in compliant one-dimensional hydrodynamic networks experiencing mass loss by pervaporation. Using a theoretical framework grounded in biomimetic models, we show that embolism dynamics are shaped by the interplay between network compliance and viscous dissipation. In particular, the competition between two timescales - the pressure diffusion time, $\tau_\mathrm{diff}$, and the pervaporation time, $\tau_\mathrm{pv}$ - governs the emergence of complex, history-dependent behaviors. When these two timescales are comparable, we uncover previously unreported nonlinear feedback between the internal pressure field and the embolism front, leading to transient depressurization and delayed interface motion. These results offer a minimal framework for understanding embolism dynamics in slow-relaxing vascular systems and provide design principles for soft microfluidic circuits with tunable, nonlinear response.

Title: Leveraging quantum statistics to enhance heat engines
Authors: Keerthy Menon, Thomas Busch, Thomás Fogarty
Abstract: A key focus of designing quantum thermal devices is the potential advantage that can be gleaned from genuine quantum effects when compared to classical devices. The recent experimental realization of the Pauli engine, where energy is extracted via changes in particle statistics as an alternative to conventional heat sources has opened new avenues of research where quantum statistics can be considered as a thermodynamic resource. In this work we propose hybrid quantum heat engines which utilize additional strokes that change the single particle statistics between bosonic and fermionic descriptions during the cycle. To accomplish this we consider the 1D Lieb Liniger gas whereby the s wave interactions can be tuned between the non interacting and the hard core limit, which are described by bosonic and fermionic statistics respectively. We show that by suitably choosing where to implement these statistical strokes during an Otto like cycle, the efficiency and work output can be significantly enhanced when compared to fully bosonic or fully fermionic engines. Furthermore, in the degenerate regime our engine can operate at the Carnot efficiency, due to the interplay between the different contributions of heat and work induced by the statistical strokes. Finally, we highlight how our thermodynamic cycles can realize other thermal operations,such as refrigerators, promising similar statistical enhancements for a wide range of temperatures.

Title: ER=EPR and Strange Metals from Quantum Entanglement
Authors: Sang-Jin Sin, Yi-Li Wang
Abstract: We show how a strange metal emerges from the long-range quantum entanglements. Given that the quenched average of a spatially random coupling between a Fermi surface and critical bosons results in linear-$T$ resistivity, we first calculate the annealed average of the model and find that it also give the linear resistivity. We then observe that the correlator of the 'coupling field' in quenched average can be interpreted as the wormholes that connect pair of points separated by arbitrary distance, while the annealed average can be interpreted as a pure system without disorder having quantum entanglements between the connected pairs. We show that, in the large-$N$ limit, two averages are equivalent. Therefore we suggest that this equivalence provides insight to the precise meaning of $ER=EPR$ conjecture in the context of an explicit model with well defined computation. Also, we point out that the wormhole picture clarifies why a SYK-rized model describes the strongly interacting system even in the case the averaged coupling strength is tiny.

Title: Light's symmetry, asymmetry, and their role in nonlinear optics and ultrafast phenomena
Authors: Ofer Neufeld, Matan Even Tzur, Ofer Kfir, Avner Fleischer, Oren Cohen
Abstract: The analysis of symmetries is extremely useful across science. In Physics, symmetries are used to derive conservation laws and selection rules for transitions in interacting systems. In the early days of nonlinear optics (NLO), symmetries were used to formulate a set of rules for photonic processes according to the medium's symmetries that are reflected in the NLO coefficient tensor. While this approach was believed to be complete and closed, the field has recently reignited as multi-color ultrashort laser pulses with tailored polarization and spatiotemporal structures become standard in NLO. A more complete theory has been recently emerging, which aims to incorporate all possible dynamical degrees of freedom of light: spin and orbital angular momentum, spatial structure, time-dependent polarizations, temporal envelopes, etc., in addition to the symmetries of the medium. This theoretical development is also accompanied by experimental advances that rely on tailored light beams that can now be generated with ever-increasing complexity, including topologies in real and a variety of synthetic dimensions, carrying poly-chromatic carrier waves, time-dependent varying angular momenta, local-chirality, and more. The nonlinear interactions between light fields with unique symmetries (or asymmetries) and matter is especially appealing, since that holds the key for developing new ultrafast spectroscopies with sub-femtosecond resolution, for exerting exact control over matter, and improving our fundamental understanding of how light and matter interact. We review these recent advances in this expanding field, focusing on the theory, its implications, and seminal experiments. We aim to establish a comprehensive database of symmetries and selection rules governing NLO light-matter interactions within the emerging new formalism, and invite the scientific community to contribute to this effort.

Title: Towards a multi-dimensional picture of classical nucleation: The example of liquid condensation through theory and rare event sampling
Authors: Yijian Wu, Thomas Philippe, Aymane Graini, Julien Lam
Abstract: While very popular for its ability to provide an elegant conceptual framework, classical nucleation theory (CNT) still fails at quantitatively reproducing most of the experimental and numerical observations of first order transitions. In this paper, we extend CNT by explicitly incorporating the multi-dimensional aspect of nucleation. Focusing on the liquid condensation of a Lennard-Jones gas, we used state of the art rare event sampling simulations to precisely characterize the nucleation event insisting on the specific features of the critical cluster. Our numerical results indicate a simultaneous growth and densification in liquid condensation. We then exploit these insights to develop a 2-variable nucleation theory. Our model based on the capillary approximation is able to quantitatively retrieve the numerical results in nucleation rate and critical cluster properties. Furthermore, our model provides a qualitatively more accurate representation of nucleation near the spinodal regime. The effectiveness of this integrated numerical and theoretical framework highlights the limitations of CNT and more recent theories while offering a robust foundation for its refinement.

Title: Single-molecule trajectories of reactants in chemically active biomolecular condensates
Authors: Stefano Bo, Lars Hubatsch, Frank Jülicher
Abstract: Biomolecular condensates provide distinct chemical environments, which control various cellular processes. The diffusive dynamics and chemical kinetics inside phase-separated condensates can be studied experimentally by fluorescently labeling molecules, providing key insights into cell biology. We discuss how condensates govern the kinetics of chemical reactions and how this is reflected in the stochastic dynamics of labeled molecules. This allows us to reveal how the physics of phase separation influences the evolution of single-molecule trajectories and governs their statistics. We find that, out of equilibrium, the interactions that enable phase separation can induce directed motion and transport at the level of single molecules. Our work provides a theoretical framework to quantitatively analyze single-molecule trajectories in phase-separated systems.

Title: Ultrafast all-optical switching in nonlinear 3R-MoS$_2$ van der Waals metasurfaces
Authors: Levin Seidt, Thomas Weber, Albert A. Seredin, Thomas Possmayer, Roman Savelev, Mihail A. Petrov, Stefan A. Maier, Andreas Tittl, Leonardo de S. Menezes, Luca Sortino
Abstract: Second-order nonlinear optical processes are fundamental to photonics, spectroscopy, and information technologies, with material platforms playing a pivotal role in advancing these applications. Here, we demonstrate the exceptional nonlinear optical properties of the van der Waals crystal 3R-MoS$_2$, a rhombohedral polymorph exhibiting high second-order optical susceptibility ($\chi^{(2)}$) and remarkable second-harmonic generation (SHG) capabilities. By designing high quality factor resonances in 3R-MoS$_2$ metasurfaces supporting quasi-bound states in the continuum (qBIC), we first demonstrate SHG efficiency enhancement exceeding 10$^2$. Additionally, by using degenerate pump-probe spectroscopy, we harness the C$_{3v}$ system's symmetry to realize ultrafast SHG polarization switching with near-unity modulation depth. The operation speeds are limited only by the excitation pulse duration, allowing its characterization via the nonlinear autocorrelation function. These findings establish 3R-MoS$_2$ as a transformative platform for nanoscale nonlinear optics, offering large conversion efficiencies and ultrafast response times for advanced pulse measurement devices, integrated photonics, and quantum technologies.

Title: Axisymmetric thermoviscous and thermal expansion flows for microfluidics
Authors: Weida Liao, Eric Lauga
Abstract: Recent microfluidic experiments have explored the precise positioning of micron-sized particles in liquid environments via laser-induced thermoviscous flow. From micro-robotics to biology at the subcellular scale, this versatile technique has found a broad range of applications. Through the interplay between thermal expansion and thermal viscosity changes, the repeated scanning of the laser along a scan path results in fluid flow and hence net transport of particles, without physical channels. Building on previous work focusing on two-dimensional microfluidic settings, we present an analytical, theoretical model for the thermoviscous and thermal expansion flows and net transport induced by a translating heat spot in three-dimensional, unconfined fluid. We first numerically solve for the temperature field due to a translating heat source in the experimentally relevant limit. Then, in our flow model, the small, localised temperature increase causes local changes in the mass density, shear viscosity and bulk viscosity of the fluid. We derive analytically the instantaneous flow generated during one scan and compute the net transport of passive tracers due to a full scan, up to quadratic order in the thermal expansion and thermal shear viscosity coefficients. We further show that the flow and transport are independent of bulk viscosity. In the far field, while the leading-order instantaneous flow is typically a three-dimensional source or sink, the leading-order average velocity of tracers is instead a source dipole, whose strength depends on the relative magnitudes of the thermal expansion and thermal shear viscosity coefficients. Our quantitative results reveal the potential for future three-dimensional net transport and manipulation of particles at the microscale.

Title: Tailoring nuclear spins order with defects: a Quantum-TCAD study
Authors: Gaetano Calogero, Ioannis Deretzis, Giuseppe Fisicaro, Damiano Ricciarelli, Rosario Gaetano Viglione, Antonino La Magna
Abstract: The full design of relevant systems for quantum applications, ranging from quantum simulation to sensing, is presented using a combination of atomistic methods. A prototypical system features a two-dimensional ordered distribution of spins interacting with out-of-plane spin drivers/probes. It could be realized in wide-bandgap semiconductors through open-volume point defects and functionalized surfaces with low Miller indexes. We study the case of defect electron spins (driver / probe) interacting via hyperfine coupling with $S=1/2$ nuclear spins of H atoms chemisorbed onto \hkl(001) and \hkl(111) 3C-SiC surfaces. We simulate the system fabrication processes with super lattice kinetic Monte Carlo, demonstrating that epitaxial growth under time-dependent conditions is a viable method for achieving controlled abundance or depletion of near-surface point defects. Quantum features are evaluated by means of extensive numerical analysis at a full quantum mechanical level based on calibrated models of interacting spin systems. This analysis includes both stationary (relative stability of ordered states) and time-dependent (protocols) conditions, achieved varying the model parameters (in our case the atomic structure and the external field). We identify a rich scenario of metastable spin-waves in the quantum simulation setting. The interaction between protocols and variable system configurations could hinder the effectiveness of the preparation/measurement phases.

Title: Topological Mixed Valence Model for Twisted Bilayer Graphene
Authors: Liam L.H. Lau, Piers Coleman
Abstract: Song and Bernevig (SB) have recently proposed a topological heavy fermion description of the physics of magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG), involving the hybridization of flat band electrons with a relativistic conduction sea. We explore the consequences of this model, seeking a synthesis of understanding drawn from heavy fermion physics and MATBG experiments. We identify a key discrepancy between measured and calculated onsite Coulomb interactions, implicating renormalization effects that are not contained in the current model. With these considerations in mind, we consider an SB model with a single, renormalized onsite interaction between the f-electrons, containing a phenomenological heavy fermion binding potential on the moiré AA-sites. This feature allows the simplified model to capture the periodic reset of the chemical potential with filling and the observed stability of local moment behavior. We argue that a two stage Kondo effect will develop in MATBG as a consequence of the relativistic conduction band: Kondo I occurs at high temperatures, establishing a coherent hybridization at the $\Gamma$ points and a non-Fermi liquid of incoherent fermions at the moiré K-points; at much low temperatures Kondo II leads to a Fermi liquid in the flat band. Utilizing an auxiliary-rotor approach, we formulate a mean-field treatment of MATBG that captures this physics, describing the evolution of the normal state across a full range of filling factors. By contrasting the relative time-scales of phonons and valence fluctuations in bulk heavy fermion materials with that of MATBG we propose a valley-polaron origin to the Coulomb renormalization and the heavy fermion binding potential identified from experiment. We also discuss the possibility that the two-fluid, non-Fermi liquid physics of the relativistic Kondo lattice is responsible for the strange metal physics observed in MATBG.

Title: Odd-parity quadrupole order and induced nonreciprocal transport in the kagome metal CsTi3Bi5 driven by quantum interference
Authors: Jianxin Huang, Youichi Yamakawa, Rina Tazai, Takahiro Morimoto, Hiroshi Kontani
Abstract: Kagome metals present a fascinating platform of quantum phases thanks to the interplay between the geometric frustration and strong electron correlation. Here, we propose the emergence of the electric odd-parity bond order (BO) that originates from the intra-unit-cell odd-parity configuration in recently discovered kagome metal CsTi3Bi5. The predicted E1u BO is induced by the beyond- mean-field mechanism, that is, the quantum interference among different sublattice spin fluctuations. Importantly, the accompanied nematic deformation of the Fermi surface is just ~1% while the intensity of the quasiparticle interference signal exhibits drastic nematic anisotropy, consistent with the scanning tunneling microscope measurements in CsTi3Bi5. The present odd-parity BO triggers interesting phenomena, such as the non-linear Hall effect and emergent electromagnetism.

Title: High-Resolution Tunneling Spectroscopy of Fractional Quantum Hall States
Authors: Yuwen Hu, Yen-Chen Tsui, Minhao He, Umut Kamber, Taige Wang, Amir S. Mohammadi, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Zlatko Papic, Michael P. Zaletel, Ali Yazdani
Abstract: Strong interaction between electrons in two-dimensional systems in the presence of a high magnetic field gives rise to fractional quantum Hall states that host quasiparticles with fractional charge and fractional exchange statistics. Here, we demonstrate high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy of fractional quantum Hall states in ultra clean Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene devices. Spectroscopy measurements show sharp excitations that have been predicted to emerge when electrons fractionalize into bound states of quasiparticles. We find energy gaps for candidate non-abelian fractional states that are larger by a factor of five than other related systems - for example semiconductor heterostructures - and this suggests bilayer graphene is an ideal platform for the manipulation of these quasiparticles and for the creation of a topological quantum bit. We also find previously unobserved fractional states in our very clean graphene samples.

Title: Cellular automata in $d$ dimensions and ground states of spin models in $(d+1)$ dimensions
Authors: Konstantinos Sfairopoulos, Luke Causer, Jamie F. Mair, Juan P. Garrahan
Abstract: We show how the trajectories of $d$-dimensional cellular automata (CA) can be used to determine the ground states of $(d+1)$-dimensional classical spin models, and we characterise their quantum phase transition, when in the presence of a transverse magnetic field. For each of the 256 one-dimensional elementary CA we explicitly construct the simplest local two-dimensional classical spin model associated to the given CA, and we also describe this method for $d>1$ through selected examples. We illustrate our general observations with detailed studies of: (i) the $d=1$ CA Rule 150 and its $d=2$ four-body plaquette spin model, (ii) the $d=2$ CA whose associated model is the $d=3$ square-pyramid plaquette model, and (iii) two counter-propagating $d=1$ Rule 60 CA that correspond to the two-dimensional Baxter-Wu spin model. For the quantum spin models, we show that the connection to CAs implies a sensitivity on the approach to the thermodynamic limit via finite size scaling for their quantum phase transitions.

Title: Dirac surface states, multiorbital dimerization and superconductivity in Nb- and Ta-based A15 compounds
Authors: Raghottam M. Sattigeri, Giuseppe Cuono, Ghulam Hussain, Xing Ming, Angelo Di Bernardo, Carmine Attanasio, Mario Cuoco, Carmine Autieri
Abstract: Using first-principle calculations, we investigate the electronic, topological and superconducting properties of Nb$_3$X (X = Ge, Sn, Sb) and Ta$_3$Y (Y = As, Sb, Bi) A15 compounds. We demonstrate that these compounds host Dirac surface states which are related to a nontrivial Z$_2$ topological value. The spin-orbit coupling (SOC) splits the eightfold degenerate R point close to the Fermi level enhancing the amplitude of the spin Hall conductance. Indeed, despite the moderate spin-orbit of the Nb-compounds, a large spin Hall effect is also obtained in Nb$_3$Ge and Nb$_3$Sn compounds. We show that the Coulomb interaction opens the gap at the R point thus making more evident the occurrence of Dirac surface states. We then investigate the superconducting properties by determining the strength of the electron-phonon BCS coupling. The evolution of the critical temperature is tracked down to the 2D limit indicating a reduction of the transition temperature which mainly arises from the suppression of the density of states at the Fermi level. Finally, we propose a minimal tight-binding model based on three coupled Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains with t$_{2g}$ Ta- and Nb-orbitals reproducing the spin-orbit splittings at the R point among the $\pi$-bond bands in this class of compounds. We separate the kinetic parameters in $\pi$ and $\delta$-bonds, in intradimer and interdimer hoppings and discuss their relevance for the topological electronic structure. We point out that Nb$_3$Ge might represent a Z$_2$ topological metal with the highest superconducting temperature ever recorded.

Title: Multifunctional composite magnet realizing record-high transverse thermoelectric generation
Authors: Fuyuki Ando, Takamasa Hirai, Abdulkareem Alasli, Hossein Sepehri-Amin, Yutaka Iwasaki, Hosei Nagano, Ken-ichi Uchida
Abstract: Permanent magnets are used in various products and essential for human society. If omnipresent permanent magnets could directly convert heat into electricity, they would lead to innovative energy harvesting and thermal management technologies. However, achieving such "multifunctionality" has been difficult due to poor thermoelectric performance of conventional magnets. In this work, we develop a multifunctional composite magnet (MCM) that enables giant transverse thermoelectric conversion while possessing permanent magnet features. MCM comprising alternately and obliquely stacked SmCo$_{5}$/Bi$_{0.2}$Sb$_{1.8}$Te$_{3}$ multilayers exhibits an excellent transverse thermoelectric performance at room temperature by optimizing its anisotropic structure. Owing to the extremely low interfacial electrical and thermal resistivities, the experimentally determined figure of merit $z_{\rm xy}T$ reaches 0.20 close to the analytically calculated ideal value. The MCM-based thermopile module generates 204 mW in maximum at a temperature difference of 152 K, whose power density normalized by heat transfer area and temperature gradient is not only record-high among transverse thermoelectric modules but also comparable to that of commercial thermoelectric modules utilizing the Seebeck effect. The multifunctionality of our MCM provides unprecedented opportunities for energy harvesting and thermal management everywhere permanent magnets are currently used.

Title: Light-induced charge and spin Hall currents in materials with $C_4K$ symmetry
Authors: Tohid Farajollahpour, R. Ganesh, Kirill Samokhin
Abstract: Berry curvature, a momentum space property, can manifest itself in current responses. The well-known anomalous Hall effect in time-reversal-breaking systems arises from a Berry curvature monopole. In time-reversal-invariant materials, a second-order Hall conductivity emerges from a Berry curvature dipole. Recently, it has been shown that a Berry curvature quadrupole induces a third-order ac Hall response in systems that break time reversal ($K$) and a fourfold rotational ($C_{4}$) symmetry, while remaining invariant under the combination of the two ($C_{4}K$). In this letter, we demonstrate that incident light can induce a $\rm dc$ Hall current in such systems, driven by the Berry curvature quadrupole. We consider a combination of a static $\rm dc$ electric field and an ac light-induced electric field. We calculate the current perpendicular to both the static electric field and the fourfold axis. Remarkably, the induced current is generically spin-polarized. A net charge current appears for light that is linearly or elliptically polarized, but not for circular polarization. In contrast, the spin current remains unchanged when the polarization of light is varied. This allows for rich possibilities such as generating a spin current by shining circularly polarized light on an altermagnetic material. We demonstrate this physics using a two-dimensional toy model for altermagnets.

Title: Spin-Orbit Torque-Assisted Detection of the Canted Magnetization Phase in a CoTb-Based Ferrimagnet
Authors: Maksim Stebliy, Zhimba Namsaraev, Michail Bazrov, Mikhail Letushev, Valerii Antonov, Aleksei Kozlov, Ekaterina Steblii, Aleksandr Davydenko, Alexey Ognev, Teruo Ono, Alexander Samardak
Abstract: Ferrimagnets have the potential to play a key role in spintronics due to their high stability, low energy consumption, and rapid magnetic state switching. These characteristics are typically observed in ferrimagnetic materials near magnetic or angular compensation states. Near the magnetic compensation point, an external field can disrupt the collinearity between the sublattices, leading to aligned magnetic projections. In this work, a violation of antiferromagnetic ordering is detected by a change in the direction of the effective field induced by spin-orbit torque, without altering the dominance type. In the studied W-Co70Tb30-Ru structure, the canted phase region is observed near room temperature under external fields of approximately 0.1 T. Using macrospin simulations and analytical derivations, a correlation is established between anisotropy, interlattice exchange interaction, and the presence of the canted phase region.

Title: Quantum Metric-induced Oscillations in Flat Bands
Authors: Hui Zeng, Zijian Zhou, Wenhui Duan, Huaqing Huang
Abstract: The transport of Bloch electrons under strong fields is traditionally understood through two mechanisms: intraband Bloch oscillations and interband Zener tunneling. Here, we propose an oscillation mechanism induced by the interband quantum metric, which would significantly affect the electron dynamics under strong fields. By considering the multiband dynamics to the second order of the density matrix, we reveal that quantum metric induced oscillations (QMOs) persist regardless of band dispersion, even in exactly dispersionless flat bands. The resultant drift current can reach a magnitude comparable to the Bloch oscillation induced drift current in systems where interband tunneling is negligible. Notably, the QMO induced drift current increases linearly with electric field strength under the constraints of time-reversal or spatial-inversion symmetry, emerging as the primary delocalized current. We further show that both one-dimensional and two-dimensional superlattices are potential platforms for investigating QMO.

Title: Impact of the Hole Gas on Optically Detected Magnetic Resonance in (Cd,Mn)Te Based Quantum Well
Authors: Aleksandra Łopion, Aleksander Bogucki, Mateusz Raczyński, Zuzanna Śnioch, Karolina E. Połczyńska, Wojciech Pacuski, Tomasz Kazimierczuk, Andrzej Golnik, Piotr Kossacki
Abstract: Optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) is a useful technique for studying interactions between local spins (magnetic ions) and carrier gas. We present the ODMR study of single (Cd,Mn)Te/(Cd,Mg)Te quantum wells (QWs) with the hole gas. We observe different characteristics of the ODMR signals obtained simultaneously using the optical signals of neutral and positively charged exciton. From that, we infer an existence of local fluctuations of carrier gas density resulting in separate populations of Mn$^{2+}$ ions. At the same time, the shape of the ODMR signal contains information about the temperature of the magnetic ions involved in the absorption of the MW. Studying it in detail provides even more information about the interactions with charge carriers. In the QW, two separate ensembles of ions are thermalized differently in the presence of carriers.

Title: On the interplay of electronic and lattice screening on exciton binding in two-dimensional lead halide perovskites
Authors: Rohit Rana, David T. Limmer
Abstract: We use path integral Monte Carlo to study the energetics of excitons in layered, hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites in order to elucidate the relative contributions of dielectric confinement and electron-phonon coupling. While the dielectric mismatch between polar perovskite layers and non-polar ligand layers significantly increases the exciton binding energy relative to their three dimensional bulk crystal counterparts, formation of exciton polarons attenuates this effect. The contribution from polaron formation is found to be a non-monotonic function of the lead halide layer thickness, which is clarified by a general variational theory. Accounting for both of these effects provides a description of exciton binding energies in good agreement with experimental measurements. By studying isolated layers and stacked layered crystals of various thicknesses, with ligands of varying polarity, we provide a systematic understanding of the excitonic behavior of this class of materials and how to engineer their photophysics.

Title: Weak $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Supertopology
Authors: Kirill Parshukov, Moritz M. Hirschmann, Andreas P. Schnyder
Abstract: Crystal symmetries can enforce all bands of a material to be topological, a property that is commonly referred to as ``supertopology". Here, we determine the symmetry-enforced $\mathbb{Z}_2$ supertopologies of non-magnetic centrosymmetric materials with weak and strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC). For weak (i.e., negligible) SOC, crystal symmetries can enforce Dirac nodal lines protected by a $\pi$-Berry phase, while for strong SOC, crystal symmetries can give rise to nontrival weak $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topologies in 2D subplanes of the 3D Brillouin zone. We catalogue all centrosymmetric space groups whose symmetries enforce these $\mathbb{Z}_2$ supertopologies. Suitable material realizations are identified and experimental signatures of the supertopologies, such as quantum spin Hall states, are being discussed.

Title: Onset of Intermittency and Multiscaling in Active Turbulence
Authors: Kolluru Venkata Kiran, Kunal Kumar, Anupam Gupta, Rahul Pandit, Samriddhi Sankar Ray
Abstract: Recent results suggest that highly active, chaotic, non-equilibrium states of living fluids might share much in common with high Reynolds number, inertial turbulence. We now show, by using a hydrodynamical model, the onset of intermittency and the consequent multiscaling of Eulerian and Lagrangian structure functions as a function of the bacterial activity. Our results bridge the worlds of low and high Reynolds number flows as well as open up intriguing possibilities of what makes flows intermittent.

Title: The quantum Newman-Moore model in a longitudinal field
Authors: Konstantinos Sfairopoulos, Juan P. Garrahan
Abstract: We study the quantum Newman-Moore model, or quantum triangular plaquette model (qTPM), in the presence of a longitudinal field (qTPMz). We present evidence that indicates that the ground state phase diagram of the qTPMz includes various frustrated phases breaking translational symmetries, dependent on the specific sequence of system sizes used to take the large-size limit. This phase diagram includes the known first-order phase transition of the qTPM, but also additional first-order transitions due to the frustrated phases. Using the average longitudinal magnetization as an order parameter, we analyze the magnetization plateaus that characterize the ground state phases, describe their degeneracies, and obtain the qTPMz phase diagram using classical transfer matrix and quantum matrix product state techniques. We identify a region of parameter space which can be effectively described by a Rydberg blockade model on the triangular lattice and also find indications of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order connecting the quantum paramagnetic and classical frustrated phases.

Title: Finite-size effects in two-photon correlations of exciton Bose-Einstein condensates
Authors: R.D. Ivanovskikh, I.L. Kurbakov, N.A. Asriyan, Yu. E. Lozovik
Abstract: Accessing two-photon statistics via Hunbary Brown and Twiss (HBT)-type measurements is essential for investigations of excitonic Bose-condensates. In this paper we make use of quantum hydrodynamics in order to study the finite-size impact on the two-photon emission intensity of a 2D condensate of excitons. We use the developed approach to calculate the two-photon decay time of exciton condensate in GaAs quantum wells and MoS$_2$ bilayers. We demonstrate that the registered signal scales on the sample size in a qualitatively different manner than the Bogoliubov theory predicts.

Title: Solvation Free Energies from Neural Thermodynamic Integration
Authors: Bálint Máté, François Fleuret, Tristan Bereau
Abstract: We present a method for computing free-energy differences using thermodynamic integration with a neural network potential that interpolates between two target Hamiltonians. The interpolation is defined at the sample distribution level, and the neural network potential is optimized to match the corresponding equilibrium potential at every intermediate time-step. Once the interpolating potentials and samples are well-aligned, the free-energy difference can be estimated using (neural) thermodynamic integration. To target molecular systems, we simultaneously couple Lennard-Jones and electrostatic interactions and model the rigid-body rotation of molecules. We report accurate results for several benchmark systems: a Lennard-Jones particle in a Lennard-Jones fluid, as well as the insertion of both water and methane solutes in a water solvent at atomistic resolution using a simple three-body neural-network potential.

Title: Confined active particles with spatially dependent Lorentz force: an odd twist to the "best Fokker-Planck approximation"
Authors: René Wittmann, Iman Abdoli, Abhinav Sharma, Joseph M. Brader
Abstract: We derive a version of the so-called "best Fokker-Planck approximation" (BFPA) to describe the spatial properties of interacting active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles (AOUPs) in arbitrary spatial dimensions. In doing so, we also take into account the odd-diffusive contribution of the Lorentz force acting on a charged particle in a spatially dependent magnetic field, sticking to the overdamped limit. While the BFPA itself does not turn out to be widely useful, our general approach allows to deduce an appropriate generalization of the Fox approximation, which we use to characterize the stationary behavior of a single active particle in an external potential by deriving analytic expressions for configurational probability distributions (or effective potentials). In agreement with computer simulations, our theory predicts that the Lorentz force reduces the effective attraction and thus the probability to find an active particle in the vicinity of a repulsive wall. Even for an inhomogeneous magnetic field, our theoretical findings provide useful qualitative insights, specifically regarding the location of accumulation regions.

Title: Non-stoichiometry in SnS: How it affects thin-film morphology and electrical properties
Authors: Taichi Nogami, Issei Suzuki, Daiki Motai, Hiroshi Tanimura, Tetsu Ichitsubo, Takahisa Omata
Abstract: Tin sulfide (SnS) has garnered much attention as a promising material for various applications, including solar cells and thermoelectric devices, owing to its favorable optical and electronic properties and the abundant and nontoxic nature of its constituent elements. Herein, we investigated the effect of non-stoichiometry on the morphology and electrical properties of SnS thin films. Using a unique sputtering technique with a sulfur plasma supply, SnS films with precise sulfur content control, [S]/([Sn] + [S]) (xS) ranging from 0.47 to 0.51, were fabricated. Systematic characterization revealed that non-stoichiometry on the S-rich side led to a marked increase in the carrier density of p-type conduction, which was attributed to the formation of intrinsic acceptor-type defects. In contrast, non-stoichiometry on the S-poor side hardly affects the p-type electrical properties, apparently because of the self-compensation between the intrinsic acceptor- and donor-type defects. In addition, non-stoichiometry has been identified as the cause of thin-film morphological changes, with non-stoichiometric films exhibiting rough and porous surfaces. Achieving a stoichiometric composition results in smooth and dense thin-film morphologies, which are crucial for optimizing SnS thin films for device applications. These findings underscore the importance of compositional control for tailoring the morphology and electrical behavior of SnS, paving the way for more efficient SnS-based devices.

Title: Thermal emission of hydrogenated amorphous silicon microspheres in the mid-infrared
Authors: Roberto Fenollosa, Fernando Ramiro-Manzano
Abstract: Hydrogenated amorphous silicon microspheres feature a pronounced phononic peak around 2000 cm-1 when they are thermally excited by means of a blue laser. This phononic signature corresponds to vibrational modes of silicon-hydrogen bonds and its emitted light can be coupled to Mie modes defined by the spherical cavity. The signal is apparently quite stable at moderate excitation intensities although there appeared some signs pointing to hydrides bonds reconfiguration and even hydrogen emission. Above a certain excitation threshold, a phase change from amorphous to poly-crystalline silicon occurs that preserves the good structural quality of the microspheres.

Title: Addressing general measurements in quantum Monte Carlo
Authors: Zhiyan Wang, Zenan Liu, Bin-Bin Mao, Zhe Wang, Zheng Yan
Abstract: Among present quantum many-body computational methods, quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) is one of the most promising approaches for dealing with large-scale complex systems. It has played an extremely important role in understanding quantum many-body physics. However, two dark clouds, namely the sign problem and general measurement issues, have seriously hampered its scope of application. We propose a universal scheme to tackle the problems of general measurement. The target observables are expressed as the ratio of two types of partition functions $\langle \mathrm{O} \rangle=\bar{Z}/Z$, where $\bar{Z}=\mathrm{tr} (\mathrm{Oe^{-\beta H}})$ and $Z=\mathrm{tr} (\mathrm{e^{-\beta H}})$. These two partition functions can be estimated separately within the reweight-annealing frame, and then be connected by an easily solvable reference point. We have successfully applied this scheme to XXZ model and transverse field Ising model, from 1D to 2D systems, from two-body to multi-body correlations and even non-local disorder operators, and from equal-time to imaginary-time correlations. The reweighting path is not limited to physical parameters, but also works for space and time. Essentially, this scheme solves the long-standing problem of calculating the overlap between different distribution functions in mathematical statistics, which can be widely used in statistical problems, such as quantum many-body computation, big data and machine learning.

Title: Measuring collective diffusion properties by counting particles in boxes
Authors: Adam Carter, Eleanor K. R. Mackay, Brennan Sprinkle, Alice L. Thorneywork, Sophie Marbach
Abstract: The collective diffusion coefficient $D_\mathrm{coll}$ is a key quantity for describing the macroscopic transport properties of soft matter systems. However, measuring $D_\mathrm{coll}$ is a fundamental experimental and numerical challenge, as it either relies on nonequilibrium techniques that are hard to interpret or, at equilibrium, on Fourier-based approaches which are fraught with difficulties associated with Fourier transforms. In this work, we investigate the equilibrium diffusive dynamics of a 2D colloidal suspension experimentally and numerically. We use a "Countoscope" technique, which analyses the statistics of particle number counts $N(t)$ in virtual observation boxes of a series of microscopy images at equilibrium, to measure $D_\mathrm{coll}$ for the first time. We validate our results against Fourier-based approaches and establish best practices for measuring $D_\mathrm{coll}$ using fluctuating counts. We show that Fourier techniques yield inaccurate long-range collective measurements because of the non-periodic nature of an experimental image, yet counting exploits this property by using finite observation windows. Finally, we discuss the potential of our method to advance our understanding of collective properties in suspensions, particularly the role of hydrodynamic interactions.

Title: Symmetry-Based Real-Space Framework for Realizing Flat Bands and Unveiling Nodal-Line Touchings
Authors: Rui-Heng Liu, Xin Liu
Abstract: Flat band (FB) systems provide ideal playgrounds for studying correlation physics, whereas multi-orbital characteristics in real materials are distinguished from most simple FB models. Here, we propose a systematic and versatile framework for FB constructions in tight-binding (TB) models based on symmetric compact localized states (CLSs), integrating lattice and orbital degrees of freedom. We first demonstrate that any CLS can be symmetrized into a representation of the point group, which remains valid for high orbitals with finite spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Second, we determine the candidate CLS sites according to lattice symmetry, and simplify the hopping as a linear mapping between two Hilbert spaces: one of CLS sites and another of their adjacent sites. The existence of FBs depends on a non-empty kernel of the mapping. Finally, we distinguish eigenstates in the kernel to qualify as a CLS. To illustrate the versatility of our framework, we construct three representative FB models: one in two dimensions (2D) and the rest in three dimensions (3D). All of them lack special lattice structures and incorporate high orbitals. Notably, the 3D FBs can exhibit not only band touchings at points but also along lines, a feature of significant physical interest. For a comprehensive understanding, we derive a concise criterion for determining band touchings, which provides a natural explanation for the occurrence of both gapped and gapless FBs. By unifying symmetry principles in real space, our work offers a systematic approach to constructing FBs across diverse lattice systems. This framework opens new avenues for understanding and engineering FB systems, with potential implications for correlated quantum phenomena and exotic phases of matter.

Title: Infinite variety of thermodynamic speed limits with general activities

Abstract: Activity, which represents the kinetic property of dynamics, plays a central role in obtaining thermodynamic speed limits (TSLs). In this paper, we discuss a unified framework that provides the existing TSLs based on different activities such as dynamical activity and dynamical state mobility. This unification is based on generalized means that include standard means such as the arithmetic, logarithmic, and geometric means, the first two of which respectively correspond to the dynamical activity and the dynamical state mobility. We also derive an infinite variety of TSLs for Markov jump processes and deterministic chemical reaction networks using different activities. The lower bound on the entropy production given by each TSL provides the minimum dissipation achievable by a conservative force. We numerically and analytically discuss the tightness of the lower bounds on the EPR in the various TSLs.

Title: From non-equilibrium Green's functions to Lattice Wigner: A toy model for quantum nanofluidics simulations
Authors: S. Succi, M. Lauricella, A. Tiribocchi
Abstract: Recent experiments of fluid transport in nano-channels have shown evidence of a coupling between charge-fluctuations in polar fluids and electronic excitations in graphene solids, which may lead to a significant reduction of friction a phenomenon dubbed "negative quantum friction". In this paper, we present a semi-classical mesoscale Boltzmann-Wigner lattice kinetic model of quantum- nanoscale transport and perform a numerical study of the effects of the quantum interactions on the evolution of a one-dimensional nano-fluid subject to a periodic external potential. It is shown that the effects of quantum fluctuations become visible once the quantum length scale (Fermi wavelength) of the quasiparticles becomes comparable to the lengthscale of the external potential. Under such conditions, quantum fluctuations are mostly felt on the odd kinetic moments, while the even ones remain nearly unaffected because they are "protected" by thermal fluctuations. It is hoped that the present Boltzmann-Wigner lattice model and extensions thereof may offer a useful tool for the computer simulation of quantum-nanofluidic transport phenomena at scales of engineering relevance.

Title: A microstructural model of transversely isotropic, fibre-reinforced hydrogels
Authors: Matthew G. Hennessy, Tom Shearer, Axel C. Moore
Abstract: Fibre-reinforced hydrogels are promising materials for biomedical applications due to their strength, toughness, and tunability. However, it remains unclear how to design fibre-reinforced hydrogels for use in specific applications due to the lack of a flexible modelling framework that can predict and hence optimise their behaviour. In this paper, we present a microstructural model for transversely isotropic fibre-reinforced hydrogels that captures the specific geometry of the fibre network. The model also accounts for slack in the initial fibre network that is gradually removed upon deformation. The mechanical model for the fibre network is coupled to a nonlinear poroelastic model for the hydrogel matrix that accounts for osmotic stress. By comparing the model predictions to data from unconfined compression experiments, we show that the model can capture J-shaped stress-strain curves and time-dependent creep responses. We showcase how the model can be used to guide the design of materials for artificial cartilage by exploring how to maximise interstitial fluid pressure. We find that fluid pressurisation can be increased by using stiffer fibres, removing slack from the fibre network, and reducing the Young's modulus of the hydrogel matrix. Finally, a high-level and open-source Python package has been developed for simulating unconfined compression experiments using the model.

Title: Complex Frequency Detection in a Subsystem
Authors: Juntao Huang, Jiangping Hu, Zhesen Yang
Abstract: In this study, we systematically explore the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) and its associated complex-frequency detection in the context of a frequency-dependent non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. This Hamiltonian arises from the self-energy correction of the subsystem and can be calculated exactly within our theoretical model, without the need for any approximations. Additionally, complex frequency detection, which encompasses complex frequency excitation, synthesis, and fingerprint, enables us to detect the physical responses induced by the complex driving frequencies. Our calculations reveal that both complex frequency excitation and synthesis are incompatible with the non-Hermitian approximation and are unable to characterize the presence or abscence of the NHSE. In contrast, the complex-frequency fingerprint successfully detects the novel responses induced by the NHSE through the introduction of a double-frequency Green's function. Our work provides a platform for studying non-Hermitian physics and their novel response in quantum systems rigorously without relying on any approximations.

Title: Periodic phase slips and frequency comb generation at tunable microwave frequencies in superconducting diabolo structures
Authors: Axel J. M. Deenen, Dirk Grundler
Abstract: Superconductors are characterized by macroscopic phase coherence and have enabled cryogenic electronics and quantum technologies. Recent advances in 3D nanofabrication now offer possibilities for tuning functional properties relevant for on-chip 3D integration of superconductors. However, non-equilibrium phenomena in 3D nanostructures exposed to transport currents remain largeley unexplored. Here, we employ numerical simulations to investigate phase slips -- discrete $2\pi$ jumps in the phase of the superconducting order parameter -- in a tubular Nb superconductor with a central constriction, which is subjected to both direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC) transport currents. We find that under DC drive, the system stabilizes periodic phase slips, resulting in GHz voltage oscillations. Introducing an additional AC frequency modulation generates microwave frequency combs which depend characteristically on the interaction between moving vortices and phase slips. Our findings open avenues for developing on-chip frequency comb generators in 3D cryoelectronics.

Title: Efficient optimization and conceptual barriers in variational finite Projected Entangled-Pair States
Authors: Daniel Alcalde Puente, Erik Lennart Weerda, Konrad Schröder, Matteo Rizzi
Abstract: Projected entangled pair states (PEPS) on finite two-dimensional lattices are a natural ansatz for representing ground states of local many-body Hamiltonians, as they inherently satisfy the boundary law of entanglement entropy. In this paper, we propose the optimization of PEPS via an improved formulation of the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP), namely the minimum-step stochastic-reconfguration scheme recently introduced for neural quantum states. We further discuss possible numerical issues that might arise in such a sampling-based approach. In this context, investigate the entanglement properties of random PEPS and find an entanglement phase transition. We note that on one side of this transition, we can identify positive random tensors as product states. To demonstrate the power of the framework described in this paper, we apply the PEPS to study the notoriously challenging chiral spin liquids. Moreover, we exhibit our approach's capability to naturally handle long-range interactions by exploring the phase diagram of Rydberg atom arrays with long-range interactions. We further provide parallelized easy-to-use code, allowing the straightforward application of our method to general Hamiltonians composed of local interaction terms.

Title: A control variate method for threshold crossing probabilities of plastic deformation driven by transient coloured noise
Authors: Harry L.F. Ip, Charlie Mathey, Laurent Mertz, Jonathan Wylie
Abstract: We propose a hybrid method combining partial differential equation (PDE) and Monte Carlo (MC) techniques to obtain efficient estimates of statistics for plastic deformation related to kinematic hardening models driven by transient coloured noise. Our approach employs a control variate strategy inspired by [CPAM, 75 (3), 455-492, 2022] and relies on a class of PDEs with non-standard boundary conditions, which we derive here. The solutions of those PDEs represent the statistics of models driven by transient white noise and are significantly easier to solve than the coloured noise version. We apply our method to threshold-crossing probabilities, which are used as failure criteria known as ultimate and serviceability limit states under non-stationary excitation. Our contribution provides solid grounds for such calculations and is significantly more computationally efficient in terms of variance reduction compared to standard MC simulations.

Title: Characterization of Nuclear and Magnetic Structures of Wolframite-Type MgReO4 and ZnReO4
Authors: Ugne Miniotaite, Ola K. Forslund, Elisabetta Nocerino, Yuqing Ge, Frank Elson, Michael Sannemo, Hiroya Sakurai, Jun Sugiyama, Hubertus Leutkens, Toru Ishigaki, Takafumi Hawai, Rasmus Palm, Chennan Wang, Yasmine Sassa, David W. Tam, Martin Månsson
Abstract: We utilized high-pressure methods to synthesize the oxides AReO$4$ (A=Zn, Mg) and characterized their crystal structures as monoclinic wolframite-type. By combining muon spin spectroscopy ($\mu^+$SR) with DFT calculations for muon stopping sites, we identify two possible magnetic spin structures for both compounds: $\Gamma_3$ with the propagation vector $\mathbf{k} = (0,1/2,0)$ and $\Gamma_4$ with $\mathbf{k} = (0,0,0)$. In both cases, the magnetic moments are canted from the principal axes within the $ac$-plane. The ordered moment of the proposed structures is $\mathbf{0.29(5)~\mu\mathrm{B}}$ for $\Gamma_3$ and $\mathbf{0.25(8)~\mu_\mathrm{B}}$ for $\Gamma_4$. The low moment is consistent with the absence of a magnetic contribution to the neutron powder diffraction (NPD) spectra. Bond valence sum (BVS) analysis supports the oxidation state of Re being Re$^{6+}$ in the compounds, and we suggest that a combination of $t_\mathrm{2g}$ orbital splitting due to spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and $d$-$p$ orbital hybridization is responsible for the strongly suppressed ordered magnetic moment.

Title: Pseudo-Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble of Real Random Matrices
Authors: Sachin Kumar, Amit Kumar, S M Yusuf
Abstract: Here, using two real non-zero parameters $\lambda$ and $\mu$, we construct pseudo-Gaussian orthogonal ensembles of a large number $N$ of $n \times n$ ($n$ even and large) real pseudo-symmetric matrices under the metric $\eta$ using $ \mathcal {N}=n(n+1)/2$ independent and identically distributed random numbers as their elements and investigate the statistical properties of the eigenvalues. When $\lambda \mu >0$, we show that the pseudo-symmetric matrix is similar to a real symmetric matrix, consequently all the eigenvalues are real and so the spectral distributions satisfy Wigner's statistics. But when $\lambda \mu <0$ the eigenvalues are either real or complex conjugate pairs. We find that these real eigenvalues exhibit intermediate statistics. We show that the diagonalizing matrices ${ \cal D}$ of these pseudo-symmetric matrices are pseudo-orthogonal under a constant metric $\zeta$ as $ \mathcal{D}^t \zeta \mathcal{D}= \zeta$, and hence they belong to pseudo-orthogonal group. These pseudo-symmetric matrices serve to represent the parity-time (PT)-symmetric quantum systems having exact (un-broken) or broken PT-symmetry.

Title: Spectral Signatures of Vibronic Coupling in Trapped Cold Ionic Rydberg Systems
Authors: Joseph W. P. Wilkinson, Weibin Li, Igor Lesanovsky
Abstract: Atoms and ions confined with electric and optical fields form the basis of many current quantum simulation and computing platforms. When excited to high-lying Rydberg states, long-ranged dipole interactions emerge which strongly couple the electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom through state-dependent forces. This vibronic coupling and the ensuing hybridization of internal and external degrees of freedom manifest through clear signatures in the many-body spectrum. We illustrate this by considering the case of two trapped Rydberg ions, for which the interaction between the relative vibrations and Rydberg states realizes a quantum Rabi model. We proceed to demonstrate that the aforementioned hybridization can be probed by radio frequency spectroscopy and discuss observable spectral signatures at finite temperatures and for larger ion crystals.

Title: Eigenstate Correlations in Dual-Unitary Quantum Circuits: Partial Spectral Form Factor
Authors: Felix Fritzsch, Maximilian F. I. Kieler, Arnd Bäcker
Abstract: While the notion of quantum chaos is tied to random matrix spectral correlations, also eigenstate properties in chaotic systems are often assumed to be described by random matrix theory. Analytic insights into eigenstate correlations can be obtained by the recently introduced partial spectral form factor. Here, we study the partial spectral form factor in chaotic dual-unitary quantum circuits in the thermodynamic limit. We compute the latter for a finite subsystem in a brickwork circuit coupled to an infinite complement. For initial times, shorter than the subsystem's size, spatial locality and (dual) unitarity implies a constant partial spectral form factor, clearly deviating from the linear ramp of the random matrix prediction. In contrast, for larger times we prove, that the partial spectral form factor follows the random matrix result up to exponentially suppressed corrections. We supplement our exact analytical results by semi-analytic computations performed in the thermodynamic limit as well as with numerics for finite-size systems.

Title: Time-resolved Stochastic Dynamics of Quantum Thermal Machines
Authors: Abhaya S. Hegde, Patrick P. Potts, Gabriel T. Landi
Abstract: Steady-state quantum thermal machines are typically characterized by a continuous flow of heat between different reservoirs. However, at the level of discrete stochastic realizations, heat flow is unraveled as a series of abrupt quantum jumps, each representing an exchange of finite quanta with the environment. In this work, we present a framework that resolves the dynamics of quantum thermal machines into cycles classified as engine-like, cooling-like, or idle. We analyze the statistics of individual cycle types and their durations, enabling us to determine both the fraction of cycles useful for thermodynamic tasks and the average waiting time between cycles of a given type. Central to our analysis is the notion of intermittency, which captures the operational consistency of the machine by assessing the frequency and distribution of idle cycles. Our framework offers a novel approach to characterizing thermal machines with significant relevance to experiments involving mesoscopic transport through quantum dots.

Title: First- and second-order quantum phase transitions in the long-range unfrustrated antiferromagnetic Ising chain
Authors: Víctor Herráiz-López, Sebastián Roca-Jerat, Manuel Gallego, Ramón Ferrández, Jesús Carrete, David Zueco, Juan Román-Roche
Abstract: We study the ground-state phase diagram of an unfrustrated antiferromagnetic Ising chain with longitudinal and transverse fields in the full range of interactions: from all-to-all to nearest-neighbors. First, we solve the model analytically in the strong long-range regime, confirming in the process that a mean-field treatment is exact for this model. We compute the order parameter and the correlations and show that the model exhibits a tricritical point where the phase transition changes from first to second order. This is in contrast with the nearest-neighbor limit where the phase transition is known to be second order. To understand how the order of the phase transition changes from one limit to the other, we tackle the analytically-intractable interaction ranges numerically, using a variational quantum Monte Carlo method with a neural-network-based ansatz, the visual transformer. We show how the first-order phase transition shrinks with decreasing interaction range and establish approximate boundaries in the interaction range for which the first-order phase transition is present. Finally, we establish that the key ingredient to stabilize a first-order phase transition and a tricritical point is the presence of ferromagnetic interactions between spins of the same sublattice on top of antiferromagnetic interactions between spins of different sublattices. Tunable-range unfrustrated antiferromagnetic interactions are just one way to implement such staggered interactions.

Title: An operator algebraic approach to symmetry defects and fractionalization
Authors: Kyle Kawagoe, Siddharth Vadnerkar, Daniel Wallick
Abstract: We provide a superselection theory of symmetry defects in 2+1D symmetry enriched topological (SET) order in the infinite volume setting. For a finite symmetry group $G$ with a unitary on-site action, our formalism produces a $G$-crossed braided tensor category $G\mathsf{Sec}$. This superselection theory is a direct generalization of the usual superselection theory of anyons, and thus is consistent with this standard analysis in the trivially graded component $G\mathsf{Sec}_1$. This framework also gives us a completely rigorous understanding of symmetry fractionalization. To demonstrate the utility of our formalism, we compute $G\mathsf{Sec}$ explicitly in both short-range and long-range entangled spin systems with symmetry and recover the relevant skeletal data.

Title: A Universal Circuit Set Using the $S_3$ Quantum Double
Authors: Liyuan Chen, Yuanjie Ren, Ruihua Fan, Arthur Jaffe
Abstract: One potential route toward fault-tolerant universal quantum computation is to use non-Abelian topological codes. In this work, we investigate how to achieve this goal with the quantum double model $\mathcal{D}(S_3)$ -- a specific non-Abelian topological code. By embedding each on-site Hilbert space into a qubit-qutrit pair, we give an explicit construction of the circuits for creating, moving, and locally measuring all non-trivial anyons. We also design a specialized anyon interferometer to remotely measure the total charge of well-separated anyons; this avoids fusion, which would compromise fault tolerance. These protocols enable the implementation of a universal gate set proposed by Cui et al. and active quantum error correction of the circuit-level noise during the computation process. To further reduce the error rate and facilitate error correction, we encode each physical degree of freedom of $\mathcal{D}(S_3)$ into a novel, quantum, error-correcting code, enabling fault-tolerant realization, at the logical level, of all gates in the anyon manipulation circuits. Our proposal offers a promising path to realize robust universal topological quantum computation in the NISQ era.

Title: Transmon qutrit-based simulation of spin-1 AKLT systems
Authors: Keerthi Kumaran, Faisal Alam, Norhan Eassa, Kaelyn Ferris, Xiao Xiao, Lukasz Cincio, Nicholas Bronn, Arnab Banerjee
Abstract: Qutrit-based quantum circuits could help reduce the overall circuit depths, and hence the noise, when the system of interest has local dimension of three. Accessing second excited states in superconducting transmons provides a straightforward hardware realization of three-level systems, or qutrits, useful for such ternary encoding. In this work, we successfully calibrate pulse gates to a low error rate to obtain transmon qutrits. We use these qutrits to simulate one-dimensional spin-1 AKLT states (Affleck, Lieb, Kennedy, and Tasaki) which exhibit a multitude of interesting phenomena such as topologically protected ground states, string order and the existence of a robust Berry phase. We demonstrate the efficacy of qutrit-based simulation by preparing high-fidelity ground states of the AKLT Hamiltonian with open boundaries for various chain lengths. We then use ground state preparations of the perturbed AKLT Hamiltonian with periodic boundaries to calculate the Berry phase and illustrate non-trivial ground state topology. We further present scalable methods for preparing the AKLT state and computing its Berry phase, and use tensor network simulations to establish the advantage of qutrit-based implementation over qubit-based ones in the presence of noise. Our work provides a pathway toward more general spin-1 physics simulations using transmon qutrits, with applications in chemistry, magnetism, and topological phases of matter.

Title: Thermal Radiation Force and Torque on Moving Nanostructures with Anisotropic Optical Response
Authors: Juan R. Deop-Ruano, Alejandro Manjavacas
Abstract: Nanoscale objects moving relative to a thermal radiation bath experience a drag force due to the imbalance in their interaction with the blue- and redshifted components of the electromagnetic field. Here, we show that, in addition to this drag force, moving nanostructures with an anisotropic optical response experience a lateral force and a torque that substantially modify their trajectory. These phenomena emerge from the additional coupling between the electromagnetic field components polarized parallel and perpendicular to the trajectory, enabled by the anisotropic response of the nanostructure. This work unveils the intricate dynamics of anisotropic nanostructures moving in a thermal radiation bath.

Title: Thermodynamics of Hamiltonian anyons with applications to quantum heat engines
Authors: Joe Dunlop, Álvaro Tejero, Michalis Skotiniotis, Daniel Manzano
Abstract: The behavior of a collection of identical particles is intimately linked to the symmetries of their wavefunction under particle exchange. Topological anyons, arising as quasiparticles in low-dimensional systems, interpolate between bosons and fermions, picking up a complex phase when exchanged. Recent research has demonstrated that similar statistical behavior can arise with mixtures of bosonic and fermionic pairs, offering theoretical and experimental simplicity. We introduce an alternative implementation of such statistical anyons, based on promoting or suppressing the population of symmetric states via a symmetry generating Hamiltonian. The scheme has numerous advantages: anyonic statistics emerge in a single particle pair, extending straightforwardly to larger systems; the statistical properties can be dynamically adjusted; and the setup can be simulated efficiently. We show how exchange symmetry can be exploited to improve the performance of heat engines, and demonstrate a reversible work extraction cycle in which bosonization and fermionization replace compression and expansion strokes. Additionally, we investigate emergent thermal properties, including critical phenomena, in large statistical anyon systems.

Abstract: Anderson localization physics features three fundamental types of eigenstates: extended, localized, and critical. Confirming the presence of critical states necessitates either advancing the analysis to the thermodynamic limit or identifying a universal mechanism which can rigorously determine these states. Here we report the unambiguous experimental realization of critical states, governed by a rigorous mechanism for exact quantum critical states, and further observe a generalized mechanism that quasiperiodic zeros in hopping couplings protect the critical states. Leveraging a superconducting quantum processor with up to 56 qubits, we implement a programmable mosaic model with tunable couplings and on-site potentials. By measuring time-evolved observables, we identify both delocalized dynamics and incommensurately distributed zeros in the couplings, which are the defining features of the critical states. We map the localized-to-critical phase transition and demonstrate that critical states persist until quasiperiodic zeros are removed by strong long-range couplings, highlighting a novel generalized mechanism discovered in this experiment and shown with rigorous theory. Finally, we resolve the energy-dependent transition between localized and critical states, revealing the presence of anomalous mobility edges.

Title: Highly Entangled 2D Ground States: Tensor Network, Order Parameter and Correlation
Authors: Olai B. Mykland, Zhao Zhang
Abstract: In this article we present analytical results on the exact tensor network representations and correlation functions of the first examples of 2D ground states with quantum phase transitions between area law and extensive entanglement entropy. The tensor networks constructed are one dimension higher than the lattices of the physical systems, allowing entangled physical degrees of freedoms to be paired with one another arbitrarily far away. Contraction rules of the internal legs are specified by a simple translationally invariant set of rules in terms of the tesselation of cubes or prisms in 3D space. The networks directly generalize the previous holographic tensor networks for 1D Fredkin and Motzkin chains. We also analyze the correlation in the spin and color sectors from the scaling of the height function of random surfaces, revealing additional characterizations of the exotic phase transitions.

Title: Quantum Lamb model
Authors: Dennis P. Clougherty, Nam H. Dinh
Abstract: H. Lamb considered the classical dynamics of a vibrating particle embedded in an elastic medium before the development of quantum theory. Lamb was interested in how the back-action of the elastic waves generated can damp the vibrations of the particle. We propose a quantum version of Lamb's model. We show that this model is exactly solvable by using a multimode Bogoliubov transformation. We find that the exact system ground state is a multimode squeezed vacuum state, and we obtain the exact Bogoliubov frequencies by numerically solving a nonlinear integral equation. A closed-form expression for the damping rate of the particle is obtained, and it agrees with the result obtained by perturbation theory. The model provides a solvable example of the damped quantum harmonic oscillator.

Title: Twin-Polaritons: Classical versus Quantum Features in Polaritonic Spectra
Authors: Iren Simko, Norah M. Hoffmann
Abstract: Understanding whether a polaritonic phenomenon is inherently quantum or classical is essential for developing accurate models and optimizing experimental designs. We investigate this question in the context of polaritonic rotational-vibrational spectra and report a new feature, the twin-polariton, an additional splitting beyond the usual primary resonant polariton splitting that arises from light-matter entanglement. Through ab-initio calculations of HCl molecules and a corresponding model system coupled to a cavity, we demonstrate that the twin-polariton persists in the many-molecule case and follows the same linear dependence on coupling strength as the primary resonant polariton splitting. This finding reveals a novel mechanism to tune a quantum feature using a classical one, offering new insights into the fundamental nature of polaritonic systems.

Title: Communities in the Kuramoto Model: Dynamics and Detection via Path Signatures
Authors: Tâm Johan Nguyên, Darrick Lee, Bernadette Jana Stolz
Abstract: The behavior of multivariate dynamical processes is often governed by underlying structural connections that relate the components of the system. For example, brain activity which is often measured via time series is determined by an underlying structural graph, where nodes represent neurons or brain regions and edges represent cortical connectivity. Existing methods for inferring structural connections from observed dynamics, such as correlation-based or spectral techniques, may fail to fully capture complex relationships in high-dimensional time series in an interpretable way. Here, we propose the use of path signatures a mathematical framework that encodes geometric and temporal properties of continuous paths to address this problem. Path signatures provide a reparametrization-invariant characterization of dynamical data and, in particular, can be used to compute the lead matrix which reveals lead-lag phenomena. We showcase our approach on time series from coupled oscillators in the Kuramoto model defined on a stochastic block model graph, termed the Kuramoto stochastic block model (KSBM). Using mean-field theory and Gaussian approximations, we analytically derive reduced models of KSBM dynamics in different temporal regimes and theoretically characterize the lead matrix in these settings. Leveraging these insights, we propose a novel signature-based community detection algorithm, achieving exact recovery of structural communities from observed time series in multiple KSBM instances. Our results demonstrate that path signatures provide a novel perspective on analyzing complex neural data and other high-dimensional systems, explicitly exploiting temporal functional relationships to infer underlying structure.

Title: Optomechanical quantum bus for donor spins in silicon
Authors: Henri Lyyra, Cliona Shakespeare, Simeoni Ahopelto, Teemu Loippo, Alberto Hijano, Reetu Inkilä, Pyry Runko, Tero T. Heikkilä, Juha T. Muhonen
Abstract: Silicon is the foundation of current information technology, and also a very promising platform for the future quantum information technology. This is because the silicon-based qubits exhibit some of the longest coherence times and silicon is the underlying material for advanced photonics. In addition, photonics structures in silicon can be used to define optomechanical cavities where the vibrations of nanoscale mechanical resonators can be probed down to the quantum level with laser light. Here, we propose to bring all these developments together by coupling silicon donor spins into optomechanical structures. We show theoretically and numerically that this allows telecom wavelength optical readout of the spin-qubits and implementing high-fidelity entangling two-qubit gates between donor spins that are spatially separated by tens of micrometers. We present an optimized geometry of the proposed device and discuss with the help of numerical simulations the predicted performance of the proposed quantum bus. We analyze the optomechanical spin readout fidelity find the optimal donor species for the strain and magnetic field gradient coupling. We also study the gate fidelity of a two-qubit gate for a universal gate set and discuss future developments.
