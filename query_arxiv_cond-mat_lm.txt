Title: Tunable effective diffusion of CO2 in aqueous foam
Authors: Cécile Aprili, Gwennou Coupier, Élise Lorenceau, Benjamin Dollet
Abstract: Aqueous foams are solid materials composed of gases and liquids, exhibiting a large gas/liquid surface area and enabling dynamic exchanges between their fluid components. The structure of binary-gas foams, whose bubbles consist of a mixture of two gases having different affinities with the liquid, thus offers real potential for the dynamic separation of these gases at low cost. In single-gas foams, the foam structure evolves under the effect of gas flow induced by Laplace pressure differences, arising from heterogeneities in bubble size. This leads to the well-documented Ostwald ripening. In addition to these capillary effects, the structure of binary-gas foams can evolve under the effect of gas flow induced by partial (or osmotic) pressure differences, arising from heterogeneities in bubble composition. We experimentally investigate the shrinking of CO$_2$-laden 2D foams exposed to air, observing a crust of tiny bubbles at the front. We derive a non-linear diffusion model for the gas in the foam and propose a description of the whole foam as an effective, homogeneous medium, the key parameter being the gas permeability ratio across the foam's soap films ($\neq 1$ for CO$_2/$air). The effective diffusivity of the gas in the foam emerges from the coupling between foam structure and gas transport across soap films. We extrapolate it for various permeability ratios and show that it can vary continuously between the diffusivity of the gas in the liquid and that of the gas in the atmosphere, enabling tunable gas retention and release by controlling the composition of the atmosphere.

Title: Symmetry-Informed Graph Neural Networks for Carbon Dioxide Isotherm and Adsorption Prediction in Aluminum-Substituted Zeolites
Authors: Marko Petković, José-Manuel Vicent Luna, El\=ıza Beate Dinne, Vlado Menkovski, Sofía Calero
Abstract: Accurately predicting adsorption properties in nanoporous materials using Deep Learning models remains a challenging task. This challenge becomes even more pronounced when attempting to generalize to structures that were not part of the training data.. In this work, we introduce SymGNN, a graph neural network architecture that leverages material symmetries to improve adsorption property prediction. By incorporating symmetry operations into the message-passing mechanism, our model enhances parameter sharing across different zeolite topologies, leading to improved generalization. We evaluate SymGNN on both interpolation and generalization tasks, demonstrating that it successfully captures key adsorption trends, including the influence of both the framework and aluminium distribution on CO$_2$ adsorption. Furthermore, we apply our model to the characterization of experimental adsorption isotherms, using a genetic algorithm to infer likely aluminium distributions. Our results highlight the effectiveness of machine learning models trained on simulations for studying real materials and suggest promising directions for fine-tuning with experimental data and generative approaches for the inverse design of multifunctional nanomaterials.

Title: Entropic Order
Authors: Yiqiu Han, Xiaoyang Huang, Zohar Komargodski, Andrew Lucas, Fedor K. Popov
Abstract: Ordered phases of matter, such as solids, ferromagnets, superfluids, or quantum topological order, typically only exist at low temperatures. Despite this conventional wisdom, we present explicit local models in which all such phases persist to arbitrarily high temperature. This is possible since order in one degree of freedom can enable other degrees of freedom to strongly fluctuate, leading to "entropic order", whereby typical high energy states are ordered. Our construction, which utilizes interacting bosons, avoids existing no-go theorems on long-range order or entanglement at high temperature. We propose a simple model for high-temperature superconductivity using these general principles.

Title: Detection of anyon braiding through pump-probe spectroscopy
Authors: Xu Yang, Ryan Buechele, Nandini Trivedi
Abstract: We show that the braiding of anyons in a quantum spin liquid leaves a distinct dynamical signature in the nonlinear pump-probe response. Using a combination of exact diagonalization and matrix product state techniques, we study the nonlinear pump-probe response of the toric code in a magnetic field, a model which hosts mobile electric $e$ and magnetic $m$ anyonic excitations. While the linear response signal oscillates and decays with time like $\sim t^{-1.3}$, the amplitude of the nonlinear signal for $\chi^{(3)}_{XZZ}$ features a linear-in-time enhancement at early times. The comparison between $\chi^{(3)}_{XZZ}$, which involves the non-trivial braiding of $e$ and $m$ anyons, and $\chi^{(3)}_{XXX}$ that involves the trivial braiding of the same types of anyons, serves to distinguish the braiding statistics of anyons. We support our analysis by constructing a hard-core anyon model with statistical gauge fields to develop further insights into the time dependence of the pump-probe response. Pump-probe spectroscopy provides a distinctive new probe of quantum spin liquid states, beyond the inconclusive broad features observed in single spin flip inelastic neutron scattering.

Title: The Chirality of Phonons: Definitions, Symmetry Constraints, and Experimental Observation
Authors: Shuai Zhang, Zhiheng Huang, Muchen Du, Tianping Ying, Luojun Du, Tiantian Zhang
Abstract: Circularly polarized phonons with nonzero angular momentum (AM), also referred to as chiral phonons, have garnered increasing attention in recent studies. Many existing experimental/theoretical works identify chiral phonons based on pseudo-angular momentum (PAM) or the flipping of the polarization of the circularly polarized light (CPL) in the Raman scattering process. However, the accuracy and universality of these assumptions remain to be verified. Moreover, in condensed matter physics, symmetry strongly governs the scattering and interactions of phonons, quasi-particles, and external fields, profoundly affecting correlated physical phenomena. In this study, we first conduct an in-depth examination of the distinctions and interconnections among AM, PAM, helicity, and atomic motion--key characteristics inherent to chiral phonons--and then undertake a comprehensive study of phonon chirality, as well as their associated physical quantities, and experimental benchmarks under various magnetic point groups. By developing the symmetry-based framework for phonon chirality across magnetic point groups, we demonstrate that identifying chiral phonons solely through nonzero PAM or CPL polarization inversion is inadequate, challenging prior findings. This framework clarifies the relationship between symmetry and phonon chirality, revealing that phonon modes governed by different symmetries exhibit distinct experimental signatures, thereby advancing our understanding of these phenomena. Finally, experiments on five materials with distinct symmetries are conducted to validate our theoretical results. Supported by both theoretical rigor and experimental validation, our study represents a significant step forward in advancing research on symmetry-constrained phonons.

Title: Unexpected collapse of edge reconstruction in compressible Quantum Hall fluid within filling fraction range 2/3 to 1
Authors: Suvankar Purkait, Tanmay Maiti, Pooja Agarwal, Suparna Sahoo, Giorgio Biasiol, Lucia Sorba, Biswajit Karmakar
Abstract: The edge structure of a gate-defined compressible quantum Hall fluids in the filling fraction range 2/3 to 1 is studied using the three reconstructed $e^2/3h$ fractional edge modes of unity filling integer quantum Hall state. We find that the individually excited partially resolved $e^2/3h$ edge modes of the bulk state equilibrate completely even at higher magnetic field when passing through the gate defined compressible fluid with filling between 2/3 and 1. This result is unexpected because edge reconstruction at the smooth boundary is generally expected due to dominant incompressibility at filling 2/3 and 1/3. Recently such reconstructed edge mode has been reported for the compressible fluid in the filling fraction range 1/3 to 2/3. In contrary, equilibration of fractional edge modes in the compressible fluid within the filling fraction range 2/3 to 1 becomes faster with increasing magnetic field. This anomalous results will stimulate further investigations on edge structure in these complex many body systems.

Title: Machine Learning Potentials for Hydrogen Absorption in TiCr$_2$ Laves Phases
Authors: Pranav Kumar, Fritz Körmann, Blazej Grabowski, Yuji Ikeda
Abstract: The energetics of hydrogen absorption in C15 cubic and C14 hexagonal TiCr$_2$H$_x$ Laves phases is investigated for $0 < x \le 6$ with density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). The MLIPs are trained with configurations generated through a series of active-learning schemes. Basin-hopping Monte Carlo (BHMC) simulations based on the MLIPs predict minimum-energy hydrogen configurations, along with enthalpies of formation and hydrogen orderings. The obtained phase transformations at 0 K agree well with the experiments at low temperatures. The hydrogen solubility limits in the low-concentration $\alpha$ phases at 0 K are predicted to be $x = 1.0$ and $x = 1.5$ for the C15 and the C14 phases, respectively. At these concentrations, C15 TiCr$_2$H shows the $Cc$ monoclinic symmetry, while C14 TiCr$_2$H$_{1.5}$ shows the $Ama2$ orthorhombic symmetry, both of which have not been reported for this system. The first and the second hydride phases, i.e., $\beta$ and $\beta'$, at 0 K are found around $x = 3$ and $x = 4$, respectively, for both the C15 and the C14 phases. In the second-hydride $\beta'$ phases, C15 TiCr$_2$H$_4$ shows the $I4_1/a$ tetragonal symmetry, while C14 TiCr$_2$H$_4$ shows the $R\bar3c$ rhombohedral symmetry. Hydrogen repulsion are found to extend to edge-sharing interstices, affecting the hydrogen ordering. Furthermore, the $6h_2$ A$_2$B$_2$ interstices are found to be energetically substantially more preferable for C14 TiCr$_2$H$_x$ than the other A$_2$B$_2$ interstices at low hydrogen concentrations, influencing the hydrogen-occupation trend.

Title: Nanocrystal tuned ammonia gas sensing technique via impedance spectroscopy
Authors: Neha Sharma, Debanjan Bhattacharjee, Sunita Kumari, Sandip Paul Choudhury
Abstract: Ammonia is a harmful chemical hazard known for its widespread industrial use. Exposure to ammonia can cause environmental damage, human health hazards, and huge economic losses. Therefore, ammonia gas sensors are essential for detecting ammonia leaks to avoid serious accidental injury and death. In this study, we synthesize a nanostructured (WO3) n-type metal oxide semiconductor doped with a rare earth element-transition metal (Ce-Cu) via hydrothermal method for ammonia gas sensing application. Structural analysis was performed using XRD and FESEM. Further we investigate the optical properties via UV-visible spectroscopy, FTIR, and PL. We found that doping of (Ce-Cu) led to significant improvement in thermal stability for ammonia detection and selectivity performance compared to that pure one, across a wide frequency range. We believe that these studies will pave the way for exploring the use of Ce-Cu to improve the gas sensing properties of semiconductor-based gas sensors.

Title: Structural stability, elemental ordering, and transport properties in layered ScTaN2
Authors: Baptiste Julien, Ian A. Leahy, Rebecca W. Smaha, John S. Mangum, Craig L. Perkins, Sage R. Bauers, Andriy Zakutayev
Abstract: Some ternary TM nitrides are predicted to adopt layered structures that make them interesting for thermoelectric conversion and quantum materials applications. Synthesis of TM ternary nitride films by physical vapor deposition often favors disordered 3D structures rather than the predicted 2D-like layered structure. In this study, we investigate the structural interplay in the Sc-Ta-N material system, focusing on ScTaN2. We use a two-step combinatorial approach to deposit Sc-Ta-N films by RF co-sputtering and then process the resulting 3D-structured precursor with RTA. Synchrotron GIWAXS on films annealed at 1200 °C for 20 min reveals the nucleation of the layered structure (P63/mmc) within a composition window of Sc/(Sc+Ta) = 0.2-0.5. Analyzing the strong (002) superstructure reflection near 1:1:2 stoichiometry, indicative of long-range ordering, we estimate that 13.6% antisite defects are present in stoichiometric films. Interestingly, we find that the structure can accommodate large off-stoichiometry in the Ta-rich region (x < 0.5), facilitated by making an alloy with the nearly isostructural Ta5N6 compound that exists on a composition tie-line. Transport measurements on ScTaN2 reveal a nearly temperature-independent high carrier density (1021 cm-3), suggesting a heavily doped semiconductor or semimetallic character. The carrier mobility is relatively small (9.5 cm2V-1s-1 at 2 K) and the residual-resistivity ratio is small, suggesting that electrical conduction is dominated by defects or disorder. Measured magnetoresistance is indicative of weak antilocalization at low temperatures. We highlight the interplay between ScTaN2 and Ta5N6 in stabilizing layered structures, emphasizes the importance of cation order/disorder for potential tunable alloys, and suggests that ScTaN2 is promising platform for exploring electronic properties in a tie line of stoichiometry.

Title: Synthesis-related nanoscale defects in Mo-based Janus monolayers revealed by cross-correlated AFM and TERS imaging
Authors: Tianyi Zhang, Andrey Krayev, Tilo H. Yang, Nannan Mao, Lauren Hoang, Zhien Wang, Hongwei Liu, Yu-Ren Peng, Yunyue Zhu, Eleonora Isotta, Maria E. Kira, Ariete Righi, Marcos A. Pimenta, Yu-Lun Chueh, Eric Pop, Andrew J. Mannix, Jing Kong
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) Janus transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are promising candidates for various applications in non-linear optics, energy harvesting, and catalysis. These materials are usually synthesized via chemical conversion of pristine TMDs. Nanometer-scale characterization of the obtained Janus materials' morphology and local composition is crucial for both the synthesis optimization and the future device applications. In this work, we present a cross-correlated atomic force microscopy (AFM) and tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) study of Janus $\mathrm{Mo}_{\mathrm{Se}}^{\mathrm{S}}$ and Janus $\mathrm{Mo}_{\mathrm{S}}^{\mathrm{Se}}$ monolayers synthesized by the hydrogen plasma-assisted chemical conversion of $\mathrm{MoSe}_2$ and $\mathrm{MoS}_2$, respectively. We demonstrate how the choice of the growth substrate and the starting TMD affects the morphology of the resulting Janus material. Furthermore, by employing TERS imaging, we demonstrate the presence of nanoscale islands (~20 nm across) of $\mathrm{MoSe}_2$-$\mathrm{Mo}_{\mathrm{Se}}^{\mathrm{S}}$ ($\mathrm{MoS}_2$-$\mathrm{Mo}_{\mathrm{S}}^{\mathrm{Se}}$) vertical heterostructures originating from the bilayer nanoislands in the precursor monolayer crystals. The understanding of the origins of nanoscale defects in Janus TMDs revealed in our study can help with further optimization of the Janus conversion process towards uniform and wrinkle-/crack-free Janus materials. Moreover, our work shows that cross-correlated AFM and TERS imaging is a powerful and accessible method for studying nanoscale composition and defects in Janus TMD monolayers.

Title: Single [2]catenanes in solution forming ${\sf 4}$-plats: a combined field theoretical and numerical approach
Authors: Franco Ferrari, Marcin R. Piątek
Abstract: The statistical mechanics of [2]catenanes in a solution with constrained number of maxima and minima along a special direction (the height) is discussed. The interest in this system comes from the fact that, in the homopolymer case, it has analogies with self-dual anyon field theory models and has conformations that minimize the static energy and bear particular symmetries and properties. In the first part of this work we provide a procedure for deriving the equations of motion in the case of replica field theories in the limit of zero replicas. We compute also the partition function of the [2]catenane at the lowest order in the frame of the so-called background field method. In the second part the statistical mechanics of the system is investigated using numerical simulations based on the Wang-Landau Monte Carlo method. At equilibrium, independently of the temperature, it turns out that the conformations of the system are elongated in the height directions. The two rings composing the [2]catenanes have approximately the same heights and are aligned. The thermodynamic properties of the system are discussed and the results coming from the field theoretical approach are compared with those of the numerical simulations.

Title: Development of a Capacitance Measurement for Pulsed Magnetic Fields
Authors: William K. Peria, Shengzhi Zhang, Sangyun Lee, Vivien S. Zapf, Choonjae Won, Sang-Wook Cheong, Minseong Lee
Abstract: Capacitance measurements are crucial for probing the electrical properties of materials. In this study, we develop and implement a capacitance measurement technique optimized for pulsed magnetic fields. Our approach employs an auto-balancing bridge method, leveraging a high-bandwidth transimpedance amplifier to mitigate parasitic contributions from coaxial cables. This technique enables precise capacitance measurements in rapidly changing magnetic fields, as demonstrated in experiments on the magnetoelectric material NiCo$_{2}$TeO$_{6}$. The results reveal strong magnetoelectric coupling, including a pronounced hysteresis in capacitance that coincides with magnetization measurements and an enhanced energy dissipation peak at high sweep rates. Compared to traditional LCR meter measurements in DC fields, our method exhibits excellent agreement while providing additional insight into field-induced phase transitions. This work establishes a robust methodology for capacitance measurements in extreme conditions and opens new opportunities for studying multiferroic and correlated electron systems under high magnetic fields.

Title: Cavity-assisted magnetization switching in a quantum spin-phonon chain
Authors: Mohsen Yarmohammadi, Peter M. Oppeneer, James K. Freericks
Abstract: We propose a Néel magnetization switching mechanism in a hybrid magnon-phonon optical cavity system. A terahertz-pumped single-mode cavity photon couples to a spin-phonon chain, while the system dissipates energy via different baths. Our mean-field analysis reveals that the photon induces magnetization switching by generating strongly entangled magnon pairs with opposite momenta -- a feature weakly present in the cavity-free system. This switching occurs only at specific drive frequencies, namely at low magnon energies and near the upper edge (perpendicular modes) of the two-magnon band. Our results underscore the roles of laser fluence, damping, and photon loss in modulating the switching process, offering a promising route for cavity-assisted magnetization control in opto-spintronics.

Title: A Topological Superconductor Tuned by Electronic Correlations
Authors: Haoran Lin, Christopher L. Jacobs, Chenhui Yan, Gillian M. Nolan, Gabriele Berruto, Patrick Singleton, Khanh Duy Nguyen, Yunhe Bai, Qiang Gao, Xianxin Wu, Chao-Xing Liu, Gangbin Yan, Suin Choi, Chong Liu, Nathan P. Guisinger, Pinshane Y. Huang, Subhasish Mandal, Shuolong Yang
Abstract: A topological superconductor, characterized by either a chiral order parameter or a chiral topological surface state in proximity to bulk superconductivity, is foundational to topological quantum computing. As in other topological phases of matter, electronic correlations can tune topological superconductivity via modifications of the low-energy Fermiology. Such tuning has not been realized so far. Here we uncover a unique topological superconducting phase in competition with electronic correlations in 10-unit-cell thick FeTe$_{x}$Se$_{1-x}$ films grown on SrTiO$_{3}$ substrates. When the Te content $x$ exceeds $0.7$, we observe a rapid increase of the effective mass for the Fe $d_{xy}$ band, with the emergence of a superconducting topological surface state confirmed by high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy; however, near the FeTe limit, the system enters an incoherent regime where the topological surface state becomes unidentifiable and superconductivity is suppressed. Theory suggests that the electron-electron interactions in the odd-parity $xy^-$ band with a strong $d_{xy}$ character lead to an orbital-selective correlated phase. Our work establishes FeTe$_{x}$Se$_{1-x}$ thin films as a unique platform where electronic correlations sensitively modulate topological superconductivity, suggesting opportunities to use tunable electron-electron interactions to engineer new topological phases in a broad class of materials.

Title: Magneto transport of pressure induced flatbands in large angle twisted bilayer graphene
Authors: Ayan Mondal, Priyanka Sinha, Bheema Lingam Chittari
Abstract: Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) exhibits flat electronic bands at the so-called magic angle ($\sim 1.1^\circ$), leading to strong electron correlations and emergent quantum phases such as superconductivity and correlated insulating states. However, beyond the magic angle, the band structure generally remains dispersive, diminishing interaction-driven phenomena. In this work, we explore the equivalence between pressure-induced flatbands and the magic-angle flatband in large-angle TBG by systematically analyzing the role of interlayer coupling modifications under perpendicular pressure. We show that pressure-induced flatbands exhibit spatial localization similar to magic-angle TBG, with charge density concentrated in the AA-stacked regions. Furthermore, the Hall conductivity and magneto-transport properties under an external magnetic field reveal that these pressure-induced flatbands share key signatures with the quantum Hall response of magic-angle TBG. The obtained Hofstadter spectrum shows four consistent low-energy gaps across all twist angles under pressure, which align with the calculated Hall conductivity plateaus. Our findings suggest that pressure offers an alternative pathway to engineer flat electronic bands and correlated states in TBG, extending the landscape of tunable moiré materials beyond the constraints of the magic angle.

Title: Mapping the Second Landau Level PH-Pfaffian State to the Lowest Landau Level
Authors: Jian Yang
Abstract: Recently we proposed a state described by the second Landau level (SLL) projection of the antiholomorphic Pfaffian wavefunction as a candidate for the ground state of the 5/2 fractional quantum Hall effect. In this paper we provide a mathematical proof that, when mapped to the lowest Landau level (LLL), the aforementioned state, which we call the SLL PH-Pfaffian state, becomes exactly a LLL projected orbital angular momentum l = -3 pairing Pfaffian state, which we call the LLL antiholomorphic f-wave pairing Pfaffian state, or the LLL af-Pfaffian state for short. We further prove that there is also an exact mapping between the upstream neutral Majorana fermion edge mode of the SLL PH-Pfaffian state and that of the LLL af-Pfaffian state. However, we find that while there exists an upstream neutral boson edge mode in the LLL af-Pfaffian state, it has no mapped counterpart in the SLL PH-Pfaffian state.

Title: External-field-induced altermagnetism in experimentally synthesized monolayer $\mathrm{CrX_3}$ (X=Cl, Br and I)
Authors: San-Dong Guo
Abstract: Net-zero-magnetization magnets are attracting significant research interest, driven by their potential for ultrahigh density and ultrafast performance. Among these materials, the altermagnets possess alternating spin-splitting band structures and exhibit a range of phenomena previously thought to be exclusive to ferromagnets, including the anomalous Hall and Nernst effects, non-relativistic spin-polarized currents, and the magneto-optical Kerr effect. Bulk altermagnets have been experimentally identified, while two-dimensional (2D) altermagnets remain experimentally unexplored. Here, we take experimentally synthesized 2D ferromagnetic $\mathrm{CrX_3}$ (X=Cl, Br and I) as the parent material and achieve altermagnetism through external field. First, we achieve the transition from ferromagnetism to antiferromagnetism through biaxial strain. Subsequently, we break the space inversion symmetry while preserving the mirror symmetry via an electric field, thereby inducing altermagnetism. Moreover, through the application of Janus engineering to construct $\mathrm{CrX_{1.5}Y_{1.5}}$ (X$\neq$Y=Cl, Br and I), the phase transition from ferromagnetism to antiferromagnetism induced by strain alone is sufficient to trigger the emergence of altermagnetism. All six monolayers possess the symmetry of $i$-wave spin-splitting. The computational results suggest that $\mathrm{CrCl_3}$ can be readily tuned to exhibit altermagnetism through external field in experiment, thanks to its low strain threshold for magnetic phase transition. Our work provides experimentally viable materials and methods for realizing altermagnetism, which can advance the development of 2D altermagnetism.

Title: Time dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory for design of superconducting wire
Authors: Naoum Karchev
Abstract: In the present paper, we study the superconducting wire. It is known from Maxwell equations that the current creates magnetic field that suppresses superconductivity and wire starts to conduct with resistance. We consider the time dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory to resolve the problem. The solutions of the system of equations show that applied electric field, perpendicular to the axis of the wire and to the magnetic field restores superconductivity and wire starts to conduct without resistivity. We can increase the current to a new suppression of superconductivity and to restore superconductivity increasing the applied electric field. The aforementioned results permit us to conclude that the superconducting wire can transport a very strong current if the novel design discussed in the paper is applied.

Title: Extremely high excitonic $g$-factors in 2D crystals by alloy-induced admixing of band states
Authors: Katarzyna Olkowska-Pucko, Tomasz Woźniak, Elena Blundo, Natalia Zawadzka, Łucja Kipczak, Paulo E.

Molas
Abstract: Monolayers (MLs) of semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (\mbox{S-TMDs}) emit light very efficiently and display rich spin-valley physics, with gyromagnetic ($g$-) factors of about -4. Here, we investigate how these properties can be tailored by alloying. Magneto-optical spectroscopy is used to reveal the peculiar properties of excitonic complexes in Mo$_{x}$W$_{1-x}$Se$_2$ MLs with different Mo and W concentrations. We show that the alloys feature extremely high $g$-factors for neutral excitons, that change gradually with the composition up to reaching values of the order of -10 for $x \approx 0.2$. First-principles calculations corroborate the experimental findings and provide evidence that alloying in S-TMDs results in a non-trivial band structure engineering, being at the origin of the high $g$-factors. The theoretical framework also suggests a higher strain sensitivity of the alloys, making them promising candidates for tailor-made optoelectronic devices.

Title: Tailoring spin reorientation and magnetic interaction for room-temperature spintronics in Tb-Doped SmFeO3 single crystal
Authors: Mingzhu Xue, Xin Li, Shilei Ding, Qixin Li, Wenhao Di, Anhua Wu, Bin He, Shishen Yan, Wenyun Yang, Jinbo Yang
Abstract: Selective doping with different R-site ions in rare-earth perovskite RFeO3 compounds offers an effective way to achieve atomic-scale tuning of the complex exchange interactions. In this study, the spin reorientation temperature of Tb-doped SmFeO3 (Sm0.7Tb0.3FeO3) single crystal is lowered to approximately 350 K, making it more suitable for room-temperature applications. Notably, the magnetic compensation point is absent at low temperatures, and both R3+ and Fe3+ ion moments can be fully saturated under high magnetic fields, suggesting that Tb3+ doping drives the R3+ and Fe3+ sublattices toward ferromagnetic coupling. Moreover, the hysteresis loop along the a-axis transitions from a double triangle shape below the spin reorientation temperature to a rectangular shape above the spin reorientation temperature, and the nucleation field exhibits a strong dependence on both the measurement temperature and the maximum applied magnetic field. Above results can be explained by a modified two-domain model with mean field correction. The results of magnetic domain measurements indicate that the emergence of the double-triangular hysteresis loop is jointly determined by domain wall motion and the nonlinear response of the parasitic magnetic moment along the a-axis. These findings provide valuable insights and new materials for advancing the use of RFeO3 compounds in spintronics.

Title: Learning phases with Quantum Monte Carlo simulation cell
Authors: Amrita Ghosh, Mugdha Sarkar, Ying-Jer Kao, Pochung Chen
Abstract: We propose a new machine learning input data type, "spin-opstring", derived from Stochastic Series Expansion Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations. It offers a compact, memory-efficient representation of QMC simulation cells, combining the initial state with an operator string that encodes the state's evolution through imaginary time. Using supervised machine learning on two models, we demonstrate the input's effectiveness in capturing both conventional and topological phase transitions. Additionally, we conduct a regression task to predict superfluid density, which reflects non-local properties of the quantum system, and achieve good accuracy. These results validate the spin-opstring as an effective input for machine learning applications.

Title: Importance of bond exchange in MnC structural stability and half-metallic ferromagnetism: a comprehensive density functional benchmark study
Authors: Abdesalem Houari, Peter Bloechl
Abstract: Recently, a first successful synthesis of the unknown bulk manganese monocarbide (MnC) has been reported. Suggested as a potential superhard material, the compound is found to crystallize in the zincblende (B3) structure. In the present work, we report an exhaustive density functional investigation on structural, electronic and magnetic properties of MnC, using different levels of exchange-correlation approximations. We show that SCAN meta-GGA and PBE0r hybrid functional outperform GGA-PBEsol, HSE06 hybrid functional and the mean field DFT+$U$+$V$; in predicting correctly the experimental zincblende structure as the groundstate one. It is demonstrated that the bond exchange plays a crucial role in this stabilization. At theoretical equilibrium, hybrid functionals (PBE0r and HSE06) lead to a metallic behavior of MnC. Semilocal ones (PBEsol and SCAN) and mean field DFT+$U$+$V$, however, predict two opposite kinds of half-metallic ferromagnetism; opening a debate on the origin and the nature this behavior. If the latter is confirmed experimentally, MnC could be for importance as a spintronic material.

Title: A Falsifiability Test for Classical Nucleation Theory
Authors: Camilla Beneduce, Diogo E. P. Pinto, Lorenzo Rovigatti, Flavio Romano, Petr Šulc, Francesco Sciortino, John Russo
Abstract: Classical nucleation theory (CNT) is built upon the capillarity approximation, i.e., the assumption that the nucleation properties can be inferred from the bulk properties of the melt and the crystal. Although CNT's simplicity and usefulness cannot be overstated, experiments and simulations regularly uncover significant deviations from its predictions, which are often reconciled through phenomenological extensions of the CNT, fueling the debate over the general validity of the theory. In this study, we present a falsifiability test for any nucleation theory grounded in the capillarity approximation. We focus on cases where the theory predicts no differences in nucleation rates between different crystal polymorphs. We then introduce a system in which all polymorphs have the same free energy (both bulk and interfacial) across all state points. Through extensive molecular simulations, we show that the polymorphs exhibit remarkably different nucleation properties, directly contradicting CNT's predictions. We argue that CNT's primary limitation lies in its neglect of structural fluctuations within the liquid phase.

Title: TCSP 2.0: Template Based Crystal Structure Prediction with Improved Oxidation State Prediction and Chemistry Heuristics
Authors: Lai Wei, Rongzhi Dong, Nihang Fu, Sadman Sadeed Omee, Jianjun Hu
Abstract: Crystal structure prediction remains a major challenge in materials science, directly impacting the discovery and development of next-generation materials. We introduce TCSP 2.0, a substantial evolution of our template-based crystal structure prediction framework that advances predictive capabilities through synergistic integration of several key techniques into its major components. Building upon TCSP 1.0's template-matching foundation, this enhanced version implements three critical innovations: (1) replacement of Pymatgen with deep learning-based BERTOS model for oxidation state prediction with superior performance, (2) implementation of sophisticated element embedding distance metrics for improved chemical similarity assessment, and (3) development of a robust majority voting mechanism for space group selection that reduces prediction uncertainty. TCSP 2.0 also expands its template base by incorporating template structures from Materials Cloud, C2DB, and GNoME databases alongside the original Materials Project repository, creating a more comprehensive structural foundation. Rigorous validation across 180 diverse test cases of the CSPBenchmark demonstrates TCSP 2.0's exceptional performance, achieving 83.89% space-group success rate and 78.33% structural similarity accuracy for top-5 predictions, substantially outperforming both its predecessor and the competing modern CSP algorithms including CSPML and EquiCSP.

Title: Fluctuations and Correlations of Local Topological Order Parameters in Disordered Two-dimensional Topological Insulators
Authors: Roberta Favata, Nicolas Baù, Antimo Marrazzo
Abstract: Two-dimensional topological insulators are characterized by an insulating bulk and conductive edge states protected by the nontrivial topology of the bulk electronic structure. They remain robust against moderate disorder until Anderson localization occurs and destroys the topological phase. Interestingly, disorder can also induce a topological phase - known as a topological Anderson insulator - starting from an otherwise pristine trivial phase. While topological invariants are generally regarded as global quantities, we argue that space-resolved topological markers can act as local order parameters, revealing the role of fluctuations and correlations in the local topology under Anderson disorder and vacancies. With this perspective, we perform numerical simulations of disorder-driven topological phase transitions in the Haldane and Kane-Mele models, using supercells with both open and periodic boundary conditions. We find that short-scale fluctuations of topological markers vanish upon coarse-graining, except at the topological phase transition, where their correlation length peaks and large-scale fluctuations remain.

Title: A mean-field theory for heterogeneous random growth with redistribution

Abstract: We study the competition between random multiplicative growth and redistribution/migration in the mean-field limit, when the number of sites is very large but finite. We find that for static random growth rates, migration should be strong enough to prevent localisation, i.e. extreme concentration on the fastest growing site. In the presence of an additional temporal noise in the growth rates, a third partially localised phase is predicted theoretically, using results from Derrida's Random Energy Model. Such temporal fluctuations mitigate concentration effects, but do not make them disappear. We discuss our results in the context of population growth and wealth inequalities.

Title: Breaking a superfluid harmonic dam: Observation and theory of rarefaction flow, Riemann invariants and sonic horizon dynamics
Authors: Shashwat Sharan, Judith Gonzalez Sorribes, Patrick Sprenger, Mark A. Hoefer, P. Engels, Boaz Ilan, M. E. Mossman
Abstract: Dilute-gas Bose-Einstein condensates are a prime testbed for the study of superfluid hydrodynamics. In a channel geometry, these systems are known to host prototypical hydrodynamic effects such as shocks, rarefaction waves and solitons, forming a bridge between classical and quantum dynamics. Here, we present a combined experimental and theoretical study of the dry-bed dam-break problem in a channel geometry, a hallmark problem of nonlinear dynamics. Our setup extends the canonical setting by adding harmonic confinement, or an effective bathymetry, along the channel, further enhancing the richness of dynamics. We obtain an analytical solution of the 1D Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation for the harmonic dam-break problem that provides further insight. Experimentally, we characterize the flow by measuring its Riemann invariant coordinates and find good agreement with computations of the 3D GP equation as well as with the analytical solution. Our experimental observation of a sonic horizon, and the prediction of collisions between such horizons at longer times, offer an intriguing perspective for further studies.

Title: Magnetoelectric control of spin helicity and nonreciprocal charge transport in a multiferroic metal
Authors: Daiki Yamaguchi (1 and 2), Aki Kitaori (1 and 3), Naoto Nagaoka (2 and 4), Yoshinori Tokura (1, 2 and 5) ((1) Department of Applied Physics, The University of Tokyo, (2) RIKEN Center for Emergent Matter Science (CEMS), (3) Institute of Engineering Innovation, The University of Tokyo, (4) Fundamental Quantum Science Program, TRIP Headquarters, RIKEN, (5) Tokyo College, The University of Tokyo)
Abstract: A multiferroic state with both electric polarization ($P$) and magnetization ($M$) shows the inherently strong $P$-$M$ coupling, when $P$ is induced by cycloidal (Néel-wall like) spin modulation. The sign of $P$ is determined by clockwise or counterclockwise rotation of spin, termed the spin helicity. Such a multiferroic state is not limited to magnetic insulators but can be broadly observed in conductors. Here, we report the current-induced magnetoelectric control of the multiferroics in a helimagnetic metal YMn$_6$Sn$_6$ and its detection through nonreciprocal resistivity (NRR). The underlying concept is the coupling of the current with the toroidal moment $T \sim P \times M \sim (\hat{q} \times \chi_v) \times M$ as well as with the magneto-chirality $\chi_v \times M$, where $\hat{q}$ and $\chi_v$ being the unit modulation wave vector and the vector spin chirality, respectively. We furthermore observe an enhancement of NRR by the spin-cluster scattering via $\chi_v$ and its fluctuation. These findings may pave a way to exploration of multiferroic conductors and application of the spin-helicity degree of freedom as a state-variable.

Title: Solvation enhances folding cooperativity and the topology dependence of folding rates in a lattice protein model
Authors: Nhung T. T. Nguyen, Pham Nam Phong, Duy Manh Le, Minh-Tien Tran, Trinh Xuan Hoang
Abstract: The aqueous solvent profoundly influences protein folding, yet its effects are relatively poorly understood. In this study, we investigate the impact of solvation on the folding of lattice proteins by using Monte Carlo simulations. The proteins are modelled as self-avoiding 27-mer chains on a cubic lattice, with compact native states and structure-based Gō potentials. Each residue that makes no contacts with other residues in a given protein conformation is assigned a solvation energy {\epsilon}_s , representing its full exposure to the solvent. We find that a negative {\epsilon}_s , indicating a favorable solvation, increases the cooperativity of the folding transition by lowering the free energy of the unfolded state, increasing the folding free energy barrier, and narrowing the folding routes. This favorable solvation also significantly improves the correlation between folding rates and the native topology, measured by the relative contact order. Our results suggest that Gō model may overestimate the importance of native interactions and a solvation potential countering the native bias can play a significant role. The solvation energy in our model can be related to the polar interaction between water and peptide groups in the protein backbone. It is therefore suggested that the solvation of peptide groups may significantly contribute to the exceptional folding cooperativity and the pronounced topology-dependence of folding rates observed in two-state proteins.

Title: Energetic preference and topological constraint effects on the formation of DNA twisted toroidal bundles
Authors: Nhung T. T. Nguyen, Anh T. Ngo, Trinh X. Hoang
Abstract: DNA toroids are compact torus-shaped bundles formed by one or multiple DNA molecules being condensed from the solution due to various condensing agents. It has been shown that the DNA toroidal bundles are twisted. However, the global conformations of DNA inside these bundles are still not well understood. In this study, we investigate this issue by solving different models for the toroidal bundles and performing replica-exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations for self-attractive stiff polymers of various chain lengths. We find that a moderate degree of twisting is energetically favorable for toroidal bundles, yielding optimal configurations of lower energies than in other bundles corresponding to spool-like and constant radius of curvature arrangements. The REMD simulations show that the ground states of the stiff polymers are twisted toroidal bundles with the average twist degrees close to those predicted by the theoretical model. Constant-temperature simulations show that twisted toroidal bundles can be formed through successive processes of nucleation, growth, quick tightening and slow tightening of the toroid, with the two last processes facilitating the polymer threading through the toroid's hole. A relatively long chain of 512 beads has an increased dynamical difficulty to access the twisted bundle states due to the polymer's topological constraint. Interestingly, we also observed significantly twisted toroidal bundles with a sharp U-shaped region in the polymer conformation. It is suggested that this U-shaped region makes the formation of twisted bundles easier by effectively reducing the polymer length. This effect can be equivalent to having multiple chains in the toroid.

Title: Reinforcement Learning for Active Matter
Authors: Wenjie Cai, Gongyi Wang, Yu Zhang, Xiang Qu, Zihan Huang
Abstract: Active matter refers to systems composed of self-propelled entities that consume energy to produce motion, exhibiting complex non-equilibrium dynamics that challenge traditional models. With the rapid advancements in machine learning, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising framework for addressing the complexities of active matter. This review systematically introduces the integration of RL for guiding and controlling active matter systems, focusing on two key aspects: optimal motion strategies for individual active particles and the regulation of collective dynamics in active swarms. We discuss the use of RL to optimize the navigation, foraging, and locomotion strategies for individual active particles. In addition, the application of RL in regulating collective behaviors is also examined, emphasizing its role in facilitating the self-organization and goal-directed control of active swarms. This investigation offers valuable insights into how RL can advance the understanding, manipulation, and control of active matter, paving the way for future developments in fields such as biological systems, robotics, and medical science.

Title: Quantitative imaging of nonlinear spin-wave propagation using diamond quantum sensors
Authors: Kensuke Ogawa, Moeta Tsukamoto, Yusuke Mori, Daigo Takafuji, Junichi Shiogai, Kohei Ueda, Jobu Matsuno, Jun-ichiro Ohe, Kento Sasaki, Kensuke Kobayashi
Abstract: Spin waves propagating in magnetic materials exhibit nonlinear behavior due to the competition between excitation and relaxation at large amplitudes, providing an attractive platform for exploring nonlinear wave dynamics. In particular, spin waves with a non-zero wavenumber that carry momentum undergo nonlinear relaxation and experience wavenumber modulation in the nonlinear regime. We image the nonlinear spin-wave propagation in two yttrium iron garnet thin films with distinct spin-wave decay rates using a wide-field quantum diamond microscope. We obtain quantitative distributions of spin-wave amplitude and phase in varying excitation microwave strength. As a result, we observe a threshold in the spin-wave amplitude beyond which nonlinear effects become evident and confirm that this threshold is consistent with theoretical predictions based on four-magnon scattering for both samples. Moreover, as the amplitude of the spin waves increases, modulation of the wavenumber is observed across the field of view. We attribute this modulation primarily to the spin waves generated by multi-magnon scattering. Our quantitative measurements provide a pathway for visualizing nonlinear spin-wave dynamics and are crucial for deepening our understanding of the underlying mechanisms.

Title: Self-Similar Bridge between Regular and Critical Regions
Authors: V.I. Yukalov, E.P. Yukalova, D. Sornette
Abstract: In statistical and nonlinear systems, two qualitatively distinct parameter regions are typically identified: the regular region, characterized by smooth behavior of key quantities, and the critical region, where these quantities exhibit singularities or strong fluctuations. Due to their starkly different properties, these regions are often perceived as being weakly related, if at all. However, we demonstrate that these regions are intimately connected, a relationship that can be explicitly revealed using self-similar approximation theory. This framework enables the prediction of observable quantities near the critical point based on information from the regular region and vice versa. Remarkably, the method relies solely on asymptotic expansions with respect to a parameter, regardless of whether the expansion originates in the regular or critical region. The mathematical principles of self-similar theory remain consistent across both cases. We illustrate this connection by extrapolating from the regular region to predict the existence, location, and critical indices of a critical point of an equation of state for a statistical system, even when no direct information about the critical region is available. Conversely, we explore extrapolation from the critical to the regular region in systems with discrete scale invariance, where log-periodic oscillations in observables introduce additional complexity. Our findings provide insights and solutions applicable to diverse phenomena, including material fracture, stock market crashes, and earthquake forecasting.

Title: Coupling molecular spin qubits with 2D magnets for coherent magnon manipulation
Authors: Sourav Dey, Gonzalo Rivero-Carracedo, Andrei Shumilin, Carlos Gonzalez-Ballestero, José J. Baldoví
Abstract: Magnonics is an emerging field widely considered as a paradigm shift in information technology that uses spin waves for data storage, processing and transmission. However, the coherent control of spin waves in 2D magnets still remains a challenge. Herein, we investigate the interplay between molecular spins and magnons in hybrid heterostructures formed by [CpTi(cot)] and VOPc spin qubits deposited on the surface of the air-stable 2D van der Waals ferromagnet CrSBr using first principles. Our results show that different molecular rotation configurations significantly impact on qubit relaxation time and alter the magnon spectra of the underlying 2D magnet, allowing the chemical coherent control of spin waves in this material. We predict the feasibility of an ultrafast magnon-qubit interface with minimized decoherence, where exchange coupling plays a crucial role. This work opens new avenues for hybrid quantum magnonics, enabling selective tailoring through a versatile chemical approach.

Title: Penetration of surface effects on structural relaxation and particle hops in glassy films
Authors: Qiang Zhai, Hai-Yao Deng, Xin-Yuan Gao, Leo S.I. Lam, Sen Yang, Ke Yan, Chi-Hang Lam
Abstract: A free surface induces enhanced dynamics in glass formers. We study the dynamical enhancement of glassy films with a distinguishable-particle lattice model of glass free of elastic effects. We demonstrate that the thickness of the surface mobile layer depends on temperature differently under different definitions, although all are based on local structure relaxation rate. The rate can be fitted to a double exponential form with an exponential-of-power-law tail. Our approach and results exclude elasticity as the unique mechanism for the tail. Layer-resolved particle hopping rate, potentially a key measure for activated hopping, is also studied but it exhibits much shallower surface effects.

Title: Dewetting Dynamics of Unstable Lubricant Impregnated Surfaces in Liquid Environment
Authors: Abhishek Mund, Arindam Das
Abstract: This article outlines a thorough stability analysis by means of both theoretical and experimental modeling for Omni-phobic Lubricant Impregnated Surfaces (LIS). The liquid-repellent properties, particularly with regard to water and oil, have gained substantial attention due to their numerous potential applications. The theoretical section of this study focuses on the validation of mathematical models to understand the underlying principles driving the stability of Omni-phobic LIS. Theoretical insights about the interaction of surface texture, chemical composition, impregnated, and ambient liquid properties contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms that govern stability. A series of experiments were performed to understand better the stability of fabricated Omni-phobic LIS under cyclopentane and water environments, including viscosity and surface texture variations, especially post-spacing variation. The experimental results validate the theoretical predictions and provide valuable statistical information regarding possible model modification. The replaced oil or nucleation sites can be explained through CHNT. The analysis was further validated with experimentally observed nucleation sites. This confirms the accuracy of the nucleation predictions and supports the underlying theoretical model. According to the CLW model, the length of a liquid's penetration into a cylinder/square-shaped capillary is expressed as a square root of time. Our findings contribute to designing a stable LIS and then determining the model followed by an unstable one. The proposed MLW model validated the experimental results. In addition, these experimental data points fit the different capillary imbibition regimes such as inertial, early viscous etc. This contributes to the development of robust and durable solutions for practical applications.

Title: Optical lattice quantum simulator of dynamics beyond Born-Oppenheimer
Authors: Javier Argüello-Luengo, Alejandro González-Tudela, J. Ignacio Cirac
Abstract: Here, we propose a platform based on ultra-cold fermionic molecules trapped in optical lattices to simulate nonadiabatic effects as they appear in certain molecular dynamical problems. The idea consists in a judicious choice of two rotational states as the simulated electronic or nuclear degrees of freedom, in which their dipolar interactions induce the required attractive or repulsive interactions between them. We benchmark our proposal by studying the scattering of an electron or a proton against a hydrogen atom, showing the effect of electronic exchange and inelastic ionization as the mass ratio between the simulated nuclei and electrons (a tunable experimental parameter in our simulator) becomes comparable. These benchmarks illustrate how the simulator can qualitatively emulate phenomena like those appearing in molecular dynamical problems even if the simulated interaction occurs in two-dimensions with a dipolar scaling. Beyond the molecular implementation proposed here, our proposal can be readily extrapolated to other atomic platforms, e.g., based on fermionic Rydberg atoms.

Title: VacHopPy: A Python package for vacancy hopping analysis based on ab initio molecular dynamics simulations
Authors: Taeyoung Jeong, Kun Hee Ye, Seungjae Yoon, Dohyun Kim, Yunjae Kim, Jung-Hae Choi
Abstract: Multiscale modeling, which integrates material properties from ab initio calculations into device-scale models, is a promising approach for optimizing semiconductor devices. However, a key challenge remains: while ab initio methods yield diffusion parameters specific to individual migration paths, device models require a single set of effective parameters that capture overall diffusion. To bridge this gap, we present VacHopPy an open-source Python package for vacancy hopping analysis based on ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD). VacHopPy extracts an effective set of parameters for vacancy hopping: hopping distance, hopping barrier, number of effective paths, correlation factor, and jump attempt frequency, by statistically integrating thermodynamic, kinetic, and geometric contributions across all hopping paths. It also offers tools for tracking vacancy trajectories and for detecting phase transitions in AIMD simulations. The applicability of VacHopPy is demonstrated in three materials: face-centered cubic Al, rutile TiO2, and monoclinic HfO2. The effective parameters accurately reflect temperature-dependent diffusion behavior and show good agreement with previous experimental observations. Expressed in a simplified form suitable for device models, these parameters remain valid across a broad temperature range spanning several hundred Kelvins. Furthermore, our findings highlight the critical role of anisotropic thermal vibrations in overall diffusion, a factor frequently overlooked in other frameworks but inherently considered in VacHopPy. Overall, VacHopPy provides a robust framework for bridging atomistic and device-scale models, enabling more reliable multiscale simulations.

Title: Accelerating Surface Composition Characterization of Thin-Film Materials Libraries using Multi-Output Gaussian Process Regression
Authors: F. Thelen, F. Lourens, A. Ludwig
Abstract: Efficient characterization of surface compositions across high-dimensional materials spaces is critical for accelerating the discovery of surface-dominated functional materials. While X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy allows detailed surface composition investigation, it remains a time-intensive technique. In this work, it is demonstrated that Gaussian process regression can be used to accurately predict surface compositions from rapidly acquired volume composition data obtained by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, drastically reducing the number of required surface measurements. As a proof of principle, an exemplary system, the oxide Mg-Mn-Al-O, is synthesized as a composition-spread thin-film materials library and analyzed by high-throughput methods. We show that the surface composition of the entire library can be predicted with an accuracy of 96% with only 13 measurements, reducing the total measurement time by 277 h. This is a scalable and data-efficient solution for integrating surface analysis into materials discovery workflows.

Title: Many body quantum chaos and time reversal symmetry
Authors: Weijun Wu, Saumya Shivam, Amos Chan
Abstract: We investigate universal signatures of quantum chaos in the presence of time reversal symmetry (TRS) in generic many body quantum chaotic systems (gMBQCs). We study three classes of minimal models of gMBQCs with TRS, realized through random quantum circuits with (i) local TRS, (ii) global TRS, and (iii) TRS combined with discrete time-translation symmetry. In large local Hilbert space dimension $q$, we derive the emergence of random matrix theory (RMT) universality in the spectral form factor (SFF) at times larger than the Thouless time $t_{\mathrm{Th}}$, which diverges with system sizes in gMBQCs. At times before $t_{\mathrm{Th}}$, we identify universal behaviour beyond RMT by deriving explicit scaling functions of SFF in the thermodynamic limit. In the simplest non-trivial setting - preserving global TRS while breaking time translation symmetry and local TRS - we show that the SFF is mapped to the partition function of an emergent classical ferromagnetic Ising model, where the Ising spins correspond to the time-parallel and time-reversed pairings of Feynman paths, and external magnetic fields are induced by TRS-breaking mechanisms. Without relying on the large-$q$ limit, we develop a second independent derivation of the Ising scaling behaviour of SFF using space-time duality and parity symmetric non-Hermitian Ginibre ensembles. Moreover, we show that many body effects originating from time-reversed pairings of Feynman paths manifest in the two-point autocorrelation function (2PAF), the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC), and the partial spectral form factor - quantities sensitive to both eigenvalue and eigenstate correlations. We establish that the fluctuations of 2PAF are governed by an emergent three-state Potts model, leading to an exponential scaling with the operator support size, at a rate set by the three-state Potts model.

Title: Chiral symmetry and magnetism in a 3D Kagome lattice: RPt$_2$B (R = La and Nd) prototype crystals
Authors: C. E. Ardila-Gutiérrez, D. Torres-Amaris, Rafael González-Hernández, Aldo. H. Romero, A. C. Garcia-Castro
Abstract: Chirality in crystals arises from the exclusive presence of proper symmetry operations, such as rotations and screw axes, while lacking improper operations like inversion, mirror planes, and roto-inversions. Crystallographic chirality is expected to be coupled with magnetic responses in magnetically active chiral compounds. Therefore, this study investigates the interplay between structural chirality and magnetic ordering in the rare-earth platinum boride family, RPt$_2$B, where R denotes lanthanide elements. Our results show that the R sites structurally form a chiral three-dimensional Kagome lattice, which can lead to magnetic frustration resolved through chiral antiferromagnetic orderings in conjunction with chiral symmetry. Symmetry analysis reveals that these chiral antiferromagnetic states are low-energy states, competing with higher-in-energy (001) ferromagnetic configuration. We also identified Kramers-type Weyl points in the electronic structure without magnetic response. In the magnetically active chiral compound NdPt$_2$B, Zeeman splitting lifts degeneracies at the high-symmetry points; however, Weyl points persist due to the breaking of time-reversal (T) and inversion (P) symmetries. We also estimate the anomalous Hall conductivity, a measurable observable of the allowed topological features finding a value of $\sigma_{xy} = 293$ S$\cdot$cm$^{-1}$ comparable with another Kagome magnetic materials like Mn$_3$PtN and FeSn, for example. This study elucidates the intricate interplay among chirality, magnetism, and topology in rare-earth Kagome materials.

Title: Control of the magnetic hopfion lattice in helimagnet with the external field and anisotropy
Authors: Konstantin L. Metlov, Artem S. Tarasenko, Yulia A. Bezus, Maxim M. Gordey
Abstract: A generalized micromagnetic model of hopfions in a helimagnet with a two-dimensional (allowing both radial and azimuthal dependence) profile function is considered. Calculations confirm the elliptical stability of hopfions and the previously obtained analytical expression for the upper critical field of their lattice. Dependencies of the hopfion lattice periods on the magnitude of the applied external magnetic field and the uniaxial anisotropy constant of the material are obtained. It is shown that in an anisotropic helimagnet, the hopfion lattice has a layered (graphite-like) layout, which can be controlled by the external field and the uniaxial anisotropy.

Title: POINT$^{2}$: A Polymer Informatics Training and Testing Database
Authors: Jiaxin Xu, Gang Liu, Ruilan Guo, Meng Jiang, Tengfei Luo
Abstract: The advancement of polymer informatics has been significantly propelled by the integration of machine learning (ML) techniques, enabling the rapid prediction of polymer properties and expediting the discovery of high-performance polymeric materials. However, the field lacks a standardized workflow that encompasses prediction accuracy, uncertainty quantification, ML interpretability, and polymer synthesizability. In this study, we introduce POINT$^{2}$ (POlymer INformatics Training and Testing), a comprehensive benchmark database and protocol designed to address these critical challenges. Leveraging the existing labeled datasets and the unlabeled PI1M dataset, a collection of approximately one million virtual polymers generated via a recurrent neural network trained on the realistic polymers, we develop an ensemble of ML models, including Quantile Random Forests, Multilayer Perceptrons with dropout, Graph Neural Networks, and pretrained large language models. These models are coupled with diverse polymer representations such as Morgan, MACCS, RDKit, Topological, Atom Pair fingerprints, and graph-based descriptors to achieve property predictions, uncertainty estimations, model interpretability, and template-based polymerization synthesizability across a spectrum of properties, including gas permeability, thermal conductivity, glass transition temperature, melting temperature, fractional free volume, and density. The POINT$^{2}$ database can serve as a valuable resource for the polymer informatics community for polymer discovery and optimization.

Title: Amplitude mode at the superfluid-insulator transition on a random lattice
Authors: Vishnu Pulloor Kuttanikkad, Rajesh Narayanan, Thomas Vojta
Abstract: We study the superfluid-insulator quantum phase transition of interacting bosons by means of large-scale Monte Carlo simulations in the presence of both topological and generic quenched disorders. Recent work has demonstrated that the amplitude mode at this transition broadens and localizes in the presence of dilution disorder, whereas it remains a well-defined delocalized excitation for topological (connectivity) disorder. Here, we analyze the crossover between systems with purely topological disorder and systems with additional bond randomness to disentangle the roles that disorder and interactions play for amplitude mode localization. Specifically, we analyze the scalar susceptibility and its spectral density on both sides of the quantum phase transition. We also discuss the implications of our results for the potential observation of amplitude mode localization in experiments.

Title: Dynamics away from Equilibrium of a Disordered Binary Alloy
Authors: Aly Abuelmaged, Eric Dohner, Shang-Jie Liou, Herbert F Fotso
Abstract: We study the nonequilibrium dynamics of a binary disordered alloy when it is subjected to an interaction quench. Our study uses a nonequilibrium embedding scheme (DMFT+CPA) that combines the capacity of DMFT (dynamical mean field theory) to treat strongly correlated systems and the capacity of CPA (coherent potential approximation) to treat disordered systems, to effectively address the interplay of disorder and interaction for the nonequilibrium system. Our solution is applied on the equilibrium binary disordered and interacting alloy for the calculation of the density of states. This equilibrium density of states shows the modifications of the disorder-driven gap by the interaction and that of the interaction-driven Mott gap by the disorder. Next, we assess the relaxation of the system that is initially in equilibrium at a given temperature, and then abruptly has its interaction strength changed from zero to a finite value at which it is kept constant. The system undergoes a short time transient and then settles into a long-time state in a process that depends in a nontrivial manner on the disorder and interaction strength. In addition, we calculate the effective temperature of the system after it has gone through its initial transient and settled into its long-time state. The long-time effective temperature is increased with increasing final interaction strength. However, for a given final interaction, the final temperature can be tuned by the disorder strength over a broad range, with stronger disorder leading to lower temperature. Altogether, the results illustrate the nontrivial interplay between disorder and interaction for a binary alloy away from equilibrium.

Title: DC-driven separation of fractional flux quanta in two-band superconductors
Authors: Anton O. Pokusinkyi, Oleksandr V. Dobrovolskiy
Abstract: Two-band superconductors host vortices from superfluid condensates of different electron bands. These vortices carry a fractional flux quantum and attract each other, coalescing to form a composite vortex with the whole flux quantum $\phi_0$. However, due to the differences in viscosity and flux of the vortices across different bands, composite vortices may dissociate into fractional components. Here, we theoretically explore an approach to control the dissociation of composite vortices into fractional components and their separation into stationary and fast-moving ones through dc current and pinning strength variation. To this end, we numerically solve the dynamic equation of motion for a single dc-driven composite vortex in a periodic pinning potential. As the pinning strength increases, we observe a transition from depinning followed by dissociation in the weak-pinning regime to dissociation from the pinned state in the strong-pinning regime. Under moderately strong pinning, fractional vortices from one condensate may become immobile while those from the other may even move faster than the original composite vortex just before the dissociation. The predicted pinning- and dc-controlled separation of fractional flux quanta appeals for experimental investigation and potential application in fluxonic devices.

Title: Magnetoelectric training of multiferroic domains in Mn$_2$GeO$_4$
Authors: Naëmi Leo, Jonathan S. White, Michel Kenzelmann, Takashi Honda, Tsuyoshi Kimura, Dennis Meier, Manfred Fiebig
Abstract: We study the trilinear magnetoelectric coupling between ferroelectric, ferromagnetic, and antiferromagnetic domains in the spin-spiral multiferroic Mn$_2$GeO$_4$, imaging the evolution of domains under both magnetic and electric fields via optical second harmonic generation. Once activated, this trilinear coupling enables the highly repeatable inversion of an inhomogeneous ferroelectric domain pattern upon global reversal of the magnetization. We specifically consider the initial domain evolution from zero-field cooling and find that polarization and magnetization domains form independently when entering the multiferroic phase. From here, a field training process is required to obtain the domain inversion mentioned above. We explain this training behavior of the complex magnetoelectric coupling as a pathway from metastable to equilibrium domain patterns, a process relevant to understanding the magnetoelectric behavior in other multiferroic materials with highly interlinked coexisting order parameters.

Title: A semiclassical nonequilibrium Green's Function approach to electron transport in systems exhibiting electron-phonon couplings
Authors: Maicol A. Ochoa
Abstract: We formulate a semiclassical theory for electron transport in open quantum systems with electron-phonon interactions adequate for situations when the system's phonon dynamics is comparable with the electron transport timescale. Starting from the Keldysh non-equilibrium Green's function formalism we obtain equations of motion for the retarded and lesser electronic Green's functions including contributions due to the phonon dynamics up to second order in the electron-phonon coupling strength. The resulting equations assume that the system's phonon follow classical time-local dynamics with delta-correlated noise. We apply our method to the study of the charging/discharging of a periodically driven quantum dot, and a three-level model for a single-electron pump, analyzing the signatures in the transient current, electron population and process performance of the phonon dynamics. For these systems, we consider external harmonic driving of the phonon at frequencies comparable with the electron modulation, and different scenarios, varying electron-phonon coupling strength, coupling to the electron part of the system, and in phase and anti-phase driving. Our results illustrate that our method provides an efficient protocol to describe the effects of nuclear motion in ultrafast transient phenomena.

Title: Double commutator method for a two band Bose-Einstein condensate: superfluid density of a flat band superfluid
Authors: Yi-Cai Zhang
Abstract: In this work, we propose a double commutator method for a general two-band bosonic superfluid. First and foremost, we prove that the sum of the superfluid and normal densities is equal to the weight of the f-sum rule. This weight can be easily determined by analyzing the ground state wave function. Once we have determined the excitation gap of the upper band, we can calculate the normal density by evaluating the average value of a double commutator between the velocity operator and the Hamiltonian. As an application of this method, we investigate the superfluid density of a flat band Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Using the Bogoliubov method, we calculate the sound velocity and excitation gap, which allows us to obtain the normal and superfluid densities explicitly. Our findings indicate that the superfluid density is directly proportional to the product of the square of the sound velocity and the compressibility. Furthermore, the existence of a non-vanishing superfluid density depends on the form of the interaction. For example, in the case of U(2) invariant interactions, the superfluid density is zero. Additionally, we have observed that for small interactions, the superfluid density is directly proportional to the product of the interaction parameter and the quantum metric. The double commutator method indicates that the correction of the excitation gap by interactions is the origin of the non-vanishing superfluid density of a flat band BEC. Up to the linear order of the interaction parameters, all the results for the excitation gap, the normal and superfluid densities in a flat band BEC can also be obtained through a simple perturbation theory. Our work provides another unique perspective on the superfluid behavior of a flat band BEC.

Title: Modeling Framework to Predict Melting Dynamics at Microstructural Defects in TNT-HMX High Explosive Composites
Authors: Ethan Holbrook, Matthew P. Kroonblawd, Brenden W. Hamilton, H. Keo Springer, Alejandro Strachan
Abstract: Many high explosive (HE) formulations are composite materials whose microstructure is understood to impact functional characteristics. Interfaces are known to mediate the formation of hot spots that control their safety and initiation. To study such processes at molecular scales, we developed all-atom force fields (FFs) for Octol, a prototypical HE formulation comprised of TNT (2,4,6-trinitrotoluene) and HMX (octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine). We extended a FF for TNT and recasted it in a form that can be readily combined with a well-established FF for HMX. The resulting FF was extensively validated against experimental results and density functional theory calculations. We applied the new combined TNT-HMX FF to predict and rank surface and interface energies, which indicate that there is an energetic driver for coarsening of microstructural grains in TNT-HMX composites. Finally, we assess the impact of several microstructural environments on the dynamic melting of TNT crystal under ultrafast thermal loading. We find that both free surfaces and planar material interfaces are effective nucleation points for TNT melting. However, MD simulations show that TNT crystal is prone to superheating by at least 50 K on sub-nanosecond timescales and that the degree of superheating is inversely correlated with surface and interface energy. The modeling framework presented here will enable future studies on hot spot formation processes in accident scenarios that are governed by strong coupling between microstructural interfaces, material mechanics, momentum and energy transport, phase transitions, and chemistry.

Title: Twisted Nodal Superconductors
Authors: J. H. Pixley, Pavel A. Volkov
Abstract: Recent proposals for the realization of time-reversal symmetry breaking and topological superconductivity in twisted nodal superconductors have led to a surge of theoretical and experimental studies of these systems, marking one of the newest entries in the rapidly growing field of moiré materials. The interplay between order parameters of the separate layers makes twisted superconductors unique, leading to additional emergent phenomena in regimes usually not of importance in moiré physics, such as bulk interfaces and large twist angles. We review the physics of twisted nodal superconductors, highlighting both similarities and qualitative differences with other moiré platforms. While inspired by the rise of moiré materials, the field is anchored in studies of unconventional superconductivity preceding the moiré era, which we discuss in detail. In addition to summarizing the developments at the present stage, we present a detailed outlook on the major open questions in the field and some of the most exciting future directions.

Title: Superconductivity in High-Entropy Antimonide M$_{1-x}$Pt$_x$Sb (M = equimolar Ru, Rh, Pd, and Ir)
Authors: Daigorou Hirai, Naoto Uematsu, Koh Saitoh, Naoyuki Katayama, Koshi Takenaka
Abstract: The high-entropy concept was applied to the synthesis of transition-metal antimonides, M1-xPtxSb (M = equimolar Ru, Rh, Pd, and Ir). High-entropy antimonide samples crystallized in a pseudo-hexagonal NiAs-type crystal structure with a P63/mmc space group were successfully synthesized through a conventional solid-state reaction and subsequent quenching. A detailed investigation of the composition and equilibration conditions confirmed the reversible phase transition between a multi-phase state at low temperature and an entropy-driven single-phase solid solution at high temperatures. Electrical resistivity, magnetization, and heat capacity measurements of single-phase M1-xPtxSb (x = 0.2) samples revealed a bulk superconducting transition at 2.15(2) K. This study demonstrates that the high-entropy concept provides numerous opportunities for the discovery of new functional materials such as superconductors.

Authors: Daigorou Hirai
Abstract: Heteroanionic compounds, which contain two or more types of anions, have emerged as a promising class of materials with diverse properties and functionalities. In this paper, I review the experimental findings on Ca3ReO5Cl2 and related com-pounds that exhibit remarkable pleochroism and novel quantum magnetism. I discuss how the heteroanionic coordination affects the optical and magnetic properties by modulating the d-orbital states of the transition metal ions and then compare these materials with other heteroanionic and monoanionic compounds and highlight the potential of A3MO5X2 materials for future exploration of materials and phenomena.

Title: The limits of knowledge in classical physics resemble the quantum uncertainty relation
Authors: David Theurel
Abstract: Building upon a recent analysis of the measurement process in Hamiltonian mechanics, this article investigates the Bayesian epistemology of classical physics -- the landscape of accessible probability distributions over phase space. I prove a thermodynamic limitation on the information that can be obtained about a classical system by means of observations: A direct analogue of the Robertson-Schrödinger quantum uncertainty relation controls the acquisition of information at the classical microscale. Central to this theorem is the notion of the "quality" of a measuring probe; a temperature-dependent strictly positive quantity that serves as a figure of merit of the probe, and that plays the role of $1/\hbar$ in the classical uncertainty relation. This study sets the stage for a new area of research into resource theories of classical measurement, in which high-quality measurements and high-information states of knowledge are the limited resources.

Title: Vapor-mediated wetting and imbibition control on micropatterned surfaces
Authors: Ze Xu, Raphael Saiseau, Olinka Ramírez Soto, Stefan Karpitschka
Abstract: Wetting of micropatterned surfaces is ubiquitous in nature and key to many technological applications like spray cooling, inkjet printing, and semiconductor processing. Overcoming the intrinsic, chemistry- and topography-governed wetting behaviors often requires specific materials which limits applicability. Here, we show that spreading and wicking of water droplets on hydrophilic surface patterns can be controlled by the presence of the vapor of another liquid with lower surface tension. We show that delayed wicking arises from Marangoni forces due to vapor condensation, competing with the capillary wicking force of the surface topography. Thereby, macroscopic droplets can be brought into an effective apparent wetting behavior, decoupled from the surface topography, but coexisting with a wicking film, cloaking the pattern. We demonstrate how modulating the vapor concentration in space and time may guide droplets across patterns and even extract imbibed liquids, devising new strategies for coating, cleaning and drying of functional surface designs.

Title: Topological Electronic Structure and Transport Properties of the Distorted Rutile-type WO$_2$
Authors: Yuto Muramatsu, Daigorou Hirai, Mitsuaki Kawamura, Susumu Minami, Yoshitaka Ikeda, Takahiro Shimada, Keita Kojima, Naoyuki Katayama, Koshi Takenaka
Abstract: We elucidate the transport properties and electronic structures of distorted rutile-type WO2. Electrical resistivity and Hall effect measurements of high-quality single crystals revealed the transport property characteristics of topological materials; these characteristics included an extremely large magnetoresistance of 13,200% (2 K and 9 T) and a very high carrier mobility of 25,700 cm2 V-1 s-1 (5 K). First-principles calculations revealed Dirac nodal lines (DNL) near the Fermi energy in the electronic structure when spin-orbit interactions (SOIs) were absent. Although these DNLs mostly disappeared in the presence of SOIs, band crossings at high-symmetry points in the reciprocal space existed as Dirac points. Furthermore, DNLs protected by nonsymmorphic symmetry persisted on the ky = {\pi}/b plane. The unique transport properties originating from the topological electronic structure of chemically and thermally stable WO2 could represent an opportunity to investigate the potential electronic applications of the material.

Title: Paramagnetic half-moon shaped diffuse scattering arising from 3D magnetic frustration
Authors: Nelly Natsch, Tara N. Tošić, Jian-Rui Soh, Nicola A. Spaldin
Abstract: We use spin dynamics simulations to determine the origin of the unusual correlated diffuse scattering, characterised by half-moon shapes bridging the magnetic Bragg peaks, observed in the polarised elastic neutron scattering from manganese tungstate, MnWO\textsubscript{4}. We first fit a Heisenberg Hamiltonian with twelve nearest-neighbour exchange interactions and single-ion anisotropy to the experimental ground-state magnon dispersion. We then show via spin dynamics simulations that our model Hamiltonian both reproduces the experimentally observed half-moon features and captures their persistence into the paramagnetic regime. Moreover, we identify the three-dimensional, competing antiferromagnetic interactions driving this behavior. Our work complements earlier studies of half-moon-shaped signatures in pyrochlore and triangular structures, by providing insight into their origin in a zigzag chain geometry with three-dimensional competing exchange interactions.

Title: Colossal enhancement of spin transmission through magnon confinement in an antiferromagnet

Abstract: Since Felix Bloch's introduction of the concept of spin waves in 1930, magnons (the quanta of spin waves) have been extensively studied in a range of materials for spintronics, particularly for non-volatile logic-in-memory devices. Controlling magnons in conventional antiferromagnets and harnessing them in practical applications, however, remains a challenge. In this letter, we demonstrate highly efficient magnon transport in an LaFeO$_3$/BiFeO$_3$/LaFeO$_3$ all-antiferromagnetic system which can be controlled electrically, making it highly desirable for energy-efficient computation. Leveraging spin-orbit-driven spin-charge transduction, we demonstrate that this material architecture permits magnon confinement in ultrathin antiferromagnets, enhancing the output voltage generated by magnon transport by several orders of magnitude, which provides a pathway to enable magnetoelectric memory and logic functionalities. Additionally, its non-volatility enables ultralow-power logic-in-memory processing, where magnonic devices can be efficiently reconfigured via electrically controlled magnon spin currents within magnetoelectric channels.

Title: Altermagnetism and Weak Ferromagnetism
Authors: I. V. Solovyev, S. A. Nikolaev, A. Tanaka
Abstract: Using a realistic model relevant to La$_2$CuO$_4$ and other altermagnetic perovskite oxides, we study interrelations between weak ferromagnetism (WF), anomalous Hall effect (AHE), and net orbital magnetization (OM). All of them can be linked to the form of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions. Nevertheless, while spin WF is induced by the DM vector components having the same sign in all equivalent bonds, AHE and OM are related to alternating-sign components, which do not contribute to any canting of spins. The microscopic model remains invariant under the symmetry operation $\{ \mathcal{S}|{\bf t} \}$, combining the shift ${\bf t}$ of antiferromagnetically coupled sublattices to each other with the spin flip $\mathcal{S}$. Thus, the band structure remains Kramers-degenerate, but the time-reversal symmetry is broken, providing a possibility to realize AHE in antiferromagnetic substances. The altermagnetic splitting of bands, breaking the $\{ \mathcal{S}|{\bf t}\}$ symmetry, does not play a major role in the problem. More important is the orthorhombic strain, responsible for finite values of AHE and OM.

Title: XY-Ashkin-Teller Phase Diagram in d=3
Authors: Alpar Turkoglu, A. Nihat Berker
Abstract: The phase diagram of the Ashkin-Tellerized XY model in spatial dimension $d=3$ is calculated by renormalization-group theory. In this system, each site has two spins, each spin being an XY spin, that is having orientation continuously varying in 2\pi radians. Nearest-neighbor sites are coupled by two-spin and four-spin interactions. The phase diagram has ordered phases that are ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic in each of the spins, and phases that are ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic in the multiplicative spin variable. The phase diagram exhibits two symmetrically situated reverse bifurcation points of the phase boundaries. The renormalization-group flows are in terms of the doubly composite Fourier coefficients of the exponentiated energy of nearest-neighbor spins.

Title: Exact Solution of the Frustrated Potts Model with Next-Nearest-Neighbor Interactions in One Dimension: An AI-Aided Discovery
Authors: Weiguo Yin
Abstract: The one-dimensional $J_1$-$J_2$ $q$-state Potts model is solved exactly for arbitrary $q$, based on using OpenAI's latest reasoning model o3-mini-high to exactly solve the $q=3$ case. The exact results provide insights to outstanding physical problems such as the stacking of atomic or electronic orders in layered materials and the formation of a $T_c$-dome-shaped phase often seen in unconventional superconductors. The work is anticipated to fuel both the research in one-dimensional frustrated magnets for recently discovered finite-temperature application potentials and the fast moving topic area of AI for sciences.

Title: Efficient defect healing of single-walled cabron nanotubes through $ \mathrm{C}_{2}\mathrm{H}_{2} $-assisted multiple-cycle treatment with air exposure
Authors: Man Shen, Taiki Inoue, Mengyue Wang, Yuanjia Liu, Yoshihiro Kobayashi
Abstract: Defects in single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) degrade their mechanical,electrical, and thermal properties, limiting their potential applications. To realize the diverse applications of SWCNTs, it is essential to enhance their crystallinity through effective defect healing. However, traditional thermal treatments typically require temperatures above 1800°C, which can alter the nanotube structure. Previously, defect healing of SWCNTs was achieved at a relatively low temperature of 1100°C, using C$_{2}$H$_{2}$ assistance, but the efficiency was limited. In this study, we developed a C$_{2}$H$_{2}$-assisted multiple-cycle process at an even lower temperature of 1000°C combined with air exposure, achieving highly efficient defect healing while preserving the nanotube structure. The combination of multiple-cycle treatment and air exposure between cycles was found to promote defect activation, suppress the formation of amorphous carbon, and enhance the effectiveness of defect healing. Additionally, we successfully healed commercially available bulk-scale SWCNTs (super-growth SWCNTs), noting that their healing behavior differed from lab-grown SWCNTs with smaller diameters synthesized from nanodiamond. The efficient and structure-preserved healing process developed in this study broadens the potential applications of high-quality SWCNTs, including flexible electronics, high-performance composites, and energy storage devices.

Title: Measurement-induced phase transitions for free fermions in a quasiperiodic potential
Authors: Toranosuke Matsubara, Kazuki Yamamoto, Akihisa Koga
Abstract: We study the dynamics under continuous measurements for free fermions in a quasiperiodic potential by using the Aubry-André-Harper model with hopping rate $J$ and potential strength $V$. On the basis of the quantum trajectory method, we obtain the phase diagram for the steady-state entanglement entropy and demonstrate that robust logarithmic system-size scaling emerges up to a critical potential strength $V_c/J \sim 2.3$. Moreover, we find that the measurement induces entanglement phase transitions from the logarithmic-law phase to the area-law phase for the potential strength $V< V_c$, while any finite measurement stabilizes the area-law phase for $V>V_c$. This result is distinct from the entanglement scaling in the unitary limit, where volume-law and area-law phases undergo a transition at $V/J=2$. To further support the phase diagram, we analyze the connected correlation function and find that it shows algebraic decay in the logarithmic-law phase, while it decays quickly in the area-law phase. Our results can be tested in ultracold atoms by introducing quasiperiodic potentials and continuously monitoring the local occupation number with an off-resonant probe light.

Title: Two-electron edge states in a double SSH-chain of quantum dots
Authors: Keyu Wang, Peihao Huang
Abstract: We study an interacting two-body model with adjustable spin tunneling in the context of the double SSH chains for a quantum dot system. We discovered that varying interaction strengths and spin tunneling significantly influence the properties of correlated edge states in the energy spectrum obtained through exact diagonalization. We observe that stronger interactions lead to longer decay lengths of these states. Conversely, the decay length decreases as the difference in intracell or intercell tunneling increases. Importantly, the decay length is strongly correlated with the dynamical behavior of two particles; specifically, an increase in decay length corresponds to a decrease in motion frequency. This conclusion is supported by the observation of the expectation value of coordinate operators of the particles.

Title: High-Throughput Exploration of NV-like Color Centers Across Host Materials
Authors: Oscar Groppfeldt, Joel Davidsson, Rickard Armiento
Abstract: Point defects in semiconductors offer a promising platform for advancing quantum technologies due to their localized energy states and controllable spin properties. Prior research has focused on a limited set of defects within materials such as diamond, silicon carbide, and hexagonal boron nitride. We present a high-throughput study to systematically identify and evaluate point defects across a diverse range of host materials, aiming to uncover previously unexplored defects in novel host materials suitable for use in quantum applications. A range of host materials are selected for their desirable properties, such as appropriate bandgaps, crystal structure, and absence of d- or f-electrons. The Automatic Defect Analysis and Qualification (ADAQ) software framework is used to generate vacancies, substitutions with s- and p-elements, and interstitials in these materials and use density functional theory to calculate key properties such as Zero-Phonon Lines (ZPLs), ionic displacements, Transition Dipole Moments (TDMs), and formation energies. Special attention is given to charge correction methods for materials with dielectric anisotropy. We uncover new defect-host combinations with advantageous properties for quantum applications: 28 defects across 11 isotropic and 2 anisotropic host materials show properties similar to the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond. Beryllium (Be) substitutional defects in SrS, MgS, and SrO emerge as particu- larly promising. These findings contribute to diversifying and enhancing the materials available for quantum technologies.

Marqués, Rafael Delgado Buscalioni, Johan Hofkens, Boris Louis
Abstract: Selective manipulation of particles is crucial in many fields, ranging from chemistry to biology and physics. Dielectrophoresis stands out due to its high selectivity potential and the absence of need for labels. To fully understand and control the phenomenon, observation of the dynamic of nanoparticles under DEP needs to be performed in the three spatial dimensions. However, not many microscopy approaches offer such capability at fast frame rates (>100fps) and high resolution. Here, we used widefield microscopy, to follow the spatiotemporal dynamics of fluorescently labelled polystyrene nanoparticles of 200 nm under positive and negative dielectrophoresis conditions. This real-time 3D imaging technique allows for single particle tracking, enabling super-resolved reconstruction of the DEP force and electrokinetic flows with unprecedented detail. We compare the differences for positive and negative dielectrophoresis conditions and rationalize these by direct comparison with dynamic modeling results. The framework shown here shows great promise to elucidate the frequency-dependent DEP behavior of nanoparticle, crucial for particle manipulation and sorting.

Title: Toward the detection of spin-vortex-induced loop currents in a single bilayer Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+δ}$ thin film and their possible use as qubits: Model calculations for three nano-island architecture
Authors: Hayato Taya, Yuto Takatsu, Hiroyasu Koizumi
Abstract: A theory for cuprate superconductivity predicts the existence of nano-sized loop currents called, ``spin-vortex-induced loop currents (SVILCs)''. In this wok, we first calculate magnetic fields produced by them in a single bilayer Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ (Bi-2212) thin film for the purpose of detecting the SVILCs. The estimated magnitude of the magnetic field at the point 10$a$ ($a$ is the lattice constant of the CuO$_2$ plane) above the surface could be in the order of 100mT; thus, they may be detectable by currently available detection methods. Next, we investigate the use of them as qubits (the ``SVILC qubits'') in an architecture composed of three nano-islands of the thin film; and consider the use of the detection of the magnetic field generated by the SVILCs as the qubit readout. We show there are a number of energy levels suitable for qubit states that can be manipulated by external current feeding, and the magnetic field generated by the SVILCs is large enough to be used for the readout.

Abstract: Coupled spins in semiconductor quantum dots are a versatile platform for quantum computing and simulations of complex many-body phenomena. However, on the path of scale-up, cross-talk from densely packed electrodes poses a severe challenge. While cross-talk onto the dot potentials is nowadays routinely compensated for, cross-talk on the exchange interaction is much more difficult to tackle because it is not always directly measurable. Here we propose and implement a way of characterizing and compensating cross-talk on adjacent exchange interactions by following the singlet-triplet avoided crossing in Ge. We show that we can easily identify the barrier-to-barrier cross-talk element without knowledge of the particular exchange value in a 2x4 quantum dot array. We uncover striking differences among these cross-talk elements which can be linked to the geometry of the device and the barrier gate fan-out. We validate the methodology by tuning up four-spin Heisenberg chains. The same methodology should be applicable to longer chains of spins and to other semiconductor platforms in which mixing of the singlet and the lowest-energy triplet is present or can be engineered. Additionally, this procedure is well suited for automated tuning routines as we obtain a stand-out feature that can be easily tracked and directly returns the magnitude of the cross-talk.

Title: Revealing quantum phase string effect in doped Mott-insulator: a tensor network state approach
Authors: Wayne Zheng, Jia-Xin Zhang, Zheng-Yuan Yue, Zheng-Cheng Gu, Zheng-Yu Weng
Abstract: We apply the fermionic tensor network (TN) state method to understand the strongly correlated nature in a doped Mott insulator. We conduct a comparative study of the $\sigma t$-$J$ model, in which the no-double-occupancy constraint remains unchanged but the quantum phase string effect associated with doped holes is precisely switched off. Thus, the ground state of the $\sigma t$-$J$ model can serve as a well-controlled reference state of the standard $t$-$J$ model. In the absence of phase string, the spin long-range antiferromagnetic (AFM) order is found to be essentially decoupled from the doped holes, and the latter contribute to a Fermi-liquid-like compressibility and a coherent single-particle propagation with a markedly reduced pairing tendency. In contrast, our TN calculations of the $t$-$J$ model indicate that the AFM order decreases much faster with doping and the single-particle propagation of doped holes gets substantially suppressed, concurrently with a much stronger charge compressibility at small doping and a significantly amplified Cooper pairing tendencies. These findings demonstrate that quantum many-body interference from phase strings plays a pivotal role in the $t$-$J$ model, mediating long-range entanglement between spin and charge degrees of freedom.

Title: Theory of hydrodynamic forces in electric double layers
Authors: C. Cramail, R. Lhermerout, E. Charlaix
Abstract: We present a theory of the hydrodynamic forces in the drainage flow of an electrolyte between a sphere and a plane with charged surfaces. Our theory considers a thin electrolyte film which is at all times in local equilibrium across its thickness. In addition to the usual lubrication force, we explicit the electro-kinetic force due to the transport of the diffuse electrical charges as well as the diffusio-kinetic force due to the transport of the excess ion concentration in the Electrostatic Double Layers (EDLs). Our general formalism covers both the case of non-overlapping EDLs and of overlapping EDLs. We study more specifically the mechanical impedance induced by an oscillatory motion of small amplitude of the surfaces. Among our main results, we show that the increase in damping due to the electro-kinetic effect is not monotonic with the surface charge, and we predict a diffusio-kinetic stiffness with a long-range decay in power minus four of the sphere-plane gap susceptible to overcoming the stiffness of the equilibrium Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek force. The comparison of our results with experiments could allow one to confront the theories of electrolyte transport in the Electrostatic Double Layers without adjustable parameters.

Title: $s_{\pm}$ pairing via interlayer interaction in La$_{2.85}$Pr$_{0.15}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ Thin Films under Ambient Pressure
Authors: Junkang Huang, Tao Zhou
Abstract: We demonstrate that interlayer \(s_{\pm}\)-wave pairing dominates superconductivity in La\(_{2.85}\)Pr\(_{0.15}\)Ni\(_2\)O\(_7\) thin films through self-consistent mean-field calculations. We further show that applying a perpendicular electric field breaks layer equivalence, generating nodal structures, Fermi arcs, and finite low-energy states in the \(d_{x^2-y^2}\) orbital. Our results quantitatively align with recent experimental observations for the superconducting gaps, and we propose experimental symmetry-breaking perturbations as a direct test for the interlayer pairing mechanism.

Title: He-Mg compounds and helium-driven nonmetal transition in metallic magnesium
Authors: Y. S. Huang, H. X. Song, Q. D. Hao, X. L. Pan, D. Wang, H. Wang, Y. F. Wang, Y. Sun, Hua Y. Geng
Abstract: The polymorphism and mechanism of helium compounds is crucial for understanding the physical and chemical nature of He-bearing materials under pressures. Here, we predict two new types of He-bearing compounds, MgHe and MgnHe (n = 6, 8, 10, 15, 18), being formed above 750 GPa by unbiased ab initio structure search. An unexpected bandgap is opened up in MgHe at as low as around 200 GPa. This is the first case of noble gas driven metal-nonmetal transition in all elements. The same mechanism is demonstrated also being applicable to other metallic elements, and making beryllium transform into a non-metallic state, a triumph that is impossible otherwise. Furthermore, the stability of the simple cubic phase of Mg (Mg-sc) is greatly enhanced by mixing with He, which lowers the critical pressure of pure Mg-sc from about 1.1 TPa down to 750 GPa to form ordered substitutional alloying phase of MgnHe on a simple cubic lattice of Mg. This is the first report on Mg-based noble gas substitutional alloy, in sharp contrast to the conventional wisdom that He preferring interstitial sites. The observed striking influences of He demonstrate the rich physics and chemistry of He-bearing compounds under ultra-high pressures.

Title: Can a ferroelectric diode be a selector-less, universal, non-volatile memory?
Authors: Soumya Sarkar, Xiwen Liu, Deep Jariwala
Abstract: Recent advances in silicon foundry-process compatible ferroelectric (FE) thin films have reinvigorated interest in FE-based non-volatile memory (NVM) devices. Ferroelectric diodes (FeDs) are two-terminal NVM devices exhibiting rectifying current-voltage hysteretic characteristics that enable self-selecting designs critical for high-density memory. We examine progress in FeDs based on CMOS-compatible HZO, AlScN, and emerging van der Waals ferroelectrics. While FeDs demonstrate promising ON/OFF ratios and rectification capabilities, they face persistent challenges including limited write-cycling endurance, elevated operating voltages, and insufficient read currents. We provide materials-focused strategies to enhance reliability and performance of FeDs for energy-efficient electronic memory applications, with emphasis on their unique self-rectifying capabilities that eliminate the need for selector elements in crossbar arrays for compute in memory applications.

Title: First-Principle Investigation On Chromium Decorated Graphene-based Systems for Hydrogen Storage
Authors: Pratyasha Tripathy, Hetvi Jadav, Himanshu Pandey
Abstract: Sorbent materials like Cr decorated 2D materials are explored among its storage options. 2D material like graphene has been used as it has a high surface to volume ratio. A comparative study is done with Cr adsorbed in defect-free and single vacancy defect graphene systems. Ab-initio calculations are performed with and without Van der Waals interaction to check the hydrogen storage efficiency. Efficiency is determined by calculating the binding energy of the system. The preferred range for binding energy for reversible hydrogen storage, as determined by the Department of Energy, US, is between 0.2-0.6 eV. This work also visualizes the thermal stability spectrum of the efficient materials at 300 K using molecular dynamics calculations, predicting their stability at room temperature.

Title: Semisuper Efimov effect induced by resonant pair exchange in mixed dimensions
Authors: Yusuke Nishida
Abstract: We introduce a new member to the class of semisuper Efimov effect, where infinite bound states emerge with their binding energies obeying the universal scaling law of $E_n\sim e^{-2(\pi n/\gamma)^2}$ for sufficiently high excitation $n\in\mathbb{N}$. Our system consists of a pair of two-component fermions in three dimensions at infinite scattering length, which furthermore interact with a boson confined in two dimensions so as to form a three-body bound state at zero energy. When another boson is added, exchange of the resonant pair of fermions between two bosons leads to the semisuper Efimov effect of such four particles with the scaling exponent $\gamma$ determined by the mass ratio of boson to fermion. If bosons live in three dimensions, infinite bound states do not emerge but some of them may survive for a large mass ratio, making our findings potentially relevant to two-neutron halo nuclei as well as ultracold atoms.

Title: Superconducting Spin-Singlet QuBit in a Triangulene Spin Chain
Authors: Chen-How Huang, Jon Ortuzar, M. A. Cazalilla
Abstract: Chains of triangular nanographene (triangulene), recently identified as realizing the valence-bond solid phase of a spin-$1$ chain, offer a promising platform for quantum information processing. We propose a superconducting spin-singlet qubit based on these chains grown on a superconducting substrate. Using the numerical renormalization group (NRG), we find a manifold of two lowest-lying, isolated spin-singlet states that undergo an avoided crossing. A qubit utilizing these states is thus protected from random-field noise and quasi-particle poisoning. We also introduce a mesoscopic device architecture, based on a triple quantum dot coupled to a superconducting junction, that quantum simulates the spin chain and enables control and readout of the qubit. An effective two-level description of the device is validated using time-dependent NRG.

Title: Dynamical Networking using Gaussian fields
Authors: Nadine du Toit (Department of Physics, Stellenbosch University), Kristian K. Müller-Nedebock (Department of Physics, Stellenbosch University, National Institute for Theoretical and Computational Sciences, Stellenbosch)
Abstract: A novel field theoretical approach towards modelling dynamic networking in complex systems is presented. An equilibrium networking formalism which utilises Gaussian fields is adapted to model the dynamics of particles that can bind and unbind from one another. Here, \textit{networking} refers to the introduction of instantaneous co-localisation constraints and does not necessitate the formation of a well-defined transient or persistent network. By combining this formalism with Martin-Siggia-Rose generating functionals, a weighted generating functional for the networked system is obtained. The networking formalism introduces spatial and temporal constraints into the Langevin dynamics, via statistical weights, thereby accounting for all possible configurations in which particles can be networked to one another. A simple example of Brownian particles which can bind and unbind from one another demonstrates the tool and that this leads to results for physical quantities in a collective description. Applying the networking formalism to model the dynamics of cross-linking polymers in a mixture, we can calculate the average number of networking instances. As expected, the dynamic structure factors for each type of polymer show that the system collapses once networking is introduced, but that the addition of a repulsive time-dependent potential above a minimum strength prevents this. The examples presented in this paper indicate that this novel approach towards modelling dynamic networking could be applied to a range of synthetic and biological systems to obtain theoretical predictions for experimentally verifiable quantities.

Title: Plasmons in N-layer systems
Authors: Taehun Kim, E. H. Hwang, Hongki Min
Abstract: In multilayer structures, the coupling between layers gives rise to unique plasmon modes, but analytic solutions are typically available only for bilayers due to the increasing complexity as the number of layers increases. We investigate plasmons in multilayer structures, including the effects of interlayer tunneling. By introducing the Coulomb eigenvector basis for multilayer systems, which can be solved exactly using Kac-Murdock-Szegő Toeplitz matrices, we analytically derive the long-wavelength plasmon dispersions both with and without interlayer tunneling. In the $N$-layer systems, we find that, in the absence of interlayer tunneling, the out-of-phase acoustic or charge neutral plasmon modes with linear dispersions ($\omega_\alpha\propto q/\sqrt{{1-\cos{\left(\frac{\alpha-1}{N}\pi\right)}}}$ for $\alpha = 2, 3, \cdots, N$) exist, while the in-phase classical plasmon mode exhibits its conventional dispersion ($\omega_1\propto \sqrt{q}$). When interlayer tunneling is present, the out-of-phase modes develop plasmon gaps that are governed by specific interband transitions, whereas the classical mode remains unaffected. These findings have broad applicability to general coupled-layer structures.

Title: Electronic structure of UGe$_2$ at ambient pressure: comparison with X-ray photoemission spectra
Authors: M. Samsel-Czekała (1), M. Werwiński (2), A. Szajek (2), G. Chełkowska (3), R. Troć (1) ((1) W. Trzebiatowski Institute of Low Temperature and Structure Research, Polish Academy of Sciences, Wrocław, Poland, (2) Institute of Molecular Physics, Polish Academy of Sciences, Poznań, Poland, (3) A. Chełkowski Institute of Physics, Silesian University, Katowice, Poland)
Abstract: Based on experimental crystallographic data, electronic structure of UGe$_2$ have been calculated and compared with our results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. We employed two different advanced full potential (FP) methods: FP-local-orbital (FPLO) and FP-linear augmented plane waves (Wien2k) codes for non-magnetic and ferromagnetic states. Starting from the local spin-density approximation (LSDA) or generalised gradient approximation (GGA), we verified either the orbital polarisation (OP) correction or the GGA+U approach for the U 5f-electrons, changing Coulomb-repulsion energies U in the range 0-4 eV. Satisfying agreement was achieved between experimental and our calculated magnetic moments using ab-initio LSDA+OP and non-ab-initio GGA+U approaches, the latter for realistic U values of 2-3 eV. We proved by the LSDA+OP approach an existence of the Fermi surface nesting vector along the a axis, possibly responsible for the triplet superconducting pairing. The calculated data reveal predominantly an itinerant U 5f-electron character of bands near the Fermi level, EF, with only small contributions from the U 6d and Ge 4p states. The experimental XPS spectrum of valence bands (VB) also contains the sharp main 5f-electron peak at EF, a wide hump (around -2 eV), and broad small peaks at higher energies. In the calculated XPS spectrum, the width of the main 5f-electron peak varies between 0.8 and 1.4 eV, depending on a method used in computations, but the hump remains unresolved. A newly observed asymmetric 1-eV satellite in the experimental 4f-core XPS spectrum together with known 3-eV and 7-eV satellites suggest dual behaviour of U-5f-electrons in UGe$_2$, the feature is inferred also from the VB studies.

Title: Revealing the Low Temperature Phase of FAPbI$_3$ using Machine-Learned Potential
Authors: Sangita Dutta, Erik Fransson, Tobias Hainer, Benjamin M. Gallant, Dominik J. Kubicki, Paul Erhart, Julia Wiktor
Abstract: FAPbI$_3$ is a material of interest for its potential in solar cell applications, driven by its remarkable optoelectronic properties. However, the low-temperature phase of FAPbI$_3$ remains poorly understood, with open questions surrounding its crystal structure, octahedral tilting, and the arrangement of formamidinium (FA) cations. Using our trained machine-learned potential in combination with large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, we provide a detailed investigation of this phase, uncovering its structural characteristics and dynamical behavior. Our analysis reveals the octahedral tilt pattern and sheds light on the rotational dynamics of FA cations in the low temperature phase. Strikingly, we find that the FA cations become frozen in a metastable configuration, unable to reach the thermodynamic ground state. By comparing our simulated results with experimental nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and inelastic neutron scattering (INS) spectra, we demonstrate good agreement, further validating our findings. This phenomenon mirrors experimental observations and offers a compelling explanation for the experimental challenges in accessing the true ground state. These findings provide critical insights into the fundamental physics of FAPbI$_3$ and its low-temperature behavior, advancing our understanding of this technologically important material.

Title: Non-Abelian Gauge Enhances Self-Healing for Non-Hermitian Topological Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Chain
Authors: Yazhuang Miao, Yiming Zhao, Yong Wang, Xiaolong Zhao, Xuexi Yi
Abstract: This work introduces and analyzes a non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model generalized through spin-dependent non-Abelian SU(2) gauge couplings. By incorporating SU(2) symmetry transformations that couple explicitly to spin degrees of freedom, our model demonstrates distinct topological properties originating from the interplay between non-Hermiticity and gauge-induced spin-orbit coupling. Exact diagonalization and generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ) analyses reveal distinct spectral phases, characterized by complex-energy loops under periodic boundary conditions (PBC) and substantial localization indicative of the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) under open boundary conditions (OBC). We define a gauge-invariant winding number for non-Hermitian chiral symmetry, clarifying the topological transitions. Furthermore, we uncover a novel self-healing phenomenon in response to dynamically introduced scattering potentials, showing significant robustness enhancement induced by appropriate non-Abelian SU(2) couplings. These findings clarify how non-Abelian gauge interactions can control spin-dependent localization and dynamical stability in non-Hermitian topological systems, guiding the development of tunable quantum devices.

Title: Deep Nets as Hamiltonians
Authors: Mike Winer, Boris Hanin
Abstract: Neural networks are complex functions of both their inputs and parameters. Much prior work in deep learning theory analyzes the distribution of network outputs at a fixed a set of inputs (e.g. a training dataset) over random initializations of the network parameters. The purpose of this article is to consider the opposite situation: we view a randomly initialized Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) as a Hamiltonian over its inputs. For typical realizations of the network parameters, we study the properties of the energy landscape induced by this Hamiltonian, focusing on the structure of near-global minimum in the limit of infinite width. Specifically, we use the replica trick to perform an exact analytic calculation giving the entropy (log volume of space) at a given energy. We further derive saddle point equations that describe the overlaps between inputs sampled iid from the Gibbs distribution induced by the random MLP. For linear activations we solve these saddle point equations exactly. But we also solve them numerically for a variety of depths and activation functions, including $\tanh, \sin, \text{ReLU}$, and shaped non-linearities. We find even at infinite width a rich range of behaviors. For some non-linearities, such as $\sin$, for instance, we find that the landscapes of random MLPs exhibit full replica symmetry breaking, while shallow $\tanh$ and ReLU networks or deep shaped MLPs are instead replica symmetric.

Title: Relevance of the Computational Models of Bacterial Interactions in the simulation of Biofilm Growth
Authors: Gabriel Santos-Díaz, Álvaro Rodríguez-Rivas, Alejandro Cuetos
Abstract: This study explores the application of elongated particle interaction models, traditionally used in liquid crystal phase research, in the context of early bacterial biofilm development. Through computer simulations, using an agent based model, of the repulsive and attractive of Kihara models and Hertz interaction model, we investigate the possibilities and limitations for modelling biofilm formation and growth. Our approach focuses on understanding how mechanical forces due to the interaction between cells, in addition to growth and diffusive parameters, influence the formation of complex bacterial communities. By comparing such force models, we evaluate their impact on the structural properties of bacterial microcolonies. The results indicate that, although the specific force model has some effect on biofilm properties, the intensity of the interaction between bacteria is the most important determinant. This study highlights the importance of properly selecting interaction strength in simulations to obtain realistic representations of biofilm growth, and suggests which adapted models of rod-shaped bacterial systems may offer a valid approach to study the dynamics of complex biofilms.

Title: Contrasting exchange-field and spin-transfer torque driving mechanisms in all-electric electron spin resonance
Authors: Jose Reina-Galvez, Matyas Nachtigall, Nicolas Lorente, Jan Martinek, Christoph Wolf
Abstract: Understanding the coherent properties of electron spins driven by electric fields is crucial for their potential application in quantum-coherent nanoscience. In this work, we address two distinct driving mechanisms in electric-field driven electron-spin resonance as implemented in scanning tunneling spectroscopy. We study the origin of the driving field using a single orbital Anderson impurity, connected to polarized leads and biased by a voltage modulated on resonance with a spin transition. By mapping the quantum master equation into a system of equations for the impurity spin, we identify two distinct driving mechanisms. Below the charging thresholds of the impurity, electron spin resonance is dominated by a magnetically exchange-driven mechanism or field-like torque. Conversely, above the charging threshold spin-transfer torque caused by the spin-polarized current through the impurity drives the spin transition. Only the first mechanism enables coherent quantum spin control, while the second one leads to fast decoherence and spin accumulation towards a non-equilibrium steady-state. The electron spin resonance signals and spin dynamics vary significantly depending on which driving mechanism dominates, highlighting the potential for optimizing quantum-coherent control in electrically driven quantum systems.

Title: Robust Magnetic Polaron Percolation in the Antiferromagnetic CMR System EuCd$_2$P$_2$
Authors: Marvin Kopp, Charu Garg, Sarah Krebber, Kristin Kliemt, Cornelius Krellner, Sudhaman Balguri, Mira Mahendru, Fazel Tafti, Theodore L. Breeze, Nathan P. Bentley, Francis L. Pratt, Thomas J. Hicken, Hubertus Luetkens, Jonas A. Krieger, Stephen J. Blundell, Tom Lancaster, M. Victoria Ale Crivillero, Steffen Wirth, Jens Müller
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic EuCd$_2$P$_2$ has attracted considerable attention due to its unconventional (magneto)transport properties. At a temperature $T_{\rm peak}$ significantly above the magnetic ordering temperature $T_\textrm{N} = 11\,$K a large peak in resistivity is observed which gets strongly suppressed in magnetic field, resulting in a colossal magnetoresistance (CMR), for which magnetic fluctuations and the formation of ferromagnetic clusters have been proposed as underlying mechanisms. Employing a selection of sensitive probes including fluctuation spectroscopy and third-harmonic resistance, Hall effect, AC susceptibility and $\mu$SR measurements, allows for a direct comparison of electronic and magnetic properties on multiple time scales. We find compelling evidence for the formation and percolation of magnetic polarons, which explains the CMR of the system. Large peaks in the weakly-nonlinear transport and the resistance noise power spectral density at zero magnetic field signify an inhomogeneous, percolating electronic system below $T^\ast \approx 2\,T_\textrm{N}$ with a percolation threshold at $T_{\rm peak}$. In magnetic fields, the onset of large negative MR in the paramagnetic regime occurs at a universal critical magnetization similar to ferromagnetic CMR materials. The size of the magnetic polarons at the percolation threshold is estimated to $\sim 1 - 2\,$nm. The mechanism of magntic cluster formation and percolation in EuCd$_2$P$_2$ appears to be rather robust despite large variations in carrier concentration and likely is relevant for other Eu-based antiferromagnetic CMR systems.

Title: Krylov complexity in quantum many-body scars of spin-1 models
Authors: Qingmin Hu, Wen-Yi Zhang, Yunguang Han, Wen-Long You
Abstract: Weak ergodicity breaking, particularly through quantum many-body scars (QMBS), has become a significant focus in many-body physics. Krylov state complexity quantifies the spread of quantum states within the Krylov basis and serves as a powerful diagnostic for analyzing nonergodic dynamics. In this work, we study spin-one XXZ magnets and reveal nonergodic behavior tied to QMBS. For the XY model, the nematic Néel state exhibits periodic revivals in Krylov complexity. In the generic XXZ model, we identify spin helix states as weakly ergodicity-breaking states, characterized by low entanglement and nonthermal dynamics. Across different scenarios, the Lanczos coefficients for scarred states display an elliptical pattern, reflecting a hidden SU(2) algebra that enables analytical results for Krylov complexity and fidelity. These findings, which exemplify the rare capability to characterize QMBS analytically, are feasible with current experimental techniques and offer deep insights into the nonergodic dynamics of interacting quantum systems.

Title: Phase Separation in Mixtures of Nematic and Isotropic Fluids
Authors: Margarida M. Telo da Gama, Rodrigo C. V. Coelho
Abstract: Mixtures of nematic liquid crystals and isotropic fluids display a diverse range of phase behaviors, arising from the coupling between orientational order and concentration fluctuations. In this review, we introduce a simplified mathematical framework that integrates the Landau-de Gennes free energy for nematic ordering with the Cahn-Hilliard free energy for phase separation. We derive the corresponding governing equations and analyze the stability of uniform phases, along with the resulting interfacial phenomena. The review concludes with a brief discussion highlighting key differences in phase separation between mixtures of isotropic fluids with passive and active nematics.

Title: Renormalized mechanics and stochastic thermodynamics of growing model protocells
Authors: Jordan L. Shivers, Michael Nguyen, Aaron R. Dinner, Petia Vlahovska, Suriyanarayanan Vaikuntanathan
Abstract: Uncovering the rules governing the nonequilibrium dynamics of the membranes that define biological cells is of central importance to understanding the physics of living systems. We theoretically and computationally investigate the behavior of model protocells -- flexible quasispherical vesicles -- that exchange membrane constituents, internal volume, and heat with an external reservoir. The excess chemical potential and osmotic pressure difference imposed by the reservoir act as generalized thermodynamic driving forces that modulate vesicle morphology. We identify an associated nonequilibrium morphological transition between a weakly driven regime, in which growing vesicles remain quasispherical, and a strongly driven regime, in which vesicles accommodate rapid membrane uptake by developing surface wrinkles. This transition emerges due to the renormalization of membrane mechanical properties by nonequilibrium driving. Further, using insights from stochastic thermodynamics we propose a minimal vesicle growth-shape law that remains robust even in strongly driven, far-from-equilibrium regimes.

Title: Position-Momenta Uncertainties in Classical Systems
Authors: Dipesh K. Singh, P. K. Mohanty
Abstract: We design a thermal bath that preserves the conservation of a system's angular momentum or allows it to fluctuate around a specified nonzero mean while maintaining a Boltzmann distribution of energy in the steady this http URL demonstrate that classical particles immersed in such baths exhibit position-momentum uncertainties with a strictly positive lower bound proportional to the absolute value of the mean angular momentum. The proportionality constant, $c$, is dimensionless and independent of the system's parameters. Remarkably, while $c$ is universally bounded by unity, it attains the exact value $c=1/2$ for particles in central potentials.

Title: Effect of Interlayer Stacking on the Electronic Properties of 1$T$-TaS$_2$
Authors: Nelson Hua, Francesco Petocchi, Henry G. Bell, Gabriel Aeppli, Philipp Werner, Simon Gerber
Abstract: Controlled stacking of van der Waals materials is a powerful tool for exploring the physics of quantum condensed matter. Given the small binding between layers, exploitation for engineering will require a breakthrough in stacking methodology, or an ability to take advantage of thicker defective stacks. Here we describe computational groundwork for the latter, using -- on account of its promise for cold memory applications -- 1$T$-TaS$_2$ as a model system. Comparing recursive Hendricks-Teller calculations and Monte Carlo simulations to published X-ray diffraction data, we obtain the key parameters describing the random stacking in mesoscopic flakes. These then regulate the electronic structures via specification of the random stacks in dynamical mean-field theory simulations. Hubbard repulsion induces strongly correlated metallic, band and Mott insulating layers, providing compelling evidence that electronic properties follow from the coexistence of more than the metallic and insulating planes associated by ordinary band theory.

Title: Chiral order emergence in the kagome $J_1-J_3$ Heisenberg model driven by site disorder
Authors: Coraline Letouze, Pascal Viot, Laura Messio
Abstract: The $J_1-J_3$ Heisenberg model on the kagome lattice is know to exhibit a fascinating emergent $q=4$ Potts order (or $K_4$) due to the order-by-disorder mechanism: for large $J_3>0$, fluctuations select one among the four equivalent collinear ground states, which themselves belong to a larger ground state manifold. We study this model with a rate $p$ of magnetic site vacancies through a numerical approach. First, we analyze the effect of few impurities on the ground state, favouring non-coplanar configurations. Second, for finite dilutions, we perform parallel tempering Monte Carlo simulations in the $(T,p)$ plane, showing the emergence of a low-temperature chiral phase and the progressive destruction of the $q=4$ Potts transition. This is a rare example of competing order parameters that exclude each other, whith the chiral one appearing only due to disorder.

Title: Low-energy electron microscopy as a tool for analysis of self-assembled molecular layers on surfaces
Authors: Jan Čechal, Pavel Procházka
Abstract: Low-energy electron microscopy (LEEM) is a surface science method that works primarily in the UHV environment. It provides information complementary to the other established techniques: it extends the limited view of scanning probe microscopies from nanometers to micrometers and measurement time down to tens of milliseconds, enabling to visualize the changes during sample treatment, e.g., annealing, deposition, and gas or light exposure. From the point of structural analysis, it allows the measurement of diffraction patterns from an area of diameter below 200 nm and imaging of phase distribution on the surfaces either through dark-filed imaging or LEEM-I(V) fingerprinting. The advanced modes provide local angle-resolved photoelectron spectra and surface potential distribution. In this review, we aim to describe the utilization of LEEM to study self-assembled molecular structures on solid surfaces. We present the LEEM instrumentation and analysis of measured data in a tutorial way to provide the necessary background knowledge to enter the field. In the second part, we summarize the knowledge obtained by LEEM for several selected systems, which points to the strength of LEEM in understanding the self-assembled molecular systems and its synergy with other surface science techniques.

Title: Tunable macroscopic defect patterns induced by a low-frequency AC electric field in ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals
Authors: Natalia Podoliak, Lubor Lejcek, Martin Cigl, Vladimira Novotna
Abstract: Regulation of topological structures and pattern formation is attracting wide interest in the field of condensed matter. Liquid crystals (LCs) represent soft matter with a remarkable combination of fluidity and anisotropic properties. Topological defects may appear in confined LCs under external stimuli. Recently discovered ferroelectric nematics (NF) opened exceptional opportunities in technologies owing to high permittivity and polarisation. Polar properties of NF supply more variability to topological structures. In this research, we present tunable 2D topological defect arrays in NF compound, induced by an alternating (AC) electric field in simple sandwich cells without pre-patterning. The observed arrays of defects form pseudo-square lattices, which character and periodicity depend on the frequency of the applied field and partially on the cell thickness. The observed effect is explained to occur due to the competition between elastic and electrical forces. The proposed system can be useful to create reconfigurable spatially periodic polarisation structures.

Title: Density wave order with antiphase feature associated with the pseudogap in cuprate superconductor Bi2+xSr2-xCuO6+delta
Authors: Zhaohui Wang, Han Li, Shengtai Fan, Jiasen Xu, Huan Yang, Hai-Hu Wen
Abstract: The strong correlation effect in cuprate superconductors have greatly enriched the phase diagram showing the co-existence of superconductivity with many intertwined orders. One of the prominent issues concerning the superconductivity mechanism is about the pseudogap phase which behaves either as cooperator or competitor for superconductivity and its fundamental reason remains still elusive. Here we report the measurements of scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) in the model superconducting system Bi2+xSr2-xCuO6+delta with a transition temperature Tc~7 K. Although this system is supposed to be slightly overdoped, a pseudogap feature can be easily observed in the energy region of about 20-60 meV. A modulation of local density of states (LDOS) with a periodicity of about 4a0/3 (a0: Cu-O-Cu bond length) can be easily observed, which is also supported by the Fourier transformation pattern with wavevectors at about (0,+-3pi/2a0) and (+-3pi/2a0,0). Surprisingly, we find that the LDOS exhibits a clear antiphase feature in the pseudogap energy region below and above the Fermi energy, indicating that it is an intrinsic feature of the pseudogap phase. We interpret this modulation and antiphase feature as a possible consequence of the pair density wave due to the Amperean pairing with finite momentum. Our results give a deep insight on the understanding of the pseudogap phase in cuprate superconductors.

Title: Simplified Cofactor Conditions for Cubic to Tetragonal, Orthorhombic, and Monoclinic Phase Transformations
Authors: Hanlin Gu, Fan Feng
Abstract: Cofactor Conditions (CCs) are geometric compatibility conditions mathematically derived from the crystallographic theory of martensitic phase transformation. The CCs guarantee compatible interfaces between the austenite and the parallelled twin of the martensite with any volume fraction, yielding a wide range of microstructures during phase transformation. In recent times, CCs have demonstrated tremendous applications in the rational design of low hysteresis/fatigue shape memory alloys and shape memory ceramics. In this paper, we present a simplified form of the CCs for Type I/II twins using the eigenspace of transformation stretch tensor and twin axes. We further show the explicit forms and visualizations of the simplified CCs for Cubic to Tetragonal, Cubic to Orthorhombic, and Cubic to Monoclinic I/II phase transformations. The simplified form has revealed a more straightforward correlation between the lattice parameters and the CCs, and thus provides a more convenient tool for the rational design of phase-transforming materials.

Title: Asymptotic Freedom and Finite-size Scaling of Two-dimensional Classical Heisenberg Model
Authors: Dingyun Yao, Chao Zhang, Z. Y. Xie, Zhijie Fan, Youjin Deng
Abstract: The classical Heisenberg model is one of the most fundamental models in statistical and condensed matter physics. Extensive theoretical and numerical studies suggest that, in two dimensions, this model does not exhibit a finite-temperature phase transition but instead manifests asymptotic freedom. However, some research has also proposed the possibility of a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase transition over the years. In this study, we revisit the classical two-dimensional (2D) Heisenberg model through large-scale simulations with linear system sizes up to $L=16384$. Our Monte-Carlo data, without any extrapolation, clearly reveal an exponential divergence of the correlation length $\xi$ as a function of inverse temperature $\beta$, a hallmark of asymptotic freedom. Moreover, extrapolating $\xi$ to the thermodynamic limit in the low-temperature regime achieves close agreement with the three-loop perturbative calculations. We further propose a finite-size scaling (FSS) ansatz for $\xi$, demonstrating that the pseudo-critical point $\beta_L$ diverges logarithmically with $L$. The thermodynamic and finite-size scaling behaviors of the magnetic susceptibility $\chi$ are also investigated and corroborate the prediction of asymptotic freedom. Our work provides solid evidence for asymptotic freedom in the 2D Heisenberg model and advances understanding of finite-size scaling in such systems.

Title: Ambient and high pressure studies of structural, electronic and magnetic properties of EuZn$_2$P$_2$ single crystal
Authors: Damian Rybicki, Kamila Komędera, Janusz Przewoźnik, Łukasz Gondek, Czesław Kapusta, Karolina Podgórska, Wojciech Tabiś, Jan Żukrowski, Lan Maria Tran, Michał Babij, Zbigniew Bukowski, Ladislav Havela, Volodymyr Buturlim, Jiri Prchal, Martin Divis, Petr Kral, Ilja Turek, Itzhak Halevy, Jiri Kastil, Martin Misek, Dominik Legut
Abstract: A thorough study of EuZn$_2$P$_2$ single crystals, which were grown from Sn flux, was performed using both bulk (heat capacity, ac susceptibility, dc magnetization, electrical resistivitivity, magnetoresistance) and microscopic (Mössbauer spectroscopy) techniques. Electrical resistance and magnetic susceptibility were measured also under high pressure conditions (up to 19 GPa and 9.5 GPa, respectively). Further insight into electronic properties and phonons is provided by ab initio calculations. The results indicate that EuZn$_2$P$_2$ is an antiferromagnet with strong Eu-Eu exchange coupling of ferromagnetic type within the basal plane and weaker antiferromagnetic interaction along the c axis. The Eu magnetic moments are tilted from the basal plane. Hydrostatic pressure strongly affects both magnetic (increase of the Néel temperature) and electronic (suppression of the band gap and semi metallic behavior) properties, indicating a strong interplay of structure with magnetic and electronic degrees of freedom.

Title: Quantum phase diagram of the extended spin-3/2 Kitaev-Heisenberg model: A DMRG study
Authors: Gui-Xin Liu, Ting-Long Wang, Yi-Fan Jiang
Abstract: Recently there has been considerable excitement surrounding the promising realization of high-spin Kitaev material, such as the quasi-2D compound CrI$_3$ and CrGeTe$_3$. However, the stability of quantum spin liquids (QSL) against single ion anisotropy (SIA) in these materials and the global quantum phase diagram of the extended spin-3/2 Kitaev model with finite SIA remain unclear. In this study, we perform large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) to explore the quantum phase diagram of the generalized spin-3/2 Kitaev-Heisenberg (K-H) model accompanied with SIA $A_c$. In the $A_c=0$ limit, the spin-3/2 K-H model exhibits a quantum phase diagram similar to that of a spin-1/2 system, including two QSLs around antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic Kitaev models. For models with finite $A_c$, we map out the quantum phase diagram around two Kitaev points and observe distinct types of in-plane vortex orders developed from these two QSL phases. Interestingly, series of nearly degenerate vortex configurations are discovered in each vortex phases. Using linear spin-wave theory, we demonstrate that these vortex configurations can be understood as a consequence of the quantum correction on a continuous family of degenerate classical states.

Title: Ranked percolation model for the caking time of amorphous molecular powders
Authors: Vasco C. Braz, Nuno A. M. Araújo
Abstract: When amorphous molecular powders are exposed to high humidity levels or temperatures, the particle viscosity increases due to plasticization, promoting the formation of sinter bridges between pairs of particles in contact. Over time, these bridges facilitate particle agglomeration, eventually leading to the formation of a macroscopic cake that alters the mechanical properties and affects product quality. In this work, we model the caking process of amorphous powders subjected to a temperature shock as a bond percolation problem and investigate how particle bed heterogeneities influence the percolation threshold and, consequently, the expected caking times. Our findings indicate that a slight dispersion in particle size lowers the percolation threshold compared to a monodisperse bed or random percolation in polydisperse systems. Furthermore, we show that the expected caking time exhibits a non-monotonic behavior with the size dispersion, initially decreasing for low dispersion values and increasing for higher values. These results provide insights into the role of the particle size distribution on the caking dynamics of amorphous molecular powders

Title: Unveiling superconducting properties of an equiatomic hexagonal high entropy alloy via muon spin relaxation and rotation measurement
Authors: Sonika Jangid, Pavan Kumar Meena, Niraj P. Atale, Rhea Stewart, Adrian D. Hillier, R. P. Singh
Abstract: Superconducting high-entropy alloys (HEAs) present a unique platform for studying the effect of disorder, composition, and crystal structure on superconducting pairing. In this study, we present a comprehensive bulk and microscopic investigation of the rarely observed equiatomic hexagonal HEA Nb-Mo-Ru-Re-Ir using magnetization, resistivity, heat capacity, and muon spin relaxation and rotation ($\mu$SR) measurements. Our findings confirm bulk type-II superconductivity with a transition temperature of 4.63(2) K and a high upper critical field. Heat capacity and transverse-field $\mu$SR data reveal conventional s-wave superconductivity, while zero-field $\mu$SR results suggest the preservation of time-reversal symmetry in the superconducting state. These findings provide valuable insights into the superconducting pairing mechanism in disordered multicomponent systems.

Title: Magnetic Confinement of a Bubble of Supercooled $^3$He-A
Authors: Luke Whitehead, Andrew Casey, Richard P. Haley, Petri J. Heikkinen, Lev V. Levitin, Adam J. Mayer, Xavier Rojas, Tineke Salmon, John Saunders, Alex Thomson, Dmitry E. Zmeev, Samuli Autti
Abstract: We have designed and constructed a magnet surrounding a cylindrical volume of superfluid helium-3 to isolate a region of metastable, supercooled A-phase, entirely surrounded by bulk A-phase - isolating the 'bubble' from rough surfaces that can trigger the transition to the stable B-phase. We outline the design of the experimental cell and magnet, and show that the performance of the magnet is consistent with simulations, including the capability to producing the high field gradient required for generating a bubble. Future plans include the investigation of possible intrinsic mechanisms underpinning the A-B transition, with potential implications for early-universe cosmological phase transitions.

Title: Dynamical properties of particulate composites derived from ultradense stealthy hyperuniform sphere packings
Authors: Carlo Vanoni, Jaeuk Kim, Paul J. Steinhardt, Salvatore Torquato
Abstract: Stealthy hyperuniform (SHU) many-particle systems are distinguished by a structure factor that vanishes not only at zero wavenumber (as in ``standard'' hyperuniform systems) but also across an extended range of wavenumbers near the origin. We generate disordered SHU packings of identical and `nonoverlapping' spheres in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space using a modified collective-coordinate optimization algorithm that incorporates a soft-core repulsive potential between particles in addition to the standard stealthy pair potential. These SHU packings are ultradense, spanning a broad spectrum of structures depending on the stealthiness parameter $\chi$. We consider two-phase media composed of hard particles derived from ultradense SHU packings embedded in a matrix phase, with varying stealthiness parameter $\chi$ and packing fractions $\phi$. Our main objective is the estimation of the dynamical physical properties of such two-phase media, namely, the effective dynamic dielectric constant and the time-dependent diffusion spreadability, which is directly related to nuclear magnetic relaxation in fluid-saturated porous media. We show through spreadability that two-phase media derived from ultradense SHU packings exhibit faster interphase diffusion due to the higher packing fractions achievable compared to media obtained without soft-core repulsion. The imaginary part of the effective dynamic dielectric constant of SHU packings vanishes at a small wavenumber, implying perfect transparency for the corresponding wavevectors. We also obtain cross-property relations between transparency characteristics and long-time behavior of the spreadability for such two-phase media. Our results demonstrate that disordered two-phase media derived from ultradense SHU packings exhibit advantageous transport and optical behaviors of both theoretical and experimental significance.

Title: Synergy of Doob Transformation and Montroll Defect Theory for Random Walks in External Potentials
Authors: Stanislav Burov
Abstract: We present a systematic method for constructing stochastic processes by modifying simpler, analytically solvable random walks on discrete lattices. Our framework integrates the Doob $h$-transformation with the Montroll defect theory, overcoming the strict constraints associated with each method alone. By combining these two approaches, we map random walks in simple potentials onto processes involving more general external potentials and metastable states. Explicit analytical expressions relate the transformed process to the original one, facilitating direct investigation of exponential decay rates and additional dynamical modes. As an illustrative example, we demonstrate our method by analyzing a random walker in a linear potential modified to include a metastable state, revealing distinct exponential decay regimes relevant to escape dynamics.

Title: Multiscale Insights of Domain Unfolding in Fibrin Mechanical Response
Authors: Vivek Sharma, Poulomi Sadhukhan
Abstract: Fibrinogen, the monomeric unit of fibrin, the main constituent of blood clot, has a very complex structure. The fibrinogen builds the fibrin fiber and network through the half-staggered packing via knob-hole interaction and the $\alpha$C crosslinkers. Due to its rich structure, the elastic behavior also shows a unique nature of very high stretchability and multiple regimes in stress-strain behaviour, which is not yet fully understood. We develop an Unfolding-incorporated Coarse-Grained Polymer (UCGP) model for fibrinogen to study the effect of domain unfolding on the mechanical behavior of fibrin fiber and network. Our model captures the stretching behavior of fibrinogen as observed in AFM and all-atom simulations. We further extend our model to fibrin fiber to study the effect of molecular unfolding at the fiber and network level. We anticipate that our model will be able to account for the nonlinear mechanical behavior of crosslinked fibrin gel. It is possibly the first model of this sort to consider the precise, controllable knowledge of the effects of domain unfolding in crosslinked proteins. This model can also be used to model systems that have sacrificial bonds.

Title: Thermodynamic Features of a Heat Engine Coupled with Exponentially Decreasing Temperature Across the Reaction Coordinate, as well as Perspectives on Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics
Authors: Mesfin Taye
Abstract: In this study, we advance the understanding of non-equilibrium systems by deriving thermodynamic relations for a heat engine operating under an exponentially decreasing temperature profile. Such thermal configurations closely mimic spatially localized heating such as laser-induced thermal gradients. Using exact analytical solutions, we show that this arrangement results in significantly higher velocity, entropy production, and extraction rates than piecewise thermal profiles, while exhibiting reduced irreversibility and complexity relative to linear or quadratic gradients. We further examine the thermodynamic behavior of the Brownian particles in the networks. Our study reveals that the velocity and entropy production rates remain independent of network size; on the contrary, extensive quantities such as total entropy depend on the number of microstates. Additionally, we show that a Brownian particle in a ratchet potential with spatially varying temperature achieves directed motion, even without external forces driven by solely thermal asymmetry. These findings highlight the critical role of temperature asymmetry in controlling the transport processes and optimizing the particle dynamics. This in turn will have promising applications in microfluidic devices and nanoscale sensors. Finally, we explore the influence of the system parameters on the efficiency and performance of the heat engine. The exponential temperature profiles enable faster velocities while simultaneously exhibiting higher efficiency compared with other thermal arrangements. Moreover, by addressing key questions on entropy production, we provide insights into the transition between nonequilibrium and equilibrium systems and contribute tools for optimizing energy-efficient systems in both natural and engineered settings.

Title: Synthesis of europium-based crystals containing As or P by a flux method: attempts to grow EuAgP single crystals
Authors: Karolina Podgórska, Damian Rybicki, Lan Maria Tran, Wojciech Tabiś, Łukasz Gondek, Michał Babij
Abstract: Europium-based materials are highly attractive due to their diverse range of physical properties. In these studies, we aimed to synthesize single crystals of the potentially topological semimetallic compound EuAgP, which up to this day has only been obtained in polycrystalline form. The flux method was employed for the syntheses, using fluxes such as: Bi, Sn, Pb, and In, in their various ratios. The purpose of using Bi flux was to try synthesizing an analog of EuAgAs single crystals, by fully substituting arsenic with phosphorus. The obtained crystals were characterized by x-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. Despite many unsuccessful attempts to synthesize EuAgP single crystals, the study provides valuable insights into how different fluxes and their ratios influence the final synthesis product. It also underscores the complexity of designing analogs between arsenides and phosphides.

Title: Thermal transport in superconductor heterostructures: some recent progress
Authors: Paramita Dutta
Abstract: This article reviews recent advances in low-temperature electronic thermal transport properties of thermally biased superconductor heterostructures focusing on the two-terminal transport. Since the last decade, ferromagnetism has been widely used to enhance the thermoelectricity in heterostructures based on ordinary superconductors. The possibility of getting giant thermoelectric effects with optimum thermal conductance by breaking the electron-hole symmetry of the ordinary superconductor boosted the research in this direction. Recently, attention has been paid to the role of triplet Cooper pairs that emerged in ferromagnetic junctions and the possibility of advanced applications. Other forms of magnetism, specifically antiferromagnetism and altermagnetism, have been investigated to unravel the behavior of the thermal and charge current in thermally biased junctions. In parallel to ordinary superconductors, junctions with unconventional superconductors have been explored for the same purpose. Thermal transport in superconducting bilayers has been studied using advanced materials like Dirac and topological materials, including Weyl semimetals. Significant attention has been paid to thermally biased topological Josephson junctions to explore the phase-tunable current in recent times. Weyl Josephson junctions, multi-terminal Josephson junctions, and various other multilayer junctions have also been studied to engineer large thermoelectric effects and various functionalities with potential applications in superconductor-based thermal device components.

Title: Local basis for interacting topological bands
Authors: Nishchhal Verma, Raquel Queiroz
Abstract: The discovery of correlated states in moire materials has challenged the established methods of projecting interactions into a local Wannier basis due to topological obstructions that manifest in extended interactions. This difficulty can sometimes be evaded by decomposing the band into a basis of extended itinerant states and a lattice of local states, using the heavy fermion prescription. We revisit this framework by systematically identifying the dominant interaction channels guided by the eigenvalues of the projected density operator. This approach can be applied both to tight-binding and continuum models, allowing us to identify a hierarchy in interaction scales that can be universally used to reduce the Hilbert space dimension and determine an appropriate local basis for modeling electronic correlations in interacting topological materials.

Authors: Ilya Shirokov, Viacheslav Hrushev, Filipp Uskov, Ivan Dudinets, Igor Ermakov, Oleg Lychkovskiy
Abstract: The recursion method provides a powerful framework for studying quantum many-body dynamics in the Lanczos basis, which is recursively constructed within the Krylov space of operators. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the recursion method, when supplemented by the universal operator growth hypothesis, can effectively compute autocorrelation functions and transport coefficients at infinite temperature. In this work, we extend the scope of the recursion method to far-from-equilibrium quench dynamics. We apply the method to spin systems in one, two, and three spatial dimensions. In one dimension we find a clear evidence that the convergence of the method is limited in time by the dynamical quantum phase transition.

Title: The structure and topology of an amorphous metal-organic framework
Authors: Thomas C. Nicholas, Daniel F. Thomas du Toit, Louise A. M. Rosset, Davide M. Proserpio, Andrew L. Goodwin, Volker L. Deringer
Abstract: Amorphous metal-organic frameworks are an important emerging materials class that combine the attractive physical properties of the amorphous state with the versatility of metal-organic framework (MOF) chemistry. The structures of amorphous MOFs have largely been inferred by drawing analogies to crystalline polymorphs and inorganic glasses, but ultimately the validity of such structural models has been challenging to establish either experimentally or computationally. Here we use a unified data-driven approach, combining experimental scattering data and active machine learning for interatomic potentials, to determine the structure of an amorphous zeolitic imidazolate framework (a-ZIF) -- the canonical amorphous MOF. Our results reveal clear differences between the structure of a-ZIF and that of other amorphous tetrahedral networks, allowing us to invalidate the long-standing assumption that these inorganic and hybrid glasses are topologically equivalent. To this end, we introduce a systematic notation for the network topology of amorphous solids, building a bridge to the successful use of topology analysis in crystalline MOFs and to materials informatics. Our work provides insights into the structure and topology of the archetypal amorphous MOF and opens up new avenues for modelling and understanding amorphous framework materials more generally.

Title: The fundamental localization phases in quasiperiodic systems: A unified framework and exact results
Authors: Xin-Chi Zhou, Bing-Chen Yao, Yongjian Wang, Yucheng Wang, Yudong Wei, Qi Zhou, Xiong-Jun Liu
Abstract: The disordered quantum systems host three types of quantum states, the extended, localized, and critical, which bring up various distinct fundamental phases, including the pure phases and coexisting ones with mobility edges. The quantum phases involving critical states are of particular importance, but are less understood compared with the other ones, and the different phases have been separately studied in different quasiperiodic models. Here we propose a unified framework based on a spinful quasiperiodic system which unifies the realizations of all the fundamental Anderson phases, %with or without mobility edges, with the exact and universal results being obtained for these distinct phases. Through the duality transformation and renormalization group method, we show that the pure phases are obtained when the (emergent) chiral symmetry preserves in the proposed spin-1/2 quasiperiodic model, which provides a criteria for the emergence of the pure phases or the coexisting ones with mobility edges. Further, we uncover a new universal mechanism for the critical states that the emergence of such states is protected by the generalized incommensurate matrix element zeros in the spinful quasiperiodic model, as a novel generalization of the quasiperiodic hopping zeros in the spinless systems. We also show with the Avila's global theory the criteria of exact solvability for the present unified quasiperiodic system, with which we identify several new quasiperiodic models derived from the spinful system hosting exactly solvable Anderson phases. In particular, we reach a single model that hosts all the seven fundamental phases of Anderson localization. Finally, an experimental scheme is proposed to realize these models using quasiperiodic optical Raman lattices.

Title: How interacting Bose gases scatter light
Authors: Konstantinos Konstantinou, Yansheng Zhang, Paul H. C. Wong, Feiyang Wang, Yu-Kun Lu, Nishant Dogra, Christoph Eigen, Tanish Satoor, Wolfgang Ketterle, Zoran Hadzibabic
Abstract: The innate tendency of identical bosons to bunch, seen in the Hanbury Brown-Twiss effect and Bose-Einstein condensation, is a primary manifestation of quantum statistics. This tendency can enhance the rates of fundamental processes such as atom-atom and atom-light scattering if the atoms scatter into already occupied quantum states. For non-interacting bosons, the enhancement of light scattering is simply given by the bosonic-stimulation factor $1 + N_{\rm f}$, where $N_{\rm f}$ is the occupation of the atom's final momentum state. Here, we study scattering between off-resonant light and atoms in a quasi-homogeneous Bose gas with tunable interactions and show that even weak interactions, which do not significantly alter the momentum distribution, have a dramatic effect on the atom-light scattering. Due to (spatially local) beyond-mean-field atomic correlations, weak repulsive interactions can completely suppress the bosonic enhancement of scattering, while attractive ones increase the scattering rate. Moreover, if the interactions are rapidly tuned, light scattering reveals correlation dynamics that are orders of magnitude faster than the momentum-space population dynamics. Its extreme sensitivity to dynamical beyond-mean-field effects makes off-resonant light scattering a simple and powerful probe of many-body physics in ultracold atomic gases.

Title: Intertwining bulk and surface: the case of UTe$_2$
Authors: Andras Szabo, Aline Ramires
Abstract: UTe$_2$ has been the focus of numerous experimental and theoretical studies in recent years, as it is recognized as an odd-parity bulk superconductor. Its surface has also been probed, revealing charge density wave (CDW), pair density wave (PDW), and time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB). In this work, we propose that the interplay between the order parameters observed on the surface and in the bulk of UTe$_2$ may be crucial in explaining some of the unusual features detected by surface probes in this material. Through a phenomenological analysis, we can account for three distinctive experimental signatures observed on the surface of UTe$_2$: i) the apparent suppression of CDW order at the upper critical field of the bulk superconducting state; ii) the magnetic field-induced imbalance of the Fourier peaks associated with the CDW; iii) the onset of TRSB at the bulk superconducting critical temperature and its field-trainability. Furthermore, we propose specific experimental checks to validate our conjecture, which we believe could be promptly achieved.

Title: On the scaling properties of quasicrystalline potentials of eightfold rotational symmetry
Authors: A.Ya. Maltsev
Abstract: We consider a special class of quasi-periodic potentials arising in the physics of photonic systems and possessing rotational symmetry of the 8th order. We are interested in the ``scaling'' properties of such potentials, namely, the growth rate of their closed level lines near the percolation threshold. Estimates of the corresponding scaling indices allow, in particular, to carry out some comparison of such potentials with various models of random potentials on the plane.

Title: Harnessing uncertainty when learning through Equilibrium Propagation in neural networks
Authors: Jonathan Peters, Philippe Talatchian
Abstract: Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is a supervised learning algorithm that trains network parameters using local neuronal activity. This is in stark contrast to backpropagation, where updating the parameters of the network requires significant data shuffling. Avoiding data movement makes EP particularly compelling as a learning framework for energy-efficient training on neuromorphic systems. In this work, we assess the ability of EP to learn on hardware that contain physical uncertainties. This is particularly important for researchers concerned with hardware implementations of self-learning systems that utilize EP. Our results demonstrate that deep, multi-layer neural network architectures can be trained successfully using EP in the presence of finite uncertainties, up to a critical limit. This limit is independent of the training dataset, and can be scaled through sampling the network according to the central limit theorem. Additionally, we demonstrate improved model convergence and performance for finite levels of uncertainty on the MNIST, KMNIST and FashionMNIST datasets. Optimal performance is found for networks trained with uncertainties close to the critical limit. Our research supports future work to build self-learning hardware in situ with EP.

Title: Effective Description of Ajar Systems with a $U(1)$ Symmetry
Authors: Can Onur Akyuz, Riccardo Penco
Abstract: We introduce the concept of "ajar systems" as an intermediate case between closed and open systems, where the time scale for charge exchange with the environment is parametrically larger than all other characteristic time scales. The Schwinger-Keldysh effective action for such finite-temperature systems exhibits a symmetry group $G_1 \times G_2$ weakly broken to its diagonal subgroup $G_{\text{diag}}$, which we systematically describe using spurion techniques. For $G = U(1)$, we calculate leading-order corrections to correlation functions in both diffusive and spontaneously broken phases. Unlike systems with approximate symmetries where both real and imaginary parts of dispersion relations receive corrections, ajar systems modify only the imaginary part -- preserving gapless modes while adding finite damping.

Title: Glued tree lattices with only compact localized states
Authors: Andrew Osborne, Ciro Salcedo, Andrew A. Houck
Abstract: Flat band physics is a central theme in modern condensed matter physics. By constructing a tight--binding single particle system that has vanishing momentum dispersion in one or more bands, and subsequently including more particles and interactions, it is possible to study physics in strongly interacting regimes. Inspired by the glued trees that first arose in one of the few known examples of quantum supremacy, we define and analyze two infinite families of tight binding single particle Bose--Hubbard models that have only flat bands, and only compact localized states despite having any nonnegative number of translation symmetries. The first class of model that we introduce is constructed by replacing a sufficiently large fraction of the edges in a generic countable graph with glued trees modified to have complex hoppings. The second class arises from thinking of complex weighted glued trees as rhombi that can then be used to tile two dimensional space, giving rise to the familiar dice lattice and infinitely many generalizations thereof, of which some are Euclidian while others are hyperbolic.

Title: Epitaxial growth of KTiOAsO4 by pulsed laser deposition for nonlinear frequency conversion
Authors: Adrien Clavel, Mathieu Salaun, Lionel Bastard, Christophe Lepoittevin, Benoit Boulanger
Abstract: Twin photons and triple photons generations require pump laser intensities of several hundred Mega Watts per square centimeter. Micrometer sized crystalline waveguides allow such interactions to be achieved at relatively low energies by taking advantage of the confinement of light. The materials selected to achieve these phenomena in the present work are from the titanyl phosphate family. The chosen architecture is a micrometric layer of KTA grown on a KTP substrate forming a planar waveguide in a first step. These two isostructural materials have a low lattice parameter mismatch, making it possible to achieve high quality epitaxial growth. The refractive index of KTA being higher than that of KTP, this couple of materials could allow light to be guided in the deposited layer. To grow the KTA film, the chosen technique is pulsed laser deposition (PLD) that allows nonlinear complex oxides layer of optical quality to be grown. In this study, we show that the growth is well oriented for layers with a thickness up to 200 nm after deposition. Then, after annealing, the crystal state is improved as well as the surface. In this study we demonstrate the feasibility of KTA epitaxy over KTP by PLD with good epitaxial quality, good orientation and theoretical phase-matching conditions for a planar KTA waveguide.

Title: Plasmon-Assisted Random Lasing of Perovskite Materials
Authors: Yagya Woli, Bryson Krause, Thang Hoang
Abstract: Random lasing occurs as the result of coherent optical feedback from random scattering centers. Plasmonic nanostructures, such as silver or gold nanoparticles, efficiently scatter light due to the formation of hot spots and optical confinement at the nanoscale. In this work, using silver nanocubes as highly efficient light scattering centers, a broad band plasmon assisted lasing action of halide perovskite materials is demonstrated. By embedding silver nanocubes in CH3NH3PbBr3 and CH3NH3PbI3 solutions, narrow bandwidth lasing modes with a full width at half-maximum of approximately 1 nm are supported. It is observed that the lasing thresholds of perovskites are different for glass and gold substrates, and for different nanocube concentrations. Results of time-resolved measurements indicate a significant shortening in the decay time of the emission at above the lasing threshold, implying a stimulated emission process. The results of this work thus provide a pathway to generate coherent light sources from widely studied perovskite materials.

Title: Quantum Many-Body Linear Algebra, Hamiltonian Moments, and a Coupled Cluster Inspired Framework
Authors: Yuhang Ai, Huanchen Zhai, Johannes Tölle, Garnet Kin-Lic Chan
Abstract: We propose a general strategy to develop quantum many-body approximations of primitives in linear algebra algorithms. As a practical example, we introduce a coupled-cluster inspired framework to produce approximate Hamiltonian moments, and demonstrate its application in various linear algebra algorithms for ground state estimation. Through numerical examples, we illustrate the difference between the ground-state energies arising from quantum many-body linear algebra and those from the analogous many-body perturbation theory. Our results support the general idea of designing quantum many-body approximations outside of perturbation theory, providing a route to new algorithms and approximations.

Title: Concept and Demonstration of a Low-cost Compact Electron Microscope Enabled by a Photothermionic Carbon Nanotube Cathode
Authors: Casimir Kuzyk, Alexander Dimitrakopoulos, Alireza Nojeh
Abstract: The scanning electron microscope (SEM) delivers high resolution, high depth of focus and an image quality as if microscopic objects are seen by the naked eye. This makes it not only a powerful scientific instrument, but a tool inherently applicable to nearly all fields of study and curiosity involving the small scale. However, SEMs have remained complex, expensive, and beyond the reach of many. To broaden access, we demonstrate an SEM using simple, low-cost, off-the-shelf components, and hobby-level electromechanics; this has been enabled by a unique thermionic electron source based on a carbon nanotube array excited by low optical power. The instrument offers sub-micrometer resolution, a depth of focus of several hundred micrometers, and an image quality comparable to commercial SEMs; it also tolerates poor vacuum and moist specimens, making it broadly applicable. It has a flexible design that lends itself to easy customization for different use scenarios. We provide the conceptual approach and high-level design in this paper; the detailed blueprints of our specific implementation will be provided separately online. We hope that specialists and non-specialists alike will build variations that fit their own needs and interests, helping electron microscopy expand into diverse new sectors of society and industry.

Title: Multimodal machine learning with large language embedding model for polymer property prediction
Authors: Tianren Zhang, Dai-Bei Yang
Abstract: Contemporary large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and Llama, have harnessed extensive computational power and diverse text corpora to achieve remarkable proficiency in interpreting and generating domain-specific content, including materials science. To leverage the domain knowledge embedded within these models, we propose a simple yet effective multimodal architecture, PolyLLMem, which integrates text embeddings generated by Llama 3 with molecular structure embeddings derived from Uni-Mol, for polymer properties prediction tasks. In our model, Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) layers were also incorporated during the property prediction tasks to refine the embeddings based on our limited polymer dataset, thereby enhancing their chemical relevance for polymer SMILES representation. This balanced fusion of fine-tuned textual and structural information enables PolyLLMem to accurately predict a variety of polymer properties despite the scarcity of training data. Its performance is comparable to, and in some cases exceeds, that of graph-based models, as well as transformer-based models that typically require pretraining on millions of polymer samples. These findings demonstrate that LLM, such as Llama, can effectively capture chemical information encoded in polymer PSMILES, and underscore the efficacy of multimodal fusion of LLM embeddings and molecular structure embeddings in overcoming data scarcity and accelerating the discovery of advanced polymeric materials.

Title: Structural Boundary State Transitions in Turbulent Pipe Flow
Authors: L. Moriconi, G. Saisse
Abstract: Extensive optical measurements of canonical turbulent pipe flows have revealed the existence of structural boundary states (SBSs) -- near-wall low-speed streaks strongly correlated with pairs of counter-rotating quasi-streamwise vortices. In this study, we investigate the number fluctuations of these structures within the framework of statistical mechanics. Specifically, we introduce reduced degrees of freedom to model the low-speed streaks as a dilute lattice gas of hard-core particles. The Metropolis stochastic evolution provides, furthermore, a simple yet effective two-parameter model for describing SBS transitions. The lattice gas approach enables us to derive both the probability of SBS occurrence and the peculiar self-similar correlations that these structures exhibit along the streamwise direction. Our findings give additional support to the idea that the statistically stationary regimes of wall-bounded turbulent flows can be understood as Markov chains of coherent dynamical states in reduced-dimensional phase spaces.

Title: Momentum, spin, and orbital angular momentum of electromagnetic, acoustic, and water waves
Authors: Konstantin Y. Bliokh
Abstract: Waves of various types carry momentum, which is associated with their propagation direction, i.e., the phase gradient. The circulation of the wave momentum density gives rise to orbital angular momentum (AM). Additionally, for waves described by vector fields, local rotation of the wavefield produces spin AM (or simply, spin). These dynamical wave properties become particularly significant in structured (i.e., inhomogeneous) wavefields. Here we provide an introduction and overview of the momentum and AM properties for a variety of classical waves: electromagnetic, sound, elastic, plasma waves, and water surface waves. A unified field-theory approach, based on Noether's theorem, offers a general framework to describe these diverse physical systems, encompassing longitudinal, transverse, and mixed waves with different dispersion characteristics. We also discuss observable manifestations of the wave momentum and AM providing clear physical interpretations of the derived quantities.

Title: Simulating cell populations with explicit cell cycle length -- implications to cell cycle dependent tumour therapy
Authors: Peter Boldog, Gergely Röst
Abstract: In this study, we present a stochastic simulation model designed to explicitly incorporate cell cycle length, overcoming limitations associated with classical compartmental models. Our approach employs a delay mechanism to represent the cell cycle, allowing the use of arbitrary distributions for cell cycle lengths. We demonstrate the feasibility of our model by fitting it to experimental data from melanoma cell lines previously studied by Vittadello et al. Notably, our model successfully replicates experimentally observed synchronization phenomena that multi-stage models could not adequately explain. By using a gamma distribution to model cell cycle lengths, we achieved excellent agreement between our simulations and empirical data, while significantly reducing computational complexity and parameter estimation challenges inherent in multi-stage approaches. Our results highlight the importance of explicitly incorporating cell cycle lengths in modeling cell populations, with potential implications for optimizing cell cycle-dependent tumor therapies.

Title: Single Ultrabright Fluorescent Silica Nanoparticles Can Be Used as Individual Fast Real-Time Nanothermometers
Authors: Mahshid Iraniparast, Nishant Kumar, Igor Sokolov
Abstract: Optical-based nanothermometry represents a transformative approach for precise temperature measurements at the nanoscale, which finds versatile applications across biology, medicine, and electronics. The assembly of ratiometric fluorescent 40 nm nanoparticles designed to serve as individual nanothermometers is introduced here. These nanoparticles exhibit unprecedented sensitivity (11% /K) and temperature resolution 128 \, \mathrm{K} \cdot \mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2} \cdot \mathrm{W} \cdot \mathrm{cm}^{-2}, outperforming existing optical nanothermometers by factors of 2-6 and 455, respectively. The enhanced performance is attributed to the encapsulation of fluorescent molecules with high density inside the mesoporous matrix. It becomes possible after incorporating hydrophobic groups into the silica matrix, which effectively prevents water ingress and dye leaking. A practical application of these nanothermometers is demonstrated using confocal microscopy, showcasing their ability to map temperature distributions accurately. This methodology is compatible with any fluorescent microscope capable of recording dual fluorescent channels in any transparent medium or on a sample surface. This work not only sets a new benchmark for optical nano-thermometry but also provides a relatively simple yet powerful tool for exploring thermal phenomena at the nanoscale across various scientific domains.

Title: Soil-mimicking microfluidic devices reveal restricted flagellar motility of Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens under microconfinement
Authors: Moniellen Pires Monteiro, Juan Pablo Carrillo-Mora, Nahuel Gutiérrez, Sofía Montagna, Aníbal R. Lodeiro, María Luisa Cordero, V. I. Marconi
Abstract: Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens is a nitrogen-fixing symbiont of soybean, worldwide used as biofertilizer. This soil bacterium possesses two flagellar systems enabling it to swim in water-saturated soils. However, the motility in soil pores, which may be crucial for competitiveness for root nodulation, is difficult to predict. To address this gap, we fabricated microfluidic devices with networks of connected microchannels surrounding grains. In them, we directly visualise bacterial behaviour in transparent geometries mimicking minimalist soils-on-a-chip (SOCs). We measured the population velocities and changes of direction for two strains: the wild-type and a mutant with only a subpolar flagellum. A detailed statistical analysis revealed that both strains exhibited reduced speeds and increased changes of direction of 180$^\circ$, in channels of decreasing cross sectional area, down to a few microns in width. Interestingly, while the wild-type strain displayed faster swimming in unconfined spaces, this advantage was negated in the SOCs with the narrowest microchannels. We employed the measured motility parameters to propose a realistic model and simulate B. diazoefficiens confined dynamics being able to reproduce their behaviour, which additionally can be extended enabling further predictions for long time and macro scales. This multidisciplinary work, combining design, microfabrication, microbiology and modelling, offers useful methods to study soil bacteria and may be readily extended to other beneficial/harmful soil species.

Title: Meta-Ori: monolithic meta-origami for nonlinear inflatable soft actuators
Authors: Hugo de Souza Oliveira, Xin Li, Johannes Frey, Edoardo Milana
Abstract: The nonlinear mechanical response of soft materials and slender structures is purposefully harnessed to program functions by design in soft robotic actuators, such as sequencing, amplified response, fast energy release, etc. However, typical designs of nonlinear actuators - e.g. balloons, inverted membranes, springs - have limited design parameters space and complex fabrication processes, hindering the achievement of more elaborated functions. Mechanical metamaterials, on the other hand, have very large design parameter spaces, which allow fine-tuning of nonlinear behaviours. In this work, we present a novel approach to fabricate nonlinear inflatables based on metamaterials and origami (Meta-Ori) as monolithic parts that can be fully 3D printed via Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) using thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) commercial filaments. Our design consists of a metamaterial shell with cylindrical topology and nonlinear mechanical response combined with a Kresling origami inflatable acting as a pneumatic transmitter. We develop and release a design tool in the visual programming language Grasshopper to interactively design our Meta-Ori. We characterize the mechanical response of the metashell and the origami, and the nonlinear pressure-volume curve of the Meta-Ori inflatable and, lastly, we demonstrate the actuation sequencing of a bi-segment monolithic Meta-Ori soft actuator.

Title: Proprioceptive multistable mechanical metamaterial via soft capacitive sensors
Authors: Hugo de Souza Oliveira, Niloofar Saeedzadeh Khaanghah, Martijn Oetelmans, Niko Münzenrieder, Edoardo Milana
Abstract: The technological transition from soft machines to soft robots necessarily passes through the integration of soft electronics and sensors. This allows for the establishment of feedback control systems while preserving the softness of the robot embodiment. Multistable mechanical metamaterials are excellent building blocks of soft machines, as their nonlinear response can be tuned by design to accomplish several functions. In this work, we present the integration of soft capacitive sensors in a multistable mechanical metamaterial, to enable proprioceptive sensing of state changes. The metamaterial is a periodic arrangement of 4 bistable unit cells. Each unit cell has an integrated capacitive sensor. Both the metastructure and the sensors are made of soft materials (TPU) and are 3D printed. Our preliminary results show that the capacitance variation of the sensors can be linked to state transitions of the metamaterial, by capturing the nonlinear deformation.

Title: Controlling Competing Feedback Mechanisms for Programmable Patterns via Nonlinear Laser Lithography
Authors: Özgün Yavuz, Abdullah bin Aamir, Ihor Pavlov, Sezin Galioğlu, Ü. Seleme Nizam Bayrak, Petro Deminskyi, Onur Tokel, Serim Ilday, F. Ömer Ilday
Abstract: Controlling laser-induced pattern formation remains a long-standing challenge. A key advance was recognising the pivotal role of intrinsic feedback mechanisms in self-organisation, which enabled self-similar patterns with long-range order through nonlinear laser lithography. This concept was recently leveraged to surpass the diffraction limit. However, the demonstrated structures are relatively simple and material-specific, as they rely on a single assumed formation mechanism for each material. Here, we reveal the previously unknown coexistence of competing feedback mechanisms that drive distinct chemical and ablative processes, resulting in patterns with different symmetries. We show that one mechanism can be selectively activated, while completely suppressing the other, by tuning the laser parameters independently of the material. The competing mechanisms break surface symmetries in distinct lateral and vertical directions, and the selection can be dynamically inverted in situ, leading to rich surface chemistries and morphologies. We demonstrate the potential for applications through the maskless and ambient-air fabrication of complex composite patterns on diverse materials and substrates. These include seamlessly stitched superhydrophilic and superhydrophobic domains, structural colour, and a holographic temperature sensor. Combining programmable mechanism selection with recent demonstrations of sub-10 nm features could enable the maskless fabrication of composite structures that rival the capabilities of top-down nanofabrication techniques.

The formula obtained is compared with previous results proving to be completely equivalent to them. A discussion of equivalent formulas obtained in the literature is carried out.

Title: Maximum spreading of impacting shear-thinning and shear-thickening drops
Authors: Anahita Mobaseri, Satish Kumar, Xiang Cheng
Abstract: The maximum spreading of an impacting liquid drop is a key metric for characterizing the fundamental fluid process of drop impact. While extensively studied for Newtonian liquids, how far a non-Newtonian drop can spread upon impacting a solid substrate remains an open question. Here, by combining simulations, experiments, and scaling analyses, we establish a general framework for predicting the maximum spreading of drops of generalized Newtonian liquids, encompassing both shear-thinning and shear-thickening behaviors. Through an analysis of the energy budget at maximum spreading, we identify a characteristic shear rate that governs the viscous dissipation during drop impact. The finding allows us to map the spreading of non-Newtonian drops onto that of Newtonian drops, revealing the quantitative dependence of the maximum spreading diameter on various impact parameters and rheological properties of liquids. Our study addresses the long-standing challenge of understanding the impact dynamics of non-Newtonian drops, and provides valuable guidance for designing non-Newtonian liquids to achieve desired impact outcomes.

Title: A tale of two SUSYs
Authors: Stam Nicolis
Abstract: There are two approaches towards supersymmetry: The ``conventional approach'', in which the fields appear in the classical action and the ``stochastic approach'', in which they emerge upon introducing in the action the contribution of a certain determinant. The second approach relies, in particular, on the so-called Nicolai map. The relation between the two approaches hasn't been clarified and the subject of this contribution is to spell it out. In particular the interpretation proposed by Parisi and Sourlas has remained quite incomplete. The subject of this contribution is to spell out in what way the two approaches complement each other and how the second can provide insights for the first.

Title: Measurement-induced back-action and spin-to-polarization mapping in a quantum dot-based receiver

Abstract: Polarization-encoded spin-photon interfaces constitute promising candidates for the development of stationary nodes used as photon receivers, for quantum communication and distributed quantum computing. Here we introduce a time-resolved tomography approach which allows observing the dynamics of an electron spin, in a semiconductor quantum dot, mapped onto the dynamics of the polarization state of reflected photons. Through a single tomography experiment, we infer all the relevant spin dynamics timescales, including precession, decoherence and relaxation times. We also demonstrate and quantify the measurement back-action induced, on the embedded spin qubit, by the detection of a single reflected photon. We show that the induced population and coherence of the spin state can be tuned by the chosen polarization basis of the measurement. The control of the photon-induced back-action on the embedded spin qubit constitutes a crucial requirement for the use of spin-photon interfaces as quantum receivers.

Title: JAX-BTE: A GPU-Accelerated Differentiable Solver for Phonon Boltzmann Transport Equations
Authors: Wenjie Shang, Jiahang Zhou, J.P. Panda, Zhihao Xu, Yi Liu, Pan Du, Jian-Xun Wang, Tengfei Luo
Abstract: This paper introduces JAX-BTE, a GPU-accelerated, differentiable solver for the phonon Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE) based on differentiable programming. JAX-BTE enables accurate, efficient and differentiable multiscale thermal modeling by leveraging high-performance GPU computing and automatic differentiation. The solver efficiently addresses the high-dimensional and complex integro-differential nature of the phonon BTE, facilitating both forward simulations and data-augmented inverse simulations through end-to-end optimization. Validation is performed across a range of 1D to 3D simulations, including complex FinFET structures, in both forward and inverse settings, demonstrating excellent performance and reliability. JAX-BTE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art BTE solvers in forward simulations and uniquely enables inverse simulations, making it a powerful tool for multiscale thermal analysis and design for semiconductor devices.

Title: Realization of a non-Hermitian Haldane model in circuits
Authors: Rujiang Li, Wencai Wang, Xiangyu Kong, Bo Lv, Yongtao Jia, Huibin Tao, Pengfei Li, Ying Liu
Abstract: The Haldane model is the simplest yet most powerful topological lattice model exhibiting various phases, including the Dirac semimetal phase and the anomalous quantum Hall phase (also known as the Chern insulator). Although considered unlikely to be physically directly realizable in condensed matter systems, it has been experimentally demonstrated in other physical settings such as cold atoms, where Hermiticity is usually preserved. Extending this model to the non-Hermitian regime with energy non-conservation can significantly enrich topological phases that lack Hermitian counterparts; however, such exploration remains experimentally challenging due to the lack of suitable physical platforms. Here, based on electric circuits, we report the experimental realization of a genuine non-Hermitian Haldane model with asymmetric next-nearest-neighbor hopping. We observe two previously uncovered phases: a non-Hermitian Chern insulator and a non-Hermitian semimetal phase, both exhibiting boundary-dependent amplifying or dissipative chiral edge states. Our work paves the way for exploring non-Hermiticity-induced unconventional topological phases in the Haldane model.

Title: Acceleration Theorem for Low-Dimensional Electron Systems with Off-Diagonal Effective Mass Components
Authors: Nobuya Mori, Hajime Tanaka, Jo Okada
Abstract: The motion of electrons under homogeneously applied electric fields in low-dimensional systems with non-zero off-diagonal effective mass (ODEM) is studied. The equation describing the time evolution of a probability coefficient of finding an electron in a subband is derived using the Krieger-Iafrate theory in the effective mass approximation. It is shown that an electron can change subbands during free flight due to the ODEM-induced inter-subband transitions. By introducing an effective dispersion defined as a weighted average of the subband dispersions, it is also shown that the initial acceleration of an electron effectively follows the bulk dispersion relation. The results obtained suggest that the transport properties of the quantized systems when many subbands are occupied in the weak confinement limit approach the values one would find without considering the quantization.

Title: Force-Free Molecular Dynamics Through Autoregressive Equivariant Networks
Authors: Fabian L. Thiemann, Thiago Reschützegger, Massimiliano Esposito, Tseden Taddese, Juan D. Olarte-Plata, Fausto Martelli
Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations play a crucial role in scientific research. Yet their computational cost often limits the timescales and system sizes that can be explored. Most data-driven efforts have been focused on reducing the computational cost of accurate interatomic forces required for solving the equations of motion. Despite their success, however, these machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are still bound to small time-steps. In this work, we introduce TrajCast, a transferable and data-efficient framework based on autoregressive equivariant message passing networks that directly updates atomic positions and velocities lifting the constraints imposed by traditional numerical integration. We benchmark our framework across various systems, including a small molecule, crystalline material, and bulk liquid, demonstrating excellent agreement with reference MD simulations for structural, dynamical, and energetic properties. Depending on the system, TrajCast allows for forecast intervals up to $30\times$ larger than traditional MD time-steps, generating over 15 ns of trajectory data per day for a solid with more than 4,000 atoms. By enabling efficient large-scale simulations over extended timescales, TrajCast can accelerate materials discovery and explore physical phenomena beyond the reach of traditional simulations and experiments. An open-source implementation of TrajCast is accessible under this https URL.

Title: Light-Driven Skyrmion Crystal Generation in Plasmonic Metasurfaces Through the Inverse Faraday Effect
Authors: Xingyu Yang, Chantal Hareau, Jack Gartside, Mathieu Mivelle
Abstract: Skyrmions are topological structures defined by a winding vector configuration that yields a quantized topological charge. In magnetic materials, skyrmions manifest as stable, mobile spin textures, positioning them at the forefront of spintronics research. Meanwhile, their optical counterparts unlock new possibilities for manipulating and directing light at the nanoscale. Exploring the territories where magnetism and optics meet therefore holds immense promise for ultrafast control over magnetic processes. Here, we report the generation of a skyrmion-topological lattice through the inverse Faraday effect in a plasmonic metasurface. Specifically, a hexagonal array of gold nanodisks induces unidirectional drift photocurrents in each nanodisk, while counterpropagating phantom currents arise in the hexagonal interstices. This interplay creates a lattice of skyrmionic magnetic textures. Crucially, the all optical, large scale formation of skyrmions potentially at ultrafast timescales offers a pathway for integrating these topological spin textures into magnetic materials, laying the groundwork for next-generation data storage and processing technologies.

Title: Feature learning from non-Gaussian inputs: the case of Independent Component Analysis in high dimensions
Authors: Fabiola Ricci, Lorenzo Bardone, Sebastian Goldt
Abstract: Deep neural networks learn structured features from complex, non-Gaussian inputs, but the mechanisms behind this process remain poorly understood. Our work is motivated by the observation that the first-layer filters learnt by deep convolutional neural networks from natural images resemble those learnt by independent component analysis (ICA), a simple unsupervised method that seeks the most non-Gaussian projections of its inputs. This similarity suggests that ICA provides a simple, yet principled model for studying feature learning. Here, we leverage this connection to investigate the interplay between data structure and optimisation in feature learning for the most popular ICA algorithm, FastICA, and stochastic gradient descent (SGD), which is used to train deep networks. We rigorously establish that FastICA requires at least $n\gtrsim d^4$ samples to recover a single non-Gaussian direction from $d$-dimensional inputs on a simple synthetic data model. We show that vanilla online SGD outperforms FastICA, and prove that the optimal sample complexity $n \gtrsim d^2$ can be reached by smoothing the loss, albeit in a data-dependent way. We finally demonstrate the existence of a search phase for FastICA on ImageNet, and discuss how the strong non-Gaussianity of said images compensates for the poor sample complexity of FastICA.

Title: Strain effects in a directly bonded diamond-on-insulator substrate
Authors: Ioannis Varveris, Gianni D. Aliberti, Tianyin Chen, Filip A. Sfetcu, Diederik J. W. Dekker, Alfred Schuurmans, Nikolaj K. Nitzsche, Salahuddin Nur, Ryoichi Ishihara
Abstract: The direct bonding process of a diamond-on-insulator (DOI) substrate enables monolithic integration of diamond photonic structures for quantum computing by improving photon collection efficiency and entanglement generation rate between emitters. It also addresses key fabrication challenges, such as robustness, bonding strength, and scalability. In this study, we investigate strain effects in DOI substrates following direct bonding. Strain generation is expected near the diamond-SiO2/Si interface due to thermal expansion coefficient mismatch between the bonded materials. Strain-induced lattice distortions are characterized using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond via optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) and photoluminescence (PL) mapping. PL mapping reveals interference fringes in unbonded regions, indicating bonding irregularities. Depth-resolved ODMR measurements show a volumetric strain component increase of ~0.45 MHz and a shear component increase of ~0.71 MHz between the top surface and the DOI interface. However, ODMR signal contrast and peak linewidth remain largely unaffected, suggesting no visible deterioration in the optical properties of the emitters. By combining ODMR and PL mapping, this work establishes a robust methodology for assessing bonding quality and strain impact on NV centers, an essential step toward advancing scalable quantum technologies and integrated photonic circuits.

Title: Efficient Construction of Feasible Solutions in Column Generation using Quantum Annealing
Authors: Taisei Takabayashi, Naoki Maruyama, Takuma Yoshihara, Renichiro Haba, Masayuki Ohzeki
Abstract: Column generation (CG) has been used to solve constrained 0-1 quadratic programming problems. The pricing problem, which is iteratively solved in CG, can be reduced to an unconstrained 0-1 quadratic programming problem, allowing for the efficient application of quantum annealing (QA). The solutions obtained by CG are continuous relaxations, which cannot be practically used as feasible 0-1 solutions. This study proposes a post-processing method for constructing feasible 0-1 solutions from the continuous relaxations obtained through CG. Numerical experiments on randomly generated problems demonstrate that CG with the proposed post-processing yields solutions comparable to commercial solvers with significantly reduced computation time.

Title: Jordanian deformation of the non-compact and $\mathfrak{sl}_2 $-invariant $XXX_{-1/2}$ spin-chain
Authors: Riccardo Borsato, Miguel García Fernández
Abstract: Using a Drinfeld twist of Jordanian type, we construct a deformation of the non-compact and $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-invariant $XXX_{-1/2}$ spin-chain. Before the deformation, the seed model can be understood as a sector of the $\mathfrak{psu}(2,2|4)$-invariant spin-chain encoding the spectral problem of $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills at one loop in the planar limit. The deformation gives rise to interesting features because, while being integrable, the Hamiltonian is non-hermitian and non-diagonalisable, so that it only admits a Jordan decomposition. Moreover, the eigenvalues of the deformed Hamiltonian coincide with those of the original undeformed spin-chain. We use explicit examples as well as the techniques of the coordinate and of the algebraic Bethe ansatz to discuss the construction of the (generalised) eigenvectors of the deformed model. We also show that the deformed spin-chain is equivalent to an undeformed one with twisted boundary conditions, and that it may be derived from a scaling limit of the non-compact $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$-invariant $XXZ_{-1/2} $ spin-chain.

Title: Mitigation of correlated readout errors without randomized measurements
Authors: Adrian Skasberg Aasen, Andras Di Giovanni, Hannes Rotzinger, Alexey V. Ustinov, Martin Gärttner
Abstract: Quantum simulation, the study of strongly correlated quantum matter using synthetic quantum systems, has been the most successful application of quantum computers to date. It often requires determining observables with high precision, for example when studying critical phenomena near quantum phase transitions. Thus, readout errors must be carefully characterized and mitigated in data post-processing, using scalable and noise-model agnostic protocols. We present a readout error mitigation protocol that uses only single-qubit Pauli measurements and avoids experimentally challenging randomized measurements. The proposed approach captures a very broad class of correlated noise models and is scalable to large qubit systems. It is based on a complete and efficient characterization of few-qubit correlated positive operator-valued measures (POVMs), using overlapping detector tomography. To assess the effectiveness of the protocol, observables are extracted from simulations involving up to 100 qubits employing readout errors obtained from experiments with superconducting qubits.

Title: Critical quantum metrology using non-Hermitian spin model with RT-symmetry
Authors: Keshav Das Agarwal, Tanoy Kanti Konar, Leela Ganesh Chandra Lakkaraju, Aditi Sen De
Abstract: The non-Hermitian transverse XY model with Kaplan-Shekhtman-Entin-Wohlman-Aharony (KSEA) interaction having RT-symmetry, referred to as iKSEA model, possesses both an exceptional point at which eigenvectors coalesce and a quantum critical point where gap-closing occurs. To precisely estimate the magnetic field of the system, we prove that the quantum Fisher information (QFI) of the ground state of the iKSEA model, which is a lower bound of the precision quantified by the root mean square error, scales as $N^2$, with N being the system-size. This provides Heisenberg scaling both at the quantum critical point and the exceptional point in the thermodynamic limit. It indicates that when the system is in contact with the bath, resulting in this non-Hermitian model, reservoir engineering can provide enhanced precision of system parameters. Additionally, we demonstrate analytically that, in contrast to Hermitian systems, QFI surpasses the Heisenberg limit and achieves super-Heisenberg scaling ($\sim N^6$), when the strength of the KSEA interaction approaches the anisotropy parameter, permitting competition between non-hermiticity and hermiticity features, as long as the system size is moderate.

Title: Mean field model of contagion processes in urban traffic networks
Authors: Arturo Berrones-Santos, Gerardo Palafox-Castillo, Sareé González Huesca
Abstract: Theoretical arguments and empirical evidence for the emergence of macroscopic epidemic type behavior, in the form of Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) or Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) processes in urban traffic congestion from microscopic network flows is given. Moreover, it's shown that the emergence of SIS/SIR implies a relationship between traffic flow and density, which is consistent with observations of the so called Fundamental Diagram of Traffic, which is a characteristic signature of vehicle movement phenomena that spans multiple scales. Our results provide a plausible explanation for this scale-spanning signature and put in more firm grounds recent findings that indicate that traffic congestion at the aggregate level can be modeled by simple contagion dynamics.

Title: Universality of Rényi Entropy in Conformal Field Theory
Authors: Yuya Kusuki, Hirosi Ooguri, Sridip Pal
Abstract: We use the thermal effective theory to prove that, for the vacuum state in any conformal field theory in $d$ dimensions, the $n$-th Rényi entropy $S_A^{(n)}$ behaves as $S_A^{(n)} = \frac{f}{(2\pi n)^{d-1}} \frac{ {\rm Area}(\partial A)}{(d-2)\epsilon^{d-2}}\left(1+O(n)\right)$ in the $n \rightarrow 0$ limit when the boundary of the entanglement domain $A$ is spherical with the UV cutoff $\epsilon$.The theory dependence is encapsulated in the cosmological constant $f$ in the thermal effective action. Using this result, we estimate the density of states for large eigenvalues of the modular Hamiltonian for the domain $A$. In two dimensions, we can use the hot spot idea to derive more powerful formulas valid for arbitrary positive $n$. We discuss the difference between two and higher dimensions and clarify the applicability of the hot spot idea. We also use the thermal effective theory to derive an analog of the Cardy formula for boundary operators in higher dimensions.

Title: Topological Phase Transition and Geometrical Frustration in Fourier Photonic Simulator
Authors: Yuxuan Sun, Weiru Fan, Xingqi Xu, Da-Wei Wang, Hai-Qing Lin
Abstract: XY models with continuous spin orientation play a pivotal role in understanding topological phase transitions and emergent frustration phenomena, such as superconducting and superfluid phase transitions. However, the complex energy landscapes arising from frustrated lattice geometries and competing spin interactions make these models computationally intractable. To address this challenge, we design a programmable photonic spin simulator capable of emulating XY models with tunable lattice geometries and spin couplings, allowing systematic exploration of their statistical behavior. We experimentally observe the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition in a square-lattice XY model with nearest-neighbor interactions, accurately determining its critical temperature. Expanding to frustrated systems, we implement the approach in triangular and honeycomb lattices, uncovering sophisticated phase transitions and frustration effects, which are consistent with theoretical predictions. This versatile platform opens avenues for probing unexplored XY model phenomena across diverse geometries and interaction schemes, with potential applications in solving complex optimization and machine learning problems.

Title: Two-color magneto-optical trapping of ytterbium atoms
Authors: Xiao Li, Yufei Wang, Ligeng Yu, Bo Song
Abstract: We report laser cooling and trapping of ytterbium atoms in a two-color magneto-optical trap (MOT). Benefited from both the broad singlet transition ($^1\text{S}_0\rightarrow {}^1\text{P}_1$) and the narrow intercombination transition ($^1\text{S}_0\rightarrow {}^3\text{P}_1$) of ytterbium atoms, the two-color MOT enables rapid loading and efficient cooling. We systematically investigate the shielding effect of the intercombination transition by examining the atom loading and loss rates of single-color and two-color MOTs. Our findings are general and can be extended to other alkaline earth(-like) atoms.

Title: Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering Study of Ca$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$
Authors: K. von Arx, F. Forte, M. Horio, V. Granata, Q. Wang, L. Das, Y. Sassa, R. Fittipaldi, C. G. Fatuzzo, O. Ivashko, Y. Tseng, E. Paris, A. Vecchione, T. Schmitt, M. Cuoco, J. Chang
Abstract: We present a combined oxygen $K$-edge x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) study of the bilayer ruthenate Ca$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$. Our RIXS experiments on Ca$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ were carried out on the overlapping planar and inter-planar oxygen resonances, which are distinguishable from the apical one. Comparison to equivalent oxygen $K$-edge spectra recorded on band-Mott insulating Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ is made. In contrast to Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ spectra, which contain excitations linked to Mott physics, Ca$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ spectra feature only intra-$t_{2g}$ ones that do not directly involve the Coulomb energy scale. As found in Ca$_2$RuO$_4$, we resolve two intra-$t_{2g}$ excitations in Ca$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$. Moreover, the lowest lying excitation in Ca$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ shows a significant dispersion, revealing a collective character differently from what is observed in Ca$_2$RuO$_4$. Theoretical modelling supports the interpretation of this lowest energy excitation in Ca$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ as a magnetic transverse mode with multi-particle character, whereas the corresponding excitation in Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ is assigned to combined longitudinal and transverse spin modes. These fundamental differences are discussed in terms of the inequivalent magnetic ground-state manifestations in Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ and Ca$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$.

Title: Scaling in Kinetics of Supercooled Liquids
Authors: B. Zhang, D. M. Zhang, D. Y. Sun, X. G. Gong
Abstract: The present study introduces a renormalization based approach to investigate the relaxation dynamics within supercooled liquids. By applying a numerical scale transformation to potential energies along the temporal axis, we have established a novel framework that elucidates the underlying kinetics of supercooled liquids. Our findings indicate that the skewness of the potential energy distribution attains its maximum at a characteristic time scale, D, which exhibits a Curie like scaling relationship with temperature. This scaling relationship is characterized by an exponent, g, that experiences a discontinuous transition at a critical cooling rate, signifying a kinetic like phase this http URL further demonstrate that g maintains an approximate scaling relationship with the cooling rate, where the product of g and the logarithm of the cooling rate is approximately this http URL constant, however, varies depending on whether the cooling rate is above or below the critical value, effectively classifying supercooled liquids into two distinct categories: the glass transition as the destiny of supercooled liquid, GDL, and the crystallization as the destiny of supercooled liquid, CDL. Furthermore, we identify that Ts corresponds to the glass transition temperature for GDL and the crystallization temperature for CDL, respectively. We have successfully developed a theoretical model,which not only derives the Curie like power law but also provides profound insights into the physical implications of D, g and Ts. This research delineates the differences between GDL and CDL, and offers a fresh perspective for exploring the nature of glasses. The findings contribute to the broader understanding of the dynamics of supercooled liquids and the mechanisms of glass formation.

Title: Resolving the Corbino Shockley-Ramo Paradox for Hydrodynamic Current Noise
Authors: Aaron Hui
Abstract: Johnson noise thermometry enables direct measurement of the electron temperature, a valuable probe of many-body systems. Practical use of this technique calls for non-equilibrium generalizations of the Johnson-Nyquist theorem. For a hydrodynamic Corbino device, however, a naïve use of the Shockley-Ramo theorem alongside the "Corbino paradox" leads to yet another paradox: bulk velocity fluctuations cannot be measured by the contacts. In this work, we resolve the unphysical "Corbino Shockley-Ramo paradox" by correctly formulating the hydrodynamic Shockley-Ramo problem. This allows us to properly formulate the problem of current noise in an hydrodynamic multi-terminal device of arbitrary geometry, as well as validate a previously unjustified assumption for rectangular geometry results. As an example, we compute the Johnson noise in a hydrodynamic Corbino device, where we find a suppression of Johnson noise with magnetic field. This unusual characteristic serves as a strong signature of viscous hydrodynamic behavior.

Title: Solute Co-Segregation Mechanisms at Low-Angle Grain Boundaries in Magnesium: A Combined Atomic-Scale Experimental and Modeling Study
Authors: Risheng Pei, Joé Petrazoller, Achraf Atila, Simon Arnoldi, Lei Xiao, Xiaoqing Liu, Hexin Wang, Sandra Korte-Kerzel, Stéphane Berbenni, Thiebaud Richeton, Julien Guénolé, Zhuocheng Xie, Talal Al-Samman
Abstract: Solute segregation at low-angle grain boundaries (LAGBs) critically affects the microstructure and mechanical properties of magnesium (Mg) alloys. In modern alloys containing multiple substitutional elements, understanding solute-solute interactions at microstructural defects becomes essential for alloy design. This study investigates the co-segregation mechanisms of calcium (Ca), zinc (Zn), and aluminum (Al) at a LAGB in a dilute AZX010 Mg alloy by combining atomic-scale experimental and modeling techniques. Three-dimensional atom probe tomography (3D-APT) revealed significant segregation of Ca, Zn, and Al at the LAGB, with Ca forming linear segregation patterns along dislocation arrays characteristic of the LAGB. Clustering analysis showed increased Ca-Ca pairs at the boundary, indicating synergistic solute interactions. Atomistic simulations and elastic dipole calculations demonstrated that larger Ca atoms prefer tensile regions around dislocations, while smaller Zn and Al atoms favor compressive areas. These simulations also found that Ca-Ca co-segregation near dislocation cores is energetically more favorable than other solute pairings, explaining the enhanced Ca clustering observed experimentally. Thermodynamic modeling incorporating calculated segregation energies and solute-solute interactions accurately predicted solute concentrations at the LAGB, aligning with experimental data. The findings emphasize the importance of solute interactions at dislocation cores in Mg alloys, offering insights for improving mechanical performance through targeted alloying and grain boundary engineering.

Title: Gauged cooling of topological excitations and emergent fermions on quantum simulators
Authors: Gilad Kishony, Mark S. Rudner, Achim Rosch, Erez Berg
Abstract: Simulated cooling is a robust method for preparing low-energy states of many-body Hamiltonians on near-term quantum simulators. In such schemes, a subset of the simulator's spins (or qubits) are treated as a ``bath,'' which extracts energy and entropy from the system of interest. However, such protocols are inefficient when applied to systems whose excitations are highly non-local in terms of the microscopic degrees of freedom, such as topological phases of matter; such excitations are difficult to extract by a local coupling to a bath. We explore a route to overcome this obstacle by encoding of the microscopic degrees of freedom into those of the quantum simulator in a non-local manner. To illustrate the approach, we show how to efficiently cool the ferromagnetic phase of the quantum Ising model, whose excitations are domain walls, via a ``gauged cooling'' protocol in which the Ising spins are coupled to a $Z_2$ gauge field that simultaneously acts as a reservoir for removing excitations. We show that our protocol can prepare the ground states of the ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases equally efficiently. The gauged cooling protocol naturally extends to (interacting) fermionic systems, where it is equivalent to cooling by coupling to a fermionic bath via single-fermion hopping.

Title: Frozen Cheerios effect: Particle-particle interaction induced by an advancing solidification front
Authors: Jochem G. Meijer, Vincent Bertin, Detlef Lohse
Abstract: Particles at liquid interfaces have the tendency to cluster due to capillary forces competing with gravitational buoyancy (i.e., normal to the distorted free surface). This is known as the Cheerios effect. Here we experimentally and theoretically study the interaction between two submerged particles near an advancing water-ice interface during the freezing process. Particles that are thermally more conductive than water are observed to attract each other and form clusters once frozen. We call this feature the frozen Cheerios effect, where interactions are driven by alterations to the direction of the experienced repelling force (i.e., normal to the distorted isotherm). On the other hand, particles less conductive than water separate, highlighting the importance of thermal conduction during freezing. Based on existing models for single particle trapping in ice, we develop an understanding of multiple particle interaction. We find that the overall efficacy of the particle-particle interaction critically depends on the solidification front velocity. Our theory explains why the thermal conductivity mismatch between the particles and water dictates the attractive/repulsive nature of the particle-particle interaction.

Title: Entropy-Assisted Nanosecond stochastic operation in perpendicular superparamagnetic tunnel junctions
Authors: Lucile Soumah, Louise Desplat, Nhat-Tan Phan, Ahmed Sidi El Valli, Advait Madhavan, Florian Disdier, Stéphane Auffret, Ricardo Sousa, Ursula Ebels, Philippe Talatchian
Abstract: We demonstrate a good agreement between mean dwell times measured in 50~nm diameter, perpendicularly magnetized superparamagnetic tunnel junctions (SMTJ), and theoretical predictions based on Langer's theory. Due to a large entropic contribution, the theory yields Arrhenius prefactors in the femtosecond range for the measured junctions, in stark contrast to the typically assumed value of 1~ns. Thanks to the low prefactors, and fine-tuning of the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, we report measured mean dwell times as low as 2.7~ns under an in-plane applied field at negligible bias voltage. Under a perpendicular applied field, we predict a Meyer-Neldel compensation phenomenon, whereby the prefactor scales like an exponential of the activation energy, in line with the exponential dependence of the measured dwell time on the field. We further predict the occurrence of (sub)nanosecond dwell times as a function of effective anisotropy and junction diameter at zero bias voltage. These findings pave the way towards the development of ultrafast, low-power, unconventional computing schemes operating by leveraging thermal noise in perpendicular SMTJs, which can be scaled down below 20~nm.

Title: Evidence and quantification of memory effects in competitive first passage events
Authors: M. Dolgushev, T.V. Mendes, B. Gorin, K. Xie, N. Levernier, O. Bénichou, H. Kellay, R. Voituriez, T. Guérin
Abstract: Splitting probabilities quantify the likelihood of a given outcome out of competitive events. This key observable of random walk theory, historically introduced as the gambler's ruin problem, is well understood for memoryless (Markovian) processes. However, in complex systems such as polymer fluids, the motion of a particle should typically be described as a process with memory, for which splitting probabilities are much less characterized analytically. Here, we introduce an analytical approach that provides the splitting probabilities for one-dimensional isotropic non-Markovian Gaussian processes with stationary increments, in the case of two targets. This analysis shows that splitting probabilities are controlled by the out of equilibrium trajectories observed after the first passage. This is directly evidenced in a prototypical experimental reaction scheme in viscoelastic fluids. These results are extended to $d$-dimensional processes in large confining volumes, opening a path towards the study of competitive events in complex media.

Title: Core structure of dislocations in ordered ferromagnetic FeCo
Authors: Aleksei Egorov, Antoine Kraych, Matous Mrovec, Ralf Drautz, Thomas Hammerschmidt
Abstract: We elucidated the core structure of screw dislocations in ordered B2 FeCo using a recent magnetic bond-order potential (BOP) [Egorov et al., Phys. Rev. Mater. 7, 044403 (2023)]. We corroborated that dislocations in B2 FeCo exist in pairs separated by antiphase boundaries. The equilibrium separation is about 50 A, which demands large-scale atomistic simulations - inaccessible for density functional theory but attainable with BOP. We performed atomistic simulations of these separated dislocations with BOP and predicted that they reside in degenerate core structures. Also, dislocations induce changes in the local electronic structure and magnetic moments.

Title: Open reaction-diffusion systems: bridging probabilistic theory and simulations across scales
Authors: Mauricio J. del Razo, Margarita Kostré
Abstract: Reaction-diffusion processes are the foundational model for a diverse range of complex systems, ranging from biochemical reactions to social agent-based phenomena. The underlying dynamics of these systems occur at the individual particle/agent level, and in realistic applications, they often display interaction with their environment through energy or material exchange with a reservoir. This requires intricate mathematical considerations, especially in the case of material exchange since the varying number of particles/agents results in ``on-the-fly'' modification of the system dimension. In this work, we first overview the probabilistic description of reaction-diffusion processes at the particle level, which readily handles varying number of particles. We then extend this model to consistently incorporate interactions with macroscopic material reservoirs. Based on the resulting expressions, we bridge the probabilistic description with macroscopic concentration-based descriptions for linear and nonlinear reaction-diffusion systems, as well as for an archetypal open reaction-diffusion system. Using these mathematical bridges across scales, we finally develop numerical schemes for open reaction-diffusion systems, which we implement in two illustrative examples. This work establishes a methodological workflow to bridge particle-based probabilistic descriptions with macroscopic concentration-based descriptions of reaction-diffusion in open settings, laying the foundations for a multiscale theoretical framework upon which to construct theory and simulation schemes that are consistent across scales.

Title: Wrinkling instability of 3D auxetic bilayers in tension
Authors: Sairam Pamulaparthi Venkata, Yuxin Fu, Yibin Fu, Hooman Danesh, Michel Destrade, Valentina Balbi
Abstract: Bilayers, soft substrates coated with stiff films, are commonly found in nature with examples including skin tissue, vesicles, and organ membranes. They exhibit different types of instabilities when subjected to compression, depending on the contrast in material properties between the two components. In this work, we unravel the mechanisms behind wrinkling instabilities in auxetic bilayer systems under uniaxial tension. We find that a soft bilayer in tension can experience significant lateral contraction, and with sufficient contrast in Poisson ratios, compressive stresses may induce wrinkles aligned with the tensile direction. We analytically model the onset of wrinkles and validate our predictions using Finite Element simulations in ABAQUS. Our findings reveal that wrinkles occur when the Poisson ratio of the substrate is greater than that of the film. As the two Poisson ratios converge to a common value, the critical stretch for instability shoots up rapidly and the wrinkles disappear. We also confirm these results through asymptotic analysis. Using inverse analysis, we design film microstructures to achieve desired effective Poisson ratios and further validate the effective properties with the Finite Element code FEAP. We show that the critical stretch ratio for buckling in auxetic structures with microstructural patterns is in strong agreement with the homogenized model predictions. The proposed method has significant potential for controlling surface patterns in auxetic skin grafts and hydrogel organ patches under mechanical loads. Moreover, the asymptotic expressions for compressible bilayers developed in this work can also be applied under finite strain for buckling-based metrology.

Title: Power-Efficiency Constraint for Chemical Motors
Authors: Ruo-Xun Zhai, Hui Dong
Abstract: Chemical gradients provide the primordial energy for biological functions by driving the mechanical movement of microscopic engines. Their thermodynamic properties remain elusive, especially concerning the dynamic change in energy demand in biological systems. In this article, we derive a constraint relation between the output power and the conversion efficiency for a chemically fueled steady-state rotary motor analogous to the $\mathrm{F}_o$ motor of ATPase. We find that the efficiency at maximum power is half of the maximum quasi static efficiency. These findings shall aid in the understanding of natural chemical engines and inspire the manual design and control of chemically fueled microscale engines.

Title: Designing a polymerized phenalenyl tessellation molecule to realize a super-honeycomb antiferromagnetic S = 3/2 spin system
Authors: Kenshin Komatsu, Naoki Morishita, Motoharu Kitatani, Koichi Kusakabe
Abstract: In a multiply hydrogenated polymer of phenalenyl tessellation molecules (PTMs), spatially overlapping zero modes appear, and three spin-aligned electron spins per PTM are generated through direct exchange interactions in the strongly correlated electron system. This interaction was used to design a two-dimensional (2D) $S = 3/2$ Heisenberg spin system on a honeycomb lattice. Simulations of the electronic structure using density functional theory with the Wannierization method revealed an array of nonbonding molecular orbitals (zero modes) in the hydrogenated nanographene structure. Our analysis of the onsite interaction strength indicated that each zero mode was half-filled with a spin-active electron owing to electron correlation effects. The low-energy subspace of the resulting zero mode-tight-binding model suggests the formation of a 2D antiferromagnetic $S = 3/2$ Heisenberg system with an entangled quantum spin ground state.

Title: Interplay between Domain Walls in Type-II Superconductors and Gradients of Temperature/Spin Density
Authors: Takuma Kanakubo, Hiroto Adachi, Masanori Ichioka, Yusuke Kato
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the motion of a domain wall in type-II superconductors driven by inhomogeneities of temperature or spin density. The model consists of the time-dependent GinzburgLandau equation and the thermal/spin diffusion equation whose transport coefficients (the thermal/spin conductivity and the spin relaxation time) depend on the order parameter, interpolating the values for the superconducting and the normal states. Numerical and analytical calculations show that the domain wall moves toward the higher temperature/spin-density region where the order parameter is suppressed. We can understand the motions of the domain walls as dynamical processes reducing the loss of condensation energy. We also analyze the driving force, the viscous force, the thermal force, and the force due to the spin accumulation gradient, on the basis of the momentum balance relations.

Title: Energy Windows Augmented Plane Waves (EWAPW)
Authors: Garry Goldstein
Abstract: In this work we present a new basis set for electronic structure calculations of crystalline solids aimed at applications to Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods. In this construction, Energy Windows Augmented Plane Waves (EWAPW), we take advantage of the fact that most DFT calculations use a convergence loop in order to obtain the eigenstates of a final Kohn Sham (KS) Hamiltonian matrix - that is iterate solve the KS equations till the eigenstates of the KS Hamiltonian matrix also give the appropriate electron density needed to obtain the KS potential needed for that KS Hamiltonian matrix. Here we propose that, for the basis used at each step of the iteration, we use the previous eigenstate basis, in the interstitial region, but augmented inside the Muffin Tin (MT) sphere with the solution to the spherically averaged KS Hamiltonian for the linearization energy of the energy window of the energy of that eigenstate. Indeed, to reduce the number of times the spherically averaged KS potential needs to be solved inside the MT spheres it is advantageous to use energy windows and solve the spherically averaged KS Hamiltonian inside the MT region only once per window (at the linearization energy relevant to that window) so that the spherically averaged KS Hamiltonian needs only be solved a small number of times per iteration of the solution of the KS equations. For practical applications it is reasonable to have on the order of ten to one hundred windows. This method combines the implicit energy dependence of the basis of methods such as Projected Augmented Wave functions (PAW) with the ability of the basis set to adjust to the solid state (rather then atomic) environment which is similar to basis sets such as Linearized Augmented Plane Waves (LAPW).

Title: A Graph Random Walk Method for Calculating Time-of-Flight Charge Mobility in Organic Semiconductors from Multiscale Simulations
Authors: Zhongquan Chen, Pim van der Hoorn, Björn Baumeier
Abstract: We present a graph random walk (GRW) method for the study of charge transport properties of complex molecular materials in the time-of-flight regime. The molecules forming the material are represented by the vertices of a directed weighted graph, and the charge carriers are random walkers. The edge weights are rates for elementary jumping processes for a charge carrier to move along the edge and are determined from a combination of the energies of the involved vertices and an interaction strength. Exclusions are built into the random walk to account for the Pauli exclusion principle. In time-of-flight experiments, charge carriers are injected into the material and the time until they reach a collecting electrode is recorded. Our approach allows direct evaluation of the expected hitting time of the collecting nodes in terms of a sparse, linear system, avoiding numerically cumbersome and potentially fluctuations-prone methods based on explicit time evolution from solutions of a high-dimensional Master Equation or from kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC). We validate the GRW approach by numerical studies of charge dynamics of single and multiple carriers in diffusive and drift-diffusive regimes using a surrogate lattice model of a realistic material whose properties have been simulated within a multiscale model framework combining quantum-mechanical and molecular-mechanics methods. The surrogate model allows varying types and strengths of energetic disorder from the reference baseline. Comparison with results from the Master Equation confirms the theoretical equivalence of both approaches also in numerical implementations. We further show that KMC results show substantial deviations due to inadequate sampling. All in all, we find that the GRW method provides a powerful alternative to the more commonly used methods without sampling issues and with the benefit of making use of sparse matrix methods.

Title: Monopole magnetohydrodynamics on a plane: Magnetosonic waves and dynamo instability
Authors: Debarghya Banerjee, Roderich Moessner, Piotr Surówka
Abstract: Condensed matter systems can host emergent `vacua' with particles, fields and dimension different from that of the universe we inhabit. Motivated by the appearance of emergent gauge fields with both electric and magnetic charges, we consider the fate of electromagnetism in two dimensions in the presence of magnetic monopoles. We find that generically electromagnetic fields are damped due to resistive effects. However, we can still identify a magnetohydrodynamic regime. It exhibits magnetosonic waves which, unlike in $d=3$, are isotropic, to which there is a contribution from the odd viscosity coefficient present in the system. Further, we find a dynamo action, which unlike in $d=3$ requires compressibility of the flow.

Title: Ranking nodes in bipartite systems with a non-linear iterative map
Authors: Andrea Mazzolini, Michele Caselle, Matteo Osella
Abstract: Ranking nodes in networks according to a defined measure of importance is an extensively studied task, with applications in ecology, economic trade networks, and social networks. This paper introduces a method based on a non-linear iterative map to evaluate node relevance in bipartite networks. By tuning a single parameter $\gamma$, the method captures different concepts of node importance, including established measures like degree centrality, eigenvector centrality and the fitness-complexity ranking. The algorithm's flexibility allows for efficient ranking optimization tailored to specific tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms. We apply this method to ecological mutualistic networks, where ranking quality can be assessed by the extinction area - the rate at which the system collapses when species are removed in a certain order. The map with the optimal $\gamma$ value surpasses existing ranking methods on this task. Additionally, our method excels in evaluating nestedness, another crucial structural property of ecological systems, requiring specific node rankings. Finally, we explore theoretical aspects of the map, revealing a phase transition at a critical $\gamma$ dependent on the data structure that can be characterized analytically for random networks. Near the critical point, the map exhibits unique features and a distinctive "triangular" packing pattern of the incidence matrix.

Title: Imaging moiré flat bands and Wigner molecular crystals in twisted bilayer MoTe2
Authors: Yufeng Liu, Yu Gu, Ting Bao, Ning Mao, Shudan Jiang, Liang Liu, Dandan Guan, Yaoyi Li, Hao Zheng, Canhua Liu, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Wenhui Duan, Jinfeng Jia, Xiaoxue Liu, Can Li, Yang Zhang, Tingxin Li, Shiyong Wang
Abstract: Two-dimensional semiconducting moiré materials have emerged as a highly tunable platform for exploring novel quantum phenomena. Recently, tMoTe2 has attracted significant attentions due to the observation of the long-sought fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect. However, a comprehensive microscopic understanding of the tMoTe2 moiré superlattice remains elusive. Here, we report STM/STS studies in dual-gated tMoTe2 moiré devices with twist angles ranging from 2.3 to 3.8 deg. The device consists of two independent back-gates, one enables an ohmic contact for tMoTe2, while the other fine-tunes the Fermi level of tMoTe2. This dual-gate control enables direct measurement of the electronic structure in tMoTe2 under varied displacement fields and moiré filling factors, by fine tuning the gate voltage and the tip bias. Our STS spectra and spatial imaging reveal that the low-energy moiré flat bands are predominantly localized in the XM and MX regions of the moiré superlattice. At zero E-field, these bands form a honeycomb lattice with non-trivial topology, whereas an applied E-field drives a transition into two distinct triangular lattices with trivial topology. The spatial distributions align with large-scale first-principle calculations, demonstrating that the topological flat bands arise from the K-valley hybridization between the top and bottom MoTe2 layers. Furthermore, we show that the effective moiré potential depth can be controlled via gate and tip biases. At sufficient potential depths, we observe the emergence of Wigner molecular crystals, transitioning MX triangular lattice into a Kagome lattice at MX moiré filling factor 3. These results elucidate the microscopic origin of topological flat bands in tMoTe2 and demonstrate electric-field control of topology and correlated electronic orders, paving the way to engineer exotic quantum phases in moiré simulators.

Title: Stability of Cantilever-like Structures with Applications to Soft Robot Arms
Authors: Siva Prasad Chakri Dhanakoti
Abstract: The application of variational principles for analyzing problems in the physical sciences is widespread. Cantilever-like problems, where one end is fixed and the other end is free, have received less attention in terms of their stability despite their prevalence. In this article, we establish stability conditions for these problems by examining the second variation of the energy functional through the generalized Jacobi condition. This requires computing conjugate points determined by solving a set of initial value problems from the linearized equilibrium equations. We apply these conditions to investigate the nonlinear stability of intrinsically curved elastic cantilevers subject to an end load. The rod deformations are modelled using Kirchhoff rod theory. The role of intrinsic curvature in inducing complex nonlinear phenomena, such as snap-back instability, is particularly emphasized. The numerical examples highlight its dependence on the system parameters. These examples illustrate potential applications in the design of flexible soft robot arms and innovative mechanisms.

Title: Predicting Grain Boundary Segregation in Magnesium Alloys: An Atomistically Informed Machine Learning Approach
Authors: Zhuocheng Xie, Achraf Atila, Julien Guénolé, Sandra Korte-Kerzel, Talal Al-Samman, Ulrich Kerzel
Abstract: Grain boundary (GB) segregation in magnesium (Mg) substantially influences its mechanical properties and performance. Atomic-scale modelling, typically using ab-initio or semi-empirical approaches, has mainly focused on GB segregation at highly symmetric GBs in Mg alloys, often failing to capture the diversity of local atomic environments and segregation energies, resulting in inaccurate structure-property predictions. This study employs atomistic simulations and machine learning models to systematically investigate the segregation behavior of common solute elements in polycrystalline Mg at both 0 K and finite temperatures. The machine learning models accurately predict segregation thermodynamics by incorporating energetic and structural descriptors. We found that segregation energy and vibrational free energy follow skew-normal distributions, with hydrostatic stress, an indicator of excess free volume, emerging as an important factor influencing segregation tendency. The local atomic environment's flexibility, quantified by flexibility volume, is also crucial in predicting GB segregation. Comparing the grain boundary solute concentrations calculated via the Langmuir-McLean isotherm with experimental data, we identified a pronounced segregation tendency for Nd, highlighting its potential for GB engineering in Mg alloys. This work demonstrates the powerful synergy of atomistic simulations and machine learning, paving the way for designing advanced lightweight Mg alloys with tailored properties.

Title: Wannier center spectroscopy to identify boundary-obstructed topological insulators
Authors: R.A.M. Ligthart, M.A.J. Herrera, A. Visser, A. Vlasblom, D. Bercioux, I. Swart
Abstract: The hallmark of topological crystalline insulators is the emergence of a robust electronic state in a bandgap localized at the boundary of the material. However, end, edge, and surface states can also have a nontopological origin. Unfortunately, topological invariants such as the winding number and Zak phase are often not directly experimentally accessible for solids. In addition to topological invariants, the position of the Wannier centers provides a fingerprint for the topological character of a material. Here, we demonstrate a method to experimentally determine the location of Wannier centers in artificial lattices made of Cs/InAs(111)A by integrating the density of states. We determine the locations of the Wannier centers for various 1D chains, topological and trivial, and corroborate our findings with tight-binding simulations.

Title: Persistent homology elucidates hierarchical structures responsible for mechanical properties in covalent amorphous solids
Authors: Emi Minamitani, Takenobu Nakamura, Ippei Obayashi, Hideyuki Mizuno
Abstract: Understanding how atomic-level structures govern the mechanical properties of amorphous materials remains a fundamental challenge in solid-state physics. Under mechanical loading, amorphous materials exhibit simple affine and spatially inhomogeneous nonaffine displacements that contribute to the elastic modulus through the Born (affine) and nonaffine terms, respectively. The differences between soft local structures characterized by small Born terms or large nonaffine displacements have yet to be elucidated. This challenge is particularly complex in covalent amorphous materials such as silicon, where the medium-range order (MRO) plays a crucial role in the network structure. To address these issues, we combined molecular dynamics simulations with persistent homology analysis. Our results reveal that local structures with small Born terms are governed by short-range characteristics, whereas those with large nonaffine displacements exhibit hierarchical structures in which short-range disorder is embedded within the MRO. These hierarchical structures are also strongly correlated with low-energy localized vibrational excitations. Our findings demonstrate that the mechanical responses and dynamic properties of covalent amorphous materials are intrinsically linked to the MRO, providing a new framework for understanding and tailoring their properties.

Title: Visualizing the internal structure of the charge-density-wave state in CeSbTe
Authors: Xinglu Que, Qingyu He, Lihui Zhou, Shiming Lei, Leslie Schoop, Dennis Huang, Hidenori Takagi
Abstract: The collective reorganization of electrons into a charge density wave has long served as a textbook example of an ordered phase in condensed matter physics. Two-dimensional square lattices with $p$ electrons are well-suited to the realization of charge density waves, due to the anisotropy of the $p$ orbitals and the resulting one dimensionality of the electronic structure. In spite of a long history of study of charge density waves in square-lattice systems, few reports have recognized the significance of a hidden orbital degree of freedom. The degeneracy of $p_x$ and $p_y$ electrons may give rise to orbital patterns in real space that endow the charge density wave with additional broken symmetries or unusual order parameters. Here, we use scanning tunneling microscopy to visualize the internal structure of the charge-density-wave state of CeSbTe, which contains Sb square lattices with 5$p$ electrons. We image atomic-sized, anisotropic lobes of charge density with periodically modulating anisotropy, which we interpret in terms of a superposition of $p_x$ and $p_y$ bond density waves. Our results support the fact that delocalized $p$ orbitals can reorganize into emergent electronic states of matter.

Title: Strongly hybridized phonons in one-dimensional van der Waals crystals
Authors: Shaoqi Sun, Qingyun Lin, Yihuan Li, Daichi Kozawa, Huizhen Wu, Shigeo Maruyama, Pilkyung Moon, Toshikaze Kariyado, Ryo Kitaura, Sihan Zhao
Abstract: The phenomena of pronounced electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions in one-dimensional (1D) systems are ubiquitous, which are well described by frameworks of Luttinger liquid, Peierls instability and concomitant charge density wave. However, the experimental observation of strongly hybridized phonons in 1D was not demonstrated. Herein we report the first observation of strongly hybridized phonons in 1D condensed matters by using double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWNTs), representative 1D van der Waals crystals, with combining the spectroscopic and microscopic tools as well as the ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We observe uncharted phonon modes in one commensurate and three incommensurate DWNT crystals, three of which concurrently exhibit strongly-reconstructed electronic band structures. Our DFT calculations for the experimentally observed commensurate DWNT (7,7) @ (12,12) reveal that this new phonon mode originates from a (nearly) degenerate coupling between two transverse acoustic modes (ZA modes) of constituent inner and outer nanotubes having approximately trigonal and pentagonal rotational symmetry along the nanotube circumferences. Such coupling strongly hybridizes the two phonon modes in different shells and leads to the formation of a unique lattice motion featuring evenly distributed vibrational amplitudes over inner and outer nanotubes, distinct from any known phonon modes in 1D systems. All four DWNTs that exhibit the pronounced new phonon modes show small chiral angle twists, closely matched diameter ratios of 3/5 and decreased frequencies of new phonon modes with increased diameters, all supporting the uncovered coupling mechanism. Our discovery of strongly hybridized phonons in DWNTs open new opportunities for engineering phonons and exploring novel phonon-related phenomena in 1D condensed matters.

Title: Cahn-Hilliard model with Schlögl Reactions: interplay of equilibrium and non-equilibrium phase transitions. II. Memory effects
Authors: P. O. Mchedlov-Petrosyan, L. N. Davydov
Abstract: The present work is a continuation of our previous paper [Condens. Matter Phys., 2020, 23, 33602: 1-17]. It is devoted to the modelling of the interplay of equilibrium and non-equilibrium phase transitions. The modelling of equilibrium phase transition is based on the modified Cahn-Hilliard equation. The non-equilibrium phase transition is modeled by the Second Schlögl reaction system. We consider the advancing front, which combines these both transitions. Different from the first article, we consider here the memory effects, i.e., the effects of non-Fickian diffusion. The traveling wave solution is obtained, and its dependence on the model parameters is studied in detail. The relative importance of memory effects for different process regimes is estimated.

Title: Auto-resolving the atomic structure at van der Waals interfaces using a generative model
Authors: Wenqiang Huang, Yuchen Jin, Zhemin Li, Lin Yao, Yun Chen, Zheng Luo, Shen Zhou, Jinguo Lin, Feng Liu, Zhifeng Gao, Jun Cheng, Linfeng Zhang, Fangping Ouyang, Jin Zhang, Shanshan Wang
Abstract: The high-resolution visualization of atomic structures is significant for understanding the relationship between the microscopic configurations and macroscopic properties of materials. However, a rapid, accurate, and robust approach to automatically resolve complex patterns in atomic-resolution microscopy remains difficult to implement. Here, we present a Trident strategy-enhanced disentangled representation learning method (a generative model), which utilizes a few unlabelled experimental images with abundant low-cost simulated images to generate a large corpus of annotated simulation data that closely resembles experimental results, producing a high-quality large-volume training dataset. A structural inference model is then trained via a residual neural network which can directly deduce the interlayer slip and rotation of diversified and complicated stacking patterns at van der Waals interfaces with picometer-scale accuracy across various materials (e.g. MoS2, WS2, ReS2, ReSe2, and 1T'-MoTe2) with different layer numbers , demonstrating robustness to defects, imaging quality, and surface contaminations. The framework can also identify pattern transition interfaces, quantify subtle motif variations, and discriminate moire patterns that are difficult to distinguish in frequency domains. Finally, the high-throughput processing ability of our method provides insights into a van der Waals epitaxy mode where various thermodynamically favorable slip stackings can coexist.

Title: Thermodynamic and energetic constraints on transition probabilities of small-scale quantum systems
Authors: Ludovico Tesser, Matteo Acciai, Christian Spånslätt, Inès Safi, Janine Splettstoesser
Abstract: We study the transition probabilities of a two-point measurement on a quantum system, initially prepared in a thermal state. We find two independent constraints on the difference between transition probabilities when the system is prepared at different temperatures, which both turn out to be particularly restrictive when the measured quantum system is small. These bounds take the form of a thermodynamic and of an energetic constraint, as they are associated with the dissipated heat and with the absorbed energy required to increase or to reduce the temperature of the system. The derived constraints apply to arbitrary system Hamiltonians, including interactions or non-linear energy spectra. We show the relevance of these constraints for the special case where transitions are induced by energy or particle exchange in weakly coupled bipartite systems out of equilibrium. This example is of interest for a wide range of experimentally relevant systems, from molecular junctions to coupled cavities, and can be tested by, for instance, measuring the out-of-equilibrium tunneling current and its noise.

Title: Efficiently preparing chiral states via fermionic cooling on bosonic quantum hardware
Authors: Gilad Kishony, Mark S. Rudner, Erez Berg
Abstract: Simulating many-body systems is one of the most promising applications of near-term quantum computers. An important open question is how to efficiently prepare the ground states of arbitrary fermionic Hamiltonians, especially those with nontrivial topology. Here, we propose an efficient protocol for preparing low-energy states of fermionic Hamiltonians on a noisy bosonic quantum simulator by adiabatic cooling using a simulated bath. We arrange the couplings such that the simulated system and bath together obtain a local fermionic description in which fermionic excitations can be extracted individually, via coherent hopping to the bath, rather than in pairs as would otherwise be required by fermion parity conservation. This approach thus achieves a linear (rather than quadratic) scaling of the cooling rate vs. excitation density at low densities. We show that certain topological phases such as the chiral (non-Abelian) phase of the Kitaev honeycomb model can be prepared efficiently using our protocol. Our protocol performs favorably in the presence of noise, making it suitable for execution on near-term quantum devices.

Title: A Systematic Investigation of PbSe Thermoelectric Material
Authors: Md. Moklesur Rahman, Md Kamal Hossain, Fateha Samad, Fysol Ibna Abbas
Abstract: The thermoelectric characteristics of lead selenium (PbSe) doped with gallium (Ga) are investigated in this study. When the lead sulfide (PbSe) is tuned with appropriate dopants, it exhibits satisfactory ZT values, hence making it a promising thermoelectric material. This study examines the electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, thermal conductivity, and power factor of PbSe, with varying amounts of added Ga. Results indicate that incorporating Ga into PbSe improves its thermoelectric performance, with a maximum ZT value of approximately 1.2 at 873 K for the optimal doping concentration of 0.005 atomic percent. This improvement is attributed to the combined effects of increased electrical conductivity and reduced thermal conductivity. These findings suggest that Ga-doped PbSe is a promising candidate for mid-temperature thermoelectric applications.

Title: Role of magnetic doping in topological HgTe and application of the Gram-Schmidt method for computing impurity states in quantum wells
Authors: Dawid Bugajewski, Tomasz Dietl
Abstract: The quantum spin Hall effect in non-magnetic and Mn-doped HgTe quantum well is strongly affected by Kondo scattering of edge electrons by holes localized on acceptors. A generalized eigenvalue method is usually employed for determining impurity binding energies from the multiband Kohn-Luttinger Hamiltonians in bulk samples and semiconductor quantum structures. Such an approach provides accurate values of the level positions but its applicability for determining the impurity localization radius can be questioned. As an alternative method we propose here the Gram-Schmidt ortogonalization procedure allowing to employ the standard eigenvalue algorithms and, thus, to determine both impurity level energies and the set of normalized eigenvectors. We apply this approach to singly-ionized acceptor states in HgTe quantum wells and obtain impurity level energies and localization radiuses even for states degenerate with the continuum of band states. Such information allows us to assess the energy of bound magnetic polarons in quantum wells doped with magnetic ions. We determine the polaron energies and discuss consequences of the resonant polaron formation on band transport in the bulk samples and quantum wells in the regimes of quantum Hall effects.

Title: Verification and Validation of zero-point electron-phonon renormalization of the bandgap, mass enhancement, and spectral functions
Authors: Samuel Poncé, Jae-Mo Lihm, Cheol-Hwan Park
Abstract: Verification and validation of methods and first-principles software are at the core of computational solid-state physics but are too rarely addressed. We compare four first-principles codes: Abinit, Quantum ESPRESSO, EPW, ZG, and three methods: (i) the Allen-Heine-Cardona theory using density functional perturbation theory (DFPT), (ii) the Allen-Heine-Cardona theory using Wannier function perturbation theory (WFPT), and (iii) an adiabatic non-perturbative frozen-phonon method. For these cases, we compute the real and imaginary parts of the electron-phonon self-energy in diamond and BAs, including dipoles and quadrupoles when interpolating. We find excellent agreement between software that implements the same formalism as well as good agreement between the DFPT and WFPT methods. Importantly, we find that the Deybe-Waller term is momentum dependent which impacts the mass enhancement, yielding approximate results when using the Luttinger approximations. Finally, we compare the electron-phonon spectral functions between Abinit and EPW and find excellent agreement even away from the band edges.

Title: Topological excitations at time vortices in periodically driven systems
Authors: Gilad Kishony, Ori Grossman, Netanel Lindner, Mark Rudner, Erez Berg
Abstract: We consider two-dimensional periodically driven systems of fermions with particle-hole symmetry. Such systems support non-trivial topological phases, including ones that cannot be realized in equilibrium. We show that a space-time defect in the driving Hamiltonian, dubbed a ``time vortex,'' can bind $\pi$ Majorana modes. A time vortex is a point in space around which the phase lag of the Hamiltonian changes by a multiple of $2\pi$. We demonstrate this behavior on a periodically driven version of Kitaev's honeycomb spin model, where $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fluxes and time vortices can realize any combination of $0$ and $\pi$ Majorana modes. We show that a time vortex can be created using Clifford gates, simplifying its realization in near-term quantum simulators.

Title: Magnetothermal transport in ultraclean single crystals of Kitaev magnet $α$-RuCl$_3$
Authors: Y. Xing, R. Namba, K. Imamura, K. Ishihara, S. Suetsugu, T. Asaba, K. Hashimoto, T. Shibauchi, Y. Matsuda, Y. Kasahara
Abstract: The layered honeycomb magnet $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ has emerged as a promising candidate for realizing a Kitaev quantum spin liquid. Previous studies have reported oscillation-like anomalies in the longitudinal thermal conductivity and half-integer quantized thermal Hall conductivity above the antiferromagnetic critical field $H_c$, generating significant interest. However, the origins of these phenomena remain contentious due to strong sample dependence. Here we re-examine the magnetothermal transport properties using recently available ultra-pure $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ single crystals to further elucidate potential signatures of the spin liquid state. Our findings reveal that while anomalies in thermal conductivity above $H_c$ persist even in ultraclean crystals, their magnitude is significantly attenuated, contrary to the quantum oscillations hypothesis. This suggests that the anomalies are likely attributable to localized stacking faults inadvertently introduced during magnetothermal transport measurements. The thermal Hall conductivity exhibits a half-quantized plateau, albeit with a narrower width than previously reported. This width reduction can be understood through two distinct mechanisms: sample-dependent magnetic critical fields that influence the lower boundary of the plateau region, and the decoupling between chiral Majorana edge currents and phononic thermal transport that determines the upper boundary. These results indicate that structural imperfections exert a substantial influence on both the oscillation-like anomalies and quantization effects observed in magnetothermal transport measurements of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$.

Title: Large Scale Raman Spectrum Calculations in Defective 2D Materials using Deep Learning
Authors: Olivier Malenfant-Thuot, Dounia Shaaban Kabakibo, Simon Blackburn, Bruno Rousseau, Michel Côté
Abstract: We introduce a machine learning prediction workflow to study the impact of defects on the Raman response of 2D materials. By combining the use of machine-learned interatomic potentials, the Raman-active $\Gamma$-weighted density of states method and splitting configurations in independant patches, we are able to reach simulation sizes in the tens of thousands of atoms, with diagonalization now being the main bottleneck of the simulation. We apply the method to two systems, isotopic graphene and defective hexagonal boron nitride, and compare our predicted Raman response to experimental results, with good agreement. Our method opens up many possibilities for future studies of Raman response in solid-state physics.

Title: Dynamic switching of ferrocene and plasmonic interactions in Au/self-assembled monolayer/single Ag nanocube molecular junctions
Authors: Mariem Ben Youssef, Peeranuch Poungsripong, Hugo Bidotti, Halidou Abdoul-Yasset, Didier Gigmes, Olivier Margeat, Beniamino Siacca, Judikael Le Rouzo, David Duche, Dominique Vuillaume
Abstract: We report the redox switching of ferrocene moieties embedded in a double tunnel barrier plasmonic cavity fabricated from a click-chemistry self-assembled monolayers of ferrocenyl-alkylthiol on ultra flat gold surfaces, connected to a single poly(vinylpyrrolidone) capped silver nanocube, AgNC, which is contacted by the tip of a conductive-AFM to study the electron transport properties in the dark and under light irradiation at the plasmonic resonance wavelengths. We observe a dual behavior in the current-voltage (I-V) characteristics in the dark: a large hysteresis loop at positive voltages and an hysteretic negative differential conductance (NDC) at negative voltages, due to the redox switching of ferrocene between its oxidized (Fc+) and neutral (Fc0) states. The I-V curves are analyzed by a generalized combined Marcus-Landauer model. We determine the highest occupied molecular orbital of the Fc+ and Fc0 states at 0.54 and 0.42 eV below the Fermi energy, respectively, with a weak reorganization energy < 0.1 eV upon switching. Under plasmonic excitation, the hysteresis and NDC behaviors are no longer observed and the I-V characteristics of the Au-ferrocenyl-alkylthiol/AgNC junctions become similar to Au-ferrocenyl-alkylthiol SAMs. A virtual molecular orbital due to the plasmon-induced coupling (fast electron transfer) between the two redox states of the Fc is determined at 0.46 eV. This dynamic behavior opens perspectives in artificial synaptic devices for neuromorphic computing with the additional function to turn on/off this synaptic behavior on-demand by light.

Title: Explicit demonstration of the equivalence between DFT+U and the Hartree-Fock limit of DFT+DMFT
Authors: Alberto Carta, Iurii Timrov, Peter Mlkvik, Alexander Hampel, Claude Ederer
Abstract: Several methods have been developed to improve the predictions of density functional theory (DFT) in the case of strongly correlated electron systems. Out of these approaches, DFT+$U$, which corresponds to a static treatment of the local interaction, and DFT combined with dynamical mean field theory (DFT+DMFT), which considers local fluctuations, have both proven incredibly valuable in tackling the description of materials with strong local electron-electron interactions. While it is in principle known that the Hartree-Fock (HF) limit of the DFT+DMFT approach should recover DFT+$U$, demonstrating this equivalence in practice is challenging, due to the very different ways in which the two approaches are generally implemented. In this work, we introduce a way to perform DFT+$U$ calculations in Quantum ESPRESSO using Wannier functions as calculated by Wannier90, which allows us to use the same Hubbard projector functions both in DFT+$U$ and in DFT+DMFT. We benchmark these DFT+$U$ calculations against DFT+DMFT calculations where the DMFT impurity problem is solved within the HF approximation. Considering a number of prototypical materials including NiO, MnO, LaMnO$_3$, and LuNiO$_3$, we establish the sameness of the two approaches. Finally, we showcase the versatility of our approach by going beyond the commonly used atomic orbital-like projectors by performing DFT+$U$ calculations for VO$_2$ using a special set of bond-centered Wannier functions.

Title: Ferroelectric HfO$_2$-ZrO$_2$ multilayers with reduced wake-up
Authors: Barnik Mandal, Adrian-Marie Philippe, Nathalie Valle, Emmanuel Defay, Torsten Granzow, Sebastjan Glinsek
Abstract: Since the discovery of ferroelectricity in HfO$_2$ thin films, significant research has focused on Zr-doped HfO$_2$ and solid solution (Hf,Zr)O$_2$ thin films. Functional properties can be further tuned via multilayering, however, this approach has not yet been fully explored in HfO$_2$-ZrO$_2$ films. This work demonstrates ferroelectricity in a 50 nm thick, solution-processed HfO$_2$-ZrO$_2$ multilayer film, marking it as the thickest multilayer film to date exhibiting ferroelectric properties. The multilayer structure was confirmed through transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, with high-resolution TEM revealing grain continuity across multiple layers. This finding indicates that a polar phase in the originally paraelectric ZrO$_2$ layer, can be stabilized by the HfO$_2$ layer. The film attains a remanent polarization of 9 uC/cm$^2$ and exhibits accelerated wake-up behavior, attributed to its higher breakdown strength resulting from the incorporation of multiple interfaces. These results offer a faster wake-up mechanism for thick ferroelectric hafnia films.

Title: First-Principles Insights into the Site Occupancy of Ta-Fe-Al C14 Laves Phases
Authors: Nisa Ulumuddin, Sandra Korte-Kerzel, Zhuocheng Xie
Abstract: This study investigates the site occupancy preferences of Al in Ta(Fe$_{1-x}$Al$_x$)$_2$ Laves phases using first-principles calculations, covering Al concentrations from 0 to 50 at.\%. Al atoms exhibit a strong preference for $2a$ Wyckoff sites, with configurations becoming more energetically favorable as these sites reach full occupancy at high Al concentrations. Magnetic configurations were explored, revealing that anti-ferromagnetic ordering is the most favorable at ground states. A metastable defect phase diagram based on the chemical potential of Al was constructed to map site occupancy preferences, where Ta$_4$Fe$_6$Al$_2$ and Ta$_4$Fe$_2$Al$_6$ exhibit the widest chemical potential windows. The correlation between lattice distortions and site occupancy was examined, demonstrating that symmetric Al distributions enhance structural preference. These findings offer insights into the structural motifs of the Ta-Fe-Al system, providing a foundation for future investigations on structure-property relationships.

Title: First-Principles Study of High-Temperature Superconductivity in X2MH6 Compounds under 20 GPa
Authors: Jing Luo, Qun Wei, Xiaofei Jia, Meiguang Zhang, Xuanmin Zhu
Abstract: Research on high-temperature superconductors has primarily focused on hydrogen-rich compounds, however, the need for extreme pressures limits their practical applications. The X2MH6-type structure Mg2IrH6 stands out because it exhibits superconductivity at 160 K under ambient pressure. This study investigates methods to increase the superconducting transition temperature of this structure via atomic substitution and low-pressure treatment and assess the mechanical, thermodynamic, and dynamic stability of structures obtained by substituting Mg and Ir atoms in Mg2IrH6 with elements from the same groups using first-principles calculations. The findings identify 11 stable ternary compounds, 10 of which exhibit superconducting transition temperatures, with three compounds, Mg2CoH6, Mg2RhH6, and Mg2IrH6, exceeding 100 K, classifying them as high-temperature superconductors. Their superconducting figure of merit S values are 2.71, 3.35, and 3.83, respectively, suggesting strong practical application potential. The analysis results indicate that mid-frequency hydrogen phonons significantly enhance superconducting properties via electron-phonon coupling. The band structure study highlights the importance of van Hove singularities near the Fermi level. In addition, electron localization function and Fermi surface topology analyses reveal that the Fermi surface shape and density of states are crucial for increasing superconducting transition temperatures.

Title: Second-order correlation and squeezing of photons in cavities with ultrastrong magnon-photon interactions
Authors: Vemund Falch, Arne Brataas, Alireza Qaiumzadeh
Abstract: We investigate the second-order photon correlation function in cavity-magnon systems, focusing on ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic cavities within the ultrastrong coupling regime, and extending beyond the rotating-wave approximation. By deriving exact integral solutions for the second-order correlation function, we demonstrate that counter-rotating magnon-photon interactions induce quadrature squeezing in the cavity mode. Furthermore, we show that tuning the anisotropic magnon-cavity couplings enhances the squeezing effect by changing the level repulsion of the magnon-cavity photon hybrid mode without increasing the cavity photon occupation number. Our study reveals distinct quantum correlation behaviors in ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic cavities: For ferromagnetic cavities, we show that squeezing increases with coupling strength asymmetry, whereas in the antiferromagnetic case, magnon modes with opposite chirality suppress quantum effects and impose a lower bound on correlation functions. These findings provide a pathway to optimize photon blockade for quantum information technology in magnon-cavity systems in the ultrastrong coupling limit.

Title: Strong coupling impurity solver based on quantics tensor cross interpolation
Authors: Aaram J. Kim, Philipp Werner
Abstract: Numerical methods capable of handling nonequilibrium impurity models are essential for the study of transport problems and the solution of the nonequilibrium dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) equations. In the strong correlation regime, the self-consistently resummed hybridization expansion is an appealing strategy, which however has been employed so far mainly in the lowest-order noncrossing approximation. At higher orders, standard implementations become numerically costly, but a significant speed-up can be achieved by evaluating multidimensional integrals in an approximate factorized form. Here we develop a one-crossing approximation solver based on the recently introduced quantics tensor cross interpolation, and demonstrate its accuracy and efficiency with applications to the Anderson impurity model and nonequilibrium steady-state DMFT calculations for the Hubbard model.

Title: Corrugation-dominated mechanical softening of defect-engineered graphene
Authors: Wael Joudi, Rika Saskia Windisch, Alberto Trentino, Diana Propst, Jacob Madsen, Toma Susi, Clemens Mangler, Kimmo Mustonen, Florian Libisch, Jani Kotakoski
Abstract: We measure the two-dimensional elastic modulus $E^\text{2D}$ of atomically clean defect-engineered graphene with a known defect distribution and density in correlated ultra-high vacuum experiments. The vacancies are introduced via low-energy (< 200 eV) Ar ion irradiation and the atomic structure is obtained via semi-autonomous scanning transmission electron microscopy and image analysis. Based on atomic force microscopy nanoindentation measurements, a decrease of $E^\text{2D}$ from 286 to 158 N/m is observed when measuring the same graphene membrane before and after an ion irradiation-induced vacancy density of $1.0\times 10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$. This decrease is significantly greater than what is predicted by most theoretical studies and in stark contrast to some measurements presented in the literature. With the assistance of atomistic simulations, we show that this softening is mostly due to corrugations caused by local strain at vacancies with two or more missing atoms, while the influence of single vacancies is negligible. We further demonstrate that the opposite effect can be measured when surface contamination is not removed before defect engineering

Title: Precritical anomalous scaling and magnetization temperature dependence in cubic ferromagnetic crystals
Authors: Igor Kolokolov, Victor S. L'vov, Anna Pomyalov
Abstract: Recent developments in spintronics have drawn renewed attention to the spin dynamics of cubic ferromagnetic crystals EuO and EuS. These ferromagnets have the simplest possible magnetic structure, making them the most suitable systems for testing various theoretical models of magnetic materials. A commonly used Weiss mean-field approximation (MFA) provides only a qualitative description of the magnetization temperature dependence $M(T)$. We develop a consistent theory for $M(T)$ based on the perturbation diagrammatic technique for spin operators. Our theory is in excellent quantitative agreement with the experimental dependence of $M(T)$ for EuO and EuS throughout the entire temperature range from $T=0$ to Curie temperature $T_{C}$. In particular, our theoretical dependence $M(T)$ demonstrates a scaling behavior $M(T)\propto (T_{C}-T)^{\beta_*}$ with the scaling index $\beta_*\approx 1/3$ in a wide range of temperatures in agreement with the experimentally observed apparent scaling in EuO and EuS. The scaling behavior with $\beta_*\approx 1/3$ is manifested in the temperature range $T\lesssim T_{C}$ where corrections to the magnetization due to its fluctuations $\delta M (T)\lesssim M(T)$. To distinguish it from the narrow ``critical" range $T\approx T_{C}$ with $\delta M (T) > M(T)$, we term this $T$-range ``precritical". The precritical corrections $\delta M (T)$ are still large enough to affect the $M(T)$ behavior. The index $\beta_*$ fundamentally differs from the ``normal" scaling index $\beta_{MFA}=1/2$ predicted by the MFA, which neglects the magnetization fluctuations. We refer to the emerging in our theory apparent magnetization scaling with $\beta_*\approx 1/3$ as ``precritical anomalous".

Title: Coarsening dynamics of Ising-nematic order in a frustrated Heisenberg antiferromagnet
Authors: Yang Yang, Yi-Hsuan Liu, Rafael M. Fernandes, Gia-Wei Chern
Abstract: We study the phase ordering dynamics of the classical antiferromagnetic $J_1$-$J_2$ (nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor couplings) Heisenberg model on the square lattice in the strong frustration regime ($J_2/J_1 > 1/2$). While thermal fluctuations preclude any long-range magnetic order at finite temperatures, the system exhibits a long-range spin-driven nematic phase at low temperatures. The transition into the nematic phase is further shown to belong to the two-dimensional Ising universality class based on the critical exponents near the phase transition. Our large-scale stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert simulations find a two-stage phase ordering when the system is quenched from a high-temperature paramagnetic state into the nematic phase. In the early stage, collinear alignments of spins lead to a locally saturated Ising-nematic order. Once domains of well-defined Ising order are developed, the late-stage relaxation is dominated by curvature-driven domain coarsening, as described by the Allen-Cahn equation. The characteristic size of Ising-nematic domains scales as the square root of time, similar to the kinetic Ising model described by the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory. Our results confirm that the late-stage ordering kinetics of the spin-driven nematic, which is a vestigial order of the frustrated Heisenberg model, belongs to the dynamical universality class of a non-conserved Ising order. Interestingly, the system shows no violation of the superuniversality hypothesis under weak bond disorder. The dynamic scaling invariance is preserved in the presence of weak bond disorder. We also discuss possible applications of our results to materials for which vestigial Ising-nematic order is realized.

Title: Non-invertible SPTs: an on-site realization of (1+1)d anomaly-free fusion category symmetry
Authors: Chenqi Meng, Xinping Yang, Tian Lan, Zhengcheng Gu
Abstract: We investigate (1+1)d symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases with fusion category symmetries. We emphasize that the UV description of an anomaly-free fusion category symmetry must include the fiber functor, giving rise to a local symmetry action, a charge category and a trivial phase. We construct an ``onsite'' matrix-product-operator (MPO) version of the Hopf algebra symmetry operators in a lattice model with tensor-product Hilbert space. In particular, we propose a systematic framework for classifying and constructing SPTs with non-invertible symmetries. An SPT phase corresponds to a Q-system in the charge category, such that the Q-system becomes a matrix algebra when the symmetry is forgotten. As an example, we provide an explicit microscopic realization of all three $\mathsf{Rep}^\dagger(D_8)$ SPT phases, including a trivial phase, and further demonstrate the $S_3$-duality among these three SPT phases.

Title: Strain-Induced Activation of Symmetry-Forbidden Exciton-Phonon Couplings for Enhanced Phonon-Assisted Photoluminescence in MoS$_2$ Monolayers
Authors: Rishabh Saraswat, Rekha Verma, Sitangshu Bhattacharya
Abstract: Phonon-assisted photoluminescence (PL) in molybdenum-based two-dimensional dichalcogenides is typically weak due to the dormant phonon coupling with optically inactive momentum-dark (intervalley) excitons, unlike in tungsten-based dichalcogenides where such processes are more prominent. Despite this inefficiency, we revisit excitons in MoS$_2$ using rigorous finite-momentum Bethe-Salpeter equation calculations to identify ways to enhance phonon-assisted recombination channels. Our ab-initio results, complemented by group-theoretic analyses, reveal that while unstrained MoS$_2$ exhibits no phonon-assisted PL emissions at cryogenic temperatures due to forbidden A$^{\prime\prime}$ phonon modes, biaxial strain opens a pathway to significantly intensify this emission by activating hole-phonon A$^{\prime}$-mediated scattering channels. By calculating allowed exciton-phonon matrix elements and scattering rates, we demonstrate how strain redistributes oscillator strengths toward radiative recombination. These findings provide a promising route to improving PL emission efficiency in various metal dichalcogenide monolayers through strain engineering and offer valuable insights for further exploration of exciton-phonon dynamics, including time-resolved spectroscopic studies.

Title: Bi-self-trapping of excitons via the long-living phonon mode and their superfluorescent markers
Authors: Vladimir Al. Osipov, Boris Fainberg
Abstract: A dynamic approach based on the multiconfiguration Haqrtree method to description of exciton self-trapping is proposed. Primarily motivated by the phenomenon of room-temperature superfluorescence recently observed in hybrid perovskites at high excitation concentrations we offer the two-step mechanism: formation of two self-trapped excitons entangled via the same long-living phonon mode, and their rearrangement into a superradiating mirror symmetric configuration. In particular, based on the semiclassical equations of motion we examine the criteria for the high-temperature self-trapping and bi-self trapping of excitons. Our findings indicate that the self-trapped excitons are described by the stable phase-locked steady-state solution of the equations of motion, and at elevated exciton concentrations, they compete with the bi-self-trapped excitons. The bi-self-trapped exciton in the mirror-symmetric configuration can be described by the Dicke Hamiltonian and is responsible for superfluorescence. The obtained theoretical spectra are in good agreement with the experimental observation.

Title: Correlated helimagnetic configuration in a nonsymmorphic magnetic nodal semimetal
Authors: Xi Luo, Yu-Ge Chen, Ye-Min Zhan, Yue Yu
Abstract: Nonsymmorphic magnetic Weyl semimetal materials such as ReAlX (Re=rare earth, X=Si/Ge) provide a unique opportunity to explore the correlated phenomena between Weyl fermions and nontrivial magnetic configurations. To be specific, we study a lattice model in which the magnetic configuration is determined by the competition among ferromagnetic (FM) interaction, the Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction, and the Kondo coupling $K_0$ to the Weyl fermion. Both quantum and finite-temperature phase transitions between FM and correlated nesting helical configurations are found. Different from the uncorrelated helimagnet that decouples from the Weyl fermions, this correlated helimagnet induces a magnetic Brillouin zone with a $K_0$-dependent nesting in the band structure of the conduction electrons instead of the monopole-like Weyl cone. By measuring the current induced by the chiral magnetic effect on the conduction electron with nesting Weyl nodes, one can distinguish the correlated nesting helical order from the ferromagnetism because the chiral magnetic effect is considerably suppressed in the former case. These properties we find here may explain the experimental observations in ReAlX.

Title: Dynamics of Baxter-Wu model
Authors: Chen Tang, Konstantinos Sfairopoulos, Wanzhou Zhang, Chengxiang Ding
Abstract: Using Monte Carlo simulations, we investigate the dynamical properties of the Baxter-Wu (BW) model under linear quenches. For the linear cooling process, the scaling behavior of the excess defect density in the critical region aligns well with the predictions of the Kibble-Zurek (KZ) mechanism. However, the scaling behavior of the excess defect density after exiting the impulse regime does not follow from a simple interplay between the KZ mechanism and the coarsening dynamics; the system undergoes a decay close to a power-law form with an exponent that is significantly different from the coarsening exponent observed in instantaneous quenching. For the linear heating process, we show that, if the system starts from its ground state, the relevant exponents describing the KZ mechanism are identical to those in the cooling scenario. We find that the system does not directly enter the adiabatic regime after leaving the impulse regime but instead passes through a crossover regime with an exponential decay of the excess defect density. If the initial state is ordered but not the ground state of the system, the defect density exhibits a good scaling behavior, but the relevant exponents do not conform to the predictions of the KZ mechanism.

Title: Soft phonon and the central peak at the cubic-to-tetragonal phase transition in SrTiO$_3$
Authors: Avishek Maity, Klaus Habicht, Michael Merz, Ayman H. Said, Christo Guguschev, Danny Kojda, Britta Ryll, Jan-Ekkehard Hoffmann, Andrea Dittmar, Thomas Keller, Frank Weber
Abstract: The continuous displacive phase transition in SrTiO$_3$ near $T_c \approx 105$ K features a central elastic peak in neutron scattering investigations at temperatures above $T_c$, i.e., before the corresponding soft phonon mode is overdamped upon cooling. The origin of this central peak is still not understood. Here, we report an inelastic x-ray scattering investigation of the cubic-to-tetragonal phase transition in SrTiO$_3$. We compare quantitatively measurements of the soft phonon mode on two differently grown samples and discuss the findings regarding results from thermodynamic and transport probes such as specific heat and thermal conductivity. Furthermore, we use inelastic x-ray scattering to perform elastic scans with both high momentum- and milli-electronvolt energy-resolution and, thus, be able to separate elastic intensities of the central peak from low-energy quasielastic phonon scattering. Our results indicate that the evolution of the soft mode is similar in both samples though the intensities of the central peak differ by a factor of four. Measurements revealing anisotropic correlation lengths on cooling towards $T_c$, indicate that local properties of the crystals to which collective lattice excitations are insensitive are likely at the origin of the central elastic line in SrTiO$_3$.

Title: $Δ$-model correction of Foundation Model based on the models own understanding
Authors: Mads-Peter Verner Christiansen, Bjørk Hammer
Abstract: Foundation models of interatomic potentials, so called universal potentials, may require fine-tuning or residual corrections when applied to specific subclasses of materials. In the present work, we demonstrate how such augmentation can be accomplished via $\Delta$-learning based on the representation already embedded in the universal potentials. The $\Delta$-model introduced is a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model and various types of aggregation (global, species-separated, and atomic) of the representation vector are discussed. Employing a specific universal potential, CHGNet [Deng et al., Nat. Mach. Intell. 5, 1031 (2023)], in a global structure optimization setting, we find that it correctly describes the energetics of the "8" Cu oxide, which is an ultra-thin oxide film on Cu(111). The universal potential model even predicts a more favorable structure compared to that discussed in recent DFT-based literature. Moving to sulfur adatom overlayers on Cu(111), Ag(111), and Au(111) the CHGNet model, however, requires corrections. We demonstrate that these are efficiently provided via the GPR-based $\Delta$-model formulated on the CHGNet's own internal atomic embedding representation. The need for corrections is tracked to the scarcity of metal-sulfur atomic environments in the materials project database that CHGNet is trained on leading to an overreliance on sulfur-sulfur atomic environments. Other universal potentials trained on the same data, MACE-MP0, SevenNet-0, and ORB-v2-only-MPtrj show similar behavior, but with varying degrees of error, demonstrating the general need for augmentation schemes for universal potential models.

Title: Don't look back: Ordering and defect cloaking in non-reciprocal lattice XY models
Authors: Pankaj Popli, Ananyo Maitra, Sriram Ramaswamy
Abstract: We present a detailed analytical and numerical examination, on square and triangular lattices, of the non-reciprocal planar spin model introduced in Dadhichi et al., Phys. Rev. E 101, 052601 (2020). We show that the effect of lattice anisotropy should persist at large scales, leading to a ``mass'' for the angle field of the spins, and behaviour not in the ``Malthusian Toner-Tu'' universality class. Numerically, we find evidence of this mass at large values of our non-reciprocity parameter; for smaller values, we find power-law scaling of long-wavelength equal-time correlators in the polar-ordered phase of our lattice model over the system sizes and wavenumber range explored. Focussing on topological defects, we show numerically that defect interactions are highly anisotropic with respect to the mean ordering direction. In particular, the constituents of a $\pm 1$ pair are shielded from each other in a class of configurations, deferring their annihilation and allowing time for the nucleation of further defects. The result, we show numerically, is the destruction of the polarised phase via an aster apocalypse reminiscent of that found by Besse et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 268003 (2022), for the Malthusian Toner-Tu equation.

Title: Hydrodynamic nuclear analogs with active wave-particle clusters
Authors: Rahil N. Valani, David M. Paganin
Abstract: Active particles are non-equilibrium entities that uptake energy and convert it into self-propulsion. A dynamically rich class of active particles having features of wave-particle coupling and memory are walking/superwalking droplets. Such classical, active wave-particle entities (WPEs) have been shown to exhibit hydrodynamic analogs of many single-particle quantum systems. We numerically investigate the dynamics of several WPEs and find that they self-organize into a bound cluster, akin to a nucleus. This active cluster exhibits various modes of collective excitations as the memory of the system is increased. Dynamically distinct excitation modes create a common time-averaged collective potential indicating an analogy with the bag model of a nucleus. At high memory, the active cluster can destabilize and eject WPEs whose decay statistics follow exponential laws analogous to radioactive nuclear decay. Hydrodynamic nuclear analogs open up new directions to pursue, both experimentally and numerically, within the nascent field of hydrodynamic quantum analogs.

Title: Quantized crystalline-electromagnetic responses in insulators
Authors: Sachin Vaidya, André Grossi Fonseca, Mark R. Hirsbrunner, Taylor L. Hughes, Marin Soljačić
Abstract: We introduce new classes of gapped topological phases characterized by quantized crystalline-electromagnetic responses, termed "multipolar Chern insulators". These systems are characterized by nonsymmorphic momentum-space symmetries and mirror symmetries, leading to quantization of momentum-weighted Berry curvature multipole moments. We construct lattice models for such phases and confirm their quantized responses through numerical calculations. These systems exhibit bound charge and momentum densities at lattice and magnetic defects, and currents induced by electric or time-varying strain fields. Our work extends the classification of topological matter by uncovering novel symmetry-protected topological phases with quantized responses.

Title: Trilinear coupling and toroidicity in multiferroics
Authors: Andrea Urru, Alessio Filippetti, Jorge Íñiguez-Gonzàlez, Vincenzo Fiorentini
Abstract: Magnetoelectric responses are related in general to magnetic multipoles, and in particular the off-diagonal linear response is proportional to the toroidization order parameter. In multiferroics with three order parameters (polarization, magnetization, and toroidization), such response turns out to be also proportional to the trilinear coupling between the order parameters. Here we explore this scenario, discussing the effects of such trilinear coupling within a Landau theory framework, and using ab initio calculations to discuss a specific model system for this effect, namely the recently predicted three-order-parameter multiferroic metal Bi$_5$Mn$_5$O$_{17}$.

Title: Type-II quantum spin Hall insulator
Authors: Panjun Feng, Chao-Yang Tan, Miao Gao, Xun-Wang Yan, Zheng-Xin Liu, Peng-Jie Guo, Fengjie Ma, Zhong-Yi Lu
Abstract: Quantum spin Hall effect is usually realized in two-dimensional materials with time-reversal symmetry, but whether it can be realized without symmetry protection remains unexplored. Here, we propose type-II quantum spin Hall insulator with quantized spin Hall conductivity, whose edge states with opposite chirality and polarization, distributed in different Brillouin zone regions, connect the conduction and valence bands at the boundary. Thus, the type-II quantum spin Hall insulator does not require any symmetry protection other than translational symmetry. Then, based on symmetry analysis and the first-principles electronic structure calculations, we demonstrate that type-II quantum spin Hall insulator can be realized in both altermagnetic materials and Luttinger compensated magnetic materials. Furthermore, based on lattice model, we find that as long as $U(1)$ symmetry exists, type-II quantum spin Hall insulator phase can always exist stably. However, if $U(1)$ symmetry is broken, type-II quantum spin Hall insulator phase transforms into an obstructed atomic insulator phase as spin-orbit coupling effect is enhanced. Therefore, our work not only proposes a new mechanism for realizing the quantum spin Hall effect, but also enriches the types of unconventional magnetic topological phases.

Title: Resolving space-time structures of quantum impurities with a numerically-exact algorithm using few-body revealing
Authors: Yuriel Núñez-Fernández, Maxime Debertolis, Serge Florens
Abstract: We introduce a numerically exact real-time evolution scheme for quantum impurities in a macroscopically large bath. The algorithm is few-body revealing, namely it identifies the electronic orbitals that can be made inactive (in a trivial product state) by a time-dependent orbital rotation. Following a quench, we show that both the number of active orbitals and their associated matrix product state bond dimensions saturate to small values, leading to an algorithm dramatically more accurate and faster than the state of the art. We are thus able to follow the dynamics for thousands of fermions, up to the long-time stationary regime, and to study subtle aspects of quantum relaxation in the spatio-temporal domain, such as the emergence of entanglement structures in the Kondo screening cloud.

Title: The inconvenient truth about flocks
Authors: Leiming Chen, Patrick Jentsch, Chiu Fan Lee, Ananyo Maitra, Sriram Ramaswamy, John Toner
Abstract: We reanalyze the hydrodynamic theory of "flocks" that is, polar ordered "dry" active fluids in two dimensions. For "Malthusian" flocks, in which birth and death cause the density to relax quickly, thereby eliminating density as a hydrodynamic variable, we are able to obtain two exact scaling laws relating the three scaling exponents characterizing the long-distance properties of these systems. We also show that it is highly plausible that such flocks display long-range order in two dimensions. In addition, we demonstrate that for "immortal" flocks, in which the number of flockers is conserved, the extra non-linearities allowed by the presence of an extra slow variable (number density) make it impossible to obtain any exact scaling relations between the exponents. We thereby demonstrate that several past published claims of exact exponents for Malthusian and immortal flocks are all incorrect.

Title: The Energy Barrier of Precritical Nuclei in Hard Spheres is Consistent with Predictions
Authors: Lars Kürten, Antoine Castagnède, Frank Smallenburg, C. Patrick Royall
Abstract: Predicting crystal nucleation is among the most significant long--standing challenges in condensed matter. In the system most studied (hard sphere colloids), the comparison between experiments performed using static light scattering and computer simulations is woeful, with a discrepancy of over 10 orders of magnitude. The situation with other well-studied materials (such as water and sodium chloride) is no better. It has thus far proven impossible to access the regime of this discrepancy with particle-resolved techniques which might shed light on the origins of this discrepancy due to the relatively sluggish dynamics of the larger colloids required for confocal microscopy. Here we address this challenge with two developments. Our work is a marked improvement in the precision of mapping the state point of experiments to simulation. For this, we employed a combination of novel machine-learning methods for particle tracking and higher-order correlation functions. Our second innovation is to consider the free energy of \emph{pre--critical} nuclei which can be detected in the discrepancy regime. These are in agreement with computer simulation. This is the first time that such free energies have been directly compared between experiment and simulation in any material as far as we are aware. The agreement provides important validation of rare event sampling techniques which are used very widely in simulation, but which can seldom be directly compared with experiment.

Title: Fermi-Energy-Sensitive Universal Conductance Fluctuations in Anisotropic Materials
Authors: Qiang Yang, Yayun Hu, Zhe Hou, Peiqing Tong
Abstract: Universal conductance fluctuations (UCF) are a hallmark of quantum interference in mesoscopic devices. According to the Altshuler-Lee-Stone theory, the amplitude of UCF remains independent of system parameters such as Fermi energy and disorder strength. However, recent experiments have demonstrated a significant variation in UCF with respect to Fermi energy in the anisotropic Dirac semimetal $\mathrm{Cd_3As_2}$, suggesting a dependence on band anisotropy. In this work, we reconcile the discrepancy between theoretical predictions and experimental observations through a detailed study of UCF versus Fermi energy using a tight-binding model with tunable anisotropy parameters. Near the band edge, the Hamiltonian is simplified to an anisotropic free electron gas model, recovering the generalized Altshuler-Lee-Stone theory. However, as the Fermi energy shifts toward the band center, where rotational symmetry breaks into $C_4$ (four-fold rotational) symmetry, the UCF amplitude deviates from the standard theory. Our findings reveal that UCF becomes increasingly sensitive to Fermi energy as the anisotropy grows stronger. Furthermore, using realistic parameters for $\mathrm{Cd_3As_2}$, our calculations demonstrate an increase in UCF away from the Dirac point, in qualitative agreement with experimental results. The enhancement of UCF occurs in two perpendicular transport directions that we have calculated, albeit with quantitative differences in magnitude, which can be tested in future experiments. Given the prevalence of anisotropic materials and technical advances in engineering anisotropy through strain or twist, our results offer a valuable reference for characterizing intrinsic electronic properties via UCF.

Authors: M. V. Tokarchuk, B. M. Markovych, O. S. Zakharyash, O. L. Ivankiv, S. M. Mohnyak
Abstract: The main mechanisms and conditions of interaction of lava-like fuel-containing materials (LFCM) with the atmosphere, water and aqueous solutions are presented. The mechanisms of destruction of the LFCM surface, including ion-exchange processes, hydrolysis, dissolution, oxidation, etc., were analyzed. Inhomogeneous diffusion coefficients for UO$_{2}^{2+}$, Cs$^{+}$ ions at the interface "aqueous solution of radioactive elements - LFCM" were calculated. The interdiffusion processes and the rate of penetration into the porous medium of the reaction front of the internal hydrolysis of the silicon-oxygen network during interaction with an aqueous solution were analyzed, where the reaction and adsorption processes are hidden in the rate of internal hydrolysis.

Title: Theoretical study of thermoelectric properties of $\textrm{CeIr}_\textrm{4} \textrm{P}_\textrm{12}$ filled skutterudite for energy conversion
Authors: M. Bouchenaki, L. I. Karaouzène, B. N. Brahmi, M. Kaid Slimane
Abstract: The structural, elastic, thermodynamic and thermoelectric characteristics of the $\textrm{CeIr}_\textrm{4} \textrm{P}_\textrm{12}$ skutterudite have been predicted for the first time by applying density functional theory and the semi-classical Boltzmann simulations. Firstly, the structural-magnetic stability was verified through ground-state energy calculations obtained from structural optimizations. The predicted single-crystal elastic constants (${C}_{ij}$) show that the title compound is mechanically stable. At the same time, it turns out to be dynamically stable where all the calculated phonon frequencies have positive values. The cohesive energy was calculated to verify the energy stability of the material considered. We also determined the variations of some macroscopic physical parameters as functions of temperature, namely the thermal expansion coefficient, the lattice thermal conductivity. Furthermore, we investigated the temperature dependencies of some thermoelectric coefficients such as electronic thermal conductivity, and figure of merit. Such encouraging results indicate that the compound is a potential candidate for thermoelectric devices.

Title: Effective field theory for triple-Q magnetic orders on a hexagonal lattice
Authors: Jin-Tao Jin, Yi Zhou
Abstract: We develop a comprehensive Ginzburg-Landau theory describing triple-Q magnetic orders on hexagonal lattices, focusing on $O(N)$ models with $N=2$ and $N=3$. Through systematic analysis of symmetry-allowed terms in the free energy, we establish complete phase diagrams governed by competing interaction parameters. Our theory reveals distinct magnetic configurations including single-Q, double-Q, and triple-Q states, each characterized by unique symmetry breaking patterns and collective excitations. The framework provides fundamental insights into complex magnetic orders recently observed in materials such as Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$, where the interplay between geometric frustration and multiple ordering vectors leads to exotic magnetic states. Our results establish clear connections between microscopic interactions, broken symmetries, and experimentally observable properties, offering a powerful tool for understanding and predicting novel magnetic phases in frustrated magnets.

Title: Scaling properties of diblock copolymers: dynamic simulations study
Authors: K. Haydukivska
Abstract: The influence of monomer-monomer interactions on the scaling exponents and shape characteristics of a single polymer chain in a selective solvent is investigated using Langevin dynamics simulations. By systematically increasing the temperature of the solution, the effects of interactions between blocks on the conformational properties of the chain are explored. The results demonstrate that longer-range interactions cause a transition of a polymer similar to the transition for homopolymers; short-range repulsive interactions between different blocks have a negligible impact on the effective scaling exponents: they are the same regardless of the blocks being globule and coil or ideal and swollen coils.

Title: Advances of Mayer's cluster approach in quantitative theoretical description of phase transitions for various lattice models of matter
Authors: M. V. Ushcats, L. A. Bulavin, S. Yu. Ushcats, Zh. Yu. Burunina, O. V. Maiboroda, N. O. Romanchuk, N. O. Shapoval
Abstract: Resent achievements in statistical theory, namely, a possibility to reproduce almost unlimited Mayer's activity series based on the information about their convergence radius, on the one hand, and generalization of the lattice statistics by eliminating the simplification of nearest-neighbor interactions, on the other hand, have allowed accurate quantitative description of the condensation in lattice gases, spontaneous magnetization in ferromagnets, and spinodal decomposition in binary mixtures by evaluating only several irreducible cluster integrals (virial coefficients). In particular, the results of calculations indicate qualitative and even quantitative universality in the behavior of the mentioned lattice systems of different geometry and dimensionality at the same values of a certain reduced temperature when that behavior is expressed in terms of some dimensionless parameters. An additional possibility to describe the order-disorder phase transitions in some other lattice systems (e.g., antiferromagnets and alloys) is also discussed in the paper.

Title: On the temperature, pressure and composition effects in the properties of water-methanol mixtures. I. Density, excess mixing volume and enthalpy, and self-diffusion coefficients from molecular dynamics simulations
Authors: M. Cruz Sanchez, V. Trejos Montoya, O. Pizio
Abstract: We report the temperature, pressure and composition dependence of some basic properties of model liquid water-methanol mixtures. For this purpose the isobaric-isothermal molecular dynamics computer simulations are employed. Our principal focus is on the united atom non-polarizable UAM-I-EW model for methanol which was recently parametrized the paper by Garcia-Melgarejo et al. [J. Mol. Liq., 2021, 323, 114576], combined with the TIP4P/$\varepsilon$ water model. In perspective, the methanol model permits a convenient extension for other monohydric alcohols mixed with water. The behavior of density, excess mixing volume and enthalpy are described. Partial mixing properties are interpreted. Besides, we explored the trends of behavior of self-diffusion coefficients of the species of a mixture. The quality of predictions of the model is critically evaluated by detailed comparisons with experimental results. Various results are novel and provide new insights into the behavior of the mixtures in question at different temperatures and at high pressures. An improvement of the modelling necessary for further research is discussed.

Title: Entropy of a restricted primitive model electrolyte using a mean electrostatic potential approach
Authors: S. Lamperski, L. B. Bhuiyan, C. W. Outhwaite, R. Gorniak
Abstract: The excess entropy of restricted primitive model electrolytes is calculated using a potential based approach through the symmetric Poisson-Boltzmann and the modified Poisson-Boltzmann theories. The theories are utilized in conjunction with a statistical thermodynamics equation that is shown to be equivalent to thermodynamic integration. Electrolyte systems having ionic valencies 1:1 and 2:2 with diameters $3 \times 10^{-10}$~m and 4.25 $\times 10^{-10}$ m are treated over a wide range of concentrations. The exact radial distribution functions for the model electrolytes obtained from Monte Carlo simulations in the canonical ensemble are compared with the corresponding theoretical predictions. Furthermore, the radial distribution functions from the theories and the simulations are used in the Laird-Haymet entropy expansion equations [J. Chem. Phys., 1994, 100, 3775] to estimate the excess entropy of the solutions. These equations take into account multi-particle distribution functions, which are approximated using a ``ring'' term. In general, the modified Poisson-Boltzmann theory gives results that are more consistent with the simulation data than those from the symmetric Poisson-Boltzmann theory. The results show that the excess entropy is negative with its absolute value increasing for 1:1 electrolytes with increasing concentration. The symmetric Poisson-Boltzmann values are slightly overestimated, while the modified Poisson-Boltzmann values are slightly underestimated relative to the simulations. The curves for 1:1 electrolytes including that from the Laird-Haymet equations are consistent with each other, while only the MPB curves for 2:2 electrolytes at $4.25 \times 10^{-10}$ m are qualitative relative to the simulations up to about 1 mol/dm$^{3}$. The 2:2 electrolyte curves reveal a characteristic inflection and plateau....

Title: Topological effect on order-disorder transitions in U(1) sigma models
Authors: Ryuichi Shindou, Pengwei Zhao
Abstract: U(1) non-linear sigma model (NLSM) with a one-dimensional (1D) Berry phase is studied by a renormalization group theory. Order-disorder transition in U(1) NLSMs in $D \!\ (\ge 2)$-dimensional space ($d+1$-dimensional spacetime; $d\ge 1$) is instigated by the proliferation of vortex excitations, where the 1D Berry phase term confers finite phase factors upon those vortex excitations that have finite projection in a subspace complementary to a topological direction with the 1D Berry phase. A destructive interference effect caused by the phase factors may help to develop an intermediate quasi-disorder phase between ordered and disorder phases, which has a divergent order-parameter correlation length along the topological direction, and a finite correlation length along the other directions. In order to explore such a possibility in $D=3$, we develop a perturbative renormalization group theory of a 3D model of vortex loops, in which loop segments interact via a $1/r$ Coulomb interaction. We derive renormalization group (RG) equations among vortex-loop fugacity, Berry phase term, and the Coulomb potential. Approximate analyses of the RG equations show that near an order-disorder transition point, vortex loops are anomalously elongated along the topological direction. Utilizing a duality mapping to a lattice model of a type-II superconductor under a magnetic field, we also argue that a global phase diagram of the 3D U(1) sigma model with 1D Berry phase must have the quasi-disorder phase between ordered and disorder phases.

Title: Effect of variable relative permittivity on the thermodynamics of asymmetric valency aqueous salts
Authors: A. O. Quiñones, Z. Abbas, C. W. Outhwaite, L. B. Bhuiyan
Abstract: Experimentally determined empirical formulae for the concentration dependent relative permittivity of aqueous solutions of MgCl$_{2}$ and NiCl$_{2}$ are utilized to calculate the osmotic coefficient and the mean activity coefficient of these salts for a range of concentrations. The systems are modelled using the primitive model of electrolytes and analyzed using the symmetric Poisson-Boltzmann theory, the modified Poisson-Boltzmann theory, the mean spherical approximation, and the Monte Carlo simulations. Generally, the mean spherical approximation and the modified Poisson-Boltzmann theory reproduce the benchmark simulation data well up to $\sim $1.6 mol/dm$^{3}$ or more in many instances, while the symmetric Poisson-Boltzmann results show discrepancies starting from $\sim $0.25 mol/dm$^{3}$. Both the simulations and the theories tend to deviate from the corresponding experimental results beyond $\sim $1 mol/kg.

Title: Quasi-Brittle Fracture: The Blended Approach
Authors: Semsi Coskun, Davood Damircheli, Robert Lipton
Abstract: A field theory is presented for predicting damage and fracture in quasi-brittle materials. The approach taken here is new and blends a non-local constitutive law with a two-point phase field. In this formulation, the material displacement field is uniquely determined by the initial boundary value problem. The theory naturally satisfies energy balance, with positive energy dissipation rate in accord with the Clausius-Duhem inequality. Notably, these properties are not imposed but follow directly from the constitutive law and evolution equation when multiplying the equation of motion by the velocity and integrating by parts. In addition to elastic constants, the model requires at most three key material parameters: the strain at the onset of nonlinearity, the ultimate tensile strength, and the fracture toughness. The approach simplifies parameter identification while ensuring representation of material behavior. The approach seamlessly handles fracture evolution across loading regimes, from quasi-static to dynamic, accommodating both fast crack propagation and quasi-brittle failure under monotonic and cyclic loading. Numerical simulations show quantitative and qualitative agreement with experiments, including three-point bending tests on concrete. The model successfully captures the cyclic load-deflection response of crack mouth opening displacement, the structural size-effect related to ultimate load and specimen size, fracture originating from corner singularities in L- shaped domains, and bifurcating fast cracks.

Title: Structural and transport properties of LiTFSI/G3 electrolyte with machine-learned molecular dynamics
Authors: Chenyang Cao, Liyi Bai, Shuo Cao, Ye Su, Yanzhou Wang, Zheyong Fan, Ping Qian
Abstract: The lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)azanide-triglyme electrolyte plays a critical role in the performance of lithium-ion batteries. However, its solvation structure and transport properties at the atomic scale remain incompletely understood. In this study, we develop an efficient and accurate neuroevolution potential (NEP) model by integrating bootstrap and active learning strategies. Using machine-learned NEP-driven molecular dynamics simulations, we explore the structural and diffusion properties of LiTFSI/G3 across a wide range of the solute-to-solvent ratios, systematically analyzing electrolyte density, ion coordination, viscosity, and lithium self-diffusion. The computed densities show excellent agreement with experimental data, and pair correlation analysis reveals significant interactions between lithium ions and surrounding oxygen atoms, which strongly impacts Li$^+$ mobility. Viscosity and diffusion calculations further demonstrate that increasing LiTFSI concentration enhances Li-O interactions, resulting in higher viscosity and reduced lithium diffusion. Additionally, machine learning-based path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) simulations confirm the negligible impact of quantum effects on Li$^+$ transport. The electrolyte-specific protocol developed in this work provides a systematic framework for constructing high-fidelity machine learning potentials for complex systems.

Title: Dual Phonon Universe in a Spinor Bose Gas
Authors: Jiabin Wang, Yunfei Xue, Li Chen, Ren Zhang
Abstract: We show the possibility of simulating a dual universe in a pseudospin-1/2 Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), wherein two phononic modes experience distinct curved spacetime metrics. Through ramping the interspecies interaction of the BEC, we observe that one universe expands, and in the mean time, the other contracts. These findings can be directly verified in existing cold-atom experimental setups by detecting the correlators of the scaled density contrast (SDC): The sizes of the expanded/contracted universes can be deduced from the SDC's oscillating frequencies, while the expanding/contracting histories are reflected in the SDC's amplitude. Our study demonstrates the great potential of spinor BECs for exploring multiverse-related physics in laboratory settings.

Title: Mathematical crystal chemistry II: Random search for ionic crystals and analysis on oxide crystals registered in ICSD
Authors: Ryotaro Koshoji
Abstract: Mathematical crystal chemistry views crystal structures as the optimal solutions of mathematical optimization problem formalizing inorganic structural chemistry. This paper introduces the minimum and maximum atomic radii depending on the types of geometrical constraints, extending the concept of effective atomic sizes. These radii define permissible interatomic distances instead of interatomic forces, constraining feasible types and connections of coordination polyhedra. The definition shows the aspect that crystal structures are packings of atomic spheres. Additionally, creatability functions for geometrical constraints, which give a choice of creatable types of geometrical constraints depending on the spatial order of atoms, are implemented to guide randomly generated structures toward optimal solutions. The framework identifies unique optimal solutions corresponding to the structures of spinel, pyrochlore ($\alpha$ and $\beta$), pyroxene, quadruple perovskite, cuprate superconductor $\mathrm{YBa}_2 \mathrm{Cu}_3 \mathrm{O}_{7-x}$, and iron-based superconductor $\mathrm{LaFeAsO}$. Notably, up to $95\%$ of oxide crystal structure types in Inorganic Crystal Structure Database align with the optimal solutions preserving experimental structures despite the discretized feasible atomic radii. These findings highlight the role of mathematical optimization problem as a theoretical foundation for mathematical crystal chemistry, enabling efficient structure prediction.

Title: Symmetry Enhanced Unconventional Spin Current Anisotropy in a Collinear Antiferromagnet
Authors: Pankhuri Gupta, Kacho Imtiyaz Ali Khan, Akash Kumar, Rekha Agarwal, Nidhi Kandwal, Ram Singh Yadav, Johan Åkerman, Pranaba Kishor Muduli
Abstract: Spin-orbit torque (SOT) presents a promising avenue for energy-efficient spintronics devices, surpassing the limitations of spin transfer torque. While extensively studied in heavy metals, SOT in antiferromagnetic quantum materials remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate SOT in epitaxial FeSn, a collinear antiferromagnet with a kagome lattice. FeSn exhibits intriguing topological quantum features, including two-dimensional flat bands and Dirac-like surface states, making it an ideal platform for investigating emergent SOT properties. Using spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance, we uncover a six-fold symmetric damping-like SOT in epitaxial-FeSn/Py heterostructures, reflecting the six-fold symmetry of the epitaxial [0001]-oriented FeSn films. Additionally, we observe a substantial unconventional field-like torque, originating from spin currents with out-of-plane spin polarization. This torque exhibits a unique angular dependence-a superposition of six-fold crystalline symmetry and uniaxial symmetry associated with the antiferromagnetic spin Hall effect. Notably, the unconventional field-like torque is enhanced when the RF current flows along the Neel vector in FeSn. Our findings reveal an unconventional spin current anisotropy tunable by crystalline and magnetic symmetry, offering a novel approach for controlling SOT in antiferromagnetic spintronics.

Title: Renormalization group analysis reveals universality classes of stochastic spiking neuron networks
Authors: Braden A. W. Brinkman
Abstract: The critical brain hypothesis posits that neural circuits may operate close to ``critical points'' -- boundaries between different phases of collective activity. This has been argued to have functional benefits for neural computation. Studies investigating whether neural circuits are poised near critical points have largely relied on establishing power laws in neural data, while a fundamental understanding of critical phenomena requires a renormalization group (RG) analysis. However, neural activity is typically non-Gaussian, nonlinear, and non-local, rendering models that capture all of these features difficult to study using standard statistical physics techniques. We overcome these issues and adapt the non-perturbative renormalization group (NPRG) to provide the first RG analysis of networks of stochastic spiking neurons. We show that neural populations can belong to at least two important universality classes: 1) in networks with an absorbing state there is a transition between sustained and extinguished activity that belongs to the directed percolation universality class, and 2) in spontaneously active networks there is a continuous transition between high and low firing rate states that belongs to the Ising model universality class. We verify our theoretical results by simulating the network model on lattices in $2$ and $3$ dimensions, recovering known exponents, and then investigate critical phenomena in networks of sparsely-connected excitatory neurons and densely-connected inhibitory neurons. Depending on the amount of inhibitory feedback, these networks may display mean-field exponents or anomalous exponents close to -- but potentially not equal to -- lattices of the same effective dimension.

Title: Micro-swimmer collective dynamics in Brinkman flows
Authors: Yasser Almoteri, Enkeleida Lushi
Abstract: Suspensions of swimming micro-organisms are known to undergo intricate collective dynamics as a result of hydrodynamic and collision interactions. Micro-swimmers, such as bacteria and micro-algae, naturally live and have evolved in complex habitats that include impurities, obstacles and interfaces. To elucidate their dynamics in a heterogeneous environment, we consider a continuum theory where the the micro-swimmers are embedded in a Brinkman wet porous medium, which models viscous flow with an additional resistance or friction due to the presence of smaller stationary obstacles. The conservation equation for the swimmer configurations includes advection and rotation by the immersing fluid, and is coupled to the viscous Brinkman fluid flow with an active stress due to the swimmers' motion in it. Resistance alters individual swimmer locomotion and the way it disturbs the surrounding fluid, and thus it alters its hydrodynamic interactions with others and and such affects collective this http URL entropy analysis and the linear stability analysis of the system of equations both reveal that resistance delays and hinders the onset and development of the collective swimming instabilities, and can completely suppress it if sufficiently large. Simulations of the full nonlinear system confirm these. We contrast the results with previous theoretical studies on micro-swimmers in homogeneous viscous flow, and discuss relevant experimental realizations.

Title: Nonlinear classification of neural manifolds with contextual information
Authors: Francesca Mignacco, Chi-Ning Chou, SueYeon Chung
Abstract: Understanding how neural systems efficiently process information through distributed representations is a fundamental challenge at the interface of neuroscience and machine learning. Recent approaches analyze the statistical and geometrical attributes of neural representations as population-level mechanistic descriptors of task implementation. In particular, manifold capacity has emerged as a promising framework linking population geometry to the separability of neural manifolds. However, this metric has been limited to linear readouts. To address this limitation, we introduce a theoretical framework that leverages latent directions in input space, which can be related to contextual information. We derive an exact formula for the context-dependent manifold capacity that depends on manifold geometry and context correlations, and validate it on synthetic and real data. Our framework's increased expressivity captures representation reformatting in deep networks at early stages of the layer hierarchy, previously inaccessible to analysis. As context-dependent nonlinearity is ubiquitous in neural systems, our data-driven and theoretically grounded approach promises to elucidate context-dependent computation across scales, datasets, and models.

Title: Delayed phosphate release can highly improve energy efficiency of muscle contraction
Authors: Jiaxiang Xu, Jiangke Tao, Bin Chen
Abstract: While the power stroke of myosin and the release of inorganic phosphate (Pi) play crucial roles in transforming ATP's chemical energy into mechanical work across diverse biological systems, the exact temporal relationship between these events continues to be intensely debated, primarily due to their occurrence at extremely small spatiotemporal scales. In this study, we employ a functional approach to computationally investigate the impact of relatively slow Pi-release kinetics during the power stroke on muscle contraction dynamics. By implementing a mechanics model of the sarcomere unit that comprehensively incorporates the chemomechanical cycle of individual myosin molecules, we demonstrate that delayed Pi-release significantly enhances energy efficiency during muscle contraction. Our simulation results, obtained through parameter variation, successfully replicate a broad range of experimental observations. This work suggests that a gradual Pi-release that is not directly coupled with the lever arm swing may offer a route to adjust the stability of a working myosin on the actin filament, thereby modulating the power stroke to influence muscle performance.

Title: Machine Learning Analysis of Anomalous Diffusion
Authors: Wenjie Cai, Yi Hu, Xiang Qu, Hui Zhao, Gongyi Wang, Jing Li, Zihan Huang
Abstract: The rapid advancements in machine learning have made its application to anomalous diffusion analysis both essential and inevitable. This review systematically introduces the integration of machine learning techniques for enhanced analysis of anomalous diffusion, focusing on two pivotal aspects: single trajectory characterization via machine learning and representation learning of anomalous diffusion. We extensively compare various machine learning methods, including both classical machine learning and deep learning, used for the inference of diffusion parameters and trajectory segmentation. Additionally, platforms such as the Anomalous Diffusion Challenge that serve as benchmarks for evaluating these methods are highlighted. On the other hand, we outline three primary strategies for representing anomalous diffusion: the combination of predefined features, the feature vector from the penultimate layer of neural network, and the latent representation from the autoencoder, analyzing their applicability across various scenarios. This investigation paves the way for future research, offering valuable perspectives that can further enrich the study of anomalous diffusion and advance the application of artificial intelligence in statistical physics and biophysics.

Title: Breakdown of broken-symmetry approach to exchange interaction
Authors: Naoya Iwahara, Zhishuo Huang, Akseli Mansikkamäki, Liviu F. Chibotaru
Abstract: Broken-symmetry (BS) approaches are widely employed to evaluate Heisenberg exchange parameters, primarily in combination with DFT calculations. For many magnetic materials, BS-DFT calculations give reasonable estimations of exchange parameters, although systematic failures have also been reported. While the latter were attributed to deficiencies of approximate exchange-correlation functional, we prove here by treating a simple model system that the broken-symmetry methodology has serious problems. Detailed analysis clarifies the intrinsic issue with the broken-symmetry treatment of low-spin states. It shows, in particular, that the error in the BS calculation of exchange parameter scales with the degree of covalency between the magnetic and the bridging orbitals. This is due to the constraint on the form of multiconfigurational state imposed by the BS determinant, a feature common to other single-reference methods too. As a possible tool to overcome this intrinsic drawback of single-determinant BS approaches, we propose their extension to a minimal multiconfigurational version.

Title: Entropy functionals and equilibrium states in mixed quantum-classical dynamics
Authors: Cesare Tronci, David Martínez-Crespo, François Gay-Balmaz
Abstract: The computational challenges posed by many-particle quantum systems are often overcome by mixed quantum-classical (MQC) models in which certain degrees of freedom are treated as classical while others are retained as quantum. One of the fundamental questions raised by this hybrid picture involves the characterization of the information associated to MQC systems. Based on the theory of dynamical invariants in Hamiltonian systems, here we propose a family of hybrid entropy functionals that consistently specialize to the usual Rényi and Shannon entropies. Upon considering the MQC Ehrenfest model for the dynamics of quantum and classical probabilities, we apply the hybrid Shannon entropy to characterize equilibrium configurations for simple Hamiltonians. The present construction also applies beyond Ehrenfest dynamics.

Title: Vortex Dynamics in Tubular Fluid Membranes
Authors: Udaya Maurya, Surya Teja Gavva, Arpan Saha, Rickmoy Samanta
Abstract: We construct 2D viscous flow sourced by a point vortex embedded in a thin tubular membrane, coupled to external embedding fluids. The cylinder topology enforces the creation of an additional saddle in the flow field, consistent with Poincaré Index Theorem. In this setup, the incompressibility of the membrane fluid can be utilized to cast the dynamics of a multi-vortex system in the form of a Hamiltonian on the cylinder, which depends on the fluid viscosities and vortex strengths. The cylinder geometry breaks the in-plane rotational symmetry of the membrane and leads to several interesting features in the multi-vortex dynamics, distinct from flat and spherical fluid membranes. For a two vortex system of same circulation, we observe closed orbits with the inter-vortex separation oscillating in time. The compact angular direction of the membrane tube also allows two distinct closed orbits instead of one, under suitable initial conditions. Vortex pairs (vortices with opposite circulation) move together along helical geodesics in accordance with a conjecture by Kimura, Proceedings of the Royal Society A, Vol 455 (1999). We also explore relative equilibria of multi-vortex systems in this setup and demonstrate vortex leapfrogging via numerical simulations. Our results will be interesting in the context of microfluidic flows arising in nature as well as experimental studies in membrane tubes similar to PNAS 108 (31) 12605-12610 (2011).

Title: Decoherence-induced self-dual criticality in topological states of matter
Authors: Qingyuan Wang, Romain Vasseur, Simon Trebst, Andreas W.W. Ludwig, Guo-Yi Zhu
Abstract: Quantum measurements can be employed to induce decoherence in a restricted segment of a larger quantum many-body state, while generating entanglement for its remaining constituents. We demonstrate generally that measurement-induced phase transitions can be viewed as decoherence-induced critical mixed states. In this context, a deeper conceptual understanding is called for with regard to symmetry as an organizing principle. Integrating these connections we investigate the role of self-dual symmetry in mixed states, showing that the decoherence of electric (e) and magnetic (m) vortices from the 2D bulk of the toric code, or equivalently, a 2D cluster state with symmetry-protected topological order, can leave a (1+1)D quantum critical mixed state on the boundary protected by a weak Kramers-Wannier self-dual symmetry. The corresponding self-dual critical bulk is described by the $N\to1$ limit of the 2D Non-linear Sigma Model in symmetry class D with target space SO(2N)/U(N) at $\Theta$-angle $\pi$, and represents a "measurement-version" of the Cho-Fisher network model subjected to Born-rule randomness. Explicit breaking of self-duality, by incoherent noise amounting to fermion interactions or (non-interacting) coherent deformation, is shown to induce an RG crossover from this self-dual critical state to Nishimori criticality or to it from a novel type of Ising+ criticality, respectively, both related to the random-bond Ising model in different replica limits. Using an unbiased numerical approach combining tensor network, Monte Carlo, and Gaussian fermion simulations, we chart out a global phase diagram as diagnosed by coherent information and entanglement entropy measures. Our results point to a way towards a general understanding of mixed-state criticality in open quantum systems in terms of symmetry and topology.

Title: Simultaneous active and diffusive behaviour of asymmetric microclusters in a photophoretic trap
Authors: Anita Pahi, Kirty Ranjan Sahoo, Biswajit Das, Shuvojit Paul, Ayan Banerjee
Abstract: Active and diffusive motion in Brownian particles are regularly observed in fluidic environments, albeit at different time scales. Here, we experimentally study the dynamics of highly asymmetric microclusters trapped in air employing photophoretic forces generated from a loosely focused laser beam, where the trapped particles display active and diffusive dynamics simultaneously in orthogonal spatial directions. Thus, particle motion in the longitudinal direction ($z$) is enslaved to irregular kicks that naturally arise from an interplay of gravitational and photophoretic forces. This leads to a bimodal nature of the probability distribution function with a near-ballistic scaling of mean-squared displacement in the $z$ direction demonstrating active like dynamics, while the dynamics along the transverse ($x$) direction displays diffusive behaviour with a strong dependence on the motion along $z$. To explain these unique characteristics, we developed a 2D-Langevin model of a confined elliptic particle experiencing an additional stochastic force along $z$ to account for the arbitrary jumps. The numerical results show excellent qualitative agreement with the experimental observations. Our findings should pave the way for the design of high-efficiency Brownian engines in air, besides stimulating new research in the emerging field of photophoretic trapping.

Title: Measurement-Induced Entanglement Phase Transition in Free Fermion Systems
Authors: Han-Ze Li, Jian-Xin Zhong, Xue-Jia Yu
Abstract: Measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions (MIET) highlight how local measurements drive quantum systems between area-law and volume-law entangled states. This review surveys MIET in free fermion models, focusing on how unitary hopping competes with measurement-induced non-unitarity. We discuss controversies regarding the existence of MIET in one dimension, the impact of non-Hermitian skin effects, and potential experimental platforms. We conclude with open challenges, including feedback control and higher-dimensional extensions.

Title: Non-linear and non-empirical double hybrid density functional
Authors: Danish Khan
Abstract: We develop a non-linear and non-empirical (nLanE) double hybrid density functional derived from an accurate interpolation of the adiabatic connection in density functional theory, incorporating the correct asymptotic expansions. By bridging the second-order perturbative weak correlation limit with the fully interacting limit from the semi-local SCAN functional, nLanE-SCAN is free of fitted parameters while providing improved energetic predictions compared to SCAN for moderately and strongly correlated systems alike. It delivers accurate predictions for atomic total energies and multiple reaction datasets from the GMTKN55 benchmark while significantly outperforming traditional linear hybrids and double hybrids for non-covalent interactions without requiring dispersion corrections. Due to the exact constraints at the weak correlation limit, nLanE-SCAN has reduced delocalization errors as evident through SIE4x4 and bond dissociations of H\(_2^+\) and He\(_2^+\). Its proper asymptotic behavior ensures stability in strongly correlated systems, improving H\(_2\) and N\(_2\) bond dissociation profiles compared to conventional functionals.
