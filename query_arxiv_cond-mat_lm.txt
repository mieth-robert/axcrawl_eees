Title: Electrical switching of an unconventional odd parity magnet
Authors: Qian Song, Srdjan Stavrić, Paolo Barone, Andrea Droghetti, Daniil S. Antonenko, Jörn W. F. Venderbos, Connor A. Occhialini, Batyr Ilyas, Emre Ergeçen, Nuh Gedik, Sang-Wook Cheong, Rafael M. Fernandes, Silvia Picozzi, Riccardo Comin
Abstract: Magnetic states with zero magnetization but non-relativistic spin splitting are outstanding candidates for the next generation of spintronic devices. Their electron-volt (eV) scale spin splitting, ultrafast spin dynamics and nearly vanishing stray fields make them particularly promising for several applications. A variety of such magnetic states with nontrivial spin textures have been identified recently, including even-parity d, g, or i-wave altermagnets and odd-parity p-wave magnets. Achieving voltage-based control of the nonuniform spin polarization of these magnetic states is of great interest for realizing energyefficient and compact devices for information storage and processing. Spin-spiral type-II multiferroics are optimal candidates for such voltage-based control, as they exhibit an inversion-symmetry-breaking magnetic order which directly induces ferroelectric polarization, allowing for symmetry protected cross-control between spin chirality and polar order. Here we combine photocurrent measurements, first-principle calculations and group-theory analysis to provide direct evidence that the spin polarization of the spin-spiral type-II multiferroic NiI2 exhibits odd-parity character connected to the spiral chirality. The symmetry-protected coupling between chirality and polar order enables electrical control of a primarily non-relativistic spin polarization. Our findings represent the first direct observation of unconventional odd-parity magnetism in a spin-spiral type-II multiferroic, and open a new frontier of voltage-based switching of non-relativistic spin polarization in compensated magnets.

Title: Extracting average properties of disordered spin chains with translationally invariant tensor networks
Authors: Kevin Vervoort, Wei Tang, Nick Bultinck
Abstract: We develop a tensor network-based method for calculating disorder-averaged expectation values in random spin chains without having to explicitly sample over disorder configurations. The algorithm exploits statistical translation invariance and works directly in the thermodynamic limit. We benchmark our method on the infinite-randomness critical point of the random transverse field Ising model.

Title: Enhanced superconductivity in X4H15compounds via hole-doping at ambient pressure
Authors: Kun Gao, Wenwen Cui, Tiago F. T. Cerqueira, Hai-ChenWang, Silvana Botti, Miguel A. L. Marque
Abstract: This study presents a computational investigation of X4H15 compounds (where X represents a metal) as potential superconductors at ambient conditions or under pressure. Through systematic density functional theory calculations and electron-phonon coupling analysis, we demonstrate that electronic structure engineering via hole doping dramatically enhances the superconducting properties of these materials. While electron-doped compounds with X4+ cations (Ti, Zr, Hf, Th) exhibit modest transition temperatures of 1-9 K, hole-doped systems with X3+cations (Y, Tb, Dy, Ho,Er, Tm, Lu) show remarkably higher values of approximately 50 K at ambient pressure. Superconductivity in hole-doped compounds originates from stronger coupling between electrons and both cation and hydrogen phonon modes. Although pristine X3+4H15compounds are thermodynamically unstable, we propose a viable synthesis route via controlled hole doping of the charge-compensated YZr3H15 compound. Our calculations predict that even minimal concentrations of excess Y could induce high-temperature superconductivity while preserving structural integrity. This work reveals how strategic electronic structure modulation can optimize superconducting properties in hydride systems, establishing a promising pathway toward practical high-temperature conventional super-conductors at ambient pressure

Title: Low Resistance P-type Contacts to Monolayer WSe$_2$ through Chlorinated Solvent Doping
Authors: Lauren Hoang, Robert K.A. Bennett, Anh Tuan Hoang, Tara Pena, Zhepeng Zhang, Marisa Hocking, Ashley P. Saunders, Fang Liu, Eric Pop, Andrew J. Mannix
Abstract: Tungsten diselenide (WSe$_2$) is a promising p-type semiconductor limited by high contact resistance ($R_\textrm{C}$) and the lack of a reliable doping strategy. Here, we demonstrate that exposing WSe$_2$ to chloroform provides simple and stable p-type doping. In monolayer WSe$_2$ transistors with Pd contacts, chloroform increases the maximum hole current by over 100$\times$ (>200 $\mu$A/$\mu$m), reduces $R_\textrm{C}$ to ~2.5 k$\Omega\cdot\mu$m, and retains an on/off ratio of $10^{10}$ at room temperature. These improvements persist for over 8 months, survive annealing above 150 °C, and remain effective down to 10 K, enabling a cryogenic $R_\textrm{C}$ of ~1 k$\Omega\cdot\mu$m. Density functional theory indicates that chloroform strongly physisorbs to WSe$_2$, inducing hole doping with minimal impact on the electronic states between the valence band and conduction band edges. Auger electron spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy reveal that chloroform intercalates at the WSe$_2$ interface with the gate oxide, contributing to doping stability and mitigating interfacial dielectric disorder. This robust, scalable approach enables high-yield WSe$_2$ transistors with good p-type performance.

Title: Electrical Side-Gate Control of Anisotropic Magnetoresistance and Magnetic Anisotropy in a Composite Multiferroic
Authors: Katherine Johnson, Michael Newburger, Michael Page, Roland K. Kawakami
Abstract: Composite multiferroics consisting of a ferroelectric material interfaced with a ferromagnetic material can function above room temperature and exhibit improved magnetoelectric (ME) coupling compared to single-phase multiferroic materials, making them desirable for applications in energy efficient electronic devices. In this study, we demonstrate electrical side-gate control of magnetoresistance and magnetic anisotropy in single-crystalline ferromagnetic Fe$_{0.75}$Co$_{0.25}$ thin films grown on ferroelectric PMN-PT (001) substrates by molecular beam epitaxy. Fe$_{0.75}$Co$_{0.25}$ is selected due to its large magnetoelastic coupling and low magnetic damping. We find that the magnetoresistance curves of patterned Fe$_{0.75}$Co$_{0.25}$ films are controlled by voltages applied to electrostatic side gates. Angle-dependent magnetoresistance scans reveal that the origin of this effect is strain-mediated variation of the magnetic anisotropy due to piezoelectric effects in the PMN-PT. This electrical control of magnetic properties could serve as a building block for future magnetoelectronic and magnonic devices.

Title: Power Transfer in Magnetoelectric Resonators: a Combined Analytical and Finite Element Study
Authors: Emma Van Meirvenne, Frederic Vanderveken, Daniele Narducci, Bart Sorée, Florin Ciubotaru, Christoph Adelmann
Abstract: We present an analytical model for power transfer in a magnetoelectric film bulk acoustic resonator (FBAR) comprising a piezoelectric-magnetostrictive bilayer. The model describes the power flow between the elastic and magnetic systems, quantifying the transduction efficiency when the FBAR operates as a magnetic transducer. By applying the model to example systems using piezoelectric ScAlN and magnetostrictive CoFeB, Ni, or Terfenol-D layers, we demonstrate the potential for achieving high efficiencies in magnetoelectric transducers, rendering them ideal for efficient ferromagnetic resonance excitation. The validity of the model's assumptions is confirmed through comparison with a numerical finite element resonator model in COMSOL\texttrademark. The finite element model further enables a comprehensive study of the resonator's dynamic behavior, including transient and steady-state regimes, and the identification of resonant frequencies within the system.

Title: Tunable stacking-driven topological phase transitions in pnictide layers
Authors: Arjyama Bordoloi, Daniel Kaplan, Sobhit Singh
Abstract: Nonmagnetic topological insulators (TIs) are known for their robust metallic surface/edge states that are protected by time-reversal symmetry, making them promising candidates for next-generation spintronic and nanoelectronic devices. Traditional approaches to realizing TIs have focused on inducing band inversion via strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC), yet many materials with substantial SOC often remain topologically trivial. In this work, we present a materials-design strategy for engineering topologically non-trivial phases, e.g., quantum spin Hall phases, by vertically stacking topologically trivial Rashba monolayers in an inverted fashion. Using BiSb as a prototype system, we demonstrate that while the BiSb monolayer is topologically trivial (despite having significant SOC), an inverted BiSb-SbBi bilayer configuration realizes a non-trivial topological phase with enhanced spin Hall conductivity. We further reveal a delicate interplay between the SOC strength and the interlayer electron tunneling that governs the emergence of a nontrivial topological phase in the bilayer heterostructure. This phase can be systematically tuned using an external electric field, providing an experimentally accessible means of controlling the system's topology. Our magnetotransport studies further validate this interplay, by revealing g-factor suppression and the emergence a zeroth Landau level. Notably, the inverted bilayer heterostructure exhibits a robust and tunable spin Hall effect, with performance comparable to that of state-of-the-art materials. Thus, our findings unveil an alternative pathway for designing and engineering functional properties in 2D topological systems using topologically trivial constituent monolayers.

Title: Phase Diagram of UTe$_2$
Authors: V.P.Mineev
Abstract: The pressure-temperature phase diagram of superconducting UTe$_2$ with three lines of the second-order phase transitions cannot be explained in terms of successive transitions to superconducting states with a decrease in symmetry. The problem is solved using a two-band description of the superconducting state of UTe$_2$.

Title: Determining the Nature of Magnetism in Altermagnetic Candidate RuO$_2$
Authors: Tiema Qian, Aya Rutherford, Eun Sang Choi, Haidong Zhou, Boris Maiorov, Minseong Lee, Christopher A. Mizzi
Abstract: The terminology "altermagnetism" has recently been adopted to describe collinear magnetic order with no net magnetization and non-relativisitic, momentum-dependent spin-splitting. The archetypal material used to theoretically explore altermagnetism is RuO$_2$, but there has been significant debate as to whether RuO$_2$ possesses magnetic, let alone altermagnetic, order. To address questions surrounding the nature of magnetism in RuO$_2$, we combine symmetry-sensitive torque magnetometry and magnetization measurements in single crystals. The data are inconsistent with collinear magnetic order possessing a Néel vector along the $c-$axis. Torque magnetometry further demonstrates an isotropic magnetic susceptibility within the $ab-$plane, indicative of neither a Néel vector within the $ab-$plane nor a field-induced Néel vector reorientation. Magnetic quantum oscillations from both techniques reveal a nearly spherical Fermi surface pocket at the Brillouin zone center, in agreement with paramagnetic electronic structure calculations. Taken together, these data indicate no detectable long-range magnetic order and, by extension, suggest no altermagnetism in high-quality RuO$_2$ single crystals.

Title: From hierarchical triangular spin liquid to multi-$q$ spin texture in spinel GeFe$_2$O$_4$
Authors: L. Chaix, J. Robert, E. Chan, E. Ressouche, S. Petit, C. V. Colin, R. Ballou, J. Ollivier, L.-P. Regnault, E. Lhotel, V. Cathelin, S. Lenne, C. Cavanel, F. Damay, E. Suard, P. Strobel, C. Darie, S. deBrion, V. Simonet
Abstract: Combining macroscopic measurements, neutron scattering and modeling, we identify in the GeFe$_2$O$_4$ spinel a correlated paramagnetic state resulting from the predominance of third-neighbor antiferromagnetic interactions. These interactions materialize 4 isolated families of triangular planes with 120$^{\circ}$ spins emerging from the underlying pyrochlore lattice. At lower temperatures, a phase transition occurs from this hierarchical spin liquid to a non-coplanar spin texture that is characterized by 6 propagating vectors. This unusual multi-$q$ order is triggered by the presence of weaker interactions up to the sixth neighbors. The system is remarkably successful in coupling the different triangular planes while maintaining their two-dimensional 120$^{\circ}$ order. Our study highlights the hierarchy of interactions involved in GeFe$_2$O$_4$, which is singular among spinel compounds since first-neighbor interactions are only a small fraction of the dominant third neighbor ones.

Title: The Relevance of Non-axiality and Low-lying Excited States for Slow Magnetic Relaxation in Pentagonal-bipyramidal Erbium(III) Complexes Probed by High-frequency EPR
Authors: J. Arneth, L. Spillecke, C. Koo, T. A. Bazhenova, E. B. Yagubskii, R. Klingeler
Abstract: High-frequency/high-field electron paramagnetic resonance studies on a series of seven-coordinate pentagonal-bipyramidal (PBP) erbium(III) complexes Er(DAPMBH/H$_2$DAPS)X (H$_2$DAPMBH = 2,6-diacetylpyridine bis-4-methoxy benzoylhydrazone, H$_4$DAPS = 2,6-diacetylpyridine bis-(salicylhydrazone)) demonstrate the effects of different apical ligands (X = (H$_2$O)Cl (1), (CH$_3$OH)N$_3$ (2), Cl$_2$ (3)) on the local magnetic anisotropy of the central Er(III) ions. In particular, we report direct experimental determination of the effective $g$-values and zero field splittings of the energetically low-lying Kramers doublets. Our quantitative determination of the magnetic anisotropy highlights the relevance of an axial $g$-tensor for SMM behaviour and suggests that fast magnetic relaxation is mainly driven by a thermally assisted quantum tunnelling process via low-lying excited states.

Title: Anyonization of bosons in one dimension: an effective swap model
Authors: Botao Wang, Amit Vashisht, Yanliang Guo, Sudipta Dhar, Manuele Landini, Hanns-Christoph Nägerl, Nathan Goldman
Abstract: Anyons emerge as elementary excitations in low-dimensional quantum systems and exhibit behavior distinct from bosons or fermions. Previous models of anyons in one dimension (1D) are mainly categorized into two types: those that rely on nontrivial scattering behavior, and those based on density-dependent hopping processes in discrete lattices. Here, we introduce a novel framework for realizing anyonic correlations using the internal degrees of freedom of a spinor quantum gas. We propose a "swap" model, which assigns a complex phase factor to the swapping processes between two different species, referred to as "host particles" and "impurities". The anyonic characteristics are demonstrated through the one-body correlator of the impurity, using a spin-charge separation analysis. For a single impurity, our swap model can be effectively implemented by applying tilt potentials in a strongly interacting quantum gas [Dhar et al., arXiv:2412.21131]. We further explore the dynamical properties of anyonic correlations and extend our analysis to the case of multiple impurities. Our work provides new avenues for engineering many-body anyonic behavior in quantum simulation platforms.

Title: Surface Structure and Surface State of a Tight-Binding Model on a Diamond Lattice
Authors: Katsunori Kubo
Abstract: Surface states of a tight-binding model with nearest-neighbor hopping on a diamond lattice of finite thickness are investigated. We consider systems with (001), (110), and (111) surfaces. Even if the surface direction is fixed, there is freedom to choose the surface structure due to the two-sublattice nature of a diamond lattice. The existence of surface states is governed by the topology of the matrix elements of the bulk Hamiltonian. In this sense, the existence of surface states is determined by the bulk Hamiltonian. However, the matrix elements depend on the choice of the unit cell, which should be chosen to conform to the surface structure. Thus, the surface states depend on the surface structure. We find that for each surface direction, there are two choices of surface structure, and depending on the chosen structure, the corresponding surface states emerge in distinct regions of the surface Brillouin zone.

Title: Database and deep-learning scalability of anharmonic phonon properties by automated brute-force first-principles calculations
Authors: Masato Ohnishi, Tianqi Deng, Pol Torres, Zhihao Xu, Terumasa Tadano, Haoming Zhang, Wei Nong, Masatoshi Hanai, Zhiting Tian, Ming Hu, Xiulin Ruan, Ryo Yoshida, Toyotaro Suzumura, Lucas Lindsay, Alan J. H. McGaughey, Tengfei Luo, Kedar Hippalgaonkar, Junichiro Shiomi
Abstract: Understanding the anharmonic phonon properties of crystal compounds -- such as phonon lifetimes and thermal conductivities -- is essential for investigating and optimizing their thermal transport behaviors. These properties also impact optical, electronic, and magnetic characteristics through interactions between phonons and other quasiparticles and fields. In this study, we develop an automated first-principles workflow to calculate anharmonic phonon properties and build a comprehensive database encompassing more than 6,000 inorganic compounds. Utilizing this dataset, we train a graph neural network model to predict thermal conductivity values and spectra from structural parameters, demonstrating a scaling law in which prediction accuracy improves with increasing training data size. High-throughput screening with the model enables the identification of materials exhibiting extreme thermal conductivities -- both high and low. The resulting database offers valuable insights into the anharmonic behavior of phonons, thereby accelerating the design and development of advanced functional materials.

Title: Rate Analysis of Dislocations Overcoming Elastic Barriers: Effects of Entropy and Langevin Friction via Kramers Theory
Authors: Mohammadhossein Nahavandian, Liam Myhill, Enrique Martinez
Abstract: Thermal activation of dislocations is critical for predicting the mechanical response of materials under common experimental conditions. According to transition state theory (TST), the rate for the system to overcome free energy barriers depends on an attempt frequency, activation free energy, and temperature. We computed the rate for edge and screw dislocation dipoles to overcome their interaction fields at various temperatures, Langevin friction coefficients, and shear stresses using Molecular Dynamics (MD), Schoeck entropy formalism and compared with Kramers rate theory. Rates computed dynamically show dependence on Langevin friction, increasing with weaker friction and showing more correlated events. Statically, using Schoeck formalism and computing the minimum energy path (MEP), we found significant entropic effects at high temperature and a transition from Arrhenius to non-Arrhenius behavior near the critical resolved shear stress values for both edge and screw characters.

Title: Analytical model and experimental validation for nonlinear mechanical response of aspirated elastic shells
Authors: Kazutoshi Masuda, Miho Yanagisawa
Abstract: We developed a physics-based analytical model to describe the nonlinear mechanical response of aspirated elastic shells. By representing the elastic energy through a stretching modulus, $K$, and a dimensionless ratio, $\delta$, capturing the balance between stretching and bending energies, the model reveals mechanical behaviors extending beyond conventional approaches. Validated across microscale droplets and macroscale silicone sheets by fitting experimental force-displacement curves, this approach provides accurate, scalable characterization of deformed elastic shells. This framework advances our understanding of soft thin-shell mechanics, with broad applications in probing living cells and designing soft materials.

Title: NEP89: Universal neuroevolution potential for inorganic and organic materials across 89 elements
Authors: Ting Liang, Ke Xu, Eric Lindgren, Zherui Chen, Rui Zhao, Jiahui Liu, Benrui Tang, Bohan Zhang, Yanzhou Wang, Keke Song, Penghua Ying, Haikuan Dong, Shunda Chen, Paul Erhart, Zheyong Fan, Tapio Ala-Nissila, Jianbin Xu
Abstract: Machine-learned potentials (MLPs) offer near-first-principles accuracy for atomistic simulations, but many models are material-specific or computationally intensive, limiting their broader use. Here, we introduce NEP89, a foundation model based on the neuroevolution potential (NEP) architecture, delivering empirical-potential-like speed and high accuracy across 89 chemical elements. A compact yet comprehensive training dataset covering inorganic and organic materials across 89 elements was curated through descriptor-space subsampling and an iterative active-learning-like process applied to multiple datasets. We rigorously evaluated NEP89's predictive performance against representative foundation models, demonstrating its reliability and competitive accuracy across diverse benchmark studies. NEP89 is 3-4 orders of magnitude more computationally efficient than comparable models, enabling previously impractical large-scale atomistic simulations for both inorganic and organic systems. It also supports fine-tuning on small datasets, allowing rapid adaptation to user-specific applications. This work marks a significant advancement in MLPs, enabling high-performance atomistic simulations across diverse research fields and communities.

Title: Towards Space Group Determination from EBSD Patterns: The Role of Deep Learning and High-throughput Dynamical Simulations
Authors: Alfred Yan, Muhammad Nur Talha Kilic, Gert Nolze, Ankit Agrawal, Alok Choudhary, Roberto dos Reis, Vinayak Dravid
Abstract: The design of novel materials hinges on the understanding of structure-property relationships. However, our capability to synthesize a large number of materials has outpaced the ability and speed needed to characterize them. While the overall chemical constituents can be readily known during synthesis, the structural evolution and characterization of newly synthesized samples remains a bottleneck for the ultimate goal of high throughput nanomaterials discovery. Thus, scalable methods for crystal symmetry determination that can analyze a large volume of material samples within a short time-frame are especially needed. Kikuchi diffraction in the SEM is a promising technique for this due to its sensitivity to dynamical scattering, which may provide information beyond just the seven crystal systems and fourteen Bravais lattices. After diffraction patterns are collected from material samples, deep learning methods may be able to classify the space group symmetries using the patterns as input, which paired with the elemental composition, would help enable the determination of the crystal structure. To investigate the feasibility of this solution, neural networks were trained to predict the space group type of background corrected EBSD patterns. Our networks were first trained and tested on an artificial dataset of EBSD patterns of 5,148 different cubic phases, created through physics-based dynamical simulations. Next, Maximum Classifier Discrepancy, an unsupervised deep learning-based domain adaptation method, was utilized to train neural networks to make predictions for experimental EBSD patterns. We introduce a relabeling scheme, which enables our models to achieve accuracy scores higher than 90% on simulated and experimental data, suggesting that neural networks are capable of making predictions of crystal symmetry from an EBSD pattern.

Title: Higgs mode in two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy of weak-coupling antiferromagnets
Authors: Jiyu Chen, Naoto Tsuji, Philipp Werner
Abstract: Two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) provides insights into the nonlinear response of correlated lattice systems. We simulate multipulse excitations in the Hubbard model using nonequilibrium dynamical mean-field theory to extract the 2DCS signal of weak-coupling antiferromagnets with and without disorder. By comparing calculations with static and dynamic Hartree terms, and analyzing the waiting-time dependence of the signal, we identify the contribution of the collective amplitude (Higgs) mode to the spectroscopic features and the relevant underlying processes. With broadband pulses, the rephasing and nonrephasing peaks at the gap energy are found to be of predominant Higgs character, while the two-quantum signals originate from single-particle excitations. Using narrow-band pulses, we also demonstrate a strong enhancement of these Higgs-related signals at a pulse frequency of half the gap size.

Title: From fluttering to drifting in inertialess sedimentation of achiral particles
Authors: Christian Vaquero-Stainer, Tymoteusz Miara, Anne Juel, Matthias Heil, Draga Pihler-Puzović
Abstract: There has been much recent interest in the chiral motion of achiral particles that sediment in a viscous fluid in a regime where inertial effects can be neglected. This occurs in a broad range of applications such as those involving biological objects like algae, ultra-thin graphene flakes, or colloidal suspensions. It is known that articles with two planes of symmetry can be categorised as ``settlers'', ``drifters'' or ``flutterers'', where the latter sediment along chiral trajectories despite their achiral shapes. Here we analyse the sedimentation of circular disks bent into a U-shape (``flutterers'') and show how their behaviour changes when we break one of their symmetries by pinching the disks along their axis. The ``fluttering'' behaviour is found to be robust to such shape changes, with the trajectories now evolving towards helical paths. However, the behaviour changes when the degree of pinching becomes too strong, at which point the particles become ``drifters'' which sediment steadily without rotation. We establish criteria for the transition between the two types of behaviour and confirm our predictions in experiments. Finally, we discuss the implications of our observations for the dispersion of dilute suspensions made of such particles.

Title: Thermodynamic formulation of the spin magnetic octupole moment in bulk crystals
Authors: Jun Ōiké, Robert Peters, Koki Shinada
Abstract: The discovery of unconventional antiferromagnets, such as altermagnets, has drawn significant attention to higher-rank magnetic multipoles. Despite the advances in research, a fundamental understanding of multipole moments, particularly octupole moments, remains limited due to the challenges of accurately treating the position operator in bulk crystals, which is integral to their definitions. In this paper, we overcome this problem by using a thermodynamic relation and derive a formula of the spin magnetic octupole moment (SMOM) that can be used in bulk crystals. The resulting formula is gauge invariant and satisfies Středa formulas, which relate the SMOM to the spin magnetoelectric dipole-quadrupole susceptibilities. Furthermore, we apply this formula to several models and examine the fundamental properties of the SMOM. One particularly important property is that the SMOM of $d$-wave altermagnets is dominated by nonrelativistic SMOMs regardless of spin-orbit coupling. Moreover, these nonrelativistic SMOMs exhibit a Néel order dependence that is predicted by the Landau theory of $d$-wave altermagnetism [Phys. Rev. Lett. $\textbf{132}$, 176702 (2024)].

Title: Ultralow-Temperature Thermodynamics and Optical Coherence of Narrow Linewidth Optical Emitters

Abstract: The coherence properties of optical emitters in crystals are critical for quantum technologies and optical frequency metrology. Cooling to sub-kelvin temperatures can significantly enhance their coherence, making it essential to identify the key parameters governing emitter and host crystal behavior in this ultra cold regime. We investigate a Czochralski-grown europium doped yttrium orthosilicate crystal, and we report measurements of the heat capacity, a parameter fundamental to evaluating thermal noise limits in metrology schemes based on spectral hole stabilization in such samples. In parallel, we characterize optical coherence via photon echo measurements as a function of temperature. Below 1 K, where phonon contributions diminish, two-level systems (TLS) associated with crystal imperfections may emerge as a limiting factor. A linear-in-temperature term in the heat capacity serves as a signature of TLS, and from our data, we establish an upper bound on this contribution. This, combined with the optical homogeneous linewidth from photon-echo measurements being constant in the interval from 300 mK to 2 K demonstrates a minimal TLSrelated effects in our sample. These findings highlight the promise of ultralow-temperature operation for enhancing the performance of optical quantum devices based on doped crystals.

Title: Topotactical hydrogen induced single-band $d$-wave superconductivity in La$_2$NiO$_4$
Authors: Ying Gao, Wenfeng Wu, Zhaoxin Liu, Karsten Held, Liang Si
Abstract: La$_2$NiO$_4$ is an antiferromagnetic insulator with a structural resemblance to its cuprate counterpart, La$_2$CuO$_4$. However, La$_2$CuO$_4$ has a Cu$^{2+}$ or 3$d^9$ electronic configuration that needs to be hole or electron doped for superconductivity, whereas La$_2$NiO$_4$ is 3$d^8$ with divalent Ni$^{2+}$. Making a cuprate analog through conventional electron doping is impractical due to the rarity of trivalent substituents for La. In this work, we propose an alternative route: intercalating topotactical hydrogen which is possible through electric-field-controlled protonation and transforms La$_2$NiO$_4$ into a 3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ single-band two-dimensional anti-ferromagnetic Mott insulator analogous to La$_2$CuO$_4$. This we find through density-functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory calculations. The furthergoing dynamical vertex approximation predicts that H-La$_2$NiO$_4$ can host $d$-wave superconductivity under 15\% hole doping with a critical temperature above 20\,K. Our findings not only suggest a new method for tuning the electronic structure of layered nickelates but also provides theoretical evidence for a new nickelate superconductor, awaiting experimental synthesis.

Title: Quantum theory of magnetic octupole in periodic crystals and characterization of time-reversal-symmetry breaking antiferromagnetism
Authors: Takumi Sato, Satoru Hayami
Abstract: Magnetic multipoles have been recognized as order parameters characterizing magnetic structure in solids, with magnetic dipole serving as canonical examples in ferromagnets. Recently, magnetic octupoles have been proposed as the order parameters of time-reversal-symmetry breaking centrosymmetric antiferromagnets exhibiting nonrelativistic spin splitting, which is referred to as ``altermagnet''. However, a gauge-invariant formulation of magnetic octupoles in crystalline solids remains elusive. Here, we present a gauge-invariant expression of spin magnetic octupoles in periodic crystals based on quantum mechanics and thermodynamics. Our expression reveals a contribution from an anisotropic magnetic dipole, which has the same symmetry as conventional spin and orbital magnetic dipoles but carries no net magnetization. We demonstrate that such an anisotropic magnetic dipole acts as an order parameter for antiferromagnets that exhibit the anomalous Hall effect.

Title: Diffusion of intruders in a granular gas thermostatted by a bath of elastic hard spheres
Authors: Rubén Gómez González, Vicente Garzó
Abstract: The Boltzmann kinetic equation is considered to compute the transport coefficients associated with the mass flux of intruders in a granular gas. Intruders and granular gas are immersed in a gas of elastic hard spheres (molecular gas). We assume that the granular particles are sufficiently rarefied so that the state of the molecular gas is not affected by the presence of the granular gas. Thus, the gas of elastic hard spheres can be considered as a thermostat (or bath) at a fixed temperature $T_g$. In the absence of spatial gradients, the system achieves a steady state where the temperature of the granular gas $T$ differs from that of the intruders $T_0$ (energy nonequipartition). Approximate theoretical predictions for the temperature ratios $T/T_g$ and $T_0/T_g$ and the kurtosis $c$ and $c_0$ associated with the granular gas and the intruders compare very well with Monte Carlo simulations for conditions of practical interest. For states close to the steady homogeneous state, the Boltzmann equation for the intruders is solved by means of the Chapman--Enskog method to first order in the spatial gradients. As expected, the diffusion transport coefficients are given in terms of the solutions of a set of coupled linear integral equations which are approximately solved by considering the first-Sonine approximation. In dimensionless form, the transport coefficients are nonlinear functions of the mass and diameter ratios, the coefficients of restitution, and the (reduced) bath temperature. Interestingly, previous results derived from a suspension model based on an effective fluid-solid interaction force are recovered when $m/m_g\to \infty$ and $m_0/m_g\to \infty$, where $m$, $m_0$, and $m_g$ are the masses of the granular, intruder, and molecular gas particle, respectively. Finally, as an application of our results, thermal diffusion segregation is exhaustively analysed.

Title: Discrete time crystals detected by time-translation twist
Authors: Ryota Nakai, Taozhi Guo, Shinsei Ryu
Abstract: We introduce a boundary condition twisted by time translation as a novel probe to characterize dynamical phases in periodically driven (Floquet) quantum systems. Inspired by twisted boundary conditions in equilibrium systems, this approach modifies the temporal evolution of the system upon completing a spatial loop, enabling the identification of distinct Floquet phases, including discrete time crystals (DTCs). By studying the spectral form factor (SFF) and its response to the twist, we uncover signatures of time-crystalline order, which exhibits periodic dependence on the twist parameter analogous to the Little-Parks effect in superconductors. We apply this framework to the kicked Ising model, demonstrating that our twist can distinguish time-crystalline phases.

Abstract: High-quality total scattering data, a key tool for understanding atomic-scale structure in disordered materials, require stable instrumentation and access to high momentum transfers. This is now routine at dedicated synchrotron instrumentation using high-energy X-ray beams, but it is very challenging to measure a total scattering dataset in less than a few microseconds. This limits their effectiveness for capturing structural changes that occur at the much faster timescales of atomic motion. Current X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) provide femtosecond-pulsed X-ray beams with maximum energies of approximately 24 keV, giving the potential to measure total scattering and the attendant pair distribution functions (PDFs) on femtosecond timescales. Here, we show that this potential has been realised using the HED scientific instrument at the European XFEL and present normalised total scattering data for 0.35 Å-1 < Q < 16.6 Å-1 and their PDFs from a broad spectrum of materials, including crystalline, nanocrystalline and amorphous solids, liquids, and clusters in solution. We analyse the data using a variety of methods, including Rietveld refinement, small-box PDF refinement, joint reciprocal-real space refinement, cluster refinement, and Debye scattering analysis. The resolution function of the setup is also thoroughly characterised. We conclusively show that high-quality data can be obtained from a single approximately 30 fs XFEL pulse. Our efforts not only significantly increase the existing maximum reported Q-range for an S(Q) measured at an XFEL but also mean that XFELs are now a viable X-ray source for the broad community of people using reciprocal space total scattering and PDF methods in their research.

Title: Exchange Surface Spin Waves in Type-A van der Waals Antiferromagnets
Authors: Zhoujian Sun, Fuxiang Li, Gerrit E. W. Bauer, Ping Tang
Abstract: Surface spin waves in the short-wavelength regime enable ultrafast, nanoscale magnon-based devices. Here we report the emergence of surface spin-wave excitations within the bulk magnon band gap of type-A van der Waals antiferromagnets composed of antiferromagnetically coupled ferromagnetic monolayers. In contrast to the magnetostatic Damon-Eshbach modes in magnetic slabs, these surface waves are pure exchange modes owing to the reduced interlayer exchange coupling at surface layers, and thus persist in ultrathin multilayer stacks and at large wave numbers. We show that they can be efficiently excited by electromagnetic waves, with absorption power comparable to or even exceeding that of bulk modes. Moreover, their magnetic stray fields exhibit pronounced even-odd oscillations with the number of monolayers that should be observable by NV-center magnetometry.

Title: Gate-tunable polarity inversions and three-fold rotation symmetry of the superconducting diode effect
Authors: William F. Schiela, Melissa Mikalsen, Daniel Crawford, Stefan Ilić, William M. Strickland, F. Sebastian Bergeret, Javad Shabani
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect is an asymmetry in the critical current with respect to the supercurrent polarity. One impetus driving recent interest in the effect is its dependence on intrinsic or microscopic symmetry breaking mechanisms. Here, we study the superconducting diode effect in gated planar Josephson junctions fabricated on a superconductor--semiconductor heterostructure under an in-plane magnetic field. We observe two gate-driven inversions of the diode polarity in the vicinity of zero field, as well as a third-harmonic component in the dependence of the diode efficiency on the in-plane field angle. We analyze the Lifshitz invariant for an arbitrary spin--orbit coupling and show that multiple polarity inversions are possible in the presence of both linear and cubic Dresselhaus terms, where the Rashba parameter varies monotonically with gate voltage. Numerical calculations of the diode efficiency further reveal the presence of higher harmonics in its field-angle dependence in the presence of spin--orbit coupling.

Title: Chiral interactions between tropocollagen molecules determine the collagen microfibril structure
Authors: Art'om Zolotarjov, Roland Kröger, Dmitri O. Pushkin
Abstract: Collagen is the most abundant structural protein in animals, forming hierarchically organised fibrils that provide mechanical support to tissues. Despite detailed structural studies, the physical principles that govern the formation of the characteristic axially-periodic collagen microfibril remain poorly understood. Here, we present a theoretical framework that links the amino acid sequence of tropocollagen to its supramolecular organisation. By combining statistical modeling of residue geometry with sequence-informed interaction potentials, we show that the chiral arrangement of outward-facing residues induces directional intermolecular interactions that drive molecular supercoiling. These interactions favour the formation of right-handed, pentameric microfibrils with a staggered axial periodicity of approximately 67 nm. Our simulations reveal that this structure emerges across a wide range of mammalian collagen sequences as a global energy minimum robust to biochemical noise. These findings provide a mechanistic explanation for collagen's supramolecular chirality and offer design principles for engineering synthetic collagen-mimetic materials.

Title: Monolayer C$_{60}$ networks: A first-principles perspective
Authors: Bo Peng, Michele Pizzochero
Abstract: Monolayer fullerene (C$_{60}$) networks combine molecular-level rigidity with crystalline connectivity, offering a promising platform for numerous applications. In this Feature article, we review the physical and chemical properties of fullerene monolayers, focusing on first-principles studies. We first explore the structural stability of monolayer phases and investigate their thermal expansion behaviours. We then outline criteria for photocatalytic water splitting and introduce theoretical predictions which are supported by recent experimental verification. Finally, we show how interlayer stacking, molecular size, and dimensional tuning (from 2D monolayers into 3D crystals, 1D chains, or nanoribbons) offer versatile approaches to modulate their chemical functionality. Together, these insights establish fullerene networks as a novel class of carbon-based materials with tailored properties for catalysis, photovoltaics, and flexible electronics.

Title: Investigation of magnon behavior in YIG film under microwave excitation using Brillouin light scattering
Authors: Guofu Xu, Kang An, Wenjun Ma, Xiling Li, C. K. Ong, Chi Zhang, Guozhi Chai
Abstract: We utilize conventional wave-vector-resolved Brillouin light scattering technology to investigate the spin wave response in YIG thin films under high-power microwave excitation. By varying the microwave frequency, external bias magnetic field, and in-plane wave vector, in addition to observing the dipole-exchange spin waves excited by parallel parametric pumping, we further observe broadband spin wave excitation within the dipole-exchange spin wave spectrum. This broadband excitation results from the combined effects of parallel and perpendicular parametric pumping, induced by irregularities in the excitation geometry, as well as magnon-magnon scattering arising from the absence of certain spin wave modes. Our findings offer new insights into the mechanisms of energy dissipation and relaxation processes caused by spin wave excitation in magnetic devices operating at high power.

Title: Towards a $\cos(2φ)$ Josephson element using aluminum junctions with well-transmitted channels
Authors: J. Griesmar, H. Riechert, M. Hantute, A. Peugeot, S. Annabi, Ç. Ö. Girit, G. O. Steffensen, A. L. Yeyati, E. Arrighi, L. Bretheau, J.-D. Pillet
Abstract: We introduce a novel method for fabricating all-aluminum Josephson junctions with highly transmitted conduction channels. Such properties are typically associated with structures requiring intricate fabrication processes, such as atomic contacts or hybrid junctions based on semiconducting nanowires and 2D materials. In contrast, our approach relies solely on standard nanofabrication techniques. The resulting devices exhibit a key signature of high-transmission junctions - Multiple Andreev Reflections (MAR) - in their current-voltage characteristics. Furthermore, we propose a straightforward superconducting circuit design based on these junctions, enabling the implementation of a parity-protected qubit.

Title: Topological classification and edge states of magnons in honeycomb ferromagnets
Authors: Youwen wang, Qiutong Wang, Qingjun Tong, Ci Li
Abstract: We study the topological classification and related edge states of magnons in ferromagnets on honeycomb that can be described by a class of single-particle bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) models. Both single layer and bilayer situations are considered. The calculations show that the existence and related topologies of these edge states are well captured by a class of non-Hermitian single or coupled Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains models H(ky) parameterized by momentum ky, where the edge states can appear as the ground state for some cases. Interestingly, although the eigenproblem of bosonic BdG models is equivalent to the one of non-Hermitian systems, the conventional bulkedge correspondence for Hermitian systems is partially valid. The influence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions between next nearest-neighbor spins are also discussed, which break the time-reversal symmetry and lead to a straight connection between edge states for magnonic systems and non-zero Chern number of non-Hermitian bulk two-dimensional systems.

Title: Universal Bound States with Bose-Fermi Duality in Microwave-Shielded Polar Molecules
Authors: Tingting Shi, Haitian Wang, Xiaoling Cui
Abstract: We investigate universal few-body bound states in microwave-shielded ultracold polar molecules. Under a highly elliptic microwave field, few-molecule scatterings in three dimension are shown to be governed by effective one-dimensional (1D) models. These models well reproduce the tetratomic (two-molecule) bound state and the Born-Oppenheimer potential in three-molecule sector. For hexatomic systems comprising three identical molecules, we find the lowest bound state emerge concurrently with tetratomic state, with binding energy exceeding twice of the latter. Strikingly, all these bound states display Bose-Fermi duality, i.e., they share identical energies and spatial densities in both bosonic and fermionic molecular systems. Universal features of these bound states are supported by the 1D nature of effective scattering and a large repulsive core in the reduced effective potential. For large molecule ensembles, our results suggest the formation of elongated self-bound droplets with crystalline patterns in both bosonic and fermionic polar molecules.

Title: Hierarchy of pairing in imbalanced three-component one-dimensional Fermi gas
Authors: Buğra Tüzemen, Tomasz Sowiński
Abstract: We study a one-dimensional, three-component Fermi gas with population imbalance using the Bogoliubov-de Gennes mean-field approach. We specifically consider pairing in two channels while deliberately excluding the third by setting its interaction strength to zero. By systematically varying the interaction strength and population imbalance, we identify a rich set of spatially modulated superfluid states, including structures akin to the Larkin-Ovchinnikov phase and phase-separated domains. A clear hierarchy emerges in the pairing behavior, shaped by the competition between the local density of states and the Fermi momentum mismatch. A fidelity-based analysis of the density further distinguishes smooth crossovers from sharp spatial reorganizations. Our results shed light on how pairing symmetry and population imbalance determine the structure of spatially inhomogeneous superfluid phases in multicomponent systems with reduced dimensionality.

Title: On persistent energy currents at equilibrium in non-reciprocal systems
Authors: Svend-Age Biehs, Ivan Latella
Abstract: We investigate the properties of the mean Poynting vector in global thermal equilibrium, which can be non-zero in non-reciprocal electromagnetic systems. Using dyadic Green's functions and the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, we provide a general proof that the mean Poynting vector is divergence-free under equilibrium conditions. Relying on this proof, we explicitly demonstrate that for systems where a normal mode expansion of the Green's function is applicable, the divergence of the equilibrium mean Poynting vector vanishes. As concrete examples, we also examine the equilibrium mean Poynting vector near a planar non-reciprocal substrate and in configurations involving an arbitrary number of dipolar non-reciprocal objects in free space. Finally, we argue that the so-called persistent heat current, while present in equilibrium, cannot be detected through out-of-equilibrium heat transfer measurements.

Title: Optimizing carrier balance in CsPbBr3 nanocrystal LEDs: The role of alkyl ligands and polar electron transport layers
Authors: Roshini Jayabalan, Girish K. Hanumantharaju, Theresa Hettiger, Arup Sarkar, Fengshuo Zu, Aladin Ullrich, Norbert Koch, Denis Andrienko, Marcus Scheele, Wolfgang Brütting
Abstract: The study of lead halide perovskite nanocrystal based light-emitting diodes (LEDs) has advanced significantly, with notable improvements in stability and optical properties. However, optimizing charge carrier injection and transport remains a challenge. Efficient electroluminescence requires a balanced transport of both holes and electrons within the emitting material. Here, we investigate cubic CsPbBr\textsubscript{3} nanocrystals passivated with oleylamine and oleic acid, comparing them to ligand-exchanged nanocrystals with didodecyldimethylammonium bromide (DDABr). Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy confirm successful ligand exchange, revealing reduced ligand coverage in DDABr-treated nanocrystals. Photoelectron spectroscopy, spectroelectrochemistry, and single-carrier devices indicate improved hole injection in DDABr-capped nanocrystals. Density functional theory calculations further reveal the influence of ligand type and coverage on energy levels, with oleic acid introducing localized states in native nanocrystals. Additionally, incorporation of a polar electron transport layer (ETL) enhances LED performance by over an order of magnitude in DDABr-capped nanocrystals, driven by improved charge balance arising from the spontaneous orientation polarization (SOP) of the ETL. These findings highlight the critical role of ligand selection, passivation degree, and charge transport control by the adjacent organic transport layers in optimizing LED efficiency.

Title: Theoretical modeling of synergistic effect of pores and grains on transmittance in transparent piezoelectric ceramics
Authors: Zixiang Xiong, Jian Zhu, Xueqian Geng, Zheng Wen, Yongcheng Zhang, Jianyi Liu
Abstract: Transparent piezoelectric ceramics (TPCs) have great application potential in electro-optical-mechanical multi-functional devices. Preparing high-performance TPCs, especially improving the transparency through microstructure regulation, has recently caused extensive discussion. However, there is still controversy about the influence of grains and pores on the transmittance of ceramics, and there is arbitrariness in the estimation of the theoretical transmittance limit. In this paper, taking PMN-PT-based ceramics as an example, theoretical mechanisms for the transmittance are discussed. An inhomogeneous reflection model is derived to improve the theoretical limit of transmittance. The effects of pores and grains scattering on transmittance are investigated. Rayleigh and RGD approximation are discussed to reveal the underlying scattering mechanisms. It is found that Rayleigh approximation is suitable for describing pore scattering, while RGD approximation is suitable for grain scattering. Thus, a Rayleigh-RGD combined model is proposed to describe light scattering in TPCs and successfully employed to fit experimentally measured transmittance curves.

Title: Fermionic Band Dispersions and an Evidence of Cooperon Excitations in a Spin-$1/2$ Trimer Chain
Authors: P. Srikanth Patnaik, Snehasish Sen, A. K. Bera, Sudhansu S. Mandal, Anushree Roy, S.M. Yusuf
Abstract: We obtain the solution of the Hamiltonian of an antiferromagnetically coupled spin-$1/2$ trimer chain in terms of three bands that host three different species of fermions. While the lowest two bands correspond to spin-$1/2$ fermions, the fermions in the highest band are of spin-$3/2$. Because the bands are for different species of fermions, the particle-hole excitation channel across the bands is closed. However, fractionalized excitations as spin-$1/2$ and spin-$3/2$ fermions in pairs open a cooperon channel of excitations in Raman scattering. The background spectral intensity profile obtained by Raman scattering measurements in Na$_2$Cu$_3$Ge$_4$O$_{12}$ having a trimer chain consisting of spin-$1/2$ Cu ions, has comprehensively been shown to be consistent with these excitations.

Title: Superconductivity and trimers on attractive-$U$ Hubbard ladders
Authors: Ian Pilé, Evgeni Burovski
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between superconducting correlations and trimer formation in polarized two-component Fermi gases confined to multileg attractive-$U$ Hubbard ladders. Employing density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we explore the effects of spin-dependent tunneling amplitudes on these systems. Specifically, we analyze how bound states of three fermions (trimers) impact Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superconducting correlations at commensurate charge carrier densities, where $2n_{\uparrow} = n_{\downarrow}$. In one-dimensional (1D) systems, trimer formation is known to suppress FFLO correlations exponentially. Our results demonstrate that this suppression persists on ladder lattices of small width, effectively mirroring the 1D behavior. However, we find a striking departure from the 1D regime as the ladder width increases. On ladders with a width of four legs, the influence of trimers on superconducting correlations becomes negligible, suggesting that wider ladder systems provide a distinct environment where FFLO-like pairing remains robust even in the presence of trimer states. These findings underscore the dimensional crossover in Hubbard systems and shed light on the mechanisms governing superconductivity and bound-state formation in strongly correlated fermionic systems. Our work has implications for understanding unconventional superconductivity in strongly correlated systems.

Title: Universal scaling law for quantum droplet formation
Authors: Ian G. Moss
Abstract: Given the right set of circumstances, ultracold quantum gases are able to change character and condense into a liquid state of quantum droplets. The size distribution of the droplets is determined dynamically in the condensation process. A semi-quantitative argument is presented which suggests that, at zero temperature, a multiple droplet system has is a preferred scale $\propto v^{-d}$, with $d\approx 0.5$, where $v$ is the rate of change of parameters at the time of droplet formation. Numerical simulations of two dimensional systems strongly support a power law, but with an exponent $d\in(0.3,0.4)$.

Title: Pressure and strain effects on the $\textit{ab initio}$ $GW$ electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$
Authors: Jean-Baptiste de Vaulx, Quintin N. Meier, Pierre Toulemonde, Andrés Cano, Valerio Olevano
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at a critical temperature above 80~K points to a non-conventional pairing mechanism in nickelates as in cuprates, possibly due to electronic correlations. We have calculated from first principles the electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under the effect of pressure and epitaxial strain including correlations by the $GW$ approximation to the many-body self-energy. We find that the Fermi surface is composed of a characteristic cuprate-shape sheet $\beta$ plus a nickelate-specific cylinder $\alpha$, both from Ni $e_g$ orbitals, with a non-negligible drop in the quasiparticle weight and an effective 1D character. This topology results from a delicate balance between the Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ hole pocket $\gamma$, which is suppressed by correlations, and an emerging La-5$d_{x^2-y^2}$ electron pocket induced by both correlation and pressure/strain effects and whose role at low energy has been neglected so far. Unlike cuprates, the electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is already correctly described from ab initio and in agreement with the experiment without the need to introduce Hubbard $U$ adjustable parameters or to invoke a strongly correlated physics.

Title: Effect of Magnetic Anisotropy and Gradient-Induced Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction on the Formation of Magnetic Skyrmions

Abstract: Topological spin textures (e.g. skyrmions) can be stabilized by interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in the magnetic multilayer, which has been intensively studied. Recently, Bloch-type magnetic skyrmions stabilized by composition gradient-induced DMI (g-DMI) have been observed in 10-nm thick CoPt single layer. However, magnetic anisotropy in gradient-composition engineered CoPt (g-CoPt) films is highly sensitive to both the relative Co/Pt composition and the film thickness, leading to a complex interplay with g-DMI. The stability of skyrmions under the combined influence of magnetic anisotropy and g-DMI is crucial yet remains poorly understood. Here, we conduct a systematic study on the characteristics of magnetic skyrmions as a function of gradient polarity and effective gradient strength (defined as gradient/thickness) in g-CoPt single layers (thickness of 10-30 nm) using magnetic force microscopy (MFM), bulk magnetometry, and topological Hall effect measurements. Brillouin light scattering confirms that both the sign and magnitude of g-DMI depend on the polarity and amplitude of the composition gradient in g-CoPt films. MFM reveals that skyrmion size and density vary with g-CoPt film thickness, gradient polarity, and applied magnetic field. An increased skyrmion density is observed in samples exhibiting higher magnetic anisotropy, in agreement with micromagnetic simulations and energy barrier calculations.

Title: Landau-Zener-Stückelberg spectroscopy of a fluxonium quantum circuit
Authors: Valentín Reparaz, María José Sánchez, Maximiliano Gatto, Daniel Dominguez, Leandro Tosi
Abstract: In this work, we study the time-averaged populations obtained for a fluxonium circuit under a large amplitude nonresonant periodic drive. We present numerical simulations of the time evolution which consider the multi-level structure of the driven quantum circuit, looking for a realistic modeling closer to experimental implementations. The Landau-Zener-Stückelberg spectra show resonances that can be understood as originated from constructive interference favoring transitions to higher levels. For a truncated two-level system (TLS) the resonance patterns can be interpreted using a simplified description of the avoided crossing that takes into account the dynamic phase accumulated at each operation point. For the multilevel case, we derive an effective two-level Hamiltonian using a Schrieffer-Wolff transformation starting from the Floquet Hamiltonian in the Sambe space. Our study provides predictive insight into experimental outcomes, offering an intuitive interpretation that could also support the implementation of fast-non-adiabatic single-qubit gates and entangling protocols.

Title: Characterization and optimization of heat engines: Pareto-optimal fronts and universal features
Authors: Gustavo A. L. Forão, Jonas Berx, Carlos E. Fiore
Abstract: Characterizing and optimizing nanoscopic heat engines require an appropriate understanding of the interplay between power, efficiency, entropy production and fluctuations. Despite significant recent advancements, including linear stochastic thermodynamics and thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs), a complete scenario remains elusive. In this work, we give a further step by showing that, under certain common and general conditions, the heat engine regime can be characterized by the minima of power fluctuations and entropy production, which together delimit its optimal performance, achieved when these conditions are fully satisfied. Conversely, when these conditions are not strictly met, the occurrence of the minimum still approximately describes the system, suggesting a broader range of applicability. Contrasting with most of studies in which the system optimization is carried out solely taking into account the power and efficiency, we introduce a multi-objective optimization framework based on Pareto fronts, also considering the role of fluctuation and dissipation. Our results reveal a general trend: while simultaneous optimization over a few parameters typically yields convex Pareto fronts, these fronts become concave as more parameters are varied freely and non-conservative driving becomes significant. Illustrating our findings, we consider simple two and three state systems as well as richer collective systems, exhibiting novel aspects of optimizations and protocol phase transitions.

Title: The role of terminal groups in non-chiral rod-like compounds on the formation of polar fluids
Authors: Michał Czerwiński, Mateusz Mrukiewicz, Mateusz Filipow, Damian Pociecha, Natalia Podoliak, Dalibor Repcek, Monika Zając, Dorota Węgłowska
Abstract: The emergence of ferroelectric mesophases in non-chiral liquid crystal (LCs) has sparked fundamental interest in the molecular mechanisms governing polarity. In this study, we investigate how terminal molecular groups influence the formation and stability of polar phases by analyzing six compounds from three homologous series. Specifically, we compare newly synthesized homologs with a nitro group, which predominantly exhibit polar mesophases, to previously reported structurally related analogs containing either a cyano group or a fluorine atom as terminal fragment. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations provide insights into electronic surface potential (ESP) distributions, revealing alternating regions of positive and negative charge density along the molecular axis, consistent with Madhusudana model of polar phase stabilization. We propose the ESP-derived parameter quantifying terminal electrostatic charge, revealing a direct correlation between the negative to positive charge ratio at the molecular termini and the formation of ferroelectric or antiferroelectric mesophases. To validate this hypothesis, we analyze the molecular structure-mesomorphic behavior relationship of other known non-chiral compounds that exhibit polar phases, demonstrating the critical role of terminal groups in determining mesophase polarity. Our findings enhance the understanding of the molecular origins of ferroelectricity in non-chiral LCs, paving the way for the rational design of next-generation functional polar soft materials.

Title: Observation of Intrinsic and LED Light-Enhanced Memristor Performance in In-Plane Ferroelectric NbOI2

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) layered ferroelectrics, as an emerging area of research, have attracted extensive attention, while memristors based on new 2D ferroelectric materials have yet to be fully explored, thereby limiting their applications in modern nanoelectronics. In this work, we report the observation of intrinsic memristive behavior in a newly discovered 2D in-plane ferroelectric material, NbOI2, and the giant enhancement of the memristive performance using LED visible light. The results show that NbOI2 exhibits intrinsically strong memristive response with a current on/off ratio of up to 10^4 and stable switching cycles, which is independent of back-gate voltage. Under LED visible light illumination, the current on/off ratio in NbOI2 is over one order of magnitude higher than that without light, meanwhile, the coercive field is significantly reduced to less than 1.22 kVcm-1, much lower than other 2D ferroelectric material-based memristors. Interestingly, both the intrinsic and the light-enhanced resistive switching phenomena only occur along the in-plane b-axis direction, indicating that the memristive behavior in NbOI2 is driven by electric field-induced and optical field-enhanced ferroelectric polarization switching mechanisms, as evidenced by a combined orientation-dependent electrical/optoelectrical measurement and sweep cycle-induced structural evolution analysis. Our study not only provides a materials strategy based on new 2D ferroelectrics for designing memristor applications, but also offers a simple optical method to enhance its performance, paving the path for its implementation in novel nanoelectronics and optoelectronics.

Title: Boundary effects in classical liquid density fluctuations at finite temperature
Authors: Herondy Mota, K. E. L. de Farias
Abstract: We investigate thermal effects on density fluctuations in confined classical liquids using phonon quantization. The system is modeled via a massless scalar field between perfectly reflecting parallel planes with Dirichlet, Neumann, and mixed boundary conditions. Exact closed-form expressions are derived for the mean square mass density, total energy density, and thermodynamic quantities including Helmholtz free energy and entropy densities. Our analysis identifies distinct regimes, namely, a low-temperature quantum regime exhibiting characteristic power-law behavior for each boundary condition, and a high-temperature classical regime where $\hbar$-independent behavior emerges as expected. A particularly interesting finding shows that while most quantities transition naturally to classical behavior, the mean square density fluctuation requires explicit consideration of the $\hbar\to 0$ limit. The entropy density vanishes at zero temperature, in agreement with the Nernst heat theorem. Numerical analysis confirms our analytical results, particularly the asymptotic temperature behaviors and the intermediate crossover region, in which quantum and classical effects compete. This regime is governed by the energy scale $k_B T \sim \hbar u / a$, where $a$ is the distance between the planes and $u$ is the sound velocity.

Title: Improved Lanczos Algorithm using Matrix Product States
Authors: Yu Wang, Zhangyu Yang, Christian B. Mendl
Abstract: We improve the Lanczos algorithm using the matrix product state representation proposed in Phys. Rev. B 85, 205119 (2012). As an alternative to the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), the Lanczos algorithm avoids local minima and can directly find multiple low-lying eigenstates. However, its performance and accuracy are affected by the truncation required to maintain the efficiency of the tensor network representation. In this work, we enhance its convergence by restarting with multiple states. We benchmark our method on one-dimensional instances of the Fermi-Hubbard model with 8 sites and the Heisenberg model with 16 sites in an external field, using numerical experiments targeting the first five lowest eigenstates. Across these tests, our approach obtains accuracy improvements of three to seven orders of magnitude. Finally, we extend the Heisenberg model simulation to a lattice with 30 sites to highlight its scalability.

Title: Vortex flow anisotropy in nematic superconductors
Authors: F. Castillo Menegotto, R. S. Severino, P. D. Mininni, E. Fradkin, V. Bekeris, G. Pasquini, G. S. Lozano
Abstract: We investigate the vortex flow anisotropy in the mixed state of nematic superconductors, focusing on the effects of nematic-superconducting coupling on vortex dynamics. Using numerical simulations within a time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) approach, we analyze vortex viscosity in a model featuring an s-wave superconducting order parameter coupled to an Ising-like nematic order parameter, suitable for systems with $C_4$ symmetry. Our results indicate that nematicity induces a significant anisotropy in the flux-flow resistivity, which depends on both vortex core shape anisotropy and normal-phase conductivity anisotropy. These two effects can either compete or cooperate with each other. We discuss the implications of these findings for identifying nematic superconductivity in the superconducting phase. Our work provides new insights into the interplay between nematic and superconducting order parameters, leading to new possibilities for experimental and theoretical exploration of anisotropic transport properties in unconventional superconductors.

Title: Anomalous Josephson effect in hybrid superconductor-hole systems
Authors: Peter D. Johannsen, Henry F. Legg, Stefano Bosco, Daniel Loss, Jelena Klinovaja
Abstract: We consider hybrid systems consisting of a hole-doped semiconductor coupled to electronic states of finite-size superconductors, where the opposite sign of the masses in the two subsystems give rise to insulating gaps at subband anticrossings. Consequently, increasing the coupling strength to the superconductor can paradoxically suppress the proximity-induced superconductivity in the semiconductor by enhancing these insulating gaps. We demonstrate that the presence of such induced insulating gaps leads to a characteristic anomalous behavior of the critical supercurrent in Josephson junctions based on these hybrid structures. Our findings provide important insights for the design of robust quantum computing platforms utilizing hybrid superconductor-hole systems.

Title: Two lock-in amplifiers based $3ω$ technique: a practical guide for thermal conductivity experiments in bulk samples
Authors: Alexandre Henriques, Murilo Santoma, Steffen Wirth, Julio Larrea Jiménez, Valentina Martelli
Abstract: The accurate determination of thermal conductivity $\kappa(T)$ in bulk materials is essential to assess their performance as candidates for specific applications. The 3$\omega$ technique is an established methodology for studying the thermal conductivity of thin films and becomes particularly suitable in the case of bulk specimens at room temperature and above, where standard stationary techniques require significant corrections for radiative losses. Although this method has been employed in several works, it remains not widely adopted because its implementation demands considerable sophistication, including experiment design, thin film deposition techniques and choices of the geometry of the current/heat transducer, electronics, and analytical treatment of the signals. This work reviews the technique's most crucial technical aspects, providing practical support for a quick and user-friendly implementation, from the design phase to the execution and analysis. We release a Python-based graphical user interface that supports a quick quantitative estimation of the investigated temperature profiles based on the geometrical parameters (width/length) of the deposited transducer (heater/thermometer metal line) before an experiment, guaranteeing an optimal engineering of the experimental conditions for each given material under scrutiny.

Title: Comment on 'Anomalies in the Electronic Stopping of Slow Antiprotons in LiF', arXiv:2501.14381
Authors: G. Schiwietz, P.L. Grande
Abstract: This work contains detailed discussions on the contents of Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 076401 (2025), in the following denoted PRL134. In this comment, we revisit and elaborate on the Adiabatic Ionization Model (AIM) for the energy loss of antiparticles in matter, with particular reference to its theoretical foundation as established previously. The AIM framework plays a central role in describing the ionization dynamics in the low-velocity regime considered by the authors of PRL134. Calculated AIM results for the energy loss of antiprotons in LiF crystals are compared to experimental data and different other models, pointing to severe problems of the PRL134 results. Beyond this specific comparative theoretical investigation, we critically examine several statements and assumptions made in PRL134. Certain claims presented therein appear to be inconsistent with established theoretical principles or are insufficiently justified by the data and arguments provided. As such, we believe that further clarification, and in some cases, a more rigorous justification, is necessary to substantiate those points.

Title: A Family of Self-Dual Quasicrystals with Critical Phases
Authors: Wenzhi Wang, Wei Yi, Tianyu Li
Abstract: We propose a general framework for constructing self-dual one-dimensional quasiperiodic lattice models with arbitrary-range hoppings and multifractal behaviors. Our framework generates a broad spectrum of quasicrystals, ranging from the off-diagonal Aubry-André-Harper models on one end, to those with long-range power-law hoppings on another. Focusing on models with off-diagonal quasiperiodic hoppings with power-law decay, we exploit the fact that, when the self-dual condition is satisfied, the system must be in the critical state with multifractal properties. This enables the engineering of models with competing extended, critical, and localized phases, with rich mobility edges in between. As an outstanding example, we show that a limiting case of our family of self-dual quasicrystals can be implemented using Rydberg-atom arrays. Our work offers a systematic route toward self-duality and critical phases, and would facilitate their experimental simulation.

Title: Is Entanglement Necessary for the Typicality Argument in Statistical Mechanics?

Abstract: Typicality arguments replace the postulated mixed state ensembles of statistical mechanics with pure states sampled uniformly at random, explaining why most microstates of large systems exhibit thermal behavior. This paradigm has been revived in quantum contexts, where entanglement is deemed essential, but no clear quantitative link between entanglement structure and typicality has been established. Here, we study pure quantum states with controlled multipartite entanglement and show that when entanglement grows with system size $N$, fluctuations in macroscopic observables decay exponentially with $N$, whereas if entanglement remains finite, one recovers only the classical $1/\sqrt{N}$ suppression. Our work thus provides a quantitative connection between entanglement structure and the emergence of typicality, demonstrating that entanglement is crucial for thermalization in small quantum systems but unnecessary to justify equilibrium in macroscopic ensembles. This unifies classical and quantum foundations of statistical mechanics by pinpointing exactly when and why entanglement matters.

Title: Confluent supersymmetric algorithm for bilayer graphene
Authors: Jonathan de la Cruz-Hernandez, David J. Fernández C.
Abstract: External magnetic field profiles leading to equidistant and partially equidistant bilayer graphene spectra within the tight-binding model are obtained. This is achieved by implementing the integral and differential versions of the second-order confluent algorithm to the harmonic oscillator for arbitrary real factorization energies. Additionally, new Barut-Girardello and Gilmore-Perelomov coherent states for bilayer graphene are derived, for both diagonal and non-diagonal ladder operators. Their time evolution is analyzed, finding temporal stability and cyclic evolution in some cases. This fact is contrasted with the non-cyclic evolution of bilayer graphene coherent states obtained when using two different factorization energies. Likewise, the geometric phase and uncertainty product of the quadratures for the previously obtained coherent states are studied.

Title: Geometric and Topological Aspects of Quadrupoles of Disclinations: Conformal Metrics and Self-Forces
Authors: A. M. de M. Carvalho, G. Q. Garcia, C. Furtado
Abstract: We study the geometric and physical effects of quadrupolar configurations of disclinations using a conformal metric approach in $(2+1)$ dimensions. Two cases are considered: a linear quadrupole, inducing anisotropic curvature with a $\cos(2\theta)$ as profile, and a square quadrupole, yielding a more isotropic field with higher angular harmonics. We solve the Poisson equation for the conformal factor and compute the corresponding Green functions. Using these configurations, we evaluated the electrostatic and magnetostatic self-energies and self-forces for linear sources. The results reveal how symmetry and curvature influence self-interaction effects, with the magnetostatic self-force exhibiting a sign reversal compared to the electrostatic case. Connections with previous models of dislocations and cosmic strings are discussed, with potential applications in graphene, nematics, and gravitational analogs.

Title: Kelvin-Wave-Inspired Optical Vortex Excitation in Kerr Nonlinear Media
Authors: Yosuke Minowa, Nobuhiko Yokoshi, Makoto Tsubota
Abstract: We demonstrate a direct one-to-one correspondence between nonlinear optical fields in defocusing Kerr media and wave functions in weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensates or quantum fluids. Based on this correspondence, we propose the existence of excitations in an optical vortex beam characterized by a helical deformation of its phase singularity core. These excitations are direct analogues of Kelvin waves known in quantum and classical fluid dynamics. We further show that the excitations exhibit two distinct branches, one of which includes a stationary solution. A feasible experimental scheme for generating these excitations is also discussed.

Title: Imperfect diffusion-controlled reactions on a torus and on a pair of balls
Authors: Denis S. Grebenkov
Abstract: We employ a general spectral approach based on the Steklov eigenbasis to describe imperfect diffusion-controlled reactions on bounded reactive targets in three dimensions. The steady-state concentration and the total diffusive flux onto the target are expressed in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the exterior Steklov problem. In particular, the eigenvalues are shown to provide the geometric lengthscales of the target that are relevant for diffusion-controlled reactions. Using toroidal and bispherical coordinates, we propose an efficient procedure for analyzing and solving numerically this spectral problem for an arbitrary torus and a pair of balls, respectively. A simple two-term approximation for the diffusive flux is established and validated. Implications of these results in the context of chemical physics and beyond are discussed.

Title: A Unified Variational Framework for Quantum Excited States
Authors: Shi-Xin Zhang, Lei Wang
Abstract: Determining quantum excited states is crucial across physics and chemistry but presents significant challenges for variational methods, primarily due to the need to enforce orthogonality to lower-energy states, often requiring state-specific optimization, penalty terms, or specialized ansatz constructions. We introduce a novel variational principle that overcomes these limitations, enabling the \textit{simultaneous} determination of multiple low-energy excited states. The principle is based on minimizing the trace of the inverse overlap matrix multiplied by the Hamiltonian matrix, $\mathrm{Tr}(\mathbf{S}^{-1}\mathbf{H})$, constructed from a set of \textit{non-orthogonal} variational states $\{|\psi_i\rangle\}$. Here, $\mathbf{H}_{ij} = \langle\psi_i | H | \psi_j\rangle$ and $\mathbf{S}_{ij} = \langle\psi_i | \psi_j\rangle$ are the elements of the Hamiltonian and overlap matrices, respectively. This approach variationally optimizes the entire low-energy subspace spanned by $\{|\psi_i\rangle\}$ without explicit orthogonality constraints or penalty functions. We demonstrate the power and generality of this method across diverse physical systems and variational ansatzes: calculating the low-energy spectrum of 1D Heisenberg spin chains using matrix product states, finding vibrational spectrum of Morse potential using quantics tensor trains for real-space wavefunctions, and determining excited states for 2D fermionic Hubbard model with variational quantum circuits. In all applications, the method accurately and simultaneously obtains multiple lowest-lying energy levels and their corresponding states, showcasing its potential as a unified and flexible framework for calculating excited states on both classical and quantum computational platforms.

Title: No Evidence of Anomalous Diffusion in Yukawa Crystals
Authors: Matthew E. Caplan, Dany Yaacoub
Abstract: Diffusion in Yukawa crystals is stochastic due to the thermally activated formation of vacancy-interstitial pairs, which have poor statistics in simulations. This makes it difficult to argue if Yukawa crystals exhibit normal diffusion, or if they could be subdiffusive or superdiffusive. To resolve this, we run a long molecular dynamics simulation of an idealized Yukawa crystal for a billion timesteps. We find no evidence of anomalous diffusion in the pure crystal, but also caution readers against overinterpreting this result as real crystals have complicated structures including grains and defects.

Title: Skin Effect Induced Anomalous Dynamics from Charge-Fluctuating Initial States
Authors: Sibo Guo, Shuai Yin, Shi-Xin Zhang, Zi-Xiang Li
Abstract: Non-equilibrium dynamics in non-Hermitian systems has attracted significant interest, particularly due to the skin effect and its associated anomalous phenomena. Previous studies have primarily focused on initial states with a definite particle number. Here, we present a systematic study of non-reciprocal quench dynamics in the pairing states with indefinite particle number. Our study uncovers a range of novel behaviors. Firstly, we demonstrate a universal tendency towards half-filling of particle density at late times. At early times for certain initial states, we observe a chiral wavefront in both particle number distribution and charge inflow, associated with a sharp decrease in particle number. Furthermore, we find that non-Hermiticity could enhance the growth of entanglement in the initial stages of evolution. In the intermediate time regime, the characteristic skin effect leads to particle accumulation on one side, leading to a pronounced reduction in entanglement entropy. Moreover, our results reveal the presence of the quantum Mpemba effect during the restoration of U(1) symmetry. Our findings open new avenues for exploring exotic dynamic phenomena in quantum many-body systems arising from the interplay of symmetry breaking and non-Hermiticity.

Title: Quantum Annealing Algorithms for Estimating Ising Partition Functions
Authors: Haowei Li, Zhiyuan Yao, Xingze Qiu
Abstract: Estimating partition functions of Ising spin glasses is crucial in statistical physics, optimization, and machine learning, yet remains classically intractable due to its #P-hard complexity. While Jarzynski's equality offers a theoretical approach, it becomes unreliable at low temperatures due to rare divergent statistical fluctuations. Here, we present a protocol that overcomes this limitation by synergizing reverse quantum annealing with tailored nonequilibrium initial distributions. Our method can dramatically suppress the estimator variance, achieving saturation in the low-temperature regime. Numerical benchmarks on the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass and the 3-SAT problem demonstrate that our protocol reduces scaling exponents by over an order of magnitude (e.g., from ~8.5 to ~0.5), despite retaining exponential system-size dependences. Crucially, our protocol circumvents stringent adiabatic constraints, making it feasible for near-term quantum devices like superconducting qubits, trapped ions, and Rydberg atom arrays. This work bridges quantum dynamics with computational complexity, offering a practical pathway to quantum advantage in spin glass thermodynamics and beyond.

Title: Steering reaction flux by coupling product channels
Authors: Dominik Dorer, Shinsuke Haze, Jing-Lun Li, José P. D'Incao, Eberhard Tiemann, Paul S. Julienne, Markus Deiß, Johannes Hecker Denschlag
Abstract: We demonstrate a method for controlling the outcome of an ultracold chemical few-body reaction by redirecting a tunable fraction of reaction flux from one selected product channel to another one. In the reaction, three ultracold atoms collide to form a diatomic molecule. This product molecule can be produced in various internal states, characterizing the different product channels of the reaction. Our scheme relies on the coupling between two such product channels at an avoided molecular energy level crossing in the presence of an external magnetic field. The degree of coupling can be set by the magnetic field strength and allows for a widely tunable flux control between the two channels. This scheme is quite general and also holds great promise for a large variety of chemical processes with diverse species, since molecular energy level crossings are ubiquitous in molecular systems and are often easily accessible by standard laboratory equipment.

Grigera, Stefania Melillo, Biagio Palmisano, Leonardo Parisi, Lorena Postiglione, Mara Riminucci, Francesco Saverio Rotondi
Abstract: Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), whose populations contain multipotent skeletal stem cells with relevant therapeutic applications, are known to produce very heterogeneous colonies upon in vitro culture, a trait that may severely hinder the clinical usefulness of BMSC-based therapies. Therefore, reaching a better insight on the nature of such heterogeneity, as well as on the factors determining it, is important. Here, by using time-lapse microscopy, we study the structure of N=28 human BMSC colonies from six donors, each colony derived from a single cell, and trace their lineage trees up to the seventh generation. We confirm the presence of very significant inter-colony and intra-colony heterogeneities, both in the topology of the lineages and in the replicative kinetics of the colonies. We also find that topology and kinetics are strongly correlated, consistent with the existence of regulating factors linking the sub-population of inactive cells, which uniquely determine a lineage's topology, and that of active cells, which are the sole responsible for the proliferation rate of the colony. Finally, we submit each colony to an entropy-based inheritance test, which measures the degree of non-random clustering of inactive cells within the same branches of the lineage, and find a clear signature of hereditary transmission of the probability of emergence of inactive cells in the largest majority of the experimental lineages.

Title: Anharmonic phonon renormalization and thermal transport in the type-I Ba$_{\rm 8}$Ga$_{\rm 16}$Sn$_{\rm 30}$ clathrate from first principles
Authors: Masato Ohnishi, Terumasa Tadano, Shinji Tsuneyuki, Junichiro Shiomi
Abstract: Effects of strong phonon anharmonicity of a type-I clathrate Ba$_{\rm 8}$Ga$_{\rm 16}$Sn$_{\rm 30}$ induced by quadruple-well potential of guest atoms were investigated. Phonon transport including coherent interbranch component was analyzed using a first-principles-based self-consistent phonon (SCP) theory that gives temperature-dependent harmonic interatomic force constants and by solving off-diagonal components of group velocity operator. Experimentally observed thermal conductivities have been reasonably reproduced by considering both lattice and electron contributions. Through the analysis with the SCP theory, we found that hardening of guest modes leads to an increase in lattice thermal conductivity at frequencies below those of framework-dominant flat modes (< 40 cm$^{\rm -1}$), which finally results in the slow decay and slight increase in the total lattice thermal conductivity with increasing temperature. Detailed analyses revealed that the increase in lattice thermal conductivity at low frequency is attributed to (a) the increase in group velocities of phonon modes located at frequencies below that of the flat guest modes and (b) abnormal increase in lifetimes of phonon modes located between frequencies of the flat guest and framework modes with increasing temperature. From an engineering point of view, this effect may lead to an intriguing phenomenon, a larger decrease in thermal conductivity due to nanostructuring at higher temperatures.

Title: H-theorem at negative temperature: the random exchange model with bounds
Authors: Dario Lucente, Marco Baldovin, Andrea Puglisi, Angelo Vulpiani
Abstract: Random exchange kinetic models are widely employed to describe the conservative dynamics of large interacting systems. Due to their simplicity and generality, they are quite popular in several fields, from statistical mechanics to biophysics and economics. Here we study a version where bounds on the individual shares of the globally conserved quantity are introduced. We analytically show that this dynamics allows stationary states with population inversion, described by Boltzmann statistics at negative absolute temperature if the conserved quantity has the physical meaning of an energy. The proposed model provides therefore a privileged system for the study of thermalization toward a negative temperature state. First, the genuine equilibrium nature of the stationary state is verified by checking the detailed balance condition. Then, an H-theorem is proven, ensuring that such equilibrium condition is reached by a monotonic increase of the Boltzmann entropy. We also provide analytical and numerical evidence that a large intruder in contact with the system thermalizes, suggesting a practical way to design a thermal bath at negative temperature.

Title: Hidden vibrational bistability revealed by intrinsic fluctuations of a carbon nanotube
Authors: P. Belardinelli, W. Yang, A. Bachtold, M.I. Dykman, F. Alijani
Abstract: We demonstrate that a quiet state and large-amplitude self-sustained oscillations can co-exist in a carbon nanotube subject to time-independent drive. A feature of the bistability is that it would be hysteresis-free in the absence of noise and the oscillatory state would not be seen. It is revealed by random switching between the stable states, which we observe in the time domain. We attribute the switching to fluctuations in the system and show that it displays Poisson statistics. We propose a minimalistic model that relates the emergence of the bistability to a non-monotonic variation of nonlinear friction with the vibration amplitude. This new type of dynamical regime and the means to reveal it are generic and are of interest for various mesoscopic vibrational systems.

Title: Universal contributions to charge fluctuations in spin chains at finite temperature
Authors: Kang-Le Cai, Meng Cheng
Abstract: At finite temperature, conserved charges undergo thermal fluctuations in a quantum many-body system in the grand canonical ensemble. The full structure of the fluctuations of the total U(1) charge $Q$ can be succinctly captured by the generating function $G(\theta)=\left\langle e^{i \theta Q}\right\rangle$. For a 1D translation-invariant spin chain, in the thermodynamic limit the magnitude $|G(\theta)|$ scales with the system size $L$ as $\ln |G(\theta)|=-\alpha(\theta)L+\gamma(\theta)$, where $\gamma(\theta)$ is the scale-invariant contribution and may encode universal information about the underlying system. In this work we investigate the behavior and physical meaning of $\gamma(\theta)$ when the system is periodic. We find that $\gamma(\theta)$ only takes nonzero values at isolated points of $\theta$, which is $\theta=\pi$ for all our examples. In two exemplary lattice systems we show that $\gamma(\pi)$ takes quantized values when the U(1) symmetry exhibits a specific type of 't Hooft anomaly with other symmetries. In other cases, we investigate how $\gamma(\theta)$ depends on microscopic conditions (such as the filling factor) in field theory and exactly solvable lattice models.

Title: Inferring the Langevin Equation with Uncertainty via Bayesian Neural Networks
Authors: Youngkyoung Bae, Seungwoong Ha, Hawoong Jeong
Abstract: Pervasive across diverse domains, stochastic systems exhibit fluctuations in processes ranging from molecular dynamics to climate phenomena. The Langevin equation has served as a common mathematical model for studying such systems, enabling predictions of their temporal evolution and analyses of thermodynamic quantities, including absorbed heat, work done on the system, and entropy production. However, inferring the Langevin equation from observed trajectories is a challenging problem, and assessing the uncertainty associated with the inferred equation has yet to be accomplished. In this study, we present a comprehensive framework that employs Bayesian neural networks for inferring Langevin equations in both overdamped and underdamped regimes. Our framework first provides the drift force and diffusion matrix separately and then combines them to construct the Langevin equation. By providing a distribution of predictions instead of a single value, our approach allows us to assess prediction uncertainties, which can help prevent potential misunderstandings and erroneous decisions about the system. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in inferring Langevin equations for various scenarios including a neuron model and microscopic engine, highlighting its versatility and potential impact.

Title: Non Linear Hall Effects induced by Berry Curvature Dipole in CuPb$_9$(PO$_4$)$_6$O
Authors: Bishnu Karki, Kai Chen, Pavan Hosur
Abstract: The nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE), an emergent response in systems with broken inversion symmetry, provides a powerful tool for probing topological transport properties. In this context, we investigate copper-substituted lead apatite (LK-99), a material that initially garnered attention for its controversial claim of room-temperature superconductivity. Despite the unresolved nature of its superconducting properties, LK-99's unique electronic structure featuring flat bands near the Fermi level and broken inversion symmetry makes it a promising candidate for exploring Berry curvature-driven phenomena such as the NLHE. Using first-principles density functional theory and a refined tight-binding Hamiltonian model, we investigate LK-99's band topology and transport properties. Our calculations reveal that LK-99 hosts Weyl points near the Fermi level, which contribute significantly to Berry curvature. The inclusion of spin-orbit coupling further splits these bands, generating additional Weyl points and enhancing the Berry curvature distribution. Crucially, the absence of inversion symmetry in LK-99 leads to a net Berry curvature dipole, producing a nonlinear Hall current that scales quadratically with the applied electric field. Moreover, we demonstrate that the NLHE in LK-99 can be tuned by varying the direction of the applied electric field, underscoring its potential as a versatile platform for exploring topological transport phenomena and designing next-generation nonlinear electronic devices.

Title: Driven Critical Dynamics in Strongly Interacting Dirac Systems
Authors: Zhi Zeng, Yin-Kai Yu, Zhi-Xuan Li, Zi-Xiang Li, Shuai Yin
Abstract: The conventional Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) and finite-time scaling (FTS) provide universal descriptions of the driven critical dynamics from gapped initial states based on the adiabatic-impulse scenario. In this paper, by leveraging the large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we investigate the driven critical dynamics in two-dimensional Dirac systems, which harbor semimetal and Mott insulator phases separated by the quantum critical point (QCP) triggered by the interplay between fluctuations of gapless Dirac fermions and order parameter bosons. A remarkable discovery is that, despite the existence of the gapless initial phase, the driven dynamics can still be captured by the FTS form. This leads us to propose a generalized criterion for the validity of KZM and FTS with a gapless initial state. Accordingly, our results significantly generalize the KZM theory to incorporate composite fluctuations and relax its requirement for a gapped initial state to systems accommodating gapless Dirac fermionic excitations. Through successfully extending the KZM and FTS theory to the strongly interacting Dirac QCP, our work not only brings new fundamental perspective into the nonequilibrium critical dynamics, but also provides a novel theoretical approach to fathom quantum critical properties in fermionic systems.

Title: Diffusive contact between randomly driven colloidal suspensions
Authors: Galor Geva, Tamir Admon, Maayan Levin, Yael Roichman
Abstract: We study the relaxation process of two driven colloidal suspensions in diffusive contact to a steady state, similar to thermalization. We start by studying a single suspension, subjecting it to random driving forces via holographic optical tweezers, which agitate it to a higher effective temperature. Interestingly, the effective temperature of the suspension, defined by the Einstein relation, exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the driving frequency. Next, we follow the flux of particles between two such suspensions in diffusive contact, starting from a uniform density and relaxing to a state with zero net particle flux. The density remains uniform for systems with different frequencies but equal effective temperatures. At high driving frequencies, we show that the density distribution at steady state is determined by equating the ratio of the chemical potential to the effective temperature in both systems, mirroring thermal equilibrium behavior.

Abstract: A system that possesses translational symmetry but breaks orientational symmetry is known as a nematic phase. While there are many examples of nematic phases in a wide range of contexts, such as in liquid crystals, complex oxides, and superconductors, of particular interest is the magnetic analogue, where the spin, charge, and orbital degrees of freedom of the electron are intertwined. The difficulty of spin nematics is the unambiguous realization and characterization of the phase. Here we present an entirely new type of magnetic nematic phase, which replaces the basis of individual spins with magnetic helices. The helical basis allows for the direct measurement of the order parameters with soft X-ray scattering and a thorough characterization of the nematic phase and its thermodynamic transitions. We discover two distinct nematic phases with unique spatio-temporal correlation signatures. Using coherent X-ray methods, we find that near the phase boundary between the two nematic phases, fluctuations coexist on the timescale of both seconds and sub-nanoseconds. Additionally, we have determined that the fluctuations occur simultaneously with a reorientation of the magnetic helices, indicating that there is spontaneous symmetry breaking and new degrees of freedom become available. Our results provide a novel framework for characterizing exotic phases and the phenomena presented can be mapped onto a broad class of physical systems.

Title: Three-dimensional fracton topological orders with boundary Toeplitz braiding
Authors: Bo-Xi Li, Yao Zhou, Peng Ye
Abstract: In this paper, we theoretically study a class of 3D non-liquid states that show exotic boundary phenomena in the thermodynamical limit. More concretely, we focus on a class of 3D fracton topological orders formed via stacking 2D twisted \(\mathbb{Z}_N\) topologically ordered layers along \(z\)-direction. Nearby layers are coupled while maintaining translation symmetry along \(z\) direction. The effective field theory is given by the infinite-component Chern-Simons (iCS) field theory, with an integer-valued symmetric block-tridiagonal Toeplitz \(K\)-matrix whose size is thermodynamically large. With open boundary conditions (OBC) along \(z\), certain choice of \(K\)-matrices exhibits exotic boundary ``Toeplitz braiding'', where the mutual braiding phase angle between two anyons at opposite boundaries oscillates and remains non-zero in the thermodynamic limit. In contrast, in trivial case, the mutual braiding phase angle decays exponentially to zero in the thermodynamical limit. As a necessary condition, this phenomenon requires the existence of boundary zero modes in the \(K\)-matrix spectrum under OBC. We categorize nontrivial \(K\)-matrices into two distinct types. Each type-I possesses two boundary zero modes, whereas each type-II possesses only one boundary zero mode. Interestingly, the integer-valued Hamiltonian matrix of the familiar 1D ``Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model'' can be used as a non-trivial $K$ matrix. Importantly, since large-gauge-invariance ensures integer quantized \(K\)-matrix entries, global symmetries are not needed to protect these zero modes. We also present numerical simulation as well as finite size scaling, further confirming the above analytical results. Symmetry fractionalization in iCS field theory is also briefly discussed. Motivated by the present field-theoretical work, it will be interesting to ... ....

Title: Single Crystal Diffuse Neutron Scattering Study of the Dipole-Octupole Quantum Spin Ice Candidate Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$: No Apparent Octupolar Correlations Above $T = 0.05$ K
Authors: E. M. Smith, R. Schäfer, J. Dudemaine, B. Placke, B. Yuan, Z. Morgan, F. Ye, R. Moessner, O. Benton, A. D. Bianchi, B. D. Gaulin
Abstract: The insulating magnetic pyrochlore Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ has gained attention as a quantum spin ice candidate with dipole-octupole character arising from the crystal electric field ground state doublet for the Ce$^{3+}$ ion. This permits both spin ice phases based on magnetic dipoles and those based on more-exotic octupoles. We report low-temperature neutron diffraction measurements on single crystal Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ with $Q$-coverage both at low $Q$ where the magnetic form factor for dipoles is near maximal and at high $Q$ where the magnetic form factor for Ce$^{3+}$ octupoles is near maximal. This study was motivated by recent powder neutron diffraction studies of other Ce-based dipole-octupole pyrochlores, Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$ and Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$, which each showed temperature-dependent diffuse diffraction at high $Q$ that was interpreted as arising from octupolar correlations. Our measurements use an optimized single crystal diffuse scattering instrument that allows us to screen against strong Bragg scattering from Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$. The temperature-difference neutron diffraction reveals a low-$Q$ peak consistent with dipolar spin ice correlations reported in previous work, and an alternation between positive and negative net intensity at higher $Q$. These features are consistent with our numerical-linked-cluster calculations using pseudospin interaction parameters previously reported for Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$, Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$, and Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$. Importantly, neither the measured data nor any of the NLC calculations show evidence for increased scattering at high $Q$ resulting from octupolar correlations. We conclude that at the lowest attainable temperature for our measurements ($T = 0.05$ K), scattering from octupolar correlations in Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ is not present in the neutron diffraction signal on the level of our observation threshold of ~ 0.1 % of the low-$Q$ dipole scattering.

Title: Spin texture and tunneling magnetoresistance in atomically thin CrSBr
Authors: Ziqi Liu, Yichang Sun, Chengfeng Zhu, Canyu Hong, Yuchen Gao, Zeyuan Sun, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Shiwei Wu, Zuxin Chen, Pingfan Gu, Yu Ye
Abstract: The exploration of spin configurations and magnetoresistance in van der Waals magnetic semiconductors, particularly in the realm of thin-layer structures, is of paramount significance for the development of two-dimensional spintronic nanodevices. In this letter, we present detailed magneto-transport and photoluminescence studies on few-layer CrSBr flakes utilizing a vertical tunneling device configuration. Our investigations revealed complex magnetic states along the evolutionary path of few-layer CrSBr. We observed intermediate states exhibiting identical net magnetization demonstrate rectification properties, reminiscent of a diode-like behavior at positive and negative bias voltages. Notably, in devices with 5-layer CrSBr, we detected an intriguing positive magnetoresistive state when subjected to an in-plane magnetic field along the b-axis. The implementation of the Mott two-current model successfully calculated the tunneling resistance of different magnetic states, thereby elucidating the spin configurations responsible for the observed transport phenomena. These insights not only provide new perspectives on the intricate spin textures of two-dimensional CrSBr but also highlight the efficacy of tunneling measurements as a sensitive method for probing magnetic order in van der Waals materials.

Title: Tailoring asymmetry for anisotropic friction in kirigami metamaterial skins with pop-up folding hinges
Authors: Hamid Reza Tohidvand, Alexis White, Ali Khosravi, Paolo Celli
Abstract: Kirigami metamaterial sheets and tubes, owing to their capacity to undergo large elastic deformations while developing three-dimensional surface textures, have enormous potential as skins for soft robots. Here, we propose to use kirigami skins with folding hinges in this same context. These recently-introduced kirigami feature counter-rotating panels connected by pop-up folding hinges. So far, researchers have only explored auxetic and highly-symmetric versions of such patterns. Yet, some of these attributes have to be relaxed in order to explore their full potential as robotic skins. Thus, we parameterize these patterns and relax symmetry constraints, with the goal of using this same platform to obtain a wide range of shape-morphing behaviors. We derive kinematic formulas to explore the vast symmetry-enabled design space. We then use numerical simulations and experiments to validate the kinematic predictions and to explore the morphing mechanics of tubular skins. Finally, via experiments, we provide preliminary evidence of the anisotropic friction enabled by patterns with asymmetric pop-ups. We therefore demonstrate that it is possible to tailor parameters in kirigami with folding hinges to obtain skins that globally expand or contract due to axial elongation, and that present asymmetric pop-ups that yield anisotropic friction -- the most desired attribute for one-way locomotion of soft robots.

Title: Active Transport of Cargo-Carrying and Interconnected Chiral Particles
Authors: Bhavesh Valecha, Hossein Vahid, Pietro Luigi Muzzeddu, Jens-Uwe Sommer, Abhinav Sharma
Abstract: Directed motion up a concentration gradient is crucial for the survival and maintenance of numerous biological systems, such as sperms moving towards an egg during fertilization or ciliates moving towards a food source. In these systems, chirality - manifested as a rotational torque - plays a vital role in facilitating directed motion. While systematic studies of active molecules in activity gradients exist, the effect of chirality remains little studied. In this study, we examine the simplest case of a chiral active particle connected to a passive particle in a spatially varying activity field. We demonstrate that this minimal setup can exhibit rich emergent tactic behaviors, with the chiral torque serving as the tuning parameter. Notably, when the chiral torque is sufficiently large, even a small passive particle enables the system to display the desired accumulation behavior. Our results further show that in the dilute limit, this desired accumulation behavior persists despite the presence of excluded volume effects. Additionally, interconnected chiral active particles exhibit emergent chemotaxis beyond a critical chain length, with trimers and longer chains exhibiting strong accumulation at sufficiently high chiral torques. This study provides valuable insights into the design principles of hybrid bio-molecular devices of the future.

Title: Long-range angular correlations of particle displacements at a plastic-to-elastic transition in jammed amorphous solids
Authors: Yang Fu, Yuliang Jin, Deng Pan, Itamar Procaccia
Abstract: Understanding how a flow turns into an amorphous solid is a fundamental challenge in statistical physics, during which no apparent structural ordering appears. In the athermal limit, the two states are connected by a well-defined jamming transition, near which the solid is marginally stable. A recent mechanical response screening theory proposes an additional transition above jamming, called a plastic-to-elastic transition here, separating anomalous and quasi-elastic mechanical behavior. Through numerical inflation simulations in two dimensions, we show that the onsets of long-range radial and angular correlations of particle displacements decouple, occurring respectively at the jamming and plastic-to-elastic transitions. The latter is characterized by a power-law diverging correlation angle and a power-law spectrum of the displacements along a circle. This work establishes two-step transitions on the mechanical properties during ``decompression melting'' of an athermal over-jammed amorphous solid, reminiscent of the two-step structural melting of a crystal in two dimensions. In contradistinction with the latter, the plastic-to-elastic transition exists also in three dimensions.

Title: Strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking meets average symmetry-protected topological order
Authors: Yuchen Guo, Shuo Yang
Abstract: Recent studies have unveiled new possibilities for discovering intrinsic quantum phases that are unique to open systems, including phases with average symmetry-protected topological (ASPT) order and strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB) order in systems with global symmetry. In this work, we propose a new class of phases, termed the double ASPT phase, which emerges from a nontrivial extension of these two orders. This new phase is absent from prior studies and cannot exist in conventional closed systems. Using the recently developed imaginary-Lindbladian formalism, we explore the phase diagram of a one-dimensional open system with $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\sigma}\times \mathbb{Z}_2^{\tau}$ symmetry. We identify universal critical behaviors along each critical line and observe the emergence of an intermediate phase that completely breaks the $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\sigma}$ symmetry, leading to the formation of two triple points in the phase diagram. These two triple points are topologically distinct and connected by a domain-wall decoration duality map. Our results promote the establishment of a complete classification for quantum phases in open systems with various symmetry conditions.

Title: Electron-mediated anharmonicity and its role in the Raman spectrum of graphene
Authors: Nina Girotto Erhardt, Aloïs Castellano, J. P. Alvarinhas Batista, Raffaello Bianco, Ivor Lončarić, Matthieu J. Verstraete, Dino Novko
Abstract: The Raman active G mode in graphene exhibits strong coupling to electrons, yet the comprehensive treatment of this interaction in the calculation of its temperature-dependent Raman spectrum remains incomplete. In this study, we calculate the temperature dependence of the G mode frequency and linewidth, and successfully explain the experimental trend, by accounting for the contributions arising from the first-order electron-phonon coupling, electron-mediated phonon-phonon coupling, and standard lattice anharmonicity. The generality of our approach enables its broad applicability to study phonon dynamics in materials where both electron-phonon coupling and anharmonicity are important.

Title: Pressure-Induced Superconductivity at 18.2 K in CuIr2S4

Abstract: Attaining superconducting critical temperatures (Tc) beyond the limit around 14 K observed thus far in spinel compounds AB2X4 (A, B = transition metals, X = O/chalcogen) could elucidate interaction intricacies and inform materials design. This work spotlights CuIr2S4, which exhibits a distinct metal-insulator transition below 230 K, as an unconventional candidate for activation under high pressure. Through transport, diffraction, and spectroscopy experiments conducted at pressures up to 224 GPa, we unveil pressure-tuning that suppressed CuIr2S4's transition, yielding two superconducting phases with an un-precedented Tc for spinels. Initially, 3.8 K onset rose monotonically, reaching 18.2 K at 133 GPa. Unexpectedly, a distinct phase with Tc = 2.2 K distinctly emerged at higher pressures, intimating unconventional couplings. Our findings suggest that both geometric frustration and electron-electron interactions play crucial roles in the superconductivity observed in CuIr2S4. The findings stretch perceived temperature limits in spinels and provide structure-property insights to guide the optimiza-tion of quantum materials interactions for tailored targeted functionalities.

Title: Quantum Geometric Kohn-Luttinger Superconductivity
Authors: Gal Shavit, Jason Alicea
Abstract: Coulomb repulsion can, counterintuitively, mediate Cooper pairing via the Kohn-Luttinger mechanism. However, it is commonly believed that observability of the effect requires special circumstances -- e.g., vicinity of the Fermi level to van Hove singularities, significant lattice-induced band distortions, or non-trivial Fermi surface topologies. Here we establish that quantum geometric properties of the constituent electrons can dramatically promote pairing from repulsion via dependence of screening on the quantum metric. We demonstrate quantum-geometry-enhanced superconductivity in two microscopic models with tunable quantum geometry, highlighting the crucial roles of quantum metric anisotropy and inhomogeneity. Our analysis provides an experimentally accessible figure of merit for the importance of quantum geometry to inducing unconventional superconductivity, indicating its relevance to graphene multilayers.

Title: Slow, Nanometer Light Confinement Observed in Atomically Thin TaS2
Authors: Hue T.B. Do, Meng Zhao, Pengfei Li, Yu Wei Soh, Jagadesh Rangaraj, Bingyan Liu, Tianyu Jiang, Xinyue Zhang, Jiong Lu, Peng Song, Jinghua Teng, Michel Bosman
Abstract: Extreme light confinement down to the atomic scale has been theoretically predicted for ultrathin, Ta-based transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). In this work, we experimentally demonstrate in 2H-TaS$_2$ monolayers and bilayers a lateral confinement ratio up to 300 at large wave vectors of $q = 0.15 \, Å^{-1}$, and slow light behaviour with a group velocity $\sim 10^{-4}c$. Quantitative momentum-resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy (q-EELS) with a momentum resolution of $0.0056 \, Å^{-1}$ was used as a platform for the nanoscale optical measurements. With it, momentum-dispersed, two-dimensional (2D) plasmon resonances were experimentally observed, showing a transition from 2D to 3D Coulomb interaction in the high-momentum regime, equivalent to light confinement volumes of $1\text{-}2 \, \text{nm}^3$. Remarkably, the resonant modes do not enter the electron-hole continuum, predicting even further enhanced optical field confinements for this material at cryogenic temperatures.

Title: Nonlinear Terahertz Resonances from Ballistic Electron Funnelling
Authors: Hue T.B. Do, Gregory K. Ngirmang, Wu Lin, Michel Bosman
Abstract: We introduce a new mechanism for second-harmonic generation through geometrically rectifying-funneling-ballistic electrons in THz optical resonators. Our resonant rectifiers inherently act as second-order harmonic generators, rectifying currents without the presence of a potential barrier. Particle-in-cell simulations reveal that femtosecond electron-surface scattering plays a critical role in this process. We differentiate electron funneling from nonlocal plasmonic drag and bulk Dirac anharmonicity, showing that funneling can reduce the required field intensity for second-harmonic generation by 3-4 orders of magnitude. We provide design guidelines for generating funneling-induced second-harmonic generation, including resonance mode matching and materials selection. This approach offers a practical pathway for low-field, geometrically tunable THz upconversion and rectification, operating from sub-10 THz to multiple tens of THz in graphene.

Title: A Density Functional Theory Study of Magnetic Transition in MnO2 adsorbed Vanadium Carbide (V$_2$C) MXene
Authors: Mahjabeen Fatima, Saleem Ayaz Khan, Syed Rizwan
Abstract: The work reports nonmagnetic behavior (0.04 $\mu$B) in two-dimensional (2D) V2C-OF MXene and ferromagnetism in MnO$_2$ adsorbed V2C-OF MXene. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to study the magnetic moments of V$_2$C-OF and MnO$_2$@V$_2$C-OF MXene. The MXene, which is derived from the exfoliation of its parent V$_2$AlC MAX phase, shows a good potential to be a ferromagnetic when MnO$_2$ is adsorbed on it. The V$_2$C MXene and MnO$_2$ adsorbed V$_2$C MXene were successfully synthesized, as characterized using X-ray diffraction, showing an increased c-lattice parameter from 22.6Å to 27.2Å after MnO$_2$ adsorption. The DFT study confirmed that MnO$_2$ adsorbed V$_2$C MXene changed from nonmagnetic (in V$_2$C MXene) to a strong ferromagnetic with a magnetic moment of 4.48$\mu$B for Mn adsorbed V$_2$C-OF MXene. The current work is a step-forward towards understanding of magnetism in two-dimensional materials for future 2D spintronics.

Title: Exact joint distributions of three global characteristic times for Brownian motion
Authors: Alexander K. Hartmann, Satya N. Majumdar
Abstract: We consider three global characteristic times for a one-dimensional Brownian motion $x(\tau)$ in the interval $\tau\in [0,t]$: the occupation time $t_{\rm o}$ denoting the cumulative time where $x(\tau)>0$, the time $t_{\rm m}$ at which the process achieves its global maximum in $[0,t]$ and the last-passage time $t_l$ through the origin before $t$. All three random variables have the same marginal distribution given by Lévy's arcsine law. We compute exactly the pairwise joint distributions of these three times and show that they are quite different from each other. The joint distributions display rather rich and nontrivial correlations between these times. Our analytical results are verified by numerical simulations.

Title: Out-of-time-order correlator computation based on discrete truncated Wigner approximation
Authors: Tatsuhiko Shirai, Takashi Mori
Abstract: We propose a method based on the discrete truncated Wigner approximation (DTWA) for computing out-of-time-order correlators. This method is applied to long-range interacting quantum spin systems where the interactions decay as a power law with distance. As a demonstration, we use a squared commutator of local operators and its higher-order extensions that describe quantum information scrambling under Hamilton dynamics. Our results reveal that the DTWA method accurately reproduces the exact dynamics of the average spreading of quantum information (i.e., the squared commutator) across all time regimes in strongly long-range interacting systems. We also identify limitations in the DTWA method when capturing dynamics in weakly long-range interacting systems and the fastest spreading of quantum information. Then we apply the DTWA method to investigate the system-size dependence of the scrambling time in strongly long-range interacting systems. We reveal that the scaling behavior of the scrambling time for large system sizes qualitatively changes depending on the interaction range. This work provides and demonstrates a new technique to study scrambling dynamics in long-range interacting quantum spin systems

Title: Aspects of the normal state resistivity of cuprate superconductors Bi2201, Tl2201 and Hg1201
Authors: Samantha Shears, Michael Arciniaga, B Sriram Shastry
Abstract: Planar normal state resistivity data from two families of hole doped single layer cuprate superconductors $Bi2201$ (Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CuO$_{6+x}$) and $Tl2201$ (Tl$_2$Ba$_2$CuO$_{6+x}$) are calculated using the extremely correlated Fermi liquid theory (ECFL). This theory was recently employed for understanding the three families of single layer cuprate superconductors LSCO, BSLCO and NCCO. Adding these two systems accounts for essentially all single layer compounds where data is available for a range of densities and temperatures. The added case of $Bi2201$ is of particular interest since it was the original system where the almost linear in temperature resistivity was reported in 1990, and has been followed up by a systematic doping analysis only recently in 2022. The $Tl2201$ system has two distinct set of band parameters that fit the same Fermi surface, providing new challenges and insights into the ECFL theory.

Title: Variational Scarring in Open Two-Dimensional Quantum Dots
Authors: Fartash Chalangari, Joonas Keski-Rahkonen, Simo Selinummi, Esa Räsänen
Abstract: Quantum scars have recently been directly visualized in graphene quantum dots (Nature 635, 841 (2024)), revealing their resilience and influence on electron dynamics in mesoscopic systems. Here, we examine variational scarring in two-dimensional quantum dots and demonstrate that these states remain robust even in an open system. We show that controlled perturbations enable modulation of electronic transmission via scarred states, presenting a viable approach to tuning quantum transport. These findings provide insights into the role of scarring in mesoscopic transport and open pathways for experimental realization in quantum devices.

Title: WyckoffDiff -- A Generative Diffusion Model for Crystal Symmetry
Authors: Filip Ekström Kelvinius, Oskar B. Andersson, Abhijith S. Parackal, Dong Qian, Rickard Armiento, Fredrik Lindsten
Abstract: Crystalline materials often exhibit a high level of symmetry. However, most generative models do not account for symmetry, but rather model each atom without any constraints on its position or element. We propose a generative model, Wyckoff Diffusion (WyckoffDiff), which generates symmetry-based descriptions of crystals. This is enabled by considering a crystal structure representation that encodes all symmetry, and we design a novel neural network architecture which enables using this representation inside a discrete generative model framework. In addition to respecting symmetry by construction, the discrete nature of our model enables fast generation. We additionally present a new metric, Fréchet Wrenformer Distance, which captures the symmetry aspects of the materials generated, and we benchmark WyckoffDiff against recently proposed generative models for crystal generation.

Title: Square skyrmion lattice in multiorbital $f$-electron systems
Authors: Yan Zha, Satoru Hayami
Abstract: We report the emergence of a square-shaped skyrmion lattice in multi-orbital $f$-electron systems with easy-axis magnetic anisotropy on a centrosymmetric square lattice. By performing mean-field calculations for an effective localized model consisting of two Kramers doublets, we construct the low-temperature phase diagram in a static external magnetic field. Consequently, we find that a square-shaped skyrmion lattice with the skyrmion number of one appears in the intermediate-field region when the crystal field splitting between the two doublets is small. Furthermore, we identify another double-$Q$ state with a nonzero net scalar chirality at zero- and low-field regions, which is attributed to the help of the multi-orbital degree of freedom. Our results offer another route to search for skyrmion-hosting materials in centrosymmetric $f$-electron tetragonal systems with multi-orbital degrees of freedom, e.g., Ce-based compounds. This contrasts with conventional other $f$-electron systems hosting skyrmion lattices, such as Gd- and Eu-based compounds without orbital angular momentum.

Title: Implicit Geometric Descriptor-Enabled ANN Framework for a Unified Structure-Property Relationship in Architected Nanofibrous Materials
Authors: Bhanugoban Maheswaran, Komal Chawla, Abhishek Gupta, Ramathasan Thevamaran
Abstract: Hierarchically architected nanofibrous materials, such as the vertically aligned carbon nanotube (VACNT) foams, draw their exceptional mechanical properties from the interplay of nanoscale size effects and inter-nanotube interactions within and across architectures. However, the distinct effects of these mechanisms, amplified by the architecture, on different mechanical properties remain elusive, limiting their independent tunability for targeted property combinations. Reliance on architecture-specific explicit design parameters further inhibits the development of a unified structure-property relationship rooted in those nanoscale mechanisms. Here, we introduce two implicit geometric descriptors -- multi-component shape invariants (MCSI) -- in an artificial neural network (ANN) framework to establish a unified structure-property relationship that governs diverse architectures. The MCSIs effectively capture the key nanoscale mechanisms that give rise to the bulk mechanical properties such as specific-energy absorption, peak stress, and average modulus. Exploiting their ability to predict mechanical properties for designs that are even outside of the training data, we propose generalized design strategies to achieve desired mechanical property combinations in architected VACNT foams. Such implicit descriptor-enabled ANN frameworks can guide the accelerated and tractable design of complex hierarchical materials for applications ranging from shock-absorbing layers in extreme environments to functional components in soft robotics.

Title: Landau Theory of Dynamic Critical Phenomena in the Rayleigh-Benard System
Authors: Miroslav Grmela
Abstract: Physics involving more details than hydrodynamics is needed to formulate rate thermodynamics of the Rayleigh-Bénard system. The Boussinesq vector field is approached in the space of mesoscopic vector fields similarly as equilibrium sates are approached in externally unforced systems in the space of mesoscopic state variables. The approach is driven by gradient of a potential (called a rate entropy). This potential then provides the rate thermodynamics in the same way as the entropy provides thermodynamics for externally unforced systems. By restricting the investigation to a small neighborhood of the critical point we can use the rate-thermodynamic version of the Landau theory.

Title: Contactless measurements of the elastic modulus of living cells using thermal fluctuations of atomic force microscope cantilever
Authors: Hao Zhang, Zaicheng Zhang, Etienne Harte, Francoise Argoul, Abdelhamid Maali
Abstract: We present a contactless method for measuring the elastic modulus of living cells (human triple-negative breast cancer, MDA-MB-231) from the thermal fluctuations of an atomic force microscope (AFM) cantilever. By analyzing the power spectral density (PSD) of the cantilevers thermal fluctuations, we obtain the resonance frequencies of its first three modes at various cell to cantilever separation distances. By comparing measurements on living cells with those on a rigid borosilicate sphere of the same size, we extract the frequency shift caused by the elasto-hydrodynamic coupling between the cantilever fluctuations and the deformations of the cells. We then fit this frequency shift using an elasto-hydrodynamic model that integrates hydrodynamic forces and cell deformation. This approach allows us to determine the elastic modulus values of the living cells for the first three resonant frequencies of the cantilever.

Title: Quantum Spin Liquid phases in Kitaev Materials
Authors: Po-Hao Chou, Chung-Yu Mou, Chung-Hou Chung, Sungkit Yip
Abstract: We develop a gauge-invariant renormalized mean-field theory (RMFT) method, to reliably find the quantum spin liquid (QSL) states and their field response in realistic Kitaev materials. Remarkably, while our RMFT reproduces previous results based on more complicated numerical methods, it also predicts several new stable QSL states. In particular, since Kitaev spin liquid(KSL) is no longer a saddle point solution, a new exotic 2-cone state distinct from the KSL, is found to describe the experimental observations well, and hence the candidate state be realized in the Kitaev material, {\alpha}-RuCl3. We further explore the mechanism for the suppression of the observed thermal Hall conductivity at low temperatures within the fermionic framework, and show the theoretical polarangle dependence of fermionic gap that can distinguish the found 2-cone state from the KSL state in further experiment.

Title: Plasmon-Mediated Hybridization of Wannier-Mott and Frenkel Excitons in a Monolayer WS2 -- J-Aggregate Hybrid System
Authors: Nicolas Zorn Morales, Daniel Steffen Rühl, Sergey Sadofev, Emil List-Kratochvil, Sylke Blumstengel
Abstract: We present a tunable plasmonic platform that allows room temperature hybridization of dissimilar excitons, namely of Wannier-Mott excitons in monolayer (1L) WS2 and Frenkel excitons in molecular J-aggregates via simultaneous strong coupling to surface plasmon polaritons. It is based on a simple layered design consisting of a thin planar silver film and a dielectric spacer on which monolayer and the aggregates are assembled. Strong coupling is revealed by angle-dependent spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements in total internal reflection geometry by the observation of double Rabi splitting at the two excitonic resonances. We analyze the exciton-exciton-plasmon system with the coupled oscillator model and demonstrate modulation of polariton character and dynamics by the number of molecules participating in the coupling. Furthermore, we propose a route to remotely control the mode splitting at the Frenkel excitonic resonance via electrostatic gating of the 1L-WS2 and to switch the molecule-plasmon interaction between the weak and strong coupling regime.

Title: Quantum geometry and low-frequency optical conductivity of topological nodal planes
Authors: Raymond Wiedmann, Kirill Alpin, Moritz M. Hirschmann, Andreas P. Schnyder
Abstract: Nodal planes, two-dimensional symmetry-enforced band crossings, can carry a topological charge, similar to Weyl points. While the transport properties of Weyl points are well understood, those of nodal planes remain largely unexplored. These properties are influenced not only by the Berry curvature, but also by other quantum geometric quantities. In this work we study the quantum geometry - specifically the Berry curvature and quantum metric - and the linear optical conductivity of topological nodal planes. We introduce a low-energy model and investigate its low-frequency optical responses to determine the unique signatures of topological nodal planes. By comparing these findings to the optical response in a tight-binding model with a topological nodal plane, we observe consistent low-frequency behavior with a cubic power law. This paves the way for the experimental detection of topological nodal planes through optical conductivity measurements.

Title: Revealing the loss mechanisms of a 3D superconducting microwave cavity for use in a dark matter search

Pashkin (1) ((1) Department of Physics, Lancaster University, UK, (2) Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, California, USA, (2) School of Mathematical and Physical Sciences, University of Sheffield, UK)
Abstract: Superconducting microwave cavities have found applications in many areas including quantum computing, particle accelerators, and dark matter searches. Their extremely high quality factors translate to very narrow bandwidth, which makes them key components of sensitive detectors. In this study, we aim to understand the loss mechanisms of an aluminium cavity and how they change as the cavity material transitions from the superconducting to normal state. We found that at temperatures not much lower than the transition temperature $T_c$, losses are dominated by quasiparticle excitations and are well described by the BCS theory. The exponential decrease of the quasiparticle density below $T_c$ results in a 1000-fold increase of the quality factor, as well as a shift of the resonance frequency due to the change of the kinetic inductance of the superconductor. At very low temperatures, losses due to two-level systems begin to dominate giving a peak in the quality factor of about 27.6 million at 130 mK. Understanding the loss mechanisms is invaluable, as the working temperature of the cavity may vary during operation regardless of its application.

Title: The fundamental localization phases in quasiperiodic systems: A unified framework and exact results
Authors: Xin-Chi Zhou, Bing-Chen Yao, Yongjian Wang, Yucheng Wang, Yudong Wei, Qi Zhou, Xiong-Jun Liu
Abstract: The disordered quantum systems host three types of quantum states, the extended, localized, and critical, which bring up various distinct fundamental phases, including the pure phases and coexisting ones with mobility edges. The quantum phases involving critical states are of particular importance, but are less understood compared with the other ones, and the different phases have been separately studied in different quasiperiodic models. Here we propose a unified framework based on a spinful quasiperiodic system which unifies the realizations of all the fundamental Anderson phases, with the exact and universal results being obtained for these distinct phases. Through the duality transformation and renormalization group method, we show that the pure phases are obtained when the chiral symmetry preserves in the proposed spin-1/2 quasiperiodic model, which provides a criterion for the emergence of the pure phases or the coexisting ones with mobility edges. Further, we uncover a new universal mechanism for the critical states that the emergence of such states is protected by the generalized incommensurate matrix element zeros in the spinful quasiperiodic model, as a nontrivial generalization of the mechanism in the spinless systems. We also show with the Avila's global theory the criteria of exact solvability for the present unified quasiperiodic system, with which we identify several new quasiperiodic models hosting exactly solvable Anderson phases. We particularly reach two novel models, with one hosting all basic types of mobility edges and the other hosting all the seven fundamental phases of Anderson localization. Finally, an experimental scheme is proposed to realize these models using quasiperiodic optical Raman lattices.

Title: Toroid, Altermagnetic and Noncentrosymmetric ordering in metals
Authors: V.P.Mineev
Abstract: The article is dedicated to the 60-th anniversary of the Landau Institute for Theoretical Physics and presents a review of normal and superconducting properties of toroidal, altermagnetic and noncentrosymmetric metals. Metals with toroidal order are compounds not possessing symmetry in respect of space and time inversion but symmetric in respect of product of these operations. An electric current propagating through samples of such a material causes its magnetisation. Superconducting states in toroidal metals are a mixture of singlet and triplet states. Superconductivity is gapless even in ideal crystals without impurities. Altermegnets are antiferromagnetic metals that have a specific spin splitting of electron bands determined by time inversion in combinations with rotations and reflections of crystal lattice. Similar splitting takes place in metals whose symmetry does not have a spatial inversion operation. Both of these types materials have an anomalous Hall effect. A current propagating through a noncentrosymmetric metal causes magnetization, but this is not the case in altermagnets. On the other hand, in altermagnets there is a specific piezomagnetic Hall effect. Superconducting pairing in non-centrosymmetric metals occurs between electrons occupying states in one zone, whereas in altermagnets we are dealing with interband pairing, which is unfavorable for the formation of a superconducting state.

Title: Probing the Quantum Capacitance of Rydberg Transitions of Surface Electrons on Liquid Helium via Microwave Frequency Modulation
Authors: Asher Jennings, Ivan Grytsenko, Yiran Tian, Oleksiy Rybalko, Jun Wang, Italy Josef Barabash, Erika Kawakami
Abstract: We present a method for probing the quantum capacitance associated with the Rydberg transition of surface electrons on liquid helium using radio-frequency (RF) reflectometry. Resonant microwave excitation of the Rydberg transition induces a redistribution of image charges on capacitively coupled electrodes, giving rise to a quantum capacitance originating from adiabatic state transitions and the finite curvature of the energy bands. By applying frequency-modulated resonant microwaves to drive the Rydberg transition, we systematically measured a capacitance sensitivity of 0.34~aF/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ for our RF reflectometry scheme. This sensitivity is sufficient to detect the Rydberg transition of a single electron, offering a scalable pathway toward qubit readout schemes based on surface electrons on helium.

Title: Instability of oxide perovskite surfaces induced by vacancy formation
Authors: Ned Thaddeus Taylor, Michael Thomas Morgan, Steven Paul Hepplestone
Abstract: This work presents a first principles study of the (001) surface energetics of nine oxide perovskites, with a focus on the role of surface vacancies in determining termination stability. Additionally, investigation into the behaviour of vacancies as a function of depth from the surface in these perovskites, ABO$_{3}$ (A=Ca, Sr, Ba; B=Ti, Zr, Sn), is carried out, and results are compared to formation of the vacancies in bulk. Combining results from these investigations reveals a general trend for all nine perovskites - the undefected AO surface is more energetically favourable to form than the BO2 surface. This dominance of the AO over the BO2 surface is further enforced by the phase diagrams of perovskite surfaces. However, A-site vacancies at the AO surface are far more favourable (1-2 eV lower in energy) than B-site vacancies at the BO2 surface. Charged vacancies only drive this further under oxygen-rich conditions, showing a smaller range of stability for the AO than the BO2 surface. These results indicates that, whilst the AO surface is easier to form, the BO2 surface will display better long term stability, making it more suitable for use in potential applications. This study furthers the understanding of oxide perovskite (001)-terminated surface stability, which will aid in surface growth and manufacturing.

Title: Nanomechanics and Pore Structure of Sodium and Potassium Geopolymer Gels: Experiments, Molecular Dynamics and Coarse-Grained Simulations
Authors: Enrico Masoero, Eduardo Duque-Redondo, Haklae Lee, Yunzhi Xu, Francesca Lolli, Elie Kamseu, Ange-Therese Akono
Abstract: The link between composition, microstructure and mechanics of NASH and KASH gels is elusive, even in pure metakaolin-based geopolymers. This article exploits molecular mechanics, coarse-grained nanomechanics and micromechanics, to interpret new experimental results from microscopy, porosimetry and nanoindentation. KASH displays a finer nanogranular structure than NASH (3 vs 30 nm particle diameters, 5 vs 50 nm average pore diameters), higher skeletal density (2.3 vs 2.02 g/cm$^3$), nanoindentation moduli (9.21 vs 7.5 GPa) and hardness (0.56 vs 0.37 GPa) despite a higher total porosity (0.48-0.53 vs 0.38). This suggests a stiffer and stronger solid skeleton for KASH, confirmed through predictive molecular dynamics simulations on recent and new models of NASH and KASH. The atomistic simulations inform mechanical interactions for new, coarse-grained, particle-based models of NASH and KASH. The resulting simulations predict the nanoindentation result that KASH is stiffer than equally porous NASH and the impact of formation eigenstresses on elastic moduli.

Title: Coupled-wire Construction of a Non-crystalline Fractional Quantum Hall Effect
Authors: Justin Schirmann, Peru d'Ornellas, Adolfo G. Grushin
Abstract: The fractional quantum Hall effect, a paradigmatic topologically ordered state, has been realised in two-dimensional strongly correlated quantum gases and Chern bands of crystals. Here we construct a non-crystalline analogue by coupling quantum wires that are not periodically placed in real-space. Remarkably, the model remains solvable using bosonisation techniques. Due to the non-uniform couplings between the wires, the ground state has different degeneracy compared to the crystalline case. It displays a rich phenomenology of excitations, which can either behave like anyons confined to move in one dimension (lineons), anyons confined to hop between two wires (s-lineons), and anyonic excitations that are free to travel across the system. Both the ground state degeneracy and mutual statistics are directly determined by the real-space positions of the wires. By providing an analytically solvable model of a non-crystalline fractional quantum Hall effect, our work showcases that topological order can display richer phenomenology beyond crystals. More broadly, the non-uniform wire construction we develop can serve as a tool to explore richer many-body phenomenology in non-crystalline systems.

Title: The Global Diffusion Limit for the Space Dependent Variable-Order Time-Fractional Diffusion Equation
Authors: Christopher N. Angstmann, Daniel S. Han, Bruce I. Henry, Boris Z. Huang, Zhuang Xu
Abstract: The diffusion equation and its time-fractional counterpart can be obtained via the diffusion limit of continuous-time random walks with exponential and heavy-tailed waiting time distributions. The space dependent variable-order time-fractional diffusion equation is a generalization of the time-fractional diffusion equation with a fractional exponent that varies over space, modelling systems with spatial heterogeneity. However, there has been limited work on defining a global diffusion limit and an underlying random walk for this macroscopic governing equation, which is needed to make meaningful interpretations of the parameters for applications. Here, we introduce continuous time and discrete time random walk models that limit to the variable-order fractional diffusion equation via a global diffusion limit and space- and time- continuum limits. From this, we show how the master equation of the discrete time random walk can be used to provide a numerical method for solving the variable-order fractional diffusion equation. The results in this work provide underlying random walks and an improved understanding of the diffusion limit for the variable-order fractional diffusion equation, which is critical for the development, calibration and validation of models for diffusion in spatially inhomogeneous media with traps and obstacles.

Title: Decomposition of State Spaces into Subobjects in Quantum Field Theory
Authors: Pierre Gosselin (IF)
Abstract: This paper introduces a comprehensive formalism for decomposing the state space of a quantum field into several entangled subobjects, i.e., fields generating a subspace of states. Projecting some of the subobjects onto degenerate background states reduces the system to an effective field theory depending on parameters representing the degeneracies. Notably, these parameters are not exogenous. The entanglement among subobjects in the initial system manifests as an interrelation between parameters and non-projected subobjects. Untangling this dependency necessitates imposing linear first-order equations on the effective field. The geometric characteristics of the parameter spaces depend on both the effective field and the background of the projected subobjects. The system, governed by arbitrary variables, has no dynamics, but the projection of some subobjects can be interpreted as slicing the original state space according to the lowest eigenvalues of a parameter-dependent family of operators. The slices can be endowed with amplitudes similar to some transitions between each other, contingent upon these eigenvalues. Averaging over all possible transitions shows that the amplitudes are higher for maps with increased eigenvalue than for maps with decreasing eigenvalue.

Title: Low loss hybrid Nb/Au superconducting resonators for quantum circuit applications
Authors: Marina C. de Ory, Victor Rollano, David Rodriguez, Maria T. Magaz, Daniel Granados, Alicia Gomez
Abstract: Superconducting resonators play a crucial role in the development of quantum technologies such as quantum computing or high performance detectors. Yet, one of their main limitations regarding to noise and sensitivity is the interaction with two-level systems present in oxide layers in the device. Focused on mitigating this problem, we study a superconducting device combining a 100 nm niobium (Nb) circuit with a 10 nm gold (Au) capping layer. Our investigation covers a wide range of temperatures and driving powers, revealing that adding the Au layer reduces the density of two-level system defects while maintaining a very high quality factor. Moreover, an increase in the non-linearity response is also observed. Our findings suggest the potential of Nb/Au lumped element resonators as versatile and promising tools for advancing superconducting quantum technologies.

Title: Analytical modeling of coated plasmonic particles
Authors: Nikolai G. Khlebtsov, Sergey V. Zarkov
Abstract: Biomedical applications of plasmonic nanoparticle conjugates need control over their optical properties modulated by surface coating with stabilizing or targeting molecules often attached to or embedded in the secondary functionalization shell, such as silica. Although current numerical techniques can simulate the plasmonic response of such structures, it is desirable in practice to have analytical models based on simple physical ideas that can be implemented without considerable computer resources. Here, we present two efficient analytical methods based on improved electrostatic approximation (IEA) and modal expansion method (MEM) combined with the dipole equivalence method (DEM). The last approach avoids additional electromagnetic simulations and provides a direct bridge between analytical IEA and MEM models for bare particles and those with multilayer shells. As simple as the original IEA and MEM, the developed analytical extensions provide accurate extinction and scattering spectra for coated particles compared to exact calculations by separation of variable method and COMSOL. The possibility and accuracy of analytical models are illustrated by extensive simulations for prolate and oblate gold and silver nanoparticles with a maximal size of up to 200 nm, aspect ratio from 2 to 6, and 3-30 nm dielectric coating.

Title: Observation of Time Crystal in a Spin Maser System
Authors: Weiyu Wang, Mingjun Feng, Qianjin Ma, Zi Cai, Erwei Li, Guobin Liu
Abstract: Pair interaction potentials between atoms in a crystal are in general non-monotonic in distance, with a local minimum whose position gives the lattice constant of the crystal. A temporal analogue of this idea of crystal formation is still pending despite intensive studies on the time crystal phase. In a hybrid spin maser system with a time delay feedback, we report the observation of a time crystal induced by a retarded interaction with a characteristic time scale. This nonequilibrium phase features a self-sustained oscillation with an emergent frequency other than the intrinsic Larmor precession frequency of the spin maser system. It is shown that the amplitude of the oscillation is robust against perturbation, while its time phase randomly distributes from 0 to $2\pi$ for different realizations, a signature of spontaneous time translation symmetry breaking. This time crystal phase emerges only when the feedback strength exceeds a critical value, at which the system experiences a first order phase transition. Such a retarded interaction induced time crystal is closer to the idea of crystal, compared to other time crystal realizations.

Title: Nuclear Spin Metrology with Nitrogen Vacancy Center in Diamond for Axion Dark Matter Detection
Authors: So Chigusa, Masashi Hazumi, Ernst David Herbschleb, Yuichiro Matsuzaki, Norikazu Mizuochi, Kazunori Nakayama
Abstract: We present a method to directly detect the axion dark matter using nitrogen vacancy centers in diamonds. In particular, we use metrology leveraging the nuclear spin of nitrogen to detect axion-nucleus couplings. This is achieved through protocols designed for dark matter searches, which introduce a novel approach of quantum sensing techniques based on the nitrogen vacancy center. Although the coupling strength of the magnetic fields with nuclear spins is three orders of magnitude smaller than that with electron spins for conventional magnetometry, the axion interaction strength with nuclear spins is the same order of magnitude as that with electron spins. Furthermore, we can take advantage of the long coherence time by using the nuclear spins for the axion dark matter detection. We show that our method is sensitive to a broad frequency range $\lesssim 100\,\mathrm{Hz}$ corresponding to the axion mass $m_a \lesssim 4\times 10^{-13}\,\mathrm{eV}$. We present the detection limit of our method for both the axion-neutron and the axion-proton couplings and discuss its significance in comparison with other proposed ideas.

Title: Space-Time Optical Diffraction from Synthetic Motion
Authors: A. C. Harwood, S. Vezzoli, T. V. Raziman, C. Hooper, R. Tirole, F. Wu, S. A. Maier, J. B. Pendry, S. A. R. Horsley, R. Sapienza
Abstract: The interaction of light with objects and media moving at relativistic and superluminal speeds enables unconventional phenomena such as Fresnel drag, Hawking radiation, and light amplification. Synthetic motion, facilitated by modulated internal degrees of freedom, enables the study of relativistic phenomena unrestricted by the speed of light. In this study, we investigate synthetically moving apertures created by high-contrast reflectivity modulations, which are generated by ultrafast laser pulses on a subwavelength thin film of indium tin oxide. The space-time diffraction of a weaker probe beam reveals a complex, non-separable spatio-temporal transformation, where changes in the frequency of the wave are correlated to changes in its momentum. By using schemes of continuous or discrete modulation we demonstrate tunable frequency-momentum diffraction patterns with gradients that depend upon the relative velocity between the modulation and the probe wave. The diffraction patterns are matched by operator-based theory and the gradients are analytically predicted using a super-relativistic Doppler model, where the modulation is described as a superluminally moving scattering particle. Our experiments open a path towards mimicking relativistic mechanics and developing complex and programmable spatio-temporal transformations of light.

Title: Adsorb-Agent: Autonomous Identification of Stable Adsorption Configurations via Large Language Model Agent
Authors: Janghoon Ock, Tirtha Vinchurkar, Yayati Jadhav, Amir Barati Farimani
Abstract: Adsorption energy is a key reactivity descriptor in catalysis, enabling efficient screening for optimal catalysts. However, determining adsorption energy typically requires evaluating numerous adsorbate-catalyst configurations. Current algorithmic approaches rely on exhaustive enumeration of adsorption sites and configurations, which makes the process computationally intensive and does not inherently guarantee the identification of the global minimum energy. In this work, we introduce Adsorb-Agent, a Large Language Model (LLM) agent designed to efficiently identify system-specific stable adsorption configurations corresponding to the global minimum adsorption energy. Adsorb-Agent leverages its built-in knowledge and emergent reasoning capabilities to strategically explore adsorption configurations likely to hold adsorption energy. By reducing the reliance on exhaustive sampling, it significantly decreases the number of initial configurations required while improving the accuracy of adsorption energy predictions. We evaluate Adsorb-Agent's performance across twenty representative systems encompassing a range of complexities. The Adsorb-Agent successfully identifies comparable adsorption energies for 83.7% of the systems and achieves lower energies, closer to the actual global minimum, for 35% of the systems, while requiring significantly fewer initial configurations than conventional methods. Its capability is particularly evident in complex systems, where it identifies lower adsorption energies for 46.7% of systems involving intermetallic surfaces and 66.7% of systems with large adsorbate molecules. These results demonstrate the potential of Adsorb-Agent to accelerate catalyst discovery by reducing computational costs and improving the reliability of adsorption energy predictions.

Title: Enhancing light emission with electric fields in polar nitride semiconductors
Authors: Nick Pant, Rob Armitage, Emmanouil Kioupakis
Abstract: Significant effort has been devoted to mitigating polarization fields in nitride LEDs, as these fields are traditionally viewed as detrimental to light emission, particularly for red emission. Contrary to this prevailing notion, we demonstrate that strong polarization fields can enhance the optical-transition strength of AlInGaN quantum wells emitting in the red, which has been historically challenging to achieve. By leveraging machine-learning surrogate models trained on multi-scale quantum-mechanical simulations, we globally explore the heterostructure design space and uncover that larger fields correlate with higher electron-hole overlap. This relation arises from the quantum-confined Stark effect, which enables thinner wells without requiring higher indium compositions, thus overcoming a key limitation in nitride epitaxy. Structural and compositional engineering of internal fields offers a unique dimension for designing polychromatic nitride LEDs, crucial for miniaturizing LED pixels to the micron scale for extended-reality and biomedical applications. Broadly, our work demonstrates how machine learning can uncover unexpected paradigms for semiconductor design.

Title: Limits of the Lindblad and non-Hermitian description of open systems
Authors: Kyle Monkman, Mona Berciu
Abstract: While it is well established that the dynamics of an open system is described accurately by the Lindblad master equation if the coupling to the bath is either in the weak or in the singular limit, it is not known whether this also extends to other coupling strengths. Here we use the exact solution of a microscopic system coupled to baths to gauge the validity of the Lindblad dynamics during a finite time evolution, and show that for a pure decay system, Lindbladian dynamics generally only holds in the weak and singular coupling limits. We also prove that Lindblad and non-Hermitian dynamics are equivalent in the highest particle subspace of such systems with pure decay. Using this equivalence, we rule out the possibility of obtaining non-Hermitian dynamics for any other couplings. Furthermore, we argue that exceptional points of the effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian can only occur in the singular coupling limit, never in the weak coupling limit. Physically, this means that exceptional points can occur when the intrinsic time evolution of the isolated system is comparable to the relaxation time scale.

Title: Time-dependent Neural Galerkin Method for Quantum Dynamics
Authors: Alessandro Sinibaldi, Douglas Hendry, Filippo Vicentini, Giuseppe Carleo
Abstract: We introduce a classical computational method for quantum dynamics that relies on a global-in-time variational principle. Unlike conventional time-stepping approaches, our scheme computes the entire state trajectory over a finite time window by minimizing a loss function that enforces the Schrödinger's equation. The variational state is parametrized with a Galerkin-inspired ansatz based on a time-dependent linear combination of time-independent Neural Quantum States. This structure is particularly well-suited for exploring long-time dynamics and enables bounding the error with the exact evolution via the global loss function. We showcase the method by simulating global quantum quenches in the paradigmatic Transverse-Field Ising model in both 1D and 2D, uncovering signatures of ergodicity breaking and absence of thermalization in two dimensions. Overall, our method is competitive compared to state-of-the-art time-dependent variational approaches, while unlocking previously inaccessible dynamical regimes of strongly interacting quantum systems.

Title: Dynamics of localized states in the stochastic discrete nonlinear Schrödinger equation
Authors: Mahdieh Ebrahimi, Barbara Drossel, Wolfram Just
Abstract: We revisit aspects of dynamics and stability of localized states in the deterministic and stochastic discrete nonlinear Schrödinger equation. By a combination of analytic and numerical techniques, we show that localized initial conditions disperse if the strength of the nonlinear part drops below a threshold and that localized states are unstable in a noisy environment. As expected, the constants of motion in the nonlinear Schrödinger equation play a crucial role. An infinite temperature state emerges when multiplicative noise is applied, while additive noise yields unbounded dynamics since conservation of normalization is violated.

Title: Beyond Robertson-Schrödinger: A General Uncertainty Relation Unveiling Hidden Noncommutative Trade-offs
Authors: Gen Kimura, Aina Mayumi, Hiromichi Ohno, Jaeha Lee, Dariusz Chruściński
Abstract: We report a universal strengthening of the Robertson-Schr\''odinger uncertainty relation, revealing a previously overlooked trade-off of genuinely quantum origin, particularly as the state becomes more mixed. Remarkably, this generalized bound supplements the standard commutator term and the covariance term with an additional positive contribution that depends on the commutator of observables. The relation also rigorously proves and extends a conjectured uncertainty relation previously proposed in [Phys. Rev. A 110, 062215 (2024)]. For two-level quantum systems, the inequality becomes an exact equality for any state and any pair of observables, establishing that the bound is tight in the strongest possible sense.
