Title: Study of the Molecular Level Mechanism of Nanoscale Alternating Current Electrohydrodynamic Flow
Authors: Sobin Alosious, Fiach Antaw, Matt Trau, Shern R. Tee, Debra J. Searles
Abstract: This study investigates the molecular-level mechanism of Alternating Current Electrohydrodynamic (AC-EHD) flow in nanopores under high-frequency conditions, using molecular dynamics simulations. A gold-NaCl system with symmetric and asymmetric electrode configurations is used to analyze the flow patterns under high-frequency AC potentials. Our findings reveal localized heat generation near the electrode leading to a steep temperature gradient. An order parameter analysis explained that the heat generation is due to the periodic change in the alignment of water molecules under AC potential and that at these high frequencies the influence of Na$^+$ and Cl$^-$ ions are negligible. The heat generation and temperature gradient are found to increase with the applied AC frequency. Three different electrode configurations were studied by varying the size and distance between the electrodes. A net directional flow develops in the asymmetric electrode structures. A possible mechanism for this is proposed by analyzing the flow patterns using velocity and temperature profiles, order parameters, streamline plots and mean square displacements. Different forces acting on the fluid were identified such as buoyancy-driven convection due to temperature gradient, electrothermal effects influenced by the temperature-dependent properties of water, and Maxwell stress due to the non-uniform electric field. Moreover, the asymmetric electrode structure created an imbalance in these forces and generated a net directional flow. These findings suggest the existence of a form of nanoscale AC-EHD flow that operates in a frequency regime above that of conventional electroosmotic and electrothermal mechanisms and that, unlike these mechanisms, occurs independently of ionic concentration. Thereby this work provides insights for optimizing AC-EHD flow in nanoscale systems where precise fluid manipulation is critical.

Title: Beyond mechanochromism: Programmable multimodal actuation in cholesteric liquid crystal elastomer hollow fibers
Authors: Jiazhe Ma, John S. Biggins, Fan Feng, Zhongqiang Yang
Abstract: Cholesteric liquid crystal elastomers (CLCEs) change color under strain, offering attractive prospects for smart textiles, soft robotics, and photonic devices. However, the helical structure of CLCEs averages out the exceptional anisotropy and soft elasticity of their nematic parents, leaving little scope for also using the director orientation to program their thermal or mechanical actuation. Here, we develop programmable CLCE hollow fibers via an anisotropic deswelling-assisted template method. By integrating dynamic boronic ester bond exchange with mechanical force/pneumatic pressure-induced liquid crystal mesogen orientation, we are able to make CLCE fibers with overall longitudinal, circumferential, and twisted directors, while preserving enough residual periodicity to maintain their structural color. Inflation of these fibers then yields a range of motions (expansion, contraction, elongation, and twisting) accompanied by synchronous adaptive color changes. To explain these motions, we derive a membrane balloon model based on the non-ideal neo-classical LCE energy with suitable CLCE director profiles. The model successfully captures all the key mechanical features, including non-monotonicity and sub-criticality as a function of inflationary pressure. We thus confirm that the fiber's rich mechanochromic behavior originates from the combination of cholesteric color and nematic-like programmed soft elasticity. Our study thus transcends the limitations of traditional CLCE fibers by combining orientation encoding, soft elasticity, and pneumatic actuation to provide a new paradigm for the development of systems that change both shape and color in a bespoke and versatile way.

Title: Aggregates in fluidized beds: the effect of bonding angles on fluidization
Authors: Vinícius Pereira da Silva Oliveira, Danilo da Silva Borges, Erick de Moraes Franklin
Abstract: Fluidized beds consist of solid particles suspended in a tube by an ascending fluid. In liquids, it is not rare that particles adhere to each other, decreasing the solid-liquid contact area and the ratio between the tube and grain diameters, deteriorating fluidization. We inquire into this problem by carrying out experiments with trios of spheres fluidized by water flows, the spheres being glued in predefined angles. In our tests, we used a 25.4-mm-ID (internal diameter) tube and 5.95-mm-diameter spheres, and we varied the angle of trios within 60$^{\circ}$ and 180$^\circ$ and water velocities within 0.027 and 0.210 m/s. Due to the small ratio between the diameters of the tube and spheres (approximately 4.3), the bed is prone to the formation of plugs and clogs. Our experiments show that elutriation, fluidization with plugs, glass transitions (amorphous static structures), packed beds, clogging, and a transitional clogged-plug regime can appear in the bed, depending on the bonding angles and water velocities. We report the relations between the bed height, bonding angles, and flow velocity, and show that they correlate with the granular temperature. We also show that an angle of 90$^\circ$ maximizes fluidization for a given fluid velocity, and we propose a regime map that organizes the different patterns based on the bonding angle and flow velocity. The proposed map can serve as a guide for selecting the fluid velocities in order to keep the bed fluidized at all times, helping in the design and operation of fluidized beds.

Title: Dynamic Phase Transitions in Mean-Field Ginzburg-Landau Models: Conjugate Fields and Fourier-Mode Scaling
Authors: Yelyzaveta Satynska, Daniel T. Robb
Abstract: Dynamic phase transitions of periodically forced mean-field ferromagnets are often described by a single order parameter and a scalar conjugate field. Building from previous work, we show that, at the critical period $P_c$ of the mean-field Ginzburg-Landau (MFGL) dynamics with energy $F(m)=am^2+bm^4-hm$, the correct conjugate field is the entire even-Fourier component part of the applied field. The correct order parameter is $z_k=\sqrt{\bigl|\,m_k^2-|m_{k,c}|^2\,\bigr|}$, where $m_k$ is the $k^{th}$ Fourier component of the magnetization m(t), and $m_{k,c}$ is the $k^{th}$ Fourier component at the critical period. Using high-accuracy limit-cycle integration and Fourier analysis, we first confirm that, for periodic fields that contain only odd components, the symmetry-broken branch below $P_c$ exhibits $z_k \propto \varepsilon^{1/2}$ (computationally tested for modes $k\le30$), where $\varepsilon=(P_c-P)/P_c$. This provides strong evidence that the 1/2 scaling holds for all Fourier modes. We then find three robust facts: (1) Exactly at $P_c$, adding a small perturbation composed of even Fourier components with an overall field multiplier $h_{mult}$ yields $z_k \propto h_{mult}^{1/3}$ across many $k$. (2) Mode-resolved deviations obey a parity rule: $|\delta m_{2n}| \propto h_{mult}^{1/3}$ and $|\delta m_{2n+1}| \propto h_{mult}^{2/3}$. (3) The same findings persist in MFGL models where an $m^6$ replaces the $m^4$ term and come with simple one-period integral criteria to locate $P_c$.

Title: Vertex and front-tracking methods for the modeling of microstructure evolution at the solid state: a brief review
Authors: Marc Bernacki
Abstract: In mesoscopic scale microstructure evolution modeling, two primary numerical frameworks are used: Front-Capturing (FC) and Front-Tracking (FT) ones. FC models, like phase-field or level-set methods, indirectly define interfaces by tracking field variable changes. On the contrary, FT models explicitly define interfaces using interconnected segments or surfaces. In historical FT methodologies, Vertex models were first developed and consider the description of the evolution of polygonal structures in terms of the motion of points where multiple boundaries meet. Globally, FT-type approaches, often associated with Lagrangian movement, enhance spatial resolution in 3D surfacic and 2D lineic problems using techniques derived from finite element meshing and remeshing algorithms. These efficient approaches, by nature, are well adapted to physical mechanisms correlated to interface properties and geometries. They also face challenges in managing complex topological events, especially in 3D. However, recent advances highlight their potential in computational efficiency and analysis of mobility and energy properties, with possible applications in intragranular phenomena.

Title: Laser Patterning of Superhydrophobic transparent glass surfaces with anti-fogging and anti-icing applications
Authors: Laura Montes-Montañez, Fernando Nuñez-Galvez, Melania Sanchez-Villa, Luis A. Angurel, Heli Koivuluo-to, German F. de la Fuente, Víctor Trillaud, Philippe Steyer, Karine Masenelli-Varlot, Francisco J. Palomares, Ana Borrás, Agustín R. González-Elipe, Carmen López-Santos, Víctor Rico
Abstract: This work addresses the fabrication of transparent glass surfaces with superior water-repellence (i.e., superhydrophobicity), and related functional properties such as omniphobicity, anti-fogging and anti-icing responses. Surfaces have been processed by means of mild femtosecond laser patterning combined with the grafting of fluorinated tethered molecules. Controlling the laser scan and ablation conditions permits the fabrication of under-design grooves with cross and lineal morphologies and separations between 10 and 500 um. These patterns provide a high transparency and repellence to liquids and ice over large areas. The best performance is obtained for cross or parallel line patterned glass with microgrooves separated by 100 um and 15 um depth thanks to 5 laser scanning repetitions. These surfaces present a stable Cassie-Baxter wetting state and very low ice-adhesion strength while keeping up to 80 % of optical transmittance in the visible region. Anti-fouling tests, along with freezing and thawing cycles on these surfaces, have demonstrated a remarkable and durable self-cleaning response, even under environmentally stressful conditions. Water condensation experiments conducted under atmospheric conditions, as well as in an environmental electron scanning microscope, have revealed important issues related to the formation of supercooled water droplets. These experiments show that the patterned breakdown of surface properties effectively prevents extensive fogging and water accumulation. This feature is particularly crucial for outdoors and low temperature applications where the preservation of transparency is essential.

Title: Imaging magnetic flux trapping in lanthanum hydride using diamond quantum sensors
Authors: Yang Chen, Junyan Wen, Ze-Xu He, Jing-Wei Fan, Xin-Yu Pan, Cheng Ji, Huiyang Gou, Xiaohui Yu, Liucheng Chen, Gang-Qin Liu
Abstract: Lanthanum hydride has attracted significant attention in recent years due to its signatures of superconductivity at around 250 K (1, 2). However, the megabar pressures required for synthesize and maintain its state present extraordinary challenges for experiments, particularly in characterizing its Meissner effect (3, 4). The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond has emerged as a promising quantum probe to address this problem (5-8), but a gap remains between its working pressure and the pressure required to study the superconducting state of lanthanum hydride (9-12). In this work, using neon gas as the pressure transmitting medium, the working pressure of NV centers is extended to nearly 200 GPa. This quantum probe is then applied to study the Meissner effect of a LaH$_{9.6}$ sample, synthesized by laser heating ammonia borane and lanthanum. A strong magnetic shielding effect is observed, with the transition temperature beginning at around 180 K and completing at 220 K. In addition, magnetic field imaging after field cooling reveals strong flux trapping and significant inhomogeneities within the sample. Our work provides compelling evidence for superconductivity in lanthanum hydride and highlights the importance of spatially resolved techniques in characterizing samples under ultrahigh pressure conditions.

Title: Interlayer Pores Play a Limited Role in Diffusion Through Hydrated Na-MMT: Insights from a Multiscale, Experimentally Anchored Model
Authors: Yaoting Zhang, Mikaella Brillantes, Justine Kuczera, Keyvan Ferasat, Mia L. San Gabriel, Scott Briggs, Chang Seok Kim, George Opletal, Yuankai Yang, Jane Howe, Laurent K. Beland
Abstract: This study investigates the interlayer diffusion dynamics in sodium montmorillonite (Na-MMT), a smectite clay with significant applications in environmental science, pharmaceuticals, and advanced materials. We present a multiscale computational framework that integrates atomistic simulations with mesoscale modelling to explore the influence of interlayer and free pores on water and ion diffusion under varying dry densities (0.8--1.3 g/cm$^3$). The model incorporates experimentally determined platelet size distributions and explicitly accounts for polydispersity and anisotropic transport. The study results reveal that interlayer pores contribute minimally to overall water diffusion at the studied dry densities. Water diffusion predominantly occurs through free pores, with diffusion scaling factors closely aligning with experimental tritium tracer measurements when interlayer throttling was considered. The study also highlights the anisotropic nature of diffusion in Na-MMT, with diffusion parallel-to-compaction being significantly slower than in the normal direction which is consistent with experiments. The computational model, validated against lattice Boltzmann simulations and experimental data, provides insights into the geometric tortuosity and pore size distribution of Na-MMT. Despite its limitations, such as the absence of three-water minima energy profiles and rigid platelet assumptions, the model offers a robust framework for understanding nanoconfined diffusion. Future work will focus on refining interlayer energy profiles and incorporating flexible platelet dynamics to enhance predictive accuracy with implications for optimizing materials in environmental, industrial, and biomedical applications.

Title: Power- and time-dependent equivalent circuit models for waveform-selective metasurfaces with varying electromagnetic responses to repeated pulses at the same frequency
Authors: Ryuho Miyamoto, Hiroki Wakatsuchi
Abstract: Waveform-selective metasurfaces offer unprecedented control over electromagnetic waves on the basis of pulse width. However, existing circuit models fail to capture the power-dependent behaviors of these metasurfaces, thereby limiting their use in practical applications. Here, for the first time, we present analytical equivalent circuit models that accurately predict both power- and time-dependent responses by incorporating voltage-dependent diode resistance through the Maclaurin series and Wright omega functions. As a result, the variations in the input power and time domain are effectively predicted theoretically. Moreover, our concept is successfully extended to different types of waveform-selective metasurfaces and increasingly complex scenarios, including repeated pulses and nonresonant frequencies. Thus, our equivalent circuit approach can readily explain and quantify the electromagnetic behaviors of waveform-selective metasurfaces. This strategy provides a high degree of control for addressing complex electromagnetic problems by leveraging pulse width as a tuning parameter, even at a fixed frequency.

Title: Intertwined Orders, Quantum Criticality and Skyrmions in Tunable Topological Bands
Authors: Xuepeng Wang, Johannes S. Hofmann, Debanjan Chowdhury
Abstract: Skyrmions are emergent many-body excitations that lie at the heart of both multi-component quantum Hall-like systems and deconfined quantum criticality. In a companion article (X. Wang et al., arXiv:2507.22971), we studied a microscopic time-reversal symmetric model of tunable interacting Chern bands using numerically exact determinant quantum Monte Carlo calculations, and presented evidence for the emergence of robust skyrmion excitations. These charged excitations emerge in the vicinity of a many-body insulator at a commensurate filling of the Chern bands, and lead to the onset of superconductivity when doped away from the insulating phase. Here, we present quantum Monte-Carlo results and a complementary field-theoretical analysis for the quantum phase transition(s) that arise between the intertwined phases as a function of two distinct tuning parameters. Our numerical results are consistent with a single continuous quantum phase transition between an insulating Chern antiferromagnet and a fully gapped superconductor, with an emergent SO(5) symmetry at the putative critical point, highly suggestive of deconfined quantum (pseudo-)criticality. We also present a detailed comparison between the momentum-resolved spectral functions associated with the neutral collective modes, single electron and composite spin-polaron excitations obtained using a combination of Monte-Carlo computations and a Bethe-Salpeter analysis built on top of the self-consistent Hartree-Fock calculation. We end with a brief outlook on some of the interesting open problems.

Title: Impurity-induced topological decomposition
Authors: Tianxing Shi, Chuhang Zhang, Liang Jin, Linhu Li
Abstract: Controlling topological phases is a central goal in quantum materials and related fields, enabling applications such as robust transport and programmable edge states. Here we uncover a mechanism in which local on-site impurities act as knobs to decompose global topological properties in discrete steps. In non-Hermitian lattices with spectral winding topology, we show that each impurity sequentially reduces the winding number by one, which is directly manifested as a stepwise decomposition of quantized plateaus in the steady-state response. Based on this principle, we further develop a scheme that sequentially induces topological edge states under impurity control, in a class of Hermitian topological systems constructed by doubling the non-Hermitian ones. Our findings reveal a general scheme to tune global topological properties with local perturbations, establishing a universal framework for impurity-controlled topological phases and offering a foundation for future exploration of reconfigurable topological phenomena across diverse physical platforms.

Title: Emergent Microrobotic Behavior of Active Flexicles in Complex Environments
Authors: Sophie Y. Lee, Philipp W.A. Schönhöfer, Sharon C. Glotzer
Abstract: Collections of simple, self-propelled colloidal particles exhibit complex, emergent dynamical behavior, with promising applications in microrobotics. When confined within a deformable vesicle, self-propelled rods cluster and align, propelling the vesicle and inducing changes in the vesicle shape. We explore potential microrobotic capabilities of such vesicle-encapsulated particles, which form a composite particle system termed a `flexicle'. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that the alignment of rods enables flexicles to locomote and respond adaptively to their physical environment. When encountering solid boundaries or obstacles, the rods reorient at the interface, triggering novel emergent behaviors such as crawling, corner-preferencing, wall climbing, and object-latching. These interactions and accompanying internal rod re-arrangement lead to spontaneous, temporary differentiation of the rods into `latchers' and `navigators'. This division of labor among the rods enables coordinated locomotion and environmental response. Our findings establish flexicles as a versatile platform for programmable, geometry-sensitive microrobotic behavior, offering a step toward autonomous colloidal robotics.

Title: Machine-learning-derived protocols for information-based work extraction from active particles
Authors: Grzegorz Szamel
Abstract: We propose and analyze a process that extracts useful work from a single active particle maintained at constant temperature in a harmonic potential by measuring the relative sign of the self-propulsion and the confining force and then adjusting the stiffness of the potential. First, we show analytically that useful work can be extracted by stepwise changes of the stiffness. Then, we use a machine learning procedure to find time-dependent stiffness change protocols. We find that these protocols involve discontinuous initial changes of the stiffness opposite to the expected direction resembling the jumps analytically found by Garcia-Millan et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 135, 088301 (2025)] in a different information-based work extraction process. The learned protocols allow to extract significantly larger amounts of useful work. The work extracted exceeds that allowed by the second law for feedback processes, which can be rationalized by the non-equilibrium character of the system considered.

Title: Phase diagram of amorphous quantum spin Hall insulators
Authors: Ranadeep Roy, Yuan-Ming Lu
Abstract: In light of recent progress in the study of amorphous topological phases, we investigate the effects of structural disorder on the topological properties of a two-dimensional quantum spin Hall insulator modeled by the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang Hamiltonian. Using a real-space formulation of the Z2 invariant for Dirac-type Hamiltonian, we map out the phase diagram as a function of disorder strength and the mass parameter. Our results reveal that under the influence of structural disorder, a system can either undergo a phase transition from a topologically non-trivial to a topologically trivial phase or from a trivial to non-trivial phase. Remarkably, in certain parameter regimes, the system exhibits a re-entrant behaviour: a topologically non-trivial phase in the perfect lattice undergoes a transition to a trivial state under the influence of weak disorder but re-emerges as the disorder strength is further increased. We corroborate these findings through analysis of the bulk-boundary correspondence and transport calculations.

Title: Nonlinear magnetization dynamics as a route to nonreciprocal phases, spin superfluidity, and analogue gravity
Authors: Vincent Flynn, Benedetta Flebus
Abstract: The identification of platforms with independently tunable nonlinearity and non-Hermiticity promises a quantitative route to far-from-equilibrium universality across many-body systems. Here we show that a conventional ferromagnetic multilayer realizes this paradigm: balancing a dc drive against Gilbert damping stabilizes a chiral spin-superfluid limit cycle that spontaneously breaks spacetime-translation symmetry. The resulting superflow is intrinsically nonreciprocal: long-wavelength magnons of opposite chirality acquire asymmetric dispersions and propagate direction-selectively, realizing a spin-superfluid diode. This asymmetry is flow-borne - it reflects broken Galilean invariance and requires neither structural asymmetry nor finely tuned gain-loss balance. Linearized dynamics in the comoving superfluid frame are intrinsically pseudo-Hermitian and, in the long-wavelength sector, can be mapped to a (1+1)D wave equation on curved spacetime. Spatial modulation of the drive enables the generation of sonic horizons that parametrically squeeze magnons and produce Hawking-like particle-hole emission. Our results establish a tabletop route from nonlinear dissipative-driven magnetization dynamics to nonreciprocal transport, nonequilibrium phase transitions, and analogue-gravity kinematics.

Title: Altermagnetism, Kagome Flat Band, and Weyl Fermion States in Magnetically Intercalated Transition Metal Dichalcogenides
Authors: Avinash Sah, Ting-Yong Lim, Clayton Conner, Amarnath Chakraborty, Giovanni Vignale, Tay-Rong Chang, Pavlo Sukhachov, Guang Bian
Abstract: Altermagnetic (AM) compounds have recently emerged as a promising platform for realizing unconventional quantum phases, enabled by their unique spin-split band structure at zero net magnetization. Here, we present a first-principles investigation of magnetically intercalated transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) of the form XY$_4$Z$_8$ (X $=$ Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cr, or V; Y $=$ Nb or Ta; and Z $=$ Se or S), identifying a subset of new versatile AM candidates. Our results establish a direct correlation between interatomic geometry, quantified by the ratio of interlayer to intralayer spacing, and the selection of magnetic ground states. Systems with A-type antiferromagnetic order exhibit momentum-dependent spin splitting consistent with AM behavior. Crucially, the combination of the AM spin-splitting and the spin-orbit coupling leads to the emergence of Weyl nodes together with the corresponding topological Fermi arc surface states. Moreover, we identify flat bands near the Fermi level that originate from the intercalant-induced formation of an effective kagome-like sublattice in the TMD layer. These results collectively establish magnetically intercalated TMDs as a promising platform for engineering altermagnetism, flat bands, and Weyl fermions within a single material family, facilitating the development of topological and spintronic applications.

Title: Emerging correlations between diffusing particles evolving via simultaneous resetting with memory
Authors: Denis Boyer, Satya N. Majumdar
Abstract: We study the emergence of correlations between $N$ components of the position of a diffusive walker in $N$ dimensions that starts at the origin and resets to previously visited sites with certain probabilities. This is equivalent to $N$ independent one-dimensional diffusive processes starting from the origin and being subject to simultaneous resetting to positions visited in the past. Resetting follows a memory kernel that interpolates between resetting to the origin only, and the preferential relocation model, a path-dependent process which is highly non-Markov. For weak memory, the correlation coefficient between two components of the $N$-dimensional process grows monotonously with time and tends at late times to a constant bounded by $1/5$, the value corresponding to the non-equilibrium steady state of resetting to the origin. When memory is sufficiently long-ranged, the correlation is non-monotonous and reaches a maximum at a finite time before converging to its asymptotic value. These two regimes are separated by a critical memory parameter value. In the limiting case of the preferential relocation model, the components become uncorrelated at both short and long times, but the correlation vanishes logarithmically slowly at late times. The emergence of correlations through resetting can be described in a unified way in all cases by noticing that the processes are conditionally independent and identically distributed, even in the presence of memory. In the non-Markovian case, the conditioning parameter is the duration of a Brownian path composed of several parts of the full trajectory of a fixed duration $t$.

Title: Magnetic transition in B2 Al-Cr-Co alloys
Authors: Haireguli Aihemaiti, Esmat Dastanpour, Shashank Chaturvedi, Shuo Huang, Anders Bergman, Levente Vitos
Abstract: Using Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations and Monte-Carlo (MC) simulations, we investigate the recently reported magnetic transition in B2 Al-Cr-Co alloys. The Cr sublattice is alloyed with different amounts of Co in the antiferromagnetic (AFM) B2 AlCr binary alloy and the resulting exchange interactions are analyzed within the Heisenberg Hamiltonian framework. DFT results reveal that at low Co concentrations the system favors the AFM order, while at high Co contents a transition to the ferromagnetic (FM) state is observed. Within the FM stability field, the Curie temperature (TC), obtained within the mean-field approximation, is below ~160 K and decreases with Co concentration. The calculated exchange parameters evolve systematically with Co content, and the trends are consistent with the DFT total energies. The magnetic configurations obtained from MC simulations follow the DFT results at low Cr levels but predict a spin-glass behavior for alloys containing more than 40 at.% Co on Cr sublattice. These findings provide a fundamental understanding of how the chemistry-driven changes in exchange interactions affect magnetism in the B2 Al-Cr-Co alloys.

Title: First-principles study of phase stability and magnetic properties of B2 AlCr, AlMn, AlFe, AlCo and AlNi aluminides
Authors: Haireguli Aihemaiti, Esmat Dastanpour, Anders Bergman, Levente Vitos
Abstract: Using ab initio Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, we investigate the electronic structure, phase stability, and magnetic properties of equiatomic binary alloys between Al and 3d magnetic transition elements (Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni). Thermodynamically, all five binary aluminides are more stable in the ordered B2 phase than in the disordered body centered cubic phase, and Co is found to be the strongest B2 forming element with Al. The AlCo and AlNi compounds with B2 structure are verified to be non-magnetic, whereas AlFe turns out to be weakly magnetic, which is consistent with other DFT calculations employing similar exchange-correlation approximations. Magnetic simulations based on the Heisenberg Hamiltonian predict an antiferromagnetic ground state for the hypothetical B2 AlCr, which is also confirmed by direct DFT calculations. Doping AlCr with Co leads to an antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic transition, where ferromagnetism is to a large extent attributed to Cr atoms. The phase stability and magnetic trends are explained using electronic structure arguments. The present findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the phase stability and magnetic properties of AlX binary alloys, providing insights into the formation mechanisms of the B2 structure with 3d magnetic transition metals.

Title: Unravelling the oxygen influence in cubic bixbyite In$_2$O$_3$ on Raman active phonon modes by isotope studies
Authors: Johannes Feldl, Roland Gillen, Janina Maultzsch, Alexandra Papadogianni, Joe Kler, Zbigniew Galazka, Oliver Bierwagen, Manfred Ramsteiner
Abstract: In this study, we performed comprehensive investigations on the Raman active phonon modes in cubic bixbyite In$_2$O$_3$, an important oxide based, wide-bandgap semiconductor. Fundamental insights into the lattice dynamics are revealed, by determining the atomistic contribution to all modes and their frequencies by density functional perturbation theory calculations. Those simulations were performed for different compositions of $^{16}$O and $^{18}$O isotope ratios, including their pure states. An increasing red-shift of the mode frequencies with increasing $^{18}$O content for all modes, due to the increased atomic mass, is revealed. For the seven lowest energy modes, this relative shift is below 1%, whereas for the remaining 15 higher energetic modes a shift of about 5.5% was identified. All modes have energy contributions of both indium and oxygen lattice sites, except for one, which corresponds to a pure oxygen vibrational state. Applying Raman spectroscopy, those results could be verified experimentally with excellent agreement. Investigated samples consisted of a bulk single crystal with $^{16}$O isotopes and a MBE grown thin film as the $^{18}$O sample. Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry confirms the purity of the oxygen isotope in the sample. These isotopologue studies allow for a direct experimental access to fundamental material properties in cubic In$_2$O$_3$ by means of Raman spectroscopy. For example, we speculate, that the presence of oxygen vacancies in In$_2$O$_3$ would result in a shift of modes that are dominated by O-vibrations, e. g., $E_{g}^{(4)}$ or $A_{g}^{(4)}$, towards lower frequencies.

Title: Highly Tunable Phonon Polaritons via Metal Intercalation
Authors: Mariia Stepanova, Minh Ngo, Mashnoon Alam Sakib, Wills Harris, Joshua Bocanegra, Ruqian Wu, Kristie J. Koski, Maxim R. Shcherbakov
Abstract: Phonon polaritons in van der Waals crystals offer mid-infrared light confinement deep below the diffraction limit, making them promising for nanophotonics applications. However, the practical use of phonon polaritons remains limited, in part due to the lack of precise control over the phonon polariton dispersion, as crystal lattice vibrations are often inert to external stimuli. Here, we address this challenge by zerovalent metal intercalation of $\alpha$-MoO$_3$. Photo-induced force microscopy shows that introducing tin into the van der Waals gap modulates the phonon polariton dispersion by up to $38.5\pm0.5\%$, which is the highest amount of tunability among non-mechanical modulation approaches, to the best of our knowledge. Intercalation with various metal species preserves the phonon polariton lifetimes, while modulating the dielectric permittivity in agreement with the density functional theory and analytical calculations. Our results establish metal intercalation as a practical route to reconfigurable mid-infrared nanophotonics.

Title: Nonlinear phononic slidetronics
Authors: Pooja Rani, Dominik M. Juraschek
Abstract: Van der Waals ferroelectrics are conventionally switched by sliding the different layers between stacking orders with opposing electric polarizations. Ultrashort laser pulses have been proposed to launch shear modes and induce switching, with often unfeasible large pulse energies however. Here, we demonstrate switching of ferroelectricity in bilayer hexagonal boron nitride through nonlinearly excited phonons. We show that the efficiencies of conventional coherent phonon excitation mechanisms, including infrared absorption and Raman scattering techniques, are too low to overcome the energy barrier separating the two ferroelectric states. We demonstrate instead that excitation of high-frequency intralayer modes leads to a tilting of the interlayer potential-energy landscape that enables changing the stacking order. Our results provide an avenue towards efficient phononic slidetronics, enabling ultrafast control of the stacking order in van der Waals materials.

Title: Highly Efficient Functionalization of hBN with Lithium Oxalate: A Multifunctional Platform for Composites, Ion Transport, and Spin Labeling

Poluektov, Ira D. Bloom, Fulya Dogan, Margit Kovács, Ferenc Simon, Gábor Szalontai, Leon Shaw, László Forró, Károly Németh
Abstract: The development of multifunctional solid-state materials is key to advancing lithium-ion batteries with enhanced safety and simplified architectures. Here, we report a scalable, highly efficient (near $100\%$), solvent-free mechanochemical synthesis of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) functionalized with lithium oxalate (Li$_2$C$_2$O$_4$), yielding a novel lamellar composite that functions both as a lithium-ion conductor and separator. The high-energy milling process promotes exfoliation of hBN and covalent attachment of oxalate groups at edge and defect sites, forming a brown, nanocrystalline material with uniform lithium distribution. The composite exhibits room-temperature ionic and negligible electronic conductivity, thermal stability at least up to $350~^{\circ}$C, and hosts stable free radicals enabling its use as a spin label. The synthesis produces no byproducts and can be extended towards lithium doping via secondary mechanochemical steps, creating highly doped, chemically stable phases that host additional Li for ionic conduction. These results introduce a new class of lithium-rich, boron nitride-based solids for solid-state batteries, combining ion conduction, mechanical robustness, and thermal resilience in a single material platform.

Title: Dynamics and formation of antiferromagnetic textures in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ single crystal
Authors: M. G. Kim, S. Boney, L. Burgard, L. Rutowski, C. Mazzoli
Abstract: We report coherent X-ray imaging of antiferromagnetic (AFM) domains and domain walls in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$, an intrinsic AFM topological insulator. This technique enables direct visualization of domain morphology without reconstruction algorithms, allowing us to resolve antiphase domain walls as distinct dark lines arising from the A-type AFM structure. The wall width is determined to be 550(30) nm, in good agreement with earlier magnetic force microscopy results. The temperature dependence of the AFM order parameter extracted from our images closely follows previous neutron scattering data. Remarkably, however, we find a pronounced hysteresis in the evolution of domains and domain walls: upon cooling, dynamic reorganizations occur within a narrow $\sim$1 K interval below $T_N$, whereas upon warming, the domain configuration remains largely unchanged until AFM order disappears. These findings reveal a complex energy landscape in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$, governed by the interplay of exchange, anisotropy, and domain-wall energies, and underscore the critical role of AFM domain-wall dynamics in shaping its physical properties.

Title: Reciprocal swimming in granular media: the role of jamming and swimmer inertia
Authors: Amir Nazemi, Hongyi Xiao
Abstract: We use particle simulations to reveal two distinct propulsion mechanisms for a scallop-like swimmer to locomote itself in granular media by reciprocally flapping its wings. Based on the discrete element method, we examine the kinematics and contact forces of particles near the swimmer to identify jamming effects induced by the swimmer in a frictional granular medium, which are less intense during the opening stroke than the closing. This broken symmetry is quantified by the difference in the number of strong particle contact forces formed during opening and closing, which shows a linear relation with the swimmer's net displacement across various swimmer and medium configurations, all favoring the opening stroke. We identify a secondary propulsion mechanism in a dynamic regime with significant swimmer inertia, as the flapping period approaches the coasting time for a moving swimmer to come to rest under the medium resistance. In this case, the swimmer's net displacement is correlated to the ratio between these two time scales, and the swimming direction favors the closing stroke due to the smaller medium resistance as the swimmer coasts with closed wings.

Title: Machine Learning Enables Optimization of Diamond for Quantum Applications

Abstract: Spins in solid-state materials, molecules, and other chemical systems have the potential to impact the fields of quantum sensing, communication, simulation, and computing. In particular, color centers in diamond, such as negatively charged nitrogen vacancy (NV$^-$) and silicon vacancy centers (SiV$^-$), are emerging as quantum platforms poised for transition to commercial devices. A key enabler stems from the semiconductor-like platform that can be tailored at the time of growth. The large growth parameter space makes it challenging to use intuition to optimize growth conditions for quantum performance. In this paper, we use supervised machine learning to train regression models using different synthesis parameters in over 100 quantum diamond samples. We train models to optimize NV$^-$ defects in diamond for high sensitivity magnetometry. Importantly, we utilize a magnetic-field sensitivity figure of merit (FOM) for NV magnetometry and use Bayesian optimization to identify critical growth parameters that lead to a 300% improvement over an average sample and a 55% improvement over the previous champion sample. Furthermore, using Shapley importance rankings, we gain new physical insights into the most impactful growth and post-processing parameters, namely electron irradiation dose, diamond seed depth relative to the plasma, seed miscut angle, and reactor nitrogen concentration. As various quantum devices can have significantly different material requirements, advanced growth techniques such as plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PE-CVD) can provide the ability to tailor material development specifically for quantum applications.

Title: Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless Transition and Multifractal Critical Phase in Two-Dimensional Quantum Percolation
Authors: W. S. Oliveira, J. Pimentel de Lima, F. A. Pinheiro, R. R. dos Santos
Abstract: We present a numerical study of the two-dimensional quantum percolation model, revealing that a critical region with multifractal eigenstates mediates the transition from localized to delocalized states. By analyzing the mean level ratio and participation entropy, we identify two distinct transitions: a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition at the classical percolation threshold, separating the localized and critical phases, and a power-law-type transition at a larger concentration, marking the onset of full delocalization. The critical phase is characterized by multifractal eigenstates, as evidenced by the generalized fractal dimension and multifractal spectrum. Altogether, our results establish that in the marginal two-dimensional case, the Anderson impurity model and the quantum percolation model belong to different universality classes.

Title: Electric-Field-Tunable Luttinger compensated antiferromagnetism in double CrCl2 chains
Authors: Deping Guo, Weihan Zhang, Canbo Zong, Cong Wang, Wei Ji
Abstract: Luttinger compensated antiferromagnets (LcAFMs), combining spin polarization with vanishing net magnetization, offering distinct advantages for next-generation spintronic applications. Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that conventional antiferromagnetic CrCl2 double chains can be transformed into one-dimensional LcAFMs under an external electric field, exhibiting pronounced isotropic spin splitting. The magnitude of the splitting, as well as the band gap, can be effectively tuned by both in-plane and out-of-plane fields, thereby providing greater controllability than in two-dimensional counterparts. To further enhance the tunability, we design a nearly lattice-matched CrCl2/MoTe2 heterostructure and uncover that interfacial charge transfer generates a built-in electric field, inducing spin splitting comparable to that driven by external fields. These results establish interfacial engineering as a highly efficient route to realize and manipulate LcAFM states in low-dimensional magnets, expanding the design principles for spintronic functionalities at the nanoscale.

Title: Suppression of Thin-Film Thermal Conductivity due to Surface Roughness
Authors: Michimasa Morita, Junichiro Shiomi
Abstract: Understanding thermal transport in silicon nanostructures is crucial for effective thermal management in semiconductor devices. In such nanostructures, boundary scattering can significantly reduce thermal conductivity. Diffusive boundary scattering explains the experimentally observed thickness dependence of thermal conductivity in thin films with thicknesses of tens of nanometers; however, introducing surface roughness further reduces the thermal conductivity, which falls far below the theoretical lower limit. In this study, we calculated the thermal conductivity and phonon transport properties of rough thin films with thicknesses of up to 25 nm using anharmonic lattice dynamics and investigated the mechanisms underlying the suppression of thermal conductivity arising from surface roughness. We found that in ultrathin films with rough surfaces, thermal conductivity was suppressed by a reduction in group velocity caused by hybridization with surface-localized modes, as well as a reduction in relaxation time due to the modulation of the anharmonic interatomic force constants of surface atoms. The reduction in group velocity significantly suppressed thermal conductivity across a wide range of thicknesses and surface-roughness values. In contrast, the reduction in relaxation time exhibited strong thickness dependence. Thus, this relaxation-time reduction should be considered in ultrathin films with roughness of approximately 0.1 nm and thicknesses below 5 nm. These thermal-conductivity suppression mechanisms due to surface roughness were not considered in the boundary-scattering model, resulting in an overestimation of the thermal conductivity of the roughened thin films by up to approximately 100%.

Title: Exact time-evolving resonant states for open double quantum-dot systems with spin degrees of freedom
Authors: Akinori Nishino, Naomichi Hatano
Abstract: We study time-evolving resonant states in an open double quantum-dot system, taking into account spin degrees of freedom as well as both on-dot and interdot Coulomb interactions. We exactly derived a non-Hermite effective Hamiltonian acting on the subspace of two quantum dots, where the non-Hermiticity arises from an effect of infinite external leads connected to the quantum dots. By diagonalizing the effective Hamiltonian, we identify four types of two-body resonant states. For the initial states of localized two electrons with opposite spins on the quantum dots, we exactly solve the time-dependent Schroedinger equation and obtain time-evolving two-body resonant states. The time-evolving resonant states are normalizable since their wave function grows exponentially only inside a finite space interval that expands in time with electron velocity. By using the exact solution, we analyze the survival and transition probabilities of localized two electrons on the quantum dots.

Title: Revealing Liquid-Gas Transitions with Finite-Size Scaling in Confined Systems
Authors: Chong Zha, Yanshuang Chen, Cheng-Ran Du, Peng Tan, Yuliang Jin
Abstract: The application of an external field often renders empirical criteria for identifying liquid-gas phase transitions ambiguous. Here, we demonstrate that the finite-size scaling of the density profile provides a definitive criterion to distinguish liquid-gas coexistence from a single fluid phase in field-confined systems. Our scaling method collapses the density profiles of different system sizes onto a single master curve for a one-phase system, while causing the profiles to intersect at the interface in a two-phase system. We validate this theoretical proposal through experiments and simulations of two model systems: colloidal suspensions under gravity and/or two-dimensional complex plasmas confined by a central potential. Our method is broadly applicable for detecting liquid-gas phase transitions in laboratory systems where external fields are inherent.

Title: Effects of successive annealing on high-field electrical transport and the upper critical field in S-substituted FeTe
Authors: Ryosuke Kurihara, Satoshi Hakamada, Masaki Kondo, Ryuji Okazaki, Masashi Tokunaga, Hiroshi Yaguchi
Abstract: Since iron-based superconductors have been discovered, many scientists have focused on their characteristic properties, such as an unconventional mechanism and a high upper critical field. Sulphur-substituted FeTe compounds are one of the members of the iron-based superconductors; however, chemical processes, such as O$_2$ annealing, are needed to induce superconductivity because of the existence of excess iron in as-grown crystals. Thus, the removal of excess iron and the obtaining of clean sulphur-substituted FeTe can play a key role in the understanding of the superconducting properties and the application to the superconducting devices. In this study, we present the successive annealing effects on sulphur-substituted FeTe compounds to investigate the electrical transport properties under high magnetic fields. Our measurements show that successive annealing processes improve the electrical transport properties in the superconducting states under magnetic fields. The removal of excess iron acting as magnetic impurities is indicated by the improvement of the upper critical field and its analysis.

Title: Enhanced magnetic and optical properties of oxygen deficient TiO$_{2-δ}$ nanoparticles synthesized by environment-friendly green route using whole plant extract of Phyllanthus niruri
Authors: Latika Mishra, Vinod Kumar Dwivedi, Vishal Kumar Chakradhary, Akila G. Prabhudessai, Shamshun Nehar
Abstract: We report magnetic, optical and oxidation states of oxygen deficient TiO$_{2-\delta}$ nanoparticles (NPs) synthesized by environment-friendly green route using Phyllanthus niruri (PN) whole plant extract instead of leaf extract. Rietveld refinement of room temperature XRD pattern confirms the formation of pure phase anatase TiO$_2$ crystals in a tetragonal structure with space group I41/amd. TEM and SEM microstructure shows agglomerated spherical shape NPs exhibiting average particle size $\sim$ 35~nm. FTIR result confirms the presence of biomolecules and functional group attached to the surface of TiO$_2$ NPs. The core level XPS of O-1s and Ti-2p confirms the presence of oxygen vacancies that leads to the mixed oxidation states of Ti (Ti$^{4+}$ and Ti$^{3+}$). UV-vis result shows a strong absorption peak ($\sim$ 250~nm) along with reduced optical band gap energy E$_g$ $\sim$ 2.75~eV, possibly arises due to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) caused by lower band gap energy emerging from oxygen vacancies. Magnetization as a function of applied magnetic field shows ferromagnetic nature at room temperature [M$_S$ $\sim$ 0.029~emu/g and H$_C$ $\sim$ 0.0143~T]. The observed ferromagnetic behaviour can be understood by virtual hopping of electrons from Ti$^{3+}$(3d$^1$) to Ti$^{4+}$(3d$^0$)-sites, however, vice versa is prohibited.

Title: Electromagnetic Responses of Vortex Lattices in Unconventional Superconductors
Authors: Ryusuke Ikeda, Yuto Yokota
Abstract: The electro-magnetic responses of ordered vortex lattices in unconventional superconductors are studied in a high field approximation. In the cases with a vortex lattice formed within the lowest Landau level of the superconducting order parameter (OP) such as a conventional s-wave paired system with a single OP and a nonchiral spin triplet paired one with multiple components of OPs, the vanishing of the superfluid stiffness for a gauge field disturbance perpendicular to the applied uniform magnetic field is found to be ensured only for the vortex lattice structures minimizing the free energy. The notion of the vanishing superfluid stiff ness ensured by minimization of the free energy is found to be satisfied in a more complex d-wave pairing case where the vortex lattice in lower fields has an anisotropic structure de viated from the six-fold hexagonal symmetry. Interestingly, such an anisotropy in the vortex lattice structure of a d-wave paired superconductor is reflected not in the resulting vortex flow conductivities obtained after minimizing the free energy but in the elastic energy describing the harmonic fluctuation around the vortex lattice state. Relevance of the obtained results to the vortex pinning effects are discussed.

Title: Reinforcement learning-guided optimization of critical current in high-temperature superconductors
Authors: Mouyang Cheng, Qiwei Wan, Bowen Yu, Eunbi Rha, Michael J Landry, Mingda Li
Abstract: High-temperature superconductors are essential for next-generation energy and quantum technologies, yet their performance is often limited by the critical current density ($J_c$), which is strongly influenced by microstructural defects. Optimizing $J_c$ through defect engineering is challenging due to the complex interplay of defect type, density, and spatial correlation. Here we present an integrated workflow that combines reinforcement learning (RL) with time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) simulations to autonomously identify optimal defect configurations that maximize $J_c$. In our framework, TDGL simulations generate current-voltage characteristics to evaluate $J_c$, which serves as the reward signal that guides the RL agent to iteratively refine defect configurations. We find that the agent discovers optimal defect densities and correlations in two-dimensional thin-film geometries, enhancing vortex pinning and $J_c$ relative to the pristine thin-film, approaching 60\% of theoretical depairing limit with up to 15-fold enhancement compared to random initialization. This RL-driven approach provides a scalable strategy for defect engineering, with broad implications for advancing HTS applications in fusion magnets, particle accelerators, and other high-field technologies.

Title: Suppression of quantized heat flow by the dielectric response of a compressible strip at the quantum Hall edge
Authors: Eugene V. Sukhorukov, Adrien Tomà
Abstract: We develop a unified perturbative framework for energy transport along a chiral quantum Hall (QH) edge coupled to a disordered, compressible strip. Treating the strip as a generic linear response environment characterized by its retarded susceptibility $\chi_q^R(k,\omega)$, we derive leading-order interaction corrections to both the edge heat flux and the plasmon spectrum. Two complementary regimes are analyzed: (i) a gapped, local dielectric response with finite-range coupling, which yields a universal negative $T^4$ correction to the quantized heat flux and a corresponding convex cubic term in the plasmon dispersion; and (ii) a hydrodynamic (diffusive) response with relaxation, producing a crossover from $T^4$ to $T^{3/2}$ scaling and a change of sign in the correction. The resulting backaction reduces the plasmon group velocity and can suppress the apparent thermal conductance by an amount consistent with experiment. Importantly, the total heat flux remains quantized: the apparent deficit in the plasmon contribution corresponds to an induced energy flow within the compressible strip, representing a form of heat drag between chiral and nonchiral modes. The framework thus provides a microscopic and quantitatively plausible explanation of the ``missing heat flux'' anomaly observed at QH edges and links its transport signature to the nonlinearity of the plasmon spectrum.

Title: Electric Field-Induced Kerr Rotation on Metallic Surfaces
Authors: Farzad Mahfouzi, Mark D. Stiles, Paul M. Haney
Abstract: We use a combination of density functional theory calculations and optical modeling to establish that the electric field-induced Kerr rotation in metallic thin films has contributions from both non-equilibrium orbital moment accumulation (arising from the orbital Edelstein effect) and a heretofore overlooked surface Pockels effect. The Kerr rotation associated with orbital accumulation has been studied in previous works and is largely due to the dc electric field-induced change of the electron distribution function. In contrast, the surface Pockels effect is largely due to the dc field-induced change to the wave functions. Both of these contributions arise from the dual mirror symmetry breaking from the surface and from the dc applied field. Our calculations show that the resulting Kerr rotation is due to the dc electric field modification of the optical conductivity within a couple of nanometers from the surface, consistent with the dependence on the local mirror symmetry breaking at the surface. For thin films of Pt, our calculations show that the relative contributions of the orbital Edelstein and surface Pockels effects are comparable, and that they have different effects on Kerr rotation of $s$ and $p$ polarized light, $\theta_K^s$ and $\theta_K^p$. The orbital Edelstein effect yields similar values of $\theta_K^s$ and $\theta_K^p$, while the surface Pockels effect leads to opposing values of $\theta_K^s$ and $\theta_K^p$.

Title: Paradoxical Topological Soliton Lattice in Anisotropic Frustrated Chiral Magnets
Authors: Sayan Banik, Nikolai S. Kiselev, Ashis K. Nandy
Abstract: Two-dimensional chiral magnets are known to host a variety of skyrmions, characterized by an integer topological charge. However, these systems typically favor uniform lattices as a thermodynamically stable phase composed of either skyrmions (Q = -1) or antiskyrmions (Q = 1). In isotropic chiral magnets, skyrmion-antiskyrmion coexistence is typically transient due to mutual annihilation, making the observation of a stable, long-range ordered lattice a significant challenge. Here, we address this challenge by demonstrating a skyrmion-antiskyrmion lattice as a magnetic field-induced topological ground state in chiral magnets with competing anisotropic interactions, specifically Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and frustrated exchange interactions. This unique lattice exhibits a net-zero global topological charge due to the balanced populations of skyrmions and antiskyrmions. Furthermore, density functional theory and spin-lattice simulations identify 2Fe/InSb(110) as an ideal candidate material for realizing this phase. This finding reveals new possibilities for manipulating magnetic solitons and establishes anisotropic frustrated chiral magnets as a promising material class for future spintronic applications.

Title: Excitation of Confined Bulk Plasmons in metallic nanoparticles by penetrating electron beams within a non-local analytical approach
Authors: Mattin Urbieta, Edu Ogando, Alberto Rivacoba, Javier Aizpurua, Nerea Zabala
Abstract: Using a linear hydrodynamic model (HDM) we investigate theoretically the interaction between penetrating electron beams and sub-5 nm metallic spherical nanoparticles (NPs), and provide an analytical expression of the electron energy loss (EEL) probability including non-local effects in the response of the confined electron gas. We focus on the characterization of the longitudinal plasmon excitations, or confined bulk plasmons (CBPs), which cannot be addressed within local dielectric frameworks, and show that their excitation is highly sensitive to the impact parameter and kinetic energy of the incident electron beam, as well as to the NP's size. In contrast to the local approach, our decription captures a blueshift of the bulk plasmon envelope (BPE) with decreasing NP size and a blueshift with increasing impact parameter. Moreover, it predicts a threshold impact parameter, or minimum electron path inside the NP, to efficiently activate a set of CBPs. Exploiting the multipolar description of the CBPs we identify the underlying symmetry rules governing their excitation by electron beams, and correlate the observed blueshift of the BPE for increasing impact parameters with the excitation of higher-order CBPs. Dispersion of the CBPs with decreasing NP sizes further increases this impact parameter dependent blueshift of the BPE and also explains the decrease in the impact parameter threshold.

Title: Sensitive detection of the Rydberg transition in trapped electrons on liquid helium using radio-frequency reflectometry
Authors: Jui-Yin Lin, Tomoyuki Tani, Mikhail Belianchikov, Denis Konstantinov
Abstract: Radio-frequency reflectometry, which probes small changes in the electrical impedance of a device, provides a useful method for sensitive and fast detection of dynamic processes in quantum systems. Here, we use this method to detect excitation of the quantized motional (Rydberg) states of trapped electrons on liquid helium. The Rydberg transition in an ensemble of electrons is detected by a change in the impedance of an rf circuit in response to a pulsed-modulated microwave excitation. The result is compared with an independent impedance measurement on the same electron system modulated by an electrostatic potential and with a numerical simulation using the Green's function method. Additionally, it is found that the rf response to the Rydberg resonance can be strongly enhanced by a resonant mode of the electron collective motion. Our results suggest that the observed response to the Rydberg resonance must be attributed to the lateral motion of microwave-excited electrons rather than the quantum capacitance associated with their vertical displacement, as was recently reported. Our theoretical analysis based on the solution of the master equation shows that the quantum capacitance would show a response which is drastically different from what is observed in the experiments.

Title: Magnetoelectric effect of multiferroic metals
Authors: Zefei Han, Haojin Wang, Yuanchang Li
Abstract: Much is known about the magnetoelectric effect of multiferroic insulators, yet little is understood about multiferroic metals. In this work, we employ first-principles calculations to identify the sliding van der Waals bilayer $1T$-NbTe$_2$ as a multiferroic metal, where in-plane metallicity coexists with out-of-plane polarization and magnetism. It exhibits linear magnetoelectric response, originating from direct spin-charge interactions as a result of external field-modulated Fermi energy, which differs from the spin-charge-lattice or spin-orbit coupling mechanisms in multiferroic insulators. We derive a universal formula for magnetoelectric coupling parameters of multiferroic metals, which highlights the crucial role of interlayer dielectric permittivity in enhancing performance. Our work provides insights for exploring magnetoelectric coupling mechanisms and designing functional materials with strong magnetoelectric coupling.

Title: Bidirectional Photoinduced Carrier Transfer in Fluorinated Quasi-2D Perovskites Governing Enhanced Photocurrent Generation
Authors: Soumya Halder, Koushik Gayen, Nagendra S. Kamath, Suman Kalyan Pal
Abstract: Quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) metal halide perovskites exhibit rich phase heterogeneity that profoundly influences light-matter interactions and charge transport. However, the fundamental mechanisms governing carrier transfer across distinct phases remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate effective electron-hole separation in fluorinated multilayered quasi-2D perovskite films nominally prepared for three layers, using femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. The films are revealed to comprise a heterogeneous phase distribution (with 1, 2, 3 layers and bulk) naturally stacked along the growth direction. Our ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements, show the type-two band alignment between the small-n (layer number) phases and the bulk. This alignment drives charge separation via both direct and sequential carrier transfer mechanisms, whereby electrons preferentially migrate into the bulk domains while holes accumulate in the small-n layers, extending even to single layer phase-a process only rarely observed in previous studies. The nearly symmetric transfer times of electrons and holes yield an efficient and balanced spatial separation of carriers. Global target analysis employing a carrier transfer model quantitatively reproduces the spectral evolution, providing a rigorous validation of the mechanism. Nonetheless, we found photocurrent enhancement in the diode devices of this quasi-2D perovskite as a consequence of the efficient transfer of photocarriers in the opposite directions. This work delivers a comprehensive picture of interphase charge transfer in fluorinated quasi-2D perovskites and highlights strategies to engineer directional separation pathways for high-performance photovoltaic, optoelectronic, and quantum devices.

Title: Light induced Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition in Superconducting Films
Authors: Tien-Tien Yeh, Evan Wilson, Mikael Fogelström, Alexander Balatsky
Abstract: We report a light-driven non-equilibrium vortex Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition in a superconductor. We use a time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau model to demonstrate vortex-antivortex deconfinement via light induced fields. The transformation occurs independently of thermal fluctuations and is viewed as a quantum phase transition. The resulting phase map mirrors QCD phase diagram, delineating confined, premelted, and fully deconfined vortex phases. The nature of these phases is discussed. Transitions between phases are governed by light induced depairing and phase fluctuations, establishing a new class of light-induced topological transitions.

Title: Normal Dirac Semimetal Phase and Zeeman-Induced Topological Fermi Arc in PtSr5
Authors: Inkyou Lee, Churlhi Lyi, Youngkuk Kim
Abstract: Pt-Sr binary intermetallics encompass a broad range of stoichiometries and crystal structures, stabilized by complex bonding and multivalent chemistry. The Sr-rich end member, PtSr5, is recently identified via artificial-intelligence-guided materials design as a body-centered tetragonal compound (I4/m). Using first-principles calculations, we show that PtSr5 hosts a Dirac semimetal phase with trivial Z2 topology, classified as a normal Dirac semimetal. A symmetry-indicator analysis based on parity eigenvalues at the eight time-reversal-invariant momenta confirms that all Z2 invariants-evaluated on time-reversal-invariant two-dimensional subspaces of momentum space with a direct band gap-are trivial, thereby establishing the topologically trivial nature of the Dirac semimetal phase. Nonetheless, our calculations reveal that applying an external Zeeman magnetic field along the z-axis drives the system into a Weyl semimetal phase, as corroborated by characteristic changes in the computed surface states. This work demonstrates the tunability of topological phases in PtSr5 via external perturbations and highlights the effectiveness of AI-based materials exploration in discovering new quantum materials.

Title: The Gravitational Aspect of Information: The Physical Reality of Asymmetric "Distance"
Authors: Tomoi Koide, Armin van de Venn
Abstract: We demonstrate that when a Brownian bridge is physically constrained to be canonical, its time evolution becomes identical to an m-geodesic on the statistical manifold of Gaussian distributions. This finding provides strong evidence that, akin to general relativity where free particles follow geodesics, purely random processes also follow ``straight lines" defined by the geometry of information. This geometric principle is a direct consequence of the dually flat structure inherent to information geometry, originating from the asymmetry of informational ``distance" (divergence) leading to the violation of metric compatibility. Our results suggest a geometric foundation for randomness and open the door to an equivalence principle for information.

Title: Hilbert Space Fragmentation in Hardcore Bose and Fermi Hubbard Models on Generalized Lieb Lattices
Authors: D. K. He, Z. Song
Abstract: We study the Hilbert space fragmentation (HSF) in hardcore Bose and Fermi Hubbard models in the framework of the restricted spectrum generating algebra (RSGA). We present a family of hardcore Bose-Hubbard models with repulsive density-density interactions on a generalized Lieb lattice. We show that this system possesses the RSGA structure in the large interaction strength limit, exhibiting quantum HSF. It allows us to construct a set of exact condensate eigenstates, possessing off diagonal long-range order. Based on numerical simulations conducted on several representative lattices, we demonstrate the existence of weak fragmentations when the constraints are not exact. As applications, we also studied the connection between HSF and RSGA in modified fermionic Hubbard models, where the {\eta}-pairing states are shown to be energy towers, acting as quantum scars.

Title: Entropy of the cell fluid model with Curie-Weiss interaction
Authors: R.V. Romanik, O.A. Dobush, M.P. Kozlovskii, I.V. Pylyuk, M.A. Shpot
Abstract: Entropy of the cell fluid model with Curie-Weiss interaction is obtained in analytical form as a function of temperature and chemical potential. A parametric equation is derived representing the entropy as a function of density. Features of both the entropy per particle and the entropy per cell are investigated at the entropy-density and entropy-chemical potential planes. The considered cell model is a multiple-occupancy model and possesses an infinite sequence of first-order phase transitions at sufficiently low temperatures. We find that the entropy exhibits pronounced minima at around integer-valued particle densities, which may be a generic feature of multiple-occupancy models.

Title: Coulomb correlated multi-particle states of weakly confining GaAs quantum dots
Authors: Petr Klenovský
Abstract: We compute the electronic and emission properties of Coulomb-correlated multi-particle states (X$^0$, X$^\pm$, XX) in weakly confining GaAs/AlGaAs quantum dots using an 8-band $\mathbf{k}\!\cdot\!\mathbf{p}$ model coupled to continuum elasticity and configuration interaction (CI). We evaluate polarization-resolved oscillator strengths and radiative rates both in the dipole approximation (DA) and in a quasi-electrostatic beyond-dipole (BDA) longitudinal formulation implemented via a Poisson reformulation exactly equivalent to the dyadic Green-tensor kernel. For the dots studied, BDA yields lifetimes in quantitative agreement with experiment, e.g., $\tau^X=0.279\,\mathrm{ns}$ vs $0.267\,\mathrm{ns}$ (exp.) and $\tau^{XX}=0.101\,\mathrm{ns}$ vs $0.115\,\mathrm{ns}$ (exp.). The framework also reproduces electric-field tuning of the multi-particle electronic structure and emission -- including the indistinguishability inferred from $P=\tau^X/(\tau^X+\tau^{XX})$ -- and we assess sensitivity to CI-basis size and to electron-electron and hole-hole exchange.

Title: Free energy of the gas of spin 1/2 fermions beyond the second order and the Stoner phase transition
Authors: Oskar Grocholski, Piotr H. Chankowski
Abstract: In the previous work we have developed a systematic thermal (imaginary time) perturbative expansion and applying it to the relevant effective field theory computed, up to the second order in the interaction, the free energy $F$ of the diluted gas of (nonrelativistic) spin $1/2$ fermions interacting through a spin-independent repulsive two-body potential. Here we extend this computations to higher orders: assuming that the only relevant parameter specifying the interaction potential is the $s$-wave scattering length $a_0$, we compute the complete order $(k_{\rm F}a_0)^3$ ($k_{\rm F}$ is the Fermi wave vector) contribution to the system's free energy as a function of the numbers $N_+$ and $N_-$ of spin up and spin down fermions (i.e. as a function of its polarization) and the temperature $T$. We also extend the computation beyond a fixed order by resumming the contributions to $F$ of two infinite sets of Feynman diagrams: the so called particle-particle rings and the particle-hole rings. We find that including the second one of these two contributions has a dramatic consequence for the transition of the system from the paramagnetic to the ferromagnetic phase (the so called Stoner phase transition): in this approximation the phase transition simply disappears.

Title: Switching between Skyrmions and Yoshimori Spin Spirals via Li Absorption in Janus Magnets
Authors: Xinyuan Jiang, Jian Wu, Weiyi Pan
Abstract: Chiral magnetic textures have attracted considerable attention owing to their topological properties and potential applications in spintronic devices. Here, we employ first-principles calculations together with atomic spin dynamics simulations to explore the switching between skyrmions and Yoshimori-type spin spirals induced by Li adsorption in Janus two-dimensional (2D) CrTeSe. We show that selective Li adsorption on either the Se- or Te-terminated surface stabilizes distinct magnetic phases: Li adsorption on the Se side favors a Yoshimori-type spin spiral, whereas adsorption on the Te side stabilizes the skyrmionic state. This contrast originates from site-dependent modifications of exchange interactions, magnetic anisotropy (MA), and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). In addition, the response of magnetic textures to out-of-plane magnetic fields differs strongly between the two systems. These results demonstrate that surface adsorption provides an effective strategy for reversible control of chiral magnetic states in 2D magnets, while also offering fundamental insights into the competing interactions that govern the stability of skyrmions and Yoshimori spin spirals. Our findings highlight the potential of Janus 2D materials as a versatile platform for engineering tunable spintronic devices.

Title: Novel A2CrH6 (A = Ca, Sr, Ba) hydrides explored by first-principles calculations for hydrogen storage applications
Authors: Zakaria El Fatouaki, El Mustapha Hrida, Abderahhim Jabar, Abdellah Tahiri, Mohamed Idiri
Abstract: A theoretical study of a number of properties of A2CrH6 (where A = Ba, Sr, and Ca) hydride perovskites with the Cambridge Serial Total Energy Package (CASTEP). These include structural, hydrogen storage, mechanical, phonon, thermodynamic, electronic, and optical properties. The lattice constants of the compounds studied are in the range from 7.220 Å to 8.082 Å, and they exhibit stable cubic crystal structures. Negative formation energies, elastic constants, phonon dispersion and AIMD simulations testify to their thermodynamic, mechanical, dynamic and thermal stability, respectively. For the perovskite hydrides Ba2CrH6, Sr2CrH6 and Ca2CrH6, the corresponding specific hydrogen storage capacities are 1.82 wt.%, 2.69 wt.%, and 4.37 wt.%, respectively. Among these compounds, Sr2CrH6 exhibits the lowest applicable hydrogen desorption temperature, at 463.7 K. The electronic bands show remarkable spin activity, demonstrating that the change of A2+ cation (where A = Ca, Sr, and Ba) immediately influences the spin polarization and electronic behavior of hydride perovskites. On the basis of the elastic moduli studied, the mechanical behavior determines that Ca2CrH6 is the strongest material. The present results highlight the potential of A2CrH6 (A = Ca, Sr, and Ba) perovskite hydrides, in particular Ca2CrH6, for applications in advanced energy systems and hydrogen storage, as well as for electrical and optoelectronic devices.

Title: Deterministic single-photon source with on-chip 5.6 GHz acoustic clock
Authors: Alexander S. Kuznetsov, Meysam Saeedi, Zixuan Wang, Klaus Biermann
Abstract: Scalable solid state single-photon sources (SPSs) with triggered single-photon emission rates exceeding a few GHz would aid in the wide technological adoption of photonic quantum technologies. We demonstrate triggering of a quantum dot (QD) single photon emission using dynamic Purcell effect induced at a frequency of several GHz by acoustic strain. To this end, InAs QDs are integrated in a hybrid photon-phonon patterned microcavity, where the density of optical states is tailored by the lateral confinement of photons in um-sized traps defined lithographically in the microcavity spacer. The single-photon character of the emission form a QD in a trap is confirmed by measuring single-photon statistics. We demonstrate modulation of the QD transition energy in a trap with a frequency up to 14 GHz by monochromatic longitudinal bulk acoustic phonons generated by piezoelectric transducers. For the modulation frequency of 5.6 GHz, corresponding to the acoustic mode of the microcavity, the QD energy is periodically shifted through a spectrally narrow confined photonic mode leading to an appreciable enhancement of the QD emission due to the dynamic Purcell effect. The platform thus enables the implementation of scalable III-V-based SPSs with on-chip tunable acoustic clocks with frequencies that can exceed several GHz under continuous wave optical excitation.

Title: Beyond the Lowest Landau Level: Unlocking More Robust Fractional States Using Flat Chern Bands with Higher Vortexability
Authors: Yitong Zhang, Siddhartha Sarkar, Xiaohan Wan, Daniel E. Parker, Shi-Zeng Lin, Kai Sun
Abstract: Enhancing the many-body gap of a fractional state is crucial for realizing robust fractional excitations. For fractional Chern insulators, existing studies suggest that making flat Chern bands closely resemble the lowest Landau level (LLL) seems to maximize the excitation gap, providing an apparently optimal platform. In this work, we demonstrate that deforming away from the LLL limit can, in fact, produce substantially larger FQH gaps. Using moiré flat bands with strongly non-Landau-level wavefunctions, we show that the gap can exceed that of the LLL by more than two orders of magnitude for short-range interactions and by factors of two to three for long-range interactions. This enhancement is generic across Abelian FCI states and follows a universal enhancement factor within each hierarchy. Using the Landau level framework, we identify the amplification of pseudopotentials as the microscopic origin of the observed enhancement. This finding demonstrates that pseudopotential engineering can substantially strengthen fractional topological phases. We further examined non-Abelian states and found that, within finite-size resolution, this wavefunction construction method can also be used to manipulate and enhance the gap for certain interaction parameters.

Title: Wertheim association theory for ion pairing in electrolytes: effect of neutral clusters
Authors: Patrick B. Warren, Andrew J. Masters
Abstract: We address the problem of the vapor-liquid phase transition in the restricted primitive model (RPM) using Wertheim's statistical associating fluid theory to capture the effects of ion pairing which dominate the low-temperature vapor phase. For this we employ a reference system in which ion-pairing is suppressed by a judicious modification of the interaction between unlike charges from 1/r to erf(kappa r)/r, where kappa is a state-dependent parameter chosen so that the Helmholtz free energy A is at a null point (dA/d(kappa) = 0). Unlike the original RPM, this reference fluid admits real solutions to the hypernetted-chain (HNC) closure of the Ornstein-Zernike equations over a wide range of densities and temperatures. In the present study, we go beyond previous work [M. Li, Ph.D. thesis, University of Manchester (2011)] to allow for isodesmic assembly of ion pairs into neutral clusters. We find this has the potential to improve significantly the agreement with the Monte-Carlo results for the RPM vapor phase boundary. We can also match recent results on anomalous underscreening in the RPM [Härtel et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 108202 (2023)] assuming that only the free ions contribute to the screening length.

Title: Universal decay of (conditional) mutual information in gapped pure- and mixed-state quantum matter
Authors: Jinmin Yi, Kangle Li, Chuan Liu, Zixuan Li, Liujun Zou
Abstract: For spin and fermionic systems in any spatial dimension, we establish that the superpolynomial decay behavior of mutual information and conditional mutual information is a universal property of gapped pure- and mixed-state phases, i.e., all systems in such a phase possess this property if one system in this phase possesses this property. We further demonstrate that the (conditional) mutual information indeed decays superpolynomially in a large class of phases, including chiral phases. As a byproduct, we sharpen the notion of mixed-state phases.

Title: Machine-Learning-Guided Insights into Solid-Electrolyte Interphase Conductivity: Are Amorphous Lithium Fluorophosphates the Key?
Authors: Peichen Zhong, Kristin A. Persson
Abstract: Despite decades of study, the identity of the dominant \ce{Li+}-conducting phase within the inorganic SEI of Li-ion batteries remains unresolved. While the mosaic model describes LiF/\ce{Li2O}/\ce{Li2CO3} nanocrystallites within a disordered matrix, these crystalline phases inherently offer limited ionic conductivity. Growing evidence suggests that interfaces, grain boundaries, and amorphous phases may instead host the primary fast-ion pathways. Motivated by mixed-anion electrolyte decomposition products, we combine diffusion-based generative structure prediction with machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) to interrogate lithium difluorophosphate (\ce{LiPO2F2}), a key decomposition product of phosphorus- and fluorine-containing electrolytes. We identify a stable crystalline polymorph and, through MLIP-accelerated molecular dynamics, show that the amorphous counterpart is more conductive, with projected room-temperature $\sigma$ $\approx$ 0.18 mS cm$^{-1}$ and $E_\mathrm{a}$ $\approx$ 0.40 eV. This enhancement is attributed to structural disorder, which flattens the Li site-energy landscape, and to a low formation energy for Li-interstitial defects, which supplies additional mobile carriers. We present mixed-anion, amorphous Li--P--O--F phases as promising candidates for the \ce{Li+}-conducting medium of the inorganic SEI, offering a path forward for engineering improved battery interfaces.

Title: AQCat25: Unlocking spin-aware, high-fidelity machine learning potentials for heterogeneous catalysis
Authors: Omar Allam, Brook Wander, Aayush R. Singh
Abstract: Large-scale datasets have enabled highly accurate machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) for general-purpose heterogeneous catalysis modeling. There are, however, some limitations in what can be treated with these potentials because of gaps in the underlying training data. To extend these capabilities, we introduce AQCat25, a complementary dataset of 13.5 million density functional theory (DFT) single point calculations designed to improve the treatment of systems where spin polarization and/or higher fidelity are critical. We also investigate methodologies for integrating new datasets, such as AQCat25, with the broader Open Catalyst 2020 (OC20) dataset to create spin-aware models without sacrificing generalizability. We find that directly tuning a general model on AQCat25 leads to catastrophic forgetting of the original dataset's knowledge. Conversely, joint training strategies prove effective for improving accuracy on the new data without sacrificing general performance. This joint approach introduces a challenge, as the model must learn from a dataset containing both mixed-fidelity calculations and mixed-physics (spin-polarized vs. unpolarized). We show that explicitly conditioning the model on this system-specific metadata, for example by using Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM), successfully addresses this challenge and further enhances model accuracy. Ultimately, our work establishes an effective protocol for bridging DFT fidelity domains to advance the predictive power of foundational models in catalysis.

Title: Nonlinear optical quantum theory of demagnetization in L1$_0$ FePt and FePd
Authors: G. P. Zhang, Y. H. Bai, Thomas F. George
Abstract: It is now well established that a laser pulse can demagnetize a ferromagnet. However, for a long time, it has not had an analytic theory because it falls into neither nonlinear optics (NLO) nor magnetism. Here we attempt to fill this gap by developing a nonlinear optical theory centered on the spin moment, instead of the more popular susceptibility. We first employ group theory to pin down the lowest order of the nonzero spin moment in a centrosymmetric system to be the second order, where the second-order density matrix contains four terms of sum frequency generation (SFG) and four terms of difference frequency generation (DFG). By tracing over the product of the density matrix and the spin matrix, we are now able to compute the light-induced spin moment. We apply our theory to FePt and FePd, two most popular magnetic recording materials with identical crystal and electronic structures. We find that the theory can clearly distinguish the difference between those two similar systems. Specifically, we show that FePt has a stronger light-induced spin moment than FePd, in agreement with our real-time ultrafast demagnetization simulation and the experimental results. Among all the possible NLO processes, DFGs produce the largest spin moment change, a manifestation of optical rectification. Our research lays a solid theoretical foundation for femtomagnetism, so the light-induced spin moment reduction can now be computed and compared among different systems, without time-consuming real-time calculations, representing a significant step forward.

Title: Benchmarking Universal Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials for Elastic Property Prediction
Authors: Pengfei Gao, Haidi Wang
Abstract: Universal machine learning interatomic potentials have emerged as efficient tool for material simulation fields,yet their reliability for elastic property prediction remains unclear. Here we present a systematic benchmark of four uMLIPs-MatterSim, MACE, SevenNet, and CHGNet-against theoretical data for nearly 11,000 elastically stable materials from the Materials Project database. The results show SevenNet achieves the highest accuracy,MACE and MatterSim balance accuracy with efficiency, while CHGNet performs less effectively overall. This benchmark establishes a framework for guiding model selection and advancing uMLIPs in mechanical property applications.

Title: Mastering energy landscapes via liquid liquid phase separation to program active supramolecular coassembly from the nano to macro scale
Authors: Yuanhao Wu, Alexander van Teijlingen, Julie Watts, Zhiquan Yu, Shanshan Su, Jose Carlos RodriguezCabello, Lihi Abramovich, Tell Tuttle, Alvaro Mata
Abstract: The energy landscape dictates pathways and outcomes in supramolecular selfassembly, yet harnessing it from the nano to the macro scales remains a major challenge. Here, we demonstrate liquid liquid phase separation (LLPS) as a powerful tool to navigate and engineer the energy landscapes of coassembly systems comprising disordered proteins and peptides. We quantitatively map the energy barriers and transition states governing structural transitions, enabling predictive on off control of assembly and hierarchical order from nano to macro scales. By integrating supramolecular biofabrication, we achieve spatially organized architectures with life like non equilibrium behaviour. Crucially, assembly stability and scalable selfsorting are shown to depend on accessing minimum energy states, regardless of whether the co assembled structures are disordered or ordered. This work establishes energy landscape mediation via LLPS as a general framework for designing lifelike, hierarchically structured materials.

Title: Mind the Gap - Imaging Buried Interfaces in Twisted Oxide Moirés
Authors: Harikrishnan KP, Xin Wei, Chia-Hao Lee, Dasol Yoon, Yonghun Lee, Kevin J. Crust, Yu-Tsun Shao, Ruijuan Xu, Jong-Hoon Kang, Ce Liang, Jiwoong Park, Harold Y. Hwang, David A. Muller
Abstract: The ability to tune electronic structure in twisted stacks of layered, two-dimensional (2D) materials has motivated the exploration of similar moiré physics with stacks of twisted oxide membranes. Due to the intrinsic three-dimensional (3D) nature of bonding in many oxides, achieving atomic-level coupling is significantly more challenging than in 2D van der Waals materials. Although clean interfaces with atomic level proximity have been demonstrated in ceramic bicrystals using high-temperature and high-pressure processing to facilitate atomic diffusion that flattens rough interfaces, such conditions are not readily accessible when bonding oxide membranes. This study shows how topographic mismatch due to surface roughness of the membranes can restrict atomic-scale proximity at the interface to isolated patches even after obvious issues of contaminants and amorphous interlayers are eliminated. In hybrid interfaces between a chemically inert 2D material and an oxide membrane, the reduced ability of the 2D material to conform to the membrane's step-terrace topography also limits atomic-scale contact. In all these material systems, the interface morphology is best characterized using cross-sectional imaging and is necessary to corroborate investigations of interlayer coupling. When imaging the bicrystal in projection, conventional through-focal imaging is found to be relatively insensitive to the buried interface, whereas electron ptychography reliably resolves structural variations on the order of a nanometer. These findings highlight interface roughness as a key challenge for the field of oxide twistronics and emphasizes the need for reliable characterization methods.

Title: Effects of particle-hole fluctuations on the superfluid transition in two-dimensional atomic Fermi gases
Authors: Junru Wu, Zongpu Wang, Lin Sun, Kaichao Zhang, Chuping Li, Yuxuan Wu, Pengyi Chen, Dingli Yuan, Qijin Chen
Abstract: Proper treatment of the many-body interactions is of paramount importance in our understanding of strongly correlated systems. Here we investigate the effects of particle-hole fluctuations on the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition in two-dimensional Fermi gases throughout the entire BCS-BEC crossover. We include self-consistently in the self energy treatment the entire particle-hole $T$ matrix, which constitutes a renormalization of the bare interaction that appears in the particle-particle scattering $T$ matrix, leading to a screening of the pairing interaction and hence a dramatic reduction of the pairing gap and the transition temperature. The BKT transition temperature $T_\text{BKT}$ is determined by the critical phase space density, for which the pair density and pair mass are determined using a pairing fluctuation theory, which accommodates self-consistently the important self-energy feedback in the treatment of finite-momentum pairing fluctuations. The screening strength varies continuously from its maximum in the BCS limit to essentially zero in BEC limit. In the unitary regime, it leads to an interaction-dependent shift of $T_\text{BKT}$ towards the BEC regime. This shift is crucial in an attempt to explain experimental data quantitatively, which often depends on the interaction strength. Our findings are consistent with available experimental results in the unitary and BEC regimes and with quantum Monte Carlo simulations in the BCS and unitary regimes.

Title: Amplified Photocurrent in Heterojunctions comprising Nano-rippled Zinc Oxide and Perovskite-inspired Cs3Cu2I5
Authors: Si Hyeok Yang, Lim Kyung Oh, Na Young Lee, Dong Ho Lee, Sang Min Choi, Bowon Oh, Yun Ji Park, Yunji Cho, Jaesel Ryu, Hongki Kim, Sang-Hyun Chin, Yeonjin Yi, Myungkwan Song, Han Seul Kim, Jin Woo Choi
Abstract: Molecular zero-dimensional (0D) halide perovskite-inspired cesium copper iodide (Cs3Cu2I5) is a highly promising candidate for optoelectronic applications due to their low toxicity, high stability, and intense blue emission. However, their intrinsically poor electrical conductivity, stemming from isolated conductive copper iodide tetrahedra by cesium atoms, severely limits charge transport which poses a critical challenge for optoelectronic applications. In this study, we propose a novel strategy to overcome this limitation by utilizing precisely optimized zinc oxide nanoripple structures within a lateral Cs3Cu2I5 photodetector (PD) architecture featuring interdigitated electrodes (IDEs). The ZnO nanoripple was systematically tuned to improve the percolation paths, providing efficient routes for photogenerated carriers to migrate to the IDEs. Consequently, the optimized heterojunctions comprising Cs3Cu2I5 and ZnO exhibited superior photocurrent compared to the pristine Cs3Cu2I5 counterparts. This nanostructure-mediated charge transport engineering strategy for lateral structured PDs offers a new pathway for utilizing low-conductivity 0D materials for conventional optoelectronics, next-generation Internet of Things sensor networks, and plausibly biosensing applications.

Title: LightPFP: A Lightweight Route to Ab Initio Accuracy at Scale
Authors: Wenwen Li, Nontawat Charoenphakdee, Yong-Bin Zhuang, Ryuhei Okuno, Yuta Tsuboi, So Takamoto, Junichi Ishida, Ju Li
Abstract: Atomistic simulation methods have evolved through successive computational levels, each building upon more fundamental approaches: from quantum mechanics to density functional theory (DFT), and subsequently, to machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). While universal MLIPs (u-MLIPs) offer broad transferability, their computational overhead limits large-scale applications. Task-specific MLIPs (ts-MLIPs) achieve superior efficiency but require prohibitively expensive DFT data generation for each material system. In this paper, we propose LightPFP, a data-efficient knowledge distillation framework. Instead of using costly DFT calculations, LightPFP generates a distilled ts-MLIP by leveraging u-MLIP to generate high-quality training data tailored for specific materials and utilizing a pre-trained light-weight MLIP to further enhance data efficiency. Across a broad spectrum of materials, including solid-state electrolytes, high-entropy alloys, and reactive ionic systems, LightPFP delivers three orders of magnitude faster model development than conventional DFT-based methods, while maintaining accuracy on par with first-principles predictions. Moreover, the distilled ts-MLIPs further sustain the computational efficiency essential for large-scale molecular dynamics, achieving 1-2 orders of magnitude faster inference than u-MLIPs. The framework further enables efficient precision transfer learning, where systematic errors from the u-MLIP can be corrected using as few as 10 high-accuracy DFT data points, as demonstrated for MgO melting point prediction. This u-MLIP-driven distillation approach enables rapid development of high-fidelity, efficient MLIPs for materials science applications.

Title: Heat measurement of quantum interference
Authors: Christoforus Dimas Satrya, Aleksandr S. Strelnikov, Luca Magazzù, Yu-Cheng Chang, Rishabh Upadhyay, Joonas T. Peltonen, Bayan Karimi, Jukka P. Pekola
Abstract: Quantum coherence plays a key role in the operation and performance of quantum heat engines and refrigerators. Despite its importance for the fundamental understanding in quantum thermodynamics and its technological implications, coherence effects in heat transport have not been observed previously. Here, we measure quantum features in the heat transfer between a qubit and a thermal bath in a system formed of a driven flux qubit galvanically coupled to a $\lambda/4$ coplanar-waveguide resonator that is coupled to a heat reservoir. This thermal bath is a normal-metal mesoscopic resistor, whose temperature can be measured and controlled. We detect interference patterns in the heat current due to driving-induced coherence. In particular, resonance peaks in the heat transferred to the bath are found at driving frequencies which are integer fractions of the resonator frequency. A selection rule on the even/odd parity of the peaks holds at the qubit symmetry point. We present a theoretical model based on Floquet theory that captures the experimental results. The studied system provides a platform for studying the role of coherence in quantum thermodynamics. Our work opens the possibility to demonstrate a true quantum thermal machine where heat is measured directly.

Title: Topological Control of Transition Metal Networks for Reversible High-Capacity Li-rich Cathodes
Authors: Changming Ke, Yudi Yang, Minjun Wang, Jianhui Wang, Shi Liu
Abstract: Developing high-energy-density batteries is essential for advancing sustainable energy technologies. However, leading cathode materials such as Li-rich oxides, including Li$_2$MnO$_3$, suffer from capacity loss due to irreversible oxygen release and structural degradation, both consequences of the oxygen redox activity that also enables their high capacity. The atomic-scale mechanisms behind this degradation, and whether it can be made reversible, remain open questions. Here, using submicrosecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations with first-principles accuracy, we directly visualize the entire charge-discharge cycle of Li$_2$MnO$_3$, uncovering the full lifecycle of the O$_2$-filled nanovoids responsible for degradation and identifying the critical size limit for voids to remain fully repairable upon discharge. Our results reveal that the topology of the Mn cation network is the key factor governing void growth, coalescence, and reparability. Based on a structural topology-informed design principle, we computationally develop a novel Li$_2$MnO$_3$ structure featuring a Mn lattice with a Kagome-like pattern, demonstrating full electrochemical reversibility even under extreme 80% delithiation. Our work establishes a new paradigm for designing high-energy cathodes, shifting the focus from mitigating damage to engineering inherent stability through atomic-level topological control of transition metal network.

Title: Thermal Transport in Ag8TS6 (T= Si, Ge, Sn) Argyrodites: An Integrated Experimental, Quantum-Chemical, and Computational Modelling Study
Authors: Joana Bustamante, Anupama Ghata, Aakash A. Naik, Christina Ertural, Katharina Ueltzen, Wolfgang G. Zeier, Janine George
Abstract: Argyrodite-type Ag-based sulfides combine exceptionally low lattice thermal and high ionic conductivity, making them promising candidates for thermoelectric and solid-state energy applications. In this work, we studied Ag8TS6 (T= Si, Ge, Sn) argyrodite family by combining chemical-bonding analysis, lattice vibrational properties simulation, and experimental measurements to investigate their structural and thermal transport properties. Furthermore, we propose a two-channel lattice-dynamics model based on Grüneisen-derived phonon lifetimes and compare it to an approach using machine-learned interatomic potentials. Both approaches are able to predict thermal conductivity in agreement with experimental lattice thermal conductivities along the whole temperature range, highlighting their potential suitability for future high-throughput predictions. Our findings also reveal a relationship between bond heterogeneity arising from weakly bonded Ag+ ions and occupied antibonding states in Ag-S and Ag-Ag interactions and strong anharmonicity, including large Grüneisen parameters, and low sound velocities, which are responsible for the low lattice thermal conductivity of Ag8SnS6, Ag8GeS6, and Ag8SiS6. We furthermore show that thermal and ionic conductivities in all three compounds are independent of each other and can likely be tuned individually.

Abstract: Superconducting materials are a key for technologies enabling a large number of devices including THz wave mixers and single photon detectors, though limited at very low temperatures for conventional superconductors. High temperature operation could in principle be offered using cuprate superconductors. However, the complexity of the material in thin film form, the extremely short coherence length and material stability, have hindered the realization of THz devices working at liquid nitrogen temperatures. $YBa_2Cu_3O_{7-{\delta}}$ (YBCO) nanodevices have demonstrated non-linear properties typical of Josephson-like behavior, which have the potential for the mixing of AC signals in the THz range due to the large superconducting energy gap. Here, we present AC Josephson functionalities for terahertz waves utilizing Abrikosov vortex motion in nanoscale-confined fully planar YBCO thin film bridges. We observe Shapiro step-like features in the current voltage characteristics when irradiating the device with monochromatic sub-THz waves (100 GHz to 215 GHz) at 77 K. We further explore these nonlinear effects by detecting THz high-order harmonic mixing for signals from 200 GHz up to 1.4 THz using a local oscillator at 100 GHz. Our results open a path to an easy-fabricated HTS nonlinear nanodevice based on dimensional confinement suitable for terahertz applications.

Title: Universal Relations in Long-range Quantum Spin Chains
Authors: Ning Sun, Lei Feng, Pengfei Zhang
Abstract: Understanding the emergence of novel collective behaviors in strongly interacting systems lies at the heart of quantum many-body physics. Valuable insight comes from examining how few-body correlations manifest in many-body systems, embodying the ``from few to many'' philosophy. An intriguing example is the set of universal relations in ultracold atomic gases, which connect a wide range of observables to a single quantity known as the contact. In this Letter, we demonstrate that universal relations manifest in a distinct class of quantum many-body systems, long-range quantum spin chains, which belong to a completely new universality class. Using effective field theory and the operator product expansion, we establish connections between the asymptotic behavior of equal-time spin correlation functions, the dynamical structure factor, and the contact density. The theoretical predictions for equal-time correlators are explicitly verified through numerical simulations based on matrix product states. Our results could be readily tested in state-of-the-art trapped-ion systems.

Title: Exploring high-dimensional random landscapes: from spin glasses to random matrices, passing through simple chaotic systems
Authors: Alessandro Pacco
Abstract: High-dimensional random landscapes underlie phenomena as diverse as glassy physics and optimization in machine learning, and even their simplest toy models already display extraordinarily rich behavior. This thesis aims to deepen our understanding of that behavior, by combining landscape-based approaches, via the Kac-Rice formalism, with dynamical approaches, paying special attention to both systems with reciprocal and with non-reciprocal interactions. After surveying core techniques and results through the spherical p-spin model, this thesis delivers three main advances: (i) exact dynamic-static comparison in a solvable class of models with non-reciprocal interactions, pinpointing differences and similarities of the two approaches; (ii) a stability-based calculation of the mean number of fixed points (i.e., annealed complexity) of the Sompolinsky-Crisanti-Sommers random neural network, for any level of non-reciprocity; (iii) two approaches to probe the barriers and the distribution of deep local minima in the landscape of the p-spin model; (iv) some results on the overlaps among eigenvectors of spiked, correlated random matrices, which are useful to explore the geometry of energy landscapes. Together, these results sharpen our understanding of these systems, while providing new tools and opening new doors for future research directions.

Title: Unveiling the delicate hidden conditions at the interface of 2D materials by advanced atomic force microscopy

Abstract: The delicate interfacial conditions and behaviors play critical roles in determining the valuable physical properties of two-dimensional materials and their heterostructures on substrates. However, directly probing these complex interface conditions remains challenging. Here, we reveal the complex in-plane strain and out-of-plane bonding interface conditions in strain-engineered WS2 flakes by combined dual-harmonic electrostatic force microscopy (DH-EFM) and scanning microwave impedance microscopy (sMIM). A significant contradiction is observed between the intrinsically compressive-strain-induced larger bandgap (lower electrical conductivity) detected by DH-EFM, and the higher electrical conductivity measured by sMIM. Comparative electrical conductivity measurements under different sMIM modes demonstrate that this contradiction arises from the tip-loading-force-induced dynamic puckering effect, which is modulated by interfacial bonding strength. Furthermore, the accumulation and release of electrical conductivity during forward/backward sMIM-contact measurements further confirmed the dynamic puckering effect, revealing the difference in interface conditions between open ring and closed ring regions of WS2. This work resolves the correlation between electrical properties and interface conditions, providing insights for interface-engineered devices.

Title: Robust and tuneable ion selectivity in vermiculite membranes intercalated with unexchangeable ions
Authors: Zhuang Liu, Yumei Tan, Jianhao Qian, Min Cao, Eli Hoenig, Guowei Yang, Fengchao Wang, Francois M. Peeters, Yi-Chao Zou, Liang-Yin Chu, Marcelo Lozada-Hidalgo
Abstract: Membranes selective to ions of the same charge are increasingly sought for wastewater processing and valuable element recovery. However, while narrow channels are known to be essential, other membrane parameters remain difficult to identify and control. Here we show that Zr$^{4+}$, Sn$^{4+}$, Ir$^{4+}$, and La$^{3+}$ ions intercalated into vermiculite laminate membranes become effectively unexchangeable, creating stable channels, one to two water layers wide, that exhibit robust and tuneable ion selectivity. Ion permeability in these membranes spans five orders of magnitude, following a trend dictated by the ions' Gibbs free energy of hydration. Unexpectedly, different intercalated ions lead to two distinct monovalent ion selectivity sequences, despite producing channels of identical width. The selectivity instead correlates with the membranes' stiffness and the entropy of hydration of the intercalated ions. These results introduce a new ion selectivity mechanism driven by entropic and mechanical effects, beyond classical size and charge exclusion.

Title: Low-temperature scaling laws in unconventional flat-band superconductors
Authors: Maximilian Buthenhoff, Yusuke Nishida
Abstract: In flat-band superconductors, the electron pairing is strongly enhanced so that the critical temperature scales linearly with the interaction strength. Identifying the governing pairing mechanism in flat-band superconducting systems is therefore a central task, which may be constrained by experimental probes via low-temperature scaling measurements. A key observable underlying the Meissner effect and the resulting divergent DC conductivity is the superfluid weight. While it is well established that the minimal quantum metric provides the dominant contribution to the superfluid weight in conventional superconductors with isolated flat bands, recent studies indicate that the unconventional pairing can generate additional nonlocal quantum geometric terms. This motivates us to derive the low-temperature scaling law of the superfluid weight in two-dimensional flat-band superconductors with sufficiently isolated bands. In particular, we consider the gap function with point or line nodes classified by the Weierstrass preparation theorem. Beyond the superfluid weight, we additionally deliver explicit low-temperature scaling laws of the order parameter, the tunneling conductance, the specific heat, the Sommerfeld coefficient, and the spin-lattice relaxation rate to provide complementary experimental discriminants of the underlying pairing symmetry. The implications of our results are also elucidated by applying them to a selection of superconducting states in $C_{6v}$-symmetric systems.

Title: Physics-informed diffusion models for extrapolating crystal structures beyond known motifs
Authors: Andrij Vasylenko, Federico Ottomano, Christopher M. Collins, Rahul Savani, Matthew S. Dyer, Matthew J. Rosseinsky
Abstract: Discovering materials with previously unreported crystal frameworks is key to achieving transformative functionality. Generative artificial intelligence offers a scalable means to propose candidate crystal structures, however existing approaches mainly reproduce decorated variants of established motifs rather than uncover new configurations. Here we develop a physics-informed diffusion method, supported by chemically grounded validation protocol, which embeds descriptors of compactness and local environment diversity to balance physical plausibility with structural novelty. Conditioning on these metrics improves generative performance across architectures, increasing the fraction of structures outside 100 most common prototypes up to 67%. When crystal structure prediction (CSP) is seeded with generative structures, most candidates (97%) are reconstructed by CSP, yielding 145 (66%) low-energy frameworks not matching any known prototypes. These results show that while generative models are not substitutes for CSP, their chemically informed, diversity-guided outputs can enhance CSP efficiency, establishing a practical generative-CSP synergy for discovery-oriented exploration of chemical space.

Title: Rabi oscillations of a monolayer quantum emitter driven through its excited state
Authors: Victor N. Mitryakhin, Ivan A. Solovev, Alexander Steinhoff, Jaewon Lee, Martin Esmann, Ana Predojević, Christopher Gies, Christian Schneider
Abstract: The interaction of a quantum two-level system with a resonant driving field results in the emergence of Rabi oscillations, which are the hallmark of a controlled manipulation of a quantum state on the Bloch sphere. This all-optical coherent control of solid-state two-level systems is crucial for quantum applications. In this work we study Rabi oscillations emerging in a WSe2 monolayer-based quantum dot. The emitter is driven coherently using picosecond laser pulses to a higher-energy state, while photoluminescence is probed from the ground state. The theoretical treatment based on a three-level exciton model reveals the population transfer between the exciton ground and excited states coupled by Coulomb interaction. Our calculations demonstrate that the resulting exciton ground state population can be controlled by varying driving pulse area and detuning which is evidenced by the experimental data. Our results pave the way towards the coherent control of quantum emitters in atomically thin semiconductors, a crucial ingredient for monolayer-based high-performance, on-demand single photon sources.

Title: A platform for zero-field isolated skyrmions: 4$d$/Co atomic bilayers on Re(0001)
Authors: Moinak Ghosh, Stefan Heinze, Souvik Paul
Abstract: Using first-principles density functional theory (DFT) combined with atomistic spin simulations, we explore the possibility of realizing zero-field isolated skyrmions in three 4$d$/Co atomic bilayers -- Rh/Co, Pd/Co, and Ru/Co -- grown on the Re(0001) surface. Our investigation employs an extended atomistic spin model, which goes beyond the standard model by including the multi-spin higher-order exchange interactions (HOI) in addition to the Heisenberg pairwise exchange interaction, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), and magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE). All magnetic interactions of the extended spin model are calculated using DFT. The phase diagram obtained from atomistic spin simulations based on this spin model for Rh/Co and Pd/Co on Re(0001) reveals that isolated skyrmions emerge spontaneously on the ferromagnetic background even in the absence of an external magnetic field. The radius of zero-field isolated skyrmions in Rh/Co/Re(0001) is around 6 nm, whereas the radius of those skyrmions in Pd/Co/Re(0001) is about 12 nm. Transition-state theory calculations show that the skyrmions are protected by substantial energy barriers, approximately 150 meV, which predominantly arise from DMI, with a small contribution from the HOI interactions. The height of the barriers suggests that skyrmions could be observed in low-temperature experiments. Based on this work, we propose 4$d$/Co bilayers on Re(0001) as a new platform to realize nanoscale zero-field isolated skyrmions.

Title: Design principles for amorphous solid-state electrolytes
Authors: Qifan Yang, Xiao Fu, Xuhe Gong, Jingchen Lian, Liqi Wang, Ruijuan Xiao, Yong-Sheng Hu, Hong Li
Abstract: Amorphous solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) offer unique advantages for next-generation batteries, but their rational design is hindered by an unclear structure-property relationship. This study establishes universal design principles through atomistic simulations of 32 amorphous Li-M-X systems (M = B, Al, Si, P; X = F, Cl, Br, I, O, S, Se, N). We identify four structure types governed by a rule that saturated M-X groups with more negative charges preferentially form M-X-M chains, identify paddle-wheel and cooperative migration as two favorable transport mechanisms that are significantly enhanced in amorphous structures. We also pinpoint Oxides and fluorides as optimal for electrochemical and hydrolytic stability, and reveal bulk modulus as a simple predictor for $Li^+$ mobility. These insights are integrated into a practical design diagram, providing a novel and valuable framework for advancing high-performance amorphous SSEs.

Title: Memory-controlled random bit generator
Authors: Mateusz Wiśniewski, Jakub Spiechowicz
Abstract: Nowadays a bit is no longer a mere abstraction but a physical quantity whose manipulation governs both operation of modern technologies and theoretical frontiers of fundamental science. In this work we propose a setup in which the memory time can be utilized to control the generation and storage of binary information. In particular, we consider a nonequilibrium Brownian particle immersed in a viscoelastic environment and dwelling in a spatially periodic potential. We interpret its average velocity as a bit and show that depending on the memory time characterizing the viscoelastic bath the particle can be either in one of two stable states representing the bit values or in a chaotic state in which the information is erased and a new bit can be generated. We analyze randomness of the so obtained bit sequence and assess the stability of the produced values. Our study provides a blueprint for storing and processing information in a microscopic system using its memory.

Title: All-Altermagnetic Tunnel Junction of RuO2/NiF2/RuO2
Authors: Long Zhang, Guoying Gao
Abstract: Emerging altermagnets offer a promising avenue for spintronics, yet their integration into magnetic tunnel junctions has been hindered by reliance on ferromagnetic electrodes (introducing stray fields) or limited functionality (non-tunable magnetoresistance without spin filtering). Here, we propose an all-altermagnetic tunnel junction (AAMTJ) paradigm composed exclusively of altermagnets-exemplified by experiment-feasible RuO2/NiF2/RuO2. Giant tunneling magnetoresistance of 11704%, and high spin-filtering of ~90% in both spin channels are achieved. This architecture unlocks tunable multistate magnetoresistance and spin filtering via magnetization control of electrode and barrier, stemming from their synergistic and antagonistic alignments of momentum-dependent altermagnetic spin-splitting. Our AAMTJ inherently exhibits low consumption and no stray field, with nonrelativistic spin splitting and zero magnetic moment, combining advantages of both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic tunnel junctions. This AAMTJ paradigm provides a realistically versatile platform to develop revolutionarily potential of altermagnets for reconfigurable magnetic memory devices.

Title: General Strategy for Large Nernst Coefficient
Authors: Junya Endo, Hiroyasu Matsuura, Manfred Sigrist, Masao Ogata
Abstract: We propose a general strategy for enhancing the anomalous Nernst coefficient based on the Sommerfeld-Bethe relation. This approach provides a systematic framework for understanding the small anomalous Nernst coefficients typically observed in ferromagnets and identifies conditions under which substantial enhancements can be realized. We further introduce simplified models that exhibit large Nernst coefficients as offering illustrative examples.

Title: Estimating applied potentials in cold atom lattice simulators
Authors: Bhavik Kumar, Daniel Malz
Abstract: Cold atoms in optical lattices are a versatile and highly controllable platform for quantum simulation, capable of realizing a broad family of Hubbard models, and allowing site-resolved readout via quantum gas microscopes. In principle, arbitrary site-dependent potentials can also be implemented; however, since lattice spacings are typically below the diffraction limit, precisely applying and calibrating these potentials remains challenging. Here, we propose a simple and efficient experimental protocol that can be used to measure any potential with high precision. The key ingredient in our protocol is the ability in some atomic species to turn off interactions using a Feshbach resonance, which makes the evolution easy to compute. Given this, we demonstrate that collecting snapshots from the time evolution of a known, easily prepared initial state is sufficient to accurately estimate the potential. Our protocol is robust to state preparation errors and uncertainty in the hopping rate. This paves the way toward precision quantum simulation with arbitrary potentials.

Title: Effectiveness of cardinality-return weighted maximum independent set approach for financial portfolio optimization
Authors: Keita Takahashi, Tetsuro Abe, Yasuhito Nakamura, Ryo Hidaka, Shuta Kikuchi, Shu Tanaka
Abstract: The portfolio optimization problem is a critical issue in asset management and has long been studied. Markowitz's mean-variance model has fundamental limitations, such as the assumption of a normal distribution for returns and sensitivity to estimation errors in input parameters. In this research, we propose a novel graph theory-based approach, the cardinality-return weighted maximum independent set (CR-WMIS) model, to overcome these limitations. The CR-WMIS model pursues the optimization of both return and risk characteristics. It integrates the risk diversification effect by selecting the largest number of weakly correlated stocks, a feature of the maximum independent set (MIS) model, with the weighting effect based on expected returns from the weighted maximum independent set (WMIS) model. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed method through a five-year backtesting simulation (April 2019 - March 2024) using real market data from the S&P 500. For this task, we employed a simulated-bifurcation-based solver for finding high-quality solutions to large-scale combinatorial optimization problems. In our evaluation, we conducted a comprehensive risk assessment, which has not been sufficiently explored in previous MIS and WMIS studies. The results demonstrate that the CR-WMIS model exhibits superiority in both return and risk characteristics compared to the conventional MIS and WMIS models, as well as the market index (S&P 500). This study provides a practical portfolio optimization method that overcomes the theoretical limitations of the mean-variance model, contributing to both the advancement of academic theory and the support of practical investment decision-making.

Title: User-defined Electrostatic Potentials in DFT Supercell Calculations: Implementation and Application to Electrified Interfaces
Authors: Samuel Mattoso, Jing Yang, Florian Deißenbeck, Ahmed Abdelkawy, Christoph Freysoldt, Stefan Wipperman, Mira Todorova, Jörg Neugebauer
Abstract: Introducing electric fields into density functional theory (DFT) calculations is essential for understanding electrochemical processes, interfacial phenomena, and the behavior of materials under applied bias. However, applying user-defined electrostatic potentials in DFT is nontrivial and often requires direct modification to the specific DFT code. In this work, we present an implementation for supercell DFT calculations under arbitrary electric fields and discuss the required corrections to the energies and forces. The implementation is realized through the recently released VASP-Python interface, enabling the application of user-defined fields directly within the standard VASP software and providing great flexibility and control. We demonstrate the application of this approach with diverse case studies, including molecular adsorption on electrified surfaces, field ion microscopy, electrochemical solid-water interfaces, and implicit solvent models.

Title: Elastic modeling and total energy calculations of the structural characteristics of "free-standing",periodic, pseudomorphic GaN/AlN superlattices
Authors: Th. Karakostas, Ph. Komninou, V. Pontikis
Abstract: The strain states of the components of pseudomorphic superlattices can be accurately modeled analytically through the application of linear elasticity. In this particular case of GaN/AlN 'free-standing' superlattices, the predictions derived from elastic modeling have been compared with total energy calculations of several systems made of components with varying thicknesses. We demonstrate that the elastic predictions for the lattice constants of the components align with the values obtained from their total energy counterparts, within the limits of computational errors and uncertainties. Furthermore, a phenomenological analysis of the elastic energy stored in the superlattices facilitates the evaluation of the excess energies associated with the interfaces present in these systems. The results mentioned above are briefly contrasted with findings reported in previous literature.

Title: Ground-state phase diagram of S = 1/2 Heisenberg model on 2D square-hexagon-octagon lattice
Authors: Yumeng Luo, Yuehong Li, Mengfan Jiang, Muwei Wu, Jian-Jian Yang, Dao-Xin Yao, Han-Qing Wu
Abstract: Using stochastic series expansion quantum Monte Carlo method and density matrix renormalization group, we study the ground-state phase diagram of $S=1/2$ Heisenberg model on 2D square-hexagon-octagon (SHO) lattice. In this model, we consider two kinds of nearest-neighbor interaction (intra-hexagon interaction $J_1$ and inter-hexagon $J_2$) and the selected third nearest-neighbor interaction $J_3$ along $x$ direction. From our calculations, there are five phases in the parameters regime $0<\lambda_1=J_2/J_1<4, 0<\lambda_2=J_3/J_1<4$, including a Néel antiferromagentic phase, a Haldane-like symmetry protected topological phase, a hexagon phase and two dimer phases. In the Haldane-like SPT phase, we characterized its topological nature using the degeneracy of ground-state energy under open boundary condition and the entanglement spectrum. To characterize the phase boundaries, we use spin stiffness and Binder cumulant to do the comprehensive finite-size scalings. From data collapse, the critical behaviors of all the nonmagnetic phases to the antiferromagnetic phase belong to the 3D $O(3)$ Heisenberg universality class. As a theoretical exploration, our work establishes a foundational framework for understanding 2D magnetism on the SHO lattice.

Title: fair_data.py: implementing FAIR data compliance in Tribchem
Authors: Lucrezia Berghenti, Elisa Damiani, Margherita Marsili, Maria Clelia Righi
Abstract: The increasing complexity and volume of data generated by high-throughput computational materials science require robust tools to ensure their accessibility, reproducibility, and reuse. In particular, integrating the FAIR Guiding Principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) into computational workflows is essential to enable open science practices. TribChem is an open source Python software developed for the automated simulation of solid-solid interfaces using density functional theory (DFT). While TribChem already incorporates several FAIR-aligned features, we present here a dedicated FAIR utility designed to transform TribChem results into FAIR-compliant datasets. This utility comprises two tools: this http URL, which automatically generates standardized machine- and human-readable outputs from the TribChem database, and this http URL, which facilitates efficient data extraction through a keyword-based interface. In this paper we show the capabilities of the fair utility with examples for bulk, surface, and interface systems. The implementation allows seamless integration with public repositories such as Zenodo, paving the way for reproducible research and fostering data-driven materials discovery.

Title: Quantum fluctuations determine the spin-flop transition in hematite
Authors: Tobias Dannegger, Imre Hagymási, Levente Rózsa, Ulrich Nowak
Abstract: Magnetic phase transitions between ordered phases are often understood on the basis of semi-classical spin models. Deviations from the classical description due to the quantum nature of the atomic spins as well as quantum fluctuations are usually treated as negligible if long-range order is preserved, and are rarely quantified for actual materials. Here, we demonstrate that a fully quantum-mechanical framework is required for a quantitatively correct description of the spin-flop transition in the insulating altermagnet hematite between the collinear antiferromagnetic and the weakly ferromagnetic spin-flop phase at low temperature. By applying both exact diagonalization and density-matrix renormalization group theory to the quantum Heisenberg Hamiltonian, we show how a quantum-mechanical treatment of an ab initio parametrized spin model can significantly improve the predicted low-temperature spin-flop field over a classical description when compared to measurements. Our results imply that quantum fluctuations have a measurable influence on selecting the ground state of a system out of competing ordered magnetic phases at low temperature.

Title: Probabilistic Computing Optimization of Complex Spin-Glass Topologies
Authors: Fredrik Hasselgren, Max O. Al-Hasso, Amy Searle, Joseph Tindall, Marko von der Leyen
Abstract: Spin glass systems as lattices of disordered magnets with random interactions have important implications within the theory of magnetization and applications to a wide-range of hard combinatorial optimization problems. Nevertheless, despite sustained efforts, algorithms that attain both high accuracy and efficiency remain elusive. Due to their topologies being low-$k$-partite such systems are well suited to a probabilistic computing (PC) approach using probabilistic bits (P-bits). Here we present complex spin glass topologies solved on a simulated PC realization of an Ising machine. First, we considered a number of three dimensional Edwards-Anderson cubic spin-glasses randomly generated as well as found in the literature as a benchmark. Second, biclique topologies were identified as a likely candidate for a comparative advantage compared to other state-of-the-art techniques, with a range of sizes simulated. We find that the number of iterations necessary to find solutions of a given quality has constant scaling with system size past a saturation point if one assumes perfect parallelization of the hardware. Therefore a PC architecture can trade the computational depth of other methods for parallelized width by connecting a number of P-bits that scales linearly in system size. This constant scaling is shown to persist across a number of solution qualities, up to a certain limit beyond which resource constraints limited further investigation. The saturation point varies between topologies and qualities and becomes exponentially hard in the limit of finding the ground truth. Furthermore we demonstrate that our PC architecture can solve spin-glass topologies to the same quality as the most advanced quantum annealer in minutes, making modest assumptions about their implementation on hardware.

Title: Interrelation between precisions on integrated currents and on recurrence times in Markov jump processes
Authors: Alberto Garilli, Diego Frezzato
Abstract: For Markov jump processes on irreducible networks with finite number of sites, we derive a general and explicit expression of the squared coefficient of variation for the net number of transitions from one site to a connected site in a given time window of observation (i.e., an `integrated current' as dynamical output). Such expression, which in itself is particularly useful for numerical calculations, is then elaborated to obtain the interrelation with the precision on the intrinsic timing of the recurrences of the forward and backward transitions. In biochemical ambits, such as enzyme catalysis and molecular motors, the precision on the timing is quantified by the so-called randomness parameter and the above connection is established in the long time limit of monitoring and for an irreversible site-site transition; the present extension to finite time and reversibility adds a new dimension. Some kinetic and thermodynamic inequalities are also derived.

Title: Non-Markovian quantum Mpemba effect in strongly correlated quantum dots
Authors: YuanDong Wang
Abstract: Harnessing non-Markovian effects has emerged as a resource for quantum control, where a structured environment can act as a quantum memory. We investigate the quench dynamics from specific initial states to equilibrium steady states in strongly correlated quantum dot systems. The distance between quantum states is quantified using the Bures metric, which endows the space of reduced density matrices with a Riemannian geometric structure. Using the numerically exact hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) method, we demonstrate a quantum Mpemba effect arising from non-Markovianity. This effect is characterized by a relaxation slowdown due to information backflow from the bath to the system, which induces a pronounced memory effect. We show that the emergence of the non-Markovian quantum Mpemba effect on the approach to a strongly correlated steady state is determined by the interplay between the initial-state-dependent non-Markovianity and the initial geometric distance between states. Our results underscore the critical role of memory effects in quantum quench dynamics and suggest new pathways for controlling anomalous relaxation in open quantum systems.

Title: Thermoelectric transport and the role of different scattering processes in the half-Heusler NbFeSb
Authors: Bhawna Sahni, Yao Zhao, Zhen Li, Rajeev Dutt, Patrizio Graziosi, Neophytos Neophytou
Abstract: We perform an ab initio computational investigation of the electronic and thermoelectric transport properties of one of the best performance half-Heusler (HH) alloys, NbFeSb. We use Boltzmann Transport equation while taking into account the full energy/momentum/band dependence of all relevant electronic scattering rates, i.e. with acoustic phonons, non-polar optical phonons (intra- and inter-valley), polar optical phonons (POP), and ionized impurity scattering (IIS). We use a highly efficient and accurate computational approach, where the scattering rates are derived using only a few ab initio extracted matrix elements, while we account fully for intra-/inter valley/band transitions, screening from both electrons and holes, and bipolar transport effects. Our computed thermoelectric power-factor (PF) values show good agreement with experiments across densities and temperatures, while they indicate the upper limit of PF performance for this material. We show that the polar optical phonon and ionized impurity scattering (importantly including screening), influence significantly the transport properties, whereas the computationally expensive non-polar phonon scattering part (acoustic and non-polar optical) is somewhat weaker, especially for electrons, and at lower to intermediate temperatures. This insight is relevant in the study of half-Heusler and other polar thermoelectric materials in general. Although we use NbFeSb as an example, the method we employ is material agnostic and can be broadly applied efficiently for electronic and thermoelectric materials in general, with more than 10x reduction in computational cost compared to fully ab initio methods, while retaining ab-initio accuracy.

Title: dynsight: an Open Python Platform for Simulation and Experimental Trajectory Data Analysis
Authors: Simone Martino, Matteo Becchi, Andrew Tarzia, Daniele Rapetti, Giovanni M. Pavan
Abstract: The study of complex many-body systems through the analysis of the trajectories of dynamically moving and interacting units is a non-trivial task. The workflow for extracting meaningful information from raw trajectory data typically involves several interconnected steps: (i) identifying and tracking objects, and resolving their trajectories (for example, in experimental systems where these are not automatically available as in molecular simulations); (ii) translating the trajectories into data that are easier to handle and analyze using suitable descriptors; and (iii) extracting meaningful information from these data. Each of these tasks often requires substantial programming skills, the use of different types of representations or methods, and the development of interfaces between them. Despite the progress made by new tools targeting individual steps, integrating them under a common framework would lower the barrier to use (especially for diverse communities of users), reduce fragmentation, and ultimately facilitate the development of new approaches in trajectory data analysis. To this end, we introduce dynsight, an open Python platform that streamlines the extraction and analysis of time-series data from simulation or experimentally resolved trajectories. Dynsight simplifies workflows, enhances accessibility, and supports the analysis of time-series and trajectory data to unravel the dynamic complexity of systems across different scales. Dynsight is open source (available at this http URL) and can be easily installed using pip.

Title: DeFecT-FF: Accelerated Modeling of Defects in Cd-Zn--Te-Se-S Compounds Combining High-Throughput DFT and Machine Learning Force Fields
Authors: Md Habibur Rahman, Arun Mannodi-Kanakkithodi
Abstract: We developed DeFecT-FF, a framework for predicting the energies and ground-state configurations of native point defects, extrinsic dopants, impurities, and defect complexes in zincblende-phase Cd/Zn-Te/Se/S compounds relevant to CdTe-based solar cells. The framework combines high-throughput DFT data with crystal graph-based machine learning force fields (MLFFs) trained to reproduce DFT energies and forces. Alloying at Cd or Te sites offers a route to tune the electronic and defect properties of CdTe absorbers for improved solar efficiency. Given the vast number of possible defect types, charge states, and symmetry-breaking configurations, traditional DFT approaches are computationally prohibitive. Our dataset includes GGA-PBE and HSE06-optimized structures for bulk, alloyed, interface, and grain-boundary systems. Using active learning, we expanded the dataset and trained MLFFs to accurately predict energies across charge states. The model enabled rapid screening and discovery of new low-energy defect configurations, validated through HSE06 calculations with spin-orbit coupling. The DeFecT-FF framework is publicly available as a nanoHUB tool, allowing users to upload crystallographic files, automatically generate defects, and compute defect formation energies versus Fermi level and chemical potentials, greatly reducing the need for expensive DFT simulations.

Title: Magnetic-field controlled organic spintronic memristor for neural network computation
Authors: Tongxin Chen, Yinyu Nie, Yafei Hao, Shengchun Shen, Jiajun Pan, Xiaoguang Li, Yuan Lu
Abstract: Memristors are emerging as key electronic components that retain resistance states without power. Their non-volatile nature and ability to mimic synaptic behavior make them ideal for next-generation memory technologies and neuromorphic computing systems inspired by the human brain. In this study, we present a novel organic spintronic memristor based on a La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 (LSMO)/poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)/Co heterostructure, exhibiting biologically inspired synaptic behavior. Driven by fluorine atom migration within the PVDF layer, the device demonstrates both long-term depression (LTD) and long-term potentiation (LTP) under controlled electrical polarization. Distinctively, the resistance states can also be modulated by an external magnetic field via the tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect, introducing a non-electrical means of tuning synaptic plasticity. This magnetic control mechanism enables multi-state modulation without compromising device performance or endurance. Furthermore, convolutional neural network (CNN) simulations incorporating this magnetic tuning capability reveal enhanced pattern recognition accuracy and improved training stability, especially at high learning rates. These findings underscore the potential of organic spintronic memristors as high-performance, low-power neuromorphic elements, particularly suited for applications in flexible and wearable electronics.

Title: Scattering of a massive quantum vortex-dipole from an obstacle
Authors: Alice Bellettini, Enrico Ortu, Vittorio Penna
Abstract: In binary mixtures of Bose-Einstein condensates, massive-vortex dipoles can arise, and undergo scattering processes against obstacles. These show an intriguing dynamics, governed by the strongly nonlinear character of the quantum vortex motion, where we are able to highlight the effects of the boundaries. We first characterize such scattering dynamics via some point-like models, for the cases of an unbounded plane and a confined geometry. Within this framework, we find two fundamental scattering behaviors of a vortex dipole, the "fly-by" and the "go-around" processes. By plotting the deflection angle of the dipole versus the impact parameter we are able to quantify the transition between different scattering behaviors. We then are able to introduce an analytical distinction of the two scenarios, basing on the point-like model for the plane geometry. Furthermore, another interesting result shows the emergence of an on-average massless dynamics whenever the nonlinear interactions with the obstacle become negligible. Alongside, we investigate the quantum dipole scattering via the numerical simulation of two coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations, describing the quantum mixture at a mean-field level. In this way, we benchmark the point-like model against the mean-field simulations.

Title: Prediction of a topological phase transition in exchange alternating spin-1 nanographene chains
Authors: João C. G. Henriques, Yelko del Castillo, Ricardo Segundo, Jan Phillips, Joaquín Fernández-Rossier
Abstract: The use of magnetic nanographenes as building blocks for artificial spin lattices is enabling the exploration of flagship model Hamiltonians of one-dimensional quantum magnetism with an unprecedented degree of control. The spin-1 Heisenberg model, incorporating both linear and quadratic exchange interactions, was first realized using [3]-triangulenes, where the hallmark Haldane phase with spin fractionalization was observed. Later, the spin-1/2 Heisenberg Hamiltonian with exchange alternation was realized with Clar's goblets, where two additional topological phases were identified. Here we show that spin-1 nanographenes can also be used to explore the topological phase transition between the Haldane phase and a dimerized phase predicted for spin-1 chains with bond-alternation. We first study how the boundary of the phase transition is modified by non-linear exchange, known to be present in spin-1 nanographenes, using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). Combining multiconfigurational with first-principles calculations, we propose two candidates to realize different topological phases of the model: a recently synthesized extended Clar's goblet, and a passivated [4]-triangulene. Moreover, we show how these two phases can be identified experimentally using inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy (IETS). This work paves the way for the experimental realization of these topological phases, which can be locally probed with scanning tunneling microscopy.

Title: Potential-based formalism for electrodynamics of media with weak spatial dispersion
Authors: Yury Solyaev
Abstract: In this work, we develop a potential-based formalism for Maxwell's equations in isotropic media with weak spatial dispersion within the electric quadrupole-magnetic dipole approximation. We introduce an operator form of the constitutive relations along with a modified Lorenz gauge condition, which enables the derivation of decoupled generalized wave equations for electromagnetic potentials. For time-harmonic processes, we derive the representation of general solution for these equations as a combination of solutions to Helmholtz-type equations, whose parameters are determined by both standard and hyper-susceptibilities of the medium. We show that the proposed approach can be extended to more general constitutive relations and it provides a convenient framework for solving various applied problems. Specifically, using a derived closed-form solution for the problem of plane wave incidence on a planar interface, we demonstrate that a correct definition of the Poynting vector within the multipole theory must incorporate quadrupole effects -- an aspect overlooked in some previous works that has led to inconsistent results. We further establish the necessity of accounting for both propagated and evanescent longitudinal components in reflected and transmitted waves. The presence of these components, which follow directly from the general solution for electromagnetic potentials, is essential for satisfying all classical and additional boundary conditions in media with quadrupolar response (e.g., in metamaterials or quadrupolar liquid mixtures). The complete set of these boundary conditions is derived based on the least action principle, ensuring variational consistency with the field equations and generalizing previously known formulations of multipole theory.

Title: High-Efficiency Thermoelectric Transport in Aharonov-Bohm-Casher Rings
Authors: Diego García, Sergio Arias, Rosa López
Abstract: Quantum heat engines are nanoscale devices that convert heat into work by exploiting quantum effects, such as coherence and interference. Previous studies of these devices did not consider spin-dependent effects, which can influence the thermoelectric performance of the engine. In this work, we study the thermoelectric behavior of a quantum heat engine based on an Aharonov-Bohm ring - a mesoscopic ring where electrons exhibit interference depending on the magnetic flux it encloses - incorporating Rashba spin-orbit interaction (SOI), which couples the electron's motion and spin. We find that Rashba SOI enhances the figure of merit $ZT$, measure of the engine's conversion efficiency. Our results suggest that controlling spin-dependent interference could lead to improvements in the fabrication of efficient thermoelectric devices.

Title: Coupling-induced universal dynamics in bilayer two-dimensional Bose gases
Authors: En Chang, Vijay Pal Singh, Abel Beregi, Erik Rydow, Ludwig Mathey, Christopher J. Foot, Shinichi Sunami
Abstract: The emergence of order in many-body systems and the associated self-similar dynamics governed by dynamical scaling laws is a hallmark of universality far from equilibrium. Measuring and classifying such nontrivial behavior for novel symmetry classes remains challenging. Here, we realize a well-controlled interlayer coupling quench in a tunable bilayer two-dimensional Bose gas, driving the system to an ordered phase. We observe robust self-similar dynamics and a universal critical exponent consistent with diffusion-like coarsening, driven by vortex and antivortex annihilation induced by the interlayer coupling. Our results extend the understanding of universal dynamics in many-body systems and provide a robust foundation for quantitative tests of nonequilibrium effective field theories.

Title: Solution to a Quantum Impurity Model for Moiré Systems: Fermi Liquid, Pairing, and Pseudogap
Authors: Yi-Jie Wang, Geng-Dong Zhou, Hyunsung Jung, Seongyeon Youn, Seung-Sup B. Lee, Zhi-Da Song
Abstract: Recent theoretical and experimental studies have revealed the co-existence of heavy and light electrons in magic-angle multilayer graphene, which form a periodic lattice of Anderson impurities hybridizing with Dirac semi-metals. This work demonstrates that nontrivial features -- pairing potential, pseudogap, and continuous quantum phase transitions -- already appear at the single-impurity level, if valley-anisotropic anti-Hund's interactions ($J_S$, $J_D$) are included, favoring either a singlet ($J_S>J_D$) or a valley doublet ($J_D>J_S$) impurity configuration. We derive a complete phase diagram and analytically solve the impurity problem at several fixed points using bosonization and refermionization techniques. When $J_D>J_S,J_D>0$, the valley doublet only couples via pair-hopping processes to the conduction electrons, in sharp contrast to the conventional Kondo scenario. Upon increasing $J_D$, there is a quantum phase transition of the BKT universality class, from a Fermi liquid to an anisotropic doublet phase, the latter exhibiting power-law susceptibilities with non-universal exponents. On the other hand, when $J_S>J_D,J_S>0$, increasing $J_S$ induces a second-order phase transition from Fermi liquid to a local singlet phase, which involves a non-Fermi liquid as an intermediate fixed point. Near the transition towards the anisotropic doublet (local singlet) phase, the renormalized interaction of the Fermi liquid becomes attractive, favoring doublet (singlet) pairing. Based on analytic solutions, we construct ansatz for the impurity spectral function and correlation self-energy, which account for the pseudogap accompanying side peaks, found in recent spectroscopic measurements and a DMFT study. In particular, we obtain a non-analytic V-shaped spectral function with non-universal exponents in the anisotropic doublet phase. All results are further verified by NRG calculations.

Title: Statistics of correlations in nonlinear recurrent neural networks
Authors: German Mato, Facundo Rigatuso, Gonzalo Torroba
Abstract: The statistics of correlations are central quantities characterizing the collective dynamics of recurrent neural networks. We derive exact expressions for the statistics of correlations of nonlinear recurrent networks in the limit of a large number N of neurons, including systematic 1/N corrections. Our approach uses a path-integral representation of the network's stochastic dynamics, which reduces the description to a few collective variables and enables efficient computation. This generalizes previous results on linear networks to include a wide family of nonlinear activation functions, which enter as interaction terms in the path integral. These interactions can resolve the instability of the linear theory and yield a strictly positive participation dimension. We present explicit results for power-law activations, revealing scaling behavior controlled by the network coupling. In addition, we introduce a class of activation functions based on Pade approximants and provide analytic predictions for their correlation statistics. Numerical simulations confirm our theoretical results with excellent agreement.

Title: First non-zero measurement of a nuclear electric dipole moment
Authors: Gary Prézeau
Abstract: This paper reports the first non-zero measurement of a nuclear electric dipole moment using a novel method based on the rate of change of a supercurrent first proposed in 2016~\cite{this https URL} and fleshed out in this current paper. The theory, experimental concept and implementation are described in detail. The non-zero nuclear electric dipole moment measured with over 1000 hours of data was that of $^{181}$Ta producing a best value $|d_\text{e}^\text{Ta}|=(3.39\pm0.31_\text{stat})\cdot10^{-32}e\cdot\text{cm}$ and $|d_\text{e}^\text{Ta}|=(3.39\pm3.18)\cdot10^{-32}e\cdot\text{cm}>0$ at 99.985\%CL. There is an uncertainty on the value of overall multiplicative parameters such as the self-inductance of the superconducting circuit ($\pm4\%$), the mutual inductance between the SQUID pickup coil and the sample wire ($\pm15\%$), and the magnitude of the solenoid current ($\pm5\%$). An upper-limit was estimated for the control element, $^{207}$Pb, $|d_\text{e}^\text{Pb}|\lesssim1.2\cdot10^{-31}e\cdot\text{cm}$ at 95\%CL.

Title: Tuning laser-induced optical breakdown and cavitation through the ionic environment in aqueous media
Authors: Junhao Cai, Yuhan Li, Yunqiao Liu, Benlong Wang, Mingbo Li
Abstract: Laser-induced cavitation in liquids originates from optical breakdown processes that depend sensitively on both laser-plasma dynamics and the chemical microenvironment of the solvent. Herein, we experimentally decouple the effects of ionic strength and ion specificity on cavitation inception in aqueous electrolytes spanning neutral, acidic, and alkaline regimes. Using focused nanosecond laser pulses, we show that increasing ionic strength universally lowers the cavitation threshold by enhancing charge screening and seed-electron availability. However, under constant ionic strength, strongly asymmetric behavior emerges: acidic (hydrogen chloride, HCl) solutions inhibit cavitation, whereas alkaline (sodium hydroxide, NaOH) solutions enhance it. This asymmetry arises from hydrated-electron kinetics that depends on the ion specificity. In acidic solutions, hydronium ions act as diffusion-limited scavengers of hydrated electrons, quenching their lifetime and inhibiting avalanche ionization. In contrast, hydroxide ions reduce hydronium availability and extend electron survival, promoting more efficient plasma formation. Despite large discrepancies in breakdown thresholds, electrical conductivity remains nearly constant, demonstrating that microscopic electron chemistry, rather than bulk charge transport, governs cavitation onset. These results establish a mechanism connection between electrolyte chemistry and optical breakdown, showing that ion-specific reaction dynamics fundamentally control laser-induced cavitation in aqueous environments.

Title: Analytic Marginalization over Binary Variables in Physics Data
Authors: Marcus Högås, Edvard Mörtsell
Abstract: In many data analyses, each measurement may come with a simple yes/no correction; for example, belonging to one of two populations or being contaminated or not. Ignoring such binary effects may bias the results, while accounting for them explicitly quickly becomes infeasible as each of the $N$ data points introduces an additional parameter, resulting in an exponentially growing number of possible configurations ($2^N$). We show that, under generic conditions, an exact treatment of these binary corrections leads to a mathematical form identical to the well-known Ising model from statistical physics. This connection opens up a powerful set of tools developed for the Ising model, enabling fast and accurate likelihood calculations. We present efficient approximation schemes with minimal computational cost and demonstrate their effectiveness in applications, including Type Ia supernova calibration, where we show that the uncertainty in host-galaxy mass classification has negligible impact on the inferred value of the Hubble constant.

Abstract: The influence matrix (IM) provides a powerful framework for characterizing nonequilibrium quantum many-body dynamics by encoding multitime correlations into tensor-network states. Understanding how its computational complexity relates to underlying dynamics is crucial for both theoretical insight and practical utility, yet remains largely unexplored despite a few case studies. Here, we address this question for a family of brickwork quantum circuits ranging from integrable to chaotic regimes. Using tools from geometric group theory, we identify three qualitatively distinct scalings of temporal entanglement entropy, establishing a hierarchy of computational resources required for accurate tensor-network representations of the IM for these models. We further analyze the memory structure of the IM and distinguish between classical and quantum temporal correlations. In particular, for certain examples, we identify effectively classical IMs that admit an efficient Monte Carlo algorithm for computing multitime correlations. In more generic settings without an explicit classical description of the IM, we introduce an operational measure of quantum memory with an experimental protocol, and discuss examples exhibiting long-time genuinely quantum correlations. Our results establish a new connection between quantum many-body dynamics and group theory, providing fresh insights into the complexity of the IM and its intricate connection to the physical characteristics of the dynamics.

Title: The evolution of Liouville von Neumann master equations in the Pechukas-Yukawa framework
Authors: Mumnuna Aziz Qureshi
Abstract: This paper presents a novel formalism for the out of equilibrium dynamics of the density matrix, capable of describing highly entangled many-body interactions. The evolution of quantum states is evaluated via eigenvalue dynamics of a general Hamiltonian system, perturbed by a parametrically evolving variable $\lambda(t)$ that carries the time-dependence. This is achieved using the Pechukas-Yukawa mapping of the evolution of the energy levels governed by their initial conditions on a generalised Calogero-Sutherland model of a 1D classical gas. As such, quantum systems can be described exactly in their entirety from eigenvalue dynamics. Under this description, we provide an improved understanding of the relationship between nonequilibrium quantum phase transitions and decoherence which has significant impacts to a wide range of applications.

Title: Strong Coupling beyond the High-Q Limit and Linewidth Narrowing in a Multi-Exciton Planar Microcavity
Authors: E. A. Cerda-Méndez, Y. G. Rubo, K. Biermann, A. Camacho-Guardian, A. S. Kuznetsov, P. V. Santos
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate unconventional linewidth narrowing and strong exciton-photon coupling in a planar hybrid microcavity (MC) with a low quality factor Q of around 300. As the broad photonic resonance approaches the heavy- and light-hole exciton transitions in GaAs quantum wells, three well-separated exciton-polariton branches emerge, accompanied by a counter-intuitive fourfold narrowing of the total linewidth. This behavior challenges conventional two-oscillator strong-coupling models and is only partially reproduced by transfer-matrix and Green's-function calculations, suggesting the involvement of frequency-dependent self-energies or correlated dissipation. Our findings demonstrate that strong coupling and coherence enhancement can occur even in highly lossy cavities, questioning the conventional requirement for high-Q microcavities and opening new design possibilities for polaritonic and photonic devices.

Title: Beam shaping techniques for pulsed laser ablation in liquids: Unlocking tunable control of nanoparticle synthesis in liquids
Authors: S. Molina-Prados, N. M. Bulgakova, A. V. Bulgakov, J. Lancis, G. Mínguez Vega, C. Doñate-Buendia
Abstract: Nanoparticle synthesis via pulsed laser ablation in liquids has gained prominence as a versatile and environmentally friendly approach for producing ligand-free colloids with controlled composition, size, and morphology. While pulsed laser ablation in liquids offers unparalleled advantages in terms of nanoparticle purity and material versatility, enhancing the size control and productivity require modifications of the standard pulsed laser ablation in liquid technique such as the incorporation of beam shaping techniques. Recent developments in spatial and temporal beam shaping have demonstrated their potential to revolutionize pulsed laser ablation in liquids by enabling more precise energy deposition and modified nanoparticle production dynamics. This review highlights the critical role of beam shaping, encompassing spatial shaping of the beam to influence laser-material interaction, and temporal modification to optimize pulse duration and energy delivery. The current advancements in beam shaping techniques, their impact on the nanoparticle characteristics, and their broader implications for scaling pulsed laser ablation in liquids to meet industrial demands are highlighted, offering a comprehensive perspective on the future of this dynamic field.

Title: Pauli Propagation: Simulating Quantum Spin Dynamics via Operator Complexity
Authors: Yuguo Shao, Song Cheng, Zhengwei Liu
Abstract: Simulating real-time quantum dynamics in interacting spin systems is a fundamental challenge, where exact diagonalization suffers from exponential Hilbert-space growth and tensor-network methods face entanglement barriers. In this work, we introduce a scalable Pauli propagation approach that evolves local observables directly in the Heisenberg picture. Theoretically, we derive a priori error bounds governed by the Operator Stabilizer Rényi entropy (OSE) $\mathcal{S}^\alpha(O)$, which explicitly links the truncation accuracy to operator complexity and prescribes a suitable Top-$K$ truncation strategy. For the 1D Heisenberg model with $J_z = 0$, we prove the number of non-zero Pauli coefficients scales quadratically in Trotter steps, establishing the compressibility of Heisenberg-evolved operators. Numerically, we validate the framework on XXZ Heisenberg chain benchmarks, showing high accuracy with small $K$ in free regimes ($J_z = 0$) and competitive performance against tensor-network methods (e.g., TDVP) in interacting cases ($J_z = 0.5$). These results establish an observable-centric simulator whose cost is governed by operator complexity rather than entanglement, offering a practical alternative for studying non-equilibrium dynamics in quantum many-body systems.

Title: Nonlinear optical behavior of confined electrons under torsion and magnetic fields
Authors: Carlos Magno O. Pereira, Edilberto O. Silva
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the influence of torsion, Aharonov-Bohm flux, and external magnetic fields on the linear and nonlinear optical properties of a confined quantum system. The confinement potential is not assumed a priori, but emerges as a radial effective potential, analogous to a quantum dot, geometrically induced by the torsion of the material. Starting from an effective radial equation derived in a nontrivial geometric background, we analytically solve for the energy spectrum and wave functions. These solutions are then employed to evaluate the optical absorption coefficients and refractive index changes, including both linear and third-order nonlinear contributions. The formalism incorporates the electric dipole approximation and accounts for intensity-dependent effects such as saturation and spectral shifts. Our results reveal that torsion and topological parameters significantly modify the optical response, leading to tunable resonances and nontrivial dispersive behavior. This work highlights the potential of geometric and topological engineering in low-dimensional systems to control and enhance nonlinear optical phenomena.

Title: Making the Virtual Real: Measurement-Powered Tunneling Engines
Authors: Rafael Sánchez, Alok Nath Singh, Andrew N. Jordan, Bibek Bhandari
Abstract: Quantum tunneling allows electrons to be transferred between two regions separated by an energetically forbidden barrier. Performing a position measurement that finds a particle in the barrier forces the tunneling electrons to transition from having a classically forbidden energy to an energy above the barrier height. We exploit this effect to define quantum tunneling engines that can use the unconditioned detection of virtually occupied states as a resource for power generation and cooling. Leveraging energy exchange with the detector, we show that the device can operate in a hybrid regime, enabling simultaneous cooling and power generation. Furthermore, we demonstrate measurement-assisted autonomous refrigeration and "checkpoint" cooling driven purely by a thermal bias, without the need for an applied potential. We also find a "purification-by-noise" effect when the measurement drives the system into a stationary dark state. These results underscore the intriguing dual role of measurement as a thermodynamic resource and a dark state generator.

Title: Computing Solvation Shell Dynamics and Energetics in Electron Transfer Reactions via Molecular Dynamics Simulations
Authors: Zhenyu Wang, Mira Todorova, Christoph Freysoldt, Jörg Neugebauer
Abstract: Marcus theory is fundamental to describing electron transfer reactions and quantifying their rates, effectively representing the energy surface associated with an electron transfer from the reactant to the product ionic state via parabolas within a reaction coordinate diagram. Here, we present an intuitive and computationally efficient generalised reaction coordinate amenable to molecular dynamics simulations. By utilising the nuclear charge of the ion, we are able to quantify in a targeted approach changes in the ion's solvation shell, thereby efficiently obtaining the free energy profile associated with the electron transfer, the transition state geometry and the evolution of the water network.

Title: Non-equilibrium Molecular Dynamics Study of Surface Wettability Effects on Pool Boiling of Water over Nanoscale Aluminum Substrate
Authors: Farhad Sotoudeh, Jafar Ghazanfarian
Abstract: Non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations were used to study pool boiling of water films on an ultra-thin planar aluminum substrate as well as the effect of surface wettability. The simulation geometry is a 10 nm-thick water film on an FCC aluminum substrate heated from 300 K to 900 K. The first peak acceleration onset time of the film, as the measure of the nucleation start, has been observed. The average heating rates of the near-wall water were 0.064, 0.048, and 0.035 K/ps for hydrophilic, neutral, and hydrophobic surfaces, respectively. Boiling curves shows that the critical heat flux (CHF) equals 5216, 3979, and 2525 MW/m^2 at wall temperatures of 466, 502, and 561 K, respectively. The minimum heat flux (MHF, Leidenfrost point) is equal to 2157, 2463, and 2366 MW/m^2 at wall temperatures of 767, 784, and 746 K, respectively. Interfacial HTC remains higher for longer times under the hydrophilic condition, whereas Kapitza resistance is low initially but then increases sharply after transition to film boiling with the highest values for the hydrophobic surface. In general, the results demonstrate that engineering aluminum wettability towards intense hydrophilicity diminishes the explosive boiling point, increases CHF, and enhances nanoscale thermal management performance.

Title: Accelerating Materials Design via LLM-Guided Evolutionary Search
Authors: Nikhil Abhyankar, Sanchit Kabra, Saaketh Desai, Chandan K. Reddy
Abstract: Materials discovery requires navigating vast chemical and structural spaces while satisfying multiple, often conflicting, objectives. We present LLM-guided Evolution for MAterials design (LLEMA), a unified framework that couples the scientific knowledge embedded in large language models with chemistry-informed evolutionary rules and memory-based refinement. At each iteration, an LLM proposes crystallographically specified candidates under explicit property constraints; a surrogate-augmented oracle estimates physicochemical properties; and a multi-objective scorer updates success/failure memories to guide subsequent generations. Evaluated on 14 realistic tasks spanning electronics, energy, coatings, optics, and aerospace, LLEMA discovers candidates that are chemically plausible, thermodynamically stable, and property-aligned, achieving higher hit-rates and stronger Pareto fronts than generative and LLM-only baselines. Ablation studies confirm the importance of rule-guided generation, memory-based refinement, and surrogate prediction. By enforcing synthesizability and multi-objective trade-offs, LLEMA delivers a principled pathway to accelerate practical materials discovery. Code: this https URL

Title: Krylov Complexity and Mixed-State Phase Transition
Authors: Hung-Hsuan Teh, Takahiro Orito
Abstract: We establish a unified framework connecting decoherence and quantum complexity. By vectorizing the density matrix into a pure state in a double Hilbert space, a decoherence process is mapped to an imaginary-time evolution. Expanding this evolution in the Krylov space, we find that the $n$-th Krylov basis corresponds to an $n$-error state generated by the decoherence, providing a natural bridge between error proliferation and complexity growth. Using two dephasing quantum channels as concrete examples, we show that the Krylov complexity remains nonsingular for strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry-breaking (SWSSB) crossovers, while it exhibits a singular area-to-volume-law transition for genuine SWSSB phase transitions, intrinsic to mixed states.

Title: The Thermodynamics of the Gravity from Entropy Theory: from the Hamiltonian to applications in Cosmology
Authors: Ginestra Bianconi
Abstract: The Gravity from Entropy (GfE) action posits that the fundamental nature of gravity is information encoded in the metric degrees of freedom. This statistical mechanics theory leads to modified gravity equations that reduce to the Einstein equations in the limit of low energy and small curvature. Here we embrace a thermodynamic point of view to derive the Hamiltonian associated with this theory. Focusing on isotropic spacetimes, we derive the thermodynamic properties of the GfE theory. We reveal that the FRW metrics are associated with $k$-temperature and $k$-pressure which are related to their local Geometric Quantum Relative Entropy (GQRE) and their local energy by the first law of GfE thermodynamics. The thermodynamics of the GfE theory is illustrated for the case of Friedmann universes that are solutions of the GfE equations of motion in the low energy, small curvature limit. We show that while the total GQRE for unit volume is not increasing, coherently with its relative entropy nature, the total entropy of Friedmann universes is not decreasing in time.

Title: Mesoscopic Modeling of High-Density Carbon Nanotube Films for Memristive Device Applications
Authors: Yvelin Giret, Filippo Federici Canova, Al-Moatasem El-Sayed, Thomas R. Durrant, Rahul Sen, Harry Luan, Gennadi Bersuker, Alexander L. Shluger, David Z. Gao
Abstract: Carbon nanotube (CNTs) materials, which exhibit intrinsically high electrical conductivity, are promising candidates for energy-efficient electronic devices. Recently, high-density CNT films have also been successfully employed as switching elements in non-volatile memory cells. However, the mechanism of electrical conduction through such complex systems is still poorly understood. To identify structural parameters that govern the electrical current in CNT films, we employed coarse-grained molecular dynamics to construct dense mesoscale CNT film models, where we considered CNTs with different chiralities and lengths. The effects of CNT geometrical features on the film morphologies were quantified by devising a set of structural descriptors and analyzing their mutual correlations. The impact of varying the concentration of amorphous carbon (aC) inclusions on the film structure was assessed. Finally, we employed a nodal analysis framework to compute the electrical current across the networks and correlate the charge transport characteristics to the underlying structural descriptors. Transport is found to be enhanced in films that exhibit high curvature and buckling, low bundling, and strong connectivity, with amorphous carbon components playing a nontrivial configuration-dependent role. These findings provide a framework for the rational design of CNT-based memristor architectures and highlight the potential of mesoscale modeling to guide the engineering of advanced nanostructured materials.

Title: Directionality-induced jamming in multiplex networks
Authors: Mateo Bouchet, Alejandro Tejedor, Xiangrong Wang, Yamir Moreno
Abstract: We study diffusion on multiplex networks with directed interlayer couplings. We demonstrate both numerically and analytically that even with undirected layers, interlayer directionality alone reproduces superdiffusion and the prime regime. We further reveal a new phenomenon, the directionality-induced jamming, whereby directed interlayer links hinder diffusion, fragmenting the system into dynamically disconnected components and preventing convergence to the steady state of the diffusion process. Via an optimization process, we show that this new regime is attainable in both toy models and real-world topologies. These findings underscore the crucial role of interlayer link directionality in shaping the emergent behavior of multiplex systems, with potential implications for the design and control of such systems.

Title: Radiation enhanced diffusion in cartilages as a physical mechanism underlying radiation treatments of osteoarthritis and related disorders
Authors: Diana Shvydka, Victor Karpov
Abstract: Degradation of joint cartilages can result in osteoarthritis (OA) affecting about 10\% of the US population and responsible for significant hospitalization costs. While observations show that low dose radiation treatments (LDRT) bring improvements for a majority of OA patients, the underlying mechanism is not sufficiently understood. Here, we show how the radiation enhanced diffusion (RED) can boost the molecular transport in cartilages promoting cartilage self-healing rendering a mechanism for the observed positive LDRT effects on OA. Along with quantitative estimates for RED, we predict a related phenomenon of the electric charge build up that allows LDRT schedules promoting desirable types of molecular transports dominated by either positive or negative molecular species. Our analyses call upon further experimental verifications and clinical trials with curative rather than palliative intent. In addition to OA applications, our developed approaches can be useful for sports medicine dealing with damage or degeneration of the articular cartilages.

Title: LLM Meets Diffusion: A Hybrid Framework for Crystal Material Generation
Authors: Subhojyoti Khastagir, Kishalay Das, Pawan Goyal, Seung-Cheol Lee, Satadeep Bhattacharjee, Niloy Ganguly
Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling have shown significant promise in designing novel periodic crystal structures. Existing approaches typically rely on either large language models (LLMs) or equivariant denoising models, each with complementary strengths: LLMs excel at handling discrete atomic types but often struggle with continuous features such as atomic positions and lattice parameters, while denoising models are effective at modeling continuous variables but encounter difficulties in generating accurate atomic compositions. To bridge this gap, we propose CrysLLMGen, a hybrid framework that integrates an LLM with a diffusion model to leverage their complementary strengths for crystal material generation. During sampling, CrysLLMGen first employs a fine-tuned LLM to produce an intermediate representation of atom types, atomic coordinates, and lattice structure. While retaining the predicted atom types, it passes the atomic coordinates and lattice structure to a pre-trained equivariant diffusion model for refinement. Our framework outperforms state-of-the-art generative models across several benchmark tasks and datasets. Specifically, CrysLLMGen not only achieves a balanced performance in terms of structural and compositional validity but also generates more stable and novel materials compared to LLM-based and denoisingbased models Furthermore, CrysLLMGen exhibits strong conditional generation capabilities, effectively producing materials that satisfy user-defined constraints.

Title: Tensor network methods for quantum-inspired image processing and classical optics
Authors: Nicolas Allegra
Abstract: Tensor network methods strike a middle ground between fully-fledged quantum computing and classical computing, as they take inspiration from quantum systems to significantly speed up certain classical operations. Their strength lies in their compressive power and the wide variety of efficient algorithms that operate within this compressed space. In this work, we focus on applying these methods to fundamental problems in image processing and classical optics such as wave-front propagation and optical image formation, by using directly or indirectly parallels with quantum mechanics and computation. These quantum-inspired methods are expected to yield faster algorithms with applications ranging from astronomy and earth observation to microscopy and classical imaging more broadly.

Title: Chaos in Systems with Quantum Group Symmetry
Authors: Victor Gorbenko, Aleksandr Zhabin
Abstract: Quantum groups have a long and fruitful history of applications in integrable systems. Can quantum group symmetries exist in the absence of integrability? We provide an explicit example of a system with quantum group global symmetry which is chaotic. The example is a spin chain with next-to-nearest interaction term. We show the chaotic behavior of the system by studying the Eigenvalue statistics. The spin chain is non-unitary but PT-symmetric and, in addition to chaos, exhibits an interesting transition after which the eigenvalues become complex.

Title: Analytic $G_0W_0$ gradients based on a double-similarity transformation equation-of-motion coupled-cluster treatment
Authors: Marios-Petros Kitsaras, Johannes Tölle, Pierre-François Loos
Abstract: The accurate prediction of ionization potentials (IPs) is central to understanding molecular reactivity, redox behavior, and spectroscopic properties. While vertical IPs can be accessed directly from electronic excitations at fixed nuclear geometries, the computation of adiabatic IPs requires nuclear gradients of the ionized states, posing a major theoretical and computational challenge, especially within correlated frameworks. Among the most promising approaches for IP calculations is the many-body Green's function $GW$ method, which provides a balanced compromise between accuracy and computational efficiency. Furthermore, it is applicable to both finite and extended systems. Recent work has established formal connections between $GW$ and coupled-cluster doubles (CCD) theory, leading to the first derivation of analytic $GW$ nuclear gradients via a unitary CCD framework. In this work, we present an alternative, fully analytic formulation of $GW$ nuclear gradients based on a modified version of the traditional equation-of-motion CCD formalism, enabling the inclusion of missing correlation effects in the traditional CCD methods.

Title: Ground and excited potential energy surfaces for CaF+Ca interactions and isotope exchange reactions
Authors: Dibyendu Sardar, John L. Bohn
Abstract: We investigate the intermolecular interactions between laser-cooled CaF and Ca, in their ground and excited electronic states, aiming to understand atom-exchange reaction pathways. Using state-of-the-art \textit{ab initio} quantum chemistry methods, we compute potential energy surfaces for nine electronic states arising from the lowest three asymptotes of Ca$_2$F trimer, within the rigid rotor approximation applied to CaF. Two-dimensional potential energy surfaces are computed for the ground state and one of the excited states. We use a combination of the coupled cluster method restricted to single, double, and perturbative triple excitations, and the multireference configuration interaction method with single and double excitations. The ground (X)~$^2\mathrm{A}'$ electronic state of the trimer is significantly deep and highly anisotropic. The excited electronic states are also strongly bound. Notably, the potential energy surface of one of the excited states, (2)~$^2\mathrm{A}'$, lies below the ground-state asymptote of the trimer. By analyzing the potential energy surfaces, we discuss atom-exchange reaction pathways involving both the ground-state interaction between CaF and Ca and the excited metastable state of Ca.

Title: Genetic interfaces at the frontier of expanding microbial colonies
Authors: Jonathan Bauermann, David R. Nelson
Abstract: We study the genetic interfaces between two species of an expanding colony that consists of individual microorganisms that reproduce and undergo diffusion, both at the frontier and in the interior. Within the bulk of the colony, the genetic interface is controlled in a simple way via interspecies interactions. However, at the frontier of the colony, the genetic interface width saturates at finite values for long times, both for neutral strains and interspecies interactions such as antagonism. This finite width arises from geometric effects: genetic interfaces drift toward local minima at an undulating colony frontier, where a focusing mechanism induced by curvature impedes diffusive mixing. Numerical simulations support a logarithmic dependence of the genetic interface width on the strength of the number fluctuations.

Title: Filling the Gap: Atom Probe Tomography of Porous Structures Enabled by Site Specific SEMGlu Curing
Authors: Lukas Worch, James O. Douglas, Kavin Arunasalam, Baptiste Gault, Valeria Nicolosi, Michele Shelly Conroy
Abstract: Porous microstructures, while central to many functional materials, remain difficult to characterize quantitatively by atom probe tomography (APT). Although several strategies have been proposed over the past decade, most remain constrained by significant practical or technical limitations. Here, we introduce an in situ pore filling approach that integrates seamlessly into conventional specimen preparation workflows. The method employs a vacuum compatible resin that is rapidly cured by the electron beam during standard ion beam based preparation, eliminating the need for additional instrumentation or extensive sample handling. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach using a porous SnSe + MXene electrode, a material system otherwise difficult to analyze via APT characterisation. This method offers a robust, accessible solution for extending APT analysis to porous materials

Title: High-Speed Imagery Analysis of Droplet Impact on Van der Waals and Non-Van der Waals Soft-Textured Oil-Infused Surfaces
Authors: Shubham S. Ganar, Deepak J., Arindam Das
Abstract: This study investigates the impact of surface functionalization, oil coating, and oil absorption on droplet impact behavior on textured polydimethylsiloxane(PDMS) substrates. The textured surfaces were fabricated with square micro-posts having spacings of 5 and 20 microns. The PDMS samples were functionalized with octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) to improve water repellency. Following, the surfaces were either coated with or allowed to absorb two different lubricants, silicone oil (SO-5cSt) and hexadecane. We performed detailed wetting measurements on both untreated and OTS-functionalized substrates. These measurements provided useful insights into how water and lubricants were retained and distributed under static conditions. High-speed imaging was used to capture droplet impact across a range of Weber numbers. On SO-5cSt-absorbed substrates, droplets consistently showed complete rebound at all Weber numbers, regardless of post spacing. This robust rebound was attributed to the oil's ability to fill the gaps between the posts through capillary action, while also forming a stable lubricating layer above the texture. This thin oil film reduced friction between the droplet and the surface, enabling the droplet to retain sufficient energy for complete rebound. In contrast, hexadecane-absorbed substrates displayed different dynamics. At low Weber numbers, only partial rebound was observed, while at intermediate values, droplets rebounded completely. However, droplets no longer rebounded at higher Weber numbers and remained deposited. Repeated droplet impacts further demonstrated that hexadecane-infused surfaces gradually lost oil from the textured gaps, resulting in a decline in rebound performance over time. This effect was not observed with SO-5cSt, underscoring the importance of lubricant affinity and stability.

Title: Many-body chaos and pole-skipping in holographic charged rotating fluids
Authors: Hong-Da Lyu, Jun-Kun Zhao, Li Li
Abstract: Recent developments identify pole-skipping as a `smoking-gun' signature of the hydrodynamic nature of chaos, offering an alternative way to probe quantum chaos in addition to the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC). We study the quantum chaos and pole-skipping phenomenon in the strongly coupled charged rotating fluids, holographically dual to rotating black holes with nontrivial gauge field. We find that the near-horizon equation governing energy-density fluctuations differs from the source-less shock wave equation determining the OTOC, which depends on the $U(1)$ gauge choice. This discrepancy is eliminated under an appropriate boundary condition on the $U(1)$ gauge potential at the event horizon, as required by the vanishing of Wilson loop at the Euclidean horizon. We further investigate the dependence of the butterfly velocity on the charge and rotation parameters in a specific black hole configuration--the Cvetič-Lü-Pope solution.

Title: Gaussian tomography for cold-atom simulators
Authors: Matthew Kiser, Max McGinley, Daniel Malz
Abstract: A limitation of analog quantum simulators based on cold atoms in optical lattices is that readout is typically limited to observables diagonal in the charge basis, i.e., densities and density correlation functions. To overcome this limitation, we propose experiment-friendly schemes to measure charge-off-diagonal correlations (such as currents). Our protocols use non-interacting dynamics for random times followed by standard quantum gas microscope measurements to effectively measure in random bases. The main requirement of our scheme is the ability to turn off interactions, which can be done in many atomic species using Feshbach resonances. Importantly, our scheme requires no local control and otherwise also exhibits modest requirements in terms of total evolution time and number of repetitions. We numerically demonstrate efficient estimation of bilinear correlation functions, requiring less than $4000$ samples to measure local currents to 5% error (system-size independent) and $\sim 10^4$ samples to simultaneously measure all non-local correlations in 70-site systems. Due to its simplicity, our protocol is implementable in existing platforms and thus paves the way to precision measurements beyond particle number measurements.

Title: A First Experiment at Interfacing Crystal Plasticity and Continuum Dislocation Dynamics
Authors: Khaled SharafEldin, Peng Lin, Vignesh Vivekanandan, Gustavo M. Castelluccio, Benjamin Anglin, Anter El-Azab
Abstract: A computational approach has been developed for the analysis of the properties of 3D dislocation substructures generated by the vector density continuum dislocation dynamics (CDD), within the framework of crystal plasticity. In the CDD framework, the dislocation density on the individual slip systems is represented by vector fields with a unique dislocation line direction at each point in space. The evolution of these density fields is governed by a set of transport-reaction equations coupled with crystal mechanics. This detailed picture of the dislocation system enables mesoscale plasticity simulations based on dislocation properties at the lattice level. In the current work, a computational approach based on streamline construction is proposed to obtain the statistical properties of the dislocation substructures generated by CDD. Streamlines are obtained by travelling along the tangent of the vector density and velocity fields of the dislocation system, which enables us to construct the dislocation lines and their paths in the deformed crystal in 3D. The streamlines are computed by numerical integration of a set of partial differential equations for the parameterized tangent fields. Here, we use this approach to extract microstructure parameters from the CDD simulations that are relevant to substructure-sensitive crystal plasticity models. These parameters include the mean free path and average mobile dislocation segment length, as well as the dislocation wall volume fraction, together with the corresponding distributions. The results show that, past a short initial rise during monotonic loading, both the mobile dislocation segment length and dislocation mean free path decrease with the applied strain, which is consistent with the models used in the crystal plasticity literature.

Title: Thermal decoupling in high-$T_c$ cuprate superconductors
Authors: Sungwoo Lee, Woojin Choi, Yeongjae Kim, Young-Kyun Kwon, Dongjoon Song, Miyoung Kim, Gun-Do Lee
Abstract: In unconventional high-$T_c$ cuprate superconductors, the intricate interplay between the non-ergodic bad metal and the strange metal state has remained enigmatic. Herein, we unravel this mystery using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and the temperature-dependent effective potential method. Our investigation, centered on YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ , provides the first simulation report on the $B_{1g}$ phonon anomaly, unveiling thermal decoupling induced by the bond weakening between the Ba atom and CuO$_2$ plane. This decoupling emerges as a pivotal underpinning behind several puzzling phenomena in high-$T_c$ superconductivity. Our results indicate that the effective temperature on the BaO plane deviates from that of the CuO$_2$ plane at low temperatures. Furthermore, we delineate the correlation between thermal decoupling and the Planckian dissipation, rigorously and quantitatively revealing a connection between linear-$T$ resistivity, Uemura relation, and superconducting domes, which are known to be the most important unsolved mysteries of high-$T_c$ superconductivity. The suppressed isotope effect ($\boldsymbol{\alpha}$ $\approx$ 0.02) in cuprates is also quantitatively explained from thermal decoupling. Our discoveries offer a revolutionary perspective on high-$T_c$ superconductivity, suggesting the potential for a transformative shift in our comprehension. Furthermore, they suggest that the autonomous emergence of low-temperature layers within materials has the potential to revolutionize industrial thermal management challenges.

Title: Yielding in amorphous solids reveals an age-dependent intrinsic lengthscale
Authors: Aparna Sreekumari, Monoj Adhikari, Nandlal Pingua, Vishnu V. Krishnan, Shilditya Sengupta, Pinaki Chaudhuri, Smarajit Karmakar, Vishwas V. Vasisht
Abstract: Understanding how amorphous solids yield under shear is central to predicting material failure, yet prescribing reliable local yielding criteria remains a fundamental challenge. Here, through a mesoscale analysis of localized yielding, we reveal an intrinsic length scale (\zeta) that governs local failure, and demonstrate that \zeta grows with the age of the system. The age dependence shows up not only in the features of the distribution of local yield stress but also in the pseudogap exponent \theta, which provides a measure of marginal stability of the amorphous solids. These insights are made possible by a new method, termed the soft matrix approach, that allows local regions of an amorphous solid to yield within a minimally constrained, elastically coupled environment. By overcoming key limitations of earlier techniques, our approach provides a robust platform for probing failure mechanisms, particularly in soft disordered materials and paves the way for improved elastoplastic modeling of disordered solids.

Title: $Δ_T$ Noise in Mesoscopic Hybrid Junctions: Influence of Barrier Strength and Thermal Bias
Authors: Sachiraj Mishra, A Rajmohan Dora, Tusaradri Mohapatra, Colin Benjamin
Abstract: Quantum noise is a fundamental probe of quantum transport phenomena, offering insights into current correlations and wave-particle duality. A particularly intriguing form of such noise, $\Delta_T$ noise, emerges under a finite temperature difference in the absence of charge current at zero voltage bias. In this work, we investigate $\Delta_T$ noise in mesoscopic hybrid junctions incorporating insulating barriers, where the average charge current remains zero at zero bias. Using quantum shot noise measurements, we demonstrate that $\Delta_T$ noise in metal-insulator-superconductor (NIS) junctions is approximately $16$ times greater than in metal-insulator-metal (NIN) counterparts. Our analysis further reveals that $\Delta_T$ noise exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on barrier strength, rising to a peak before declining, while increasing monotonically with the applied temperature bias. These findings underscore the rich interplay between thermal gradients and barrier properties in determining quantum noise characteristics in hybrid mesoscopic systems.

Title: Pair-density-wave phase of strongly interacting electrons on the triangular lattice: A variational Monte Carlo study
Authors: Jiucai Wang, Wen Sun, Hao-Xin Wang, Zhaoyu Han, Steven A. Kivelson, Hong Yao
Abstract: A robust theory of the mechanism of pair density wave (PDW) superconductivity (i.e. where Cooper pairs have nonzero center of mass momentum) remains elusive. Here we explore the triangular lattice $t$-$J$-$V$ model, a low-energy effective theory derived from the strong-coupling limit of the Holstein-Hubbard model, by large-scale variational Monte Carlo simulations. When the electron density is sufficiently low, the favored ground state is an s-wave PDW, consistent with results obtained from previous studies in this limit. Additionally, a PDW ground state with nematic d-wave pairing emerges in the intermediate range of electron densities and phonon frequencies. For these s-wave and d-wave PDWs arising in states with spontaneous breaking of time-reversal and inversion symmetries, PDW formation derives from valley-polarization and intra-pocket pairing.

Abstract: Geometrically frustrated magnetic systems, such as those based on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice (SSL), offer a rich playground for exploring unconventional magnetic states. The delicate balance between competing interactions in these systems leads to the emergence of novel phases. We present the characterization of Er2Be2GeO7, an SSL compound with Er3+ ions forming orthogonal dimers separated by non-magnetic layers whose structure is invariant under the P-421m space group. Neutron scattering reveals an antiferromagnetic dimer structure at zero field, typical of Ising spins on that lattice and consistent with the anisotropic magnetization observed. However, magnetization measurements exhibit fractional plateaus at 1/4 and 1/2 of saturation, in contrast to the expected 1/3 plateau of the SSL Ising model. By comparing the energy of candidate states with ground-state lower bounds we show that this behavior requires spatially anisotropic interactions, leading to an anisotropic Shastry-Sutherland Ising Model (ASSLIM) symmetric under the Cmm2 space group. This anisotropy is consistent with the small orthorhombic distortion observed with single-crystal neutron diffraction. The other properties, including thermodynamics, which have been investigated theoretically using tensor networks, point to small residual interactions, potentially due to further couplings and quantum fluctuations. This study highlights Er2Be2GeO7 as a promising platform for investigating exotic magnetic phenomena.

Title: Universal quasi-Fermi liquid physics of one-dimensional interacting fermions
Authors: Joshua D. Baktay, Adrian E. Feiguin, Julian Rincon
Abstract: We present a class of one-dimensional generic spinless fermion lattice Hamiltonians that express quasi-Fermi liquid physics, manifesting both Luttinger and Fermi liquid features due to solely irrelevant interactions. Using infinite matrix product state techniques, we unveil its universal structure by calculating static and dynamic responses. Key features include a finite discontinuity in the momentum distribution at the Fermi level, despite power-law singularities in the spectral function protected by particle-hole symmetry. Away from half-filling Landau quasiparticles emerge. Charge dynamics show either high-energy bound states or concentration of spectral weight within the continuum for attractive or repulsive interactions, respectively. These universal features are realized across multiple models and energy scales thus reifying the quasi-Fermi liquid as a unique paradigm for one-dimensional fermions.

Title: Chiral Spin Liquid and Quantum Phase Transition in the Triangular Lattice Hofstadter-Hubbard Model
Authors: Stefan Divic, Tomohiro Soejima, Valentin Crépel, Michael P. Zaletel, Andrew Millis
Abstract: Recent advances in moiré engineering motivate the study of lattice models of strongly-correlated electrons subjected to substantial orbital magnetic flux. We analyze the triangular lattice Hofstadter-Hubbard model at one-quarter flux quantum per plaquette and a density of one electron per site, where a chiral spin liquid phase may exist between weak-coupling integer quantum Hall and strong-coupling 120$^\circ$ antiferromagnetic phases. We use matrix product state methods and analytical arguments to investigate this model compactified to cylinders of finite circumference. We uncover a glide particle-hole symmetry operation which, we argue, is spontaneously broken at the quantum Hall to spin liquid transition on odd-circumference cylinders. We numerically verify the spontaneous symmetry breaking and further demonstrate that this transition is associated with algebraic long-range correlations of various spin-singlet, charge-neutral operators. For even-circumference cylinders, the transition becomes a crossover associated with a large correlation length that grows substantially with circumference. Our findings suggest that in the two-dimensional limit, the transition to a chiral spin liquid phase is continuous and features critical fluctuations of the current.

Title: Orbital Magnetic Field Driven Metal-Insulator Transition in Strongly Correlated Electron Systems
Authors: Georg Rohringer, Anton A. Markov
Abstract: We study the effects of an orbital magnetic field on the Mott metal-insulator transition in the Hubbard-Hofstadter model. We demonstrate that sufficiently large magnetic fields induce a Mott insulator-to-metal phase transition supporting our claim with dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) numerical results. For both competing phases (metal and insulator) we observe a magnetic-fieldinduced metallization reflected in an enhancement of kinetic and potential energy. The kinetic energy of the Mott insulator increases due to the Aharonov-Bohm effect experienced by electrons virtually tunneling around an elementary plaquette which is, however, suppressed by strong correlations. The kinetic energy of the metallic phase, on the other hand, is more strongly affected by the magnetic field through a field-driven redistribution of spectral weight due to the formation of magnetic minibands. This leads to an increase of the kinetic energy which tends to stabilize the metallic state. Our theoretical results might be relevant for recent experimental studies on magnetic field driven insulator-to-metal transitions in strongly correlated materials such as VO2, $\lambda$-type organic conductors and moiré multilayers.

Title: Vacancy-Induced Quantum Properties in 2D Silicon Carbide: Atomistic insights from semi-local and hybrid DFT calculations
Authors: Abhirup Patra
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials have emerged as promising platforms for quantum technologies and optoelectronics, with defects playing a crucial role in their properties. We present a comprehensive density functional theory study of silicon and carbon vacancies in monolayer silicon carbide (1L-SiC), a wide-bandgap 2D semiconductor with potential for room-temperature quantum applications. Using PBE, SCAN, r$^2$SCAN, and HSE06 functionals, we reveal distinct characteristics between Si and C vacancies. Formation energies and charge transition levels show strong functional dependence, with HSE06 consistently predicting higher values and deeper transition levels compared to PBE calculations. Electronic structure analysis demonstrates contrasting behavior: silicon vacancies create highly localized states with strong spin polarization, while carbon vacancies produce more dispersed states with weaker magnetic properties. Vacancy migration studies reveal significantly lower barriers for silicon vacancies compared to carbon vacancies, indicating higher mobility for Si vacancies at moderate temperatures. Optical properties, calculated using PBE-DFPT, show distinct charge-state dependent absorption in the far-infrared region, with positively charged states of both vacancy types demonstrating the strongest response. The complementary characteristics of Si and C vacancies - localized versus dispersed states, different magnetic properties, and distinct optical responses - suggest possibilities for defect engineering in quantum and optoelectronic applications. Our results highlight the critical importance of advanced functionals in accurately describing defect properties and provide a comprehensive framework for understanding vacancy behavior in 2D materials.

Title: First principles approaches and concepts for electrochemical systems
Authors: Mira Todorova, Stefan Wippermann, Jörg Neugebauer
Abstract: Ab initio techniques have revolutionised the way in which theory can help practitioners to explore critical mechanisms that govern reactions or properties, and to develop new strategies for materials discovery and design. Yet, their application to electrochemical systems is still limited, due to the challenges electronic structure calculations face in achieving a realistic description of electrified solid/liquid interfaces including, e.g., potential and pH control or free energies of barrier configurations. A well-known example of how novel concepts can extend the scope of simulations is the development of thermostats, which introduced temperature control to electronic structure Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. The analogous technique for modelling electrochemical systems - potential control, inherent to most electrochemical experiments - is just emerging. In this review, we critically discuss state-of-the-art approaches to describe electrified interfaces between a solid electrode and a liquid electrolyte in realistic environments. By exchanging energy, electronic charge and ions with their environment, electrochemical interfaces are thermodynamically open systems. In addition, large fluctuations of the electrostatic potential and field occur on the time and length scales relevant to chemical reactions. We systematically discuss the key challenges in incorporating these features into realistic ab initio simulations, as well as the available techniques and approaches to overcome them, in order to facilitate the development and use of these novel techniques by the wider community. These methodological developments provide researchers with a new level of realism to explore fundamental electrochemical mechanisms and reactions from first principles.

Title: Coexistence of insulator-like paramagnon and metallic spin-orbit exciton modes in SrIrO$_3$
Authors: Eugenio Paris, Wenliang Zhang, Yi Tseng, Anna Efimenko, Christoph Sahle, Vladimir N. Strocov, Elizabeth Skoropata, Katharina Rolfs, Tian Shang, Jike Lyu, Ekaterina Pomjakushina, Marisa Medarde, Henrik M. Rønnow, Bruce Normand, Milan Radovic, Thorsten Schmitt
Abstract: We probe the spectrum of elementary excitations in SrIrO$_3$ by using heterostructured [(SrIrO$_3$)$_m$/(SrTiO$_3$)$_l$] samples to approach the bulk limit. Our resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) measurements at the Ir $L_3$-edge reveal a robust low-lying collective magnetic mode with an antiferromagnetic (AF) dispersion similar to the insulators Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ and Sr$_3$Ir$_2$O$_7$, albeit with a large gap and much larger linewidth. At higher energies we find the spin-orbit exciton, also strongly broadened, but with an inverted dispersion and doubled periodicity that are controlled by the charge hopping. These results demonstrate that the AF paramagnon persists, somewhat counterintuitively, far into the metallic regime of the insulator-metal transition driven by the degree of confinement in the heterostructure. We conclude that these two excitations, which are contrasting but coexisting hallmarks of strong AF pseudospin and charge fluctuations in a spin-orbit-coupled Mott-Slater material, are properties intrinsic to the ground state of semimetallic perovskite SrIrO$_3$.

Title: Stabilization of active tissue deformation by a dynamic signaling gradient
Authors: Muhamet Ibrahimi, Matthias Merkel
Abstract: A key process during animal morphogenesis is oriented tissue deformation, which is often driven by internally generated active stresses. Yet, such active oriented materials are prone to well-known instabilities, raising the question of how oriented tissue deformation can be robust during morphogenesis. Here we study under which conditions active oriented deformation can be stabilized by the concentration pattern of a signaling molecule, which is secreted by a localized source region, diffuses across the tissue, and degrades. Consistent with earlier results, we find that oriented tissue deformation is always unstable in the gradient-contractile case, i.e. when active stresses act to contract the tissue along the direction of the signaling gradient, and we now show that this is true even in the limit of large diffusion. However, active deformation can be stabilized in the gradient-extensile case, i.e. when active stresses act to extend the tissue along the direction of the signaling gradient. Specifically, we show that gradient-extensile systems can be stable when the tissue is already elongated in the direction of the gradient. We moreover point out the existence of a formerly unknown, additional instability of the tissue shape change. This instability results from the interplay of active tissue shear and signal diffusion, and it indicates that some additional feedback mechanism may be required to control the target tissue shape. Taken together, our theoretical results provide quantitative criteria for robust active tissue deformation, and explain the lack of gradient-contractile systems in the biological literature, suggesting that the active matter instability acts as an evolutionary selection criterion.

Title: Simulation of the thermocapillary assembly of a colloidal cluster during the evaporation of a liquid film in an unevenly heated cell
Authors: Kristina N. Kondrashova, Konstantin S. Kolegov, Irina V. Vodolazskaya
Abstract: The control of the thermocapillary assembly of colloidal particle clusters is important for a variety of applications, including the creation of photonic crystals for microelectronics and optoelectronics, membrane formation for biotechnology, and surface cleaning for laboratory-on-chip devices. It is important to understand the main mechanisms that influence the formation of such clusters. This article considers a two-dimensional mathematical model describing the transfer of particles by a thermocapillary flow in an unevenly heated cell during the evaporation of a liquid. This gave us the opportunity to study one of the main processes that triggers the formation of a particle cluster. Whether the particle will move with the flow or stop at the heater, becoming the basis for the cluster, is determined by the ratio between gravity and the drag force. The results of numerical calculations show that, for small particle concentrations, their fraction entering the cluster decreases as the volumetric heat flux density $Q$ increases. The reason for this is an increase in the thermocapillary flow with an increase in the volumetric heat flux $Q$. It reduces the probability of particles entering the cluster.

Title: Laser-driven Ultrafast Dynamics of a Fractional Quantum Hall System
Authors: Ammar Kirmani, Benedikt Fauseweh, Jian-Xin Zhu
Abstract: Fractional quantum Hall (FQH) systems are strongly interacting electron systems with topological order. These systems are characterized by novel ground states, fractionally charged and neutral excitations. The neutral excitations are dominated by a low-energy collective magnetoroton mode. Here we derive and use a quasi-one-dimensional model to investigate the ultrafast nonequilibrium dynamics of a laser-driven FQH system within a two-Landau-level approximation. As opposed to the traditional and synthetic bilayers, our model accounts for interactions where electrons can scatter from one Landau-level to another. By performing exact time evolution of the system, we create an out-of-equilibrium state following the laser pulse that shows rich physics. Our calculations show the presence of non-trivial excited modes. One of these modes is electromagnetically active and represent density oscillations of \emph{magnetoplasmon} mode. Another mode is identified by evaluating the overlap of the initial state and the out-of-equilibrium state following the laser pulse with a quadrupole operator. This mode is analogous to the chiral-graviton mode for FQH systems recently measured in experiments [Nature {\bf 628}, 78 (2024)]. Our results show that a linearly-polarized pulse field can excite the graviton mode when inter-Landau level scattering occurs.

Title: Electronic structure of $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ kagome metals
Authors: Keyu Zeng, Zhan Wang, Kun Jiang, Ziqiang Wang
Abstract: The kagome metals $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A=$ K, Cs, Rb) have become a fascinating materials platform following the discovery of many novel quantum states due to the interplay between electronic correlation, topology, and geometry. Understanding their physical origin requires constructing effective theories that capture the low-energy electronic structure and electronic interactions. While the band structure calculated by density functional theory (DFT) broadly agrees with experiments in the unbroken symmetry phase, the multiorbital nature challenges a proper understanding of the band structure and its description by tight-binding models. Here, we point out the unusual and puzzling properties of the DFT electronic structure, including the sublattice type of the van Hove singularities, the geometric shape of the Fermi surface, and the orbital content of the low-energy band dispersion, which cannot be described by the commonly used one-orbital or multiorbital kagome tight-binding models. We address these fundamental puzzles and develop an extended Slater-Koster formalism that can successfully resolve these issues. We discover the important role of site-symmetry and interorbital hopping structure and provide a concrete multiorbital tight-binding model description of the electronic structure for $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ and the family of ``135'' compounds with other transition metals. This is a crucial step toward studying the effects of electron-electron interactions for the correlated and topological states in kagome metals and superconductors.

Title: Superconductivity and pair density waves from nearest-neighbor interactions in frustrated lattice geometries
Authors: Eeli O. Lamponen, Sofia K. Pöntys, Päivi Törmä
Abstract: We consider superconductivity and pair density waves (PDWs) arising from off-site pairing in frustrated lattice geometries. We express the pair susceptibility in a generic form that highlights the importance of both the density of states, and the quantum geometry of the eigenstates and calculate the superfluid weight (stiffness) as well as the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) temperature. Paradigmatic bipartite (Lieb) and non-bipartite (kagome) lattices are studied as examples. For bipartite lattices, nearest-neighbor pairing vanishes in a flat band. In the Lieb lattice flat band, we find a PDW at a finite interaction and show that its pair wave vector is determined by the quantum geometry of the band. In the kagome flat band, nearest-neighbor pairing is possible for infinitesimal interactions. At the kagome van Hove singularity, the pair susceptibility predicts a PDW due to sublattice interference, however, we find that its stiffness is zero due to the shape of the Fermi surface. Our results indicate that nearest-neighbor pairing at flat band and van Hove singularities is strongly influenced by the geometric properties of the eigenfunctions, and it is crucial to determine the superfluid weight of the superconducting and PDW orders as it may contradict the predictions by pairing susceptibility.

Title: From time crystals to time quasicrystals: Exploring quasiperiodic phases in transverse field Ising chains
Authors: Davood Marripour, Jahanfar Abouie
Abstract: Time quasicrystals (TQCs) represent a compelling extension of the concept of time crystals (TCs). While TCs break discrete time-translation symmetry by exhibiting a periodic response at a subharmonic of the driving frequency, TQCs display a more complex temporal order. They respond at multiple incommensurate frequencies, values that are not integer multiples of the fundamental driving frequency, resulting in quasiperiodic dynamics. In this work, we investigate the emergence of a TQC in a disordered quantum Ising chain subjected to a quasiperiodic transverse field. Using exact diagonalization, we find that the transverse magnetization exhibits quasiperiodic oscillations which persist over extended prethermal timescales before eventual decay. This indicates that the TQC exists as a long-lived, prethermal dynamical phase rather than a true equilibrium state. We further assess the robustness of this prethermal TQC against interactions and driving imperfections, confirming its stability under realistic experimental conditions. Finite-size analysis reveals that the prethermal TQC lifetime exhibits minimal dependence on system size. Additionally, we explore the emergence of TQCs in the same chain under symmetric sampling of exchange couplings. Our results demonstrate that the TQC phase is highly sensitive to both the choice of coupling distribution and the values of the driving frequencies. These findings highlight promising experimental prospects for realizing TQCs in cold atomic systems and quantum simulators, providing valuable insights into their stability, dynamical properties, and potential for exploring novel non-equilibrium quantum phases.

Title: Chiral Heisenberg Gross-Neveu-Yukawa criticality: honeycomb vs. SLAC fermions
Authors: Thomas C. Lang, Andreas M. Läuchli
Abstract: We perform large scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the Hubbard model at half filling with a single Dirac cone close to the critical point, which separates a Dirac semi-metal from an antiferromagnetically ordered phase where SU(2) spin rotational symmetry is spontaneously broken. We discuss the implementation of a single Dirac cone in the SLAC formulation for eight Dirac components and the influence of dynamically induced long-range super-exchange interactions. The finite size behavior of dimensionless ratios and the finite size scaling properties of the Hubbard model with a single Dirac cone are shown to be superior compared to the honeycomb lattice. We extract the critical exponent believed to belong to the chiral Heisenberg Gross-Neveu-Yukawa universality class: The critical exponent ${\nu = 1.02(3)}$ coincides for the two lattice types once honeycomb lattices of linear dimension ${L\ge 15}$ are considered. In contrast to the SLAC formulation, where the anomalous dimensions are estimated to be ${\eta_{\phi}=0.73(1)}$ and ${\eta_{\psi}=0.09(1)}$, they remain less stable on honeycomb lattices, but tend towards the estimates from the SLAC formulation.

Title: Ergodic behaviors in reversible 3-state cellular automata
Authors: Rustem Sharipov, Matija Koterle, Sašo Grozdanov, Tomaž Prosen
Abstract: Classical cellular automata represent a class of explicit discrete spacetime lattice models in which complex large-scale phenomena emerge from simple deterministic rules. With the goal to uncover different physically distinct classes of ergodic behavior, we perform a systematic study of three-state cellular automata (with a stable `vacuum' state and `particles' with $\pm$ charges). The classification is aided by the automata's different transformation properties under discrete symmetries: charge conjugation, spatial parity and time reversal. In particular, we propose a simple classification that distinguishes between types and levels of ergodic behavior in such system as quantified by the following observables: the mean return time, the number of conserved quantities, and the scaling of correlation functions. In each of the physically distinct classes, we present examples and discuss some of their phenomenology. This includes chaotic or ergodic dynamics, phase-space fragmentation, Ruelle-Pollicott resonances, existence of quasilocal charges, and anomalous transport with a variety of dynamical exponents.

Title: Active Hydrodynamic Theory of Euchromatin and Heterochromatin
Authors: S. Alex Rautu, Alexandra Zidovska, David Saintillan, Michael J. Shelley
Abstract: The genome contains genetic information essential for cell's life. The genome's spatial organization inside the cell nucleus is critical for its proper function including gene regulation. The two major genomic compartments -- euchromatin and heterochromatin -- contain largely transcriptionally active and silenced genes, respectively, and exhibit distinct dynamics. In this work, we present a hydrodynamic framework that describes the large-scale behavior of euchromatin and heterochromatin, and accounts for the interplay of mechanical forces, active processes, and nuclear confinement. Our model shows contractile stresses from cross-linking proteins lead to the formation of heterochromatin droplets via mechanically driven phase separation. These droplets grow, coalesce, and in nuclear confinement, wet the boundary. Active processes, such as gene transcription in euchromatin, introduce non-equilibrium fluctuations that drive long-range, coherent motions of chromatin as well as the nucleoplasm, and thus alter the genome's spatial organization. These fluctuations also indirectly deform heterochromatin droplets, by continuously changing their shape. Taken together, our findings reveal how active forces, mechanical stresses and hydrodynamic flows contribute to the genome's organization at large scales and provide a physical framework for understanding chromatin organization and dynamics in live cells.

Title: P-orbital spin generator with large spin Hall angle and long spin diffusion length
Authors: Gen Li, Ying Zhang, Xiaoguang Xu, Lei Shen, Zheng Feng, Kangkang Meng, Ang Li, Lu Cheng, Kang He, Wei Tan, Yong Wu, Yihong Wu, Yong Jiang
Abstract: High density data storage and spin-logic devices require highly efficient all-electric control of spin moments. So far, charge-to-spin conversion through the spin Hall effect (SHE) highly limits to d-orbital materials associated with strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC), especially heavy metals. However, d-orbital heavy metals with strong SOC results in a short spin diffusion length, which restricts the spin transport and accumulation in spintronic devices. Therefore, it is urgent to discovery new SHE materials with both large spin Hall conductivity and high spin transport ability beyond d-orbital materials. Here, we experimentally report a large charge to spin conversion in a p-orbital In2Bi alloy, exhibiting the coexistence of a large spin Hall angle and a long spin diffusion length (4 times that of Pt). Our first-principles calculations reveal that small gap openings near the Fermi level lead to large Berry curvature-related spin Hall conductivity. Due to the delocalized nature of p-orbitals of In2Bi, its spin current can overcome the physical barriers between spin Hall angle and spin diffusion length in d-orbital metals, thereby advancing the development of high performance spintronic devices.

Title: Hopf Exceptional Points
Authors: Tsuneya Yoshida, Emil J. Bergholtz, Tomáš Bzdušek
Abstract: Exceptional points at which eigenvalues and eigenvectors of non-Hermitian matrices coalesce are ubiquitous in the description of a wide range of platforms from photonic or mechanical metamaterials to open quantum systems. Here, we introduce a class of Hopf exceptional points (HEPs) that are protected by the Hopf invariants (including the higher-dimensional generalizations) and which exhibit phenomenology sharply distinct from conventional exceptional points. Saliently, owing to their $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant related to the Witten anomaly, three-fold HEPs and symmetry-protected five-fold HEPs act as their own ``antiparticles". Furthermore, based on higher homotopy groups of spheres, we predict the existence of multifold HEPs and symmetry-protected HEPs with non-Hermitian topology captured by a range of finite groups (such as $\mathbb{Z}_3$, $\mathbb{Z}_{12}$, or $\mathbb{Z}_{24}$) beyond the periodic table of Bernard-LeClair symmetry classes.

Title: Anisotropic Spin Ice on a Breathing Pyrochlore Lattice
Authors: Gloria Isbrandt, Frank Pollmann, Michael Knap
Abstract: Spin ice systems represent a prime example of constrained spin systems and exhibit rich low-energy physics. In this study, we explore how introducing a tunable anisotropic spin coupling to the conventional Ising spin ice Hamiltonian on the breathing pyrochlore lattice affects the ground state properties of the system. Significant changes are observed in the ground state structure, reflected in the spin structure factor and in a reduction of residual entropy at low temperatures. We theoretically uncover a rich phase diagram by varying the anisotropy and demonstrate how this modification reduces the ground state degeneracy across different phases. Numerical simulations reveal that, at sufficiently low temperatures, the system either undergoes a crossover into a constrained spin ice manifold, characterized by an entropy density that drops below the Pauling entropy of conventional spin ice, or a phase transition into a symmetry-broken state, depending on the perturbations. Additionally, we compute the spin structure factors for the anisotropic model and compare these results to analytical predictions from a large-$N$ expansion, finding good agreement. This work develops the understanding of spin ice in anisotropic limits, which may be experimentally realized by strain, providing, among others, key signatures in entropy and specific heat.

Title: Design principles of deep translationally-symmetric neural quantum states for frustrated magnets
Authors: Rajah P. Nutakki, Ahmedeo Shokry, Filippo Vicentini
Abstract: Deep neural network quantum states have emerged as a leading method for studying the ground states of quantum magnets. Successful architectures exploit translational symmetry, but the root of their effectiveness and differences between architectures remain unclear. Here, we apply the ConvNext architecture, designed to incorporate elements of transformers into convolutional networks, to quantum many-body ground states. We find that it is remarkably similar to the factored vision transformer, which has been employed successfully for several frustrated spin systems, allowing us to relate this architecture to more conventional convolutional networks. Through a series of numerical experiments we design the ConvNext to achieve greatest performance at lowest computational cost, then apply this network to the Shastry-Sutherland and J1-J2 models, obtaining variational energies comparable to the state of the art, providing a blueprint for network design choices of translationally-symmetric architectures to tackle challenging ground-state problems in frustrated magnetism.

Title: Kinetic theory of two-dimensional point vortices at order $1/N$ and $1/N^{2}$
Authors: Jean-Baptiste Fouvry, Pierre-Henri Chavanis
Abstract: We investigate the long-term relaxation of a distribution of $N$ point vortices in two-dimensional hydrodynamics. To focus on the regime of weak collective amplification, we embed these point vortices within a static background potential and soften their pairwise interaction on small scales. Placing ourselves within the limit of an average axisymmetric distribution, we stress the connections with generic long-range interacting systems, whose relaxation is described within angle-action coordinates. In particular, we emphasise the existence of two regimes of relaxation, depending on whether the system's profile of mean angular velocity (frequency) is a non-monotonic [resp. monotonic] function of radius, which we refer to as profile (1) [resp. profile (2)]. For profile (1), relaxation occurs through two-body non-local resonant couplings, i.e. $1/N$ effects, as described by the inhomogeneous Landau equation. For profile (2), the impossibility of such two-body resonances submits the system to a ``kinetic blocking''. Relaxation is then driven by three-body couplings, i.e. ${1/N^{2}}$ effects, whose associated kinetic equation has only recently been derived. For both regimes, we compare extensively the kinetic predictions with large ensemble of direct $N$-body simulations. In particular, for profile (1), we explore numerically an effect akin to ``resonance broadening'' close to the extremum of the angular velocity profile. Quantitative description of such subtle nonlinear effects will be the topic of future investigations.

Title: Collective excitations and stability of a non-Fermi liquid state near a quantum-critical point of a metal
Authors: Yasha Gindikin, Dmitrii L. Maslov, Andrey V. Chubukov
Abstract: We examine the spectral properties of collective excitations with finite angular momentum $l$ for a system of interacting fermions near a Pomeranchuk quantum critical point, both in the Fermi liquid and non-Fermi liquid regimes. Previous studies found that deep in the Fermi liquid regime, the spectral functions for even and odd $l$ behave differently - the latter is suppressed compared to the former because of kinematic constraints on scattering processes. The main focus of our paper is to understand how the spectral functions for even and odd $l$ evolve as the system enters the non-Fermi liquid regime. We obtain the full scaling function for the electron polarization bubble at arbitrary $l$, which interpolates between the Fermi liquid and non-Fermi liquid regimes. We show that collective excitations for all $l$ remain stable and causal throughout the crossover and right at the quantum critical point.

Title: Beyond surfaces: quantifying internal radiative heat transport in dense materials
Authors: Janak Tiwari, Tianli Feng
Abstract: While phonons and electrons are well-established heat carriers in solids, photons are typically associated only with radiative transfer between surfaces. Yet for over 70 years, theorists have speculated that thermal photons could also conduct heat within dense, opaque materials -- an idea that has remained unproven and unquantified. Here, we resolve this longstanding question by developing a first-principles framework that reveals and quantifies the internal radiative contribution to thermal conductivity in solids. By analyzing 15 crystalline materials, we uncover photon mean free paths (MFPs) ranging from $\sim$100$\mu$m to over 1cm, with some materials exhibiting surprisingly large radiative thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{\text{rad}}$). Contrary to common assumptions, we show that $\kappa_{\text{rad}}$ can scale steeply with temperature (from $T^{1}$ to $T^{4}$), even as MFPs decrease (from $T^{-0.3}$ to $T^{-3}$). We also discover a robust link between photon MFP and phonon linewidths, revealing an unexpected interplay between radiative and phononic heat transport. Crucially, we establish a general formalism to calculate $\kappa_{\text{rad}}$ across arbitrary sample thicknesses and surface emissivities -- bridging ballistic and diffusive regimes. Our findings overturn long-held assumptions, uncover a missing channel of heat conduction, and provide a powerful new tool for thermal management in extreme environments.

Title: Quasiparticles and optical conductivity in the mixed state of Weyl superconductors with unconventional pairing
Authors: Zhihai Liu, Luyang Wang
Abstract: Previous investigations have revealed that the Weyl superconductor (WeylSC), realized in a superconductor-topological insulator heterostructure, can exhibit the Landau levels (LLs) of Bogoliubov quasiparticles in the presence of a vortex lattice. Here, we investigate the low-energy quasiparticle (QP) excitations in the mixed state of heterostructure WeylSCs with unconventional pairing. We find that the spin-singlet $d$-wave pairing induces flat Dirac-LLs of Bogoliubov QPs, whereas the excitation spectra for the spin-triplet chiral $p$-wave pairing show noticeable dispersion, except for the chiral symmetry-protected, dispersionless, zeroth Landau level (ZLL). Distinct QP excitations in the vortex lattice of WeylSCs result in different optical responses, which are manifested as characteristic magneto-optical conductivity curves. We also show that, compared to the topologically protected, charge-neutral, localized Majorana zero mode (MZM), the chiral symmetry-protected ZLL is non-charge-neutral and delocalized. Both of these zero modes may be observed in the mixed state of a heterostructure topological superconductor.

Title: Spin Pumping into two-dimensional systems
Authors: Yuya Ominato, Masaki Yama, Ai Yamakage, Mamoru Matsuo, Takeo Kato
Abstract: In this review, we present recent theoretical developments on spin transport phenomena probed by ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) modulation in two-dimensional systems coupled to magnetic materials. We first address FMR linewidth enhancements induced by spin pumping at interfaces, emphasizing their potential as sensitive probes of superconducting pairing symmetries in two-dimensional superconductors. We then examine FMR modulation due to spin pumping into two-dimensional electron gases formed in semiconductor heterostructures, where the interplay of Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit interactions enables gate-controlled spin transport and persistent spin textures. Finally, we investigate spin pumping in monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides, where spin-valley coupling and Berry curvature effects lead to valley-selective spin excitations and a spin-current Hall effect. These developments demonstrate that the spin pumping technique provides a versatile tool for probing spin transport and spin-dependent phenomena in low-dimensional systems, offering a basis for future spintronics applications.

Title: Promoted current-induced spin polarization in inversion symmetry broken topological insulator thin films
Authors: Maryam Heydari, Hanieh Moghaddasi, Mir Vahid Hosseini, Mehdi Askari
Abstract: We theoretically investigate current-induced spin polarization in disordered topological insulator thin films with broken inversion symmetry under an applied in-plane electric field. Utilizing the Kubo formalism within the self-consistent Born approximation and incorporating vertex corrections to account for multiple scattering events, we analyze how disorder, chemical potential, the electrostatic potential difference between the top and bottom surfaces, and momentum-dependent hybridization affect the spin susceptibility. Our results reveal that the spin susceptibility exhibits nonzero values within a finite range around a zero gap, and this range broadens as the chemical potential increases. A higher hybridization strength induces asymmetry in the spin response. A stronger potential difference, breaking inversion symmetry, significantly enhances polarization. This enhancement is a trend attributable to band inversion and is further refined by vertex corrections. These findings provide a theoretical framework for tuning spin-charge conversion in topological thin films, with implications for spintronic device applications.

Title: Coherence, Transport, and Chaos in 1D Bose-Hubbard Model: Disorder vs. Stark Potential
Authors: Asad Ali, M.I. Hussain, Saif Al-Kuwari, M. T. Rahim, H. Kuniyil, Seyed Mohammad Hosseiny, Jamileh Seyed-Yazdi, Hamid Arian Zad, Saeed Haddadi
Abstract: Quantum coherence and phase transitions are studied in a finite one-dimensional Bose--Hubbard model using exact diagonalization under thermal fluctuations, a Stark potential, and disorder. The condensate fraction, superfluid fraction, visibility, number fluctuations, and the $\ell_1$-norm of coherence are computed to characterize the Mott insulator--superfluid transition. Although finite-size effects prevent a sharp transition, ground-state properties reveal signatures of quantum criticality. Thermal fluctuations can enhance coherence via tunneling, a Stark potential promotes localization, and disorder suppresses global superfluidity while preserving local coherence. These results highlight how disorder, tilt, and temperature reshape coherence and offer insights for quantum simulation and strongly correlated phases. For systems up to six sites with unit filling, a spectral analysis is also performed through the metric mean gap ratio (MGR). However, limited statistics due to the small system size and computational constraints prevent a complete characterization of quantum chaos, yielding only approximate signatures.

Title: First-Passage-Time Asymmetry for Biased Run-and-Tumble Processes
Authors: Yonathan Sarmiento, Benjamin Walter, Debraj Das, Samvit Mahapatra, Édgar Roldán, Rosemary J. Harris
Abstract: We explore first-passage phenomenology for biased active processes with a renewal-type structure, focusing in particular on paradigmatic run-and-tumble models in both discrete and continuous state spaces. In general, we show there is no equality between distributions of conditional first-passage times to symmetric barriers positioned in and against the bias direction. However, we give conditions for such a duality to be restored asymptotically (in the limit of a large barrier distance) and highlight connections to the Gallavotti-Cohen fluctuation relation and the method of images. Our general trajectory arguments of first-passage-time distributions for asymmetric run-and-tumble processes to escape from an interval of arbitrary width are supported by exact analytical results, which we derive extending Montroll's defect technique. Furthermore, we quantify the degree of violation of first-passage duality using Kullback-Leibler divergence and signal-to-noise ratios associated with the first-passage times to the two barriers. We reveal an intriguing dependence of such measures of first-passage asymmetry on the underlying often hidden tumbling dynamics which may inspire inference techniques based on first-passage-time statistics in active systems.

Title: Phonon dephasing times determined with time-delayed, broadband CARS
Authors: Franz Hempel, Michael Rüsing, Federico Vernuccio, Kai J. Spychala, Robin Buschbeck, Giulio Cerullo, Dario Polli, Lukas M. Eng
Abstract: Coherent Raman scattering techniques as coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS), offer significant advantages in terms of pixel dwell times and speed as compared to spontaneous Raman scattering for investigations of crystalline materials. However, the spectral information in CARS is often hampered by the presence of a non-resonant contribution to the scattering process that shifts and distorts the Raman peaks. In this work, we apply a method to obtain non-resonant background-free spectra based on time-delayed, broadband CARS (TD-BCARS) using an intra-pulse excitation scheme. In particular, this method can measure the phononic dephasing times across the full phonon spectrum at once. We test the methodology on amorphous SiO2 (glass), which is used to characterize the setup-specific and material-independent response times, and then apply TD-BCARS to the analysis of single crystals of diamond and ferroelectrics of potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) and potassium titanyl arsenate (KTA). For diamond, we determine a dephasing time of t = 7.81 ps for the single sp3 peak.

Title: Thermodynamic Cost of Random-Time Protocols
Authors: Izaak Neri
Abstract: Systems that are driven by a randomly timed, external protocol can seemingly violate the second law of thermodynamics. We show that this thermodynamic paradox is resolved if the outcome of the random time is stored in a memory device. Specifically, we show that the average work required to erase the memory is always larger than the average work gained from the protocol. We also discuss concrete setups that measure random times directly without continuous monitoring. Taken together, this paper discusses the relationship between temporal information and thermodynamics. This framework is relevant for external protocols employing random times, such as, stochastic resetting protocols and cyclically driven heat engines that use randomly timed protocols.

Title: A common origin of photoplastic and electroplastic effects in ZnS
Authors: Alexandra Fonseca Montenegro, Sevim Genlik Polat, Md Mohsinur Rahman Adnan, Maryam Ghazisaeidi, Roberto C. Myers
Abstract: Dislocation motion--the atomic-scale mechanism of crystal plasticity--governs the strength and ductility of materials. In functional materials, external stimuli beyond mechanical stress can also affect dislocation glide. In the wide band gap semiconductor ZnS, optical illumination suppresses plasticity, whereas electric fields can enhance dislocation motion. Here, we show that the common underlying mechanism for these phenomena is the charged dislocations that respond to the changes in carrier concentration. Our prior theoretical work showed that locally charged dislocations in ZnS trap excess carriers, triggering core reconstructions that modify their mobility, with the positively charged Zn-rich core dislocations showing the most drastic change. Here, we validate this prediction experimentally by showing that either optical excitation or electronic doping selectively inhibits the glide of Zn-rich dislocations in epitaxially grown ZnS. First, imaging individual interface misfit dislocations under different optical excitation conditions shows that Zn-core glide is strongly reduced as optical power is increased, while the S-core dislocations show negligible sensitivity to light, marking the first, single misfit dislocation imaging of the photoplastic effect. Next, we show that a similar behavior is observed with direct electron (n-type) doping of ZnS epitaxial layers grown beyond the critical thickness. As the n-type dopant density is increased, the resulting Zn-core dislocation density is reduced by more than one order of magnitude, while the S-core density remains essentially unchanged, causing a sign reversal of the strain-anisotropy with n-type doping. These results demonstrate a common origin for the opto-electronic sensitivity of dislocations in ZnS and provide a pathway for the engineering of dislocation content in compound semiconductors.

Title: Theory of bound magnetic polarons in cubic and uniaxial antiferromagnets
Authors: Dawid Bugajewski, Carmine Autieri, Tomasz Dietl
Abstract: Motivated by a recent debate about the origin of remanent magnetization and the corresponding anomalous Hall effect in antiferromagnets and altermagnets, a theory of bound magnetic polarons (BMPs) in anisotropic antiferromagnetic semiconductors is developed. The theory describes quantitatively the experimentally observed magnitude of excess magnetization and its dependence on the magnetic field in cubic antiferromagnetic EuTe. In contrast to the cubic case, our theory predicts the presence of magnetization hysteresis below Néel temperature in antiferromagnets with uniaxial anisotropy. We show, employing material parameters implied by experimental and ab initio results, that the magnitudes of remanent magnetization and the coercive field are in accord with recent experimental observations for altermagnetic hexagonal MnTe. While the altermagnets have an intrinsic contribution to the remanent magnetization and the anomalous Hall effect, our theory explains the origin of an extrinsic contribution. Our findings address, therefore, a question about the relative contribution to the remanent magnetization of bound magnetic polarons and weak ferromagnetism driven by the antisymmetric exchange interaction, the latter weakened by the formation of antiferromagnetic domains. Furthermore, we provide the theory of BMP spontaneous spin splitting, which can be probed optically.

Title: Self-consistent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov approach for bosons: self-eliminating divergence and pure pair condensate
Authors: M. Bulakhov, A. S. Peletminskii
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic properties of an interacting Bose gas with a condensate within the energy-functional formulation of the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) approach. For a contact interaction, we derive a self-consistent solution to the HFB equations that intrinsically eliminates divergence. This solution characterizes the equilibrium state featuring a condensate of correlated pairs of particles. We analyze the temperature dependence of key thermodynamic quantities such as condensate density, chemical potential, entropy, pressure, specific heat capacity at constant volume, and isothermal compressibility and compare them with predictions from the Popov approximation (PA). We predict that the transition temperature shifts to higher values due interactions, with the HFB approach yielding a larger shift than the PA. Analysis of the compressibility indicates that a pure pair condensate is unstable, and the stable equilibrium corresponds to only a mixture of single-particle and pair condensates.

Title: Flexoelectric Polarization Enhancement in Paraelectric $\mathrm{BaHfO_3}$ via Strain Gradient Engineering
Authors: Timo Piecuch, Nina Daneu, Jeffrey A. Brock, Xiaochun Huang, Tina Radoševič, Arnold M. Müller, Christof Vockenhuber, Christof W. Schneider, Thomas Lippert, Nick A. Shepelin
Abstract: Flexoelectricity - polarization induced by strain gradients - offers a route to polar functionality in centrosymmetric dielectrics, where traditional piezoelectric effects are absent. This study investigates the flexoelectric effect in epitaxial $\mathrm{BaHfO_3}$ (BHO) thin films, a centrosymmetric and paraelectric perovskite. While a large lattice mismatch induces defect-driven relaxation, a coherently grown BHO film undergoes elastic relaxation, forming intrinsic strain gradients exceeding $10^5\ \mathrm{m}^{-1}$. A 29-fold enhancement in spontaneous polarization is observed at an electric field of $4\ \mathrm{MV\,cm}^{-1}$ for BHO exhibiting a strain gradient compared to relaxed BHO. This enhancement is attributed to flexoelectric coupling, which is isolated from ferroelectric and piezoelectric contributions due to the centrosymmetric nature and the absence of phase transitions in BHO. The findings establish a clear link between engineered strain gradients and enhanced polarizability in oxide thin films, offering a benchmark system for deconvoluting the flexoelectric effect from other polar effects. These results provide a basis for exploiting flexoelectricity in dielectric devices and advance the fundamental understanding of strain-coupled phenomena in functional oxides.

Title: Phase-modulated superconductivity via altermagnetism
Authors: Shuntaro Sumita, Makoto Naka, Hitoshi Seo
Abstract: Stimulated by recent interest in altermagnets, a novel class of antiferromagnets with macroscopic time-reversal symmetry breaking, we investigate the coexistence of altermagnetism and superconductivity. By developing a Ginzburg--Landau theory based on microscopic models, we show that a phase-modulated Fulde--Ferrell superconducting state is stabilized via altermagnetic spin splitting, in contrast to the typical amplitude-modulated states that occur under the uniform Zeeman field. We apply our framework to different models to compare the resulting phase diagrams: a two-sublattice model with altermagnetic order, a continuum model with an anisotropic Zeeman field mimicking altermagnetic spin splitting, and a conventional square-lattice model with two kinds of anisotropic Zeeman fields. We show that the multisublattice structure is crucial for realizing the phase-modulated superconductivity, and highlight spin-split altermagnets as a promising platform for exploring this exotic superconductivity without external magnetic fields.

Title: First-Principles Nanocapacitor Simulations of the Optical Dielectric Constant in Water Ice
Authors: Anthony Mannino, Graciele M. Arvelos, Kedarsh Kaushik, Emilio Artacho, Pablo Ordejon, Alexandre R. Rocha, Luana S. Pedroza, Marivi Fernández-Serra
Abstract: We introduce a combined density functional theory (DFT) and non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) framework to compute the capacitance of nanocapacitors and directly extract the dielectric response of a sub-nanometer dielectric under bias. We identify that at the nanoscale conventional capacitance evaluations based on stored charge per unit voltage suffer from an ill-posed partitioning of electrode and dielectric charge. This partitioning directly impacts the geometric definition of capacitance through the capacitor width, which in turn makes the evaluation of dielectric response uncertain. This ambiguous separation further induces spurious interfacial polarizability when analyzed via maximally localized Wannier functions. Focusing on crystalline ice, we develop a robust charge-separation protocol that yields unique capacitance-derived polarizability and dielectric constants, unequivocally demonstrating that confinement neither alters ice's intrinsic electronic response nor its insensitivity to proton order. Our results lay the groundwork for rigorous interpretation of capacitor measurements in low-dimensional dielectric materials.

Title: Analytic Phase Solution and Point Vortex Model for Dipolar Quantum Vortices
Authors: Ryan Doran, Thomas Bland
Abstract: We derive an analytic expression for the phase of a quantum vortex in a dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate, capturing anisotropic effects from long-range dipole-dipole interactions. This solution provides a foundation for a dipolar point vortex model (DPVM), incorporating both phase-driven flow and dipolar forces. The DPVM reproduces key features of vortex pair dynamics seen in full simulations, including anisotropic velocities, deformed orbits, and directional motion, offering a minimal and accurate model for dipolar vortex dynamics. Our results open the door to analytic studies of vortices in dipolar quantum matter and establish a new platform for exploring vortex dynamics and turbulence in these systems.

Title: Numerical and data-driven modeling of spall failure in polycrystalline ductile materials
Authors: Indrashish Saha, Lori Graham-Brady
Abstract: Developing materials with tailored mechanical performance requires iteration over a large number of proposed designs. When considering dynamic fracture, experiments at every iteration are usually infeasible. While high-fidelity, physics-based simulations can potentially reduce experimental efforts, they remain computationally expensive. As a faster alternative, key dynamic properties can be predicted directly from microstructural images using deep-learning surrogate models. In this work, the spallation of ductile polycrystals under plate-impact loading at strain rates of O(10^6 s^-1) is considered. A physics-based numerical model that couples crystal plasticity and a cohesive zone model is used to generate data for the surrogate models. Three architectures - 3D U-Net, 3D Fourier Neural Operator (FNO-3D), and U-FNO were trained on the particle-velocity field data from the numerical model. The generalization of the models was evaluated using microstructures with varying grain sizes and aspect ratios. U-FNO and 3D U-Net performed significantly better than FNO-3D across all datasets. Furthermore, U-FNO and 3D U-Net exhibited comparable accuracy for every metric considered in this study. However, training the U-FNO requires almost twice the computational effort compared to the 3D U-Net, making it a desirable option for a surrogate model.

Title: Kappa distributions in the framework of superstatistics
Authors: Sergio Davis, Biswajit Bora, Cristian Pavez, Leopoldo Soto
Abstract: The kappa distribution of velocities appears routinely in the study of collisionless plasmas present in Earth's magnetosphere, the solar wind among other contexts where particles are unable to reach thermal equilibrium. Originally justified through the use of Tsallis' non-extensive statistics, nowadays there are alternative frameworks that provide insight into these distributions, such as superstatistics. In this work we review the derivation of the multi-particle and single-particle kappa distributions for collisionless plasmas within the framework of superstatistics, as an alternative to the use of non-extensive statistics. We also show the utility of the superstatistical framework in the computation of expectation values under kappa distributions. Some consequences of the superstatistical formalism regarding correlations, temperature and entropy of kappa-distributed plasmas are also discussed.

Title: Characterization of fractional Chern insulator quasiparticles in twisted homobilayer MoTe$_2$
Authors: Zhao Liu, Bohao Li, Yuhao Shi, Fengcheng Wu
Abstract: We provide a detailed study of Abelian quasiparticles of valley polarized fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) residing in the top valence band of twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ (tMoTe$_2$) at hole filling $\nu_h=2/3$. We construct a tight-binding model of delocalized quasiparticles to capture the energy dispersion of a single quasiparticle. We then localize quasiparticles by short-range delta impurity potentials. Unlike the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) counterpart in the lowest Landau level (LLL), the density profile around the localized FCI quasiparticle in tMoTe$_2$ depends on the location of the impurity potential and loses the continuous rotation invariance. The FCI quasiparticle localized at moiré lattice center closely follows the anyon Wannier state of the tight-binding model of the mobile quasiparticle. Despite of the difference in density profiles, we find that the excess charge around the impurity potential for the $\nu_h=2/3$ FCIs in tMoTe$_2$ is still similar to that of the $\nu=2/3$ FQH state in the LLL if an effective magnetic length on the moiré lattice is chosen as the length unit, which allows a rough estimation of the spatial extent of the FCI quasiparticle. Far away from the impurity potential, this excess charge has the tendency to reach $e/3$, as expected for the Laughlin quasiparticle. The braiding phase of two FCI quasiparticles in tMoTe$_2$ also agrees with the theoretical prediction of fractional statistics. We characterize the interaction between two FCI quasiparticles and find a crossover from repulsive to attractive interaction as gate-to-sample distances decreases. Based on the nearly ideal quantum geometry of the top valence band of tMoTe$_2$, we propose a trial wave function for localized FCI quasiparticles, which reproduces the key feature of the density profile around a quasiparticle.

Title: Fractional Thouless pumping of solitons: a unique manifestation of bulk-edge correspondence of nonlinear eigenvalue problems
Authors: Chenxi Bai, Zhaoxin Liang
Abstract: Recent foundational studies have established the bulk-edge correspondence for nonlinear eigenvalue problems using auxiliary eigenvalues $\hat{H}\Psi=\omega S(\omega)\Psi$, spanning both linear [T. Isobe et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 126601 (2024)] and nonlinear [Chenxi Bai and Zhaoxin Liang, Phys. Rev. A. 111, 042201 (2025)] Hamiltionians. This progress prompts a fundamental question: Can eigenvalue nonlinearity generate observable physical phenomena absent in conventional approaches ($\hat{H}\Psi=E\Psi$)? In this work, we address this question by demonstrating the first uniquely nonlinear manifestation of the bulk-edge correspondence: fractional Thouless pumping of solitons. Through systematic investigation of nonlinear Thouless pumping in an extended Rice-Mele model incorporating next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) couplings, we uncover that NNN interaction parameters can induce fractional topological phases|even in the presence of quantized topological invariants as predicted by conventional linear approaches. Crucially, these fractional phases are naturally explained within the auxiliary eigenvalue framework, directly linking nonlinear spectral characteristics to the bulk-boundary correspondence. Our findings reveal novel emergent phenomena arising from the interplay between nonlinearity and NNN couplings, providing key insights for the design of topological insulators and the controlled manipulation of quantum edge states in nonlinear regimes.

Title: Quantum geometric bounds for observables: Linear responses, Drude weight, and orbital magnetization
Authors: Koki Shinada, Naoto Nagaosa
Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor (QGT) provides nontrivial bounds among physical quantities, as exemplified by the metric-curvature inequality. In this paper, we investigate various bounds for different observables through certain generalizations of the QGT. First, we demonstrate that bounds hold for all linear responses, which are produced by a QGT extended to many-body states, finite temperature, and general parameter space. As an application, we show the thermodynamic inequality originating from the convexity of free energy can be further tightened. Second, we establish a bound between the Drude weight and the orbital magnetization. The equality is exactly satisfied in the Landau level system, and systems with nearly flat bands tend to approach equality as well. We apply the resulting inequality to two orbital ferromagnets and support that the twisted bilayer graphene system is close to the Landau level system. Moreover, we show that an analogous inequality also holds for a higher-order multipole, magnetic quadrupole. Finally, we discuss the analogy between the QGT and the uncertainty principle, emphasizing that the existence of nontrivial bounds necessarily reflects quantum effects.

Title: Temperature Dependent Mechanical and Structural Properties of Uniaxially Strained Planar Graphene
Authors: Sané Erasmus, Charalampos Skokos, George Kalosakas
Abstract: Using molecular dynamics simulations in a planar graphene sheet, we investigate the temperature dependence of its mechanical behavior under uniaxial tensile stress applied either along the armchair or the zigzag direction. Stress-strain curves are calculated for different temperatures and the corresponding dependence of various elastic parameters, is discussed. Fracture stress and strain, as well as the Young modulus, decrease almost linearly with temperature, in accordance with previous investigations. An almost linear variation of the third-order elastic modulus with temperature is demonstrated, revealing opposite trends for uniaxial loadings along the armchair or the zigzag direction. The detailed dependence of the distributions of bond lengths and bond angles both on strain and temperature is presented for the first time, along with approximate analytical expressions. The latter describe accurately the numerically obtained distributions.

Title: General Two-Parameter Model of Alpha-Relaxation in Glasses
Authors: Valeriy V. Ginzburg, Oleg Gendelman, Riccardo Casalini, Alessio Zaccone
Abstract: In the vicinity of the glass transition, the characteristic relaxation time (e.g., the alpha-relaxation time in dielectric spectroscopy) of a glass-former exhibits a strongly super-Arrhenius temperature dependence, as compared to the classical Arrhenius behavior at high temperatures. A comprehensive description of both regions thus requires five parameters. Here, we demonstrate that many glass-formers exhibit a universal scaling, with only two material-specific parameters setting the timescale and the temperature scale; the other three being universal constants. Furthermore, we show that the master curve can be described by the recently developed two-state, two-(time) scale (TS2) theory (Soft Matter 2020, 16, 810) and regress the universal TS2 parameters. We also show the connection between the TS2 model and the Hall-Wolynes elastic relaxation theory.

Title: Nature of field-induced transitions and hysteretic magnetoresistance in non-collinear antiferromagnet EuIn2As2
Authors: Karan Singh, Jan Skolimowski, Giuseppe Cuono, Raghottam M. Sattigeri, Andrzej Ptok, Orest Pavlosiuk, Tetiana Romanova, Tomasz Tolinski, Piotr Wisniewski, Carmine Autieri, Dariusz Kaczorowski
Abstract: We examine the magnetic and electrical transport properties of the hexagonal EuIn2As2 compound, combining experimental and theoretical results. This compound is predicted to be an axion-insulator from an electronic point of view and an altermagnet while in the collinear magnetic phase. However, experiments indicate that the Fermi level lies within the valence band rather than in the topological gap, potentially leading to the dominance of magnetic properties. Our detailed studies on magnetization and electrical transport support the presence of a broken-helix antiferromagnetic state, which was previously identified by X-ray and neutron diffraction experiments. Notably, we observed within that state a field-induced metamagnetic transition marked by a large hysteresis in magnetoresistance, which turns into a sharp upturn for the magnetic field tilted by 15 degree from the c-axis of the crystal. Combined with theoretical calculations, it is explained that the application of a magnetic field changes the low-resistivity antiferromagnetic domain walls to the high-resistivity domain walls due to the reduction in the Fermi surface sheets interaction area in the domain walls, originating from p-orbitals of As. EuIn2As2, therefore, presents a new case study that broadens the understanding of complex magnetic structures and their influence on electrical transport.

Title: Machine Learning Prediction of Magnetic Proximity Effect in van der Waals Heterostructures: From Atoms to Moiré
Authors: Lukas Cvitkovich, Klaus Zollner, Jaroslav Fabian
Abstract: We introduce a machine learning framework that efficiently predicts large-scale proximity-induced magnetism in van der Waals heterostructures, overcoming the high computational cost of density functional theory (DFT). We apply it to graphene/\CGT, which exhibits a previously unrecognized dichotomy. Unlike the spin polarization at the Fermi level, which follows the pseudospin, the proximity-induced magnetic moments vary across carbon atoms, defying analytical modeling. To address this, we develop an ensemble-based regression model trained on DFT data and employ local environment descriptors to map the local ($\sim 2$\,nm$^2$) atomic-scale geometry to the carbon magnetic moments. Besides demonstrating locality, the model reveals rich magnetic moiré textures. Crucially, this method can be broadly applied to orbital and spin proximity effects that are highly sensitive to local atomic environments and are beyond analytical description.

Title: Theoretical Investigation of Performance-Improved Ferroelectric Tunnel Junction Based on Trap-Assisted Tunneling
Authors: Shi-Xi Kong, Tuo-Hung Hou
Abstract: CMOS-compatible HfO2-based ferroelectric tunnel junction (FTJ) has attracted significant attention as a promising candidate for in-memory computing (IMC) due to its extremely low power consumption. However, conventional FTJs face inherent challenges and hinder their practical applications. Insufficient current density and limited on-off current ratios in FTJs are primarily constrained by their dependence on direct and Fowler-Nordheim tunneling mechanisms. Building on previous experimental results, this paper proposes a trap-assisted tunneling (TAT)-based FTJ that leverages the TAT mechanism to overcome these limitations. A comprehensive FTJ model integrating ferroelectric switching, direct, Fowler-Nordheim tunneling, and TAT mechanisms is developed, enabling detailed analyses of the trap conditions and their impact on performance. Through systematic optimization of trap parameters and device structure, the simulated TAT-based FTJ achieves ultra-high current density and a remarkable on-off current ratio, meeting the nanoscale IMC requirements. The results highlight the potential of TAT-based FTJs as high-performance memory solutions for IMC applications.

Title: Superpotentials, flat bands and the role of Quantum Geometry for the superfluid stiffness
Authors: T. Bauch, F. Lombardi, G. Seibold
Abstract: Enhancing superconductivity through material design is a central goal in quantum materials research. Moire engineering, where twisting stacked layers creates long-wavelength modulations and flat bands, has shown how electronic correlations can be amplified and eventually used to raise the superconducting critical temperature Tc. Yet this approach is largely confined to van der Waals materials and offers limited tunability. Here we explore a moire-inspired alternative: imposing artificial superpotentials on otherwise homogeneous systems to engineer flat electronic minibands. Whether such superlattice potentials can truly enhance superconductivity and sustain a finite superfluid stiffness remains, however, an open question. Our calculations show that a periodic superpotential imposed to a 2D system can indeed enhance superconductivity by reconstructing the electronic bands and creating regions of large density of states, leading to a substantial increase of Tc. In contrast to conventional flat band systems, where the superfluid stiffness arises solely from quantum geometry through the quantum metric, a modulated system inherits kinetic energy from the filled minibands below the Fermi level. This inherited component coexists with a positive quantum geometric contribution, yielding a finite and robust stiffness even when the upper band becomes nearly flat. The resulting superconducting state remains coherent and resilient against weak to moderate disorder. Our findings demonstrate that engineered superpotentials offer a tunable route to enhance superconductivity beyond twist based moire systems, unifying flat band amplification of pairing with preserved phase stiffness. They further highlight the central role of quantum geometry in shaping collective electronic phenomena and point to superlattice design as a promising platform for next-generation superconductors.

Title: Möbius-topological auxiliary function for $f$ electrons
Authors: Biaoyan Hu
Abstract: $f$-electron systems exhibit a subtle interplay between strong spin--orbit coupling and crystal-field effects, producing complex energy landscapes that are computationally demanding. We introduce auxiliary functions, constructed by extending hydrogen-like wave functions through a modification of the Legendre function. These functions often possess a Möbius-like topology, satisfying $\psi(\varphi) = -\psi(\varphi + 2\pi)$, while their squared modulus respects inversion symmetry. By aligning $|\psi|^2$ with the symmetry of the crystal field, they allow rapid determination of eigenstate structures without the need for elaborate calculations. The agreement with established results indicates that these functions capture the essential physics while offering considerable computational simplification.

Title: Short-time blowup statistics of a Brownian particle in repulsive potentials
Authors: Baruch Meerson
Abstract: We study the dynamics of an overdamped Brownian particle in a repulsive scale-invariant potential $V(x) \sim -x^{n+1}$. For $n > 1$, a particle starting at position $x$ reaches infinity in a finite, randomly distributed time. We focus on the short-time tail $T \to 0$ of the probability distribution $P(T, x, n)$ of the blowup time $T$ for integer $n > 1$. Krapivsky and Meerson [Phys. Rev. E \textbf{112}, 024128 (2025)] recently evaluated the leading-order asymptotics of this tail, which exhibits an $n$-dependent essential singularity at $T = 0$. Here we provide a more accurate description of the $T \to 0$ tail by calculating, for all $n = 2, 3, \dots$, the previously unknown large pre-exponential factor of the blowup-time probability distribution. To this end, we apply a WKB approximation -- at both leading and subleading orders -- to the Laplace-transformed backward Fokker--Planck equation governing $P(T, x, n)$. For even $n$, the WKB solution alone suffices. For odd $n$, however, the WKB solution breaks down in a narrow boundary layer around $x = 0$. In this case, it must be supplemented by an ``internal'' solution and a matching procedure between the two solutions in their common region of validity.

Title: Dual Cross-Linked Hydrogels: Linear Rheology and Fractional Calculus Modeling
Authors: Agniva Dutta, Valeriy V. Ginzburg, Gleb Vasilyev, Eyal Zussman
Abstract: Hydrogels are increasingly recognized as a versatile platform for applications spanning from tissue engineering to soft robotics or flexible electronics. Recent efforts have focused on enhancing and tailoring their mechanical performance to meet application-specific demands. However, the intricate viscoelastic response of hydrogels remains challenging to capture using conventional phenomenological models. In this study, we prepared a series of tough dual crosslinked hydrogels -- poly(methacrylamide-co-acrylic acid)-Fe3+ and systematically tuned their mechanical properties by leveraging the salting-out effect. The viscoelastic behavior of the hydrogels was characterized under shear deformations, and a four-parameter Fractional Maxwell Model (FMM) was constructed to quantitatively describe oscillatory shear, creep, and stress relaxation responses. The influence of salt concentration on each FMM parameter was analyzed and correlated with bulk mechanical performance. This framework provides a first step toward capturing the complex viscoelastic nature of the advanced hydrogels and lays the foundation for developing more comprehensive nonlinear constitutive models.

Title: Physically Interpretable Descriptors Drive the Materials Design of Metal Hydrides for Hydrogen Storage
Authors: Seong-Hoon Jang, Di Zhang, Hung Ba Tran, Xue Jia, Kiyoe Konno, Ryuhei Sato, Shin-ichi Orimo, Hao Li
Abstract: Designing metal hydrides for hydrogen storage remains a longstanding challenge due to the vast compositional space and complex structure-property relationships. Herein, for the first time, we present physically interpretable models for predicting two key performance metrics, gravimetric hydrogen density $w$ and equilibrium pressure $P_{\rm eq,RT}$ at room temperature, based on a minimal set of chemically meaningful descriptors. Using a rigorously curated dataset of $5,089$ metal hydride compositions from our recently developed Digital Hydrogen Platform (\it{DigHyd}) based on large-scale data mining from available experimental literature of solid-state hydrogen storage materials, we systematically constructed over $1.6$ million candidate models using combinations of scalar transformations and nonlinear link functions. The final closed-form models, derived from $2$-$3$ descriptors each, achieve predictive accuracies on par with state-of-the-art machine learning methods, while maintaining full physical transparency. Strikingly, descriptor-based design maps generated from these models reveal a fundamental trade-off between $w$ and $P_{\rm eq,RT}$: saline-type hydrides, composed of light electropositive elements, offer high $w$ but low $P_{\rm eq,RT}$, whereas interstitial-type hydrides based on heavier electronegative transition metals show the opposite trend. Notably, Be-based systems, such as Be-Na alloys, emerge as rare candidates that simultaneously satisfy both performance metrics, attributed to the unique combination of light mass and high molar density for Be. Our models indicate that Be-based systems may offer renewed prospects for approaching these benchmarks. These results provide chemically intuitive guidelines for materials design and establish a scalable framework for the rational discovery of materials in complex chemical spaces.

Title: Interaction-driven quantum criticality in two-dimensional quadratic band crossing semimetals with time-reversal symmetry breaking
Authors: Yi-Kun Fang, Jing Wang
Abstract: We present a systematic investigation of all sixteen marginally relevant fermion-fermion interactions in two-dimensional time-reversal symmetry-breaking kagomé semimetals hosting a quadratic band crossing point. Employing a momentum-shell renormalization group approach that treats every interaction on equal footing, we derive energy-dependent flow equations that capture the hierarchical evolutions of interaction parameters. Our analysis begins by tracking the energy-dependent flows of fermion-fermion interactions. The interaction couplings go towards divergence at a critical energy scale, signaling quantum critical behavior. Such behavior is characterized by a certain fixed point (FP) whose characteristics depends intimately on structural parameters $d_{0,1,2,3}$ that cluster the microscopic model into rotationally symmetric and asymmetric cases. Then, we identify two stable FPs in the rotationally symmetric and nine additional FPs in asymmetric case dubbed FP$_{1-10}$. Their boundary conditions are approximately demarcated and established by linear and plane fitting techniques in the structural parameter space. Furthermore, we examine distinct interaction-driven instabilities nearby these FPs by incorporating the relevant external source terms and computing their susceptibilities. It indicates that the charge density wave and superconductivity become dominant at FP$_{2,4,5,6,8}$ and FP$_{1,9,10}$, while the $x$-current and bond density prevail at FP$_3$ and FP$_7$, respectively. In addition to these leading states, several underlying subordinate instabilities are presented as well. These results would be helpful to further study the low-energy critical behavior in 2D kagomé QBCP and related materials.

Title: Algorithmic differentiation for plane-wave DFT: materials design, error control and learning model parameters
Authors: Niklas Frederik Schmitz, Bruno Ploumhans, Michael F. Herbst
Abstract: We present a differentiation framework for plane-wave density-functional theory (DFT) that combines the strengths of forward-mode algorithmic differentiation (AD) and density-functional perturbation theory (DFPT). In the resulting AD-DFPT framework derivatives of any DFT output quantity with respect to any input parameter (e.g. geometry, density functional or pseudopotential) can be computed accurately without deriving gradient expressions by hand. We implement AD-DFPT into the Density-Functional ToolKit (DFTK) and show its broad applicability. Amongst others we consider the inverse design of a semiconductor band gap, the learning of exchange-correlation functional parameters, or the propagation of DFT parameter uncertainties to relaxed structures. These examples demonstrate a number of promising research avenues opened by gradient-driven workflows in first-principles materials modeling.

Authors: A. L. Chernyshev
Abstract: We demonstrate the versatility, simplicity, and power of the minimally-augmented spin-wave theory in studying phase diagrams of the quantum spin models in which unexpected magnetically ordered phases occur or the existing ones expand beyond their classical stability regions. We use this method to obtain approximate phase diagrams of the two paradigmatic spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ models on the honeycomb lattice: the $J_1$-$J_3$ ferro-antiferromagnetic and $J_1$-$J_2$ antiferromagnetic $XXZ$ models. For the $J_1$-$J_3$ case, various combinations of the $XXZ$ anisotropies are analyzed. In a dramatic deviation from their classical phase diagrams, which host significant regions of the noncollinear spiral phases, quantum fluctuations stabilize several unconventional collinear phases and significantly extend conventional ones to completely supersede spiral states. These results are in close agreement with the available density-matrix renormalization group calculations. The applicability of this approach to the other models and its potential extension to different types of orders are discussed.

Title: High-resolution valence band RIXS at the actinide M$_{4,5}$-edges
Authors: Martin Sundermann, Henrik Hahn, Denise S. Christovam, Maurits W. Haverkort, Roberto Caciuffo, Bernhard Keimer, Liu Hao Tjeng, Andrea Severing, Hlynur Gretarsson
Abstract: Understanding the electronic structure of actinide materials is crucial for both fundamental research and nuclear applications. The partially filled 5f shells exhibit complex behavior due to strong correlations and ligand hybridization, requiring advanced spectroscopic techniques. Here, we report on the development and application of high-resolution valence-band resonant inelastic x-ray spectroscopy (VB-RIXS) experiments at the uranium M$_{4,5}$ edges (3551 and 3725\,eV). We present data of UO$_2$, a well-established model actinide compound. VB-RIXS is particularly well suited for probing the 5f-shell electronic structure, as it probes, in contrast to core-to-core RIXS, excitations without leaving a high-energy core hole in the final state. In VB-RIXS, we achieve energy resolutions of 50\,meV (M$_5$) and 90\,meV (M$_4$), enabling the resolution of multiplet excitations and crystal-field effects, as well as charge-transfer and fluorescence-like features with unprecedented clarity. As such, high resolution VB-RIXS offers direct insights into both low-energy, near ground-state properties and high-energy hybridization and covalency effects. Our results demonstrate the power of VB-RIXS as a versatile and powerful tool for probing the strongly correlated electronic structure of actinide materials, providing essential input for quantitative modeling and the validation of theoretical concepts.

Title: Machine Learning Based Optical Thermometry Using Photoluminescence and Raman Spectra of Diamonds Containing SiV Centers
Authors: Md Shakhawath Hossain, Dylan G. Stone, G. Landry, Xiaoxue Xu, Carlo Bradac, Toan Trong Tran
Abstract: Micro- and nanothermometry enable precise temperature monitoring and control at the micro- and nanoscale, and have become essential diagnostic tools in applications ranging from high-power microelectronics to biosensing and nanomedicine. Most existing techniques rely on secondary micro- and nanothermometers that require individual calibration of each sensor, ideally both off- and in-situ, before use. We present an alternative approach that overcomes this limitation by employing fluorescent diamonds containing silicon-vacancy centers, where the thermo-sensitive physical quantities are the centers' photoluminescence and the diamond host's Raman signals. The photoluminescence and Raman data are analyzed using two multi-feature regression algorithms that leverage a minimal number of calibration diamonds and temperature set points to predict the temperature of previously unseen diamonds. Using this approach, the models achieve accuracies as low as 0.7 K, resolutions down to 0.6 K Hz$^{-1/2}$, and sensitivity as high as 0.04 K$^{-1}$. These correspond to improvements of roughly 70 percent (over threefold) in accuracy, 50 percent (twofold) in resolution, and 567 percent (sevenfold) in sensitivity compared with traditional single-feature models. Our approach is particularly suited to applications where pre-deployment calibration of every thermosensor is impractical, and it is generalizable to any thermometry platform with two or more simultaneously measurable temperature-dependent observables.

Title: Time-reversal positivity
Authors: Zhong-Chao Wei
Abstract: We propose a new analytical tool called time-reversal positivity. It is an analogue of the Majorana reflection positivity in time-reversal symmetric case. This new time-reversal positivity can fully explain the relationship between time-reversal symmetry and the sign-free property in quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Using a cone-theoretical method, we show the ground state uniqueness for the time-reversal symmetric non-hermitian Hubbard model.

Title: Topological surface magnon-polariton in an insulating canted antiferromagnet
Authors: Weixin Li, Rundong Yuan, Fenglin Zhong, Bo Peng, Jean-Philippe Ansermet, Haiming Yu
Abstract: Excitation and control of antiferromagnetic magnon modes lie at the heart of coherent antiferromagnetic spintronics. Here, we propose a topological surface magnon-polariton as a new approach in the prototypical magnonic material hematite. We show that in an insulating canted antiferromagnet, where strong-coupled magnon-photon modes can be achieved using electrical on-chip layouts, a surface magnon-polariton mode exists in the gap of the bulk magnon-photon bands. The emergence of surface magnon-polariton mode is further attributed to the nontrivial topology of bulk magnon-photon bands. Magnon-photon coupling enhances the Berry curvature near the anticrossing points, leading to a topological bulk Chern band associated with the surface magnon-polaritons. Our work provides a general principle for the utilization of optomagnetic properties in antiferromagnets, with an illustration of its experimental feasibility and wide generality as manifested in hematite.

Title: Quantifying Charge Noise Sources in Quantum Dot Spin Qubits via Impedance Spectroscopy, DLTS, and C-V Analysis
Authors: Tyafur Rahman Pathan, Daryoosh Vashaee
Abstract: The coherence and fidelity of quantum dot (QD) spin qubits are fundamentally limited by charge noise arising from electrically active trap states at oxide interfaces, heterostructure boundaries, and within the bulk semiconductor. These traps introduce electrostatic fluctuations that couple to the qubit via spin-orbit interactions or charge-sensitive confinement potentials, leading to dephasing and gate errors. In this work, we present a general trap characterization framework for identifying and quantifying the spectral signatures of these trap states using AC impedance spectroscopy, deep-level transient spectroscopy (DLTS), and conventional capacitance-voltage (C-V) analysis. While our case study focuses on strained Ge/SiGe quantum well heterostructures, the approach is broadly applicable to other material systems and qubit types. We demonstrate that each class of traps (oxide interface, quantum well interface, and bulk) exhibits distinct fingerprints across frequency- and time-domain measurements. Oxide traps dominate the low-frequency conductance peaks and appear strongly in Nyquist and transient spectra. QW interface traps, despite being nearly invisible at low densities in conventional C-V and AC impedance analysis, are clearly resolved through multi-exponential decay signatures in time-domain response. Bulk traps contribute to high-frequency admittance and steady-state leakage currents. By correlating each trap type to its characteristic time constant, spatial location, and spectral impact, we provide a diagnostic toolset for disentangling noise sources that degrade qubit performance. This unified methodology bridges traditional defect metrology with emerging qubit noise analysis and enables material- and process-level strategies for coherence optimization in scalable quantum devices.

Title: Dynamical breaking of inversion symmetry, strong second harmonic generation, and ferroelectricity with nonlinear phonons
Authors: Egor I. Kiselev
Abstract: We show how crystalline inversion symmetry can be dynamically broken by optical phonons with generic, hardening Kerr-like non-linearities. The symmetry-broken state is reached through a parametric instability that can be accessed by driving close to half the phonon resonance. After the onset of the instability, the system settles to a steady state with inversion-symmetry breaking phonon trajectories and strong second harmonic generation. The time averaged positions of the atoms are displaced relative to equilibrium, resulting in a ferroelectric rectification of the driving signal.

Title: Multiscale Modeling of Abnormal Grain Growth: Role of Solute Segregation and Grain Boundary Character
Authors: Albert Linda, Rajdip Mukherjee, Somnath Bhowmick
Abstract: Abnormal grain growth (AGG) influences the properties of polycrystalline materials; however, the underlying mechanisms, particularly the role of solute segregation at the grain boundary (GB), are difficult to quantify precisely. This study demonstrates a multiscale framework that integrates atomic-scale segregation energetics (using density functional theory) with mesoscale grain growth dynamics (using phase-field model) to investigate AGG, using $\alpha$-Fe as an example system. Multisite segregation energies are calculated for symmetric tilt grain boundaries (STGBs) along the $\langle 110 \rangle$ axis for nine different solutes (Co, Cr, Mn, Mo, Nb, Ni, Ti, W, and V), encompassing three different types of coincident site lattice (CSL) boundaries: $\sum 3 (11\bar{2})$, $\sum 9 (\bar{2}21)$, and $\sum 3 (\bar{1}11)$. The model takes into account the effect of solute drag on GB mobility, estimated using a bulk solute concentration of 0.1 at\%. The results demonstrate that AGG originates due to GB anisotropy, the extent of which largely depends on the type of solute atom present. Such a complex dependence necessitates using a multiscale model to understand AGG comprehensively. In general, low-energy $\Sigma 3$ boundaries are found to have higher mobility and show preferential growth for most of the solutes, other than Co. The study reveals how the distribution of GB types significantly influences AGG. When 10-30\% of the GBs are high-mobility type, crown-like morphologies are observed, leading to AGG. These findings underscore the critical role of GB chemistry and crystallography in governing AGG, and the model can be generalized to provide a predictive framework for controlling grain growth through strategic solute design in advanced alloys.

Title: Exploring transition pathways in the Landau-Brazovskii model
Authors: Zhiyi Zhang, Gang Cui, Kai Jiang, An-Chang Shi, Pingwen Zhang, Jianyuan Yin, Lei Zhang
Abstract: The Landau-Brazovskii model provides a theoretical framework for describing various phases arising from competing short- and long-range interactions in many physical systems. In this work, we investigate phase transitions among various ordered phases within the three-dimensional Landau-Brazovskii model. We construct the phase diagram of this model, which encompasses eight distinct phases, and systematically compute the transition pathways connecting various metastable and stable states using the Landau-Brazovskii saddle dynamics. Along each transition pathway, the critical nucleus is identified with some detailed analyses of its shape, energy barrier, and Hessian eigenvalues. Furthermore, we explore how the transition state is influenced by model parameters, revealing systematic trends in critical nucleus sizes and energy barrier heights. Our results provide a comprehensive characterization of the nucleation mechanisms within the Landau-Brazovskii model and offer valuable insights into the structural transformations of modulated-phase systems.

Title: Digitization Can Stall Swarm Transport: Commensurability Locking in Quantized-Sensing Chains
Authors: Caroline N. Cappetto, Penelope Messinger, Kaitlyn S. Yasumura, Miro Rothman, Tuan K. Do, Gao Wang, Liyu Liu, Robert H. Austin, Shengkai Li, Trung V. Phan
Abstract: We present a minimal model for autonomous robotic swarms in one- and higher-dimensional spaces, where identical, field-driven agents interact pairwise to self-organize spacing and independently follow local gradients sensed through quantized digital sensors. We show that the collective response of a multi-agent train amplifies sensitivity to weak gradients beyond what is achievable by a single agent. We discover a fractional transport phenomenon in which, under a uniform gradient, collective motion freezes abruptly whenever the ratio of intra-agent sensor separation to inter-agent spacing satisfies a number-theoretic commensurability condition. This commensurability locking persists even as the number of agents tends to infinity. We find that this condition is exactly solvable on the rationals -- a dense subset of real numbers -- providing analytic, testable predictions for when transport stalls. Our findings establish a surprising bridge between number theory and emergent transport in swarm robotics, informing design principles with implications for collective migration, analog computation, and even the exploration of number-theoretic structure via physical experimentation.

Title: Altermon: a magnetic-field-free parity protected qubit based on a narrow altermagnet Josephson junction
Authors: Sakineh Vosoughi-nia, Michał P. Nowak
Abstract: Altermagnets provide a new route to engineer superconducting circuits without magnetic fields. We theoretically study the Andreev bound state (ABS) spectrum of a finite-width altrmagnet-based Josephson junction and show how the $d$-wave altermagnetic symmetry and geometric confinement shape its low-energy excitations. We find a clear distinction between the two $d$-wave symmetries: $d_{x^2-y^2}$ order produces spin splitting, whereas $d_{xy}$ order preserves spin degeneracy and exhibits splitting of the ABS spectrum induced by intermode hybridization. Leveraging these novel features, we propose applying a transverse electric field to tune the system and realize a magnetic-field-free, parity-protected superconducting qubit that we call altermon.

Title: Electric field induced Berry curvature dipole and non-linear anomalous Hall effect in higher wave symmetric unconventional magnets
Authors: Srimayi Korrapati, Snehasish Nandy, Sumanta Tewari
Abstract: We investigate the second-order anomalous Hall response in two-dimensional higher-wave-symmetric magnets, including the recently discovered class of collinear magnets known as altermagnets, when subjected to a symmetry-breaking external electric field. In these systems, the first- and second-order anomalous Hall responses mediated by the first- and second-order multipoles of the Berry curvature over the occupied states vanish by symmetry. However, a symmetry-breaking dc electric field can induce a nonzero Berry curvature dipole by coupling to a nonvanishing quantum metric, also known as the Berry connection polarizability. An applied ac electric field can then generate a finite nonlinear transverse Hall effect characterized by a second harmonic response. We discuss this remarkable effect in a class of higher-order-symmetric unconventional magnets (of $p$, $d$, $f$, $g$, $i$ symmetry), including the subclass of altermagnets. We demonstrate that the electric-field-induced anomalous Hall effect in the higher-wave-symmetric magnets can serve not only as a probe of the underlying quantum metric of the occupied states but also as a means to distinguish the even ($d$-,$g$-wave) and odd ($p$-wave) order parameter symmetries defined on the square lattice.

Title: Unexpected non-universality of the time braiding phase of anyons tied by the scaling dimension
Authors: Aleksander Latyshev, Ines Safi
Abstract: We use a braiding nonequilibrium fluctuation dissipation relation linking the DC noise to the response function inferred from the braiding constraint in the time-domain with a phase $\theta$ within the UNEPT (Unified Non equilibrium Perturbative Theory). By applying the Kramers-Krönig relations, we obtain an integral equation connecting DC current and noise that involves $\theta$. By specifying to thermal states so that noise is Poissonian, we find an analytical solution for the DC current via the Wiener-Hopf technique. It reveals that the time-braiding phase is determined by the scaling dimension~$\delta$. This questions the universality of $\theta$ that can reflect the microscopic edge dynamics, in contrast to the topologically protected braiding phase in the space domain.

Title: The geometry and dynamics of annealed optimization in the coherent Ising machine with hidden and planted solutions
Authors: Federico Ghimenti, Adithya Sriram, Atsushi Yamamura, Hideo Mabuchi, Surya Ganguli
Abstract: The coherent Ising machine (CIM) is a nonconventional hardware architecture for finding approximate solutions to large-scale combinatorial optimization problems. It operates by annealing a laser gain parameter to adiabatically deform a high-dimensional energy landscape over a set of soft spins, going from a simple convex landscape to the more complex optimization landscape of interest. We address how the evolving energy landscapes guides the optimization dynamics against problems with hidden planted solutions. We study the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin-glass with ferromagnetic couplings that favor a hidden configuration by combining the replica method, random matrix theory, the Kac-Rice method and dynamical mean field theory. We characterize energy, number, location, and Hessian eigenspectra of global minima, local minima, and critical points as the landscape evolves. We find that low energy global minima develop soft-modes which the optimization dynamics can exploit to descend the energy landscape. Even when these global minima are aligned to the hidden configuration, there can be exponentially many higher energy local minima that are all unaligned with the hidden solution. Nevertheless, the annealed optimization dynamics can evade this cloud of unaligned high energy local minima and descend near to aligned lower energy global minima. Eventually, as the landscape is further annealed, these global minima become rigid, terminating any further optimization gains from annealing. We further consider a second optimization problem, the Wishart planted ensemble, which contains a hidden planted solution in a landscape with tunable ruggedness. We describe CIM phase transitions between recoverability and non-recoverability of the hidden solution. Overall, we find intriguing relations between high-dimensional geometry and dynamics in analog machines for combinatorial optimization.

Title: Koopman Mode Decomposition of Thermodynamic Dissipation in Nonlinear Langevin Dynamics
Authors: Daiki Sekizawa, Sosuke Ito, Masafumi Oizumi
Abstract: Nonlinear oscillations are commonly observed in complex systems far from equilibrium, such as living organisms. These oscillations are essential for sustaining vital processes, like neuronal firing, circadian rhythms, and heartbeats. In such systems, thermodynamic dissipation is necessary to maintain oscillations against noise. However, due to their nonlinear dynamics, it has been challenging to determine how the characteristics of oscillations, such as frequency, amplitude, and coherent patterns across elements, influence dissipation. To resolve this issue, we employ Koopman mode decomposition, which recasts nonlinear dynamics as a linear evolution in a function space. This linearization allows the dynamics to be decomposed into temporal oscillatory modes coherent across elements, with the Koopman eigenvalues determining their frequencies. Using this method, we decompose thermodynamic dissipation caused by nonconservative forces into contributions from oscillatory modes in overdamped nonlinear Langevin dynamics. We show that the dissipation from each mode is proportional to its frequency squared and its intensity, providing an interpretable, mode-by-mode picture. In the noisy FitzHugh--Nagumo model, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework in quantifying the impact of oscillatory modes on dissipation during nonlinear phenomena like stochastic resonance and bifurcation. For instance, our analysis of stochastic resonance reveals that the greatest dissipation at the optimal noise intensity is supported by a broad spectrum of frequencies, whereas at non-optimal noise levels, dissipation is dominated by specific frequency modes. Our work offers a general approach to connecting oscillations to dissipation in noisy environments and improves our understanding of diverse oscillation phenomena from a nonequilibrium thermodynamic perspective.

Title: Von Neumann Algebras in Double-Scaled SYK
Authors: Jiuci Xu
Abstract: It has been argued that a finite effective temperature emerges and characterizes the thermal property of double-scaled SYK model in the infinite temperature limit. Meanwhile, in the static patch of de Sitter, the maximally entangled state satisfies a KMS condition at infinite temperature, suggesting the Type II$_1$ nature of the observable algebra gravitationally dressed to the observer. In this work, we analyze the double-scaled algebra generated by chord operators in the double-scaled SYK model and demonstrate that it exhibits features reflecting both perspectives. Specifically, we prove that the algebra is a Type II$_1$ factor, and that the empty state with no chord satisfies the tracial property, in agreement with expectations from earlier work. We further show that this state is cyclic and separating for the double-scaled algebra, based on which we explore its modular structure. We then explore various physical limits of the theory, drawing connections to JT gravity, the Hilbert space of baby universes, and Brownian double-scaled SYK. We also present analytic solutions to the energy spectrum in both the zero- and one-particle sectors of the left/right chord Hamiltonian.

Title: Exploring $G$-ality defects in 2-dim QFTs
Authors: Da-Chuan Lu, Zhengdi Sun, Zipei Zhang
Abstract: The Tambara-Yamagami (TY) fusion category symmetry $\text{TY}(\mathbb{A},\chi,\epsilon)$ describes the enhanced non-invertible self-duality symmetry of a $2$-dim QFT under gauging a finite Abelian group $\mathbb{A}$. We generalize the enhanced non-invertible symmetries by considering twisted gauging which allows stacking $\mathbb{A}$-SPTs before and after the gauging. Such non-invertible symmetries can be obtained from invertible anyon permutation symmetries of the $3$-dim SymTFT. Consider a finite group $G$ formed by (un)twisted gaugings of $\mathbb{A}$, a $2$-dim QFT invariant under topological manipulations in $G$ admits non-invertible \textit{$G$-ality defects}. We study the classification and the physical implication of the $G$-ality defects using the SymTFT and the group-theoretical fusion categories, with three concrete examples. 1) Triality with $\mathbb{A} = \mathbb{Z}_N \times \mathbb{Z}_N$ where $N$ is coprime with $3$. The classification was previously determined by Jordan and Larson where the data is similar to the $\text{TY}$ fusion categories, and we determine the anomaly of these fusion categories. 2) $p$-ality with $\mathbb{A} = \mathbb{Z}_p \times \mathbb{Z}_p$ where $p$ is an odd prime. We consider two such categories $\mathcal{P}_{\pm,m}$ which are distinguished by different choices of the symmetry fractionalization, a new data that does not appear in the TY classification, and show that they have distinct anomaly structures and spin selection rules. 3) $S_3$-ality with $\mathbb{A} = \mathbb{Z}_N \times \mathbb{Z}_N$. We study their classification explicitly for $N < 20$ via SymTFT, and provide a group-theoretical construction for certain $N$. We find $N=5$ is the minimal $N$ to admit an $S_3$-ality and $N=11$ is the minimal $N$ to admit a group-theoretical $S_3$-ality.

Title: Connectivity structure and dynamics of nonlinear recurrent neural networks
Authors: David G. Clark, Owen Marschall, Alexander van Meegen, Ashok Litwin-Kumar
Abstract: Studies of the dynamics of nonlinear recurrent neural networks often assume independent and identically distributed couplings, but large-scale connectomics data indicate that biological neural circuits exhibit markedly different connectivity properties. These include rapidly decaying singular-value spectra and structured singular-vector overlaps. Here, we develop a theory to analyze how these forms of structure shape high-dimensional collective activity in nonlinear recurrent neural networks. We first introduce the random-mode model, a random-matrix ensemble related to the singular-value decomposition that enables control over the spectrum and right-left mode overlaps. Then, using a novel path-integral calculation, we derive analytical expressions that reveal how connectivity structure affects features of collective dynamics: the dimension of activity, which quantifies the number of high-variance collective-activity fluctuations, and the temporal correlations that characterize the timescales of these fluctuations. We show that connectivity structure can be invisible in single-neuron activities while dramatically shaping collective activity. Furthermore, despite the nonlinear, high-dimensional nature of these networks, the dimension of activity depends on just two connectivity parameters -- the variance of the couplings and the effective rank of the coupling matrix, which quantifies the number of dominant rank-one connectivity components. We contrast the effects of single-neuron heterogeneity and low dimensional connectivity, making predictions about how z-scoring data affects the dimension of activity. Finally, we demonstrate the presence of structured overlaps between left and right modes in the Drosophila connectome, incorporate them into the theory, and show how they further shape collective dynamics.

Title: Statistical mechanical mapping and maximum-likelihood thresholds for the surface code under generic single-qubit coherent errors
Authors: Jan Behrends, Benjamin Béri
Abstract: The surface code, one of the leading candidates for quantum error correction, is known to protect encoded quantum information against stochastic, i.e., incoherent errors. The protection against coherent errors, such as from unwanted gate rotations, is however understood only for special cases, such as rotations about the $X$ or $Z$ axes. Here we consider generic single-qubit coherent errors in the surface code, i.e., rotations by angle $\alpha$ about an axis that can be chosen arbitrarily. We develop a statistical mechanical mapping for such errors and perform entanglement analysis in transfer matrix space to numerically establish the existence of an error-correcting phase, which we chart in a subspace of rotation axes to estimate the corresponding maximum-likelihood thresholds $\alpha_\mathrm{th}$. The classical statistical mechanics model we derive is a random-bond Ising model with complex couplings and four-spin interactions (i.e., a complex-coupled Ashkin-Teller model). The error correcting phase, $\alpha<\alpha_\mathrm{th}$, where the logical error rate decreases exponentially with code distance, is shown to correspond in transfer matrix space to a gapped one-dimensional quantum Hamiltonian exhibiting spontaneous breaking of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. Our numerical results rest on two key ingredients: (i) we show that the state evolution under the transfer matrix -- a non-unitary (1+1)-dimensional quantum circuit -- can be efficiently numerically simulated using matrix product states. Based on this approach, (ii) we also develop an algorithm to (approximately) sample syndromes based on their Born probability. The $\alpha_\mathrm{th}$ values we find show that the maximum likelihood thresholds for coherent errors are larger than those for the corresponding incoherent errors (from the Pauli twirl), and significantly exceed the values found using minimum weight perfect matching.

Title: Universal framework for anisotropic particles with resonance laws and splitting
Authors: Asaf Farhi, Haim Suchowski
Abstract: Nanophotonics enables unprecedented control over light-matter interactions, yet conventional isotropic materials limit the spectral range and richness of mode responses in subwavelength structures. Anisotropic subwavelength particles -- ubiquitous in natural and engineered systems -- offer new degrees of freedom that couple geometry and material properties, unlocking previously inaccessible spectral regions. Here, we establish a universal quasistatic framework describing the eigenmodes and resonance conditions of uniaxial and biaxial nanoparticles. Closed-form solutions reveal axial-permittivity sum rules and a fundamental material-anisotropy-induced symmetry breaking, manifesting as resonance splitting and novel radiation patterns. Generalizing the theory to ellipsoids provides geometric tunability of the multispectral response, while analytic predictions of quality factors elucidate how anisotropy governs mode localization and energy loss. Full-wave simulations of h-BN and $\alpha$-MoO$_3$ nanoparticles confirm the theory and highlight its predictive power. This framework unifies the understanding of anisotropic nanostructures across optics, thermal transport, and magnetism, opening pathways to a new generation of photonic devices with tunable multispectral response and controlled emission patterns, including directional detectors and spectrally selective mid infrared sensors.

Title: Memristive Nanowire Network for Energy Efficient Audio Classification: Pre-Processing-Free Reservoir Computing with Reduced Latency
Authors: Akshaya Rajesh (1), Pavithra Ananthasubramanian (1), Nagarajan Raghavan (1), Ankush Kumar (1 and 2) ((1) nano-Macro Reliability Laboratory (nMRL), Engineering and Product Development Pillar, Singapore University of Technology and Design, 8, Somapah Road, 487372, Singapore, (2) Centre for Nanotechnology, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, Roorkee, Uttrakhand, 247667, India)
Abstract: Efficient audio feature extraction is critical for low-latency, resource-constrained speech recognition. Conventional preprocessing techniques, such as Mel Spectrogram, Perceptual Linear Prediction (PLP), and Learnable Spectrogram, achieve high classification accuracy but require large feature sets and significant computation. The low-latency and power efficiency benefits of neuromorphic computing offer a strong potential for audio classification. Here, we introduce memristive nanowire networks as a neuromorphic hardware preprocessing layer for spoken-digit classification, a capability not previously demonstrated. Nanowire networks extract compact, informative features directly from raw audio, achieving a favorable trade-off between accuracy, dimensionality reduction from the original audio size (data compression) , and training time efficiency. Compared with state-of-the-art software techniques, nanowire features reach 98.95% accuracy with 66 times data compression (XGBoost) and 97.9% accuracy with 255 times compression (Random Forest) in sub-second training latency. Across multiple classifiers nanowire features consistently achieve more than 90% accuracy with more than 62.5 times compression, outperforming features extracted by conventional state-of-the-art techniques such as MFCC in efficiency without loss of performance. Moreover, nanowire features achieve 96.5% accuracy classifying multispeaker audios, outperforming all state-of-the-art feature accuracies while achieving the highest data compression and lowest training time. Nanowire network preprocessing also enhances linear separability of audio data, improving simple classifier performance and generalizing across speakers. These results demonstrate that memristive nanowire networks provide a novel, low-latency, and data-efficient feature extraction approach, enabling high-performance neuromorphic audio classification.

Title: No Free Lunch From Random Feature Ensembles: Scaling Laws and Near-Optimality Conditions
Authors: Benjamin S. Ruben, William L. Tong, Hamza Tahir Chaudhry, Cengiz Pehlevan
Abstract: Given a fixed budget for total model size, one must choose between training a single large model or combining the predictions of multiple smaller models. We investigate this trade-off for ensembles of random-feature ridge regression models in both the overparameterized and underparameterized regimes. Using deterministic equivalent risk estimates, we prove that when a fixed number of parameters is distributed among $K$ independently trained models, the ridge-optimized test risk increases with $K$. Consequently, a single large model achieves optimal performance. We then ask when ensembles can achieve \textit{near}-optimal performance. In the overparameterized regime, we show that, to leading order, the test error depends on ensemble size and model size only through the total feature count, so that overparameterized ensembles consistently achieve near-optimal performance. To understand underparameterized ensembles, we derive scaling laws for the test risk as a function of total parameter count when the ensemble size and parameters per ensemble member are jointly scaled according to a ``growth exponent'' $\ell$. While the optimal error scaling is always achieved by increasing model size with a fixed ensemble size, our analysis identifies conditions on the kernel and task eigenstructure under which near-optimal scaling laws can be obtained by joint scaling of ensemble size and model size.

Title: Omnidirectional shuttling to avoid valley excitations in Si/SiGe quantum wells
Authors: Róbert Németh, Vatsal K. Bandaru, Pedro Alves, Merritt P. Losert, Emma Brann, Owen M. Eskandari, Hudaiba Soomro, Avani Vivrekar, M. A. Eriksson, Mark Friesen
Abstract: Conveyor-mode shuttling is a key approach for implementing intermediate-range coupling between electron-spin qubits in quantum dots. Initial implementations are encouraging; however, long shuttling trajectories are guaranteed to encounter regions of low conduction-band valley energy splittings, due to the presence of random-alloy disorder in Si/SiGe quantum wells. Here, we theoretically explore two schemes for avoiding valley-state excitations at these valley-splitting minima, by allowing the electrons to detour around them. A multichannel shuttling scheme allows electrons to tunnel between parallel channels, while a two-dimensional (2D) shuttler provides full omnidirectional control. Using simulations, we estimate shuttling fidelities in these two schemes, obtaining a clear preference for the 2D shuttler. Based on such encouraging results, we propose a modular qubit architecture based on 2D shuttling, which enables all-to-all connectivity within qubit plaquettes and high-fidelity communication between different plaquettes.

Title: Measurement-induced Lévy flights of quantum information
Authors: Igor Poboiko, Marcin Szyniszewski, Christopher J. Turner, Igor V. Gornyi, Alexander D. Mirlin, Arijeet Pal
Abstract: We explore a model of free fermions in one dimension, subject to frustrated (non-commuting) local measurements across adjacent sites, which resolves the fermions into non-orthogonal orbitals, misaligned from the underlying lattice. For maximal misalignment, superdiffusive behavior emerges from the vanishing of the measurement-induced quasiparticle decay rate at one point in the Brillouin zone, which generates fractal-scaling entanglement entropy $S \propto \ell^{1/3}$ for a subsystem of length $\ell$. We derive an effective non-linear sigma model with long-range couplings responsible for Lévy flights in entanglement propagation, which we confirm with large-scale numerical simulations. When the misalignment is reduced, the entanglement exhibits, with increasing $\ell$, consecutive regimes of superdiffusive, $S\propto \ell^{1/3}$, diffusive, $S\propto \ln \ell$, and localized, $S = \rm{const}$, behavior. Our findings show how intricate fractal-scaling entanglement can be produced for local Hamiltonians and measurements.

Title: E2Former: An Efficient and Equivariant Transformer with Linear-Scaling Tensor Products
Authors: Yunyang Li, Lin Huang, Zhihao Ding, Chu Wang, Xinran Wei, Han Yang, Zun Wang, Chang Liu, Yu Shi, Peiran Jin, Tao Qin, Mark Gerstein, Jia Zhang
Abstract: Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (EGNNs) have demonstrated significant success in modeling microscale systems, including those in chemistry, biology and materials science. However, EGNNs face substantial computational challenges due to the high cost of constructing edge features via spherical tensor products, making them impractical for large-scale systems. To address this limitation, we introduce E2Former, an equivariant and efficient transformer architecture that incorporates the Wigner $6j$ convolution (Wigner $6j$ Conv). By shifting the computational burden from edges to nodes, the Wigner $6j$ Conv reduces the complexity from $O(|\mathcal{E}|)$ to $ O(| \mathcal{V}|)$ while preserving both the model's expressive power and rotational equivariance. We show that this approach achieves a 7x-30x speedup compared to conventional $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ convolutions. Furthermore, our empirical results demonstrate that the derived E2Former mitigates the computational challenges of existing approaches without compromising the ability to capture detailed geometric information. This development could suggest a promising direction for scalable and efficient molecular modeling.

Title: Atomistic Theory of Plasmon-Induced Hot-carriers in Al Nanoparticles
Authors: Gengyue Dong, Simão João, Hanwen Jin, Johannes Lischner
Abstract: Hot electrons and holes generated from the decay of localized surface plasmons (LSPs) in aluminum nanostructures have significant potential for applications in photocatalysis, photodetection and other optoelectronic devices. Here, we present a theoretical study of hot-carrier generation in aluminum nanospheres using a recently developed modelling approach that combines a solution of the macroscopic Maxwell equation with large-scale atomistic tight-binding simulations. Different from standard plasmonic metals, such as gold or silver, we find that the energetic distribution of hot electrons and holes in aluminium nanoparticles is almost constant for all allowed energies. Only at relatively high photon energies, a reduction of the generation rate of highly energetic holes and electrons close to the Fermi level is observed which is attributed to band structure effects suppressing interband decay channels. We also investigate the dependence of hot-carrier properties on the nanoparticle diameter and the environment dielectric constant. The insights from our study can inform experimental efforts towards highly efficient aluminum-based hot-carrier devices.

Title: Phase transitions in the inner crust of neutron stars within the superfluid band theory: Competition between $^1\text{S}_0$ pairing and spin polarization under finite temperature and magnetic field
Authors: Kenta Yoshimura, Kazuyuki Sekizawa
Abstract: Phase transitions of matter under changes of external environment such as temperature and magnetic field have attracted great interests to various quantum many-body systems. Several phase transitions must have occurred in neutron stars as well such as transitions from normal to superfluid/superconducting phases and crust formation. In this work, we extend the superfluid band theory, which has been formulated in our previous work [K. Yoshimura and K. Sekizawa, Phys. Rev. C 109, 065804 (2024)] based on the Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) for superfluid systems, into the finite temperature and finite magnetic field systems. As a result of the finite temperature calculations, we find that the superfluidity of neutrons dissapears at around $k_\text{B}T=0.6$--$0.9\,$ MeV, and ``melting'' of nuclear slabs, that is, a structural change into the uniform matter, takes place at around $k_\text{B}T=2.5$--$4.5\,$ MeV. We also reveal that these transition temperatures exhibit a systematical dependence on the baryon densities. By turning on the magnetic field, we find that protons' spin gets polarized at around $B=10^{16}\,$G, whereas neutrons' spin is kept unpolarized on average up to around $B=10^{17}\,$G. Intriguingly, our microscopic calculations reveal that neutrons' spin is actually polarized locally inside and outside of the slab already at $B\sim10^{16}\,$G, while keeping the system unpolarized in total. As a conclusion, we have demonstrated validity and usefulness of the fully self-consistent superfluid nuclear band theory for describing neutron star matter under arbitrary temperature and magnetic field. Critical temperatures and magnetic fields have been predicted for 1) superfluid to normal transition, 2) crust formation, and 3) spin polarization, under conditions relevant to realistic neutron star environments.

Title: Simulating lattice fermion doubling with a Floquet drive
Authors: Raúl A. Briceño, William Gyory, Thomas Iadecola, Srimoyee Sen
Abstract: We consider a recently discovered mathematical correspondence between the spectra of a naively discretized lattice fermion and that of a periodically driven (i.e., Floquet) quantum system and enhance it into an infrared equivalence between the two systems. The equivalence can be framed as a duality relation, allowing us to simulate a two-flavor discrete-time fermion theory on the lattice side, where the two flavors arise from time discretization, using a single-flavor fermion theory on the Floquet side. Our demonstration establishes an equivalence between (i) the fermion content, (ii) the correlation functions, and consequently (iii) observables of the two theories in the infrared, going substantially beyond the previously discovered spectral equivalence. We also show how interactions may be incorporated into this enhanced infrared equivalence.

Title: Lax dynamics
Authors: Stefano Lepri
Abstract: A novel approach is proposed to characterize the dynamics of perturbed many-body integrable systems. Focusing on the paradigmatic case of the Toda chain under non-integrable Hamiltonian perturbations, this study introduces a method based the time evolution of the Lax eigenvalues $\lambda_\alpha$ as a proxy of the quasi-particles velocities and of the perturbed Toda actions. A set of exact equations of motion for the $\lambda_\alpha$ is derived that closely resemble those for eigenenergies of a quantum problem (also known as the Pechukas-Yukawa gas). Numerical simulations suggest that the invariant measure of such dynamics is basically the thermal density of states of the Toda lattice, regardless of the form of the perturbation.

Title: Integer Lattice Gas with a sampling collision operator for the fluctuating Navier-Stokes Equation
Authors: Noah Seekins, Alexander J. Wagner
Abstract: This paper constitutes a step in the direction of developing integer lattice gas methods as an attractive alternative to lattice Boltzmann methods. Here we show that to Boltzmann limit the one dimensional Blommel integer lattice gas is very close to entropic lattice Boltzmann. More interestingly the integer lattice gas retains additional correlations that prevent the existence of a well defined Boltzmann limit. In the analysis of the decaying sine wave we will see that in some situations the bulk viscosity can crucially depend on such correlations beyond the Boltzmann limit. A sampling collision operator, introduced here, can speed up the execution time to make the algorithm obtain comparable computational efficiency to entropic lattice Boltzmann methods.

Title: Fast initialization of Bell states with Schrödinger cats in multi-mode systems
Authors: Miriam Resch, Ciprian Padurariu, Björn Kubala, Joachim Ankerhold
Abstract: Schrödinger cat states play an important role for applications in continuous variable quantum information technologies. As macroscopic superpositions they are inherently protected against certain types of noise making cat qubits a promising candidate for quantum computing. It has been shown recently that cat states occur naturally in driven Kerr parametric oscillators (KPOs) as degenerate ground states with even and odd parity that are adiabatically connected to the respective lowest two Fock states by switching off the drive. To perform operations with several cat qubits one crucial task is to create entanglement between them. Here, we demonstrate efficient transformations of multi-mode cat states through adiabatic and diabatic switching between Kerr-type Hamiltonians with degenerate ground state manifolds. These transformations can be used to directly initialize the cats as entangled Bell states in contrast to initializing them from entangled Fock states.

Title: Sequential Generation of Two-dimensional Super-area-law States with Local Parent Hamiltonian
Authors: Wucheng Zhang
Abstract: We construct examples of highly entangled two-dimensional states by exploiting a correspondence between stochastic processes in $d$ dimensions and quantum states in $d+1$ dimensions. The entanglement structure of these states, which we explicitly calculate, can be tuned between area law, sub-volume law, and volume law. This correspondence also enables a sequential generation protocol: the states can be prepared through a series of unitary transformations acting on an auxiliary system. We also discuss the conditions under which these states have local, frustration-free parent Hamiltonians.

Title: On the validity of the complex Langevin method near the deconfining phase transition in QCD at finite density
Authors: Shoichiro Tsutsui, Yuhma Asano, Yuta Ito, Hideo Matsufuru, Yusuke Namekawa, Jun Nishimura, Shinji Shimasaki, Asato Tsuchiya
Abstract: In our previous paper [JHEP 10 (2020) 144], we found that the complex Langevin (CL) method works for QCD at finite density on the $16^3 \times 32$ lattice in the low-temperature high-density regime within the range $\mu / T = 1.6 - 9.6$ with $\mu$ and $T$ being the quark chemical potential and the temperature, which enabled us to see a clear trend towards the formation of the Fermi sphere. Here we investigate the validity of the CL method on the $24^3 \times 12$ lattice in the deconfined phase near the deconfinement phase transition. As before, we use four-flavor staggered fermions and judge the validity using the criterion based on the probability distribution of the drift term. The spatial extent is $L = (1.3 - 2.7 {\rm ~fm} )> \Lambda_{\rm LQCD}^{-1} \sim 1{\rm ~fm}$, in contrast to our previous study with $L < \Lambda_{\rm LQCD}^{-1}$. We find that the CL method works in a broad region up to $\mu / T = 4.8$, while it starts to fail as we approach the phase boundary due to the singular drift problem, which can be understood qualitatively by extending the Banks-Casher relation to the case at finite density.

Title: Emerging axion detection in artificial magnetoelectric materials
Authors: Runyu Lei, Chen-Hui Xie, Jiayi Liu, Zhong Liu, Xin Liu, Yu Gao, Sichun Sun, Jinxing Zhang
Abstract: Axions are considered a key component of dark matter, characterized by very weak couplings to fermions and Chern-Simons couplings to gauge fields. We propose a novel detection mechanism based on symmetry-breaking magnetoelectric materials with a linear axionic coupling between magnetization and ferroelectric polarization. The focus is on a strain gradient Sr2IrO4 film, where the breaking of space-inversion symmetry results in an emergent polar phase and an out-of-plane magnetic moment, exhibiting a flexomagnetoelectric effect. In this material, the linear P||M enables a direct coupling between the external axion field and the intrinsic axion-like field, which amplifies the weak electromagnetic signals induced by axions, paving the way for pioneering axion detection. In contrast to conventional detection techniques, this mechanism is expected to enhance the sensitivity of the axion-electron and axion-photon coupling, providing a novel platform for axion detection and advancing the study of dark matter through the magnetoelectric effect.

Title: Exactly solvable dissipative dynamics and one-form strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking in interacting two-dimensional spin systems
Authors: Lucas Sá, Benjamin Béri
Abstract: We study the dissipative dynamics of a class of interacting ``gamma-matrix'' spin models coupled to a Markovian environment. For spins on an arbitrary graph, we construct a Lindbladian that maps to a non-Hermitian model of free Majorana fermions hopping on the graph with a background classical $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field. We show, analytically and numerically, that the steady states and relaxation dynamics are qualitatively independent of the choice of the underlying graph, in stark contrast to the Hamiltonian case. We also show that the exponentially many steady states provide a concrete example of mixed-state topological order, in the sense of strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking of a one-form symmetry. While encoding only classical information, the steady states still exhibit long-range quantum correlations. Afterward, we examine the relaxation processes toward the steady state by numerically computing decay rates, which we generically find to be finite, even in the dissipationless limit. However, we identify symmetry sectors where fermion-parity conservation is enhanced to fermion-number conservation, where we can analytically bound the decay rates and prove that they vanish in the limits of both infinitely weak and infinitely strong dissipation. Finally, we show that while the choice of coherent dynamics is very flexible, exact solvability strongly constrains the allowed form of dissipation. Our work establishes an analytically tractable framework to explore nonequilibrium quantum phases of matter and the relaxation mechanisms toward them.

Title: Bell sampling in Quantum Monte Carlo simulations
Authors: Poetri Sonya Tarabunga, Yi-Ming Ding
Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods are essential for the numerical study of large-scale quantum many-body systems, yet their utility has been significantly hampered by the difficulty in computing key quantities such as off-diagonal operators and entanglement. This work introduces Bell-QMC, a novel QMC framework leveraging Bell sampling, a two-copy measurement protocol in the transversal Bell basis. We demonstrate that Bell-QMC enables an efficient and unbiased estimation of both challenging classes of observables, offering a significant advantage over previous QMC approaches. Notably, the entanglement across all system partitions can be computed in a single Bell-QMC simulation. We implement this method within the stochastic series expansion (SSE), where we design an efficient update scheme for sampling the configurations in the Bell basis. We demonstrate our algorithm in the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model and the two-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory, extracting universal quantum features using only simple diagonal measurements. This work establishes Bell-QMC as a powerful framework that significantly expands the accessible quantum properties in QMC simulations, providing a substantial advantage over conventional QMC.

Title: Energy transport in holographic junctions
Authors: Yan Liu, Chuan-Yi Wang
Abstract: We study energy transport in a conformal junction connecting three 2D conformal field theories using the AdS/CFT correspondence. The holographic dual consists of three AdS$_3$ spacetimes joined along the worldsheet of a tensile string anchored at the junction. Within a specific range of string tension, where the bulk solution is uniquely determined, we find that all energy reflection and transmission coefficients vary monotonically with the string tension. Notably, the total energy transmission, which quantifies the energy flux from one CFT through the junction, is bounded above by the effective central charge associated with both the CFTs and the junction. Results for energy transport in conformal interfaces are recovered in a special limit. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to junctions connecting $N$ 2D CFTs.

Title: Simulating the interplay of dipolar and quadrupolar interactions in NMR by spin dynamic mean-field theory
Authors: Timo Gräßer, Götz S. Uhrig
Abstract: The simulation of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments is a notoriously difficult task, if many spins participate in the dynamics. The recently established dynamic mean-field theory for high-temperature spin systems (spinDMFT) represents an efficient yet accurate method to deal with this scenario. SpinDMFT reduces a complex lattice system to a time-dependent single-site problem, which can be solved numerically with small computational effort. Since the approach retains local quantum degrees of freedom, a quadrupolar term can be exactly incorporated. This allows us to study the interplay of dipolar and quadrupolar interactions for any parameter range, i.e., without the need for a perturbative treatment. We highlight the relevance of local quantum effects by a comparison with the classical analogue system.

Title: Information in 4D-STEM: Where it is, and How to Use it
Authors: Desheng Ma, Guanxing Li, David A Muller, Steven E Zeltmann
Abstract: Contrast transfer mechanisms for electron scattering have been extensively studied in transmission electron microscopy. Here we revisit H. Rose's generalized contrast formalism from scattering theory to understand where information is encoded in four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) data, and consequently identify new imaging modes that can also serve as crude but fast approximations to ptychography. We show that tilt correction and summation of the symmetric and antisymmetric scattering components within the bright-field disk -- corresponding to tilt-corrected bright field (tcBF) and tilt-corrected differential phase contrast (tcDPC) respectively -- enables aberration-corrected, bright-field phase contrast imaging (acBF) that makes maximal use of the 4D-STEM information under the weak phase object approximation (WPOA). Beyond the WPOA, we identify the contrast transfer from the interference between inelastic/plural scattering electrons, which show up as quadratic terms, and show that under overfocus conditions, contrast can be further enhanced at selected frequencies, similar to phase-contrast TEM imaging. There is also usable information encoded in the dark field region which we demonstrate by constructing a tilt-corrected dark-field image (tcDF) that sums up the incoherent scattering components and holds promise for depth sectioning of strong scatterers. This framework generalizes phase contrast theory in conventional/scanning transmission electron microscopy to 4D-STEM and provides analytical models and insights into full-field iterative ptychography, which blindly exploits all above contrast mechanisms.

Title: FDTRImageEnhancer: Combining Physics-Informed Deconvolution and Microstructure-Aware Deep Learning to Enhance Thermal Images
Authors: Alesanmi Richmond Rerelope Odufisan
Abstract: We present FDTRImageEnhancer, an open-source computational framework that improves thermal conductivity mapping from Frequency Domain ThermoReflectance (FDTR) phase data by integrating a physics-based Gaussian convolution abstraction with microstructure-aware deep learning. The Gaussian kernel models the spatial averaging effects of pump and probe beams, while k-means clustering of high-resolution structural images reduces the parameter space for inverse modeling. A physics-informed neural network jointly minimizes phase-data error and deviation from analytically recovered conductivity maps, enabling the detection of grain boundary thermal conductivity drops visually obscured in conventional FDTR inversions. Demonstrated on finite element-generated synthetic data, the framework recovers bulk values within less than 0.5% error and qualitatively resolves grain boundary effects despite limited image resolution. Full Python code and datasets are provided for reproducibility, with the methodology readily adaptable to other inverse thermal transport problems.

Title: LSM and CPT
Authors: Nathan Seiberg, Shu-Heng Shao, Wucheng Zhang
Abstract: We study a number of 1+1d lattice models with anti-unitary symmetries that simultaneously reflect space and reverse time. Some of these symmetries are anomalous, leading to Lieb-Schultz-Mattis-type constraints, thus excluding a trivially gapped phase. Examples include a mod 8 anomaly in the Majorana chain and various mod 2 anomalies in the spin chain. In some cases, there is an exact, non-anomalous lattice symmetry that flows in the continuum to CPT. In some other cases, the CPT symmetry of the continuum theory is emergent or absent. Depending on the model, the anomaly of the lattice model is matched in the continuum in different ways. In particular, it can be mapped to an emergent anomaly of an emanant symmetry.

Title: Exact Solution for Two $δ$-Interacting Bosons on a Ring in the Presence of a $δ$-Barrier: Asymmetric Bethe Ansatz for Spatially Odd States
Authors: Maxim Olshanii, Mathias Albert, Gianni Aupetit-Diallo, Patrizia Vignolo, Steven G. Jackson
Abstract: In this article, we apply the recently proposed Asymmetric Bethe Ansatz method to the problem of two one-dimensional, short-range-interacting bosons on a ring in the presence of a $\delta$-function barrier. Only half of the Hilbert space--namely, the two-body states that are odd under point inversion about the position of the barrier--is accessible to this method. The other half is presumably non-integrable. We consider benchmarking the recently proposed $1/g$ expansion about the hard-core boson point [A. G. Volosniev, D. V. Fedorov, A. S. Jensen, M. Valiente, N. T. Zinner, Nature Communications 5, 5300 (2014)] as one application of our results. Additionally, we find that when the $\delta$-barrier is converted to a $\delta$-well with strength equal to that of the particle-particle interaction, the system exhibits the spectrum of its non-interacting counterpart while its eigenstates display features of a strongly interacting system. We discuss this phenomenon in the "Summary and Future Research" section of our paper.

Title: Automated Constitutive Model Discovery by Pairing Sparse Regression Algorithms with Model Selection Criteria
Authors: Jorge-Humberto Urrea-Quintero, David Anton, Laura De Lorenzis, Henning Wessels
Abstract: The automated discovery of constitutive models from data has recently emerged as a promising alternative to the traditional model calibration paradigm. In this work, we present a fully automated framework for constitutive model discovery that systematically pairs three sparse regression algorithms (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Least Angle Regression (LARS), and Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP)) with three model selection criteria: $K$-fold cross-validation (CV), Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). This pairing yields nine distinct algorithms for model discovery and enables a systematic exploration of the trade-off between sparsity, predictive performance, and computational cost. While LARS serves as an efficient path-based solver for the $\ell_1$-constrained problem, OMP is introduced as a tractable heuristic for $\ell_0$-regularized selection. The framework is applied to both isotropic and anisotropic hyperelasticity, utilizing both synthetic and experimental datasets. Results reveal that all nine algorithm-criterion combinations perform consistently well in discovering isotropic and anisotropic materials, yielding highly accurate constitutive models. These findings broaden the range of viable discovery algorithms beyond $\ell_1$-based approaches such as LASSO.

Title: Effective Dynamics for Weakly Interacting Bosons in an Iterated High-Density Thermodynamic Limit
Authors: Daniele Ferretti, Kalle Koskinen
Abstract: We study the time evolution of weakly interacting Bose gases on a three-dimensional torus of arbitrary volume. The coupling constant is supposed to be inversely proportional to the density, which is considered to be large and independent of the particle number. We take into account a class of initial states exhibiting quasi-complete Bose-Einstein condensation. For each fixed time in a finite interval, we prove the convergence of the one-particle reduced density matrix towards the projection onto the normalised order parameter describing the condensate - evolving according to the Hartree equation - in the iterated limit where the volume (and therefore the particle number), and subsequently the density go to infinity. The rate of convergence depends only on the density and on the decay of both the expected number of particles and the energy of the initial quasi-vacuum state.

Title: Beyond Belief Propagation: Cluster-Corrected Tensor Network Contraction with Exponential Convergence
Authors: Siddhant Midha, Yifan F. Zhang
Abstract: Tensor network contraction on arbitrary graphs is a fundamental computational challenge with applications ranging from quantum simulation to error correction. While belief propagation (BP) provides a powerful approximation algorithm for this task, its accuracy limitations are poorly understood and systematic improvements remain elusive. Here, we develop a rigorous theoretical framework for BP in tensor networks, leveraging insights from statistical mechanics to devise a \emph{cluster expansion} that systematically improves the BP approximation. We prove that the cluster expansion converges exponentially fast if an object called the \emph{loop contribution} decays sufficiently fast with the loop size, giving a rigorous error bound on BP. We also provide a simple and efficient algorithm to compute the cluster expansion to arbitrary order. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on the two-dimensional Ising model, where we find that our method significantly improves upon BP and existing corrective algorithms such as loop series expansion. Our work opens the door to a systematic theory of BP for tensor networks and its applications in decoding classical and quantum error-correcting codes and simulating quantum systems.
