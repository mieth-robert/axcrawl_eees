Title: Time-reversal positivity
Authors: Zhong-Chao Wei
Abstract: We propose a new analytical tool called time-reversal positivity. It is an analogue of the Majorana reflection positivity in time-reversal symmetric case. This new time-reversal positivity can fully explain the relationship between time-reversal symmetry and the sign-free property in quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Using a cone-theoretical method, we show the ground state uniqueness for the time-reversal symmetric non-hermitian Hubbard model.

Title: A Wigner Matrix Based Convolution Algorithm For Matrix Elements in the LCAO Method
Authors: Tyler C. Sterling
Abstract: The linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) method uses a small basis set in exchange for expensive matrix element calculations. The most efficient approximation for the matrix element calculations is the two-center approximation (2CA) in tight binding (TB). In the 2CA, a variety of matrix elements are neglected with only "two-center integrals" (2CI) remaining. The 2CI are calculated efficiently by rotating to symmetrical coordinates where the integral is parameterized. This makes TB fast in exchange for diminished transferability. An ideal electronic structure method has both the efficiency of TB and the transferability of ab-initio methods. In this work, I expand the full crystal potential into multipoles where the resulting matrix elements are transformed into the form of 2CI between high angular momentum functions. The usual Slater-Koster formulae for TB are limited to $l\leq3$; to enable efficient evaluation of the full crystal potential 2CI, I derive a Wigner matrix based convolution algorithm (WMCA) that works for arbitrary angular momentum. Given a suitable method for generating a local ab-initio Kohn-Sham potential, the algorithm for calculating matrix elements is applicable to fully ab-initio LCAO methods (this is the subject of forthcoming work). In this paper, I apply the WMCA to silicon using a model crystal potential.

Title: Superconductivity of Incoherent Electrons near the Relativistic Mott Transition in Twisted Dirac Materials
Authors: Veronika C. Stangier, Mathias S. Scheurer, Daniel E. Sheehy, Jörg Schmalian
Abstract: We demonstrate that superconductivity driven by strong quantum-critical fluctuations can emerge near relativistic Mott transitions in twisted two-dimensional materials, taking on a remarkably rich character. In twisted double-bilayer WSe$_2$, all time-reversal-even, gap-opening collective modes promote pairing, whereas time-reversal-odd modes do not. In a Dirac model of twisted bilayer graphene, the Gross-Neveu transition into inter-valley-coherent insulators gives rise to a spectrum of degenerate and nearly degenerate superconducting states. More generally, we show that the richer the Dirac structure, the more readily pairs can form. A crucial ingredient of the theory is that critical fluctuations render the electronic states strongly incoherent, allowing attractive pairing channels to overcome the bare Dirac semi-metal behavior. Finally, we demonstrate a direct relation between boson-mediated pairing and the formation of charge-carrying skyrmionic excitations in the proximate insulating state.

Title: Beyond the non-Hermitian skin effect: scaling-controlled topology from Exceptional-Bound Bands
Authors: Mengjie Yang, Ching Hua Lee
Abstract: We establish a novel mechanism for topological transitions in non-Hermitian systems that are controlled by the system size. Based on a new paradigm known as exceptional-bound (EB) band engineering, its mechanism hinges on the unique critical scaling behavior near an exceptional point, totally unrelated to the well-known non-Hermitian skin effect. Through a series of ansatz models, we analytically derive and numerically demonstrate how topological transitions depend on the system size with increasingly sophisticated topological phase boundaries. Our approach can be generically applied to design scaling-dependent bands in multi-dimensional lattices, gapped or gapless, challenging established critical and entanglement behavior. It can be experimentally demonstrated in any non-Hermitian platform with versatile couplings or multi-orbital unit cells, such as photonic crystals, as well as classical and quantum circuits. The identification of this new EB band mechanism provides new design principles for engineering band structures through scaling-dependent phenomena unique to non-Hermitian systems.

Title: Predicting the future with magnons
Authors: Zeling Xiong, Christopher Heins, Thibaut Devolder, Fabian Kammerbauer, Mathias Kläui, Jürgen Fassbender, Helmut Schultheiss, Katrin Schultheiss
Abstract: Forecasting complex, chaotic signals is a central challenge across science and technology, with implications ranging from secure communications to climate modeling. Here we demonstrate that magnons - the collective spin excitations in magnetically ordered materials - can serve as an efficient physical reservoir for predicting such dynamics. Using a magnetic microdisk in the vortex state as a magnon-scattering reservoir, we show that intrinsic nonlinear interactions transform a simple microwave input into a high-dimensional spectral output suitable for reservoir computing, in particular, for time series predictions. Trained on the Mackey-Glass benchmark, which generates a cyclic yet aperiodic time series widely used to test machine-learning models, the system achieves accurate and reliable predictions that rival state-of-the-art physical reservoirs. We further identify key design principles: spectral resolution governs the trade-off between dimensionality and accuracy, while combining multiple device geometries systematically improves performance. These results establish magnonics as a promising platform for unconventional computing, offering a path toward scalable and CMOS-compatible hardware for real-time prediction tasks.

Title: Phase segregation of liquid-vapor systems with a gravitational field
Authors: A. Lamura
Abstract: Phase separation in the presence of external forces has attracted considerable attention since the initial works for solid mixtures. Despite this, only very few studies are available which address the segregation process of liquid-vapor systems under gravity. We present here an extensive study which takes into account both hydrodynamic and gravitational effects on the coarsening dynamics. An isothermal formulation of a lattice Boltzmann model for a liquid-vapor system with the van der Waals equation of state is adopted. In the absence of gravity, the growth of domains follows a power law with the exponent $2/3$ of the inertial regime. The external force deeply affects the observed morphology accelerating the coarsening of domains and favoring the liquid accumulation at the bottom of the system. Along the force direction, the growth exponent is found to increase with the gravity strength still preserving sharp interfaces since the Porod's law is found to be verified. The time evolution of the average thickness $L$ of the layers of accumulated material at confining walls shows a transition from an initial regime where $L \simeq t^{2/3}$ ($t$: time) to a late-time regime $L \simeq g t^{5/3}$ with $g$ the gravitational acceleration. The final steady state, made of two overlapped layers of liquid and vapor, shows a density profile in agreement with theoretical predictions.

Title: Enhancing Direct Air Capture through Potassium Carbonate Doping of Activated Carbons
Authors: N. van Dongen, A. J. F. van Hoof, S. Calero, J. M. Vicent-Luna
Abstract: Direct air capture of carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) is one of the most promising strategies to mitigate rising atmospheric CO$_2$ levels. Among various techniques, adsorption using porous materials is a viable method for extracting CO$_2$ from air, even under humid conditions. However, identifying optimal adsorbent materials remains a significant challenge. Moreover, the performance of existing materials can be improved by doping with active species that boost gas capture, a relatively unexplored field. In this study, we perform atomistic simulations to investigate the adsorption, structural, and energetic properties of CO$_2$ and water in realistic models of activated carbons. We first analyze the impact of explicitly considering surfaces containing functional groups, which aims to imitate the chemical environment of experimental samples. Additionally, we introduce potassium carbonate within the pores of the adsorbent to evaluate its effect on CO$_2$ and water adsorption. Our results demonstrate that both functional groups and potassium carbonate enhance adsorption, primarily by shifting the adsorption onset pressures to lower values. Specifically, potassium carbonate clusters act as extra adsorption sites for CO$_2$ and water, facilitating the nucleation of water molecules and promoting the formation of a hydrogen bond network within the activated carbon pores.

Title: Multihyperuniform Particle Composites Inspired by Avian Photoreceptor Patterns for Optical Applications
Authors: David Keeney, Wenlong Shi, Rohit Thomas, Yang Jiao
Abstract: Hyperuniform materials, characterized by anomalously suppressed long-wavelength density fluctuations, exhibit unique optical and photonic properties distinct from both crystalline and random media. While most prior studies have focused on single-species systems, we investigate the broader class of \textit{multihyperuniform} systems inspired by biological photoreceptor mosaics. Using particle-based models with varying species number, size ratios, and interaction competition, we demonstrate that multispecies mixtures can achieve robust and stealthy hyperuniform configurations, even in highly disordered states. We further show how these configurations can be mapped to multifunctional composites with tailored optical responses, including isotropic structural coloration, enhanced absorption, and engineered dielectric properties that facilitate transmission while suppressing scattering. Our results highlight multihyperuniformity as a generalizable design principle for multifunctional disordered photonic materials, opening avenues for robust, tunable, and scalable optical applications.

Title: Emergence of multiple relaxation processes during low to high density transition in Au49Cu26.9Si16.3Ag5.5Pd2.3 metallic glass
Authors: Alberto Ronca, Antoine Cornet, Jie Shen, Thierry Deschamps, Eloi Pineda, Yuriy Chushkin, Federico Zontone, Mohamed Mezouar, Isabella Gallino, Gaston Garbarino, Beatrice Ruta
Abstract: The existence of multiple amorphous states, or polyamorphism, remains one of the most debated phenomena in disordered matter, particularly regarding its microscopic origin and impact on glassy dynamics. Profiting of the enhanced data quality provided by brilliant synchrotrons, we combined high pressure X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction to investigate the atomic dynamics-structure relationship in a Au49Cu26.9Si16.3Ag5.5Pd2.3 metallic glass at room temperature. We identify a structural and dynamical crossover near 3 GPa, marked by avalanches-like massive atomic rearrangements that promote the system toward increasingly compact atomic cluster connections. This crossover superimposes to a pressure-induced acceleration of the atomic motion recently reported, and signals the onset of a transitional state, potentially linked to the nucleation of a new phase within the glass, characterized by the coexistence of two amorphous states with distinct relaxation processes. These results provide evidence for a sluggish, continuous polyamorphic transformation, even in absence of marked structural discontinuities.

Title: Fully Parallel Multi-Agent Photonic Optimizer
Authors: Ghazi Sarwat Syed, Philipp Schmidt, Frank Brückerhoff-Plückelmann, Jelle Dijkstra, Wolfram H.P Pernice, Abu Sebastian
Abstract: Optimization problems are central to many important cross-disciplinary this http URL their conventional implementations, the sequential nature of operations imposes strict limitations on the computational efficiency. Here, we discuss how analog optical computing can overcome this fundamental bottleneck. We propose a photonic optimizer unit, together with supporting algorithms that uses in memory computation within a nature inspired, multi agent cooperative framework. The system performs a sequence of reconfigurable parallel matrix vector operations, enabled by the high bandwidth and multiplexing capabilities inherent to photonic circuits. This approach provides a pathway toward fast paced and high quality solutions for difficult optimization and search problems.

Title: Hund's coupling assisted orbital-selective superconductivity in Ba1-xKxFe2As2
Authors: Elena Corbae, Rong Zhang, Cong Li, Kunihiro Kihou, Chul-Ho Lee, Makoto Hashimoto, Thomas Devereaux, Oscar Tjernberg, Egor Babaev, Dung-Hai Lee, Vadim Grinenko, Donghui Lu, Zhi-Xun Shen
Abstract: While the superconducting transition temperature of hole-doped Ba_{1-x}K_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2} decreases past optimal doping, superconductivity does not completely disappear even for the fully doped KFe_{2}As_{2} compound. In fact, superconductivity is robust through a Lifshitz transition where electron bands become hole-like around the zone corner at around x=0.7, thus challenging the conventional understanding of superconductivity in iron-based systems. High-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy is used to investigate the superconducting gap structure, as well as the normal state electronic structure, around optimal doping and across the Lifshitz transition. Our findings reveal a largely orbital-dependent superconducting gap structure, where the more strongly correlated d_{xy} band has a vanishing superconducting gap at higher doping, aligning with the Hund's metal behavior observed in the normal state. Notably, the superconducting gap on the d_{xy} band disappears before the Lifshitz transition, suggesting that the Fermi surface topology may play a secondary role. We discuss how these results point to orbital-selective superconducting pairing and how strong correlations via Hund's coupling may shape superconducting gap structures in iron-based and other multiorbital superconductors.

Title: Many-Body Effects in a Molecular Quantum NAND Tree
Authors: Justin P. Bergfield
Abstract: Molecules provide the smallest possible circuits in which quantum interference and electron correlation can be engineered to perform logical operations, including the universal NAND gate. We investigate a chemically encoded quantum NAND tree based on alkynyl-extended iso-polyacetylene backbones, where inputs are set by end-group substitution and outputs are read from the presence or absence of transmission nodes. Using quantum many-body transport theory, we show that NAND behavior persists in the presence of dynamic correlations, but that the nodal positions and their chemical shifts depend sensitively on electron-electron interactions. This sensitivity highlights the potential of these systems not only to probe the strength of electronic correlations but also to harness them in shaping logical response. The thermopower is identified as a chemically robust readout of gate logic, providing discrimination margins that greatly exceed typical experimental uncertainties, in an observable governed primarily by the variation of transport rather than its absolute magnitude.

Title: Phonon Hall Viscosity and the Intrinsic Thermal Hall Effect of $α$-RuCl$_3$
Authors: Avi Shragai, Ezekiel Horsley, Subin Kim, Young-June Kim, B.J. Ramshaw
Abstract: The thermal Hall effect has been observed in a wide variety of magnetic insulators, yet its origin remains controversial. While some studies attribute it to intrinsic origins -- such as heat carriers with Berry curvature -- others propose extrinsic origins -- such as heat carriers scattering off crystal defects. Even the nature of the heat carriers is unknown: magnons, phonons, and fractionalized spin excitations have all been proposed. These questions are significant for the study of quantum spin liquids and are particularly relevant for $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, where a quantized thermal Hall effect has been attributed to Majorana edge modes. Here, we use ultrasonic measurements of the acoustic Faraday effect to demonstrate that the phonons in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ have Hall viscosity -- a non-dissipative viscosity that rotates phonon polarizations and deflects phonon heat currents. We show that phonon Hall viscosity produces an intrinsic thermal Hall effect that quantitatively accounts for a significant fraction of the measured thermal Hall effect in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. More broadly, we demonstrate that the acoustic Faraday effect is a powerful tool for detecting phonon Hall viscosity and the associated phonon Berry curvature, offering a new way to uncover and study exotic states of matter that elude conventional experiments.

Title: Synthesis and Characterization of Ultrasonically Atomized Al-Based Alloy Powders for Tunable Thermal Reactivity
Authors: Chetan Singh, Ava Goglia, Peter Mastracco, Michael Flickinger, Laszlo J. Kecskes, Paulette Clancy, Timothy P. Weihs
Abstract: Reactive aluminum (Al) alloy powders are promising for advanced manufacturing, joining, and energetic applications, yet scalable routes that couple controlled reactivity with safe handling remain limited. While nanoscale Al powders ignite readily, their agglomeration, handling, and safety limit broad deployment. Here, we manufacture micron-sized Al-based powders produced by ultrasonic atomization (UA), targeting a balance of enhanced reactivity and process robustness. Binary systems (AlCu, AlSi, AlMg) and pure Al were synthesized, and their morphology, phases present, thermal stability, and oxidation behavior were characterized using XRD, SEM, and DTA/TGA in an Ar/O2 environment. We show that alloy selection and UA-controlled microstructure can modify the native Al2O3 passivation, alter oxidation pathways, and shift thermal onsets/exotherms. The results establish a manufacturing-forward framework for designing micron-sized powders with tunable ignition/oxidation behavior.

Title: Kekulé Superconductivity in Twisted Magic Angle Bilayer Graphene
Authors: Ke Wang, K. Levin
Abstract: Motivated by recent scanning tunneling microscopy experiments which report Kekulé ordering in the twisted graphene family, we develop a microscopic theory of superconductivity, specifically for the bi-layer case. This involves an intra-valley, finite-momentum pair-density wave (PDW) which naturally incorporates a Kekulé distortion into the superconducting phase. The PDW state displays three central features: (i) it spontaneously breaks $C_3$ rotational symmetry, producing nematic order, and (ii) it possesses a large gap-to-critical-temperature ratio. Moreover, (iii) it yields a quasi-particle density of states having a V-like shape (with a finite value at zero energy) which transitions to a fully gapped, U-shaped spectrum with increasing attraction. These characteristics, including consistency with an allowed Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition, align with key experimental signatures in the twisted graphene family where the U-V transition is observed in the tri-layer case. We find the paired state with a modest interaction strength is near to a BEC-like regime, as appears consistent with the observed extremely short coherence lengths. Together, these results establish a microscopic intra-valley Kekulé PDW state as an essential ingredient towards understanding unconventional superconductivity in twisted graphene.

Title: Mechanistic insights into hydrogen reduction of multicomponent oxides via in-situ high-energy X-ray diffraction
Authors: Shiv Shankar, Barak Ratzker, Claudio Pistidda, Dierk Raabe, Yan Ma
Abstract: Co-reduction of multicomponent oxides with hydrogen provides a carbon-neutral approach toward sustainable alloy design. Herein, we investigate the hydrogen-based direct reduction, using in-situ high-energy X-ray diffraction of two precursor variants: mechanically mixed powders and pre-sintered oxide mixtures, targeting an equiatomic CoFeMnNi alloy. We find distinct reduction pathways and microstructure evolution depending on initial precursors. Mixed powders at 700 °C are reduced to body-centered-cubic, face-centered-cubic, and MnO phases via halite, spinel, and Mn3O4 intermediates, whereas the pre-sintered material directly transforms into a mixture of metallic and oxide phases. The post-reduction microstructures are also different: mixed oxides show loosely packed morphology, whereas pre-sintered material reveals metallic nanoparticles supported on nanoporous MnO. The formation of nanoporous metallic networks is strongly governed by the precursor state, highlighting the role of initial precursors on the final microstructure. This precursor design strategy offers a single-step route to nanoporous alloys with potential applications in catalysis and energy technologies.

Title: Local Order Average-Atom Interatomic Potentials
Authors: Chloe A. Zeller, Ronald E. Miller, Ellad B. Tadmor
Abstract: An extension to the effective average-atom (AA) interatomic potential (IP) that accounts for local ordering effects is derived. While the AA approach is only valid for random alloys, the new local-order average-atom (LOAA) IP accounts for short-range order within a material by utilizing information from partial radial distribution functions. Simulations with a LOAA potential require smaller system sizes to achieve statistically converged results and therefore can be used to model complex materials where short-range order effects are important, such as high-entropy alloys, at a fraction of the computational cost of standard IPs. The method is validated for a two-dimensional (2D) binary hexagonal crystal with Lennard-Jones (LJ) interactions, and for three-dimensional (3D) Fe$_{(1-x)/2}$Ni$_{(1-x)/2}$Cr$_x$ and Ni$_{0.67}$Al$_{0.33}$ alloys modeled via embedded-atom method (EAM) potentials. For the 2D crystal we obtain a local ordering phase diagram in terms of the LJ parameters and demonstrate that in all cases the LOAA formulation obtains elastic properties that match the true-species case using standard IPs. The 3D alloy examples further demonstrate the ability of this method to accurately capture other material properties and phase transformations.

Title: Tunable magnon-phonon cavity via structural phase transition
Authors: Chunli Tang, Yujie Zhu, Dayne Sasaki, Jiaxuan Wu, Harshil Goyal, Yuzan Xiong, Masoud Mahjouri-Samani, Xiang Meng, Jia-Mian Hu, Yayoi Takamura, Wei Zhang, Wencan Jin
Abstract: Strong coupling between two quantized excitations in a cavity has the potential to lead to hybridized states that bestow novel quantum phenomena as required for emerging applications. In particular, tunable hybrid magnon-phonon cavities with precise control knobs are in pressing demand for developing quantum functionalities in solid-state platforms. Here, using a combination of synthesis and characterization tools, we present an epitaxial La0.7Sr0.3MnO3/SrTiO3 (LSMO/STO) heterostructure that manifests strong couplings between the Kittel magnon and the transverse acoustic phonon. Remarkably, leveraging the magnetoelastic interaction at the epitaxial interface, we demonstrate that when the STO substrate undergoes a cubic-to-tetragonal phase transition at ~105 K, the Kittel magnon of the LSMO thin film splits into three bands due to anisotropic structural strains along the [100], [010], and [001] crystalline axes, hence, resulting in an array of non-degenerate, hybridized magnon-phonon modes. Moreover, we develop an analytical model that can reproduce the interfacial strain-induced magnon splitting and the strength of magnon-phonon coupling. Our work highlights structural phase transitions as a sensitive trigger for generating multistate magnon-phonon hybridization in high-quality magnetoelastic oxide heterostructures - a new route for implementing strain-mediated hybrid magnonics in phononic systems with potential applications in coherent energy and signal transduction.

Title: High temperature Neel skyrmions in simple ferromagnets

Abstract: A wide variety of chiral non-collinear spin textures have been discovered and have unique properties that make them highly interesting for technological applications. However, many of these are found in complex materials and only in a narrow window of temperature. Here, we show the formation of Neel-type skyrmions in thin layers of simple ferromagnetic alloys, namely Co-Al and Co-Ni-Al, over a wide range of temperature up to 770 K, by imposing a vertical strain gradient via epitaxy with an Ir-Al underlayer. The Neel skyrmions are directly observed using Lorentz transmission electron microscopy in freestanding membranes at high temperatures and the strain gradient is directly measured from x-ray diffraction anomalous peak profiles. Our concept allows simple centrosymmetric ferromagnets with high magnetic ordering temperatures to exhibit hot skyrmions, thereby, bringing closer skyrmionic electronics.

Title: Probing the elusive equilibrium crystal/liquid coexistence state in monodisperse hard-sphere colloids simulations
Authors: J. Galen Wang, Umesh Dhumal, Monica E. A. Zakhari, Roseanna N. Zia
Abstract: Entropically driven phase transitions in atomic and colloidal systems of monodisperse, purely repulsive hard spheres (MPRHS) are long-established in terms of distinct phases and phase envelopes via theory, simulations, and experiments. Frenkel proposed a mechanistic model for entropic phase separation in MPRHS, which lack obvious sources of competing entropy. He proposed that loss of long-range (configurational) entropy is offset by gain of short-range (vibrational) entropy - but its metastability would require hundreds of millions of years to phase separate. True to Frenkel's prediction, despite copious reports of liquid and solid lines, theoretical deduction of coexistence lines, and experimentally observed phase separation, decades of simulations built to match MPRHS atomic theory show no observation of explicit, spontaneously-formed liquid and crystal domains - transient mixtures have been observed but are subsequently overtaken by a single phase. To observe finite-time phase separation, we simulated weak perturbations of metastability in a large simulation of MPRHS: crystal seeding (2-4%) and hardness perturbations that augment short-range arrangements. Our simulations produced explicit phase separation and, as hardness was systematically increased toward the hard-sphere limit, recovered phase and coexistence lines close to atomic theory. To more closely mimic Frenkel's mechanistic model, we tested hardness perturbations alone. Samples with no crystal seeding and tiny hardness perturbation spontaneously phase separated in a narrower range of volume fractions. The near-pristine conditions emphasize MPRHS coexistence region metastability, and perturbations to short-range entropy via finite hardness provide satisfying access to the long range / short range entropy exchange competition underlying MPRHS phase separation.

Title: Application of deep neural networks for computing the renormalization group flow of the two-dimensional phi^4 field theory
Authors: Yueqi Zhao, Michael M. Fogler, Yi-Zhuang You
Abstract: We introduce RGFlow, a deep neural network-based real-space renormalization group (RG) framework tailored for continuum scalar field theories. Leveraging generative capabilities of flow-based neural networks, RGFlow autonomously learns real-space RG transformations from data without prior knowledge of the underlying model. In contrast to conventional approaches, RGFlow is bijective (information-preserving) and is optimized based on the principle of minimal mutual information. We demonstrate the method on two examples. The first one is a one-dimensional Gaussian model, where RGFlow is shown to learn the classical decimation rule. The second is the two-dimensional phi^4 theory, where the network successfully identifies a Wilson-Fisher-like critical point and provides an estimate of the correlation-length critical exponent.

Title: Real-Space Quantification of Exciton Localization in Acene Crystals Using Wannier Function Decomposition
Authors: Zui Tao, Jonah B. Haber, Jeffrey B. Neaton
Abstract: We introduce the Wannier function decomposition of excitons (WFDX) method to quantify exciton localization in solids within the ab initio Bethe-Salpeter equation framework. By decomposing each Bloch exciton wavefunction into products of single-particle electron and hole maximally localized Wannier functions, this real-space approach provides well-defined orbital- and spatial- resolved measures of both Frenkel and charge-transfer excitons at low computational cost. We apply WFDX to excitons in acene crystals, quantifying how the number of rings, the exciton spin state, and the center-of-mass momntum affect spatial localization. Additionally, we show how this real-space representation reflects structural nonsymmorphic symmetries that are hidden in standard reciprocal-space descriptions. We demonstrate how the WFDX framework can be used to efficiently interpolate exciton expansion coefficients in reciprocal-space and outline how it may facilitate evaluation of observables involving position operators, highlighting its potential as a general tool for both analyzing and computing excitonic properties in solids.

Title: Twisted locality-preserving automorphisms, anomaly index, and generalized Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorems with anti-unitary symmetries
Authors: Ruizhi Liu, Jinmin Yi, Liujun Zou
Abstract: Symmetries and their anomalies are powerful tools to understand quantum matter. In this work, for quantum spin chains, we define twisted locality-preserving automorphisms and their Gross-Nesme-Vogts-Werner indices, which provide a unified framework to describe both unitary and anti-unitary symmetries, on-site and non-on-site symmetries, and internal and translation symmetries. For a symmetry $G$ with actions given by twisted locality-preserving automorphisms, we give a microscopic definition of its anomaly index, which is an element in $H^3_\varphi(G; U(1))$, where the subscript $\varphi$ means that anti-unitary elements of $G$ act on $U(1)$ by complex conjugation. We show that an anomalous symmetry leads to multiple Lieb-Schultz-Matttis-type theorems. In particular, any state with an anomalous symmetry must either have long-range correlation or violate the entanglement area law. Based on this theorem, we further deduce that any state with an anomalous symmetry must have long-range entanglement, and any Hamiltonian that has an anomalous symmetry cannot have a unique gapped symmetric ground state, as long as the interactions in the Hamiltonian decay fast enough as the range of the interaction increases. For Hamiltonians with only two-spin interactions, the last theorem holds if the interactions decay faster than $1/r^2$, where $r$ is the distance between the two interacting spins. We demonstrate these general theorems in various concrete examples.

Title: Recurrence in a periodically driven and weakly damped Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou chain
Authors: Yujun Shi, Haijiang Ren
Abstract: We report numerical evidence of Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT)-like recurrence in weakly damped, periodically driven alpha-FPUT chains. In narrow regions of driving amplitude and damping, energy is quasi-periodically exchanged among a few low-frequency modes over long timescales. Unlike discrete time crystals, the recurrence period is not an integer multiple of the driving period and does not correspond to spontaneous symmetry breaking, yet it may suggests a generalized, relaxed form of time-crystalline-like order. The maximum damping allowing recurrence decreases rapidly with chain length, suggesting that in the thermodynamic limit such behavior is unlikely to persist. These results reveal a new type of coherent nonlinear dynamics in driven, open multimode systems and provide guidance for experimentally realizing long-lived quasi-periodic states.

Title: Topological Hall Effect in PrSb$_2$
Authors: Shingo Araki, Hinata Izumida, Kazuto Akiba, Tatsuo C. Kobayashi, Takashi Kambe
Abstract: PrSb$_2$ exhibits a charge-density wave (CDW) transition at $T_\mathrm{CDW} = 100$ K and antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering at $T_\mathrm{N} = 5$ K at ambient pressure. Hall resistivity measurements revealed an anomalous feature within the AFM state, which was attributed to the topological Hall effect (THE), ruling out contributions from the ordinary and anomalous Hall effects. Significantly, the THE anomaly diminished with increasing pressure and almost vanished as the CDW transition was suppressed near the critical pressure $P_c$ = 1.0 GPa. These findings suggest a relationship between the CDW order and the appearance of the THE in PrSb$_2$.

Title: Nonlinear Optical Response in Pseudo-Hermitian Systems at Steady State
Authors: S. Sajad Dabiri, Reza Asgari
Abstract: We establish a steady-state theory for nonlinear optical conductivity in pseudo-Hermitian systems. We derive compact formulas for the first and second order conductivity tensors in both the velocity and length gauges and prove their exact equivalence through generalized sum rules and Berry connection identities by formulating the nonlinear response in terms of a biorthogonal density matrix. Utilizing the formalism on parity-time symmetric two-level systems reveals nonlinear phenomena that are not present in Hermitian systems, such as extra terms in the conductivity, corrections to the velocity operator, photocurrent, and resonance structures with higher-order poles at one-photon transitions. These features yield qualitatively distinct harmonic generation responses like real second-order conductivities and nonzero DC limits. These results provide new insights into nonlinear light-matter interactions in active media characterized by balanced gain and loss, with implications for non-Hermitian photonics, dissipative topological systems, and quantum devices designed with engineered dissipation.

Title: Interband optical conductivity in two-dimensional semi-Dirac bands tilting along the quadratic dispersion
Authors: Xin Chen, Jian-Tong Hou, Long Liang, Jie Lu, Hong Guo, Chang-Xu Yan, Hao-Ran Chang
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) semi-Dirac materials feature a unique anisotropic band structure characterized by quadratic dispersion along one spatial direction and linear dispersion along the other, effectively hybridizing ordinary and Dirac fermions. The anisotropy of energy dispersion can be further modulated through band tilting along either spatial direction of the wave vector. We propose a new definition of tilt parameter to characterize Lifshitz phases in 2D semi-Dirac bands tilting along the quadratically dispersing direction. Using linear response theory, we theoretically investigate the interband optical conductivity of 2D tilted semi-Dirac bands. Our analytical zero-temperature results reveal pronounced distinctions from Dirac and semi-Dirac systems tilting along the linearly dispersing direction. Notably, we find that spectral fixed point emerges in the optical conductivity over a specific range of the tilt parameter, a phenomenon explained by the corresponding behavior of the joint density of states. These findings provide a robust theoretical framework for identifying and characterizing 2D tilted semi-Dirac materials and establish clear spectral fingerprints that distinguish different kinds of 2D semi-Dirac bands and Dirac bands. Our predictions can guide future experimental studies of anisotropic band engineering and tilt-dependent phenomena.

Title: Intrinsic ultrafast edge photocurrent dynamics in WTe$_2$ driven by broken crystal symmetry
Authors: Subhashri Chatterjee, Katsumasa Yoshioka, Taro Wakamura, Vasili Perebeinos, Norio Kumada
Abstract: Directional photocurrents in two-dimensional materials arise from broken crystal symmetry, offering pathways to high-speed, bias-free photodetection beyond conventional devices. Tungsten ditelluride (WTe$_2$), a type-II Weyl semimetal, exhibits robust symmetry-breaking-induced edge photocurrents from competing nonlinear optical and photothermoelectric (PTE) mechanisms, whose intrinsic dynamics have remained experimentally inaccessible. Here, we directly resolve sub-picosecond edge photocurrent dynamics in WTe$_2$ through ohmic contacts over temperatures from 300 K to 4 K. We demonstrate ultrafast optical-to-electrical conversion with a 3 dB bandwidth of $\sim$250 GHz and reveal picosecond-timescale switching of the net photocurrent direction below 150 K, linked to a Lifshitz transition. This transient bipolar response arises from non-equilibrium Seebeck effects due to asymmetric cooling of hot electrons and holes. These findings reveal previously hidden ultrafast dynamics in symmetry-engineered materials, offering new strategies to disentangle competing photocurrent mechanisms and enabling the development of self-powered, ultrafast optoelectronic devices.

Abstract: Total of twelve samples in the U-La-O system with the compositions U1-yLayO2+x (y=0.025, 0.05, 0.1, up to 0.3) were synthesized by gel combustion synthesis method followed by appropriate heat treatment in air atmosphere. Comprehensive experimental analysis using various techniques like X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetry and oxygen to uranium ratio (O/U) are used to establish the phase relation in U1-yLayO2+x system at 1173 K and 1523 K heated in air. A novel meta-stable phase with stoichiometry La3U11O36 having mixed-valent uranium is reported for the first time in U-La-O system. The thermal property of this new phase is reported along with the updated phase relations at and above 1173 K temperature for the compositions U1-yLayO2+x (y < 0.3). Further, formation and stability of this new Ln3U11O36 phase was also investigated with smaller cations like Nd3+, Sm3+, Gd3+ and the smallest Y3+ cation.

Title: Anomalous Criticality of Absorbing State Transition toward Jamming
Authors: He-Da Wang, Bo Wang, Qun-Li Lei, Yu-Qiang Ma
Abstract: The jamming transition is traditionally regarded as a geometric transition governed by static contact networks. Recently, dynamic phase transitions of athermal particles under periodic shear provide a new lens on this problem, leading to a conjecture that jamming transition corresponds to an absorbing-state transition within the Manna (conserved directed percolation) universality class. Here, by re-examing the biased random organization model, a minimal model for particles under periodic shearing that the conjecture bases on, we uncover several criticality anomalies at high density beyond the description of Manna universality class. In three-dimensional monodisperse systems, crystallization disrupts the absorbing transition, while in dense binary mixtures, a distinct transition from absorbing to active-glass states emerges, signifying a new universality class of dynamic phase transitions. Closer to jamming point, the quenched heterogeneity in the contact network smears the dynamic transition via Griffiths effects and drives the system toward heterogeneous directed percolation. We further proposal a field theory with fractional time dynamics that unifies these phenomena, establishing a theoretical framework linking jamming, disorder, and dynamic criticality.

Title: Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless quantum transition in 2 dimensions
Authors: M. C. Diamantini, C. A. Trugenberger, V. M. Vinokur
Abstract: The Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition is the prototype of a phase transition driven by the formation and interaction of topological defects in two-dimensional (2D) systems. In typical models these are vortices: above a transition temperature $T_{\rm BKT}$ vortices are free, below this transition temperature they get confined. In this work we extend the concept of BKT transition to quantum systems in two dimensions. In particular, we demonstrate that a zero-temperature quantum BKT phase transition, driven by a coupling constant can occur in 2D models governed by an effective gauge field theory with a diverging dielectric constant. One particular example is that of a compact U(1) gauge theory with a diverging dielectric constant, where the quantum BKT transition is induced by non-relativistic, purely 2D magnetic monopoles, which can be viewed also as electric vortices. These quantum BKT transitions have the same diverging exponent $z$ as the quantum Griffiths transition but have nothing to do with disorder.

Title: Quasiparticle Description of Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy for SrCuO2
Authors: Dimitar Pashov, Casey Eichstaedt, Swagata Acharya, Mark van Schilfgaarde
Abstract: SrCuO2 has long been considered a near-archetypal realization of a quasi one dimensional (1D) system of interacting electrons with short-range interactions. Within this framework, experimental observations - interpreted through the lens of the 1D Hubbard model-suggest that electron and hole excitations decay into two types of (unphysical) collective bosonic modes: spinons, which carry the spin degree of freedom, and holons, which carry the charge degree of freedom. This model, known as spin-charge separation, is most directly evidenced by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), where a photo-induced hole decays into a continuum of these excitations. Here we present an alternative perspective grounded in first-principles, self-consistent, and parameter-free many-body perturbation theory. In this revised quasiparticle framework, ARPES can be understood as a one-body effect arising from mild disorder in a long-range antiferromagnetic ground state. the emergence of the so-called spinon branch arises naturally from spin disorder, the anomalous line widths are accurately captured, and we provide a compelling explanation for the spectral weight observed at the non-magnetic zone boundary. This reinterpretation provides a unified explanation for key experimental signatures previously attributed to spin-charge separation, including features observed in optical conductivity. Additionally, we show that SrCuO2 exhibits a nontrivial interchain coupling that significantly influences both its one-particle and two-particle spectral functions. By comparing the spectral features of SrCuO2 with those of La2CuO4, we argue that SrCuO2 shares notable similarities with the two-dimensional cuprates - both being rooted in a common CuO4 plaquette-based molecular orbital framework.

Title: SAOS and LAOS rheology for differentiating chemical and physical crosslinking: A case study on PVA hydrogels
Authors: David Kogan, Moshe Gottlieb
Abstract: In this work, we have studied the viscoelastic behavior of chemically and physically crosslinked Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hydrogels near the critical gel point (GP) as well as further away from it, by means of small amplitude (SAOS) and large amplitude (LAOS) oscillatory shear experiments. Chemical crosslinking involved covalent bonding by means of glutaraldehyde as a crosslinker, while physical crosslinking was induced by freeze-thaw cycles. SAOS data analysis allowed evaluation of critical parameters such as the critical relaxation exponent n, gel strength S, and equilibrium modulus Ge, based on the dynamic self-similarity and fractal network structures at the GP. LAOS rheological data analysis showed that the chemically crosslinked system exhibited moderate strain-dependance due to the permanent covalent bonds, whereas the physically crosslinked system displayed significant strain-dependent nonlinearity due to strain dependent interactions at the crosslink entities. LAOS experiments, supported by Chebyshev coefficients and Lissajous-Bowditch plots, highlighted pronounced differences in nonlinear responses, underscoring the influence of crosslinking mechanisms on the network rheological behavior. The findings establish LAOS as a powerful tool for differentiating polymeric network structures, providing insights beyond those attained by conventional linear rheology. 50 pages 1 figures

Title: Modular Reactor for In Situ X-ray Scattering, Spectroscopy, and ATR-IR Studies of Solvothermal Nanoparticle Synthesis
Authors: Sani Y. Harouna-Mayer, Melike Gumus Akcaalan, Jagadesh Kopula Kesavan, Tjark R. L. Groene, Lars Klemeyer, Sarah-Alexandra Hussak, Lukas Grote, a Davide Derelli, Francesco Caddeo, Cecilia Zito, Paul Stützle, Dorota Speer, Ann-Christin Dippel, Blanka Detlefs, Yannik Appiarius, Axel Jacobi von Wangelin, Dorota Koziej
Abstract: Understanding the chemical processes that occur during the solvothermal synthesis of functional nanomaterials is essential for their rational design and optimization for specific applications. However, these processes remain poorly understood, primarily due to the limitations of conventional ex situ characterization techniques and the technical challenges associated with in situ studies, particularly the design and implementation of suitable reactors. Here, we present a versatile cell suitable for in situ X-ray scattering, X-ray spectroscopy, and infrared spectroscopy studies performed during solvothermal synthesis under autoclave-like, inert conditions. The reactor enables precise control of the temperature between -20 C and 200 C, pressures up to 8 bar, magnetic stirring, and injection of gas or liquids. The reactor's capabilities are demonstrated by comprehensively studying the solvothermal synthesis of magnetite nanoparticles from iron acetylacetonate in benzyl alcohol through in situ X-ray scattering and spectroscopy, and ATR-IR spectroscopy.

Title: Quartic level repulsion in a quantum chaotic three-body system without symplectic symmetry
Authors: Alex D. Kerin, Barbara Dietz, Joachim Brand
Abstract: Among the fundamental symmetry classes of quantum chaotic systems in Dyson's threefold way, the symplectic class is rarely observed in nature. Characterized by the strongest possible level repulsion in the energy spectrum, the symplectic symmetry class also implies a double (Kramers) degeneracy of levels. Studying the spectral statistics of three quantum particles (identical bosons or mass-imbalanced fermions) in a harmonic trap, we find numerical evidence for strong level repulsion in the regime of weak contact interactions. While the statistical indicators are consistent with quantum chaos in systems with symplectic symmetry, the absence of Kramers degeneracy rules out this symmetry. In the strongly-interacting unitary limit either Poissonian or stick statistics are observed (depending on commensurability of the mass ratio) indicating regular dynamics.

Title: Tuning pair interactions in colloidal systems using random light fields
Authors: Augustin Muster, Diego Romero Abujetas, Frank Scheffold, Luis S. Froufe-Pérez
Abstract: We propose a method to tune interactions between absorptionless colloidal particle pairs. This is achieved via optimization of the spectral energy density of a homogeneous random optical field. Several standard and more exotic interaction potentials, as well as their negative counterparts, are shown to be successfully tuned. We show that the effective dimensionality of the space of potential functions that can be created by this means can reach up to several tens.

Title: Comparison of typicality in quantum and classical many-body systems
Authors: Peter Reimann, Nicolas Nessi
Abstract: Quantum typicality refers to the phenomenon that the expectation values of any given observable are nearly identical for the overwhelming majority of all normalized vectors in a sufficiently high-dimensional Hilbert (sub-)space. As a consequence, we show that the thermal equilibrium fluctuations in many-body quantum systems can be very closely imitated by the purely quantum mechanical uncertainties (quantum fluctuations) of suitably chosen pure states. On the other hand, we find that analogous typicality effects of similar generality are not encountered in classical systems. The reason is that the basic mathematical structure, in particular the description of pure states, is fundamentally different in quantum and classical mechanics.

Title: Ground state magnetic structure of Mn3Sn

Abstract: We use spherical neutron polarimetry to determine the ground state magnetic structure of Mn3Sn. We find that Mn3Sn adopts an inverse triangular structure with spins parallel to <100> (Type III) rather than spins parallel to <110> (Type IV). Density functional theory calculations reveal no energy difference between these two structures, suggesting that the selection is caused by subtle effects such as sixth-order anisotropy. Partial control of the magnetic domain population through a moderate magnetic field is key to distinguish between the two models. We find that three of the six domains are approximately equally populated, while the others have negligible population. Upon entering the low temperature incommensurate phase, the domain structure is lost. The domains decouple from the magnetic field, and can therefore not be controlled by any known method.

Title: Thermodynamics of data
Authors: Borko Stosic
Abstract: The recently introduced concept of generalized thermodynamics is explored here in the context of 1d, 2d and 3d data analysis, performed on samples drawn from a 3d X-ray soil sample image. Different threshold levels are used to binarize the 3d sample, wherefrom relative frequencies of binary patterns are found and then used to address finite size scaling behavior of the response functions as a function of the disorder parameter (equivalent of temperature in thermodynamics). It is found that for different threshold levels response functions for increasing sample sizes approach the thermodynamic limit from different directions, with a crossover reminiscent of a transition from open to periodic boundaries of the Ising model, implying existence of a characteristic correlation scale. It is argued here that this characteristic scale corresponds to the "natural" properties of the data, where correlations within finite size samples are neither underestimated nor overestimated. In the current context of soil this scale may be related to the so-called Representative elementary volume (REV), while in other situations this characteristic scale should be interpreted in the context of the phenomenon under study.

Title: The Hidden Wheel-Within
Authors: Falko Ziebert, Igor M. Kulić
Abstract: There is this old, eternal question: Why don't animals have wheels? In this perspective we show that they actually do. And they do so in a physically extraordinary way -- by combining incompatible elasticity, differential geometry and dissipative self-organization. Nature's wheel -- the ``wheel-within'' -- has been mysteriously concealed in plain sight, yet it spins in virtually every slender-body organism: in falling cats, crocodilians spinning to subdue their prey, rolling fruit-fly larvae, circumnutating plants and even in some of our own body movements. Flying somehow under the radar of our cognition, in recent years the wheel-within also tacitly entered the field of soft robotics, finally opening our eyes for its ubiquitous role in Nature. We here identify its underlying physical ingredients, namely the existence of a neutrally-stable, shape-invariant and actively driven elastic mode. We then reflect on various man-made realizations of the wheel-within and outline where it could be spinning from here.

Title: Signatures of broken symmetries in the excitations of a periodic 2DEG coupled to a cylindrical photon cavity
Authors: Vidar Gudmundsson, Vram Mughnetsyan, Hsi-Sheng Goan, Jeng-Da Chai, Nzar Rauf Abdullah, Chi-Shung Tang, Wen-Hsuan Kuan, Valeriu Moldoveanu, Andrei Manolescu
Abstract: In a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in a periodic lateral superlattice subjected to an external homogeneous magnetic field and in a cylindrical far-infrared photon cavity we search for effects of broken symmetries: Static ones, stemming from the unit cell of the system, and the external magnetic field together with the dynamic ones caused by the vector potential of the cavity promoting magnetic types of transitions, and the chirality of the excitation pulse. The Coulomb interaction of the electrons is described within density functional theory, but the electron-photon interactions are handled by a configuration interaction formalism within each step of the density functional approach, both for the static and the dynamic system. In the dynamical calculations we observe weak chiral effects that change character as the strength of the electron-photon interaction and the external magnetic field are increased. From the analysis of the chiral effects we identify an important connection of the para- and diamagnetic electron-photon interactions that promotes the diamagnetic interaction in the present system when the interaction strength is increased. Furthermore, the asymmetric potential in the unit cell of the square array activates collective oscillation modes that are not present in the system when the unit cell has a higher symmetry.

Title: Computational Study on the Physical Properties and Hydrogen Storage Capability of Insulating LaMg2H7
Authors: Tanvir Khan, Md Hasan Shahriar Rifat, M. Ibrahim, Razia Marzia, F. Parvin
Abstract: LaMg2H7 is a ternary wide band gap semiconductor that is a member of the hydride family. The bulk physical characteristics of the LaMg2H7 compound, including its structural, electronic band structure, elastic, thermal, and optical characteristics, have been examined in this work utilizing density functional theory (DFT). The elastic constants indicate that {\rm LaMg}_2H_7 is mechanically stable, brittle in nature, and anisotropic. This studied compound possesses a moderate level of hardness. The band structure and density of states have been examined to have a better understanding of its electronic behavior. The intrinsic carrier concentrations and effective masses have been determined using the band structure. The gravimetric hydrogen storage capacity (Cwt%) has been calculated, indicating that this compound is suitable for hydrogen storage applications. This compound is dynamically stable, as confirmed by its phonon dispersion. Here, the details of this wide-band-gap semiconductor's reflectivity, absorption coefficient, refractive index, dielectric function, optical conductivity, and loss function are investigated. The substance is a moderate reflector of ultraviolet (UV) light. The absorption and conductivity support the gap in the band structure. The thermodynamic properties, such as bulk modulus, internal energy, specific heat capacity, entropy, thermal expansion coefficient, and Debye temperature, have been explored at varying temperatures and pressures. {\rm LaMg}_2H_7 has a moderate level of melting temperature with higher lattice thermal conductivity. The value of the thermal expansion coefficient and minimum thermal conductivity is highly recommended for use as a thermal barrier coating (TBC).

Title: Field-Induced SIT in Disordered 2D Electron systems: The case of amorphous Indium-Oxide thin films
Authors: Tsofar Maniv, Vladimir Zhuravlev
Abstract: The phenomenon of field-induced superconductor to insulator transition (SIT) in disordered 2D electron systems has been a subject of controversy since its discovery in the early 1990s. Here we present a phenomenological quantitative theory of this phenomenon which is not based exclusively on the boson-vortex duality used commonly in the field. Within a new low-temperature framework of the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) functional approach to superconducting fluctuations we propose and develop a scenario in which bosons of Cooper-pair fluctuations (CPFs) condense and localize in real-space mesoscopic puddles under increasing magnetic field due to diminishing stiffness of the fluctuation modes at low temperatures in a broad range of momentum space. Quantum tunneled CPFs relieving the condensed mesoscopic puddles, which consequently pair break into fermionic quasi-particle excitations, dominate the thermally activated inter-puddles transport. The spatially shrinking puddles of CPFs, embedded in expanding normal-state regions, upon further increasing field, suppress the quasi-particle excitation gap and so lead to high-field negative magneto-resistance (MR). Application to amorphous Indium-Oxide thin films shows good quantitative agreement with experimental sheet resistance data. In particular, in agreement with the experiment at low temperatures (i.e. well below the quantum tunneling pair breaking "temperature"), the sheet resistance isotherms are predicted to show a single crossing point at a quantum critical field not far below the MR peak.

Title: Uncovering domain morphology in an unconventional magnet with scanning diamond quantum magnetometry
Authors: Freya Johnson (1), Jan Zemen (2), Helena Knowles (1), Lesley F. Cohen (3) ((1) Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge, (2) Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague (3) Department of Physics, Blackett Laboratory, Imperial College London)
Abstract: Unconventional magnetic materials including non-collinear antiferromagnets, p-wave magnets and altermagnets, are an emerging frontier for quantum spintronics and hybrid quantum devices. Critical to the application of these materials is control over the magnetic domain state, as their unique, symmetry-driven properties vanish in a multi-domain limit. However, the mechanisms governing domain formation in materials with compensated local moments remain poorly understood. In this work, we examine the ferrimagnetic to non-collinear antiferromagnetic phase transition of Mn3NiN using scanning nitrogen-vacancy centre magnetometry. We provide nanoscale mapping of the magnetic domain evolution on cooling and correlate the local stray fields with global magnetometry and anomalous Hall effect measurements. We observe the formation of a disordered, dendritic domain structure whose roughness is quantified using its fractal dimension. The fractal dimension steadily increases on cooling through the transition, saturating at a value of ~ 1.55 in the non-collinear phase, but the domain area distribution does not show any significant changes. We show this behaviour cannot be explained by the balance of demagnetisation energy and domain wall energy, and conclude elastic contributions and defects are a critical factor to explain the domain size.

Title: Microstructure sensitive recurrent neural network surrogate model of crystal plasticity
Authors: Michael D. Atkinson, Michael D. White, Adam J. Plowman, Pratheek Shanthraj
Abstract: The development of next-generation structural materials for harsh environments requires rapid assessment of mechanical performance and its dependence on microstructure. While full-field crystal plasticity (CP) models provide detailed insights, the high computational cost limits their use with uncertainty quantification workflows and in component-scale simulation. Surrogate models based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have shown promise in reproducing history-dependent mechanical behaviour but are applied to models with either fixed microstructure or representative volume elements. Here, we develop a microstructure sensitive RNN surrogate that predicts homogenised stress responses directly from three-dimensional grain structures and arbitrary deformation histories. The architecture employs a gated recurrent unit (GRU) with mappings from microstructure to both the initial hidden state and sequence inputs, allowing the model to capture path dependence and microstructure variability. Training data comprised of over 300,000 CP simulations generated using combinations of randomly generated microstructures and loading paths. The model was found to reproduce CP predictions for both in-distribution validation data and unseen deformation modes, with errors of 2 MPa to 3 MPa. Out-of-distribution microstructures were more difficult to predict, emphasising the need for representative training data with, for example, heavily textured microstructures. Embedding the model into a multiscale framework demonstrates its ability to replace conventional constitutive updates, reducing computational cost while preserving key features of the stress distribution. These results establish microstructure-informed RNN surrogates as a promising alternative to direct CP simulations, offering a pathway toward rapid multiscale modelling and uncertainty quantification.

Title: Emergence of mixed orientational ordering in quasi-one-dimensional superdisk and superball fluids
Authors: Sakineh Mizani, Martin Oettela, Péter Gurin, Szabolcs Varga
Abstract: We report the discovery of a mixed orientational structure in the quasi-one-dimensional fluid of hard non-spherical bodies with the exact calculation of the thermodynamic and structural quantities using the transfer operator method. The mixed arrangement, which is spatially uniform, but orientionally ordered, cannot be identified with conventional mesophases such as tetratic, cubatic and nematic. It is found that the particles form a mixed orientational arrangement with preferred parallel and perpendicular orientations in a channel, where the number of parallel and perpendicularly oriented particles is not equal even at the close packing density. The mixed structure can be stabilized with hard bodies having equal side lengths in parallel and perpendicular orientations along the channel. These conditions can be realized with colloidal superdisks (superballs) if the curvature of neighboring sides (faces) are different. We show that even a small stretching of the superparticle destabilizes mixed ordering due to perfect nematic order evolving upon approaching close-packing.

Title: SiC-TGAP: A machine learning interatomic potential for radiation damage simulations in 3C-SiC
Authors: Ali Hamedani, Andrea E.Sand
Abstract: Silicon carbide (SiC) has long been a subject of study for its application in harsh environments. Existing empirical interatomic potentials for 3C-SiC show significant discrepancies in predicting the properties that are crucial in describing the evolution of defects generated in collision cascades. We present a Gaussian approximation potential model for 3C-SiC (TGAP) trained by two-body and the turboSOAP many-body descriptors. The dataset covers crystalline, liquid and amorphous phases. To accurately capture defect dynamics, twenty-one defect types have been included in the dataset. TGAP captures the experimentally observed decomposition of carbon atoms in the liquid phase at atmospheric pressure, while also accurately reproducing the radial distribution function of the high-temperature homogeneous liquid phase across a range of densities. Moreover, it predicts the melting point in very good agreement with density functional theory and experiments. The potential is equipped with the Nordlund-Lehtola-Hobler repulsive potential to capture the high repulsion of recoils in the collision cascades. TGAP provides an accurate tool for atomistic simulation of radiation damage in cubic SiC.

Title: Magnetic-Field-Induced Geometric Response of Mean-Field Projectors: Streda Formula and Orbital Magnetization
Authors: Jihang Zhu, Chunli Huang
Abstract: We study the magnetic-field response of interacting electron systems within mean-field theory using perturbation theory. We show that the linear response of the mean-field density-matrix to a weak magnetic field is purely geometric: it depends only on wavefunction derivatives, the Berry connections linking the occupied and unoccupied subspaces, and is independent of the interaction potential and the quasiparticle dispersion. This leads to compact, gauge-invariant projector expressions for both the Středa formula and the formula for orbital magnetization. Our calculation explicitly elucidates the role of exchange and self-consistency in defining current vertices for orbital magnetization calculations. Our work establishes a direct connection between mean-field theory, quantum geometry and the non-interacting topological band theory.

Title: Thermal gradient-driven skyrmion dynamics with near-zero skyrmion Hall angle
Authors: Yogesh Kumar, Hurmal Saren, Pintu Das
Abstract: Thermal gradient driven skyrmion dynamics offers a promising route toward green spintronics, enabling the utilization of waste heat for information transport and processing. Using micromagnetic simulations, we investigate Neel skyrmions in a Co-Pt bilayer nanoracetrack and demonstrate that stochastic torques induced by a thermal gradient drive skyrmion motion toward the hotter region with a nearly vanishing Hall angle. The dynamics depends sensitively on intrinsic material parameters - the skyrmion velocity decreases with increasing damping constant, increases with stronger thermal gradients, and varies systematically with saturation magnetization, interfacial DMI strength, and uniaxial out of plane anisotropy. Importantly, we identify a specific range of material parameters within which the skyrmion velocity changes sharply while the Hall angle remains strongly suppressed, saturating near zero. This comprehensive parameter-dependent study establishes a universal design framework for minimizing the Hall effect in thermal gradient driven spintronic systems.

Title: Simulating Topological Order on Quantum Processors
Authors: Adam Gammon-Smith, Michael Knap, Frank Pollmann
Abstract: It is an ongoing quest to realize topologically ordered quantum states on different platforms including condensed matter systems, quantum simulators and digital quantum processors. Unlike conventional states characterized by their local order, these exotic states are characterized by their non-local entanglement. The consequences of topological order can be as profound as they are surprising, ranging from the emergence of fractionalized anyonic excitations to potentially providing a scalable platform for quantum error correction. This deep connection to quantum computing naturally motivates the realization and study of topologically ordered quantum states on quantum processors. However, due to the non-local nature of these states, their study presents a challenge for near-term quantum devices. This Perspective aims to review the recent progress towards the experimental realization of topologically ordered quantum states, their potential applications, and promising directions of future research.

Title: Noninteracting tight-binding models for Fock parafermions
Authors: Edward McCann
Abstract: By mapping itinerant spin-$1/2$ fermions to four-state Fock parafermions, we construct noninteracting tight-binding models for Fock parafermions in one dimension. They have single-particle real energy spectra consisting of a sum of single-particle energy levels each multiplied by a parafermionic occupation number. The single-particle levels may be determined by diagonalizing a square matrix whose order scales linearly with system size. These levels are the same as those of noninteracting fermionic models, as we show explicitly for the Rice-Mele model and the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. We show that the thermodynamic distribution function for the occupation numbers of noninteracting four-state parafermions is consistent with the mapping to spin-$1/2$ fermions. We apply the mapping to create a parafermionic counterpart of the Kitaev superconducting chain and show that the ground state in the topological phase is fourfold degenerate, with each ground state distinguished by the fourfold parafermionic occupation numbers of Majorana edge modes.

Title: Anomalous strain-dependent thermal conductivity in superelastic screw-dislocated graphites
Authors: Yu Li, Zhiqiang Zhao, Zhuhua Zhang, Yong-Wei Zhang, Jin-Wu Jiang
Abstract: The design of strain-stable, or even strain-enhanced thermal transport materials is critical for stable operation of high-performance electronic devices. However, most nanomaterials suffer from strain-induced degradation, with even minor tensile strains markedly reducing thermal conductivity. Here, we demonstrate that screw-dislocated graphites (SDGs), recently identified as topological semimetals, display an unusual increase in cross-plane thermal conductivity under both tensile and compressive strains, revealed by high-accuracy machine-learning-potential-driven non-equilibrium molecular dynamics. Notably, SDGs exhibit over 100% enhancement under tensile strains up to 80% along the dislocation axis, arising from strain-induced increase in dislocation interface tilt angle that elongates the effective heat transfer paths. Their thermal conductivity surpasses multilayer graphene by an order of magnitude. An analytical model is further derived linking thermal conductivity to dislocation number and strain, offering a predictive framework for designing strain-tunable screwdislocated structures. These findings highlight SDGs as a promising platform for high-performance electronic and wearable devices with tunable thermal properties.

Title: Understanding Polaronic Transport in Anatase TiO2 Films by Combining Precise Synthesis and First-Principles Many-Body Theory
Authors: F. Liu, Z. Yang, Y. Luo, S. Guo, C. Zhang, S. Choo, X. Xu, X. Wang, K. A. Mkhoyan, M. Bernardi, B. Jalan
Abstract: In complex oxides, charge carriers often couple strongly with lattice vibrations to form polarons-entangled electron-phonon quasiparticles whose transport properties remain difficult to characterize. Experimental access to intrinsic polaronic transport requires ultraclean samples, while theoretical descriptions demand methods beyond low-order perturbation theory. Here, we combine the growth of high-quality oxygen-vacancy-doped anatase TiO2 films by hybrid molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) with a first-principles electron-phonon diagrammatic Monte Carlo (FEP-DMC) framework recently developed for accurate polaron predictions. Our films exhibit record-high electron mobility for anatase TiO2, in excellent agreement with FEP-DMC calculations conducted prior to experiment, which predict a room-temperature mobility of 45 +/- 15 cm2V-1s-1 and a mobility-temperature scaling of mobility proportional to T^(-1.9 +/- 0.077). Microscopic analysis using scanning transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals the role of oxygen vacancies in modulating transport at lower temperatures. FEP-DMC further provides quantitative insight into polaron formation energy, phonon cloud distribution, lattice distortion around the polaron, and the polaronic contribution to mobility. Together, these results establish a predictive theory-experiment workflow to characterize polarons and provide a microscopic understanding of large-polaron transport in anatase TiO2, with broader implications for complex oxides and other polaronic materials.

Title: Data as Commodity: a Game-Theoretic Principle for Information Pricing
Authors: Pasquale Casaburi, Giovanni Piccioli, Pierpaolo Vivo
Abstract: Data is the central commodity of the digital economy. Unlike physical goods, it is non-rival, replicable at near-zero cost, and traded under heterogeneous licensing rules. These properties defy standard supply--demand theory and call for new pricing principles. We propose a game-theoretic approach in which the value of a data string emerges from strategic competition among N players betting on an underlying stochastic process, each holding partial information about past outcomes. A better-informed player faces a choice: exploit their informational advantage, or sell part of their dataset to less-informed competitors. By analytically computing the Nash equilibrium of the game, we determine the price range where the trade is beneficial to both buyer and seller. We uncover a rich landscape of market effects that diverge from textbook economics: first, prospective sellers and buyers can compete or jointly exploit the less informed competitors depending on the quality of data they hold. In a symbiotic regime, the seller can even share data for free while still improving her payoffs, showing that losing exclusivity does not necessarily reduce profit. Moreover, rivalry between well-informed players can paradoxically benefit uninformed ones, demonstrating that information abundance does not always translate to higher payoffs. We also show that the number of players influences the competition between informed parties: trades impossible in small markets become feasible in larger ones. These findings establish a theoretical foundation for the pricing of intangible goods in dynamically interacting digital markets, which are in need of robust valuation principles.

Title: Renormalization of Interacting Random Graph Models
Authors: Alessio Catanzaro, Diego Garlaschelli, Subodh P. Patil
Abstract: Random graphs offer a useful mathematical representation of a variety of real world complex networks. Exponential random graphs, for example, are particularly suited towards generating random graphs constrained to have specified statistical moments. In this investigation, we elaborate on a generalization of the former where link probabilities are conditioned on the appearance of other links, corresponding to the introduction of interactions in an effective generalized statistical mechanical formalism. When restricted to the simplest non-trivial case of pairwise interactions, one can derive a closed form renormalization group transformation for maximum coordination number two on the corresponding line graph. Higher coordination numbers do not admit exact closed form renormalization group transformations, a feature that paraphrases the usual absence of exact transformations in two or more dimensional lattice systems. We introduce disorder and study the induced renormalization group flow on its probability assignments, highlighting its formal equivalence to time reversed anisotropic drift-diffusion on the statistical manifold associated with the effective Hamiltonian. We discuss the implications of our findings, stressing the long wavelength irrelevance of certain classes of pair-wise conditioning on random graphs, and conclude with possible applications. These include modeling the scaling behavior of preferential effects on social networks, opinion dynamics, and reinforcement effects on neural networks, as well as how our findings offer a systematic framework to deal with data limitations in inference and reconstruction problems.

Title: Non-uniqueness of the steady state for run-and-tumble particles with a double-well interaction potential
Authors: Léo Touzo, Pierre Le Doussal
Abstract: We study $N$ run-and-tumble particles (RTPs) in one dimension interacting via a double-well potential $W(r)=-k_0 \, r^2/2+g \, r^4/4$, which is repulsive at short interparticle distance $r$ and attractive at large distance. At large time, the system forms a bound state where the density of particles has a finite support. We focus on the determination of the total density of particles in the stationary state $\rho_s(x)$, in the limit $N\to+\infty$. We obtain an explicit expression for $\rho_s(x)$ as a function of the ''renormalized" interaction parameter $k=k_0-3m_2$ where $m_2$ is the second moment of $\rho_s(x)$. Interestingly, this stationary solution exhibits a transition between a connected and a disconnected support for a certain value of $k$, which has no equivalent in the case of Brownian particles. Analyzing in detail the expression of the stationary density in the two cases, we find a variety of regimes characterized by different behaviors near the edges of the support and around $x=0$. Furthermore, we find that the mapping $k_0\to k$ becomes multi-valued below a certain value of the tumbling rate $\gamma$ of the RTPs for some range of values of $k_0$ near the transition, implying the existence of two stable solutions. Finally, we show that in the case of a disconnected support, it is possible to observe steady states where the density $\rho_s(x)$ is not symmetric. All our analytical predictions are in good agreement with numerical simulations already for systems of $N = 100$ particles. The non-uniqueness of the stationary state is a particular feature of this model in the presence of active (RTP) noise, which contrasts with the uniqueness of the Gibbs equilibrium for Brownian particles. We argue that these results are also relevant for a class of more realistic interactions with both an attractive and a repulsive part, but which decay at infinity.

Title: Topology of the generalized Brillouin zone of one-dimensional models
Authors: Heming Wang, Janet Zhong, Shanhui Fan
Abstract: The generalized Brillouin zones (GBZs) are integral in the analysis of non-Hermitian band structures. Conventional wisdom suggests that the GBZ should be connected, where each point can be indexed by the real part of the wavevector, similar to the Brillouin zone. Here we demonstrate rich topological features of the GBZs in generic non-Hermitian one-dimensional models. We prove and discuss a set of sufficient conditions for the model to ensure the connectivity of its GBZ. In addition, we show that the GBZ can become disconnected and have more connected components than the number of bands, which results from the point-gap features of the band structure. This novel GBZ topology is applied to further demonstrate a counterintuitive effect, where the line gap of an open-boundary spectrum with sublattice symmetry may be closed without changing its point-gap topology. Our results challenge the current understanding of bands and gaps in non-Hermitian systems and highlight the need to further investigate the topological effects associated with the GBZ including topological invariants and open-boundary braiding.

Title: Electrical and thermal magnetotransport and the Wiedemann-Franz law in semimetals with electron-electron scattering
Authors: Keigo Takahashi, Hiroyasu Matsuura, Hideaki Maebashi, Masao Ogata
Abstract: We study the electrical and thermal transport properties and the violation of the Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law of two-carrier semimetals using exact treatments of the Boltzmann equation with the impurity and electron-electron scatterings in a magnetic field. For comparison, we also study those in the case of Baber scattering: a single-carrier system with an impurity scattering and phenomenological momentum-dissipative electron-electron scattering. In both systems, the longitudinal and transverse WF laws, $L = L_{\text{H}} = L_{0}= \pi^2k_B^2/3e^2$, hold at zero temperature, where the Lorenz ratio $L$ and the Hall Lorenz ratio $L_{\text{H}}$ are ratios of thermal conductivity $\kappa_{\mu\nu}$ to electrical conductivity $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ divided by temperature. However, the electron-electron scattering makes Lorenz ratios deviate from $L_{0}$ with increasing temperature. To describe the WF law in a magnetic field, we introduce another set of Lorenz ratios, $\widetilde{L}$ and $\widetilde{L}_{\text{H}}$, defined as the ratios of the resistivity and the Hall coefficient to their thermal counterparts. The WF laws for them, $\widetilde{L} = \widetilde{L}_{\text{H}} = L_{0}$, and their violation are helpful for the discussion of $L$ and $L_{\text{H}}$. For Baber scattering, our exact result shows $L_{\text{H}}/L_{0} \sim (L/L_{0})^2$ in a weak magnetic field. In semimetals, the violations of the WF laws are significant, reflecting the different temperature dependence between the electrical and thermal resistivities in a magnetic field. This is because the momentum conservation of the electron-electron scattering has a completely different effect on electrical and thermal magnetotransport. We sort out these behaviors using $\widetilde{L}$ and $\widetilde{L}_{\text{H}}$. We also provide a relaxation time approximation, which is useful for comparing theory and experiment.

Title: Tangent space Krylov computation of real-frequency spectral functions: Influence of density-assisted hopping on 2D Mott physics
Authors: Oleksandra Kovalska, Jan von Delft, Andreas Gleis
Abstract: We present a tangent-space Krylov (TaSK) method for efficient computation of zero-temperature real-frequency spectral functions on top of ground state (GS) matrix product states (MPS) obtained from the Density Matrix Renormalization Group. It relies on projecting resolvents to the tangent space of the GS-MPS, where they can be efficiently represented using Krylov space techniques. This allows for a direct computation of spectral weights and their corresponding positions on the real-frequency axis. We demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the TaSK approach by showcasing spectral data for various models. These include the 1D Haldane-Shastry and Heisenberg models as benchmarks. As an interesting application, we study the Hubbard model on a cylinder at half-filling, augmented by a density-assisted hopping (DAH) term. We find that DAH leads to particle-hole asymmetric single-particle mobilities and lifetimes in the resulting Mott insulator, and identify the responsible scattering processes. Further, we find that DAH influences the dispersion of Green's function zeros beyond its range, which has a frustrating effect on the Mott insulator studied here.

Title: Dynamics of feedback Ising model
Authors: Yi-Ping Ma, Ivan Sudakow, P. L. Krapivsky, Sergey A. Vakulenko
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a mean-field Ising model whose coupling depends on the magnetization via a linear feedback function. A key feature of this linear feedback Ising model (FIM) is the possibility of temperature-induced bistability, where a temperature increase can favor bistability between two phases. We show that the linear FIM provides a minimal model for a transcritical bifurcation as the temperature varies. Moreover, there can be two or three critical temperatures when the external magnetic field is non-negative. In the bistable region, we identify a Maxwell temperature where the two phases are equally probable, and we find that increasing the temperature favors the lower phase. We show that the probability distribution becomes non-Gaussian on certain time intervals when the magnetization converges algebraically at either zero temperature or critical temperatures. Near critical points in the parameter space, we derive a Fokker-Planck equation, construct the families of equilibrium distributions, and formulate scaling laws for transition rates between two stable equilibria. The linear FIM provides considerable freedom to control steady-state bifurcations and their associated equilibrium distributions, which can be desirable for modeling feedback systems across disciplines.

Title: Non-destructive diagnostics of fiber orientation in large planar fiber-reinforced concrete specimens
Authors: Václav Papež, Karel Künzel, Petr Konrád, Kristýna Carrera, Petr Konvalinka
Abstract: The mechanical performance of fiber-reinforced concrete is critically dependent on the orientation and concentration of its reinforcing fibers. This paper presents a non-destructive method for diagnosing fiber parameters in large planar specimens. The proposed technique utilizes an electromagnetic measurement system using electrical coils with commercial LCR meters, but also a novel custom-made meter suitable for factory environments, offering a practical solution for quality control in prefabrication of high-performance structural elements. This study details the theoretical background, experimental setup and methodology, and provides an evaluation of the diagnostic system's effectiveness and accuracy. The results demonstrate a strong correlation between the electromagnetic measurements and the actual fiber parameters, confirming the method's reliability.

Title: Classically Sampling Noisy Quantum Circuits in Quasi-Polynomial Time under Approximate Markovianity
Authors: Yifan F. Zhang, Su-un Lee, Liang Jiang, Sarang Gopalakrishnan
Abstract: While quantum computing can accomplish tasks that are classically intractable, the presence of noise may destroy this advantage in the absence of fault tolerance. In this work, we present a classical algorithm that runs in $n^{\rm{polylog}(n)}$ time for simulating quantum circuits under local depolarizing noise, thereby ruling out their quantum advantage in these settings. Our algorithm leverages a property called approximate Markovianity to sequentially sample from the measurement outcome distribution of noisy circuits. We establish approximate Markovianity in a broad range of circuits: (1) we prove that it holds for any circuit when the noise rate exceeds a constant threshold, and (2) we provide strong analytical and numerical evidence that it holds for random quantum circuits subject to any constant noise rate. These regimes include previously known classically simulable cases as well as new ones, such as shallow random circuits without anticoncentration, where prior algorithms fail. Taken together, our results significantly extend the boundary of classical simulability and suggest that noise generically enforces approximate Markovianity and classical simulability, thereby highlighting the limitation of noisy quantum circuits in demonstrating quantum advantage.

Title: Symmetry Fragmentation
Authors: Thomas Iadecola
Abstract: In quantum many-body systems with kinetically constrained dynamics, the Hilbert space can split into exponentially many disconnected subsectors, a phenomenon known as Hilbert-space fragmentation. We study the interplay of such fragmentation with symmetries, focusing on charge conserving systems with charge conjugation and translation symmetries as a concrete example. The non-Abelian algebra of these symmetries and the projectors onto the fragmented subsectors leads to the emergence of exponentially many logical qubits encoded in degenerate pairs of eigenstates, which can be highly entangled. This algebra also provides necessary conditions for experimental signatures of Hilbert-space fragmentation, such as the persistence of density imbalances at late times.

Title: Diffusion-Guided Renormalization of Neural Systems via Tensor Networks
Authors: Nathan X. Kodama
Abstract: Far from equilibrium, neural systems self-organize across multiple scales. Exploiting multiscale self-organization in neuroscience and artificial intelligence requires a computational framework for modeling the effective non-equilibrium dynamics of stochastic neural trajectories. Non-equilibrium thermodynamics and representational geometry offer theoretical foundations, but we need scalable data-driven techniques for modeling collective properties of high-dimensional neural networks from partial subsampled observations. Renormalization is a coarse-graining technique central to studying emergent scaling properties of many-body and nonlinear dynamical systems. While widely applied in physics and machine learning, coarse-graining complex dynamical networks remains unsolved, affecting many computational sciences. Recent diffusion-based renormalization, inspired by quantum statistical mechanics, coarse-grains networks near entropy transitions marked by maximal changes in specific heat or information transmission. Here I explore diffusion-based renormalization of neural systems by generating symmetry-breaking representations across scales and offering scalable algorithms using tensor networks. Diffusion-guided renormalization bridges microscale and mesoscale dynamics of dissipative neural systems. For microscales, I developed a scalable graph inference algorithm for discovering community structure from subsampled neural activity. Using community-based node orderings, diffusion-guided renormalization generates renormalization group flow through metagraphs and joint probability functions. Towards mesoscales, diffusion-guided renormalization targets learning the effective non-equilibrium dynamics of dissipative neural trajectories occupying lower-dimensional subspaces, enabling coarse-to-fine control in systems neuroscience and artificial intelligence.

Title: Prediction of Molecular Single-Photon Emitters: A Materials-Modelling Approach
Authors: Erik Karlsson Öhman, Daqing Wang, R. Matthias Geilhufe, Christian Schäfer
Abstract: Interfacing light with quantum systems is an integral part of quantum technology, with the most essential building block being single-photon emitters. Although various platforms exist, each with its individual strengths, molecular emitters boast a unique advantage -- namely the flexibility to tailor their design to fit the requirements of a specific task. However, the characteristics of the vast space of possible molecular configurations are challenging to understand and explore. Here, we present a theoretical and computational framework to initiate exploration of this vast potential by integrating database analysis with microscopic predictions. Using a model system of dibenzoterrylene in an anthracene host as benchmark, our approach identifies promising new candidates, among them a chiral molecular emitter. Future extensions of our approach integrated with machine learning routines hold the promise of ultimately unlocking the full potential of molecular quantum light-matter interfaces.

Title: Stochastic interpretation of quantum mechanics
Authors: Mário J. de Oliveira
Abstract: We express the probabilistic character associated to the wave function by treating it as a stochastic variable. This is accomplished by means of a stochastic equation for the wave function whose noise changes the phase of the wave function but not its absolute value, so that the norm of the wave function is strictly conserved along a stochastic trajectory. We show that the density matrix that obeys the quantum Liouville equation is the covariance matrix associated to the stochastic wave function.

Title: Fisher Information, Training and Bias in Fourier Regression Models
Authors: Lorenzo Pastori, Veronika Eyring, Mierk Schwabe
Abstract: Motivated by the growing interest in quantum machine learning, in particular quantum neural networks (QNNs), we study how recently introduced evaluation metrics based on the Fisher information matrix (FIM) are effective for predicting their training and prediction performance. We exploit the equivalence between a broad class of QNNs and Fourier models, and study the interplay between the \emph{effective dimension} and the \emph{bias} of a model towards a given task, investigating how these affect the model's training and performance. We show that for a model that is completely agnostic, or unbiased, towards the function to be learned, a higher effective dimension likely results in a better trainability and performance. On the other hand, for models that are biased towards the function to be learned a lower effective dimension is likely beneficial during training. To obtain these results, we derive an analytical expression of the FIM for Fourier models and identify the features controlling a model's effective dimension. This allows us to construct models with tunable effective dimension and bias, and to compare their training. We furthermore introduce a tensor network representation of the considered Fourier models, which could be a tool of independent interest for the analysis of QNN models. Overall, these findings provide an explicit example of the interplay between geometrical properties, model-task alignment and training, which are relevant for the broader machine learning community.

Title: Space-filling discrete helices
Authors: Jayanth R. Banavar, Achille Giacometti, Trinh X. Hoang, Amos Maritan, Tatjana Škrbić
Abstract: Proteins are linear chain molecules that play a central role in life and health. Protein native state folds are modular assemblies of space-filling building blocks of {\alpha}-helices, \{beta}-sheets and tight turns. Here we deduce the structures of a countable set of space-filling helical forms of a uniform discrete thick string from first principles with no additional input or adjustable parameters. These forms occur in correspondence with the natural numbers, loosely analogous to the energy levels in a Bohr atom. We find the remarkable result that one of these helical forms is an excellent candidate for an {\alpha}-helix through seemingly improbable quantum chemistry coincidences that fit the geometrical requirements. Our work suggests that geometry and chemistry are complementary ways of looking at proteins and suggests a route for developing a unified framework for understanding proteins.

Title: Tailoring materials into kirigami robots
Authors: Saravana Prashanth Murali Babu, Aida Parvaresh, Ahmad Rafsanjani
Abstract: Kirigami, the traditional paper-cutting craft, holds immense potential for revolutionizing robotics by providing multifunctional, lightweight, and adaptable solutions. Kirigami structures, characterized by their bending-dominated deformation, offer resilience to tensile forces and facilitate shape morphing under small actuation forces. Kirigami components such as actuators, sensors, batteries, controllers, and body structures can be tailored to specific robotic applications by optimizing cut patterns. Actuators based on kirigami principles exhibit complex motions programmable through various energy sources, while kirigami sensors bridge the gap between electrical conductivity and compliance. Kirigami-integrated batteries enable energy storage directly within robot structures, enhancing flexibility and compactness. Kirigami-controlled mechanisms mimic mechanical computations, enabling advanced functionalities such as shape morphing and memory functions. Applications of kirigami-enabled robots include grasping, locomotion, and wearables, showcasing their adaptability to diverse environments and tasks. Despite promising opportunities, challenges remain in the design of cut patterns for a given function and streamlining fabrication techniques.

Title: Experimental Results from Early Non-Planar NI-HTS Magnet Prototypes for the Columbia Stellarator eXperiment (CSX)
Authors: D. Schmeling, M. Russo, B. T. Gebreamlak, T. J. Kiker, A. R. Skrypek, A. R. Hightower, J. Xue, S. Chen, S. Sohaib, C. Martinez, K. F. Richardson, L. Filor, S. Komatsu, L. Liu, C. Paz-Soldan
Abstract: The Columbia Stellarator eXperiment (CSX) is an upgrade of the Columbia Non-neutral Torus (CNT) that aims to demonstrate a university-scale, quasi-axisymmetric stellarator using high-temperature superconducting (HTS) technology at an on-axis magnetic field target of 0.5 T. Due to the strain sensitivity of ReBCO (Rare-earth Barium Copper Oxides), adapting it to non-planar stellarator geometries requires new winding, structural, and cooling strategies. We report on the results of a staged prototype program (P1, P2, P3) employing 3D-printed, sectional aluminum coil frames with winding channels, gimballed constant-tension winding mechanics, and solder potting for radial current redistribution and passive quench mitigation. The first prototype, P1 (planar elliptical, double-pancake) tested additive manufacture, sectional joining and baseline winding, achieving predicted fields at 77 K. P2 (non-planar, higher strain) was wound to 42 turns, energized at 30-40 K to produce expected magnetic fields, and studied thermal gradients and resistance at up to 4.5 kAt. Design evolution in P3 introduces concave geometry with dual double-pancakes, 200 turns, and approaches the 70 kAt target at 20 K. In parallel, sub-microhm lap joints have been developed. Together, these results de-risk manufacturing, cooling interfaces, quench management, and diagnostics, paving the way for full-size non-planar HTS stellarator coils for CSX.

Title: Dispersion and the transport of exciton-polaritons in an optical conveyor belt
Authors: Xingran Xu, Chunyu Jia, Xin-Xin Yang
Abstract: The growing interest in exciton-polaritons has driven the need to manipulate their motion and engineer their band structures to the forefront of contemporary research. This study explores the band structures that emerge from a spatially modulated potential, ingeniously realized through the use of an optical conveyor belt. By leveraging Bloch theory and conducting a meticulous analysis of the time evolution of polariton intensity in Fourier space, we have derived the energy dispersion relations both analytically and numerically within the context of a static lattice model. For time-dependent potentials, we employ the Lagrange variational method to elucidate the dynamics of polariton motion. Our results reveal that polaritons exhibit linear dispersion and follow linear trajectories with minor oscillations superimposed. This investigation not only deepens our fundamental understanding of exciton-polaritons but also provides a robust tool for advancing photonic devices and exerting precise control over current transport in quantum computing. Our findings pave the way for future innovations in high-speed and high-performance technologies.

Title: Identification and optimal control strategies for the transversal splitting of ultra--cold Bose gases
Authors: Nikolaus Würkner, Yevhenii Kuriatnikov, Karthikeyan Kumaran, Marupaka Venkat Ramana, Jörg Schmiedmayer, Andreas Kugi, Maximilian Prüfer, Andreas Deutschmann-Olek
Abstract: Splitting a Bose--Einstein condensate (BEC) is a key operation in fundamental physics experiments and emerging quantum technologies, where precise preparation of well--defined initial states requires fast yet coherent control of the condensate's nonlinear dynamics. This work formulates the BEC splitting process as an optimal feedforward control problem based on a physically interpretable, reduced--order model identified from limited experimental data. We introduce a systematic calibration strategy that combines optimal experiment selection and constrained nonlinear parameter estimation, enabling accurate system identification with minimal experimental overhead. Using this calibrated model, we compute energy--optimal trajectories via indirect optimal control to realize shortcuts to adiabaticity (STAs), achieving rapid transitions to the ground state of a double--well potential while suppressing excitations. Experiments confirm that the proposed control framework yields high--fidelity state transfers across multiple configurations, demonstrating its robustness and scalability for quantum control applications.

Title: Preparation of initial states with open and periodic boundary conditions on quantum devices using matrix product states
Authors: Yibin Guo, Manuel Schneider, Takis Angelides, Karl Jansen, C.-J. David Lin, Yao Ting Su
Abstract: We present a framework for preparing quantum states from matrix product states (MPS) with open and periodic boundary conditions on quantum devices. The MPS tensors are mapped to unitary gates, which are subsequently decomposed into native gates on quantum hardware. States with periodic boundary conditions (pbc) can be represented efficiently as quantum circuits using ancilla qubits and post-selection after measurement. We derive an exact expression for the success rate of this probabilistic approach, which can be evaluated a priori. The applicability of the method is demonstrated in two examples. First, we prepare the ground state of the Heisenberg model with pbc and simulate dynamics under a quenched Hamiltonian. The volume-law entanglement growth in the time evolution challenges classical algorithms but can potentially be overcome on quantum hardware. Second, we construct quantum circuits that generate excited states of the Schwinger model with high fidelities. Our approach provides a scalable method for preparing states on a quantum device, enabling efficient simulations of strongly correlated systems on near-term quantum computers.

Title: Entangling remote qubits through a two-mode squeezed reservoir
Authors: A. Andrés-Juanes, J. Agustí, R. Sett, E. S. Redchenko, L. Kapoor, S. Hawaldar, P. Rabl, J. M. Fink
Abstract: The distribution of entanglement across distant qubits is a central challenge for the operation of scalable quantum computers and large-scale quantum networks. Existing approaches rely on deterministic state transfer schemes or probabilistic protocols that require active control or measurement and postselection. Here we demonstrate an alternative, fully autonomous process, where two remote qubits are entangled through their coupling to a quantum-correlated photonic reservoir. In our experiment, a Josephson parametric converter produces a Gaussian, continuous-variable entangled state of propagating microwave fields that drives two spatially separated supercon- ducting transmon qubits into a stationary, discrete-variable entangled state. Beyond entanglement distribution, we also show that superconducting qubits can be used to directly certify two-mode squeezing, with higher sensitivity and without the need for calibrated noise-subtraction. These results establish networks of qubits interfaced with distributed continuous-variable entangled states as a powerful new platform for both foundational studies and quantum-technology relevant applications.

Title: Diffusion Codes: Self-Correction from Small(er)-Set Expansion with Tunable Non-locality
Authors: Adithya Sriram, Vedika Khemani, Benedikt Placke
Abstract: Optimal constructions of classical LDPC codes can be obtained by choosing the Tanner graph uniformly at random among biregular graphs. We introduce a class of codes that we call ``diffusion codes'', defined by placing each edge connecting bits and checks on some graph, and acting on that graph with a random SWAP network. By tuning the depth of the SWAP network, we can tune a tradeoff between the amount of randomness -- and hence the optimality of code parameters -- and locality with respect to the underlying graph. For diffusion codes defined on the cycle graph, if the SWAP network has depth $\sim Tn$ with $T> n^{2\beta}$ for arbitrary $\beta>0$, then we prove that almost surely the Tanner graph is a lossless ``smaller set'' vertex expander for small sets up size $\delta \sim \sqrt T \sim n^{\beta}$, with bounded bit and check degree. At the same time, the geometric size of the largest stabilizer is bounded by $\sqrt T$ in graph distance. We argue, based on physical intuition, that this result should hold more generally on arbitrary graphs. By taking hypergraph products of these classical codes we obtain quantum LDPC codes defined on the torus with smaller-set boundary and co-boundary expansion and the same expansion/locality tradeoffs as for the classical codes. These codes are self-correcting and admit single-shot decoding, while having the geometric size of the stabilizer growing as an arbitrarily small power law. Our proof technique establishes mixing of a random SWAP network on small subsystems at times scaling with only the subsystem size, which may be of independent interest.

Title: Efficient tensor-network simulations of weakly-measured quantum circuits
Authors: Darren Pereira, Leonardo Banchi
Abstract: We present a tensor-network-based method for simulating a weakly-measured quantum circuit. In particular, we use a Markov chain to efficiently sample measurements and contract the tensor network, propagating their effect forward along the spatial direction. Applications of our algorithm include validating quantum computers (capable of mid-circuit measurements) in regimes of easy classical simulability, and studying generative-machine-learning applications, where sampling from complex stochastic processes is the main task. As a demonstration of our algorithm, we consider a (1+1)-dimensional brickwall circuit of Haar-random unitaries, interspersed with generalized single-qubit measurements of variable strength. We simulate the dynamics for tens to hundreds of qubits if the circuit exhibits area-law entanglement (under strong measurements), and tens of qubits if it exhibits volume-law entanglement (under weak measurements). We observe signatures of a measurement-induced phase transition between the two regimes as a function of measurement strength.

Title: From Quantum Circuits with Ultraslow Dynamics to Classical Plaquette Models
Authors: Vikram Ravindranath, Hanchen Liu, Xiao Chen
Abstract: We introduce a family of hybrid quantum circuits involving unitary gates and projective measurements that display a measurement-induced phase transition. Remarkably, the volume-law phase featuring logarithmic entanglement growth for certain initial states. We attribute this slow entanglement growth to the similarly slow growth of the participation entropy, which bounds the entanglement. Furthermore, the quantum circuit can be mapped to a classical spin model with real positive Boltzmann weights which involves local multi-spin interactions and displays glassy dynamics at finite temperature. We trace the origin of both the slow quantum dynamics and the classical glassiness to the presence of large, non-local symmetry operators. Our work establishes a novel connection between quantum entanglement dynamics and classical glassy behavior, offering a new geometric perspective on entanglement phase transitions.

Title: Bulk plasmons in elemental metals
Authors: Dario A. Leon, Claudia Cardoso, Kristian Berland
Abstract: The spectral properties, momentum dispersion, and broadening of bulk plasmonic excitations of 25 elemental metals are studied from first principles calculations in the random-phase approximation. Spectral band structures are constructed from the resulting momentum- and frequency-dependent inverse dielectric function. We develop an effective analytical representation of the main collective excitations in the dielectric response, by extending our earlier model based on multipole-Padé approximants (MPA) to incorporate both momentum and frequency dependence. With this tool, we identify plasmonic quasiparticle dispersions exhibiting complex features, including non-parabolic energy and intensity dispersions, discontinuities due to anisotropy, and overlapping effects that lead to band crossings and anti-crossings. We also find good agreement between computed results and available experiments in the optical limit. The results for elemental metals establish a reference point that can guide both fundamental studies and practical applications in plasmonics and spectroscopy.

Title: Fast event-driven simulations for soft spheres: from dynamics to Laves phase nucleation
Authors: Antoine Castagnède, Laura Filion, Frank Smallenburg
Abstract: Conventional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations struggle when simulating particles with steeply varying interaction potentials, due to the need to use a very short time step. Here, we demonstrate that an event-driven Monte Carlo (EDMC) approach first introduced by Peters and de With [Phys. Rev. E 85, 026703 (2012)] represents an excellent substitute for MD in the canonical ensemble. In addition to correctly reproducing the static thermodynamic properties of the system, the EDMC method closely mimics the dynamics of systems of particles interacting via the steeply repulsive Weeks-Chandler-Andersen (WCA) potential. In comparison to time-driven MD simulations, EDMC runs faster by over an order of magnitude at sufficiently low temperatures. Moreover, the lack of a finite time step in EDMC circumvents the need to trade accuracy against simulation speed associated with the choice of time step in MD. We showcase the usefulness of this model to explore the phase behavior of the WCA model at extremely low temperatures, and to demonstrate that spontaneous nucleation and growth of the Laves phases is possible at temperatures significantly lower than previously reported.

Title: Electrical readout of spins in the absence of spin blockade
Authors: Felix-Ekkehard von Horstig, Lorenzo Peri, Virginia N. Ciriano-Tejel, Sylvain Barraud, Jason A. W. Robinson, Monica Benito, Frederico Martins, M. Fernando Gonzalez-Zalba
Abstract: In semiconductor nanostructures, spin blockade (SB) is the most scalable mechanism for electrical spin readout, requiring only two bound spins for its implementation. In conjunction with charge sensing techniques, SB has led to high-fidelity readout of spins in semiconductor-based quantum processors. However, various mechanisms may lift SB, such as strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) or low-lying excited states, hence posing challenges to perform spin readout at scale and with high fidelity in such systems. Here, we present a method, based on the dependence of the two-spin system polarizability on energy detuning, to perform spin state readout even when SB lifting mechanisms are dominant. It leverages SB lifting as a resource to detect selectively different spin measurement outcomes. We demonstrate the method using a hybrid system formed by a quantum dot (QD) and a Boron acceptor in a silicon p-type transistor and show spin-selective readout of different spin states under SB lifting conditions due to (i) SOC and (ii) low-lying orbital states in the QD. We further use the method to determine the detuning-dependent spin relaxation time of 0.1 - 8 $\mu$s. Our method should help perform projective spin measurements with high spin-to-charge conversion fidelity in systems subject to strong SOC, will facilitate state leakage detection and enable complete readout of two-spin states.

Title: Cattaneo--type subdiffusion equation
Authors: Tadeusz Kosztołowicz, Aldona Dutkiewicz, Katarzyna D. Lewandowska
Abstract: The ordinary subdiffusion equation, with a fractional time derivative of at most first order, describes a process in which the propagation velocity of diffusing molecules is unlimited. To avoid this non-physical property different forms of the Cattaneo subdiffusion equation have been proposed. We define the Cattaneo effect as a delay of the ordinary subdiffusion flux activation by a random time. By incorporating this effect into the flux equation we get a Cattaneo--type subdiffusion equation (CTSE). We study the CTSE that differs from the ordinary subdiffusion equation by an additional integro--differential operator (AO) controlled by a time delay probability distribution. A method for deriving CTSE within the standard continuous time random walk model is also shown. As examples, we consider the CTSE with AO being the Caputo fractional time derivative of the order independent of the subdiffusion exponent and with the AO with a kernel that is a slowly varying function. In the first case the Cattaneo effect disappears over time much faster than in the second one. Based on the Green's functions, the time evolutions of the first passage time distribution and of the mean square displacement of a diffusing molecule, we discuss whether the influence of the Cattaneo effect is significant. In the considered examples, this influence seems to be small. However, a relative probability of finding a molecule at a long distance from the starting point for the CTSE equation with respect to the ordinary subdiffusion equation increases rapidly with distance. Even small changes caused by the Cattaneo effect can lead to different results in modeling processes where a faster appearance of a diffusing object changes the nature of the process. The effect may be important, for example, in modeling the spread of an epidemic when a diffusing object is a source of infection.

Title: Superconducting properties of Fibonacci chains with enhanced superconducting pairing at the boundaries
Authors: Quanyong Zhu, Guo-Qiao Zha, A. A. Shanenko, Yajiang Chen
Abstract: Recently, the superconducting properties of Fibonacci quasicrystals have attracted considerable attention. By numerically solving the self-consistent Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations for an $s-$wave superconducting Fibonacci chain, we find that the system exhibits universal end superconductivity, where the pair potential at the chain ends can persist at higher temperatures compared to the bulk critical temperature ($T_{cb}$) of the condensate in the chain center. Furthermore, our study reveals two distinct critical temperatures at the left ($T_{cL}$) and right ($T_{cR}$) ends of the chain. This complex behavior arises from the competition between topological bound states and critical states, a characteristic of quasicrystals. With the chosen parameters, the maximal enhancement of $T_{cR}$ reaches up to $66\%$ relative to $T_{cb}$, while $T_{cL}$ can increase by up to $31\%$. Our study sheds light on the phenomenon of end superconductivity in Fibonacci quasicrystals, pointing to alternative pathways for increasing the superconducting critical temperature.

Title: Quantum dynamics in symmetry-breaking states of correlated electrons: Antiferromagnetic phase
Authors: Václav Janiš, Mukesh Khanore, Antonín Klíč
Abstract: Symmetry-breaking phases in many-fermion systems are characterized by anomalous functions that represent transient processes during which some properties of free particles, such as spin or charge, are not conserved. Connecting the low-temperature symmetry-breaking phase with the high-temperature one within the Baym-Kadanoff scheme, beyond the static mean-field approximation, remains an unresolved, long-standing challenge. We identify the reason why approximations with critical dynamical fluctuations in the Schwinger-Dyson equation lead to a mismatch in the transition temperatures calculated from the high- and low-temperature phases. We propose a solution to this generic problem by excluding anomalous contributions to response functions that do not obey conservation of excitations in their interactions. We illustrate this behavior using the example of an antiferromagnetic state. We reveal that the spectral function in the antiferromagnetic phase exhibits a double-gap structure at zero temperature when the anomalous self-energy is frequency-dependent.

Title: How Semilocal Are Semilocal Density Functional Approximations? -Tackling Self-Interaction Error in One-Electron Systems
Authors: Akilan Ramasamy, Lin Hou, Jorge Vega Bazantes, Tom J. P. Irons, Andrew M. Wibowo-Teale, Jianwei Sun
Abstract: Self-interaction error (SIE), arising from the imperfect cancellation of the spurious classical Coulomb interaction between an electron and itself, is a persistent challenge in modern density functional approximations. This issue is illustrated using the prototypical one-electron system $H_2^+$. While significant efforts have been made to eliminate SIE through the development of computationally expensive nonlocal density functionals, it is equally important to explore whether SIE can be mitigated within the framework of more efficient semilocal density functionals. In this study, we present a non-empirical meta-generalized gradient approximation (meta-GGA) that incorporates the Laplacian of the electron density. Our results demonstrate that the meta-GGA significantly reduces SIE, yielding a binding energy curve for $H_2^+$ that matches the exact solution at equilibrium and improves across a broad range of bond lengths over those of the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) and strongly-constrained and appropriately-normed (SCAN) semilocal density functionals. This advancement paves the way for further development within the realm of semilocal approximations.

Title: Nonperturbative calculation of exchange coupling parameters
Authors: Tomonori Tanaka, Yoshihiro Gohda
Abstract: Exchange coupling parameters $J_{ij}$ within the Heisenberg model and its extensions are crucial for understanding magnetic behavior at the atomic level. Perturbative approaches based on the magnetic force theorem (MFT, often called the Liechtenstein method) are well established in the infinitesimal-rotation limit, yet the accuracy of such mappings for finite-angle spin fluctuations -- including slightly to moderately disordered spin configurations -- remains to be clarified. Here we evaluate $J_{ij}$ nonperturbatively for systems of both fundamental and practical interest, including perovskite SrMnO$_3$, neodymium-magnet compounds, and elemental 3$d$ transition metals, and compare the results with MFT-based calculations. The nonperturbative approach provides results that remain consistent for both small and large finite spin rotations, thereby complementing MFT-based methods by extending validated applicability beyond the infinitesimal-rotation limit. Further analysis shows that this consistency arises from explicitly incorporating finite-angle-induced changes in charge and spin densities -- effects that are neglected in perturbative mappings -- into the extracted $J_{ij}$. This provides a practical route to more quantitative spin models for the analysis and design of magnetic materials.

Title: Renormalization-Group Analysis of the Many-Body Localization Transition in the Random-Field XXZ Chain
Authors: Jacopo Niedda, Giacomo Bracci Testasecca, Giuseppe Magnifico, Federico Balducci, Carlo Vanoni, Antonello Scardicchio
Abstract: We analyze the spectral properties of the Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain with random fields in light of recent works of the renormalization-group flow of the Anderson model in infinite dimension. We reconstruct the beta function of the order parameter from the numerical data, and show that it does not admit a one-parameter scaling form and a simple Wilson-Fisher fixed point. Rather, it is compatible with a two-parameter, Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless-like flow with a line of fixed points (the many-body localized phase), which terminates into the localization transition critical point. Therefore, we argue that previous studies, which assumed the existence of an isolated Wilson- Fisher fixed point and performed one-parameter finite-size scaling analysis, could not explain the numerical data in a coherent way.

Title: Satisfaction and Violation of the Fluctuation-Dissipation Relation in spin ice materials
Authors: F. Morineau, V. Cathelin, P. C. W. Holdsworth, S. R. Giblin, G. Balakhrishnan, K. Matsuhira, C. Paulsen, E. Lhotel
Abstract: We test the fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR) in spin ice materials Dy$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ and Ho$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ by measuring both the magnetic noise and the out-of-phase part of the susceptibility and comparing their ratio. We show that it is satisfied at temperatures well into the non-ergodic region below 600 mK, indicating local equilibrium. In both materials, below 400 mK, low frequency violations develop, showing an excess of noise as in spin glasses, with a frequency threshold of 0.1 Hz. New relaxation pathways and aging properties are unveiled in this frequency range in the ac susceptibility. The FDR remains valid at higher frequencies down to 150 mK.

Title: Amplitude Expansion Phase Field Crystal (APFC) Modeling based Efficient Dislocation Simulations using Fourier Pseudospectral Method
Authors: Xinyi Wei, Yangshuai Wang, Kai Jiang, Lei Zhang
Abstract: Crystalline defects critically influence material properties, necessitating accurate simulation methods. Existing approaches, from atomic-scale configurations to continuum elasticity, face inherent limitations in modeling dislocation-induced lattice deformation. The amplitude expansion of the phase field crystal (APFC) model bridges this gap with a mesoscopic description. This paper introduces a computationally efficient Fourier pseudospectral method for solving the APFC equations. The method exploits system periodicity and solution analyticity--the latter's rigorous proof remaining an open question, as discussed herein--to enable precise implementation of periodic boundary conditions. Numerical experiments on 2D triangular and 3D body-centered cubic lattices demonstrate that the method accurately reproduces the strain fields of edge dislocations, matching continuum theory predictions. These results confirm the APFC model's potential for capturing complex defect structures at the mesoscale, paving the way for simulating more intricate defect dynamics.

Title: Diode effect in the Fraunhofer pattern of disordered planar Josephson junctions
Authors: Luca Chirolli, Angelo Greco, Alessandro Crippa, Elia Strambini, Mario Cuoco, Luigi Amico, Francesco Giazotto
Abstract: The Josephson diode effect describes the property of a Josephson junction to have different values of the critical current for different direction of applied bias current and it is the focus of intense research thanks to the possible applications. The ubiquity of the effect experimentally reported calls for a study of the impact that disorder can have in the appearance of the effect. We study the Fraunhofer pattern of planar Josephson junctions in presence of different kinds of disorder and imperfections and we find that a junction that is {\it mirror} symmetric at zero-field forbids the diode effect and that the diode effect is typically magnified at the nodal points of the Fraunhofer pattern. The work presents a comprehensive treatment of the role of pure spatial inhomogeneity in the emergence of a diode effect in planar junctions, with an extension to the multi-terminal case and to systems of Josephson junctions connected in parallel.

Title: Rainbow chains and numerical renormalisation group for accurate chiral conformal spectra
Authors: Attila Szabó
Abstract: Based on the relationship between reduced and thermal density matrices in conformal field theory (CFT), we show that the entanglement spectrum of a conformal critical chain with exponentially decaying terms consists of conformal towers of the associated chiral CFT, with only weak finite-size effects. Through free-fermion and interacting examples, we show that these entanglement spectra present a reliable method to extract detailed CFT spectra from single wave functions without access to the parent Hamiltonian. We complement our method with a Wilsonian numerical renormalisation group algorithm for solving interacting, exponentially decaying chain Hamiltonians.

Title: Nonlinear phononics in Bi$_2$Te$_3$ nanoscale thin films: A theoretical approach
Authors: A. Levchuk, R. Busselez, G. Vaudel, P. Ruello, V. Juvé, B. Arnaud
Abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations not only allow to predict the vibrational and optical properties of solids but also to understand and disentangle the mechanisms playing a key role in the generation of coherent optical phonons. Recent experiments performed on a Bi$_2$Te$_3$ nanofilm have shown that a THz pulse launches at least a coherent $A_{1g}^1$ phonon as the transient transmittance measured using an isotropic detection scheme displays oscillations with a frequency matching the frequency of the $A_{1g}^1$ mode measured in Raman experiments. Such an observation can be explained by invoking either a sum frequency process or cubic/quartic phonon-phonon couplings as considered for Bi$_2$Se$_3$, a parent compound of Bi$_2$Te$_3$. By resorting to group theory and calculating energy surfaces from first-principles, the main phonon-phonon couplings can be identified. Furthermore, a minimal model can be built to compute the dynamics of the Raman active modes coupled to the infrared active mode driven by the experimental THz pulse. Our model firmly establishes that cubic phonon-phonon interactions are relevant as the agreement between the computed and experimental transmittance is noteworthy.

Title: Synthetic Quorum Sensing and Absorbing Phase Transitions in Colloidal Active Matter
Authors: Thibault Lefranc, Alberto Dinelli, Carla Fernández-Rico, Roel P. A. Dullens, Julien Tailleur, Denis Bartolo
Abstract: Unlike biological active matter that constantly adapt to their environment, the motors of synthetic active particles are typically agnostic to their surroundings and merely operate at constant force. Here, we design colloidal active rods capable of modulating their inner activity in response to crowding, thereby enforcing a primitive form of quorum sensing interactions. Through experiments, simulations, and theory we elucidate the impact of these interactions on the phase behavior of isotropic active matter. We demonstrate that, when conditioned to density, motility regulation can either lead to an absorbing phase transition, where all particles freeze their dynamics, or to atypical phase separation, where flat interfaces supporting a net pressure drop are in mechanical equilibrium. Fully active and fully arrested particles can then form heterogeneous patterns ruled by the competition between quorum sensing and mechanical interactions. Beyond the specifics of motile colloids, we expect our findings to apply broadly to adaptive active matter assembled from living or synthetic units.

Title: Structure and dynamics of a Rouse polymer in a fluctuating correlated medium
Authors: Pietro Luigi Muzzeddu, Davide Venturelli, Andrea Gambassi
Abstract: We study the static and dynamical properties of a harmonically confined Rouse polymer coupled to a fluctuating correlated medium, which affect each other reciprocally during their stochastic evolution. The medium is modeled by a scalar Gaussian field which can feature modes with slow relaxation and long-range spatial correlations. We show that these modes affect the long-time behavior of the average position of the center of mass of the polymer, which, after a displacement, turns out to relax algebraically towards its equilibrium value. This is a manifestation of the non-Markovian nature of the effective evolution of the position of the center of mass, once the degrees of freedom of the medium have been integrated out. In contrast, we show that the coupling to the medium speeds up the relaxation of higher Rouse modes. We further characterize the typical size of the polymer as a function of its polymerization degree and of the correlation length of the medium, particularly when the system is driven out of equilibrium via the application of a constant external driving force. Finally, we study the response of a linear polymer to a tensile force acting on its terminal monomers.

Title: Toughness of double network hydrogels: the role of reduced stress propagation
Authors: Samuel B. Walker, Suzanne M. Fielding
Abstract: Double network hydrogels show remarkable mechanical performance, combining high strength and fracture toughness with sufficient stiffness to bear load, despite containing only a low density of cross-linked polymer molecules in water. We introduce a simple mesoscale model of a double network material, detailed enough to resolve the salient microphysics of local plastic bond breakage, yet simple enough to address macroscopic cracking. Load sharing between the networks results in a delocalisation of stress such that the double network inherits both the stiffness of its stiff-and-brittle sacrificial network and the ductility of its soft-and-ductile matrix network. The underlying mechanism is a reduction in the Eshelby stress propagator between sacrificial bonds, inhibiting the tendency for the plastic failure of one sacrificial bond to propagate stress to neighbouring sacrificial bonds and cause a follow-on cascade of breakages. The mechanism of brittle macroscopic cracking is thereby suppressed, giving instead ductile deformation via diffusely distributed microcracking.

Title: Current-Enabled Optical Conductivity of Collective Modes in Unconventional Superconductors
Authors: Gerrit Niederhoff, Ryusei Kataoka, Kazuaki Takasan, Naoto Tsuji
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the current-enabled linear optical conductivity of collective modes in superconductors with unconventional pairing symmetries. After deriving general formulas for the optical conductivity of a superconductor featuring multiple pairing channels and bands using the path integral formalism, we apply these formulas to several models. Using a model of competing s- and d-wave pairing interactions, we find that several known collective modes generate peaks in the optical conductivity upon injection of a supercurrent. This includes single- and multiband versions of Bardasis-Schrieffer modes, mixed-symmetry Bardasis-Schrieffer modes, and Leggett modes. Using a model for interband p-wave superconductivity with Rashba spin-orbit coupling, we find that in such a system Bardasis-Schrieffer modes are optically active even without introducing a supercurrent. In a p+ip chiral ground state, these modes turn out to produce peaks in the longitudinal and transverse optical conductivity. Other collective modes belonging to the chiral p+ip order parameter turn out to be unaffected by the spin-orbit coupling but contribute to the optical response when a supercurrent is introduced. These results promise new avenues for the observation of collective modes in a variety of superconducting systems, including multiband superconductors and superconductors that feature multiple pairing channels or multi-component order parameters, such as chiral p- or d-wave superconductors.

Title: Chirality-induced selectivity of angular momentum by orbital Edelstein effect in carbon nanotubes
Authors: Börge Göbel, Ingrid Mertig, Samir Lounis
Abstract: Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are promising materials exhibiting exceptional strength, electrical conductivity, and thermal properties, making them promising for various technologies. Besides achiral configurations with a zigzag or armchair edge, there exist chiral CNTs with a broken inversion symmetry. Here, we demonstrate that chiral CNTs exhibit chirality-induced orbital selectivity (CIOS), which is caused by the orbital Edelstein effect and could be detected as chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS). We find that the orbital Edelstein susceptibility is an odd function of the chirality angle of the nanotube and is proportional to its radius. For metallic CNTs close to the Fermi level, the orbital Edelstein susceptibility increases quadratically with energy. This makes the CISS and CIOS of metallic chiral nanotubes conveniently tunable by doping or applying a gate voltage, which allows for the generation of spin- and orbital-polarized currents. The possibility of generating large torques makes chiral CNTs interesting candidates for technological applications in spin-orbitronics and quantum computing.

Title: Scattering of a Dirac particle by a Berry phase domain wall
Authors: Lassaad Mandhour, Farah Bouhadida, Frédéric Piéchon
Abstract: Massless Dirac particles are characterized by an effective pseudospin-momentum locking, which is the origin of the peculiar scattering properties of Dirac particles through potential barriers. This pseudospin-momentum locking also governs the quantum geometric properties (such as the Berry phase and Berry curvature) of Dirac particles. In the present work, we demonstrate that a domain wall separating two regions with distinct quantum geometric properties can serve as an alternative to potential barriers. Specifically, using the three-band $\alpha-T_3$ model of two-dimensional Dirac particles, we show that a Berry phase domain wall results in partial reflection and transmission of the Dirac particles, despite the fact that the incident and refracted momenta are identical.

Title: Voltage-tuned anomalous-metal to metal transition in hybrid Josephson junction arrays
Authors: S. Sasmal, M. Efthymiou-Tsironi, G. Nagda, E. Fugl, L. L. Olsen, F. Krizek, C. M. Marcus, S. Vaitiekėnas
Abstract: We report voltage-tuned phase transitions in arrays of hybrid semiconductor-superconductor islands arranged in a square lattice. A double-layer electrostatic gate geometry enables independent tuning of inter-island coupling and proximity-induced superconductivity. This design enables access to the superconductor-insulator, superconductor-metal, and metal-insulator transitions in a single device, revealing critical points and emergent intermediate phases. We find that the superconductor-insulator transition is interrupted by an anomalous metallic phase with saturating low-temperature resistivity. Across gate voltages, this regime extends over three orders of magnitude in resistivity and can be continuously tuned into the conventional metallic phase. The signature of the anomalous metallic phase is suppressed by magnetic frustration.

Title: Freezing line of polydisperse hard spheres via direct-coexistence simulations
Authors: Antoine Castagnède, Laura Filion, Frank Smallenburg
Abstract: In experimental systems, colloidal particles are virtually always at least somewhat polydisperse, which can have profound effects on their ability to crystallize. Unfortunately, accurately predicting the effects of polydispersity on phase behavior using computer simulations remains a challenging task. As a result, our understanding of the equilibrium phase behavior of even the simplest colloidal model system, hard spheres, remains limited. Here, we present a new approach to map out the freezing line of polydisperse systems that draws on direct-coexistence simulations in the semi-grand canonical ensemble. We use this new method to map out the conditions where a hard-sphere fluid with a Gaussian size distribution becomes metastable with respect to partial crystallization into a face-centered-cubic crystal. Consistent with past predictions, we find that as the polydispersity of the fluid increases, the coexisting crystal becomes increasingly size-selective, exhibiting a lower polydispersity and larger mean particle size than the fluid phase. Interestingly, for sufficiently high polydispersity, this leads to a crystal phase with a lower number density than that of the coexisting fluid. Finally, we exploit our direct-coexistence simulations to examine the characteristics of the fluid-crystal interface, including the surface stress and interfacial absorption.

Title: Exact Quantum Many-Body Scars in 2D Quantum Gauge Models
Authors: Yuan Miao, Linhao Li, Hosho Katsura, Masahito Yamazaki
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) serve as important examples of ergodicity-breaking phenomena in quantum many-body systems. Despite recent extensive studies, exact QMBS are rare in dimensions higher than one. In this paper, we study a two-dimensional quantum $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge model that is dual to a two-dimensional spin-$1/2$ XY model defined on bipartite graphs. We identify the exact eigenstates of the XY model with a tower structure as exact QMBS. Exploiting the duality transformation, we show that the exact QMBS of the XY model (and XXZ model) after the transformation are the exact QMBS of the dual $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge model. This construction is versatile and has potential applications for finding new QMBS in other higher-dimensional models.

Title: Performance of machine-learning-assisted Monte Carlo in sampling from simple statistical physics models
Authors: Luca Maria Del Bono, Federico Ricci-Tersenghi, Francesco Zamponi
Abstract: Recent years have seen a rise in the application of machine learning techniques to aid the simulation of hard-to-sample systems that cannot be studied using traditional methods. Despite the introduction of many different architectures and procedures, a wide theoretical understanding is still lacking, with the risk of suboptimal implementations. As a first step to address this gap, we provide here a complete analytic study of the widely-used Sequential Tempering procedure applied to a shallow MADE architecture for the Curie-Weiss model. The contribution of this work is twofold: firstly, we give a description of the optimal weights and of the training under Gradient Descent optimization. Secondly, we compare what happens in Sequential Tempering with and without the addition of local Metropolis Monte Carlo steps. We are thus able to give theoretical predictions on the best procedure to apply in this case. This work establishes a clear theoretical basis for the integration of machine learning techniques into Monte Carlo sampling and optimization.

Title: Fe contribution to the magnetic anisotropy of $L{1_0}$-ordered FePt thin films studied by angle-dependent x-ray magnetic circular dichroism
Authors: Goro Shibata, Keisuke Ikeda, Takeshi Seki, Shoya Sakamoto, Yosuke Nonaka, Zhendong Chi, Yuxuan Wan, Masahiro Suzuki, Tsuneharu Koide, Hiroki Wadati, Koki Takanashi, Atsushi Fujimori
Abstract: Among magnetic thin films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), $L1_0$-ordered FePt has attracted significant attention because of its exceptionally strong PMA. However, the microscopic origin of its strong PMA has not been elucidated experimentally. We have investigated the contribution of the Fe $3d$ electrons to its magnetic anisotropy energy by angle-dependent x-ray magnetic circular dichroism at the Fe $L_{2,3}$ edge. By this technique, one can deduce the magnetic dipole moment $m_\text{T}$, which represents the anisotropic spatial distribution of spin-polarized electrons, and the orbital moment anisotropy (OMA) of Fe $3d$ electrons. Detected finite $m_\text{T}$ indicates that the spin-polarized Fe $3d$ electrons are distributed preferentially in the out-of-plane direction of the films. This $m_\text{T}$ of Fe overwhelms the positive contribution of OMA to PMA, and reduces the PMA of $L1_0$-ordered FePt thin films, consistent with a previous first-principles calculation. The present result implies that a large positive contribution of the non-magnetic element Pt rather than Fe governs the PMA of $L1_0$-ordered FePt thin films.

Title: Unconventional Superconductivity in $\mathrm{La_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7}}$ from the Perspective of Symmetry
Authors: Guan-Hao Feng, Jun Quan, Yusheng Hou
Abstract: The recently discovered superconductor $\mathrm{La_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7}}$ has attracted significant attention due to its remarkably high transition temperature ($T_{c}$) under high pressure. Shortly after this discovery, thin-film $\mathrm{La_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7}}$ was demonstrated to exhibit ambient-pressure superconductivity; however, the corresponding $T_c$ is only about half that of the pressurized bulk material. This striking difference raises questions about the underlying mechanisms governing superconductivity in these two structures. To address this issue, we develop a symmetry-based method that investigates superconducting pairings solely based on experimentally determined symmetry and $T_c$, without assuming any specific superconducting parameters. Applying this approach, we find that both pressurized bulk and thin-film $\mathrm{La_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7}}$ exhibit $s_{\pm}$-wave pairing symmetry and two-gap superconductivity, yet their dominant microscopic origins are distinct. In the pressurized bulk, superconductivity is dominated by out-of-plane pairing of the Ni-$d_{z^2}$ orbitals, while in the thin film, in-plane pairing of the Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals prevails. Furthermore, the observed reduction in $T_c$ can be attributed to this transition of the dominant pairing types, driven by the decreased ratio of inter-layer to intra-layer hoppings in the thin film. Our result sheds lights on the microscopic pairings in $\mathrm{La_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7}}$ and reveal the significance of the symmetry. This method can potentially be generalized to a broader range of unconventional superconductors.

Title: Nernst effect and its thickness dependence in superconducting NbN films
Authors: Thomas Bouteiller, Arthur Marguerite, Ramzy Daou, Dmitry Yakovlev, Stéphane Pons, Cheryl Feuillet-Palma, Dimitri Roditchev, Benoît Fauqué, Kamran Behnia
Abstract: Superconducting thin films and layered crystals display a Nernst signal generated by short-lived Cooper pairs above their critical temperature. Several experimental studies have broadly verified the standard theory invoking Gaussian fluctuations of a two-dimensional superconducting order parameter. Here, we present a study of the Nernst effect in granular NbN thin films with a thickness varying from 4 to 30 nm, exceeding the short superconducting coherence length and putting the system in the three-dimensional limit. We find that the Nernst conductivity decreases linearly with reduced temperature ($\alpha_{xy}\propto \frac{T-T_c}{T_c}$), but the amplitude of $\alpha_{xy}$ scales with thickness. While the temperature dependence corresponds to what is expected in a 2D picture, scaling with thickness corresponds to a 3D picture. We argue that this behavior indicates a 2+1D situation, in which the relevant coherence length along the thickness of the film has no temperature dependence. We find no visible discontinuity in the temperature dependence of the Nernst conductivity across T$_c$. Explaining how the response of the superconducting vortices evolves to the one above the critical temperature of short-lived Cooper pairs emerges as a challenge to the theory.

Title: Frequency as a Clock: Synchronization and Intrinsic Recovery in Graphene Transistor Dynamics
Authors: Victor Lopez-Richard, Igor Ricardo Filgueira e Silva, Gabriel L. Rodrigues, Rafael Furlan de Oliveira, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Alisson R. Cadore
Abstract: Hysteresis and memory effects in graphene field-effect transistors (GFETs) offer unique opportunities for neuromorphic computing, sensing, and memory applications, yet their physical origins remain debated due to competing volatile and nonvolatile interpretations. Here, we present a unified dynamic model that captures the essential physics of the GFET response under periodic gate modulation, accounting for both intrinsic relaxation processes and externally driven charge transfer. By modeling non-equilibrium carrier dynamics as a competition between injection and reabsorption rates, we uncover two distinct regimes: one governed by intrinsic, frequency-independent relaxation and another exhibiting frequency-locked behavior where the response is tied to the external drive. This distinction resolves apparent nonvolatile effects and explains loop invariance in floating-gate structures via displacement current-driven charge injection. Our framework predicts the evolution of the hysteresis loop shape, amplitude, and direction across a wide range of driving conditions, offering a versatile tool for interpreting experimental results and guiding the design of next-generation graphene-based electronic systems.

Title: Scaling, Fractal Dynamics and Critical Exponents: Application in a non-integer dimensional Ising model
Authors: Henrique A. de Lima, Ismael S. S. Carrasco, Marcio Santos, Fernando A. Oliveira
Abstract: Moving beyond simple associations, researchers need tools to quantify how variables influence each other in space and time. Correlation functions provide a mathematical framework for characterizing these essential dependencies, revealing insights into causality, structure, and hidden patterns within complex systems. In physical systems with many degrees of freedom, such as gases, liquids, and solids, a statistical analysis of these correlations is essential. For a field $\Psi(\vec{x},t)$ that depends on spatial position $\vec{x}$ and time $t$, it is often necessary to understand the correlation with itself at another position and time $\Psi(\vec{x}_0,t_0)$. This specific function is called the autocorrelation function. In this context, the autocorrelation function for order--parameter fluctuations, introduced by Fisher, provides an important mathematical framework for understanding the second-order phase transition at equilibrium. However, his analysis is restricted to a Euclidean space of dimension $d$, and an exponent $\eta$ is introduced to correct the spatial behavior of the correlation function at $T=T_c$. In recent work, Lima et al demonstrated that at $T_c$ a fractal analysis is necessary for a complete description of the correlation function. In this study, we investigate the fundamental physics and mathematics underlying phase transitions. In particular, we show that the application of modern fractional differentials allows us to write down an equation for the correlation function that recovers the correct exponents below the upper critical dimension. We obtain the exact expression for the Fisher exponent $\eta$. Furthermore, we examine the Rushbrooke scaling relation, which has been questioned in certain magnetic systems, and, drawing on results from the Ising model, we confirm that both our relations and the Rushbrooke scaling law hold even when $d$ is not an integer.

Title: The Hilbert-space structure of free fermions in disguise
Authors: Eric Vernier, Lorenzo Piroli
Abstract: Free fermions in disguise (FFD) Hamiltonians describe spin chains which can be mapped to free fermions, but not via a Jordan-Wigner transformation. Although the mapping gives access to the full Hamiltonian spectrum, the computation of spin correlation functions is generally hard. Indeed, the dictionary between states in the spin and free-fermion Hilbert spaces is highly non-trivial, due to the non-linear and non-local nature of the mapping, as well as the exponential degeneracy of the Hamiltonian eigenspaces. In this work, we provide a series of results characterizing the Hilbert space associated to FFD Hamiltonians. We focus on the original model introduced by Paul Fendley and show that the corresponding Hilbert space admits the exact factorization $\mathcal{H}=\mathcal{H}_F\otimes \mathcal{H}_D$, where $\mathcal{H}_F$ hosts the fermionic operators, while $\mathcal{H}_D$ accounts for the exponential degeneracy of the energy eigenspaces. By constructing a family of spin operators generating the operator algebra supported on $\mathcal{H}_D$, we further show that $\mathcal{H}_D=\mathcal{H}_{F'}\otimes \mathcal{H}_{\widetilde{D}}$, where $\mathcal{H}_{F'}$ hosts ancillary free fermions in disguise, while $\mathcal{H}_{\widetilde{D}}$ is generated by the common eigenstates of an extensive set of commuting Pauli strings. Our construction allows us to fully resolve the exponential degeneracy of all Hamiltonian eigenspaces and is expected to have implications for the computation of spin correlation functions, both in and out of equilibrium.

Title: Proposal for realizing Heisenberg-type quantum-spin models in Rydberg atom quantum simulators
Authors: Masaya Kunimi, Takafumi Tomita
Abstract: We investigate the magnetic-field dependence of the interaction between two Rydberg atoms, $|nS_{1/2}, m_J\rangle$ and $|(n+1)S_{1/2}, m_J\rangle$. In this setting, the effective spin-1/2 Hamiltonian takes the form of an {\it XXZ} model. We show that the anisotropy parameter of the {\it XXZ} model can be tuned by applying a magnetic field, and in particular, that it changes drastically near the Förster resonance points. Based on this result, we propose experimental realizations of spin-1/2 and spin-1 Heisenberg-type quantum spin models in Rydberg atom quantum simulators, without relying on Floquet engineering. Our results provide guidance for future experiments of Rydberg atom quantum simulators and offer insight into quantum many-body phenomena emerging in the Heisenberg model.

Title: In-plane and interlayer magnetoresistance in FeSe
Authors: Taichi Terashima, Shinya Uji, Hiroaki Ikeda, Yuji Matsuda, Takasada Shibauchi, Shigeru Kasahara
Abstract: We report measurements of the in-plane and interlayer magnetoresistances of FeSe. The in-plane magnetoresistance $\Delta \rho_{ab}/\rho_{ab}(0)$ for $B \parallel c$ is positive below $T_s$ and increases with decreasing temperature, exceeding 2.5 at $T$ = 10 K and $B$ = 14 T. The field-direction dependence indicates that the in-plane magnetoresistance is basically determined by the $c$-axis component of the magnetic field. The interlayer magnetoresistance $\Delta \rho_{c}/\rho_{c}(0)$ is negative below $T_s$ but turns positive below $\sim$18 K, which is probably due to the contamination by the large in-plane magnetoresistance. The field-direction dependence of the interlayer magnetoresistance can approximately be described by a standard formula for quasi-two-dimensional electron systems except near $B \parallel ab$. The experimental magnetoresistance near $B \parallel ab$ is larger than the formula, which can be attributed to the so-called interlayer coherence peak. The large width of the peak indicates the correspondingly large interlayer transfer energy.

Title: Unveiling the Lithium-Ion Transport Mechanism in Li2ZrCl6 Solid-State Electrolyte via Deep Learning-Accelerated Molecular Dynamics Simulations
Authors: Hanzeng Guo, Volodymyr Koverga, Selva Chandrasekaran Selvaraj, Anh T. Ngo
Abstract: Lithium zirconium chlorides (LZCs) present a promising class of cost-effective solid electrolyte for next-generation all-solid-state batteries. The unique crystal structure of LZCs plays a crucial role in facilitating lithium-ion mobility, which further affects its electrochemical performance. To understand the underlying mechanism governing ion transport, we employed deep learning-accelerated molecular dynamics simulation on Li2ZrCl6 (trigonal {\alpha}- and monoclinic \b{eta}-LZC), focusing specifically on the zirconium coordination environment. Our results reveal that disordered {\alpha}-LZC exhibits the highest ionic conductivity, while \b{eta}-LZC demonstrates significantly lower conductivity, closely aligning with experimental findings. The study confirms that across all phases, lithium migration proceeds via site-to-site hopping mechanism, where variations in site residence times critically impact the overall ionic conductivity. In {\alpha}-LZCs, lithium ions prefer to anisotropically diffuse across interlayers as the result of lower energy barrier, driven primarily by collective diffusion. In contrast, lithium ions in \b{eta}-LZC primarily isotropically diffuse within intralayer, hindered by higher energy barriers and determined by individual diffusion. The variation in ZrCl62- octahedral unit softening, induced by the specific layered arrangement of zirconium atoms, emerges as a critical determinant of the energy barriers across the LZC phases. These atomic-scale insights into the transport processes provide valuable guidance for the rational design and optimization of LZCs-based electrolytes, accelerating their practical application in advanced energy storage technologies.

Title: Machine Learning H-theorem
Authors: Ruben Lier
Abstract: H-theorem provides a microscopic foundation of the Second Law of Thermodynamics and is therefore essential to establishing statistical physics, but at the same time, H-theorem has been subject to controversy that in part persists till this day. To better understand H-theorem and its relation to the arrow of time, we study the equilibration of randomly oriented and positioned hard disks with periodic boundary conditions. Using a model based on the DeepSets architecture, which imposes permutation invariance of the particle labels, we train a model to capture the irreversibility of the H-functional.

Title: Quantum Interference Supernodes, Thermoelectric Enhancement, and the Role of Dephasing
Authors: Justin P. Bergfield
Abstract: Quantum interference (QI) can strongly enhance thermoelectric response, with higher-order "supernodes" predicted to yield scalable gains in thermopower and efficiency. A central question, however, is whether such features are intrinsically more fragile to dephasing. Using $Büttiker$ voltage-temperature probes, we establish an order-selection rule: the effective near-node order is set by the lowest among coherent and probe-assisted channels. Supernodes are therefore fragile in an absolute sense because their transmission is parametrically suppressed with order. However, once an incoherent floor dominates, the fractional suppression of thermopower, efficiency, and figure of merit becomes universal and order-independent. Illustrating these principles with benzene- and biphenyl-based junction calculations, we show that the geometry of environmental coupling -- through a single orbital or across many -- dictates whether coherence is lost by order reduction or by floor building. These results yield general scaling rules for the thermoelectric response of interference nodes under dephasing.

Title: Sharp transitions in small exciton spectra for multi-orbital lattice systems

Abstract: We demonstrate that strongly bound excitons, whose radii approach the lattice constant, display physics that eludes continuum descriptions not just quantitatively but qualitatively. We investigate such phenomenology by calculating the exciton spectra for several one- and two-dimensional lattice models, whose valence band has a multi-orbital character. We identify sharp transitions in the character and momentum of the lowest-energy exciton, driven directly by the multi-orbital nature of the lattice models. Such transitions cannot occur in simple continuum descriptions.

Title: Resonant current-in-plane spin-torque diode effect in magnet$-$normal metal bilayers
Authors: Ulli Gems, Oliver Franke, Piet W. Brouwer
Abstract: Via the spin-Hall effect and its inverse, in-plane charge currents in a normal metal$-$ferromagnet (N$|$F) bilayer can be used to excite and detect magnetization dynamics in F. Using a magneto-electric circuit approach, we here consider the current response to quadratic order in the applied electric field, which is resonantly enhanced for driving frequencies close to frequencies of coherent magnetization modes. Our theory can be applied to bilayers with a magnetic insulator or with a magnetic metal. It focuses on the contribution of coherent magnetization dynamics to spin currents collinear with the equilibrium magnetization direction, but also takes into account relaxation of spin accumulation via spin currents carried by incoherent magnons and conduction electrons in F.

Title: Symmetry restoration in a fast scrambling system
Authors: Sizheng Cao, Xian-Hui Ge
Abstract: Entanglement asymmetry -- used here as a direct probe of symmetry restoration -- provides a sharp diagnostic of post-quench dynamics. We test this idea in the complex Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev model with a conserved U(1) charge. Using exact diagonalization, we track the joint evolution of entanglement entropy and entanglement asymmetry after quenches from charge-asymmetric product states. We find rapid volume-law entanglement growth consistent with the subsystem eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, accompanied by a concurrent decay of entanglement asymmetry to a late-time plateau set by finite-size effects: small subsystems display near-complete restoration, while residual cross-sector weight yields a finite plateau. Notably, we uncover a quantum Mpemba effect: states prepared further from symmetry relax faster and approach lower residual asymmetry; disorder in the couplings renders this behavior more robust and monotonic across parameters. We further derive a Pinsker-type lower bound that ties the decay of asymmetry to differences in subsystem purity, identifying dephasing between U(1) charge sectors as the operative mechanism. These results establish entanglement asymmetry as a sensitive probe of symmetry restoration and thermalization, clarifying finite-size limits in fast-scrambling, closed quantum systems.

Title: Superdiffusion and antidiffusion in an aligned active suspension
Authors: Lokrshi Prawar Dadhichi, Suvendra K. Sahoo, K. Vijay Kumar, Sriram Ramaswamy
Abstract: We show theoretically that an imposed uniaxial anisotropy leads to new universality classes for the dynamics of active particles suspended in a viscous fluid. In the homogeneous state, their concentration relaxes superdiffusively, stirred by the long-ranged flows generated by its own fluctuations, as confirmed by our numerical simulations. Increasing activity leads to an anisotropic diffusive instability, driven by an active contribution to the particle current proportional to the local curvature of the suspension velocity profile.

Title: Refined spin Hamiltonian on the Cairo pentagonal lattice of Bi2Fe4O9

Abstract: The frustrated magnet Bi2Fe4O9 has been reported to exhibit complex spin dynamics coexisting with conventional spin wave excitations. The magnetic Fe3+ (S = 5/2) ions are arranged into a distorted two-dimensional Cairo pentagonal lattice with weak couplings between the layers, developing long-ranged non-collinear antiferromagnetic order below 245 K. In order to enable studies and modelling of the complex dynamics close to TN, we have reexamined the magnetic excitations across the complete energy scale (0 < E < 90 meV) at 10 K. We discover two distinct gaps, which can be explained by introducing, respectively, easy axis and easy plane anisotropy on the two unequivalent Fe-sites. We develop a refined spin Hamiltonian that accurately accounts for the dispersion of essentially all spin-wave branches across the full spectral range, except around 40 meV, where a splitting and dispersion are observed. We propose that this mode is derived from phonon hybridization. Polarisation analysis shows that the system has magnetic anisotropic fluctuations, consistent with our model. A continuum of scattering is observed above the spin wave branches and is found to principally be explained by an instrumental resolution effect. The full experimental mapping of the excitation spectrum and the refined spin Hamiltonian provides a foundation for future quantitative studies of spin waves coexisting with unconventional magnetic fluctuations in this frustrated magnet found at higher temperatures.

Title: Unveiling the physical attributes of CdGa2Te4 and ZnGa2Te4 compounds: A first-principles study for next-generation photovoltaics
Authors: Md Hasan Shahriar Rifat, Tanvir Khan, Md Arafat Hossain Shourov, Md Sahat Bin Sayed, Md Saiful Islam
Abstract: The electronic and optical properties of CdGa2Te4 and ZnGa2Te4 were studied using first-principles DFT calculations. Band gaps were calculated using the GGA-PBESol functional. Both materials show promise for photovoltaic applications because of their large, near-unity absorption efficiencies (10^4 cm^-1) in the visible region. They exhibit low exciton binding energies (18.85-26.81 meV), large Bohr radii (23-34.3 Angstrom), and moderate exciton temperatures (218-311 K), which are favorable for photovoltaic applications. Their performance as solar cells was simulated using the SCAPS-1D tool for thin-film devices with Pt/CdS/CdGa2Te4/Cu2O/Ti and Pt/CdS/ZnGa2Te4/Cu2O/Ti structures. We investigated the effects of layer thickness, donor and acceptor concentrations (shallow donors/acceptors), and defect density on device performance. The ideal absorber thickness for XGa2Te4 (X = Cd, Zn) was found to be 1000-1800 nm, and the CdS buffer layer around 150 nm. To obtain an efficiency above 20%, the defect density in the CdGa2Te4 and ZnGa2Te4 absorber layers should be kept below 1.772 x 10^13 cm^-3. The best simulations show efficiencies of 18.46% and 17.35% for CdGa2Te4- and ZnGa2Te4-based solar cells, respectively.

Title: Controlling Collective Phenomena Via the Quantum State of Interaction-Mediators: Changing the Criticality of Photon-Mediated Superconductivity Via Fock States of Light
Authors: Ahana Chakraborty, Michele Pini, Martina S. Zündel, Francesco Piazza
Abstract: How are two-body scattering and the resulting collective phenomena affected by preparing the mediator of interactions in different quantum states? This question has recently become experimentally relevant in a specific non-relativistic version of QED implemented within materials, where standard techniques of quantum optics are available for the preparation of desired quantum states of the photon mediating interactions between matter's constituents. We develop the necessary non-equilibrium approach for computing the vertex function and find that, in addition to the energy and momentum structure of the scattering, a further structure emerges which reflects the Hilbert-space distribution of the mediator's quantum state. This emergent structure becomes non-trivial for non-Gaussian quantum states of the mediator, and can dramatically affect scattering and collective phenomena. As a first application, we show that by preparing photons in pure Fock states one can enhance pair correlations, and even modify the criticality of the superconducting phase transition. Our results also reveal that the thermal mixture of Fock states regularises the strong pair correlations present in each of its components, yielding the standard Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer criticality. Besides the above QED platform, ultracold atomic mixtures are among the most promising candidates for the experimental implementation of these ideas.

Title: A single-phonon directional coupler
Authors: Amirparsa Zivari, Niccolò Fiaschi, Lorenzo Scarpelli, Menno Jansen, Roel Burgwal, Ewold Verhagen, Simon Gröblacher
Abstract: Integrated photonics has revolutionized fields such as telecommunications, quantum optics, and metrology by enabling compact, scalable circuits through highly confined optical modes. Within the field of quantum acoustics, phonons have emerged as a compelling alternative, offering advantages such as lower energy, smaller mode volume, and low propagation speeds, which make them ideal for interfacing diverse quantum systems. Developing integrated phononic circuits is thus essential for unlocking the full potential of quantum acoustics and advancing technologies such as quantum computing and hybrid systems. In this work, we demonstrate the first 4-port directional coupler for quantum mechanical excitations - a key building block for phononic circuits. By tuning the coupling region length, we achieve phononic beam splitters with controllable splitting ratios. We validate quantum-level performance by sending a single-phonon Fock state through the device. This work represents a foundational advance toward scalable, integrated phononic platforms for both classical and quantum applications.

Title: The generic temperature response of large biochemical networks
Authors: Julian B. Voits, Ulrich S. Schwarz (Heidelberg University)
Abstract: Biological systems are remarkably susceptible to relatively small temperature changes. The most obvious example is fever, when a modest rise in body temperature of only few Kelvin has strong effects on our immune system and how it fights pathogens. Another very important example is climate change, when even smaller temperature changes lead to dramatic shifts in ecosystems. Although it is generally accepted that the main effect of an increase in temperature is the acceleration of biochemical reactions according to the Arrhenius equation, it is not clear how it affects large biochemical networks with complicated architectures. For developmental systems like fly and frog, it has been shown that the system response to temperature deviates in a characteristic manner from the linear Arrhenius plot of single reactions, but a rigorous explanation has not been given yet. Here we use a graph-theoretical interpretation of the mean first-passage times of a biochemical master equation to give a statistical description. We find that in the limit of large system size and if the network has a bias towards a target state, then the Arrhenius plot is generically quadratic, in excellent agreement with numerical simulations for large networks as well as with experimental data for developmental times in fly and frog. We also discuss under which conditions this generic response can be violated, for example for linear chains, which have only one spanning tree.

Title: Super-resolved anomalous diffusion: deciphering the joint distribution of anomalous exponent and diffusion coefficient
Authors: Yann Lanoiselée, Gianni Pagnini, Agnieszka Wyłomańska
Abstract: The molecular motion in heterogeneous media displays anomalous diffusion by the mean-squared displacement $\langle X^2(t) \rangle = 2 D t^\alpha$. Motivated by experiments reporting populations of the anomalous diffusion parameters $\alpha$ and $D$, we aim to disentangle their respective contributions to the observed variability when this last is due to a true population of these parameters and when it arises due to finite-duration recordings. We introduce estimators of the anomalous diffusion parameters on the basis of the time-averaged mean squared displacement and study their statistical properties. By using a copula approach, we derive a formula for the joint density function of their estimations conditioned on their actual values. The methodology introduced is indeed universal, it is valid for any Gaussian process and can be applied to any quadratic time-averaged statistics. We also explain the experimentally reported relation $D\propto\exp(\alpha c_1+c_2)$ for which we provide the exact expression. We finally compare our findings to numerical simulations of the fractional Brownian motion and quantify their accuracy by using the Hellinger distance.

Title: Deterministic Printing of Single Quantum Dots
Authors: Gregory G. Guymon, Hao A. Nguyen, David Sharp, Tommy Nguyen, Henry Lei, David S. Ginger, Kai-Mei C. Fu, Arka Majumdar, Brandi M. Cossairt, J. Devin MacKenzie
Abstract: The unique optical properties of quantum dots (QDs), size-tunable emission and high quantum yield, make them ideal candidates for applications in secure quantum communication, quantum computing, targeted single-cell and molecular tagging, and sensing. Scalable and deterministic heterointegration strategies for single QDs have, however, remained largely out of reach due to inherent material incompatibilities with conventional semiconductor manufacturing processes. To advance scalable photonic quantum device architectures, it is therefore crucial to adopt placement and heterointegration strategies that can address these challenges. Here, we present an electrohydrodynamic (EHD) printing model, single particle extraction electrodynamics (SPEED) printing, that exploits a novel regime of nanoscale dielectrophoretics to print and deterministically position single colloidal QDs. Using QDs solubilized in apolar solvents, this additive, zero-waste nanomanufacturing process overcomes continuum fluid surface energetics and stochastic imprecision that limited previous colloidal deposition strategies, achieving selective extraction and deposition of individual QDs at sub-zeptoliter volumes. Photoluminescence and autocorrelation function (g(2)) measurements confirm nanophotonic cavity-QD integration and single-photon emission from single printed QDs. By enabling deterministic placement of single quantum dots, this method provides a powerful, scalable, and sustainable platform for integrating complex photonic circuits and quantum light sources with nanoscale precision.

Title: Hovering of an actively driven fluid-lubricated foil
Authors: Stephane Poulain, Timo Koch, L. Mahadevan, Andreas Carlson
Abstract: Inspired by recent experimental observations of a harmonically excited elastic foil hovering near a wall while supporting substantial weight, we develop a theoretical framework that describes the underlying physical effects. Using elastohydrodynamic lubrication theory, we quantify how the dynamic deformation of the soft foil couples to the viscous fluid flow in the intervening gap. Our analysis shows that the soft foil rectifies the reversible forcing, breaking time-reversal symmetry; the relative spatial support of the forcing determines whether the sheet is attracted to or repelled from the wall. A simple scaling law predicts the time-averaged equilibrium hovering height and the maximum weight the sheet can sustain before detaching from the surface. Numerical simulations of the governing equation corroborate our theoretical predictions, are in qualitative agreement with experiments, and might explain the behavior of organisms while providing design principles for soft robotics.

Title: Quantum work statistics across a critical point: full crossover from sudden quench to the adiabatic limit
Authors: Zhanyu Ma, Andrew K. Mitchell, Eran Sela
Abstract: When an external parameter drives a system across a quantum phase transition at a finite rate, work is performed on the system and entropy is dissipated, due to the creation of excitations via the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. Although both the adiabatic and sudden-quench limits have been studied in detail, the quantum work statistics along the crossover connecting these limits has largely been an open question. Here we obtain exact scaling functions for the work statistics along the full crossover from adiabatic to sudden-quench limits for critical quantum impurity problems, by combining linear response theory, conformal field theory, and the numerical renormalization group. These predictions can be tested in charge-multichannel Kondo quantum dot devices, where the dissipated work corresponds to the creation of nontrivial excitations such as Majorana fermions or Fibonacci anyons.

Title: Onset of Quantum Chaos and Ergodicity in Spin Systems with Highly Degenerate Hilbert Spaces
Authors: Mahmoud Abdelshafy, Rubem Mondaini, Marcos Rigol
Abstract: We show that in systems with highly degenerate energy spectra, such as the 2D transverse-field Ising model (2DTFIM) in the strong-field limit, quantum chaos can emerge in finite systems for arbitrary small perturbations. In this regime, the presence of extensive quasiconserved quantities can prevent finite systems from becoming ergodic. We study the ensuing crossover to ergodicity in a family of models that includes the 2DTFIM, in which the onset of ergodic behavior exhibits universality and occurs for perturbation strengths that decrease polynomially with increasing system size. We discuss the behaviors of quantum chaos indicators, such as level spacing statistics and bipartite entanglement, and of the fidelity susceptibilities and spectral functions across the crossover.

Title: Non-equilibrium charge-vortex duality
Authors: Lazaros Tsaloukidis, Francisco Peña-Benítez, Piotr Surówka
Abstract: Traditionally applied within equilibrium states, the charge-vortex dualities are expanded to address the complex dynamics of superfluids and ideal fluids under non-static conditions. We have constructed explicit mappings of finite temperature fluid dynamics to gauge theories, enabling a dual description where vortices in both superfluids and ideal fluids are interpreted as charges within these theories. We found that vortices in the normal component naturally exhibit mobility restrictions, as manifested by the symmetries and conservation laws. Next, we formulated the Liénard-Wiechert problem for the ideal fluid at finite temperature and extracted the wave dynamics in the system along with the speed of sound corrections for both fluid components. Finally, we computed the correlation functions for the gauge potentials, particularly elucidating explicit cross-correlations between the normal and superfluid components.

Title: Near-extremal holographic charge correlators
Authors: Blaise Goutéraux, David M. Ramirez, Mikel Sanchez-Garitaonandia, Clément Supiot
Abstract: We analytically compute the low-temperature charge correlators in near-extremal black holes with a planar horizon and an infrared $\mathrm{AdS}_2\times \Bbb{R}^2$ extremal geometry, finding excellent agreement with numerical calculations. The analytical result consistently describes the crossover between the hydrodynamic diffusive regime at low frequencies and wavenumbers, and the quantum, zero-temperature regime at high frequencies and wavenumbers. We analytically resolve the successive collisions between the diffusive pole and the non-hydrodynamic poles sourced by the infrared $\mathrm{AdS}_2\times \Bbb{R}^2$ geometry. We demonstrate that in the $T=0$ limit, a pair of gapless poles survive with a dispersion relation $\omega_\pm=-i d_2 k^2-i d_4 k^4-i\tilde d_4 k^4(\pm i\pi+\log k^2) $. The nonanalytic contributions arise from the interplay with the branch cut formed by the condensation of the non-hydrodynamic poles. The real part is caused by the `snatching' of one of the non-hydrodynamic poles by the hydrodynamic diffusive pole.

Title: Probing forced responses and causal mechanisms in large-scale climate dynamics with reduced-order neural models
Authors: Fabrizio Falasca
Abstract: A central challenge in climate science and applied mathematics is developing data-driven models of multiscale systems that capture not only stationary statistics but also responses to external perturbations. Current neural climate emulators seek to resolve the atmosphere-ocean system in all its complexity but often fail to reproduce forced responses, limiting their use in causal studies such as Green's function experiments. Response theory offers a rigorous framework to explore these limitations, moving beyond stationary statistics, probing causal mechanisms, and guiding model design. Using a simplified multiscale system, we argue that the skill of purely data-driven models in reproducing perturbed statistics depends critically on (i) identifying the proper variables to model, including spatial and temporal scales, and (ii) accurate stochastic parameterizations of unresolved processes. For studies of low-frequency climate dynamics, these insights motivate reduced-order neural models, tailored to specific processes, as valuable alternatives to general-purpose emulators. We illustrate this perspective with a reduced-order neural stochastic model designed to investigate responses of radiative fluxes to surface temperature perturbations. The model largely reproduces stationary statistics and enables the study of forced responses in both ensemble mean and variance, shifting the study of climate feedbacks from single trajectories to responses of probability distributions. These results underscore reduced-order models, augmented with modern neural networks and evaluated within the framework of response theory, as a practical strategy for causal inference and attribution studies in large-scale climate dynamics.

Title: Generation of a scalar vortex in a rotational frame
Authors: M. Bordag, D. N. Voskresensky
Abstract: We consider generation from the vacuum of a scalar charged field in a rigidly rotating frame. Adding an external magnetic field opens the way to Bose condensation of the field. This phenomenon has been studied for external uniform magnetic field occupying the whole volume of the uniformly rotating cylindrical system of finite radius $R$ with a Dirichlet boundary condition imposed on it. Besides continuing this study, we consider the field formed by a flux tube of small radius. We find numerical solutions of the Ginzburg-Pitaevskii equation for the charged scalar field, the critical rotation frequencies, the mean radii and the condensate energies, and compare them with those found in a linearization scheme and with approximate analytical solutions. We show that for the same input parameters the energy of the condensate in the case of the flux tube is lower than in the case of uniform magnetic field in the whole cylinder.

Title: Renormalization group for effective field theories: cutoff schemes and universality
Authors: Jose Gaite
Abstract: In effective field theories, the concept of renormalization of perturbative divergences is replaced by renormalization group concepts such as relevance and universality. Universality is related to cutoff scheme independence in renormalization. Three-dimensional scalar field theory with just the quartic coupling is universal but the less relevant sextic coupling introduces a cutoff scheme dependence, which we quantify by three independent parameters, in the two-loop order of perturbation theory. However, reasonable schemes only allow reduced ranges of those parameters, even contrasting the sharp cutoff with very smooth cutoffs. The sharp cutoff performs better. In any case, the effective field theory possesses some degree of universality even in the massive case (off criticality).

Title: Universal Precision Limits in General Open Quantum Systems
Authors: Tan Van Vu, Ryotaro Honma, Keiji Saito
Abstract: The intuition that the precision of observables is constrained by thermodynamic costs has recently been formalized through thermodynamic and kinetic uncertainty relations. While such trade-offs have been extensively studied in Markovian systems, corresponding constraints in the non-Markovian regime remain largely unexplored. In this Letter, we derive universal bounds on the precision of generic observables in open quantum systems that interact with their environments at arbitrary coupling strengths and are subjected to two-point measurements. By introducing an asymmetry term that quantifies the disparity between forward and backward processes, we show that the relative fluctuation of any time-antisymmetric current is constrained not only by entropy production but also by this asymmetry. For general observables, we further prove that their relative fluctuation is always bounded from below by a generalized activity term that characterizes environmental changes. These results establish a comprehensive framework for understanding the fundamental limits of precision in a broad class of open quantum systems, beyond the traditional Markovian setting.

Title: PT symmetry-enriched non-unitary criticality
Authors: Kuang-Hung Chou, Xue-Jia Yu, Po-Yao Chang
Abstract: The interplay between topology and quantum criticality gives rise to the notion of symmetry-enriched criticality, which has attracted considerable attention in recent years. However, its non-Hermitian counterpart remains largely unexplored. In this Letter, we show how parity-time (PT) symmetry enriches non-Hermitian critical points, giving rise to a topologically distinct non-unitary universality class. By analytically investigating non-Hermitian free fermion models with $PT$ symmetry, we uncover a new class of conformally invariant non-unitary critical points that host robust topological edge modes. Remarkably, the associated topological degeneracy is surprisingly encoded in the purely imaginary part of the entanglement entropy scaling-a feature absent in Hermitian systems. The underlying mechanism for the emergence of edge states at non-Hermitian criticality is traced to a generalized mass inversion that is absent in Hermitian systems.

Title: Higher-form (Quasi)Hydrodynamics from Holography: Deformations and Dualities
Authors: André Oliveira Pinheiro (Heriot-Watt University)
Abstract: We study the low-energy dynamics of systems with exact and approximate higher-form symmetries using gauge/gravity duality. These symmetries are realised holographically via Maxwell-type theories for massless and massive $p$-forms in AlAdS spacetimes. Double-trace deformations of the boundary theory are considered. While massless theories describe systems with conserved higher-form current, the massive case provides a controlled linearised framework for explicit symmetry breaking induced by defects and charged operators. We perform holographic renormalisation and establish a unified holographic dictionary across a broad theory space, parametrised by spacetime dimension, form rank, quantisation scheme and deformation scale. We compute thermal correlation functions in isotropic black brane backgrounds to characterise the hydrodynamic and quasihydrodynamic regimes of the dual boundary theories. Our analysis reveals a rich structure of relaxation dynamics, emergent photons and duality relations -- including the conventional electric-magnetic Hodge duality and its massive counterpart. These results extend bottom-up holography to include weakly broken higher-form symmetries and open avenues for exploring generalised self-duality constraints and new classes of deformed holographic duals.
