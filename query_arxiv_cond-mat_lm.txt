Title: Probing electronic transitions and defect-induced Urbach tail bands in functional perovskite oxides using diffuse reflectance
Authors: Ramachandran Balakrishnan, Priyambada Sahoo, Balamurugan Karuppannan, Ambesh Dixit
Abstract: We conducted a detailed study of electronic transitions and defects induced Urbach tail bands in various functional perovskite oxides (V2O5, BaSnO3, PbZr0.52Ti0.48O3, BiMnO3, and BiFeO3) using diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). We analyzed their DRS spectra using the Kubelka-Munk (KM) function, the Tauc plot, and the first derivative of the reflectance for a comparative study. BiMnO3 exhibits an electronic transition with indirect band gap energy, Eg = 0.92 eV. In contrast, all other functional perovskite oxides, namely bulk V2O5, BaSnO3, PbZr0.52Ti0.48O3, and BiFeO3, show direct band gap interband transitions, with Eg values of 2.27, 3.25, 3.10, and 2.48 eV, respectively. The estimated Urbach energy (EU) values related to the induced defects in these direct band gap functional oxides are approximately 0.24, 0.38, 0.25, and 0.48 eV, respectively. Moreover, a reduction in the band gap energy of multiferroic BiFeO3 was observed due to induced chemical pressure from (Ba, Ca) doping and a decrease in particle size. Importantly, the evaluated band gap and Urbach energies of the functional perovskite oxide materials obtained from the analyses of the first derivative of reflectance and the Tauc plot method align remarkably well with the values deduced using the Kubelka-Munk function theory. Effectively, we propose a comprehensive electronic band structure for the multiferroic BiFeO3, an important material for optoelectronic applications such as photovoltaic, photocatalytic, and photoferroelectric devices.

Title: Fractional diffusion without disorder in two dimensions
Authors: Nilotpal Chakraborty, Markus Heyl, Roderich Moessner
Abstract: We analyse how simple local constraints in two dimensions lead a defect to exhibit robust, non-transient, and tunable, subdiffusion. We uncover a rich dynamical phenomenology realised in ice- and dimer-type models. On the microscopic scale the path of a single defect exhibits anomalously long retractions, amounting to dynamical caging in a continuous-time random-walk framework, culminating in an effective fractional diffusion equation. Mapping to a height field yields an effective random walk subject to an emergent (entropic) logarithmic potential, whose strength is tunable, related to the exponent of algebraic ground-state correlations. The defect's path, viewed as non-equilibrium growth process, yields a frontier of fractal dimension of $5/4$, the value for a loop-erased random walk, rather than $4/3$ for simple and self-avoiding random walks. Such frustration/constraint-induced subdiffusion is expected to be relevant to platforms such as artificial spin ice and quantum simulators aiming to realize discrete link models and emergent gauge theories.

Title: Spin order, spin excitations, and RIXS spectra of spin-1/2 tetramer chains
Authors: Junli Li, Jun-Qing Cheng, Trinanjan Datta, Dao-Xin Yao
Abstract: We investigate the spin dynamics of a 1D spin-1/2 Heisenberg tetramer chain. Employing a combination of Density Matrix Renormalization Group, quantum renormalization group, and perturbation theory techniques, we compute the energy levels and the quantum phase diagram, analyze the phase transitions, and evaluate the $L$ and $K$ -edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) spectrum of fractionalized and collective (single and multi-particle) excitations. Our calculations suggest that the chain can transition between a hidden $Z_2\times Z_2$ discrete symmetry preserving tetramer phase and a Haldane phase with non-vanishing string order that breaks the hidden symmetry. These two gapped phases are intervened by an intermediate deconfined quantum critical state comprising of free spins and three-site doublets, which is a gapless critical phase with deconfined spinons. We find that the tetramer chain can support fractionalized (spinon) and collective (triplon and quinton) excitations. In the ferromagnetic intra-tetramer limit, the chain can support a quinton excitation which has a five-fold degenerate excited state. String order parameter calculations suggest CuInVO$_5$ to be in a Haldane-like phase whose $L$ -edge RIXS spectrum can support observable triplon and quinton excitations. We also identify possible two-particle excitations (two-singlon, two-triplon, triplon-quinton, and two-quinton excitations) resulting from the double spin-flip effect in the $K$ -edge RIXS spectrum.

Title: Antiferro octupolar order in the 5d$^1$ double perovskite Sr$_2$MgReO$_6$ and its spectroscopic signatures
Authors: Dario Fiore Mosca, Leonid V. Pourovskii
Abstract: "Hidden"-order phases with high-rank multipolar order parameters have been recently detected in several cubic double perovskites of 5$d$ transition metals. Here, by constructing and solving an ab initio low-energy Hamiltonian, we show that an antiferroic order of magnetic octupoles also forms in the tetragonal 5d$^1$ double perovskite Sr$_2$MgReO$_6$. The low-temperature order in this material is determined by a tetragonal crystal field dominating over exchange interactions. This results in a well isolated crystal-field doublet ground state hosting octupolar low-energy degrees of freedom. Very weak dipole moments entangled with the primary octupole order parameters are induced by admixture of the excited $j1/2$ spin-orbit multiplet. We show that the octupolar order leads to characteristic quasi-gapless magnetic excitation spectra as well as to the intensity of superstructural neutron diffraction reflexes peaking at large scattering momenta.

Title: Ultrafast Spontaneous Exciton Dissociation via Phonon Emission in BiVO$_4$
Authors: Stephen E. Gant, Antonios M. Alvertis, Christopher J. N. Coveney, Jonah B. Haber, Marina R. Filip, Jeffrey B. Neaton
Abstract: Monoclinic bismuth vanadate (m-BiVO$_4$) is a promising indirect band gap semiconductor for photoelectrochemical water splitting, yet the characteristics of its low-lying photoexcitations, or excitons, remain poorly understood. Here, we use an ab initio Bethe-Salpeter equation approach that incorporates phonon screening to compute the nature and lifetimes of the low-lying excitons of m-BiVO$_4$. Our calculations indicate that at 0 K, the lowest-lying exciton energy exceeds the indirect band gap, enabling spontaneous dissociation into free carriers via phonon emission within picoseconds. At 300 K, both phonon emission and absorption effects reduce this timescale to only a few femtoseconds. Phonon screening also greatly reduces the binding energy of the lowest-lying exciton, leading to an optical absorption spectrum that better reproduces experimental measurements. Overall, our findings establish the general conditions under which phonon emission-driven exciton dissociation can occur in indirect gap semiconductors, and they emphasize the critical role phonon screening can play in predictive calculations of photophysical properties of complex materials.

Title: Dynamical Generation of Higher-order Spin-Orbit Couplings, Topology and Persistent Spin Texture in Light-Irradiated Altermagnets
Authors: Sayed Ali Akbar Ghorashi, Qiang Li
Abstract: Altermagnets have been identified as the third category of magnetic materials, exhibiting momentum-dependent spin splitting characterized by even powers of momentum. In this study, we show that when subjected to elliptically polarized light, these materials serve as an exemplary framework for the dynamic generation of topological bands featuring higher-order spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Notably, while the generated Zeeman field remains invariant to the particular altermagnetic ordering, the induced higher-order SOCs are related to the magnitude and symmetry of the altermagnetic order. Specifically, we show that an altermagnet exhibiting $k^n$-spin splitting can generate spin-orbit couplings up to $k^{n-1}$. In the limit of circularly polarized light, the only correction is $k^{n-1}$, with all lower-order contributions being nullified. Interestingly, light-induced SOCs significantly impact the low-energy band topology, where their Chern numbers change by $\Delta C =\pm 1,2,3$ for $d,g,f$-wave altermagnets. Finally, we find a critical field in which a persistent spin texture is realized, a highly desirable state with predicted infinite spin lifetime. Our work showcases light as a powerful, controllable tool for engineering complex and exciting phenomena in altermagnets.

Title: $\textit{PY-BerryAHC}$: An $\textit{ab-initio}$ python 3 code to calculate Berry Curvature dependent Anomalous Hall Conductivity in any material
Authors: Vivek Pandey, Sudhir K. Pandey
Abstract: The anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) in materials has long been a topic of debate. Studies reveal that AHC originates from the Berry curvature ($\boldsymbol\Omega$) of Bloch states. Accurate computation of AHC is crucial for predicting material properties and guiding experimental studies in topological and spintronic applications. Traditional approaches often rely on wannier interpolation, which can introduce inaccuracies and computational overhead. Also, reliability of the wannierization technique becomes questionable when the bands are highly entangled and dispersive. This demands the calculation of AHC using the $\textit{first-principle}$ approach. Here, we present $\textit{PY-BerryAHC}$, a Python 3 based code that directly computes $\boldsymbol\Omega$ and AHC using WIEN2k output. Since, WIEN2k employs an all-electron full-potential linearized augmented plane wave method, $\textit{PY-BerryAHC}$ provides highly accurate AHC results. The code efficiently handles large $\textbf{k}$-grids by parallelizing $\boldsymbol\Omega$ computations over $\textbf{k}$-points. Also, it stores band-resolved $\boldsymbol\Omega$ in a binary file, thereby greatly reducing the required storage memory and allowing fast post-processing to compute AHC. $\textit{PY-BerryAHC}$ has been validated on well-known materials exhibiting AHC. These include- Fe, Fe$_3$Ge & Co$_2$FeAl. At 300 K, the calculated magnitude of $\sigma_{xy}$ for Fe & Fe$_3$Ge is found to be 744 $S/cm$ & 311 $S/cm$, respectively. For Co$_2$FeAl, the magnitude of $\sigma_{xy}$ is obtained to be $\sim$56 $S/cm$ and is found to be constant with the change in temperature from 0-300 K. These results are in good agreement with previously reported theoretical and experimental data. This ensures the accuracy, reliability and efficiency of the code. The code is also provided with a post-processing tool to visualize $\boldsymbol\Omega$.

Title: Topological Symmetry Breaking in Antagonistic Dynamics
Authors: Giulio Iannelli, Pablo Villegas, Tommaso Gili, Andrea Gabrielli
Abstract: A dynamic concordia discors, a finely tuned equilibrium between opposing forces, is hypothesized to drive historical transformations. Similarly, a precise interplay of excitation and inhibition, the 80:20 ratio, is at the basis of the normal functionality of neural systems. In artificial neural networks, reinforcement learning allows for fine-tuning internal signed connections, optimizing adaptive responses to complex stimuli, and ensuring robust performance. At present, engineered structures of competing components are, however, largely unexplored, particularly because their emergent phases are closely linked with frustration mechanisms in the hosting network. In this context, the spin glass theory has shown how an apparently uncontrollable non-ergodic chaotic behavior arises from the complex interplay of competing interactions and frustration among units, leading to multiple metastable states preventing the system from exploring all accessible configurations over time. Here, we tackle the problem of disentangling topology and dynamics in systems with antagonistic interactions. We make use of the signed Laplacian operator to demonstrate how fundamental topological defects in lattices and networks percolate, shaping the geometrical arena and complex energy landscape of the system. This unveils novel, highly robust multistable phases and establishes deep connections with spin glasses when thermal noise is considered, providing a natural topological and algebraic description of their still-unknown set of pure states at zero temperature.

Title: Emergence of universality in transport of noisy free fermions
Authors: João Costa, Pedro Ribeiro, Andrea De Luca
Abstract: We analyze the effects of various forms of noise on one-dimensional systems of non-interacting fermions. In the strong noise limit, we demonstrate, under mild assumptions, that the statistics of the fermionic correlation matrix in the thermodynamic limit follow a universal form described by the recently introduced quantum simple symmetric exclusion process (Q-SSEP). For charge transport, we show that Q-SSEP, along with all models in its universality class, shares the same large deviation function for the transferred charge as the classical SSEP model. The method we introduce to derive this result relies on a gauge-like invariance associated with the choice of the bond where the current is measured. This approach enables the explicit calculation of the cumulant generating function for both Q-SSEP and SSEP and establishes an exact correspondence between them. These analytical findings are validated by extensive numerical simulations. Our results establish that a wide range of noisy free-fermionic models share the same Q-SSEP universality class and show that their transport properties are essentially classical.

Title: Surface Sensitive Raman Response of Metal-Supported Monolayer MoS$_2$
Authors: Francesco Tumino, Sergio Tosoni, Paolo D'Agosta, Valeria Russo, Carlo Enrico Bottani, Andrea Li Bassi, Carlo Spartaco Casari
Abstract: The Raman spectrum of monolayer (ML) MoS$_2$ is remarkably affected by the interaction with metals. In this work we studied ML-MoS$_2$ supported by the Ag(111) and Ag(110) surfaces by using a combined experimental and theoretical approach. The MoS$_2$ layer was directly grown on atomically clean Ag(111) and Ag(110) surfaces by pulsed laser deposition, followed by in-situ thermal annealing under ultra-high vacuum conditions. The morphology and structure of the two systems were characterized in-situ by scanning tunneling microscopy, providing atomic-scale information on the relation between the MoS$_2$ lattice and the underlying surface. Raman spectroscopy revealed differences between the two MoS$_2$-metal interfaces, especially concerning the behavior of the out-of-plane $A'_1$ vibrational mode, which splits into two contributions on Ag(110). The metal-induced effects on MoS$_2$ vibrational modes are further evidenced by transferring MoS$_2$ onto a more inert substrate (SiO$_2$/Si), where the MoS$_2$ Raman response displays a more ``freestanding-like'' behavior. The experimental data were interpreted with the support of ab-initio calculations of the vibrational modes, which provided insight into the effect of interface properties, such as strain and out-of-plane distortion. Our results highlight the influence of the interaction with metals on MoS$_2$ vibrational properties, and show the high sensitivity of MoS$_2$ Raman modes to the surface structure of the supporting metal.

Title: SEMIDV: A Compact Semiconductor Device Simulator with Quantum Effects
Authors: Chien-Ting Tung
Abstract: In this paper, I present SEMIDV - a compact semiconductor device simulator incorporating quantum effects. SEMIDV solves the Poisson-Drift-Diffusion equations for semiconductor devices and provides a user-friendly Python interface for scripting and data analysis. Localization landscape theory is introduced to provide quantum corrections to the Drift-Diffusion equation. This theory directly solves the ground state of the Schrodinger equation without further approximation, offering an efficient solution for quantum effect modeling. Additionally, a compact mobility model considering ballistic transport is developed to capture the ballistic length dependence of mobility and the velocity overshoot effect in short-channel devices. Finally, a study on a nanosheet FET using SEMIDV is conducted. I analyze the electrical characteristics of a state-of-the-art GAA/RibbonFET with a 6 nm gate length and discuss the effects of velocity overshoot and quantum confinement on currents and capacitances. A design for an ultra-short-channel transistor with a gate length down to 4.5 nm with a Vdd = 0.45 V is proposed to push the boundaries of integrated circuit technology further.

Title: Interface-Generated Spin Current Induced Magnetoresistance in RuO2/Py Heterostructures
Authors: Akashdeep Akashdeep, Ewiese Mohammad Ababneh, Christin Schmitt, Edgar Galíndez-Ruales, Felix Fuhrmann, Timo Kuschel, Mathias Kläui, Vivek Pravin Amin, Gerhard Jakob
Abstract: Altermagnets, a recently discovered class of magnetic materials exhibiting ferromagnetic-like spin-split bands and antiferromagnetic-like compensated magnetic order, have attracted significant interest for next-generation spintronic applications. Ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) has emerged as a promising altermagnetic candidate due to its compensated antiparallel magnetic order and strong spin-split electronic bands. However, recent experimental and theoretical reports also suggest that RuO2 may be non-magnetic in its ground state, underscoring the need for deeper investigations into its magnetic character. Specifically, the (100)-oriented RuO2 films are expected to generate spin currents with transverse spin polarization parallel to the Néel vector. Here, we investigate magnetotransport in epitaxial RuO2/Permalloy (Py) heterostructures to examine spin Hall magnetoresistance and interfacial effects generated in such systems. Our measurements reveal a pronounced negative angular-dependent magnetoresistance for variation of magnetic field direction perpendicular to the charge current direction. Detailed temperature-, magnetic field-, and crystallographic orientation-dependent measurements indicate that interface-generated spin current (IGSC) at the RuO2/Py interface predominantly governs the observed magnetoresistance. This shows that strong interface effects dominate over possible altermagnetic contributions from RuO2. Our results show that the role of interface-generated spin currents is crucial and should not be overlooked in studies of altermagnetic systems. A critical step in this direction is disentangling interfacial from altermagnetic contributions. The insight into interfacial contributions from altermagnetic influences is essential for the advancement of RuO2 based spintronic memory and sensing applications.

Title: Modifications in the photoionization cross-section of a quantum dot with position-dependent effective mass
Authors: Carlos Magno O. Pereira, Denise Assafrão, Frankbelson dos S. Azevedo, A. G. de Lima, Cleverson Filgueiras, Edilberto O. Silva
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the photoionization cross-section of an electron confined in a quantum dot, considering the position-dependent variation of the effective mass through the parameter $\gamma$. We used a theoretical model based on the Schrödinger equation, in which $\gamma$ influences the energy levels and wave functions through an effective potential obtained from the harmonic oscillator potential - which, in the limit $\gamma = 0$, reduces to the original harmonic oscillator potential. Furthermore, we compared the modifications in the photoionization cross-section of these quantum systems with the constant-mass case. Our results demonstrate that even a small variation in $\gamma$ significantly impacts the photoionization process's amplitude and peak position. We also found that for specific values of $\gamma$, an inversion occurs: The amplitude, which initially increases as the quantum dot absorbs the photon, begins to decrease. Additionally, we observed that the optical transitions involving the ground state restrict the admissible values of $\gamma$ to negative values only. These results may have relevant implications for designing optoelectronic devices based on quantum dots with adjustable mass properties.

Title: Phase Transformation Kinetics Model for Metals
Authors: Daniel N. Blaschke, Abigail Hunter, Dean L. Preston
Abstract: We develop a new model for phase transformation kinetics in metals by generalizing the Levitas-Preston (LP) phase field model of martensite phase transformations (see Levitas and Preston (2002a,b); Levitas, Preston and Lee (2003)) to arbitrary pressure. Furthermore, we account for and track: the interface speed of the pressure driven phase transformation, properties of critical nuclei, as well as nucleation at grain sites and on dislocations and homogeneous nucleation. The volume fraction evolution of each phase is described by employing KJMA (Kolmogorov, 1937; Johnson and Mehl, 1939; Avrami, 1939, 1940, 1941) kinetic theory. We then test our new model for iron under ramp loading conditions and compare our predictions for the $\alpha\to\epsilon$ iron phase transition to experimental data of Smith et al. (2013). More than one combination of material and model parameters (such as dislocation density and interface speed) led to good agreement of our simulations to the experimental data, thus highlighting the importance of having accurate characterization data regarding the microstructure of the sample in question.

Title: A Clue on Small-Capacitance Josephson Junction: What to Expect from Cooper Pair Ideal Conductor and Ohmic Resistor in Parallel?
Authors: Francesco Giuseppe Capone, Antonio de Candia, Vittorio Cataudella, Naoto Nagaosa, Carmine Antonio Perroni, Giulio De Filippis
Abstract: By using analytical and Worldline Monte Carlo approaches, we investigate the effects induced by quantum phase fluctuations combined with quasiparticle subgap and shunt resistances on a small-capacitance Josephson junction. By using the linear response theory in the presence of two biasing schemes, we prove that the ideal conduction, foreseen in the pioneering papers on this topic, is not robust against either quantum phase fluctuations or dissipative effects. By including both of them in the Hamiltonian, we prove that an increase of the Ohmic dissipation strength induces a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless quantum phase transition in thermodynamic equilibrium. Then we study charge and phase fluctuations at the thermodynamic equilibrium within the linear response theory. We find that the phase particle motion, in a quantum Josephson junction, does not change from diffusive to localized, resulting in an insulator-superconductor transition, as is commonly believed. At the transition, we prove that: i) the motion of the phase particle changes from ballistic to localized; ii) by turning on the coupling with the environment, a long-lived excitation at finite frequency emerges in the charge response function: it evolves first into a resonance and then disappears at the transition. Consequences beyond the linear response regime are investigated, leading to an alternative comprehensive physical picture for this system: we predict a transition from a dissipative quasiparticle current to a polaronic Cooper pair current.

Title: Universal KPZ Fluctuations for Moderate Deviations of Random Walks in Random Environments
Authors: Jacob Hass, Hindy Drillick, Ivan Corwin, Eric Corwin
Abstract: The theory of diffusion seeks to describe the motion of particles in a chaotic environment. Classical theory models individual particles as independent random walkers, effectively forgetting that particles evolve together in the same environment. Random Walks in a Random Environment (RWRE) models treat the environment as a random space-time field that biases the motion of particles based on where they are in the environment. We provide a universality result for the moderate deviations of the transition probability of this model over a wide class of choices of random environments. In particular, we show the convergence of moments to those of the multiplicative noise stochastic heat equation (SHE), whose logarithm is the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation. The environment only filters into the scaling limit through one parameter, which depends explicitly on the statistical description of the environment. This forms the basis for our introduction, in arXiv:2406.17733, of the extreme diffusion coefficient.

Title: Interfaces in epitaxially grown Zn3P2 nanowires and their composition dependent optoelectronic properties for photovoltaic applications
Authors: Simon Escobar Steinvall, Francesco Salutari, Jonas Johansson, Ishika Das, Sebastian Lehmann, Stephen A. Church, M. Chiara Spadaro, Patrick Parkinson, Jordi Arbiol, Kimberly A. Dick
Abstract: Epitaxially grown nanowires have shown promise for photovoltaic applications due to their nanophotonic properties. Moreover, the mechanical properties of nanowires can reduce crystallographic defect formation at interfaces to help enable new material combinations for photovoltaics. One material that stands to benefit from the nanowire morphology is zinc phosphide (Zn3P2), which despite promising optoelectronic properties has experienced limited applicability due to challenges achieving heteroepitaxy, stemming from its large lattice parameter and coefficient of thermal expansion. Herein, we identify the requirements for successful epitaxy of Zn3P2 nanowires using metalorganic chemical vapour deposition and the impact on interface structure and defect formation. Furthermore, using high-throughput optical spectroscopy we were able to demonstrate shifts in the photoluminescence intensity and energy by tuning the V/II ratio during growth, highlighting the compositional tunability of the optoelectronic properties of Zn3P2 nanowires.

Title: Space-Charge Limited Schottky Diodes with Wide-Bandgap Thin-film Oxide Heterojunctions
Authors: Jihun Lim
Abstract: Non-crystalline thin-film Schottky diodes are cost-effective but often exhibit unreliable electrical characteristics due to material imperfections. In this work, I present a Schottky diode structure utilizing in-situ grown Ta2O5 and ZnO thin films deposited at room temperature. The low conduction band offset across the interface of the heterogeneous oxides facilitates efficient electron injection under forward bias. Capacitance-voltage characterization reveals a robust Schottky barrier at the Au/Ta2O5 interface without a significant barrier thinning effect, enabling high-voltage breakdown up to 65V and a high on/off ratio of 1X$10^8$. In demonstrations, the thin-film structure shows Schottky contact characteristics using even a relatively low work function metal of ITO, allowing the operation of transparent Schottky diodes. The diodes show additional potential for applications, including RF-to-DC conversion leveraging space charge capacitance at the Ta2O5/ZnO junction and rectifying resistive random access memory devices. This work highlights a promising approach for integrating low-cost, high-reliability Schottky diodes into back-end-of-line processes for wireless electronics and power devices.

Title: One-Dimensional Potassium Chains on Silicon Nanoribbons
Authors: Tongtong Chen, Wenjia Zhang, Xiaobei Wan, Xiaohan Zhang, Yashi Yin, Jinghao Qin, Fengxian Ma, Juntao Song, Ying Liu, Wen-Xiao Wang
Abstract: Silicon nanoribbons (SiNRs), characterized by a pentagonal structure composed of silicon atoms, host one-dimensional (1D) Dirac Fermions and serve as a minimalist atomic template for adsorbing various heteroatoms. Alkali-metal (AM) atoms, such as Na and K, with electronic structures comparable to those of hydrogen are of particular interest for such adsorption studies. However, the adsorption of AM atoms on SiNRs and its tunation on the properties of SiNRs have not yet been fully explored. In this study, we examined the adsorption of K atoms on high-aspect-ratio SiNRs and the resultant electronic properties using a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and density functional theory calculations. K atoms prefer to adsorb on double- and multi-stranded SiNRs owing to the low adsorption energies at these sites. Each K atom and its three nearest Si atoms exhibit a triangular morphology resulting from charge transfer between K and Si atoms, as verified by theoretical calculations. As the K coverage of the SiNRs increased, the K atoms organize into 1D zigzag chains on the SiNRs. Moreover, K adsorption on the SiNRs was determined to be reversible. The deposition of K atoms on the SiNRs was achieved using a voltage pulse of the STM tip, without damaging the SiNRs structure. In addition, K adsorption effectively modulates the Dirac cone position of the SiNRs relative to the Fermi level. This study unveils the adsorption mechanism of AM atoms on SiNRs, providing a useful approach for heteroatom adsorption on other nanoribbons.

Title: Chemical and Morphological Transformations of a Ag-Cu Nanocatalyst During CO2 Reduction Reaction
Authors: Gustavo Zottis Girotto, Maximilian Jaugstetter, Dongwoo Kim, Ruan M. Martins, André R. Muniz, Miquel Salmeron, Slavomir Nemsak, Fabiano Bernardi
Abstract: The conversion of CO2 into high-value chemicals through a photoreduction reaction in water is a promising route to reduce the dependence on fossil fuels. Ag nanoparticles can drive this reaction via localized surface plasmon resonance, but their low selectivity limits usage in industry. Enhancing selectivity toward hydrocarbons or alcohols requires addition of a co-catalyst such as Cu. However, the stabilized surface state created by Ag-Cu interactions is still poorly understood. In this work, soft x-ray Ambient-Pressure X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (AP-XPS) and Grazing-Incidence X-ray Scattering (AP-GIXS) were used to investigate the evolution of Ag-Cu nanoparticles under CO2RR-like conditions. AP-XPS revealed Ag and Cu surface and sub-surface diffusion, while AP-GIXS tracked change of shape and size of nanoparticles induced by diffusion mechanics. Under 532 nm laser irradiation, further oxidation of Cu and Ag sub-surface diffusion were observed, providing invaluable insights into the dynamic restructuring of the catalyst under reaction conditions.

Title: Turbulent diffusion and dispersion in a superfluid
Authors: Yuan Tang, Sosuke Inui, Yiming Xing, Yinghe Qi, Wei Guo
Abstract: Single-body diffusion and two-body dispersion are fundamental processes in classical turbulence, governing particle mixing and transport. However, their behaviors in superfluid turbulence remain largely unexplored. In this study, we numerically investigate the diffusion and relative dispersion of quantized vortices and superfluid parcels in the 0 K limit in two distinct turbulence regimes: ultra-quantum turbulence, characterized by a randomized vortex tangle, and quasiclassical turbulence, in which locally polarized vortices create large-scale flows resembling classical turbulence. Our results reveal that while vortex segments exhibit similar superdiffusion behavior at short times in both regimes, superfluid parcels behave differently: following the same superdiffusion scaling in ultra-quantum turbulence but deviating significantly in quasiclassical turbulence. This contrast provides a key clue to the origin of short-time superdiffusion, a puzzle since its recent discovery. Additionally, we show that two-body dispersion of both vortex segments and superfluid parcels exhibits distinct scaling behaviors in ultra-quantum and quasiclassical turbulence, highlighting fundamental differences in these two turbulence regimes. Our findings bridge a critical gap in superfluid turbulence research, offering new insights into turbulent transport in inviscid quantum fluids.

Title: Chemical Pressure Tuning of Multipolar and Magnetic Orders in Ba$_2$(Cd$_{1-x}$Ca$_x$)ReO$_6$ Double Perovskites
Authors: Koki Shibuya, Daigorou Hirai, Koshi Takenaka
Abstract: Double perovskite compounds containing 5d transition metal elements have been extensively studied as platforms for multipolar order phenomena stemming from spin-orbit-entangled 5d electrons. In this study, we examine the interplay between crystal structure, multipolar order, and magnetic order in solid solutions of double perovskites with the 5d1 electronic configuration: Ba2CdReO6 and Ba2CaReO6, which exhibit distinct electronic orders. The substitution of larger Ca2+ ions for Cd2+ in Ba2CdReO6, systematically increases the lattice constant with increasing the amount of substitution x. Although the spin-orbit-entangled J = 3/2 state remains intact upon substitution, both the quadrupolar order below Tq = 25 K and the canted antiferro-magnetic (AFM) order below Tm = 12 K in Ba2CdReO6 are progressively suppressed as x increases. Magnetization measurements reveal that the canted AFM order is suppressed at x = 0.6, transitioning to a colinear AFM order, while the quadrupolar order persists up to x = 0.9. The experimental electronic phase diagram, summarizing the dependence of electronic orders on lattice constants, aligns well with the theoretical phase diagram considering electric quadrupolar interactions [G. Chen et al., Phys. Rev. B 82, 174440 (2010)]. This correspondence confirms that chemical pressure induced by substitution effectively tunes the interaction between 5d electrons. The results highlight the potential of chemical pressure to modulate multipolar interactions, paving the way for novel multipolar properties in 5d electron systems.

Title: Stability analysis of Bose Gas: effect of external trapping and three-body interaction with Gross-Pitaevskii equation in Tonks-Girardeau regimes
Authors: R. Sasireka, O.T. Lekeufack, A. Uthayakumar, S. Sabari
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the stability aspects of quintic Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation with the presence and absence of external trapping potential for a Bose Gas (BG) in both the Tonks-Girardeau (TG) and the super Tonks-Girardeau (sTG) regimes. For this purpose, we compute both analytically and numerically a pure quintic GP equation with the presence of the scattering lengths. Using the time-dependent variational approach, we derive the equations of motion and effective potential of the system for both cases. Through the effective potential, we discuss the stability properties of pure quintic GP equation and obtain the modulational instability condition of BECs. The variational results are verified by means of direct numerical simulations using split-step Crank-Nicolson method and the observed results are in agreement with the analytical predictions.

Title: Fast reversal of Néel vectors in antiferromagnets via domain-wall motion driven by vertically injected spin currents
Authors: Jiaxin Du, Mei Li, Bin Xi, Xue Zhang, Yi Sun, Chun-Gui Duan, Jie Lu
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the steady propagation of 180-degree domain walls (180DWs) of Néel vectors in thin antiferromagnetic strips under perpendicularly injected spin currents with various polarization orientations. Our results show that only spin currents polarized normally to the strip plane guarantee a quick and steady rigid flow of 180DWs, thus realize a fast reversal of Néel vectors in antiferromagnets (AFMs). Different from the common ``current-in-plane'' geometry which is feasible only for metallic AFMs, our ``current-out-of-plane'' layout under investigation can further apply to insulating AFMs (which are more common in real applications) via quantum tunneling effect. Results from this work paves the way for fine control of Néel vectors in (both metallic and insulating) AFM strips and further development of novel magnetic nanodevices based on them.

Title: Polarization-dependent photocurrent in a quadrilateral-shaped bulk crystalline tellurium chip with near-infrared light excitation

Abstract: A circular polarization-dependent photocurrent is exclusively observed along the direction parallel to the helical axis in millimeter-sized quadrilateral-shaped bulk crystalline tellurium samples. The deterioration of the polarization-dependent character of unclear origin is also recorded. The estimate of the gyrotropic photoconductivity constant Betha in the context of the circular photogalvanic effect yields the value of approximately 5 micro-A/W based on experimental results obtained under a relatively weak excitation of 1.7 W/cm2. A comparison of this Betha value with those reported in previous studies is also discussed. Enhancement of Betha value may be achievable with bulk samples of superior crystalline quality.

Title: A Method to Suppress Polar Kerr Signal in a Longitudinal Magneto-Optic-Kerr-Effect Measurement
Authors: Ryan W. Greening, Elyssa D. DeVisscher, Xin Fan (Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Denver)
Abstract: The Magneto-Optical-Kerr-Effect (MOKE) is a convenient technique to study the magnetization of thin films. However, both polar and longitudinal MOKE responses contribute to the total Kerr response in a typical longitudinal MOKE measurement. Here, we present a simple optical technique to suppress the polar MOKE response in the oblique angle incidence by exploiting differences between polar and longitudinal MOKE responses upon double reflection from the sample. By using a mirror to reflect the beam and by selectively using a quarter waveplate, the polar or longitudinal MOKE signals can be suppressed, and therefore studied separately using the same oblique experimental setup. To demonstrate the feasibility of this technique, we use an out-of-plane magnetized Pt/Co/Pt film as well as a Pt/Co/Cu/NiFe Heterostructure with both in-plane and out-of-plane magnetization. We show that the polar MOKE of the CoPt film can be suppressed by a factor of 6 compared to a conventional MOKE measurement. By accounting for birefringence, we further reduce the polar MOKE response in a longitudinal MOKE measurement of the Pt/Co/Cu/NiFe film by over 160 times compared to a conventional oblique-angle MOKE measurement.

Title: Engineering living worms and active crystals with colloidal "feedback-pullers"
Authors: Sonja Tarama
Abstract: Using computer simulations, we study the dynamics of colloidal particles with time-delayed feedback interactions. In particular, here we consider "feedback-pullers", i.e.~colloidal particles that are pulled away from their current position towards an attractive ring centred around their past position. For a single particle, small rings lead to reduced diffusive motion while large rings render activity to the particle. For multiple particles, the particles not only feel their own attractive ring but are also attracted by the rings around all other particles. As expected, for ring sizes larger than the particle diameter, the feedback leads to crystallites whose lattice constant is set by the feedback ring radius. However, here we demonstrate that for long delays (compared to the Brownian time) the colloidal particles start to oscillate around their lattice positions, with the crystallites ultimately collapsing to a close-packed lattice whose lattice constant corresponds to the particle diameter. This effect is caused by the time delay between the particle misplacement within the lattice and the corresponding change in the feedback force. Further, we show that apart from the expected hexagonal crystallites, the time delay may result in the formation of uncommon new states in the case that the ring size is chosen slightly smaller than the particle diameter. Here, particles self-assemble into and move collaboratively as "living worms" or as active square-lattice crystallites.

Title: A dual-scale stochastic analysis framework for creep failure considering microstructural randomness
Authors: Weichen Kong, Yanwei Dai, Xiang Zhang, Yinghua Liu
Abstract: Creep failure under high temperatures is a complex multiscale and multi-mechanism issue involving inherent microstructural randomness. To investigate the effect of microstructures on the uniaxial/multiaxial creep failure, a dual-scale stochastic analysis framework is established to introduce the grain boundary (GB) characteristics into the macroscopic analysis. The nickel-base superalloy Inconel 617 is considered in this study. Firstly, the damage mechanisms of GBs are investigated based on the crystal plasticity finite element (CPFE) method and cohesive zone model (CZM). Subsequently, based on the obtained GB damage evolution, a novel Monte Carlo (MC) approach is proposed to establish the relationship between the GB orientation and area distribution and macroscopic creep damage. Finally, a dual-scale stochastic multiaxial creep damage model is established to incorporate the influence of the random GB orientation and area distribution. With the numerical application of the proposed creep damage model, the random initiation and growth of creep cracks in the uniaxial tensile specimen and the pressurized tube are captured and analyzed. The proposed stochastic framework effectively considers the inherent randomness introduced by GB characteristics and efficiently realizes full-field multiscale calculations. It also shows its potential applications in safety evaluation and life prediction of creep components and structures under high temperatures.

Title: Unifying Interpretations of Phase Transitions in the Vicsek Model: Correlation Length as a Diagnostic Tool
Authors: Wenhao Yu, Zinuo Li, Liufang Xu
Abstract: Vicsek Model is widely used in simulations of dry active matter. We re-examined two typical phase transitions in the original Vicsek model by using the velocity correlation length. One is the noise-driven disordered-to-ordered phase transition driven by noise, which was initially considered as a second-order transition (continuous transition), but was later demonstrated by Chate's detailed study to be a first-order transition. The other one is the disordered-to-ordered phase transition driven by average distance between particles, which is a second-order transition and satisfies the hyper-scaling relation of continuous transitions. We have discovered the change of correlation length during transition indicates a critical point in continuous transition while not in the discontinuous situation. We have also provided a method to classify phase transitions in active matter systems by using the correlation length and summarized previous work within the same framework. Finally, we end up with a potential application in experiments of bactirial swarms and robotic swarms. We hope our work paves the way for both theory and experiment development of active matter.

Title: Cascading symmetry constraint during machine learning-enabled structural search for sulfur induced Cu(111)-$(\sqrt{43}\times\sqrt{43})$ surface reconstruction
Authors: Florian Brix, Mads-Peter Verner Christiansen, Bjørk Hammer
Abstract: In this work, we investigate how exploiting symmetry when creating and modifying structural models may speed up global atomistic structure optimization. We propose a search strategy in which models start from high symmetry configurations and then gradually evolve into lower symmetry models. The algorithm is named cascading symmetry search and is shown to be highly efficient for a number of known surface reconstructions. We use our method for the sulfur induced Cu (111) $(\sqrt{43}\times\sqrt{43})$ surface reconstruction for which we identify a new highly stable structure which conforms with experimental evidence.

Title: Signatures of exceptional points in multiterminal superconductor-normal metal junctions
Authors: Oliver Solow, Karsten Flensberg
Abstract: We study a non-Hermitian, multiterminal superconducting-normal system in order to identify experimental signatures of exceptional points. We focus on a minimal setting with a single spinful level, spin-dependent normal leads, and a noncollinear magnetic field. This system hosts both topologically-protected, as well as symmetry-protected exceptional points. Using an exact transport formalism, we show that the exceptional points are visible through spectroscopy of the Andreev states, but that they have a minor effect on the Josephson current. We also argue that these findings hold with interactions.

Title: Exploring the role of four-phonon scattering in the lattice thermal transport of LaMoN$_3$
Authors: Manjari Jain, Sanchi Monga, Saswata Bhattacharya
Abstract: In this work, we systematically investigate the lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_L$) of LaMoN$_3$ in the $C$2/$c$ and $R$3$c$ phases using first-principles calculations combined with the Boltzmann transport equation. In the $C$2/$c$ phase, $\kappa_L$ exhibits strong anisotropy, with values of 0.75 W/mK, 1.89 W/mK, and 0.82 W/mK along the a, b, and c axes, respectively, at 300 K. In contrast, the $R$3$c$ phase shows nearly isotropic thermal conductivity, with values of 6.28 W/mK, 7.05 W/mK, and 7.31 W/mK along the a, b, and c directions. In both phases, acoustic phonons dominate thermal transport. However, in the $C$2/$c$ phase, the absence of an acoustic-optical gap results in increased three-phonon scattering leading to smaller values of $\kappa_L$. Additionally, four-phonon scattering plays a dominant role in the C2/c phase, reducing $\kappa_L$ by approximately 96\%, whereas in the $R3c$ phase, it leads to a smaller but still significant reduction of ~50\%. These results highlight the critical role of four-phonon interactions in determining the thermal transport properties of LaMoN$_3$ and reveal the stark contrast in thermal conductivity between its two structural phases.

Title: Light-driven modulation of proximity-enhanced functionalities in hybrid nano-scale systems

Abstract: Advancing quantum information and communication technology (qICT) requires smaller and faster components with actively controllable functionalities. This work presents a novel strategy for dynamically modulating magnetic properties via proximity effects controlled by light. We demonstrate this concept using hybrid nanoscale systems composed of C60 molecules proximitized to a cobalt metallic ferromagnetic surface, where proximity interactions are particularly strong. Our findings show that by inducing excitons in the C60 molecules with resonant ultrashort light pulses, we can significantly modify the interaction at the cobalt/C60 interface, leading to a striking 60% transient shift in the frequency of the dipolar ferromagnetic resonance mode of the Cobalt. This effect, detected via a specifically designed time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect (tr-MOKE) experiment, persists on a timescale of hundreds of picoseconds. Since this frequency shift directly correlates with a transient change in the anisotropy field (an essential parameter for technological applications) our findings establish a new paradigm for ultrafast optical control of magnetism at the nanoscale.

Title: Pressure-Induced Volume Collapse and Metallization in Inverse Spinel Co$_2$TiO$_4$
Authors: Mrinmay Sahu, Souvick Chakraborty, Bidisha Mukherjee, Bishnupada Ghosh, Asish Kumar Mishra, Satyabrata Raj, Goutam Dev Mukherjee
Abstract: The structural, vibrational, electronic, and magnetic properties of inverse spinel $Co_2TiO_4$ (CTO-Sp) under high pressure (HP) conditions are systematically investigated using X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, in situ optical microscopy, and first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations. At ambient conditions, CTO-Sp exhibits a cubic phase with a space group $Fd\bar{3}m$ and it undergoes two notable structural phase transitions at HP. The first transition, occurring at approximately 7.2 GPa, leads to the tetragonal-$I4_1/amd$ phase with minimal alteration in unit cell volume. Subsequently, a second transition to an orthorhombic phase with a mixed space group $Fddd$ and $Cmcm$ is observed around 17.3 GPa. This second structural transition corresponds to a first-order phase transition involving a significant reduction in unit cell volume of approximately 17.5$\%$. The bulk compressibility of CTO-Sp and its HP post-spinel phases is almost equal to the average polyhedral compressibility within each phase. The absence of Raman modes beyond 23 GPa is compelling evidence for metallization. DFT calculations reveal a high-spin to low-spin transition, accompanied by the collapse of local magnetic moments in the Cmcm orthorhombic phase, leading to the sample's pressure-induced metallization.

Title: Driving collective current excitations using light: The time-dependent $GW$ approach
Authors: Chin Shen Ong, Denis Golež, Angel Rubio, Olle Eriksson, Hugo U. R. Strand
Abstract: Electron-electron interactions in solids give rise to longitudinal collective charge excitations known as plasmons, which are observable corresponding to resonances in the density-density response function of the electrons. In this study, we demonstrate that current-current interactions can induce a novel type of collective excitation for systems of noninteracting and interacting electrons under nonequilibrium conditions, which we term as "curron". By taking into account the interaction between the vector potential generated by electronic currents and the vector potential driving them, we construct a system of interacting currents mediated by vector potentials. We show that this leads to the emergence of a quasiparticle associated with transverse collective current excitations, corresponding to resonances in the current-current response function. We account for electron-electron interaction by solving the Kadanoff-Baym equations within the non-equilibrium two-time GW approach using sodium metal as our prototypical metal.

Title: Dipolar-exchange spin waves in thin bilayers
Authors: Rob den Teuling, Ritesh Das, Artem V. Bondarenko, Elena V. Tartakovskaya, Gerrit E. W. Bauer, Yaroslav M. Blanter
Abstract: We investigate the dipolar-exchange spin wave spectrum in thin ferromagnetic bilayers with inplane magnetization, incorporating interlayer exchange coupling and intra- and interlayer dipolar interactions. In the continuum approximation we analyze the nonreciprocity of propagating magnetic stray fields emitted by spin waves as a function of the relative orientation of the layer magnetizations that are observable by magnetometry of synthetic antiferromagnets or weakly coupled type-A van der Waals antiferromagnetic bilayers as a function of an applied magnetic field.

Title: Complex magnetic exchange, anisotropy and skyrmionic textures in two-dimensional FeXZ$_{2}$ (\textit{X} = Nb, Ta and \textit{Z} = S, Se, Te) ferromagnets
Authors: Soheil Ershadrad, Nikola Machacova, Arnob Mukherjee, Vladislav Borisov, Olle Eriksson, Biplab Sanyal
Abstract: FeNbTe$_{2}$, long known as a van der Waals metallic system, has recently been resynthesized and shown to exhibit ferromagnetic order. In this study, using first-principles density functional theory (DFT), we aim to provide a deeper insight into the magnetic properties of FeNbTe$_{2}$ and its related compounds (FeXZ$_{2}$, \textit{X} = Nb, Ta; \textit{Z} = S, Se, Te), in their two-dimensional form, including their non-centrosymmetric Janus counterparts. Our results indicate that these materials are energetically, dynamically, thermally, and mechanically stable, supporting the possibility of FeNbTe$_{2}$ exfoliation and potential for experimental realization of new compounds. An evolutionary structure search suggests that FeNbTe$_{2}$ retains its monoclinic symmetry in the monolayer form. Our analysis of hopping parameters obtained from Wannierization of DFT bands shows that the nearest-neighbor magnetic interactions are primarily direct, while second-nearest and more distant interactions are mediated by the chalcogen atoms. Interestingly, although the second-nearest-neighbor interactions are smaller in magnitude, they appear to play a key role in determining the magnetic ordering in these systems. We also find evidence of canted magnetic anisotropy in FeXZ$_{2}$ compounds, with relatively strong magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy and easy-axis deviations of up to 41$^\circ$ from the out-of-plane direction-an uncommon and potentially useful feature for spintronic applications. Curie temperatures estimated from Monte Carlo simulations are below room temperature but above cryogenic levels for most compounds. Micromagnetic simulations revealed that Janus-structured FeNbSeTe can host Néel-type skyrmions even in the absence of an external magnetic field, making this compound a suitable candidate for further experimental studies.

Title: Single-gap two-band superconductivity well above the Pauli limit in non-centrosymmetric TaIr$_2$B$_2$

Abstract: Non-centrosymmetric superconducting materials represent an exciting class of novel superconductors featuring a variety of unconventional properties, including mixed-parity pairing and very high upper critical fields. Here, we present a comprehensive study of TaIr$_2$B$_2$ (with $T_c$ = 5.1 K), using a set of complementary experimental methods, including bulk- and surface-sensitive techniques. We provide evidence that this system is a two-band, yet it behaves as a single-gap superconductor with a strong coupling. The upper critical field of TaIr$_2$B$_2$ significantly exceeds the Pauli limit and exhibits a nearly linear temperature dependence down to the lowest temperatures. This behavior, rarely seen in superconductors, is discussed in terms of anti-symmetric spin-orbit interaction, two-band-, and strong-coupling effects, as well as disorder.

Title: Bridging-induced Aggregation in Neutral Polymers: Dynamics and Morphologies
Authors: Hitesh Garg, Satyavani Vemparala
Abstract: Using molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the aggregation behavior of neutral stiff (rod-like) and flexible polymer chains mediated by attractive crowders. Attractive crowders serve as bridging agents, inducing aggregation through effective intra-polymer attractions. The critical monomer-crowder attraction strength ($\epsilon_{mc}^*$) required for aggregation differs notably between rigid rods and flexible polymers. Interestingly, this aggregation threshold closely matches the critical attraction required for the extended-to-collapsed (coil-globule) transition of a single flexible polymer chain, suggesting a fundamental connection between single-chain collapse and multi-chain aggregation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that $\epsilon_{mc}^*$ decreases with increasing system density and larger crowder sizes, highlighting the synergistic roles of crowding effects and crowder dimensions. Aggregate morphologies exhibit strong dependence on polymer flexibility: rigid rods predominantly form elongated cylindrical bundles, whereas flexible polymers aggregate into compact spherical clusters. These findings provide comprehensive insights into how bridging interactions driven by attractive crowders regulate polymer aggregation dynamics and morphologies, emphasizing the importance of polymer rigidity, crowder size, and system density.

Title: Frustrated Bose ladder with extended range density-density interaction
Authors: Sourav Biswas, E. Rico, Tobias Grass
Abstract: When hard-core bosons on a two-leg ladder get frustrated by ring exchange interactions, the elusive d-wave Bose liquid (DBL) can be stabilized, a bosonic analog of a correlated metal. Here, we analyze the effect of extended Hubbard interactions on the DBL phase. Strikingly, these interactions are found to act in favor of the exotic Bose liquid. This observation is of immediate relevance for physical systems in which non-local exchange processes occur as a consequence of extended-range density-density interactions. Our observation also helps to achieve DBL physics in a synthetic-dimension ladder, where on-site interactions translate into non-local interactions along a synthetic rung. In this context, we also consider the extreme limit, in which the local hardcore constraint is elevated to an effective rung blockade. In addition to the enhancement of DBL physics due to extended-range density-density interactions, we also find signatures of an interesting intermediate phase between the superfluid and the DBL regime. This phase, labeled as the density modulated s-wave paired (DMSP) phase, combines features of density wave and s-wave pairing. Our results offer new insights into the physics of frustrated bosons by highlighting the influence of density-density interaction and rung-blockade.

Title: Multiple topological corner states in the continuum of extended kagome lattice
Authors: Shun-Peng Zhang, Ming-Jian Gao, Wei Jia, Jun-Hong An
Abstract: The kagome lattice is renowned for its exotic electronic properties, such as flat bands, Dirac points, and Van Hove singularities. These features have provided a fertile ground for exploring exotic quantum phenomena. Here, we discover that a breathing kagome lattice with long-range hoppings can host multiple zero-energy corner states, which emerge as topologically protected bound states in the continuum (BICs). This result demonstrates that additional hopping control can induce further non-trivial physics of the kagome lattice. Since the zero-energy corner states in the continuum are intertwined with a substantial number of zero-energy bulk states, we also develop a momentum-space topological characterization theory to precisely quantify the number of corner states, revealing a general bulk-corner correspondence. Furthermore, we uncover three distinct types of topological phase transitions (TPTs) for the BICs driven by shifts in the spatial localization of zero-energy bulk and/or edge states. These TPTs are exactly captured by our characterization theory. This work provides deep insights into the topological physics of the kagome lattice and broadens the understanding of its electronic properties

Title: Accelerated Inorganic Materials Design with Generative AI Agents
Authors: Izumi Takahara, Teruyasu Mizoguchi, Bang Liu
Abstract: Designing inorganic crystalline materials with tailored properties is critical to technological innovation, yet current generative computational methods often struggle to efficiently explore desired targets with sufficient interpretability. Here, we present MatAgent, a generative approach for inorganic materials discovery that harnesses the powerful reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). By combining a diffusion-based generative model for crystal structure estimation with a predictive model for property evaluation, MatAgent uses iterative, feedback-driven guidance to steer material exploration precisely toward user-defined targets. Integrated with external cognitive tools-including short-term memory, long-term memory, the periodic table, and a comprehensive materials knowledge base-MatAgent emulates human expert reasoning to vastly expand the accessible compositional space. Our results demonstrate that MatAgent robustly directs exploration toward desired properties while consistently achieving high compositional validity, uniqueness, and material novelty. This framework thus provides a highly interpretable, practical, and versatile AI-driven solution to accelerate the discovery and design of next-generation inorganic materials.

Title: Interaction Quench Dynamics and Stability of Quantum Vortices in Rotating Bose-Einstein Condensates
Authors: L. A. Machado, B. Chatterjee, M. A. Caracanhas, L. Madeira, V. S. Bagnato, B. Chakrabarti
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics of quantum vortices in a two-dimensional rotating Bose-Einstein condensate following an interaction quench. Using an ab initio and numerically exact quantum many-body approach, we systematically tune the interplay between interaction strength and angular velocity to prepare quantum vortices in various configurations and examine their post-quench dynamics. Our study reveals distinct dynamical regimes: First, vortex distortion accompanied by density cloud fragmentation, matching the initial vortex number and second, vortex revival, where fragmented densities interact and merge. Notably, we observe complete vortex revival dynamics in the single-vortex case, pseudo-revival in double and triple vortex configurations, and chaotic many-body dynamics in systems with multiple vortices. Our results reveal a universal out-of-equilibrium response of quantum vortices to interaction quenches, highlighting the importance of many-body effects with a possible exploration in quantum simulation with ultracold quantum fluids.

Title: Database of Tensorial Optical and Transport Properties of Materials From the Wannier Function Method
Authors: Zhenyao Fang, Ting-Wei Hsu, Qimin Yan
Abstract: The discovery and design of functional materials for energy harvesting and electronic applications require accurate predictions of their optical and transport properties. While several existing databases contain the first-order optical properties and the electron transport properties calculated from high-throughput first-principles calculations, the amount of material entries is often limited and those functional properties are often reported in scalar form. Comprehensive databases for the tensorial properties still remain inadequate, which prevents from capturing the anisotropic effect in materials and the development of advanced machine learning models that incorporate the space group symmetry of materials. Therefore, in this work we present the largest-to-date database of tensorial optical properties (optical conductivity, shift current) and the database of tensorial transport properties (electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, thermoelectric figure of merit zT) for 7301 materials, calculated from the Wannier function method. The quality of the Wannier functions were validated by the maximal spread of the Wannier functions and by the comparison with the band structures from first-principles calculations, ensuring the accuracy of the calculated properties. These results contribute to the systematic study the functional properties for diverse materials and can benefit future data-driven discovery of candidate materials for optoelectronic and thermoelectric applications.

Title: Synthesis of Cobalt Grown from Co-S Eutectic in High Magnetic Fields
Authors: Steven Flynn, Caeli L. Benyacko, Matúš Mihalik, Jared Lee, Fuyan Ma, Michael E. Bates, Shubham Sinha, Khalil A. Abboud, Marian Mihalik, Mark W. Meisel, James J. Hamlin
Abstract: Samples of Co were grown directly in the ferromagnetic state under equilibrium conditions using a cobalt sulfide flux. Magnetic fields up to 9 T were applied during growth, and isolated Co products exhibit progressively elongated morphologies, from cubes to rectangular rods to needle-like tendrils with poorly-defined facets. The degree of elongation of the major axis was found to correlate with magnetic field direction, strength, and gradient. Two-dimensional X-ray diffraction data indicate some level of polycrystalline-like samples, and quantitative analyses (Le Bail and Rietveld) of the one-dimensional data confirm the presence of hcp and fcc phases. The magnetic responses indicate a partial alignment of the magnetic easy-axis of the hcp phase along the magnetic field present during growth.

Title: $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariants from the Green's function diagonal zeros
Authors: Florian Simon, Corentin Morice
Abstract: We investigate the relationship between the analytical properties of the Green's function and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological insulators, focusing on three-dimensional inversion-symmetric systems. We show that the diagonal zeros of the Green's function in the orbital basis provide a direct and visual way to calculate the strong and weak $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariants. We introduce the surface of crossings of diagonal zeros in the Brillouin zone, and show that it separates TRIMs of opposite parity in two-band models, enabling the visual computation of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariants by counting the relevant TRIMs on either side. In three-band systems, a similar property holds in every case except when a trivial band is added in the band gap of a non-trivial two-band system, reminiscent of the band topology of fragile topological insulators. Our work could open avenues to experimental measurements of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariants using ARPES measurements.

Title: Shear Stress Build-up Under Constant Strain Conditions in Soft Glassy Materials
Authors: Vivek Kumar, Gareth H McKinley, Yogesh M Joshi
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the transient rheological behavior of two soft glassy materials: a clay dispersion and a silica gel, emphasizing their unconventional shear stress build-up behavior under conditions of constant imposed strain. For both materials, the elastic modulus and static yield stress undergo time-dependent evolution or aging. In addition, following an intense period of pre-shearing (i.e. shear-melting or destructuration), the material relaxation time is observed to show a stronger than linear dependence on the sample age, suggestive of hyper-aging dynamics. We show that these features are consistent with non-monotonic steady-state shear stress/shear rate flow curves characterized by a local stress minimum. When a steady shear flow is suddenly ceased, and the total imposed sample strain is held constant, both materials show an initial relaxation of the shear stress followed by a period of shear stress buildup, resulting in a local minimum in the evolution of shear stress with time. For the clay dispersion, the intensity of these effects increases with higher pre-shear rates, whereas for the silica gel, the effects are largely independent of the pre-shear rate. We also propose a simple time-dependent linear Maxwell model, which qualitatively predicts the experimentally observed trends in which the shear stress build-up is directly related to a monotonic increase in the elastic modulus, giving keen insight into this peculiar phenomenon.

Title: Passive objects in a chiral active bath: from micro to macro
Authors: Cory Hargus, Federico Ghimenti, Julien Tailleur, Frédéric van Wijland
Abstract: We present a detailed derivation of the Langevin dynamics obeyed by a massive rigid body immersed in a chiral active bath. We show how the antisymmetric nature of the noise leads to an unusual relationship between the Langevin equation describing stochastic trajectories and the Fokker-Planck equation governing the time-evolution of the probability density. The chirality of the bath endows the object dynamics with odd diffusivity, odd mobility, and rotational ratchet effects that depend on the object symmetries. For rotationally-symmetric objects, we show that a hidden time-reversal symmetry leads to separate effective equilibrium descriptions for the translational and rotational degrees of freedom. Finally, starting from the bath dynamics, we construct a multipole expansion to quadrupolar order that allows predicting the far-field current and density modulation induced by the object on the bath.

Title: Nonperturbative treatment of a quenched Langevin field theory
Authors: Friederike Ihssen, Valerio Pagni, Jamir Marino, Sebastian Diehl, Nicolò Defenu
Abstract: We present a novel approach within the functional renormalization group framework for computing critical exponents that characterize the time evolution of out-of-equilibrium many-body systems. Our approach permits access to quantities involved in the renormalization procedure, using an expansion about time-translation invariant problems. This expansion can be upgraded to a fully time-dependent computation by iteration. As a prototypical example, we compute the aging exponent $\theta$ describing the dynamics of model A following a sudden quench to the critical point. Already at leading order, the approach demonstrates remarkable accuracy when compared with MC simulations and resummed perturbative expansions in the range $2<d<4$. This yields results that surpass those of the two-loop $\epsilon$ expansion in accuracy and match analytically known benchmarks at large $N$. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of out-of-equilibrium universality and open new avenues for non-perturbative studies of critical dynamics, as well as for exploring the critical behavior of systems with spatial boundaries.

Title: Percolation of systems having hyperuniformity or giant number-fluctuations
Authors: Sayantan Mitra, Indranil Mukherjee, P. K. Mohanty
Abstract: We generate point configurations (PCs) by thresholding the local energy of the Ashkin-Teller model in two dimensions (2D) and study the percolation transition at different values of $\lambda$ along the critical Baxter line by varying the threshold that controls the particle density $\rho$. For all values of $\lambda$, the PCs exhibit power-law correlations with a decay exponent $a$ that remains independent of $\rho$ and varies continuously with $\lambda$. For $\lambda < 0$, where the PCs are hyperuniform, the percolation critical behavior is identical to that of ordinary percolation. In contrast, for $\lambda > 0$, the configurations exhibit giant number fluctuations, and all critical exponents vary continuously, but form a superuniversality class of percolation transition in 2D.

Title: Exact Diagonalization, Matrix Product States and Conformal Perturbation Theory Study of a 3D Ising Fuzzy Sphere Model
Authors: Andreas M. Läuchli, Loïc Herviou, Patrick H. Wilhelm, Slava Rychkov
Abstract: Numerical studies of phase transitions in statistical and quantum lattice models provide crucial insights into the corresponding Conformal Field Theories (CFTs). In higher dimensions, comparing finite-volume numerical results to infinite-volume CFT data is facilitated by choosing the sphere $S^{d-1}$ as the spatial manifold. Recently, the fuzzy sphere regulator in Ref. [Zhu et al, Phys. Rev. X 13 021009 (2023)] has enabled such studies with exact rotational invariance, yielding impressive agreement with known 3D Ising CFT predictions, as well as new results. However, systematic improvements and a deeper understanding of finite-size corrections remain essential. In this work, we revisit the fuzzy sphere regulator, focusing on the original Ising model, with two main goals. First, we assess the robustness of this approach using Conformal Perturbation Theory (CPT), to which we provide a detailed guidebook. We demonstrate how CPT provides a unified framework for determining the critical point, the speed of light, and residual deviations from CFT predictions. Applying this framework, we study finite-size corrections and clarify the role of tuning the model in minimizing these effects. Second, we develop a novel method for extracting Operator Product Expansion (OPE) coefficients from fuzzy sphere data. This method leverages the sensitivity of energy levels to detuning from criticality, providing new insights into level mixing and avoided crossings in finite systems. Our work also includes validation of CPT in a 1+1D Ising model away from the integrable limit.

Title: Universality of the topological phase transition in the interacting Haldane model
Authors: Simone Fabbri, Alessandro Giuliani, Robin Reuvers
Abstract: The Haldane model is a standard tight-binding model describing electrons hopping on a hexagonal lattice subject to a transverse, dipolar magnetic field. We consider its interacting version for values of the interaction strength that are small compared to the bandwidth. We study the critical case at the transition between the trivial and the `topological' insulating phases, and we rigorously establish that the transverse conductivity on the dressed critical line is quantized at a half-integer multiple of $e^2/h$: this is the average of the integer values of the Hall conductivity in the insulating phases on either side of the dressed critical line. Together with previous results, this fully characterizes the nature of the phase transition between different Hall plateaus and proves its universality with respect to many-body interactions. The proof is based on a combination of constructive renormalization group methods and exact lattice Ward identities.

Title: Optimizing Metal-Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition for Ultrawide Band-Gap MgSiN2 Thin Films
Authors: Chenxi Hu, Abdul Mukit, Vijay Gopal Thirupakuzi Vangipuram, Christopher Chae, Jinwoo Hwang, Kathleen Kash, Hongping Zhao
Abstract: Orthorhombic II-IV nitride semiconductors offer an expanded and more tunable material set with unique properties, while maintaining close compatibility with the wurtzite crystal structure of the III-nitrides. In particular, MgSiN2, a II-IV nitride closely lattice matched to GaN and AlN has a band gap suitable for photonic applications in the UV-C wavelength region. MgSiN2 is also a promising candidate to exhibit ferroelectricity, which has only been observed in very few nitride materials. This study builds on our previous work on the metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) of MgSiN2 thin films grown on GaN-on-sapphire and c-plane sapphire substrates by exploring higher growth temperature windows, resulting in higher crystalline quality and improved interfaces. Correlations between the growth conditions (Mg:Si precursor molar flow rate ratio, reactor pressure, and growth temperatures from 900C to 960C) and the resultant film quality are investigated for films grown on GaN-on-sapphire. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) reveals high-quality orthorhombic single-crystal MgSiN2, confirming successful epitaxial growth on GaN. Optical transmittance measurements indicate the direct band gap is 6.34-6.36 eV and indirect band gap is 5.77-5.81 eV, affirming the realization of an ultrawide-band gap II-IV nitride semiconductor that is structurally compatible with existing III-nitride device platforms.

Title: Constitutive relations from images
Authors: Adeline Wihardja, Kaushik Bhattacharya
Abstract: Constitutive relations close the balance laws of continuum mechanics and serves as the surrogate for a material in the design and engineering process. The problem of obtaining the constitutive relations is an indirect inverse problem where both the relation and the quantities that define the relation have to be inferred from experimental observations. The advent of full-field observation techniques promises a new ability of learning constitutive relations in realistic operational conditions. However, this is done in two steps, first obtaining deformations from the images, and then obtaining the constitutive relation from deformations and forces. This leads to a variety of difficulties. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that enables us to obtain constitutive relation directly from the raw data consisting of images and force measurements.

Title: Field free Josephson diode effect in Ising Superconductor/Altermagnet Josephson junction
Authors: Arindam Boruah, Saumen Acharjee, Prasanta Kumar Saikia
Abstract: Altermagnets (AMs) are an exotic class of antiferromagnet that exhibit spin-splitting even at the absence of net global magnetization and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effects. In this work, we investigated theoretically, the supercurrent nonreciprocity in an Ising Superconductor/Altermagnet/Ising Superconductor (ISC/AM/ISC) Josephson junction which revealed asymmetric Josephson critical currents, $0 - \pi$ transitions and anomalous current-phase relationship (CPR). A strong Josephson diode efficiency (JDE) is observed due to the combined effects of AM strength and orientations in a conventional SC even in absence of SOC. However, it significantly enhances in presence of intrinsic SOC (ISOC), resulting in pronounced diode effect in both single and double band ISC/AM based Josephson junction. Additionally, it is observed that JDE is more prominent at higher AM strengths with intermediate orientations in all scenario. Notably, it is significantly suppressed for orientations $0^\circ$ and $45^\circ$. Our results also indicate that barrier transparency and AM lengths play a crucial role in optimizing the JDE. In a single-band ISC/AM system JDE persists for any AM length, while reduces at longer AM junction in case of a double-band ISC/AM system. Moreover, our results suggest that a diode efficiency of $\sim 52\%$ can be achieved in the proposed Josephson junction in both single and double band ISC/AM Josephson junction by considering strong AM strength. Furthermore, single band ISC offers wide AM orientation range in contrast to double band ISC for better tunability and optimization of JDE. Our findings highlight the impact of AM strength, orientation and ISOC on the JDE efficiency offering insights for superconducting diode design.

Title: Efficient spin filtering through Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$-based van der Waals heterostructures
Authors: Masoumeh Davoudiniya, Biplab Sanyal
Abstract: Utilizing ab initio simulations, we study the spin-dependent electronic transport characteristics within Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$-based van der Waals heterostructures. The electronic density of states for both free-standing and device-configured Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$ (F4GT) confirms its ferromagnetic metallic nature and reveals a weak interface interaction between F4GT and PtTe$_2$ electrodes, enabling efficient spin filtering. We observe a decrease in the magnetic anisotropy energy of F4GT in the device configuration, indicating reduced stability of magnetic moments and heightened sensitivity to external conditions. The transmission eigenstates of PtTe$_2$/ monolayer F4GT/PtTe$_2$ heterostructures demonstrate interference patterns affected by relative phases and localization, notably different in the spin-up and spin-down channels. The ballistic transport through a double-layer F4GT with a ferromagnetic configuration sandwiched between two PtTe$_2$ electrodes is predicted to exhibit an impressive spin polarization of 97$\%$ with spin-up electrons exhibiting higher transmission probability than spin-down electrons. Moreover, we investigate the spin transport properties of Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$/GaTe/Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$ van der Waals heterostructures sandwiched between PtTe$_2$ electrodes to explore their potential as magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) in spintronic devices. The inclusion of GaTe as a 2D semiconducting spacer between F4GT layers results in a tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) of 487$\%$ at low bias and decreases with increasing bias voltage. In general, our findings underscore the potential of F4GT / GaTe / F4GT heterostructures to advance spintronic devices based on van der Waals materials.

Title: Bimodality of local structural ordering in extremely confined hard disks
Authors: A. Trokhymchuk, T. Bryk, A. Huerta
Abstract: By combining computer simulations and a unit cell model approach, we study the apparent bimodality of local structural ordering in a system of confined hard disks. It is shown that a two-dimensional (2D) array of hard disks confined laterally within a quasi-1D hard wall channel of the width commensurate with the bulk 2D triangular lattice at disk close packing, possesses a bimodal probability distribution for the distance between disks' left and right nearest neighbors. The observed feature aligns with the concept of locally favored structures intensively exploited in the studies of anomalous thermodynamic and kinetic behavior of hydrogen-bonding fluids, except that the reported case is driven by entropic bonding only. The bimodality is observed in a range of densities associated with the vicinity of freezing transition in bulk 2D hard disks, indicating a crossover from the "gas-like" to "liquid-like" state in confined quasi-1D hard disks. Such a phenomenon was not reported for bulk 2D hard disks and is physically unexpected for confined q1D hard disks.

Title: Electron beam precession for a serial crystallography experiment in a TEM
Authors: Sergi Plana-Ruiz, Penghan Lu, Govind Ummethala, Rafal Dunin-Borkowski
Abstract: During the last few years, serial electron crystallography (Serial Electron Diffraction, SerialED) has been gaining attention for the structure determination of crystalline compounds that are sensitive to the irradiation of the electron beam. By recording a single electron diffraction pattern per crystal, indexing hundreds or even thousands of measured particles, and merging the reflection intensities of the successfully indexed patterns, one can retrieve crystal structure models with strongly mitigated beam damage contributions. However, one of the technique's bottlenecks is the need to collect that many diffraction patterns, which, done in an automated way, results in low indexing rates. This work demonstrates how to overcome this limitation by performing the serial crystallography experiment following a semi-automated routine with a precessed electron beam (Serial Precession Electron Diffraction, SerialPED). The precession movement increases the number of reflections present in the diffraction patterns and dynamical effects related to specific orientations of the crystals with respect to the electron beam are smoothed out. This leads to more uniform reflection intensities across the serial dataset and a smaller number of patterns are required to merge the reflection intensities for good statistics. Furthermore, structure refinements based on the dynamical diffraction theory become accessible, providing a novel approach for more accurate structure models. In this context, the use of beam precession is presented as an advantageous tool for serial electron crystallography as it enables reliable crystal structure analysis with a lower amount of diffraction data.

Title: Many-body \textit{ab initio} study of quasiparticle \& optical excitations and exciton analysis in LiZnAs and ScAgC for photovoltaic applications
Authors: Vinod Kumar Solet, Sudhir K. Pandey
Abstract: Using first-principles density-functional theory and many-body excited-state calculations, we study the quasiparticle band structure, optical and excitonic properties of two half-Heusler (HH) compounds, namely LiZnAs and ScAgC, for photovoltaic (PV) applications. Our results reveal a direct bandgap semiconducting behavior in LiZnAs (ScAgC) with a value of 1.5 (1.0) eV under an accurate G$_0$W$_0$ calculation. The highest value of the imaginary part of dielectric function is found as 52 (87), 77 (87), 88 (91) using the independent-quasiparticle approximation, local field effects in random-phase approximation, and electron-hole interaction in the Bethe-Salpeter equation, respectively. Both materials demonstrate a high refractive index, high absorption coefficients (1.2-1.6 $\times 10^6 cm^{-1}$), and low reflectivity (< 40%) in active region of the solar spectrum. The triply degenerate bright excitons (exciton A) at the main absorption peak and a considerable number of bright excitonic states in the visible region, are observed; however, the excitons oscillator strength are comparatively weaker in ScAgC than in LiZnAs. We further discuss the exciton character contributing to intense optical interband transitions and reveal that direct band gap is associated to the loosely bound exciton A state with binding energy of 45 (56) meV in LiZnAs (ScAgC). Exciton A is found to be highly localized (delocalized) in momentum (real) space, indicating the presence of Mott-Wannier type excitons at bandgap. Finally, we assess the solar efficiencies using the spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency (SLME) model and find SLME values of 32% for LiZnAs and 31% for ScAgC at a 0.4 $\mu$m thin-film thickness. These findings highlight the significant role of excitons in solar energy absorption process and also suggest that both are highly suitable candidates for single-junction thin-film solar cells.

Title: Real-space methods for ab initio modelling of surfaces and interfaces under external potential bias
Authors: Kartick Ramakrishnan, Gopalakrishnan Sai Gautam, Phani Motamarri
Abstract: Accurate ab initio modelling of surfaces and interfaces, especially under an applied external potential bias, is important for describing and characterizing various phenomena that occur in electronic, catalytic, and energy storage devices. Leveraging the ability of real-space density functional theory (DFT) codes to accommodate generic boundary conditions, we introduce two methods for applying an external potential bias that can be suitable for modelling surfaces and interfaces. In the first method, an external constant electric field is applied by modifying the DFT Hamiltonian via the introduction of an auxiliary linear potential while solving the electrostatic potential arising in DFT using a Poisson equation with zero-Neumann boundary conditions. The second method directly enforces the desired external potential bias by imposing constraints on the electrostatic potential, thereby naturally mimicking experimental conditions. We describe the underlying DFT governing equations for the two setups within the real-space formalism employing finite-element discretization. First, we validate the constant electric field setup within real-space finite-element DFT (DFT-FE) with an equivalent approach using plane-wave DFT (i.e., using periodic boundary conditions) on three representative benchmark systems, namely La-terminated Li$_7$La$_3$Zr$_2$O$_{12}$, GaAs (111), and Al FCC (111) slabs. Subsequently, we present a comprehensive evaluation of the two setups in terms of the average ground-state properties, such as surface and adsorption energies. The methods developed in our work provide an attractive alternative to plane-wave DFT approaches in applying external potential bias that usually suffer from the periodic boundary conditions restrictions and poor scalability on parallel computing architectures.

Title: From point patterns to networks: to what extent does the Delaunay triangulation reproduce key spatial and density information?
Authors: Eli Newby, Wenlong Shi, Yang Jiao, Salvatore Torquato, Réka Albert
Abstract: It is important that a spatial network's construction algorithm reproduces the structural properties of the original physical embedding. Here, we assess the Delaunay triangulation as a spatial network construction algorithm for seven different types of 2D point patterns, including hyperuniform systems. The latter are characterized by completely suppressed normalized infinite-wavelength density fluctuations. We demonstrate that the quartile coefficients of dispersion of multiple centrality measures are capable of rank-ordering hyperuniform and nonhyperuniform systems independently, but they cannot distinguish a system that is nearly hyperuniform from hyperuniform systems. Thus, we investigate the local densities of the point pattern and of the network. We reveal that there is a strong correlation between local densities in the point pattern and network in nonhyperuniform systems, but there is no such correlation in hyperuniform systems. When calculating the pair-correlation function and local density covariance function on the point pattern and network, the point pattern and network functions are similar only in nonhyperuniform systems. In hyperuniform systems, the triangulation has a positive covariance of local network densities in pairs of nodes that are close together that is not present in the point patterns. Thus, we demonstrate that the Delaunay triangulation accurately captures the density fluctuations of the point pattern only when the point pattern possesses a positive local density covariance at small distances. Such positive correlation is seen in most real-world systems, so the Delaunay triangulation is generally an effective tool for building a spatial network from a 2D point pattern, but there are situations (i.e., disordered hyperuniform systems) where we caution that the Delaunay triangulation would not be effective at capturing the underlying physical embedding.

Title: Reputation in public goods cooperation under double Q-learning protocol
Authors: Kai Xie, Attila Szolnoki
Abstract: Understanding and resolving cooperation dilemmas are key challenges in evolutionary game theory, which have revealed several mechanisms to address them. This paper investigates the comprehensive influence of multiple reputation-related components on public cooperation. In particular, cooperative investments in public goods game are not fixed but simultaneously depend on the reputation of group organizers and the population's cooperation willingness, hence indirectly impacting on the players' income. Additionally, individual payoff can also be directly affected by their reputation via a weighted approach which effectively evaluates the actual income of players. Unlike conventional models, the reputation change of players is non-monotonic, but may transform abruptly due to specific actions. Importantly, a theoretically supported double Q-learning algorithm is introduced to avoid overestimation bias inherent from the classical Q-learning algorithm. Our simulations reveal a significantly improved cooperation level, that is explained by a detailed Q-value analysis. We also observe the lack of massive cooperative clusters in the absence of network reciprocity. At the same time, as an intriguing phenomenon, some actors maintain moderate reputation and are continuously flipping between cooperation and defection. The robustness of our results are validated by mean-field approximation.

Title: Dynamical Phases of Higher Dimensional Floquet CFTs
Authors: Diptarka Das, Sumit R. Das, Arnab Kundu, Krishnendu Sengupta
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamical phases of Floquet Conformal Field Theories (CFTs) in space-time dimensions greater than two. Building upon our previous work [1] which introduced quaternionic representations for studying Floquet dynamics in higher-dimensional CFTs, we now explore more general square pulse drive protocols that go beyond a single SU(1,1) subgroup. We demonstrate that, for multi-step drive protocols, the system exhibits distinct dynamical phases characterized by the nature of the eigenvalues of the quaternionic matrix representing time evolution in a single cycle, leading to different stroboscopic responses. Our analysis establishes a fundamental geometric interpretation where these dynamical phases directly correspond to the presence or absence of Killing horizons in the base space of the CFT and in a higher dimensional AdS space on which a putative dual lives. The heating phase is associated with a non-extremal horizon, the critical phase with an extremal horizon which disappears in the non heating phase. We develop perturbative approaches to compute the Floquet Hamiltonians in different regimes and show, how tuning drive parameters can lead to horizons, providing a geometric framework for understanding heating phenomena in driven conformal systems.

Title: Enhancing the Performances of Autonomous Quantum Refrigerators via Two-Photon Transitions
Authors: Brij Mohan, Bijay Kumar Agarwalla, Manabendra Nath Bera
Abstract: Conventional autonomous quantum refrigerators rely on uncorrelated heat exchange between the working system and baths via two-body interactions enabled by single-photon transitions and positive-temperature work baths, inherently limiting their cooling performance. Here, we introduce distinct qutrit refrigerators that exploit correlated heat transfer via two-photon transitions with the hot and cold baths, yielding a genuine enhancement in performance over conventional qutrit refrigerators that employ uncorrelated heat transfer. These refrigerators achieve at least a twofold enhancement in cooling power and reliability compared to conventional counterparts. Moreover, we show that cooling power and reliability can be further enhanced simultaneously by several folds, even surpassing existing cooling limits, by utilizing a synthetic negative-temperature work bath. Such refrigerators can be realized by combining correlated heat transfer and synthetic work baths, which consist of a four-level system coupled to hot and cold baths and two conventional work baths via two independent two-photon transitions. Here, the composition of two work baths effectively creates a synthetic negative-temperature work bath under suitable parameter choices. Our results demonstrate that correlated heat transfers and baths with negative temperatures can yield thermodynamic advantages in quantum devices. Finally, we discuss the experimental feasibility of the proposed refrigerators across various existing platforms.

Title: Multiphoton quantum simulation of the generalized Hopfield memory model
Authors: Gennaro Zanfardino, Stefano Paesani, Luca Leuzzi, Raffaele Santagati, Fabrizio Illuminati, Giancarlo Ruocco, Marco Leonetti
Abstract: In the present work, we introduce, develop, and investigate a connection between multiphoton quantum interference, a core element of emerging photonic quantum technologies, and Hopfieldlike Hamiltonians of classical neural networks, the paradigmatic models for associative memory and machine learning in systems of artificial intelligence. Specifically, we show that combining a system composed of Nph indistinguishable photons in superposition over M field modes, a controlled array of M binary phase-shifters, and a linear-optical interferometer, yields output photon statistics described by means of a p-body Hopfield Hamiltonian of M Ising-like neurons +-1, with p = 2Nph. We investigate in detail the generalized 4-body Hopfield model obtained through this procedure and show that it realizes a transition from a memory retrieval to a memory black-out regime, i.e. a spin-glass phase, as the amount of stored memory increases. The mapping enables novel routes to the realization and investigation of disordered and complex classical systems via efficient photonic quantum simulators, as well as the description of aspects of structured photonic systems in terms of classical spin Hamiltonians.

Title: Digital Quantum Simulation of the Nonlinear Lindblad Master Equation Based on Quantum Trajectory Averaging
Authors: Yu-Guo Liu, Heng Fan, Shu Chen
Abstract: Since precisely controlling dissipation in realistic environments is challenging, digital simulation of the Lindblad master equation (LME) is of great significance for understanding nonequilibrium dynamics in open quantum systems. However, achieving long-time simulations for complex systems with multiple dissipation channels remains a major challenge, both theoretically and experimentally. Here, we propose a 2-dilation digital simulation scheme for the non-linear Lindblad master equation (NLME) based on quantum trajectory averaging. The NLME continuously interpolates between full LME and the dynamical equation governed by the effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Remarkably, for standard LMEs, our scheme reduces to a 1-dilation method that enables deterministic realizations without postselection. This deterministic nature overcomes a key limitation in some existing simulation methods, where repeated postselections lead to exponentially vanishing implementation probabilities. Consequently, our scheme allows efficient long-time simulations of LMEs with multiple jump operators. As a demonstration, we present numerical experiments simulating novel theoretical predictions in open quantum systems, including localization in open quantum systems and the postselected skin effect.

Title: Spin-Phonon Relaxation of Boron-Vacancy Centers in Two-Dimensional Boron Nitride Polytypes
Authors: Nasrin Estaji, Ismaeil Abdolhosseini Sarsari, Gergő Thiering, Adam Gali
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials hosting color centers and spin defects are emerging as key platforms for quantum technologies. However, the impact of reduced dimensionality on the spin-lattice relaxation time ($T_1$) of embedded defect spins -- critical for quantum applications -- remains largely unexplored. In this study, we present a systematic first-principles investigation of the negatively charged boron-vacancy (V$_{\text{B}}^-$) defect in monolayer boron nitride (BN), as well as in AA$^\prime$-stacked hexagonal BN (hBN) and ABC-stacked rhombohedral BN (rBN). Our results reveal that the $T_1$ times of V$_{\text{B}}^-$ in monolayer BN and hBN are nearly identical at room temperature. Surprisingly, despite the symmetry reduction in rBN opening additional spin relaxation channels, V$_{\text{B}}^-$ exhibits a longer $T_1$ compared to hBN. We attribute this effect to the stiffer out-of-plane phonon modes in rBN, which activate spin-phonon relaxation at reduced strength. These findings suggest that V$_{\text{B}}^-$ in rBN offers enhanced spin coherence properties, making it a promising candidate for quantum technology applications.

Title: Deterministic quantum trajectory via imaginary time evolution
Authors: Shivan Mittal, Bin Yan
Abstract: Stochastic quantum trajectories, such as pure state evolutions under unitary dynamics and random measurements, offer a crucial ensemble description of many-body open system dynamics. Recent studies have highlighted that individual quantum trajectories also encode essential physical information. Prominent examples include measurement induced phase transitions, where a pure quantum state corresponding to fixed measurement outcomes (trajectories) exhibits distinct entanglement phases, depending on the measurement rate. However, direct observation of this effect is hindered by an exponential post-selection barrier, whereby the probability of realizing a specific trajectory is exponentially small. We propose a deterministic method to efficiently prepare quantum trajectories in polynomial time using imaginary time evolution and, thus, overcome this fundamental challenge. We demonstrate that our method applies to a certain class of quantum states, and argue that there does not exist universal approaches for any quantum trajectories. Our result paves the way for experimentally exploring the physics of individual quantum trajectories at scale and enables direct observation of certain post-selection-dependent phenomena.

Title: A machine learning platform for development of low flammability polymers
Authors: Duy Nhat Phan, Alexander B. Morgan, Lokendra Poudel, Rahul Bhowmik
Abstract: Flammability index (FI) and cone calorimetry outcomes, such as maximum heat release rate, time to ignition, total smoke release, and fire growth rate, are critical factors in evaluating the fire safety of polymers. However, predicting these properties is challenging due to the complexity of material behavior under heat exposure. In this work, we investigate the use of machine learning (ML) techniques to predict these flammability metrics. We generated synthetic polymers using Synthetic Data Vault to augment the experimental dataset. Our comprehensive ML investigation employed both our polymer descriptors and those generated by the RDkit library. Despite the challenges of limited experimental data, our models demonstrate the potential to accurately predict FI and cone calorimetry outcomes, which could be instrumental in designing safer polymers. Additionally, we developed POLYCOMPRED, a module integrated into the cloud-based MatVerse platform, providing an accessible, web-based interface for flammability prediction. This work provides not only the predictive modeling of polymer flammability but also an interactive analysis tool for the discovery and design of new materials with tailored fire-resistant properties.

Title: Extremal monomial property of q-characters and polynomiality of the X-series
Authors: Edward Frenkel, David Hernandez
Abstract: The character of every irreducible finite-dimensional representation of a simple Lie algebra has the highest weight property. The invariance of the character under the action of the Weyl group W implies that there is a similar "extremal weight property" for every weight obtained by applying an element of W to the highest weight. In this paper we conjecture an analogous "extremal monomial property" of the q-characters of simple finite-dimensional modules over the quantum affine algebras, using the braid group action on q-characters defined by Chari. In the case of the identity element of W, this is the highest monomial property of q-characters proved in arXiv:math/9911112. Here we prove it for simple reflections. Somewhat surprisingly, the extremal monomial property for each w in W turns out to be equivalent to polynomiality of the "X-series" corresponding to w, which we introduce in this paper. We show that these X-series are equal to certain limits of the generalized Baxter operators for all w in W. Thus, we find a new bridge between q-characters and the spectra of XXZ-type quantum integrable models associated to quantum affine algebras. This leads us to conjecture polynomiality of all generalized Baxter operators, extending the results of arXiv:1308.3444.

Title: From Chaos to Coherence: Effects of High-Order Synaptic Correlations on Neural Dynamics
Authors: Nimrod Sherf, Xaq Pitkow, Krešimir Josić, Kevin E. Bassler
Abstract: Recurrent Neural Network models have elucidated the interplay between structure and dynamics in biological neural networks, particularly the emergence of irregular and rhythmic activities in cortex. However, most studies have focused on networks with random or simple connectivity structures. Experimental observations find that high-order cortical connectivity patterns affect the temporal patterns of network activity, but a theory that relates such complex structure to network dynamics has yet to be developed. Here, we show that third- and higher-order cyclic correlations in synaptic connectivities greatly impact neuronal dynamics. Specifically, strong cyclic correlations in a network suppress chaotic dynamics, and promote oscillatory or fixed activity. The change in dynamics is related to the form of the unstable eigenvalues of the random connectivity matrix. A phase transition from chaotic to fixed or oscillatory activity coincides with the development of a cusp at the leading edge of the eigenvalue support. We also relate the dimensions of activity to the network structure.

Title: Quantum computation of a quasiparticle band structure with the quantum-selected configuration interaction
Authors: Takahiro Ohgoe, Hokuto Iwakiri, Kazuhide Ichikawa, Sho Koh, Masaya Kohda
Abstract: Quasiparticle band structures are fundamental for understanding strongly correlated electron systems. While solving these structures accurately on classical computers is challenging, quantum computing offers a promising alternative. Specifically, the quantum subspace expansion (QSE) method, combined with the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), provides a quantum algorithm for calculating quasiparticle band structures. However, optimizing the variational parameters in VQE becomes increasingly difficult as the system size grows, due to device noise, statistical noise, and the barren plateau problem. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid approach that combines QSE with the quantum-selected configuration interaction (QSCI) method for calculating quasiparticle band structures. QSCI may leverage the VQE ansatz as an input state but, unlike the standard VQE, it does not require full optimization of the variational parameters, making it more scalable for larger quantum systems. Based on this approach, we demonstrate the quantum computation of the quasiparticle band structure of a silicon using 16 qubits on an IBM quantum processor.

Title: Dissipation and non-thermal states in cryogenic cavities
Authors: Zeno Bacciconi, Giulia Piccitto, Alessandro Maria Verga, Giuseppe Falci, Elisabetta Paladino, Giuliano Chiriacò
Abstract: We study the properties of photons in a cryogenic cavity, made by cryo-cooled mirrors surrounded by a room temperature environment. We model such a system as a multimode cavity coupled to two thermal reservoirs at different temperatures. Using a Lindblad master equation approach, we derive the photon distribution and the statistical properties of the cavity modes, finding an overall non-thermal state described by a mode-dependent effective temperature. We also calculate the dissipation rates arising from the interaction of the cavity field with the external environment and the mirrors, relating such rates to measurable macroscopic quantities. These results provide a simple theory to calculate the dissipative properties and the effective temperature of a cavity coupled to different thermal reservoirs, offering potential pathways for engineering dissipations and photon statistics in cavity settings.

Title: Magnetic Pillar Induced Poiseuille-like Flow in Microfluidic Channels with Viscous and Viscoelastic Fluids
Authors: Charles Paul Moore, Stefan Rouach, Marine Le Goas, Sandra Lerouge, Nicolas Tsapis, Jérôme Fresnais, Jean-François Berret
Abstract: Mucociliary clearance in mammals serves as the primary defense mechanism for removing particulate matter deposited in the pulmonary airways. Dysfunctions in this process are linked to serious respiratory diseases and can hinder effective drug delivery to the lungs. Microfluidic systems have emerged as a promising alternative for replicating lung functions in non-cellular physiological environments, offering a simpler and more controllable approach compared to in vivo and in vitro assays. Here we present a microfluidic platform featuring a closed-loop circular microchannel, integrating thousand 75 micrometer high magnetic pillars arranged in a square array. Made of polydimethylsiloxane and loaded with iron microparticles, the pillars are studied using scanning electron microscopy and magnetometry; their internal structure and bending response to a magnetic field are quantitatively analyzed. Using a combination of experimental data and finite element simulations, we found that the magnetic torque induced by permanent magnets dominates over magnetic force, generating fluid flow in the microchannel. Under the application of a rotating field, the time-dependent deflection of the pillars closely mimics the behavior of lung cilia, exhibiting alternating recovery phases and rapid whip-like movements. The velocity profiles of viscous and viscoelastic fluids are examined, and shown to display Poiseuille-type flow. By varying the viscosity of the fluids across four orders of magnitude, we identified a transition in propulsion regimes between viscous and elastic-driven flows. This active microfluidic platform offers a promising approach for modeling mucociliary clearance in drug delivery applications.

Title: Bismuth plasmonic antennas
Authors: Michael Foltýn, Tomáš Šikola, Michal Horák
Abstract: Bismuth is a particularly promising alternative plasmonic metal because of its theoretically predicted wide spectral bandwidth. In this study, we experimentally demonstrated the correlation between the shape and size of individual bismuth plasmonic antennas and their optical properties. To this end, we employed a combination of scanning transmission electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy. Bar-shaped and bowtie bismuth plasmonic antennas of various sizes were fabricated by focused ion beam lithography of a polycrystalline bismuth thin film. Our experimental findings demonstrate that these antennas support localised surface plasmon resonances and their dipole modes can be tuned through their size from the near-infrared to the entire visible spectral region. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that bismuth exhibits a plasmon dispersion relation that is nearly identical to that of gold while maintaining its plasmonic performance even at higher plasmon energies, thus rendering it a promising low-cost alternative to gold.

Title: Observation of Quantum Darwinism and the Origin of Classicality with Superconducting Circuits
Authors: Zitian Zhu, Kiera Salice, Akram Touil, Zehang Bao, Zixuan Song, Pengfei Zhang, Hekang Li, Zhen Wang, Chao Song, Qiujiang Guo, H. Wang, Rubem Mondaini
Abstract: The transition from quantum to classical behavior is a central question in modern physics. How can we rationalize everyday classical observations from an inherently quantum world? For instance, what makes two people, each absorbing an independent fraction of photons scattered from this screen or paper, agree on the observation of the text written here? Quantum Darwinism offers a compelling framework to explain this emergence of classicality by proposing that the environment redundantly encodes information about a quantum system, leading to the objective reality we perceive. Here, by leveraging cutting-edge superconducting quantum circuits, we observe the highly structured branching quantum states that support classicality and the saturation of quantum mutual information, establishing a robust verification of the foundational framework of quantum Darwinism and the accompanying underlying geometric structure of quantum states. Additionally, we propose a particular class of observables that can be used as a separate quantifier for classicality, originating a computationally and experimentally inexpensive method to probe quantum-to-classical transitions. Our investigation delves into how the quantum effects are inaccessible to observers, allowing only classical properties to be detected. It experimentally demonstrates the physical framework through which everyday classical observations emerge from underlying quantum principles and paves the way to settling the measurement problem.

Title: Dissipation-Driven Transition of Particles from Dispersive to Flat Bands
Authors: Yutao Hu, Chao Yang, Yucheng Wang
Abstract: Flat bands (FBs) play a crucial role in condensed matter physics, offering an ideal platform to study strong correlation effects and enabling applications in diffraction-free photonics and quantum devices. However, the study and application of FB properties are susceptible to interference from dispersive bands. Here, we explore the impact of bond dissipation on systems hosting both flat and dispersive bands by calculating the steady-state density matrix. We demonstrate that bond dissipation can drive particles from dispersive bands into FBs and establish the general conditions for this phenomenon to occur. Our results demonstrate that dissipation can facilitate FB preparation, property measurement, and utilization. This opens a new avenue for exploring FB physics in open quantum systems, with potential implications for strongly correlated physics.

Title: Bio-heat regimes in fractal-based models of tumors
Authors: Sébastien Fumeron, Malte Henkel, Alexander López
Abstract: Anomalous heat diffusion is investigated for biological tissues displaying a fractal structure and long-term thermal memory, which is modeled via a fractional derivative. For increasing values of the fractional derivation order, the tissue temperature displays three kinds of bio-heat regimes: damped (or sub-diffusive), critical damping and under-damped oscillations. The temperature profiles depend on the fractal dimension of the tissue but notably also on a parameter related to its topology: the spectral dimension. The parametric analysis reveals that these two parameters have antagonistic effects on the pseudo period of the temperature oscillations and their amplitudes. We discuss how our results might impact some treatment protocols.

Title: Spectral Architecture Search for Neural Networks
Authors: Gianluca Peri, Lorenzo Giambagli, Lorenzo Chicchi, Duccio Fanelli
Abstract: Architecture design and optimization are challenging problems in the field of artificial neural networks. Working in this context, we here present SPARCS (SPectral ARchiteCture Search), a novel architecture search protocol which exploits the spectral attributes of the inter-layer transfer matrices. SPARCS allows one to explore the space of possible architectures by spanning continuous and differentiable manifolds, thus enabling for gradient-based optimization algorithms to be eventually employed. With reference to simple benchmark models, we show that the newly proposed method yields a self-emerging architecture with a minimal degree of expressivity to handle the task under investigation and with a reduced parameter count as compared to other viable alternatives.

Authors: Xingyu Yang, Chantal Harreau, Mathieu Mivelle
Abstract: We present a new approach to controlling magnetization in gold nanoparticles using the Inverse Faraday Effect combined with Laguerre-Gauss beams carrying orbital angular momentum. By tailoring the tilt of isophase planes, we induce drift photocurrents that generate magnetic fields tilted by up to 25° relative to the beam axis. The magnetic orientation can be reversed by switching polarization chirality or the orbital angular momentum sign, and it can be rotated azimuthally by repositioning the particle, accessing any angle over 2{\pi} steradians. This unprecedented level of control extends all-optical magnetization to three-dimensional orientations, potentially at ultrafast timescales given the near-instantaneous nature of the Inverse Faraday Effect. Our results pave the way for advanced spin-based applications, from triggering spin waves in magnetic materials to designing next-generation magnetic memory and logic devices.

Title: Measurement Induced Dynamics and Trace Preserving Replica Cutoffs
Authors: Graham Kells
Abstract: We present a general methodology for addressing the infinite hierarchy problem that arises in measurement-induced dynamics of replicated quantum systems. Our approach introduces trace-preserving replica cutoffs using tomographic-like techniques to estimate higher-order replica states from lower ones, ensuring that partial trace reduction properties are rigorously maintained. This guarantees that the dynamics of single-replica systems correctly reduce to standard Lindblad evolution. By systematically mapping information between replica spaces of different orders, we characterise null spaces under partial trace operations and outline efficient algorithmic approaches to enforce positivity. Importantly, it is demonstrated that pre-calculated stochastic Gaussian ensembles of free fermion states provide an effective and computationally efficient means to stabilise the replica hierarchy, even in the presence of interactions. Numerical tests on small interacting fermionic systems illustrate the effectiveness and practicality of our approach, showing precise agreement with trajectory methods while providing significantly better statistical convergence.

Title: Density Matrix Renormalization Group study of superconducting pairing near the quarter-filled Wigner crystal
Authors: R. Torsten Clay, Beau A. Thompson
Abstract: Charge ordering is often found in the phase diagram of unconventional superconductors in close proximity to the superconducting state. This has led to the suggestion that fluctuations of charge order can mediate superconducting pairing. While several mechanisms can lead to charge order, one common mechanism is the long-range Coulomb interaction, resulting in a Wigner crystal charge ordered state. For an electron density of 0.5 per site we investigate the extended Hubbard model on the two-dimensional square lattice using exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group methods. Our results show that the strength of pairing decreases with the nearest-neighbor Coulomb interaction strength $V$ and remains weaker than the tendency of pairing for non-interacting electrons.

Title: Cellular automata in $d$ dimensions and ground states of spin models in $(d+1)$ dimensions
Authors: Konstantinos Sfairopoulos, Luke Causer, Jamie F. Mair, Juan P. Garrahan
Abstract: We show how the trajectories of $d$-dimensional cellular automata (CA) can be used to determine the ground states of $(d+1)$-dimensional classical spin models, and we characterise their quantum phase transition, when in the presence of a transverse magnetic field. For each of the 256 one-dimensional elementary CA we explicitly construct the simplest local two-dimensional classical spin model associated to the given CA, and we also describe this method for $d>1$ through selected examples. We illustrate our general observations with detailed studies of: (i) the $d=1$ CA Rule 150 and its $d=2$ four-body plaquette spin model, (ii) the $d=2$ CA whose associated model is the $d=3$ square-pyramid plaquette model, and (iii) two counter-propagating $d=1$ Rule 60 CA that correspond to the two-dimensional Baxter-Wu spin model. For the quantum spin models, we show that the connection to CAs implies a sensitivity on the approach to the thermodynamic limit via finite size scaling for their quantum phase transitions.

Title: A predictive machine learning force field framework for liquid electrolyte development
Authors: Sheng Gong, Yumin Zhang, Zhenliang Mu, Zhichen Pu, Hongyi Wang, Zhiao Yu, Mengyi Chen, Tianze Zheng, Zhi Wang, Lifei Chen, Zhenze Yang, Xiaojie Wu, Shaochen Shi, Weihao Gao, Wen Yan, Liang Xiang
Abstract: Despite the widespread applications of machine learning force fields (MLFF) in solids and small molecules, there is a notable gap in applying MLFF to simulate liquid electrolyte, a critical component of the current commercial lithium-ion battery. In this work, we introduce BAMBOO (\textbf{B}yteDance \textbf{A}I \textbf{M}olecular Simulation \textbf{Boo}ster), a predictive framework for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, with a demonstration of its capability in the context of liquid electrolyte for lithium batteries. We design a physics-inspired graph equivariant transformer architecture as the backbone of BAMBOO to learn from quantum mechanical simulations. Additionally, we introduce an ensemble knowledge distillation approach and apply it to MLFFs to reduce the fluctuation of observations from MD simulations. Finally, we propose a density alignment algorithm to align BAMBOO with experimental measurements. BAMBOO demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy in predicting key electrolyte properties such as density, viscosity, and ionic conductivity across various solvents and salt combinations. The current model, trained on more than 15 chemical species, achieves the average density error of 0.01 g/cm$^3$ on various compositions compared with experiment.

Title: Probing the dichotomy between Yu-Shiba-Rusinov and Majorana bound states via conductance, quantum noise and $Δ_T$ noise
Authors: Sachiraj Mishra, Colin Benjamin
Abstract: We explore the potential of charge and spin conductance as well as charge and spin quantum noise and $\Delta_T$ noise as probes to analyze and contrast Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states from Majorana bound states (MBS) in a one-dimensional metal/spin-flipper/metal/insulator/superconductor junction. YSR bound states, induced by magnetic impurities acting as spin-flippers within the superconducting gap, are distinct from MBS, which can also arise in systems with magnetic impurities, such as magnetic adatoms on superconductors, often leading to false positives in MBS detection. Replacing a trivial $s$-wave superconductor with a topological superconductor featuring triplet pairing, e.g., chiral-$p$ or spinless $p$-wave superconducting nanowire, we analyze and establish clear distinctions between YSR states and MBS. This work provides an unique signature for YSR states, demonstrating that charge or spin conductance as well as both charge and spin quantum noise, along their $\Delta_T$ noise counterparts are effective in identifying YSR bound states and distinguishing them from MBS.

Title: A robust theory of thermal activation in magnetic systems with Gilbert damping
Authors: Hugo Bocquet, Peter M. Derlet
Abstract: Magnetic systems can exhibit thermally activated transitions whose timescales are often described by an Arrhenius law. However, robust predictions of such timescales are only available for certain cases. Inspired by the harmonic theory of Langer, we derive a general activation rate for multi-dimensional spin systems. Assuming local thermal equilibrium in the initial minimum and deriving an expression for the flow of probability density along the real unstable dynamical mode at the saddle point, we obtain the expression for the activation rate that is a function of the Gilbert damping parameter, $\alpha$. We find that this expression remains valid for the physically relevant regime of $\alpha\ll1$. When the activation is characterized by a coherent reorientation of all spins, we gain insight into the prefactor of the Arrhenius law by writing it in terms of spin wave frequencies and, for the case of a finite antiferromagnetic spin chain, obtain an expression that depends exponentially on the square of the system size indicating a break-down of the Meyer-Neldel rule.

Title: The ideal gas of Bosons and Fermions in Harmonic Traps in the framework of Extended Uncertainty Principle
Authors: B. Hamil, B. C. Lütfüoğlu
Abstract: This manuscript studies harmonically trapped ideal Bose and Fermi gas systems and their thermodynamics in the framework of the Extended Uncertainty Principle (EUP). In particular, we demonstrated how the ground and thermal particle ratios, condensate temperature, internal energy, specific heat, and equation of state functions change in the EUP formalism. Following a comprehensive analysis, we concluded that the effect of the EUP on ideal Bose and Fermi gas systems remains relatively modest compared to the effect of the Gravitational (Generalised) Uncertainty Principle. { By comparing the obtained results with experimental data, we found that the EUP parameter is bounded as $\alpha \leq 0.36654\times 10^{7}\text{ \ }m^{-2}$.}

Title: Phase transitions in $q$-state clock model
Authors: Arpita Goswami, Ravi Kumar, Monikana Gope, Shaon Sahoo
Abstract: The $q-$state clock model, sometimes called the discrete $XY$ model, is known to show a second-order (symmetry breaking) phase transition in two-dimension (2D) for $q\le 4$ ($q=2$ corresponds to the Ising model). On the other hand, the $q\to\infty$ limit of the model corresponds to the $XY$ model, which shows the infinite order (non-symmetry breaking) Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase transition in 2D. Interestingly, the 2D clock model with $q\ge 5$ is predicted to show three different phases and two associated phase transitions. There are varying opinions about the actual characters of phases and the associated transitions. In this work, we develop the basic and higher-order mean-field (MF) theories to study the $q$-state clock model systematically. Our MF calculations reaffirm that, for large $q$, there are three phases: (broken) $\mathbb{Z}_q$ symmetric ferromagnetic phase at the low temperature, emergent $U(1)$ symmetric BKT phase at the intermediate temperature, and paramagnetic (disordered) phase at the high temperature. The phase transition at the higher temperature is found to be of the BKT type, and the other transition at the lower temperature is argued to be a large-order spontaneous symmetry-breaking (SSB) type (the largeness of transition order yields the possibility of having some of the numerical characteristics of a BKT transition). The higher-order MF theory developed here better characterizes phases by estimating the spin-spin correlation between two neighbors.

Title: The quantum Newman-Moore model in a longitudinal field
Authors: Konstantinos Sfairopoulos, Juan P. Garrahan
Abstract: We study the quantum Newman-Moore model, or quantum triangular plaquette model (qTPM), in the presence of a longitudinal field (qTPMz). We present evidence that indicates that the ground state phase diagram of the qTPMz includes various frustrated phases breaking translational symmetries, dependent on the specific sequence of system sizes used to take the large-size limit. This phase diagram includes the known first-order phase transition of the qTPM, but also additional first-order transitions due to the frustrated phases. Using the average longitudinal magnetization as an order parameter, we analyze the magnetization plateaus that characterize the ground state phases, describe their degeneracies, and obtain the qTPMz phase diagram using classical transfer matrix and quantum matrix product state techniques. We identify a region of parameter space which can be effectively described by a Rydberg blockade model on the triangular lattice and also find indications of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order connecting the quantum paramagnetic and classical frustrated phases.

Title: Chiral superfluid helium-3 in the quasi-two-dimensional limit
Authors: Petri J. Heikkinen, Lev V. Levitin, Xavier Rojas, Angadjit Singh, Nathan Eng, Andrew Casey, John Saunders, Anton Vorontsov, Nikolay Zhelev, Abhilash Thanniyil Sebastian, Jeevak M. Parpia
Abstract: Anisotropic pair breaking close to surfaces favors the chiral A phase of the superfluid $^3$He over the time-reversal invariant B phase. Confining the superfluid $^3$He into a cavity of height $D$ of the order of the Cooper pair size characterized by the coherence length $\xi_0$ - ranging between 16 nm (34 bar) and 77 nm (0 bar) - extends the surface effects over the whole sample volume, thus allowing stabilization of the A phase at pressures $P$ and temperatures $T$ where otherwise the B phase would be stable. In this Letter, the surfaces of such a confined sample are covered with a superfluid $^4$He film to create specular quasiparticle scattering boundary conditions, preventing the suppression of the superfluid order parameter. We show that the chiral A phase is the stable superfluid phase under strong confinement over the full $P$-$T$ phase diagram down to a quasi-two-dimensional limit $D / \xi_0 = 1$ , where $D = 80$ nm. The planar phase, which is degenerate with the chiral A phase in the weak-coupling limit, is not observed. The gap inferred from measurements over the wide pressure range from 0.2 to 21.0 bar leads to an empirical ansatz for temperature-dependent strong-coupling effects. We discuss how these results pave the way for the realization of the fully gapped two-dimensional $p_x + ip_y$ superfluid under more extreme confinement.

Title: Fluctuation-Induced Bistability of Fermionic Atoms Coupled to a Dissipative Cavity
Authors: Luisa Tolle, Ameneh Sheikhan, Thierry Giamarchi, Corinna Kollath, Catalin-Mihai Halati
Abstract: We investigate the steady state phase diagram of fermionic atoms subjected to an optical lattice and coupled to a high finesse optical cavity with photon losses. The coupling between the atoms and the cavity field is induced by a transverse pump beam. Taking fluctuations around the mean-field solutions into account, we find that a transition to a self-organized phase takes place at a critical value of the pump strength. In the self-organized phase the cavity field takes a finite expectation value and the atoms show a modulation in the density. Surprisingly, at even larger pump strengths two self-organized stable solutions of the cavity field and the atoms occur, signaling the presence of a bistability. We show that the bistable behavior is induced by the atoms-cavity fluctuations and is not captured by the mean-field approach.

Title: Spin-lattice couplings in $3d$ ferromagnets: analysis from first-principles
Authors: I. P. Miranda, M. Pankratova, M. Weißenhofer, A. B. Klautau, D. Thonig, M. Pereiro, E. Sjöqvist, A. Delin, M. I. Katsnelson, O. Eriksson, A. Bergman
Abstract: Magnetoelasticity plays a crucial role in numerous magnetic phenomena, including magnetocalorics, magnon excitation via acoustic waves, and ultrafast demagnetization/Einstein-de Haas effect. Despite a long-standing discussion on anisotropy-mediated magnetoelastic interactions of relativistic origin, the exchange-mediated magnetoelastic parameters within an atomistic framework have only recently begun to be investigated. As a result, many of their behaviors and values for real materials remain poorly understood. Therefore, by using a proposed simple modification of the embedded cluster approach that reduces the computational complexity, we critically analyze the properties of exchange-mediated spin-lattice coupling parameters for elemental $3d$ ferromagnets (bcc Fe, fcc Ni, and fcc Co), comparing methods used for their extraction and relating their realistic values to symmetry considerations and orbitally-decomposed contributions. Additionally, we investigate the effects of noncollinearity (spin temperature) and applied pressure on these parameters. For Fe, we find that single-site rotations, associated with spin temperatures around $\sim100$ K, induce significant modifications, particularly in Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya-type couplings; in contrast, such interactions in Co and Ni remain almost configuration independent. Moreover, we demonstrate a notable change in the exchange-mediated magnetoelastic constants for Fe under isotropic contraction. Finally, the conversion between atomistic, quantum-mechanically derived parameters and the phenomenological magnetoelastic theory is discussed, which can be an useful tool towards larger and more realistic dynamics simulations involving coupled subsystems.

Title: Thermal disorder and phonon softening in the ferroelectric phase transition of lead titanate
Authors: Pinchen Xie, Yixiao Chen, Weinan E, Roberto Car
Abstract: We report a molecular dynamics study of ab initio quality of the ferroelectric phase transition in crystalline PbTiO3. We model anharmonicity accurately in terms of potential energy and polarization surfaces trained on density functional theory data with modern machine learning techniques. Our simulations demonstrate that the transition has a strong order-disorder character, in agreement with diffraction experiments, and provide fresh insight into the approach to equilibrium across the phase transition. We find that the emergence and disappearance of the macroscopic polarization is driven by dipolar switching at the nanometer scale. We also computed the infrared optical absorption spectra in both the ferroelectric and the paraelectric phases, finding good agreement with the experimental Raman frequencies. Often, the almost ideal displacive character of the soft mode detected by Raman scattering in the paraelectric phase has been contrasted with the order-disorder character of the transition suggested by diffraction experiments. We settle this issue by showing that the soft mode coexists with a strong Debye relaxation associated with thermal disordering of the dipoles. The Debye relaxation feature is centered at zero frequency and appears near the transition temperature in both the ferroelectric and the paraelectric phases.

Title: Exact full-RSB SAT/UNSAT transition in infinitely wide two-layer neural networks
Authors: Brandon L. Annesi, Enrico M. Malatesta, Francesco Zamponi
Abstract: We analyze the problem of storing random pattern-label associations using two classes of continuous non-convex weights models, namely the perceptron with negative margin and an infinite-width two-layer neural network with non-overlapping receptive fields and generic activation function. Using a full-RSB ansatz we compute the exact value of the SAT/UNSAT transition. Furthermore, in the case of the negative perceptron we show that the overlap distribution of typical states displays an overlap gap (a disconnected support) in certain regions of the phase diagram defined by the value of the margin and the density of patterns to be stored. This implies that some recent theorems that ensure convergence of Approximate Message Passing (AMP) based algorithms to capacity are not applicable. Finally, we show that Gradient Descent is not able to reach the maximal capacity, irrespectively of the presence of an overlap gap for typical states. This finding, similarly to what occurs in binary weight models, suggests that gradient-based algorithms are biased towards highly atypical states, whose inaccessibility determines the algorithmic threshold.

Title: Hierarchical analytical approach to universal spectral correlations in Brownian Quantum Chaos
Authors: Tara Kalsi, Alessandro Romito, Henning Schomerus
Abstract: We develop an analytical approach to the spectral form factor and out-of-time ordered correlators in zero-dimensional Brownian models of quantum chaos. The approach expresses these spectral correlations as part of a closed hierarchy of differential equations that can be formulated for all system sizes and in each of the three standard symmetry classes (unitary, orthogonal, and symplectic, as determined by the presence and nature of time-reversal symmetry). The hierarchy applies exactly, and in the same form, to Dyson's Brownian motion and all systems with stochastically emerging basis invariance, where the model-dependent information is subsumed in a single dynamical time scale whose explicit form we also establish. We further verify this universality numerically for the Brownian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, for which we find perfect agreement with the analytical predictions of the symmetry class determined by the number of fermions. This results in a complete analytical description of the spectral correlations and allows us to identify which correlations are universal in a large class of models.

Abstract: This paper reports the compatibility of heterostructure-based spin qubit devices with industrial CMOS technology. It features Si/Si-Ge quantum dot devices fabricated using Infineon's 200 mm production line within a restricted thermal budget. The devices exhibit state-of-the-art charge sensing, charge noise and valley splitting characteristics, showing that industrial fabrication is not harming the heterostructure quality. These measured parameters are all correlated to spin qubit coherence and qubit gate fidelity. We describe the single electron device layout, design and its fabrication process using electron beam lithography. The incorporated standard 90 nm back-end of line flow for gate-layer independent contacting and wiring can be scaled up to multiple wiring layers for scalable quantum computing architectures. In addition, we present millikelvin characterization results. Our work exemplifies the potential of industrial fabrication methods to harness the inherent CMOS-compatibility of the Si/Si-Ge material system, despite being restricted to a reduced thermal budget. It paves the way for advanced quantum processor architectures with high yield and device quality.

Abstract: We present an ab-initio computational analysis of the topological Hall effect arising from stable magnetic skyrmions in the Pd/Fe/Ir(111) film using non-collinear spin density functional calculations within the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker (KKR) Green function method. The semiclassical Boltzmann transport equation is employed for the resistivity and the Hall angle of the system. We explore the influence of the skyrmion size and the impact of disorder on the topological Hall angle.

Title: Quantum Sensing of Broadband Spin Dynamics and Magnon Transport in Antiferromagnets
Authors: Alex Lee Melendez, Shekhar Das, Francisco Ayala Rodriguez, I-Hsuan Kao, Wenhao Liu, Archibald J. Williams, Bing Lv, Joshua Goldberger, Shubhayu Chatterjee, Simranjeet Singh, P. Chris Hammel
Abstract: Optical detection of magnetic resonance using quantum spin sensors (QSS) provides a spatially local and sensitive technique to probe spin dynamics in magnets. However, its utility as a probe of antiferromagnetic resonance (AFMR) remains an open question. We report the first experimental demonstration of optically detected AFMR in layered van der Waals antiferromagnets (AF) up to frequencies of 24 GHz. We leverage QSS spin relaxation due to low-frequency magnetic field fluctuations arising from collective dynamics of magnons excited by the uniform AFMR mode. First, through AFMR spectroscopy we characterize the intrinsic exchange fields and magnetic anisotropies of the AF. Second, using the localized sensitivity of the QSS we demonstrate magnon transport over tens of micrometers. Finally, we find that optical detection efficiency increases with increasing frequency. This showcases the dual capabilities of QSS as detectors of high frequency magnetization dynamics and magnon transport, paving the way for understanding and controlling the magnetism of antiferromagnets.

Title: Solving the Kinetic Ising Model with Non-Reciprocity
Authors: Gabriel Artur Weiderpass, Mayur Sharma, Savdeep Sethi
Abstract: Non-reciprocal interactions are a generic feature of non-equilibrium systems. We define a non-reciprocal generalization of the kinetic Ising model in one spatial dimension. We solve the model exactly using two different approaches for infinite, semi-infinite and finite systems with either periodic or open boundary conditions. The exact solution allows us to explore a range of novel phenomena tied to non-reciprocity like non-reciprocity induced frustration and wave phenomena with interesting parity-dependence for finite systems of size $N$. We study dynamical questions like the approach to equilibrium with various boundary conditions. We find new regimes, separated by $N^{th}$-order exceptional points, which can be classified as overdamped, underdamped and critically damped phases. Despite these new regimes, long-time order is only present at zero temperature. Additionally, we explore the low-energy behavior of the system in various limits, including the ageing and spatio-temporal Porod regimes, demonstrating that non-reciprocity induces unique scaling behavior at zero temperature. Lastly, we present general results for systems where spins interact with no more than two spins, outlining the conditions under which long-time order may exist.

Title: Electronic density of states as the descriptor of elastic bond strength, ductility, and local lattice distortion in BCC refractory alloys
Authors: Dharmendra Pant, Dilpuneet S. Aidhy
Abstract: Although electronic density of states (DOS) is fundamental to materials properties, its general relationship to mechanical properties of alloys is not well established. In this paper, using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we show that the electronic occupancy at the Fermi level, N(Ef), obtained from DOS is a key descriptor of alloy strength and ductility. Our comprehensive analysis of numerous body centered cubic (BCC) refractory high entropy alloys (RHEAs) shows an overwhelming correlation that low N(Ef) indicates strong bonds that have high stiffness resulting in high elastic constants. High bond stiffness indicates presence of covalent nature of bonds that are directional in nature resulting in resistance to deformation leading to high bulk (B) and shear (G) moduli. Consequently, N(Ef) provides a direct correlation to the tendency of alloy ductility evidenced in the Pugh ratio (G/B). As stiffer bonds result in lower local lattice distortion (LLD), N(Ef) are LLD are also found to be corelated which opens up a correlation to solid solution strengthening and yield strength. Thus, this work unveils fundamental correlations between N(Ef) and (1) elastic bond strength, (2) ductility, and (3) LLD. These correlations open opportunities for the design of high strength high ductile RHEAs.

Title: Resolving phonon-mediated superconducting pairing symmetries from first-principles calculation
Authors: Zimeng Zeng, Xiaoming Zhang, Shunhong Zhang, Jian Wu, Zheng Liu
Abstract: The quest for topological superconductors triggers revived interests in resolving non-s-wave pairing channels mediated by phonons. While density functional theory and density functional perturbtaion theory have established a powerful framework to calculate electron-phonon couplings in real materials in a first-principles way, its application is largely limited to conventional s-wave superconductivity. Here, we formulate an efficient and simple-to-use algorithm for first-principles pairing channel analysis, and apply it to several representative material systems.

Title: Scaling behavior and phases of nonlinear sigma model on real Stiefel manifolds near two dimensions
Authors: A.M. Gavrilik, A.V. Nazarenko
Abstract: For a quasi-two-dimensional nonlinear sigma model on the real Stiefel manifolds with a generalized (anisotropic) metric, the equations of a two-charge renormalization group (RG) for the homothety and anisotropy of the metric as effective couplings are obtained in a one-loop approximation. Normal coordinates and the curvature tensor are exploited for the renormalization of the metric. The RG trajectories are investigated and the presence of a fixed point common to four critical lines or four phases (tetracritical point) in the general case, or its absence in the case of an Abelian structure group, is established. For the tetracritical point, the critical exponents are evaluated and compared with those known earlier for a simpler particular case.

Authors: Cesar A. Gallegos, Shengtao Jiang, Steven R. White, A. L. Chernyshev
Abstract: The phase diagram of the $S\!=\!1/2$ easy-axis triangular-lattice $J_1\!-\!J_2$ model is investigated using the density-matrix renormalization group and analytical insights. We find a significant spin-liquid region extending from the Heisenberg limit and residing between the Y phase-known as the magnetic analogue of the "supersolid"-and collinear stripe phase. The order parameters of the supersolid are analyzed and an understanding of its lack of ferromagnetic moment is suggested.

Title: Axionic quantum criticality of generalized Weyl semimetals
Authors: Gabriel Malave, Rodrigo Soto-Garrido, Vladimir Juricic, Bitan Roy
Abstract: We formulate a field-theoretic description for $d$-dimensional interacting nodal semimetals, featuring dispersion that scales with the linear and $n$th power of momentum along $d_L$ and $d_M$ mutually orthogonal directions around a few isolated points in the reciprocal space, respectively, with $d_L+d_M=d$, and residing at the brink of isotropic insulation, described by $N_b$-component bosonic order parameter fields. The resulting renormalization group (RG) procedure, tailored to capture the associated quantum critical phenomena, is controlled by a ``small" parameter $\epsilon=2-d_M$ and $1/N_f$, where $N_f$ is the number of identical fermion copies (flavor number) when in conjunction $d_L=1$. When applied to three-dimensional interacting general Weyl semimetals ($d_L=1$ and $d_M=2$), characterized by the Abelian monopole charge $n>1$, living at the shore of the axionic insulation ($N_b=2$), a leading-order RG analysis suggests the Gaussian nature of the underlying quantum phase transition, around which the critical exponents assume mean-field values. A traditional field-theoretic RG analysis yields the same outcomes for simple Weyl semimetals ($n=1$, $d_L=3$, and $d_M=0$). Consequently, emergent marginal Fermi liquids showcase only logarithmic corrections to physical observables at intermediate scales of measurements.

Title: Sliding Luttinger Liquid and Topological Flat Bands in Symmetry Mismatched Moiré Interfaces
Authors: Abhijat Sarma
Abstract: In this work we analyze a class of Moiré models consisting of an active honeycomb monolayer such as graphene or a hexagonal transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) on top of a substrate, in which the K and K' valleys of the active layer are folded near each other by a suitably chosen substrate geometry. Generalizing the so-called ``coupled-valley'' model of Scheer et al. [1], we start from a microscopic tight-binding description, deriving a continuum model from Schrieffer-Wolff perturbation theory and obtaining an effective description of the low-energy momentum states in either valley as well as the explicit microscopic forms of the Moiré potentials. We then consider two explicit symmetry-mismatched Moiré geometries with a rectangular substrate, the first of which displays an emergent time-reversal symmetry as well as a broad parameter regime which displays quasi-1D physics characterized by the existence of a Sliding Luttinger Liquid phase. This model also has a nontrivial topological character, captured by the Berry curvature dipole. The second geometry displays an emergent $C_3$ rotational symmetry despite the rectangular substrate, reducing to a continuum model considered in Ref. [1] that was shown to display honeycomb and Kagome topological flat bands.

Title: Odd dynamics of passive objects in a chiral active bath
Authors: Cory Hargus, Federico Ghimenti, Julien Tailleur, Frédéric van Wijland
Abstract: When submerged in a chiral active bath, a passive object becomes a spinning ratchet imbued with odd transport properties. We present the most general Langevin dynamics for a rigid body in a chiral active bath, in the adiabatic limit of large object mass. For rotationally symmetric objects, odd diffusion and odd mobility are connected by an Einstein relation, that we show numerically to break down outside the adiabatic limit. As the object symmetry decreases, its dynamics becomes increasingly irreversible: a massive disk exhibits an effective equilibrium dynamics, while a rod admits distinct translational and rotational temperatures, and a wedge is fully this http URL, this departure from equilibrium can be read in universal far-field currents and density modulations of the bath, which we measure numerically and derive analytically.

Title: Reflections of topological properties in the planar-Hall response for semimetals carrying pseudospin-1 quantum numbers
Authors: Firdous Haidar, Ipsita Mandal
Abstract: We continue our investigations of the nature of the linear-response tensors in planar-Hall and planar-thermal Hall configurations, involving three-dimensional nodal-point semimetals, by considering here nodes hosting pseudospin-1 quasiparticles. Such systems exemplify multifold semimetals, as they have three bands crossing at a nodal point. We derive the explicit expressions of the electric, thermoelectric, and thermal coefficients, when the nodes are subjected to the combined influence of an electric field (and/or temperature gradient) and a weak (i.e., nonquantizing) magnetic field. In order to have a complete description, we consider the effects of the Berry curvature and the orbital magnetic moment on an equal footing, both of which originate from the underlying topological features of the bandstructure. Going beyond our previous works, we determine the out-of-plane response comprising the intrinsic anomalous-Hall and the Lorentz-force-contributed currents, and chalk out the effects of internode scatterings as well. Our theoretical explorations shed light on the mechanisms of transport in multifold semimetals, which are being investigated in contemporary experiments.

Title: Viscosity of polymer melts using non-affine theory based on vibrational modes
Authors: Ankit Singh, Vinay Vaibhav, Alessio Zaccone
Abstract: Viscosity, a fundamental transport and rheological property of liquids, quantifies the resistance to relative motion between molecular layers and plays a critical role in understanding material behavior. Conventional methods, such as the Green-Kubo (GK) approach, rely on time integration of correlation functions, which becomes computationally intensive near the glass transition due to slow correlation decay. A recently proposed method based on non-affine lattice dynamics (NALD) and instantaneous normal mode analysis offers a promising alternative for estimating the viscosity. In this study, we apply the NALD approach to compute the viscosity of the Kremer-Grest polymer system over a range of temperatures and compare these results with those from the GK method and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Our findings reveal that all vibration modes, including the instantaneous normal modes, contribute to the viscosity. This work presents an efficient framework for calculating viscosity across diverse systems, including near the glass transition where the GK method is no longer applicable. Also, it opens the avenue to understanding the role of different vibrational modes linked with structure, facilitating the design of materials with tunable rheological properties.

Title: Spin models from nonlinear cellular automata
Authors: Konstantinos Sfairopoulos, Luke Causer, Jamie F. Mair, Stephen Powell, Juan P. Garrahan
Abstract: We extend the study of 1D elementary cellular automata (CA) to the nonlinear rules, following our study of the linear rules in Ref.[arXiv:2309.08059]. We thus construct the respective classical spin models and obtain their zero temperature ground states. We argue that these models are examples of frustrated systems where their ground state space can be exactly and systematically calculated. By including quantum fluctuations through the addition of a transverse field, we study their ground state quantum phases and phase transitions. We use rules 30, 54 and 201 as a probe of our two main results: (a) for small transverse fields we identify an order-by-disorder mechanism which stabilizes the classical phase, and (ii) we observe a first-order quantum phase transition between the classical and quantum paramagnetic phases when the transverse field strength equals the classical coupling strength, as for the linear rules.

Title: Active Hydrodynamic Theory of Euchromatin and Heterochromatin
Authors: S. Alex Rautu, Alexandra Zidovska, David Saintillan, Michael J. Shelley
Abstract: The genome contains genetic information essential for cell's life. The genome's spatial organization inside the cell nucleus is critical for its proper function including gene regulation. The two major genomic compartments -- euchromatin and heterochromatin -- contain largely transcriptionally active and silenced genes, respectively, and exhibit distinct dynamics. In this work, we present a hydrodynamic framework that describes the large-scale behavior of euchromatin and heterochromatin, and accounts for the interplay of mechanical forces, active processes, and nuclear confinement. Our model shows contractile stresses from cross-linking proteins lead to the formation of heterochromatin droplets via mechanically driven phase separation. These droplets grow, coalesce, and in nuclear confinement, wet the boundary. Active processes, such as gene transcription in euchromatin, introduce non-equilibrium fluctuations that drive long-range, coherent motions of chromatin as well as the nucleoplasm, and thus alter the genome's spatial organization. These fluctuations also indirectly deform heterochromatin droplets, by continuously changing their shape. Taken together, our findings reveal how active forces, mechanical stresses and hydrodynamic flows contribute to the genome's organization at large scales and provide a physical framework for understanding chromatin organization and dynamics in live cells.

Title: A theoretical framework for investigating the role of stiffness heterogeneity in structure and dynamics of flexible polymer
Authors: Arvind Saini, Rajiblochan Sahoo, Rajarshi Chakrabarti, Sayantan Dutta
Abstract: Heteropolymers are ubiquitous in both synthetic systems, such as block copolymers, and biological macromolecules, including proteins and nucleic acids. Beyond their chemical composition, these polymers often exhibit spatial variations in physical properties. For instance, in biopolymers such as chromatin, stiffness heterogeneity arises from inherent molecular features as well as extensile or contractile active forces. In this letter, we develop a theoretical framework that extends the physics of flexible polymers, a widely used tool to describe biopolymer dynamics, to incorporate spatially varying stiffness. Using this approach, we specifically analyze the structure and dynamics of flexible heteropolymers with periodic stepwise stiffness profiles. We find that stiffness heterogeneity leads to qualitative deviations in dynamical observables such as mean squared displacement while also increasing structural anisotropy. Altogether, this framework provides a platform to interpret stiffness heterogeneity from experimental data especially for biopolymers as well as to design heteropolymers with tailored structural and dynamic properties.

Title: Shear Strain-Induced Multiferroic Response in the Altermagnetic Semiconductor CuFeS$_2$
Authors: Roman Malyshev, Bjørnulf Brekke, Ingeborg-Helene Svenum, Sverre M. Selbach, Christoph Brüne, Arne Brataas, Thomas Tybell
Abstract: CuFeS$_2$ is an altermagnetic semiconductor that is lattice-matched with silicon and has a high Néel temperature. It is nonpolar and magnetically compensated in its structural ground state. However, the crystal belongs to a magnetic symmetry class allowing simultaneous piezoelectricity and -magnetism, indicating that distortion by shear strain may enable functional properties not observed in its tetragonal ground state. This first-principles study explores how biaxial and shear strain affect the crystal structure and functional properties. Biaxial strain lowers crystal symmetry when applied to two of the three crystallographic {001} planes considered, enhancing the altermagnetic lifting of the Kramers degeneracy. Shear strain has a compressive effect on the crystal, enhancing the effects on the electronic structure seen under biaxial compressive strain. Applying it to any one of the three {001} planes induces a polar phase with an out-of-plane electric polarization, perpendicular to the strained plane. Moreover, applying shear strain to two out of the three {001} planes induces a net magnetization simultaneously with electric polarization, producing a multiferroic response.

Title: Magnetoelectric control of spin helicity and nonreciprocal charge transport in a multiferroic metal

Abstract: A multiferroic state with both electric polarization ($P$) and magnetization ($M$) shows the inherently strong $P$-$M$ coupling, when $P$ is induced by cycloidal (Néel-wall like) spin modulation. The sign of $P$ is determined by clockwise or counterclockwise rotation of spin, termed the spin helicity. Such a multiferroic state is not limited to magnetic insulators but can be broadly observed in conductors. Here, we report the current-induced magnetoelectric control of the multiferroics in a helimagnetic metal YMn$_6$Sn$_6$ and its detection through nonreciprocal resistivity (NRR). The underlying concept is the coupling of the current with the toroidal moment $T \sim P \times M \sim (\hat{q} \times \chi_v) \times M$ as well as with the magneto-chirality $\chi_v \times M$, where $\hat{q}$ and $\chi_v$ being the unit modulation wave vector and the vector spin chirality, respectively. We furthermore observe an enhancement of NRR by the spin-cluster scattering via $\chi_v$ and its fluctuation. These findings may pave a way to exploration of multiferroic conductors and application of the spin-helicity degree of freedom as a state-variable.

Title: Penetration of surface effects on structural relaxation and particle hops in glassy films
Authors: Qiang Zhai, Hai-Yao Deng, Xin-Yuan Gao, Leo S.I. Lam, Sen Yang, Ke Yan, Chi-Hang Lam
Abstract: A free surface induces enhanced dynamics in glass formers. We study the dynamical enhancement of glassy films with a distinguishable-particle lattice model of glass free of elastic effects. We demonstrate that the thickness of the surface mobile layer depends on temperature differently under different definitions, although all are based on local structure relaxation rate. The rate can be fitted to a double exponential form with an exponential-of-power-law tail. Our approach and results exclude elasticity as the unique mechanism for the tail. Layer-resolved particle hopping rate, potentially a key measure for activated hopping, is also studied but it exhibits much shallower surface effects.

Title: Non-Equilibrating a Black Hole with Inhomogeneous Quantum Quench
Authors: Kanato Goto, Masahiro Nozaki, Shinsei Ryu, Kotaro Tamaoka, Mao Tian Tan
Abstract: We study quantum quench processes in (1+1)-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) in which the initial thermal equilibrium (Gibbs) state is time-evolved by spatially inhomogeneous Hamiltonians, the so-called Möbius and sine-square-deformed (SSD) Hamiltonians. We found that, when the quench is induced by the SSD Hamiltonian, almost all the degrees of freedom are asymptotically gathered at a single point, resulting in a point-like excitation. This excitation, which we dub black hole-like excitation, carries as much information as the total thermal entropy. In contrast, other parts of the system approach the low-entropy (low-temperature) state at late times. For the quench by the Möbius Hamiltonian, we instead found an eternal periodic oscillation of physical quantities such as von Neumann entropy for subsystems. When the CFT admits a holographic dual description, the SSD quench induces a time-dependent, inhomogeneous deformation of the bulk black hole horizon, which, at late enough times, ``touches'' the boundary. Our quench setups can be used as a way to create low-temperature states, and, also, simulate the formation and evaporation processes of black holes.

Abstract: Cryo-computing - both classical and quantum, is severely limited by the absence of a suitable cryo-memory. The challenge both in terms of energy efficiency and speed have been known for decades, but so far conventional technologies have not been able to deliver adequate performance. Here we present a novel non-volatile memory device which incorporates a superconducting nanowire and an all-electronic charge configuration memristor (CCM) based on switching between charge-ordered states in a layered dichalcogenide material. We investigate the time-dynamics and current-voltage characteristics of such a device fabricated using a NbTiN nanowire and a 1T-TaS2 CCM. The observed dynamical response of the device is faithfully reproduced by modelling of the superconducting order parameter showing versatility of application. The inherent ultrahigh energy efficiency and speed of the device, which is compatible with single flux quantum logic, leads to a promising new memory concept for use in cryo-computing and quantum computing peripheral devices.

Title: Wavelet correlation noise analysis for qubit operation variable time series

Abstract: In quantum computing, characterizing the full noise profile of qubits can aid in increasing coherence times and fidelities by developing error-mitigating techniques specific to the noise present. This characterization also supports efforts in advancing device fabrication to remove sources of noise. Qubit properties can be subject to non-trivial correlations in space and time, for example, spin qubits in MOS quantum dots are exposed to noise originating from the complex glassy behavior of two-level fluctuator ensembles. Engineering progress in spin qubit experiments generates large amounts of data, necessitating analysis techniques from fields experienced in managing large data sets. Fields such as astrophysics, finance, and climate science use wavelet-based methods to enhance their data analysis. Here, we propose and demonstrate wavelet-based analysis techniques to decompose signals into frequency and time components, enhancing our understanding of noise sources in qubit systems by identifying features at specific times. We apply the analysis to a state-of-the-art two-qubit experiment in a pair of SiMOS quantum dots with feedback applied to relevant operation variables. The observed correlations serve to identify common microscopic causes of noise, such as two-level fluctuators and hyperfine coupled nuclei, as well as to elucidate pathways for multi-qubit operation with more scalable feedback systems.

Title: Von Neumann Algebras in Double-Scaled SYK
Authors: Jiuci Xu
Abstract: It's been argued that a finite effective temperature emerges and characterizes the thermal property of double-scaled SYK model in the infinite temperature limit \cite{Lin:2022nss}. Meanwhile, in the static patch of de Sitter, the maximally entangled state satisfies a KMS condition at infinite temperature \cite{Witten:2023xze}, suggesting the Type II$_1$ nature of the observable algebra gravitationally dressed to the observer. In this work, we analyze the double-scaled algebra generated by chord operators in the double-scaled SYK model and demonstrate that it exhibits features reflecting both perspectives. Specifically, we prove that the algebra is a Type II$_1$ factor, and that the empty state with no chord satisfies the tracial property, in agreement with expectations from \cite{Lin:2022rbf}. We further show that this state is cyclic and separating for the double-scaled algebra, based on which we explore its modular structure. We then explore various physical limits of the theory, drawing connections to JT gravity, the Hilbert space of baby universes, and Brownian double-scaled SYK. We also present analytic solutions to the energy spectrum in both the zero- and one-particle sectors of the left/right chord Hamiltonian.

Title: Nonreciprocal Local-Resonance Induced Complex Band Hybridization
Authors: Wang Tat Yau, Kai Fung Lee, Raymond P. H. Wu, Wai Chun Wong, Jensen Li, C. T. Chan, Kin Hung Fung
Abstract: We study the complex band hybridization induced by nonreciprocal local resonances in photonic crystals. Composed of trimer unit cells, a two-dimensional (2D) magnetophotonic crystal with an analytically obtainable solution is considered. We find that nonreciprocal spectral gap may appear without nonreciprocal transmission and that the imaginary parts of the complex wavevectors $\text{Im}(\mathbf{k})$ may blow up at resonance to give extreme nonreciprocal transmission. We further show that, for a subwavelegnth lattice, the isolation ratio for the nonreciprocal transmission is determined solely by $\text{Im}(\mathbf{k})$ instead of the extensively studied real part $\text{Re}(\mathbf{k})$. Our finding contradicts the common belief that "spectral nonreciprocity [$\omega(\mathbf{k})\neq\omega(-\mathbf{k})$] always implies nonreciprocal transmission".

Title: Evidence of equilibrium dynamics in human social networks evolving in time
Authors: Miguel A. González-Casado, Andreia Sofia Teixeira, Angel Sánchez
Abstract: How do networks of relationships evolve over time? We analyse a dataset tracking the social interactions of 900 individuals over four years. Despite continuous shifts in individual relationships, the macroscopic structural properties of the network remain stable, fluctuating within predictable bounds. We connect this stability to the concept of equilibrium in statistical physics. Specifically, we demonstrate that the probabilities governing network dynamics are stationary over time, and key features like degree, edge, and triangle abundances align with theoretical predictions from equilibrium dynamics. Moreover, the dynamics satisfies the detailed balance condition. Remarkably, equilibrium persists despite constant turnover as people join, leave, and change connections. This suggests that equilibrium arises not from specific individuals but from the balancing act of human needs, cognitive limits, and social pressures. Practically, this equilibrium simplifies data collection, supports methods relying on single network snapshots (like Exponential Random Graph Models), and aids in designing interventions for social challenges. Theoretically, it offers new insights into collective human behaviour, revealing how emergent properties of complex social systems can be captured by simple mathematical models.

Title: Degeneracies In a Weighted Sum of Two Squares
Authors: Ishan Vinayagam Ramesh, Maxim Olshanii
Abstract: This work is an attempt to classify and quantify instances when a weighted sum of two squares of positive integers, $3n_{1}^2+n_{2}^2$, can be realized in more than one way. Our project was inspired by a particular study of two-dimensional quantum billiards [S. G. Jackson, H. Perrin, G. E. Astrakharchik, and M. Olshanii, SciPost Phys. Core 7, 062 (2024)] where the weighted sums of interest represents an energy level with the two integers being the billiard's quantum numbers; there, the 3-fold degeneracies seem to dominate the energy spectrum. Interestingly, contrary to the conventional paradigm, these degeneracies are not caused by some non-commuting symmetries of the system.

Title: The boundary entropy function for interface conformal field theories
Authors: Evangelos Afxonidis, Andreas Karch, Chitraang Murdia
Abstract: {In 1+1 dimensional conformal field theory with a boundary the boundary contribution to the entanglement entropy is determined by a single number $g$ effectively counting the boundary degrees of freedom. In contrast, in 1+1 dimensional interface CFTs the corresponding quantity is a non-trivial {\it function} depending on the position of the interval relative to the interface, giving access to much more detailed information about the defect. In this work we determined this $g$-function in several examples using holography and derive some of its basic properties from holography and strong subadditivity.

Title: Moments and saddles of heavy CFT correlators
Authors: David Poland, Gordon Rogelberg
Abstract: We study the operator product expansion (OPE) of identical scalars in a conformal four-point correlator as a Stieltjes moment problem, and use Riemann-Liouville type fractional differential operators to transform the correlation function into a classical moment-generating function. We use crossing symmetry to derive leading and subleading relations between moments in $\Delta$ and $J_2 = \ell(\ell+d-2)$ in the ``heavy" limit of large external scaling dimension, and combine them with constraints from unitarity to derive two-sided bounds on moment sequences in $\Delta$ and the covariance between $\Delta$ and $J_2$. The moment sequences which saturate these bounds produce ``saddle point" solutions to the crossing equations which we identify as particular limits of correlators in a generalized free field (GFF) theory. This motivates us to study perturbations of heavy GFF four-point correlators by way of saddle point analysis, and we show that saddles in the OPE arise from contributions of fixed-length operator families encoded by a decomposition into deformed higher-spin conformal blocks. To apply our techniques, we consider holographic correlators of four identical single scalar fields perturbed by a bulk interaction, and use their first few moments to derive Gaussian weight-interpolating functions that predict the OPE coefficients of interacting double-twist operators in the heavy limit. We further compute tree-level perturbations on saddles in 1/2 BPS Wilson line defect correlators in planar $\mathcal{N} = 4$ SYM, making predictions about deformations of families of long operators.

Title: Optimal generalisation and learning transition in extensive-width shallow neural networks near interpolation
Authors: Jean Barbier, Francesco Camilli, Minh-Toan Nguyen, Mauro Pastore, Rudy Skerk
Abstract: We consider a teacher-student model of supervised learning with a fully-trained two-layer neural network whose width $k$ and input dimension $d$ are large and proportional. We provide an effective theory for approximating the Bayes-optimal generalisation error of the network for any activation function in the regime of sample size $n$ scaling quadratically with the input dimension, i.e., around the interpolation threshold where the number of trainable parameters $kd+k$ and of data $n$ are comparable. Our analysis tackles generic weight distributions. We uncover a discontinuous phase transition separating a "universal" phase from a "specialisation" phase. In the first, the generalisation error is independent of the weight distribution and decays slowly with the sampling rate $n/d^2$, with the student learning only some non-linear combinations of the teacher weights. In the latter, the error is weight distribution-dependent and decays faster due to the alignment of the student towards the teacher network. We thus unveil the existence of a highly predictive solution near interpolation, which is however potentially hard to find by practical algorithms.

Title: No-go theorem for environment-assisted invariance in non-unitary dynamics
Authors: Akira Sone, Akram Touil, Kenji Maeda, Paola Cappellaro, Sebastian Deffner
Abstract: We elucidate the requirements for quantum operations that achieve environment-assisted invariance (envariance), a symmetry of entanglement. While envariance has traditionally been studied within the framework of local unitary operations, we extend the analysis to consider non-unitary local operations. First, we investigate the conditions imposed on operators acting on pure bipartite entanglement to attain envariance. We show that the local operations must take a direct-sum form in their Kraus operator representations, establishing decoherence-free subspaces. Furthermore, we prove that this also holds for the multipartite scenario. As an immediate consequence, we demonstrate that environment-assisted shortcuts to adiabaticity cannot be achieved through non-unitary operations. In addition, we show that the static condition of the eternal black hole in AdS/CFT is violated when the CFTs are coupled to the external baths.

Title: Nonequilibrium Universality of a Squeezing Phase Transition
Authors: Arman Duha, S. E. Begg, Thomas Bilitewski
Abstract: We investigate phase transitions in the nonequilibrium dynamics of power-law interacting spin-1/2 bilayer XXZ models, which have recently been shown to allow generation of entanglement in the form of two-mode squeezing. We find a transition between a phase characterized by Heisenberg limited squeezing and a partially collective phase. We identify universal scaling of the squeezing dynamics in terms of system parameters and a divergent time-scale, establishing these as distinct dynamical phases. Our work demonstrates a novel dynamical phase transition with potential applications in quantum sensing and quantum simulation in cold-atomic, molecular or Rydberg platforms.

Title: Monte Carlo study on Heisenberg model with local dipolar interaction
Authors: Etsuko Itou, Akira Matsumoto, Yu Nakayama, Toshiki Onagi
Abstract: Aharony and Fisher showed that non-local dipolar effects in magnetism destabilize the Heisenberg fixed point in real ferromagnets, leading to a new fixed point, called the dipolar fixed point. The non-perturbative nature of the new fixed point, however, has not been uncovered for many decades. Inspired by the recent understanding that the dipolar fixed point is scale-invariant but not conformal invariant, we perform the Monte Carlo simulation of the local Heisenberg-dipolar model on the lattice of $40^3$ by introducing the local cost function parameterized by a parameter $\lambda$ and study its critical exponents, which should become identical to the dipolar fixed point of Aharony and Fisher in the infinite coupling limit $\lambda = \infty$. We find that the critical exponents become noticeably different from those of the Heisenberg fixed point for a finite coupling constant $\lambda=8$ (e.g. $\nu=0.601(2)(^{+0}_{-2})$ in the local Heisenberg-dipolar model while $\nu=0.712(1)(^{+3}_{-0})$ in the Heisenberg model), and the spin correlation function has a feature that it becomes divergence-free, implying the lack of conformal invariance.

Title: Hybrid interfaces at the single quantum level in fluorescent molecules
Authors: Daniele De Bernardis, Hugo Levy-Falk, Elena Fanella, Rocco Duquennoy, Maja Colautti, Costanza Toninelli
Abstract: We theoretically investigate a single fluorescent molecule as a hybrid quantum optical device, in which multiple external laser sources exert control of the vibronic states. In the high-saturation regime, a coherent interaction is established between the vibrational and electronic degrees of freedom, and molecules can simulate several cavity QED models, whereby a specific vibrational mode plays the role of the cavity mode. Focusing on the specific example where the system is turned into an analogue simulator of the quantum Rabi model, the steady state exhibits vibrational bi-modality resulting in a statistical mixture of highly non-classical vibronic cat states. Applying our paradigm to molecules with prominent spatial asymmetry and combining an optical excitation with a THz(IR) driving, the system can be turned into a single photon transducer. Two possible implementations are discussed based on the coupling to a subwavelength THz patch antenna or a resonant metamaterial. In a nutshell, this work assesses the role of molecules as an optomechanical quantum toolbox for creating hybrid entangled states of electrons, photons, and vibrations, hence enabling frequency conversion over very different energy scales.

Title: Prethermalization by Random Multipolar Driving on a 78-Qubit Superconducting Processor

Abstract: Time-dependent drives hold the promise of realizing non-equilibrium many-body phenomena that are absent in undriven systems. Yet, drive-induced heating normally destabilizes the systems, which can be parametrically suppressed in the high-frequency regime by using periodic (Floquet) drives. It remains largely unknown to what extent highly controllable quantum simulators can suppress heating in non-periodically driven systems. Using the 78-qubit superconducting quantum processor, Chuang-tzu 2.0, we report the experimental observation of long-lived prethermal phases in many-body systems with tunable heating rates, driven by structured random protocols, characterized by $n$-multipolar temporal correlations. By measuring both the particle imbalance and subsystem entanglement entropy, we monitor the entire heating process over 1,000 driving cycles and observe the existence of the prethermal plateau. The prethermal lifetime is `doubly tunable': one way by driving frequency, the other by multipolar order; it grows algebraically with the frequency with the universal scaling exponent $2n{+}1$. Using quantum state tomography on different subsystems, we demonstrate a non-uniform spatial entanglement distribution and observe a crossover from area-law to volume-law entanglement scaling. With 78 qubits and 137 couplers in a 2D configuration, the entire far-from-equilibrium heating dynamics are beyond the reach of simulation using tensor-network numerical techniques. Our work highlights superconducting quantum processors as a powerful platform for exploring universal scaling laws and non-equilibrium phases of matter in driven systems in regimes where classical simulation faces formidable challenges.

Authors: Wenjie Shang, Jiahang Zhou, J.P. Panda, Zhihao Xu, Yi Liu, Pan Du, Jian-Xun Wang, Tengfei Luo
Abstract: This paper introduces JAX-BTE, a GPU-accelerated, differentiable solver for the phonon Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE) based on differentiable programming. JAX-BTE enables accurate, efficient and differentiable multiscale thermal modeling by leveraging high-performance GPU computing and automatic differentiation. The solver efficiently addresses the high-dimensional and complex integro-differential nature of the phonon BTE, facilitating both forward simulations and data-augmented inverse simulations through end-to-end optimization. Validation is performed across a range of 1D to 3D simulations, including complex FinFET structures, in both forward and inverse settings, demonstrating excellent performance and reliability. JAX-BTE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art BTE solvers in forward simulations and uniquely enables inverse simulations, making it a powerful tool for multiscale thermal analysis and design for semiconductor devices.

Title: Topological Phase Transition and Geometrical Frustration in Fourier Photonic Simulator
Authors: Yuxuan Sun, Weiru Fan, Xingqi Xu, Da-Wei Wang, Hai-Qing Lin
Abstract: XY models with continuous spin orientation play a pivotal role in understanding topological phase transitions and emergent frustration phenomena, such as superconducting and superfluid phase transitions. However, the complex energy landscapes arising from frustrated lattice geometries and competing spin interactions make these models computationally intractable. To address this challenge, we design a programmable photonic spin simulator capable of emulating XY models with tunable lattice geometries and spin couplings, allowing systematic exploration of their statistical behavior. We experimentally observe the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition in a square-lattice XY model with nearest-neighbor interactions, accurately determining its critical temperature. Expanding to frustrated systems, we implement the approach in triangular and honeycomb lattices, uncovering sophisticated phase transitions and frustration effects, which are consistent with theoretical predictions. This versatile platform opens avenues for probing unexplored XY model phenomena across diverse geometries and interaction schemes, with potential applications in solving complex optimization and machine learning problems.
