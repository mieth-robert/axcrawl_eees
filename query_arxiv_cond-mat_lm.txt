Title: Theory of Nonlinear Spectroscopy of Quantum Magnets
Authors: Anubhav Srivastava, Stefan Birnkammer, GiBaik Sim, Michael Knap, Johannes Knolle
Abstract: Two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) is an established method for characterizing molecules and has been proposed in the THz regime as a new tool for probing exotic excitations of quantum magnets; however, the precise nature of the coupling between pump field and spin degrees of freedom has remained unclear. Here, we develop a general response theory of 2DCS and show how magneto-electric as well as polarization couplings contribute to 2DCS in addition to the typically assumed magnetization. We propose experimental protocols to distill individual contributions, for instance from exchange-striction or spin current mechanism, when the electric field couples to terms quadratic in spin operators. We provide example calculations for the paradigmatic twisted Kitaev chain material $\mathrm{CoNb}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{6}$ and highlight the crucial role of contributions from cross-coupling between polarization and magnetic nonlinear susceptibilities. Our work paves the way for systematic studies of light-matter couplings in quantum magnets and for establishing 2DCS as a versatile tool for probing fractional excitations of exotic magnetic quantum phases.

Title: Quarter Metal Superconductivity
Authors: Chiho Yoon, Tianyi Xu, Yafis Barlas, Fan Zhang
Abstract: We investigate the recently discovered multiple superconducting states in rhombohedral graphene quarter metal. We demonstrate that one of these states features a single-spin, single-valley, single-band, single-Fermi-pocket parent state and is most likely a chiral topological pair-density wave, marked by a threefold symmetry that may not be spontaneously broken, unpaired Majorana zero modes at edges, vortices, and dislocations, and an anomalous intrinsic superconducting diode effect.

Title: Shining light on collective modes in moiré fractional Chern insulators
Authors: Nisarga Paul, Ahmed Abouelkomsan, Aidan Reddy, Liang Fu
Abstract: We show that collective excitations and optical responses of moiré fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) drastically differ from those of standard fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states in a Landau level. By constructing a variational wavefunction that incorporates the moiré lattice effect, we capture the collective modes in FCIs across a range of crystal momenta including the roton minimum. Interestingly, new collective modes -- ``fractional excitons'' -- are found in the long wavelength limit ($\boldsymbol{q} \rightarrow 0$) at low energy below the excitation continuum, distinct from the FQH case. Some of these modes are optically active and manifest as sharp peaks in optical conductivity at THz frequency. We further show that intraband optical absorption and spectral weight in twisted ${\rm MoTe}_2$ are highly tunable by the displacement field. Our work thus establishes optical spectroscopy as a powerful tool to illuminate the unique collective modes of moiré FCIs.

Title: Theory of magnetoroton bands in moiré materials
Authors: Bishoy M. Kousa, Nicolás Morales-Durán, Tobias M. R. Wolf, Eslam Khalaf, Allan H. MacDonald
Abstract: The recent realizations of the Hofstadter butterfly and fractional Chern insulators in moiré materials have introduced a new ingredient, a periodic lattice potential, to the study of quantum Hall phases. While the fractionalized states in moiré systems are expected to be in the same universality class as their counterparts in Landau levels, the periodic potential can have qualitative and quantitative effects on physical observables. Here, we examine how the magnetoroton collective modes of fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states are altered by external periodic potentials. Employing a single-mode-approximation, we derive an effective Hamiltonian for the low-energy neutral excitations expressed in terms of three-point density correlation functions, which are computed using Monte Carlo. Our analysis is applicable to FQH states in graphene with a hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) substrate and also to fractional Chern insulator (FCI) states in twisted MoTe$_2$ bilayers. We predict experimentally testable trends in the THz absorption characteristics of FCI and FQH states and estimate the external potential strength at which a soft-mode phase transition occurs between FQH and charge density wave (CDW) states.

Title: On the Electronic Structure of Kagome metals $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$
Authors: Keyu Zeng, Zhan Wang, Kun Jiang, Ziqiang Wang
Abstract: The kagome metals $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A=$ K, Cs, Rb) have become a fascinating materials platform following the discovery of many novel quantum states due to the interplay between electronic correlation, topology, and geometry. Understanding their physical origin requires constructing effective theories that capture the low-energy electronic structure and electronic interactions. While the band structure calculated by density functional theory (DFT) broadly agrees with experiments in the unbroken symmetry phase, the multiorbital nature challenges a proper understanding of the band structure and its description by tight-binding models. Here, we point out the unusual and puzzling properties of the DFT electronic structure, including the sublattice type of the van Hove singularities, the geometric shape of the Fermi surface, and the orbital content of the low-energy band dispersion, which cannot be described by the commonly used one-orbital or multiorbital kagome tight-binding models. We address these fundamental puzzles and develop an extended Slater-Koster formalism that can successfully resolve these issues. We discover the important role of site-symmetry and interorbital hopping structure and provide a concrete multiorbital tight-binding model description of the electronic structure for $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ and the family of ``135'' compounds with other transition metals. This is a crucial step toward studying the effects of electron-electron interactions for the correlated and topological states in kagome metals and superconductors.

Title: Developing fractional quantum Hall states at even-denominator fillings 1/6 and 1/8
Authors: Chengyu Wang, P. T. Madathil, S. K. Singh, A. Gupta, Y. J. Chung, L. N. Pfeiffer, K. W. Baldwin, M. Shayegan
Abstract: In the extreme quantum limit, when the Landau level filling factor $\nu<1$, the dominant electron-electron interaction in low-disorder two-dimensional electron systems leads to exotic many-body phases. The ground states at even-denominator $\nu=$ 1/2 and 1/4 are typically Fermi seas of composite fermions carrying two and four flux quanta, surrounded by the Jain fractional quantum Hall states (FQHSs) at odd-denominator fillings $\nu=p/(2p\pm1)$ and $\nu=p/(4p\pm1)$, where $p$ is an integer. For $\nu<$ 1/5, an insulating behavior, which is generally believed to signal the formation of a pinned Wigner crystal, is seen. Our experiments on ultrahigh-quality, dilute, GaAs two-dimensional electron systems reveal developing FQHSs at $\nu=p/(6p\pm1)$ and $\nu=p/(8p\pm1)$, manifested by magnetoresistance minima superimposed on the insulating background. In stark contrast to $\nu=$ 1/2 and 1/4, however, we observe a pronounced, sharp minimum in magnetoresistance at $\nu=$ 1/6 and a somewhat weaker minimum at $\nu=$ 1/8, suggesting developing FQHSs, likely stabilized by the pairing of composite fermions that carry six and eight flux quanta. Our results signal the unexpected entry, in ultrahigh-quality samples, of FQHSs at even-denominator fillings 1/6 and 1/8, which are likely to harbor non-Abelian anyon excitations.

Title: Mesoscale Modeling of an Active Colloid's Motion
Authors: Matthew Dobson, David Masse
Abstract: This paper uses Cahn-Hilliard equations as a mesoscale model of the motion of active colloids. The model attempts to capture the driving mechanisms and qualitative behavior of the isotropic colloids originally proposed by J. Decayeaux in 2021. We compare our model against the single colloid behavior presented in that work, as well as against multi-colloid systems.

Title: Spin relaxation and transport behaviors in altermagnetic systems
Authors: Y.J. Sun, F. Yang, L.Q. Chen
Abstract: The D'yakonov-Perel' (DP) spin-relaxation mechanism has traditionally been associated with either relativistic spin-orbit coupling, which breaks space-inversion symmetry, or inhomogeneous magnetization, which breaks both time-reversal and translational symmetries. Here, we investigate spin relaxation mechanism in altermagnetic systems which possess novel magnetic states characterized by sublattices connected through crystal-rotation symmetries and opposite spins with zero overall net magnetization and absence of spin-orbit coupling. We find that altermagnetic states exhibit DP-type spin relaxations in both strong- and weak-scattering regimes, with the spin relaxation rate decreasing to zero as the temperature approaches the critical temperature of the altermagnetic phase transition. However, the scattering time involved in this spin relaxation mechanism is not the momentum relaxation time, in contrast to the conventional DP spin relaxation. Using a kinetic approach incorporating rigorous microscopic scattering, we demonstrate that the spin Hall current is highly anisotropic and proportional to the degree of altermagnetic order.

Title: Hole Spin in Direct Bandgap Germanium-Tin Quantum Dot
Authors: Nicolas Rotaru, Patrick Del Vecchio, Oussama Moutanabbir
Abstract: Germanium (Ge) has emerged as a contender for scalable solid-state spin qubits. This interest stems from the numerous attractive properties of hole spin in Ge low-dimensional systems and their compatibility with the standards of silicon processing. Herein, we show that the controlled incorporation of Sn into the Ge lattice enables hole spin quantum dots that retain the same advantages as those made of Ge while also providing bandgap directness. The latter is essential for a more efficient interaction with light, a key feature in the implementation of photon-spin interfaces and quantum memories. We first map the material properties for a range of Ge$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$ planar heterostructures to identify the optimal conditions to simultaneously achieve hole spin confinement and bandgap directness. Although compressive strain is necessary for heavy hole confinement, we estimate that an additional 4.5 at.% of Sn is needed for every 1% increase in the absolute value of compressive strain to preserve the direct bandgap. However, a high compressive strain is found to be detrimental to the Rashba coupling. Moreover, a theoretical framework is derived to evaluate the dipole moment $d$ and the relaxation rate $\Gamma$ of electric dipole spin resonance quantum dot devices. We compare the perturbative and effective values of $d$ with the values obtained from the full 3D Hamiltonian. We find $d$ to be around 1 and 0.01 e pm for the out-of-plane and in-plane configurations, respectively, and $\Gamma\propto B^5$, eventually becoming $\propto B^7$ in the out-of-plane configuration.

Title: Microscopic Theory of Chern Polarization
Authors: Thivan M. Gunawardana, Frank Schindler, Ari M. Turner, Ryan Barnett
Abstract: The modern theory of polarization does not apply in its original form to systems with non-trivial band topology. Chern insulators are one such example since they are insulating in the bulk but exhibit metallic edge states, complicating the definition of polarization. Wannier functions formed a key ingredient of the original modern theory of polarization, but it has been considered that these cannot be applied to Chern insulators since they are no longer exponentially localized and the Wannier center is no longer gauge invariant. In this Letter, we provide an unambiguous definition of absolute polarization for a Chern insulator in terms of the Zak phase. We obtain our expression by studying the non-quantized fractional charge bound to lattice dislocations and it can be computed directly from bulk quantities and makes no assumption on the edge state filling. Our result is fully consistent with previous results on the quantized charge bound to dislocations in the presence of crystalline symmetry. At the same time, our result is more general since it also applies to Chern insulators which do not have crystalline symmetries other than translations.

Title: First-principles Investigation of Exceptional Coarsening-resistant V-Sc(Al2Cu)4 Nanoprecipitates in Al-Cu-Mg-Ag-Sc Alloys
Authors: Junyuan Bai, Hao Xue, Jiaming Li, Xueyong Pang, Zhihao Zhao, Gang Liu, Gaowu Qin
Abstract: Aluminum-copper-magnesium-sliver (Al-Cu-Mg-Ag) alloys are extensively utilized in aerospace industries due to the formation of Omega this http URL, the rapid coarsening of these nano-plates above 475 K restricts their application at elevated this http URL introducing scandium (Sc) to these alloys, the service temperature of the resultant alloys can reach an unprecedented 675 K, attributed to the in situ formation of a coarsening-resistant V-Sc(Al2Cu)4 phase within the Omega nano-plates. However, the fundamental thermodynamic properties and mechanisms behind the remarkable coarsening resistance of V nano-plates remain this http URL, we employ first-principles calculations to investigate the phase stability of V-Sc(Al2Cu)4 phase, the basic kinetic features of V phase formation within Omega nano-plates, and the origins of the extremely high thermal stability of V nano-plates. Our results indicate that V-Sc(Al2Cu)4 is meta-stable and thermodynamically tends to evolve into a stable ScAl7Cu5 phase. We also demonstrate that kinetic factors are mainly responsible for the temperature dependence of V phase formation. Notably, the formation of V-Sc(Al2Cu)4 within Omega nano-plates modifies the Kagome lattice in the shell layer of the Omega nano-plates, inhibiting further thickening of V nano-plates through the thickening pathway of Omega nano-plates. This interface transition leads to the exceptional coarsening resistance of the V nano-plates. Moreover, we also screened 14 promising element substitutions for Sc. These findings are anticipated to accelerate the development of high-performance Al alloys with superior heat resistance.

Title: Atomic layer etching of niobium nitride using sequential exposures of O$_2$ and H$_2$/SF$_6$ plasmas
Authors: Azmain A. Hossain, Sela Murphy, David S. Catherall, Anthony J. Ardizzi, Austin J. Minnich
Abstract: Niobium nitride (NbN) is a metallic superconductor that is widely used for superconducting electronics due to its high transition temperature ($T_c$) and kinetic inductance. Processing-induced damage negatively affects the performance of these devices by mechanisms such as microwave surface loss. Atomic layer etching (ALE), with its ability to etch with Angstrom-scale control and low damage, has the potential to address these issues, but no ALE process is known for NbN. Here, we report such a process consisting of sequential exposures of O$_2$ plasma and H$_2$/SF$_6$ plasma. Exposure to O$_2$ plasma rather than O$_2$ gas yields a greater fraction of Nb in the +5 oxidation state, which is then volatilized by NbF$_5$ formation with exposure to an H$_2$/SF$_6$ plasma. The SF$_6$:H$_2$ flow rate ratio is chosen to produce selective etching of Nb$_2$O$_5$ over NbN, enabling self-limiting etching within a cycle. An etch rate of 1.77 Å/cycle was measured at 125 $^\circ$C using ex-situ ellipsometry. The $T_c$ of the ALE-etched film is higher than that of an RIE-etched film of a similar thickness, highlighting the low-damage nature of the process. These findings have relevance for applications of NbN in single-photon detectors and superconducting microresonators.

Title: Ductility mechanisms in complex concentrated refractory alloys from atomistic fracture simulations
Authors: Wenqing Wang, Punit Kumar, David H. Cook, Flynn Walsh, Buyu Zhang, Pedro P.P.O. Borges, Diana Farkas, Robert O. Ritchie, Mark Asta
Abstract: The striking variation in damage tolerance among refractory complex concentrated alloys is examined through the analysis of atomistic fracture simulations, contrasting behavior in elemental Nb with that in brittle NbMoTaW and ductile Nb45Ta25Ti15Hf15. We employ machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), including a new MLIP developed for NbTaTiHf, in atomistic simulations of crack tip extension mechanisms based on analyses of atomistic fracture resistance curves. While the initial behavior of sharp cracks shows good correspondence with the Rice theory, fracture resistance curves reveal marked changes in fracture modes for the complex alloys as crack extension proceeds. In NbMoTaW, compositional complexity appears to promote dislocation nucleation relative to pure Nb, despite theoretical predictions that the alloy should be relatively more brittle. In Nb45Ta25Ti15Hf15, alloying not only changes the fracture mode relative to elemental Nb, but promotes dislocation accumulation at the crack tip, leading to higher resistance to crack propagation.

Title: Swirling topological textures of polarization in bulk relaxor ferroelectrics
Authors: M. Eremenko, V. Krayzman, S. Gorfman, A. Bosak, H. Y. Playford, P. A. Chater, B. Ravel, W. J. Laws, F. Ye, A. Minelli B.-X. Wang, Z-G. Ye, M. G. Tucker, I. Levin
Abstract: A complete understanding of the mechanisms for dielectric relaxation in relaxor ferroelectrics remains elusive. We used a structural refinement framework that integrates several types of experimental data to identify the nanoscale correlations of polarization and their relationship to the underlying chemistry in the classic relaxor system PbMg1/3Nb2/3O3-PbTiO3. The polar structure in these materials in their bulk cubic state can be represented as overlapping anisotropic volumes, each encompassing unit cells with projections of their polarization vectors onto the volume's longest axis pointing in the same direction. The overlap results in swirling topological textures of polarization containing vortices, such as merons, and displaying smooth changes in the polarization directions. The locations of these vortices are linked to the electric charge gradient caused by compositional heterogeneities, deemed to create depolarizing fields.

Title: Controlling spin currents with magnon interference in a canted antiferromagnet

Abstract: Controlling spin current lies at the heart of spintronics and its applications. The sign of spin currents is monotonous in ferromagnets once the current direction is determined. Spin currents in antiferromagnets can possess opposite polarization, but requires enormous magnetic fields to lift the degeneracy. Controlling spin currents with different polarization is urgently demanded but remains hitherto elusive. Here, we demonstrate the control of spin currents at room temperature by magnon interference in a canted antiferromagnet, hematite recently also classified as an altermagnet. Magneto-optical characterization by Brillouin light scattering revealed that the spatial periodicity of the beating patterns was tunable via the microwave frequency. The inverse spin-Hall voltage changed sign as the frequency was scanned, i.e., a frequency-controlled switching of polarization in pure spin currents was obtained. Our work marks the use of antiferromagnetic magnon interference to control spin currents, which substantially extends the horizon for the emerging field of coherent antiferromagnetic spintronics.

Title: Quantum Transport in Reduced Graphene Oxide Measured by Scanning Probe Microscopy
Authors: Julian Sutaria, Cristian Staii
Abstract: We report combined scanning probe microscopy and transport measurements to investigate the local electronic transport properties of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) devices. We demonstrate that the quantum transport properties in these materials can be significantly tuned by the electrostatic potential applied by an atomic force microscope (AFM) conducting tip. Scanning gate microscopy measurements show a distinct p-type response, where the AFM tip locally gates the rGO, thereby modulating the transport current. Additional scanning impedance microscopy measurements indicate shifts in the Fermi energy under different gating conditions, highlighting the strong influence of local electrostatic potentials on the transport characteristics of rGO. We demonstrate that the interplay between the tip-induced Fermi level shifts and defect-mediated scattering processes plays a key role in determining the observed transport behavior. Our findings emphasize the crucial role of scattering mechanisms, particularly resonant scattering caused by impurities or structural defects, in determining low-dimensional transport behavior in rGO. Notably, rGO exhibits resonant scattering effects akin to those seen in one-dimensional systems like carbon nanotubes, despite its two-dimensional structure. These insights advance our current understanding of charge transport in rGO, and have important implications for its use in nanoscale electronics, flexible sensors, and tunable optoelectronic devices.

Title: Ultralow-temperature ultrafast synthesis of wafer-scale single-crystalline graphene via metal-assisted graphitization of silicon-carbide

Abstract: Non-conventional epitaxial techniques, such as vdWE and remote epitaxy, have attracted substantial attention in the semiconductor research community for their exceptional capability to continuously produce high-quality free-standing films. The successful implementation of these emerging epitaxial techniques crucially hinges on creating a robust uniform 2D material surface at the wafer-scale and with atomically precise uniformity. The conventional method for fabricating graphene on a SiC wafer is through high-temperature graphitization, which produces epitaxial graphene on the surface of the SiC wafer. However, the extremely high temperature needed for silicon sublimation (> 1500 C) causes step-bunching of the SiC surface in addition to the growth of uneven graphene at the edges of the step, leading to multilayer graphene stripes and unfavorable surface morphology for epitaxial growth. Here, we fully develop a graphitization technique that allows fast synthesis of single-crystalline graphene at ultra-low temperatures (growth time of less than 1 min and growth temperature of less than 500 C) at wafer-scale by metal-assisted graphitization. We found annealing conditions that enable SiC dissociation while avoiding silicide formation, which produces single-crystalline graphene while maintaining atomically smooth surface morphology. The thickness of the graphene layer can be precisely controlled by varying the metal thickness or annealing temperature. We successfully produce freestanding single-crystalline ultra-wide bandgap (AlN, GaN) films on graphene/SiC via the 2D material-based layer transfer technique. Our results show that low-temperature graphene synthesis via MAG represents a promising route for the commercialization of the 2D-based epitaxy technique, enabling the production of large-scale ultra-wide bandgap free-standing crystalline membranes.

Title: Incongruent Melting and Phase Diagram of SiC from Machine Learning Molecular Dynamics
Authors: Yu Xie, Senja Ramakers, Menghang Wang, Frans Spaepen, Boris Kozinsky
Abstract: Silicon carbide (SiC) is an important technological material, but its high-temperature phase diagram has remained unclear due to conflicting experimental results about congruent versus incongruent melting. Here, we employ large-scale machine learning molecular dynamics (MLMD) simulations to gain insights into SiC decomposition and phase transitions. Our approach relies on a Bayesian active learning workflow to efficiently train an accurate machine learning force field on density functional theory data. Our large-scale simulations provide direct evidence of the incongruent melting of SiC, confirming its decomposition into silicon-rich and carbon phases at high temperature and pressure. During cooling at high pressures, carbon nanoclusters nucleate and grow within the homogeneous molten liquid. During heating, the decomposed mixture reversibly transitions back into a homogeneous SiC liquid. The full pressure-temperature phase diagram of SiC is systematically constructed using MLMD simulations, providing new understanding of the nature of phases, resolving long-standing inconsistencies from previous experiments and yielding technologically relevant implications for processing and deposition of this material.

Title: Colloidal Magnus effect in polymer solutions
Authors: Marco De Corato, Kun Zhang, Lailai Zhu
Abstract: Rotating particles moving in fluids undergo a transverse migration via the inertia-induced Magnus effect. This phenomenon vanishes at colloidal scales because inertia is negligible and the fluid flow is time reversible. Yet, recent experiments discovered an inverse Magnus effect of colloids in polymeric and micellar solutions supposedly because their viscoelasticity breaks the time reversibility. Our study shows that classical viscoelastic features -- normal-stress differences and/or shear-thinning cannot explain this phenomenon. Instead, it originates from local polymer density inhomogeneities due to their stress-gradient-induced transport, a mechanism increasingly important at smaller scales -- indeed relevant to colloidal experiments. Incorporating this mechanism into our model leads to quantitative agreement with the experiments without fitting parameters. Our work provides new insights into colloidal motion in complex fluids with microstructural inhomogeneities, offers a simple mechanistic theory for predicting the resulting migration, and underscores the necessity of assimilating these findings in future designs of micro-machinery including swimmers, actuators, rheometers, and so on.

Title: Anomalous energy gap in superconducting La$_{2.85}$Pr$_{0.15}$Ni$_2$O$_7$/SrLaAlO$_4$ heterostructures
Authors: Jianchang Shen, Yu Miao, Zhipeng Ou, Guangdi Zhou, Yaqi Chen, Runqing Luan, Hongxu Sun, Zikun Feng, Xinru Yong, Peng Li, Yueying Li, Lizhi Xu, Wei Lv, Zihao Nie, Heng Wang, Haoliang Huang, Yu-Jie Sun, Qi-Kun Xue, Zhuoyu Chen, Junfeng He
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in bilayer nickelate thin films under ambient pressure provides an opportunity to directly investigate characteristic energy scales of the superconducting state from electronic structure. Here, we successfully probe the energy gap and dispersion renormalization in one unit-cell La$_{2.85}$Pr$_{0.15}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films epitaxially grown on SrLaAlO$_4$ substrates, by developing an ultra-high vacuum quenching technique for in-situ angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements. The energy gap is observed on the underlying Fermi surface without showing a node along the Brillouin zone diagonal. This gap exhibits particle-hole symmetric behavior and persists to a temperature higher than the superconducting transition temperature, indicating the existence of a pseudogap. An abrupt band renormalization is observed with a dispersion anomaly at ~70 meV below Fermi level, pointing to another energy scale besides the energy gap. These observations provide initial information on fundamental properties of the superconducting state in bilayer nickelates under ambient pressure.

Title: Probing Mixed Valence States by Nuclear Spin-Spin Relaxation Time Measurements
Authors: Yoshihiko Ihara, Masakazu Shimohashi, Markus Kriener
Abstract: Several elements in the periodic table exhibit an interesting and often overlooked feature: They skip certain valence states which is discussed in the field of superconductivity to be in favor of fostering higher transition temperatures $T_c$. However, from the experimental point of view, it is often deemed difficult to probe changes in the valence state. Here we demonstrate that the latter are accessible by the spin-spin relaxation rate $1/T_2$ in nuclear magnetic resonance. As target material, we chose the solid solution Ge$_{1-x}$In$_x$Te, where valence-skipping In induces superconductivity and changes its valence state as a function of $x$. We observe a strong enhancement in $1/T_2(x)$ and, most importantly, find that $1/T_2$ and $T_c$ exhibit a strikingly similar $x$ dependence. These results underline the importance of valence physics for the evolution of superconductivity in Ge$_{1-x}$In$_x$Te. A model based on a Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida type of interaction among the In nuclei is proposed which fully accounts for the experimental results.

Title: Exact mobility edges in quasiperiodic network models with slowly varying potentials
Authors: Hai-Tao Hu, Yang Chen, Xiaoshui Lin, Ai-Min Guo, Guangcan Guo, Ming Gong, Zijing Lin
Abstract: Quasiperiodic potentials without self-duality are always hard to derive the exact mobility edges (MEs). Here, we propose a new class of network models with exactly solvable MEs, characterized by quasiperiodic slowly varying potentials that do not exhibit hidden self-duality. We present two methods to derive the MEs, the first involves integrating out the periodic sites to obtain an effective Hamiltonian with effective potential $g(E)V$ and effective eigenenergy $f(E)$, which directly yields the MEs at $f(E) = \pm(2t\pm g(E)V)$, and the second is to connect the localized-delocalized transition points of the quasiperiodic slowly varying models and the real-complex transition points of the eigenvalue equations. To illustrate this, we take quasiperiodic mosaic slowly varying models as examples, and we find that the MEs obtained from the two methods are the same. Furthermore, we generalize our methods to quasiperiodic network models and propose a possible experimental realization based on optical waveguide systems, showing that the Anderson transition can be observed even using small physical systems (with $L = 50 - 100$). Our results may provide insight into understanding and realizing exact MEs in experiments.

Title: Breathing ferroelectricity induced topological valley states in kagome niobium halide monolayers
Authors: Kai-Qi Wang, Jun-Ding Zheng, Wen-Yi Tong, Chun-Gang Duan
Abstract: In recent years, kagome lattices have garnered significant attention for their diverse properties in topology, magnetism, and electron correlations. However, the exploration of breathing kagome lattices, which exhibit dynamic breathing behavior, remains relatively scarce. Structural breathing introduces an additional degree of freedom that is anticipated to fine-tune the electronic structure, potentially leading to exotic properties within the system. In this study, we employ a combination of the kp model and first-principles calculations to explore how breathing ferroelectricity can modulate valley states within a monolayer of niobium halide with breathing kagome lattice. Through the interplay of magnetoelectric coupling and the lock-in between breathing and ferroelectric states, we demonstrate that a dynamically breathing process, when controlled by an appropriately applied electric field, can achieve valley polarization reversal and generate multiple valley states, including those that are topologically nontrivial. These state transformations may couple to distinctive properties in circularly-polarized optical responses and various valley Hall effects. Consequently, our results suggest that materials featuring breathing kagome lattices represent promising platforms for studying the interplay among structure, charge, spin, and valley degrees of freedom, a crucial step toward developing multifunctional devices.

Title: Experimental evidence of Tc enhancement above 50 K and diode and paramagnetic-Meissner effects, in Nickelate films on highly reduced $SrTiO_3$
Authors: Anna Eyal, Gad Koren
Abstract: Since the discovery of superconductivity in nickelate thin films in 2019, the quest for enhancing their $T_c$ has been ongoing. Here we provide experimental evidence for $T_c$ enhancement in oxygen deficient films on highly reduced and conducting $SrTiO_3$ substrates. $T_c$ onset of 50-70 K was found in Meissner and transport measurements, which indicates superconductivity in islands or domains in our films, where $T_c$ of zero resistance is obtained at 20-25 K. In addition, we observed a giant paramagnetic-Meissner effect peak at about 48 K, which further supports the existence of a superconductive transition just above it. Furthermore, an asymmetric or nonreciprocal and non-hysteretic superconductive diode effect was observed. The later could be fully polarized, and its polarity could be reversed. The specific phase responsible for these notable effects was not yet identified, and further research is needed in order to identify and isolate the relevant phase.

Title: Symplectic-Amoeba formulation of the non-Bloch band theory for one-dimensional two-band systems
Authors: Shin Kaneshiro, Robert Peters
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect is a topological phenomenon, resulting in the condensation of bulk modes near the boundaries. Due to the localization of bulk modes at the edges, boundary effects remain significant even in the thermodynamic limit. This makes conventional Bloch band theory inapplicable and hinders the accurate computation of the spectrum. The Amoeba formulation addresses this problem by determining the potential from which the spectrum can be derived using the generalized Szegö's limit theorem, reducing the problem to an optimization of the Ronkin function. While this theory provides novel insights into non-Hermitian physics, challenges arise from the multiband nature and symmetry-protected degeneracies, even in one-dimensional cases. In this work, we investigate one-dimensional two-band class AII$^\dagger$ systems, where Kramers pairs invalidate the conventional Amoeba formalism. We find that these challenges can be overcome by optimizing the band-resolved Ronkin functions, which is achieved by extrapolating the total Ronkin function. Finally, we propose a generalized Szegö's limit theorem for class AII$^\dagger$ and numerically demonstrate that our approach correctly computes the potential and localization length.

Title: High-throughput computational screening of Heusler compounds with phonon considerations for enhanced material discovery
Authors: Enda Xiao, Terumasa Tadano
Abstract: High-throughput (HTP) $ab$ $initio$ calculations are performed on 27,865 Heusler compositions, covering a broad range of regular, inverse, and half-Heusler compounds in both cubic and tetragonal phases. In addition to conventional stability metrics, such as formation energy, Hull distance, and magnetic critical temperature $T_{\mathrm{c}}$, phonon stability is assessed by systematically conducting $ab$ $initio$ phonon calculations for over 8,000 compounds. The performance of $ab$ $initio$ stability criteria is systematically assessed against 189 experimentally synthesized compounds, and magnetic critical temperature calculations are validated using 59 experimental data points. As a result, we identify 631 stable compounds as promising candidates for further functional material exploration. Notably, 47 low-moment ferrimagnets are identified, with their spin polarization and anomalous Hall/Nernst conductivity calculated to provide insights into potential applications in spintronics and energy harvesting. Furthermore, our analyses reveal linear relationship between $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ and magnetization in 14 systems and correlations between stability and atomic properties such as atomic radius and ionization energy. The regular/inverse structures preference in $X_2YZ$ compound and tetragonal distortion are also investigated for a broad Heusler family.

Title: Stacking, Strain-Engineering Induced Altermagnetism, Multipiezo Effect, and Topological State in Two-Dimensional Materials

Abstract: Altermagnetism, as a newly identified form of unconventional antiferromagnetism, enables the removal of spin degeneracy in the absence of net magnetization that provides a platform for the low power consumption and ultra-fast device applications. However, the rare attention has been paid to the relationship between stacking, strain and altermagnet, multipiezo effect and topological state. Here, we propose a mechanism to realize the altermagnet, multipiezo effect, and topological state in two-dimensional materials by the stacking and strain engineering. Based on the analysis of symmetry, we find that the spin splitting feature related to the Ut, PTt, MzUt, or MzPTt symmetries in altermagnet multilayers. In addition, we find that the stacking engineering can effectively realize the transform from antiferromagnetism to altermagnetism and semiconductor to metal for the Jauns bilayer V2SeTeO. More interestingly, the strain not only induces an intriguing multipiezo effect, encompassing the piezovalley, piezomagnetism and piezoelectric, but also achieves the abundant topological phase. Our findings offer a generalized direction for manipulating the spin splitting, valley polarization, and topological states, promoting practical application of valleytronic and spintronic devices based on two-dimensional altermagnets.

Title: A Peanut-hull-PLA based 3D printing filament with antimicrobial effect
Authors: Sabarinathan Palaniyappan, Narain Kumar Sivakumar, Ahmed S. Dalaq
Abstract: Peanut hulls, also known as Arachis hypogaea L. particles (AHL), are an abundant biomass source with a long shelf life. In this study, we incorporate peanut hull powder into PLA polymer, imparting recyclability, biodegradability, and biocompatibility, along with the antimicrobial properties of AHL particles. In particular, we treat AHL particles as a reinforcement for PLA polymer to produce 3D printing filament compatible with the fused filament fabrication (FFF) 3D printing method. We provide a step-by-step method for preparing AHL particles, incorporating them into PLA, and ultimately forming high-quality filaments. We assess the quality of the filaments in terms of extruded dimensions, mechanical strength, and elastic modulus, along with physical properties such as porosity and melt flow index. We evaluate the printability and wettability of the filaments as well. Notably, and unlike other biomass-based reinforcements in PLA, AHL preserves the filament's strength and enhances its elastic modulus. 3D-printed components fabricated using our PLA-AHL filaments successfully retain their antimicrobial properties and exhibit increased overall hardness. However, this comes at the expense of forming more microvoids and a rougher surface, making the material more prone to fracture and leading to a slight reduction in fracture toughness with increasing AHL mass fraction.

Title: Multimode operation of a superconducting nanowire switch in the nanosecond regime
Authors: Zoltán Scherübl, Mátyás Kocsis, Tosson Elalaily, Lőrinc Kupás, Martin Berke, Gergő Fülöp, Thomas Kanne, Karl Berggren, Jesper Nygård, Szabolcs Csonka, Péter Makk
Abstract: Superconducting circuits are promising candidates for future computational architectures, however, practical applications require fast operation. Here, we demonstrate fast, gate-based switching of an Al nanowire-based superconducting switch in time-domain experiments. We apply voltage pulses on the gate while monitoring the microwave transmission of the device. Utilizing the usual leakage-based operation these measurements yield a fast, 1--2~ns switching time to the normal state, possibly limited by the bandwidth of our setup, and a 10--20~ns delay in the normal to superconducting transition. However, having a significant capacitance between the gate and the device allows for a novel operation, where the displacement current, induced by the fast gate pulses, drives the transition. The switching from superconducting to the normal state yields a similar fast timescale, while in the opposite direction the switching is significantly faster (4--6~ns) than the leakage based operation, which may be further improved by better thermal design. The measured short timescales and novel switching operation open the way for future fast and low-power-consumption applications.

Title: Photoexcitation-induced Stacking Transition Assisted by Intralayer Reconstruction in Charge-Density-Wave Materials
Authors: Jin Zhang, Yang Yang, Jia Zhang, Mengxue Guan, Jiyu Xu, Kun Yang, Xinghua Shi, Sheng Meng
Abstract: Laser excitation has emerged as an effective tool for probing microscopic interactions and manipulating phases of matter. Among charge density wave (CDW) materials, 1T-TaS2 has garnered significant attention due to its diverse stacking orders and photoexcited responses. However, the mechanisms driving transitions among different stacking orders and the microscopic out-of-equilibrium dynamics remain unclear. We elucidate that photoexcitation can introduce interlayer stacking order transitions facilitated by laser-induced intralayer reconstruction in 1T-TaS2. Importantly, our finding reveals a novel pathway to introduce different phases through laser excitations, apparently distinct from thermally-induced phase transitions via interlayer sliding. In particular, photoexcitation is able to considerably change potential energy surfaces and evoke collective lattice dynamics. Consequently, the laser-induced intralayer reconstruction plays a crucial role in interlayer stacking-order transition, offering a new method to create exotic stackings and quantum phases. The exploration opens up great opportunities for manipulating CDW phases and electronic properties on the femtosecond timescale.

Title: Analysis methodology of coherent oscillations in time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
Authors: Nicolas Gauthier, Hadas Soifer, Jonathan A. Sobota, Heike Pfau, Edbert J. Sie, Aaron M. Lindenberg, Zhi-Xun Shen, Patrick S. Kirchmann
Abstract: Oscillatory signals from coherently excited phonons are regularly observed in ultrafast pump-probe experiments on condensed matter samples. Electron-phonon coupling implies that coherent phonons also modulate the electronic band structure. These oscillations can be probed with energy and momentum resolution using time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (trARPES) which reveals the orbital dependence of the electron-phonon coupling for a specific phonon mode. However, a comprehensive analysis remains challenging when multiple coherent phonon modes couple to multiple electronic bands. Complex spectral line shapes due to strong correlations in quantum materials add to this challenge. In this work, we examine how the frequency domain representation of trARPES data facilitates a quantitative analysis of coherent oscillations of the electronic bands. We investigate the frequency domain representation of the photoemission intensity and \tred{the first moment of the energy distribution curves}. Both quantities provide complimentary information and are able to distinguish oscillations of binding energy, linewidth and this http URL analyze a representative trARPES dataset of the transition metal dichalcogenide WTe$_2$ and construct composite spectra which intuitively illustrate how much each electronic band is affected by a specific phonon mode. We also show how a linearly chirped probe pulse can generate extrinsic artifacts that are distinct from the intrinsic coherent phonon signal.

Title: Distributed Current Injection into a 1D Ballistic Edge Channel
Authors: Kristof Moors, Christian Wagner, Helmut Soltner, Felix Lüpke, F. Stefan Tautz, Bert Voigtländer
Abstract: Quantized charge transport through a 1D ballistic channel was famously explained decades ago by Rolf Landauer, by considering local injection of charge carriers from two contacts at the ends of the 1D channel. With the rise of quantum (spin/anomalous) Hall insulators, i.e., 2D material systems with ballistic 1D edge states along their perimeter, a different geometry has become relevant: The distributed injection of charge carriers from a 2D half-plane with residual conductivity into the 1D edge channel. Here, we generalize Landauer's treatment of ballistic transport to such a setup and identify hallmark signatures that distinguish a ballistic channel from a resistive one.

Title: Revisiting the spin-orbit scattering in small-sized superconducting particles in the magnetic field
Authors: Serguei N. Burmistrov
Abstract: The Knight shift of nuclear magnetic resonance is an experimental probe of the paramagnetic spin susceptibility in metals. Information about the electron pairing in superconductors can be extracted from the Knight shift in the small-sized particles. The finite zero-temperature magnitude of paramagnetic susceptibility observed in the superconducting particles has been associated with the spin-orbit scattering of conduction electrons. The conventional treatment has delivered the paramagnetic susceptibility magnitude proportional to the square of the spin-orbit interaction amplitude. Here we examine the coupling between the superconducting current and the spin-orbit scattering of conduction electrons in the small-sized particles. Such interference coupling, absent in the normal state, results in an additional spin polarization of the conduction electrons generating the superconducting current in the magnetic field. This anomalous effect delivers the noticeably larger contribution to the paramagnetic susceptibility. The magnitude of the effect as well as the contribution to the paramagnetic susceptibility prove to be proportional to the amplitude of spin-orbit interaction. The frequency of electron paramagnetic resonance is shifted as well.

Title: Higher-order contagion processes in 1.99 dimensions
Authors: Sandro Melon, Andrea Gabrielli, Pablo Villegas
Abstract: Higher-order interactions have recently emerged as a promising framework for describing new dynamical phenomena in heterogeneous contagion processes. However, a fundamental open question is how to understand their contribution in the eyes of the physics of critical phenomena. Based on mesoscopic field-theoretic Langevin descriptions, we show that: (i) pairwise mechanisms as facilitation or thresholding are formally equivalent to higher-order ones, (ii) pairwise interactions at coarse-grained scales govern the higher-order contact process and, (iii) classical Imry-Ma arguments hold for networks with low spectral dimension. In short, we demonstrate that classical field theories, grounded on model symmetries and/or network dimensionality, still capture the nature of the phase transition, also predicting finite-size effects in real and synthetic networks.

Title: Surface acoustic wave driven acoustic spin splitter in d-wave altermagnetic thin films
Authors: Pieter M. Gunnink, Jairo Sinova, Alexander Mook
Abstract: The generation of spin currents is a key challenge in the field of spintronics. We propose using surface acoustic waves (SAWs) to generate spin currents in altermagnetic thin films, thereby realizing an acoustic spin splitter. Altermagnets, characterized by spin-polarized electrons and magnons, provide a versatile platform where SAWs can drive spin currents carried by both charge carriers and magnons. This acoustic spin splitter can be implemented in both metallic and insulating altermagnetic thin films, offering broad material applicability and a novel way to detect the spin splitter effect in insulating altermagnetic thin film. We examine a realistic experimental setup where a heavy metal layer, such as platinum, is used to convert the spin current into a measurable charge current via the inverse spin Hall effect. For representative material parameters, we calculate the expected spin current and the corresponding inverse spin Hall voltage. Furthermore, we demonstrate that tuning the SAW frequency allows for precise control over the spin current, highlighting the versatility and potential of the acoustic spin splitter for future spintronics applications.

Title: Algebraic Exact Solution for Driven Landau Levels in Two-dimensional Electron Gases
Authors: Li-kun Shi, Inti Sodemann Villadiego
Abstract: Controlling quantum systems with time-dependent fields opens avenues for engineering novel states of matter and exploring non-equilibrium phenomena. Landau levels in two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs), with their discrete energy spectrum and characteristic cyclotron dynamics, provide an important platform for realizing and studying such driven quantum systems. While exact solutions for driven Landau levels exist, they have been limited to specific gauges or representations. In this work, we present an algebraic, gauge- and representation-independent exact solution for driven Landau levels in 2DEGs subject to arbitrary time-dependent electromagnetic fields. Our approach, based on a time-dependent unitary transformation via the displacement operator, provides clear physical insights into the driven quantum dynamics. We apply this method to derive the exact Floquet states and quasienergies for periodically driven Landau levels, and we extend our analysis to the resonant driving regime, where the Floquet picture breaks down and the electron wavefunction exhibits unbounded spatial spreading. Furthermore, we calculate the instantaneous energy absorption rate, revealing distinct absorption behaviors between coherent states and Fock or thermal states, stemming from quantum interference effects.

Title: Multifield Induced Antiferromagnet Transformation into Altermagnet and Realized Anomalous Valley Hall Effect in Two-dimensional Materials
Authors: Hanbo Sun, Pengqiang Dong, Chao Wu, Ping Li
Abstract: Altermagnetism, as a new category of collinear magnetism distinct from traditional ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism, exhibits the spin splitting without net magnetization. Currently, researchers are focus on searching three-dimensional altermagnetism and exploring its novel physical properties. However, there is a lack of understanding of the physical origin of two-dimensional altermagnetic emergent behavior. Here, we propose an approach to realize the transition from Neel antiferromagnetism to altermagnetism in two-dimensional system using an electric field, Janus structure, and ferroelectric substrate. In monolayer VPSe3, we demonstrate that multiple-physical-fields cause the upper and lower Se atoms unequal to break PT symmetry, resulting in altermagnetic spin splitting. Noted that monolayer VPSe3 produces a spontaneous valley splitting of 2.91 meV at the conduction band minimum. The electric field can effectively tune the valley splitting magnitude, while the Janus structure not only changes the valley splitting magnitude, but also alters the direction. More interestingly, when the ferroelectric polarization of Al2S3 is upward, the direction of valley polarization is switched and the magnitude is almost unchanged. However, the valley splitting sigfinicantly increases under the downward. It is worth noting that the ferroelectric polarization can switch altermagnetic effect and realize anomalous valley Hall effect. Besides, we reveal the microscopic mechanism of valley splitting by an effective Hamiltonian. Our findings not only provide a method to designing altermagnet, but also enriches the valley physics.

Title: Continuously tunable anomalous Hall crystals in rhombohedral heptalayer graphene
Authors: Hanxiao Xiang, Jing Ding, Jiannan Hua, Naitian Liu, Wenqiang Zhou, Qianmei Chen, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Na Xin, Wei Zhu, Shuigang Xu
Abstract: The interplay of electronic interactions and nontrivial topology can give rise to a wealth of exotic quantum states. A notable example is the formation of Wigner crystals driven by strong electron-electron interactions. When these electronic crystals emerge in a parent band carrying a large Berry curvature, they can exhibit topologically nontrivial properties as anomalous Hall crystals, spontaneously breaking both continuous translational symmetry and time-reversal symmetry. Here, we report the experimental observation of tunable anomalous Hall crystals in rhombohedral heptalayer graphene moiré superlattices. At filling factors near one electron per moiré unit cell (v=1), we identify a series of incommensurate Chern insulators with a Chern number of C=1. Furthermore, we observe spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking spanning the entire filling range from v=1 to v=2, manifesting as anomalous Hall effects with pronounced magnetic hysteresis. Notably, anomalous Hall crystals with a high Chern number C=3 are observed over generic fillings ranging from v=1.5 to v=2. These anomalous Hall crystals are incommensurate with the moiré superlattice and exhibit dispersive fan diagrams consistent with the Streda formula, with their positions continuously tunable through displacement fields. Remarkably, these partially filled Chern insulators display Chern numbers distinct from their parent bands. Our findings demonstrate the rich variety of electronic crystalline states in rhombohedral graphene moiré superlattices, offering valuable insights into the strongly correlated topological phases.

Title: Listen! It's a phase transition. The sound of a shape-memory alloy
Authors: Carlo Andrea Rozzi, Annamaria Lisotti, Guido Goldoni, Valentina De Renzi
Abstract: The remarkable properties and numerous technological applications of shape-memory alloys are due to a solid-to-solid phase transition involving a temperature-driven rearrangement of their crystal structure. Here, we propose a simple, yet effective experiment probing the \textit{sound} emitted by a Ni$_{40}$Ti$_{50}$Cu$_{10}$ bar at different temperatures crossing the transition between martensite and austenite phases and we discuss the relationship with the elastic properties of the material. We show that the phase transition{\RED, which occurs slightly above room temperature,} can be qualitatively monitored by the ear and that a quantitative description of the phenomenon can be obtained using a very simple setup and sound analysis tools. We argue that such a sound-based investigation provides an unusual, stimulating way to experimentally introduce solid-to-solid phase transitions suitable for undergraduate courses.

Title: Novel Strontium Carbides Under Compression
Authors: Nikita Rybin, Evgeny Moerman, Pranab Gain, Artem R. Oganov, Alexander Shapeev
Abstract: Exploring the chemistry of materials at high pressures has lead to the discovery of previously unknown exotic compounds. Here, we systematically search for all thermodynamically stable Sr-C compounds under pressure (up to 100 GPa) using the ab initio evolutionary crystal structure prediction method. Our search lead to the discovery of hitherto unknown phases of SrC3, Sr2C5, Sr2C3, Sr2C, Sr3C2, and SrC. The newly discovered crystal structures feature a variety of different carbon environments ranging from isolated C anions and C-dimers to exotic polyatomic carbon anions including chains, stripes, and infinite ribbons consisting of pentagonal C5 and hexagonal C6 rings. Dynamical stability of all predicted compounds is confirmed by phonons calculations. Bader analysis unravels very diverse chemistry in these compounds and bonding patterns in some of them can be described using Zintl-Klemm rule.

Title: Magneto-Optics of Anisotropic Exciton Polaritons in Two-Dimensional Perovskites
Authors: Jonas K. König, Jamie M. Fitzgerald, Ermin Malic
Abstract: Layered 2D organic-inorganic perovskite semiconductors support strongly confined excitons that offer significant potential for ultrathin polaritonic devices due to their tunability and huge oscillator strength. The application of a magnetic field has proven to be an invaluable tool for investigating the exciton fine structure observed in these materials. Yet, the combination of an in-plane magnetic field and the strong coupling regime has remained largely unexplored. In this work, we combine microscopic theory with a rigorous solution of Maxwell's equations to model the magneto-optics of exciton polaritons in 2D perovskites. We predict that the brightened dark exciton state can enter the strong coupling regime. Furthermore, the magnetic-field-induced mixing of polarization selection rules and the breaking of in-plane symmetry lead to highly anisotropic polariton branches. This study contributes to a better understanding of the exciton fine structure in 2D perovskites and demonstrates the cavity control of highly anisotropic and polarization-sensitive exciton polaritons.

Title: Electronic Structures across the Superconductor-Insulator Transition at La$_{2.85}$Pr$_{0.15}$Ni$_2$O$_7$/SrLaAlO$_4$ Interfaces
Authors: Heng Wang, Haoliang Huang, Guangdi Zhou, Wei Lv, Changming Yue, Lizhi Xu, Xianfeng Wu, Zihao Nie, Yaqi Chen, Yu-Jie Sun, Weiqiang Chen, Hongtao Yuan, Zhuoyu Chen, Qi-Kun Xue
Abstract: Interfacial superconductivity discovered in bilayer nickelate heterostructures opens new avenues for effective tunability and control. Here, we report the superconductor-insulator transition in La$_{2.85}$Pr$_{0.15}$Ni$_2$O$_7$/SrLaAlO$_4$ interfaces, with corresponding electronic structures revealed using synchrotron low-temperature X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray linear dichroism (XLD). In addition to the valence states of each element within the films determined by XAS, XLD at the O K edge pre-peak reveals hybridizations involving both 2p$_{z}$ and 2p$_{x}$/2p$_{y}$ orbitals, which are concomitantly suppressed upon oxygen loss. Intriguingly, such oxygen loss that eliminates superconductivity, induces a qualitative XLD change at the Ni L$_{2}$ edge, implying significant transformations among 3d$_{x^{2}}$ $_{-y^{2}}$ and 3d$_{z^{2}}$ energy bands near the Fermi level. Our findings establish an element- and orbital-resolved electronic framework for the origin of superconductivity.

Title: Growth orientation and magnetic properties of GdVO$_3$ tailored by epitaxial strain engineering
Authors: M. Martirosyan, A. Gudima, J. Varignon, J. Ghanbaja, S. Migot, A. David, M. Guennou, O. Copie
Abstract: Transition-metal oxides with an ABO$_3$ perovskite structure exhibit significant coupling between spin, orbital, and lattice degrees of freedom, highlighting the crucial role of lattice distortion in tuning the electronic and magnetic properties of these systems. In this study, we grow a series of antiferromagnetic GdVO$_3$ thin films on different substrates introducing various strain values. The results demonstrate that the strain not only affects the material's structure and magnetic transition temperature but also influences the growth direction of the orthorhombic unit cell. A correlation is observed between the orientation of the orthorhombic long axis direction and the material's Néel temperature. DFT calculations highlighting the link between strain, lattice distortions and magnetic characteristics confirm these conclusions. Our findings demonstrate that the development of novel features in RVO$_3$ through material design requires control of growth orientation through strain engineering.

Title: Multicaloric effect in Fe48Rh52 alloy: case of combination magnetic field and uniaxial tension
Authors: Abdulkarim Amirov, Dibir Yusupov, Alexey Komlev, Maksim Koliushenkov, Alexander Kamantsev, Akhmed Aliev
Abstract: Mono and multicaloric effects in Fe48Rh52 alloy under applied magnetic field, uniaxial tension and their combination were studied by direct method. It was found that for single cases, the inverse caloric effect was observed with delta TAD = -2.9 K (1T) at 330 K in the case of the magnetocaloric effect and delta TAD = -0.5 K (104 MPa) at 328 K in the case of the elastocaloric effect. The combination co-application of the external 1 T magnetic field and a 104 MPa tensile results to the observation of a synergistic effect with delta TAD = -3.4 K at 330 K when a, which exceeds similar values for mono caloric effects. As was shown from comparison of calculation and experiments multicaloric effect it is not a sum of mono caloric effects and several factors as geometry of the sample as well the protocol for applying external fields should be taken into account. It was shown that the distribution of mechanical stresses in the Fe48Rh52 sample with a geometry in the shape of a plate with holes is heterogeneous, which should be taken into account when measuring calorific effects using tension through holes

Title: Scrutinizing the Mori memory function for diffusion in periodic quantum systems
Authors: Scott D. Linz, Jiaozi Wang, Robin Steinigeweg, Jochen Gemmer
Abstract: Diffusion is an ubiquitous phenomenon. It is a widespread belief that as long as the area under a current autocorrelation function converges in time, the corresponding spatiotemporal density dynamics should be diffusive. This may be viewed as a result of the combination of linear response theory with the Einstein relation. However, attempts to derive this statement from first principles are notoriously challenging. We first present a counterexample by constructing a correlation functions of some density wave, such that the area under the corresponding current autocorrelation function converges, but the dynamics do not obey a diffusion equation. Then we will introduce a method based on the recursion method and the Mori memory formalism, that may help to actually identify diffusion. For a decisive answer, one would have to know infinitely many so called Lanczos coefficients, which is unattainable in most cases. However, in the examples examined in this paper, we find that the practically computable number of Lanczos coefficients suffices for a strong guess.

Title: Seeing the unseen: laser speckles as a tool for coagulation tracking
Authors: Christoph Haessig, Flemming Møller
Abstract: The ability to measure protein functionality is critical for the development of plant-based products, particularly with respect to gelation behavior, which is vital for food structure and texture. Small amplitude oscillatory shear tests remain the standard for monitoring protein gelation; however, these methods are costly, time-consuming, and require physical contact with the sample. Laser speckle rheology, an optical-based technique, offers a contactless alternative by assessing rheological properties through speckle pattern fluctuations. In this work, we present a simple laser speckle rheology setup, utilizing a diode laser and a digital camera, to monitor rheological changes during the rennet coagulation of milk. We use a viscoelasticity index, derived from a two-dimensional linear correlation, to quantify speckle pattern fluctuations. The laser speckle rheology method is compared with conventional small amplitude oscillatory shear rheology. Results demonstrate that key characteristics of the coagulation process, including coagulation and gelation times, are temporally aligned between the two methods. Furthermore, the viscoelasticity index allows for the comparison of the complex modulus in samples with similar compositions under consistent acquisition parameters. These findings underscore the potential of laser speckle rheology as a cost-effective, rapid, and contactless approach for capturing protein gelation, providing a viable alternative to conventional shear rheological methods.

Title: Controlling dynamics of stochastic systems with deep reinforcement learning
Authors: Ruslan Mukhamadiarov
Abstract: A properly designed controller can help improve the quality of experimental measurements or force a dynamical system to follow a completely new time-evolution path. Recent developments in deep reinforcement learning have made steep advances toward designing effective control schemes for fairly complex systems. However, a general simulation scheme that employs deep reinforcement learning for exerting control in stochastic systems is yet to be established. In this paper, we attempt to further bridge a gap between control theory and deep reinforcement learning by proposing a simulation algorithm that allows achieving control of the dynamics of stochastic systems through the use of trained artificial neural networks. Specifically, we use agent-based simulations where the neural network plays the role of the controller that drives local state-to-state transitions. We demonstrate the workflow and the effectiveness of the proposed control methods by considering the following two stochastic processes: particle coalescence on a lattice and a totally asymmetric exclusion process.

Title: Inverse Materials Design by Large Language Model-Assisted Generative Framework
Authors: Yun Hao, Che Fan, Beilin Ye, Wenhao Lu, Zhen Lu, Peilin Zhao, Zhifeng Gao, Qingyao Wu, Yanhui Liu, Tongqi Wen
Abstract: Deep generative models hold great promise for inverse materials design, yet their efficiency and accuracy remain constrained by data scarcity and model architecture. Here, we introduce AlloyGAN, a closed-loop framework that integrates Large Language Model (LLM)-assisted text mining with Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs) to enhance data diversity and improve inverse design. Taking alloy discovery as a case study, AlloyGAN systematically refines material candidates through iterative screening and experimental validation. For metallic glasses, the framework predicts thermodynamic properties with discrepancies of less than 8% from experiments, demonstrating its robustness. By bridging generative AI with domain knowledge and validation workflows, AlloyGAN offers a scalable approach to accelerate the discovery of materials with tailored properties, paving the way for broader applications in materials science.

Title: Luttinger compensated bipolarized magnetic semiconductor
Authors: Peng-Jie Guo, Xiao-Yao Hou, Ze-Feng Gao, Huan-Cheng Yang, Wei Ji, Zhong-Yi Lu
Abstract: Altermagnetic materials, with real-space antiferromagnetic arrangement and reciprocal-space anisotropic spin splitting, have attracted much attention. However, the spin splitting is small in most altermagnetic materials, which is a disadvantage to their application in electronic devices. In this study, based on symmetry analysis and the first-principles electronic structure calculations, we predict for the first time two Luttinger compensated bipolarized magnetic semiconductors Mn(CN)2 and Co(CN)2 with isotropic spin splitting as in the ferromagnetic materials. Our further analysis shows that the Luttinger compensated magnetism here depends not only on spin group symmetry, but also on the crystal field splitting and the number of d-orbital electrons. In addition, the polarized charge density indicates that both Mn(CN)2 and Co(CN)2 have the quasi-symmetry T{\tau} , resulting from the crystal field splitting and the number of d-orbital electrons. The Luttinger compensated magnetism not only has the zero total magnetic moment as the antiferromagnetism, but also has the isotropic spin splitting as the ferromagnetism, thus our work not only provides theoretical guidance for searching Luttinger compensated magnetic materials with distinctive properties, but also provides a material basis for the application in spintronic devices.

Title: Magnetodielectric Properties in Two Dimensional Magnetic Insulators
Authors: Koushik Dey, Hasina Khatun, Anudeepa Ghosh, Soumik Das, Bikash Das, Subhadeep Datta
Abstract: Magnetodielectric (MD) materials are important for their ability to spin-charge conversion, magnetic field control of electric polarization and vice versa. Among these, two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) magnetic materials are of particular interest due to the presence of magnetic anisotropy (MA) originating from the interaction between the magnetic moments and the crystal field. Also, these materials indicate a high degree of stability in the long-range spin order and may be described using suitable spin Hamiltonians of the Heisenberg, XY, or Ising type. Recent reports have suggested effective interactions between magnetization and electric polarization in 2D magnets. However, MD coupling studies on layered magnetic materials are still few. This review covers the fundamentals of magnetodielectric coupling by explaining related key terms. It includes the necessary conditions for having this coupling and sheds light on the possible physical mechanisms behind this coupling starting from phenomenological descriptions. Apart from that, this review classifies 2D magnetic materials into several categories for reaching out each and every class of materials. Additionally, this review summarizes recent advancements of some pioneer 2D magnetodielectric materials. Last but not the least, the current review provides possible research directions for enhancing magnetodielectric coupling in those and mentions the possibilities for future developments.

Authors: Daniel Werner, Enrico Arrigoni
Abstract: We present a functional interpolation approach within the auxiliary master equation framework to efficiently and accurately solve correlated impurity problems in nonequilibrium dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). By leveraging a near-exact auxiliary bath representation, the method estimates corrections via interpolation over a few bath realisations, significantly reducing computational cost and increasing accuracy. We illustrate the approach on the Anderson impurity model and on the Hubbard model within DMFT, capturing equilibrium and long-lived photodoped states.

Title: Quantum entanglement of fermionic gapless symmetry protected topological phases in one dimension
Authors: Wen-Hao Zhong, Hai-Qing Lin, Xue-Jia Yu
Abstract: Quantum entanglement can be an effective diagnostic tool for probing topological phases protected by global symmetries. Recently, the notion of nontrivial topology in critical systems has been proposed and is attracting growing attention. In this work, as a concrete example, we explore the quantum entanglement properties of fermionic gapless topological states by constructing exactly solvable models based on stacked multiple Kitaev chains. We first analytically establish the global phase diagram using entanglement entropy and reveal three topologically distinct gapped phases with different winding numbers, along with three topologically distinct transition lines separating them. Importantly, we unambiguously demonstrate that two transition lines exhibit fundamentally different topological properties despite sharing the same central charge. Specifically, they display nontrivial topological degeneracy in the entanglement spectrum under periodic boundary conditions, thereby generalizing the Li-Haldane bulk-boundary correspondence to a broader class of fermionic gapless topological states. Additionally, we identify a novel Lifshitz multicritical point at the intersection of the three transition lines, which also exhibits nontrivial topological degeneracy. This work provides a valuable reference for investigating gapless topological phases of matter from the perspective of quantum entanglement.

Title: Diverse dynamics in interacting vortices systems through tunable conservative and non-conservative coupling strengths
Authors: A. Hamadeh, A. Koujok, D. R. Rodrigues, A. Riveros, V. Lomakin, G. Finocchio, G. De Loubens, O. Klein, P.Pirro
Abstract: Magnetic vortices are highly tunable, nonlinear systems with ideal properties for being applied in spin wave emission, data storage, and neuromorphic computing. However, their technological application is impaired by a limited understanding of non conservative forces, that results in the open challenge of attaining precise control over vortex dynamics in coupled vortex systems. Here, we present an analytical model for the gyrotropic dynamics of coupled magnetic vortices within nano pillar structures, revealing how conservative and non conservative forces dictate their complex behavior. Validated by micromagnetic simulations, our model accurately predicts dynamic states, controllable through external current and magnetic field adjustments. The experimental verification in a fabricated nano pillar device aligns with our predictions, and it showcases the system's adaptability in dynamical coupling. The unique dynamical states, combined with the system's tunability and inherent memory, make it an exemplary foundation for reservoir computing. This positions our discovery at the forefront of utilizing magnetic vortex dynamics for innovative computing solutions, marking a leap towards efficient data processing technologies.

Title: Coexisting Triferroic and Multiple Types of Valley Polarization by Structural Phase Transition in Two-Dimensional Materials
Authors: Chao Wu, Hanbo Sun, Pengqiang Dong, Yin-Zhong Wu, Ping Li
Abstract: The multiferroic materials, which coexist magnetism, ferroelectric, and ferrovalley, have broad practical application prospects in promoting the miniaturization and integration of spintronic and valleytronic devices. However, it is rare that there are triferroic orders and multiple types of valley polarization in a real material. Here, we propose a mechanism to realize triferroic order coexistence and multiple types of valley polarization by structural phase transition in two-dimensional (2D) materials. The 1T and 2H phase OsBr2 monolayers exhibit non-magnetic semiconductor and ferromagnetic semiconductor with valley polarization up to 175.49 meV, respectively. Interestingly, the 1T phase OsBr2 bilayer shows the tri-state valley polarization due to lattice symmetry breaking, while the valley polarization of 2H phase bilayer originates from the combined effect of time-reversal symmetry breaking and spin-orbit coupling. Furthermore, the valley polarization and ferroelectric polarization of 1T phase AB stackings and 2H phase AA stackings can be manipulated via interlayer sliding. Importantly, we have verified that the 2H phase can be transformed to 1T phase by Li+ ion intercalation, while the 2H phase can occur the structural phase transition into the 1T phase by infrared laser induction. Our work provides a feasible strategy for manipulating valley polarization and a design idea for nano-devices with nonvolatile multiferroic properties.

Our model-agnostic approach leverages descriptors, high-dimensional feature vectors of atomic structure. The entropy of a high-dimensional density, the descriptor density of states, is accurately estimated with conditional score matching. Casting interatomic potentials into a form extensive in descriptor features, we show free energies emerge as the Legendre-Fenchel conjugate of the descriptor entropy, avoiding all high-dimensional integration. The score matching campaign requires less resources than fixed-model sampling and is highly parallel, reducing wall time to a few minutes, with tensor compression schemes allowing lightweight storage. Our model-agnostic estimator returns differentiable free energy predictions over a broad range of potential parameters in microseconds of CPU effort, allowing rapid forward and back propagation of potential variations through finite temperature simulations, long desired for uncertainty quantification and inverse design. We test predictions against thermodynamic integration calculations over a broad range of models for BCC, FCC and A15 phases of W, Mo and Fe at high homologous temperatures. Predictions pass the stringent accuracy threshold of 1-2 meV/atom (1/40-1/20 kcal/mol) for phase prediction with propagated score uncertainties robustly bounding errors. We also demonstrate targeted fine-tuning, reducing the alpha-gamma transition temperature in a non-magnetic machine learning model of Fe from 2030 K to 1063 K through back-propagation, with no additional sampling. Applications to liquids and fine-tuning foundational models are discussed along with the many problems in computational science which estimate high-dimensional integrals.

Title: Symmetry-driven Intrinsic Nonlinear Pure Spin Hall Effect
Authors: Sayan Sarkar, Sunit Das, Amit Agarwal
Abstract: The generation of pure spin current, spin angular momentum transport without charge flow, is crucial for developing energy-efficient spintronic devices with minimal Joule heating. Here, we introduce the intrinsic nonlinear pure spin Hall effect (NPSHE), where both linear and second-order charge Hall currents vanish. We show intrinsic second-order spin angular momentum transport in metals and insulators through a detailed analysis of the quantum geometric origin of different spin current contributions. Our comprehensive symmetry analysis identifies 39 magnetic point groups that support NPSHE, providing a foundation for material design and experimental realization. We predict significant nonlinear pure spin Hall currents in Kramers-Weyl metals even at room temperature, positioning them as potential candidates for NPSHE-based spin-torque devices. Our work lays a practical pathway for realizing charge-free angular momentum transport for the development of next-generation, energy-efficient spintronic devices.

Title: Phonon thermal Hall as a lattice Aharonov-Bohm effect
Authors: Kamran Behnia
Abstract: In a growing list of insulators, experiments find a misalignment between the heat flux and the thermal gradient vectors induced by magnetic field. This phenomenon, known as the phonon thermal Hall effect, implies energy flow without entropy production along the orientation perpendicular to the temperature gradient. Experiments find that the thermal Hall angle is maximal at the temperature at which the longitudinal thermal conductivity peaks. At this temperature, $T_{max}$, Normal phonon-phonon collisions (which do not produce entropy) dominate Umklapp and boundary scattering events (which do). In the presence of a magnetic field, Born-Oppenheimer approximated molecular wave functions are known to acquire a geometric [Berry] phase. I will argue here that the survival of this phase in a crystal implies a complex amplitude for transverse phonons. This modifies three-phonon interference patterns, twisting the quasi-momentum of the outgoing phonon. The rough amplitude of the thermal Hall angle expected in this picture is set by the wavelength, $\lambda_{max}$, and the crest displacement amplitude, $u_m$, of transverse acoustic phonons at $T_{max}$. Combined with the interatomic distance, $a$ and the magnetic length, $\ell_B$, it yields: $\Theta_H \approx \lambda_{max}^2u_m^2a^{-2}\ell_B^{-2}$. This is surprisingly close to what has been experimentally found in black phosphorus, germanium and silicon.

Title: Reaction-diffusion dynamics of the weakly dissipative Fermi gas
Authors: Hannah Lehr, Igor Lesanovsky, Gabriele Perfetto
Abstract: We study the one-dimensional Fermi gas subject to dissipative reactions. The dynamics is governed by the quantum master equation, where the Hamiltonian describes coherent motion of the particles, while dissipation accounts for irreversible reactions. For lattice one-dimensional fermionic systems, emergent critical behavior has been found in the dynamics in the reaction-limited regime of weak dissipation. Here, we address the question whether such features are present also in a gas in continuum space. We do this in the weakly dissipative regime by applying the time-dependent generalized Gibbs ensemble method. We show that for two body $2A\to \emptyset$ and three $3A\to \emptyset$ body annihilation, as well as for coagulation $A+A\to A$, the density features an asymptotic algebraic decay in time akin to the lattice problem. In all the cases, we find that upon increasing the temperature of the initial state the density decay accelerates, but the asymptotic algebraic decay exponents are not affected. We eventually consider the competition between branching $A\to A+A$ and the decay processes $A\to \emptyset$ and $2A\to \emptyset$. We find a second-order absorbing-state phase transition in the mean-field directed percolation universality class. This analysis shows that emergent behavior observed in lattice quantum reaction-diffusion systems is present also in continuum space, where it may be probed using ultra-cold atomic physics.

Title: Z-basis measurements using mixed parity and direct readout
Authors: Pieter Thijs Eendebak, Önder Gül
Abstract: Many architectures for quantum information processing rely on qubits dedicated for the readout of a larger quantum register. These ancilla readout qubits present a physical overhead not contributing to the computational resource. A common implementation in spin qubit architectures is the readout schemes based on Pauli exclusion of charges confined in a double quantum dot, with one dot serving as the ancilla qubit. Here, using a three-qubit spin register and a Pauli exclusion-based readout, we present z-basis measurements of the entire register constructed with tomography, eliminating the physical overhead. We validate our approach with simulations which provide insight into potential sources of errors in the reconstruction. We also demonstrate our reconstruction by performing quantum state tomography on a GHZ state of a spin-qubit based device.

Title: Reversible magneto ionics in crystallized W Co20Fe60B20 MgO HfO2 ultra-thin films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy
Authors: Song Chen, Elmer Monteblanco, Benjamin Borie, Rohit Pachat, Shimpei Ono, Liza Herrera Diez, Dafiné Ravelosona
Abstract: We have investigated electric field (E-field) induced modulation of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) in both amorphous and crystalline W/CoFeB/MgO/HfO2 ultra-thin films. We find that in the amorphous state, the E-field effect is volatile and reversible, which is consistent with the conventional electrostatic effect through charge accumulation and depletion. In the crystallized system annealed at 370°C, we find that two effects are at play, a non-volatile and reversible voltage-induced effect on PMA and an electrostatic response. We discuss these results in terms of higher oxygen mobility at the crystallized CoFeB-MgO interface, which induces a non-volatile magneto-ionic response. Modulating PMA in crystallized CoFeB-MgO materials through ionic migration opens the path to integrating magneto-ionics in full magnetic tunnel junctions.

Title: Electrically Tunable Magnonic Bound States in the Continuum
Authors: Xi-guang Wang, Guang-hua Guo, Jamal Berakdar, Hui Jing
Abstract: Low energy excitations of a magnetically ordered system are spin waves with magnon being their excitation quanta. Magnons are demonstrated to be useful for data processing and communication. To achieve magnon transport across extended distances, it is essential to minimize magnonic dissipation which can be accomplished by material engineering to reduce intrinsic damping or by spin torques that can counteract damping. This study introduces an alternative methodology to effectively reduce magnon dissipation based on magnonic bound states in the continuum (BIC). We demonstrate the approach for two antiferromagnetically coupled magnonic waveguides, with one waveguide being attached to a current carrying metallic layer. The current acts on the attached waveguide with a spin-orbit torque effectively amplifying the magnonic signal. The setup maps on a non-Hermitian system with coupled loss and more loss, enabling the formation of dissipationless magnon BIC. We investigate the necessary criteria for the formation of magnon BIC through electric currents. The influences of interlayer coupling constant, anisotropy constants and applied magnetic field on the current-induced magnon BIC are analyzed. The identified effect can be integrated in the design of magnon delay lines, offering opportunities for the enhancement of magnonic devices and circuits.

Title: Halbach 2.0 -- Creating homogeneous fields with finite size magnets
Authors: Ingo Rehberg, Peter Blümler
Abstract: Homogeneous magnetic fields can be generated through the strategic arrangement of permanent magnets. The Halbach array serves as a prominent example of an effective design following this principle. However, it is a two-dimensional approach because it is optimal when placing infinitely long magnets -- line dipoles -- on a circle. If shorter, more realistic magnets are to be used, the optimal arrangement of magnetic moments diverges from the classical Halbach geometry. This paper presents optimal solutions for three-dimensional arrangements calculated for point dipoles, including optimized orientations for single rings and stacks of two rings. They are superior to the original Halbach arrangement and a modification described in the literature, both in terms of the strength and the homogeneity of the magnetic field. Analytic formulae are provided for both cases and tested by experimental realizations.

Abstract: Following electronic processes in molecules and materials at the level of the quantum mechanical electron wavefunction with angstrom-level spatial resolution and with full access to its femtosecond temporal dynamics is at the heart of ultrafast condensed matter physics. A breakthrough invention allowing experimental access to electron wavefunctions was the reconstruction of molecular orbitals from angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy data in 2009, termed photoemission orbital tomography (POT). This invention puts ultrafast three-dimensional (3D) POT in reach, with many new prospects for the study of ultrafast light-matter interaction, femtochemistry and photo-induced phase transitions. Here, we develop a synergistic experimental-algorithmic approach to realize the first 3D-POT experiment using a short-pulse extreme ultraviolet light source. We combine a new variant of photoelectron spectroscopy, namely ultrafast momentum microscopy, with a table-top spectrally-tunable high-harmonic generation light source and a tailored algorithm for efficient 3D reconstruction from sparse, undersampled data. This combination dramatically speeds up the experimental data acquisition, while at the same time reducing the sampling requirements to achieve complete 3D information. We demonstrate the power of this approach by full 3D imaging of the frontier orbitals of a prototypical organic semiconductor absorbed on pristine Ag(110).

Title: The Maximum $T_c$ of Conventional Superconductors at Ambient Pressure
Authors: Kun Gao, Tiago F. T. Cerqueira, Antonio Sanna, Yue-Wen Fang, Đorđe Dangić, Ion Errea, Hai-Chen Wang, Silvana Botti, Miguel A. L. Marques
Abstract: The theoretical maximum critical temperature ($T_c$) for conventional superconductors at ambient pressure remains a fundamental question in condensed matter physics. Through analysis of electron-phonon calculations for over 20,000 metals, we critically examine this question. We find that while hydride metals can exhibit maximum phonon frequencies of more than 5000 K, the crucial logarithmic average frequency $\omega_\text{log}$ rarely exceeds 1800 K. Our data reveals an inherent trade-off between $\omega_\text{log}$ and the electron-phonon coupling constant $\lambda$, suggesting that the optimal Eliashberg function that maximizes $T_c$ is unphysical. Based on our calculations, we identify Li$_2$AgH$_6$ and its sibling Li$_2$AuH$_6$ as theoretical materials that likely approach the practical limit for conventional superconductivity at ambient pressure. Analysis of thermodynamic stability indicates that compounds with higher predicted $T_c$ values are increasingly unstable, making their synthesis challenging. While fundamental physical laws do not strictly limit $T_c$ to low-temperatures, our analysis suggests that achieving room-temperature conventional superconductivity at ambient pressure is extremely unlikely.

Title: Imaging thick objects with deep-sub-angstrom resolution and deep-sub-picometer precision
Authors: Wenfeng Yang, Haozhi Sha, Jizhe Cui, Rong Yu
Abstract: Size effects are ubiquitous in the structural, mechanical, and physical properties of materials, making it highly desirable to study the intrinsic properties of thick objects through high-resolution structural analysis in transmission electron microscopy. Although deep-sub-angstrom resolution has been achieved with multislice electron ptychography, the sample thickness is typically very limited. By combining energy filtering and extended local-orbital ptychography (eLOP) that retrieves varying aberrations during electron scanning, here we report ptychographic reconstructions for silicon as thick as 85 nm, approximately three times larger than usual thickness threshold for conventional multislice electron ptychography. The elimination of aberration variations contributes to accurate reconstructions with an information limit of 18 pm and atomic position precision of 0.39 pm. Accurate ptychographic reconstructions for thick objects can facilitate the discovery or interpretation of intrinsic structural and physical phenomena in solids, which is of great significance in physics, chemistry, materials science, and semiconductor device engineering.

Title: Density functional theory of resonant inelastic x-ray scattering in the quasi-one-dimensional dimer iridate Ba3InIr2O9
Authors: D.A. Kukusta, L.V. Bekenov, V.N. Antonov
Abstract: We have investigated the electronic structure of Ba3InIr2O9 within the density-functional theory (DFT) using the generalized gradient approximation while considering strong Coulomb correlations (GGA+$U$) in the framework of the fully relativistic spin-polarized Dirac linear muffin-tin orbital band-structure method. We have investigated resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) spectra at the Ir L3 K edge. The calculated results are in good agreement with experimental data. The RIXS spectrum of Ba3InIr2O9 at the Ir L3 edge possesses several sharp features below 2 eV corresponding to transitions within the Ir tg levels. The excitation located from 2 to 5 eV is due to tg -> eg transitions. The third wide structure situated at 5-12 eV appears due to charge transfer transitions. We have also presented comprehensive theoretical calculations of the RIXS spectrum at the oxygen K edge.

Title: A novel spectroscopic probe of ultrafast magnetization dynamics in the extreme ultraviolet spectral range
Authors: Johanna Richter, Somnath Jana, Robert Behrends, Carl S. Davies, Martin Hennecke, Daniel Schick, Clemens von Korff Schmising, Stefan Eisebitt
Abstract: The development of spectroscopic techniques in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) spectral range has significantly advanced the understanding of ultrafast interactions in magnetic systems triggered by optical excitation. In this work, we introduce a previously missing geometry that facilitates the observation of the ultrafast magnetization dynamics of magnetic systems with an out-of-plane magnetization grown on XUV opaque substrates. This novel approach to probe ultrafast magnetization dynamics combines the magneto-optical Kerr effect with the strong dependence of a sample's reflectance near its Brewster angle. It therefore works with linearly polarized light and does not require any additional polarizing optics. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the technique by presenting both simulations and experimental data as a function of the energy and the polarization of the XUV probe radiation as well as of the delay time after optical excitation.

Title: In situ growth and magnetic characterization of Cr Chloride monolayers
Authors: Giuseppe Buccoliero, Pamella Vasconcelos Borges Pinho, Marli Dos Reis Cantarino, Francesco Rosa, Nicholas B. Brookes, Roberto Sant
Abstract: Monolayer Chromium Dihalides and Trihalides materials can be grown on a variety of substrates by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) regardless of the lattice mismatch, thanks to the van der Waals epitaxy. In this work, we studied the magnetic nature of Cr Chloride monolayers grown on Au(111), Ni(111) and graphene passivated-Ni(111) from the evaporation in ultra-high vacuum of the same halide precursor. Structural, morphological and chemical characterization were conducted in situ by low energy electron diffraction, scanning tunneling microscopy and Xray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD). Owing to opposite chemical behaviour, Au(111) and Ni(111) promote the formation of two different valence compounds, i.e. CrCl$_3$ and CrCl$_2$, showing distinct magnetic properties at 4 K. When graphene is used to passivate the Ni(111) surface, the formation of CrCl$_3$ becomes allowed on this substrate. The coexistence of CrCl$_3$ and CrCl$_2$, both showing few nm lateral size and super-paramagnetic features, is demonstrated by XMCD spectra displaying two dichroic peaks at the characteristic Cr$^{3+}$ and Cr$^{2+}$ energies. Site selective magnetization measurements performed with the photon energy tuned on the two absorption edges show reversed magnetization of some of the CrCl$_2$ islands with respect to the CrCl$_3$ domains, which is interpreted in terms of magnetic frustration.

Title: Lattice Parameters and Bulk Modulus of SrTi$_{1-\mathit{x}}$Mn$_{\mathit{x}}$O$_{3}$ Perovskites: A Comparison of Exchange-Correlation Functionals with Experimental Validation
Authors: Miroslav Lebeda, Jan Drahokoupil, Stanislav Kamba, Šimon Svoboda, Vojtěch Smola, Bogdan Dabrowski, Petr Vlčák
Abstract: We assessed four exchange-correlation functionals (LDA CA-PZ, GGA parametrized by PBE, PBEsol, and WC) in predicting the lattice parameters of SrTi$_{1-\mathit{x}}$Mn$_{\mathit{x}}$O$_{3}$ perovskites, assuming cubic structures. Predictions were verified using X-ray diffraction (XRD) for Mn content of $\mathit{x}$ = 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 1.0, confirming cubic symmetry and a linear decrease in lattice parameters with increasing Mn. PBEsol and WC demonstrated the highest precision (deviations < 0.20%). Additionally, bulk moduli were calculated using the same functionals and verified with the experimental bulk modulus of SrTiO$_{3}$ (183 $\pm$ 2 GPa, Pulse-Echo method). The predicted bulk moduli exhibited a slow, linear increase with increasing Mn. The best correspondence with the experimental bulk modulus was achieved by PBEsol and WC (deviations < 0.7%). These findings highlight the reliability of PBEsol and WC functionals for accurately modeling structural properties of SrTi$_{1-\mathit{x}}$Mn$_{\mathit{x}}$O$_{3}$ perovskites, having better precision than commonly employed LDA and PBE functionals.

Title: Nanoscale characterization of atomic positions in orthorhombic perovskite thin films

Abstract: The crystal structure determines many of the physical properties of oxide perovskites (ABO$_3$) and only a tiny modification of the lattice structure causes major changes in the functional properties through the interplay among spin, orbital and charge orders. The determination of characteristic distortions and symmetries is a valuable asset for understanding the structure-properties relationship and guiding the design of epitaxial oxide heterostructures, where electron degrees of freedom and correlated electronic states can be tailored. Even until new phases, otherwise absent in bulk materials, may appear. Here, we report on the in-depth structural characterization of 50~nm-LaVO$_3$ thin film grown onto (110)-oriented DyScO$_3$ by molecular beam epitaxy. We have investigated the heterostructure by means of x-ray diffraction, high-resolution and scanning transmission electron microscopies, scanning precession electron diffraction tomography and first-principle calculations. LaVO$_3$ crystallizes in the orthorhombic $Pbnm$ space group and is constrained by the substrate, which imposes a growth along the $[110]$ orthorhombic direction, over the 140 deposited unit cells. The mapping of the reciprocal space allows determining the orientation of the film and refining the lattice parameters. Using scanning transmission electron microscopy, we analyzed the structure of LaVO$_3$, focusing on the determination of the antipolar displacement of the rare earth. Additionally, 3D electron diffraction enabled to resolve the atomic positions of all species within the film.

Title: Interplay of superconducting, metallic, and crystalline states of composite fermions at $ν{=}1/6$ in wide quantum wells
Authors: Ajit C. Balram, Anirban Sharma, J. K. Jain
Abstract: Evidence for developing fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) at filling fraction $\nu{=}1/6$ and $1/8$ has recently been reported in wide GaAs quantum wells [Wang \emph{et al.}, PRL {\bf 134}, 046502 (2025)]. In this article, we theoretically investigate the nature of the state at $\nu{=}1/6$ as a function of the quantum well width and the density by considering composite-fermion (CF) crystals, CF Fermi sea, and various kinds of paired CF states. The $f$-wave paired state has the lowest energy among the paired CF states. However, for parameters of interest, the energies of the CF crystal, the CF Fermi liquid, and the $f$-wave paired CF state are too close to call. We, therefore, predict that {\it if} the FQHE at $\nu{=}1/6$ is experimentally confirmed, this state would be an $f$-wave paired state of CFs, which can be verified by measurement of its thermal Hall conductance. Exact diagonalization studies for systems with up to 8 electrons show that the ground states at $\nu{=}n/(6n{\pm} 1)$ are incompressible for all widths and densities we have considered and well described by the corresponding Laughlin and Jain states. We propose a phase diagram for large quantum well widths and densities in which at zero disorder, incompressible FQHE states are stabilized at $\nu{=}n/(6n{\pm} 1)$ and $\nu{=}1/6$, but in between these fillings the CF crystal is stabilized. With disorder, which creates a spatial variation in the filling factor, two regimes are identified: (i) for small disorder, when the incompressible states percolate at the special fillings, FQHE with quantized Hall plateaus and vanishing longitudinal resistance should occur; and (ii) for larger disorder, when the CF crystal percolates, the longitudinal resistance rises with decreasing temperature but the domains of FQHE liquid produce minima at the special filling factors. The experiments are consistent with the latter scenario.

Title: Mastering the growth of antimonene on Bi2Se3: strategies and insights

Abstract: Antimonene, the two-dimensional phase of antimony, appears in two distinct allotropes when epitaxially grown on Bi2Se3: the puckered asymmetric washboard ({\alpha}) and buckled honeycomb ({\beta}) bilayer structures. As-deposited antimony films exhibit varying proportions of single {\alpha} and {\beta} structures. We identify the conditions necessary for ordered, pure-phase growth of single to triple {\beta}-antimonene bilayers. Additionally, we determine their electronic structure, work function, and characteristic core-level binding energies, offering an explanation for the relatively large chemical shifts observed among the different phases. This study not only establishes a protocol for achieving a single {\beta} phase of antimonene but also provides key signatures for distinguishing between the different allotropes using standard spectroscopic and microscopic techniques.

Title: Controllable Interlocking from Irregularity in Two-Phase Composites
Authors: Chelsea Fox, Kyrillos Bastawros, Tommaso Magrini, Chiara Daraio
Abstract: Natural materials often feature a combination of soft and stiff phases, arranged to achieve excellent mechanical properties, such as high strength and toughness. Many natural materials have even independently evolved to have similar structures to obtain these properties. For example, interlocking structures are observed in many strong and tough natural materials, across a wide range of length scales. Inspired by these materials, we present a class of two-phase composites with controllable interlocking. The composites feature tessellations of stiff particles connected by a soft matrix and we control the degree of interlocking through irregularity of particle size, geometry and arrangement. We generate the composites through stochastic network growth, using an algorithm which connects a hexagonal grid of nodes according to a coordination number, defined as the average number of connections per node. The generated network forms the soft matrix phase of the composites, while the areas enclosed by the network form the stiff reinforcing particles. At low coordination, composites feature highly polydisperse particles with irregular geometries, which are arranged non-periodically. In response to loading, these particles interlock with each other and primarily rotate and deform to accommodate non-uniform kinematic constraints from adjacent particles. In contrast, higher coordination composites feature more monodisperse particles with uniform geometries, which collectively slide. We then show how to control the degree of interlocking as a function of coordination number alone, demonstrating how irregularity facilitates controllability.

Title: From Champagne to Confined Polymer:Natural and Artifical Bubble Nucleation
Authors: Carlos Arauz-Moreno, Keyvan Piroird, Elise Lorenceau
Abstract: In this study, we present a novel experimental work on bubble nucleation and growth using a model system comprised by viscoelastic polyvinyl butyral (PVB) confined in a Hele-Shaw cell geometry that is decompressed at elevated temperatures. The driver is connected to the temperature-induced shift in chemical equilibrium experienced simultaneously by two gases present in the bulk. The latter becomes at the same time oversaturated with water vapor and slightly undersaturated in air. Our bubbles grow with various shapes and sizes depending on the initial morphology of the nucleus or the presence of neighboring bubbles. The likelihood of nucleation is related to the amount of water dissolved in the bulk and the imposed temperature. Counter-intuitively, the number of nuclei whence a bubble can grow is inversely correlated with said temperature. In an analogy with Champagne, we show that nucleation can either be natural, at trapped fibers or dust particles, or artificial, at crenels we purposefully made in the glass surface. Our results indicate that the growth rate of bubbles can be impacted by the nucleation mechanism.

Title: Single file dynamics of tethered random walkers
Authors: S.B. Yuste, A. Baumgaertner, E. Abad
Abstract: We consider the single-file dynamics of $N$ identical random walkers moving with diffusivity $D$ in one dimension (walkers bounce off each other when attempting to overtake). Additionally, we require that the separation between neighboring walkers cannot exceed a threshold value $\Delta$ and therefore call them ``tethered walkers'' (they behave as if bounded by strings which tighten fully when reaching the maximum length $\Delta$). For finite $\Delta$, we study the diffusional relaxation to the equilibrium state and characterize the latter [the long-time relaxation is exponential with a characteristic time that scales as $(N\Delta)^2/D$]. In particular, our approximate approach for the $N$-particle probability distribution yields the one-particle distribution function of the central and edge particles [the first two positional moments are given as power expansions in $\Delta/\sqrt{4Dt}$]. For $N=2$, we find an exact solution (both in the continuum case and on-lattice) and use it to test our approximations for one-particle distributions, positional moments, and correlations. For finite $\Delta$ and arbitrary $N$, edge particles move with an effective long-time diffusivity $D/N$, in sharp contrast with the $1/\ln(N)$-behavior observed when $\Delta=\infty$. Finally, we compute the probability distribution of the equilibrium system length and the associated entropy. We find that the force required to change this length by a given amount is linear in this quantity, the (entropic) spring constant being $6k_BT/(N\Delta^2)$. In this respect, the system behaves like an ideal polymer. Our main analytical results are confirmed by Monte Carlo simulations.

Title: Broadband surface phonon spectroscopy by time-domain extreme ultraviolet diffuse scattering

Abstract: We present experimental evidence that the dynamics of surface acoustic waves, with wavelengths ranging from tens to hundreds of nanometers, are encoded in the time-dependent diffuse scattering of extreme ultraviolet light. By measuring the diffuse scattering from a surface after an ultrafast optical excitation, we determined the dispersion relation of surface acoustic wave-packets across a broad range of wavevectors in various samples. The comparison of the signal amplitudes from samples with different surface morphologies suggests that the underlying excitation mechanism is related to the natural roughness of the samples surface. This simple and contactless approach represents a complementary experimental tool to transient grating or Brillouin spectroscopy, providing valuable insights into nanoscale surface dynamics.

Title: Boundary Perturbation Effects in Quantum Systems with Conserved Energy and Continuous Symmetry
Authors: Qucheng Gao, Xiao Chen
Abstract: We investigate one-dimensional systems with both energy conservation and a continuous symmetry, focusing on the impact of a boundary perturbation that breaks the continuous symmetry. Our study examines the quantum dynamics resulting from this boundary perturbation and identifies two distinct phases: one in which the corresponding charge exhibits extensive fluctuations, and another where the charge remains conserved. These phenomena are observed in both free and interacting models. The emergence of the charge-frozen phase is attributed to energy conservation, and we demonstrate that this phase disappears when energy conservation is broken or replaced by other symmetries. We provide an explanation using the effective Hamiltonian derived from degenerate perturbation theory.

Title: A generalized dual potential for inelastic Constitutive Artificial Neural Networks: A JAX implementation at finite strains
Authors: Hagen Holthusen, Kevin Linka, Ellen Kuhl, Tim Brepols
Abstract: We present a methodology for designing a generalized dual potential, or pseudo potential, for inelastic Constitutive Artificial Neural Networks (iCANNs). This potential, expressed in terms of stress invariants, inherently satisfies thermodynamic consistency for large deformations. In comparison to our previous work, the new potential captures a broader spectrum of material behaviors, including pressure-sensitive inelasticity. To this end, we revisit the underlying thermodynamic framework of iCANNs for finite strain inelasticity and derive conditions for constructing a convex, zero-valued, and non-negative dual potential. To embed these principles in a neural network, we detail the architecture's design, ensuring a priori compliance with thermodynamics. To evaluate the proposed architecture, we study its performance and limitations discovering visco-elastic material behavior, though the method is not limited to visco-elasticity. In this context, we investigate different aspects in the strategy of discovering inelastic materials. Our results indicate that the novel architecture robustly discovers interpretable models and parameters, while autonomously revealing the degree of inelasticity. The iCANN framework, implemented in JAX, is publicly accessible at this https URL.

Title: A Machine Learning Approach for Design of Frequency Selective Surface based Radar Absorbing Material via Image Prediction
Authors: Vijay Kumar Sutrakar, Anjana P K, Sajal Kesharwani, Siddharth Bisariya
Abstract: The paper presents an innovative methodology for designing frequency selective surface (FSS) based radar absorbing materials using machine learning (ML) technique. In conventional electromagnetic design, unit cell dimensions of FSS are used as input and absorption coefficient is then predicted for a given design. In this paper, absorption coefficient is considered as input to ML model and image of FSS unit cell is predicted. Later, this image is used for generating the FSS unit cell parameters. Eleven different ML models are studied over a wide frequency band of 1GHz to 30GHz. Out of which six ML models (i.e. (a) Random Forest classification, (b) K- Neighbors Classification, (c) Grid search regression, (d) Random Forest regression, (e) Decision tree classification, and (f) Decision tree regression) show training accuracy more than 90%. The absorption coefficients with varying frequencies of these predicted images are subsequently evaluated using commercial electromagnetic solver. The performance of these ML models is encouraging, and it can be used for accelerating design and optimization of high performance FSS based radar absorbing material for advanced electromagnetic applications in future.

Abstract: We study the relation between spectral data of magnetic monopoles in hyperbolic space and the curve of the spectral parameter of generalized chiral Potts models (gCPM) through the lens of (semi-)holomorphic field theories. We realize the identification of the data on the two sides, which we call the hyperbolic monopole/gCPM correspondence. For the group $\text{SU}(2)$, this correspondence had been observed by Atiyah and Murray in the 80s. Here, we revisit and generalize this correspondence and establish its origin. By invoking the work of Murray and Singer on hyperbolic monopoles, we first generalize the observation of Atiyah and Murray to the group $\text{SU}(n)$. We then propose a technology to engineer gCPM within the 4d Chern-Simons (CS) theory, which explains various features of the model, including the lack of rapidity-difference property of its R-matrix and its peculiarity of having a genus$\,\ge 2$ curve of the spectral parameter. Finally, we investigate the origin of the correspondence. We first clarify how the two sides of the correspondence can be realized from the 6d holomorphic CS theory on $\mathbb{P}S(M)$, the projective spinor bundle of the Minkowski space $M=\mathbb{R}^{1,3}$, for hyperbolic $\text{SU}(n)$-monopoles, and the Euclidean space $M=\mathbb{R}^4$, for the gCPM. We then establish that $\mathbb{P}S(M)$ can be holomorphically embedded into $\mathbb{P}S(\mathbb{C}^{1,3})$, the projective spinor bundle of $\mathbb{C}^{1,3}$, of complex dimension five with a fixed complex structure. We finally explain how the 6d CS theory on $\mathbb{P}S(M)$ can be realized as the dimensional reduction of the 10d holomorphic CS theory on $\mathbb{P}S(\mathbb{C}^{1,3})$. As the latter theory is only sensitive to the complex structure of $\mathbb{P}S(\mathbb{C}^{1,3})$, which has been fixed, we realize the correspondence as two incarnations of the same physics in ten dimensions.

Title: Maximal Magic for Two-qubit States
Authors: Qiaofeng Liu, Ian Low, Zhewei Yin
Abstract: Magic is a quantum resource essential for universal quantum computation and represents the deviation of quantum states from those that can be simulated efficiently using classical algorithms. Using the Stabilizer Rényi Entropy (SRE), we investigate two-qubit states with maximal magic, which are most distinct from classical simulability, and provide strong numerical evidence that the maximal second order SRE is $\log (16/7)\approx 0.827$, establishing a tighter bound than the prior $\log(5/2)\approx 0.916$. We identity 480 states saturating the new bound, which turn out to be the fiducial states for the mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) generated by the orbits of the Weyl-Heisenberg (WH) group, and conjecture that WH-MUBs are the maximal magic states for $n$-qubit, when $n\neq 1$ and 3. We also reveal a striking interplay between magic and entanglement: the entanglement of maximal magic states is restricted to two possible values, $1/2$ and $1/\sqrt{2}$, as quantified by the concurrence; none is maximally entangled.

Title: Emergent Hydrodynamic Mode on SU(2) Plaquette Chains and Quantum Simulation
Authors: Francesco Turro, Xiaojun Yao
Abstract: We search for emergent hydrodynamic modes in real-time Hamiltonian dynamics of $2+1$-dimensional SU(2) lattice gauge theory on a quasi one dimensional plaquette chain, by numerically computing symmetric correlation functions of energy densities on lattice sizes of about $20$ with the local Hilbert space truncated at $j_{\rm max}=\frac{1}{2}$. Due to the Umklapp processes, we only find a mode for energy diffusion. The symmetric correlator exhibits transport peak near zero frequency with a width proportional to momentum squared at small momentum, when the system is fully quantum ergodic, as indicated by the eigenenergy level statistics. This transport peak leads to a power-law $t^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ decay of the symmetric correlator at late time, also known as the long-time tail, as well as diffusion-like spreading in position space. We also introduce a quantum algorithm for computing the symmetric correlator on a quantum computer and find it gives results consistent with exact diagonalization when tested on the IBM emulator. Finally we discuss the future prospect of searching for the sound modes.

Title: The Moving Born-Oppenheimer Approximation
Authors: Bernardo Barrera, Daniel P. Arovas, Anushya Chandran, Anatoli Polkovnikov
Abstract: We develop a mixed quantum-classical framework, dubbed the Moving Born-Oppenheimer Approximation (MBOA), to describe the dynamics of slow degrees of freedom (DOFs) coupled to fast ones. As in the Born-Oppenheimer Approximation (BOA), the fast degrees of freedom adiabatically follow a state that depends on the slow ones. Unlike the BOA, this state depends on both the positions and the momenta of the slow DOFs. We study several model systems: a spin-1/2 particle and a spinful molecule moving in a spatially inhomogeneous magnetic field, and a gas of fast particles coupled to a piston. The MBOA reveals rich dynamics for the slow degree of freedom, including reflection, dynamical trapping, and mass renormalization. It also significantly modifies the state of the fast DOFs. For example, the spins in the molecule are entangled and squeezed, while the gas of fast particles develops gradients that are synchronized with the motion of the piston for a long time. The MBOA can be used to describe both classical and quantum systems and has potential applications in molecular dynamics, state preparation, and quantum sensing.

Title: Detecting emergent 1-form symmetries with quantum error correction
Authors: Yu-Jie Liu, Wen-Tao Xu, Frank Pollmann, Michael Knap
Abstract: Higher-from symmetries act on sub-dimensional spatial manifolds of a quantum system and they can emerge as an exact symmetry at low energies even when they are explicitly broken at the microscopic level, making them difficult to characterize. In this work, we propose a quantitative criterion for the existence of 1-form symmetries motivated by quantum error correction (QEC). We show that the loss of the emergent 1-form symmetry is an information-theoretic transition revealed from the ensemble of post-measurement states. We analytically determine the regimes in which a 1-form symmetry emerges in product states on one- and two-dimensional lattices. The latter can be solved by mapping the ensemble of post-measurement states to the partition sum of a random bond Ising model along the Nishimori line. In analytically intractable regimes, we demonstrate how to detect 1-form symmetries with a global Minimal-Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) decoder and numerically examine the information-theoretic transition of the 1-form symmetry, including systems with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order. As an application of our protocol, we show that once the 1-form symmetry is detected to exist, a topological quantum phase transitions characterized by the spontaneous breaking of the 1-form symmetry can be accurately detected by a disorder parameter. By exploiting ideas from quantum error correction, our work develops an information-theoretic criterion for emergent 1-from symmetries, which furthers our understanding of exotic symmetries and offers practical routes toward their characterization.

Title: Onset of Quantum Chaos and Ergoditicy in Spin Systems with Highly Degenerate Hilbert Spaces
Authors: Mahmoud Abdelshafy, Rubem Mondaini, Marcos Rigol
Abstract: We show that in systems with highly degenerate energy spectra, such as the 2D transverse-field Ising model (2DTFIM) in the strong-field limit, quantum chaos can emerge in finite systems for arbitrary small perturbations. In this regime, the presence of extensive quasi-conserved quantities can prevent finite systems from becoming ergodic. We study the ensuing transition to ergodicity in a family of models that includes the 2DTFIM, in which the onset of ergodic behavior exhibits universality and occurs for perturbation strengths that decrease polynomially with increasing system size. We discuss the behaviors of quantum chaos indicators, such as level spacing statistics and bipartite entanglement, and of the fidelity susceptibilities and spectral functions across the transitions.

Title: Hybridization of Non-Hermitian Topological Interface Modes
Authors: Yuhao Wang, Hai-Chau Nguyen, Zhiyi Yuan, T. Thu Ha Do, Vytautas Valuckas, Hai Son Nguyen, Cuong Dang, Son Tung Ha
Abstract: We propose and experimentally demonstrate the hybridization of radiating topological interface states, analogous to Jackiw-Rebbi states but in gain media with radiation fields. This hybridization not only modifies energy levels under a strong coupling scheme but also significantly reshapes far-field radiation characteristics. The bonding mode exhibits sub-radiant, omnidirectional emission, while the antibonding mode becomes super-radiant and highly unidirectional. Crucially, this non-Hermitian hybridization is tunable, allowing simultaneous control of energy splitting, quality factor, and far-field radiation by varying the distance between the two topological interfaces. Our findings establish hybridized radiating topological interface states as a robust platform for engineering two-level systems with tailored far-field responses, offering new possibilities for applications in beam shaping, nonlinear optics, quantum technologies, and beyond.

Title: High-Q, size-independent, and reconfigurable optical antennas via zero-index material dispersion engineering
Authors: Prasad P. Iyer, Mihir Pendharkar, Anchal Agrawal, Humberto Foronda, Mike Iza, Umesh K. Mishra, Shuji Nakamura, Steven DenBaars, Stacia Keller, Chris Palmstrøm, Jon A. Schuller
Abstract: Enhancing light-matter interactions at the nanoscale is foundational to nanophotonics, with epsilon near zero (ENZ) materials demonstrating significant this http URL-quality (Q) factor resonances maximizing these interactions are typically realized in photonic crystals requiring sub-50 nm precision nanofabrication over large areas, limiting scalability and increasing complexity. Mie resonances offer an alternative but are constrained by low Q factors due to the scarcity of high refractive index materials, necessitating large refractive index changes for effective resonance switching and limiting dynamic reconfigurability. We overcome these limitations by embedding Mie resonators within ENZ media, thereby enhancing Q- factors, mitigating geometric dispersion and fabrication challenges, and maximizing optical reconfigurability. We introduce three resonator-ENZ configurations - voids in AlN, Ge in $SiO_2$, and intrinsic InSb in doped InSb - spanning from low-loss phononic to lossy plasmonic ENZ this http URL novel epitaxial regrowth techniques, we achieve significant Q-factor improvements over non-embedded resonators. Notably, an air-based Mie resonator embedded in AlN supports resonant Q-factors exceeding 100, with negligible geometric dispersion across sizes from 800 nm to 2,800 nm. Additionally, we demonstrate dynamic reconfigurability of intrinsic InSb resonators by thermally tuning the ENZ wavelength over a 2$\mu$m range in the mid-infrared (11-16 $\mu$m) wavelength regime. These results showcase the potential of Mie resonators embedded in ENZ media for high-fidelity sensors, thermal emitters, and reconfigurable metasurfaces, bridging theoretical predictions with practical applications, advancing the development of dynamic, high-Q optical devices.

Title: Resonant Energy Transfer and Collectively Driven Emitters in Waveguide QED
Authors: Cornelis Jacobus van Diepen, Vasiliki Angelopoulou, Oliver August Dall'Alba Sandberg, Alexey Tiranov, Ying Wang, Sven Scholz, Arne Ludwig, Anders Søndberg Sørensen, Peter Lodahl
Abstract: Waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED) has opened a new frontier in quantum optics, which enables the radiative coupling of distantly located emitters via the spatially extended waveguide mode. This coupling leads to modified emission dynamics and previous work has reported the observation of increased intensity correlations (an antidip) when probing the resonance response of multiple emitters. However, the interference between independent emitters has been shown to lead to a similar response. Here, we directly observe resonant energy transfer between two distant quantum emitters by recording an antidip in the intensity correlations, $g^{(2)}(\tau)$, while driving only one of the emitters. Under the condition that only a single emitter is driven, the antidip in photon coincidences is a distinctive signature of emitter-emitter coupling, which enables the transfer of energy from the driven to the undriven emitter. Interestingly, the observed mechanism is a long-range and waveguide-engineered resonant version of resonant Förster transfer, which is responsible for the transport of energy between chlorophylls in the photosynthesis. Building on the established coupling, we demonstrate collective driving of the coupled emitter pair. Specifically, we control the relative driving phase and amplitude of the emitters and apply this collective excitation scheme to selectively populate the long-lived subradiant state. This results in suppressed emission, i.e. the peculiar situation where driving two emitters as opposed to one effectively reduces the probability of photon emission. Our work presents novel emission regimes and excitation schemes for a multi-emitter waveguide QED system. These can be exploited to deterministically generate emitter-emitter entanglement and advanced photonic states providing robustness against losses for photonic quantum computation and quantum communication.

Title: Effective Field Neural Network
Authors: Xi Liu, Yujun Zhao, Chun Yu Wan, Yang Zhang, Junwei Liu
Abstract: In recent years, with the rapid development of machine learning, physicists have been exploring its new applications in solving or alleviating the curse of dimensionality in many-body problems. In order to accurately reflect the underlying physics of the problem, domain knowledge must be encoded into the machine learning algorithms. In this work, inspired by field theory, we propose a new set of machine learning models called effective field neural networks (EFNNs) that can automatically and efficiently capture important many-body interactions through multiple self-refining processes. Taking the classical $3$-spin infinite-range model and the quantum double exchange model as case studies, we explicitly demonstrate that EFNNs significantly outperform fully-connected deep neural networks (DNNs) and the effective model. Furthermore, with the help of convolution operations, the EFNNs learned in a small system can be seamlessly used in a larger system without additional training and the relative errors even decrease, which further demonstrates the efficacy of EFNNs in representing core physical behaviors.

Title: Wind-driven collisions between floes explain the observed dispersion of Arctic sea ice
Authors: Bryan Shaddy, P. Alex Greaney, Bhargav Rallabandi
Abstract: The transport of sea ice over the polar oceans plays an important role in climate. This transport is driven predominantly by turbulent winds, leading to stochastic motion of ice floes. Observed diffusivities and velocity distributions of sea ice deviate by orders of magnitude from Brownian models, making it challenging to predict ice transport. We fully resolve these gaps through stochastic granular simulations that account for interactions between ice floes as they respond to a noisy wind. Using only directly measured quantities as model inputs, we reproduce the dispersion, diffusivity, velocity distribution, and power spectra of sea ice observed in the Fram Strait with remarkable quantitative accuracy. We understand these features as direct consequences of collisions between floes, which rapidly dissipate the energy injected by wind. A kinetic theory provides insights into these dynamics in terms of environmental properties, and makes predictions in close agreement with observations. The ideas and tools developed here pave the way for a new predictive understanding of global sea ice transport in terms of local floe-scale processes.

Title: Spectral Efficiency Expression for the Non-Linear Schrödinger Channel in the Low Noise Limit Using Scattering Data
Authors: Pavlos Kazakopoulos, Aris L. Moustakas
Abstract: Transmission through optical fibers offers ultra-fast and long-haul communications. However, the search for its ultimate capacity limits in the presence of distributed amplifier noise is complicated by the competition between wave dispersion and non-linearity. In this paper, we exploit the integrability of the Nonlinear Schrödinger Equation, which accurately models optical fiber communications, to derive an expression for the spectral efficiency of an optical fiber communications channel, expressed fully in the scattering data domain of the Non-linear Fourier Transform and valid in the limit of low amplifier noise. We utilize the relationship between the derived noise-covariance operator and the Jacobian of the mapping between the signal and the scattering data to obtain the properties of the former. Emerging from the structure of the covariance operator is the significance of the Gordon-Haus effect in moderating and finally reversing the increase of the spectral efficiency with power. This effect is showcased in numerical simulations for Gaussian input in the high-bandwidth regime.

Title: Quantifying interdisciplinary synergy in higher STEM education
Authors: Gahyoun Gim, Jinhyuk Yun, Sang Hoon Lee
Abstract: We propose a framework to quantify and utilize interdisciplinarity in science and engineering curricula in the case of university-level higher education. We analyze interdisciplinary relations by standardizing large-scale official educational data in Korea using a cutting-edge large language model and constructing knowledge maps for disciplines of scientific education. We design and evaluate single-field and integrated dual-field curricula by adapting pedagogical theory and utilizing information theory-based metrics. We develop standard curricula for individual disciplines and integrated curricula combining two fields, with their interdisciplinarity quantified by the curriculum synergy score. The results indicate higher interdisciplinarity for combinations within or across closely related fields, especially in engineering fields. Based on the analysis, engineering fields constitute the core structure of our design for curriculum interdisciplinarity, while basic natural science fields are located at peripheral stems to provide fundamental concepts.

Title: Scalable, universal and conformal direct electrodes microprinting for high-performance van der Waals-integrated two-dimensional electronics and flexible applications
Authors: Nan Cui, Tinghe Yun, Bohan Wei, Yang Li, Wenzhi Yu, Denghui Yan, Lianbi Li, Haoran Mu, Weiqiang Chen, Guangyu Zhang, Shenghuang Lin
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials with extraordinary electrical properties, hold promising for large-scale, flexible electronics. However, their device performance could be hindered due to the excessive defects introduced via traditional electrode integration processes. Transfer printing techniques have been developed for van der Waals contacts integration, while existing techniques encounter limitations in achieving conformal electrode transfer and compatibility with flexible devices. Here we introduce a highly conformal microprinting technique utilizing polypropylene carbonate (PPC)/Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) copolymer, which enables successful transfer of wafer-scale, micropatterned electrodes onto diverse substrates, including those with complex geometries. This technique, implemented with 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), yields 2D field-effect transistors with near-ideal ohmic contacts, and a record-high carrier mobility up to 334 cm2 V-1 s-1 for a WSe2 device. Furthermore, we fabricated transistor arrays on MoS2 thin film, which show uniform device performance. We also present the flexible MoS2 transistors that not only achieve a high electron mobility of up to 111 cm2 V-1 s-1 but also exhibit outstanding mechanical robustness. Our findings represent a significant leap forward in the fabrication of flexible 2D electronics, paving the way for numerous emerging technologies.

Title: High-Efficiency Multilevel Phase Lenses with Nanostructures on Polyimide Membranes
Authors: Leslie Howe, Tharindu D. Rajapaksha, Kalani H. Ellepola, Vinh X. Ho, Zachary Aycock, Minh L. P. Nguyen, John P. Leckey, Dave G. Macdonnell, Hyun Jung Kim, Nguyen Q. Vinh
Abstract: The emergence of planar meta-lenses on flexible materials has profoundly impacted the long-standing perception of diffractive optics. Despite their advantages, these lenses still face challenges in design and fabrication to obtain high focusing efficiency and resolving power. A nanofabrication technique is demonstrated based on photolithography and polyimide casting for realizing membrane-based multilevel phase-type Fresnel zone plates (FZPs) with high focusing efficiency. By employing advantageous techniques, these lenses with nanostructures are directly patterned into thin polyimide membranes. The computational and experimental results have indicated that the focusing efficiency of these nanostructures at the primary focus increases significantly with increasing the number of phase levels. Specifically, 16-level phase lenses on a polyimide membrane can achieve a focusing efficiency of more than 91.6% of the input signal (9.5 times better than that of a conventional amplitude-type FZP) and focus light into a diffraction-limited spot together with very weak side-lobes. Furthermore, these lenses exhibit considerably reduced unwanted diffraction orders and produce extremely low background signals. The potential impact of these lenses extends across various applications and techniques including microscopy, imaging, micro-diffraction, remote sensing, and space flight instruments which require lightweight and flexible configurations.

Title: Non-Markovian effects on the steady state properties of a damped harmonic oscillator
Authors: Faisal Farooq, Irfan Ahmad Dar, Muzaffar Qadir Lone
Abstract: We analyze the steady-state characteristics of a damped harmonic oscillator (system) in presence of a non-Markovian bath characterized by Lorentzian spectral density. Although Markovian baths presume memoryless dynamics, the introduction of complex temporal connections by a non-Markovian environment radically modifies the dynamics of the system and its steady-state behaviour. We obtain the steady-state Green's functions and correlation functions of the system using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism. In both rotating and non-rotating wave approximation, we analyzed various emergent properties like effective temperature and distribution function. We also explore the impact of dissipation and non-Markovian bath on the quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno effects. We show that a transition between Zeno to anti-Zeno effect can be tuned by bath spectral width and the strength of dissipation.

Title: Exactly solvable model of the square-root price impact dynamics under the long-range market-order correlation
Authors: Yuki Sato, Kiyoshi Kanazawa
Abstract: In econophysics, there are two enigmatic empirical laws: (i) Due to the order-splitting behavior by institutional traders, the market-order flow has strong and predictable persistence (called the long-range order-sign correlation $C_\tau\propto \tau^{-\alpha-1}$ with $1<\alpha<2$), well formulated as the Lillo-Mike-Farmer model. This phenomenon seems contradictory against the diffusive and unpredictable price dynamics. (ii) The price impact $I(Q)$ by a large metaorder $Q$ has strong nonlinearlity called the the square-root law, $I(Q)\propto \sqrt{Q}$. In this Letter, we propose an exactly solvable model of the price impact dynamics unifying these two empirical laws. We generalize the Lillo-Mike-Farmer model naturally toward the nonliner price impact dynamics: All traders are assumed to be order splitters and their price impact obeys the nonlinear scaling $I(Q)\propto Q^{\delta}$. This model is mapped to the exactly solvable Lévy-walk model with nonlinear walking speed. Our exact solution shows that the price dynamics is shown always diffusive for $\delta=1/2$ even in the presence of order splitters. Our results suggest that the square-root law plays a crucial role in mitigating large price movements in the presence of order splitters, thereby leading to normal diffusive price dynamics, which aligns with the efficient market hypothesis over long timescales.

Abstract: Several experiments have recently reported on gate-tunable superconducting properties in metallic devices, holding promise for the realization of cryogenic switches, tunable resonators, and superconducting logic. In particular, the suppression of the critical current as a function of the gate voltage has been widely investigated. However, time-domain studies are discussed only in a few cases. In this paper, we present a microwave characterization of a gate-controlled Al-capped InAs nanowire embedded in a $\lambda/4$ coplanar waveguide resonator. We observe a shift in the resonator frequency and an increase in its internal losses as a function of the gate voltage, which we relate to a change in the imaginary and real components of the nanowire impedance, respectively. We demonstrate that these changes are described by the Mattis-Bardeen model with an effective temperature. We further study the resonator response to fast gate signals and measure characteristic response times of the order of 40 ns, both in time-domain and parametric modulation experiments. Our study elucidates the impact of the gate on the complex impedance of the nanowire in the superconducting state, as well as its dynamic performance, providing a foundation for the design of gate-controlled superconducting devices.

Title: Deuterium retention in pre-lithiated samples and Li-D co-deposits in the DIII-D tokamak
Authors: M. Morbey, F. Effenberg, S. Abe, T. Abrams, A. Bortolon, R. Hood, U. Losada, A. Nagy, J. Ren, D. L. Rudakov, M. J. Simmonds, D. Truong, T. W. Morgan
Abstract: Divertor designs involving liquid lithium have been proposed as an alternative to solid designs and wall conditioning techniques. However, Li affinity with tritium poses a risk for the fuel cycle. This study investigates deuterium retention in pre-lithiated samples and Li-D co-deposits in the DIII-D tokamak, making for the first time a direct comparison between Li-D co-deposits and pre-deposited Li films. Samples were exposed to H-mode plasmas in the far scrape-off layer (SOL), and Li powder was injected in-situ with the impurity powder dropper to study the uniformity of Li coatings, and the dependence of fuel retention on Li thickness. The results show that at temperatures below the melting point of lithium, deuterium retention is independent of the thickness of pre-deposited Li layers, with Li-D co-deposits being the primary factor for fuel retention. Both pre-deposited and in-situ deposited Li showed lower erosion than predicted by sputtering yield calculations. These results suggest that fuel retention in fusion reactors using lithium in the divertor will likely be dominated by co-deposits rather than in the divertor itself. If one desires to use Li to achieve flatter temperature profiles, operando Li injection is advantageous over pre-deposited Li films, at least at temperatures below the melting point of lithium.

Title: Modelling of a large-scale non-insulated non-planar HTS stellarator coil using Quanscient Allsolve
Authors: Tara Benkel, Mika Lyly, Janne Ruuskanen, Alexandre Halbach, Valtteri Lahtinen, Nicolo Riva
Abstract: Stellarators present features such as steady-state operation and intrinsic stability that make them more attractive than tokamaks in their scaling to fusion power plants. By leveraging more possible configurations, stellarators can be optimized for better engineering feasibility, e.g., resilience to manufacturing tolerances, reduced mechanical load on conductor, material optimization, cost of fabrication. Finite Element Analyses are crucial for the design and optimization of High-Temperature Superconducting (HTS) REBCO non-planar coils. However, accurate simulation of large-scale magnetostatic, mechanical, and quench models can take days or even weeks to compute. In this work, we present a model of a real-size, HTS, non-insulated, non-planar stellarator coil and perform in Quanscient Allsolve, a transient simulation study including modelling quench, using the $H-\varphi$ formulation. It is shown that transient model benefits heavily from the built-in Domain Decomposition Method (DDM), which allows reaching reasonable computation times. Such models become then invaluable in predicting and understanding the complex behavior of non-insulated large-scale REBCO magnets, including their intrinsic energy imbalance.

Title: The Simply Uninformed Thermodynamics of Erasure
Authors: John D. Norton
Abstract: 1. Strong and weak notions of erasure are distinguished according to whether the single erasure procedure does or does not leave the environment in the same state independently of the pre-erasure state. 2. Purely thermodynamic considerations show that strong erasure cannot be dissipationless. 3. The main source of entropy creation in erasure processes at molecular scales is the entropy that must be created to suppress thermal fluctuations ("noise"). 4. A phase space analysis recovers no minimum entropy cost for weak erasure and a positive minimum entropy cost for strong erasure. 5. An information entropy term has been attributed mistakenly to pre-erasure states in the Gibbs formalism through the neglect of an additive constant in the "-k sum p log p" Gibbs entropy formula.

Title: Tuning of Josephson junctions -- the effects of depinning physics
Authors: Oscar W. Kennedy, Jared H. Cole, Connor D. Shelly
Abstract: Building more powerful quantum computers requires manufacturing processes with tight tolerances. To improve the tolerances on Josephson junctions, techniques to fine tune their properties after fabrication have been developed. Understanding how tuning techniques may physically modify the tunnel barrier of a Josephson junction is important and will enable these techniques to be optimised. We develop a model of junction tuning based on depinning theory to interpret a phase diagram of tuning rate. We extract the dependence on temperature, time varying voltages and oscillation frequency. Using depinning theory we are able to show both why time varying annealing potentials result in controlled junction tuning and how such protocols can be optimised. We examine how tuning changes the electrical breakdown of barriers and discrepancies between modeled and measured higher energy levels of transmon qubits.

Title: Deployable Nanoelectromechanical Bound States in the Continuum Enabled by GHz Lamb Wave Phononic Crystals on LiNbO3 Thin Films
Authors: Sheng-Nan Liang, Zhen-Hui Qin, Shu-Mao Wu, Hua-Yang Chen, Si-Yuan Yu, Yan-Feng Chen
Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BICs) are a fascinating class of eigenstates that trap energy within the continuum, enabling breakthroughs in ultra-low-threshold lasing, high-Q sensing, and advanced wave-matter interactions. However, their stringent symmetry requirements hinder practical integration, especially in acoustic and electromechanical systems where efficient mode excitation is challenging. Here, we demonstrate deployable nanoelectromechanical quasi-BICs on suspended lithium niobate (LiNbO3) thin films, enabled by nanoscale Lamb wave phononic crystals (PnCs) operating at gigahertz frequencies. By exploiting the decoupling of symmetric (S) and antisymmetric (A) Lamb wave modes, we create a robust framework for BICs. Controlled mirror symmetry breaking induces targeted coupling between the S and A modes, resulting in quasi-BICs that preserve high-Q characteristics and can be excited by traveling waves, eliminating the need for specialized excitation schemes. Our approach enables the multiplexing of quasi-BIC resonators along a single transmission line, each corresponding to a unique frequency and spatial position. This work presents a scalable route for the on-chip integration of BICs, bridging the gap between theoretical concepts and practical nanoelectromechanical devices, and opening new avenues in advanced signal processing, high-precision sensing, and quantum acoustics.

Title: Monolithic On-Chip Phononic Chiral Anomalous Bulk States on LiNbO3 Thin-films
Authors: Zhe Li, Zhen-Hui Qin, Shu-Mao Wu, Chen-Bei Hao, Fan-Yun Pan, Hao Yan, Yi-Han He, Yan-Shen Zhou, Xue-Jun Yan, Si-Yuan Yu, Cheng He, Ming-Hui Lu, Yan-Feng Chen
Abstract: Phononic materials are crucial for developing efficient, robust mechanical waveguides with strong transport properties, enabling advances in sensing, signal processing, energy harvesting, and microfluidics. A key motivation is their integration into monolithic systems for on-chip applications. While topological phononic materials developed in the past decade offer unidirectional edge states immune to backscattering, their integration requires large volumes to control localized small volumes' transport properties, limiting their efficiency and application in modern phononic circuits. The recently introduced chiral anomalous bulk states (CABSs) combine the advantages of topological materials with innovative boundary designs, overcoming transmission limitations and ensuring full material utilization for superior wave propagation. Here, we present the first on-chip monolithic CABS device integrated on a suspended LiNbO3 thin film. This breakthrough enables the creation of phononic waveguides with unmatched unidirectionality, low loss, and high transmission efficiency, seamlessly integrated with broadband piezoelectric transducers, and showcasing their potential for high-fidelity, broad-bandwidth microwave signal transmission. Additionally, we exploit the slow-wave characteristics of CABSs for delay lines and high-density signal processing. Tailoring wave propagation through boundary engineering opens a new paradigm for phononic/photonic device design, with implications across microelectronics, high-frequency communications, radar, and advanced sensing technologies. The work sets the stage for the future development of highly scalable, multifunctional, and robust phononic systems, unlocking new avenues for integrated acoustic technologies.

Title: Nuclear Spin Engineering for Quantum Information Science
Authors: Jonathan C. Marcks, Benjamin Pingault, Jiefei Zhang, Cyrus Zeledon, F. Joseph Heremans, David D. Awschalom
Abstract: Semiconductors are the backbone of modern technology, garnering decades of investment in high quality materials and devices. Electron spin systems in semiconductors, including atomic defects and quantum dots, have been demonstrated in the last two decades to host quantum coherent spin qubits, often with coherent spin-photon interfaces and proximal nuclear spins. These systems are at the center of developing quantum technology. However, new material challenges arise when considering the isotopic composition of host and qubit systems. The isotopic composition governs the nature and concentration of nuclear spins, which naturally occur in leading host materials. These spins generate magnetic noise -- detrimental to qubit coherence -- but also show promise as local quantum memories and processors, necessitating careful engineering dependent on the targeted application. Reviewing recent experimental and theoretical progress towards understanding local nuclear spin environments in semiconductors, we show this aspect of material engineering as critical to quantum information technology.

Title: The $(2+δ)$-dimensional theory of the electromechanics of lipid membranes: II. Balance laws
Authors: Yannick A. D. Omar, Zachary G. Lipel, Kranthi K. Mandadapu
Abstract: This article is the second of a three-part series that derives a self-consistent theoretical framework of the electromechanics of arbitrarily curved lipid membranes. Existing continuum theories commonly treat lipid membranes as strictly two-dimensional surfaces. While this approach is successful in many purely mechanical applications, strict surface theories fail to capture the electric potential drop across lipid membranes, the effects of surface charges, and electric fields within the membrane. Consequently, they do not accurately resolve Maxwell stresses in the interior of the membrane and its proximity. Furthermore, surface theories are generally unable to capture the effects of distinct velocities and tractions at the interfaces between lipid membranes and their surrounding bulk fluids. To address these shortcomings, we apply a recently proposed dimension reduction method to the three-dimensional, electromechanical balance laws. This approach allows us to derive an effective surface theory without taking the limit of vanishing thickness, thus incorporating effects arising from the finite thickness of lipid membranes. We refer to this effective surface theory as $(2 + \delta)$-dimensional, where $\delta$ indicates the thickness. The resulting $(2 + \delta)$-dimensional equations of motion satisfy velocity and traction continuity conditions at the membrane-bulk interfaces, capture the effects of Maxwell stresses, and can directly incorporate three-dimensional constitutive models.

Title: Exploring Frustration Effects of Strongly Interacting Bosons via the Hall Response
Authors: Catalin-Mihai Halati, Thierry Giamarchi
Abstract: We investigate the Hall response of hardcore bosonic atoms on a triangular ladder in a magnetic field. To access the dynamical properties of this many-body quantum system, we employ matrix product states numerical methods. We show that the behavior of the Hall polarization, both in its saturation value and in the short-time dynamics, correlates with the features of the underlying phase diagram, which stem from the interplay of interactions and geometric frustration. This paves the way to employ the Hall response as a sensitive probe of many-body chiral quantum phases in strongly correlated materials.

Title: Parafermions in Moiré Minibands
Authors: Hui Liu, Raul Perea-Causin, Emil J. Bergholtz
Abstract: Moiré materials provide a remarkably tunable platform for topological and strongly correlated quantum phases of matter. Very recently, the first zero field Abelian fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) have been experimentally demonstrated and it has been theoretically predicted that non-Abelian states with Majorana fermion excitations may be realized in the nearly dispersionless minibands of these systems. Here we provide telltale evidence in terms of low-energy quantum numbers, spectral flow and entanglement spectra for the even more exotic possibility of moiré-based non-Abelian FCIs exhibiting Fibonacci parafermion excitations.

Title: Quantum geometry of bosonic Bogoliubov quasiparticles
Authors: Isaac Tesfaye, André Eckardt
Abstract: Bosonic Bogoliubov de Gennes (BBdG) Hamiltonians describe the excitations of weakly interacting Bose condensates as well as photonic systems under parametric driving. Their topological features have been studied mainly by utilizing a generalized symplectic version of the Berry curvature and related Chern numbers. However, a full characterization of geometrical features in BBdG systems is still lacking. Here, we propose a symplectic quantum geometric tensor (SQGT), whose imaginary part leads to the previously studied symplectic Berry curvature, while the real part gives rise to a symplectic quantum metric, providing a natural distance measure in the space of bosonic Bogoliubov modes. The SQGT is directly related to observable properties of BBdG systems. We show how to measure all components of the SQGT by extracting excitation rates in response to periodic modulations of the systems' parameters. Moreover, we connect the symplectic Berry curvature to a generalized symplectic anomalous velocity term for Bogoliubov-Bloch wave packets. We test our results for a bosonic Bogoliubov-Haldane model.

Title: Decoupling of Static and Dynamic Charge Correlations revealed by Uniaxial Strain in a Cuprate Superconductor
Authors: L. Martinelli, I. Biało, X. Hong, J. Oppliger, C. Lin, T. Schaller, J. Küspert, M. H. Fischer, T. Kurosawa, N. Momono, M. Oda, D. V. Novikov, A. Khadiev, E. Weschke, J. Choi, S. Agrestini, M. Garcia-Fernandez, Ke-Jin Zhou, Q. Wang, J. Chang
Abstract: We use uniaxial strain in combination with ultra-high-resolution Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS) at the oxygen K- and copper L3-edges to study the excitations stemming from the charge ordering wave vector in La1.875Sr0.125CuO4. By detwinning stripe ordering, we demonstrate that the optical phonon anomalies do not show any stripe anisotropy. The low-energy charge excitations also retain an in-plane four-fold symmetry. As such, we find that both phonon and charge excitations are decoupled entirely from the strength of static charge ordering. The almost isotropic character of charge excitations is indicative of a quantum critical behaviour and remains a possible source for the strange metal properties found in the normal state of cuprate superconductors.

Title: Evaporation Characteristics of Heat Pipes with Sub-Critical Nanopores
Authors: Sumith Yesudasan
Abstract: This study explores heat transfer mechanisms in heat pipes with sub-critical nanopores using coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulations, aiming to enhance thermal management in nanoscale applications. With the increasing need for efficient cooling solutions in microelectronics and high-performance computing, nanoporous heat pipes have gained attention due to their high thermal conductivity and passive operation. This research evaluates the effects of pore size, temperature gradients, and water fill ratios on the heat transfer efficiency of heat pipes with 2 nm and 3 nm diameter nanopores. The results indicate that larger temperature gradients significantly enhance heat transfer rates, while filled heat pipes perform better than medium-filled ones, primarily due to more effective phase change and fluid flow dynamics. Notably, the 2 nm filled models show improved performance over the 3 nm models, suggesting an optimal balance between capillary action and fluid resistance at smaller pore sizes. The study also reveals that in sub-critical nanopores, surface-driven flows are more effective than traditional wicking, underscoring the role of surface interactions in optimizing heat transfer. These findings provide critical insights for designing and optimizing nanoporous heat pipes, offering practical guidance for developing more efficient thermal management systems in electronics cooling and other applications.

Title: Strain engineering in Ge/GeSi spin qubits heterostructures
Authors: Lorenzo Mauro, Esteban A. Rodríguez-Mena, Biel Martinez, Yann-Michel Niquet
Abstract: The heavy-holes in Ge/GeSi heterostructures show highly anisotropic gyromagnetic response with in-plane $g$-factors $g_{x,y}^*\lesssim 0.3$ and out-of-plane $g$-factor $g_z^*\gtrsim 10$. As a consequence, Rabi hot spots and dephasing sweet lines are extremely sharp and call for a careful alignment of the magnetic field in Ge spin qubit devices. We investigate how the $g$-factors can be engineered by strains. We show that uniaxial strains can raise in-plane $g$-factors above unity while leaving $g_z^*$ essentially constant. We discuss how the etching of an elongated mesa in a strained buffer can actually induce uniaxial (but inhomogeneous) strains in the heterostructure. This broadens the operational magnetic field range and enables spin manipulation by shuttling holes between neighboring dots with different $g$-factors.

Title: Ground state of the S = 1/2 Heisenberg spin chain with random ferro- and antiferromagnetic couplings
Authors: Sibei Li, Hui Shao, Anders W. Sandvik
Abstract: We study the Heisenberg $S=1/2$ chain with random ferro- and antiferromagnetic couplings using quantum Monte Carlo simulations at ultra-low temperatures, converging to the ground state. Finite-size scaling of correlation functions and excitation gaps demonstrate an exotic critical state in qualitative agreement with previous strong-disorder renormalization group calculations but with scaling exponents depending on the coupling distribution. We find dual scaling regimes of the transverse correlations versus the distance, with an $L$ independent form $C(r)=r^{-\mu}$ for $r \ll L$ and $C(r,L)=L^{-\eta}f(r/L)$ for $r/L > 0$, where $\mu > \eta$ and the scaling function is delivered by our analysis. These results are at variance with previous spin-wave and density-matrix renormalization group calculations, thus highlighting the power of unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations.

Title: Growth of (Cu,C)Ba$_{2}$Ca$_{2}$Cu$_3$O$_{9\pmδ}$ thin films on flexible Hastelloy tapes
Authors: Meng-Jun Ou, Yuecong Liu, Yi Wang, Hai-Hu Wen
Abstract: The applications of superconducting cable or magnet require that the superconductors are made into wires or tapes. For cuprate superconductors, this is a big challenge because of the strong flux motion induced by high anisotropy, very short coherence length and strong thermal fluctuation, etc. One of the ways is to fabricate superconducting films on flexible metallic tapes with oxide buffer layers. The successful one so far is the REBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ (REBCO, RE=rare earth elements) films in tape form, as called the coated conductors. While the superconducting transition temperature of REBCO system is limited to about 90 K. Here we report the successful fabrication of another new non-toxic superconducting film, namely (Cu,C)Ba$_{2}$Ca$_{2}$Cu$_3$O$_{9\pm\delta}$ on these flexible metallic tapes with LaMnO$_3$ and CeO$_2$ as the top layers. The onset superconducting transition occurs at 112 K and 110 K, and the zero-resistance transition temperatures are about 96 K and 98 K, respectively. The temperature dependent resistivity under magnetic fields in different directions reveal a relatively small anisotropy. Further optimization of the films will improve the zero resistance transition temperature, thus can also improve the characteristic properties for applications. Our results show that the (Cu,C)Ba$_{2}$Ca$_{2}$Cu$_3$O$_{9\pm\delta}$ is a promising candidate material for the high power applications in liquid nitrogen temperature region.

Title: All-optical helicity-dependent switching in NiCo$_2$O$_4$ thin films
Authors: Ryunosuke Takahashi, Yann Le Guen, Suguru Nakata, Junta Igarashi, Julius Hohlfeld, Grégory Malinowski, Xie Lingling, Kan Daisuke, Yuichi Shimakawa, Stéphane Mangin, Hiroki Wadati
Abstract: All-optical switching (AOS) involves manipulating magnetization using only pulsed laser, presenting a promising approach for next-generation magnetic recording devices. NiCo2O4 (NCO) thin films, a rare-earth-free ferrimagnetic oxide, exhibit a high Curie temperature and strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. This study demonstrates AOS in NCO thin films at room temperature using long-duration laser pulses and high repetition rates. Unlike previous findings, the AOS phenomena we report here are helicity-dependent and observable with an ultrashort pulsed laser. Consequently, two distinct types of AOS can be observed in a single NCO thin film, contingent on the characteristics of the laser pulses and temperature.

Title: Simulating Chemistry with Fermionic Optical Superlattices
Authors: Fotios Gkritsis, Daniel Dux, Jin Zhang, Naman Jain, Christian Gogolin, Philipp M. Preiss
Abstract: We show that quantum number preserving Ansätze for variational optimization in quantum chemistry find an elegant mapping to ultracold fermions in optical superlattices. Using native Hubbard dynamics, trial ground states of molecular Hamiltonians can be prepared and their molecular energies measured in the lattice. The scheme requires local control over interactions and chemical potentials and global control over tunneling dynamics, but foregoes the need for optical tweezers, shuttling operations, or long-range interactions. We describe a complete compilation pipeline from the molecular Hamiltonian to the sequence of lattice operations, thus providing a concrete link between quantum simulation and chemistry. Our work enables the application of recent quantum algorithmic techniques, such as Double Factorization and quantum Tailored Coupled Cluster, to present-day fermionic optical lattice systems with significant improvements in the required number of experimental repetitions. We provide detailed quantum resource estimates for small non-trivial hardware experiments.

Title: Strain-engineering quantum anomalous Hall effect in janus MnBi2SexTe4-x monolayers
Authors: Jiale Chen, Pengfei Li, Jun Hu
Abstract: Exploring intrinsic magnetic topological insulators (TIs) for next-generation spintronic devices is still challenging in recent years. Here, we present a theoretical investigation on the electronic, magnetic and topological properties of monolayer (ML) Janus MnBi2TexSe4-x, derived from two trivial magnetic semiconductors ML MnBi2Se4 and MnBi2Te4. Our band structure analysis reveals that two out of the eight Janus structures exhibit band inversion induced by spin-orbit coupling. These structures are confirmed to have nonzero integer Chern numbers, indicating their topological nature. Moreover, the topological state is robust under moderate biaxial strains. Interestingly, applying compressive strain results in a high Chern number of 2 and enhances their magnetic stability at elevated temperatures. Our findings offer an effective strategy to engineer magnetic TI states within the ML MnBi2Te4 family.

Title: Finite-temperature quantum field theory of Casimir forces
Authors: P.E. Brandyshev, Yu.A. Budkov
Abstract: We present a quantum theory of Casimir forces between perfect electrical conductors, based on quantum electrodynamics and quantum statistical physics. This theory utilizes Kapusta's finite-temperature quantum field theory, combined with the Faddeev-Popov ghost formalism. This approach allows us to calculate Casimir forces at finite temperatures, providing both previously known and new physical insights from a unified perspective. Furthermore, our method enables us to compute the stress tensor associated with Casimir forces, in accordance with the Helmholtz free energy of an equilibrium quantum electromagnetic field. Using this methodology, we calculate the excess surface tension on the walls of slit-like pores due to the Casimir effect.

Title: Flow Matching for Accelerated Simulation of Atomic Transport in Materials
Authors: Juno Nam, Sulin Liu, Gavin Winter, KyuJung Jun, Soojung Yang, Rafael Gómez-Bombarelli
Abstract: We introduce LiFlow, a generative framework to accelerate molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for crystalline materials that formulates the task as conditional generation of atomic displacements. The model uses flow matching, with a Propagator submodel to generate atomic displacements and a Corrector to locally correct unphysical geometries, and incorporates an adaptive prior based on the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution to account for chemical and thermal conditions. We benchmark LiFlow on a dataset comprising 25-ps trajectories of lithium diffusion across 4,186 solid-state electrolyte (SSE) candidates at four temperatures. The model obtains a consistent Spearman rank correlation of 0.7-0.8 for lithium mean squared displacement (MSD) predictions on unseen compositions. Furthermore, LiFlow generalizes from short training trajectories to larger supercells and longer simulations while maintaining high accuracy. With speed-ups of up to 600,000$\times$ compared to first-principles methods, LiFlow enables scalable simulations at significantly larger length and time scales.

Title: Intrinsic grain boundary mobility tensor from three-dimensional interface random walk
Authors: Xinyuan Song, Chuang Deng
Abstract: In recent years, studies have demonstrated that the grain boundary (GB) migration is a three-dimensional (3D) process, characterized by a 3D mobility tensor. In this study, we develop a 3D interface random walk theory to extract the GB mobility and shear coupling tensors at equilibrium state based on the random walk of the GB position. Using this approach, we mathematically prove the symmetry of the GB mobility tensor in the case of overdamped GB migration. The theory and its conclusions align with molecular dynamics simulation results and disconnection analysis, and the extracted GB mobility and shear coupling tensors reflect the intrinsic GB properties, unaffected by the large driving forces in atomistic simulations. Additionally, we refined the fast adapted random walk (FAIRWalk) method, enabling efficient extraction of the GB mobility tensor from fewer simulations while maintaining high accuracy. Building on this advancement, we conducted an extensive survey of the mobility, shear coupling, and activation energy for the migration of 388 coincidence-site lattice Ni GBs in the Olmsted database. Several intriguing phenomena were observed, including temperature-induced sudden emergence, disappearance, or inversion of shear coupling; GBs with "zero" normal mobility but high shear mobility; and a non-linear relationship between activation energy and mobility. These findings challenge the traditional understanding of GB migration and warrant further investigation.

Title: Self-congruent point in critical matrix product states: An effective field theory for finite-entanglement scaling
Authors: Jan T. Schneider, Atsushi Ueda, Yifan Liu, Andreas M. Läuchli, Masaki Oshikawa, Luca Tagliacozzo
Abstract: We set up an effective field theory formulation for the renormalization flow of matrix product states (MPS) with finite bond dimension, focusing on systems exhibiting finite-entanglement scaling close to a conformally invariant critical fixed point. We show that the finite MPS bond dimension $\chi$ is equivalent to introducing a perturbation by a relevant operator to the fixed-point Hamiltonian. The fingerprint of this mechanism is encoded in the $\chi$-independent universal transfer matrix's gap ratios, which are distinct from those predicted by the unperturbed Conformal Field Theory. This phenomenon defines a renormalization group self-congruent point, where the relevant coupling constant ceases to flow due to a balance of two effects; When increasing $\chi$, the infrared scale, set by the correlation length $\xi(\chi)$, increases, while the strength of the perturbation at the lattice scale decreases. The presence of a self-congruent point does not alter the validity of the finite-entanglement scaling hypothesis, since the self-congruent point is located at a finite distance from the critical fixed point, well inside the scaling regime of the CFT. We corroborate this framework with numerical evidences from the exact solution of the Ising model and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations of an effective lattice model.

Title: Near-field refractometry of van der Waals crystals
Authors: Martin Nørgaard, Torgom Yezekyan, Stefan Rolfs, Christian Frydendahl, N. Asger Mortensen, Vladimir A. Zenin
Abstract: Common techniques for measuring refractive indices, such as ellipsometry and goniometry, are ineffective for van der Waals crystal flakes because of their high anisotropy and small, micron-scale, lateral size. To address this, we employ near-field optical microscopy to analyze the guided optical modes within these crystals. By probing these modes in MoS$_2$ flakes with subwavelength spatial resolution at a wavelength of $1570\,\mathrm{nm}$, we determine both the in-plane and out-of-plane permittivity components of MoS$_2$ as $16.11$ and $6.25$, respectively, with a relative uncertainty below $1\%$, while overcoming the limitations of traditional methods.

Title: Multi-impurity method for the bond-weighted tensor renormalization group
Authors: Satoshi Morita, Naoki Kawashima
Abstract: We propose a multi-impurity method for the bond-weighted tensor renormalization group (BWTRG) to compute the higher-order moment of physical quantities in a two-dimensional system. The replacement of the bond weight with an impurity matrix in a bond-weighted triad tensor network represents a physical quantity such as the magnetization and the energy. We demonstrate that the accuracy of the proposed method is much higher than the conventional tensor renormalization group for the Ising model and the five-state Potts model. Furthermore, we perform the finite-size scaling analysis and observe that the dimensionless quantity characterizing the structure of the fixed point tensor satisfies the same scaling relation in the critical region as the Binder parameter. The estimated critical temperature dependence on the bond dimension indicates that the exponent relating the correlation length to the bond dimension varies continuously with respect to the BWTRG hyperparameter. We find that BWTRG with the optimal hyperparameter is more efficient in terms of computational time than alternative approaches based on the matrix product state in estimating the critical temperature.

Title: Current-induced brightening of vacancy-related emitters in hexagonal boron nitride
Authors: Corinne Steiner, Rebecca Rahmel, Frank Volmer, Rika Windisch, Lars H. Janssen, Patricia Pesch, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Florian Libisch, Bernd Beschoten, Christoph Stampfer, Annika Kurzmann
Abstract: We perform photoluminescence measurements on vacancy-related emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) that are notorious for their low quantum yields. The gating of these emitters via few-layer graphene electrodes reveals a reproducible, gate-dependent brightening of the emitter, which coincides with a change in the direction of the simultaneously measured leakage current across the hBN layers. At the same time, we observe that the relative increase of the brightening effect scales linearly with the intensity of the excitation laser. Both observations can be explained in terms of a photo-assisted electroluminescence effect. Interestingly, emitters can also show the opposite behavior, i.e. a decrease in emitter intensity that depends on the gate leakage current. We explain these two opposing behaviors with different concentrations of donor and acceptor states in the hBN and show that precise control of the doping of hBN is necessary to gain control over the brightness of vacancy-related emitters by electrical means. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of vacancy-related defects in hBN that is necessary to make use of their potential for quantum information processing.

Title: Persistent Homology for Structural Characterization in Disordered Systems
Authors: An Wang, Li Zou
Abstract: We propose a unified framework based on persistent homology (PH) to characterize both local and global structures in disordered systems. It can simultaneously generate local and global descriptors using the same algorithm and data structure, and has shown to be highly effective and interpretable in predicting particle rearrangements and classifying global phases. We also demonstrated that using a single variable enables a linear SVM to achieve nearly perfect three-phase classification. Inspired by this discovery, we define a non-parametric metric, the Separation Index (SI), which not only achieves this classification without sacrificing significant performance but also establishes a connection between particle environments and the global phase structure. Our methods provide an effective framework for understanding and analyzing the properties of disordered materials, with broad potential applications in materials science and even wider studies of complex systems.

Title: Fermi surface reconstruction and enhanced spin fluctuations in strained La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ on LaAlO$_3$(001) and SrTiO$_3$(001)
Authors: Benjamin Geisler, James J. Hamlin, Gregory R. Stewart, Richard G. Hennig, P.J. Hirschfeld
Abstract: We explore the structural and electronic properties of the bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7 on LaAlO3(001) and SrTiO3(001) by using density functional theory including a Coulomb repulsion term. For La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$/LaAlO$_3$(001), we find that compressive strain and electron doping across the interface result in the unconventional occupation of the antibonding Ni $3d_{z^2}$ states. In sharp contrast, no charge transfer is observed for La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$/SrTiO$_3$(001). Surprisingly, tensile strain drives a metallization of the bonding Ni $3d_{z^2}$ states, rendering a Fermi surface topology akin to superconducting bulk La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ under high pressure, yet with spin fluctuations enhanced considerably beyond pressure effects. Concomitantly, significant octahedral rotations are retained. We discuss the fundamental differences between hydrostatic pressure versus epitaxial strain and establish that strain provides a much stronger control over the Ni $e_g$ orbital polarization. The results suggest epitaxial La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$, particularly under tensile strain, as interesting system to provide novel insights into the physics of bilayer nickelates and possibly induce superconductivity without external pressure.

Title: Critical heat current fluctuations in Curie-Weiss model in and out of equilibrium
Authors: Krzysztof Ptaszynski, Massimiliano Esposito
Abstract: In some models of nonequilibrium phase transitions, fluctuations of the analyzed currents have been observed to diverge with system size. To assess whether this behavior is universal across phase transitions, we examined heat current fluctuations in the Curie-Weiss model, a paradigmatic model of the paramagnetic-ferromagnetic phase transition, coupled to two thermal baths. This model exhibits phase transitions driven by both the temperature and the magnetic field. We find that at the temperature-driven phase transition, the heat current noise consists of two contributions: the equilibrium part, which vanishes with system size, and the nonequilibrium part, which diverges with system size. For small temperature differences, this leads to nonmonotonic scaling of fluctuations with system size. In contrast, at the magnetic-field-driven phase transition, heat current fluctuations do not diverge when observed precisely at the phase transition point. Instead, out of equilibrium, the noise is enhanced at the magnetic field values away but close to the phase transition point, due to stochastic switching between two current values. The maximum value of noise increases exponentially with system size, while the position of this maximum shifts towards the phase transition point. Finally, on the methodological side, the paper demonstrates that current fluctuations in large systems can be effectively characterized by combining a path integral approach for macroscopic fluctuations together with an effective two-state model describing subextensive transitions between the two macroscopic states involved in the phase transition.

Title: Effects of the Hubbard interaction on the quantum metric
Authors: Pavlo Sukhachov, Niels Henrik Aase, Kristian Mæland, Asle Sudbø
Abstract: Quantum geometry provides important information about the structure and topology of quantum states in various forms of quantum matter. The information contained therein has profound effects on observable quantities such as superconducting weight, Drude weight, and optical responses. Motivated by the recent advances in flat-band interacting systems, we investigate the role of interaction effects on the quantum metric. By using the fermionic Creutz ladder as a representative system, we show that the repulsive Hubbard interaction monotonically suppresses the quantum metric. While the eigenstates and their overlap quantifying the quantum metric can be obtained exactly in the presence of interactions through exact diagonalization, this method is limited to small system sizes. Alternatively, two theoretical proposals, the generalized quantum metric and the dressed quantum metric, suggest using renormalized Green's functions to define the interacting quantum metric. By comparing these analytical approaches with results from exact diagonalization, we show that the dressed quantum metric provides a better fit to the exact diagonalization results. Our conclusion holds for both flat-band and dispersive systems.

Title: Topology-driven deconfined quantum criticality in magnetic bilayers
Authors: Sondre Duna Lundemo, Flavio S. Nogueira, Asle Sudbø
Abstract: Two-dimensional quantum antiferromagnets are believed to host phases of matter whose excitations are more fundamental than those of the ordered phases. When combining two such spin systems in a bilayer, strong interaction between the emergent excitations can produce phases not realized in either of its subsystems. We show that the critical fluctuations of a two-dimensional spin liquid state can induce a deconfined quantum critical point in a proximate antiferromagnet. The most relevant coupling between the associated effective field theories is given by a mixed Chern-Simons term of the emergent gauge fields in each layer. This describes a topological current-current interaction. In contrast to the local spin-spin interaction, it strongly modifies the renormalization group flow of the theory describing the Néel-valence-bond-solid transition of the antiferromagnet. In particular, the protected coupling constant associated with it implies non-trivial quantum critical scaling characterized by a non-universal power-law divergence of the correlation length in the critical domain and Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless divergence approaching it.

Title: Twist-tuned quantum criticality in moiré bilayer graphene
Authors: Jan Biedermann, Lukas Janssen
Abstract: We argue that moiré bilayer graphene at charge neutrality hosts a continuous semimetal-to-insulator quantum phase transition that can be accessed experimentally by tuning the twist angle between the two layers. For small twist angles near the first magic angle, the system realizes a Kramers intervalley-coherent insulator, characterized by circulating currents and spontaneously broken time reversal and U(1) valley symmetries. For larger twist angles above a critical value, the spectrum remains gapless down to the lowest temperatures, with a fully symmetric Dirac semimetal ground state. Using self-consistent Hartree-Fock theory applied to a realistic model of twisted bilayer graphene, based on the Bistritzer-MacDonald Hamiltonian augmented by screened Coulomb interactions, we find that the twist-tuned quantum phase transition is continuous. We argue that the quantum critical behavior belongs to the relativistic Gross-Neveu-XY universality class, and we characterize it through an effective field theory analysis. Our theoretical predictions can be directly tested using current experimental setups incorporating the recently developed quantum twisting microscope.

Title: Nonequilibrium thermodynamics of populations of weakly-coupled low-temperature-differential Stirling engines with synchronous and asynchronous transitions
Authors: Songhao Yin, Hiroshi Kori, Yuki Izumida
Abstract: This study developed the theory of nonequilibrium thermodynamics for populations of low-temperature-differential (LTD) Stirling engines weakly-coupled in a general class of networks to clarify the effects of synchronous and asynchronous transitions on the power and thermal efficiency. We first show that synchronous (asynchronous) transitions increase (decrease) the power and thermal efficiency of weakly-coupled LTD Stirling engines based on quasilinear response relations between formally defined thermodynamic fluxes and forces. After that, we construct a conceptual model satisfying the quasilinear response relations to give a physical interpretation of the changes in power and thermal efficiency due to synchronous and asynchronous transitions, and justify the use of this conceptual model. We then show that the conceptual model, rather than the quasilinear response relations, preserves the thermodynamic irreversibility of the original model and thus gives more accurate results than those using the quasilinear response relations. Finally, we compare the dynamics between the original and the conceptual models for two-engine systems and show that the conceptual models roughly preserve the dynamical characteristics leading up to the synchronous transitions, while some detailed dynamical structures are lost.

Title: Learning the Electrostatic Response of the Electron Density through a Symmetry-Adapted Vector Field Model
Authors: Mariana Rossi, Kevin Rossi, Alan M. Lewis, Mathieu Salanne, Andrea Grisafi
Abstract: A current challenge in atomistic machine learning is that of efficiently predicting the response of the electron density under electric fields. We address this challenge with symmetry-adapted kernel functions that are specifically derived to account for the rotational symmetry of a three-dimensional vector field. We demonstrate the equivariance of the method on a set of rotated water molecules and show its high efficiency with respect to number of training configurations and features for liquid water and naphthalene crystals. We conclude showcasing applications for relaxed configurations of gold nanoparticles, reproducing the scaling law of the electronic polarizability with size, up to systems with more than 2000 atoms. By deriving a natural extension to equivariant learning models of the electron density, our method provides an accurate and inexpensive strategy to predict the electrostatic response of molecules and materials.

Title: The $(2+δ)$-dimensional theory of the electromechanics of lipid membranes: III. Constitutive models
Authors: Yannick A. D. Omar, Zachary G. Lipel, Kranthi K. Mandadapu
Abstract: This article concludes a three-part series developing a self-consistent theoretical framework of the electromechanics of lipid membranes at the continuum scale. Owing to their small thickness, lipid membranes are commonly modeled as two-dimensional surfaces. However, this approach breaks down when considering their electromechanical behavior as it requires accounting for their thickness. To address this, we developed a dimension reduction procedure in part 1 to derive effective surface theories explicitly capturing the thickness of lipid membranes. We applied this method to dimensionally reduce Gauss' law and the electromechanical balance laws and referred to the resulting theory as $(2+\delta)$-dimensional, where $\delta$ indicates the membrane thickness. However, the $(2+\delta)$-dimensional balance laws derived in part 2 are general, and specific material models are required to specialize them to lipid membranes. In this work, we devise appropriate three-dimensional constitutive models that capture the in-plane fluid and out-of-plane elastic behavior of lipid membranes. The viscous behavior is recovered by a three-dimensional Newtonian fluid model, leading to the same viscous stresses as strictly two-dimensional models. The elastic resistance to bending is recovered by imposing a free energy penalty on local volume changes. While this gives rise to the characteristic bending resistance of lipid membranes, it differs in its higher-order curvature terms from the Canham-Helfrich-Evans theory. Furthermore, motivated by the small mid-surface stretch of lipid membranes, we introduce reactive stresses that enforce mid-surface incompressibility, resulting in an effective surface tension. Finally, we use the constitutive and reactive stresses to derive the equations of motion describing the electromechanics of lipid membranes.

Title: The Rouse ring chain with attractive harmonic potential of spherical symmetry
Authors: Nail Fatkullin, Carlos Mattea, Kevin Lindt, Siegfried Stapf, Margarita Kruteva
Abstract: The static and dynamic properties of a cyclic Rouse chain modified by the introduction of an effective, spherically symmetric, attracting potential of entropic nature is studied. It is shown that a relatively weak potential can lead to a strong contraction of the polymer chain: the radius of gyration becomes much smaller compared to the size of free cyclic chain. The pronounced decrease in the terminal relaxation time of cyclic macromolecules compared to the Rouse relaxation time leads to a lengthening of the time interval for the transition to the normal, i.e. the Fickian, diffusion regime, generating a pseudo-plateau at increasing molecular mass for the time dependence of segmental mean squared segmental displacement.

Title: Integrating Deep-Learning-Based Magnetic Model and Non-Collinear Spin-Constrained Method: Methodology, Implementation and Application
Authors: Daye Zheng, Xingliang Peng, Yike Huang, Yinan Wang, Duo Zhang, Zhengtao Huang, Linfeng Zhang, Mohan Chen, Ben Xu, Weiqing Zhou
Abstract: We propose a non-collinear spin-constrained method that generates training data for deep-learning-based magnetic model, which provides a powerful tool for studying complex magnetic phenomena at the atomic scale. First, we propose a projection method for atomic magnetic moments by applying a radial truncation to the numerical atomic orbitals. We then implement a Lagrange multiplier method that can yield the magnetic torques of atoms by constraining the magnitude and direction of atomic magnetic moments. The method is implemented in ABACUS with both plane wave basis and numerical atomic orbital basis. We benchmark the iron (Fe) systems with the new method and analyze differences from calculations with the plane wave basis and numerical atomic orbitals basis in describing magnetic energy barriers. Based on more than 30,000 first-principles data with the information of magnetic torque, we train a deep-learning-based magnetic model DeePSPIN for the Fe system. By utilizing the model in large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, we successfully predict Curie temperatures of $\alpha$-Fe close to experimental values.

Abstract: We consider a general model of two atomic chains forming a moiré pattern due to a small mismatch in their lattice spacings, given by $\theta = (a_{1} - a_{2})/a_{2}$. Assuming arbitrary single-band dispersion relations $\varepsilon_{1}(p)$ and $\varepsilon_{2}(q)$ for the chains, along with an arbitrary inter-chain coupling term $T(x)$, we show that the entire spectrum of such a one-dimensional moiré superchain is governed by a single three-term recurrence (TTR) relation. We analyze this TTR relation using the discrete WKB method and demonstrate how the entire structure of the spectrum as well as emergence of flat bands can be easily identified from a pair of upper and lower potential functions of the TTR relation. We also comment on the chiral limit of the moiré superchain, which can be viewed, in some sense, as a 1D analog of the chiral limit of Twisted Bilayer Graphene.

Title: AC driven fractional quantum Hall systems: Uncovering unexpected features
Authors: Imen Taktak, Ines Safi
Abstract: We investigate the challenges of reaching the quantum regime and generating minimal excitations in the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) under AC driving. Using the unifying non-equilibrium perturbative (UNEP) approach, we analyze weak backscattering through a quantum point contact (QPC). In both two-terminal geometries and the "anyon collider" setup, the lower bound on photoassisted backscattering noise is set by the photoassisted current rather than the DC noise predicted by Levitov's theorem. This super-Poissonian character is confirmed within the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) framework, where Levitov's theorem is violated, challenging the conventional interpretation of "photoassisted" noise. In the two-terminal geometry, we show that when the QPC has a low scaling dimension, two challenges arise: first, achieving the expected power-law behavior in the DC regime, and second, maintaining the AC quantum regime, where the drive frequency exceeds the temperature, when the DC voltage component is resonant with that drive frequency. The validity of the UNEP relations imposes a lower bound on temperature and a persisting equilibrium contribution to backscattering noise. This forces us to choose a high enough scaling dimension, for which we find that it is rather the photoconductance, often overlooked, that might exhibit spikes at resonant DC voltages, providing a reliable probe of fractional charge. Moreover, we highlight that the zero-temperature limit, frequently assumed in prior studies, including X. G. Wen's foundational work, is inappropriate in this context. Our findings extend beyond the FQHE to coherent conductors and Josephson or phase-slip junctions strongly coupled to an ohmic environment under AC bias, with broader implications for quantum transport and minimal excitation engineering.

Title: Quantifying the Complexity of Materials with Assembly Theory
Authors: Keith Y Patarroyo, Abhishek Sharma, Ian Seet, Ignas Packmore, Sara I. Walker, Leroy Cronin
Abstract: Quantifying the evolution and complexity of materials is of importance in many areas of science and engineering, where a central open challenge is developing experimental complexity measurements to distinguish random structures from evolved or engineered materials. Assembly Theory (AT) was developed to measure complexity produced by selection, evolution and technology. Here, we extend the fundamentals of AT to quantify complexity in inorganic molecules and solid-state periodic objects such as crystals, minerals and microprocessors, showing how the framework of AT can be used to distinguish naturally formed materials from evolved and engineered ones by quantifying the amount of assembly using the assembly equation defined by AT. We show how tracking the Assembly of repeated structures within a material allows us formalizing the complexity of materials in a manner accessible to measurement. We confirm the physical relevance of our formal approach, by applying it to phase transformations in crystals using the HCP to FCC transformation as a model system. To explore this approach, we introduce random stacking faults in closed-packed systems simplified to one-dimensional strings and demonstrate how Assembly can track the phase transformation. We then compare the Assembly of closed-packed structures with random or engineered faults, demonstrating its utility in distinguishing engineered materials from randomly structured ones. Our results have implications for the study of pre-genetic minerals at the origin of life, optimization of material design in the trade-off between complexity and function, and new approaches to explore material technosignatures which can be unambiguously identified as products of engineered design.

Title: Robust Super-Moiré in Large Angle Single-Twist Bilayers

Abstract: Forming long wavelength moiré superlattices (MSL) at small-angle twist van der Waals (vdW) bilayers has been a key approach to creating moiré flat bands. The small-angle twist, however, leads to strong lattice reconstruction, causing domain walls and moiré disorders, which pose considerable challenges in engineering such platforms. At large twist angles, the rigid lattices render a more robust, but shorter wavelength MSL, making it difficult to engineer flat bands. Here, we depict a novel approach to tailoring robust super-moiré (SM) structures that combines the advantages of both small-twist and large-twist transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) bilayers using only a single twist angle near a commensurate angle. Structurally, we unveil the spontaneous formation of a periodic arrangement of three inequivalent commensurate moiré (CM) stacking, where the angle deviation from the commensurate angle can tune the periodicity. Electronically, we reveal a large set of van Hove singularities (VHSs) that indicate strong band hybridization, leading to flat bands near the valence band maximum. Our study paves the way for a new platform of robust SM bilayers with structural rigidity and controllable wavelength, extending the investigation of the interplay among band topology, quantum geometry, and moiré superconductivity to the large twist angle regime.

Title: Giant Topological Hall Effect Across Wide Temperature in Pt/NiCo2O4 Heterostructure

Abstract: Topological Hall effect (THE), a quantum phenomenon arising from emergent magnetic field generated by topological spin texture, is a key method for detecting non-coplanar spin structures like skyrmions in magnetic materials. Here, we investigate a bilayer structure of Pt and conducting ferrimagnet NiCo2O4 (NCO) of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and demonstrate giant THE across a temperature range 2 - 350 K. The absence of THE in single-layer Pt and NCO, as well as in Pt/Cu/NCO, suggests its interfacial origin. The maximum THE occurring just before the NCO coercive field indicates its connection to magnetic nucleation centers, which are topologically equivalent to skyrmions. The large normalized THE, based on the emergent-field model, points to a high population density of small nucleation centers. This aligns with the unresolvable domain structures during magnetization reversal, even though clear domain structures are detected after zero-field cooling. These results establish heavy metal/NCO as a promising system for exploring topological spin structures.

Title: Active energy harvesting and work transduction by hair-cell bundles in bullfrog's inner ear
Authors: Yanathip Thipmaungprom, Laila Saliekh, Rodrigo Alonso, Édgar Roldán, Florian Berger, Roman Belousov
Abstract: Hair cells actively drive oscillations of their mechanosensitive organelles--the hair bundles that enable hearing and balance sensing in vertebrates. Why and how some hair cells expend energy by sustaining this oscillatory motion in order to fulfill their function as signal sensors and others--as amplifiers, remains unknown. We develop a stochastic thermodynamic theory to describe energy flows in a periodically-driven hair bundle. Our analysis of thermodynamic fluxes associated with hair bundles' motion and external sinusoidal stimulus reveals that these organelles operate as thermodynamic work-to-work machines under different operational modes. One operational mode transduces the signal's power into the cell, whereas another allows the external stimulus to harvest the energy supplied by the cell. These two regimes might represent thermodynamic signatures of signal sensing and amplification respectively. In addition to work transduction and energy harvesting, our model also substantiates the capability of hair-cell bundles to operate as heaters and, at the expense of external driving, as active feedback refrigerators. We quantify the performance and robustness of the work-to-work conversion by hair bundles, whose efficiency in some conditions exceeds 80 % of the applied power.

Title: Long-Range Spin-Orbit-Coupled Magnetoelectricity in Type-II Multiferroic NiI$_2$
Authors: Weiyi Pan, Zefeng Chen, Dezhao Wu, Weiqin Zhu, Zhiming Xu, Lianchuang Li, Junsheng Feng, Bing-Lin Gu, Wenhui Duan, Changsong Xu
Abstract: Type-II multiferroics, where spin order induces ferroelectricity, exhibit strong magnetoelectric coupling. However, for the typical 2D type-II multiferroic NiI$_2$, the underlying magnetoelectric mechanism remains unclear. Here, applying generalized spin-current model, together with first-principles calculations and a tight-binding approach, we build a comprehensive magnetoelectric model for spin-induced polarization. Such model reveals that the spin-orbit coupling extends its influence to the third-nearest neighbors, whose contribution to polarization rivals that of the first-nearest neighbors. By analyzing the orbital-resolved contributions to polarization, our tight-binding model reveals that the long-range magnetoelectric coupling is enabled by the strong $e_g$-$p$ hopping of NiI$_2$. Monte Carlo simulations further predict a Bloch-type magnetic skyrmion lattice at moderate magnetic fields, accompanied by polar vortex arrays. These findings can guide the discovery and design of strongly magnetoelectric multiferroics.

Title: Emergent Dynamical Ising Transition in Diffusive Sandpiles
Authors: Armin Makani, Morteza Nattagh Najafi
Abstract: Minimally stable site (MSS) clusters play a dominant role in shaping avalanches in the self-organized critical (SOC) systems. The manipulation of MSS clusters through local smoothings (diffusion) alter the MSS landscape, suppressing rare avalanches and postponing them until they manifest as spanning avalanches. By leveraging the Inverse Ising problem, we uncover a duality between diffusive sandpiles and equilibrium statistical physics. Our analysis reveals an emergent magnetic instability in the dual Ising model, coinciding with the formation of spanning avalanches and marking a transition to a correlated percolation regime. At this point, the MSS loop soups exhibit fractal self-similarity and power-law distributions, while the effective pairwise interactions in the dual system vanish, signaling a magnetic transition characterized by abrupt changes in magnetization and spin susceptibility. Crucially, we show that diffusion fundamentally reshapes avalanche dynamics: the spatial anti-correlations of MSSs in standard SOC systems transform into positive correlations when diffusion is introduced. These findings bridge self-organized criticality, percolation theory, and equilibrium phase transitions, shedding new light on emergent criticality and large-scale correlations in non-equilibrium systems.

Title: Particle geometry space: An integrated characterization of particle shape, surface area, volume, specific surface, and size distribution
Authors: Priya Tripathi, Seung Jae Lee
Abstract: Particle size and shape are the key 3D particle geometry parameters that govern the complex behavior of granular materials. The effect of these geometry parameters has often been examined in isolation, e.g., through separate analysis of particle size distribution (PSD) and shape distribution, leading to an unaddressed knowledge gap. Beyond size and shape, 3D particle geometry also encompasses attributes such as surface area and volume (or collectively, the surface-area-to-volume ratio, which is also referred to as specific surface). To comprehensively understand the influence of particle geometry on the behavior of granular materials, it is important to integrate these parameters, ideally into a single analytical framework. To this end, this paper presents a new approach, Particle Geometry Space (PGS), formulated based on the principle that the four 3D particle geometry attributes - volume, surface area, size, and shape - can be uniformly represented as a function of specific surface. This space not only encompasses all 3D particle geometry attributes but also extends its scope by integrating the conventional PSD concept. This innovation enables engineers and researchers who are already familiar with PSD to perform a more systematic characterization of 3D particle geometries. The paper (i) discusses the limitations of existing methods for characterizing particle geometry, (ii) offers an overview of the PGS, (iii) proposes a method for integrating PSD into the PGS, and (iv) demonstrates its application with a set of 3D mineral particle geometry data.

Title: Sparse Edge Encoder (SEE): I. Visual recognition in neuronal networks
Authors: Chia-Ying Lin, Mei Ian Sam, Yi-Ching Tsai, Hsiu-Hau Lin
Abstract: In the past few decades, there have been intense debates whether the brain operates at a critical state. To verify the criticality hypothesis in the neuronal networks is challenging and the accumulating experimental and theoretical results remain controversial at this point. Here we simulate how visual information of a nature image is processed by the finite Kinouchi-Copelli neuronal network, extracting the trends of the mutual information (how sensible the neuronal network is), the dynamical range (how sensitive the network responds to external stimuli) and the statistical fluctuations (how criticality is defined in conventional statistical physics). It is rather remarkable that the optimized state for visual recognition, although close to, does not coincide with the critical state where the statistical fluctuations reach the maximum. Different images and/or network sizes of course lead to differences in details but the trend of the information optimization remains the same. Our findings pave the first step to investigate how the information processing is optimized in different neuronal networks and suggest that the criticality hypothesis may not be necessary to explain why a neuronal network can process information smartly.

Title: Pump-efficient Josephson parametric amplifiers with high saturation power
Authors: Nicholas M. Hougland, Zhuan Li, Ryan Kaufman, Boris Mesits, Roger S. K. Mong, Michael Hatridge, David Pekker
Abstract: Circuit QED based quantum information processing relies on low noise amplification for signal readout. In the realm of microwave superconducting circuits, this amplification is often achieved via Josephson parametric amplifiers (JPA). In the past, these amplifiers exhibited low power added efficiency (PAE), which is roughly the fraction of pump power that is converted to output signal power. This is increasingly relevant because recent attempts to build high saturation power amplifiers achieve this at the cost of very low PAE, which in turn puts a high heat load on the cryostat and limits the number of these devices that a dilution refrigerator can host. Here, we numerically investigate upper bounds on PAE. We focus on a class of parametric amplifiers that consists of a capacitor shunted by a nonlinear inductive block. We first set a benchmark for this class of amplifiers by considering nonlinear blocks described by an arbitrary polynomial current-phase relation. Next, we propose two circuit implementations of the nonlinear block. Finally, we investigate chaining polynomial amplifiers. We find that while amplifiers with higher gain have a lower PAE, regardless of the gain there is considerable room to improve as compared to state of the art devices. For example, for a phase-sensitive amplifier with a power gain of 20 dB, the PAE is ~0.1% for typical JPAs, 5.9% for our simpler circuit JPAs, 34% for our more complex circuit JPAs, 48% for our arbitrary polynomial amplifiers, and at least 95% for our chained amplifiers.

Title: Stability-Aware Training of Machine Learning Force Fields with Differentiable Boltzmann Estimators
Authors: Sanjeev Raja, Ishan Amin, Fabian Pedregosa, Aditi S. Krishnapriyan
Abstract: Machine learning force fields (MLFFs) are an attractive alternative to ab-initio methods for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. However, they can produce unstable simulations, limiting their ability to model phenomena occurring over longer timescales and compromising the quality of estimated observables. To address these challenges, we present Stability-Aware Boltzmann Estimator (StABlE) Training, a multi-modal training procedure which leverages joint supervision from reference quantum-mechanical calculations and system observables. StABlE Training iteratively runs many MD simulations in parallel to seek out unstable regions, and corrects the instabilities via supervision with a reference observable. We achieve efficient end-to-end automatic differentiation through MD simulations using our Boltzmann Estimator, a generalization of implicit differentiation techniques to a broader class of stochastic algorithms. Unlike existing techniques based on active learning, our approach requires no additional ab-initio energy and forces calculations to correct instabilities. We demonstrate our methodology across organic molecules, tetrapeptides, and condensed phase systems, using three modern MLFF architectures. StABlE-trained models achieve significant improvements in simulation stability, data efficiency, and agreement with reference observables. The stability improvements cannot be matched by reducing the simulation timestep; thus, StABlE Training effectively allows for larger timesteps. By incorporating observables into the training process alongside first-principles calculations, StABlE Training can be viewed as a general semi-empirical framework applicable across MLFF architectures and systems. This makes it a powerful tool for training stable and accurate MLFFs, particularly in the absence of large reference datasets. Our code is available at this https URL.

Title: Adiabatic modulation of driving protocols in periodically driven quantum systems
Authors: Ashwin Murali, Tapomoy Guha Sarkar, Jayendra N. Bandyopadhyay
Abstract: We consider a periodically driven system where the high-frequency driving protocol consists of a sequence of potentials switched on and off at different instants within a period. We explore the possibility of introducing an adiabatic modulation of the driving protocol by considering a slow evolution of the instants when the sequence of potentials is switched on/off. We examine how this influences the long-term dynamics of periodically driven quantum systems. By assuming that the slow and fast timescales in the problem can be decoupled, we derive the stroboscopic (effective) Hamiltonian for a four-step driving sequence up to the first order in perturbation theory. We then apply this approach to a spin-$1/2$ system, where the adiabatic modulation of the driving protocol is chosen to produce an evolving emergent magnetic field that interacts with the spin. We study the emergence of diabolical points and diabolical loci in the parameter space of the effective Hamiltonian. Further, we study the topological properties of the maps of the adiabatic paths in the parameter space to the eigenspace of the effective Hamiltonian. In effect, we obtain a technique for tuning the topological properties of the eigenstates by selecting different adiabatic evolutions of the driving protocol, characterized by distinct paths in parameter space. This technique can be applied to any periodic driving protocol to achieve desirable topological effects.

Title: General theory for packing icosahedral shells into multi-component aggregates
Authors: Nicolò Canestrari, Diana Nelli, Riccardo Ferrando
Abstract: Multi-component aggregates are being intensively researched in various fields because of their highly tunable properties and wide applications. Due to the complex configurational space of these systems, research would greatly benefit from a general theoretical framework for the prediction of stable structures, which, however, is largely incomplete at present. Here we propose a general theory for the construction of multi-component icosahedral structures by assembling concentric shells of different chiral and achiral types, consisting of particles of different sizes. By mapping shell sequences into paths in the hexagonal lattice, we establish simple and general rules for designing a wide variety of magic icosahedral structures, and we evaluate the optimal size-mismatch between particles in the different shells. The predictions of our design strategy are confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory calculations for several multi-component atomic clusters and nanoparticles.

Title: Feynman path integrals for discrete-variable systems: Walks on Hamiltonian graphs
Authors: Amir Kalev, Itay Hen
Abstract: We propose a natural, parameter-free, discrete-variable formulation of Feynman path integrals. We show that for discrete-variable quantum systems, Feynman path integrals take the form of walks on the graph whose weighted adjacency matrix is the Hamiltonian. By working out expressions for the partition function and transition amplitudes of discretized versions of continuous-variable quantum systems, and then taking the continuum limit, we explicitly recover Feynman's continuous-variable path integrals. We also discuss the implications of our result.

Title: Viscoelastic Worthington jets \& droplets produced by bursting bubbles
Authors: Ayush K. Dixit, Alexandros Oratis, Konstantinos Zinelis, Detlef Lohse, Vatsal Sanjay
Abstract: Bubble bursting and subsequent collapse of the open cavity at free surfaces of contaminated liquids can generate aerosol droplets, facilitating pathogen transport. After film rupture, capillary waves focus at the cavity base, potentially generating fast Worthington jets that are responsible for ejecting the droplets away from the source. While extensively studied for Newtonian fluids, the influence of non-Newtonian rheology on this process remains poorly understood. Here, we employ direct numerical simulations to investigate the bubble cavity collapse in viscoelastic media, such as polymeric liquids. We find that the jet and drop formation are dictated by two dimensionless parameters: the elastocapillary number $Ec$ (the ratio of the elastic modulus and the Laplace pressure) and the Deborah number $De$ (the ratio of the relaxation time and the inertio-capillary timescale). We show that for low values of $Ec$ and $De$, the viscoelastic liquid adopts a Newtonian-like behavior, where the dynamics are governed by the solvent Ohnesorge number $Oh_s$ (the ratio of visco-capillary and inertio-capillary timescales). In contrast, for large values $Ec$ and $De$, the enhanced elastic stresses completely suppress the formation of the jet. For some cases with intermediate values of $Ec$ and $De$, smaller droplets are produced compared to Newtonian fluids, potentially enhancing aerosol dispersal. By mapping the phase space spanned by $Ec$, $De$, and $Oh_s$, we reveal three distinct flow regimes: (i) jets forming droplets, (ii) jets without droplet formation, and (iii) absence of jet formation. Our results elucidate the mechanisms underlying aerosol suppression versus fine spray formation in polymeric liquids, with implications for pathogen transmission and industrial processes involving viscoelastic fluids.

Title: Error Thresholds in Presence of Epistatic Interactions
Authors: David A. Herrera-Martí
Abstract: Models for viral populations with high replication error rates (such as RNA viruses) rely on the quasispecies concept, in which mutational pressure beyond the so-called "Error Threshold" leads to a loss of essential genetic information and population collapse, an effect known as the "Error Catastrophe". We explain how crossing this threshold, as a result of increasing mutation rates, can be understood as a second order phase transition, even in the presence of lethal mutations. In particular, we show that, in fitness landscapes with a single peak, this collapse is equivalent to a ferro-paramagnetic transition, where the back-mutation rate plays the role of the external magnetic field. We then generalize this framework to rugged fitness landscapes, like the ones that arise from epistatic interactions, and provide numerical evidence that there is a transition from a high average fitness regime to a low average fitness one, similarly to single-peaked landscapes. The onset of the transition is heralded by a sudden change in the susceptibility to variations in the mutation rate. We use insight from Replica Symmetry Breaking mechanisms in spin glasses, in particular by considering the fluctuations of the genotype similarity distribution as the order parameter.

Title: One Loop Thermal Effective Action
Authors: Joydeep Chakrabortty, Subhendra Mohanty
Abstract: We compute the one loop effective action for a Quantum Field Theory at finite temperature, in the presence of background gauge fields, employing the Heat-Kernel method. This method enables us to compute the thermal corrections to the Wilson coefficients associated with effective operators up to arbitrary mass dimension, which emerge after integrating out heavy scalars and fermions from a generic UV theory. The Heat-Kernel coefficients are functions of non-zero background `electric', `magnetic' fields, and Polyakov loops. A major application of our formalism is the calculation of the finite temperature Coleman-Weinberg potential in effective theories, necessary for the study of phase transitions. A novel feature of this work is the systematic calculation of the dependence of Polyakov loops on the thermal factors of Heat-Kernel coefficients and the Coleman-Weinberg potential. We study the effect of Polyakov loop factors on phase transitions and comment on future directions in applications of the results derived in this work.

Title: Correlated Growth of Causal Networks
Authors: Jiazhen Liu, Kunal Tamang, Dashun Wang, Chaoming Song
Abstract: The study of causal structure in complex systems has gained increasing attention, with many recent studies exploring causal networks that capture cause-effect relationships across diverse fields. Despite increasing empirical evidence linking causal structures to network topological correlations, the mechanisms underlying the emergence of these correlations in causal networks remain poorly understood. In this work, we propose a general growth framework for causal networks, incorporating two key types of correlations: causal and dynamic. We analytically demonstrate that degree correlations emerge as a consequence of marginal dependencies on these correlations. Our theoretical predictions align quantitatively with empirical data from four large-scale innovation networks. Our theory not only sheds light on the origins of topological correlations but also provides a general framework for understanding correlated growth across causal systems.

Title: Grassmann tensor approach for two-dimensional QCD in the strong-coupling expansion
Authors: Thomas Samberger, Jacques Bloch, Robert Lohmayer
Abstract: We present a tensor-network approach for the strong-coupling expansion of two-dimensional QCD with staggered quarks at non-zero chemical potential. After expanding the Boltzmann factor in the gauge and fermion actions, all gauge fields can be integrated out exactly and the partition function can be evaluated using the Grassmann higher-order tensor renormalization group approach. The method is modified to compute the $\mu$ dependence of the quark number density and the chiral condensate up to order $\beta^3$ with complete absence of higher-order terms infiltrating the result. Although the expansion itself is only a good approximation to the full theory at small $\beta<0.1$, the range can be extended, by using judiciously chosen fits. Moreover, these fits also yield a valuable expansion in $\beta$ for the critical chemical potential.
