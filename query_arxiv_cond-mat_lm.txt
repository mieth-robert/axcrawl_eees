Title: Critical Probability Distributions of the order parameter at two loops II: $O(n)$ universality class
Authors: Sankarshan Sahu
Abstract: We show how to compute the probability distributions of the order parameter of the $O(n)$ model at two-loop order of perturbation theory generalizing the methods developed for computing the same in case of the Ising model \cite{Sahu:2025bkp}. We show that even for the $O(n)$ model, there exists not one but a family of these probability distribution functions indexed by $\zeta$ which is the ratio of system size $L$ to the bulk correlation length $\xi_{\infty}$. We also compare these PDFs to the Monte-Carlo simulations and the existing FRG results \cite{Rancon:2025bjf} for the $O(2)$ and $O(3)$ models.

Title: Size-restricted magnetotransport in the delafossite metals PdCoO$_2$ and PtCoO$_2$
Authors: Michal Moravec, Graham Baker, Maja D. Bachmann, Aaron L. Sharpe, Nabhanila Nandi, Arthur W. Barnard, Carsten Putzke, Seunghyun Khim, Markus König, David Goldhaber-Gordon, Philip J.W. Moll, Andrew P. Mackenzie
Abstract: Studies of electronic transport in width-restricted channels of PdCoO$_2$ have recently revealed a novel `directional ballistic' regime, in which ballistic propagation of electrons on an anisotropic Fermi surface breaks the symmetries of bulk transport. Here we introduce a magnetic field to this regime, in channels of PdCoO$_2$ and PtCoO$_2$ along two crystallographically distinct directions and over a wide range of widths. We observe magnetoresistance distinct from that in the bulk, with features strongly dependent on channel orientation and becoming more pronounced the narrower the channel. Comparison to semi-classical theory establishes that magnetoresistance arises from field-induced modification of boundary scattering, and helps connect features in the data with specific electronic trajectories. However, the role of bulk scattering in our measurements is yet to be fully understood. Our results demonstrate that finite-size magnetotransport is sensitive to the anisotropy of Fermi surface properties, motivating future work to fully understand and exploit this sensitivity.

Title: Spontaneous Chern-Euler Duality Transitions
Authors: Kang Yang, Zhi Li, Peng Xue, Emil J. Bergholtz, Piet W. Brouwer
Abstract: Topological phase transitions are typically characterized by abrupt changes in a quantized invariant. Here we report a contrasting paradigm in non-Hermitian parity-time symmetric systems, where the topological invariant remains conserved, but its nature transitions between the Chern number, characteristic of chiral transport in complex bands, and the Euler number, which characterizes the number of nodal points in pairs of real bands. The transition features qualitative changes in the non-Abelian geometric phases during spontaneous parity-time symmetry breaking, where different quantized components become mutually convertible. Our findings establish a novel topological duality principle governing transitions across symmetry classes and reveal unique non-unitary features intertwining topology, symmetry, and non-Abelian gauge structure.

Title: Stochastic 1D search-and-capture as a G/M/c queueing model
Authors: José Giral-Barajas, Paul C Bressloff
Abstract: We study the accumulation of resources within a target due to the interplay between continual delivery, driven by 1D stochastic search processes, and the sequential consumption of resources. The assumption of sequential consumption is key because it changes the commonly used $G/M/\infty$ queue to a $G/M/c$ queue. Combining the theory of $G/M/c$ queues with the theory of first-passage times, we derive general conditions for the search process to ensure that the number of resources within the queue converges to a steady state and compute explicit expressions for the mean and variance of the number of resources within the queue at steady state. We then compare the performance of the $G/M/c$ queue with that of the $G/M/\infty$ queue for an increasing number of servers. We extend the model to consider two competing targets and show that, under specific scenarios, an additional target is beneficial to the original target. Finally, we study the effects of multiple searchers. Using renewal theory, we numerically compute the inter-arrival time density for $M$ searchers in the Laplace space, which allows us to exploit the explicit expressions for the steady-state statistics of the number of resources within $G/M/1$ and $G/M/\infty$ queues, and compare their behavior with different numbers of searchers. Overall, the $G/M/c$ queue shows a tighter dependence on the configuration of the search process than the $G/M/\infty$ queue does.

Title: High thermoelectric power factor in Ni-Fe alloy for active cooling applications
Authors: Shuai Li, Sree Sourav Das, Haobo Wang, Sujit Bati, Prasanna V. Balachandran, Junichiro Shiomi, Jerrold A. Floro, Mona Zebarjadi
Abstract: Metallic thermoelectric materials are promising candidates for active cooling applications, where high thermal conductivity and a high thermoelectric power factor are essential to maximize effective thermal conductivity. While metals inherently possess high thermal and electrical conductivities, they typically exhibit low Seebeck coefficients. In this work, we create a database and apply machine learning techniques to identify metallic binary alloys with large Seebeck coefficients. Specifically, we identify Ni-Fe as a promising candidate for active cooling. We then fabricate Ni-Fe ingots and demonstrate thermoelectric power factor values as high as 120 {\mu}W/{cm.K^2} at 200 K for these stable alloys, which are composed of cost-effective and abundant elements. Furthermore, we show that the effective thermal conductivity of these alloys, under small temperature differences, can exceed that of pure copper at temperatures above 250 K.

Title: Quantum Borderlines -- Fluctuation Energies in Ultracold Bose Gases
Authors: Carsten Henkel
Abstract: Ultracold Bose gases are many-body systems with well-defined particle interactions that may serve as models for interacting quantum fields. The impact of virtual excitations is studied in the spatial transition zone created by a soft confinement potential that separates a degenerate ideal gas from a dense quasi-condensate. We compute within Bogoliubov theory the contribution of quasi-particles to the surface energy at zero temperature.

Title: Metallicity-driven polar transitions in topological epilayers
Authors: Eduardo D. Stefanato, Nicolas M. Kawahala, Bianca A. Kawata, Paulo H. O. Rappl, Eduardo Abramof, Felix G. G. Hernandez
Abstract: Polar metals, materials that exhibit both electric polarization and high conductivity, can also host topological phases. Because free carriers strongly suppress distortive polar order and change the Fermi level, controlling charge dynamics is crucial for simultaneously tuning ferroelectric and topological phases in the same material. Here, we explore the experimental conditions that enable access to these phases in bismuth-doped Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$Te epilayers. For samples in the topological phase at $x = 0.5$, we use terahertz time-domain spectroscopy to evaluate their complex permittivity as a function of temperature. We observe a non-monotonic variation in carrier concentration with bismuth doping, indicating a change in carrier type. By tracking the transverse optical phonon mode, we identify a ferroelectric phase transition when distortive polar order emerges below a critical temperature that depends on carrier concentration. We show that bismuth doping controls the metallicity-dependent order parameters in the softening and hardening phases. Our work demonstrates a tunable platform for engineering exotic states of matter that integrate metallicity, ferroelectricity and topology.

Title: Most topological orders forbid sign-problem-free quantum Monte Carlo: Nonpositive Gauss sum as an indicator
Authors: Donghae Seo, Minyoung You, Hee-Cheol Kim, Gil Young Cho
Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo is a powerful tool for studying quantum many-body physics, yet its efficacy is often curtailed by the notorious sign problem. In this Letter, we introduce a novel criterion for the "intrinsic" sign problem in two-dimensional bosonic topological orders, which cannot be resolved by local basis transformations or adiabatic deformations of the Hamiltonian. Specifically, we show that a nonpositive higher Gauss sum for a given topological order indicates the presence of an intrinsic sign problem. This condition not only aligns with prior findings but significantly broadens their scope. Using this new criterion, we examine the Gauss sums of all 405 bosonic topological orders classified up to rank 12, and strikingly find that 398 of them exhibit intrinsic sign problems. We also uncover intriguing links between the intrinsic sign problem, gappability of boundary theories, and time-reversal symmetry, suggesting that sign-problem-free quantum Monte Carlo may fundamentally rely on both time-reversal symmetry and gapped boundaries. These results highlight the deep connection between the intrinsic sign problem and fundamental properties of topological phases, offering valuable insights into their classical simulability.

Title: Shape instabilities driven by topological defects in nematic polymer networks
Authors: Silvia Paparini, Giulio G. Giusteri, L. Angela Mihai
Abstract: Liquid crystalline networks (LCNs) are stimuli-responsive materials formed from polymeric chains cross-linked with rod-like mesogenic segments, which, in the nematic phase, align along a non-polar director. A key characteristic of these nematic systems is the existence of singularities in the director field, known as topological defects or disclinations, and classified by their topological charge. In this study, we address the open question of modeling mathematically the coupling between mesogens disclination and polymeric network by providing a mathematical framework describing the out-of-plane shape changes of initially flat LCN sheets containing a central topological defect. Adopting a variational approach, we define an energy associated with the deformations consisting of two contributions: an elastic energy term accounting for spatial director variations, and a strain-energy function describing the elastic response of the polymer network. The interplay between nematic elasticity, which seeks to minimize distortions in the director field, variations in the degree of order, with the consequent tendency of monomers in the polymer chains to distribute anisotropically in response to an external stimulus, and mechanical stiffness, which resists deformation, determines the resulting morphology. We analyze the transition to instability of the ground-state flat configuration and characterize the corresponding buckling modes.

Title: Observation of Magnomechanics at Low Temperatures
Authors: Y. Huang, P.M.C Rourke, A. Peruzzi, J. Jin, M. Ebrahimi, A. Rashedi, J. P. Davis
Abstract: Cavity magnomechanics combines strong coupling between magnons in a dielectric material and microwave cavity photons with long-lived mechanical resonances. Forming a triple resonance condition, this hybrid quantum system promises many advantages in quantum technologies, yet has never been studied at the cryogenic temperatures required to reveal such quantum properties. We report the first observation of magnomechanics at cryogenic temperatures down to 9 K. The experiment was conducted using a YIG sphere inside a microwave cavity, where we measured both the thermomechanical motion and the temperature-dependence of the magnon linewidth.

Title: Magnetic polarons due to spin-length fluctuations in $\boldsymbol{d}^\mathbf{4}$ spin-orbit Mott systems
Authors: Jan Revenda, Krzysztof Wohlfeld, Jiří Chaloupka
Abstract: Mott insulators based on $4d$ and $5d$ transition-metal ions, where spin-orbit interaction plays a key role, can exhibit various forms of unusual magnetism. A particular example is the antiferromagnet Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ containing $d^4$ Ru$^{4+}$ ions. Here the spin-orbit interaction stabilizes the non-magnetic $J=0$ singlet ionic ground state, which gets dynamically mixed - via exchange interactions - with low-energy $J=1$ ionic excitations. Thanks to a sufficient strength of the exchange, these excitations condense and a long-range order emerges. The resulting ordered moments are soft and prone to fluctuations of their effective length. The corresponding amplitude mode appears as a prominent magnetic excitation and complements the conventional magnons involving rotations of the moments. Motivated by this peculiar kind of magnetic order and the specific spectrum of magnetic excitations, we study their influence on the propagation of doped carriers. To this end, we construct a microscopic model including both $d^4$ and $d^5$ degrees of freedom and address the propagation of an injected electron by employing self-consistent Born approximation. We find that the electron shows a combination of both free and a polaronic type of motion, where the mobile carrier strongly interacts with an accompanying cloud of magnetic excitations. Remarkably, in the latter case it is the exotic excitation - the amplitude mode - that is found to dominate over the contribution of magnons. Our soft-spin situation thus largely contrasts with spin polarons widely discussed in the context of doped Heisenberg-like magnets based on rigid spin moments.

Title: Dynasor 2: From Simulation to Experiment Through Correlation Functions
Authors: Esmée Berger, Erik Fransson, Fredrik Eriksson, Eric Lindgren, Göran Wahnström, Thomas Holm Rod, Paul Erhart
Abstract: Correlation functions, such as static and dynamic structure factors, offer a versatile approach to analyzing atomic-scale structure and dynamics. By having access to the full dynamics from atomistic simulations, they serve as valuable tools for understanding material behavior. Experimentally, material properties are commonly probed through scattering measurements, which also provide access to static and dynamic structure factors. However, it is not trivial to decode these due to complex interactions between atomic motion and the probe. Atomistic simulations can help bridge this gap, allowing for detailed understanding of the underlying dynamics. In this paper, we illustrate how correlation functions provide structural and dynamical insights from simulation and showcase the strong agreement with experiment. To compute the correlation functions, we have updated the Python package dynasor with a new interface and, importantly, added support for weighting the computed quantities with form factors or cross sections, facilitating direct comparison with probe-specific structure factors. Additionally, we have incorporated the spectral energy density method, which offers an alternative view of the dispersion for crystalline systems, as well as functionality to project atomic dynamics onto phonon modes, enabling detailed analysis of specific phonon modes from atomistic simulation. We illustrate the capabilities of dynasor with diverse examples, ranging from liquid Ni3Al to perovskites, and compare computed results with X-ray, electron and neutron scattering experiments. This highlights how computed correlation functions can not only agree well with experimental observations, but also provide deeper insight into the atomic-scale structure and dynamics of a material.

Title: Petal-Graphyne: A Novel 2D Carbon Allotrope for High-Performance Li and Na Ion Storage
Authors: Kleuton A. L. Lima, José A. S. Laranjeira, Nicolas F. Martins, Alexandre C. Dias, J ulio R. Sambrano, Douglas S. Galvão, Luiz A. Ribeiro Junior
Abstract: Using density functional theory simulations, this study introduces Petal-Graphyne (PLG), a novel multi-ring metallic structure composed of 4-, 8-, 10-, and 16-membered rings. Its structural, electronic, and lithium/sodium storage properties were comprehensively investigated. PLG exhibits a high theoretical capacity of 1004 mAh/g for Li, Na, and mixed Li/Na ions, surpassing conventional graphite anodes. The material remains metallic, with multiple band crossings at the Fermi level. The optimal energy barriers for Li (0.28 eV) and Na (0.25 eV) on PLG and favorable diffusion coefficients in both monolayer and multilayer configurations are unveiled. The open circuit voltages are 0.47 V for Li, 0.51 V for Na, and 0.54 V for mixed-ion storage, suggesting stable electrochemical performance. These results highlight PLG as a promising candidate for next-generation lithium and sodium-ion batteries, combining high storage capacity and efficient ion transport.

Title: Rotating anisotropic Bose gas with large number of vortices
Authors: A. Keles
Abstract: Rapidly rotating atomic gases provide a platform for studying phenomena akin to type-II superconductors and quantum Hall systems. Recently, these systems have attracted renewed interest due to technological advances in the trap anisotropy control, in-situ observation capabilities, and cooling and rotating complex atomic species such as dipolar gases. Understanding the vortex lattice formation and quantum melting is crucial for exploring quantum Hall physics in these systems. In this paper, we theoretically investigate the vortex lattices in anisotropic quantum gases. We formulate the rotating gas Hamiltonian in the Landau gauge, and consider the effects of additional perturbations such as the trap potential in the lowest Landau level (LLL). Focusing on the gases with short-range interactions, we obtain the many-body Hamiltonian projected to lowest Landau level. We consider the limit of full Bose-Einstein condensation and obtain the governing Gross-Pitaevskii equation to identify the possible vortex phases. We numerically solve the Gross-Pitaevskii equation using the imaginary time evolution, and demonstrate the possible vortex lattices as a function of anisotropy, rotation speed and interaction strength. We show that the number of states with a support in the LLL, which determines the number of vortices, follows a Thomas-Fermi type scaling albeit with slightly different coefficients from the usual condensates.

Title: Sub-nm Curvature Unlocks Exceptional Inherent Flexoelectricity in Graphene
Authors: Sathvik Ajay Iyengar, James G. McHugh, Jonathan P. Salvage, Robert Vajtai, Alan Dalton, Manoj Tripathi, Pulickel M. Ajayan, Vincent Meunier
Abstract: Flexoelectricity arises from strain-gradient-induced polarization and is pronounced in two-dimensional (2D) materials due to their mechanical flexibility and sensitivity to structural deformations. This phenomenon approaches its limit in highly curved nanostructures, where extreme charge redistribution and electrostatic modulation result in macroscopic manifestations, such as electronic band offsets, that can be measured. Here, we present the first experimental and theoretical demonstration of giant intrinsic flexoelectricity in graphene nanowrinkles. These nanowrinkles feature a consistent radius of curvature of ~5 Å atop a flat MoS_{2} substrate, where strain gradients, mapped by sub-micron Raman spectroscopy, emerge from mismatched elastic properties between graphene and MoS_{2}. Conductive atomic force microscopy (c-AFM) reveals consistent flexoelectric currents over large-area, dense nanowrinkle networks. The observed asymmetric electromechanical behavior, characterized by a threshold potential ({\Phi}_{th}) of ~1 V, suggests an intrinsic energy barrier to activate a flexoelectric current. This threshold likely arises from combined band alignment effects and strain-induced polarization barriers, which modulate carrier transport at the wrinkle apex. Notably, this behavior aligns with our theoretical band offset predictions (~1.2 V), further supporting flexoelectric dipoles in modifying local electrostatic potential. This represents the strongest manifestations of flexoelectricity in nanostructures with intrinsic polarization densities 10^{5}-10^{7} times greater than meso/micro counterparts yielding P_{th} ~ 4 C/m^{2}, P_{exp} ~ 1 C/m^{2}. This work establishes graphene nanowrinkles as a model system for exploring giant nanoscale flexoelectric effects and highlights their potential for strain-engineered nanoscale electronic and electromechanical devices.

Title: Phase-Coherent Dynamics in Intervalley Coherent States
Authors: Mainak Das, Chunli Huang
Abstract: Electron transport driven by the phase coherence and interference of quantum many-body wavefunctions is a fascinating phenomenon with potential technological significance. Superconductivity, for example, enables dissipationless transport through macroscopic phase twisting. Similarly, in charge-density waves, once the phase degree of freedom-representing the collective position of electrons relative to the lattice-is depinned, it generates characteristic broadband noise and intriguing AC-DC interference patterns. In this work, we point out a phase-coherent transport phenomena in the intervalley coherent (IVC) state, also known as the bond-ordered or Kekule distorted state, frequently reported in rhombohedral multilayer graphene. Under a static magnetic field, the IVC state responds with an oscillating orbital magnetization, inducing an AC Hall effect similar to the AC Josephson effect in superconductors. In this analogy, the magnetic field acts as the DC voltage, while the oscillating magnetization acts as the AC Josephson current. We present detailed microscopic calculations for all the parameters of the phase-number free-energy in rhombohedral trilayer graphene, predicting an oscillation frequency of approximately 12 GHz at 0.1 Tesla. We comment on this phase-coherent transport in twisted homobilayer transition metal dichalcogenides, where the IVC state has been theoretically proposed.

Title: Emergent Hidden Multipolar State in the Triangular Lattice Magnet TmZn2GaO5
Authors: Matthew Ennis, Rabindranath Bag, Tessa Cookmeyer, Matthew B. Stone, Alexander I. Kolesnikov, Tao Hong, Leon Balents, Sara Haravifard
Abstract: TmZn2GaO5 is a newly synthesized triangular lattice magnet that exhibits a unique quantum phase characterized by strong Ising anisotropy, a pseudo-doublet crystal electric field ground state, and a low-energy gapped excitation at the K point. Unlike its well-known counterparts, TmMgGaO4 and YbMgGaO4, this material crystallizes in a distinct hexagonal structure, leading to a cleaner platform for investigating frustrated magnetism. Magnetic susceptibility, heat capacity, and inelastic neutron scattering measurements confirm the absence of long-range magnetic order down to 50 mK, placing TmZn2GaO5 in a distinct region of the transverse-field Ising model phase diagram. Theoretical calculations based on spin-wave theory and mean-field modeling reproduce key experimental observations, reinforcing the material's placement in a quantum disordered/multipolar state. These results highlight its potential for exploring quantum disordered states, anisotropic excitations, and exotic quantum phases in frustrated spin systems.

Title: Dynamical phase transition in the growth of programmable polymorphic materials
Authors: Fan Chen, William M. Jacobs
Abstract: The hallmark feature of polymorphic systems is their ability to assemble into many possible structures at the same thermodynamic state. Designer polymorphic materials can in principle be engineered via programmable self-assembly, but the robustness of the assembly process depends on dynamical factors that are poorly understood. Here we predict a new failure mode for the growth of multicomponent polymorphic materials, in which dynamical coexistence occurs between ordered and disordered assembly trajectories. We show that this transition is preceded by the formation of a steady-state disordered wetting layer, suggesting a nonequilibrium analogy to pre-melting phenomena at equilibrium. This dynamical phase transition is likely to occur in a variety of systems and may fundamentally limit the complexity of polymorphic materials that can be designed through programmable self-assembly.

Title: Infrared Dielectric Function of Photochromic Thiazolothiazole Embedded Polymer
Authors: Nuren Z. Shuchi, Tyler J. Adams, Naz F. Tumpa, Dustin Louisos, Glenn D. Boreman, Michael G. Walter, Tino Hofmann
Abstract: In this paper, the infrared dielectric function of photochromic dipyridinium thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole embedded in polymer is reported. Bulk thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole-embedded polymer samples were prepared by drop casting and dehydration in room temperature. The samples were investigated using spectroscopic ellipsometry before and after irradiation with a 405~nm diode laser in the infrared spectral range from 500 cm-1 to 1800 cm-1. The model dielectric functions of the thiazolothiazole embedded polymer film for its TTz2+ (unirradiated) and TTz0 (irradiated) states are composed of a series of Lorentz oscillators in the measured spectral range. A comparison of the obtained complex dielectric functions for the TTz2+ and TTz0 states shows that the oscillators located in the spectral ranges 500 cm-1 - 700 cm-1, 1300 cm-1 - 1400 cm-1, and 1500 cm-1 - 1700 cm-1 change in both amplitude and resonant frequency upon transition between the states. Additionally, a resonance at approximately 1050 cm-1 exhibited a change in oscillator amplitude but not resonant frequency due to the photochromic transition.

Title: Characterizing the Hyperuniformity of Disordered Network Metamaterials
Authors: Charles Emmett Maher, Katherine A. Newhall
Abstract: Advancements in materials design and manufacturing have allowed for the production of ordered and disordered metamaterials with diverse and novel properties. Hyperuniform two-phase heterogeneous materials, which anomalously suppress density fluctuations on large length scales compared to typical disordered systems, and network materials are two classes of metamaterial that have desirable physical properties. Recent focus has been placed on the design of disordered hyperuniform network metamaterials that inherit the desirable properties of both of these metamaterial classes. In this work, we focus on determining the extent to which network structures derived from the spatial tessellations of hyperuniform point patterns inherit the hyperuniformity of the progenitor point patterns. In particular, we examine the Delaunay, Voronoi, Delaunay-Centroidal, and Gabriel tessellations of nonhyperuniform and hyperuniform point patterns in two- and three-dimensional Euclidean space. We use the spectral density to characterize the density fluctuations of two-phase media created by thickening the edges of these tessellations in two dimensions and introduce a novel variance-based metric to characterize the network structures directly in two and three dimensions. We find that, while none of the tessellations completely inherit the hyperuniformity of the progenitor point pattern, the degree to which the hyperuniformity is inherited is sensitive to the tessellation scheme and the short- and long-range translational disorder in the point pattern, but not to the choice of beam shape when mapping the networks into two-phase media.

Title: Ground states of quasi-two-dimensional correlated systems via energy expansion
Authors: Sam Mardazad, Nicolas Laflorencie, Johannes Motruk, Adrian Kantian
Abstract: We introduce a generic method for computing groundstates that is applicable to a wide range of spatially anisotropic 2D many-body quantum systems. By representing the 2D system using a low-energy 1D basis set, we obtain an effective 1D Hamiltonian that only has quasi-local interactions, at the price of a large local Hilbert space. We apply our new method to three specific 2D systems of weakly coupled chains: hardcore bosons, a spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg Hamiltonian, and spinful fermions with repulsive interactions. In particular, we showcase a non-trivial application of the energy expansion framework, to the anisotropic triangular Heisenberg lattice, a highly challenging model related to 2D spin liquids. Treating lattices of unprecedented size, we provide evidence for the existence of a quasi-1D gapless spin liquid state in this system. We also demonstrate the energy expansion-framework to perform well where external validation is possible. For the fermionic benchmark in particular, we showcase the energy expansion-framework's ability to provide results of comparable quality at a small fraction of the resources required for previous computational efforts.

Title: Towards Interfacing Dark-Field X-ray Microscopy to Dislocation Dynamics Modeling
Authors: Axel Henningsson, Sina Borgi, Grethe Winther, Anter El-Azab, Henning Friis Poulsen
Abstract: Deformation gradient tensor fields are reconstructed in three dimensions (mapping all 9 tensor components) using synthetic Dark-Field X-ray Microscopy data. Owing to the unique properties of the microscope, our results imply that the evolution of deformation fields can now be imaged non-destructively, in situ, and within deeply embedded crystalline elements. The derived regression framework and sampling scheme operate under the kinematic diffraction approximation and are well-suited for studying microstructure evolution during plastic deformation. We derive the deformation conditions under which diffraction vectors extracted from DFXM images can be uniquely associated to the deformation gradient tensor field of the sample. The analysis concludes that the deformation gradient tensor field must vary linearly over line segments defined by the X-ray beam width and the diffracted ray path. The proposed algorithms are validated against numerical simulations for realistic noise levels. Reconstructions of a simulated single straight-edge dislocation show that the Burgers vector components can be recovered with an error of <2%. The mean absolute error of the reconstructed elastic distortion field was found to be <10^-6. By taking the curl of the elastic distortion field, local dislocation densities are derived, yielding a reconstructed dislocation core position with sub-pixel accuracy. The significance of directly measuring the elastic distortion and the dislocation density tensor fields is discussed in the context of continuum theory of dislocations. Such measurements can also be interfaced with continuum dislocation dynamics by providing data that can guide the development and validation, thus extending the relevant models to finite strain regimes.

Title: Superior electrochemical performance of zinc-ion batteries with fine-grained and textured zinc anode produced by high-pressure torsion
Authors: Xinxin Hu, Shivam Dangwal, Xucheng Wang, Fan Zhang, Haijuan Kong, Jun Li, Kaveh Edalati
Abstract: Zinc-ion batteries are promising alternatives to lithium-ion batteries, offering advantages in safety, cost, and environmental impact. However, their performance is often limited by the functioning of the zinc anode. This study employs severe plastic deformation via the high-pressure torsion (HPT) method to enhance the electrochemical performance of zinc anodes. HPT reduced the grain size from >1000 {\mu}m to 20 {\mu}m and introduced a (002) basal texture. The battery assembled with HPT-processed zinc demonstrated improved cycling stability, rate performance, and specific discharge capacity (>500 mAh/g at 0.5 A/g after 50 cycles), particularly at high current densities. This performance enhancement was attributed to grain-boundary and texture effects on improved ion transfer (confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy), fast redox reaction kinetics (confirmed by cyclic voltammetry), and reduced corrosion (confirmed by microscopy and potentiodynamic polarization test). This study highlights the potential of severely deformed materials with textured fine grains for advanced rechargeable battery technologies.

Title: Structure, corrosion resistance and nanomechanical properties of CoCrFeNiX (X=Nb,Mo,B,Si) high entropy alloys
Authors: Rafal Babilas, Jakub Bicz, Adrian Radon, Mariola Kadziolka-Gawel, Dariusz Lukowiec, Krzysztof Matus, Edyta Wyszkowska, Lukasz Kurpaska, Darya Rudomilova, Katarzyna Mlynarek-Zak
Abstract: In this work, the four high entropy CoCrFeNiX alloys (X=Mo,Nb,B,Si) were prepared by induction melting to comparatively analyse their structure, nanomechanical properties, and corrosion resistance in the chloride ion environment. The CoCrFeNiNb and CoCrFeNiMo alloys are composed of FCC solid solution and intermetallic phases (TM)2Nb and Cr-Mo-TM. In the case of the CoCrFeNiB alloy, a complex phase structure was revealed, consisting of FCC solid solution and three types of borides. In turn, the addition of Si substantially altered the phase composition of the CoCrFeNi alloy, resulting in the formation of two intermetallic phases. The corrosion behaviour of the alloys was studied in 3.5 and 5% NaCl solutions. The highest corrosion resistance in both solutions used characterize the CoCrFeNiSi alloy, showing the lowest corrosion current density and the most positive corrosion potential values. For measurements in 5% NaCl solution, icorr and Ecorr were equal to 0.24 microA/cm2 and -0.136 V. Currently, the least favourable corrosion parameters were recorded for the CoCrFeNiMo alloy. The results of EIS measurements confirmed the high protective abilities of passive film formed on the CoCrFeNiSi alloy surface. The highest strength properties were shown by the alloys with the addition of metalloids. For the CoCrFeNiSi alloy, the highest nanohardness value was obtained (above 15 GPa), while the CoCrFeNiB showed the highest Young modulus (above 275 GPa).

Title: Interplay between inversion and translation symmetries in trigonal PtBi$_2$
Authors: Santiago Palumbo, Pablo S. Cornaglia, Jorge I. Facio
Abstract: The trigonal Weyl semimetal PtBi$_2$ presents an intriguing superconducting phase, previously reported to be confined to its topological Fermi arcs within a certain temperature range. This observation highlights the importance of a thorough understanding of its normal phase, particularly the roles that spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and inversion-symmetry breaking play in shaping its band structure. Our density-functional theory calculations reveal that the semimetallic nature of trigonal PtBi$_2$ can be interpreted as stemming from a noncentrosymmetric crystal distortion of a parent structure, that drives a metal to semimetal transition. This distortion breaks inversion symmetry and, crucially, reduces translational symmetry. Due to its interplay with translational symmetry, inversion-symmetry breaking emerges as the dominant energy scale producing substantial asymmetries ($\sim$ 0.6\,eV) in certain short-range hopping amplitudes, superseding the effects of SOC, whose primary role is to define the characteristics of the low-energy nodal structure. This also applies to the formation of the Weyl nodes closest to the Fermi energy, which are found to exist even in the absence of SOC as a result of the orbital physics associated with the reduced translational symmetry.

Title: Many-body Localization in a Slowly Varying Potential
Authors: Zi-Jian Li, Yi-Ting Tu, Sankar Das Sarma
Abstract: We study many-body localization (MBL) in a nearest-neighbor hopping 1D lattice with a slowly varying (SV) on-site potential $U_j = \lambda\cos(\pi\alpha j^s)$ with $0<s<1$. The corresponding non-interacting 1D lattice model is known to have single-particle localization with mobility edges. Using exact diagonalization, we find that the MBL of this model has similar features to the conventional MBL of extensively studied random or quasiperiodic (QP) models, including the transitions of eigenstate entanglement entropy (EE) and level statistics, and the logarithmic growth of EE. To further investigate the universal properties of this MBL transition in the asymptotic regime, we implement a real-space renormalization group (RG) method. RG analysis shows a subvolume scaling $\sim L^{d_{\rm MBL}}$ with $d_{\rm MBL} \approx 1-s$ of the localization length (length of the largest thermal clusters) in this MBL phase. In addition, we explore the critical properties and find universal scalings of the EE and localization length. From these quantities, we compute the critical exponent $\nu$ using different parameters $s$ (characterizing different degrees of spatial variation of the imposed potential), finding the critical exponent staying around $\nu\approx2$. This exponent $\nu \approx 2$ is close to that of the QP model within the error bars but differs from the random model. This observation suggests that the SV model and the QP model may belong to the same universality class, which is, however, likely distinct from the random universality class.

Title: Growth of uniform helium submonolayers adsorbed on single-surface graphite observed by surface X-ray diffraction
Authors: Atsuki Kumashita, Hiroo Tajiri, Jun Usami, Yu Yamane, Shigeki Miyasaka, Hiroshi Fukuyama, Akira Yamaguchi
Abstract: We observed surface X-ray diffraction from He-4 submonolayers adsorbed on a single-surface graphite using synchrotron X-rays. Time evolutions of scattering intensities along the crystal truncation rod (CTR) were observed even after reaching the base low temperature in a selected condition of sample preparation. Our simulations for CTR scatterings based on the random double-layer model, in which helium atoms are distributed randomly in the first and second layers with a certain occupancy ratio, can consistently explain the observed intensity changes. These results support the scenario that He atoms are stratified initially as a nonequilibrium state and then relaxed into a uniform monolayer by surface diffusion, where the relaxation process was observed as a decrease in CTR scattering intensity. The observed time constant was, however, much longer than those estimated from quantum and thermal surface diffusions. This implies homogeneous processes in surface diffusions were strongly suppressed by local potentials in such as atomic steps or microcrystalline boundaries.

Title: Optically Controlled Topological Phases in the Deformed $α$-$% T_{3}$ Lattice
Authors: Othmane Benhaida, Saidi El Hassan, L. B. Drissi
Abstract: Haldane's tight-binding model, which describes a Chern insulator in a two-dimensional hexagonal lattice, exhibits quantum Hall conductivity without an external magnetic field. Here, we explore an $\alpha -T_{3}$ lattice subjected to circularly polarized off-resonance light. This lattice, composed of two sublattices (A and B) and a central site (C) per unit cell, undergoes deformation by varying the hopping parameter $\gamma _{1}$ while keeping $\gamma _{2}$= $\gamma _{3}$= $\gamma $. Analytical expressions for quasi-energies in the first Brillouin zone reveal significant effects of symmetry breaking. Circularly polarized light lifts the degeneracy of Dirac points, shifting the cones from M. This deformation evolves with $\gamma _{1} $, breaking symmetry at $\gamma _{1}=2\gamma $, as observed in Berry curvature diagrams. In the standard case ($\gamma _{1}=\gamma $), particle-hole and inversion symmetries are preserved for $\alpha =0$ and $% \alpha =1$. The system transitions from a semi-metal to a Chern insulator, with band-specific Chern numbers: $C_{2}=1$, $C_{1}=0$, and $C_{0}=-1$ for $% \alpha <1/\sqrt{2},$ shifting to $C_{2}=2$, $C_{1}=0$, and $C_{0}=-2$ when $% \alpha \geqslant 1/\sqrt{2}.$For $\gamma _{1}>2\gamma $, the system enters a trivial insulating phase. These transitions, confirmed via Wannier charge centers, are accompanied by a diminishing Hall conductivity. Our findings highlight tunable topological phases in $\alpha -T_{3}$ lattices, driven by light and structural deformation, with promising implications for quantum materials.

Title: Spin-Polarized Antiferromagnetic Spintronics
Authors: Zhenzhou Guo, Xiaotian Wang, Wenhong Wang, Gang Zhang, Xiaodong Zhou, Zhenxiang Cheng
Abstract: Spin-polarized antiferromagnets (AFMs), including altermagnets, noncollinear AFMs, and two-dimensional layer-polarized AFMs, have emerged as transformative materials for next-generation spintronic and optoelectronic technologies. These systems uniquely combine spin-polarized electronic states with vanishing net magnetization, enabling ultrafast spin dynamics, high-density integration, and robustness against stray magnetic fields. Their unconventional symmetry-breaking mechanisms-governed by crystal symmetry, chiral spin textures, or interlayer potential control-give rise to emergent phenomena previously exclusive to ferromagnets: nonrelativistic spin-momentum locking, spontaneous anomalous transport phenomena, gate-tunable magneto-optical responses, and nonrelativistic spin-polarized current. This review systematically examines the fundamental principles linking symmetry, band topology, and transport properties across these material classes, synthesizing recent breakthroughs in both theory and experiment. We further identify critical challenges in achieving room-temperature functionality, scalable Neel vector control, and coherent spin-current manipulation, while outlining pathways to harness these materials for ultra-low-power memory, spin-logic architectures, and quantum information technologies.

Title: First-Principles Investigation of Auxetic Piezoelectric Effect in Nitride Perovskites
Authors: Yanting Peng, Zunyi Deng, Siyu Song, Gang Tang, Jiawang Hong
Abstract: The recently reported auxetic piezoelectric effect, which acts as the electrical counterpart of the negative Poisson's ratio, is of significant technical importance for applications in acoustic wave devices. However, this electric auxetic effect has not yet been reported in perovskite systems. In this work, we employ first-principles calculations to investigate the piezoelectric properties of six polar nitride perovskites with the chemical formula ABN3 (A = La, Sc, Y; B = W, Mo). Among these, all compounds except ScMoN3 exhibit the auxetic piezoelectric effect, which is characterized by an unusually positive transverse piezoelectric coefficient, along with a positive longitudinal piezoelectric coefficient. This behavior is in sharp contrast to previously reported results in HfO2, where both the longitudinal and transverse piezoelectric coefficients are negative. These unusual positive transverse piezoelectric coefficients originate from the domination of the positive internal-strain contribution. We further confirm the auxetic piezoelectric effect with finite electric field calculations. Our research enriches the understanding of the piezoelectric properties of nitride perovskites and provides a new compositional space for the design of novel auxetic piezoelectric materials.

Title: Non-resonant inter-species interaction and its effect on the position response function of cold atoms
Authors: Anirban Misra, Urbashi Satpathi, Supurna Sinha, Sanjukta Roy, Saptarishi Chaudhuri
Abstract: In the context of non-equilibrium statistical physics, the position response of a particle, coupled to a bath, subjected to an external force is a topic of broad interest. A topic of further interest is two distinguishable sets of interacting particles in contact with two different baths. Here, we report the experimental evidence of the modification of the position response function (PRF) of an ensemble of cold atoms in a magneto-optical trap when it is placed alongside a dilute cloud of cold atoms of a different species. Our experiment consists of a mass-imbalanced cold atomic mixture of Potassium and Sodium atoms. We focus on the position response of Potassium atoms when subjected to a sudden displacement in the presence of a cold Sodium atomic cloud. Notably, we find that, in the underdamped regime of motion, the oscillation frequency of motion of the cold atoms changes as much as 30 $\%$ depending on the effective inter-species light-assisted interaction strength. On the other hand, in the overdamped regime, there is a reduction, as high as 10.5 $\%$ in the damping coefficient, depending on the interaction strength. Using a quantum Langevin approach, we develop a framework that aligns well with experimental results, with potential applications in mass and charge transport studies under varied physical conditions simulated in cold atoms.

Title: Static and hydrodynamic periodic structures induced by AC electric fields in the antiferroelectric SmZA phase
Authors: K. S. Krishnamurthy, S. Krishna Prasad, D. S. Shankar Rao, R. J. Mandle, C. J. Gibb, J. Hobbs, N. V. Madhusudana
Abstract: We report the effect of AC electric fields in the range of 0.1-300 kHz on planar antiferroelectric SmZA layers of DIO. Significant results are (a) primary bifurcation into a quasistationary periodic instability with its voltage threshold Uc and wave vector qc along the initial director being, respectively, quadratic and linear functions of f over 10-150 kHz, and with an azimuthal distortion of the director which changes sign between adjacent stripes, (b) transition from the modulated planar state to a homogeneous state at higher voltages, and (c) third bifurcation into travelling wave periodic state on further rise in U in the region 10-40 kHz. We interpret these findings as follows. The low voltage instability is very similar to that seen in the higher temperature apolar nematic phase, and is the electrohydrodynamic (EHD) instability possibly belonging to the region of dielectric inversion frequency. The azimuthal distortions of n result from an undulatory distortion of the SmZA layers in the book-shelf geometry. The intermediate homogeneous state of SmZA in which the periodic structure is absent results from a linear coupling between the layer polarization P and applied field E, giving rise to a scissoring type mutual P reorientation in adjacent layers. Finally, at even higher voltages, the medium goes over to a field induced transition to the ferroelectric nematic, with the polarization following the AC field, and the periodic EHD instability being similar to that of the dielectric regime. The polar vector symmetry of the medium leads in general to travelling waves.

Title: Host dependence of PL5 ensemble in 4H-SiC
Authors: Jiajun Li, Hui Qi, Feifei Zhou, Yumeng Song, Nanyang Xu, Bo Hong, Hongwei Chen, Ying Dong, Xinqing Wang
Abstract: Color center PL5 in 4H silicon carbide (4H-SiC) has drawn significant attention due to its room-temperature quantum coherence properties and promising potential of quantum sensing applications. The preparation of PL5 ensemble is a critical prerequisite for practical applications. In this work, we investigated the formation of PL5 ensembles in types of 4H-SiC wafers, focusing on their suitability as hosts for PL5 ensemble. Results demonstrate that PL5 signals are exclusively observed in high-purity semi-insulating (HPSI) substrates, whereas divacancies PL1-PL4 can be detected in both HPSI and epitaxial samples. The type of in-plane stress in HPSI and epitaxial hosts is compressive in the same order of magnitude. Defects like stacking faults and dislocations are not observed simultaneously in the PL5 ensemble. Notably, the PL5 ensemble exhibits a relatively uniform distribution in the HPSI host, highlighting its readiness for integration into quantum sensing platforms. Furthermore, signal of PL5 can always be detected in the HPSI samples with different doses of electron irradiation, which suggests that HPSI wafers are more suitable hosts for the production of PL5 ensemble. This work provides critical insights into the material-specific requirements for PL5 ensemble formation and advances the development of 4H-SiC-based quantum technologies.

Title: Low-energy excitations in multiple modulation-doped CdTe/(CdMg)Te quantum wells
Authors: D. Yavorskiy, F. Le Mardelé, I. Mohelsky, M. Orlita, Z. Adamus, T. Wojtowicz, J. Wróbel, K. Karpierz, J. Łusakowski
Abstract: Low energy excitations of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in modulation-doped multiple (ten) quantum wells (QWs) was studied using far-infrared magneto-transmission technique at liquid helium temperatures. A large distance between neighbouring QWs of 54 nm excluded a direct interaction of electron wave functions confined in the wells. In four samples which differed in the spacer width and the level of doping with iodine donors, supplied with a metallic grid coupler, a uniform picture of exitations of the 2DEG was observed. These involved the cyclotron resonance (CR), its second harmonic (2CR) and magnetoplasmon modes (MPMs). MPMs with a small amplitude originated from excitations of the 2DEG in a single QW and these with a high amplitude resulted from a coherent excitation of the 2DEG in all wells. A polaron effect resulting from the interaction of the CR, 2CR and MPMs with an optical phonon was observed and discribed with appropriate models. Both types of MPMs exhibited gaps in the disperion relations at the frequency close to the 2CR, leading to Bernstein modes, which was discribed with an appropriate (non-local) theoretical model.

Title: Strain distribution in GaN/AlN superlattices grown on AlN/sapphire templates: comparison of X-ray diffraction and photoluminescence studies
Authors: Aleksandra Wierzbicka, Agata Kaminska, Kamil Sobczak, Dawid Jankowski, Kamil Koronski, Pawel Strak, Marta Sobanska, Zbigniew R. Zytkiewicz
Abstract: Series of GaN/AlN superlattices (SLs) with various periods and the same thicknesses of GaN quantum wells and AlN barriers have been investigated. X-ray diffraction, photoluminescence (PL) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques were used to study the influence of thickness of AlN and GaN sublayers on strain distribution in GaN/AlN SL structures. Detailed X-ray diffraction measurements demonstrate that the strain occurring in SLs generally decreases with an increase of well/barrier thickness. Fitting of X-ray diffraction curves allowed determining the real thicknesses of the GaN wells and AlN barriers. Since blurring of the interfaces causes deviation of calculated data from experimental results the quality of the interfaces has been evaluated as well and compared with results of TEM measurements. For the samples with thinner wells/barriers the presence of pin-holes and threading dislocations has been observed in TEM measurements. The best quality of interfaces has been found for the sample with a well/barrier thickness of 3 nm. Finally, PL spectra showed that due to Quantum-Confined Stark Effect the PL peak energies of the SLs decreased with increasing the width of the GaN quantum wells and AlN barriers. The effect is well modelled by ab initio calculations based on the density functional theory applied for tetragonally strained structures of the same geometry using a full tensorial representation of the strain in the SLs.

Title: Bond-dependent interactions and ill-ordered state in the honeycomb cobaltate BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$

Abstract: The ground state and Hamiltonian of the honeycomb lattice material BaCo$_{2}$(AsO$_{4}$)$_{2}$ hosting magnetic Co$^{2+}$, have been debated for decades. The recent proposal for anisotropic bond-dependent interactions in such honeycomb cobaltates has raised the prospect of revisiting its Hamiltonian in the context of Kitaev physics. To test this hypothesis, we have combined magnetization, ac-susceptibility and neutron scattering measurements on a BaCo$_{2}$(AsO$_{4}$)$_{2}$ single-crystal, together with advanced modeling. Our experimental results highlight a collinear magnetic ground state with intrinsic disorder associated to an average incommensurate propagation vector. Monte Carlo simulations and linear spin wave calculations were performed to obtain a spin model compatible with this unusual ground state, the dispersion of magnetic excitations and a magnetization plateau under magnetic field. We thus show that bond-dependent anisotropic interactions, including Kitaev-like interactions, are necessary to account for the puzzling properties of this long-explored material, and are hence a general ingredient in the cobaltates.

Title: Theory of polarization-dependent phonon pumping in ferromagnetic/non-magnetic bilayers
Authors: Mikhail Cherkasskii, Fabian Engelhardt, Manuel Müller, Johannes Weber, Matthias Althammer, Sebastian T. B. Goennenwein, Hans Huebl, Silvia Viola Kusminskiy
Abstract: We develop a theoretical model for polarization-selective phonon pumping induced by magnon-phonon coupling in a ferromagnetic/non-magnetic acoustic bilayer structure, focusing on the effects arising from a misalignment between the magnetic and crystallographic symmetry axes. Our model considers the coupled equations of motion describing uniform magnetization dynamics (the Kittel mode) and elastic waves in both layers, incorporating phonon pumping and boundary conditions at the interface. We show that even small misalignments lift the degeneracy of transverse shear elastic modes, resulting in phononic birefringence characterized by distinct propagation velocities for linearly polarized modes. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that magnon-phonon hybridization gives magnetic-field-dependent properties to otherwise non-magnetic phonons. We show that the polarization transfer between linearly polarized phonons and the circularly polarized Kittel mode can be tuned with an external magnetic field. Our theoretical results quantitatively reproduce recent experimental findings [1].

Authors: Taras Demchuk, Tymofii Nikolaienko, Aniruddha Panda, Subodh Madhav Joshi, Stanislav Jaso, Kaushic Kalyanaraman
Abstract: This study introduces a physics-informed machine learning framework to accelerate the computation of the microkinetic model of Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. A neural network, trained within the NVIDIA Modulus framework, approximates the fraction of vacant catalytic sites with high accuracy. The combination of implicit differentiation and the Newton-Raphson method enhances derivative calculations, ensuring physical consistency. Computational efficiency improves significantly, with speedups up to $ 10^4 $ times on a GPU. This versatile methodology generalizes across catalysts and reactors, offering a robust tool for chemical engineering applications, including model approximation and catalyst parameter fitting from experimental data.

Title: Quantum transport in SnTe nanowire devices

Abstract: We report on a variety of quantum transport experiments in SnTe nanowire devices. Research on these particular nanowire devices is relevant because of their topological properties and their potential to distinguish surface states owing to their high surface-to-volume ratio that suppresses the bulk contribution to the conductance. We observe a low-resistance and a high-resistance regime. The highly resistive devices display semiconducting and quantum dot behavior caused by microscopic differences in the fabrication, while devices with low resistance show partial superconductivity when in a hybrid superconductor-nanowire configuration or Fabry-Pérot oscillations. The latter suggests quantum interference in a ballistic transport channel, attributed to the 2D surface states in SnTe. The wide variety of quantum transport phenomena demonstrate SnTe nanowires as a promising platform for diverse follow-up experiments and novel device architectures, including the exploration of topological superconductivity and the development of low-energy spintronic devices.

Title: Inertia-induced mechanism for giant enhancement of transport generated by active fluctuations
Authors: K. Białas, J. Spiechowicz
Abstract: Active matter is one of the hottest topics in physics nowadays. As a prototype of living systems operating in viscous environments it has usually been modeled in terms of the overdamped dynamics. Recently, active matter in the underdamped regime has gained a place in the spotlight. In this work we unveil another remarkable face of active matter. In doing so we demonstrate and explain an inertia-induced mechanism of giant enhancement of transport driven by active fluctuations which does emerge neither in the overdamped nor in the underdamped limit but occurs exclusively in the strong damping regime. It may be relevant not only for living systems where fluctuations generated by the metabolism are active by default but also for artificial ones, in particular for designing ultrafast micro and nano-robots. Our findings open new avenues of research in a very vibrant field of active matter.

Title: Uncertainty Quantification in Multiscale Models of Charge Transport in Organic Semiconductors: Influence of the Exhange-Correlation Functional
Authors: Zhongquan Chen, Pim van der Hoorn, Bjoern Baumeier
Abstract: This study investigates the impact of exchange-correlation functional choices on the predictive accuracy of multiscale models for charge transport in organic semiconductors (OSCs). A hybrid functional approach is applied to analyze uncertainties in key parameters influencing charge mobility, focusing on the Hartree--Fock exchange fraction. Using 2-methyl-9,10-bis(naphthalen-2-yl)anthracene (MADN) as a test system, molecular dynamics and density functional theory are combined to compute reorganization energies, site energies, and electronic coupling elements. Monte Carlo sampling quantifies the uncertainty propagation, revealing that site energy variations dominate transport property uncertainties, while coupling elements contribute minimally. The findings underscore the need for accurate parameter determination and functional selection, with implications for enhancing the reliability of first-principles-based multiscale modeling frameworks in OSC design.

Title: Thermodynamic anomalies in overdamped systems with time-dependent temperature
Authors: Shakul Awasthi, Hyunggyu Park, Jae Sung Lee
Abstract: One of the key objectives in investigating small stochastic systems is the development of micrometer-sized engines and the understanding of their thermodynamics. However, the primary mathematical tool used for this purpose, the overdamped approximation, has a critical limitation: it fails to fully capture the thermodynamics when the temperature varies over time, as the velocity is not considered in the approximation. Specifically, we show that heat dissipation and entropy production calculated under the overdamped approximation deviate from their true values. These discrepancies are termed thermodynamic anomalies. To overcome this limitation, we analytically derive expressions for these anomalies in the presence of a general time-varying temperature. One notable feature of the result is that high viscosity and small mass, though both leading to the same overdamped dynamic equations, result in different thermodynamic anomaly relations. Our results have significant implications, particularly for accurately calculating the efficiency of heat engines operating in overdamped environments with time-varying temperatures, without requiring velocity measurements. Additionally, our findings offer a simple method for estimating the kinetic energy of an overdamped system.

Title: A Morphotropic Phase Boundary in MA$_{1-x}$FA$_x$PbI$_3$: Linking Structure, Dynamics, and Electronic Properties
Authors: Tobias Hainer, Erik Fransson, Sangita Dutta, Julia Wiktor, Paul Erhart
Abstract: Understanding the phase behavior of mixed-cation halide perovskites is critical for optimizing their structural stability and optoelectronic performance. Here, we map the phase diagram of MA$_{1-x}$FA$_x$PbI$_3$ using a machine-learned interatomic potential in molecular dynamics simulations. We identify a morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) at approximately 27% FA content, delineating the transition between out-of-phase and in-phase octahedral tilt patterns. Phonon mode projections reveal that this transition coincides with a mode crossover composition, where the free energy landscapes of the M and R phonon modes become nearly degenerate. This results in nanoscale layered structures with alternating tilt patterns, suggesting minimal interface energy between competing phases. Our results provide a systematic and consistent description of this important system, complementing earlier partial and sometimes conflicting experimental assessments. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations show that band edge fluctuations peak near the MPB, indicating an enhancement of electron-phonon coupling and dynamic disorder effects. These findings establish a direct link between phonon dynamics, phase behavior, and electronic structure, providing a further composition-driven pathway for tailoring the optoelectronic properties of perovskite materials. By demonstrating that phonon overdamping serves as a hallmark of the MPB, our study offers new insights into the design principles for stable, high-performance perovskite solar cells.

Title: Insights on the role of the covalent Ni-O bonds in LiNiO2 positive electrodes: A combined hard X-ray spectroscopy study
Authors: Jazer Jose H. Togonon, Jean-Noel Chotard, Alessandro Longo, Lorenzo Stievano, Laurence Croguennec, Antonella Iadecola
Abstract: The interest in Ni-rich layered oxide positive electrode materials has been increasing due to its wide applicability particularly in electric vehicles as high capacity and high energy density electrode materials. However, the Ni-O bond array which builds the overall framework and plays a critical role in the charge compensation mechanism of the material requires deeper understanding. This work presents a correlative approach elucidating the role of the local highly covalent Ni-O bonds in LiNiO2 (LNO) model material. Pristine and electrochemically obtained LNO positive electrodes are analyzed using ex situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) to compare the average and local structural evolution upon Li+ ion de-intercalation. Insights from Ni K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and non-resonant Ni Kbeta X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) spectra are combined to track the electronic environment of Ni. X-ray Raman scattering (XRS) spectra at the Ni L2,3-edges and O K-edge provide direct bulk electronic information with regards to the interplay between Ni 3d and O 2p states. The overall findings imply that O plays a significant role in the charge compensation process, contributing to the substantial negative charge transfer from the O 2p orbitals, because of the covalency in the Ni-O bonds inside the NiO2 framework within the edge-sharing NiO6 octahedra. The utilization of complementary X-ray spectroscopy techniques clarifies the intricate electronic environment of LNO, which is helpful in understanding Ni-rich positive electrode materials and offering new insights into their covalent nature.

Title: Observation of quasi bound states in open quantum wells of cesiated p-doped GaN surfaces
Authors: Mylène Sauty, Jean-Philippe Banon, Nicolas M. S. Lopes, Tanay Tak, James S. Speck, Claude Weisbuch, Jacques Peretti
Abstract: The quantized electron states in the downward band bending region (BBR) at the surface of cesiated p-type GaN are investigated. We theoretically predict the existence of metastable resonant states in the BBR with an intrinsic life-time around 20 fs. Their experimental observation requires access to the empty conduction band of the cesiated semiconductor, which is possible with near-bandgap photoemission spectroscopy. The energy distribution of the photoemitted electrons shows contributions coming from electrons accumulated into the resonant states at energies which agree with calculations.

Title: Strain induced stabilization of high symmetry phase in MAPbBr3 perovskite
Authors: Shankar Dutt, Joydipto Bhattacharya, Kailash Kumar, Rajashri Urkude, Pankaj R. Sagdeo, Archna Sagdeo
Abstract: Structural phase transitions in the organic inorganic metal halide perovskites are driven via rearrangement of methylammonium cation and distortion in the PbX6 octahedra. Compositional tuning is usually incorporated for suppression of the structural phase transition in these systems with cation or anion tuning. Along with the compositional tuning, behaviour of strain present in the system can also lead to stabilization of single phase in these systems. In the present investigation, two different samples of CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskite were studied and it is observed that structural phase transition is absent for one of the sample while it is present in the other sample. The non-observance of structural phase transition and stabilization of single phase has been attributed to the perceived tensile strain in the system contrary to the compressive strain observed in the system showing structural phase transitions. This observation is further supported by theoretical calculations. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure measurements revealed distorted octahedra with varying bond lengths along planar and axial directions in both samples, along with observed increase in bond lengths in one of the sample. This stabilization of the cubic phase can enhance device performance and increase overall environmental stability, making these systems more effective for practical applications.

Title: The Hungry Daemon: An energy-harvesting active particle must obey the Second Law of Thermodynamics
Authors: Simon Bienewald, Diego Marcel Fieguth, James R. Anglin
Abstract: Thought experiments like Maxwell's Demon or the Feynman-Smoluchowski Ratchet can help in pursuing the microscopic origin of the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Here we present a more sophisticated physical system than a ratchet, consisting of a Hamiltonian active particle which can harvest energy from an environment which may be in thermal equilibrium at a single temperature. We show that while a phenomenological description would seem to allow the system to operate as a Perpetual Motion Machine of the Second Kind, a full mechanical analysis confirms that this is impossible, and that perpetual energy harvesting can only occur if the environment has an energetic population inversion similar to a lasing medium.

Title: Quantitative characterization of hydrophobic agglomeration at different mixing intensities using a copula-based probabilistic modeling approach
Authors: Niklas Eiermann, Orkun Furat, Jan Nicklas, Urs A. Peuker, Volker Schmidt
Abstract: The agglomeration of small poorly wetted alumina particles in a stirred tank is investigated. For different experimental conditions, two bivariate probability densities for the area-equivalent diameter and aspect ratio of primary particles and agglomerates, respectively, are determined, using 2D image data from an inline camera system. Throughout each experiment, these densities do not change since the geometries of primary particles are unaffected by the experimental conditions, while large agglomerates fragment into multiple smaller ones, which results in an equilibrium state regarding the distribution of agglomerate descriptors. Mixtures of these densities are used to model the contents of the stirred tank at each time step of the experiments. Analytical functions, whose parameters characterize the agglomeration dynamics, are fitted to the time-dependent weights of these mixtures. This enables a quantitative comparison of agglomeration processes, highlighting the impact of mixing intensity on the joint distribution of agglomerate descriptors.

Title: Magnetic Resonance Particle Tracking
Authors: Mathieu Suter, Jens P. Metzger, Andreas Port, Christoph R. Müller, Klaas P. Pruessmann
Abstract: Granular materials such as gravel, cereals, or pellets, are ubiquitous in nature, daily life, and industry. While sharing some characteristics with gases, liquids, and solids, granular matter exhibits a wealth of phenomena that defy these analogies and are yet to be fully understood. Advancing granular physics requires experimental observation at the level of individual particles and over a wide range of dynamics. Specifically, it calls for the ability to track large numbers of particles simultaneously, in three dimensions (3D), and with high spatial and temporal resolution. Here, we introduce magnetic resonance particle tracking (MRPT) and show it to achieve such recording with resolution on the scale of micrometers and milliseconds. Enabled by MRPT, we report the direct study of granular glassy dynamics in 3D. Tracking a vibrated granular system over six temporal orders of magnitude revealed dynamical heterogeneities, two-step relaxation, and structural memory closely akin to 3D glass formation in supercooled liquids and colloids. These findings illustrate broad prospective utility of MRPT in advancing the exploration, theory, and numerical models of granular matter.

Abstract: CeO$_x$-based nanoforms are widely used in catalysis, or biomedical applications due to their redox activity and oxygen storage capacity. The key parameters determining their surface chemistry are the Ce$^{3+}$/Ce$^{4+}$ ratio and the ability to transition between Ce$^{4+}$ and Ce$^{3+}$ states. We synthesized Au@CeO$_x$ core@shell nanoparticles with different thicknesses of CeO$_x$ shells and different Ce$^{3+}$/Ce$^{4+}$ ratios through a photothermal reaction driven by localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) at the Au nanoparticle surface induced by visible light. We introduce a way to further enhance the Ce$^{3+}$/Ce$^{4+}$ ratio in the shell by exposing the Au@CeO$_x$ nanoparticles to visible light using a green laser (532 nm, 50 mW). Our findings based on photoelectron spectroscopy indicate that the Ce$^{4+}$-to-Ce$^{3+}$ transition results from LSPR-induced superheating of the Au@CeO$_x$ interface, leading to the formation of oxygen vacancies and reduction of Ce$^{4+}$ ions. This process is reversible upon air exposure suggesting that the ability to transition between the Ce$^{4+}$ and Ce$^{3+}$ states is retained in the Au@CeO$_x$ nanoparticles. Our study presents the CeO$_x$-based nanoforms with a tunable cerium valence state ratio, highlighting the potential of plasmonic control in optimizing their photocatalytic and enzyme-mimetic properties.

Title: Spontaneous symmetry breaking with type-B Goldstone modes in the SO($2s+1$) ferromagnetic model: an entanglement perspective
Authors: Qian-Qian Shi, Huan-Qiang Zhou, Murray T. Batchelor, Ian P. McCulloch
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking with type-B Goldstone modes is investigated in the SO($2s+1$) ferromagnetic model. A set of orthonormal basis states in the ground state subspace are constructed, which admit an exact Schmidt decomposition, exposing self-similarities in real space of an abstract fractal underlying the ground state subspace. Focusing on the SO(5) and the SO(6) ferromagnetic spin chains as illustrative examples, finite system-size scaling analysis of the entanglement entropy for this set of orthonormal basis states confirms that the entanglement entropy scales logarithmically with block size in the thermodynamic limit. The prefactor in front of the logarithm is half the number of type-B Goldstone modes $N_B$, which is identified as the fractal dimension $d_f$ for these orthonormal basis states. For the SO($2s+1$) ferromagnetic model $N_B = d_f =s$ for integer $s$ and $N_B = d_f =s+1/2$ for half-odd-integer $s$.

Abstract: Over the past two decades, 2D materials have rapidly evolved into a diverse and expanding family of material platforms. Many members of this materials class have demonstrated their potential to deliver transformative impact on fundamental research and technological applications across different fields. In this roadmap, we provide an overview of the key aspects of 2D material research and development, spanning synthesis, properties and commercial applications. We specifically present roadmaps for high impact 2D materials, including graphene and its derivatives, transition metal dichalcogenides, MXenes as well as their heterostructures and moiré systems. The discussions are organized into thematic sections covering emerging research areas (e.g., twisted electronics, moiré nano-optoelectronics, polaritronics, quantum photonics, and neuromorphic computing), breakthrough applications in key technologies (e.g., 2D transistors, energy storage, electrocatalysis, filtration and separation, thermal management, flexible electronics, sensing, electromagnetic interference shielding, and composites) and other important topics (computational discovery of novel materials, commercialization and standardization). This roadmap focuses on the current research landscape, future challenges and scientific and technological advances required to address, with the intent to provide useful references for promoting the development of 2D materials.

Title: Enhanced superconductivity in LaRu3Si2 by chemical pressure tuning of kagome flat bands
Authors: Ryo Misawa, Markus Kriener, Rinsuke Yamada, Ryota Nakano, Milena Jovanovic, Leslie M. Schoop, Max Hirschberger
Abstract: In kagome metals, flat bands induced by frustrated hopping serve as a platform for strong electronic correlation, while often exhibiting substantial dispersion along the $k_z$ direction due to interlayer coupling. Here, we investigate the superconductivity of the kagome metal LaRu$_3$(Si$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$)$_2$ by chemical pressure tuning while preserving the Ru-$4d$ states that constitute the kagome flat bands. We observe a sizable enhancement in the density of states up to $x = 0.07$, as determined by the specific heat, with a concomitant increase in the superconducting transition temperature. As supported by our first-principles calculations, the lattice expansion along the $c$-axis by chemical pressure mitigates a detrimental effect of hybridization between kagome layers, thereby reinforcing the three-dimensional localization of flat-band electrons. Providing evidence for LaRu$_3$Si$_2$ as a flat-band hosting superconductor, we demonstrate a simple, yet effective, route to engineer flat bands by uniaxial lattice expansion.

Title: Charge creation via quantum tunneling in one-dimensional Mott insulators: A numerical study of the extended Hubbard model
Authors: Thomas Hansen, Lars Bojer Madsen, Yuta Murakami
Abstract: Charge creation via quantum tunneling, i.e. dielectric breakdown, is one of the most fundamental and significant phenomena arising from strong light(field)-matter coupling. In this work, we conduct a systematic numerical analysis of quantum tunneling in one-dimensional Mott insulators described by the extended ($U$-$V$) Hubbard model. We discuss the applicability of the analytical formula for doublon-holon (DH) pair production, previously derived for the one-dimensional Hubbard model, which highlights the relationship between the tunneling threshold, the charge gap, and the correlation length. We test the formulas ability to predict both DH pair production and energy increase rate. Using tensor-network-based approaches, we demonstrate that the formula provides accurate predictions in the absence of excitonic states facilitated by the nearest-neighbor interaction $V$. However, when excitonic states emerge, the formula more accurately describes the rate of energy increase than the DH pair creation rate and in both cases gets improved by incorporating the exciton energy as the effective gap.

Title: Magnon-mediated terahertz spin transport in metallic Gd|Pt stacks
Authors: Oliver Gueckstock, Tim Amrhein, Beatrice Andres, Pilar Jiménez-Cavero, Cornelius Gahl, Tom S. Seifert, Reza Rouzegar, Ilie Radu, Irene Lucas, Marko Wietstruk, Luis Morellón, Martin Weinelt, Tobias Kampfrath, Nele Thielemann-Kühn
Abstract: We study femtosecond spin transport in a Gd|Pt stack induced by a laser pulse. Remarkably, the dynamics of the spin current from Gd to Pt suggests that its dominant driving force is the ultrafast spin Seebeck effect. As the contribution of a transient spin voltage in the metal Gd is minor, Gd acts akin a magnetic insulator here. This view is supported by time- and spin-resolved photoemission, which indicates that a buildup of spin voltage is suppressed by exchange scattering, leading to similar amplitudes and relaxation rates of hot majority- and minority-spin electron populations.

Title: Nanomolding single-crystalline CoIn3 and RhIn3 nanowires
Authors: Nghiep Khoan Duong, Christian D. Multunas, Thomas Whoriskey, Mehrdad T. Kiani, Shanta R. Saha, Quynh P. Sam, Han Wang, Satya Kushwaha, Johnpierre Paglione, Ravishankar Sundararaman, Judy J. Cha
Abstract: Intermetallic compounds containing transition metals and group III-V metals tend to possess strong correlations and high catalytic activities, both of which can be enhanced via reduced dimensionality. Nanostructuring is an effective approach to explore this possibility, yet the synthesis of nanostructured intermetallics is challenging due to vast differences in melting points and vapor pressures of the constituent elements. In this work, we demonstrate that this challenge can be overcome with thermomechanical nanomolding (TMNM), exemplified by the synthesis of intermetallic CoIn3 and RhIn3 nanowires. We show that TMNM successfully extrudes single-crystalline nanowires of these compounds down to the 20 nm diameter range, and the nanowires remain metallic with resistivity values higher than calculated bulk resistivity. We discuss possible effects of surface roughness scattering, vacancy-induced scattering, and surface oxidation, on the measured resistivities of the nanowires. For CoIn3 nanowires, the measured resistivity values are the first reported values for this compound.

Title: Cracking Down on Fracture to Functionalise Damage
Authors: Leo de Waal, Matthaios Chouzouris, Marcelo A. Dias
Abstract: In this work we propose a novel relationship between topology and damage propagation in Maxwell lattices that redefines fracture as a functional design feature rather than mere degradation. We demonstrate that topologically protected modes, inherently robust against perturbations, localise along lattice discontinuities and govern the mechanical response. By precisely engineering the microstructure, we direct these modes to control stress distributions and trigger predictable, controlled damage. Our findings -- validated through comprehensive numerical simulations and experiments -- advance our understanding of nontrivial mechanical responses in Maxwell lattices and establish a clear framework for designing materials with improved fracture energy. This work paves the way for further exploration of topology-driven phenomena in mechanical systems and promises a new direction in the design of robust materials.

Title: Single-laser pulse toggle switching in CoHo and CoDy single layer alloys : when domain wall motion matters
Authors: B. Kunyangyuen, G. Malinowski, D. Lacour, J.-X. Lin, Y. Le Guen, L. D. Buda-Prejbeanu, S. Mangin, J. Gorchon, J. Hohlfeld, M. Hehn
Abstract: Single pulse All Optical Helicity-Independent Toggle Switching is observed in CoHo and CoDy alloys single layers. An original reversal mechanism is reported which contrasts with those observed to date. It is shown that the reversal process is on the {\mu}s timescale involving the reorganization / coalescence of domains and domain walls. The toggle switching is explained considering the unbalanced magnetization distribution stabilized after the ultrashort laser pulse.

Title: Transforming Siliconization into Slippery Liquid-like Coatings
Authors: Hernán Barrio-Zhang (1), Glen McHale (1), Gary G. Wells (1), Rodrigo Ledesma-Aguilar (1), Rui Han (2), Nicholas Jakubovics (3), Jinju Chen (2) ((1) Institute for Multiscale Thermofluids, School of Engineering, University of Edinburgh, (2) Department of Materials, Loughborough University, (3) School of Dental Sciences, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Newcastle University)
Abstract: Siliconization is widely used as a coating technique to engineer surface properties, such as in the pharmaceutical and medical device industries to lubricate motion, ensure complete dispensation of product, and to inhibit protein adsorption and biofilm growth. In the hitherto unconnected literature, there has recently been significant progress in understanding the concept of surfaces slippery to liquids. Whereas in the siliconization industry the wettability of surfaces focuses on the hydrophobicity, as measured by contact angle and surface energy, for surfaces slippery to liquids the focus is on the contact angle hysteresis (droplet-on-solid static friction). Moreover, it has been discovered that surfaces with similar static wetting properties can have dramatically different droplet kinetic friction. Here, we report a simple-to-apply coating method to create ultra-low contact angle hysteresis liquid-like coatings for glass (G), polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), polyurethane (PU), and stainless steel (SS); materials that are used for pharmaceutical/parenteral packaging and medical equipment. Moreover, we demonstrate that the coating's slow sliding dynamics surface properties for water droplets, which indicate high droplet kinetic friction, can be converted into fast sliding dynamics, which indicate low droplet kinetic friction, by a simple molecular capping (methylation) process. Our results provide new insight into key aspects of siliconization coatings in the context of industrial/commercial processes.

Title: Nanoparticle Deposition Techniques for Silica Nanoparticles: Synthesis, Electrophoretic Deposition, and Optimization- A review
Authors: Srabani Karmakar, Milind Deo, Imteaz Rahaman, Swomitra Kumar Mohanty
Abstract: Silica nanoparticles have emerged as key building blocks for advanced applications in electronics, catalysis, energy storage, biomedicine, and environmental science. In this review, we focus on recent developments in both the synthesis and deposition of these nanoparticles, emphasizing the widely used Stöber method and the versatile technique of electrophoretic deposition (EPD). The Stöber method is celebrated for its simplicity and reliability, offering precise control over particle size, morphology, and surface properties to produce uniform, monodisperse silica nanoparticles that meet high-quality standards for advanced applications. EPD, on the other hand, is a cost-effective, room-temperature process that enables uniform coatings on substrates with complex geometries. When compared to traditional techniques such as chemical vapor deposition, atomic layer deposition, and spin coating, EPD stands out due to its scalability, enhanced material compatibility, and ease of processing. Moreover, Future research should integrate AI-driven optimization with active learning to enhance electrophoretic deposition (EPD) of silica nanoparticles, leveraging predictive modeling and real-time adjustments for improved film quality and process efficiency. This approach promises to accelerate material discovery and enable scalable nanofabrication of advanced functional films.

Title: Pressure-temperature phase diagram calculations using polynomial machine learning potentials: A comprehensive study based on global structure prediction and self-consistent phonon calculations
Authors: Hayato Wakai, Atsuto Seko, Isao Tanaka
Abstract: Polynomial machine learning potentials (MLPs) based on polynomial rotational invariants have been systematically developed for various systems and applied to efficiently predict crystal structures. In this study, we propose a robust methodology founded on polynomial MLPs to comprehensively enumerate crystal structures under high-pressure conditions and to evaluate their phase stability at finite temperatures. The proposed approach involves constructing polynomial MLPs with high predictive accuracy across a broad range of pressures, conducting reliable global structure searches, and performing exhaustive self-consistent phonon calculations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by examining elemental silicon at pressures up to 100 GPa and temperatures up to 1000 K, revealing stable phases across these conditions. The framework established in this study offers a powerful strategy for predicting crystal structures and phase stability under high-pressure and finite-temperature conditions.

Title: Analog Computing with Heat: Matrix-vector Multiplication with Inverse-designed Metastructures
Authors: Caio Silva, Giuseppe Romano
Abstract: The growing computational demand has spurred interest in energy-efficient frameworks such as neuromorphic and analog computing. A core building block of modern applications is matrix-vector multiplication (MVM), which underpins a wide range of algorithms in both signal processing and machine learning. In this work, we propose performing MVM using inverse-designed metastructures, with heat serving as the signal carrier. The proposed approach is based on a generalization of effective thermal conductivity to systems with multiple input and output ports: The input signal is encoded as a set of applied temperatures, while the output is represented by the power collected at designated terminals. The metastructures are designed using density-based topology optimization, enabled by a differentiable thermal transport solver and automatic differentiation. We apply our methodology to optimize structures that approximate MVM for matrices of various dimensions, achieving 95.9\% accuracy for a 3$\times$3 matrix. These results highlight the potential of leveraging heat conduction for analog computing, with applications in scenarios where temperature gradients naturally occur, such as in electronic device hotspots, thermal mapping, and electronic skin.

Title: Comment on "Solvent-Induced Negative Energetic Elasticity in a Lattice Polymer Chain''
Authors: L. K. R. Duarte, L. G. Rizzi
Abstract: In a recent Letter, Shirai and Sakumichi [Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 148101 (2023), arXiv:2202.12483] presented a study focusing on the origin of a temperature-dependent negative contribution $G_U(T)$ to the elastic modulus $G(T)$ of hydrogels [Yoshikawa et al., Phys. Rev. X 11, 011045 (2021)]. The authors support their findings through an energy-related stiffness $k_U(r,T)$ obtained from a single chain, with $r$ being the end-to-end distance of a random walk on a 3D lattice. It is argued that the parameter $\varepsilon$ related to polymer-solvent interactions is positive, so the energy $E_s$ of an elongated state should be smaller than the energy $E_b$ of a more compact state. We believe that the analogy between $G_U(T)$ and $k_U(r,T)$ might have misled their claim that $G_U(T)<0$ when $\varepsilon>0$.

Title: Giant Spin Pumping at Polymer/Ferromagnet Interfaces for Hybrid Spintronic Devices
Authors: Shiva Gaur, Akash Kumar, Himanshu Bangar, Utkarsh Shashank, Hukum Singh, Saroj P. Dash, Anubhav Raghav, Johan Åkerman
Abstract: While the growing utilization of polymers in flexible electronic devices has sparked significant interest in polymer/metal interfaces, spintronic studies of such interfaces remain limited. Here, we systematically study spin pumping across a polymer/ferromagnet metal interface between hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ) oligomer layers ($t_\mathit{HSQ} = 30, 36, 48$ nm) and NiFe ($t_\mathit{NiFe} = 4, 5, 7, 10$ nm) thin films. Using ferromagnetic resonance measurements, we observe strong spin pumping (large linewidth broadening) and a giant spin mixing conductance, reaching 19.8~${\rm nm^{-2}}$ for HSQ = 48 nm, \emph{i.e.}~comparable to that of heavy metals. Our results suggest efficient spin transfer across the HSQ/NiFe interface, possibly originating from a combination of spin and orbital pumping, and provide valuable insights for designing self-powered and flexible spintronic devices utilizing polymers in combination with ferromagnetic materials.

Title: Revealing the loss mechanisms of a 3D superconducting microwave cavity for use in a dark matter search
Authors: J. C. Esmenda (1), E. A. Laird (1), I. Bailey (1), T. Gamble (2), P. Smith (2), E. Daw (2), Y. A. Pashkin (1) ((1) Department of Physics, Lancaster University, UK, (2) School of Mathematical and Physical Sciences, University of Sheffield, UK)
Abstract: Superconducting microwave cavities have found applications in many areas including quantum computing, particle accelerators, and dark matter searches. Their extremely high quality factors translate to very narrow bandwidth, which makes them key components of sensitive detectors. In this study, we aim to understand the loss mechanisms of an aluminium cavity and how they change as the cavity material transitions from the superconducting to normal state. We found that at temperatures not much lower than the transition temperature $T_c$, losses are dominated by quasiparticle excitations and are well described by the BCS theory. The exponential decrease of the quasiparticle density below $T_c$ results in a 1000-fold increase of the quality factor, as well as a shift of the resonance frequency due to the change of the kinetic inductance of the superconductor. At very low temperatures, losses due to two-level systems begin to dominate giving a peak in the quality factor of about 27.6 million at 130 mK. Understanding the loss mechanisms is invaluable, as the working temperature of the cavity may vary during operation regardless of its application.

Title: Higher order tacnodes in a free fermionic model
Authors: Andrea Maroncelli, Jean-Marie Stéphan
Abstract: We investigate a free fermion model with nearest and next-nearest neighbor hopping, evolving in imaginary time from a product state with N consecutive fermions, and conditioned to go back to the same state after a given time. In the case of nearest neighbor hoppings, this model is known to give rise to limit shapes and arctic curves for large time and fermion number, with in particular two fluctuating regions which can be tuned to merge depending on ratio between time and N. Fluctuations near the merger are governed by a so-called tacnode kernel. In this paper we study the analogous picture in the presence of a next nearest interactions. In particular, we discuss the limit shapes, and compute analytically the corresponding density profile. We also study the behavior of correlations close to the merger point, and find a novel higher order tacnode kernel governing them.

Title: W-shaped Broadband Attenuation of Longitudinal Waves through Composite Elastic Metamaterial
Authors: B. Lemkalli, K. K. Dudek, M. Kadic, Q. Ji, S. Guenneau, A. Mir, Y. Achaoui
Abstract: We investigate a composite elastic meta-slab with exceptional transmission properties, particularly the presence of a W-shaped bandgap. A comprehensive study, utilizing experimental measurements, the finite element method, and an analytical approach, identifies this specific bandgap. The meta-slab design involves cutting an array of composite materials arranged in parallel with strategically placed incisions. This configuration ensures that the materials between the slits act as plate-like waveguides within the surrounding medium. The incorporation of steel into ABS-based Fabry-Perot cavities induces a notable coupling effect between longitudinal waves and localized modes traversing the structure, leading to the formation of two distinct Fabry-Perot resonators. These coupling effects generate a series of resonances and antiresonances, ultimately producing the W-band gap through the interaction of two symmetric Fano resonances.

Title: Taking the temperature of quantum many-body scars
Authors: Phillip C. Burke, Shane Dooley
Abstract: A quantum many-body scar is an eigenstate of a chaotic many-body Hamiltonian that exhibits two seemingly incongruous properties: its energy eigenvalue corresponds to a high temperature, yet its entanglement structure resembles that of low-temperature eigenstates, such as ground states. Traditionally, a temperature is assigned to an energy \emph{eigenvalue} through the textbook canonical temperature-energy relationship. However, in this work, we use the \emph{eigenstate subsystem temperature} -- a recently developed quantity that assigns a temperature to an energy eigenstate, based on the structure of its reduced density matrix. For a thermal state, the eigenstate subsystem temperature is approximately equal to its canonical temperature. Given that quantum many-body scars have a ground-state-like entanglement structure, it is not immediately clear that their eigenstate subsystem temperature would be close to their canonical temperature. Surprisingly, we find that this is the case: the quantum many-body scars have approximate ``knowledge'' of their position in the spectrum encoded within their state structure.

Title: Entanglement in Typical States of Chern-Simons Theory
Authors: Charlie Cummings
Abstract: We compute various averages over bulk geometries of quantum states prepared by the Chern-Simons path integral, for any level $k$ and compact gauge group $G$. We do so by carefully summing over all topologically distinct bulk geometries which have $n$ disjoint boundary tori and a decomposition into space$\times$time of fixed spatial topology. We find that the typical state is unentangled across any bipartition of the tori defining the boundary Hilbert space, to leading order in the complexity defining the state. This is contrary to expectations from three-dimensional gravity. Additionally, we compute an averaged wave function which captures the leading order statistics of boundary observables in the $n$ torus Chern-Simons Hilbert space. We show that this averaged state is a separable state, which implies that different boundary tori only share classical correlations for complex enough bulk geometries.

Title: Kicking Quantum Fisher Information out of Equilibrium
Authors: Florent Ferro, Maurizio Fagotti
Abstract: Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) is a ubiquitous quantity with applications ranging from quantum metrology and resource theories to condensed matter physics. In equilibrium local quantum many-body systems, the QFI of a subsystem with respect to an extensive observable is typically proportional to the subsystem's volume. Specifically, in large subsystems at equilibrium, the QFI per unit volume squared becomes negligible. We reveal a natural mechanism that amplifies the QFI in a quantum spin chain with a zero-temperature ordered phase. At zero or sufficiently low temperatures, a transient localized perturbation enhances the QFI, causing it to scale quadratically with the subsystem's length. Furthermore, this enhancement can be controlled through more general localized kicking protocols. We also revisit the behavior of the quantum Fisher information after a global quench in the thermodynamic limit, focusing on the generation of localized -- confined within compact subsystems -- multipartite entanglement. We show that the density of localized multipartite entanglement approaches zero at late times, but there is an optimal time frame proportional to the length in which subsystems fall into macroscopic quantum states. We test our predictions against numerical data obtained using a novel technique, based on a remarkable identity between quantum Fisher information and Wigner-Yanase-Dyson skew information, that allows one to compute the quantum Fisher information with respect to the order parameter in noninteracting spin chains.

Title: Liouville Fock state lattices and potential simulators
Authors: Caio B. Naves, Jonas Larson
Abstract: We introduce Liouville Fock state lattices (LFSLs) as a framework for visualizing open quantum systems through matrix representations of the Lindblad master equation (LME). By vectorizing the LME, the state evolves in a doubled Hilbert space, naturally forming a synthetic lattice. Unlike the unitary evolution of pure states, LFSL states exhibit nontrivial dynamics due to the non-Hermitian Liouvillian, featuring population drifts, sources, and sinks--paralleling stochastic classical lattices. We explore these "classical simulators" in both the Fock representation and alternative positive semidefinite representations, which more closely resemble classical probability distributions. We further demonstrate how infinite steady state manifolds can derive from frustration in the LFSL.

Title: Carbon-Nanotube/$β$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ Heterojunction PIN Diodes
Authors: Hunter D. Ellis, Botong Li, Haoyu Xie, Jichao Fan, Imteaz Rahaman, Weilu Gao, Kai Fu
Abstract: $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ is gaining attention as a promising semiconductor for next-generation high-power, high-efficiency, and high-temperature electronic devices, thanks to its exceptional material properties. However, challenges such as the lack of viable p-type doping have hindered its full potential, particularly in the development of ambipolar devices. This work introduces a novel heterojunction diode (HD) that combines p-type carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with i/n-type $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ to overcome these limitations. For the first time, a CNT/$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ hetero-p-n-junction diode is fabricated. Compared to a traditional Schottky barrier diode (SBD) with the same $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ epilayer, the CNT/$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ HD demonstrates significant improvements, including a higher rectifying ratio ($1.2 \times 10^{11}$), a larger turn-on voltage (1.96 V), a drastically reduced leakage current at temperatures up to 300 °C, and a 26.7% increase in breakdown voltage. Notably, the CNT/$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ HD exhibits a low ideality factor of 1.02, signifying an ideal interface between the materials. These results underline the potential of CNT/$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ heterojunctions for electronic applications, offering a promising solution to current limitations in $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$-based devices.

Title: Ostwald Ripening of Buoyancy-Driven Microbubbles
Authors: Yuki Uematsu
Abstract: Microbubble solutions have a wide range of industrial applications, including heat transfer, agriculture, and water treatment. Therefore, understanding and controlling the size variation of bubbles is critical. In this study, we develop a theoretical framework for Ostwald ripening in buoyancy-driven microbubbles by introducing a height-dependent size distribution function. For the first time, we show that the population balance equation in steady state can be interpreted within the Lifshitz-Slezov-Wagner theory when the distribution function is redefined as the density distribution of the buoyancy-induced flux. Notably, in this form of Ostwald ripening, the distribution function approaches a scaled universal distribution, not over time, but as a function of height. We analytically derive the scaled universal distribution and show that the fifth power of the mean radius of the bubbles grows linearly with height.

Title: Universal Defect Statistics in Counterdiabatic Quantum Critical Dynamics
Authors: András Grabarits, Adolfo del Campo
Abstract: Counterdiabatic driving (CD) provides a framework to reduce excitations in nonadiabatic processes. Exact CD protocols require nonlocal control fields, and CD approximations with tailored locality are needed for their implementation. However, the performance of local CD schemes remains poorly understood. We consider the local CD across a quantum phase transition at an arbitrary rate. We establish its efficiency as a function of the degree of locality and demonstrate that the resulting defect statistics exhibit universal behavior. Our results provide an analytical framework for evaluating the effectiveness of local CD protocols in quantum state preparation, control, and optimization.

Title: Terahertz frequency-domain 4x4 Mueller matrix ellipsometer instrument designed for high-frequency magnetic resonance measurements
Authors: Viktor Rindert, Alexander Ruder, Steffen Richter, Philipp Kühne, Mark Bauer, Vanya Darakchieva, Mathias Schubert
Abstract: We report a Mueller matrix ellipsometer design using dual continuously rotating anisotropic meta wave plates which determines the full set of Mueller matrix elements in the terahertz spectral range. The instrument operates in the frequency domain and employs a frequency tunable, solid state synthesizer based, continuous wave terahertz source with sub-MHz bandwidth. The implemented source permits operation within 82-125 GHz and 170-250 GHz, without and with an additional frequency doubler, respectively. The terahertz transparent meta wave plates consist of 3D-printed polymer based columnar thin film structures with subwavelength dimensions. The rotating wave plates produce sufficient modulation of the Stokes vector components of transmitted terahertz light to use the wave plates in polarization state generator and polarization state detector devices. Fast terahertz light detection rate of a quasi optical solid state detector permits acquisition with few microsecond temporal resolution and electronic sweeping control of the source frequency. We develop a fast frequency sweeping scheme while continuously rotating the terahertz wave plates. Subsequent sorting of measured data permits measurements of Mueller matrix elements at hundreds of different wavelengths. The Mueller matrix elements are obtained by forward numerical reduction of the measured data using an algorithm developed by Ruder et al.[Opt. Lett. 45, 3541 (2020)]. The instrument is combined with a magnetocryostat capable of reaching magnetic field strengths at the sample position of -8 T...8 T and sample temperatures from 4 K...400 K. Hence, the instrument is suitable to measure the full Mueller matrix of samples with magnetic resonances as demonstrated recently by Rindert et al. [Phys. Rev. B 110, 054413 (2024)]. We discuss design, calibration, and example applications.

Title: Bouncing microdroplets on hydrophobic surfaces
Authors: Jamie Mclauchlan, Jim S. Walker, Vatsal Sanjay, Maziyar Jalaal, Jonathan P. Reid, Adam M. Squires, Anton Souslov
Abstract: Intuitively, slow droplets stick to a surface and faster droplets splash or bounce. However, recent work suggests that on non-wetting surfaces, whether microdroplets stick or bounce depends only on their size and fluid properties, but not on the incoming velocity. Here, we show using theory and experiments that even poorly wetting surfaces have a velocity-dependent criterion for bouncing of aqueous droplets, which is as high as 6 m/s for diameters of 30-50 microns on hydrophobic surfaces such as Teflon. We quantify this criterion by analyzing the interplay of dissipation, surface adhesion, and incoming kinetic energy, and describe a wealth of associated phenomena, including air bubbles and satellite droplets. Our results on inertial microdroplets elucidate fundamental processes crucial to aerosol science and technology.

Title: Enhancing Revivals Via Projective Measurements in a Quantum Scarred System
Authors: Alessio Paviglianiti, Alessandro Silva
Abstract: Quantum many-body scarred systems exhibit atypical dynamical behavior, evading thermalization and featuring periodic state revivals. In this Letter, we investigate the impact of projective measurements on the dynamics in the scar subspace for the paradigmatic PXP model, revealing that they can either disrupt or enhance the revivals. Local measurements performed at random times rapidly erase the system's memory of its initial conditions, leading to fast steady-state relaxation. In contrast, a periodic monitoring amplifies recurrences and preserves the coherent dynamics over extended timescales. We identify a measurement-induced phase resynchronization, countering the natural dephasing of quantum scars, as the key mechanism underlying this phenomenon.

Title: Non-linear and non-empirical double hybrid density functional
Authors: Danish Khan
Abstract: We develop a non-linear and non-empirical (nLanE) double hybrid density functional derived from an accurate interpolation of the adiabatic connection in density functional theory, incorporating the correct asymptotic expansions. By bridging the second-order perturbative weak correlation limit with the fully interacting limit from the semi-local SCAN functional, nLanE-SCAN is free of fitted parameters while providing improved energetic predictions compared to SCAN for moderately and strongly correlated systems alike. It delivers accurate predictions for atomic total energies and multiple reaction datasets from the GMTKN55 benchmark while significantly outperforming traditional linear hybrids and double hybrids for non-covalent interactions without requiring dispersion corrections. Due to the exact constraints at the weak correlation limit, nLanE-SCAN has reduced delocalization errors as evident through SIE4x4 and bond dissociations of H\(_2^+\) and He\(_2^+\). Its proper asymptotic behavior ensures stability in strongly correlated systems, improving H\(_2\) and N\(_2\) bond dissociation profiles compared to conventional functionals.

Title: Toward single-photon detection with superconducting niobium diselenide nanowires
Authors: Pietro Metuh, Athanasios Paralikis, Paweł Wyborski, Sherwan Jamo, Alessandro Palermo, Lucio Zugliani, Matteo Barbone, Kai Müller, Niels Gregersen, Saulius Vaitiekėnas, Jonathan Finley, Battulga Munkhbat
Abstract: We present superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) based on few-layer NbSe$_2$ fully encapsulated with hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), demonstrating single-photon sensitivity. Our fabrication process preserves the superconducting properties of NbSe$_2$ in nanowires, as confirmed by low-temperature transport measurements that show a critical temperature of $T_c \approx 6.5$ K, comparable to the reported values for unpatterned sheets, and it maintains a contact resistance of $\sim 50 \, \Omega$ at $T = 4$ K. Meandered NbSe$_2$ nanowires exhibit a responsivity of up to $4.9 \times 10^4$ V/W over a spectral range of 650-1550 nm in a closed-cycle cryostat at 4 K, outperforming planar and short-wire devices. The devices achieve a $1/e$ recovery time of $\tau = (135 \pm 36)$ ns, system timing jitter of $j_\text{sys} = (1103 \pm 7)$ ps, and detection efficiency of $\sim 0.01\%$ at $0.95I_c$, with a linear increase in detection probability confirming the single-photon operation. Furthermore, measurements under attenuated pulsed laser (1 MHz) indicate a success rate of up to $33\%$ in detecting individual optical pulses, establishing the platform as a promising candidate for developing efficient single-photon detectors.

Title: Subsystem Symmetry Fractionalization and Foliated Field Theory
Authors: Po-Shen Hsin, David T. Stephen, Arpit Dua, Dominic J. Williamson
Abstract: Topological quantum matter exhibits a range of exotic phenomena when enriched by subdimensional symmetries. This includes new features beyond those that appear in the conventional setting of global symmetry enrichment. A recently discovered example is a type of subsystem symmetry fractionalization that occurs through a different mechanism to global symmetry fractionalization. In this work we extend the study of subsystem symmetry fractionalization through new examples derived from the general principle of embedding subsystem symmetry into higher-form symmetry. This leads to new types of symmetry fractionalization that are described by foliation dependent higher-form symmetries. This leads to field theories and lattice models that support previously unseen anomalous subsystem symmetry fractionalization. Our work expands the range of exotic topological physics that is enabled by subsystem symmetry in field theory and on the lattice.

Abstract: Rock weathering is a common phenomenon in most engineering applications, such as underground storage or geothermal energy. This work offers a discrete element modelization of the problem considering cohesive granular material and debonding effect. Oedometer conditions are applied during the weathering and the evolution of the coefficient of lateral earth pressure, a proxy of the state of stress, is tracked. Especially, the influence of the degree of cementation, the confining pressure, the initial value of k0 and the history of load are investigated. It has been emphasized that the granular media aims to reach an attractor configuration. And the grain reorganization occurring is divided into two main phenomena: the collapse of the unstable chain forces (stable only thanks to the cementation) and the softening of the grains.

Title: Extracting Universal Corner Entanglement Entropy during the Quantum Monte Carlo Simulation
Authors: Yuan Da Liao, Menghan Song, Jiarui Zhao, Zi Yang Meng
Abstract: The subleading corner logarithmic corrections in entanglement entropy (EE) are crucial for revealing universal characteristics of the quantum critical points (QCPs), but they are challenging to detect. Motivated by recent developments in the stable computation of EE in (2+1)D quantum many-body systems, we have developed a new method for directly measuring the corner contribution in EE with less computational cost. The cornerstone of our approach is to measure the subtracted corner entanglement entropy (SCEE) defined as the difference between the EEs of subregions with the same boundary length for smooth and cornered boundaries during the sign-problem free quantum Monte Carlo simulation. Our improved method inherently eliminates not only the area law term of EE but also the subleading log-corrections arising from Goldstone modes, leaving the universal corner contribution as the leading term of SCEE with greatly improved data quality. Utilizing this advanced approach, we calculate the SCEE of the bilayer Heisenberg model on both square and honeycomb lattices across their (2+1)D O(3) QCPs with different opening angles on entanglement boundary, and obtain the accurate values of the corresponding universal corner log-coefficients. These findings will encourage further theoretical investigations to access controlled universal information for interacting CFTs at (2+1)D.

Title: Integrable models on Rydberg atom chains
Authors: Luke Corcoran, Marius de Leeuw, Balázs Pozsgay
Abstract: We initiate a systematic study of integrable models for spin chains with constrained Hilbert spaces; we focus on spin-1/2 chains with the Rydberg constraint. We extend earlier results for medium-range spin chains to the constrained Hilbert space, and formulate an integrability condition. This enables us to construct new integrable models with fixed interaction ranges. We classify all time- and space-reflection symmetric integrable Rydberg-constrained Hamiltonians of range 3 and 4. At range 3, we find a single family of integrable Hamiltonians: the so-called RSOS quantum chains, which are related to the well-known RSOS models of Andrews, Baxter, and Forrester. At range 4 we find two families of models, the first of which is the constrained XXZ model. We also find a new family of models depending on a single coupling $z$. We provide evidence of two critical points related to the golden ratio $\phi$, at $z=\phi^{-1/2}$ and $z=\phi^{3/2}$. We also perform a partial classification of integrable Hamiltonians for range 5.

Title: Generic transverse stability of kink structures in atomic and optical nonlinear media with competing attractive and repulsive interactions
Authors: S. I. Mistakidis, G. Bougas, G. C. Katsimiga, P. G. Kevrekidis
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence and stability of one-dimensional (1D) topological kink configurations immersed in higher-dimensional bosonic gases and nonlinear optical setups. Our analysis pertains, in particular, to the two- and three-dimensional extended Gross-Pitaevskii models with quantum fluctuations describing droplet-bearing environments but also to the two-dimensional cubic-quintic nonlinear Schrödinger equation containing higher-order corrections to the nonlinear refractive index. Contrary to the generic dark soliton transverse instability, the kink structures are generically robust under the interplay of low-amplitude attractive and high-amplitude repulsive interactions. A quasi-1D effective potential picture dictates the existence of these defects, while their stability is obtained numerically and analytically through linearization analysis and direct dynamics in the presence of external fluctuations showcasing their unprecedented resilience. These generic (across different models) findings should be detectable in current cold atom and optics experiments, offering insights towards controlling topological excitations.

Title: Quantum Simulation with Gauge Fixing: from Ising Lattice Gauge Theory to Dynamical Flux Model
Authors: Junsen Wang, Xiangxiang Sun, Wei Zheng
Abstract: Quantum simulation of synthetic dynamic gauge field has attracted much attentions in recent years. There are two traditional ways to simulate gauge theories. One is to directly simulate the full Hamiltonian of gauge theories with local gauge symmetries. And the other is to engineer the projected Hamiltonian in one gauge subsector. In this work, we provide the third way towards the simulation of gauge theories based on gauge fixing. To demonstrate this concept, we fix the gauge of an Ising lattice gauge field coupled with spinless fermions on a ladder geometry. After the gauge fixing, this gauge theory is reduced to a simpler model, in which fermions hop on a ladder with a fluctuating dynamical $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ flux. Then we shows that this model can be realized via Floquet engineering in ultracold atomic gases. By analytical and numerical studies of this dynamical flux model, we deduce that there is confinement to deconfinement phase transition in the original unfixed gauge theory. This work paves the way to quantum simulate lattice gauge theory using the concept of gauge fixing, relevant both for condensed matter and high energy physics.

Title: Sign changes of the thermoelectric transport coefficient across the metal-insulator crossover in the doped Fermi Hubbard model
Authors: Sayantan Roy, Abhisek Samanta, Nandini Trivedi
Abstract: We investigate the doping-dependence of the Seebeck coefficient, as calculated from the Kelvin formula, for the Fermi Hubbard model using determinantal quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Our key findings are: (1) Besides the expected hole to electron-like behavior change around half filling, we show that the additional sign change at an electronic density $n_s$ (and correspondingly a hole density $p_s$) is controlled by the opening of a charge gap in the thermodynamic density of states or compressibility and not by the pseudogap scale in the single particle density of states. (2) We find that $n_s(T,U)$ depends strongly on the interaction $U$ and shows an unusual non-monotonic dependence on temperature with a maximum at a temperature $T\approx t$, on the order of the hopping scale. (3) We identify local moment formation close to half filling as the main driver for the anomalous behavior of the thermoelectric transport coefficient.

Title: Entanglement scaling and charge fluctuations in a Fermi liquid of composite fermions
Authors: Cristian Voinea, Songyang Pu, Ajit C. Balram, Zlatko Papić
Abstract: The composite fermion Fermi liquid (CFL) state at $\nu=1/2$ filling of a Landau level is a paradigmatic non-Fermi liquid borne out purely by Coulomb interactions. But in what ways is this exotic state of matter different from a Fermi liquid? The CFL entanglement entropy was indeed found to exhibit a significant enhancement compared to free electrons [Shao et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 206402 (2015)], which was subsequently ruled out as a finite-size effect by the study of a lattice CFL analog [Mishmash and Motrunich, Phys. Rev. B 94, 081110 (2016)]. Moreover, the enhancement was not observed in a quasi-one-dimensional limit of the Coulomb ground state at $\nu=1/2$ [Geraedts et al., Science 352, 197 (2016)]. Here, we revisit the problem of entanglement scaling in the CFL state realized in a two-dimensional electron gas. Using Monte Carlo evaluation of the second Rényi entropy $S_2$ for the CFL variational wave function, we show that the entanglement enhancement is present not only at $\nu=1/2$ but also at $\nu=1/4$, as well as in bosonic CFL states at $\nu=1$ and $\nu=1/3$ fillings. In all cases, we find the scaling of $S_2$ with subsystem size to be enhanced compared to the non-interacting case, and insensitive to the choice of geometry and projection to the lowest Landau level. We also demonstrate that, for CFL states, the variance of the particle number in a subsystem obeys area-law scaling with a universal subleading corner contribution, in stark contrast with free fermions. Our results establish the enhanced entanglement scaling and suppressed charge fluctuations as fingerprints of non-Fermi-liquid correlations in CFL states.

Title: Geometric phase and multipartite entanglement of Rydberg atom chains
Authors: Chang-Yan Wang
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of geometric phase (GP) and geometric entanglement (GE), a multipartite entanglement measure, across quantum phase transitions in Rydberg atom chains. Using density matrix renormalization group calculations and finite-size scaling analysis, we characterize the critical properties of transitions between disordered and ordered phases. Both quantities exhibit characteristic scaling near transition points, with the disorder to $Z_2$ ordered phase transition showing behavior consistent with the Ising universality class, while the disorder to $Z_3$ phase transition displays distinct critical properties. We demonstrate that GP and GE serve as sensitive probes of quantum criticality, providing consistent critical parameters and scaling behavior. A unifying description of these geometric quantities from a quantum geometry perspective is explored, and an interferometric setup for their potential measurement is discussed. Our results provide insights into the interplay between geometric phase and multipartite entanglement near quantum phase transitions in Rydberg atom systems, revealing how these quantities reflect the underlying critical behavior in these complex quantum many-body systems.

Title: Giant increase of diffusion by small rise of friction
Authors: I. G. Marchenko, I. I. Marchenko, V. Aksenova, J. Łuczka, J. Spiechowicz
Abstract: Diffusion coefficient usually decreases when friction increases. We analyze the opposite behavior in the paradigmatic system consisting of an inertial Brownian particle moving in a symmetric spatially periodic potential and driven by an unbiased time periodic force. For tailored parameter set in strong dissipation regime the particle spreading can be giantly amplified: if the friction is twice as large then the diffusion grows up to five orders of magnitude. The mechanism lying behind this effect is related to bifurcation of periodic orbits oscillating around the potential maximum and their symmetric displacement towards the adjacent potential minima when the friction coefficient increases. On the other hand, in the weak dissipation regime, where the increase of diffusion vs friction is also observed, the effect is induced by a non-monotonic change of population of the running orbits. However, in this regime the enhancement of diffusion is much smaller.

Title: Line tension from dual-geometry sessile droplet measurements: Combining contact-angle size-dependence data for axisymmetric and cylindrical droplets to determine the line tension
Authors: Dmitry V. Tatyanenko, Konstantin D. Apitsin
Abstract: We perform a thermodynamic analysis of various contributions to the size dependence of the contact-angle cosine for both axisymmetric and cylindrical sessile droplets. This shows that a commonly used method to determine the line tension from the slope of the contact-angle cosine dependence on the three-phase contact-line curvature (for axisymmetric droplets) provides a certain combination of the line tension, the adsorptions at the three interfaces, and the macroscopic contact angle. To extract the contribution related to the contact line in the leading order and determine the line tension, we propose a simple technique using droplet-size dependences of the contact angle for axisymmetric and cylindrical droplets under the same conditions.

Title: Dynamical formation of multiple quantum droplets in a Bose-Bose mixture
Authors: L. Cavicchioli, C. Fort, F. Ancilotto, M. Modugno, F. Minardi, A. Burchianti
Abstract: We report on the formation of multiple quantum droplets in a heteronuclear $^{41}$K-$^{87}$Rb mixture released in an optical waveguide. By a sudden change of the interspecies interaction from the non-interacting to the strongly attractive regime, we initially form a single droplet in an excited compression-elongation mode. The latter axially expands up to a critical length and then splits into two or more smaller fragments, recognizable as quantum droplets. We find that the number of formed droplets increases with decreasing interspecies attraction and increasing atom number. We show, by combining theory and experiment, that this behavior is consistent with capillary instability, which causes the breakup of the stretching droplet due to the surface tension. Our results open new possibilities to explore the properties of quantum liquids and systems of multiple quantum droplets in two-component bosonic mixtures.

Title: Hyperuniformity in mass transport processes with center-of-mass conservation: Some exact results
Authors: Animesh Hazra, Anirban Mukherjee, Punyabrata Pradhan
Abstract: We characterize steady-state static and dynamic properties in a broad class of mass transport processes on a periodic hypercubic lattice of volume $L^d$, where both mass and {\it center-of-mass} (CoM) remain conserved and detailed balance is violated in the bulk; we specifically consider these models in $d=1$ and $2$ dimensions. Using a microscopic approach, we exactly determine the decay (or, growth) exponents for various dynamic and static correlation functions. We show that, despite constrained dynamics due to the CoM conservation (CoMC), the density relaxation is indeed diffusive. However, fluctuation properties are strikingly different from that in the diffusive systems with a single (mass) conservation law. In the thermodynamic limit, the steady-state variance $\langle {\cal Q}^2(T) \rangle_c$ of time-integrated bond current ${\cal Q}(T)$ across a bond in time interval $T$ exhibits the following long-time behavior: $\langle {\cal Q}^2(T) \rangle_c \simeq A_1 T + A_2 + A_3 T^{-d/2}$. Remarkably, depending on dimensions and microscopic details, the prefactor $A_1$ can vanish (e.g., for $d=1$), causing the variance to eventually {\it saturate}. The exponents governing the small-frequency behavior of the power spectrum $S_J(f) \sim f^{\psi_J}$ for bond current are exactly determined as $\psi_J=3/2$ and $2$ in $d=1$ and $2$ dimensions, respectively, implying a ``dynamic hyperuniformity''. We also compute the static structure factor $S(q)$, which, in the small-$q$ limit, varies as the square of wave number $q$, i.e., $S(q) \sim q^2$. Indeed, both dynamic and static fluctuations are anomalously suppressed, resulting in an extreme form of (``class I'') hyperuniformity in the systems.

Title: Tunable topological transitions in the frustrated magnet HoAgGe
Authors: Hari Bhandari, Po-Hao Chang, Resham Babu Regmi, Bence Gábor Márkus, László Forró, J.F. Mitchell, I.I. Mazin, Nirmal J. Ghimire
Abstract: The kagome lattice, known for its strong frustration in two dimensions, hosts a variety of exotic magnetic and electronic states. A variation of this geometry, where the triangular motifs are twisted to further reduce symmetry, has recently revealed even more complex physics. HoAgGe exemplifies such a structure, with magnetic and electronic properties believed to be driven by strong in-plane anisotropy of the Ho spins, effectively acting as a two-dimensional spin ice. In this study, using a combination of magnetization, Hall conductivity measurements, and density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate how various spin-ice states, stabilized by external magnetic fields, influence the Fermi surface topology. More interestingly, we observe sharp transitions in Hall conductivity without concurrent changes in magnetization when an external magnetic field is applied along a particular crystallographic direction, underscoring the role of strong magnetic frustration and providing a new platform for exploring the interplay between magnetic frustration, electronic topology, and crystalline symmetry. These results also highlight the limitations of a simple spin-ice model, suggesting that a more sophisticated framework is necessary to capture the subtle experimental nuances observed.

Title: Direct observation of thermal hysteresis in the molecular dynamics of barocaloric neopentyl glycol
Authors: Frederic Rendell-Bhatti, Markus Appel, Connor S. Inglis, Melony Dilshad, Neha Mehta, Jonathan Radcliffe, Xavier Moya, Donald A. MacLaren, David Boldrin
Abstract: Barocalorics (BCs) are emerging as promising alternatives to vapour-phase refrigerants, which are problematic as they exacerbate climate change when they inevitably leak into the atmosphere. However, the commercialisation of BC refrigerants is significantly hindered by hysteresis in the solid-solid phase transition that would be exploited in a refrigeration cycle. Here, we provide new insight into the hysteresis that is a critical step towards the rational design of viable BCs. By studying the benchmark BC plastic crystal, neopentyl glycol (NPG), we observe directly the liberation of the hydroxyl rotational modes that unlock the hydrogen bond network, distinguishing for the first time the molecular reorientation and hydroxymethyl rotational modes. We showcase the use high-resolution inelastic fixed-window scans in combination with quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS) measurements to build a comprehensive microscopic understanding of the NPG phase transition, directly tracking the molecular dynamics of the phase transition. Hysteresis previously observed in calorimetric studies of NPG is now observed directly as hysteresis in molecular rotational modes, and hence in the formation and disruption of hydrogen bonding. Furthermore, by tracking the thermal activation of three main reorientation modes, we suggest that their fractional excitations may resolve an outstanding discrepancy between measured and calculated entropy change. These results allow for direct study of the molecular dynamics that govern the thermal hysteresis of small molecule energy materials. They will be broadly applicable, as many promising BC material families possess first-order transitions involving molecular reorientations.

Title: Is the gain-voltage dependence of SiPMs linear?
Authors: M. Antonello, L. Brinkmann, E. Garutti, R. Klanner, J. Schwandt
Abstract: The gain-voltage dependence for SiPMs from V. Chmill et al., Study of the breakdown voltage of SiPMs, is reanalyzed and a non-linearity at the sub-percent level is observed. Simulations show that he non-linearity can be explained by the increase of the depletion depth of the avalanche region with over-voltage. A consequence of the non-linearity is that the voltage at which the discharge stops is systematically underestimated if a linear extrapolation is used. However, the shift is too small to explain the difference between the break-down voltage from the current-voltage dependence and the one obtained from the extrapolation of the gain-voltage dependence to gain one. The results are confirmed by measurement of a different MPPC produced by Hamamatsu which has a break-down voltage which is about a factor two higher.

Title: A Tactile Void
Authors: Pierre Tapie, Diogo Barreiros Scatamburlo, Antoine Chateauminois, Elie Wandersman
Abstract: We mimic the mechanical response of touch mechanoreceptors by that of a gas cavity embedded in an elastic semi-cylinder, as a fingertip analogue. Using tribological experiments combined with optical imaging, we measure the dynamics and deformation of the cavity as the semi-cylinder is put in static contact or slid against model rough surfaces at constant normal force and velocity. We propose an elastic model to predict the cavity deformation under normal load showing that membrane mechanical stresses are anisotropic and we discuss its possible biological consequences. In friction experiments, we show that the cavity shape fluctuations allow for texture discriminations.

Title: Effects of non-integrability in a non-Hermitian time crystal
Authors: Weihua Xie, Michael Kolodrubetz, Vadim Oganesyan, Daniel P. Arovas
Abstract: Time crystals are systems that spontaneously break time-translation symmetry, exhibiting repeating patterns in time. Recent work has shown that non-Hermitian Floquet systems can host a time crystalline phase with quasi-long-range order. In this work, we investigate the effect of introducing a non-integrable interaction term into this non-Hermitian time crystal model. Using a combination of numerical TEBD simulations, mean-field analysis, and perturbation theory, we find that the interaction term has two notable effects. First, it induces a shift in the phase diagram, moving the boundaries between different phases. Second, a sufficiently strong interaction induces an unexpected symmetry-breaking transition, which is not captured by the mean-field approach. Within average Hamiltonian theory, we trace this back to a ferromagnetic transition in the anisotropic non-Hermitian XXZ model. Our results demonstrate that the interplay between non-Hermitian dynamics and many-body interactions can lead to novel symmetry breaking.

Title: Actively-trained magnetic Moment Tensor Potentials for mechanical, dynamical, and thermal properties of paramagnetic CrN
Authors: Alexey S. Kotykhov, Max Hodapp, Christian Tantardini, Konstantin Kravtsov, Ivan Kruglov, Alexander V. Shapeev, Ivan S. Novikov
Abstract: We present a protocol for automated fitting of magnetic Moment Tensor Potential explicitly including magnetic moments in its functional form. For the fitting of this potential we use energies, forces, stresses, and magnetic forces (negative derivatives of energies with respect to magnetic moments) of configurations selected with an active learning algorithm. These selected configurations are computed using constrained density functional theory, which enables calculating energies and their derivatives for both equilibrium and non-equilibrium (excited) magnetic states. We test our protocol on the system of B1-CrN and demonstrate that the automatically trained magnetic Moment Tensor Potential reproduces mechanical, dynamical, and thermal properties, of B1-CrN in the paramagnetic state with respect to density functional theory and experiments.

Title: Majorana Flat Bands in the Vortex Line of Superconducting Weyl Semimetals
Authors: Zhicheng Zhang, Kou-Han Ma
Abstract: We report the emergence of Majorana flat bands (MFBs) in the vortex line of superconducting (SC) time-reversal-symmetry-breaking Weyl semimetals. By considering a Weyl semimetal as a stack of Chern insulators with varying Chern numbers along one ($z$) direction, we decompose the vortex bound states of SC Weyl semimetals into those of $k_{z}$-resolved SC Chern insulators. Through analytical and numerical calculations of the topological phase diagram of the SC Chern insulators, we explain the appearance of MFBs and determine the exact boundaries of them. Notably, the tuning of chemical potential or pairing strength results in the MFBs along the entire $k_{z}$ axis. To characterize the MFBs, we propose a $k_{z}$-resolved $Z_{2}$ Chern-Simons invariant as the topological indicator. Finally, we take an attractive Hubbard interaction into consideration, and the aforementioned SC Weyl semimetal with BCS pairing can be realized under appropriate parameters.

Title: Simultaneous mapping of the ultrafast time and fluence dependence of the laser-induced insulator-to-metal transition in magnetite

Abstract: Pump-probe methods are a ubiquitous tool in the field of ultrafast dynamic measurements. In recent years, x-ray free-electron laser experiments have gained importance due to their ability to probe with high chemical selectivity and at atomic length scales. Measurements are typically repeated many thousands of times to collect sufficient statistics and vary parameters like delay or fluence, necessitating that initial conditions are restored each time. An alternative is presented by experiments which measure the relevant parameters in a single shot. Here, we present a time-to-space mapping imaging scheme that enables us to record a range of delays and laser fluences in any single shot of the x-ray probe. We demonstrate the use of this scheme by mapping the ultrafast dynamics of the optically induced insulator-to-metal Verwey transition in a magnetite thin film, probed by soft x-ray resonant diffraction. By extrapolating our results toward the conditions found at x-ray free-electron lasers with higher photon energy, we demonstrate that the presented data could be recorded in a single shot.

Title: Theory of spin magnetization driven by chiral phonons
Authors: Dapeng Yao, Shuichi Murakami
Abstract: We construct a general theory of spin magnetization driven by chiral phonons under an adiabatic process, in which atoms rotate around their equilibrium positions with a low phonon frequency. Here the spin magnetization originates from the modulated electronic states with spin-orbital coupling by atomic rotations. Under the adiabatic approximation, the time-dependent spin magnetization can be calculated by a Berry-phase method. In this paper, we focus on its time average, which is evaluated by assuming that the phonon displacement is small. As a result, the time average of the spin magnetization is concisely formulated in the form of the Berry curvature defined in the phonon-displacement space as an intrinsic property of atomic rotations. Our formula for spin magnetization reflects the chiral nature of phonons, and is convenient for $ab$ $initio$ calculations.

Title: Enhancement of superconductivity on thin film of Sn under high pressure
Authors: Misaki Sasaki, Masahiro Ohkuma, Ryo Matsumoto, Toru Shinmei, Tetsuo Irifune, Yoshihiko Takano, Katsuya Shimizu
Abstract: We investigated the pressure effects of a superconductivity on thin films of Sn. Elemental superconductor Sn with a body-centered tetragonal structure, $\beta$-Sn, exhibits superconductivity below the superconducting transition temperature ($T_{\rm c}=3.72$ K) at ambient pressure. $T_{\rm c}$ of Sn increases with lowering dimension such as in thin film and nanowire growth, or by high-pressure application. For thin films, $T_{\rm c}$ exhibits a slight increase up to approximately 4 K compared to the bulk value, attributable to the crystalline size and lattice disorder. By applying pressure on a bulk Sn, $T_{\rm c}$ initially decreases from 3.72 K as the pressure increases. Further increasing pressure up to 10 GPa, $T_{\rm c}$ increases to 5.3 K with the structural transformation. However, the combination of these effects on thin films of Sn, namely, thin-film growth and pressure effects, remains underexplored. In this study, we combined film-growth and pressure-application techniques to further increase $T_{\rm c}$ using a diamond anvil cell with boron-doped diamond electrodes. The drop of the electrical resistance suggesting the onset of $T_{\rm c}$ on the thin film reached above 6 K in $\gamma$-Sn phase. Further, the upper critical magnetic field was drastically enhanced. Atomic force microscopy suggests that the refinement of the grain size of the thin film under the non-hydrostatic pressure conditions contributes to stabilizing the higher $T_{\rm c}$ of $\gamma$-Sn.

Title: Semiconductor-compatible topological digital alloys
Authors: Yunfan Liang, Damien West, Shunda Chen, Jifeng Liu, Tianshu Li, Shengbai Zhang
Abstract: Recently, GeSn alloys have attracted much interest for direct-gap infrared photonics and as potential topological materials which are compatible with the semiconductor industry. However, for photonics, the high-Sn content required leads to low detectivity, associated with poor material quality, and the (>35%) Sn required for topological properties have been out of reach experimentally. Here, we demonstrate that by patterning the Sn distribution within Ge, the electronic properties have a far greater tunability than is possible with the random alloy. For the GeSn \delta-digital alloy (DA) formed by confining Sn atoms in atomic layer(s) along the [111] direction of Ge, we show that ~10% Sn can lead to a triple-point semimetal. These findings are understood in terms of Sn ordering causing spatial separation of Sn and Ge band edges, leading to band inversion. This mechanism can also lead to a weak topological insulator, Weyl semimetal, and enables tunable direct bandgaps down to 2 meV, covering the entire infrared range. This DA induced topological properties are also identified in compound semiconductors, such as InAs1-xSbx, showing the general applicability of the DA design for realizing topological properties on conventional semiconductor platforms. Our findings not only point to a new class of currently unexplored topological systems accessible by epitaxy, but also establish the promise of low-Sn GeSn DAs for application as infrared laser diodes and photodetectors in Si photonic integrated circuits and infrared image sensors.

Title: Phase selection and texturing in molybdenum oxide films grown by reactive magnetron sputtering
Authors: Faezeh A.F. Lahiji, Biplab Paul, Grzegorz Greczynski, Ganpati Ramanath, Arnaud le Febvrier, Per Eklund
Abstract: Molybdenum oxide films offer a rich variety of properties for diverse applications, but exclusive synthesis of desired phases is a major challenge. Here, we demonstrate that oxygen flow ratio fO2 = [O2]/[Ar+O2] is crucial not only for phase selection of non-layered monoclinic MoO2 and layered orthorhombic alpha-MoO3 but also for controlling grain size and preferred orientation. Both mica and sapphire support exclusive MoO2 formation in the 0.15 < fO2 < 0.25 window at deposition temperatures Tdep = 400 and 500 degree C and alpha-MoO3 formation in the 0.35 < fO2 < 0.5 window at 400 degree C. Within fO2 windows favoring exclusive phase formation, high fO2 fosters large grains with out-of-plane 0k0 texture, except for MoO2 films on c-sapphire that show no systematic trends. These findings provide a framework for rational synthesis of phase-pure monoclinic MoO2 and orthorhombic MoO3 with control over texture and microstructure to access desired properties.

Abstract: Photonic technologies continue to drive the quest for new optical materials with unprecedented responses. A major frontier in this field is the exploration of nonlocal (spatially dispersive) materials, going beyond the local, wavevector-independent assumption traditionally made in optical material modeling. On one end, the growing interest in plasmonic, polaritonic and quantum materials has revealed naturally occurring nonlocalities, emphasizing the need for more accurate models to predict and design their optical responses. This has major implications also for topological, nonreciprocal, and time-varying systems based on these material platforms. Beyond natural materials, artificially structured materials--metamaterials and metasurfaces--can provide even stronger and engineered nonlocal effects, emerging from long-range interactions or multipolar effects. This is a rapidly expanding area in the field of photonic metamaterials, with open frontiers yet to be explored. In the case of metasurfaces, in particular, nonlocality engineering has become a powerful tool for designing strongly wavevector-dependent responses, enabling enhanced wavefront control, spatial compression, multifunctional devices, and wave-based computing. Furthermore, nonlocality and related concepts play a critical role in defining the ultimate limits of what is possible in optics, photonics, and wave physics. This Roadmap aims to survey the most exciting developments in nonlocal photonic materials, highlight new opportunities and open challenges, and chart new pathways that will drive this emerging field forward--toward new scientific discoveries and technological advancements.

Title: Inefficiency of orbital Hall effect on the spin torque in transition metal/ferromagnet bilayers
Authors: Yizhuo Song, Jialin Tian, Fanxing Zheng, Jianting Dong, Meng Zhu, Jia Zhang
Abstract: Current induced spin torque is essential and crucial in spintronics. In this work, we systematically investigate the spin torque in transition metal(TM)/ferromagnet(FM) bilayers by using first-principles calculations and taking into account the phonon scattering at room temperature. To examine the spin and orbital Hall contribution, the studied transition metals include 5d heavy metals Pt, W, Au as well as 3d light metals Ti, V, Cr, Cu etc. We found that in TM/CoFe bilayers with typical 3d and 5d transition metals, the spin torque on CoFe mainly originates from spin Hall mechanism with the magnitude and sign of damping like torque efficiency consistent with the spin Hall conductivity. In TM/Ni bilayers, the spin torque is contributed by three mechanisms including spin and orbital Hall current in TM, as well as self-torque in Ni. The orbital Hall contribution in TM is accompanied by noteworthy opposite self spin torque in Ni, which leads to inapparent torque efficiency in Ti/Ni and V/Ni bilayers. For TM(5d heavy metal)/Ni bilayers, the spin torque induced by orbital Hall and self-torque in Ni nearly cancel each other, which makes the spin torque on Ni still align with that of the spin Hall effect in TM. Our work reveals much less efficient contribution of orbital Hall than spin Hall effect on the spin torque in transition metal/ferromagnet bilayers.

Title: Fluctuations of blowup time in a simple model of a super-Malthusian catastrophe

Abstract: Motivated by the paradigm of a super-Maltusian population catastrophe, we study a simple stochastic population model which exhibits a finite-time blowup of the population size and is strongly affected by intrinsic noise. We focus on the fluctuations of the blowup time $T$ in the asexual binary reproduction model $2A \to 3A$, where two identical individuals give birth to a third one. We determine exactly the average blowup time as well as the probability distribution $\mathcal{P}(T)$ of the blowup time and its moments. In particular, we show that the long-time tail $\mathcal{P}(T\to \infty)$ is purely exponential. The short-time tail $\mathcal{P}(T\to 0)$ exhibits an essential singularity at $T=0$, and it is dominated by a single (the most likely) population trajectory which we determine analytically.

Title: Complex Frequency Detection in a Subsystem
Authors: Juntao Huang, Jiangping Hu, Zhesen Yang
Abstract: In this study, we systematically explore the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) and its associated complex-frequency detection in the context of a frequency-dependent non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. This Hamiltonian arises from the self-energy correction of the subsystem and can be calculated exactly within our theoretical model, without the need for any approximations. Additionally, complex frequency detection, which encompasses complex frequency excitation, synthesis, and fingerprint, enables us to detect the physical responses induced by the complex driving frequencies. Our calculations reveal that both complex frequency excitation and synthesis are incompatible with the non-Hermitian approximation and are unable to characterize the presence or abscence of the NHSE. In contrast, the complex-frequency fingerprint successfully detects the novel responses induced by the NHSE through the introduction of a double-frequency Green's function. Our work provides a platform for studying non-Hermitian physics and their novel response in quantum systems rigorously without relying on any approximations.

Title: Exact Results for the Ericson Transition in Stochastic Quantum Scattering and Experimental Validation
Authors: Simon Köhnes, Jiongning Che, Barbara Dietz, Thomas Guhr
Abstract: At lower energies, the resonances in scattering experiments are often isolated. The crucial parameter is the ratio of average resonance width and average mean level spacing. Towards larger energies, this parameter grows, because the resonances overlap. Eventually the cross-section becomes a random function and the scattering matrix elements follow a universal Gaussian distribution. For more than sixty years, this Ericson transition awaits a concise analytical treatment. We provide a complete solution within the Heidelberg approach which provides a full-fledged model of the scattering process. As a side result, we obtain explicit formulae for the moments of the distributions. We compare with microwave experiments.

Title: Stability of Majorana modes in Coulomb-disordered topological insulator nanowires
Authors: Leonard Kaufhold, Achim Rosch
Abstract: We evaluate theoretically the possibility to realize Majorana zero modes in hybrid devices made from topological-insulator (TI) nanowires proximity-coupled to a superconductor. Such systems have been suggested as building blocks of future topological quantum computers, as they have been predicted to realize Majorana zero modes protected by large gaps. A main obstacle is, however, the presence of a relatively large density of charged impurities, $n_\text{imp}\sim 10^{19}$cm$^{-3}$. Based on extensive numerical simulations, we show that the proximity to the superconductor leads to an efficient screening of the disorder potential. By analyzing the Majorana splitting energy, the size of the Andreev gap and the localization of edge modes, we show that robust Majorana modes can be realized for realistic levels of impurity concentrations and wire radii.

Title: Resolving space-time structures of quantum impurities with a numerically-exact algorithm using few-body revealing
Authors: Yuriel Núñez-Fernández, Maxime Debertolis, Serge Florens
Abstract: We introduce a numerically exact real-time evolution scheme for quantum impurities in a macroscopically large bath. The algorithm is few-body revealing, namely it identifies the electronic orbitals that can be made inactive (in a trivial product state) by a time-dependent orbital rotation. Following a quench, we show that both the number of active orbitals and their associated matrix product state bond dimensions saturate to small values, leading to an algorithm dramatically more accurate and faster than the state of the art. We are thus able to follow the dynamics for thousands of fermions, up to the long-time stationary regime, and to study subtle aspects of quantum relaxation in the spatio-temporal domain, such as the emergence of entanglement structures in the Kondo screening cloud.

Title: Electron pairing by dispersive phonons in altermagnets: re-entrant superconductivity and continuous transition to finite momentum superconducting state
Authors: Ivan Iorsh
Abstract: We consider an altermagnet subject to the electron attractive potential mediated by the dispersive phonons. While altermagnetism suppresses superconductivity, scattering of electrons on the Fermi surface by thermal phonons suppresses altermagnetism. We show that this leads to the re-entrant superconductivity over temperature and to the stabilization of the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) finite momentum superconducting state at low temperatures. The effect is mediated by the retardation effects and no d-wave pairing interaction is required.

Title: Content-Addressable Memory with a Content-Free Energy Function
Authors: Félix Benoist, Luca Peliti, Pablo Sartori
Abstract: Content-addressable memory, i.e. stored information that can be retrieved from content-based cues, is key to computation. Besides natural and artificial neural networks, physical learning systems have recently been shown to have remarkable ability in this domain. While classical neural network models encode memories as energy minima, biochemical systems have been shown to be able to process information based on purely kinetic principles. This opens the question of whether neural networks can also encode information kinetically. Here, we propose a minimal model for content-addressable memory in which the kinetics, and not the energy function, are used to encode patterns. We find that the performance of this kinetic encoding approach is comparable to that of classical energy-based encoding schemes. This highlights the fundamental significance of the kinetic stability of kinetic traps as an alternative to the thermodynamic stability of energy minima, offering new insights into the principles of computation in physical and synthetic systems.

Title: Dome-like pressure-temperature phase diagram of the cooperative Jahn--Teller distortion in NaNiO$_2$
Authors: Liam A. V. Nagle-Cocco, James M. A. Steele, Shiyu Deng, Xiaotian Zhang, Dominik Daisenberger, Annalena R. Genreith-Schriever, Siddharth S. Saxena, Clare P. Grey, Si^an E. Dutton
Abstract: NaNiO$_2$ is a Ni$^{3+}$-containing layered material consisting of alternating triangular networks of Ni and Na cations, separated by octahedrally-coordinated O anions. At ambient pressure, it features a collinear Jahn--Teller distortion below $T^\mathrm{JT}_\mathrm{onset}\approx480$ K, which disappears in a first-order transition on heating to $T^\mathrm{JT}_\mathrm{end}\approx500$ K, corresponding to the increase in symmetry from monoclinic to rhombohedral. It was previously studied by variable-pressure neutron diffraction [ACS Inorganic Chemistry 61.10 (2022): 4312-4321] and found to exhibit an increasing $T^\mathrm{JT}_\mathrm{onset}$ with pressure up to ~5 GPa. In this work, powdered NaNiO$_2$ was studied via variable-pressure synchrotron x-ray diffraction up to pressures of ~67 GPa at 294 K and 403 K. Suppression of the collinear Jahn--Teller ordering is observed via the emergence of a high-symmetry rhombohedral phase, with the onset pressure occurring at ~18 GPa at both studied temperatures. Further, a discontinuous decrease in unit cell volume is observed on transitioning from the monoclinic to the rhombohedral phase. These results taken together suggest that in the vicinity of the transition, application of pressure causes the Jahn--Teller transition temperature, $T^\mathrm{JT}_\mathrm{onset}$, to decrease rapidly. We conclude that the pressure-temperature phase diagram of the cooperative Jahn--Teller distortion in NaNiO$_2$ is dome-like.

Title: Defect Engineering in Large-Scale CVD-Grown Hexagonal Boron Nitride: Formation, Spectroscopy, and Spin Relaxation Dynamics

Lupini, Marti Checa, Liam Collins, Huan Zhao, Farzana Likhi, Kai Xiao, Ilia Ivanov, David Glasgow, Alexander Tselev, Benjamin Lawrie, Sergei Smirnov, Steven Randolph
Abstract: Recently, numerous techniques have been reported for generating optically active defects in exfoliated hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), which hold transformative potential for quantum photonic devices. However, achieving on-demand generation of desirable defect types in scalable hBN films remains a significant challenge. Here, we demonstrate that formation of negative boron vacancy defects, VB-, in suspended, large-area CVD-grown hBN is strongly dependent on the type of bombarding particles (ions, neutrons, and electrons) and irradiation conditions. In contrast to suspended hBN, defect formation in substrate-supported hBN is more complex due to the uncontrollable generation of secondary particles from the substrate, and the outcome strongly depends on the thickness of the hBN. We identify different defect types by correlating spectroscopic and optically detected magnetic resonance features, distinguishing boron vacancies (formed by light ions and neutrons) from other optically active defects emitting at 650 nm assigned to anti-site nitrogen vacancy (NBVN) and reveal the presence of additional dark paramagnetic defects that influence spin-lattice relaxation time (T1) and zero-field splitting parameters, all of which strongly depend on the defect density. These results underscore the potential for precisely engineered defect formation in large-scale CVD-grown hBN, paving the way for the scalable fabrication of quantum photonic devices.

Title: Dynamics of one-dimensional spin models via complex-time evolution of tensor networks
Authors: Jeong Hyeok Cha, Hyun-Yong Lee, Heung-Sik Kim
Abstract: Studying the real-time dynamics of strongly correlated systems poses significant challenges, which have recently become more manageable thanks to advances in density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) and tensor network methods. A notable development in this area is the introduction of a complex-time evolution scheme for tensor network states, originally suggested for solving Anderson impurity model and designed to suppress the growth of entanglement under time evolution. In this study, we employ the complex-time evolution scheme to investigate the dynamics of one-dimensional spin systems, specifically the transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) and the XXZ model. Our analysis revisits the dynamic critical exponent $z$ of the TFIM and explores the dynamical structure factor in both gapped and gapless states of the XXZ model. Importantly, the complex-time evolution reproduces the results of real-time evolution while mitigating the rapid growth of quantum entanglement typically associated with the latter. These results demonstrate that the combination of complex-time evolution and extrapolation provides a robust and efficient framework for studying the dynamics of complex quantum systems, enabling more comprehensive insights into their behavior.

Title: Rubber Wear: History, Mechanisms, and Perspectives
Authors: R. Xu, W. Sheng, F. Zhou, B. N. J. Persson
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive review of wear mechanisms, with a primary focus on rubber wear under sliding conditions. Beginning with classical wear theories, including the Archard and Rabinowicz models, we analyze their applicability to both metals and elastomers and discuss extensions relevant to elastic contact and multiscale surface roughness. Various experimental studies on rubber, such as abrasion by sharp tools, erosion by particle impact, and wear during sliding on rough substrates, are reviewed and interpreted. The effects of environmental factors, such as oxygen and lubrication, are also discussed. In addition, we review a recently proposed wear model based on fatigue crack growth within asperity contact regions, which accounts for energy dissipation and multiscale interactions. This model explains the wide variability in the wear coefficient and predicts wear rates consistent with experimental observations across a broad range of conditions. It also explains the formation mechanism and provides the size distribution of rubber wear particles, from micrometer-scale up to severe cut-chip-chunk (CCC) wear. The results have implications for tire wear and the environmental impact of microscale wear debris (microplastics).

Title: Atomic Josephson Parametric Amplifier
Authors: Vijay Pal Singh, Luigi Amico, Ludwig Mathey
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a driven atomic Josephson junction that we propose as a parametric amplifier. By periodically modulating the position of the barrier, we induce a small current across the junction, serving as our input signal. The pump field is implemented by modulating the barrier height at twice the Josephson plasma frequency. The resulting dynamics exhibit parametric amplification of the signal through nonlinear mixing between the signal and pump fields, which is reflected by specific patterns of density waves and phase excitations. We employ a classical-field dynamics method and benchmark our results against driven circuit dynamics. This work paves the way for tunable quantum amplifiers in atomtronic circuits, with potential applications in several fields including precision measurements and quantum information processing.

Title: Phases with non-invertible symmetries in 1+1D $\unicode{x2013}$ symmetry protected topological orders as duality automorphisms
Authors: Ömer M. Aksoy, Xiao-Gang Wen
Abstract: We explore 1+1 dimensional (1+1D) gapped phases in systems with non-invertible symmetries, focusing on symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases (defined as gapped phases with non-degenerate ground states), as well as SPT orders (defined as the differences between gapped/gapless phases with identical bulk excitations spectrum). For group-like symmetries, distinct SPT phases share identical bulk excitations and always differ by SPT orders. However, for certain non-invertible symmetries, we discover novel SPT phases that have different bulk excitations and thus do not differ by SPT orders. Additionally, we also study the spontaneous symmetry-breaking (SSB) phases of non-invertible symmetries. Unlike group-like symmetries, non-invertible symmetries lack the concept of subgroups, which complicates the definition of SSB phases as well as their identification. This challenge can be addressed by employing the symmetry-topological-order (symTO) framework for the symmetry. The Lagrangian condensable algebras and automorphisms of the symTO facilitate the classification of gapped phases in systems with such symmetries, enabling the analysis of both SPT and SSB phases (including those that differ by SPT orders). Finally, we apply this methodology to investigate gapless phases in symmetric systems and to study gapless phases differing by SPT orders.

Title: Free fermions under adaptive quantum dynamics
Authors: Vikram Ravindranath, Zhi-Cheng Yang, Xiao Chen
Abstract: We study free fermion systems under adaptive quantum dynamics consisting of unitary gates and projective measurements followed by corrective unitary operations. We further introduce a classical flag for each site, allowing for an active or inactive status which determines whether or not the unitary gates are allowed to apply. In this dynamics, the individual quantum trajectories exhibit a measurement-induced entanglement transition from critical to area-law scaling above a critical measurement rate, similar to previously studied models of free fermions under continuous monitoring. Furthermore, we find that the corrective unitary operations can steer the system into a state characterized by charge-density-wave order. Consequently, an additional phase transition occurs, which can be observed at both the level of the quantum trajectory and the quantum channel. We establish that the entanglement transition and the steering transition are fundamentally distinct. The latter transition belongs to the parity-conserving (PC) universality class, arising from the interplay between the inherent fermionic parity and classical labelling. We demonstrate both the entanglement and the steering transitions via efficient numerical simulations of free fermion systems, which confirm the PC universality class of the latter.

Title: A Hermitian bypass to the non-Hermitian quantum theory
Authors: Priyanshi Bhasin, Tanmoy Das
Abstract: Describing systems with non-Hermitian (NH) operators remains a challenge in quantum theory due to instabilities (e.g., exceptional points and decoherence) arising from interactions with the environment. We propose a framework to express the energy states of NH Hamiltonians using a well-defined basis (dub computational basis) derived from a related Hermitian operator. This suitably shifts the singularities from the basis states to the expansion coefficients, allowing for their easier mathematical treatment and parametric control. Furthermore, we introduce a `space-time' transformation on the computational basis that defines a generic dual space map for the energy states. Interestingly, this transformation leads to a symmetry for real/imaginary energy values, revealing the existence of weaker condition than hermiticity or the $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry. This leads to clearer understanding and novel interpretations of key features like exceptional points, dual space, and weaker symmetry-enforced real eigenvalues. The applicability of our framework extends to various branches of physics where NH operators manifest as ladder operators, order parameters, self-energies, projectors, and other entities.

Title: The i.i.d. State Convertibility in the Resource Theory of Asymmetry for Finite Groups
Authors: Tomohiro Shitara, Yosuke Mitsuhashi, Hiroyasu Tajima
Abstract: We derive both the exact and approximate conversion rates between i.i.d. pure states under covariant operations in the resource theory of asymmetry for symmetries described by finite groups. We derive the formula for the exact conversion rate, and thereby identifying the relevant set of resource measures. The exact conversion is in general irreversible due to multiple independent resource measures, but we also find the condition for reversibility. On the other hand, we show that the approximate conversion rate either diverges or equals zero, which implies that the asymmetry can be amplified infinitely if we allow a vanishingly small error. We reveal the underlying mechanism of such a counterintuitive phenomenon, by showing the existence of a "uniform state" that acts as a catalysis.

Title: Certifying quantum enhancements in thermal machines beyond the Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation
Authors: José A. Almanza-Marrero, Gonzalo Manzano
Abstract: Quantum coherence has been shown to impact the operational capabilities of quantum systems performing thermodynamic tasks in a significant way, and yet the possibility and conditions for genuine coherence-enhanced thermodynamic operation remain unclear. Introducing a comparison with classical machines using the same set of thermodynamic resources, we show that for steady-state quantum thermal machines -- both autonomous and externally driven -- that interact weakly with thermal reservoirs and work sources, the presence of coherence induced by perturbations in the machine Hamiltonian guarantees a genuine thermodynamic advantage under mild conditions. This advantage applies to both cases where the induced coherence is between levels with different energies or between degenerate levels. On the other hand, we show that engines subjected to noise-induced coherence can be outperformed by classical stochastic engines using exactly the same set of (incoherent) resources. We illustrate our results with three prototypical models of heat engines and refrigerators: the three-level amplifier, the three-qubit autonomous refrigerator, and a noise-induced-coherence machine.

Title: Discrete Time Crystal Phase as a Resource for Quantum Enhanced Sensing
Authors: Rozhin Yousefjani, Krzysztof Sacha, Abolfazl Bayat
Abstract: Discrete time crystals are a special phase of matter in which time translational symmetry is broken through a periodic driving pulse. Here, we first propose and characterize an effective mechanism to generate a stable discrete time crystal phase in a disorder-free many-body system with indefinite persistent oscillations even in finite-size systems. Then we explore the sensing capability of this system to measure the spin exchange coupling. The results show strong quantum-enhanced sensitivity throughout the time crystal phase. As the spin exchange coupling varies, the system goes through a sharp phase transition and enters a non-time crystal phase in which the performance of the probe considerably decreases. We characterize this phase transition as a second-order type and determine its critical properties through a comprehensive finite-size scaling analysis. The performance is independent of the initial states and may even benefit from imperfections in the driving pulse. A simple set of projective measurements can capture the quantum-enhanced sensitivity.

Title: Characterizing dynamical criticality of many-body localization transitions from the Fock-space perspective
Authors: Zheng-Hang Sun, Yong-Yi Wang, Jian Cui, Heng Fan, Markus Heyl
Abstract: Characterizing the nature of many-body localization transitions (MBLTs) and their potential critical behaviors has remained a challenging problem. In this work, we study the dynamics of the displacement, quantifying the spread of the radial probability distribution in the Fock space, for three systems with MBLTs, i.e., the Hamiltonian models with quasiperiodic and random fields, as well as a random-circuit Floquet model of a MBLT. We then perform a finite-size scaling analysis of the long-time averaged displacement by considering two types of ansatz for MBLTs, i.e., continuous and BKT transitions. The data collapse based on the assumption of a continuous phase transition with power-law correlation length reveals that the scaling exponent of the MBLT induced by random field is close to that of the Floquet model, but significantly differes from the quasiperiodic model. Additionally, we find that the BKT-type scaling provides a more accurate description of the MBLTs in the random model and the Floquet model, yielding larger (finite-size) critical points compared to those obtained from power-law scaling. Our work highlights that the displacement is a valuable tool for studying MBLTs, as relevant to ongoing experimental efforts.

Title: Observables in non-Hermitian systems: A methodological comparison
Authors: Karin Sim, Nicolò Defenu, Paolo Molignini, R. Chitra
Abstract: Despite acute interest in the dynamics of non-Hermitian systems, there is a lack of consensus in the mathematical formulation of non-Hermitian quantum mechanics in the community. Different methodologies are used in the literature to study non-Hermitian dynamics. This ranges from consistent frameworks like biorthogonal quantum mechanics and metric approach characterized by modified inner products, to normalization by time-dependent norms inspired by open quantum systems. In this work, we systematically explore the similarities and differences among these various methods. Utilizing illustrative models with exact solutions, we demonstrate that these methods produce not only quantitatively different results but also distinct physical interpretations. For dissipative systems where non-Hermiticity arises as an approximation, we find that simply dividing by the norm in the $\mathcal{PT}$-broken regime closely aligns with the full master equation solutions. In contrast, for quantum systems where non-Hermiticity can be engineered exactly, incorporating metric dynamics is crucial for the probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics, necessitating the generalizations of similarity transformations and unitarity to non-Hermitian systems. This study lays the groundwork for further exploration of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, potentially leveraging generalized transformations for novel physical phenomena.

Title: Highly entangled stationary states from strong symmetries
Authors: Yahui Li, Frank Pollmann, Nicholas Read, Pablo Sala
Abstract: We find that the presence of strong non-Abelian conserved quantities can lead to highly entangled stationary states even for unital quantum channels. We derive exact expressions for the bipartite logarithmic negativity, Rényi negativities, and operator space entanglement for stationary states restricted to one symmetric subspace, with focus on the trivial subspace. We prove that these apply to open quantum evolutions whose commutants, characterizing all strongly conserved quantities, correspond to either the universal enveloping algebra of a Lie algebra or to the Read-Saleur commutants. The latter provides an example of quantum fragmentation, whose dimension is exponentially large in system size. We find a general upper bound for all these quantities given by the logarithm of the dimension of the commutant on the smaller bipartition of the chain. As Abelian examples, we show that strong U($1$) symmetries and classical fragmentation lead to separable stationary states in any symmetric subspace. In contrast, for non-Abelian SU$(N)$ symmetries, both logarithmic and Rényi negativities scale logarithmically with system size. Finally, we prove that while Rényi negativities with $n>2$ scale logarithmically with system size, the logarithmic negativity (as well as generalized Rényi negativities with $n<2$) exhibits a volume law scaling for the Read-Saleur commutants. Our derivations rely on the commutant possessing a Hopf algebra structure in the limit of infinitely large systems, and hence also apply to finite groups and quantum groups.

Title: Size-dependent second-order-like phase transitions in Fe nanocluster melting from low-temperature structural isomerization
Authors: Louis E.S. Hoffenberg, Alexander Khrabry, Yuri Barsukov, Igor D. Kaganovich, David B. Graves
Abstract: In this work, the melting phase transitions of $Fe_{n}$ nanoclusters with $10 \leq n \leq 100$ atoms are investigated using classical many-body molecular dynamics simulations. For many cluster sizes, surface melting occurs at much lower temperatures than core melting. Surface and core melting points, and energetic melting points (temperatures of maximum heat capacity, $C_v$) are calculated for all cluster sizes. Melting properties are found to be strong functions of cluster structure. Cluster sizes with closed-shell structures always have first-order-like phase transitions. Almost one-third of cluster sizes in the analyzed range exhibit second-order-like phase transitions due to the presence of multiple structural configurations close in energy. 1-shell clusters with one to a few more atoms than a neighboring closed-shell structure have very low surface melting points and very high energetic melting points compared to their closed-shell counterparts. In clusters above 50 atoms with certain core structures, melting of the surface before the core was observed.

Title: Non-perturbative Discrete Spectrum of Interior Length and Timeshift in Two-sided Black Hole
Authors: Masamichi Miyaji
Abstract: We study the spectrum of the interior length and the horizon timeshift of a two-sided black hole by constructing non-perturbative length and timeshift operators in Jackiew-Teitelboim gravity. We first construct projection operators onto the fixed length or fixed horizon timeshift subspaces using the replica trick. We calculate the densities of state for the length and the timeshift, which are found to be finite. This finiteness implies the discreteness in the spectrum of these quantities. We then construct the non-perturbative length and timeshift operators, and apply them to study the time evolution of the two-sided black hole. We find that at early time, the probability distribution of the interior length and the timeshift are sharply peaked at the classical values, while after the Heisenberg time, the distribution is completely uniform over all possible values of the length and the timeshift, indicating maximal uncertainty. In particular, the probability of having the negative timeshift states, which corresponds to the white hole probability, is $O(1)$ after the Heisenberg time.

Title: Experimental Investigation of Variations in Polycrystalline Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO)-based MFIM
Authors: Tae Ryong Kim, Revanth Koduru, Zehao Lin, Peide. D. Ye, Sumeet Kumar Gupta
Abstract: Device-to-device variations in ferroelectric (FE) hafnium oxide (HfO2)-based devices pose a crucial challenge that limits the otherwise promising capabilities of this technology. Although previous simulation-based studies have identified polarization (P) domain nucleation and polycrystallinity as key contributors to variations in HfO2, experimental validation remains limited. Here, we experimentally investigate variations in remanent polarization (PR) of Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO)-based metal-ferroelectric-insulator-metal (MFIM) capacitors across different set voltages (VSET) and FE thicknesses (TFE). Our measurements reveal a non-monotonic behavior of the standard deviation of PR with VSET peaking around coercive voltage (VC), which is consistent with previous simulation-based predictions. In the low- and high-VSET regions, PR variations are primarily dictated by saturation polarization (PS) variations, mainly originating from charge trap effects at the interface between the FE-dielectric (DE) layer and the polycrystallinity of FE. On the other hand, in the mid-VSET region peak, the PR variations are attributed to the VC variation, which comes from a combined effect of multi-domain (MD) P switching and polycrystallinity. Notably, sharp P switching associated with domain nucleation amplifies the variations, resulting in a peak of PR variations in this VSET range. Further, we observe that as HZO thickness (TFE) is scaled, the non-monotonicity in variations with VSET is reduced, primarily due to reduced domain nucleation and smaller grain sizes. We experimentally establish a strong correlation of PR with PS in the low- and high-VSET regions and with VC in the mid-VSET region across various TFE. Finally, our experimental findings are corroborated with simulations using a 3D phase-field model.

Title: Tunable two-species spin models with Rydberg atoms in circular and elliptical states
Authors: Jacek Dobrzyniecki, Paula Heim, Michał Tomza
Abstract: We propose a scheme for constructing versatile quantum simulators using ultracold Rydberg atoms in long-lived circular and elliptical states. By exciting different subspaces of internal atomic states, the atoms can be used to simulate two effective spin species with different spin-spin interactions. The strengths of transverse and longitudinal spin-spin interactions, both intra- and inter-species, can be controlled within a wide range of values. This setup can be used to simulate two-species spin models or lattice models with two sublattices. We show examples of specific models which can be realized.

Title: Synchronized motion of gold nanoparticles in an optothermal trap
Authors: Ashutosh Shukla, Rahul Chand, Sneha Boby, G. V. Pavan Kumar
Abstract: Optical tweezers have revolutionized particle manipulation at the micro- and nanoscale, playing a critical role in fields such as plasmonics, biophysics, and nanotechnology. While traditional optical trapping methods primarily rely on optical forces to manipulate and organize particles, recent studies suggest that optothermal traps in surfactant solutions can induce unconventional effects such as enhanced trapping stiffness and increased diffusion. Thus, there is a need for further exploration of this system to gain a deeper understanding of the forces involved. This work investigates the behaviour of gold nanoparticles confined in an optothermal trap around a heated anchor particle in a surfactant (CTAC) solution. We observe unexpected radial confinement and synchronized rotational diffusion of particles at micrometre-scale separations from the anchor particle. These dynamics differ from known optical binding and thermophoretic effects, suggesting unexplored forces facilitated by the surfactant environment. This study expands the understanding of optothermal trapping driven by anchor plasmonic particles and introduces new possibilities for nanoparticle assembly, offering insights with potential applications in nanoscale fabrication and materials science.

Title: Effective Medium Theory for Time-modulated Subwavelength Resonators
Authors: Habib Ammari, Jinghao Cao, Erik Orvehed Hiltunen, Liora Rueff
Abstract: This paper provides a general framework for deriving effective material properties of one-dimensional time-modulated systems of subwavelength resonators. It applies to subwavelength resonator systems with a general form of time-dependent parameters. We show that the resonators can be accurately described by a point-scattering formulation when the width of the resonators is small. In contrast to the static setting, where this point interaction approximation yields a Lippmann-Schwinger equation for the effective material properties, the mode coupling in the time-modulated case instead yields an infinite linear system of Lippmann-Schwinger-type equations. The effective equations can equivalently be written as a system of differential equations. Moreover, we introduce a numerical scheme to approximately solve the system of coupled equations and illustrate the validity of the effective equation.

Title: Engineering-Oriented Design of Drift-Resilient MTJ Random Number Generator via Hybrid Control Strategies

Abstract: Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (MTJs) have shown great promise as hardware sources for true random number generation (TRNG) due to their intrinsic stochastic switching behavior. However, practical deployment remains challenged by drift in switching probability caused by thermal fluctuations, device aging, and environmental instability. This work presents an engineering-oriented, drift-resilient MTJ-based TRNG architecture, enabled by a hybrid control strategy that combines self-stabilizing feedback with pulse width modulation. A key component is the Downcalibration-2 scheme, which updates the control parameter every two steps using only integer-resolution timing, ensuring excellent statistical quality without requiring bit discarding, pre-characterization, or external calibration. Extensive experimental measurements and numerical simulations demonstrate that this approach maintains stable randomness under dynamic temperature drift, using only simple digital logic. The proposed architecture offers high throughput, robustness, and scalability, making it well-suited for secure hardware applications, embedded systems, and edge computing environments.

Title: Digital Simulation of Non-Abelian Parafermions in Superconducting Circuits
Authors: Hong-Yu Wang, Xiong-Jun Liu
Abstract: Parafermions, which can be viewed as a fractionalized version of Majorana modes, exhibit profound non-Abelian statistics and emerge in topologically ordered systems, while their realization in experiment has been challenging. Here we propose an experimental scheme for the digital simulation of parafermions and their non-Abelian braiding statistics in superconducting (SC) circuits by realizing the $\mathbb{Z}_d$ plaquette model on a two-dimensional lattice. Two protocols using quantum circuits and non-destructive measurements are introduced to prepare the ground state, on which parafermion pairs are created by engineering dislocations. We then propose a generalized code deformation approach to realize the fusion and non-Abelian braiding of parafermion modes, and show the application of this approach to the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermions. We also examine the experimental parameter regime to confirm the feasibility of our scheme in SC devices. This work extends previous quantum simulation of twist defects in SC qubits to qudit systems, and opens up a way for parafermion-based high-dimensional topological quantum computing with experimental feasibility.

Title: Direct comparison of stochastic driven nonlinear dynamical systems for combinatorial optimization
Authors: Junpeng Hou, Amin Barzegar, Helmut G. Katzgraber
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are ubiquitous in industrial applications. However, finding optimal or close-to-optimal solutions can often be extremely hard. Because some of these problems can be mapped to the ground-state search of the Ising model, tremendous effort has been devoted to developing solvers for Ising-type problems over the past decades. Recent advances in controlling and manipulating both quantum and classical systems have enabled novel computing paradigms such as quantum simulators and coherent Ising machines to tackle hard optimization problems. Here, we examine and benchmark several physics-inspired optimization algorithms, including coherent Ising machines, gain-dissipative algorithms, simulated bifurcation machines, and Hopfield neural networks, which we collectively refer to as stochastic-driven nonlinear dynamical systems. Most importantly, we benchmark these algorithms against random Ising problems with planted solutions and compare them to simulated annealing as a baseline leveraging the same software stack for all solvers. We further study how different numerical integration techniques and graph connectivity affect performance. This work provides an overview of a diverse set of new optimization paradigms.

Title: Quantum decoherence in the Caldeira-Leggett model by the real-time path integral on a computer
Authors: Jun Nishimura, Hiromasa Watanabe
Abstract: We propose first-principle calculations of an open system based on the real-time path integral formalism treating the environment as well as the system of our interest together on a computer. The sign problem that occurs in applying Monte Carlo methods can be overcome in general by using the so-called Lefschetz thimble method, which has been developed over the past decade. Here we focus on the Caldeira-Leggett model, which is well known, in particular, as a model of quantum decoherence. In this case, the calculation simplifies drastically since the path integral becomes Gaussian for typical initial conditions. The relevant saddle point, which is unique and complex, can be determined by solving a linear equation with a huge but sparse coefficient matrix, and the integration over the Lefschetz thimble can be performed analytically. Thus we obtain, without assumptions or approximations, the reduced density matrix after a long-time evolution, tracing out a large number of harmonic oscillators in the environment. In particular, we confirm the dependence of the decoherence time on the coupling constant and the temperature that has been predicted from the master equation in a certain parameter regime.
