Title: Volatile and Nonvolatile Resistive Switching in Lateral 2D Molybdenum Disulfide-Based Memristive Devices
Authors: Sofía Cruces, Mohit D. Ganeriwala, Jimin Lee, Ke Ran, Janghyun Jo, Lukas Völkel, Dennis Braun, Bárbara Canto, Enrique G. Marín, Holger Kalisch, Michael Heuken, Andrei Vescan, Rafal Dunin-Borkowski, Joachim Mayer, Andrés Godoy, Alwin Daus, Max C. Lemme
Abstract: Developing electronic devices capable of emulating biological functions is essential for advancing brain-inspired computation paradigms such as neuromorphic computing. In recent years, two-dimensional materials have emerged as promising candidates for neuromorphic electronic devices. This work addresses the coexistence of volatile and nonvolatile resistive switching in lateral memristors based on molybdenum disulfide with silver as the active electrode. The fabricated devices exhibited switching voltages of ~0.16 V and ~0.52 V for volatile and nonvolatile operation, respectively, under direct-current measurements. They also displayed the essential synaptic functions of paired-pulse facilitation and short- and long-term plasticity under pulse stimulation. The operation mechanism was investigated by in-situ transmission electron microscopy, which showed lateral migration of silver ions along the molybdenum disulfide between electrodes. Based on the experimental data, a macroscopic semi-classical electron transport model was used to reproduce the current-voltage characteristics and support the proposed underlying switching mechanisms.

Title: Unraveling the dynamics of conductive filaments in MoS${_2}$ based memristors by operando transmission electron microscopy
Authors: Ke Ran, Janghyun Jo, Sofía Cruces, Zhenxing Wang, Rafal E. Dunin-Borkowski, Joachim Mayer, Max C. Lemme
Abstract: Advanced operando transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques enable the observation of nanoscale phenomena in electrical devices during operation. They can be used to study the switching mechanisms in two-dimensional (2D) materials-based memristive devices, which is crucial to tailor their operating regimes and improve reliability and variability. Here, we investigate lateral memristive devices composed of 2D layered molybdenum disulfide (MoS${_2}$) with palladium (Pd) and silver (Ag) electrodes. We visualized the formation and migration of Ag conductive filaments (CFs) between the two electrodes under external bias voltage and their complete dissolution upon reversing the bias voltage polarity. The CFs exhibited a wide range of sizes, ranging from several Ångströms to tens of nanometers, and followed diverse pathways: along the MoS${_2}$ surfaces, within the van der Waals gap between MoS${_2}$ layers, and through the spacing between MoS${_2}$ bundles. Notably, the Ag electrode functioned as a reservoir for the CFs, as evidenced by the shrinking and growing of the Ag electrode upon switching. Our method enabled correlating the current-voltage responses with real-time TEM imaging, offering insights into failed and anomalous switching behavior, and providing clarity on the cycle-to-cycle variabilities. Our findings provide solid evidence for the electrochemical metallization mechanism, elucidate the formation dynamics of CFs, and reveal key parameters influencing the switching performance. Our approach can be extended to investigate similar memristive devices.

Title: Exchange interactions in itinerant magnets: the effects of local particle-hole irreducible vertex corrections and SU(2) symmetry of Hund interaction
Authors: A. A. Katanin
Abstract: We study exchange interactions in iron and nickel within the DFT+DMFT approach with density-density and SU(2) symmetric Coulomb interaction. In particular, we analyze the representation of exchange interactions through the non-local part of the particle-hole bubble, supplemented by the local particle-hole (ph) irreducible interaction vertices. The neglect of the local ph-irreducible vertex corrections, suggested previously within the dual fermion approach [E. A. Stepanov, this http URL., Phys. Rev. Lett. 121, 037204 (2018)], yields the result, corresponding to generalization of the magnetic force theorem approach. While we argue that these vertex corrections are not important for strong localized magnets, such as iron, they become more essential for weak itinerant magnets, such as nickel. At the same time, the account of the full local vertex and self-energy corrections in the renormalized approach is essential for iron, and less important for nickel. The difference of the results of density-density and SU(2) symmetric Coulomb interaction is found relatively small, in contrast to the Curie temperature and the value of the local magnetic moment.

Title: Exciton fractional Chern insulators in moiré heterostructures
Authors: Raul Perea-Causin, Hui Liu, Emil J. Bergholtz
Abstract: Moiré materials have emerged as a powerful platform for exploring exotic quantum phases. While recent experiments have unveiled fractional Chern insulators exhibiting the fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect based on electrons or holes, the exploration of analogous many-body states with bosonic constituents remains largely uncharted. In this work, we predict the emergence of bosonic fractional Chern insulators arising from long-lived excitons in a moiré superlattice formed by twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ stacked on monolayer MoSe$_2$. Performing exact diagonalization on the exciton flat Chern band present in this structure, we establish the existence of Abelian and non-Abelian phases at band filling $\frac{1}{2}$ and $1$, respectively, through multiple robust signatures including ground-state degeneracy, spectral flow, many-body Chern number, and particle-cut entanglement spectrum. The obtained energy gap of $\sim 10$ meV for the Abelian states suggests a remarkably high stability of this phase. Our findings not only introduce a highly tunable and experimentally accessible platform for investigating bosonic fractional Chern insulators but also open a new pathway for realizing non-Abelian anyons.

Title: Influence of the particle morphology on the spray characteristics in low-pressure cold gas process
Authors: Y. Sinnwell, A. Maksakov, S. Palis, S. Antonyuk
Abstract: This study investigates the influence of particle morphology on spray characteristics in low-pressure cold gas spraying (LPCGS) by analyzing three copper powders with distinct shapes and microstructures. A comprehensive morphology analysis was conducted using both 2D and 3D imaging techniques. Light microscopy combined with image processing quantified particle circularity in 2D projections, while X-ray micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) enabled precise 3D reconstructions to determine sphericity, surface area, and volume distributions. The results showed significant variations in the particle morphology of the investigated feedstock copper powders, with irregularly shaped particles exhibiting lower circularity and sphericity compared to more spherical feedstocks. These morphological differences had a direct impact on the particle velocity distributions and spatial dispersion within the spray jet, as measured by high-speed particle image velocimetry. Irregular particles experienced stronger acceleration and exhibited a more focused spray dispersion, whereas spherical particles reached lower maximum velocities and showed a wider dispersion in the jet. These findings highlight the critical role of particle morphology in optimization of cold spray processes for advanced coating and additive manufacturing applications.

Title: A machine learning approach to fast thermal equilibration
Authors: Diego Rengifo, Gabriel Tellez, Gabriel Téllez
Abstract: We present a method to design driving protocols that achieve fast thermal equilibration of a system of interest using techniques inspired by machine learning training algorithms. For example, consider a Brownian particle manipulated by optical tweezers. The force on the particle can be controlled and adjusted over time, resulting in a driving protocol that transitions the particle from an initial state to a final state. Once the driving protocol has been completed, the system requires additional time to relax to thermal equilibrium. Designing driving protocols that bypass the relaxation period is of interest so that, at the end of the protocol, the system is either in thermal equilibrium or very close to it. Several studies have addressed this problem through reverse engineering methods, which involve prescribing a specific evolution for the probability density function of the system and then deducing the corresponding form of the driving protocol potential. Here, we propose a new method that can be applied to more complex systems where reverse engineering is not feasible. We simulate the evolution of a large ensemble of trajectories while tracking the gradients with respect to a parametrization of the driving protocol. The final probability density function is compared to the target equilibrium one. Using machine learning libraries, the gradients are computed via backpropagation and the protocol is iteratively adjusted until the optimal protocol is achieved. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with several examples.

Title: Ultrafast dynamics of ferroelectric polarization of NbOI$_{2}$ captured with femtosecond electron diffraction
Authors: Yibo Wang, Md Sazzad Hossain, Tianlin Li, Yanwei Xiong, Cuong Le, Jesse Kuebler, Nina Raghavan, Lucia Fernandez-Ballester, Xia Hong, Alexander Sinitskii, Martin Centurion
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectric materials like NbOI$_{2}$ have garnered significant interest, yet their temporal response and synergetic interaction with light remain underexplored. Previous studies on the polarization of oxide ferroelectrics have relied on time-resolved optical second harmonic generation or ultrafast X-ray scattering. Here, we probe the laser-induced polarization dynamics of 2D NbOI$_{2}$ nanocrystals using ultrafast transmission electron diffraction and deflectometry. The deflection of the electron pulses is directly sensitive to the changes in the polarization, while the diffraction signal captures the structural evolution. Excited with a UV laser pulse, the polarization of NbOI$_{2}$ is initially suppressed for two picoseconds, then it recovers and overshoots, leading to a transiently enhanced polarization persisting for over 200 ps. This recovery coincides with coherent acoustic phonon generation, triggering a piezoresponse in the NbOI$_{2}$ nanocrystals. Our results offer a new method for sensing the ferroelectric order parameter in femtosecond time scales.

Title: Fringe around a Beet Slice: Wetting-induced Dimple in a Thin Liquid Film
Authors: Zhengyang Liu, Kunal Kumar, Yicong Fu, Abhradeep Maitra, Justin Chen, Sunghwan Jung
Abstract: When a slice of beet is placed on a plate with a thin layer of beet juice, one can observe a clear fringe around the beet, where the color is more translucent than the rest of the juice. The hypotheses in literature were inconsistent and limited, which motivated us to revisit this phenomenon. Using a motorized confocal displacement sensor, we measured the temporal evolution of the liquid surface profile across the fringe. Our findings suggest that a suction flow, induced by the capillary rise of the contact line, causes a dimple - a small concave depression - to form on the liquid surface. While surface tension and gravity tends to smooth out the dimple, viscous drag acts against them if the liquid film is sufficiently thin. Our scaling analysis correctly estimates the dependence of dimple lifetime on liquid properties and film thickness. We also capture the dimple formation dynamics by numerically solving the lubrication equation with the Young-Laplace equation. This work provides a new interpretation for a common phenomenon.

Title: Band gap tuning by structural phase transition in Sm-substituted BiFeO3 powders
Authors: Christina Hill, Michele Melchiorre, Cosme Milesi-Brault, Pascale Gemeiner, Fabienne Karolak, Christine Bogicevic, Brahim Dkhil, Ingrid Canero-Infante, Mael Guennou
Abstract: The substitution of bismuth by samarium in BiFeO3 is known to induce a structural phase transition from the polar phase to a non-polar phase, with a possible antiferroelectric intermediate structure. In this paper, we investigate the impact of this phase change on the optical properties. The optical band gap was measured by diffuse reflectance as a function of temperature for several samarium concentrations across the structural phase transition. We found that the optical band gap for each of the pure phases varies linearly with temperature and that the phase transitions are revealed by smooth transitions between those linear regimes. This allows us to quantify the contribution of the structural change in the optical absorption. We find that a difference in optical band gap of about 130meV can be attributed to the phase change. We anticipate that the same change could be obtained by applying an electric field in an antiferroelectric composition.

Title: Spin Qubit Properties of the Boron-Vacancy/Carbon Defect in the Two-Dimensional Hexagonal Boron Nitride
Authors: Sergey Stolbov, Marisol Alcántara Ortigoza
Abstract: Spin qubit defects in two-dimensional materials have a number of advantages over those in three-dimensional hosts including simpler technologies for the defect creation and control, as well as qubit accessibility. In this work, we select the VBCB defect in the hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) as a possible optically controllable spin qubit and explain its triplet ground state and neutrality. In this defect a boron vacancy is combined with a carbon dopant substituting the closest boron atom to the vacancy. Our density-functional-theory calculations confirmed that the system has dynamically stable spin triplet and singlet ground states. As revealed from our linear response GW calculations, the spin-sensitive electronic states are localized around the three undercoordinated N atoms and make local peaks in the density of electronic states within the bandgap. Using the triplet and singlet ground state energies, as well as the energies of the optically excited states, obtained from solution to the Bethe-Salpeter equation, we construct the spin-polarization cycle, which is found to be favorable for the spin qubit initialization. The calculated zero-field splitting parameters ensure that the splitting energy between the spin projections in the triplet ground state is comparable to that of the known spin qubits. We thus propose the VBCB defect in hBN as a promising spin qubit.

Title: Two-dimensional perovskites with maximum symmetry enable exciton diffusion length exceeding 2 micrometers
Authors: Jin Hou, Jared Fletcher, Siedah J. Hall, Hao Zhang, Marios Zacharias, George Volonakis, Claire Welton, Faiz Mandani, Isaac Metcalf, Shuo Sun, Bo Zhang, Yinsheng Guo, G. N. Manjunatha Reddy, Claudine Katan, Jacky Even, Matthew Y. Sfeir, Mercouri G. Kanatzidis, Aditya D. Mohite
Abstract: Realizing semiconductors with high symmetry of their crystallographic structures has been a virtue of inorganic materials and has resulted in novel physical behaviors. In contrast, hybrid (organic and inorganic) crystals such as two-dimensional metal halide perovskites exhibit much lower crystal symmetry due to in-plane or out of plane octahedral distortions. Despite their amazing ability for photoinduced light emission at room temperature, the Achilles' heel of this attractive class of 2D materials for optoelectronics remains the poor control and lack of performance for charge carrier transport. Inspired by the tremendous charge carrier properties of the 3D cubic perovskite phase of FAPbI3 and combining the use of the appropriate cage cation, the spacer molecule and the temperature and rate of crystallization, we report a new series of FA-based layered two-dimensional perovskites that exhibits the highest theoretically predicted symmetry with a tetragonal P4/mmm space group, resulting in no octahedral distortion in both in-plane and out-of-plane directions. These 2D perovskites present the shortest interlayer distances (4 angstrom), which results in systematically lower bandgaps (1.7 to 1.8 eV). Finally, the absence of octahedral distortions, results in an exciton diffusion length of 2.5 {\mu}m, and a diffusivity of 4.4 cm2s-1, both of which are an order of magnitude larger compared to previously reported 2D perovskites and on par with monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides.

Title: Normal state and superconducting state properties of high entropy Ta0.2Nb0.2V0.2Ti0.2X0.2 (X = Zr and Hf )
Authors: Nikita Sharma, J. Link, Kuldeep Kargeti, Neha Sharma, I. Heinmaa, S. K. Panda, R. Stern, Tirthankar Chakraborty, Tanmoy Chakrabarty, Sourav Marik
Abstract: High entropy alloy superconductors represent a unique blend of advanced material systems and quantum physics, offering significant potential for advancing superconducting technologies. In this study, we report a detailed theoretical and experimental investigation of high entropy alloy superconductors Ta0.2Nb0.2V0.2Ti0.2X0.2 (X = Zr and Hf). Our study unveils that both the materials crystallize in a body-centered cubic structure (space group: I m -3 m) and exhibit bulk superconductivity with a superconducting onset temperature of (Tonset C ) of 5 K for X = Hf and 6.19 K for X = Zr sample. Our detailed analysis, including magnetization, resistivity, heat capacity measurements, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicates moderately coupled isotropic s-wave superconductivity in these materials. Our DFT results find significant spectral weight at the Fermi energy and phonon spectra is free of imaginary modes, confirming the dynamical stability and metallic nature of these alloys. Remarkably, we have observed a high upper critical field (HC2(0)) surpassing the Pauli paramagnetic limit for the X = Hf sample and explained it on the basis of the increased spin-orbit coupling in the structure. Ta0.2Nb0.2V0.2Ti0.2Zr0.2, on the other hand, shows a conventional HC2 behaviour. With the dynamical stability of these alloys, excellent normal state metallic nature, high micro-hardness, and high upper critical field, these samples emerge as potential candidates for future applications in superconducting devices.

Title: Symmetry-Projected Spin-AGP Methods Applied to Spin Systems
Authors: Zhiyuan Liu, Thomas M. Henderson, Gustavo E. Scuseria
Abstract: Symmetry-projected wave function methods capture static correlation by breaking and restoring the symmetries of a system. In this article, we present the symmetry-projected spin antisymmetrized geminal power (spin-AGP) state projected onto space group symmetry as well as complex conjugation, spin-flip, and time-reversal symmetries. The method is benchmarked on the 1D XXZ model and 2D $\mathrm{J_1-J_2}$ model with square and triangular lattices. Our results indicate that symmetry projection methods provide a powerful tool for frustrated spin systems.

Title: Structural Control of Atomic Silicon Wires

Leon (1), Taras Chutora (1), Max Yuan (1), Roshan Achal (2), Lucian Livadaru (1), Jason Pitters (3), Robert Wolkow (1 and 2) ((1) University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada, (2) Quantum Silicon Inc., Edmonton, Canada, (3) National Research Council of Canada, Edmonton, Canada)
Abstract: Bare Si(100)-2$\times$1 surface atoms exhibit a buckled structure where one Si atom in a dimer is lowered while the other is raised, leading to two possible buckling configurations equivalent in energy. The relatively low energy barrier between these configurations allows dimers to flip rapidly and uncontrollably unless stabilized by surface defects or observed at low temperatures due to reduced thermal energy using Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM). This rapid flipping results in a time-averaged symmetric appearance under STM. In this study, we investigated variable length buckled dimer wires on the hydrogenated Si(100) surface composed of silicon dangling bonds for the first time. We demonstrate that on degenerate p-type silicon at 4.5 K, the rapid switching of these dimers can be frozen at low scanning biases. It is shown that the stability of a fixed buckled configuration increases with wire length. Such buckled wires can however be controllably flipped using a bias pulse. A line as long as 37 dimers was repeatedly uniformly flipped by a single pulse delivered near one terminus of the wire. The tip-directed flipping of a particular wire does not switch adjacent wires, suggesting binary wires can make well isolated rewritable binary memory elements. Furthermore, at sufficiently high biases switching generates telegraph noise that could be of utility for random number generation. The integration and encapsulation of these wires with previously described silicon dangling bond-made logic gates and binary wires might allow for self contained actuation and readout without requiring any role of an STM tip.

Title: Light-Induced Spin Slanting in 2D Multiferroic Magnet
Authors: Jiangyu Zhao, Yangyang Feng, Kaiying Dou, Xinru Li, Ying Dai, Baibiao Huang, Yandong Ma
Abstract: Controlling spin orientation of two-dimensional (2D) materials has emerged as a frontier of condensed-matter physics, resulting in the discovery of various phases of matter. However, in most cases, spin orientation can be stablished only at specific directions of out-of-plane and in-plane, which is a drawback compared with three-dimensional systems, limiting exploration of novel physics. Here, we introduce a methodology for manipulating spin slanting in 2D multiferroic materials through ultrafast pulses of light. Based on model analysis, we find that simultaneous triggering spin-orbit coupling induced interactions from in-plane and out-of-plane orbitals can generate spin slanting. By choosing 2D multiferroic materials with specific low-energy composition endowed by symmetry, such triggering can be readily achieved through ultrafast light illumination, leading to light-induced spin slanting. Using real-time time-dependent density-functional theory, we demonstrate this approach in multiferroic single-layer CuCr2Se4. This study provides an efficient way to manipulate spin orientation in 2D materials and establishes a general platform to explore physics and applications associated with spin slanting.

Title: Anomalous Hall Effect in Type IV 2D Collinear Magnets
Authors: Ling Bai, Run-Wu Zhang, Wanxiang Feng, Yugui Yao
Abstract: We identify a previously unrecognized class of two-dimensional (2D) collinear magnetic phase that extends beyond the established categories of ferromagnets, antiferromagnets, and altermagnets. These type IV 2D collinear magnets exhibit spin-degenerate bands in the nonrelativistic limit, yet support time-reversal symmetry-breaking responses, such as the anomalous Hall effect (AHE), despite having zero net magnetization. Based on spin layer group analysis, we derive the symmetry criteria for this phase and perform first-principles calculations to screen viable candidate materials from 2D databases. Using monolayer Hf2S as a prototype, we demonstrate that in the absence of spin-orbit coupling, the bands are spin degenerate, while its inclusion induce an AHE driven by spin-polarized and even spin-neutral currents, accompanied by a symmetry-protected, truly full-space persistent spin texture. These findings expand the classification of magnetic phases and broaden avenues for realizing unconventional spintronic functionalities in two dimensions.

Title: Contrasting Light-Induced Spin Torque in Antiferromagnetic and Altermagnetic Systems
Authors: J. Zhou, C. Zhang
Abstract: Light-matter interaction has become one of the promising routes to manipulating various physical feature of quantum materials in an ultrafast kinetics. In this work, we focus on the nonlinear optical effects of the spintronic behavior in antiferromagnetic (AFM) and altermagnetic (AM) systems with compensated magnetic moments, which has been extensively attractive for their potential applications. With vanishing net magnetic moments, one of the main concerns is how to distinguish and disentangle AFMs and AMs in experiments, as they usually behave similarly in many susceptibility measurements. To address this challenge, we propose that linearly polarized light could trigger contrasting nonequilibrium local spin torques in these systems, unravelling hidden light-induced spintronic behaviors. In general, one could achieve light-induced spin canting in AMs, while only Neel vector torques in AFMs. We scrutinize and enumerate their symmetry constraints of all 122 magnetic point groups. We also adopt low energy Hamiltonian models and first-principles calculations on two representative materials to illustrate our theory. Our work provides a new perspective for the design and optimization of spintronic devices.

Title: Laser-driven solid-state synthesis of high-entropy oxides
Authors: Peng wei, Yiwen Liu, Hao Bai, Lei Zhuang, Hulei Yu, Yanhui Chu
Abstract: The vast compositional and structural landscape of high-entropy oxides (HEOs) grants them a wide range of potentially valuable physicochemical properties. However, the elemental immiscibility and crystal complexity limit their controllable synthesis. Here, we report a laser-driven solid-state synthesis technique that enables high-throughput production of HEOs with different crystal structures, including rock-salt, perovskite, spinel, fluorite, pyrochlore, tantalate, and silicate, incorporating up to 20 cationic elements. Typically, we successfully synthesize all types of high-entropy rare-earth disilicates (HEREDs), including A-, {\alpha}-, \b{eta}-, {\gamma}-, {\delta}-, F-, and G-type phase structures, with up to 15 rare-earth elements in the A site and 5 transition-metal elements in the B site. Benefiting from their unique G-type phase structure and 20-cation composition, HEREDs are endowed with the new functionality of microwave absorption (effective absorption bandwidth of 4.3 GHz). Our work not only realizes the controllable synthesis of HEOs with vast compositional and structural space but also offers them new physicochemical properties, making them highly promising for a diverse array of structural and functional applications.

Title: Determining 3D atomic coordinates of light-element quantum materials using ptychographic electron tomography
Authors: Na Yeon Kim, Hanfeng Zhong, Jianhua Zhang, Colum M. O'Leary, Yuxuan Liao, Ji Zou, Haozhi Sha, Minh Pham, Weiyi Li, Yakun Yuan, Ji-Hoon Park, Dennis Kim, Huaidong Jiang, Jing Kong, Miaofang Chi, Jianwei Miao
Abstract: Understanding quantum materials at the atomic scale requires precise 3D characterization of atomic positions and crystal defects. However, resolving the 3D structure of light-element materials (Z <= 8) remains a major challenge due to their low contrast and beam damage in electron microscopy. Here, we demonstrate ptychographic atomic electron tomography (pAET), achieving sub-angstrom 3D atomic precision (11 pm) in light elements, marking the first-ever experimental realization of 3D atomic imaging for light-element materials. Using twisted bilayer graphene as a model system, we determine the 3D atomic coordinates of individual carbon atoms, revealing chiral lattice distortions driven by van der Waals interactions that exhibit meron-like and skyrmion-like structures. These findings provide direct insights into the interplay between 3D chiral lattice deformation and electronic properties in moire materials. Beyond TBG, pAET offers a transformative approach for 3D atomic-scale imaging across quantum materials, 2D heterostructures, functional oxides, and energy materials.

Title: Significant ballistic thermal transport across graphene layers: effect of nanoholes and lithium intercalation
Authors: John Crosby, Haoran Cui, Yan Wang
Abstract: Porous graphene and graphite are increasingly utilized in electrochemical energy storage and solar-thermal applications due to their unique structural and thermal properties. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the lattice thermal transport and spectral phonon characteristics of holey graphite and multilayer graphene. Our results reveal that phonon modes propagating obliquely with respect to the graphene basal planes are the primary contributors to cross-plane thermal transport. These modes exhibit a predominantly ballistic nature, resulting in an almost linear increase in cross-plane thermal conductivity with the number of layers. The presence of nanoholes in graphene induces a broadband suppression of cross-plane phonon transport, whereas lithium ion intercalation shows potential to enhance it. These findings provide critical insights into the mechanisms governing cross-plane heat conduction in key graphene-based structures, offering valuable guidance for thermal management and engineering of van der Waals materials.

Title: Stochastic elastohydrodynamics of soft valves
Authors: Mengfei He, Sungkyu Cho, Gianna Dafflisio, Sitaram Emani, L. Mahadevan
Abstract: Soft valves serve to modulate and rectify flows in complex vasculatures across the tree of life, e.g. in the heart of every human reading this. Here we consider a minimal physical model of the heart mitral valve modeled as a flexible conical shell capable of flow rectification via collapse and coaptation in an impinging (reverse) flow. Our experiments show that the complex elastohydrodynamics of closure features a noise-activated rectification mechanism. A minimal theoretical model allows us to rationalize our observations while illuminating a dynamical bifurcation driven by stochastic hydrodynamic forces. Our theory also suggests a way to trigger the coaptation of soft valves on demand, which we corroborate using experiments, suggesting a design principle for their efficient operation.

Title: Accelerating Multi-Objective Collaborative Optimization of Doped Thermoelectric Materials via Artificial Intelligence
Authors: Yuxuan Zeng, Wenhao Xie, Wei Cao, Tan Peng, Yue Hou, Ziyu Wang, Jing Shi
Abstract: The thermoelectric performance of materials exhibits complex nonlinear dependencies on both elemental types and their proportions, rendering traditional trial-and-error approaches inefficient and time-consuming for material discovery. In this work, we present a deep learning model capable of accurately predicting thermoelectric properties of doped materials directly from their chemical formulas, achieving state-of-the-art performance. To enhance interpretability, we further incorporate sensitivity analysis techniques to elucidate how physical descriptors affect the thermoelectric figure of merit (zT). Moreover, we establish a coupled framework that integrates a surrogate model with a multi-objective genetic algorithm to efficiently explore the vast compositional space for high-performance candidates. Experimental validation confirms the discovery of a novel thermoelectric material with superior $zT$ values in the medium-temperature regime.

Title: Inhomogeneous entanglement structure in monoaxial chiral ferromagnetic quantum spin chain
Authors: Kentaro Nishimura, Ryosuke Yoshii
Abstract: Chiral magnets, characterized by inhomogeneous magnetic moment arrangements, have attracted significant attention recently due to their topological orders, such as magnetic skyrmion lattices and chiral soliton lattices. In this work, we investigate the entanglement entropy of \textit{quantum} chiral magnets and demonstrate that it reflects the inhomogeneous nature of the ground state. We perform numerical simulations of a one-dimensional monoaxial chiral ferromagnetic chain with Zeeman term using the density matrix renormalization group method. Our results show that the entanglement entropy exhibits oscillatory behavior, which can be tuned by varying the external magnetic field. Analysis of the local magnetization and spin chirality further confirms that these oscillations correspond to solitonic structures. Moreover, our findings suggest that the entanglement entropy can serve as a probe for detecting the vacuum structure, providing new insights into quantum correlations.

Title: Dynamics and fragmentation of bosons in an optical lattice inside a cavity using Wannier and position bases
Authors: Christopher Gerard R. Sevilla, Jayson G. Cosme
Abstract: The atom-cavity system is a versatile platform for emulating light-matter systems and realizing dissipation-induced phases, such as limit cycles (LCs) and time crystals. Here, we study the dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) inside an optical cavity with transverse pumping and an additional intracavity optical lattice along the cavity axis. Specifically, we explore the theoretical predictions obtained from expanding the atomic field operators of the second-quantized Hamiltonian in two ways: (i) position basis and (ii) single-band Wannier basis. Both bases agree on the existence of most types of static and dynamical phases. However, matter-wave superradiance, captured within the position basis, is absent in the Wannier basis. Moreover, we show that they predict different types of LCs due to the inherent limitation of the single-band Wannier expansion, highlighting the importance of including higher energy bands to correctly capture certain phenomena. Using truncated Wigner approximation (TWA), we investigate the fragmentation dynamics of the BEC. We demonstrate that both position and Wannier bases qualitatively agree on the photon-mediated fragmentation dynamics of the BEC in the density-wave (DW) phase, despite the absence of interatomic interactions. The presence of interatomic interaction leads to further fragmentation, which can only be observed in larger system sizes. Finally, we predict a sudden increase in the fragmentation behavior for larger pump intensities, which may hint at an eventual transition to a Mott insulating (MI) phase.

Title: Oxygen-isotope effect on the density wave transitions in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ and La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$

Abstract: The isotope effect in solid-state physics is fundamental to understanding how atomic mass influences the physical properties of materials and provides crucial insights into the role of electron-phonon coupling in the formation of various quantum states. In this study, we investigate the effect of oxygen isotope ($^{16}$O/$^{18}$O) substitution on density wave transitions in the double- and triple-layer Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. The charge-density wave (CDW) transitions in both systems are influenced by isotope substitution, with the CDW transition temperature ($T_{\rm CDW}$) shifting to higher values in the $^{18}$O-substituted samples. In contrast, the isotope effect on the spin-density wave (SDW) transition temperature ($T_{\rm SDW}$) differs between the two systems. Specifically, a significant isotope effect on $T_{\rm SDW}$ is observed only in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, where the CDW and SDW orders are intertwined. This interplay results not only in equal values for $T_{\rm CDW}$ and $T_{\rm SDW}$ but also in an identical isotope effect on both transitions. In contrast, in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, where the SDW transition occurs at a temperature distinct from the CDW, no isotope effect is observed on $T_{\rm SDW}$.

Title: Positive Terahertz Photoconductivity in CdHgTe Under Hydrostatic Pressure
Authors: Ivan Yahniuk, Dmitriy A. Kozlov, Mariya D. Moldavskaya, Leonid E. Golub, Vasily V. Bel'kov, Ivan A. Dmitriev, Sergey S. Krishtopenko, Frederic Teppe, Yurii Ivonyak, Artem Bercha, Grzegorz Cywiński, Wojciech Knap, Sergey D. Ganichev
Abstract: Positive terahertz photoconductivity is observed at room temperature in CdHgTe thin films with different Cd contents. We show that electron gas heating caused by Drude-like absorption results in positive photoconductivity because of the interband activation mechanism specific for undoped narrow-gap semiconductors and semimetals. Applying intense terahertz radiation, we observed that the photoconductivity saturates at high intensities, which was found to be caused by absorption bleaching. Both the magnitude of the photoconductivity and the saturation intensity are shown to exhibit an exponential dependence on the hydrostatic pressure. We show that this is a consequence of the fact that both phenomena are controlled by the ratio of energy and momentum relaxation times.

Title: Role of Heat Transport in All-Optical Helicity-Independent Magnetization Switching
Authors: V. Raposo, J. Hohlfeld, S. Mangin, E. Martínez
Abstract: Single-shot all-optical helicity independent switching processes are investigated using advanced micromagnetic modeling in a ferrimagnetic thin film embedded in a multilayer stack. Building on recent experimental findings, our multiscale simulations realistically account for heat transport in the stack, focusing on the influence of a metallic copper underlayer with varying thickness. We analyze how this thermal transport affects the final magnetic state of the ferrimagnet as a function of both the laser pulse duration and fluence. Our results reproduce the experimentally observed switching behaviors and elucidate the physical mechanisms that govern the emergence of three distinct final magnetic states. In particular, we demonstrate how these states are critically influenced by the thickness of the underlying copper layer.

Title: An Efficient Integrator Scheme for Sampling the (Quantum) Isobaric-Isothermal Ensemble in (Path Integral) Molecular Dynamics Simulations
Authors: Weihao Liang, Sihan Wang, Cong Wang, Weizhou Wang, Xinchen She, Chongbin Wang, Jiushu Shao, Jian Liu
Abstract: Because most chemical or biological experiments are performed under conditions of controlled pressure and temperature, it is important to simulate the isobaric-isothermal ensemble at the atomic level to reveal the microscopic mechanism. By extending our configuration sampling protocol for the canonical ensemble, we propose a unified middle scheme to sample the coordinate (configuration) and volume distribution and thereby are able to accurately simulate either classical or quantum isobaric-isothermal processes. Various barostats and thermostats can be employed in the unified middle scheme for simulating real molecular systems with or without holonomic constraints. In particular, we demonstrate the recommended middle scheme by employing the Martyna-Tuckerman-Tobias-Klein barostat and stochastic cell-rescaling barostat, with the Langevin thermostat, in molecular simulation packages (DL_POLY, Amber, Gromacs, etc.). Benchmark numerical tests show that, without additional numerical effort, the middle scheme is competent in increasing the time interval by a factor of 5~10 to achieve the same accuracy of converged results for most thermodynamic properties in (path integral) molecular dynamics simulations.

Title: A mesoscopic model for the rheology of dilute and semidilute solutions of wormlike micelles
Authors: Avishek Kumar, Rico F. Tabor, P.Sunthar, J. Ravi Prakash
Abstract: The concept of a `persistent worm' is introduced, representing the smallest possible length of a wormlike micelle, and modelled by a bead-spring chain with sticky beads at the ends. Persistent worms are allowed to combine with each other at their sticky ends to form wormlike micelles with a distribution of lengths, and the semiflexibility of a wormlike micelle is captured with a bending potential between springs, both within and across persistent worms that stick to each other. Multi-particle Brownian dynamics simulations of such polydisperse and `polyflexible' wormlike micelles, with hydrodynamic interactions included and coupled with reversible scission/fusion of persistent worms, are used to investigate the static and dynamic properties of wormlike micellar solutions in the dilute and unentangled semidilute concentration regimes. The influence of the sticker energy and persistent worm concentration are examined and simulations are shown to validate theoretical mean-field predictions of the universal scaling with concentration of the chain length distribution of linear wormlike micelles, independent of the sticker energy. The presence of wormlike micelles that form rings is shown not to affect the static properties of linear wormlike micelles, and mean-field predictions of ring length distributions are validated. Linear viscoelastic storage and loss moduli are computed and the unique features in the intermediate frequency regime compared to those of homopolymer solutions are highlighted. The distinction between Rouse and Zimm dynamics in wormlike micelle solutions is elucidated, with a clear identification of the onset of the screening of hydrodynamic interactions with increasing concentration.

Title: Circular dichroism in resonant photoelectron diffraction as a direct probe of sublattice magnetization in altermagnets
Authors: Peter Krüger
Abstract: Altermagnets are a new class of materials, which are promising for spintronics applications, but the experimental proof of a finite sublattice magnetisation is often difficult. Here it is shown that in altermagnets, there exists a large magnetic circular dichroism (CD) in the resonant photoelectron diffraction (RPED) pattern. RPED calculations are performed for MnTe at the Mn L$_{2,3}$-edge resonance, using a combination of atomic multiplet and multiple scattering theory. A large CD of purely magnetic origin is found for light helicity parallel to the Néel vector. The magnetic CD has the same angular distribution as the difference between the structural RPED of the two magnetic sublattices and its amplitude is approximately proportional to the magnetic CD in X-ray absorption of a single sublattice. This shows that RPED-CD provides a direct experimental probe of the staggered magnetization.

Title: Giant Orbital Torque-driven Picosecond Switching in Magnetic Tunnel Junctions

Abstract: Orbital Hall effect was recently discovered as a novel pathway for driving magnetic moment. However, the integration of orbital Hall effect in magnetic memories suffers from low orbital-to-spin conversion efficiency and incompatibility with magnetic tunnel junctions. Here we demonstrate an orbital Hall effect-driven magnetic tunnel junction based on Ru/W bilayer, where the Ru layer possesses a strong orbital Hall conductivity and the {\alpha}-W layer features an orbital-to-spin conversion efficiency exceeding 90% because of the large orbit-spin diffusivity. By harnessing the giant orbital torque, we achieve a 28.7-picosecond switching and a five to eight-fold reduction in driving voltages over conventional spin-orbit torque magnetic memories. Our work bridges the critical gap between orbital effects and magnetic memory applications, significantly advancing the field of spintronics and orbitronics.

Title: Synthesis of intrinsic magnetic topological insulator MnBi2nTe3n+1 family by chemical vapor transport method with feedback regulation
Authors: Heng Zhang, Yiying Zhang, Yong Zhang, Bo Chen, Jingwen Guo, Yu Du, Jiajun Li, Hangkai Xie, Zhixin Zhang, Fuwei Zhou, Tianqi Wang, Wuyi Qi, Xuefeng Wang, Fucong Fei, Fengqi Song
Abstract: MnBi2nTe3n+1 (MBT) is a representative family of intrinsic magnetic topological insulators, in which numerous exotic phenomena such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect are expected. The high-quality crystal growth and magnetism manipulation are the most essential processes. Here we develop a modified chemical vapor transport method using a feedback-regulated strategy, which provides the closed-loop control of growth temperature within +/- 0.1 degree Celsius. Single crystals of MnBi2Te4, MnBi4Te7, and MnBi6Te10 are obtained under different temperature intervals respectively, and show variable tunability on magnetism by finely tuning the growth temperatures. Specifically, the cold-end temperatures not only vary the strength of antiferromagnetic coupling in MnBi2Te4, but also induce magnetic ground state transitions from antiferromagnetism to ferromagnetism in MnBi4Te7 and MnBi6Te10. In MnBi2Te4 with optimized magnetism, quantized transport with Chern insulator state is also realized at the low field of 3.7 T. Our results provide a systematic picture for the crystal growth and the rich magnetic tunability of MBT family, providing richer platforms for the related researches combining magnetism and topological physics.

Title: Designing atomic-scale resistive circuits in topological insulators through vacancy-induced localized modes
Authors: Cunyuan Jiang, Weicen Dong, Matteo Baggioli
Abstract: We demonstrate that vacancies can induce topologically protected localized electronic excitations within the bulk of a topological insulator, and when sufficiently close, give rise to one-dimensional propagating chiral bulk modes. We show that the dynamics of these modes can be effectively described by a tight-binding Hamiltonian, with the hopping parameter determined by the overlap of electronic wave functions between adjacent vacancies, accurately predicting the low-energy spectrum. Building on this phenomenon, we propose that vacancies in topological materials can be utilized to design atomic-scale resistive circuits, and estimate the associated resistance as a function of the vacancy distribution's geometric properties.

Title: Dynamics of surface electrons in a topological insulator: cyclotron resonance at room temperature

Abstract: The ability to manipulate the surface states of topological insulators using electric or magnetic fields under ambient conditions is a key step toward their integration into future electronic and optoelectronic devices. Here, we demonstrate - using cyclotron resonance measurements on a tin-doped BiSbTe$_2$S topological insulator - that moderate magnetic fields can quantize massless surface electrons into Landau levels even at room temperature. This finding suggests that surface-state electrons can behave as long-lived quasiparticles at unexpectedly high temperatures.

Title: Towards quantitative understanding of quantum dot ensemble capacitance-voltage spectroscopy
Authors: Nico F. Brosda, Phil J. Badura, İsmail Bölükbaşı, İbrahim Engin, Patrick Lindner, Sascha R. Valentin, Andreas D. Wieck, Björn Sothmann, Arne Ludwig
Abstract: Inhomogeneous ensembles of quantum dots (QDs) coupled to a charge reservoir are widely studied by using, e.g., electrical methods like capacitance-voltage spectroscopy. We present experimental measurements of the QD capacitance as a function of varying parameters such as ac frequency and bath temperature. The experiment reveals distinct shifts in the position of the capacitance peaks. While temperature-induced shifts have been explained by previous models, the observation of frequency-dependent shifts has not been explained so far. Given that existing models fall short in explaining these phenomena, we propose a refined theoretical model based on a master equation approach which incorporates energy-dependent tunneling effects. This approach successfully reproduces the experimental data. We highlight the critical role of energy-dependent tunneling in two distinct regimes: at low temperatures, ensemble effects arising from energy-level dispersion in differently sized QDs dominate the spectral response; at high temperatures and frequencies, we observe a peak shift of a different nature, which is best described by optimizing the conjoint probability of successive in- and out-tunneling events. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of tunnel processes and the physical properties of QD ensembles coupled to a common reservoir, with implications for their development in applications such as single-photon sources and spin qubits.

Title: Elasticity of bidisperse attractive particle systems
Authors: Yaqi Zhao, Antoine Sanner, Luca Michel, David S. Kammer
Abstract: Bidisperse particle systems are common in both natural and engineered materials, and it is known to influence packing, flow, and stability. However, their direct effect on elastic properties, particularly in systems with attractive interactions, remains poorly understood. Gaining insight into this relationship is important for designing soft particle-based materials with desired mechanical response. In this work, we study how particle size ratio and composition affect the shear modulus of attractive particle systems. Using coarse-grained molecular simulations, we analyze systems composed of two particle sizes at fixed total packing fraction and find that the shear modulus increases systematically with bidispersity. To explain this behavior, we develop two asymptotic models following limiting cases: one where a percolated network of large particles is stiffened by small particles, and another where a small-particle network is modified by embedded large particles. Both models yield closed-form expressions that capture the qualitative trends observed in simulations, including the dependence of shear modulus on size ratio and relative volume fraction. Our results demonstrate that bidispersity can enhance elastic stiffness through microstructural effects, independently of overall density, offering a simple strategy to design particle-based materials with tunable mechanical properties.

Title: Investigation into the low temperature state of the spin-ice material Dy_2 Ti_2 O_7
Authors: Mariano Marziali Bermudez, R. A. Borzi, D. A. Tennant, S. A. Grigera
Abstract: The thermal equilibrium properties of the spin-ice material DTO, including specific heat, magnetization, and spin correlations, could be successfully reproduced by a model featuring magnetic interactions up to the third nearest neighbor and long-ranged dipolar forces. With the best-fit parameters, the model predicts an ordered ground state which breaks the cubic symmetry of the lattice. In this work, we analyze results from a neutron scattering experiment in which, instead of sharp Bragg peaks, a diffuse pattern was observed down to 300mK, despite very slow cooling [A. M. Samarakoon et al., Physical Review Research 4,033159 (2022).]. Using a reverse Monte Carlo approach, we found compatible spin configurations, analyze the suitability of antiferromagnetic spin chains as building blocks for the ground-state and provide various measures of correlation and calculate their energy. Our analysis suggests that while infinitely long chains are not present in the experimental configuration, antiferromagnetic spin chains provide a good approximation of the data. There are indications of possible evidence for short-range chains, but further investigation is needed for confirmation.

Title: Explicit core-hole single-particle methods for L- and M- edge X-ray absorption and electron energy-loss spectra
Authors: Esther A. B. Johnsen, Naoki Horiuchi, Toma Susi, Michael Walter
Abstract: Single-particle methods based on Kohn-Sham unoccupied states to describe near-edge X-ray absorption (XAS) spectra are routinely applied for the description of K-edge spectra, as there is no complication due to spin-orbit (SO) coupling. L- and M-edge spectra are often addressed via variants of time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) based on SO calculations. Here, we present a computationally efficient implementation based on single-particle calculations with core holes within the frozen-core approximation. Combined with a semiempirical energy shift and a fixed spin-orbit splitting, this allows for a prediction of experimental spectra on the absolute energy scale. Such spectra are compared to linear-response TDDFT for molecules and show similar or even better match with experiment, except for multiplet effects that are not covered by the single-particle approximation. A similar picture emerges for solids, where good qualitative and sometimes even quantitative agreement to XAS and electron energy-loss spectra is achieved.

Title: A comparative review of recent results on supercritical anomalies in two-dimensional kinetic Ising and Blume-Capel ferromagnets
Authors: Gloria M. Buendía, Celeste Mendes, Per Arne Rikvold
Abstract: Following the unexpected experimental discovery of ``sideband'' peaks in the fluctuation spectrum of thin Co films driven by a slowly oscillating magnetic field with a constant bias [P.~Riego et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 117202 (2017)] numerical studies of two-state Ising and three-state Blume-Capel (BC) ferromagnets in this dynamically supercritical regime have flourished and been successful in explaining this phenomenon. Here, we give a comparative review of this new literature and its connections to earlier work. Following an introduction and a presentation of the two models and the computational method used in many of these studies, we present numerical results for both models. Particular attention is paid to the fact that zero spins in the BC model tend to collect at he interfaces between regions of the two nonzero spin values, +/-1. We present strong arguments that this phenomenon leads to a reduction of the effective interface tension in the BC model, compared to the Ising model.

Title: Calculation of Elastic Constants of UO$_2$ using the Hubbard-Corrected Density-Functional Theory DFT+U
Authors: Mahmoud Payami, Samira Sheykhi, Mohammad-Reza Basaadat
Abstract: Uranium dioxide which is used as a fuel in light water nuclear reactors, is continually exposed to radiation damage originated from the collision of high-energy particles. Accumulation of the resulting defects gives rise to the evolution in the micro-structure of the fuel which in turn brings about local tensions and strains in the fuel. One of the after effects due to evolution of micro-structure is the swelling of fuel which can damage the fuel cladding and cause environmental contamination by leakage of radioactive particles. Hence, it is vital to continually monitor the evolution of micro-structure and to analyze the changes in mechanical properties of the fuel. The study of elastic constants and analysis of their behavior is very helpful in understanding the mechanical properties of the fuel. In this research, using the Hubbard-corrected first-principles density-functional theory method, we have calculated the elastic constants of the uranium dioxide single crystal and compared the results with existing experimental data. In addition, using the Voigt, Reuss, and Hill models, we have estimated the mechanical properties for the poly-crystalline fresh fuel. The results show a very good agreement between the theory and experiment. Accordingly, we can reliably extend our method of calculations to the complicated system of irradiated fuel pellet, which is in the form of a poly-crystal and hosts various defects.

Title: Bifurcations and Phase Transitions in the Origins of Life
Authors: Ricard Solé, Manlio De Domenico
Abstract: The path toward the emergence of life in our biosphere involved several key events allowing for the persistence, reproduction and evolution of molecular systems. All these processes took place in a given environmental context and required both molecular diversity and the right non-equilibrium conditions to sustain and favour complex self-sustaining molecular networks capable of evolving by natural selection. Life is a process that departs from non-life in several ways and cannot be reduced to standard chemical reactions. Moreover, achieving higher levels of complexity required the emergence of novelties. How did that happen? Here, we review different case studies associated with the early origins of life in terms of phase transitions and bifurcations, using symmetry breaking and percolation as two central components. We discuss simple models that allow for understanding key steps regarding life origins, such as molecular chirality, the transition to the first replicators and cooperators, the problem of error thresholds and information loss, and the potential for "order for free" as the basis for the emergence of life.

Title: Stationary-state dynamics of interacting phase oscillators in presence of noise and stochastic resetting
Authors: Anish Acharya, Mrinal Sarkar, Shamik Gupta
Abstract: We explore the impact of global resetting on Kuramoto-type models of coupled limit-cycle oscillators with distributed frequencies both in absence and presence of noise. The dynamics comprises repeated interruption of the bare dynamics at random times with simultaneous resetting of phases of all the oscillators to a predefined state. To characterize the stationary-state behavior, we develop an analytical framework that spans across different generalizations of the Kuramoto model involving either quenched or annealed disorder or both, and for any choice of the natural frequency distribution. The framework applies to the dynamics both in absence and presence of resetting, and is employed to obtain in particular the stationary-state synchronization order parameter of the system, which is a measure of spontaneous ordering among the oscillator phases. A key finding is unveiling of the role of correlations in shaping the ordering dynamics under resetting.

Title: Lift force in chiral, compressible granular matter
Authors: Jarosław Pawłowski, Marcin Dudziak, Matteo Baggioli, Jie Zhang, Piotr Surówka
Abstract: Micropolar fluid theory, an extension of classical Newtonian fluid dynamics, incorporates angular velocities and rotational inertias and has long been a foundational framework for describing granular flows. However, existing formulations often overlook the contribution of finite odd viscosity, which is a natural occurrence in chiral micropolar fluids where parity and time-reversal symmetries are broken. In this work, we specifically explore the influence of odd viscosity on the lift forces -- a less commonly discussed force compared to drag -- experienced by a bead immersed in a compressible micropolar fluid. We analyze the lift forces on a bead embedded within a compressible flow of a granular medium, emphasizing the unique role and interplay of microrotations and odd viscosity.

Title: Probes of Full Eigenstate Thermalization in Ergodicity-Breaking Quantum Circuits
Authors: Gabriel O. Alves, Felix Fritzsch, Pieter W. Claeys
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) is the leading interpretation in our current understanding of quantum thermalization. Recent results uncovered strong connections between quantum correlations in thermalizing systems and the structure of free probability theory, leading to the notion of full ETH. However, most studies have been performed for ergodic systems and it is still unclear whether or how full ETH manifests in ergodicity-breaking models. We fill this gap by studying standard probes of full ETH in ergodicity-breaking quantum circuits, presenting numerical and analytical results for interacting integrable systems. These probes can display distinct behavior and undergo a different scaling than the ones observed in ergodic systems. For the analytical results we consider an interacting integrable dual-unitary model and present the exact eigenstates, allowing us to analytically express common probes for full ETH. We discuss the underlying mechanisms responsible for these differences and show how the presence of solitons dictates the behavior of ETH-related quantities in the dual-unitary model. We show numerical evidence that this behavior is sufficiently generic away from dual-unitarity when restricted to the appropriate symmetry sectors.

Title: Clifford algebras and liquid crystalline fermions
Authors: N. Johnson, L. C. Head, O. D. Lavrentovich, A. N. Morozov, G. Negro, E. Orlandini, C. A. Smith, G. M. Vasil, D. Marenduzzo
Abstract: We show that Clifford algebras provide a natural language to describe the physics of liquid crystal defects in 3D. This framework shows that most of these defects have fermionic nature, as the director field profile on a 2D cross section can algebraically be represented by a spinor. Defects in uniaxial, biaxial nematics and cholesterics are represented by elements belonging to different Clifford algebras, suggesting that there are fundamental distinctions between topological defects in each of these phases. Our theory allows nematic defects to be interpreted as Majorana-like spinors, as defects and antidefects are topologically equivalent, whilst some cholesteric defects, such as screw dislocations, are better viewed as Weyl-like spinors of well-defined chirality. Defects can be described by a ``defect bivector'', an algebraic element which quantifies the rototranslation associated with them. In cholesterics, fermionic defects of different types can combine to yield composite quasiparticles with either fermionic or bosonic nature. Under cylindrical confinement, these quasiparticles provide the way to understand the structure of screw dislocations. In the bulk, they may condensate to form topological phases, such as blue phases or skyrmion lattices. Our results provide a surprising link between liquid crystals, particle physics, and topological quantum matter.

Title: Phase separation in a chiral active fluid of inertial self-spinning disks
Authors: Pasquale Digregorio, Ignacio Pagonabarraga, Francisco Vega Reyes
Abstract: We show that systematic particle rotations in a fluid composed of disk-shaped spinners can spontaneously lead to phase separation. The phenomenon arises out of a homogeneous and hydrostatic stationary state, due to a pressure feedback mechanism that increases local density fluctuations. We show how this mechanism induces phase separation, coined as Rotation Induced Phase Separation (RIPS), when the active rotation is not properly counterbalanced by translational friction. A low density phase can coexist with a dense chiral liquid due to the imbalance between pressure and stress transmitted through chiral flows when a significant momentum transfer between rotational and translational motion can be sustained. As a consequence, RIPS is expected to appear generically in chiral fluids.

Title: Control of atomic reconstruction and quasi-1D excitons in strain-engineered moiré heterostructures
Authors: Shen Zhao, Zhijie Li, Zakhar A. Iakovlev, Peirui Ji, Fanrong Lin, Xin Huang, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Mikhail M. Glazov, Anvar S. Baimuratov, Alexander Högele
Abstract: In two-dimensional nearly commensurate heterostructures, strain plays a critical role in shaping electronic behavior. While previous studies have focused on random strain introduced during fabrication, achieving controlled structural design has remained challenging. Here, we demonstrate the deterministic creation of one-dimensional arrays from initially zero-dimensional triangular moiré patterns in MoSe$_2$-WSe$_2$ heterobilayers. This transformation, driven by the interplay of uniaxial strain and atomic reconstruction, results in one-dimensional confinement of interlayer excitons within domain walls, exhibiting near-unity linearly polarized emission related to the confinement-induced symmetry breaking. The width of the domain walls--and consequently the degree of exciton confinement--can be precisely tuned by the interlayer twist angle. By applying out-of-plane electric field, the confined excitons exhibit energy shifts exceeding 100~meV and changes in the fine-structure splitting by up to a factor of two. Our work demonstrates the potential of strain engineering for constructing designer moiré systems with programmable quantum properties, paving the way for future optoelectronic applications.

Title: Symmetries, Conservation Laws and Entanglement in Non-Hermitian Fermionic Lattices
Authors: Rafael D. Soares, Youenn Le Gal, Chun Y. Leung, Dganit Meidan, Alessandro Romito, Marco Schirò
Abstract: Non-Hermitian quantum many-body systems feature steady-state entanglement transitions driven by the competition between unitary dynamics and dissipation. In this work, we reveal the fundamental role of conservation laws in shaping this competition. Focusing on translation-invariant non-interacting fermionic models with U(1) symmetry, we present a theoretical framework to understand the structure of the steady-state of these models and their entanglement content based on two ingredients: the nature of the spectrum of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and the constraints imposed on the steady-state single-particle occupation by the conserved quantities. These emerge from an interplay between Hamiltonian symmetries and initial state, due to the non-linearity of measurement back-action. For models with complex energy spectrum, we show that the steady state is obtained by filling single-particle right eigenstates with the largest imaginary part of the eigenvalue. As a result, one can have partially filled or fully filled bands in the steady-state, leading to an entanglement entropy undergoing a filling-driven transition between critical sub volume scaling and area-law, similar to ground-state problems. Conversely, when the spectrum is fully real, we provide evidence that local observables can be captured using a diagonal ensemble, and the entanglement entropy exhibits a volume-law scaling independently on the initial state, akin to unitary dynamics. We illustrate these principles in the Hatano-Nelson model with periodic boundary conditions and the non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, uncovering a rich interplay between the single-particle spectrum and conservation laws in determining the steady-state structure and the entanglement transitions. These conclusions are supported by exact analytical calculations and numerical calculations relying on the Faber polynomial method.

Title: Localized plasmonic meron-antimeron pairs in doubly degenerate orbitals
Authors: Jie Yang, Xinmin Fu, Jiafu Wang, Yifan Li, Jingxian Zhang, Fangyuan Qi, Yajuan Han, Yuxiang Jia, Guy A E Vandenbosch, Tie Jun Cui, Xuezhi Zheng
Abstract: Topological defects are pivotal in elucidating kaleidoscopic topological phenomena in different physical systems. Meron-antimeron pairs are a type of topological defects firstly found as soliton solutions to SU(2) Yang-Mills equations in gauge theory, and then identified in condensed matter physics as a type of magnetic quasiparticles created in the context of topological charge conservation. Here, we show that isolated meron-antimeron pairs constitute a new form of optical topological quasiparticles that naturally emerge in doubly degenerate orbitals of plasmonic systems, including fundamental and higher-order ones, and their target-type counterparts. We demonstrate that their topological charges are strictly imposed by orbital indices from the doubly degenerate irreducible representations (irreps) of groups consisting of rotational symmetries, and thus are upper-bounded by the orbital indices imposed by group theory. In addition, we find that there exist highly-localized isolated (anti)merons in plasmonic spin textures, which were previously observed mostly in the form of lattices or clusters. We further demonstrate a locking effect between the chirality of the (anti)merons and the parity of the irreps. Then, the topological origins of the revealed topological quasiparticles, i.e., phase, V-point and L-line singularities in plasmonic fields, are investigated. Finally, a complete symmetry classification of the topological quasiparticles is provided. Generalizing the meron-antimeron pairs to photonic systems provides various possibilities for the applications in optical vectorial imaging, deep-subwavelength sensing and metrology.

Title: Exact large-scale correlations in diffusive systems with general interactions: explicit characterisation without the Dean--Kawasaki equation
Authors: Aurélien Grabsch, Davide Venturelli, Olivier Bénichou
Abstract: Characterising the statistical properties of classical interacting particle systems is a long-standing question. For Brownian particles the microscopic density obeys a stochastic evolution equation, known as the Dean--Kawasaki equation. This equation remains mostly formal and linearization (or higher-order expansions) is required to obtain explicit expressions for physical observables, with a range of validity not easily defined. Here, by combining macroscopic fluctuation theory with equilibrium statistical mechanics, we provide a systematic alternative to the Dean--Kawasaki framework to characterize large-scale correlations. This approach enables us to obtain explicit and exact results for dynamical observables such as tracer cumulants and bath-tracer correlations in one dimension, both in and out of equilibrium. In particular, we reveal a generic non-monotonic spatial structure in the response of the bath following a temperature quench. Our approach applies to a broad class of interaction potentials and extends naturally to higher dimensions.

Title: Magnon and photon blockade in an antiferromagnet-cavity hybrid quantum system
Authors: Vemund Falch, Arne Brataas, Alireza Qaiumzadeh
Abstract: We investigate both magnon and photon blockade for an antiferromagnetic insulator coupled to a linearly polarized cavity mode. We focus on the cross-Kerr nonlinearity between the two magnon modes, which can be large in antiferromagnets with a weak easy-axis magnetic anisotropy. By numerically solving the Lindblad master equations, we demonstrate that the resulting bright and dark modes, i.e., system eigenmodes that couple strongly and weakly to photons, respectively, exhibit distinct behaviors. The bright mode exhibits both magnon and photon blockade due to a weak effective nonlinearity, while the dark mode only exhibits magnon blockade for a detuned cavity photon. The blockade efficiency can further be optimized by appropriately tuning the competing interactions in the system. In addition, we show that applying a DC magnetic field, which lifts the degeneracy of antiferromagnetic chiral magnon eigenmodes, destroys the dark mode and leads to an unconventional photon blockade. These findings provide a pathway for generating single magnon and photon states useful for quantum information technology based on the underlying large squeezing of antiferromagnetic magnons.

Title: Oblique diffraction geometry for the observation of several non-coplanar Bragg reflections under identical illumination
Authors: C. Detlefs, A. Henningsson, B. Kanesalingam, A. A. W. Cretton, C. Corley-Wiciak, F. T. Frankus, D. Pal, S. Irvine, S. Borgi, H. F. Poulsen, C. Yildirim, L. E. Dresselhaus-Marais
Abstract: We present a method to determine the strain tensor and local lattice rotation with Dark Field X-ray Microscopy. Using a set of at least 3 non-coplanar, symmetry-equivalent Bragg reflections, the illuminated volume of the sample can be kept constant for all reflections, facilitating easy registration of the measured lattice variations. This requires an oblique diffraction geometry, i.e.~the diffraction plane is neither horizontal nor vertical. We derive a closed, analytical expression that allows determination of the strain and lattice rotation from the deviation of experimental observables (e.g.~goniometer angles) from their nominal position for an unstrained lattice.

Title: NMR study of supersolid phases in the triangular-lattice antiferromagnet Na2BaCo(PO4)2
Authors: Xiaoyu Xu, Zhanlong Wu, Ying Chen, Qing Huang, Ze Hu, Xinyu Shi, Kefan Du, Shuo Li, Rui Bian, Rong Yu, Yi Cui, Haidong Zhou, Weiqiang Yu
Abstract: We report ultra-low-temperature $^{23}$Na NMR measurements on the Ising triangular lattice antiferromagnet Na$_2$BaCo(PO$_4$)$_2$, which precisely resolve the phase diagram under magnetic field applied along the crystalline $c$ axis. With increasing field, the NMR spectra resolve three ordered phases with distinct spin configurations: the Y, up-up-down (UUD), and V phases. The spin-lattice relaxation rate $1/T_1$ data demonstrate gapless excitations in the Y and V phases, strongly supporting their supersolid nature. However, the phase transitions from the UUD phase to the two supersolid phases exhibit dramatically different behaviors upon cooling. Prior to entering the Y phase, $1/T_1$ identifies a gapless regime within the UUD phase, suggesting a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase above a second-order phase transition. In contrast, the coexistence of the UUD and V phases observed in our experiments provides direct evidence of a first-order phase transition between these phases.

Title: Reentrant transition to collective actuation in active solids with a polarizing field
Authors: Paul Baconnier, Mathéo Aksil, Vincent Démery, Olivier Dauchot
Abstract: Collective actuation takes place in active solids when the dynamics spontaneously condensates on a few elastic modes. This condensation results from an elasto-active feedback between the deformations of the structure and the orientations of forces exerted by the active units. An external field that polarizes these forces is thus likely to strongly affect the transition to collective actuation. Here, we study the dynamics of elastically coupled polar active units in the presence of such a field, through a combination of model experiments, numerical simulations, and theoretical analysis. Experimentally, we observe that tilting the plane of the experiment polarizes the orientation of the active units and thereby the forces they exert on the elastic structure. Taking advantage of this gravity-induced polarization, we uncover a novel oscillatory regime, distinct from the different oscillating regimes observed in the zero-field limit. The theoretical analysis of the dynamics for a single agent demonstrates that the two oscillating dynamics in the presence of a field map onto the bounded and unbounded phase dynamics of a weighing pendulum. In the many agents case, we observe experimentally and numerically, and demonstrate theoretically, that the polarizing field may facilitate the transition to collective actuation, leading to a reentrant transition.

Title: Altermagnetism Without Crystal Symmetry
Authors: Peru d'Ornellas, Valentin Leeb, Adolfo G. Grushin, Johannes Knolle
Abstract: Altermagnetism is a collinear magnetic order in which opposite spin species are exchanged under a real-space rotation. Hence, the search for physical realizations has focussed on crystalline solids with specific rotational symmetry. Here, we show that altermagnetism can also emerge in non-crystalline systems, such as amorphous solids, despite the lack of global rotational symmetries. We construct a Hamiltonian with two directional orbitals per site on an amorphous lattice with interactions that are invariant under spin rotation. Altermagnetism then arises due to spontaneous symmetry breaking in the spin and orbital degrees of freedom around each atom, displaying a common point group this http URL form of altermagnetism exhibits anisotropic spin transport and spin spectral functions, both experimentally measurable. Our mechanism generalizes to any lattice and any altermagnetic order, opening the search for altermagnetic phenomena to non-crystalline systems.

Title: Collective actuation in active solids in the presence of a polarizing field: a review of the dynamical regimes
Authors: Paul Baconnier, Vincent Démery, Olivier Dauchot
Abstract: Collective actuation in active solids, the spontaneous condensation of the dynamics on a few elastic modes, takes place whenever the deformations of the structure reorient the forces exerted by the active units composing, or embedded in, the solid. In a companion paper, we show through a combination of model experiments, numerical simulations, and theoretical analysis that adding an external field that polarizes the active forces strongly affects the dynamical transition to collective actuation. A new oscillatory regime emerges, and a reentrance transition to collective actuation takes place. Depending on the degenerate, or non-degenerate, nature of the modes on which the dynamics condensates; depending on the orientation of the polarizing field with respect to the stiff or soft direction of the solid, several new dynamical regimes can be observed. The purpose of the present paper is to review these dynamical regimes in a comprehensive way, both for the single-particle dynamics and for the coarse-grained one. Whenever possible the dynamical regimes and the transition between them are described analytically, otherwise numerically.

Title: Imaginary gauge potentials in a non-Hermitian spin-orbit coupled quantum gas
Authors: Junheng Tao, Emmanuel Mercado-Gutierrez, Mingshu Zhao, Ian Spielman
Abstract: In 1996, Hatano and Nelson proposed a non-Hermitian lattice model containing an imaginary Peierls phase [Phys. Rev. Lett. 77 570-573 (1996)], which subsequent analyses revealed to be an instance of a new class of topological systems. Here, we experimentally realize a continuum analog to this model containing an imaginary gauge potential using a homogeneous spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Non-Hermiticity is introduced by adding tunable spin-dependent loss via microwave coupling to a subspace with spontaneous emission. We demonstrate that the resulting Heisenberg equations of motion for position and momentum depend explicitly on the system's phase-space distribution. First, we observe collective nonreciprocal transport in real space, with a "self-acceleration" that decreases with the BEC's spatial extent, consistent with non-Hermitian Gross-Pitaevskii simulations. We then examine localized edge states: the relatively strong interactions in our BEC suppress the formation of topological edge states, yielding instead highly excited states localized by an interplay between self-acceleration and wavefunction spreading. Finally, we confirm that our non-Hermitian description remains valid at all times by comparing to a multi-level master-equation treatment.

Title: A simple method for detection and quantitative estimation of deep levels in a barrier layer of AlGaN/GaN HEMT strucutres by analysis of light induced threshold voltage shift
Authors: Maciej Matys, Atsushi Yamada, Yoichi Kamada, Toshihiro Ohki
Abstract: The characterization of deep levels in AlGaN/GaN heterostructures is one of the most important problems in GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) technology. This work reports on a technique for determination of deep level concentration in AlGaN/GaN HEMT structures. The proposed method is relatively simple, and it is based on the detection of free holes created by optically induced transitions of electrons from the deep levels to the conduction band. The developed method can detect and provide quantitative estimation of deep level traps in a barrier layer of AlGaN/GaN HEMT structures. Furthermore, it provides a framework for analysis of light induced threshold voltage shift, which includes an important experimental criterion of determination whether the holes are generated or not in the AlGaN/GaN HEMT structures by sub-band gap illumination. The method was verified by applications it to a study of the deep levels in GaN HEMTs grown on various substrates, i.e. SiC and GaN.

Title: Strange Attractors in Complex Networks
Authors: Pablo Villegas
Abstract: Disorder and noise in physical systems often disrupt spatial and temporal regularity, yet chaotic systems reveal how order can emerge from unpredictable behavior. Complex networks, spatial analogs of chaos, exhibit disordered, non-Euclidean architectures with hidden symmetries, hinting at spontaneous order. Finding low-dimensional embeddings that reveal network patterns and link them to dimensionality that governs universal behavior remains a fundamental open challenge, as it needs to bridge the gap between microscopic disorder and macroscopic regularities. Here, the minimal space revealing key network properties is introduced, showing that non-integer dimensions produce chaotic-like attractors.

Title: Schottky anomaly in a cavity-coupled double quantum well
Authors: Valerii K. Kozin, Dmitry Miserev, Daniel Loss, Jelena Klinovaja
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of a mesoscopic two-dimensional electron gas confined in a double quantum well that is coupled to a uniform quasi-static cavity mode via fluctuations of the dipole moment. We focus on the regime of large number of electrons participating in the virtual inter-subband transitions. In this regime, the effective photonic potential is no longer quadratic but, instead, it contains large number of minima. Each minimum represents a nearly harmonic oscillator with the renormalized cavity frequency that is much greater than its bare value. The energy offset of a minimum scales quadratically with respect to the photon coordinate corresponding to this minimum. These energy offsets determine the statistical weight of each minimum, and altogether they result in the additive correction to the heat capacity of the system. This correction exhibits a Schottky anomaly and a 0.5k_B plateau at low temperatures. This behavior can be associated with the emergence of a new degree of freedom. This degree of freedom does not manifest in the optical conductivity and can only be observed via the heat capacity measurement.

Title: Quantum Fluctuation-enhanced Milli-Kelvin Magnetic Refrigeration in Triangular Lattice Magnet GdBO3
Authors: Weijie Lin, Nan Zhao, Zhaoyi Li, Weiran An, Ruixin Guo, Jianqiao Wang, Changzhao Pan, Bo Wen, Jieming Sheng, Liusuo Wu, Shu Guo
Abstract: Rare-earth-based triangular lattice antiferromagnets, with strong quantum fluctuations and weak magnetic interactions, can often retain large magnetic entropy down to very low temperatures, making them excellent candidates for magnetic refrigeration at ultra-low temperatures. These materials exhibit a substantial magnetocaloric effect (MCE) due to enhanced spin fluctuations, particularly near quantum critical points, which leads to significant changes in magnetic entropy. This study reports on the crystal growth, structure, magnetism, and MCE of a Gd-based triangular lattice material, GdBO3, characterized by a large spin quantum number (S = 7/2). Successive phase transitions (T1 = 0.52 K, T2 = 0.88 K, and T3 = 1.77 K) were observed in zero-field specific heat measurements. Furthermore, thermal dynamic analysis under external magnetic fields identified five distinct phase regions and three quantum critical points for GdBO3. Due to its broad specific heat features and the high density of magnetic Gd3+ ions, we achieved a minimum temperature of 50 mK near the field-induced quantum critical point, using a custom-designed GdBO3-based adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator. Our findings reveal significant quantum fluctuations below 2 K, demonstrating GdBO3's potential for milli-Kelvin magnetic cooling applications.

Title: Time-reversal symmetric topological superconductivity in Machida-Shibata lattices
Authors: Ioannis Ioannidis, Ching-Kai Chiu, Thore Posske
Abstract: Recent experiments engineered special spin-degenerate Andreev states in atomic cages of adatoms on superconductors, the Machida-Shibata states, revealing a promising building block for quantum matter. Here, we investigate the formation of time-reversal symmetric bands by hybridizing multiple such states and analyzing their electronic topological properties. The low-energy theory shows that competing emerging singlet and triplet superconducting pairings drive the formation of topologically non-trivial phases in symmetry class DIII. Therefore, Kramers pairs of Majorana zero modes appear at the ends of Machida-Shibata chains, while two-dimensional lattices host helical Majorana edge modes. Additionally, we discover extended regions in the Brillouin zone with vanishing superconducting pairings, which can be lifted by repulsive electron interactions. Our findings offer new perspectives for manipulating topological superconductivity and pairings in non-magnetic adatom systems.

Title: Optimal Control in Soft and Active Matter
Authors: José Alvarado, Erin Teich, David Sivak, John Bechhoefer
Abstract: Soft and active condensed matter represent a class of fascinating materials that we encounter in our everyday lives -- and constitute life itself. Control signals interact with the dynamics of these systems, and this influence is formalized in control theory and optimal control. Recent advances have employed various control-theoretical methods to design desired dynamics, properties, and functionality. Here we provide an introduction to optimal control aimed at physicists working with soft and active matter. We describe two main categories of control, feedforward control and feedback control, and their corresponding optimal control methods. We emphasize their parallels to Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics, and provide a worked example problem. Finally, we review recent studies of control in soft, active, and related systems. Applying control theory to soft, active, and living systems will lead to an improved understanding of the signal processing, information flows, and actuation that underlie the physics of life.

Title: Nonreciprocal Coulomb drag in electron bilayers
Authors: Dmitry Zverevich, Alex Levchenko
Abstract: We propose a mechanism and develop a theory for nonreciprocal Coulomb drag resistance. This effect arises in electron double-layer systems in the presence of an in-plane magnetic field in noncentrosymmetric conductors or in bilayers with spontaneously broken time-reversal symmetry and without Galilean invariance. We demonstrate the significance of this effect by examining the hydrodynamic regime of the electron liquid. The nonreciprocal component of the transresistance is shown to sensitively depend on the intrinsic conductivity, viscosity of the fluid, and the emergent nonreciprocity parameter.

Title: A Generic Explanation of the Mechanism of Co-solvency
Authors: Xiangyu Zhang, Dong Meng
Abstract: Polymer behavior in mixed solvents often exhibits intriguing phenomena, such as cosolvency, where a polymer that collapses in two individually poor solvents becomes soluble in their mixture. In this study, we employ a combination of theoretical modeling and computer simulations using a generic polymer solution model to uncover the underlying mechanisms driving this behavior. Moving beyond conventional explanations based on solvent-cosolvent immiscibility or chemistry-specific interactions, our findings highlight the critical role of mismatches in solvophobicity and solvation strength between the polymer and the two solvent components. We demonstrate that co-solvency arises from the interplay between van der Waals interactions and specific associations, such as hydrogen bonding. The bulk phase behavior of the solution is also examined, and the resulting phase diagram, calculated using Flory-Huggins theory, shows good agreement with experimental observations. This study offers a generalized framework for understanding polymer cosolvency across diverse systems.

Title: Biharmonic-drive tunable Josephson diode
Authors: L. Borgongino, R. Seoane Souto, A. Paghi, G. Senesi, K. Skibinska, L. Sorba, F. Giazotto, E. Strambini
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect has garnered significant interest due to its prospective applications in cryogenic electronics and computing, characterized by zero resistance and no energy dissipation. This phenomenon has been demonstrated across various superconducting platforms, which typically necessitate unconventional materials with broken spatial symmetries or external magnetic fields, posing scalability and integration challenges. This work introduces an innovative method to realize the superconducting diode effect by disrupting spatio-temporal symmetries in a conventional Josephson junction utilizing a biharmonic AC drive signal. We achieve wireless modulation of the diode's polarity and efficiency with an antenna. Our findings indicate a diode efficiency reaching the ideal $100\%$ over a broad frequency range, with a temperature resilience up to 800 mK, and efficient AC signal rectification. This versatile and platform-independent superconducting diode signifies a promising component for advancing future superconducting digital electronics, including efficient logic gates, ultra-fast switches, and dynamic half-wave supercurrent rectifiers.

Title: Bloch transistor for cryogenic quantum electronics
Authors: Ilya Antonov, Rais Shaikhaidarov, Kyung Ho Kim, Dmitry Golubev, Sven Linzen, Evgeni V. Il'ichev, Vladimir N. Antonov, Oleg V. Astafiev
Abstract: We report on the development of a Bloch transistor (BT) for the emerging platform of cryogenic quantum electronics. The BT is a fully quantum non-dissipative device facilitating precise delivery of the quantized current to the circuit, I=2efn (where n is an integer, e is the charge of an electron and f is the microwave frequency). It does not have an analogue in classical electronics, but it is required for quantum ones. The amplitude of the quantized current is adjustable through four controls: the gate or bias voltage and the frequency or amplitude of the microwave. The device features Josephson junctions operating in the regime of Bloch oscillations, an isolating electromagnetic circuit and microwave feeding leads. BT operates at a bias of 5 {\mu}V, and can deliver the quantized currents up to 10 nA.

Title: Semimetallic two-dimensional defective graphene networks with periodic 4-8 defect lines
Authors: Roland Gillen, Janina Maultzsch
Abstract: We present theoretical simulations of the electronic properties of graphene-like two-dimensional (2D) carbon networks with a periodic arrangement of defect lines formed by alternating four- and eight-membered rings. These networks can be seen as arrays of armchair-edged nanoribbons (AGNRs), which are covalently connected at the edges. Using a combination of density functional theory and a simple tight binding model, we show that the electronic properties of these networks can be understood to arise from the family behaviour of the constituting AGNRs, plus a rigid shift due to an 'inter-ribbon' coupling across the defect lines. As a result, we find one class of zero-band-gap semiconducting 2D networks, and two classes of semimetallic networks with quasi-linear band close to the Fermi energy. The formation of closed-ring electron- and hole-like Fermi surfaces due to hybridization across the defect lines offers interesting perspectives of using such defective 2D networks for transport applications or the realization of carbon-based nodal line semimetals.

Title: Preparation and coherent manipulation of toroidal moments in molecules
Authors: Kieran Hymas, Alessandro Soncini
Abstract: Molecules with an odd number of electrons are expected to display paramagnetic behaviour in a uniform magnetic field. Instead, a vanishing magnetization is often measured in a family of lanthanide complexes known as Single Molecule Toroics. The anomaly can be explained in terms of degenerate quantum states in which electron spins and orbital currents give rise to time-odd and space-odd magnetic vortices known as toroidal moments, carrying a vanishing magnetic dipole. Resilient to stray magnetic fields and susceptible to electric manipulation, toroidal moments are sparking growing interest for applications in spintronics, magnonics, and photonics. While macroscopic toroidal moments have been observed in extended systems such as bulk low-dimensional non-collinear ferromagnets, theoretically predicted quantum toroidal states in molecules are yet to be observed, as it is currently unclear how to split degenerate states carrying counter-rotating vortices via existing experimental setups. Here we propose a realistic experimental protocol to polarize and observe molecular toroidal moments using pulsed microwave radiation. Modelling the spin-dynamics in a pulsed MW-field, we find that three resonant MW-pulses, delivered either sequentially or simultaneously, to a class of MDy$_6$ (M = Al$^{3+}$, Cr$^{3+}$) molecules consisting of coupled Dy$_3$ toroidal moieties, can selectively and coherently transfer population to a long-lived polarized toroidal state. The ensuing magneto-electric properties can then be used as a read-out mechanism. Our results provide a strategy to measure and coherently manipulate toroidal states in molecular systems, which is expected to trigger applications of molecular toroidal states to quantum technologies.

Title: Designing Topological High-Order Van Hove Singularities: Twisted Bilayer Kagomé
Authors: David T. S. Perkins, Anirudh Chandrasekaran, Joseph J. Betouras
Abstract: The interplay of high-order Van Hove singularities and topology plays a central role in determining the nature of the electronic correlations governing the phase of a system with unique signatures characterising their presence. Layered van der Waals heterostuctures are ideal systems for band engineering through the use of twisting and proximity effects. Here, we use symmetry to demonstrate how twisted Kagomé bilayers can host topological high-order Van Hove singularities. We study a commensurate system with a large twist angle and demonstrate how the initial choice of high-symmetry stacking order can greatly influence the electronic structure and topology of the system. We, furthermore, study the sublattice interference in the system. Our results illustrate the rich energy landscape of twisted Kagomé bilayers and unveil large Chern numbers (of order 10), establishing twisted bilayer Kagomé as a natural playground for probing the mixing of strong correlations and topology.

Title: Shapiro resonances in ac-self-modulated exciton-polariton Josephson junctions
Authors: I. Carraro Haddad, D. L. Chafatinos, A. A. Reynoso, A. E. Bruchhausen, A. S. Kuznetsov, K. Biermann, P. V. Santos, G. Usaj, A. Fainstein
Abstract: We experimentally investigate the dynamics of exciton polariton Josephson junctions when the coupling between condensates is periodically modulated through self-induced mechanical oscillations. The condensates energy detuning, the analog of the bias voltage in superconducting junctions, displays a plateau behavior akin to the Shapiro steps. At each step massive tunneling of particles occurs featuring Shapiro-like spikes. These characteristic changes are observed when the condensates Josephson frequency $\omega_\textrm{J}$ is an integer multiple of the modulation frequency $\omega_\mathrm{M}$.

Title: Emergent phases in the Yao-Lee model via coupling to topological spin textures
Authors: Muhammad Akram, Onur Erten
Abstract: Electrons in metals experience an effective vector potential when coupled to spin textures with non-zero scalar spin chirality, such as skyrmions. This coupling can generate a substantial field, leading to pronounced observable phenomena, including the topological Hall effect. Motivated by this, we consider a bilayer model in which the Majorana fermions in the Yao-Lee model on one layer interact with topological spin textures on the second layer via a spin-spin interaction. Unlike the Kitaev model, the Yao-Lee model remains exactly solvable, allowing us to perform Monte Carlo simulations to determine its ground state. Our analysis indicates that skyrmion crystals can give rise to a variety of vison crystals that are periodic arrangements of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fluxes with unusual patterns such as a kagome pattern. In addition, Majorana fermions acquire a substantial Berry phase from skyrmion crystals, resulting in phases with finite Chern numbers up to $\nu =5$. In the case of a single skyrmion defect in the magnetic layer, a corresponding defect in the vison configuration can be realized. These defects support localized states when the spin liquid is gapped. Similar to skyrmion crystals, spiral spin textures also give rise to a diverse range of flux crystals. However, in this case, most of these phases are gapless, with only a few being trivially-gapped. Our results highlight the rich physics emerging from the interplay between topological spin textures and fractionalized quasiparticles in quantum spin liquids.

Title: Non-Haar random circuits form unitary designs as fast as Haar random circuits
Authors: Toshihiro Yada, Ryotaro Suzuki, Yosuke Mitsuhashi, Nobuyuki Yoshioka
Abstract: The unitary design formation in random circuits has attracted considerable attention due to its wide range of practical applications and relevance to fundamental physics. While the formation rates in Haar random circuits have been extensively studied in previous works, it remains an open question how these rates are affected by the choice of local randomizers. In this work, we prove that the circuit depths required for general non-Haar random circuits to form unitary designs are upper bounded by those for the corresponding Haar random circuits, up to a constant factor independent of the system size. This result is derived in a broad range of circuit structures, including one- and higher-dimensional lattices, geometrically non-local configurations, and even extremely shallow circuits with patchwork architectures. We provide specific applications of these results in randomized benchmarking and random circuit sampling, and also discuss their implications for quantum many-body physics. Our work lays the foundation for flexible and robust randomness generation in real-world experiments, and offers new insights into chaotic dynamics in complex quantum systems.

Title: Unifying adiabatic state-transfer protocols with $(α, β)$-hypergeometries
Authors: Christian Ventura Meinersen, David Fernandez-Fernandez, Gloria Platero, Maximilian Rimbach-Russ
Abstract: Adiabatic optimal control schemes are essential for advancing the practical implementation of quantum technologies. However, the vast array of possible adiabatic protocols, combined with their dependence on the particular quantum system and function-specific parameter ranges, complicates the task of discerning their respective strengths and limitations in arbitrary operations. In this work, we provide a unifying framework, called $(\alpha,\beta)$-hypergeometries, that allows for flexible, noise-resistant, and easy-to-use implementation of enforced adiabatic dynamics for any multi-level quantum system. Moreover, this framework provides a comprehensive mapping of all adiabatic protocols through a universal cost function and offers an exact analytical characterization of the adiabatic dynamics. In particular, we derive precise expressions for infidelity resonances and establish performance guarantees in the adiabatic limit for any choice of $(\alpha,\beta)$. We also discuss in detail the experimental feasibility of the resulting pulse shapes through analytical and numerical methods. Finally, we test our method for the optimal control of coherent information transfer through spin shuttling in silicon quantum dots with small valley splittings.

Title: The canonical ensemble of a self-gravitating matter thin shell in AdS
Authors: Tiago V. Fernandes, Francisco J. Gandum, José P. S. Lemos
Abstract: We build the canonical ensemble of a hot self-gravitating matter thin shell in anti-de Sitter (AdS) space by finding its partition function through the Euclidean path integral approach with fixed temperature at the conformal boundary. We obtain the reduced action of the system by restricting the path integral to spherically symmetric metrics with given boundary conditions and with the Hamiltonian constraint satisfied. The stationary conditions, i.e., the mechanical equilibrium and the thermodynamic equilibrium, are obtained from minimizing the reduced action. Evaluating the perturbed reduced action at the stationary points yields the mechanical stability condition and the thermodynamic stability condition. The reduced action calculated at the stationary points gives the partition function in the zero-loop approximation and from it the thermodynamic properties of the system are acquired. Within thermodynamics alone, the only stability condition that one can establish is thermodynamic stability, which follows from the computation of the heat capacity. For given specific pressure and temperature equations of state for the shell, we obtain the solutions of the ensemble. There are four different thin shell solutions, one of them is fully stable, i.e., is stable mechanically and thermodynamically. For the equations of state given, we find a first order phase transition from the matter thermodynamic phase to the Hawking-Page black hole phase. Moreover, there is a maximum temperature above which the shell ceases to exist, presumably at these high temperatures the shell inevitably collapses to a black hole.

Title: Hybridization of edge modes with substrate phonons
Authors: Azat F. Aminov, Alexey A. Sokolik
Abstract: Surface plasmons or phonons propagating on a two-dimensional (2D) material can exhibit coupling with resonant excitations in its substrate, and the resulting coupled modes were extensively studied. Similar coupling of edge modes propagating along a boundary of 2D material with the substrate excitations remains unexplored. This paper aims to bridge this gap by investigating the edge-substrate hybrid modes using the exact Wiener-Hopf analytical approach. We analyze dispersions, decay rate, and confinement of such hybrid modes both without magnetic field (plasmon-phonon and phonon-phonon hybrid modes) and in quantizing magnetic field where edge magnetoplasmons hybridize with substrate phonons. The hybrid modes are predicted to occur in THz and far-IR ranges for several combinations of quasi-2D materials (single- and bilayer graphene, quantum wells, thin-film semiconductors) and substrates with polar-phonon resonances.

Title: Scaling Laws of Graph Neural Networks for Atomistic Materials Modeling
Authors: Chaojian Li, Zhifan Ye, Massimiliano Lupo Pasini, Jong Youl Choi, Cheng Wan, Yingyan Celine Lin, Prasanna Balaprakash
Abstract: Atomistic materials modeling is a critical task with wide-ranging applications, from drug discovery to materials science, where accurate predictions of the target material property can lead to significant advancements in scientific discovery. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) represent the state-of-the-art approach for modeling atomistic material data thanks to their capacity to capture complex relational structures. While machine learning performance has historically improved with larger models and datasets, GNNs for atomistic materials modeling remain relatively small compared to large language models (LLMs), which leverage billions of parameters and terabyte-scale datasets to achieve remarkable performance in their respective domains. To address this gap, we explore the scaling limits of GNNs for atomistic materials modeling by developing a foundational model with billions of parameters, trained on extensive datasets in terabyte-scale. Our approach incorporates techniques from LLM libraries to efficiently manage large-scale data and models, enabling both effective training and deployment of these large-scale GNN models. This work addresses three fundamental questions in scaling GNNs: the potential for scaling GNN model architectures, the effect of dataset size on model accuracy, and the applicability of LLM-inspired techniques to GNN architectures. Specifically, the outcomes of this study include (1) insights into the scaling laws for GNNs, highlighting the relationship between model size, dataset volume, and accuracy, (2) a foundational GNN model optimized for atomistic materials modeling, and (3) a GNN codebase enhanced with advanced LLM-based training techniques. Our findings lay the groundwork for large-scale GNNs with billions of parameters and terabyte-scale datasets, establishing a scalable pathway for future advancements in atomistic materials modeling.

Title: Enhanced Luminous Transmission and Solar Modulation in Thermochromic VO2 Aerogel-Like Films via Remote Plasma Deposition
Authors: Jose M. Obrero-Perez, Gloria Moreno-Martinez, Teresa C. Rojas, Francisco J. Ferrer, Francisco G. Moscoso, Lidia Contreras-Bernal, Javier Castillo-Seoane, Fernando Nunez-Galvez, Francisco J. Aparicio, Ana Borras, Juan R. Sanchez-Valencia, Angel Barranco
Abstract: Vanadium dioxide (VO2) is a thermochromic material that undergoes a phase transition from a monoclinic semiconducting state to a rutile metallic state at 68 degrees C, a temperature close to room temperature. This property makes VO2 particularly valuable in applications such as optical and electrical switches, data storage, neuromorphic computing, and remarkably dynamic smart windows for solar radiation control. VO2 typically needs to be synthesized for these applications as nanostructured thin films. Over the past few decades, significant efforts have been made to control the thermochromic properties of VO2 through crystal structure tuning, doping, and the development of VO2 nanocomposites. Additionally, introducing nano- and mesoporosity has been shown to enhance the optical properties of thermochromic VO2 films. This study presents a methodology for producing highly porous, aerogel-like V2O5 films, which can be thermally processed to form aerogel-like VO2 films. This process is based on sequential plasma polymerization and plasma etching to produce aerogel-like V2O5 films that are annealed to yield ultraporous nanocrystalline VO2 films. The sacrificial vanadium-containing plasma polymers are obtained by remote plasma-assisted vacuum deposition (RPAVD) using vanadyl porphyrin as a precursor and Ar as plasma gas. The aerogel-like VO2 films show exceptional thermochromic performance with luminous transmittances higher than 54%, solar modulation up to 18.8%, and IR modulation up to 35.5%. The presented plasma methodology is versatile, allowing both the synthesis of VO2 plasmonic structures to enhance the thermochromic response and the encapsulation of films to improve their stability in air dramatically. Additionally, this solvent-free synthetic method is fully compatible with doping procedures, scalable, and holds great potential for designing and optimizing smart window coatings.

Title: Replica manifolds, pole skipping, and the butterfly effect
Authors: Wan Zhen Chua, Thomas Hartman, Wayne W. Weng
Abstract: The black hole butterfly effect is a signal of quantum chaos in holographic theories that can be probed in different ways, including out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs), pole skipping (PS), and entanglement wedge (EW) reconstruction. Each of these three phenomena can be used to define a butterfly velocity that measures the speed at which chaos spreads. In a general quantum system the three velocities $v_B^{\text{OTOC}}$, $v_B^{\text{PS}}$, and $v_B^{\text{EW}}$ can be different, but it is known from explicit calculations that they are all equal in certain holographic theories dual to Einstein gravity plus higher-curvature corrections. A conceptual explanation for this apparent coincidence is lacking. We show that it follows from a deeper relationship: The pole-skipping mode, added to the black hole background, can be reinterpreted as the gravitational replica manifold for the late-time entanglement wedge, and its imaginary part is the shockwave that computes the OTOC. Thus pole skipping is directly related to entanglement dynamics in holographic theories, and the origin of the pole-skipping mode is an extremal surface on the horizon. This explains the coincidence $v_B^{\text{OTOC}} = v_B^{\text{PS}} = v_B^{\text{EW}}$ in known cases, and extends it to general theories of gravity with a pole-skipping mode having the usual behavior.

Title: Nonadiabatic Field: A Conceptually Novel Approach for Nonadiabatic Quantum Molecular Dynamics
Authors: Baihua Wu, Bingqi Li, Xin He, Xiangsong Cheng, Jiajun Ren, Jian Liu
Abstract: Reliable trajectory-based nonadiabatic quantum dynamics methods at the atomic level are critical for understanding many important processes in real systems. The paper reports latest progress of nonadiabatic field (NaF), a conceptually novel approach for nonadiabatic quantum dynamics with independent trajectories. Substantially different from the mainstreams of Ehrenfest-like dynamics and surface hopping methods, the nuclear force in NaF involves the nonadiabatic force arising from the nonadiabatic coupling between different electronic states, in addition to the adiabatic force contributed by a single adiabatic electronic state. NaF is capable of faithfully describing the interplay between electronic and nuclear motion in a broad regime, which covers where the relevant electronic states keep coupled in a wide range or all the time and where the bifurcation characteristic of nuclear motion is essential. NaF is derived from the exact generalized phase space formulation with coordinate-momentum variables, where constraint phase space (CPS) is employed for discrete electronic-state degrees of freedom. We propose efficient integrators for the equations of motion of NaF in both adiabatic and diabatic representations. Since the formalism in the CPS formulation is not unique, NaF can in principle be implemented with various phase space representations of the time correlation function (TCF) for the time-dependent property. They are applied to a suite of representative gas-phase and condensed-phase benchmark models where numerically exact results are available for comparison. It is shown that NaF is relatively insensitive to the phase space representation of the electronic TCF and will be a potential tool for practical and reliable simulations of the quantum mechanical behavior of both electronic and nuclear dynamics of nonadiabatic transition processes in real systems.

Title: Quantitative Lineshape Analysis for Arbitrary Inhomogeneity in Two-Dimensional Coherent Spectroscopy
Authors: Bhaskar De, Pradeep Kumar, Krishna K. Maurya, Rishabh Tripathi, Rohan Singh
Abstract: Two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) provides simultaneous measurement of homogeneous and inhomogeneous linewidths through quantitative lineshape analysis. However, conventional lineshape analysis methods assume Gaussian inhomogeneity, limiting its applicability to systems with non-Gaussian inhomogeneity. We present a quantitative lineshape analysis method incorporating arbitrary inhomogeneity using a bivariate spectral distribution function in 2DCS simulations. An algorithm is developed to extract the homogeneous linewidth and arbitrary inhomogeneous distribution from experimentally-measured 2D spectrum. We demonstrate this framework for the excitonic resonance in a GaAs quantum well with non-Gaussian inhomogeneity. This work broadens the scope of quantitative lineshape analysis for studying materials with non-Gaussian inhomogeneity.

Title: Manifestation of critical effects in environmental parameter estimation using a quantum sensor under dynamical control
Authors: M. Cristina Rodriguez, Analia Zwick, Gonzalo A. Alvarez
Abstract: Quantum probes offer a powerful platform for exploring environmental dynamics, particularly through their sensitivity to decoherence processes. In this work, we investigate the emergence of critical behavior in the estimation of the environmental memory time $\tau_c$, modeled as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process characterized by a Lorentzian spectral density. Using dynamically controlled qubit-based sensors -- realized experimentally via solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and supported by numerical simulations -- we implement tailored filter functions to interrogate the environmental noise spectrum and extract $\tau_c$ from its spectral width. Our results reveal a sharp transition in estimation performance between short-memory (SM) and long-memory (LM) regimes, reflected in a non-monotonic estimation error that resembles a phase transition. This behavior is accompanied by an avoided-crossing-like structure in the estimated parameter space, indicative of two competing solutions near the critical point. These features underscore the interplay between control, decoherence, and inference in open quantum systems. Beyond their fundamental significance, these critical phenomena offer a practical diagnostic tool for identifying dynamical regimes and optimizing quantum sensing protocols. By exploiting this criticality, our findings pave the way for adaptive control strategies aimed at enhancing precision in quantum parameter estimation -- particularly in complex or structured environments such as spin networks, diffusive media, and quantum materials.

Title: Boundary Scattering and Non-invertible Symmetries in 1+1 Dimensions
Authors: Soichiro Shimamori, Satoshi Yamaguchi
Abstract: Recent studies by Copetti, Córdova and Komatsu have revealed that when non-invertible symmetries are spontaneously broken, the conventional crossing relation of the S-matrix is modified by the effects of the corresponding topological quantum field theory (TQFT). In this paper, we extend these considerations to $(1+1)$-dimensional quantum field theories (QFTs) with boundaries. In the presence of a boundary, one can define not only the bulk S-matrix but also the boundary S-matrix, which is subject to a consistency condition known as the boundary crossing relation. We show that when the boundary is weakly-symmetric under the non-invertible symmetry, the conventional boundary crossing relation also receives a modification due to the TQFT effects. As a concrete example of the boundary scattering, we analyze kink scattering in the gapped theory obtained from the $\Phi_{(1,3)}$-deformation of a minimal model. We explicitly construct the boundary S-matrix that satisfies the Ward-Takahashi identities associated with non-invertible symmetries.

Title: Are nonequilibrium effects relevant for chiral molecule discrimination?
Authors: Federico Ravera, Leonardo Medrano Sandonas, Rafael Gutierrez, Mariagrazia Graziano, Gianaurelio Cuniberti
Abstract: Sensing and discriminating between enantiomers of chiral molecules remains a significant challenge in the design of sensor platforms. In the case of chemoresistive sensors, where detection relies on changes in electrical response upon analyte adsorption, the sensor substrate is typically functionalized with chirality sensitive molecular receptors. In this computational study, we investigate whether a chirality-blind substrate, such as a graphene nanoribbon, is still capable of discriminating between enantiomers. To this end, we employ a density-functional parametrized tight-binding method combined with nonequilibrium Green functions. For a small set of chiral amino acids, we demonstrate that accounting for the nonequilibrium response of the device leads to significant differences in the electrical currents of enantiomeric pairs of the order tens of nanoamperes. This effect is further amplified when structural fluctuations of the device's active region are considered (1-2 microAmp). Moreover, we propose new quantum-mechanical quantities for enantioselective discrimination in molecular sensors, with an emphasis on binding features and property-property correlations. Therefore, our work demonstrates the significance of nonequilibrium effects in chiral discrimination, laying the foundation for future investigations addressing the design of chiral molecular sensors.

Title: Perturbative Distinguishability of Black Hole Microstates from AdS/CFT Correspondence
Authors: Jiaju Zhang
Abstract: We establish direct evidence for the perturbative distinguishability between black hole microstates and thermal states using the AdS/CFT correspondence. In two-dimensional holographic conformal field theories, we obtain the short interval expansion of subsystem fidelity and quantum Jensen-Shannon divergence, both of which provide rigorous lower and upper bounds for trace distance. This result demonstrates that quantum gravity corrections break semiclassical indistinguishability, thereby supporting the recovery of information even from a small amount of the Hawking radiation.

Title: Pressure dependence of olivine grain growth at upper mantle conditions
Authors: Filippe Ferreira, Marcel Thielmann, Robert Farla, Sanae Koizumi, Katharina Tinka Marquardt
Abstract: The grain size of olivine influences mass and heat flux in Earth's upper mantle. We performed annealing experiments on synthetic olivine-pyroxene aggregates (6-13 vol.%) at 1-12 GPa and 1323-1793 K. Grain-size analysis via EBSD reveal an activation volume of $4.8 \times 10^{-6}\ \mathrm{m}^3/\mathrm{mol}$, matching silicon grain-boundary diffusion values. This suggests pressure-driven reduction in olivine growth rates may offset temperature effects at depth, enabling grain-size-sensitive creep at shallower mantle depths than previously modeled.

Title: Standardization of Weighted Ranking Correlation Coefficients
Authors: Pierangelo Lombardo
Abstract: A relevant problem in statistics is defining the correlation of two rankings of a list of items. Kendall's tau and Spearman's rho are two well established correlation coefficients, characterized by a symmetric form that ensures zero expected value between two pairs of rankings randomly chosen with uniform probability. However, in recent years, several weighted versions of the original Spearman and Kendall coefficients have emerged that take into account the greater importance of top ranks compared to low ranks, which is common in many contexts. The weighting schemes break the symmetry, causing a non-zero expected value between two random rankings. This issue is very relevant, as it undermines the concept of uncorrelation between rankings. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a standardization function $g(x)$ that maps a correlation ranking coefficient $\Gamma$ in a standard form $g(\Gamma)$ that has zero expected value, while maintaining the relevant statistical properties of $\Gamma$.

Title: Fixation and extinction in time-fluctuating spatially structured metapopulations
Authors: Matthew Asker, Mohamed Swailem, Uwe C. Täuber, Mauro Mobilia
Abstract: Bacteria evolve in volatile environments and complex spatial structures. Migration, fluctuations, and environmental variability therefore have a significant impact on the evolution of microbial populations. We consider a class of spatially explicit metapopulation models arranged as regular (circulation) graphs where wild-type and mutant cells compete in a time-fluctuating environment where demes (subpopulations) are connected by slow cell migration. The carrying capacity is the same at each deme and endlessly switches between two values associated with harsh and mild environmental conditions. When the rate of switching is neither too slow nor too fast, the dynamics is characterised by bottlenecks and the population is prone to fluctuations or extinction. We analyse how slow migration, spatial structure, and fluctuations affect the phenomena of fixation and extinction on clique, cycle, and square lattice metapopulations. When the carrying capacity remains large, bottlenecks are weak, and deme extinction can be ignored. The dynamics is thus captured by a coarse-grained description within which the probability and mean time of fixation are obtained analytically. This allows us to show that, in contrast to what happens in static environments, the fixation probability depends on the migration rate. We also show that the fixation probability and mean fixation time can exhibit a non-monotonic dependence on the switching rate. When the carrying capacity is small under harsh conditions, bottlenecks are strong, and the metapopulation evolution is shaped by the coupling of deme extinction and strain competition. This yields rich dynamical scenarios, among which we identify the best conditions to eradicate mutants without dooming the metapopulation to extinction. We offer an interpretation of these findings in the context of an idealised treatment and discuss possible generalisations of our models.

Title: Intracellular phagosome shell is rigid enough to transfer outside torque to the inner spherical particle
Authors: Srestha Roy, Arvin Gopal Subramaniam, Snigdhadev Chakraborty, Jayesh Goswami, Subastri Ariraman, Krishna Kumari Swain, Swathi Sudhakar, Rajesh Singh, Basudev Roy
Abstract: Intracellular phagosomes have a lipid bilayer encapsulated fluidic shell outside the particle, on the outer side of which, molecular motors are attached. An optically trapped spherical birefringent particle phagosome provides an ideal platform to probe fluidity of the shell, as the inner particle is optically confined both in translation and in rotation. Using a recently reported method to calibrate the translation and pitch rotations - yielding a spatial resolution of about 2 nm and angular resolution of 0.1 degrees - we report novel roto-translational coupled dynamics. We also suggest a new technique where we explore the correlation between the translation and pitch rotation to study extent of activity. Given that a spherical birefringent particle phagosome is almost a sphere, the fact that it turns due to the activity of the motors is not obvious, even implying high rigidity of shell. Applying a minimal model for the roto-translational coupling, we further show that this coupling manifests itself as sustained fluxes in phase space, a signature of broken detailed balance.

Title: Fragmentation; polyhedron reconstruction; 3d scanning
Authors: Janos Torok, Gabor Domokos
Abstract: Not only is the geometry of rock fragments often well approximated by ideal convex polyhedra having few faces and vertices, but these numbers carry vital geophysical information on the fragmentation process. Despite their significance, the identification of the ideal polyhedron has so far been carried out through visual inspection. Here, we present an algorithm capable of performing this task in a reliable manner. The input is a 3D scan of the fragment which is essentially a triangulated polyhedron, which however has often large number of faces and vertices. Our algorithm performs a systematic simplification using the following steps: - Gaussian smoothing is performed on the spherical histogram of the 3D scans faces to identify the most important face orientations. - Planes carrying the faces of the ideal polyhedron are identified as maxima of the smoothed histogram - Polygon is reconstructed using the identified planes - Small faces are removed in a systematic manner We present two versions of the algorithm that we benchmarked the algorithm against a dataset of human measurements on 132 fragments. Beyond identifying the ideal polyhedral approximation for fragments, our method is also capable of tracing backward the shape evolution of rounded pebbles to their origins.

Title: New Insights into Refractive Indices and Birefringence of Undoped and MgO-Doped Lithium Niobate Crystals at High Temperatures
Authors: Nina Hong, Jiarong R. Cui, Hyun Jung Kim, Ross G. Shaffer, Nguyen Q. Vinh
Abstract: The lithium niobate single crystal is a well-known optical material that has been employed in a wide range of photonic applications. To realize further applications of the crystal, the birefringence properties need to be determined over a large range of temperatures. We report refractive indices and birefringence properties of undoped and MgO-doped lithium niobate crystals with high accuracy using spectroscopic ellipsometry in the spectral range from 450 to 1700 nm and a temperature range from ambient temperature to 1000 °C. The birefringence results indicate a transition temperature, where the crystal transforms from an anisotropic to isotropic property, and the advance of MgO doping in the crystal, which is related to the optical damage threshold of the materials. In addition, the lattice dynamics of the crystals have been analyzed by revisiting the Raman spectroscopy. The results establish the foundation of optical properties of lithium niobate crystals, providing pathways for their photonic applications.

Title: Ising machine by dimensional collapse of nonlinear polarization oscillators
Authors: Salvatore Chiavazzo, Marcello Calvanese Strinati, Claudio Conti, Davide Pierangeli
Abstract: Ising machines show promise as ultrafast hardware for optimizations encoded in Ising Hamiltonians but fall short in terms of success rate and performance scaling. Here, we propose a novel Ising machine that exploits the three-dimensional nature of nonlinear polarization oscillators to counteract these limitations. Based on the evolution of the optical polarization in third-order nonlinear media, the high-dimensional machine reaches the Ising ground state by the mechanism of dimensional collapse: the dynamics on the Poincaré sphere undergoes a self-induced collapse into polarization fixed points mapping Ising spins. The photonic setup consists of polarization-modulated pulses in a $\chi^{(3)}$ crystal subject to iterative feedback. We numerically demonstrate that its high-dimensional operation leads to an enhanced success probability on benchmark graphs and an exponential improvement in performance scaling with respect to coherent Ising machines. The proposed polarization Ising machine paves the way for a new class of Ising solvers with enhanced computing capabilities.

Title: Autophoretic skating along permeable surfaces
Authors: Günther Turk, Rajesh Singh, Howard A. Stone
Abstract: The dynamics of self-propelled colloidal particles are strongly influenced by their environment through hydrodynamic and, in many cases, chemical interactions. We develop a theoretical framework to describe the motion of confined active particles by combining the Lorentz reciprocal theorem with a Galerkin discretisation of surface fields, yielding an equation of motion that efficiently captures self-propulsion without requiring an explicit solution for the bulk fluid flow. Applying this framework, we identify and characterise the long-time behaviours of a Janus particle near rigid, permeable, and fluid-fluid interfaces, revealing distinct motility regimes, including surface-bound skating, stable hovering, and chemo-hydrodynamic reflection. Our results demonstrate how the solute permeability and the viscosity contrast of the surface influence a particle's dynamics, providing valuable insights into experimentally relevant guidance mechanisms for autophoretic particles. The computational efficiency of our method makes it particularly well-suited for systematic parameter sweeps, offering a powerful tool for mapping the phase space of confined active particles and informing high-fidelity numerical simulations.

Title: The cell-centered Finite-Volume self-consistent approach for heterostructures: 1D electron gas at the Si-SiO2 interface
Authors: Vahid Mosallanejad, Haiou Li, Gang Cao, Kuei-Lin Chiu, Wenjie Dou, Guo-ping Guo
Abstract: Achieving self-consistent convergence with the conventional effective-mass approach at ultra-low temperatures (below $4.2~K$) is a challenging task, which mostly lies in the discontinuities in material properties (e.g., effective-mass, electron affinity, dielectric constant). In this article, we develop a novel self-consistent approach based on cell-centered Finite-Volume discretization of the Sturm-Liouville form of the effective-mass Schr{ö}dinger equation and generalized Poisson's equation (FV-SP). We apply this approach to simulate the one-dimensional electron gas (1DEG) formed at the Si-SiO$_2$ interface via a top gate. We find excellent self-consistent convergence from high to extremely low (as low as $50~mK$) temperatures. We further examine the solidity of FV-SP method by changing external variables such as the electrochemical potential and the accumulative top gate voltage. Our approach allows for counting electron-electron interactions. Our results demonstrate that FV-SP approach is a powerful tool to solve effective-mass Hamiltonians.

Title: Effect of substrate spin-orbit coupling on the topological gap size of Shiba chains
Authors: Philip Beck, Lucas Schneider, Roland Wiesendanger, Jens Wiebe
Abstract: Realizing Majorana bound states in chains of magnetic impurities on $s$-wave superconducting substrates relies on a fine tuning of the energy and hybridization of the single magnetic impurity bound states and of the spin-orbit coupling (SOC). While recent experiments investigate the influence of the former two parameters, the effect of SOC remained experimentally largely unexplored. Here, we present a scanning tunneling spectroscopy study of close-packed Mn chains along the [001]-direction on Ta(110) which has almost identical atomic and surface electronic structure compared to the previously studied Nb(110) system, but a three times larger SOC. The dominant Shiba band has a very similar dispersion, but its minigap, taken relative to $\varDelta$, is increased by a factor of 1.9 with respect to the Nb case, which can be ascribed to the stronger SOC.

Title: Sociohydrodynamics: data-driven modelling of social behavior
Authors: Daniel S. Seara, Jonathan Colen, Michel Fruchart, Yael Avni, David Martin, Vincenzo Vitelli
Abstract: Living systems display complex behaviors driven by physical forces as well as decision-making. Hydrodynamic theories hold promise for simplified universal descriptions of socially-generated collective behaviors. However, the construction of such theories is often divorced from the data they should describe. Here, we develop and apply a data-driven pipeline that links micromotives to macrobehavior by augmenting hydrodynamics with individual preferences that guide motion. We illustrate this pipeline on a case study of residential dynamics in the United States, for which census and sociological data is available. Guided by Census data, sociological surveys, and neural network analysis, we systematically assess standard hydrodynamic assumptions to construct a sociohydrodynamic model. Solving our simple hydrodynamic model, calibrated using statistical inference, qualitatively captures key features of residential dynamics at the level of individual US counties. We highlight that a social memory, akin to hysteresis in magnets, emerges in the segregation-integration transition even with memory-less agents. This suggests an explanation for the phenomenon of neighborhood tipping, whereby a small change in a neighborhood's population leads to a rapid demographic shift. Beyond residential segregation, our work paves the way for systematic investigations of decision-guided motility in real space, from micro-organisms to humans, as well as fitness-mediated motion in more abstract genomic spaces.

Title: Direction-dependent conductivity in planar Hall set-ups with tilted Weyl/multi-Weyl semimetals
Authors: Rahul Ghosh, Ipsita Mandal
Abstract: We compute the magnetoelectric conductivity tensors in planar Hall set-ups, which are built with tilted Weyl semimetals (WSMs) and multi-Weyl semimetals (mWSMs), considering all possible relative orientations of the electromagnetic fields ($\mathbf E $ and $\mathbf B $) and the direction of the tilt. The non-Drude part of the response arises from a nonzero Berry curvature in the vicinity of the WSM/mWSM node under consideration. Only in the presence of a nonzero tilt do we find linear-in-$ | \mathbf B| $ terms in set-ups where the tilt-axis is not perpendicular to the plane spanned by $\mathbf E $ and $ \mathbf B $. The advantage of the emergence of the linear-in-$ | \mathbf B| $ terms is that, unlike the various $| \mathbf B|^2 $-dependent terms that can contribute to experimental observations, they have purely a topological origin, and they dominate the overall response-characteristics in the realistic parameter regimes. The important signatures of these terms are that they (1) change the periodicity of the response from $\pi $ to $2\pi$, when we consider their dependence on the angle $\theta $ between $\mathbf E $ and $\mathbf B $; and (2) lead to an overall change in sign of the conductivity depending on $\theta$, when measured with respect to the $\mathbf B =0$ case.

Title: Nanoscale Casimir Force Softening Originated from Quantum Surface Responses
Authors: Hewan Zhang, Kun Ding
Abstract: Strong coupling between vacuum fields and quantum matter occurs at the nanoscale and broadens the horizon of light-matter interaction. Nanoscale Casimir force, as an exhibition of vacuum fields, inevitably experiences the influence of surface electrons due to their quantum character, which are ignorable in micron Casimir force. Here, we develop a three-dimensional conformal map method to tackle typical experimental configurations with surface electron contributions to Casimir force purposely and delicately included. Based on this method, we reveal that surface electrons can either enhance or suppress the nanoscale Casimir force, depending on materials and crystal facets. The mechanism is demonstrated to be the Casimir force softening, which results from surface electrons effectively altering the distance seen by the Casimir interaction. Our findings not only highlight the interaction between surface electrons and vacuum fields but also provide a recipe for theoretical and experimental investigation of nanoscale fluctuation-type problems.

Title: Exact real time dynamics with free fermions in disguise
Authors: István Vona, Márton Mestyán, Balázs Pozsgay
Abstract: We consider quantum spin chains with a hidden free fermionic structure, distinct from the Jordan-Wigner transformation and its generalizations. We express selected local operators with the hidden fermions. This way we can exactly solve the real time dynamics in various physical scenarios, including the computation of selected dynamical two point functions, in continuous or discrete time. In the latter case we build a quantum circuit that can be implemented on a quantum computer. With this we extend the family of classically simulable quantum many-body processes.

Title: Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition in the XY model on the honeycomb lattice: A comprehensive Monte Carlo analysis
Authors: Felipe E. F. de Andrade, L. N. Jorge, Claudio J. DaSilva
Abstract: In this paper, we thoroughly examined the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase transition in the two-dimensional XY model on the honeycomb lattice. To address its thermodynamical behavior, we combined standard numerical Monte Carlo simulations with the simulated annealing (SA) protocol and entropic simulations based on the Wang-Landau (WL) algorithm. The transition temperature was determined using the second ($\Upsilon$) and fourth-order ($\Upsilon_4$) helicity modulus as the order parameter. Our best finite-size scaling analysis suggests $T_{BKT} = 0.575(8)$ from SA and $T_{BKT}=0.576(3)$ from WL. These values deviate significantly from the expected theoretical value of $1/\sqrt{2}$. We believe that this discrepancy suggests that the theoretical assumptions regarding the analytical calculation may need to be revisited. Additionally, we calculated the vortex density and the formation energy of the vortex-antivortex pairs, where the obtained vortex formation energy is $2\mu=5.80(12)$. Upon comparison with the square lattice, our results support the notion of instability of the honeycomb lattice to support the spin long-range order and give additional backing to the critical behavior we found.

Title: Temporal bandwidth of consecutive polariton condensation
Authors: Mikhail Misko, Anton D. Putintsev, Denis Sannikov, Anton V. Zasedatelev, Ullrich Scherf, Pavlos G. Lagoudakis
Abstract: The advent of organic polaritonics has led to the realisation of all-optical transistors, logic gates, and single photon-switches operating at room temperature. In this Letter, we develop a microscopic theory accounting for thermalisation, vibron-relaxation, and radiative and ballistic polariton losses to investigate the intrinsic limitations of the temporal separation of consecutive polariton condensates. We test and verify our theoretical predictions using an optical pump-pump configuration with different pulse width and unravel the importance of lateral ballistic losses in defining the upper limit of the temporal bandwidth, reaching ~240 GHz.

Title: Stripes, pair density wave, and holon Wigner crystal in single-band Hubbard model on diagonal square lattice
Authors: Zhi Xu, Gui-Xin Liu, Yi-Fan Jiang
Abstract: We investigate the ground-state properties of the Hubbard model on wide diagonal square cylinders, rotated by $\pi/4$ relative to the regular lattice orientation. Using state-of-the-art density matrix renormalization group calculations with a large number of states, we convincingly demonstrate the development of a unidirectional charge density wave (CDW) characterized by infinite-length stripes along the primitive vector of square lattice in models with next-nearest-neighbor hopping $t'=-0.1\sim -0.3$ and doping $\delta \sim 14\%$. Intriguingly, analysis of pair-pair correlation functions along these stripes reveals incommensurate pair density wave (PDW) superconductivity with diverged susceptibility. To the best of our knowledge, this is probably the first controlled numerical evidence of dominant PDW in the single-band Hubbard model on square lattices. At lower doping $\delta \sim 10\%$, we observed the formation of an additional CDW order within each stripe, which aligns across different stripes, forming a holon Wigner crystal phase. The spin pattern retains antiferromagnetic stripes with anti-phase domain walls. The ordering momentum of this emerged CDW order is remarkably close to the center-of-mass momentum of Cooper pairs in the PDW phase, suggesting a multifaceted relationship between CDW and PDW ordering.

Title: Gating monolayer and bilayer graphene with a two-dimensional semiconductor
Authors: Randy Sterbentz, Bogyeom Kim, Anayeli Flores-Garibay, Kristine L. Haley, Nicholas T. Pereira, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Joshua O. Island
Abstract: Metals are commonly used as electrostatic gates in devices due to their abundant charge carrier densities that are necessary for efficient charging and discharging. A semiconducting gate can be beneficial for certain fabrication processes, in low light conditions, and for specific gating properties. We determine the effectiveness and limitations of a semiconducting gate in graphene and bilayer graphene devices. Using the semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2), tungsten disulfide (WS2), and tungsten diselenide (WSe2), we show that two-dimensional semiconductors can be used to suitably gate the graphene devices under appropriate operating conditions. For single-gated devices, semiconducting gates are comparable to metallic gates below liquid helium temperatures but include resistivity features resulting from gate voltage clamping of the semiconductor. In dual-gated devices, we pin down the parameter range of effective operation and find that the semiconducting depletion regime results in clamping and hysteresis from defect-state charge trapping.

Title: Exceptional Second-Order Topological Insulators
Authors: Yutaro Tanaka, Daichi Nakamura, Ryo Okugawa, Kohei Kawabata
Abstract: Point-gap topological phases of non-Hermitian systems exhibit exotic boundary states that have no counterparts in Hermitian systems. Here, we develop classification of second-order point-gap topological phases protected by reflection symmetry. Based on this classification, we propose exceptional second-order topological insulators, exhibiting second-order boundary states stabilized by point-gap topology. As an illustrative example, we uncover a two-dimensional exceptional second-order topological insulator with point-gapless corner states. Furthermore, we identify a three-dimensional exceptional second-order topological insulator that features hinge states with isolated exceptional points, representing second-order topological phases intrinsic to non-Hermitian systems. Our work enlarges the family of point-gap topological phases in non-Hermitian systems.

Title: Stretched-exponential stress dynamics in chain of springs and masses model of crystals: analytical results and MD simulations
Authors: Zbigniew Kozioł
Abstract: The model of a chain of springs and masses (CSM), originating from the works of Schrödinger (1914), and Pater (1974), is found suitable as an analytical description of the dynamics of layers in orientated FCC crystals. An analytical extension of that model has been developed for the case of linear-in-time ramp pressure applied to a sample surface. Examples are provided of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, confirming the usefulness of the model in the description of dynamic effects on steel 310S under pressure. Qualitatively the same results have been obtained by us for several other medium-entropy alloys CoNiCr (with EAM and MEAM inter-atomic potentials), and CoNiV (with MEAM potential). For studies of dynamic stability on large sizes of samples and for long times, the proposed earlier table-style harmonic interlayer potential has been used. The results of MD simulations suggest that the dynamics of the CSM model of perfectly ordered matter is described by stretched-exponential time functions, and it is characterised by simple scaling relations in time and size of the sample.

Title: Discovery of an ultrastable antiferromagnetic two-dimensional CrF3 phase with anisotropic quasi-one-dimensional mechanical, electronic, and thermal properties
Authors: Xin Chen, Fengyi Zhou, Yan Suo, Cheng Shao, Xu Cheng, Duo Wang, Biplab Sanyal
Abstract: We report the discovery of an ultra-stable antiferromagnetic two-dimensional (2D) CrF3 phase that is energetically more favorable than the traditionally assumed hexagonal structure. Using first-principles calculations and evolutionary structure searches, we identify a new low-energy rectangular configuration of CrF3 with remarkable anisotropic properties. Mechanically, this phase exhibits zero in-plane Poisson's ratio, a rare negative out-of-plane Poisson's ratio, and quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) behavior characterized by minimal coupling between orthogonal directions. Electronically, CrF3 shows quasi-1D transport with two independent conduction bands near the Fermi level, tunable via uniaxial strain. The calculated bandgap is 3.05 eV, which can be modulated under strain, enabling control over its electronic properties. The material also displays out-of-plane antiferromagnetic ordering with a magnetic anisotropy energy of 0.098 meV per Cr atom and an estimated Neel temperature of 20 K. Additionally, we investigate the thermal conductivity of monolayer rectangular CrF3 (r-CrF3), revealing significant anisotropy in heat transport. The thermal conductivity along the y-axis is approximately 60.5 W/mK at 300 K, much higher than along the x-axis at 13.2 W/mK. The thermal anisotropic factor is 4.58, surpassing that of other 2D materials like black phosphorene, WTe2, and arsenene, highlighting r-CrF3's potential for advanced directional heat management. Consequently, the rectangular CrF3 phase is a promising candidate for applications in spintronics, strain-engineered nanoelectronics, mechanical metamaterials, and thermal management technologies.

Title: Materials Discovery in Combinatorial and High-throughput Synthesis and Processing: A New Frontier for SPM

Abstract: For over three decades, scanning probe microscopy (SPM) has been a key method for exploring material structures and functionalities at nanometer and often atomic scales in ambient, liquid, and vacuum environments. Historically, SPM applications have predominantly been downstream, with images and spectra serving as a qualitative source of data on the microstructure and properties of materials, and in rare cases of fundamental physical knowledge. However, the fast-growing developments in accelerated material synthesis via self-driving labs and established applications such as combinatorial spread libraries are poised to change this paradigm. Rapid synthesis demands matching capabilities to probe structure and functionalities of materials on small scales and with high throughput. SPM inherently meets these criteria, offering a rich and diverse array of data from a single measurement. Here, we overview SPM methods applicable to these emerging applications and emphasize their quantitativeness, focusing on piezoresponse force microscopy, electrochemical strain microscopy, conductive, and surface photovoltage measurements. We discuss the challenges and opportunities ahead, asserting that SPM will play a crucial role in closing the loop from material prediction and synthesis to characterization.

Title: Pb-intercalated epitaxial graphene on SiC: Full insight into band structure and orbital character of interlayer Pb, and charge transfer into graphene
Authors: Bharti Matta, Philipp Rosenzweig, Kathrin Küster, Craig Polley, Ulrich Starke
Abstract: Intercalation is a robust approach for modulating the properties of epitaxial graphene on SiC and stabilizing two-dimensional (2D) intercalant layers at the graphene/SiC interface. In this work, we present synchrotron-based angle resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements focussing on the band structure of intercalated Pb under a single layer of epitaxial graphene. The interlayer Pb exhibits a metallic character, a $(1 \times 1)$ registry with respect to SiC, and free electron-like bands to a first order. Divergences from the free electron approximation include various band splittings and gaps throughout the Pb Brillouin zone. Light polarization dependent ARPES measurements indicate a predominant out-of-plane orbital character for the Pb bands, suggesting potential interactions between the interlayer Pb and graphene's $\pi$ orbitals that may induce proximity effects in graphene. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations for a $(1 \times 1)$ Pb monolayer on SiC show a reasonable qualitative agreement with the experimentally observed interlayer bands as well as the polarization dependent measurements. Finally, temperature dependent ARPES measurements reveal that the nearly charge-neutral graphene layer involves charge transfer from both the interlayer Pb and the substrate SiC.

Title: Fermion liquids as quantum Hall liquids in phase space: A unified approach for anomalies and responses
Authors: Jaychandran Padayasi, Ken K. W. Ma, Kun Yang
Abstract: The discovery of many strongly correlated metallic phases has inspired different routes to generalize or go beyond the celebrated Landau Fermi liquid theory. To this end, from universal consideration of symmetries and anomalies, Else, Thorngren and Senthil (ETS) have introduced a class of theories called ersatz Fermi liquids which possess a Fermi surface and satisfy a generalized Luttinger's theorem. In this work, we view all such fermion liquids obeying the Luttinger theorem as incompressible quantum Hall liquids in higher-dimensional phase space and use it as the starting point to derive their effective low-energy field theory. The noncommutativity of phase space motivates us to use the Seiberg-Witten map to derive the field theory in an ordinary (commutative) space and naturally leads to terms that correspond to the correct topological Chern-Simons action postulated by ETS in one, two, and three dimensions. Additionally, our approach also reproduces all the non-topological terms that characterize important contributions to the response, including the semiclassical equations of motion. Finally, our derivations of Chern-Simons terms from the Seiberg-Witten map also verify a longstanding conjecture in noncommutative field theory.

Title: Dissipative quantum phase transitions in electrically driven lasers
Authors: Lei-Lei Nian, Yi-Cheng Wang, Jin-Yi Wang, Long Xiong, Bo Zheng, Jing-Tao Lü
Abstract: Embedding quantum dot circuits into microwave cavities has emerged as a novel platform for controlling photon emission statistics by electrical means. With such a circuit version of the Rabi model, we reveal previously undefined quantum phase transitions in electrically driven lasing regimes, which do not require deep strong light-matter couplings. For one-photon interaction, the scaling analysis indicates that the system undergoes a continuous phase transition from thermal to coherent photon emissions. Going beyond this, a discontinuous quantum phase transition from superbunched to coherent states in two-photon processes, accompanied by the bistability within a mean-field theory, is predicted. Both the order of phase transitions and the critical electron-photon coupling can be easily controlled by an electric field, while the tunneling current can be used as a fingerprint of such transitions. Our prediction, along with its extension to multiphoton processes, represents a key step towards accessing lasing phase transitions.

Title: Quantifying the creation of negatively charged boron vacancies in He-ion irradiated hexagonal boron nitride

Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) hosts luminescent defects possessing spin qualities compatible with quantum sensing protocols at room temperature. Vacancies, in particular, are readily obtained via exposure to high-energy ion beams. While the defect creation mechanism via such irradiation is well understood, the occurrence rate of optically active negatively charged vacancies ($V_B^-$) is an open question. In this work, we exploit focused helium ions to systematically generate optically active vacancy defects in hBN flakes at varying density. By comparing the density-dependent spin splitting measured by magnetic resonance to calculations based on a microscopic charge model, in which we introduce a correction term due to a constant background charge, we are able to quantify the number of $V_B^-$ defects generated by the ion irradiation. We find a lower bound for the fraction (0.2%) of all vacancies in the optically active, negatively charged state. Our results provide a protocol for measuring the generation efficiency of $V_B^-$, which is necessary for understanding and optimizing luminescent centers in hBN.

Title: The study of the energy spectrum of a system of quantum micro-vortices in a bounded spatial domain
Authors: S.V. Talalov
Abstract: This study focuses on microscopic-sized quantum vortex filaments that are shaped like a circle. The model we considered examines loops with different radii and a small but non-zero core diameter. These loops are located in a bounded domain $D$. The quantization scheme of the classical vortices is based on the new approach proposed by the author \cite{Tal22_1,Tal24_2}. For these loops, we calculate both the quantized circulation and the energy spectrum, which are perfectly non-trivial. To understand how the results we have obtained can be used to describe the initial stage of turbulence in a quantum fluid, we study a system of $K$ random, non-interacting vortices. We explain how specific energy and circulation spectra lead to the occurrence of turbulence in the context of the developed approach.

Title: Constructing a variational ground state of matter fermions coupled to a vison pair in Kitaev's honeycomb model
Authors: T. Grace, A. Principi
Abstract: We develop a new method to construct simple and explicit variational approximations for the ground state of Kitaev's honeycomb model with a non-trivial Z2 flux configuration consisting of a pair of visons on neighbouring plaquettes. The method consists of retaining only the largest singular values of the generator of the transformation between the vison-pair and flux-free ground states. We compare physical quantities calculated using the approximate state to those obtained by extrapolating results of exact diagonalisation of finite lattices, finding them to be in very good agreement. We discuss ways to extend the method to more complicated flux configurations.

Title: In-plane Ising superconductivity revealed by exchange interactions
Authors: Junyi Yang, Changjiang Liu, Xianjing Zhou, Hanyu Hou, Kaijun Yin, Jianguo Wen, John Pearson, Alexey Suslov, Dafei Jin, Jidong S. Jiang, Ulrich Welp, Jian-Min Zuo, Michael R. Norman, Anand Bhattacharya
Abstract: Two-dimensional superconductors with spin-textured Fermi surfaces can be a platform for realizing unconventional pairing states and are of substantial interest in the context of quantum information science, and superconducting spintronics/orbitronics. We observed an unusual in-plane Ising like uniaxial anisotropy in the superconducting 2D electron gas (2DEG) formed at EuOx/KTaO3 (110) interfaces, where the EuOx is magnetic. This anisotropy is not evident in AlOx/KTaO3 (110) where the overlayer is non-magnetic. Our results are consistent with a highly anisotropic spin-textured Fermi surface in 2DEGs formed at the KTaO3 (110) interface that is hidden from external magnetic fields due to a near cancellation between orbital and spin moments but revealed by exchange interactions of the electrons in the 2DEG with Eu moments near the EuOx/KTaO3 (110) interface. The interactions between the uniaxial spin texture and the magnetic overlayer offer new ways to explore the interplay between magnetism and 2D superconductivity.

Title: Infinite-temperature thermostats by energy localization in a nonequilibrium setup
Authors: Michele Giusfredi, Stefano Iubini, Antonio Politi, Paolo Politi
Abstract: Some lattice models having two conservation laws may display an equilibrium phase transition from a homogeneous (positive temperature - PT) to a condensed (negative temperature) phase, where a finite fraction of the energy is localized in a few sites. We study one such stochastic model in an out-of-equilibrium setup, where the ends of the lattice chain are attached to two PT baths. We show that localized peaks may spontaneously emerge, acting as infinite-temperature heat baths. The number $N_b$ of peaks is expected to grow in time $t$ as $N_b \sim \sqrt{\ln t}$, as a consequence of an effective freezing of the dynamics. Asymptotically, the chain spontaneously subdivides into three intervals: the two external ones lying inside the PT region; the middle one characterized by peaks superposed to a background lying along the infinite-temperature line. In the thermodynamic limit, the Onsager formalism allows determining the shape of the whole profile.

Title: Double-Crucible Vertical Bridgman Technique for Stoichiometry-Controlled Chalcogenide Crystal Growth
Authors: Yingdong Guan, Suguru Yoshida, Jairo Obando-Guevara, Seng Huat Lee, Heike Pfau, Zhiqiang Mao
Abstract: Precise stoichiometry control in single-crystal growth is essential for both technological applications and fundamental research. However, conventional growth methods often face challenges such as non-stoichiometry, compositional gradients, and phase impurities, particularly in non-congruent melting systems. Even in congruent melting systems like Bi2Se3, deviations from the ideal stoichiometric composition can lead to significant property degradation, such as excessive bulk conductivity, which limits its topological applications. In this study, we introduce the double-crucible vertical Bridgman (DCVB) method, a novel approach that enhances stoichiometry control through the combined use of continuous source material feeding, traveling-solvent growth, and liquid encapsulation, which suppresses volatile element loss under high pressure. Using Bi2Se3 as a model system, we demonstrate that crystals grown via DCVB exhibit enhanced stoichiometric control, significantly reducing defect density and achieving much lower carrier concentrations compared to those produced by conventional Bridgman techniques. Moreover, the continuous feeding of source material enables the growth of large crystals. This approach presents a promising strategy for synthesizing high-quality, large-scale crystals, particularly for metal chalcogenides and pnictides that exhibit challenging non-congruent melting behaviors.

Title: A geometric one-fluid model of superfluid helium-4
Authors: Nadine Suzan Cetin, Michal Pavelka, Emil Varga
Abstract: A standard description of superfluid helim-4 is based on the concept of two components (superfluid and normal), which leads to the so called two-fluid models. However, as there are no two kinds of atoms in helium-4, the two components can not be separated. Superfluid helium-4 is not a mixture of two components, being rather a single fluid with two motions. Here, we present a geometric one-fluid model of superfluid helium-4, which is based on the Hamiltonian formulation of fluid mechanics. The model is derived from the kinetic theory of excitations and average particle motions. It can be simplified to the Hall-Vinen-Bekharevich-Khalatnikov (HVBK) two-fluid model, where it removes one fitting parameter from the HVBK model, but it also gives extra terms beyond HVBK. Actually, we show that the two-fluid models are problematic in case of higher normal velocities, where the splitting of total momentum to the superfluid and normal component becomes impossible. Finally, we show how vortex line density may be added to the state variables. The one-component model can be seen as a generalization of the two-fluid models that is geometrically consistent, fully compressible, with non-zero superfluid vorticity, and compatible with classical experiments.

Title: Coupling between small polarons and ferroelectricity in BaTiO3
Authors: Darin Joseph, Cesare Franchini
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the formation of electron and hole small polarons in the prototypical ferroelectric material BaTiO3, with a focus on their interaction with ferroelectric distortive fields. To accurately describe the ferroelectric phase in electronically correlated BaTiO3, we employ the HSE06 hybrid functional, which addresses the limitations of conventional DFT and DFT+U models, providing a more precise depiction of both ferroelectric and polaronic behaviors. Our analysis spans three structural phases of BaTiO3: cubic, tetragonal, and rhombohedral. We uncover a unique phase-dependent trend in electron polaron stability, which progressively increases across the structural phases, peaking in the rhombohedral phase due to the constructive coupling between the polaron and ferroelectric phonon fields. In contrast, hole polarons exhibit a stability pattern largely unaffected by the phase transitions. Furthermore, we observe that polaron self-trapping significantly alters the local ferroelectric distortive pattern, which propagates to neighboring sites but has a minimal effect on the long-range macroscopic spontaneous polarization. Charge trapping is also associated with localized spin formation, opening new possibilities for enhanced functionalities in multiferroic materials.

Title: Atomic Origins of Magnetic Anisotropy in Ru-substituted Manganite Films
Authors: Brajagopal Das, Cinthia Piamonteze, Lior Kornblum
Abstract: Magnetic anisotropy in complex oxides often originates from the complex interplay of several factors, including crystal structure, spin-orbit coupling, and electronic interactions. Recent studies on Ru-substituted $La_{0.70}Sr_{0.30}MnO_3$ (Ru-LSMO) films demonstrate emerging magnetic and magneto-transport properties, where magnetic anisotropy plays a crucial role. However, the atomic origin and underlying mechanisms of the magnetic anisotropy of this material system remain elusive. This work sheds light on these aspects. Detailed element-specific X-ray magnetic dichroism analysis suggests that Ru single ion anisotropy governs the overall magnetic anisotropy. Furthermore, the magnetic property of Mn ions changes dramatically due to strong antiferromagnetic coupling between Ru and Mn ions. Our findings clarify the role of Ru single ion anisotropy behind magnetic anisotropy in Ru-LSMO, offering a promising avenue for designing advanced materials with tailored magnetic properties for next generation magnetic and spintronic technologies. As the Curie temperature of these materials is close to room temperature, such tunable magnetic anisotropy holds prospects for functional room-temperature magnetic devices.

Title: Many-body quantum geometry in time-dependent quantum systems with emergent quantum field theory instantaneously
Authors: Xiao Wang, Xiaodong He, Jianda Wu
Abstract: We study many-body quantum geometric effects in time-dependent system with emergent quantum integrable field theory instantaneously. We establish a theorem stating that the Berry connection matrix thus all associated geometric quantities of the system can be precisely characterized by excitations up to two particles from the initial quantum integrable system. To illustrate the many-body geometric influence, we analyze an Ising chain subjected to both a small longitudinal field and a slowly rotating transverse field, whose low-energy physics in the scaling limit is instantaneously governed by the quantum $E_8$ integrable field theory. Focusing on the quantum geometric potential (QGP), we show the QGP continuously suppresses the instantaneous energy gaps with decreasing longitudinal field, thereby enhancing many-body Landau-Zener tunneling as evidenced by the Loschmidt echo and its associated spectral entropy. The critical threshold for the longitudinal field strength is determined,where the spectral entropy linearly increases with system size and exhibits hyperscaling behavior when approaching to the threshold. As the longitudinal field passes the threshold and decreases toward zero, the QGP continuously leads to vanishing instantaneous energy gaps involving more low-energy excitations, resulting in increasing spectral entropy indicative of many-body Landau-Zener this http URL results unveil telltale quantum geometric signatures in time-dependent many-body systems, elucidating the intricate interplay between quantum geometry and dynamics.

Title: Equivalent Electric Model of a Macrospin
Authors: Steven Louis, Hannah Bradley, Vasyl Tyberkevych
Abstract: Dynamics of a ferromagnetic macrospin (e.g., a free layer of a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ)) can be described in terms of equivalent capacitor charge $Q$ and inductor flux $\Phi$, in a manner similar to a standard electric LC circuit, but with strongly nonlinear and coupled capacitance and inductance. This description allows for the inclusion of Gilbert damping and spin transfer torques and yields a relatively simple equivalent electric circuit, which can be easily modeled in LTspice or other electrical engineering software. It allows one to easily simulate advanced electrical circuits containing MTJs and conventional electronic components in standard simulation software.

Title: Topological Symmetry Breaking in Antagonistic Dynamics
Authors: Giulio Iannelli, Pablo Villegas, Tommaso Gili, Andrea Gabrielli
Abstract: A dynamic concordia discors, a finely tuned equilibrium between opposing forces, is hypothesized to drive historical transformations. Similarly, a precise interplay of excitation and inhibition, the 80:20 ratio, is at the basis of the normal functionality of neural systems. In artificial neural networks, reinforcement learning allows for fine-tuning internal signed connections, optimizing adaptive responses to complex stimuli, and ensuring robust performance. At present, engineered structures of competing components are, however, largely unexplored, particularly because their emergent phases are closely linked with frustration mechanisms in the hosting network. In this context, the spin glass theory has shown how an apparently uncontrollable non-ergodic chaotic behavior arises from the complex interplay of competing interactions and frustration among units, leading to multiple metastable states preventing the system from exploring all accessible configurations over time. Here, we tackle the problem of disentangling topology and dynamics in systems with antagonistic interactions. We make use of the signed Laplacian operator to demonstrate how fundamental topological defects in lattices and networks percolate, shaping the geometrical arena and complex energy landscape of the system. This unveils novel, highly robust multistable phases and establishes deep connections with spin glasses when thermal noise is considered, providing a natural topological and algebraic description of their still-unknown set of pure states at zero temperature.

Title: Surface Sensitive Raman Response of Metal-Supported Monolayer MoS$_2$
Authors: Francesco Tumino, Sergio Tosoni, Paolo D'Agosta, Valeria Russo, Carlo Enrico Bottani, Andrea Li Bassi, Carlo Spartaco Casari
Abstract: The Raman spectrum of monolayer (ML) MoS$_2$ is remarkably affected by the interaction with metals. In this work we studied ML-MoS$_2$ supported by the Ag(111) and Ag(110) surfaces by using a combined experimental and theoretical approach. The MoS$_2$ layer was directly grown on atomically clean Ag(111) and Ag(110) surfaces by pulsed laser deposition, followed by in-situ thermal annealing under ultra-high vacuum conditions. The morphology and structure of the two systems were characterized in-situ by scanning tunneling microscopy, providing atomic-scale information on the relation between the MoS$_2$ lattice and the underlying surface. Raman spectroscopy revealed differences between the two MoS$_2$-metal interfaces, especially concerning the behavior of the out-of-plane $A'_1$ vibrational mode, which splits into two contributions on Ag(110). The metal-induced effects on MoS$_2$ vibrational modes are further evidenced by transferring MoS$_2$ onto a more inert substrate (SiO$_2$/Si), where the MoS$_2$ Raman response displays a more ``freestanding-like'' behavior. The experimental data were interpreted with the support of ab-initio calculations of the vibrational modes, which provided insight into the effect of interface properties, such as strain and out-of-plane distortion. Our results highlight the influence of the interaction with metals on MoS$_2$ vibrational properties, and show the high sensitivity of MoS$_2$ Raman modes to the surface structure of the supporting metal.

Title: Giant Barnett Effect from Moving Dislocations
Authors: Eugene M. Chudnovsky, Jorge F. Soriano
Abstract: We show that moving dislocations generate giant effective local magnetic fields in a crystal lattice that can flip spins. Since massive creation of fast-moving dislocations is associated with a powerful elastic stress, this suggests a new mechanism of the magnetization reversal generated by laser or microwave beams or by electrically induced shear deformation.

Title: Orb-v3: atomistic simulation at scale
Authors: Benjamin Rhodes, Sander Vandenhaute, Vaidotas Šimkus, James Gin, Jonathan Godwin, Tim Duignan, Mark Neumann
Abstract: We introduce Orb-v3, the next generation of the Orb family of universal interatomic potentials. Models in this family expand the performance-speed-memory Pareto frontier, offering near SoTA performance across a range of evaluations with a >10x reduction in latency and > 8x reduction in memory. Our experiments systematically traverse this frontier, charting the trade-off induced by roto-equivariance, conservatism and graph sparsity. Contrary to recent literature, we find that non-equivariant, non-conservative architectures can accurately model physical properties, including those which require higher-order derivatives of the potential energy surface. This model release is guided by the principle that the most valuable foundation models for atomic simulation will excel on all fronts: accuracy, latency and system size scalability. The reward for doing so is a new era of computational chemistry driven by high-throughput and mesoscale all-atom simulations.

Title: Quantum complexity phase transitions in monitored random circuits
Authors: Ryotaro Suzuki, Jonas Haferkamp, Jens Eisert, Philippe Faist
Abstract: Recently, the dynamics of quantum systems that involve both unitary evolution and quantum measurements have attracted attention due to the exotic phenomenon of measurement-induced phase transitions. The latter refers to a sudden change in a property of a state of $n$ qubits, such as its entanglement entropy, depending on the rate at which individual qubits are measured. At the same time, quantum complexity emerged as a key quantity for the identification of complex behaviour in quantum many-body dynamics. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of the quantum state complexity in monitored random circuits, where $n$ qubits evolve according to a random unitary circuit and are individually measured with a fixed probability at each time step. We find that the evolution of the exact quantum state complexity undergoes a phase transition when changing the measurement rate. Below a critical measurement rate, the complexity grows at least linearly in time until saturating to a value $e^{\Omega(n)}$. Above, the complexity does not exceed $\operatorname{poly}(n)$. In our proof, we make use of percolation theory to find paths along which an exponentially long quantum computation can be run below the critical rate, and to identify events where the state complexity is reset to zero above the critical rate. We lower bound the exact state complexity in the former regime using recently developed techniques from algebraic geometry. Our results combine quantum complexity growth, phase transitions, and computation with measurements to help understand the behavior of monitored random circuits and to make progress towards determining the computational power of measurements in many-body systems.

Title: Realizing string-net condensation: Fibonacci anyon braiding for universal gates and sampling chromatic polynomials
Authors: Zlatko K. Minev, Khadijeh Najafi, Swarnadeep Majumder, Juven Wang, Ady Stern, Eun-Ah Kim, Chao-Ming Jian, Guanyu Zhu
Abstract: The remarkable complexity of the vacuum state of a topologically-ordered many-body quantum system encodes the character and intricate braiding interactions of its emergent particles, the anyons.} Quintessential predictions exploiting this complexity use the Fibonacci string-net condensate (Fib-SNC) and its Fibonacci anyons to go beyond classical computing. Sampling the Fib-SNC wavefunction is expected to yield estimates of the chromatic polynomial of graph objects, a classical task that is provably hard. At the same time, exchanging anyons of Fib-SNC is expected to allow fault-tolerant universal quantum computation. Nevertheless, the physical realization of Fib-SNC and its anyons remains elusive. Here, we introduce a scalable dynamical string-net preparation (DSNP) approach, suitable even for near-term quantum processors, which dynamically prepares Fib-SNC and its anyons through reconfigurable graphs. Using a superconducting quantum processor, we couple the DSNP approach with composite error-mitigation on deep circuits to successfully create, measure, and braid anyons of Fib-SNC in a scalable manner. We certify the creation of anyons by measuring their `anyon charge', finding an average experimental accuracy of $94\%$. Furthermore, we validate that exchanging these anyons yields the { expected} golden ratio~$\phi$ with~$98\%$ average accuracy and~$8\%$ measurement uncertainty. Finally, we sample the Fib-SNC to estimate the chromatic polynomial at~$\phi+2$ for {several} graphs. Our results establish the proof of principle for using Fib-SNC and its anyons for fault-tolerant universal quantum computation and {for aiming at} a classically-hard problem.

Authors: Roger Bustamante, K. R. Rajagopal, Casey Rodriguez
Abstract: This study proposes a simple and novel class of stretch-limiting constitutive relations for perfectly flexible elastic strings drawing from modern advances in constitutive theory for elastic bodies. We investigate strings governed by constitutive relations where stretch is a bounded, piecewise linear function of tension, extending beyond the traditional Cauchy elasticity framework. Our analysis includes explicit solutions for both catenaries and longitudinal, piecewise constant stretched motions.

Title: More global randomness from less random local gates
Authors: Ryotaro Suzuki, Hosho Katsura, Yosuke Mitsuhashi, Tomohiro Soejima, Jens Eisert, Nobuyuki Yoshioka
Abstract: Random circuits giving rise to unitary designs are key tools in quantum information science and many-body physics. In this work, we investigate a class of random quantum circuits with a specific gate structure. Within this framework, we prove that one-dimensional structured random circuits with non-Haar random local gates can exhibit substantially more global randomness compared to Haar random circuits with the same underlying circuit architecture. In particular, we derive all the exact eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the second-moment operators for these structured random circuits under a solvable condition, by establishing a link to the Kitaev chain, and show that their spectral gaps can exceed those of Haar random circuits. Our findings have applications in improving circuit depth bounds for randomized benchmarking and the generation of approximate unitary 2-designs from shallow random circuits.

Title: Spikes in Poissonian quantum trajectories
Authors: Alan Sherry, Cedric Bernardin, Abhishek Dhar, Aritra Kundu, Raphael Chetrite
Abstract: We consider the dynamics of a continuously monitored qubit in the limit of strong measurement rate where the quantum trajectory is described by a stochastic master equation with Poisson noise. Such limits are expected to give rise to quantum jumps between the pointer states associated with the non-demolition measurement. A surprising discovery in earlier work [Tilloy et al., Phys. Rev. A 92, 052111 (2015)] on quantum trajectories with Brownian noise was the phenomena of spikes observed in between the quantum jumps. Here, we show that spikes are observed also for Poisson noise. We consider three cases where the non-demolition is broken by adding, to the basic strong measurement dynamics, either unitary evolution or thermal noise or additional measurements. We present a complete analysis of the spike and jump statistics for all three cases using the fact that the dynamics effectively corresponds to that of stochastic resetting. We provide numerical results to support our analytic results.

Title: Scaling Up Purcell-Enhanced Self-Assembled Nanoplasmonic Perovskite Scintillators into the Bulk Regime

Abstract: Scintillators, which convert high-energy radiation into detectable photons, play a crucial role in medical imaging and security applications. The enhancement of scintillator performance through nanophotonics and nanoplasmonics, specifically using the Purcell effect, has shown promise but has so far been limited to ultrathin scintillator films due to the localized nature of this effect. In this study, we present a method to extend nanoplasmonic scintillators to the bulk regime. By integrating 100-nm-size plasmonic spheroid and cuboid nanoparticles with perovskite scintillator nanocrystals, we enable nanoplasmonic scintillators to function effectively within bulk-scale devices. We experimentally demonstrate power and decay rate enhancements of up to (3.20 $\pm$ 0.20) and (4.20 $\pm$ 0.31) fold for plasmonic spheroid and cuboid nanoparticles, respectively, in a 5-mm thick CsPbBr$_3$ nanocrystal-polymer scintillator at RT. Theoretical modeling further predicts similar enhancements of up to (2.63 $\pm$ 0.79) and (5.62 $\pm$ 1.71) fold for the same nanoparticle shapes and dimensions. These findings provide a viable pathway for using nanoplasmonics to enhance bulk scintillator devices, advancing radiation detection technology.

Title: Temperature-Resistant Order in 2+1 Dimensions
Authors: Zohar Komargodski, Fedor K. Popov
Abstract: High temperatures are typically thought to increase disorder. Here we examine this idea in Quantum Field Theory in 2+1 dimensions. For this sake we explore a novel class of tractable models, consisting of nearly-mean-field scalars interacting with critical scalars. We identify UV-complete, local, unitary models in this class and show that symmetry breaking $\mathbb{Z}_2 \to \emptyset$ occurs at any temperature in some regions of the phase diagram. This phenomenon, previously observed in models with fractional dimensions, or in the strict planar limits, or with non-local interactions, is now exhibited in a local, unitary 2+1 dimensional model with a finite number of fields.

Title: Optimal control in phase space applied to minimal-time transfer of thermal atoms in optical traps
Authors: Omar Morandi, Sara Nicoletti, Vladislav Gavryusev, Leonardo Fallani
Abstract: We present an optimal control procedure for the non-adiabatic transport of ultracold neutral thermal atoms in optical tweezers arranged in a one-dimensional array, with focus on reaching minimal transfer time. The particle dynamics are modeled first using a classical approach through the Liouville equation and second through the quantum Wigner equation to include quantum effects. Both methods account for typical experimental noise described as stochastic effects through Fokker-Planck terms. The optimal control process is initialized with a trajectory computed for a single classical particle and determines the phase-space path that minimizes transport time and ensures high transport fidelity to the target trap. This approach provides the fastest and most efficient method for relocating atoms from an initial configuration to a desired target arrangement, minimizing time and energy costs while ensuring high fidelity. Such an approach may be highly valuable to initialize large atom arrays for quantum simulation or computation experiments.

Title: Large $N$ Wess-Zumino model at finite temperature and large chemical potential in $3d$
Authors: Srijan Kumar
Abstract: We consider the supersymmetric Wess-Zumino model at large $N$ in $(2+1)$ dimension. We introduce a chemical potential($\mu$) at finite temperature($T$). The non-trivial fixed point of this model is described by a pair of coupled gap equations. This fixed point behaves as a thermal CFT for all values of the coupling. We find that at large chemical potential these coupled equations simplify and solutions become analytically tractable. We solve them analytically for all values of the coupling at this limit. The solutions admit a systematic series expansion in $\frac{T}{\mu}$. Thus, using the solutions of the gap equation at large chemical potential we can evaluate the analytic form of the partition function, stress tensor and spin-1 current as a perturbative expansion in orders of $\frac{T}{\mu}$. Applying the OPE inversion formula on the scalar and fermion two point functions of the theory, we compute higher spin currents at large $\mu$.

Title: Stabilizer Entanglement as a Magic Highway
Authors: Zong-Yue Hou, ChunJun Cao, Zhi-Cheng Yang
Abstract: Non-stabilizerness is a key resource for fault-tolerant quantum computation, yet its interplay with entanglement in dynamical settings remains underexplored. We study a well-controlled, analytically tractable setup that isolates entanglement generation from magic injection. We analytically and numerically demonstrate that stabilizer entanglement functions as a highway that facilitates the spreading of locally injected magic throughout the entire system. Specifically, for an initial stabilizer state with bipartite entanglement $E$, the total magic growth, quantified by the linear stabilizer entropy $Y$, follows $\overline{Y}\propto 2^{-|A|-E}$ under a Haar random unitary on a local subregion $A$. Moreover, when applying a tensor product of local Haar random unitaries, the resulting state's global magic approaches that of a genuine Haar random state if the initial stabilizer state is sufficiently entangled by a system-size-independent amount. Similar results are also obtained for tripartite stabilizer entanglement. We further extend our analysis to non-stabilizer entanglement and magic injection via a shallow-depth brickwork circuit, and find that the qualitative picture of our conclusion remains unchanged.
