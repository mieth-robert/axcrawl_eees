Title: Spin-Polaron Mediated Superconductivity in Doped Chern Antiferromagnets
Authors: Xuepeng Wang, J. F. Mendez-Valderrama, Johannes S. Hofmann, Debanjan Chowdhury
Abstract: The study of interacting topological bands with a tunable bandwidth offers a unique platform to study the interplay of intertwined orders and emergent non-electronic excitations. Here we design a time-reversal symmetric and sign-problem-free electronic model with tunable Chern bands carrying valley-contrasting Chern number, interacting via competing (anti-)ferromagnetic interactions. Using numerically exact quantum Monte-Carlo computations, we analyze the many-body phase-diagram as a function of temperature and band filling fractions over a wide range of electronic bandwidth, interaction anisotropy, and an Ising spin-orbit coupling. At a commensurate filling of the Chern bands, the ground state hosts intra-valley ferromagnetic coherence and inter-valley antiferomagnetism, thus realizing an insulating Chern antiferromagnet (CAF). Upon doping, the ground-state develops superconductivity, but where the low-energy charged quasiparticles are composite objects -- electrons dressed by multiple spin-flip excitations. These spin-polaron (or skyrmion) excitations persist in the presence of a weak spin-orbit coupling. In a companion article, we address the emergent symmetries and low-energy field-theoretic aspects of the problem and reveal the proximity to a deconfined quantum critical point. We end by providing a general outlook towards building microscopic connections with models of interacting moiré materials, including twisted bilayer graphene, where many of the ingredients considered here are naturally present.

Title: Exciton Berryology
Authors: Henry Davenport, Johannes Knolle, Frank Schindler
Abstract: In translationally invariant semiconductors that host exciton bound states, one can define an infinite number of possible exciton Berry connections. These correspond to the different ways in which a many-body exciton state, at fixed total momentum, can be decomposed into free electron and hole Bloch states that are entangled by an exciton envelope wave function. Inspired by the modern theory of polarization, we define an exciton projected position operator whose eigenvalues single out two unique choices of exciton Berry phase and associated Berry connection - one for electrons, and one for holes. We clarify the physical meaning of these exciton Berry phases and provide a discrete Wilson loop formulation that allows for their numerical calculation without a smooth gauge. As a corollary, we obtain a gauge-invariant expression for the exciton polarisation at a given total momentum, i.e. the mean separation of the electron and hole within the exciton wave function. In the presence of crystalline inversion symmetry, the electron and hole exciton Berry phases are quantized to the same value and we derive how this value can be expressed in terms of inversion eigenvalues of the many-body exciton state. We then consider crystalline $C_2 \mathcal{T}$ symmetry, for which no symmetry eigenvalues are available as it is anti-unitary, and confirm that the exciton Berry phase remains quantized and still diagnoses topologically distinct exciton bands. Our theory thereby generalizes the notion of shift excitons, whose exciton Wannier states are displaced from those of the non-interacting bands by a quantized amount, beyond symmetry indicators.

Title: Tensor Network Representations for Intrinsically Mixed-State Topological Orders
Authors: Bader Aldossari, Sergey Blinov, Zhu-Xi Luo
Abstract: Tensor networks are an efficient platform to represent interesting quantum states of matter as well as to compute physical observables and information-theoretic quantities. We present a general protocol to construct fixed-point tensor network representations for intrinsically mixed-state topological phases, which exhibit nontrivial topological phenomena and do not have pure-state counterparts. The method exploits the power of anyon condensation in Choi states and is applicable to the cases where the target states arise from pure-state topological phases subject to strong decoherence/disorders in the Abelian sectors. Representative examples include $m^a e^b$ decoherence of $\mathbb{Z}_N$ toric code, decohered non-Abelian $S_3$ quantum double as well as pure $Z$/$X$ decoherence of arbitrary CSS codes. An example of chiral topological phases which cannot arise from local commuting projector models are also presented.

Title: Higher-order Topological States in Chiral Split Magnons of Honeycomb Altermagnets
Authors: Xuan Guo, Meng-Han Zhang, Dao-Xin Yao
Abstract: We theoretically explore higher-order topological magnons in collinear altermagnets, encompassing a dimensional hierarchy ranging from localized corner modes to propagating hinge excitations. By employing antiferromagnetic interlayer coupling in bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) Hamiltonian, our work reveals anisotropic surface states and spatially distributed hinge modes within AA-type stacking configurations. We track the adiabatic evolution of Wannier centers to identify the bulk-polarization with second-order topological magnon insulator (SOTMI), where various magnon spectra demonstrate symmetry-protected band structure beyond conventional topology. Harnessing the stability and propagative properties of hinge modes, our study offers a potential platform for magnonic quantum information processing in altermagnetic systems that performs energy-efficient logic operation.

Title: Quantum confinement effect in Sb thin films
Authors: Anuradha Wijesinghe, Yongxi Ou, Anjali Rathore, Chandima Edirisinghe, Pradip Adhikari, An-Hsi Chen, Dustin Gilbert, Anthony Richardella, Nitin Samarth, Joon Sue Lee
Abstract: Antimony (Sb), an element with strong spin-orbit coupling, is predicted to undergo a topological phase transition from a topological semimetal to a topological insulator as its dimensionality approaches the two-dimensional limit, driven by the quantum confinement effect. In this study, we investigate this transition in Sb thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy, employing electrical transport measurements and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Electrical transport measurements revealed signatures of a modified electronic band structure, including a Hall response with multiple carrier types, a decreasing carrier concentration, and a transition in the curvature of the longitudinal resistance from quadratic to linear with decreasing film thickness. Temperature-dependent magnetoresistance further showed weak antilocalization below 16 K, indicating strong spin-orbit coupling and suggesting the presence of non-trivial topological states. Analysis of the WAL characteristics revealed a single coherent conducting channel and a thickness-dependent change in the phase decoherence mechanism. Complementary ARPES measurements confirmed that reducing the film thickness lifts the conduction band at the M-point, consistent with the emergence of a band gap. These findings support theoretical predictions of a thickness-dependent band structure evolution driven by the quantum confinement effect, providing a foundation for further exploration of topological phase transitions in Sb as well as Bi1-xSbx. The realization of an elemental topological material with simplified stoichiometry and semiconductor compatibility presents a promising avenue for next-generation hybrid systems and applications in spintronics and quantum technologies.

Title: Exceptional Andreev spectrum and supercurrent in p-wave non-Hermitian Josephson junctions
Authors: Chang-An Li, Björn Trauzettel
Abstract: We investigate the spectrum of Andreev bound states and supercurrent in a $p$-wave non-Hermitian Josephson junction (NHJJ) in one dimension. The studied NHJJ is composed of two topological $p$-wave superconductors connected by a non-Hermitian dissipative junction. Starting from the effective non-Hermitian Bogoliubov-de Gennes bulk Hamiltonian, we find that a pair of exceptional points emerge in the complex spectrum of Andreev quasi-bound states. The two exceptional points locate symmetrically with respect to phase difference $\phi=\pi$ at zero real energy. Their separation is tunable by the non-Hermitian dissipation strength. By analyzing the non-Hermitian scattering process at the junction, we explicitly demonstrate the loss of quasiparticles through the decay of scattering amplitude probabilities. Furthermore, we obtain the supercurrent directly by the inelastic Andreev reflection amplitudes, which provides a more intuitive interpretation of transport properties in NHJJs. The supercurrent varies continuously as a function of $\phi$ across the exceptional points. No enhancement of critical current is observed. We also generalize our analysis to mixed $s$-$p$ wave NHJJ.

Title: Exploring Many-Body Quantum Geometry Beyond the Quantum Metric with Correlation Functions: A Time-Dependent Perspective
Authors: Yuntao Guan, Barry Bradlyn
Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor and quantum Fisher information have recently been shown to provide a unified geometric description of the linear response of many-body systems. However, a similar geometric description of higher-order perturbative phenomena including nonlinear response in generic quantum systems is lacking. In this work, we develop a general framework for the time-dependent quantum geometry of many-body systems by treating external perturbing fields as coordinates on the space of density matrices. We use the Bures distance between the initial and time-evolved density matrix to define geometric quantities through a perturbative expansion. To lowest order, we derive a time-dependent generalization of the Bures metric related to the spectral density of linear response functions, unifying previous results for the quantum metric in various limits and providing a geometric interpretation of Fermi's golden rule. At next order in the expansion, we define a time-dependent Bures-Levi-Civita connection for general many-body systems. We show that the connection is the sum of one contribution that is related to a second-order nonlinear response function, and a second contribution that captures the higher geometric structure of first-order perturbation theory. We show that in the quasistatic, zero-temperature limit for noninteracting fermions, this Bures connection reduces to the known expression for band-theoretic Christoffel symbols. Our work provides a systematic framework to explore many-body quantum geometry beyond the quantum metric and highlights how higher-order correlation functions can probe this geometry.

Title: A Perturbative Approach to Symmetric Mass Generation
Authors: Simon Martin, Tarun Grover
Abstract: The Landau paradigm has been a powerful framework for understanding phase transitions involving spontaneous symmetry breaking. In contrast, phase transitions between two symmetric phases, where neither phase breaks any symmetry, remain less explored. One intriguing class of such transitions involves "symmetric mass generation" (SMG), where interactions drive a transition from a gapless symmetric phase to a gapped symmetric phase. In this work, we develop a controlled perturbative approach to study a class of such transitions, based on an $\epsilon$-expansion around the critical dimension where the SMG-inducing-interaction becomes marginal. Applying this method to two distinct models, we identify a single-parameter-tuned transition in each case, which we conjecture captures the universal critical behavior of the SMG transition in these models. We compute universal quantities associated with these transitions.

Title: Quantitative Nonlinear Optical Polarimetry with High Spatial Resolution
Authors: Albert Suceava, Sankalpa Hazra, Jadupati Nag, John Hayden, Safdar Imam, Zhiwen Liu, Abishek Iyer, Mercouri Kanatzidis, Susan Trolier-McKinstry, Jon-Paul Maria, Venkatraman Gopalan
Abstract: Nonlinear optical microscopy such as in the optical second-harmonic generation (SHG) modality has become a popular tool today for probing materials in the physical and biological sciences. While imaging and spectroscopy are widely used in the microscopy mode, nonlinear polarimetry, which can shed light on materials' symmetry and microstructure, is relatively underdeveloped. This is partly because quantitative analytical modeling of the optical SHG response for anisotropic crystals and films largely assumes low-numerical aperture (NA) focusing of light, where the plane-wave approximation is sufficient. Tight focusing provides unique benefits in revealing out-of-plane polarization responses, which cannot be detected by near-plane-wave illumination at normal incidence. Here, we outline a method for quantitatively analyzing SHG polarimetry measurements obtained under high-NA focusing within a microscope geometry. Experiments and simulations of a variety of standard samples, from single crystals to thin films, are in good agreement, including measured and simulated spatial SHG maps of ferroelectric domains. A solution to the inverse problem is demonstrated, where the spatial distribution of an SHG tensor with unknown tensor coefficient magnitudes is determined by experimentally measured polarimetry. The ability to extract the out-of-plane component of the nonlinear polarization in normal incidence is demonstrated, which can be valuable for high-resolution polarimetry of 2D materials, thin films, heterostructures, and uniaxial crystals with a strong out-of-plane response.

Title: Realizing Nonreciprocal Linear Dichroism and Emission from Simple Media
Authors: Thomas J. Ugras, Daniel J. Gracias, Oriol Arteaga, Richard D. Robinson
Abstract: Reciprocity, the principle that a system response is identical in the forward path compared to the backward path, is a fundamental concept across physics, from electrical circuits and optics to acoustics and heat conduction. Nonreciprocity arises when this symmetry is broken, enabling directional-dependent behavior. In photonics, nonreciprocity allows control over the propagation of electromagnetic waves, essential for isolators and circulators. But achieving optical nonreciprocity typically requires complex metamaterials, exotic media, or strong external fields. Because of this, researchers have historically overlooked the possibility that readily available materials could support nonreciprocal optical behavior, assuming that conventional systems lack the ability to produce nonreciprocal behavior. In this work, we challenge that assumption by revisiting the light-matter interactions of chiroptic and linearly anisotropic media. Through Stokes-Mueller formalism we derive a simple analytical expression that predicts a pathway to nonreciprocal absorption and emission of orthogonal linear polarizations. We test this idea experimentally using solution-processed films of CdS, CdSe, and CdTe magic-size clusters that possess commensurate circular dichroism (CD) and linear dichroism (LD)values and find that they can support this effect, engineering films that exhibit nonreciprocal absorption and emission of linearly polarized light. Based on the derived expressions and experiments, several design rules are presented. Our findings reveal that nonreciprocal linear dichroism and emission can be achieved in readily processable, macroscopically symmetric materials by harnessing chiral-linear optical interference. This work opens new opportunities for scalable, polarization-based photonic control for direction-dependent optical routing, optical logic, and polarization-multiplexed information encoding.

Title: Local Inversion Symmetry Breaking and Thermodynamic Evidence for Ferrimagnetism in Fe3GaTe2
Authors: Sang-Eon Lee, Yue Li, Yeonkyu Lee, W. Kice Brown, PeiYu Cai, Jinyoung Yun, Chanyoung Lee, Alex Moon, Lingrui Mei, Jaeyong Kim, Yan Xin, Julie A. Borchers, Thomas W. Heitmann, Matthias Frontzek, William D. Ratcliff, Gregory T. McCandless, Julia Y. Chan, Elton J. G. Santos, Jeehoon Kim, Charudatta M. Phatak, Vadym Kulichenko, Luis Balicas
Abstract: The layered compound Fe3GaTe2 is attracting attention due to its high Curie temperature, low dimensionality, and the presence of topological spin textures above room temperature, making Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ a good candidate for applications in spintronics. Here, we show, through transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques, that Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ single crystals break local inversion symmetry while maintaining global inversion symmetry according to X-ray diffraction. Coupled to the observation of Néel skyrmions via Lorentz-TEM, our structural analysis provides a convincing explanation for their presence in centrosymmetric materials. Magnetization measurements as a function of the temperature displays a sharp first-order thermodynamic phase-transition leading to a reduction in the magnetic moment. This implies that the ground state of Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ is globally ferrimagnetic and not a glassy magnetic state composed of ferrimagnetic, and ferromagnetic domains as previously claimed. Neutron diffraction studies indicate that the ferromagnetic to ferrimagnetic transition upon reducing the external magnetic field is associated with a change in the magnetic configuration/coupling between Fe1 and Fe2 moments. We observe a clear correlation between the hysteresis observed in both the skyrmion density and the magnetization of Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$. This indicates that its topological spin textures are affected by the development of ferrimagnetism upon cooling. Observation, via magnetic force microscopy, of magnetic bubbles at the magnetic phase boundary suggests skyrmions stabilized by the competition among magnetic phases and distinct exchange interactions. Our study provides an explanation for the observation of Néel skyrmions in centrosymmetric systems, while exposing a correlation between the distinct magnetic phases of Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ and topological spin textures.

Title: Temperature overshooting in the Mpemba effect of frictional active matter
Authors: Alexander P. Antonov, Hartmut Löwen
Abstract: The traditional Mpemba effect refers to an anomalous cooling phenomenon when an initial hotter system cools down faster than an initial warm system. Such counterintuitive behavior has been confirmed and explored across phase transitions in condensed matter systems and also for colloidal particles exposed to a double-well potential. Here we predict a frictional Mpemba effect for a macroscopic body moving actively on a surface governed by Coulomb (dry) friction. For an initial high temperature, relaxation towards a cold state occurs much faster than that for an intermediate initial temperature, due to a large temperature overshooting in the latter case. This frictional Mpemba effect can be exploited to steer the motion of robots and granules.

Title: Effect of RKKY and dipolar interaction on the nucleation of skyrmion in Pt/Co multilayer with Ir spacer
Authors: Shaktiranjan Mohanty, Brindaban Ojha, Bhuvneshwari Sharma, Ashutosh Rath, Chandrasekhar Murapaka, Subhankar Bedanta
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions, topologically protected spin textures, have emerged as promising candidates for next-generation spintronic applications. In this study, we investigate the stabilization of skyrmionic states in a uniquely engineered Pt/Co multilayer system with an Ir spacer, where both Ruderman Kittel Kasuya Yosida (RKKY) and dipolar interactions play a crucial role. The studied multilayer structure consists of a synthetic antiferromagnetic (SAF) configuration, where a single Ir layer facilitates strong antiferromagnetic coupling between two ferromagnetic regions: FM1 (top) and FM2 (bottom), each formed by repeated Co layers separated by Pt, enabling significant dipolar interactions. This FM1/Ir/FM2 configuration results in a distinctive skyrmionic hysteresis loop, driven by the interplay of dipolar and RKKY interactions. Magnetic force microscopy (MFM) imaging confirms the nucleation of isolated skyrmions, while magnetotransport measurements reveal a finite topological Hall effect (THE), indicating the chiral nature of these spin textures. Furthermore, we demonstrate that increasing the Co layer thickness leads to a reduction in magnetic anisotropy, which in turn results in the formation of relatively larger and denser skyrmions. Our findings establish a robust approach for stabilizing skyrmions through the combined effects of dipolar and RKKY interactions, offering new pathways for controlled skyrmion manipulation in spintronic devices.

Title: Extended Factorization Machine Annealing for Rapid Discovery of Transparent Conducting Materials
Authors: Daisuke Makino, Tatsuya Goto, Yoshinori Suga
Abstract: The development of novel transparent conducting materials (TCMs) is essential for enhancing the performance and reducing the cost of next-generation devices such as solar cells and displays. In this research, we focus on the (Al$_x$Ga$_y$In$_z$)$_2$O$_3$ system and extend the FMA framework, which combines a Factorization Machine (FM) and annealing, to search for optimal compositions and crystal structures with high accuracy and low cost. The proposed method introduces (i) the binarization of continuous variables, (ii) the utilization of good solutions using a Hopfield network, (iii) the activation of global search through adaptive random flips, and (iv) fine-tuning via a bit-string local search. Validation using the (Al$_x$Ga$_y$In$_z$)$_2$O$_3$ data from the Kaggle "Nomad2018 Predicting Transparent Conductors" competition demonstrated that our method achieves faster and more accurate searches than Bayesian optimization and genetic algorithms. Furthermore, its application to multi-objective optimization showed its capability in designing materials by simultaneously considering both the band gap and formation energy. These results suggest that applying our method to larger, more complex search problems and diverse material designs that reflect realistic experimental conditions is expected to contribute to the further advancement of materials informatics.

Title: Giant odd-parity magnetoresistance from proximity-induced topological states
Authors: Tomoki Hotta, Le Duc Anh, Takahiro Chiba, Yohei Kota, Masaaki Tanaka
Abstract: Magnetoresistance typically exhibits even symmetry with respect to the magnetic field, owing to time reversal symmetry (TRS) as dictated by Onsager reciprocity relations. However, in certain systems where TRS is broken, magnetoresistance may acquire an odd component with respect to the magnetic field, referred to as odd parity magnetoresistance (OMR). To date, reported OMR values have been modest, usually restricted to a few tens of percent even under high magnetic fields. Here, we report the discovery of a giant OMR reaching up to 1,150% under a relatively low field of 1 T in a heterostructure composed of 3 nm thick alpha Sn and a ferromagnetic semiconductor, (In,Fe)Sb. Although alpha Sn in this thickness range is a trivial narrow gap semiconductor, analysis of Shubnikov de Haas oscillations combined with ab initio calculations reveals the emergence of tilted topological surface states, induced via magnetic proximity from the (In,Fe)Sb layer. The observed OMR behavior is well explained by a Boltzmann transport model assuming the presence of oppositely tilted Weyl cones in the alpha Sn band structure. Our findings not only shed new light on the physics of OMR but also suggest promising avenues for its application in electronic and spintronic devices, such as ultrasensitive magnetic sensors.

Title: Effect of quasiparticles on the parameters of a gap-engineered transmon
Authors: Daniil S. Antonenko, Pavel D. Kurilovich, Francisco J. Matute-Cañadas, Leonid I. Glazman
Abstract: We evaluate the quasiparticle contribution to the frequency shift and relaxation rates of a transmon with the Josephson junctions connecting superconductors that have unequal energy gaps. The gap difference substantially affects the transmon characteristics. We investigate their dependence on the density and effective temperature of the quasiparticles, and on the nominal (unperturbed by the quasiparticles) transmon frequency. At temperatures low compared to the qubit frequency, the gap difference can induce an anomalous positive frequency shift, resulting in a non-monotonic temperature dependence of the transmon frequency. The qubit relaxation rate exhibits a resonance when the qubit frequency matches the gap difference; the shape of the resonance is strongly temperature-dependent. We propose to use these effects to access the details of the quasiparticle energy distribution.

Title: Model Hamiltonian for Altermagnetic Topological Insulators
Authors: Rafael Gonzalez-Hernandez, Bernardo Uribe
Abstract: We present models of topological insulating Hamiltonians exhibiting intrinsic altermagnetic features, protected by combined three-fold or four-fold rotational symmetries with time-reversal. We demonstrate that the spin Chern number serves as a robust topological invariant in two-dimensional systems, while for three-dimensional structures, the topological nature is characterized by the spin Chern numbers computed on the $k_z$=$0$ and $k_z$=$\pi$ planes. The resulting phases support symmetry-protected boundary modes, including corner, hinges and surface states, whose structure is determined by the magnetic symmetry and the local magnetic moments. Our findings bridge the fields of altermagnetism and topological quantum matter, and establish a theoretical framework for engineering spintronic topological systems without net magnetization.

Title: Tuning the Topological Properties of the Antiferromagnetic V(Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_{x}$)$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ via Sb concentration
Authors: D. A-León, D.A. Landínez Téllez, J. Roa-Rojas, Rafael Gonzalez-Hernandez
Abstract: The investigation of topological materials has uncovered groundbreaking phases of matter with significant implications for quantum technologies. Here, we explore the antiferromagnetic topological insulator family V(Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_{x}$)$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ ($x$=$0$, $0.5$, $1$), formed by introducing vanadium telluride (VTe) layers into the layered topological insulator (Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_{x}$)$_{2}$Te$_{3}$. Our results reveal the tunability of the spin Hall conductivity (SHC) and its topological contribution, quantified by the recently introduced average Spin Chern Number (ASCN), via Sb concentration. The materials' strong topological insulating behavior is established through spin-orbit coupling-induced band inversions, nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariants, and the presence of topological surface states. These findings position V(Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_{x}$)$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ as promising candidates for next-generation spintronic devices and advanced quantum applications.

Title: Altermagnetism in 6H perovskites
Authors: S.V. Streltsov, S.-W. Cheong
Abstract: The combination of a centrosymmetric crystallographic structure with local structural alternations and collinear antiferromagnetism can lead to broken PT (Parity $\times$ Time-reversal) symmetry, resulting in altermagnets with non-relativistic spin-split bands. The 6H perovskites with composition A$_3$BB'$_2$O$_9$ exhibit unique layered structural alternations and typically adopt an antiferromagnetic ground state. Here, we report the discovery that several 6H perovskites are indeed altermagnets exhibiting non-relativistic spin-split bands. We also explore the possible presence of net magnetization due to spin-orbit coupling in these materials, as well as the manifestation of giant piezomagnetism. Since the single crystals of 6H perovskites can be readily grown and cleavable, our findings provide a new avenue to study the cleaved atomically-flat surfaces of altermagnets with advanced experimental techniques such as spin-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) or spin-resolved angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) to explore their spin splitting nature.

Title: Altermagnetism and anomalous Hall effect in LaMn2Si2
Authors: S.V. Streltsov, D.M. Korotin
Abstract: By combining symmetry analysis and direct density functional calculations including the spin-orbit coupling, we demonstrate that LaMn2Si2 is an M-type altermagnet. Our results predict a large anomalous Hall effect, with a non-zero xy component of -360 S/cm, accompanied by a pronounced magneto-optical response. Remarkably, electron doping of LaMn2Si2 is predicted to substantially enhance the Hall conductivity, with values reaching up to -650 S/cm. These results suggest that silicates with general formula RM2Si2 can be an interesting platform for studying both altermagnetism and anomalous Hall effect.

Title: Disorder driven crossover between anomalous Hall regimes in Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$
Authors: Sang-Eon Lee, Minkyu Park, W. Kice Brown, Vadym Kulichenko, Yan Xin, S. H. Rhim, Chanyong Hwang, Jaeyong Kim, Gregory T. McCandless, Julia Y. Chan, Luis Balicas
Abstract: The large anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) of the Fe$_3$(Ge,Ga)Te$_2$ compounds has attracted considerable attention. Here, we expose the intrinsic nature of AHC in Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ crystals characterized by high conductivities, which show disorder-independent AHC with a pronounced value $\sigma_{xy}^{\text{c}}\approx$ 420 $\Omega^{-1}$cm$^{-1}$. In the low conductivity regime, we observe the scaling relation $\sigma_{xy}\propto\sigma_{xx}^{1.6}$, which crosses over to $\sigma_{xy} \simeq \sigma_{xy}^{\text{c}}$ as $\sigma_{xx}$ increases. Disorder in low-conductivity crystals is confirmed by the broadening of a first-order transition between ferromagnetism and the ferrimagnetic ground state. Through density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we reveal that the dominant sources of Berry curvature are located a few hundred meV below the Fermi energy around the $\Gamma$-point. Therefore, Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ clearly exposes the disorder-induced crossover among distinct AHC regimes, previously inferred from measurements on different ferromagnets located in either side of the crossover region.

Title: Inhomogeneity identification by measuring magnetic quantum oscillations
Authors: Sang-Eon Lee, Myung-Hwa Jung
Abstract: This study explores the identification of sample inhomogeneity via magnetic quantum oscillations analysis in semimetal NbSb$_2$. By doping Bi and Cr, we obtained a homogeneous Bi-doped sample and an inhomogeneous Cr-doped sample, whose homogeneity was confirmed by comparing the magnetic quantum oscillation before and after grinding the samples. The magnetic quantum oscillations in the inhomogeneous sample exhibited a distinct phase shift and unusual field-dependent amplitude, believed to result from a non-uniform Fermi energy. The analysis of the magnetic quantum oscillations demonstrated that the homogeneous Bi-doped sample can be interpreted by the symmetric and Lorentzian effective Fermi energy distribution, while the inhomogeneous Cr-doped sample exhibited an asymmetric distribution, illustrating an unconventional violation of the Lifshitz-Kosevich formula. This research provides a novel method for identifying material inhomogeneity and mitigating potential misinterpretations of magnetic quantum oscillations' unusual phase, commonly seen as a nontrivial Berry phase indicator in topological materials studies.

Title: In-plane and interlayer magnetoresistance in FeSe
Authors: Taichi Terashima, Shinya Uji, Hiroaki Ikeda, Yuji Matsuda, Takasada Shibauchi, Shigeru Kasahara
Abstract: We report measurements of the in-plane and interlayer magnetoresistance on FeSe. The in-plane magnetoresistance $\Delta \rho_{ab}/\rho_{ab}(0)$ for $B \parallel c$ is positive below $T_s$ and grows with decreasing temperature, exceeding 2.5 at $T$ = 10 K and $B$ = 14 T. The field-direction dependence indicates that the in-plane magnetoresistance is basically determined by the $c$-axis component of the magnetic field. The interlayer magnetoresistance $\Delta \rho_{c}/\rho_{c}(0)$ is negative below $T_s$ but turns positive below $\sim$18 K, which is probably due to the contamination of the large in-plane magnetoresistance. The field-direction dependence of the interlayer magnetoresistance can approximately be described by a standard formula for quasi-two-dimensional electron systems except near $B \parallel ab$. The experimental magnetoresistance near $B \parallel ab$ is larger than the formula, which can be attributed to the so-called interlayer coherence peak. The large width of the peak indicates the correspondingly large interlayer transfer energy.

Title: Superconducting coherence boosted by outer-layer metallic screening in multilayered cuprates
Authors: Junhyeok Jeong, Kifu Kurokawa, Shiro Sakai, Tomotaka Nakayama, Kotaro Ando, Naoshi Ogane, Soonsang Huh, Matthew D. Watson, Timur K. Kim, Cephise Cacho, Chun Lin, Makoto Hashimoto, Donghui Lu, Takami Tohyama, Kazuyasu Tokiwa, Takeshi Kondo
Abstract: In multilayered high-Tc cuprates with three or more CuO2 layers per unit cell, the inner CuO2 planes (IPs) are spatially separated from the dopant layers and thus remain cleaner than the outer planes (OPs). While both interlayer coupling and the presence of clean IPs have been proposed as key factors enhancing superconductivity, their individual roles have been difficult to disentangle, as IPs and OPs typically become superconducting simultaneously. Here we investigate five-layer (Cu,C)Ba2Ca4Cu5Oy (Cu1245) with Tc = 78 K and three-layer Ba2Ca2Cu3O6(F,O)2 (F0223) with Tc = 100 K using ARPES, and uncover an unprecedented situation, in which only the IPs become superconducting while the OPs remain metallic at low temperatures. Model calculations indicate that more than 95% of the OP wavefunction remains confined to OP itself, with minimal hybridization from the superconducting IPs. In particular, we experimentally realize an ideal configuration: a single superconducting CuO2 layer sandwiched between heavily overdoped metallic outer layers, which screen disorder originating from the dopant layers. Strikingly, this clean CuO2 layer exhibits the largest superconducting gap among all known cuprates and coherent Bogoliubov peaks extending beyond the antiferromagnetic zone boundary -- long regarded as the boundary beyond which coherence vanishes in heavily underdoped cuprates. Furthermore, a widely extended coherent flat band emerges at the Brillouin zone edge, overcoming the pseudogap damping effect. Our results introduce a new physical parameter, the degree of screening, to investigate the competition between superconductivity and the pseudogap, potentially shedding new light on its origin. The nearly disorder-free superconducting CuO2 layers offer a model platform for bridging the gap between disordered real materials and idealized theoretical models, which generally neglect disorder effects.

Title: AC/DC spin current in ferromagnet/superconductor/normal metal trilayer systems
Authors: Koki Mizuno, Hirone Ishida, Manato Teranishi
Abstract: Spin pumping with superconductors has been extensively studied, particularly in double-layer systems. In this study, we investigate spin pumping in a trilayer system comprising a ferromagnetic insulator (FMI), a superconductor (SC), and a normal metal (NM). We derive the AC and DC spin currents in the NM layer induced by spin motion in the FMI under circularly polarized microwave irradiation. If we treat the spin motion as classical, the AC spin current is expressed. On the other hand, if we treat the spin motion as quantum quasiparticles, the DC spin current is derived. After these derivations, while the computational cost of evaluating the spin current is extremely high, we mitigate this using the Quantics Tensor Cross Interpolation (QTCI) method. We present numerical results showing the dependence of the spin current on temperature, microwave frequency, and superconductor layer thickness. Notably, the temperature dependence of AC and DC spin currents exhibits a coherence peak. Furthermore, we have discovered a transition structure in the dependence of the spin current on the thickness of the superconductor layer, where the dependence changes after a particular frequency.

Title: Spin-State Engineering of Single Titanium Adsorbates on Ultrathin Magnesium Oxide
Authors: Soo-hyon Phark, Hong Thi Bui, We-hyo Seo, Yaowu Liu, Valeria Sheina, Curie Lee, Christoph Wolf, Andreas J. Heinrich, Roberto Robles, Nicolas Lorente
Abstract: Single atomic adsorbates on ultrathin insulating films provide a promising route toward bottom-up quantum architectures based on atomically identical yet individually addressable spin qubits on solid surfaces. A key challenge in engineering quantum-coherent spin nanostructures lies in understanding and controlling the spin state of individual adsorbates. In this work, we investigate single titanium (Ti) atoms adsorbed on MgO/Ag(100) surfaces using a combined scanning tunneling microscopy and electron spin resonance. Our measurements reveal two distinct spin states, $S = 1/2$ and $S = 1$, depending on the local adsorption site and the thickness of the MgO film. Density functional theory calculations suggest a Ti$^+$ configuration for the Ti adsorbates with approximately 3 electrons in the 4$s$ and 3$d$ valence shells. Using a multi-orbital atomic multiplet calculations the site dependence of the spin can be rationalized as a charge redistribution between spin-polarizing and depolarizing orbitals. These findings underscore the potential of surface-supported single atoms as spin qubits with tunable spin and charge states, enabling atom-by-atom control in the realization of a versatile quantum platform on surfaces.

Title: Magnetic order dependent photoluminescence from high energy excitons in hBN protected few-layer CrSBr
Authors: Xiaohua Wu, Junyang Chen, Mingqiang Gu, Yujun Zhang, Shanmin Wang, Yanan Dai, Qihang Liu, Yue Zhao, Mingyuan Huang
Abstract: The detection and manipulation of the spin configurations in layered magnetic semiconductors hold significant interest for developing spintronic devices in two-dimensional limit. In this letter, we report a systematical study on the photoluminescence (PL) from the high energy excitons in few-layer CrSBr and its application on detecting the spin configurations. Besides the broad excitonic emission peak (Xl) at around 1.34 eV, we also observed another strong excitonic emission peak (Xh) at around 1.37 eV in hBN encapsulated 2L sample, which splits into two peaks in 3L and 4L samples. With help of the first principles calculations, we conclude that the Xh peak is associated with the transition between the top valence band and the second lowest conduction band, which is forbidden by the inversion symmetry in 1L CrSBr. Furthermore, the position and intensity of the Xh peak are strongly dependent on the interlayer magnetic order of the CrSBr samples, which provides an efficient way to probe their spin configurations. In addition, when the magnetic field is applied at the easy axis direction, we resolve an intermediate magnetic state besides the antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic states in 3L and 4L samples. Our results reveal few-layer CrSBr as an ideal platform to study the interaction between the excitons and magnetism.

Title: First-principles study of Rh- and Pd-based kagome-layered shandites
Authors: Luca Buiarelli, Turan Birol, Brian M. Andersen, Morten H. Christensen
Abstract: The shandite structure hosts transition metals arranged in kagome layers stacked rhombohedrally, and interspersed with post-transition metal ions and chalcogens. The electronic states near the Fermi level are dominated by the transition metal $d$-orbitals and feature saddle points near several of the high-symmetry positions of the Brillouin zone, most notably the F and L points. Combining symmetry considerations with ab initio methods, we study the electronic and structural properties of these materials with an emphasis on the connection between electronic saddle points at specific momenta and structural instabilities at these momenta. While the parent compounds studied are all found to be structurally stable in the $R\bar{3}m$ space group under ambient conditions we show that, in specific compounds, moving the saddle point closer to the Fermi level using either hydrostatic pressure or doping, can induce a structural instability. The importance of the electronic degrees of freedom in driving this instability is supported by the dependence of the frequency of the soft phonon mode on the electronic smearing temperature, as is the case in charge density wave materials. Our first-principles calculations show that as the smearing temperature is increased, the compound becomes structurally stable again. Our findings survey the structural properties of a large family of shandite materials and shed light on the role played by saddle points in the electronic structure in driving structural instabilities in rhombohedrally stacked kagome-layered materials belonging to the $R\bar{3}m$ space group.

Title: Combinatorial Development of Amorphous/nanocrystalline Biphase Soft Magnetic Alloys with Silicon-steel like Saturated Magnetic Induction
Authors: Xuesong Li, Jing Zhou, Xiao Liu, Xibei Hou, Tengyu Guo, Bo Wu, Baoan Sun, Weihua Wang, Haiyang Bai
Abstract: Maximization saturation magnetic induction (Bs) of soft magnetic alloys is essential for the high power-density electromagnetic devices. However, identifying the alloy compositions with high Bs often replies on the lab-intensive melt casting method and a high-throughput characterization on magnetic properties remains challenging. Here, we develop a new combinatorial method for fast screening alloys with optimal soft magnetic properties based on the high-throughput MOKE screening method. Based on the combinatorial method, we found that the alloys with a combination of high Bs and low coercivity (Hc) tend to have a feature of amorphous-nanocrystalline biphase microstructure. We also identified an amorphous/nanocrystalline alloy film with the composition the Fe68.09Co17.02B10.9Si4, exhibiting an ultra-high Bs up to 2.02 T that surpasses all amorphous/nanocrystalline alloys reported so far and is comparable to that of silicon steels, together with a high resistivity of 882 {\mu}{\Omega} {\dot} cm, about 17 times of silicon steels. Our high-throughput magnetic screening method provides a paradigm for understanding the relationship between microstructure and magnetic properties and the development of the next-generation soft magnetic materials.

Title: Graphene-based quantum heterospin graphs
Authors: Gabriel Martínez-Carracedo, Amador García-Fuente, László Oroszlány, László Szunyogh, Jaime Ferrer
Abstract: We investigate from first principles a variety of low-dimensional open quantum spin systems based on magnetic nanographene structures that contain spin-1/2 and spin-1 triangulenes and/or olympicenes. These graphene nanostructures behave as localized spins and can be effectively described by a quantum bilinear-biquadratic Heisenberg Hamiltonian, for which we will compute the energy spectrum and the quantum numbers associated with the low-energy eigenstates. We propose the experimental realization of antiferromagnetic alternating spin chains using these graphene nanostructures, which result in ferrimagnetic systems whose ground state spin and degeneracy depend on the length of the chain. We also identify a double degeneracy in the total spin quantum number $S$ in the first excited state for three-leg spin graphs (3-LSGs). This degeneracy depends on both the number of sites and the spin species that compose the 3-LSG. We identify the double degeneracy of the first excited state as a consequence of swapping transformation symmetry of the Hamiltonian.

Title: Terahertz spin-orbit torque as a drive of spin dynamics in insulating antiferromagnet Cr$_{2}$O$_{3}$
Authors: R.M. Dubrovin, Z.V. Gareeva, A.V. Kimel, A.K. Zvezdin
Abstract: Contrary to conventional wisdom that spin dynamics induced by current are exclusive to metallic magnets, we theoretically predict that such phenomena can also be realized in magnetic insulators, specifically in the magnetoelectric antiferromagnet $\mathrm{Cr}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}$. We reveal that the displacement current driven by the THz electric field is able to generate a N{é}el spin-orbit torque in this insulating system. By introducing an alternative electric dipole order parameter arising from the dipole moment at $\mathrm{Cr}^{3+}$ sites, we combine symmetry analysis with a Lagrangian approach and uncover that the displacement current couples to the antiferromagnetic spins and enables ultrafast control of antiferromagnetic order. The derived equations of motion show that this effect competes with the linear magnetoelectric response, offering a novel pathway for manipulating antiferromagnetic order in insulators. Our findings establish insulator antiferromagnets as a viable platform for electric field driven antiferromagnetic spintronics and provide general design principles for non-metallic spin-orbit torque materials.

Title: Machine learning Landau free energy potentials
Authors: Mauro Pulzone, Natalya S. Fedorova, Hugo Aramberri, Jorge Íñiguez-González
Abstract: We show how to construct Landau-like free energy potentials using a machine-learning approach. For concreteness, we focus on perovskite oxide PbTiO$_{3}$. We work with a training set obtained from Monte Carlo simulations based on an atomistic ''second-principles'' potential for PbTiO$_{3}$. We rely exclusively on data that would be experimentally accessible -- i.e., temperature-dependent polarization and strain, both with and without external electric fields and stresses applied --, to explore scenarios where the training set could be obtained from laboratory measurements. We introduce a scheme that allows us to identify optimal polynomial models of the temperature-dependent free energy surface, mapped as a function of the homogeneous electric polarization and homogeneous strain. Our results for PbTiO$_{3}$ show that a very simple polynomial -- where only two parameters depend linearly on temperature -- is sufficient to yield a correct description of the material's behavior. Remarkably, the obtained models also capture the subtle couplings by which elastic strain controls key features of ferroelectricity in PbTiO$_{3}$ -- i.e., the symmetry of the polar phase and the discontinuous character of the transition --, despite the fact that no effort was made to include such information in the training set. We emphasize the distinctive aspects of our methodology (which relies on an original form of validation step) by comparing it with the usual machine-learning approach for model construction. Our results illustrate how physically motivated models can have remarkable predictive power, even if they are derived from a limited amount of data. We argue that such ''third-principles'' models can be the basis for predictive macroscopic or mesoscopic simulations of ferroelectrics and other materials undergoing non-reconstructive structural transitions.

Title: Low energy excitations in A-site ordered SmBaMn2O6
Authors: Mirian Garcia Fernandez, Abhishek Nag, Stefano Agrestini, Sahil Tippireddy, Dirk Backes, Urs Staub, Taka-hisa Arima, Kejin Zhou
Abstract: The electron in a solid can be considered a bound state of the three independent, fundamental degrees of freedom creating quasi-particles: spinons, carrying the electron spin; plasmons carrying the collective charge mode and orbitons carrying its orbital degree of freedom. These fundamental degrees of freedom could form ordering states in which dynamics or collective motions could occurr and manifest as low-energy excitations. The exotic properties that appear in the materials exhibiting these electronic orderings are associated with these low-energy excitations. Although the orbital order (OO) and its coupling to the spin system creates very interesting phenomena, the microscopic origin of OO has been much less explored than other electronic properties as it is very difficult to directly access experimental information from OO. Due to the recent improvement in energy resolution and flux, soft x-ray resonant inelastic scattering (RIXS) allows for a re-examination of orbital excitations in manganites. Here, we present a study of low energy excitations in half doped A-site ordered SmBaMn_{2}O_{6} through a combination of RIXS and soft x-ray resonant elastic scattering (REXS) measurements. The obtained experimental data confirm the OO at \mathbf{q} = (0.25, 0.25, 0) and find various low energy excitations below 200 meV. while several excitations can be assigned to be of magnetic and phononic origin, a group of excitations between 80 and 200 meV show a temperature dependence distinctively following that of the OO making them possible candidates for orbital excitations.

Title: Multilayer Cryogenic Powder Filters with Low Parasitic Capacitance
Authors: Itishree Pradhan, Hao Li, Alina Rupp, Yosuke Sato, Henri Vo Van Qui, Miuko Tanaka, Toshiya Ideue, Erwann Bocquillon, Masayuki Hashisaka
Abstract: We report the development of a cryogenic powder filter that simultaneously offers high attenuation of radio-frequency (RF) signals in the gigahertz (GHz) range and minimized parasitic capacitance to ground. Conventional powder filters, which consist of a signal line passing through a metal powder-filled housing, attenuate high-frequency signals via the skin effect. However, these designs often suffer from significant parasitic capacitance between the signal line and the grounded chassis, which can compromise the performance of sensitive measurement setups by limiting their frequency bandwidth. In this work, we demonstrate that a multilayer powder filter design effectively achieves both high RF attenuation and reduced parasitic capacitance. This solution suppresses sample heating due to the unintentional intrusion of RF signals through the wiring, without degrading the performance of the measurement setup.

Title: Low Temperature Formation of Crystalline VO2 Domains in Porous 1 Nanocolumnar Thin Films for Thermochromic Applications
Authors: H. Acosta-Rivera, V. Rico, F.J. Ferrer, T.C. Rojas, R. Alvarez, N. Martin, A.R. Gonzalez-Elipe, A. Palmero
Abstract: The formation of VO2 crystalline domains in amorphous substoichiometric nanocolumnar VOx thin films subjected to an oxidation process at temperatures below 300°C has been studied. It is obtained that values of [O]/[V] above 1.9 lead to the sole formation of V2O5 after oxidation, while values below 1.9 favor the formation of VO2, V3O7 and V2O5 crystalline domains for temperatures as low as 260°C. Moreover, it is found that the adsorption of oxygen and its incorporation into the film network produce a relevant volume expansion in a so-called swelling mechanism that makes pores shrink. Under some specific conditions, the low temperature oxidation does not only trigger the formation of VO2 domains but also a drastic reduction of oxygen-deficient amorphous VOx in the films, which clearly improves the overall transparency and thermochromic modulation capabilities. The changes in the optical and electrical properties of these films during the metal-insulator transition have been studied, finding the best performance when the stoichiometry of the film before oxidation is [O]/[V]=1.5 and the oxidation temperature 280°C. These conditions yield a relatively transparent coating that presents an optical modulation in the near-infrared range of nearly 50% and a drop of electrical resistivity of more than two orders of magnitude. A tentative model based on the volume increase experienced by film upon oxidation is proposed to link the structural/chemical features of the films and the formation of VO2 domains at such relatively low temperatures.

Title: Nonlinear Magnetoelectric Edelstein Effect
Authors: Jinxiong Jia, Longjun Xiang, Zhenhua Qiao, Jian Wang
Abstract: The linear Edelstein effect is a cornerstone phenomenon in spintronics that describes the generation of spin magnetization in response to an applied electric field. Recent theoretical advances have reignited interest in its nonlinear counterpart, the nonlinear Edelstein effect, in which spin magnetization is induced by a second-order electric field. However, the intrinsic contribution to both effects is generally forbidden in systems preserving time-reversal symmetry ($\mathcal{T}$) or composite symmetries such as $\mathcal{T}\tau_{1/2}$, where $\tau_{1/2}$ denotes a half-lattice translation. In such systems, spin magnetization typically emerges either from extrinsic mechanisms but limited to metals due to their Fermi-surface property, or from dynamical electric fields with a terahertz driving frequency. Here, we propose a new mechanism for spin magnetization, arising from the interplay of magnetic and electric fields, termed the nonlinear magnetoelectric Edelstein effect. Remarkably, its intrinsic component, determined purely by the material's band structure, can appear even in $\mathcal{T}$-invariant materials, but lacking inversion symmetry ($\mathcal{P}$), including insulators. On the other hand, we illustrate that its extrinsic component can serve as a sensitive indicator of the Néel vector reversal in $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetric antiferromagnetic materials, offering a novel route for antiferromagnetic order detection. To validate our theory, we perform explicit calculations using a two-band Dirac model and a tight-binding model on a honeycomb lattice, finding that both effects yield sizable spin magnetization. Our findings establish the nonlinear magnetoelectric Edelstein effect as a versatile platform for both exploring nonlinear spin physics and enabling symmetry-based detection of antiferromagnetic order.

Title: On the influence of powder particle size on single-track formation in laser powder bed fusion of AlSi10Mg alloy
Authors: Y. Solyaev, V. Dobryanskiy, Nguyen Long, Stanislav Chernyshikhin
Abstract: In this paper, we present the results of single-track experiments conducted for different fractions of standard AlSi10Mg powder, which were sieved to achieve varying mean size of the particles. We observed strong differences in the melting behaviour of fractions at relatively low levels of input energy in laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) process. Namely, the remarkable particle size effect arises for the position of lack of fusion boundary, i.e. for the range of process parameters where the laser power becomes sufficient for complete through-thickness melting of the powder layer at given laser scanning speed. We established that this boundary corresponds to an approximately constant linear energy density at low levels of Peclet number (Pe < 2), while the constant enthalpy density defines this boundary at the higher levels (Pe > 2). Specifically, when the mean particle size ranges from 28 to 64 microns, the required linear energy density for stable track formation ranges from 50 to 167 J/m and the nominal enthalpy density ranges from 4.4 to 15 J/mm^3. Based on the scaling law analysis and numerical simulations, we show that observed phenomena can be attributed to the change of absorptivity of powder layer, which depends on particle size and packing density. Also, we show that the values of absorptivity identified based on the analysis of position of lack of fusion boundary (0.13-0.38 for powder size 64-28 microns) correlate well with those found from the analysis of melt pool width in the formed single-tracks.

Title: Spintronic temperature nanosensor based on the resonance response of a skyrmion-hosting magnetic tunnel junction
Authors: Michail Lianeris, Davi Rodrigues, Andrea Meo, Dimitris Kechrakos, Anna Giordano, Mario Carpentieri, Giovanni Finocchio, Riccardo Tomasello
Abstract: The increasing need for efficient thermal management in nanoelectronics requires innovative thermal sensing solutions, as conventional sensors often exhibit nonlinear responses, low sensitivity, and complex calibration. We predict a temperature dependence in the response of existing skyrmion based spintronic diodes and propose their use as nanoscale thermal sensors. These devices leverage magnetic skyrmions topologically protected spin textures known for their robustness, nanoscale dimensions, and low power dynamics. We demonstrate high thermal sensitivity with a linear temperature response over a wide range. This linearity, observed in both the amplitude and frequency of the skyrmion excitation, ensures redundancy that enables precise and reliable temperature measurement. In addition, the use of multilayer systems enhances the sensitivity and robustness of the device. These results provide a foundation for skyrmion-based caloritronic devices with promising applications in spintronic sensors, thermal management, nanoelectronics, and skyrmion-caloritronics.

Title: Quantum typicality approach to energy flow between two spin-chain domains at different temperatures
Authors: Laurenz Beckemeyer, Markus Kraft, Mariel Kempa, Dirk Schuricht, Robin Steinigeweg
Abstract: We discuss a quantum typicality approach to examine systems composed of two subsystems at different temperatures. While dynamical quantum typicality is usually used to simulate high-temperature dynamics, we also investigate low-temperature dynamics using the method. To test our method, we investigate the energy current between subsystems at different temperatures in various paradigmatic spin-1/2 chains, specifically the XX chain, the critical transverse-field Ising chain, and the XXZ chain. We compare our numerics to existing analytical results and find a convincing agreement for the energy current in the steady state for all considered models and temperatures.

Title: Enhanced negative capacitance in La-doped Pb(Zr$_{0.4}$Ti$_{0.6}$)O$_3$ ferroelectric capacitor by tuning bias voltage pulse to induce intrinsic domain switching kinetics
Authors: Ganga S. Kumar, Sudipta Goswami, Shubhasree Chatterjee, Dilruba Hasina, Miral Verma, Devajyoti Mukherjee, Chandan Kumar Ghosh, Dipten Bhattacharya
Abstract: We report a remarkable enhancement of specific negative capacitance in multidomain La-doped Pb(Zr$_{0.4}$Ti$_{0.6}$)O$_3$ (PLZT) ferroelectric capacitors when bias voltage pulse profile (amplitude and timescale) induces switching of the ferroelectric domains following intrinsic switching kinetics associated with minimum energy barrier. This is because of emergence of maximum domain wall density during ``switching" of the domains. Domain configuration changes from such an ``optimum" state if higher or lower bias voltage is applied at a much faster or slower rate. Phase-field simulation using time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation shows dependence of the domain wall density during switching on the bias voltage amplitude and its maximization at a specific bias voltage amplitude. The radius of curvature of the resulting polarization ($P$) versus voltage ($V$) hysteresis loop at the coercive voltage ($V_C$) also turns out to be depending on whether or not intrinsic switching kinetics is followed. All these results indicate a close correlation among the bias voltage pulse profile (amplitude and time scale), domain wall density during switching, shape of the resulting ferroelectric hysteresis loop, and the transient negative capacitance. It may have important ramifications both in the context of physics behind negative capacitance in a multidomain ferroelectric capacitor and devices being developed by exploiting its advantages.

Title: Magnetically Programmable Surface Acoustic Wave Filters: Device Concept and Predictive Modeling
Authors: Michael K. Steinbauer, Peter Flauger, Matthias Küß, Stephan Glamsch, Emeline D. S. Nysten, Matthias Weiß, Dieter Suess, Hubert J. Krenner, Manfred Albrecht, Claas Abert
Abstract: Filtering surface acoustic wave (SAW) signals of specified frequencies depending on the strength of an external magnetic field in a magnetostrictive material has garnered significant interest due to its potential scientific and industrial applications. Here, we propose a device that achieves selective SAW attenuation by instead programming its internal magnetic state. To this end, we perform micromagnetic simulations for the magnetoelastic interaction of the Rayleigh SAW mode with spin waves (SWs) in exchange-decoupled Co/Ni islets on a piezoelectric LiTaO$_3$ substrate. Due to the islets exhibiting perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, the stray-field interaction between them leads to a shift in the SW dispersion depending on the magnetic alignment of neighboring islets. This significantly changes the efficiency of the magnetoelastic interaction at specified frequencies. We predict changes in SAW transmission of 28.9 dB/mm at 3.8 GHz depending on the state of the device. For the efficient simulation of the device, we extend a prior energy conservation argument based on analytical solutions of the SW to finite-difference numerical calculations, enabling the modeling of arbitrary magnetization patterns like the proposed islet-based design.

Title: Sextets in four-terminal Josephson junctions
Authors: Miriam Rike Ebert, David Christian Ohnmacht, Wolfgang Belzig, Juan Carlos Cuevas
Abstract: Multiterminal superconducting junctions have revitalized the investigation of the Josephson effect. One of the most interesting aspects of these hybrid systems is the occurrence of multi-Cooper pair tunneling processes that have no analog in two-terminal devices. Such correlated tunneling events are also intimately connected to the Andreev bound states (ABSs) supported by these structures. Josephson junctions with four superconducting terminals have attracted special attention because they are predicted to support ABSs with nontrivial topological properties. Here, we present a theoretical study of sextets, which are correlated tunneling processes involving three Cooper pairs and four different superconducting terminals. We investigate how sextets can be identified from the analysis of the current-phase relation, we show how sextets are connected to the hybridization of ABSs, and we discuss their existence in recent experiments on four-terminal devices realized in hybrid Al/InAs heterostructures.

Title: Emergence of long-range non-equilibrium correlations in free liquid diffusion

Eyink (2,3) ((1) Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Sapienza University of Rome, (2) Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics, The Johns Hopkins University, (3) Department of Physics, The Johns Hopkins University)
Abstract: It is experimentally well-established that non-equilibrium long-range correlations of concentration fluctuations appear in free diffusion of a solute in a solvent, but it remains unknown how such correlations are established dynamically. We address this problem in a model of Donev, Fai \& Vanden-Eijnden (DFV), obtained from the high-Schmidt limit of the Landau-Lifschitz fluctuating hydrodynamic equations for a binary mixture. We consider an initial planar interface of the mean concentration field in an infinite space domain, idealizing prior experiments. Using methods borrowed from turbulence theory, we show both analytically and numerically that a quasi-steady regime with self-similar time decay of concentration correlations appears at long time. In addition to the expected ``giant concentration fluctuations'' with correlations $\propto r$ for $r\lesssim L(t)=(Dt)^{1/2},$ with diffusivity $D,$ a new regime with spatial decay $\propto 1/r$ appears for $r\gtrsim L(t).$ The quasi-steady regime arises from an initial stage of transient growth $\propto t,$ confirming the prediction of DFV for $r\gtrsim L(t)$ and discovering an analogous result for $r\lesssim L(t).$ Our results give new insight into the emergence of non-equilibrium long-range correlations and provide novel predictions that may be investigated experimentally.

Title: Run-and-Tumble Particles Learning Chemotaxis
Authors: Nicholas Tovazzi, Gorka Muñoz-Gil, Michele Caraglio
Abstract: Through evolution, bacteria have developed the ability to perform chemotactic motion in order to find nourishment. By adopting a machine learning approach, we aim to understand how this behavior arises. We consider run-and-tumble agents able to tune the instantaneous probability of switching between the run and the tumble phase. When such agents are navigating in an environment characterized by a concentration field pointing towards a circular target, we investigate how a chemotactic strategy may be learned starting from unbiased run-and-tumble dynamics. We compare the learning performances of agents that sense only the instantaneous concentration with those of agents having a short-term memory that allows them to perform temporal comparisons. While both types of learning agents develop successful target-search policies, we demonstrate that those achieved by agents endowed with temporal comparison abilities are significantly more efficient, particularly when the initial distance from the target is large. Finally, we also show that when an additional length scale is imposed, for example by fixing the initial distance to the target, the learning agents can leverage this information to further improve their efficiency in locating the target.

Title: Printable Nanocomposites with Superparamagnetic Maghemite ($γ$-Fe$_2$O$_3$) Particles for Microinductor-core Applications
Authors: Mathias Zambach, Miriam Varón, Thomas Veile, Bima N. Sanusi, Matti Knaapila, Anders M. Jørgensen, László Almásy, Christer Johansson, Ziwei Ouyang, M. Beleggia, Cathrine Frandsen
Abstract: We here present printable and castable magnetic nanocomposites containing superparamagnetic 11$\pm$3 nm $\gamma$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ particles in an insulating poly-vinyl alcohol polymer matrix. The nanocomposites feature well-dispersed particles with volume fractions between 10 and 45 \%, as confirmed by small-angle neutron scattering. The magnetic volume susceptibility is as high as 17, together with negligible hysteresis at low frequency, and constant AC-response up to the high-kHz range. Measured hysteresis curves at 100-900 kHz with up to 110 mT induced $B$-fields in the nanocomposite show that power losses depend on $B$-field squared, and frequency to the power of 1-1.3. The only loss mechanism in the nanocomposite is hysteresis losses at $>$100 kHz frequencies, where the largest particles in the 11$\pm$3 nm distribution transition from the superparamagnetic to blocked regime. To mitigate the resulting hysteresis losses (up 10$^2$-10$^5$ kW/m$^3$) a more narrow particle size distribution could be used for future materials. The presented material is eddy current-free and easily integrated into micro-fabrication protocols, as we demonstrate by fabrication of 3-turn print circuit board based inductors with cast/manual printed nanocomposite inductor cores, on which induction has been measured up to 100 MHz.

Abstract: We present the structural, magnetic, and magnetocaloric properties of amorphous thin films Tb-Co and Dy-Co with stoichiometry Tb$_{31}$Co$_{69}$ and Dy$_{31}$Co$_{69}$, deposited on naturally oxidized silicon Si (100) substrates. Samples with a thickness $d=50$ nm covered with a protective Au overlayer with a thickness $d_{\rm Au} =5 $ nm were produced using the pulsed laser deposition technique. The X-ray diffraction analysis indicated the presence of a crystallized Laves phase in the prepared materials. Magnetization measurements as a function of temperature revealed ferrimagnetic behavior in both samples. We estimated the compensation temperature $T_{\rm comp}$ of the amorphous phase for Tb$_{31}$Co$_{69}$ at 81.5 K and for Dy$_{31}$Co$_{69}$ at 88.5 K, while we found the Curie temperature $T_{\rm C,\ Laves}$ of the crystallized Laves phases at 204.5 K and at 117 K, respectively. We investigated the magnetocaloric effect in a wide temperature range, covering $T_{\rm comp}$ of amorphous phases and $T_{\rm C,\ Laves}$ of crystallized Laves phases. The analysis for the magnetic field change of $\Delta \mu_0H=5$ T showed values of the magnetic entropy change of $-\Delta S_{\rm M}=4.9$ mJ cm$^{-3}$ K$^{-1}$ at $T_{\rm comp}$ and $-\Delta S_{\rm M}=6.6$ mJ cm$^{-3}$ K$^{-1}$ at $T_{\rm C,\ Laves}$ for Tb$_{31}$Co$_{69}$, while for Dy$_{31}$Co$_{69}$, we determined the values of $-\Delta S_{\rm M}=35$ mJ cm$^{-3}$ K$^{-1}$ at $T_{\rm comp}$ and $-\Delta S_{\rm M}=28$ mJ cm$^{-3}$ K$^{-1}$ at $T_{\rm C,\ Laves}$.

Title: Cohesion mediated layering in sheared grains
Authors: Khushi Mahajan, Chamkor Singh
Abstract: We consider pattern formation in a sheared dense mixture of cohesive and non-cohesive grains. Our findings show that cohesive grains, which would typically form distributed agglomerates, instead segregate into percolating stripes or layers when the cohesive grain concentration ($c_o$) and cohesion strength ($C$) increase -- in a way that the average agglomerate size and the average normal stress collapse onto a single curve when plotted against $c_oC$. Our central proposal is that the development of interfaces between cohesive and non-cohesive grains is akin to phase separation in binary molecular mixtures driven by an effective free energy, although we are dealing with a non-equilibrium system; we setup the segregation flux such that the effect of this free energy is activated only upon application of the external driving. By constructing the segregation flux proportional to the gradient of the variational derivative of the free energy, we closely reproduce the layering in the steady-state limit. We find a robust correspondence between the parameter $c_o C$ in the discrete simulations and the parameters in the free energy.

Title: Theory of ultrafast conductance modulation in electrochemical protonic synapses by multiphase polarization
Authors: Michael L. Li, Dingyu Shen, Jesus A. del Alamo, Martin Z. Bazant
Abstract: Three-terminal electrochemical ionic synapses (EIoS) have recently attracted interest for in-memory computing applications. These devices utilize electrochemical ion intercalation to modulate the ion concentration in the channel material. The electrical conductance, which is concentration dependent, can be read separately and mapped to a non-volatile memory state. To compete with other random access memory technologies, linear and symmetric conductance modulation is often sought after, properties typically thought to be limited by the slow ion diffusion timescale. A recent study by Onen et al.[1] examining protonic EIoS with a tungsten oxide (WO3) channel revealed that this limiting timescale seemed irrelevant, and linear conductance modulation was achieved over nanosecond timescales, much faster than the bulk ion diffusion. This contrasts with previous studies that have shown similar conductance modulation with pulse timescales of milliseconds to seconds. Understanding the phenomena behind these conductance modulation properties in EIoS systems remains a crucial question gating technological improvements to these devices. Here, we provide a theoretical explanation that demonstrates how linearity and symmetry arise from consistent control over the electrolyte-WO3 interface. Comparing these past works, changes in the WO3 channel crystallinity were identified, affecting material thermodynamics and revealing that the device achieving nanosecond pulse timescales underwent phase separation. Coupling of electric field polarizatino and increased electron conductivity in high-concentration filaments, the reaction environment at the gate electrode can be controlled, resulting in ideal conductance modulation within the diffusion-limited regime. This work highlights the potential for phase-separating systems to overcome the traditional diffusion barriers that limit EIoS performance.

Title: Active Filaments on Curved Surfaces: From Single Filaments to Dilute Suspensions
Authors: Giulia Janzen, Euan D. Mackay, Rastko Sknepnek, D. A. Matoz-Fernandez
Abstract: Curvature plays a central organizational role in active polymer dynamics. Using large-scale Langevin-dynamics simulations, we study active semiflexible filaments confined to smooth curved surfaces and map how curvature, bending rigidity, and activity interact. We find geodesic alignment, curvature lensing, and curvature-induced trapping. In particular, regions of negative Gaussian curvature localize filaments and hinder global surface exploration. These results show how surface geometry can be used to control the organization and transport of active matter on curved substrates

Title: How to Incorporate Higher-order Interactions in Analog Ising Machines
Authors: Robbe De Prins, Guy Van der Sande, Peter Bienstman, Thomas Van Vaerenbergh
Abstract: Ising machines (IMs) are specialized devices designed to efficiently solve combinatorial optimization problems. Among such problems, Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) is particularly relevant in industrial applications. To solve SAT problems using IMs, it is crucial to incorporate higher-order interactions. However, in analog IMs, interactions of different orders scale unevenly with the continuous spin amplitudes, introducing imbalances that can significantly degrade performance. We present a numerical comparison of methods to mitigate these imbalances, evaluating time-to-solution and success rate on Uniform Random 3-SAT instances from the SATLIB benchmark set. Our results show that the most effective approach employs spin interactions that are proportional to the signs of spins, rather than their continuous amplitudes. This generalizes our previous work, which showed that such interactions best mitigate imbalances induced by external fields in quadratic analog IMs. In this work, its advantage becomes substantially more pronounced, as it naturally mitigates imbalances across all interaction orders. We further demonstrate that smooth approximations of this method make it compatible with analog hardware. Our findings underscore the central role of spin-sign-based interactions in enabling robust and scalable analog IM dynamics.

Title: Implementing Pseudofractal Designs in Graphene-Based Quantum Hall Arrays using Minkowski-Bouligand Algorithms
Authors: Dominick S. Scaletta, Ngoc Thanh Mai Tran, Marta Musso, Dean G. Jarrett, Heather M. Hill, Massimo Ortolano, David B. Newell, Albert F. Rigosi
Abstract: This work introduces a pseudofractal analysis for optimizing high-resistance graphene-based quantized Hall array resistance standards (QHARS). The development of resistance standard device designs through star-mesh transformations is detailed, aimed at minimizing element count. Building on a recent mathematical framework, the approach presented herein refines QHARS device concepts by considering designs incorporating pseudofractals (which may be expressed as star-mesh transformations). To understand how future QHARS pseudofractal designs enable varying sizes of neighborhoods of available quantized resistance, Minkowski-Bouligand algorithms are used to analyze fractal dimensions of the device design topologies. Three distinct partial recursion cases are explored in addition to the original full recursion design, and expressions for their total element counts are derived. These partial recursions, assessed through their fractal dimensions, offer enhanced flexibility in achieving specific resistance values within a desired neighborhood compared to full recursion methods, albeit with an increased number of required elements. The formalisms presented are material-independent, making them broadly applicable to other quantum Hall systems and artifact standards.

Abstract: The electronic quality of graphene has improved significantly over the past two decades, revealing novel phenomena. However, even state-of-the-art devices exhibit substantial spatial charge fluctuations originating from charged defects inside the encapsulating crystals, limiting their performance. Here, we overcome this issue by assembling devices in which graphene is encapsulated by other graphene layers while remaining electronically decoupled from them via a large twist angle (~10-30°). Doping of the encapsulating graphene layer introduces strong Coulomb screening, maximized by the sub-nanometer distance between the layers, and reduces the inhomogeneity in the adjacent layer to just a few carriers per square micrometre. The enhanced quality manifests in Landau quantization emerging at magnetic fields as low as ~5 milli-Tesla and enables resolution of a small energy gap at the Dirac point. Our encapsulation approach can be extended to other two-dimensional systems, enabling further exploration of the electronic properties of ultrapure devices.

Title: Influences of the Minkowski-Bouligand Dimension on Graphene-Based Quantum Hall Array Designs
Authors: Dominick S. Scaletta, Ngoc Thanh Mai Tran, Marta Musso, Valery Ortiz Jimenez, Heather M. Hill, Dean G. Jarrett, Massimo Ortolano, Curt A. Richter, David B. Newell, Albert F. Rigosi
Abstract: This work elaborates on how one may develop high-resistance quantized Hall array resistance standards (QHARS) by using star-mesh transformations for element count minimization. Refinements are made on a recently developed mathematical framework optimizing QHARS device designs based on full, symmetric recursion by reconciling approximate device values with exact effective quantized resistances found by simulation and measurement. Furthermore, this work explores the concept of fractal dimension, clarifying the benefits of both full and partial recursions in QHARS devices. Three distinct partial recursion cases are visited for a near-1 Gigaohm QHARS device. These partial recursions, analyzed in the context of their fractal dimensions, offer increased flexibility in accessing desired resistance values within a specific neighborhood compared to full recursion methods, though at the cost of the number of required devices.

Title: Temperature-dependent Photoluminescence and Raman Spectroscopy of Selenium Thin Film Solar Cells
Authors: Rasmus S. Nielsen, Axel G. Medaille, Arnau Torrens, Oriol Segura-Blanch, Seán R. Kavanagh, David O. Scanlon, Aron Walsh, Edgardo Saucedo, Marcel Placidi, Mirjana Dimitrievska
Abstract: Selenium is experiencing renewed interest as a elemental semiconductor for a range of optoelectronic and energy applications due to its irresistibly simple composition and favorable wide bandgap. However, its high volatility and low radiative efficiency make it challenging to assess structural and optoelectronic quality, calling for advanced, non-destructive characterization methods. In this work, we employ a closed-space encapsulation strategy to prevent degradation during measurement and enable sensitive probing of vibrational and optoelectronic properties. Using temperature-dependent Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopy, we investigate grown-in stress, vibrational dynamics, and electron-phonon interactions in selenium thin films synthesized under nominally identical conditions across different laboratories. Our results reveal that short-range structural disorder is not intrinsic to the material, but highly sensitive to subtle processing variations, which strongly influence electron-phonon coupling and non-radiative recombination. We find that such structural disorder and grown-in stress likely promote the formation of extended defects, which act as dominant non-radiative recombination centers limiting carrier lifetime and open-circuit voltage in photovoltaic devices. These findings demonstrate that the optoelectronic quality of selenium thin films can be significantly improved through precise control of synthesis and post-deposition treatments, outlining a clear pathway toward optimizing selenium-based thin film technologies through targeted control of crystallization dynamics and microstructural disorder.

Title: Electron Doping Stabilization of Highly-Polar Supertetragonal BaSnO3
Authors: Qing Zhang, Karin M. Rabe, Xiaohui Liu
Abstract: Could electrons stabilize ferroelectric polarization in unpolarized system? Basically, electron doping was thought to be contrary to polarization due to the well-known picture that the screening effect on Coulomb interaction diminishes ferroelectric polarization. However, in this paper, we propose a novel mechanism of stabilizing highly-polar supertetragonal BaSnO3 by electron doping. With moderate compressive strain applied, less than -5.5%, BaSnO3 exhibits stable nonpolarized normal tetragonal structure and an unstable supertetragonal state which is characterized with extremely large c/a ratio and giant polarization. We found that the band gap of the supertetragonal state is much smaller than the normal tetragonal state, with a difference around 1.2eV. Therefore, the energy of the doped electrons selectively favors the smaller gap supertetragonal state than the larger band gap normal tetragonal state, and the critical strain to stabilize the supertetragonal phase could be reduced by electron doping. This mechanism guarantees the controllable supertetragonal structures by electron doping and ensures the coexistence of giant polarization and conducting in high-mobility BaSnO3, and is promising to design high-mobility ferroelectrics conductor.

Title: Current-induced spin-orbit torque on the surface of a transition metal dichalcogenide connected to a two-dimensional ferromagnet CrI$_3$: Effects of twisting and gating
Authors: Leyla Majidi, Azadeh Faridi, Reza Asgari
Abstract: Motivated by recent progress in employing two key classes of two-dimensional materials-topological insulators and transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs)-as spin sources for generating spin-orbit torque (SOT), we investigate current-induced spin polarization and the resulting SOT in bilayers composed of a TMDC (WSe$_2$ or MoSe$_2$) and ferromagnetic chromium iodide (CrI$_3$), beyond the linear response regime. Using the steady-state Boltzmann equation, we find that intra-band transitions yield a strong field-like torque on the CrI$_3$ layer, while inter-band transitions give rise to a comparatively weaker damping-like torque in the WSe$_2$/CrI$_3$ system. Remarkably, the damping-like component is enhanced by up to three orders of magnitude in n-doped MoSe$_2$, reaching a strength comparable to the field-like torque, which itself is an order of magnitude larger than that in the WSe$_2$-based bilayer. Both torque components exhibit strong asymmetry between n-type and p-type doping in WSe$_2$ and MoSe$_2$ systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the twist angle plays a crucial role: depending on the TMDC and chemical potential, twisting can reverse the sign of the SOT and significantly modulate its magnitude. Finally, we show that a transverse gate electric field enables substantial tunability of the SOT, by nearly one order of magnitude, and induces a sign reversal at a twist angle of $10.16^{\circ}$.

Title: Interface crossing behavior of prolate microswimmers: thermo and hydrodynamics
Authors: Rishish Mishra, Harish Pothukuchi, Harinadha Gidituri, Juho Lintuvuori
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments of motile bacteria crossing liquid-liquid interfaces of isotropic- nematic coexistence (Cheon et al., Soft Matter 20: 7313-7320, 2024), we study the dynamics of prolate microswimmers traversing clean liquid-liquid interfaces. Using large-scale lattice Boltzmann simulations, we observe that neutrally wetting swimmers can be either trapped or cross the in- terface, depending on their initial angle, swimming speed and the interfacial tension between the two fluids. The simulation results are rationalized by considering a competition between interfacial (thermodynamic) and active (hydrodynamic) forces. The swimmers get trapped at the interface due to a thermodynamic trapping force, akin to Pickering effect, when the forces from interfacial tension dominate over the swimming forces. The trapping behavior can be captured by calculating a critical capillary number by balancing the interfacial and active energies. This prediction agrees remarkably well with the numerical simulations as well as the bacterial experiments of Cheon et al., (Soft Matter 20: 7313-7320, 2024). Finally, our results demonstrate that the torque resulting in a reorientation of the swimmers parallel to the interface have both hydro and thermodynamic components.

Title: Structural Distortions Control Scaling of Exciton Binding Energies in Two-Dimensional Ag/Bi Double Perovskites
Authors: Pierre Lechifflart, Raisa-Ioana Biega, Linn Leppert
Abstract: Three-dimensional metal halide double perovskites such as Cs$_2$AgBiBr$_6$ exhibit pronounced excitonic effects due to their anisotropic electronic structure and chemical localization effects. Their two-dimensional derivatives, formed by inserting organic spacer molecules between perovskite layers, were expected to follow well-established trends seen in Pb-based 2D perovskites, namely, increasing exciton binding energies with decreasing layer thickness due to enhanced quantum and dielectric confinement. However, recent experimental and computational studies have revealed anomalous behavior in Ag/Bi-based 2D perovskites, where this trend is reversed. Using ab initio many-body perturbation theory within the $GW$ and Bethe-Salpeter Equation frameworks, we resolve this puzzle by systematically comparing experimental structures with idealized models designed to isolate the effects of octahedral distortions, interlayer separation, and stacking. We find that structural distortions, driven by directional Ag d orbital bonding, govern the momentum-space origin and character of the exciton, and are the primary cause of the observed non-monotonic trends. Furthermore, we explore how interlayer distance and stacking influence band gaps and exciton binding energies, showing that, despite different chemistry, the underlying confinement physics mirrors that of Pb-based 2D perovskites. Our results establish design principles for tuning excitonic properties in this broader class of layered, lead-free materials.

Title: Boosting Photodetection via Plasmonic Coupling in Quasi-2D Mixed-n Ruddlesden-Popper Perovskite Nanostripes
Authors: Brindhu Malani S, Eugen Klein, Ronja Maria Piehler, Rostyslav Lesyuk, Christian Klinke
Abstract: Quasi-2D metal halide perovskites have emerged as a promising material for photodetection due to excellent optoelectronic properties, simple synthesis, and robust stability. Albeit, developing high-performance photodetectors based on low-dimensional quasi-2D metal halide perovskite nanoparticles remains challenging due to quantum and dielectric confinement effects. Several approaches have been employed to improve efficiency, with plasmonic nanostructures being among the most effective ones. The resonant energy transfer and coupling between plasmons and excitons play a vital role in enhancing device performance. Here, we demonstrate enhanced photodetection of quasi-2D perovskite nanostripes resulting from the incorporation of octadecanethiol (ODT) functionalized Ag nanostructure arrays (ANA). Using colloidal lithography, ANA were fabricated. Reflectance spectroscopy and finite element method (FEM) simulations show that ANA supports localised surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) modes that spectrally coincide with the absorption and emission band of the perovskite. This spectral overlap enables interesting coupling interactions between the excitons and plasmons. The ODT-functionalized ANA photodetectors exhibit weak to intermediate coupling, resulting in a photocurrent enhancement factor of 838 %. They achieve photoresponsivities of up to 70.41 mA W^-1, detectivities of 1.48*10^11 Jones and external quantum efficiencies of 21.55 %, which are approximately 10 times higher than those of the reference photodetector. We present an approach to optimize the plasmon-exciton coupling and non-radiative energy transfer for developing high-performance plasmonic-perovskite hybrid photodetectors.

Title: Structural and thermodynamic stability of hexagonal-diamond $\text{Si}_{1 - x - y}\,\text{Ge}_{x}\,\text{B}_{y}$ alloys
Authors: Marc Túnica, Francesca Chiodi, Michele Amato
Abstract: Pushing dopant concentrations beyond the solubility limit in semiconductors -- a process known as hyperdoping -- has been demonstrated as an effective strategy for inducing superconductivity in cubic-diamond Si and SiGe materials. Additionally, previous studies have reported that several polytypes of Si may exhibit a type-I superconducting state under high pressure. In this work, we employ ground-state Density Functional Theory simulations to investigate the effects of both low and high B doping concentrations on the structural and thermodynamic properties of hexagonal-diamond SiGe alloys, with a systematic comparison to their cubic-diamond counterparts. Our results highlight three key findings: (i) structural analysis confirms that the lattice parameters of SiGeB alloys adhere to a ternary Vegard's law, consistent with observations in cubic-diamond SiGe alloys. However, at high doping concentrations, B incorporation can locally disrupt the hexagonal symmetry, particularly in the presence of B clustering; (ii) dopant formation energy calculations reveal that B is thermodynamically more stable in the hexagonal phase than in the cubic phase across all Ge concentrations, regardless of the doping level; (iii) mixing enthalpy calculations demonstrate that hyperdoped hexagonal-diamond SiGe alloys are thermodynamically stable across the full range of Ge compositions and that their tendency for hyperdoping is more favorable than that of cubic-diamond SiGe alloys. Taken together, these findings indicate that hyperdoping is experimentally viable in hexagonal-diamond SiGe alloys and, in light of previous evidence, position these materials as a promising platform for the exploration of superconductivity in group IV semiconductors.

Title: Floquet Non-Bloch Formalism for a Non-Hermitian Ladder: From Theoretical Framework to Topolectrical Circuits
Authors: Koustav Roy, Dipendu Halder, Koustabh Gogoi, B. Tanatar, Saurabh Basu
Abstract: Periodically driven systems intertwined with non-Hermiticity opens a rich arena for topological phases that transcend conventional Hermitian limits. The physical significance of these phases hinges on obtaining the topological invariants that restore the bulk-boundary correspondence, a task well explored for static non-Hermitian (NH) systems, while it remains elusive for the driven scenario. Here, we address this problem by constructing a generalized Floquet non-Bloch framework that analytically captures the spectral and topological properties of time-periodic NH systems. Em- ploying a high-frequency Magnus expansion, we analytically derive an effective Floquet Hamiltonian and formulate the generalized Brillouin zone for a periodically driven quasi-one-dimensional system, namely, the Creutz ladder with a staggered complex potential. Our study demonstrates that the skin effect remains robust (despite the absence of non-reciprocal hopping) across a broad range of driving parameters, and is notably amplified in the low-frequency regime due to emergent longer- range couplings. We further employ a symmetric time frame approach that generates chiral-partner Hamiltonians, whose invariants, when appropriately combined, account for the full edge-state struc- ture. To substantiate the theoretical framework, we propose a topolectrical circuit (TEC) that serves as a viable experimental setting. Apart from capturing the skin modes, the proposed TEC design faithfully reproduces the presence of distinct Floquet edge states, as revealed through the voltage and impedance profiles, respectively. Thus, our work not only offers a theoretical framework for exploring NH-driven systems, but also provides an experimentally feasible TEC architecture for realizing these phenomena stated above in a laboratory.

Title: Particle localization on helical nanoribbons: Quantum analog of the Coriolis effect
Authors: Radha Balakrishnan, Rossen Dandoloff, Victor Atanasov, Avadh Saxena
Abstract: We derive the Schrödinger equation for a particle confined to the surface of a normal and a binormal helical nanoribbon, obtain the quantum potentials induced by their respective curved surface geometries, and study the localized states of the particle for each ribbon. When the particle momentum satisfies a certain geometric condition, the particle localizes near the inner edge for a normal ribbon, and on the central helix for a binormal ribbon. This result suggests the presence of a pseudo-force that pushes the particle transversely along the width of the ribbon. We show that this phenomenon can be interpreted as a quantum analog of the Coriolis effect, which causes a transverse deflection of a classical particle moving in a rotating frame. We invoke Ehrenfest's theorem applicable to localized states and identify the quantized angular velocities of the rotating frames for the two ribbons. If the particle is an electron, its localization at a specific width gives rise to a Hall-like voltage difference across the ribbon's width. However, unlike in the Hall effect, its origin is not an applied magnetic field, but the ribbon's curved surface geometry. When a normal helical ribbon is mechanically flipped to a binormal configuration in a periodic fashion, it results in a periodic electron transport from the inner edge to the center, giving rise to a quantum AC voltage. This can be used for designing nanoscale electromechanical devices. Quantum transport on a helical nanoribbon can be controlled by tuning the bends and twists of its surface, suggesting diverse applications in biopolymers and nanotechnology.

Title: Applying the Worldvolume Hybrid Monte Carlo method to the Hubbard model away from half filling
Authors: Masafumi Fukuma, Yusuke Namekawa
Abstract: The Worldvolume Hybrid Monte Carlo (WV-HMC) method [arXiv:2012.08468] is an efficient and low-cost algorithm for addressing the sign problem. It mitigates the sign problem while avoiding the ergodicity issues that are intrinsic to algorithms based on Lefschetz thimbles. In this study, we apply the WV-HMC method to the Hubbard model away from half filling, which is known to suffer from a severe sign problem. We compute the number density on lattices of spatial size $6 \times 6$ and $8 \times 8$ at inverse temperature $\beta = 6.4$ using $N_t = 20$ Trotter steps. Our results show that the WV-HMC method remains effective even in parameter regions where non-thimble Monte Carlo methods fail due to severe sign problems. In this work, we employ direct solvers for fermion matrix inversion, with a computational cost of $O(N^3)$, where $N$ is the number of degrees of freedom and proportional to the spacetime lattice volume. An alternative algorithm employing pseudofermions and iterative solvers, which reduces the cost to $O(N^2)$ at the expense of careful parameter tuning, will be discussed in a separate publication.

Title: Discovery of spontaneous mesoscopic strain waves in nematic domains using dark-field X-ray microscopy
Authors: Kaan Alp Yay, W. Joe Meese, Elliot Kisiel, Matthew J. Krogstad, Anisha G. Singh, Rafael M. Fernandes, Zahir Islam, Ian R. Fisher
Abstract: Electronic nematic order is a correlated phase of matter in which low-energy electronic states spontaneously break a discrete rotational symmetry of a crystal lattice. Bilinear coupling between the electronic nematic and strains of the same symmetry yields a single pseudoproper ferroelastic phase transition at which both the nematic and lattice strain onset concurrently. To minimize elastic energy, the crystal forms structural twin domains, each with a distinct orientation of the nematic director (i.e. each with a specific sign of the induced shear strain). While the effects of externally induced strains on these domains are well established, the intrinsic behavior of spontaneous strain fields within individual domains has been hitherto unexplored, largely due to the lack of appropriate experimental tools. Here, we report the discovery of spontaneous mesoscopic strain waves within individual nematic domains of an underdoped iron-based superconductor, observed using dark-field X-ray microscopy (DFXM). This technique combines high spatial and reciprocal-space resolution with full-field, bulk-sensitive imaging, enabling direct visualization of subdomain strain modulations emerging concurrently with the onset of nematic order. The elastic compatibility relations that govern inhomogeneous strains in continuous solids provide a natural mechanism for the emergent strain waves that we observe. Our findings reveal a broadly relevant form of strain self-organization and position DFXM as a powerful tool for probing the local interplay between lattice strain and electronic order.

Title: Compatible Instability: Gauge Constraints of Elasticity Inherited by Electronic Nematic Criticality
Authors: W. Joe Meese, Rafael M. Fernandes
Abstract: Electronic nematicity is widely observed in quantum materials with varying degrees of electronic correlation, manifesting through charge, spin, orbital, or superconducting degrees of freedom. A phenomenological model capable of describing this broad set of systems must also account for nemato-elasticity, by which nematic and elastic degrees of freedom become intertwined. However, being a tensor gauge field theory, elasticity must satisfy the compatibility relations which guarantee the integrability of lattice deformations. Here, we develop a formalism for nemato-elasticity that manifestly respects the elastic compatibility relations. We show that these constraints bifurcate the phase space of nematic fluctuations into two orthogonal sectors: one compatible and thus critical, the other incompatible and therefore gapped. The suppression of the latter leads to universal direction-selective nematic criticality in any crystal lattice. Moreover, the critical nematic modes are protected from pinning effects induced by microscopic defect strains, which necessarily induce both longitudinal and transverse correlated random fields. Finally, our results also reconcile seemingly contradictory nematic phenomena, such as the mean-field character of the nematic transition and the widespread presence of domain formation.

Title: Theory of Electronic Nematic Criticality Constrained by Elastic Compatibility
Authors: W. Joe Meese, Rafael M. Fernandes
Abstract: The defining property of electronic nematicity -- the spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry -- implies an unavoidable coupling between the nematic order parameter and elastic strain fields, known as nemato-elasticity. While both quantities are rank-2 tensors, the strain tensor is constrained through the Saint Venant compatibility relations. These three coupled second-order partial differential equations arise from the lattice displacement vector's role as a potential field, and they reflect the underlying gauge invariance of geometric deformations which are violated only in the presence of crystalline defects. In this work, we develop a theory of nemato-elasticity that incorporates elastic compatibility explicitly through a co-rotating helical basis. With our formalism, we show elasticity bestows tensor compatibility upon the nematic order parameter by suppressing incompatible nematic fluctuations. As a result, nemato-elasticity is markedly different from bare nematicity. In ideal media devoid of defects, we show the suppression of incompatible nematicity underlies direction-selective criticality, even in the absence of crystalline anisotropy. In systems with defects, meanwhile, we show that elastic pinning fields emanate from quenched defects, generating random longitudinal and transverse conjugate fields for the local nematic order parameter. The coexistence of direction-selective nematic criticality with pinning effects from random fields is explained within our theory from the transformation to the helical basis, implying that local experimental probes of nematicity will be influenced by a linear -- but nonlocal -- combination of long-ranged and short-ranged helical nematic modes. Because the compatibility relations are gauge constraints endowed in the isotropic medium, our results constitute universal features of nemato-elastic criticality present in all crystalline systems.

Title: Unveiling In-Gap States and Majorana Zero Modes in Superconductor-Topological Insulator Bilayer model
Authors: Umesh Kumar, Rafal Rechcinski, Tatiana de Picoli, Jukka Vayrynen, Satoshi Okamoto
Abstract: Interfaces between topological insulators and superconductors are promising platforms for realizing Majorana zero modes (MZMs) via the superconducting proximity effect. We introduce a bilayer model consisting of the surface states of a three-dimensional topological insulator (3DTI) coupled to an $s$-wave superconductor and systematically study the role of interlayer tunneling strength ($t_\perp$). We find that increasing $t_\perp$ shifts the proximity-induced (PrI) gap minima away from the $\Gamma$-point, giving rise to momentum-selective interference patterns that manifest as spatial oscillations in the in-gap states. By introducing an antidot with a magnetic vortex in the SC layer, we investigate the nature of in-gap states including MZMs and Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon (CdGM) modes. With increasing hybridization strength, the energy separation between MZMs and CdGM states increases, enhancing the isolation of MZMs. Importantly, in the strong hybridization limit, the leading CdGM separation remains large inspite of the decrease in the PrI gap. Spin- and spatial-resolved wavefunction analysis reveals angular momentum asymmetries absent in conventional $s$-wave systems. A direct comparison with a standalone $s$-wave superconductor confirms the emergence of distinct $p$-wave-like features in the bilayer geometry. Our results provide experimentally relevant predictions for tuning the stability of MZMs and their differentiation from the CdGM modes in SC-3DTI heterostructures and offer a theoretical framework for probing unconventional superconductivity in engineered topological systems.

Title: Two-dimensional Disordered Projected Branes: Stability and Quantum Criticality via Dimensional Reduction
Authors: Alexander C. Tyner, Vladimir Juricic, Bitan Roy
Abstract: The interplay of disorder and dimensionality governs the emergence and stability of electronic phases in quantum materials and quantum phase transitions among them. While three-dimensional (3D) dirty Fermi liquids and Weyl semimetals support robust metallic states, undergoing disorder-driven Anderson localization transitions at strong disorder and the later ones exhibiting additional semimetal-to-metal transition at moderate disorder, conventional two-dimensional (2D) non-interacting systems localize for arbitrarily weak disorder. Here, we show that 2D disordered projected branes, constructed by systematically integrating out degrees of freedom from a 3D cubic lattice via the Schur decomposition, faithfully reproduce the full quantum phase diagram of their 3D parent systems. Using large-scale exact diagonalization and kernel polynomial method, we numerically demonstrate that 2D projected branes host stable metallic and semimetallic phases. Remarkably, the critical exponents governing the semimetal-to-metal and metal-insulator transitions on such 2D projected branes are sufficiently close to those of their 3D counterparts. Our findings thus establish 2D projected branes as genuine quantum holographic images of their higher-dimensional disordered parent crystals, supporting stable semimetallic and metallic phases that are otherwise inaccessible in conventional 2D lattices. Finally, we point to experimentally accessible metamaterial platforms, most notably the photonic lattices with tunable refractive-index disorder, as promising systems to realize and probe these phenomena.

Title: Projected branes as platforms for crystalline, superconducting, and higher-order topological phases
Authors: Archisman Panigrahi, Bitan Roy
Abstract: Projected branes are constituted by only a small subset of sites of a higher-dimensional crystal, otherwise placed on a hyperplane oriented at an irrational or a rational slope therein, for which the effective Hamiltonian is constructed by systematically integrating out the sites of the parent lattice that fall outside such branes [Commun. Phys. 5, 230 (2022)]. Specifically, when such a brane is constructed from a square lattice, it gives rise to an aperiodic Fibonacci quasi-crystal or its rational approximant in one dimension. In this work, starting from square lattice-based models for topological crystalline insulators, protected by the discrete four-fold rotational ($C_4$) symmetry, we show that the resulting one-dimensional projected topological branes encode all the salient signatures of such phases in terms of robust endpoint zero-energy modes, quantized local topological markers, and mid-gap modes bound to dislocation lattice defects, despite such linear branes being devoid of the $C_4$ symmetry of the original lattice. Furthermore, we show that such branes can also feature all the hallmarks of two-dimensional strong and weak topological superconductors through Majorana zero-energy bound states residing near their endpoints and at the core of dislocation lattice defects, besides possessing suitable quantized local topological markers. Finally, we showcase a successful incarnation of a square lattice-based second-order topological insulator with the characteristic corner-localized zero modes in its geometric descendant one-dimensional quasi-crystalline or crystalline branes that feature a quantized localizer index and endpoint zero-energy modes only when one of its end points passes through a corner of the parent crystal. Possible designer quantum and meta material-based platforms to experimentally harness our theoretically proposed topological branes are discussed.

Title: Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization for Fast and Reliable Parameter Extraction in Thermoreflectance
Authors: Bingjia Xiao, Tao Chen, Wenbin Zhang, Xin Qian, Puqing Jiang
Abstract: Frequency-domain thermoreflectance (FDTR) is a widely used technique for characterizing thermal properties of multilayer thin films. However, extracting multiple parameters from FDTR measurements presents a nonlinear inverse problem due to its high dimensionality and multimodal, non-convex solution space. This study evaluates four popular global optimization algorithms: Genetic Algorithm (GA), Quantum Genetic Algorithm (QGA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Fireworks Algorithm (FWA), for extracting parameters from FDTR measurements of a GaN/Si heterostructure. However, none achieve reliable convergence within 60 seconds. To improve convergence speed and accuracy, we propose an AI-driven hybrid optimization framework that combines each global algorithm with a Quasi-Newton local refinement method, resulting in four hybrid variants: HGA, HQGA, HPSO, and HFWA. Among these, HPSO outperforms all other methods, with 80% of trials reaching the target fitness value within 60 seconds, showing greater robustness and a lower risk of premature convergence. In contrast, only 30% of HGA and HQGA trials and 20% of HFWA trials achieve this threshold. We then evaluate the worst-case performance across 100 independent trials for each algorithm when the time is extended to 1000 seconds. Only HPSO, PSO, and HGA consistently reach the target accuracy, with HPSO converging five times faster than the others. HPSO provides a general-purpose solution for inverse problems in thermal metrology and can be readily extended to other model-fitting techniques.

Title: Dynamical freezing and enhanced magnetometry in an interacting spin ensemble
Authors: Ya-Nan Lu, Dong Yuan, Yixuan Ma, Yan-Qing Liu, Si Jiang, Xiang-Qian Meng, Yi-Jie Xu, Xiu-Ying Chang, Chong Zu, Hong-Zheng Zhao, Dong-Ling Deng, Lu-Ming Duan, Pan-Yu Hou
Abstract: Understanding and controlling non-equilibrium dynamics in quantum many-body systems is a fundamental challenge in modern physics, with profound implications for advancing quantum technologies. Typically, periodically driven systems in the absence of conservation laws thermalize to a featureless "infinite-temperature" state, erasing all memory of their initial conditions. However, this paradigm can break down through mechanisms such as integrability, many-body localization, quantum many-body scars, and Hilbert space fragmentation. Here, we report the experimental observation of dynamical freezing, a distinct mechanism of thermalization breakdown in driven systems, and demonstrate its application in quantum sensing using an ensemble of approximately $10^4$ interacting nitrogen-vacancy spins in diamond. By precisely controlling the driving frequency and detuning, we observe emergent long-lived spin magnetization and coherent oscillatory micromotions, persisting over timescales exceeding the interaction-limited coherence time ($T_2$) by more than an order of magnitude. Leveraging these unconventional dynamics, we develop a dynamical-freezing-enhanced ac magnetometry that extends optimal sensing times far beyond $T_2$, outperforming conventional dynamical decoupling magnetometry with a 4.3 dB sensitivity enhancement. Our results not only provide clear experimental observation of dynamical freezing -- a peculiar mechanism defying thermalization through emergent conservation laws -- but also establish a robust control method generally applicable to diverse physical platforms, with broad implications in quantum metrology and beyond.

Title: Field digitization scaling in a $\mathbb{Z}_N \subset U(1)$ symmetric model
Authors: Gabriele Calliari, Robert Ott, Hannes Pichler, Torsten V. Zache
Abstract: The simulation of quantum field theories, both classical and quantum, requires regularization of infinitely many degrees of freedom. However, in the context of field digitization (FD) -- a truncation of the local fields to $N$ discrete values -- a comprehensive framework to obtain continuum results is currently missing. Here, we propose to analyze FD by interpreting the parameter $N$ as a coupling in the renormalization group (RG) sense. As a first example, we investigate the two-dimensional classical $N$-state clock model as a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ FD of the $U(1)$-symmetric $XY$-model. Using effective field theory, we employ the RG to derive generalized scaling hypotheses involving the FD parameter $N$, which allows us to relate data obtained for different $N$-regularized models in a procedure that we term $\textit{field digitization scaling}$ (FDS). Using numerical tensor-network calculations at finite bond dimension $\chi$, we further uncover an unconventional universal crossover around a low-temperature phase transition induced by finite $N$, demonstrating that FDS can be extended to describe the interplay of $\chi$ and $N$. Finally, we analytically prove that our calculations for the 2D classical-statistical $\mathbb{Z}_N$ clock model are directly related to the quantum physics in the ground state of a (2+1)D $\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theory which serves as a FD of compact quantum electrodynamics. Our study thus paves the way for applications of FDS to quantum simulations of more complex models in higher spatial dimensions, where it could serve as a tool to analyze the continuum limit of digitized quantum field theories.

Title: Probing Bound State Relaxation Dynamics in Systems Out-of-Equilibrium on Quantum Computers
Authors: Heba A. Labib, Goksu Can Toga, J. K. Freericks, A. F. Kemper
Abstract: Pump-probe spectroscopy is a powerful tool for probing response dynamics of quantum many-body systems in and out-of-equilibrium. Quantum computers have proved useful in simulating such experiments by exciting the system, evolving, and then measuring observables to first order, all in one setting. Here, we use this approach to investigate the mixed-field Ising model, where the longitudinal field plays the role of a confining potential that prohibits the spread of the excitations, spinons, or domain walls into space. We study the discrete bound states that arise from such a setting and their evolution under different quench dynamics by initially pumping the chain out of equilibrium and then probing various non-equal time correlation functions. Finally, we study false vacuum decay, where initially one expects unhindered propagation of the ground state, or true vacuum, bubbles into the lattice, but instead sees the emergence of Bloch oscillations that are directly the reason for the long-lived oscillations in this finite-size model. Our work sets the stage for simulating systems out-of-equilibrium on classical and quantum computers using pump-probe experiments without needing ancillary qubits.

Title: From confinement to chaos in AdS/CFT correspondence via non-equilibrium local states
Authors: Dmitry S. Ageev, Vladimir A. Bykov
Abstract: In this paper, we study excited states in Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space prepared by local operator insertions of a massive scalar field, corresponding to operator quenches for free fields in AdS. Using the AdS/CFT correspondence, we compute the time evolution of boundary observables in the dual states. We then introduce a hard wall in AdS Poincare coordinates to impose an infrared cutoff, creating a confining deformation of the dual conformal field theory, and analyze the dynamics of excited states in this confining background. By comparing the evolution of boundary two-point correlation functions in the deformed theory to the statistics of Gaussian random matrix ensembles, we show that for sufficiently heavy operators the fluctuations approach quite close those of the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE). Finally, we extend our analysis to the compact BTZ black hole and its hard wall deformation, finding qualitatively similar behavior.

Title: A Foundation Model for Material Fracture Prediction

Abstract: Accurately predicting when and how materials fail is critical to designing safe, reliable structures, mechanical systems, and engineered components that operate under stress. Yet, fracture behavior remains difficult to model across the diversity of materials, geometries, and loading conditions in real-world applications. While machine learning (ML) methods show promise, most models are trained on narrow datasets, lack robustness, and struggle to generalize. Meanwhile, physics-based simulators offer high-fidelity predictions but are fragmented across specialized methods and require substantial high-performance computing resources to explore the input space. To address these limitations, we present a data-driven foundation model for fracture prediction, a transformer-based architecture that operates across simulators, a wide range of materials (including plastic-bonded explosives, steel, aluminum, shale, and tungsten), and diverse loading conditions. The model supports both structured and unstructured meshes, combining them with large language model embeddings of textual input decks specifying material properties, boundary conditions, and solver settings. This multimodal input design enables flexible adaptation across simulation scenarios without changes to the model architecture. The trained model can be fine-tuned with minimal data on diverse downstream tasks, including time-to-failure estimation, modeling fracture evolution, and adapting to combined finite-discrete element method simulations. It also generalizes to unseen materials such as titanium and concrete, requiring as few as a single sample, dramatically reducing data needs compared to standard ML. Our results show that fracture prediction can be unified under a single model architecture, offering a scalable, extensible alternative to simulator-specific workflows.

Title: Proximity-measurement induced random localization in quantum fluids
Authors: Pushkar Mohile (1), Paul M. Goldbart (1) ((1) Stony Brook University, U.S.A.)
Abstract: Proximity measurements probe whether pairs of particles are close to one another. We consider the impact of post-selected random proximity measurements on a quantum fluid of many distinguishable particles. We show that such measurements induce random spatial localization of a fraction of the particles, and yet preserve homogeneity macroscopically. Eventually, all particles localize, with a distribution of localization lengths that saturates at a scale controlled by the typical measurement rate. The steady-state distribution of these lengths is governed by a familiar scaling form.

Title: Hyperbolic Plasmon dispersion and Optical Conductivity of Holey Graphene: signatures of flat-bands
Authors: Abdiel de Jesús Espinosa-Champo, Gerardo G. Naumis
Abstract: Holey graphene (HG) is a novel two-dimensional (2D) material that has attracted considerable attention due to its remarkable electrical, thermal, and mechanical properties. The recent discovery of flat bands in HG has garnered significant interest. In this work, we systematically investigate the tunable plasmonic modes and optical conductivity of HG at or near the flat band condition by changing the holes radii and periodic configuration. It is found that HG presents nearly flat plasmonic bands in configurations with larger hole radii. Hyperbolic plasmons are found due to the breaking of the graphene's bipartite sublattice symmetry induced by the holes. Such an effect is also confirmed by looking at the optical conductivity, that also presents a marked anisotropy. The material's marked optical anisotropy leads to hyperbolic plasmons, making it a promising platform for nanophotonic applications.

Title: Characterisation of commercial SiC MOSFETs at deep-cryogenic temperatures
Authors: Megan Powell, Euan Parry, Conor McGeough, Alexander Zotov, Alessandro Rossi
Abstract: Silicon carbide is a wide-bandgap semiconductor with an emerging CMOS technology platform and it is widely deployed in high power and harsh environment electronics. This material is also attracting interest for quantum technologies through its crystal defects, which can act as spin-based qubits or single-photon sources. In this work, we assess the cryogenic performance of commercial power MOSFETs to evaluate their suitability for CMOS-compatible quantum electronics. We perform a statistical study of threshold voltage and subthreshold swing from 300 K down to 650 mK, focusing on reproducibility and variability. Our results show significant performance degradation at low temperatures, including large gate hysteresis, threshold voltage shifts, and subthreshold swing deterioration. These effects suggest instability in electrostatic control, likely due to carrier freeze-out and high interface trap density, which may pose challenges for the reliable use of this transistor technology towards the realisation of quantum devices or cryo-CMOS electronics.

Title: Extensional rheology of dilute suspensions of spheres in polymeric liquids
Authors: Arjun Sharma, Donald L. Koch
Abstract: The extensional rheology of dilute suspensions of spheres in viscoelastic or polymeric liquids is studied computationally. At low polymer concentration (c) and Deborah number (De), a wake of highly stretched polymers forms downstream of the particles due to larger local velocity gradients than the imposed flow, indicated by a positive deviation in local De. This increases the suspension's extensional viscosity with time and De for De less than 0.5. When De exceeds 0.5 (the coil-stretch transition), the fully stretched polymers from the far field collapse in regions with lower local velocity gradients around the particle's stagnation points, reducing suspension viscosity relative to the polymer-only liquid. The interaction between local flow and polymers intensifies with increasing c. Highly stretched polymers impede local flow, reducing local De, while it increases in regions with collapsed polymers. Initially, increasing c aligns local De and polymer stretch with far-field values, diminishing particle-polymer interaction effects. However, beyond a certain c, a new mechanism emerges. At low c, fluid three particle radii upstream exhibits increased local De, stretching polymers beyond their undisturbed state. As c increases, this deviation becomes negative, collapsing polymers and resulting in increasingly negative stress from particle-polymer interactions at large De and time. At high c, this negative interaction stress scales as c squared, surpassing the linear increase in polymer stress, making dilute sphere suspensions more effective at reducing the viscosity of viscoelastic liquids at larger De and c.

Title: Reformulating Chemical Equilibrium in Reacting Quantum Gas Mixtures: Particle Number Conservation, Correlations and Fluctuations
Authors: Diogo J. L. Rodrigues
Abstract: The canonical-ensemble description of reactive quantum gas mixtures is reformulated by incorporating a single global particle-number-conservation constraint over the combined spectra of inter-converting species. This constraint replaces the conventional equality of chemical potentials. Fermi-Dirac or Bose-Einstein correlations naturally emerge across one-particle energy eigenstates of species sharing identical spin-statistics, which in ergodic single-systems manifest as intrinsic features of the equilibrium state. By embedding all microstates linked by conversion pathways, the framework incorporates concentration fluctuations in the statistical description. The formalism offers fresh insights into quantum chemical equilibrium in reactive mixtures with composition fluctuations and smoothly reduces to the classical ideal gas limit via an extended partition function that generalizes classical chemical-equilibrium treatments.

Title: Non-equilibrium thermodynamics of the quantum Brownian motion: Anomalous non-equilibrium currents arising from complete positivity
Authors: Simone Artini, Gabriele Lo Monaco, Alberto Imparato, Mauro Paternostro, Sandro Donadi
Abstract: We rigorously analyze the non-equilibrium thermodynamic behavior of various formulations of quantum Brownian motion (QBM) using the framework of stochastic thermodynamics. While the widely used Caldeira-Leggett master equation exhibits desirable thermodynamic features, such as the fulfilment of a detailed balance, it fails to ensure complete positivity. In contrast, several completely positive and trace-preserving (CPTP) extensions turn out to be thermodynamically controversial. We show that such extensions introduce anomalous phase-space structures that violate detailed balance at the steady state, leading to non-vanishing entropy production and effective non-equilibrium current of unclear physical origins. Our results highlight a fundamental tension between quantum consistency and thermodynamic equilibration in open quantum systems.

Title: Time-Dependent Parameters in Quantum Systems: Revisiting Berry Phase, Curvature and Gauge Connections
Authors: Georgios Konstantinou
Abstract: We present a reformulation of quantum adiabatic theory in terms of an emergent electromagnetic framework, emphasizing the physical consequences of geometric structures in parameter space. Contrary to conventional approaches, we demonstrate that a Berry electric field naturally arises in systems with dynamic Hamiltonian, when the full time-dependent wavefunction is used to define the gauge potentials. This surprising result bridges the gap between static and dynamical formulations and leads to a deeper understanding of how gauge structures manifest in quantum systems. Building on this, we construct Berry Maxwell equations by analogy with classical electrodynamics, defining Berry electric and magnetic fields as derivatives of scalar and vector potentials obtained from the full quantum state. We verify these equations explicitly and derive field-theoretic identities such as generalized continuity and vorticity relations. This field-based formulation reveals the topological charges, monopole structures, and gauge currents that underlie parameter space, and clarifies how Berry curvature corrections enter dynamical quantities like expectation values and particle velocities. Our results establish a new regime of emergent electromagnetism in parameter space, unifying time-independent and time-dependent geometric phases within a covariant formalism. The implications extend to quantum transport, polarization, and topological classification of phases, providing a robust and generalizable framework for quantum systems driven by adiabatic or nonadiabatic evolution.

Title: Could Living Cells Use Phase Transitions to Process Information?
Authors: Arvind Murugan, David Zwicker, Charlotta Lorenz, Eric R. Dufresne
Abstract: To maintain homeostasis, living cells process information with networks of interacting molecules. Traditional models for cellular information processing have focused on networks of chemical reactions between molecules. Here, we describe how networks of physical interactions could contribute to the processing of information inside cells. In particular, we focus on the impact of biomolecular condensation, a structural phase transition found in cells. Biomolecular condensation has recently been implicated in diverse cellular processes. Some of these are essentially computational, including classification and control tasks. We place these findings in the broader context of physical computing, an emerging framework for describing how the native dynamics of nonlinear physical systems can be leveraged to perform complex computations. The synthesis of these ideas raises questions about expressivity (the range of problems that cellular phase transitions might be able to solve) and learning (how these systems could adapt and evolve to solve different problems). This emerging area of research presents diverse opportunities across molecular biophysics, soft matter, and physical computing.

Title: Fuss--Catalan algebras on generalized Dyck paths via non-crossing partitions
Authors: Keiichi Shigechi
Abstract: We study the Fuss--Catalan algebras, which are generalizations of the Temperley--Lieb algebra and act on generalized Dyck paths, through non-crossing partitions. First, the Temperley--Lieb algebra is defined on non-crossing partitions, and a bijection between a Dyck path and a non-crossing partition is shown to be compatible with the Temperley--Lieb algebra on Dyck paths, or equivalently chord diagrams. We show that the Kreweras endomorphism on non-crossing partitions is equivalent to the rotation of chord diagrams under the bijection. Secondly, by considering an increasing $r$-chain in the graded lattice of non-crossing partitions, we define the Fuss--Catalan algebras on increasing $r$-chains. Through a bijection between an increasing $r$-chain and a generalized Dyck path, one naturally obtains the Fuss--Catalan algebra on generalized Dyck paths. As generalizations of the Fuss--Catalan algebra, we introduce the one- and two-boundary Fuss--Catalan algebras. Increasing $r$-chains of symmetric non-crossing partitions give symmetric generalized Dyck paths by the bijection, and the boundary Fuss--Catalan algebras naturally act on them. We show that these representations are compatible with the diagrammatic representations of the algebras by use of generalized chord diagrams. Thirdly, we discuss the integrability of the Fuss--Catalan algebras. For the Fuss--Catalan algebras with boundaries, we obtain a new solution of the reflection equation in the case of $r=2$.

Title: Conical diffraction of the synchrotron beam to probe the efficiency and morphology of blazed gratings
Authors: K.V. Nikolaev, L.I. Goray, P.S. Savchenkov, A.V. Rogachev, A.A. Chouprik, T.N. Berezovskaya, D.V. Mokhov, S.A. Garakhin, N.I. Chkhalo, A.D. Buravleuv, S.N. Yakunin
Abstract: This study explores the use of synchrotron measurements as a nanometrology tool for blazed gratings. In grazing incidence geometry, one can measure both the conical diffraction and the diffuse scattering on the grating simultaneously in a single scattering pattern. The sensitivity of scattering patterns to the structure of the blazed gratings is evaluated. The diffraction component of the pattern is shown to be sensitive to the average groove profile of the gratings. Meanwhile, the diffuse scattering depends on the roughness morphology of the reflective surface of blazed gratings. These findings are supported by numerical simulations. The simulations were performed using several rigorous solvers for the Helmholtz equations, and with a perturbation theory. The analysis relies on synchrotron data, as well as data from atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The aim of this article is to draw the attention of the optical community to the synchrotron measurements as a nanometrology tool for the modern optical elements.

Title: Holographic Strange Metals for Philosophers and Physicists
Authors: Enrico Cinti, Sebastian De Haro, Mark Golden, Umut Gürsoy, Henk T.C. Stoof
Abstract: This paper introduces the physics and philosophy of strange metals, which are characterized by unusual electrical and thermal properties that deviate from conventional metallic behaviour. The anomalous strange-metal behaviour discussed here appears in the normal state of a copper-oxide high-temperature superconductor, and it cannot be described using standard condensed-matter physics. Currently, it can only be described through a holographic dual, viz.~a four-dimensional black hole in anti-de Sitter spacetime. This paper first introduces the theory of, and specific experiments carried out on, strange metals. Then it discusses a number of philosophical questions that strange metals open up regarding the experimental evidence for holography and its realist interpretation. Strange metals invert the explanatory arrows, in that usual holographic arguments are seen as giving explanations of the bulk quantum-gravity theory from the boundary. By contrast, the aim here is, by using holography, to explain the experimentally discovered and anomalous properties of strange metals.

Title: Viscosity variation in fluid flows across scale
Authors: Arjun Sharma, Ritabrata Thakur, Sharath Jose, Rama Govindarajan
Abstract: A wide range of natural and engineered fluid flows exhibit spatial or temporal viscosity variations, spanning scales from microbial locomotion to planetary mantle convection. These variations introduce qualitatively new physical mechanisms absent in constant-viscosity flows. This review surveys such phenomena across scales. In low Reynolds number (Stokes) flows, viscosity gradients couple translation and rotation, enabling novel particle responses to uniform forcing-- mechanisms that microorganisms may exploit. In shear flows, viscosity variation alters base flow profiles and breaks symmetries, modifying stability and transition dynamics. At high Reynolds numbers, stratification fundamentally changes the singular perturbation structure governing energy production, enhancing or suppressing canonical instabilities and introducing new ones. Viscosity variation also affects nonnormal growth and nonlinear interactions that drive transition to turbulence. While laminar and fully developed turbulence have been extensively studied, transitional processes remain poorly understood in variable-viscosity flows. In turbulent regimes, viscosity variation impacts jets, wall-bounded flows, and mixing layers. At geophysical scales, incorporating eddy viscosity stratification in climate models may improve predictions, while in Earth's mantle, viscosity contrasts drive large-scale convection and geological evolution. Particle-laden flows, common across contexts, can generate effective viscosity stratification through inhomogeneous loading. Throughout, we highlight cases where viscosity variation alters flow behavior qualitatively, and point to open questions. This review aims to guide graduate students and researchers toward tractable, cross-disciplinary problems.

Title: A Statistical Physics perspective on fairness in shared expenses: The bar bill analogy
Authors: Nuno Crokidakis, Lucas Sigaud
Abstract: In social contexts where individuals consume varying amounts, such as shared meals or bar gatherings, splitting the total bill equally often yields surprisingly fair outcomes. In this work, we develop a statistical physics framework to explain this emergent fairness by modeling individual consumption as stochastic variables drawn from a realistic distribution, specifically the gamma distribution. Introducing a Boltzmann-like weighting factor, we derive exact analytical expressions for the partition function, average consumption, variance, and entropy under economic or social penalization constraints. Numerical simulations, performed using the Marsaglia-Tsang algorithm, confirm the analytical results with high precision. Drawing a direct parallel between individual consumption and ideal gas particle energy in the canonical ensemble, we show how the law of large numbers, mutual compensation, and the effective ordering induced by penalization combine to make equal cost-sharing statistically robust and predictable. These findings reveal that what appears to be an informal social convention is, in fact, grounded in the same fundamental principles that govern the collective behavior of particles in thermodynamic systems, highlighting the interdisciplinary power of statistical physics.

Title: Optimised Feature Subset Selection via Simulated Annealing
Authors: Fernando Martínez-García, Álvaro Rubio-García, Samuel Fernández-Lorenzo, Juan José García-Ripoll, Diego Porras
Abstract: We introduce SA-FDR, a novel algorithm for $\ell_0$-norm feature selection that considers this task as a combinatorial optimisation problem and solves it by using simulated annealing to perform a global search over the space of feature subsets. The optimisation is guided by the Fisher discriminant ratio, which we use as a computationally efficient proxy for model quality in classification tasks. Our experiments, conducted on datasets with up to hundreds of thousands of samples and hundreds of features, demonstrate that SA-FDR consistently selects more compact feature subsets while achieving a high predictive accuracy. This ability to recover informative yet minimal sets of features stems from its capacity to capture inter-feature dependencies often missed by greedy optimisation approaches. As a result, SA-FDR provides a flexible and effective solution for designing interpretable models in high-dimensional settings, particularly when model sparsity, interpretability, and performance are crucial.

Title: Graph-based block-diagonalization of full configuration interaction Hamiltonian: H$_2$ chains study
Authors: Hayun Park, Hunpyo Lee
Abstract: We developed a graph-based block-diagonalization (GBBD) method for the full configuration interaction Hamiltonian of molecular systems to efficiently calculate the exact eigenvalues of low-energy states. In this approach, the non-zero matrix elements of the Hamiltonian are represented as edges on a graph, which naturally decomposes into disconnected clusters. Each cluster corresponds to an independent block in the block-diagonalized form of the Hamiltonian. The eigenvalues in the low-energy sector were obtained by solving the eigenvalue problem for each block matrix and by solving a modified Hamiltonian subject to orthonormality constraints with respect to previously computed lower-energy eigenstates. We applied the GBBD method to linear hydrogen H chains ranging from H$_2$ to H$_{12}$. The results showed excellent agreement with exact ones, confirming both the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method. Finally, we discussed several physical properties with respect to the number of H$_2$ molecules.

Title: Real-space Hubbard-corrected density functional theory
Authors: Sayan Bhowmik, Andrew J. Medford, Phanish Suryanarayana
Abstract: We present an accurate and efficient framework for real-space Hubbard-corrected density functional theory. In particular, we obtain expressions for the energy, atomic forces, and stress tensor suitable for real-space finite-difference discretization, and develop a large-scale parallel implementation. We verify the accuracy of the formalism through comparisons with established planewave results. We demonstrate that the implementation is highly efficient and scalable, outperforming established planewave codes by more than an order of magnitude in minimum time to solution, with increasing advantages as the system size and/or number of processors is increased. We apply this framework to examine the impact of exchange-correlation inconsistency in local atomic orbital generation and introduce a scheme for optimizing the Hubbard parameter based on hybrid functionals, both while studying TiO$_2$ polymorphs.

Title: Quasi-continuous sub-$μ$K strontium source without a high-finesse cavity stabilized laser
Authors: Sana Boughdachi, Benedikt Heizenreder, Ananya Sitaram, Erik Dierikx, Yan Xie, Sander Klemann, Paul Klop, Jeroen Koelemeij, Rafał Wilk, Florian Schreck, Andreas Brodschelm
Abstract: We demonstrate a quasi-continuous sub-$\mu$K strontium source achieved without the use of a high-finesse cavity-locked laser. Our frequency reference is based on a dispersion-optimized, fiber-based frequency comb that enables sub-kHz linewidths. The long-term stability of the comb is defined by an external RF reference: either a 10 MHz RF signal from the Dutch Metrology Institute (VSL), or a tunable RF source whose long-term stability is maintained by monitoring and stabilizing the position of a narrow-line magneto-optical trap (MOT). The comb-stabilized system is benchmarked against a conventional cavity-locked laser and achieves comparable performance in broadband and single-frequency MOTs using the narrow $^1$S$_0$ $\rightarrow$ $^3$P$_1$ laser cooling transition. We generate high-flux, sub-$\mu$K samples of all three bosonic strontium isotopes and demonstrate quasi-continuous outcoupling from the MOT. These results highlight the system's suitability for compact, robust, and field-deployable continuous cold atom devices.

Title: Probing graph topology from local quantum measurements
Authors: F. Romeo, J. Settino
Abstract: We show that global properties of an unknown quantum network, such as the average degree, hub density, and the number of closed paths of fixed length, can be inferred from strictly local quantum measurements. In particular, we demonstrate that a malicious agent with access to only a small subset of nodes can initialize quantum states locally and, through repeated short-time measurements, extract sensitive structural information about the entire network. The intrusion strategy is inspired by extreme learning and quantum reservoir computing and combines short-time quantum evolution with a non-iterative linear readout with trainable weights. These results suggest new strategies for intrusion detection and structural diagnostics in future quantum Internet infrastructures.

Title: Entanglement Suppression Due to Black Hole Scattering
Authors: Kazuki Doi, Tadashi Takayanagi
Abstract: We consider the evolution of entanglement entropy in a two-dimensional conformal field theory with a holographic dual. Specifically, we are interested in a class of excited states produced by a combination of pure-state (local operator) and mixed-state local quenches. We employ a method that allows us to determine the full time evolution analytically. While a single insertion of a local operator gives rise to a logarithmic time profile of entanglement entropy relative to the vacuum, we find that this growth is heavily suppressed in the presence of a mixed-state quench, reducing it to a time-independent constant bump. The degree of suppression depends on the relative position of the quenches as well as the ratio of regularization parameters associated with the quenches. This work sheds light on the interesting properties of gravitational scattering involving black holes.

Title: Quantum scarring enhances non-Markovianity of subsystem dynamics
Authors: Aditya Banerjee
Abstract: Given that any subsystem of a closed out-of-equilibrium quantum system is an open quantum system, its dynamics (reduced from the full system's unitary evolution) can be either Markovian (memory-less) or non-Markovian, with the latter necessarily impeding the process of relaxation and thermalization. Seemingly independently, such non-ergodic dynamics occurs when an initial state has spectral weight on the so-called quantum scar states, which are non-thermalizing states embedded deep in the spectrum of otherwise thermal states. In this article, we present numerical evidence that the presence of quantum scars is a microscopic ingredient that enables and enhances non-Markovianity of the dynamics of subsystems. We exemplify this with the PXP model and its deformations which either enhance or erase the signatures of scarred dynamics when quenched from a simple product state that is known to have significant overlaps with the scarred subspace in the spectrum. By probing information backflows with the dynamical behaviour of the distances between temporally-separated states of small subsystems, systematic signatures of subsystem non-Markovianity in these models are presented, and it is seen that scarring-enhancing (erasing) deformations also exhibit enhanced (diminished) subsystem non-Markovianity. This sheds new light on the dynamical memories associated with quantum scarring, and opens interesting new questions at the interface of quantum scarring and an open quantum systems approach to investigating far-from-equilibrium and non-thermalizing isolated quantum many-body systems.

Title: Universal tradeoff relations between resource cost and irreversibility of channels: General-resource Wigner-Araki-Yanase theorems and beyond
Authors: Hiroyasu Tajima, Koji Yamaguchi, Ryuji Takagi, Yui Kuramochi
Abstract: Quantum technologies offer exceptional -- sometimes almost magical -- speed and performance, yet every quantum process costs physical resources. Designing next-generation quantum devices, therefore, depends on solving the following question: which resources, and in what amount, are required to implement a desired quantum process? Casting the problem in the language of quantum resource theories, we prove a universal cost-irreversibility tradeoff: the lower the irreversibility of a quantum process, the greater the required resource cost for its realization. The trade-off law holds for a broad range of resources -- energy, magic, asymmetry, coherence, athermality, and others -- yielding lower bounds on resource cost of any quantum channel. Its broad scope positions this result as a foundation for deriving the following key results: (1) we show a universal relation between the energetic cost and the irreversibility for arbitrary channels, encompassing the energy-error tradeoff for any measurement or unitary gate; (2) we extend the energy-error tradeoff to free energy and work costs; (3) we extend the Wigner-Araki-Yanase theorem, which is the universal limitation on measurements under conservation laws, to a wide class of resource theories: the probability of failure in distinguishing resourceful states via a measurement is inversely proportional to its resource cost; (4) we prove that infinitely many resource-non-increasing operations in fact require an infinite implementation cost. These findings reveal a universal relationship between quantumness and irreversibility, providing a first step toward a general theory that explains when -- and how -- quantumness can suppress irreversibility.

Title: Wave propagation in an elastic lattice with non-reciprocal stiffness and engineered damping
Authors: Harshit Kumar Sandhu, Saurav Dutta, Rajesh Chaunsali
Abstract: Nonreciprocal wave propagation allows for directional energy transport. In this work, we systematically investigate wave dynamics in an elastic lattice that combines nonreciprocal stiffness with viscous damping. After establishing how conventional damping counteracts the system's gain, we introduce a non-dissipative form of nonreciprocal damping in the form of gyroscopic damping. We find that the coexistence of nonreciprocal stiffness and nonreciprocal damping results in a decoupled control mechanism. The nonreciprocal stiffness is shown to govern the temporal amplification rate, while the nonreciprocal damper independently tunes the wave's group velocity and oscillation frequency. This decoupling gives rise to phenomena such as the enhancement of net amplification for slower-propagating waves and boundary-induced wave mixing. These findings provide a theoretical framework for designing active metamaterials with more versatile control over their wave propagation characteristics.

Title: Intrinsic Heralding and Optimal Decoders for Non-Abelian Topological Order
Authors: Dian Jing, Pablo Sala, Liang Jiang, Ruben Verresen
Abstract: Topological order (TO) provides a natural platform for storing and manipulating quantum information. However, its stability to noise has only been systematically understood for Abelian TOs. In this work, we exploit the non-deterministic fusion of non-Abelian anyons to inform active error correction and design decoders where the fusion products, instead of flag qubits, herald the noise. This intrinsic heralding enhances thresholds over those of Abelian counterparts when noise is dominated by a single non-Abelian anyon type. Furthermore, we present an approach for determining the optimal threshold for non-Abelian TOs with perfect anyon syndromes for any noise model, formulated as a statistical mechanics model using Bayesian inference. We numerically illustrate these results for $D_4 \cong \mathbb Z_4 \rtimes \mathbb Z_2$ TO. In particular, for non-Abelian charge noise and perfect syndrome measurement, we find an optimal threshold $p_c=0.218(1)$, whereas an intrinsically heralded minimal-weight perfect-matching (MWPM) decoder already gives $p_c=0.20842(2)$, outperforming standard MWPM with $p_c = 0.15860(1)$. Our work highlights how non-Abelian properties can enhance stability, rather than reduce it, and discusses potential generalizations for achieving fault tolerance.

Title: Transport-Induced Decoherence of the Entangled Triplet Exciton Pair
Authors: Gerald Curran III, Luke J. Weaver, Zachary Rex, Ivan Biaggio
Abstract: Decoherence effects for entangled triplet pairs in organic molecular crystals are analyzed for the case when excitons can hop between inequivalent lattice sites. The fluorescence quantum beats caused by quantum interference upon triplet-triplet recombination into an emissive singlet state are predicted as a function of hopping time and magnetic field based on a Monte Carlo analysis. Depending on exciton hopping rates, it is possible to have complete global decoherence and suppression of fluorescence quantum beats in the limit of zero magnetic field, and to have quantum beats that decay at different rates depending on magnetic field strength.

Title: Slow Relaxation and Landscape-Driven Dynamics in Viscous Ripening Foams
Authors: Amruthesh Thirumalaiswamy, Clary Rodríguez-Cruz, Robert A. Riggleman, John C. Crocker
Abstract: Foams and dense emulsions display complex mechanical behavior, including intermittent rearrangement dynamics, power-law rheology, and slow recovery after perturbation. These effects have long been considered evidence for glassy physics in these and other materials having similar mechanics, such as the cytoskeleton. Here we study such anomalous mechanics in a simulated wet foam driven by ripening and find behavior that has a different physical origin than that in glasses. Rather, the dynamics is due to a balance of forces from the system's self-similar potential energy landscape and viscous stress. At the lowest viscosities, bubbles move intermittently, with the system shifting abruptly between shallow potential energy minima. For higher viscosities, in contrast, the bubbles move continuously and the system follows a tortuous, fractal path through high-dimensional configuration space, at higher mean energy than the lower viscosity case. The long-time dynamics and power-law rheology are the direct consequence of the potential energy landscape's self-similar geometry. Lastly, we find that the slow recovery of perturbed foams is due to the foam being kinetically rather than energetically trapped in high-energy portions of the energy landscape. Overall, viscous ripening foams follow a biased energy minimization pathway that explores regions of the energy landscape that are qualitatively different (flatter and smoother) than those corresponding to well-annealed glasses.

Title: Pausing ultrafast melting by timed multiple femtosecond-laser pulses
Authors: Tobias Zier, Eeuwe S. Zijlstra, Martin E. Garcia, David A. Strubbe
Abstract: An intense femtosecond-laser excitation of a solid induces highly nonthermal conditions. In materials like silicon, laser-induced bond-softening leads to a highly incoherent ionic motion and eventually nonthermal melting. But is this outcome an inevitable consequence, or can it be controlled? Here, we performed ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of crystalline silicon after timed multiple femtosecond-laser pulse excitations with fluence above the nonthermal melting threshold. Our results demonstrate an excitation mechanism that pauses nonthermal melting and creates a metastable state instead, with an electronic structure similar to the ground state. This mechanism can be generalized to other materials, potentially enabling structural and/or electronic transitions to metastable phases in the high-excitation regime. In addition, our approach could be used to switch off nonthermal contributions in experiments, allowing reliable electron-phonon coupling constants to be obtained more easily.

Abstract: Skyrmions in noncentrosymmetric materials are believed to occur due to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. By contrast, the skyrmion formation mechanism in centrosymmetric materials remains elusive. Here, we reveal the intrinsic electronic structure of the centrosymmetric GdRu2Si2 by selectively measuring magnetic domains using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). We found robust Fermi surface (FS) nesting, consistent with the magnetic modulation q-vector detected by the previous resonant x-ray scattering measurements. The pseudogap opens at the nested FS portions, which vary for different magnetic domains. The anomalous pseudogap disconnects the FS to generate Fermi arcs with twofold symmetry. These results indicate that the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction plays a decisive role in generating the screw spin modulation responsible for the skyrmion formation in GdRu2Si2. Furthermore, we demonstrate the flexible nature of magnetism in GdRu2Si2 by manipulating magnetic domains with magnetic field and temperature cyclings, providing potential future applications for data storage and processing devices.

Title: Interaction robustness of the chiral anomaly in Weyl semimetals and Luttinger liquids from a mixed anomaly approach
Authors: Shuyang Wang, Jay D. Sau
Abstract: The chiral anomaly is one of the robust quantum effects in relativistic field theories with a chiral symmetry where charges in chiral sectors appear to be separately conserved. The chiral anomaly, which is often associated with a renormalization-invariant topological term, is a violation of this conservation law due to quantum effects. Such anomalies manifest in Weyl materials as an electromagnetic field-induced transfer of charge between Fermi pockets. However, the emergent nature of the conservation of chiral charge leads to manifestations of the chiral anomaly response that depend on the details of the system such as the strength of interactions. In this paper, we apply an approach where the chiral symmetry in solid materials is replaced by the combination of charge $U(1)$ gauge and spatial translation symmetry. The chiral anomaly in this case is replaced by a mixed anomaly between the two symmetries and the chiral charge can be defined as being proportional to the total momentum. We show that the chiral anomaly associated with this chiral charge is unrenormalized by interactions in contrast to other chiral charges in $(1+1)D$ whose renormalization is regularization dependent. In $(3+1)$D Weyl systems, this chiral anomaly is equivalent to the charge transferred between Fermi surfaces which can be measured through changes in Fermi-surface-enclosed volume. We propose a pump-probe technique to measure this.

Title: Tuning Fermi Liquids with polaritonic Cavities
Authors: Riccardo Riolo, Andrea Tomadin, Giacomo Mazza, Reza Asgari, Allan H. MacDonald, Marco Polini
Abstract: The question of whether or not passive sub-wavelength cavities can alter the properties of quantum materials is currently attracting a great deal of attention. In this Article we show that the Fermi liquid parameters of a two-dimensional metal are modified by cavity polariton modes, and that these changes can be monitored by measuring a paradigmatic magneto-transport phenomenon, Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in a weak perpendicular magnetic field. This effect is intrinsic, and totally unrelated to disorder. As an illustrative example, we carry out explicit calculations of the quasiparticle velocity of graphene in a planar van der Waals cavity formed by natural hyperbolic crystals and metal gates. The largest effects of the cavity occur when the phonon polariton modes of the former match energetically the graphene plasmon. For typical graphene carrier densities this occurs in the Terahertz spectral range.

Title: Area laws and thermalization from classical entropies in a Bose-Einstein condensate
Authors: Yannick Deller, Martin Gärttner, Tobias Haas, Markus K. Oberthaler, Moritz Reh, Helmut Strobel
Abstract: The scaling of local quantum entropies is of utmost interest for characterizing quantum fields, many-body systems, and gravity. Despite their importance, theoretically and experimentally accessing quantum entropies is challenging as they are nonlinear functionals of the underlying quantum state. Here, we show that suitably chosen classical entropies capture many features of their quantum analogs for an experimentally relevant setting. We describe the post-quench dynamics of a multi-well spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate from an initial product state via measurement distributions of spin observables and estimate the corresponding entropies using the asymptotically unbiased $k$-nearest neighbor method. We observe the dynamical build-up of quantum correlations signaled by an area law, as well as local thermalization revealed by a transition to a volume law, both in regimes characterized by non-Gaussian distributions. We emphasize that all relevant features can be observed at small sample numbers without reconstructing the underlying state or measurement distributions, rendering our method directly applicable to a large variety of models and experimental platforms.

Title: Kohn-Luttinger-like mechanism for unconventional charge density waves
Authors: Hannes Braun, Michael M. Scherer, Laura Classen
Abstract: Interaction-induced charge orders with electronic origin occur as states of spontaneously broken symmetry in several materials platforms. An electronic mechanism for charge order requires an attractive component in the effective charge vertex. We put forward such a mechanism for the formation of unconventional charge density waves in a metal. These states result from the condensation of particle-hole pairs with finite wave vector and non-zero angular momentum and correspond to bond or loop current order on a lattice. The mechanism we describe can be viewed as Kohn Luttinger analysis in the particle-hole channel with finite transferred momentum. It incorporates one-loop spin and pairing correctionsn, which are then used as an input for a summation in the charge channel triggering an instability. We extend our analysis to a spin-fluctuation approach, where the effective charge interaction is dressed by the particle-hole ladder with exchanged momentum. We argue that this mechanism works for weakly-interacting metals with nested Fermi surface and a large number of fermion flavors. We apply the Kohn-Luttinger-like approach to square- and triangular-lattice Hubbard models with SU($N_f$) flavour symmetry and show that it leads to different types of $p$-wave charge density waves. We also study effects beyond weak coupling at and away from Van Hove filling in terms of a phenomenological model with additional exchange interaction. In the vicinity of Van Hove filling, we obtain $d$-wave charge density waves with wave vectors determined by nesting as leading instabilities. In addition, we find another charge density wave with wave vector $K/4$ on the triangular lattice on both sides of Van Hove filling. We demonstrate that this $K/4$ instability can win the competition against pairing for $N_f=4$ via an unbiased functional renormalisation group calculation.

Title: Equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium critical dynamics of the three-dimensional Heisenberg model with random cubic anisotropy
Authors: A. Astillero, J. J. Ruiz-Lorenzo
Abstract: We study the critical dynamics of the three-dimensional Heisenberg model with random cubic anisotropy in the out-of-equilibrium and equilibrium regimes. Analytical approaches based on field theory predict that the universality class of this model is that of the three-dimensional site-diluted Ising model. We have been able to estimate the dynamic critical exponent by working in the equilibrium regime and by computing the integrated autocorrelation times obtaining $z=2.50(5)$ (without taking into account scaling corrections) and $z=2.29(11)$ (by fixing the scaling corrections to that predicted by field theory). In the out-of-equilibrium regime we have focused in the study of the dynamic correlation length which has allowed us to compute the dynamic critical exponent obtaining $z=2.38(2)$, which is compatible with the equilibrium ones. Finally, both estimates are also compatible with the most accurate prediction $z=2.35(2)$, from numerical simulations of the 3D site-diluted Ising model, in agreement with the predictions based on field theory.

Title: Fast Sampling of Protein Conformational Dynamics
Authors: Michael A. Sauer, Souvik Mondal, Brandon Neff, Sthitadhi Maiti, Matthias Heyden
Abstract: Protein function does not solely depend on structure but often relies on dynamical transitions between distinct conformations. Despite this fact, our ability to characterize or predict protein dynamics is substantially less developed compared to state-of-the-art protein structure prediction. Molecular simulations provide unique opportunities to study protein dynamics, but the timescales associated with conformational changes generate substantial challenges. Enhanced sampling algorithms with collective variables can greatly reduce the computational cost of sampling slow processes. However, defining collective variables suitable to enhance sampling of protein conformational transitions is non-trivial. Low-frequency vibrations have long been considered as promising candidates for collective variable but their identification so far relied on assumptions inherently invalid at low frequencies. We recently introduced an analysis of molecular vibrations that does not rely on such approximations and remains accurate at low frequencies. Here, we modified this approach to efficiently isolate low-frequency vibrations in proteins and applied it to a set of five proteins of varying complexity. We demonstrate that our approach is not only highly reproducible but results in collective variables that consistently enhance sampling of protein conformational transitions and associated free energy surfaces on timescales compatible with high throughput applications. This enables the efficient generation of protein conformational ensembles, which will be key for future prediction algorithms aiming beyond static protein structures.

Title: Full counting statistics after quantum quenches as hydrodynamic fluctuations
Authors: David X. Horvath, Benjamin Doyon, Paola Ruggiero
Abstract: The statistics of fluctuations on large regions of space encodes universal properties of many-body systems. At equilibrium, it is described by thermodynamics. However, away from equilibrium such as after quantum quenches, the fundamental principles are more nebulous. In particular, although exact results have been conjectured in integrable models, a correct understanding of the physics is largely missing. In this letter, we explain these principles, taking the example of the number of particles lying on a large interval in one-dimensional interacting systems. These are based on simple hydrodynamic arguments from the theory of ballistically transported fluctuations, and in particular the Euler-scale transport of long-range correlations. Using these principles, we obtain the full counting statistics (FCS) in terms of thermodynamic and hydrodynamic quantities, whose validity depends on the structure of hydrodynamic modes and on the fluctuations in the initial state. In fermionic-statistics interacting integrable models with a continuum of hydrodynamic modes, such as the Lieb-Liniger model for cold atomic gases, the formula reproduces previous conjectures, but is in fact not exact: it gives the correct cumulants up to, including, order 5, while long-range correlations modify higher cumulants. In integrable and non-integrable models with two or less hydrodynamic modes, the formula is expected to give all cumulants.

Title: Dominant end-tunneling effect in two distinct Luttinger liquids coexisting in one quantum wire

Abstract: Luttinger liquids occupy a special place in physics as the most understood case of essentially quantum many-body systems. The experimental mission of measuring its main prediction, power laws in observable quantities, has already produced a body of exponents in different semiconductor and metallic structures. Here, we combine tunneling spectroscopy with density-dependent transport measurements in the same quantum wires over more than two orders of magnitude in temperature to very low electron temperatures down to $\sim$40 mK. This reveals that, when the second 1D subband becomes populated, the temperature dependence splits into two ranges with different exponents in the power-law dependence of the conductance, both dominated by the finite-size effect of the end-tunneling process. This result demonstrates the importance of measuring the Luttinger parameters as well as the number of modes independently through spectroscopy in addition to the transport exponent in the characterization of Luttinger liquids. This opens a new pathway to unambiguous interpretation of the exponents observed in quantum wires.

Title: Two Channel Kondo behavior in the quantum XX chain with a boundary defect
Authors: Yicheng Tang, Pradip Kattel, J.H. Pixley, Natan Andrei
Abstract: We demonstrate that a boundary defect in the single spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ quantum $XX$ chain exhibits two-channel Kondo physics. Due to the presence of the defect, the edge spin fractionalizes into two Majorana fermions, out of which one decouples, and one is overscreened by the free fermion in bulk, leading to non-trivial boundary behavior characteristic of the two-channel Kondo model. When the ratio of boundary to bulk coupling exceeds a critical value of $\sqrt{2}$, a massive boundary-bound mode is exponentially localized near the impurity site for strong impurity coupling. This leads to unusual behavior in physical quantities, such as the $g$-function not being monotonic. We compute the $g-$function of the impurity from both thermodynamic and entanglement entropy calculations and show that it takes a non-integer value of $\sqrt{2}$ just as in the two-channel Kondo problem.

Title: Universal Efimov Scaling in the Rabi-Coupled Few-Body Spectrum
Authors: Anthony N. Zulli, Brendan C. Mulkerin, Meera M. Parish, Jesper Levinsen
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of the Efimov effect -- a universal quantum few-body phenomenon -- in the presence of an external driving field. Specifically, we consider up to three bosonic atoms, such as $^{133}$Cs, interacting with a light atom, such as $^{6}$Li, where the latter has two internal spin states $\{\uparrow, \downarrow\}$ that are Rabi coupled. Assuming that only the spin-$\uparrow$ light atom interacts with the bosons, we find that the Rabi drive transposes the entire Efimov spectrum such that the Efimov trimers and tetramers are centered around the Rabi-shifted two-body scattering resonance. Crucially, we show that the Rabi drive preserves the trimers' discrete scaling symmetry, while universally shifting the Efimov three-body parameter, leading to a log-periodic modulation in the spectrum as the Rabi drive is varied. Our results suggest that Efimov physics can be conveniently explored using an applied driving field, opening up the prospect of an externally tunable three-body parameter.

Title: Top eigenpair statistics of diluted Wishart matrices
Authors: Barak Budnick, Preben Forer, Pierpaolo Vivo, Sabrina Aufiero, Silvia Bartolucci, Fabio Caccioli
Abstract: Using the replica method, we compute the statistics of the top eigenpair of diluted covariance matrices of the form $\mathbf{J} = \mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{X}$, where $\mathbf{X}$ is a $N\times M$ sparse data matrix, in the limit of large $N,M$ with fixed ratio and a bounded number of nonzero entries. We allow for random non-zero weights, provided they lead to an isolated largest eigenvalue. By formulating the problem as the optimisation of a quadratic Hamiltonian constrained to the $N$-sphere at low temperatures, we derive a set of recursive distributional equations for auxiliary probability density functions, which can be efficiently solved using a population dynamics algorithm. The average largest eigenvalue is identified with a Lagrange parameter that governs the convergence of the algorithm, and the resulting stable populations are then used to evaluate the density of the top eigenvector's components. We find excellent agreement between our analytical results and numerical results obtained from direct diagonalisation.

Title: Skyrmion motion in a synthetic antiferromagnet driven by asymmetric spin wave emission
Authors: Christopher E. A. Barker, Charles Parton-Barr, Christopher H. Marrows, Olga Kazakova, Craig Barton
Abstract: Skyrmions have been proposed as new information carriers in racetrack memory devices. To realise such devices, a small size; high speed of propagation; and minimal skyrmion Hall angle are required. Synthetic antiferromagnets (SAFs) present the ideal materials system to realise these aims. In this work, we use micromagnetic simulations to propose a new method for manipulating them using exclusively global magnetic fields. An out-of-plane microwave field induces oscillations in the skyrmions radius which in turn emits spin waves. When a static in-plane field is added, this breaks the symmetry of the skyrmions and causes asymmetric spin wave emission. This in turn drives motion of the skyrmions, with the fastest velocities observed at the frequency of the intrinsic out-of-phase breathing mode of the pair of skyrmions. This behaviour is investigated over a range of experimentally realistic antiferromagnetic interlayer exchange coupling strengths, and the results compared to previous works studying similar motion driven with an oscillating electric field. Through this the true effect of varying the exchange coupling strength is determined, and greater insight is gained into the mechanism of skyrmion motion. These results will help to inform the design of future novel computing architectures based on the dynamics of skyrmions in synthetic antiferromagnets.

Title: Competition between terahertz magnetoelectric and Néel spin-orbit torque driven spin dynamics in metallic antiferromagnets
Authors: R.M. Dubrovin, A.V. Kimel, A.K. Zvezdin
Abstract: Although magnetoelectric effects in metals are usually neglected, assuming that applied electric fields are screened by free charge carriers, the skin depth, defining the penetration depth of the fields, is non-zero and for THz electric fields typically reaches 400 nm. Hence, if the thickness of an antiferromagnetic film is of the order of tens of nm, electric field induced effects cannot be neglected. Here, we theoretically study the THz electric field induced spin dynamics in the metallic antiferromagnet $\mathrm{Mn}_{2}\mathrm{Au}$, whose spin arrangements allow it to exhibit a linear magnetoelectric effect. We show that the THz magnetoelectric torque in metallic antiferromagnets is proportional to the time derivative of the polarization induced by the THz electric field. Our simulations reveal that the magnetoelectric driven spin dynamics is indeed not negligible, and for a fair explanation of previously published experimental results in $\mathrm{Mn}_{2}\mathrm{Au}$ competition between THz magnetoelectric and Néel spin-orbit torques must be taken into account. Thus, it is shown that even in metallic antiferromagnets the THz magnetoelectric effect on spins can be strong and thus cannot be neglected.

Title: Listen! It's a phase transition. The sound of a shape-memory alloy
Authors: Carlo Andrea Rozzi, Annamaria Lisotti, Guido Goldoni, Valentina De Renzi
Abstract: Shape-memory alloys exhibit a solid-to-solid phase transition that involves a temperature-driven rearrangement of their crystal structure and is responsible for their remarkable properties and numerous technological applications. Here, we propose a simple experiment that analyzes the sound emitted by a Ni$_{40}$Ti$_{50}$Cu$_{10}$ bar at different temperatures as it undergoes a transition between its austenite and martensite phases. We show that the phase transition, which occurs slightly above room temperature, can be qualitatively detected by the ear and quantitatively described using a very simple experimental setup and sound analysis tools. Such a sound-based investigation provides an unusual and engaging way to experimentally introduce solid-to-solid phase transitions, that is suitable for undergraduate courses.

Title: Lattice Protein Folding with Variational Annealing
Authors: Shoummo Ahsan Khandoker, Estelle M. Inack, Mohamed Hibat-Allah
Abstract: Understanding the principles of protein folding is a cornerstone of computational biology, with implications for drug design, bioengineering, and the understanding of fundamental biological processes. Lattice protein folding models offer a simplified yet powerful framework for studying the complexities of protein folding, enabling the exploration of energetically optimal folds under constrained conditions. However, finding these optimal folds is a computationally challenging combinatorial optimization problem. In this work, we introduce a novel upper-bound training scheme that employs masking to identify the lowest-energy folds in two-dimensional Hydrophobic-Polar (HP) lattice protein folding. By leveraging Dilated Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) integrated with an annealing process driven by temperature-like fluctuations, our method accurately predicts optimal folds for benchmark systems of up to 60 beads. Our approach also effectively masks invalid folds from being sampled without compromising the autoregressive sampling properties of RNNs. This scheme is generalizable to three spatial dimensions and can be extended to lattice protein models with larger alphabets. Our findings emphasize the potential of advanced machine learning techniques in tackling complex protein folding problems and a broader class of constrained combinatorial optimization challenges.

Title: Solution-Based Fabrication of High-Performance K$_{0.5}$Na$_{0.5}$NbO$_3$ Thin Films for Surface Haptics
Authors: Nagamalleswara Rao Alluri, Longfei Song, Stephanie Girod, Barnik Mandal, Juliette Cardoletti, Vid Bobnar, Torsten Granzow, Veronika Kovacova, Adrian-Marie Philippe, Emmanuel Defay, Sebastjan Glinsek
Abstract: K$_{0.5}$Na$_{0.5}$NbO$_3$ is among the most promising lead-free piezoelectrics. While its sputtered films match the performance of the champion piezoelectric Pb(Zr,Ti)O$_3$, reproducible processing of high-quality and time-stable solution-processed K$_{0.5}$Na$_{0.5}$NbO$_3$ films remains challenging. Here, we report 1 $\mu$m-thick Mn-doped K$_{0.5}$Na$_{0.5}$NbO$_3$ films prepared through a chemical solution deposition process, which have perfectly dense microstructure and uniform composition across their thickness. The films exhibit a high transverse piezoelectric coefficient ($e_{31,f} = -15.4$ C/m$^2$), high dielectric permittivity ($\varepsilon_r \approx 920$), low dielectric losses ($\tan\delta = 0.05$) and can withstand electric fields up to at least 1 MV/cm. The functional properties show excellent stability over time, and the synthesis process is reproducible. Furthermore, a surface acoustic haptic device is demonstrated by using K$_{0.5}$Na$_{0.5}$NbO$_3$ thin-film actuators. The results demonstrate the high potential of Mn-doped K$_{0.5}$Na$_{0.5}$NbO$_3$ films to become a replacement for lead-based Pb(Zr,Ti)O$_3$ films in piezoelectric applications.

Title: Observation of Two Cascading Screening Processes in an Iron-based Superconductor
Authors: Ming-Hua Chang, Steffen Backes, Donghui Lu, Nicolas Gauthier, Makoto Hashimoto, Guan-Yu Chen, Hai-Hu Wen, Sung-Kwan Mo, Zhi-Xun Shen, Roser Valenti, Heike Pfau
Abstract: Understanding how renormalized quasiparticles emerge in strongly correlated electron materials provides a challenge for both experiment and theory. It has been predicted that distinctive spin and orbital screening mechanisms drive this process in multiorbital materials with strong Coulomb and Hund's interactions. Here, we provide the experimental evidence of both mechanisms from angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy on RbFe$_2$As$_2$. We observe that the emergence of low-energy Fe 3$d_{xy}$ quasiparticles below 90K is tied to spin screening. A second process changes the spectral weight at high energies up to room temperature. Supported by theoretical calculations we attribute it to orbital screening of Fe 3d atomic excitations. These two cascading screening processes drive the temperature evolution from a bad metal to a correlated Fermi liquid.

Title: Dynamics and stability of U(1) spin liquids beyond mean-field theory: Triangular-lattice $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model
Authors: Josef Willsher, Johannes Knolle
Abstract: Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) are long-range entangled phases of frustrated magnets exhibiting fractionalized spin excitations. In two dimensions, there is limited analytical understanding of their excitation spectra beyond parton mean-field theories, which fail to capture many features of the finite frequency dynamical response from recent experimental and numerical works. We use a self-consistent random phase approximation (RPA) for the $J_1$-$J_2$ Heiseneberg model on the triangular lattice to describe the strong spinon-spinon interactions of the U(1) Dirac QSL. We obtain quantitative results for the dynamical spin structure factor and phase diagram compatible with comprehensive numerical efforts. We extend the method to chiral QSLs, and discuss its broad range of applicability to other models and for describing inelastic neutron scattering experiments.

Title: Optical control of the moiré twist angle
Authors: Zhiren He, Prathap Kumar Jharapla, Nicolas Leconte, Jeil Jung, Guru Khalsa
Abstract: In this theoretical work, we propose an all-optical method for fast, precise manipulation of two-dimensional multilayers by transferring orbital angular momentum from phase-structured light (e.g. vortex beams) to a 2D material flake. We model the light-matter interaction, analyze the twist dynamics, and develop a phase diagram for optical twists by mapping the system onto an impulsively forced nonlinear pendulum. Our findings reveal rich dynamical responses spanning single- and multi-pulse twist angle control to (quasi)stable dynamical trajectories, and suggest a pathway for all-optical measurement of the twist potential energy. Aided by classical potential estimates for the interlayer energy and numerical simulation, we demonstrate the feasibility of this approach with hexagonal boron nitride bilayers and extend the results to dichalcogenides with first-principles calculations. These results can be generalized to other 2D multilayers, paving the way for scalable and customizable moiré electronics and photonics.

Title: In-plane magnetic field-induced orbital FFLO superconductivity in twisted WSe$_2$ homobilayers
Authors: Jihang Zhu, Yang-Zhi Chou, Yi Huang, Sankar Das Sarma
Abstract: We theoretically predict the in-plane magnetic field-induced orbital Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superconducting states in twisted WSe$_2$ homobilayers (tWSe$_2$), focusing on its dependence on layer polarization and Fermi surface geometry. For unpolarized layers, finite-momentum pairing emerges only at low temperatures and above a critical field $B_{c1,\parallel}$. When layer symmetry is broken, finite-momentum pairing is stabilized at any nonzero field, with a critical temperature higher than that of the zero-momentum state. Notably, we identify a phase transition, which separates two distinct FFLO phases, when there are two separate Fermi pockets residing in the two moiré mini-valleys associated with opposite layers. We further discuss the effects of twist angles and applied field directions. Our findings establish tWSe$_2$ as a promising platform for realizing and manipulating FFLO states via twist angle, displacement field, and filling factor.

Baldoví, M. Reyes Calvo
Abstract: Tailoring magnetoresistance and magnetic anisotropy in van der Waals magnetic materials is essential for advancing their integration into technological applications. In this regard, strain engineering has emerged as a powerful and versatile strategy to control magnetism at the two-dimensional (2D) limit. Here, we demonstrate that compressive biaxial strain significantly enhances the magnetoresistance and magnetic anisotropy of few-layer CrSBr flakes. Strain is efficiently transferred to the flakes from the thermal compression of a polymeric substrate upon cooling, as confirmed by temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy. This strain induces a remarkable increase in the magnetoresistance ratio and in the saturation fields required to align the magnetization of CrSBr along each of its three crystalographic directions, reaching a twofold enhancement along the magnetic easy axis. This enhancement is accompanied by a subtle reduction of the Néel temperature by ~10K. Our experimental results are fully supported by first-principles calculations, which link the observed effects to a strain-driven modification in interlayer exchange coupling and magnetic anisotropy energy. These findings establish strain engineering as a key tool for fine-tuning magnetotransport properties in 2D magnetic semiconductors, paving the way for implementation in spintronics and information storage devices.

Title: Thermal Hall conductivity in the strongest cuprate superconductor: Estimate of the mean free path in the trilayer cuprate HgBa$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8 + δ}$

Abstract: The thermal Hall conductivity of the trilayer cuprate HgBa$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8+\delta}$ (Hg1223) - the superconductor with the highest critical temperature $T_c$ at ambient pressure - was measured at temperatures down to 2 K for three dopings in the underdoped regime ($p$ = 0.09, 0.10, 0.11). By combining a previously introduced simple model and prior theoretical results, we derive a formula for the inverse mean free path, $1 / \ell$, which allows us to estimate the mean free path of $d$-wave quasiparticles in Hg1223 below $T_c$. We find that $1 / \ell$ grows as $T^3$, in agreement with the theoretical expectation for a clean $d$-wave superconductor. Measurements were also conducted on the single layer mercury-based cuprate HgBa$_2$CuO$_{6+\delta}$ (Hg1201), revealing that the mean free path in this compound is roughly half that of its three-layered counterpart at the same doping ($p$ = 0.10). This observation can be attributed to the protective role of the outer planes in Hg1223, which results in a more pristine inner plane. We also report data in an ultraclean crystal of YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ (YBCO) with full oxygen content $p$ = 0.18, believed to be the cleanest of any cuprate, and find that $\ell$ is not longer than in Hg1223.

Title: Tuning the magnetic properties of the spin-split antiferromagnet MnTe through pressure
Authors: Edison P. Carlisle, George Yumnam, Stuart Calder, Bianca Haberl, Jia-Xin Xiong, Michael A. McGuire, Alex Zunger, Raphaël P. Hermann, Benjamin A. Frandsen
Abstract: The hexagonal antiferromagnet MnTe has attracted enormous interest as a prototypical example of a spin-compensated magnet in which the combination of crystal and spin symmetries lifts the spin degeneracy of the electron bands without the need for spin-orbit coupling, a phenomenon called non-relativistic spin splitting (NRSS). Subgroups of NRSS are determined by the specific spin-interconverting symmetry that connects the two opposite-spin sublattices. In MnTe, this symmetry is rotation, leading to the subgroup with spin splitting away from the Brillouin zone center, often called altermagnetism. MnTe also has the largest spontaneous magnetovolume effect of any known antiferromagnet, implying strong coupling between the magnetic moment and volume. This magnetostructural coupling offers a potential knob for tuning the spin-splitting properties of MnTe. Here, we use neutron diffraction with $\textit{in situ}$ applied pressure to determine the effects of pressure on the magnetic properties of MnTe and further explore this magnetostructural coupling. We find that applying pressure significantly increases the Néel temperature but decreases the ordered magnetic moment. We explain this as a consequence of strengthened magnetic exchange interactions under pressure, resulting in higher $T_\mathrm{N}$, with a simultaneous reduction of the local moment of individual Mn atoms, described here via density functional theory. This reflects the increased orbital hybridization and electron delocalization with pressure. These results show that the magnetic properties of MnTe can be controlled by pressure, opening the door to improved properties for spintronic applications through tuning via physical or chemical pressure.

Title: Recovering Hidden Degrees of Freedom Using Gaussian Processes
Authors: Georg Diez, Nele Dethloff, Gerhard Stock
Abstract: Dimensionality reduction represents a crucial step in extracting meaningful insights from Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. Conventional approaches, including linear methods such as principal component analysis as well as various autoencoder architectures, typically operate under the assumption of independent and identically distributed data, disregarding the sequential nature of MD simulations. Here, we introduce a physics-informed representation learning framework that leverages Gaussian Processes combined with variational autoencoders to exploit the temporal dependencies inherent in MD data. Time-dependent kernel functions--such as the Matérn kernel--directly impose the temporal correlation structure of the input coordinates onto a low-dimensional space, preserving Markovianity in the reduced representation while faithfully capturing the essential dynamics. Using a three-dimensional toy model, we demonstrate that this approach can successfully identify and separate dynamically distinct states that are geometrically indistinguishable due to hidden degrees of freedom. Applying the framework to a $50\,\mu$s-long MD trajectory of T4 lysozyme, we uncover dynamically distinct conformational substates that previous analyses failed to resolve, revealing functional relationships that become apparent only when temporal correlations are taken into account. This time-aware perspective provides a promising framework for understanding complex biomolecular systems, in which conventional collective variables fail to capture the full dynamical picture.

Title: Hydrogen Passivation Effects on Spatially Resolved Charge Trap Densities in Si(100)-SiO$_2$
Authors: Adam J. Czarnecki, Nikola L. Kolev, Patrick See, Nick Sullivan, Wyatt A. Behn, Neil J. Curson, Taylor J.Z. Stock, Peter Grütter
Abstract: As silicon-based devices continue to shrink to the nanoscale, traps at the Si-SiO$_2$ interface pose increasing challenges to device performance. These traps reduce channel carrier mobility and shift threshold voltages in integrated circuits, and introduce charge noise in quantum systems, reducing their coherence times. Knowledge of the precise location of such traps aids in understanding their influence on device performance. In this work, we demonstrate that frequency-modulated atomic force microscopy (fm-AFM) allows the detection of individual traps. We use this to study how sample preparation, specifically the introduction of a buried hydrogen termination layer, and post-processing annealing in forming gas (N$_2$+H$_2$), affects the density of donor-like traps in Si(100)-SiO$_2$ systems. We spatially map and quantify traps in both conventionally prepared ("pristine") silicon samples and those processed under ultra-high vacuum for hydrogen resist lithography (HRL). We confirm previous studies demonstrating hydrogen passivation of traps and find that hydrogen termination further reduces the donor-like trap density. We also observe a significant reduction in two-level donor-like traps in the hydrogen-terminated samples compared to pristine silicon samples. These findings suggest that HRL-prepared silicon may offer advantages for high-performance nanoscale and atomic-scale devices due to reduced trap densities.

Title: Revisiting the cofactor conditions: Elimination of transition layers in compound domains
Authors: Mohd Tahseen, Vivekanand Dabade
Abstract: This paper investigates the conditions necessary for the elimination of transition layers at interfaces involving compound domains, extending the classical framework of cofactor conditions. Although cofactor conditions enable stress-free phase boundaries between Type I/II domains and austenite, their applicability to compound domains has remained limited. Here, we present a comprehensive theoretical framework to characterize all compatible interfaces, highlighting the fundamental importance of the commutation property among martensitic variants. By establishing necessary and sufficient algebraic conditions, referred to as extreme compatibility conditions, we demonstrate the simultaneous elimination of transition layers at phase interfaces for both Type I/II and compound laminates, across all volume fractions of the martensitic variants. We also investigate the possibility of achieving supercompatibility in non-conventional twins, recently observed in the NiMnGa system. The focus of our work is on cubic-to-orthorhombic and cubic-to-monoclinic~II phase transformations, for which the extreme compatibility conditions are explicitly derived and systematically analyzed. The theory predicts novel zero-elastic-energy microstructures, including an increased number of triple clusters, spearhead-shaped martensitic nuclei, stress-free inclusions of austenite within martensite, and distinctive four-fold martensitic clusters. This significantly expands the possible modes of forming stress-free interfaces between phases and reveals new energy-minimizing microstructures that can facilitate the nucleation of martensite within austenite and vice versa. These configurations highlight significant enhancements in transformation reversibility and material durability, guiding the rational design of next-generation shape memory alloys with optimized functional properties.

Title: Sub-barrier cavitation in liquid helium
Authors: Mikhail Pekker, Mikhail N. Shneider
Abstract: In this paper, the tunneling mechanism of cavitation in liquid helium for 3He and 4He is considered on the basis of the Schrödinger-like equation. It is assumed that the pairwise interactions of helium atoms are determined by the Lennard-Jones potential. The kinetics of nucleation and the mechanism that limits the growth of cavitation bubbles in liquid helium are considered, taking into account their growth in a negative pressure field.

Title: Elementary Steps of Energy Conversion in Strongly Correlated Systems: Beyond Single Quasiparticles and Rigid Bands
Authors: V. Moshnyaga, Ch. Jooss, P. E. Blöchl, V. Bruchmann-Bamberg, A. Dehning, L. Allen-Rump, C. Hausmann, M. Krüger, A. Rathnakaran, S. Rajpurohit, D. Steil, C. Flathmann, J. Hoffmann, M. Seibt, C. Volkert
Abstract: Energy conversion in materials can be considered as a sequence of elementary steps initiated by a primary excitation. While these steps are quite well understood in classical semiconductors in terms of quasiparticle (QP) excitations and interactions, their understanding in strongly correlated materials is still elusive. Here, we review the progress which has been achieved over recent years by studies of manganite perovskite oxides as a model system for materials with strong correlations. They show a subtle interplay of different types of correlations, i.e., electron-phonon, electron-electron and spin-spin, resulting in rich physical phenomena due to competition between different ground states accompanied by temperature- and field-induced phase transitions. They strongly impact various types of energy conversion and transport processes including friction at surfaces, thermal transport, time-, energy- and power-dependent optical excitations as well as photovoltaic energy conversion. The underlying microscopic processes can be broken down to the behavior of the low-energy thermal and high-energy optical excitations, their interactions, transport and conversion which are theoretically analyzed by using models of interacting and tunable QPs: Their nature and interactions can change during excitation, transport and phase transitions, thus modifying electronic structure. At sufficiently high stimulation, QP excitations can even induce or actuate phase transitions. As a result, we obtained a comprehensive understanding of energy conversion steps going far beyond single QP pictures and rigid band approximations well-known for conventional semiconductors.

Title: Effects of knotting on the collapse of active ring polymers
Authors: Davide Breoni, Emanuele Locatelli, Luca Tubiana
Abstract: We use numerical simulations to study tangentially active flexible ring polymers with different knot topologies. Simple, unknotted active rings display a transition from an extended phase to a collapsed one upon increasing the degree of polymerization. We find that topology has a significant effect on the polymer size at which the collapse takes place, with twist knots collapsing earlier than torus knots. Increasing knot complexity further accentuates this difference, as the collapse point of torus knots grows linearly with the minimum crossing number of the knot while that of twist knots shrinks, eventually canceling the actively stretched regime altogether. This behavior is a consequence of the ordered configuration of torus knots in their stretched active state, featuring an effective alignment for non-neighboring bonds which increases with the minimal crossing number. Twist knots do not feature ordered configurations or bond alignment, increasing the likelihood of collisions, leading to collapse. These results show that topology yields a degree of control on the properties of active ring polymers, and can be used to tune them. At the same time, they suggest that activity might introduce a bias for torus knots, as complex twist knots cannot be formed in extended active polymers.

Title: Effect of Co partitioning to the γ matrix on the microstructural stablity of a Ti-rich Ni-Base Superalloy
Authors: Sudeepta Mukherjee, Hemant Kumar, B.S. Murty, Satyam Suwas, Surendra Kumar Makineni
Abstract: The microstructural stability and mechanical properties of superalloys at high temperatures are significantly influenced by the composition and nature of the solutes they contain. Most of the alloys with high solvus temperature have higher gamma prime coarsening resistance, while the larger lattice misfit is attributed to higher gamma prime coarsening rate. In this work, we explore the influence of Co on the microstructure evolution, thermophysical/mechanical properties and gamma prime precipitate coarsening kinetics in a Ti-rich Ni-Co-Cr-Al-Ti based alloy. More specifically, we focus on the effect of partitioning of Co into the gamma matrix on the redistribution of other solutes across the interface. We observe a significant increase in the coarsening resistance and a twofold increase in the activation energy with the increase in the Co composition from 10at.%Co to 30at.%Co, even though the gamma prime solvus reduces by 75C. As otherwise, a higher solvus, usually, indicates better microstructural stability at high temperatures. We employed a combined experimental and theoretical approach by atom probe tomography (APT) and CALPHAD simulations to probe the critical role of Co partitioning to gamma matrix on the solute transport in the gamma matrix and flux across the gamma/gamma prime interfaces, which is found to control the overall gamma prime coarsening behavior in the alloy. The observed behavior was rationlised by the proposition of a simplistic unified coarsening rate expression that successfully decouples thermodynamic and kinetic contributions. Additionally, we also observe that the gamma prime volume fraction dominates over the gamma prime precipitate size on the 0.2% yield strength (YS) of the alloys.

Title: Light-induced Odd-parity Magnetism in Conventional Collinear Antiferromagnets
Authors: Shengpu Huang, Zheng Qin, Fangyang Zhan, Dong-Hui Xu, Da-Shuai, Rui Wang
Abstract: Recent studies have drawn growing attention on non-relativistic odd-parity magnetism in the wake of altermagnets. Nevertheless, odd-parity spin splitting is often believed to appear in non-collinear magnetic configurations. Here, using symmetry arguments and effective model analysis, we show that Floquet engineering offers a universal strategy for achieving odd-parity magnetism in two-dimensional (2D) collinear antiferromagnets under irradiation of periodic driving light fields such as circularly polarized light, elliptically polarized light, and bicircular light. A comprehensive classification of potential candidates for collinear monolayer or bilayer antiferromagnets is established. Strikingly, the light-induced odd-parity spin splitting can be flexibly controlled by adjusting the crystalline symmetry or the polarization state of incident light, enabling the reversal or conversion of spin-splitting. By combining first-principles calculations and Floquet theorem, we present illustrative examples of 2D collinear antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials to verify the light-induced odd-parity magnetism. Our work not only offers a powerful approach for uniquely achieving odd-parity spin-splitting with high tunability, but also expands the potential of Floquet engineering in designing unconventional compensated magnetism.

Title: Theory of off-diagonal disorder in multilayer topological insulator
Authors: Z.Z. Alisultanov, A. Kudlis
Abstract: We study multilayer topological insulators with random interlayer tunneling, known as off-diagonal disorder. Within the Burkov-Balents model a single Hermitian defect creates a bound state whose energy crosses the middle of the gap in the trivial phase but never in the topological phase; a non-Hermitian defect splits this level yet preserves the same crossing rule, so the effect serves as a local marker of topology. However, the key distinction persists: the bound state crosses zero in the trivial phase but not in the topological phase. Two complementary diagrammatic approaches give matching densities of states for the normal, topological, Weyl and anomalous quantum Hall regimes. Off diagonal disorder inserts bulk states into the gap and can close it: the Weyl phase remains robust under strong disorder, whereas the anomalous quantum Hall phase survives only for weak fluctuations, and the added bulk states shrink the Hall plateau, clarifying experimental deviations. Finally, we analyze edge modes. Uniform disorder shortens their localization length slightly, while Gaussian and Lorentzian disorder enlarge it and in the Gaussian case can even delocalize the edges. Although chirality is maintained, the enhanced overlap permits tunneling between opposite edges and pulls the longitudinal conductance away from its quantized value.

Title: Multi-Gap superconductivity in HgS under pressure
Authors: Pietro Maria Forcella, Cesare Tresca, Antonio Sanna, Gianni Profeta
Abstract: Mercury chalcogenides is a class of materials that exhibit diverse structural phases under pressure, hosting exotic physical properties, including topological phases and chiral phonons. In particular, recent experimental results on HgS reports a new superconducting phase at 21 GPa, whose origin is unknown. In this letter we theoretically investigate the pressure-induced structural phase transition in HgS and the emergence of superconductivity in the rock salt phase. Remarkably, we discover that the rock salt phase hosts a two-gap superconducting phase originating from distinct Fermi surfaces. The unusually high critical temperature of 11 K emerges naturally within this multiband scenario, highlighting the role of interband coupling beyond isotropic approximation. These results place HgS among the few systems where multiband superconductivity is observed.

Title: Correlation functions for open XXZ spin 1/2 quantum chains with unparallel boundary magnetic fields
Authors: G. Niccoli, V. Terras
Abstract: In this paper we continue our derivation of the correlation functions of open quantum spin 1/2 chains with unparallel magnetic fields on the edges; this time for the more involved case of the XXZ spin 1/2 chains. We develop our study in the framework of the quantum Separation of Variables (SoV), which gives us both the complete spectrum characterization and simple scalar product formulae for separate states, including transfer matrix eigenstates. Here, we leave the boundary magnetic field in the first site of the chain completely arbitrary, and we fix the boundary field in the last site $N$ of the chain to be a specific value along the $z$-direction. This is a natural first choice for the unparallel boundary magnetic fields. We prove that under these special boundary conditions, on the one side, we have a simple enough complete spectrum description in terms of homogeneous Baxter like $TQ$-equation. On the other side, we prove a simple enough description of the action of a basis of local operators on transfer matrix eigenstates as linear combinations of separate states. Thanks to these results, we achieve our main goal to derive correlation functions for a set of local operators both for the finite and half-infinite chains, with multiple integral formulae in this last case.

Title: On correlation functions for the open XXZ chain with non-longitudinal boundary fields : the case with a constraint
Authors: G. Niccoli, V. Terras
Abstract: This paper is a continuation of [1], in which a set of matrix elements of local operators was computed for the XXZ spin-1/2 open chain with a particular case of unparallel boundary fields. Here, we extend these results to the more general case in which both fields are non-longitudinal and related by one constraint, allowing for a partial description of the spectrum by usual Bethe equations. More precisely, the complete spectrum and eigenstates can be characterized within the Separation of Variables (SoV) framework. One uses here the fact that, under the constraint, a part of this SoV spectrum can be described via solutions of a usual, homogeneous, TQ-equation, with corresponding transfer matrix eigenstates coinciding with generalized Bethe states. We explain how to generically compute the action of a basis of local operators on such kind of states, and this under the most general boundary condition on the last site of the chain. As a result, we can compute the matrix elements of some of these basis elements in any eigenstate described by the homogenous TQ-equation. Assuming, following a conjecture of Nepomechie and Ravanini, that the ground state itself can be described in this framework, we obtain multiple integral representations for these matrix elements in the half-infinite chain limit, generalizing those previously obtained in the case of longitudinal boundary fields and in the case of the special boundary conditions considered in [1].

Title: Nonperturbative signatures of fractons in the twisted multiflavor Schwinger Model
Authors: Pavel P. Popov, Valentin Kasper, Maciej Lewenstein, Erez Zohar, Paolo Stornati, Philipp Hauke
Abstract: Gauge-field configurations with nontrivial topology have profound consequences for the physics of Abelian and non-Abelian gauge theories. Over time, arguments have been gathering for the existence of gauge-field configurations with fractional topological charge, called fractons. Ground-state properties of gauge theories can drastically change in presence of fractons in the path integral. However, understanding the origin of such fractons is usually restricted to semiclassical argumentation. Here, we show that fractons persist in strongly correlated many-body systems, using the multiflavor Schwinger model of quantum electrodynamics as a paradigm example. Through detailed numerical tensor-network analysis, we find strong fracton signatures even in highly discretized lattice models, at sizes that are implementable on already existing quantum-simulation devices. Our work sheds light on how the nontrivial topology of gauge theories persists in challenging nonperturbative regimes, and it shows a path forward to probing it in tabletop experiments.

Title: Molecule Graph Networks with Many-body Equivariant Interactions
Authors: Zetian Mao, Chuan-Shen Hu, Jiawen Li, Chen Liang, Diptesh Das, Masato Sumita, Kelin Xia, Koji Tsuda
Abstract: Message passing neural networks have demonstrated significant efficacy in predicting molecular interactions. Introducing equivariant vectorial representations augments expressivity by capturing geometric data symmetries, thereby improving model accuracy. However, two-body bond vectors in opposition may cancel each other out during message passing, leading to the loss of directional information on their shared node. In this study, we develop Equivariant N-body Interaction Networks (ENINet) that explicitly integrates l = 1 equivariant many-body interactions to enhance directional symmetric information in the message passing scheme. We provided a mathematical analysis demonstrating the necessity of incorporating many-body equivariant interactions and generalized the formulation to $N$-body interactions. Experiments indicate that integrating many-body equivariant representations enhances prediction accuracy across diverse scalar and tensorial quantum chemical properties.

Title: Genuine quantum advantage in non-linear bosonic quantum batteries
Authors: Gian Marcello Andolina, Vittoria Stanzione, Vittorio Giovannetti, Marco Polini
Abstract: Finding a quantum battery model that displays a genuine quantum advantage, while being prone to experimental fabrication, is an extremely challenging task. In this Letter we propose a deceptively simple quantum battery model that displays a genuine quantum advantage, saturating the quantum speed limit. It consists of two harmonic oscillators (the charger and the battery), coupled during the non-equilibrium charging dynamics by a non-linear interaction. We first present the model, then certify the genuine quantum advantage, and finally briefly discuss how the battery can be fabricated through the use of superconducting circuits.

Title: Anyon Condensation in Virasoro TQFT: Wormhole Factorization
Authors: Shunta Takahashi
Abstract: Anyon condensation in wormhole geometries is investigated in the Virasoro TQFT (VTQFT) formulation, a proposed reformulation of 3d AdS quantum gravity. We first review some elementary techniques of VTQFT and summarize a gauging scheme for non-invertible symmetries referred to as anyon condensation. We then exhibit that anyon condensation is applicable to VTQFT even though the category of Wilson lines associated with it is not strictly a modular tensor category (MTC) due to the continuously infinite label $p\in\mathbb{R}_+$. More specifically, it is shown that the partition function of the wormhole factorizes upon condensing the so-called diagonal condensable anyon $\mathcal{A}=\int_{0}^{\infty}dp\,L_p\boxtimes\overline{L}_p$ in VTQFT. The resulting $2$d boundary theory is Liouville CFT by symmetry TFT construction, and to our knowledge, this is among the very few explicit computational examples of gauging \textit{continuous non-invertible} symmetries in the literature.

Title: Turning qubit noise into an advantage: Automatic state preparation and long-time dynamics for impurity models on quantum computers
Authors: Corentin Bertrand, Pauline Besserve, Michel Ferrero, Thomas Ayral
Abstract: Noise is often regarded as a limitation of quantum computers. In this work, we show that in the dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) approach to strongly-correlated systems, it can actually be harnessed to our advantage. Indeed, DMFT maps a lattice model onto an impurity model, namely a finite system coupled to a dissipative bath. While standard approaches require a large number of high-quality qubits in a unitary context, we propose a circuit that harvests amplitude damping to reproduce the dynamics of this model with a blend of noisy and noiseless qubits. We find compelling advantages with this approach: a substantial reduction in the number of qubits, the ability to reach longer time dynamics, and no need for ground state search and preparation. This method would naturally fit in a partial quantum error correction framework.

Title: Vectorial Symmetry Decoding with Single-Particle Precision via Room-Temperature Lanthanide Luminescence Polarimetry
Authors: Peng Li, Yaxin Guo, Yaoxu Yan, Bingzhu Zheng, Wenchao Zhang, Jingai Mu, Fu Liu, Yanpeng Zhang, Feng Yun, Rongqian Wu, Yi Lyu, Renren Deng, Feng Li
Abstract: Determining the local symmetry of luminescent centers in crystals is critical for understanding and controlling their optical transitions, yet current methods are limited by stringent experimental requirements and ambiguous symmetry assignments. Here, we develop a robust computational electromagnetics framework that directly connect the local symmetry and chirality of rare-earth-doped single crystals to the polarization states of their emitted light. This framework is experimentally validated through the precise determination of point and space group symmetries using high-resolution, polarization-resolved micro-photoluminescence ({\mu}-PL) spectra. Unlike conventional approaches that usually rely on analyzing multiple transitions at cryogenic temperatures, our technique operates at room temperature, requires only a single optical transition, and enables accurate orientation of symmetry axes. This enables deterministic polarization control of nano-emitters by tailoring symmetry groups and selecting appropriate transition dipoles, eliminating the need for bulky or complex photonic structures. Additionally, we demonstrate the function of bio-sensing, via determining single particle orientations in complex cellular environments using minimal polarization measurements. These results pave the way for advances in energy transfer systems, ultra-bright rare-earth nanocrystals, nanophotonic materials, and real-time single-particle tracking in biological contexts.

Title: Non-Stabilizerness of Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Model
Authors: Surajit Bera, Marco Schirò
Abstract: We study the non-stabilizerness or quantum magic of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev ($\rm SYK$) model, a prototype example of maximally chaotic quantum matter. We show that the Majorana spectrum of its ground state, encoding the spreading of the state in the Majorana basis, displays a Gaussian distribution as expected for chaotic quantum many-body systems. We compare our results with the case of the $\rm SYK_2$ model, describing non-chaotic random free fermions, and show that the Majorana spectrum is qualitatively different in the two cases, featuring an exponential Laplace distribution for the $\rm SYK_2$ model rather than a Gaussian. From the spectrum we extract the Stabilizer Renyi Entropy (SRE) and show that for both models it displays a linear scaling with system size, with a prefactor that is larger for the SYK model, which has therefore higher magic. Finally, we discuss the spreading of quantun magic under unitary dynamics, as described by the evolution of the Majorana spectrum and the Stabilizer Renyi Entropy starting from a stabilizer state. We show that the SRE for the $\rm SYK_2$ model equilibrates rapidly, but that in the steady-state the interacting chaotic SYK model has more magic than the simple $\rm SYK_2$. Our results suggest that the Majorana spectrum is qualitatively distinct in chaotic and non-chaotic many-body systems.

Title: Stabilizer Entropy and entanglement complexity in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model
Authors: Barbara Jasser, Jovan Odavic, Alioscia Hamma
Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model is of paramount importance for the understanding of both strange metals and a microscopic theory of two-dimensional gravity. We study the interplay between Stabilizer Rényi Entropy (SRE) and entanglement entropy in both the ground state and highly excited states of the SYK4+SYK2 model interpolating the highly chaotic four-body interactions model with the integrable two-body interactions one. The interplay between these quantities is assessed also through universal statistics of the entanglement spectrum and its anti-flatness. We find that SYK4 is indeed characterized by a complex pattern of both entanglement and non-stabilizer resources while SYK2 is non-universal and not complex. We discuss the fragility and robustness of these features depending on the interpolation parameter.

Title: Synaptic Field Theory for Neural Networks
Authors: Donghee Lee, Hye-Sung Lee, Jaeok Yi
Abstract: Theoretical understanding of deep learning remains elusive despite its empirical success. In this study, we propose a novel "synaptic field theory" that describes the training dynamics of synaptic weights and biases in the continuum limit. Unlike previous approaches, our framework treats synaptic weights and biases as fields and interprets their indices as spatial coordinates, with the training data acting as external sources. This perspective offers new insights into the fundamental mechanisms of deep learning and suggests a pathway for leveraging well-established field-theoretic techniques to study neural network training.

Authors: Takanori Ishii, Daichi Takeda
Abstract: We develop, in the AdS/CFT correspondence, a method to compute correlation functions when the CFT is governed by the Lindblad equation for open quantum systems, via the AdS theory. Using a simple example in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, we demonstrate that the predictions of the AdS theory based on our method match the direct computations in the dual CFT. We also briefly discuss the relaxation problem and the holographic entropy in this example.

Title: Plasmonic Nanoparticle-in-nanoslit Antenna as Independently Tunable Dual-Resonant Systems for Efficient Frequency Upconversion
Authors: Huatian Hu, Zhiwei Hu, Christophe Galland, Wen Chen
Abstract: Dual-band plasmonic nanoantennas, exhibiting two widely separated user-defined resonances, are fundamental building blocks for the investigation and optimization of plasmon-enhanced optical phenomena, including photoluminescence, Raman scattering, and various nonlinear effects such as harmonic generation or sum-frequency generation, parametric down-conversion, etc. The nanoparticle-on-slit (NPoS) or nanoparticle-in-groove (NPiG) is a recently proposed dual-band antenna with independently tunable resonances at mid-infrared and visible wavelengths. It was used to enhance the corresponding sum- and difference-frequency generation processes from optimally located molecules by an estimated $10^{13}$-fold. However, the theoretical understanding of such structures and their eigenmodes remains poor, hindering further optimization and limiting broader applications. Here, we explore a diverse range of nanocavity-like quasi-normal modes (QNMs) supported by NPoS structures, examining the contributions of both their near-field (i.e., giant photonic density of states) and far-field (i.e., spatial radiation patterns) characteristics to frequency upconversion. We identify methods for independently tuning the visible and mid-infrared resonances while conserving a good mode overlap in the near field, which is essential for efficient nonlinear processes. Moreover, through mode analysis, we unveil an experimentally unexplored fundamental resonance with greater field enhancement and much-improved mode overlap with the mid-infrared field, which could, in principle, further boost the mid-infrared upconversion efficiency by 5-fold compared to existing results. This work helps to rationalize and optimize the enhancement of nonlinear effects across a wide spectral range using a flexible and experimentally attractive nanoplasmonic platform.

Title: Cryogenic Microwave Whispering Gallery Mode Spectroscopy of Paramagnetic Impurities in High-Purity Crystalline LiF
Authors: Steven Samuels, William Campbell, Michael E. Tobar, Maxim Goryachev
Abstract: A low-noise cryogenic microwave spectroscopy experiment was performed on a high-purity lithium fluoride (LiF) crystal. The spectroscopy data revealed avoided level crossing interactions in whispering gallery modes, indicative of electron spin resonance (ESR) coupling with paramagnetic impurities. Analysis of the interaction spectra identified distinct spin systems corresponding to $(S = 3/2, I = 7/2)$, $(S = 1, I = 7/2)$, and $(S = 3/2, I = 0)$. The number of hyperfine splittings observed, together with the natural abundance of ions possessing the appropriate nuclear spin values, suggest that V$^{2+}$ and V$^{3+}$ impurities, exhibiting orthorhombic distortion, are the most likely sources of the narrow interaction features. This interpretation is supported by earlier ESR studies and established manufacturing records for LiF crystal growth. Additionally, a separate set of broader interaction points is consistent with an orthorhombic model involving a $(S = 3/2, I = 0)$ spin system, although the specific impurity responsible for this interaction remains unidentified.

Title: Two-dimensional Parallel Tempering for Constrained Optimization
Authors: Corentin Delacour, M Mahmudul Hasan Sajeeb, Joao P. Hespanha, Kerem Y. Camsari
Abstract: Sampling Boltzmann probability distributions plays a key role in machine learning and optimization, motivating the design of hardware accelerators such as Ising machines. While the Ising model can in principle encode arbitrary optimization problems, practical implementations are often hindered by soft constraints that either slow down mixing when too strong, or fail to enforce feasibility when too weak. We introduce a two-dimensional extension of the powerful parallel tempering algorithm (PT) that addresses this challenge by adding a second dimension of replicas interpolating the penalty strengths. This scheme ensures constraint satisfaction in the final replicas, analogous to low-energy states at low temperature. The resulting two-dimensional parallel tempering algorithm (2D-PT) improves mixing in heavily constrained replicas and eliminates the need to explicitly tune the penalty strength. In a representative example of graph sparsification with copy constraints, 2D-PT achieves near-ideal mixing, with Kullback-Leibler divergence decaying as O(1/t). When applied to sparsified Wishart instances, 2D-PT yields orders of magnitude speedup over conventional PT with the same number of replicas. The method applies broadly to constrained Ising problems and can be deployed on existing Ising machines.

Title: Polarized Houston State Framework for Nonequilibrium Driven Open Quantum Systems
Authors: Shunsuke A. Sato, Hannes Hübener, Umberto De Giovannini, Angel Rubio
Abstract: We introduce a new theoretical framework -- the polarized Houston basis -- to model nonequilibrium dynamics in driven open quantum systems, formulated for use within the quantum master equation. This basis extends conventional Houston states by incorporating field-induced polarization effects, enabling a more accurate description of excitation dynamics under external driving. Using a one-dimensional dimer-chain model, we examine band population dynamics through projections onto polarized Houston states, original Houston states, and naive Bloch states. We find that the polarized Houston basis significantly suppresses spurious Bloch-state excitations and virtual transitions present in standard Houston approaches, allowing for a cleaner extraction of real excitations. When implemented in the relaxation time approximation of the quantum master equation, this formalism also yields a substantial reduction of unphysical DC currents in insulating systems. Our results highlight the polarized Houston basis as a powerful tool for simulating nonequilibrium phenomena in light-driven open quantum materials.

Title: On buoyancy in disperse two-phase flow and its impact on well-posedness of two-fluid models
Authors: Rui Zhu, Yulan Chen, Katharina Tholen, Zhiguo He, Thomas Pähtz
Abstract: Maxey & Riley's (Phys. Fluids, vol. 26, 1983, 883) analytical solution for the flow around a small sphere at low particle Reynolds number tells us that the fluid-particle interaction force decomposes into a contribution from the local flow disturbance caused by the particle's boundary -- consisting of the drag, Faxen, virtual-mass, and history forces -- and another contribution from the stress of the background flow, termed generalized-buoyancy force. There is also a consensus that, for general disperse two-phase flow, the interfacial force density, resulting from averaging the fluid's and particles' equations of motion, decomposes in a likewise manner. However, there has been a long-standing controversy about the physical closure separating the generalized-buoyancy from the interfacial force density, especially whether or not pseudo-stresses, such as the Reynolds stress, should be attributed to the background flow. Furthermore, most existing propositions for this closure involve small-particle approximations. Here, we show that all existing buoyancy closures are mathematically inconsistent with at least one of three simple thought experiments designed to determine the roles of pseudo-stresses and small-particle approximations. We then derive the unique closure consistent with these thought experiments. It fully incorporates all pseudo-stresses, requires no approximation, and is supported by particle-resolved numerical simulations. Remarkably, it exhibits a low-pass filter property, attenuating buoyancy at short wavelengths, that prevents it from causing Hadamard instabilities, constituting a first-principle-based solution to the long-standing ill-posedness problem of two-fluid models. When employing the derived closure, even very simplistic two-fluid models are hyperbolic.
