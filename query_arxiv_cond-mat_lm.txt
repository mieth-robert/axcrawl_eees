Title: Exceptional Topology on Nonorientable Manifolds
Authors: J. Lukas K. König, Kang Yang, André Grossi Fonseca, Sachin Vaidya, Marin Soljačić, Emil J. Bergholtz
Abstract: We classify gapped and gapless phases of non-Hermitian band structures on two-dimensional nonorientable parameter spaces. Such spaces arise in a wide range of physical systems in the presence of non-symmorphic parameter space symmetries. For gapped phases, we find that nonorientable spaces provide a natural setting for exploring fundamental structural problems in braid group theory, such as torsion and conjugacy. Gapless phases, which host exceptional points (EPs), explicitly violate the fermion doubling theorem, even in two-band models. We demonstrate that EPs traversing the nonorientable parameter space exhibit non-Abelian charge inversion. These braided phases and their transitions leave distinct signatures in the form of bulk Fermi arc degeneracies, offering a concrete route toward experimental realization and verification.

Title: Beyond-mean-field phases of rotating dipolar condensates
Authors: Paolo Molignini
Abstract: Rotating dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates exhibit rich physics due to the interplay of long-range interactions and rotation, leading to unconventional vortex structures and strongly correlated phases. While most studies rely on mean-field approaches, these fail to capture quantum correlations that become significant at high rotation speeds and strong interactions. In this study, we go beyond the mean-field description by employing a numerically exact multiconfigurational approach to study finite-sized dipolar condensates. We reveal novel vortex structures, rotating cluster states, and strong fragmentation effects, demonstrating that beyond-mean-field correlations remain prominent even in larger systems. By quantifying deviations from mean-field theory, we provide a predictive framework for analyzing experiments and exploring emergent quantum phases, with implications for both the fundamental theory of ultracold gases and the quantum simulation of correlated superfluid systems like in neutron stars.

Title: Multipolar Fermi Surface Deformations in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ Probed by Resistivity and Sound Attenuation: A Window into Electron Viscosity and the Collision Operator
Authors: Davis Thuillier, Sayak Ghosh, B. J. Ramshaw, Thomas Scaffidi
Abstract: Recent developments in electron hydrodynamics have demonstrated the importance of considering the full structure of the electron-electron scattering operator, which encodes a sequence of lifetimes, one for each component of the Fermi surface deformation in a multipolar expansion. In this context, the dipolar lifetime is measured by resistivity, whereas the quadrupolar component probes the viscosity and can be measured in the bulk via sound attenuation. We introduce a framework to extract the collision operator of an arbitrary metal by combining resistivity and sound attenuation measurements with a realistic calculation of the scattering operator that includes multiband and Umklapp effects. The collision operator allows for the prediction of a plethora of properties, including the non-local conductivity, and can be used to predict hydrodynamic behavior for bulk metals. As a first application, we apply this framework to Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ in a temperature range where electron-electron scattering is dominant. We find quantitative agreement between our model and the temperature dependence of both the resistivity and the sound attenuation, we extract the ratio of the quadrupolar (B1g) to dipolar relaxation rate to be 1.3, and we predict a strongly anisotropic non-local conductivity arising from the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ bands.

Title: Relativistic Mott transitions, quantum criticality, and finite-temperature effects in tunable Dirac materials from functional renormalization
Authors: Mireia Tolosa-Simeón, Laura Classen, Michael M. Scherer
Abstract: Gross-Neveu-Yukawa-type models such as the chiral Ising, chiral XY, and chiral Heisenberg models, serve as effective descriptions of two-dimensional Dirac semi-metals undergoing quantum phase transitions into various symmetry-broken ordered states. Their relativistic quantum critical points govern the systems' physical behavior in the vicinity of the transition also at finite temperatures, which is strongly influenced by critical order-parameter and chiral fermion fluctuations. Here, we explore the effect of these fluctuations at zero and finite temperature, both in the Dirac phase and in the Mott phases with spontaneously broken symmetry. To that end, we set up a functional renormalization group approach, which allows us to systematically calculate the quantum phase diagrams and scaling behavior at and near quantum criticality. We explicitly estimate quantum critical exponents, calculate the quasiparticle weight of the chiral Dirac excitations, and determine the extent of the quantum critical fan. Furthermore, we expose a semi-metallic precondensation regime where order-parameter fluctuations destroy order at finite temperature and we show the related manifestation of the Coleman-Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner theorem. For the chiral XY model, we also expose signatures of Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless physics in a system that includes strong fermion fluctuations. In view of recent experimental developments on correlated phases in highly tunable two-dimensional Dirac materials, our work aims at a more comprehensive theoretical description of relativistic quantum criticality in semi-metals, including non-Dirac-liquid behavior.

Title: Lateral Exchange Bias for Néel-Vector Control in Atomically Thin Antiferromagnets
Authors: Clément Pellet-Mary, Debarghya Dutta, Märta A. Tschudin, Patrick Siegwolf, Boris Gross, David A. Broadway, Jordan Cox, Carolin Schrader, Jodok Happacher, Daniel G. Chica, Cory R. Dean, Xavier Roy, Patrick Maletinsky
Abstract: Atomically thin van der Waals (vdW) magnets have emerged as a fascinating platform for the exploration of novel physical phenomena arising from their reduced dimensionality and exceptional material properties. Their single-crystalline nature and ultimate miniaturization position them as leading candidates for next-generation spintronic applications. Antiferromagnetic (AF) vdW magnets are of particular interest, as they combine the advantages of vdW magnets with the functionality of AF spintronics, offering unique opportunities for ultrafast and robust spintronic devices. However, the lack of approaches to locally and deterministically manipulate their order parameter -- the Néel-vector -- remains a key limitation. Here, we introduce a fundamentally new paradigm in nanomagnetism, which we term lateral exchange bias (LEB), to achieve Néel vector control in bilayers of the vdW AF CrSBr. We exploit the single-crystalline registry formed by terraced CrSBr samples, where the bilayer Néel vector is controlled by LEB from neighboring, odd-layered flakes, whose nonzero magnetization we manipulate using magnetic fields. Using this control, we achieve nonvolatile manipulation of magnetic domains and domain walls (DWs) in AF CrSBr bilayers, establishing a powerful toolkit for controlling atomically thin AFs at the nanoscale. Our results challenge conventional views on exchange bias and provide a previously unexplored mechanism for achieving atomic-scale control of AFic order. Our findings pave the way for the development of advanced spintronic architectures and quantum technologies based on vdW magnets.

Title: Revealing Quantum Geometry in Nonlinear Quantum Materials
Authors: Yiyang Jiang, Tobias Holder, Binghai Yan
Abstract: Berry curvature-related topological phenomena have been a central topic in condensed matter physics. Yet, until recently other quantum geometric quantities such as the metric and connection received only little attention due to the relatively few effects which have been documented for them. This review gives a modern perspective how quantum geometric quantities naturally enter the nonlinear responses of quantum materials and demonstrate their deep connection with excitation energy, lifetimes, symmetry, and corresponding physical processes. The multitude of nonlinear responses can be subdivided into nonlinear optical effects, subgap responses, and nonlinear transport phenomena. Such a distinction by energy scales facilitates an intuitive understanding of the underlying electronic transitions, giving rise to a unified picture of the electron motion beyond linear order. The well-known injection and shift currents constitute the main resonances in the optical regime. Exploiting their respective lifetime and symmetry dependencies, this review elucidates how these resonances can be distinguished by a corresponding quantum geometric quantity that shares the same symmetry. This is followed by a brief exposition of the role of quasiparticle lifetimes for nonlinear subgap responses, which presents a window into the microscopic short-term dynamics as well as the ground state correlation and localization. We conclude with an account of the anomalous motion due to the Berry curvature dipole and quantum metric dipole in nonlinear transport, clarifying the correspondence between physical observables and the underlying mechanisms. This review highlights the close relationship between quantum geometry and nonlinear response, showing the way towards promising probes of quantum geometry and enabling novel avenues to characterize complex materials.

Title: Red Emission from Strain-Relaxed Bulk InGaN Active Region
Authors: Zuojian Pan, Zhizhong Chen, Haodong Zhang, Chuhan Deng, Ling Hu, Fei Huang, Qi Wang, Guoyi Zhang, Xiaohang Li, Bo Shen
Abstract: High-In-content InGaN quantum wells (QWs) in red light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are typically grown at low temperatures to ensure effective In incorporation. In this study, red LEDs based on bulk InGaN active region were demonstrated. The growth temperature of bulk InGaN was ~800C, which is over 100C higher than the typical growth temperature of red QWs. By introducing high-density trench structures in the underlying green multi-quantum wells (MQWs), the compressive strain in bulk InGaN was relaxed by ~96%. With strain relaxation, phase separation occurred in the bulk InGaN, forming low-In-content (blue) and high-In-content (red) phases. The red phase acted as carrier localization centers, enabling red light emission under electrical injection. The red LEDs based on bulk InGaN exhibited a peak wavelength of 645 nm at 20 mA, with on-wafer peak external quantum efficiency of 0.32%. This study presents a new epitaxial strategy for red InGaN LEDs.

Title: Unified model of the Hall effect from insulator to overdoped compounds in cuprate superconductors
Authors: Júlia C. Anjos, Hércules S. Santana, E. V. L. de Mello
Abstract: Measurements of the Hall coefficient in La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$, ranging from the undoped ($x = p = 0$) Mott insulator to overdoped compounds, exhibit a temperature dependence that offers insights into their electronic structure. We interpret these results using a model based on the theory of phase-separation (PS) dynamics, which begins at half-filled ($n = 1$) and at a temperature $T_{\rm PS}(p)$, near the pseudogap temperature $T^*(p)$. The $n = 1$ holes have low mobility and provide the modulations of the charge density waves (CDW). As doping increases from $p = 0$, these modulations guide the additional p holes to occupy alternating CDW domains. This charge inhomogeneity may facilitate the formation of localized superconducting amplitudes below the critical onset temperature $T_{\rm c}^{\rm max}(p)$. Using thermal activation expressions, along with quantum tunnelling between the charge domains, we successfully reproduce all Hall coefficient measurements $R_{\rm H}(p,T)$ and highlight the relevant energies of cuprates. The calculations confirm three significant electronic features: the phase-separating role of the pseudogap temperature, the superconducting state achieved through phase coherence, and the two types of charge carriers whose energies and mobilities become comparable at $p \approx 0.19$, where $T^*(p) \approx T_{\rm c}^{\rm max}(p)$. This results in a crossover from $n = p$ to $n = 1 + p$. These findings, along with the $R_{\rm H}(p,T)$ calculations from insulating to overdoped compounds, underscore the critical role of the electronic phase separation in the properties of cuprates.

Title: Intrinsic Spin Transport in a Topological Insulator Thin Film
Authors: Sharadh Jois, Gregory M. Stephen, Nick Blumenschein, Patrick J. Taylor, Aubrey T. Hanbicki, Adam L. Friedman
Abstract: Topological insulators (TIs) are intriguing materials for advanced computing applications based on spintronics because they can host robust spin effects. For instance, TIs have intrinsically large spin generation enabled by their large spin-orbit coupling. Furthermore, topological surface states (TSS) with spin-momentum locking and Dirac dispersion lead to long spin diffusion. Future spintronic device technology will require scalable film growth of high-quality material. We grow epitaxial films of Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$Te$_{3-y}$Se$_y$ (BSTS, $x = 0.58, y = 1$) and confirm the gapless band structure with optimal doping using angle-resolved photoelectron spectra. The temperature dependence of longitudinal resistivity shows bulk transport is suppressed as temperature is decreased, and at low temperature surface transport dominates. We evaluate the spin transport properties in BSTS without using ferromagnetic tunnel contacts via a non-local resistance experiment as a function of temperature and applied charge current. As expected, these experiments reveal the necessity of decreasing the bulk conduction to best enhance the spin transport. In the TSS, we find high efficiency of charge-to-spin conversion (spin Hall angle, $\theta_{SH} \approx 1$) and spin diffusion over several microns. Further development of high-quality TIs will make them viable candidates for efficient and lossless this http URL of high-quality TIs will make them viable candidates for efficient and lossless spintronics.

Title: Giant mobility of surface-trapped ionic charges following liquid tribocharging
Authors: Zouhir Benrahla, Tristan Saide, Louis Burnaz, Emilie Verneuil, Simon Gravelle, Jean Comtet
Abstract: The sliding motion of aqueous droplets on hydrophobic surfaces leads to charge separation at the trailing edge, with implications from triple-line friction to hydrovoltaic energy generation. Charges deposited on the solid surface have been attributed to stem from ions or electrons ripped off from the liquid drop. However, the dynamics and exact physicochemical nature of these surface-trapped charges remains poorly explored. Here, we take advantage of a scanning-based electrostatic mapping technique, to directly quantify the spatiotemporal dynamics of surface deposited charges in the wake of droplets sliding on hydrophobic surfaces. We confirm the ionic nature of these interfacially trapped charges, and evidence that they undergo very fast bidimensional diffusive transport, gliding with low friction at the solid/gas interface. We rationalize our observations through molecular dynamics simulation of hydrated ions adsorbed on solid surfaces, revealing a peculiar transport mechanism limited by purely interfacial friction of the ionic solvation shell with the solid surface. By uncovering the unexpected dynamics of these ionic puddles - a new state of interfacial ionic matter - our findings have general implications for molecular-scale ionic transport and electrified matter at interfaces.

Title: Magnetic Phase Transitions and Mixed Spin in Double Perovskite $Sr_{2}FeMoO_{6}$
Authors: Said Khaireddine, Redouane Assad, Mohammed El Falaki, Rachid Ahl Lamara, Lalla Btissam Drissi
Abstract: The magnetic properties of the double perovskite oxide $Sr_{2}$FeMo$O_{6}$ are analyzed using a mixed-spin Ising model with spins $\left( \frac{1}{2},\frac{5}{2}\right) $ in the presence of a random crystal field $\Delta$ and exchange interactions $ J $ on a three-dimensional (3D) cubic lattice. The study employs both the Mean-Field Approximation (MFA) based on the Bogoliubov inequality for Gibbs free energy and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations using the Metropolis algorithm to provide a comprehensive analysis of the system's phase transitions and magnetization behavior, with focusing on the role of Fe and Mo sublattices. We establish the ground-state phase diagram, identifying multiple stable magnetic configurations and first-order transitions at low temperatures. Indicate compensation temperature $T_{comp}$. This work provides deeper insight into the thermodynamic, physics statistic and magnetic properties of $Sr_{2}$FeMo$O_{6}$, with implications for future applications in spintronics and magnetic storage technologies.

Title: A full breakthrough in vacuum ultraviolet nonlinear optical performance of NH4B4O6F
Authors: Fangfang Zhang, Zilong Chen, Chen Cui, Zhihua Yang, Miriding Mutailipu, Fuming Li, Xueling Hou, Xifa Long, Shilie Pan
Abstract: The lack of suitable vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals has hindered the development of compact, high-power VUV sources via second harmonic generation (SHG). Here, we report on the development of the fluorooxoborate crystal NH4B4O6F (ABF) as a promising material for VUV light generation. For the first time, devices with specific phase-matching angles were constructed, achieving a record 158.9 nm VUV light through phase-matching SHG and a maximum nanosecond pulse energy of 4.8 mJ at 177.3 nm with a conversion efficiency of 5.9 %. The enhanced NLO performance is attributed to optimized arrangements of fluorine-based units creating asymmetric sublattices. This work marks a significant milestone in the field of NLO materials, facilitating the future applications of compact, high-power VUV lasers utilizing ABF.

Title: The singlet-triplet and exchange-only flopping-mode spin qubits
Authors: Simon Stastny, Guido Burkard
Abstract: Semiconductor-based spin qubits embedded into a superconducting microwave cavity constitute a fast-progressing and promising platform for realizing fast and fault-tolerant qubit control with long-range two-qubit coupling. The flopping-mode spin qubit consists of a single electron in a double quantum dot; it combines a charge qubit with a spin qubit. With its strong and tunable cavity coupling, the flopping-mode qubit is proven to be well-suited for low-power qubit control and cavity-mediated long-range quantum gates. The singlet-triplet (ST) and exchange-only (EO) qubits are multi-electron realizations that go without broadband control and are protected from some types of noise, but are challenging to couple to each other and to microwave cavities. We combine the flopping-mode concept with the ST and EO qubits and propose two new flopping-mode qubits that consist of three (four) quantum dots, occupied by two (three) electrons near the (1,0,1) - (0,1,1) [(1,0,1,1) -- (0,1,1,1)] charge transition. The two-electron system augments the $ST_0$ spin qubit with a charge qubit that interacts transversally and longitudinally with a cavity. Both couplings are highly tunable, and the longitudinal coupling distinguishes the flopping-mode ST qubit from the regular flopping-mode qubit. The longitudinal coupling allows for non-dissipative universal control similar to superconducting transmon qubits. The EO flopping-mode qubit comprises four dots occupied by three electrons and opens a new possibility to perform two-qubit gates for EO qubits that are challenging to perform directly with the exchange coupling. We use input-output theory to provide means of extracting the coupling strengths from cavity transmission data.

Title: Effects of Ru-doping on the magnetism of Ag3LiIr2O6, a candidate Kitaev quantum spin liquid
Authors: Sanjay Bachhar, M. Baenitz, John Wilkinson, A.V. Mahajan
Abstract: We report our investigations on Ag3LiIr1.4Ru0.6O6, which results from the Ru substitution in the Kitaev quantum spin liquid candidate Ag3LiIr2O6. It crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/m space group like its parent compound, Ag3LiIr2O6. Our susceptibility measurements reveal an effective moment = 2.6 muB, which is higher than the moments of the parent compound and less than that of the Ru-analog (Ag3LiRu2O6), suggesting the presence of magnetic Ir4+ (Jeff= 1/2) and Ru4+ (S=1). Bulk magnetic susceptibility suggests long-range order (LRO)at T~20 K, whereas no clear signature is present in the heat capacity. Likewise, there is a loss of the 7Li NMR spectral intensity around T~20 K as expected at the onset of LRO, but a complete wipe-out is not seen in contrast to the result in Ag3LiIr2O6. There is also a T~20 K anomaly in the 7Li NMR relaxation rate and also a fall in the 7Li NMR shift with decreasing temperature. These results suggest LRO at T~20 K in Ag3LiIr1.4Ru0.6O6. However, at low-T below 10 K, we observe a power law variation in magnetic heat capacity and spin lattice relaxation rate, temperature-independent-7K, and no further loss of the 7Li NMR spectral intensity. These results might suggest the persistence or stabilisation of a quantum spin liquid-like phase, perhaps from a fraction of the sample in Ag3LiIr1.4Ru0.6O6 below 10 K. Our muon spin relaxation measurements suggest ordering around 20 K, consistent with our other probes. It appears that the main effect of Ru-substitution is to shift the LRO to a higher temperature in comparison with Ag3LiIr2O6, though there are signatures of a novel phase below about 10 K.

Title: Multi-phase-field Models of Biological Tissues
Authors: Siavash Monfared, Aleksandra Ardaševa, Amin Doostmohammadi
Abstract: The development of complex multicellular organisms from a single parent cell is a highly orchestrated process that cells conduct collectively without central guidance, creating intricate dynamic patterns essential for development and regeneration. Despite significant advances in imaging spatiotemporal dynamics of cell collectives and mechanical characterization techniques, the role of physical forces in biological functions remains poorly understood. Physics-based models are crucial in complementing experiments, providing high-resolution spatiotemporal fields in three dimensions. This review focuses on dense, soft multicellular systems, such as tissues, where mechanical deformation of one cell necessitates the re-organization of neighboring cells. The multi-phase-field model offers a rich physics-based framework to advance our understanding of biological systems and provides a robust playground for non-equilibrium physics of active matter. We discuss the foundational aspects of the multi-phase-field model and their applications in understanding physics of active matter. We also explore the integration of biological physics with experimental data, covering cell migration, heterogeneous cell populations, and confined systems. Finally, we highlight current trends, the importance of multi-phase-field models in biological and physics research, and future challenges.

Title: Electronic Structure, Magnetic and Pairing Tendencies of Alternating Single-layer Bilayer Stacking Nickelate La$_5$Ni$_3$O$_{11}$ Under Pressure
Authors: Yang Zhang, Ling-Fang Lin, Adriana Moreo, Satoshi Okamoto, Thomas A. Maier, Elbio Dagotto
Abstract: Nickelates have continued to surprise since their unconventional superconductivity was discovered. Recently, the layered nickelate La$_5$Ni$_3$O$_{11}$ with hybrid single-layer and bilayer stacking showed superconductivity under high pressure. This compound combines features of La$_2$NiO$_4$ and La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, but its pairing mechanism remains to be understood. Motivated by this finding, here we report a comprehensive theoretical study of this system. Our density functional theory calculations reveal that the undistorted P4/mmm phase without pressure is unstable due to three distortion modes. Increasing pressure suppresses these modes and causes ``charge transfer'' between the single-layer and bilayer sublattices, leading to hole-doping in the single-layer blocks. Our random-phase approximation calculations indicate a leading $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave pairing state that arises from spin-fluctuation scattering between Fermi surface states mainly originating from the single-layer blocks and additional weaker contributions from the bilayer blocks. These spin-fluctuations could be detected by inelastic neutron scattering as a strong peak at ${\bf q}=(\pi, \pi)$. Our findings distinguish La$_5$Ni$_3$O$_{11}$ from other nickelate superconductors discovered so far and the high-$T_c$ cuprates. We also discuss both similarities and differences between La$_5$Ni$_3$O$_{11}$ and other hybrid stacking nickelates.

Title: Thermal boundary conductance in standalone and non-standalone GaN/AlN heterostructures predicted using machine learning interatomic potentials
Authors: Hao Zhou, Khalid Zobaid Adnan, Wyatt Allen Jones, Tianli Feng
Abstract: GaN/AlN interfaces are essential in advanced high-power and high-frequency electronic devices, where effective thermal management is crucial for optimal performance and reliability. This work investigates the thermal boundary conductance (TBC) of standalone and non-standalone GaN/AlN heterostructures using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) driven by accurate machine learning interatomic potentials trained from density-functional theory calculations. For the standalone interface, the TBC is found to be ~600 MW m-2 K-1 at room temperature after quantum correction, with possible ~60% elastic and ~40% inelastic contributions. The result revises previous NEMD predictions (400 - 2000 MW m-2 K-1) using empirical interatomic potentials. When a second GaN/AlN interface is brought close to the original interface, the TBC of the original interface can increase to 1000 MW m-2 K-1, and this value gradually decreases with increasing distance between the two interfaces. When multiple interfaces are introduced in proximity, the first interface's TBC can be further enhanced to above 1150 MW m-2 K-1. After comparing double interfaces, superlattices, and random multilayers, it is concluded that such enhancement of TBC is not caused by the emergence of coherent superlattice modes but rather by the ballistic transport of the original bulk phonon modes of each material. Additionally, a "critical separation distance" (l_cs) is defined as the threshold beyond which the two interfaces no longer influence each other and behave independently. l_cs is determined by the mean free path of the phonons that traverse the interfaces and transport in the middle layer between two interfaces. Our findings provide insights into the thermal transport mechanisms that may aid the design of future electronic devices.

Title: Applied-field magnetic structure and spectroscopy shifts of the effective spin-$\frac{1}{2}$, $XY$-like magnet Li$_2$CoCl$_4$
Authors: Zachary W. Riedel, Mykhaylo Ozerov, Stuart Calder, Daniel P. Shoemaker
Abstract: Insulators containing chains of magnetic transition metal cations provide platforms for probing spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ dynamics and quantum critical behavior. Li$_2$CoCl$_4$ contains edge-sharing CoCl$_6$ octahedra that form chains along the crystallographic $c$ axis and orders antiferromagnetically at zero field, but questions remain about its applied-field magnetic structure and the Co$^{2+}$ spin state. Here, we show with neutron diffraction on a polycrystalline sample how the anti-aligned chains of cobalt moments undergo a spin-flop transition to a field-aligned ferromagnetic state above 1.6~T. Further, using magnetic resonance absorption measurements and paramagnetic spin models, we reveal the strongly anisotropic nature of the Co$^{2+}$ ion's $XY$-like magnetic behavior ($g_{\parallel}=2.77$ and $g_{\perp}=5.23$) and its $J=\frac{1}{2}$ ground state. We, therefore, supply the magnetic structures and anisotropic description needed to explore the dynamics of the field-driven magnetic phases, laying the foundation for further experimental and theoretical studies.

Abstract: Size selection of liquid-dispersed 2D nanomaterials is a prerequisite for size-dependent studies in earlier stage research and for their targeted application in commercial settings. Centrifugation is the most widespread method for reliably sorting suspensions of polydisperse 2D nanosheets according to size. However, whilst centrifugation is effective, no a priori models are available to predict the outcome of centrifugation, making time consuming iterative experiments necessary. Here we present a simple model for the behaviour of 2D nanosheets during centrifugation and benchmark its predictions against experiments. This model uses simple expressions, specific to 2D particles, for the hydrodynamic radius, effective density and viscous resistance to generate the equation of motion of individual nanosheet during centrifugation. Critically, the equation of motion is then used to predict nanosheet size distributions within centrifugation products. This in turn leads to equations for easily measurable properties such as mean and maximum nanosheet sizes obtained during centrifugation-based fractionation. Comparison with experimental data demonstrates the robustness of this model for a range of 2D materials and solvent systems, and its ability to describe quite subtle effects. These results will enable more tailored size selection of nanosheets for specific applications and offer new mechanistic insights to optimise exfoliation conditions.

Title: Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry analysis of the formation of superconducting V\(_3\)Si thin films
Authors: Fshatsion B. Gessesew (1), Manjith Bose (1), Kumaravelu Ganesan (1), Brett C. Johnson (2), Jeffrey C. McCallum (1) ((1) School of Physics, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia, (2) School of Science, RMIT University, Melbourne, Australia)
Abstract: Vanadium silicide, V\(_3\)Si, is a promising superconductor for silicon-based superconducting (SC) devices due to its compatibility with silicon substrates and its potential for integration into existing semiconductor technologies. However, to date there have been only a limited number of studies of the formation of SC V\(_3\)Si thin films and the associated structural and superconducting properties. This work aims to explore the structural characteristics and SC properties of V\(_3\)Si films, paving the way for the development of functional SC devices for quantum technology applications. We have investigated the formation of V\(_3\)Si films by directly depositing vanadium (V) onto thermally grown SiO\(_2\) on Si, followed by high-vacuum annealing to induce the phase transformation into V\(_3\)Si. Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry(RBS) was employed throughout the sample growth process to analyze the material composition as a function of depth using a 4He+ ion beam. Analysis of the RBS data confirmed that the V layer fully reacted with the SiO\(_2\) substrate to form V\(_3\)Si at the interface, in addition to a vanadium oxide (VO\(_x\)) layer forming atop the V\(_3\)Si film. The thickness of the V\(_3\)Si layer ranges from 63 to 130 nm, with annealing temperatures between 750\(^{\circ}\)C and 800\(^{\circ}\)C. A sharp SC transition was observed at T\(_c\) = 13 K in the sample annealed at 750°C, with a narrow transition width (\(\Delta T_c\)) of 0.6 K. Initial reactive ion etching (RIE) studies yielded promising results for local removal of the VO\(_x\) to facilitate electrical contact formation to the SC layer.

Title: Collective Dynamics and Topological Locking in Knotted Ring Polymers: A Novel Phenomenological Theory
Authors: Anna Lappala
Abstract: We present a novel phenomenological theory describing how topological constraints in prime-knot ring polymers induce collective (cooperative) modes of motion. In low-complexity knots, chain segments can move quasi-independently. However, as the crossing number increases, the ring's degrees of freedom become collectively coupled: distinct arc segments must move in coordinated, out-of-phase patterns to preserve the knot. We formulate this using an arc-based model in which each crossing imposes constraints that generate a coupling matrix among subchain displacements. We show how strong couplings emerge at higher knot complexity, eventually leading to topologically driven dynamical arrest. We demonstrate that torus and twist knots belong to distinct universality classes of topologically driven dynamical arrest: torus knots exhibit a gradual, stretched-exponential slowdown, while twist knots undergo a sharp, jamming-like transition. These findings establish a topological control parameter for relaxation dynamics, independent of steric effects or bending rigidity. Our results offer a unified framework connecting number of conformations, cooperative motion, and final arrested states, thus extending our fundamental understanding of entanglement in soft matter systems.

Title: Nonequilibrium electron distribution function in a voltage-biased metal wire: A nonequilibrium Green's function approach
Authors: Taira Kawamura, Yusuke Kato
Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework to determine distribution functions in nonequilibrium systems coupled to equilibrium reservoirs, by using the nonequilibrium Green's function technique. As a paradigmatic example, we consider the nonequilibrium distribution function in a metal wire under a bias voltage. We model the system as a tight-binding chain connected to reservoirs with different electrochemical potentials at both ends. For electron scattering processes in the wire, we consider both elastic scattering from impurities and inelastic scattering from phonons within the self-consistent Born approximation. We demonstrate that the nonequilibrium distribution functions, as well as the electrostatic potential profiles, in various scattering regimes are well described within our framework. This scheme will contribute to advancing our understanding of quantum many-body phenomena driven by nonequilibrium distribution functions that have different functional forms from the equilibrium ones.

Title: Crystallization of the transdimensional electron liquid
Authors: Igor V. Bondarev, Alexandra Boltasseva, Jacob B. Khurgin, Vladimir M. Shalaev
Abstract: By calculating the critical densities, temperatures and phase diagrams, we show that metallic transdimensional materials are unique in that by simply reducing their thickness one can Wigner crystallize their free electrons at room temperature. When it occurs, the electrons get pinned on a two-dimensional periodic triangular lattice to form an electron super-solid (electron solid inside of a crystalline material). Such a solid melts and gets frozen back with raising and lowering the temperature, respectively, and its resistivity behaves opposite to the free electron gas model predictions.

Title: Collapse of density wave and emergence of superconductivity in pressurized-La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ evidenced by ultrafast spectroscopy
Authors: Shuxiang Xu, Hao Wang, Mengwu Huo, Deyuan Hu, Qiong Wu, Li Yue, Dong Wu, Meng Wang, Tao Dong, Nanlin Wang
Abstract: Recent discoveries of superconductivity in Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates realize a rare category of superconductors. However, the use of high-pressure diamond anvil cell has significantly limited spectroscopic characterization of the density waves and superconducting gaps. Here, we systematically studied the pressure evolution of the density waves and their interplay with superconductivity in La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$ using ultrafast optical pump-probe spectroscopy. We found that both the transition temperature and energy gap of density waves are initially suppressed with increasing pressure and disappear suddenly near 17 GPa. After the density wave collapse, a newly small charge gap associated to superconductivity opens at low temperatures. The extracted gap-to-T$_c$ ratio, $2\Delta_{SC}/ k_{B} T_{c} $, is found to be approximately 3, consistent with the weak coupling regime. These results suggest that superconductivity in pressurized-La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ competes strongly with density waves, offering new insights into the interplay between these two phenomena.

Title: Possible superconductivity in very thin magnesium films
Authors: Giovanni Alberto Ummarino, Alessio Zaccone
Abstract: It is known that noble metals such as gold, silver and copper are not supercon- 1 ductors, so as magnesium. This is due to the weakness of the electron-phonon interaction 2 which makes them excellent conductors but not superconductors. As it has recently been 3 shown for gold, silver and copper, even for magnesium it is possible that in very particular 4 situations superconductivity may occur. Quantum confinement in thin films has been 5 consistently shown to induce a significant enhancement of the superconducting critical 6 temperature in several superconductors. It is therefore an important fundamental question 7 whether ultra-thin film confinement may induce observable superconductivity in non- 8 superconducting metals such as magnesium. We study this problem using a generalization, 9 in the Eliashberg framework, of a BCS theory of superconductivity in good metals under 10 thin-film confinement. By numerically solving these new Eliashberg-type equations, we 11 find the dependence of the superconducting critical temperature on the film thickness, L. 12 This parameter-free theory predicts superconductivity in very thin magnesium films. We 13 demonstrate that this is a fine-tuning problem where the thickness must assume a very 14 precise value, close to half a nanometer.

Title: Revealing localised dark-exciton populations in 2D perovskites via magneto-optical microscopy
Authors: Christopher G. Bailey, Adrian Mena, Tik Lun Leung, Nicholas P. Sloane, Chwenhaw Liao, David R. McKenzie, Dane R. McCamey, Anita Ho-Baillie
Abstract: The successful development of optoelectronic devices is contingent on a detailed understanding of interactions between light and excited energy states in photoactive materials. In 2D perovskites, excitons are the dominant photogenerated species and their energetic structure plays a pivotal role, governing photon absorption and emission processes. In these materials, dark exciton states can undergo photoluminescence due to the relaxation of selection rules and this process can be modulated by an external magnetic field, enabling unambiguous identification of the exciton fine structure. Previous reports of magneto-optical spectroscopy on 2D perovskites have been restricted to the macroscopic response, where key information is lost regarding the microscopic heterogeneity of the photoluminescence. Here, we use magneto-optical microscopy for the first time on perovskite materials to elucidate the spatial variation of exciton emission processes. In 2D perovskite thin films, we distinguish between regions of localised bright and dark exciton populations, correlated to the film morphology. In single crystals, we show that dark excitons become localised at the edges, where excitons can be trapped in two distinct types of sub-gap states. This work represents significant progress in understanding the properties of exciton emission in 2D perovskites, which is crucial for the development of optoelectronic technology.

Title: Neutral but Impactful: Gallium Cluster-Induced Nanopores from Beam-Blanked Gallium Ion Sources
Authors: Dana O. Byrne, Stephanie M. Ribet, Karen C. Bustillo, Colin Ophus, Frances I. Allen
Abstract: Neutral atoms emitted from liquid metal ion sources are an often-overlooked source of contamination and damage in focused ion beam microscopy. Beyond ions and single atoms, these sources also emit atom clusters. While most studies have investigated charged clusters, here we demonstrate that neutral clusters are also emitted. These neutral clusters bypass the electrostatic beam blanking system, allowing them to impinge on samples even when the ion beam is blanked. We investigate this phenomenon using thin (<20 nm) freestanding membranes of hexagonal boron nitride, silicon, and silicon nitride as targets. Randomly dispersed nanopores that form upon neutral cluster exposure are revealed. The average nanopore diameter is ~2 nm with a narrow size distribution, suggesting that the atom clusters emitted from the source have a preferred size. Various electron microscopy techniques are used to characterize the nanopores, including high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, multislice ptychography, and electron energy-loss spectroscopy. Finally, we show how electron irradiation in the transmission electron microscope can be used to both remove any amorphous material that may clog the pores and to controllably grow the pores to specific sizes. Tunable nanopores such as these are interesting for nanofluidic applications involving size-selective membranes.

Title: Thickening of liquids using copolymer grafted nanoparticles
Authors: Prama Adhya, Sachin M. B. Gautham, Tarak K Patra, Manish Kaushal, Titash Mondal
Abstract: Precise control over the flow behavior of liquids is a critical problem and is demanding for multifaceted applications. Introducing surface-engineered nanoparticles into the liquid can tune the flow behavior. However, the extent of tunability depends on the compatibility of the surface groups on nanoparticles and the liquid matrix. Herein, we report a strategy to synthesize solvophilic surface-engineered nanoparticles demonstrating its capability to control the flow property of chemically distinct liquids like silicone oil and polyethylene glycol. Silylated polyether amine-modified silica nanoparticles with polymer brush-like structure were selected as the model synthesized material. By combining rheological experiments with coarse-grained molecular dynamic (CGMD) simulations, we demonstrate that adding these grafted nanoparticles significantly impacts the viscosity of both liquids. The impact of grafting density on the rheological properties was also corroborated. Simulations indicate the formation of a diverse array of nanoparticle microstructures, including contact aggregates, bridged aggregates, and one-dimensional string-like structures that dictate the viscosity of the material. Furthermore, we show that copolymers with predominantly matrix-compatible moieties facilitate the intercalation of matrix molecules within the polymer brushes, enhancing interactions at the molecular level. This work provides fundamental insights into the design of composite materials with tunable rheological properties, offering new pathways for optimizing liquid formulations.

Title: Non-equilibirum physics of density-difference dependent Hamiltonian: Quantum Scarring from Emergent Chiral Symmetry
Authors: William N Faugno, Hosho Katsura, Tomoki Ozawa
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars represent a form of weak ergodicity breaking that highlights the unusual physics of thermalization in quantum systems. Understanding scar formation promises insight into the connection between classical statistical mechanics and the quantum world. The existence of quantum many-body scars calls into question how the macroscopic world can arise from the Schrodinger equation. In this work, we demonstrate the existence of quantum many-body scars in the density-difference-dependent Hamiltonian. This Hamiltonian has a particular manifestation of chiral symmetry due to its interaction being neither attractive nor repulsive a prior, but depending on the configuration. As a result of this symmetry and peculiar interaction, we find that this system hosts two different classes of quantum scars; a charge density wave ordered scar and an edge-mode scar. We establish the existence of these scars by examining the entanglement entropy of the system as well as demonstrating robust thermalization breaking time dynamics. For each, we propose simple mechanisms that give rise to these scars which may be applicable to other systems.

Title: First-principles theory of ionic thermoelectricity
Authors: Byeoksong Lee, Joongoo Kang
Abstract: Symmetry plays a crucial role in shaping the theories of fundamental forces. For example, general covariance -- the equivalence of all possible coordinate systems of spacetime -- dictates the law of gravity. Here, we extend this concept to nonequilibrium thermodynamics by developing a theory of ionic thermoelectricity (thermoelectricity without electrons) in electronically gapped ionic conductors. Within the Green-Kubo formalism, we show that energy gauge invariance -- the equivalence of all possible ways of distributing energy among atoms -- primarily determines the expressions for ionic thermoelectric coefficients. This symmetry-dictated theory is generally applicable, regardless of specific ion transport mechanisms, and provides a rigorous conceptual and computational framework for describing ionic thermoelectricity from first principles.

Title: Flux-tunable parity-protected qubit based on a single full-shell nanowire Josephson junction
Authors: G. Giavaras, Ruben Seoane Souto, Maria Jose Calderon, Ramon Aguado
Abstract: Leveraging the higher harmonics content of the Josephson potential in a superconducting circuit offers a promising route in the search for new qubits with increased protection against decoherence. In this work, we demonstrate how the flux tunability of a hybrid semiconductor-superconductor Josephson junction based on a single full-shell nanowire enables this possibility. Near one flux quantum, $\Phi\approx \Phi_0=h/2e$, we find that the qubit system can be tuned from a gatemon regime to a parity-protected regime with qubit eigenstates localized in phase space in the $0$ and $\pi$ minima of the Josephson potential ($\cos 2\varphi_0$). Estimates of qubit coherence and relaxation times due to different noise sources are presented.

Title: Deciphering the dual chemotaxis strategy of bacteria in porous media
Authors: Sönke Beier, Veronika Pfeifer, Agniva Datta, Robert Großmann, Carsten Beta
Abstract: Chemotaxis of bacterial swimmers that move in a run-and-turn pattern is well studied in uniform bulk fluid. It is primarily based on modulating the run time in dependence on the swimming direction with respect to the source of chemoattractant (run time bias). Here, we provide evidence that the lophotrichously flagellated soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida may also perform chemotaxis in porous media where the free path length is severely restricted. Besides the classical run time bias, we identify a second chemotactic strategy: the change in swimming direction upon a turn event is adjusted, so that the direction of the next run phase is biased towards the source of chemoattractant (turn angle bias). Agent based simulations, based on the experimentally observed statistical properties of the swimming pattern, indicate that turn angle bias is the predominant chemotaxis strategy of bacteria in porous environments.

Title: Unraveling Spin Density Wave Order in Layered Nickelates $\mathrm{La_3Ni_2O_7}$ and $\mathrm{La_2PrNi_2O_7}$ via Neutron Diffraction

Abstract: The discovery of pressure-induced superconductivity in two- and three-layer Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates has generated significant interest in these materials as a platform for unconventional superconductivity. While their ground state exhibits magnetism, a direct determination of their magnetic structure remains elusive. Understanding this aspect is crucial, as magnetism may play a role in the pairing mechanism of superconductivity in these compounds. We resolve the magnetic structures of the bilayer (2222) polymorphs of La3Ni2O7 and La2PrNi2O7 using neutron powder diffraction (NPD) and muon-spin rotation/relaxation (muSR). Magnetic neutron scattering appears below approximately 150 K in both compounds and is observed at the (qx, 1/2, 0) position, with qx = 0 and 1/2 for La3Ni2O7 and qx = 0 for La2PrNi2O7. Within a single layer, alternating low (0.05 - 0.075 muB) and high (0.66 muB) magnetic moment stripes form. These layers stack antiferromagnetically along the c-direction to form bilayers. The presence of two propagation vectors (qx = 0 and 1/2) in undoped La3Ni2O7 suggests the coexistence of two magnetic stacking polymorphs within a single crystallographic phase. The muSR spectra further confirm these magnetic structures. Our findings provide a detailed understanding of the magnetic ground state in bilayer nickelates, offering insights into possible precursor states that may influence the emergence of superconductivity in these materials.

Title: Evaluation of tortuosity: A radical tessellation-based method in porous spherical particle packing systems
Authors: Zongli Chen, Chenzhe Li, Ying Zhao
Abstract: Estimating the tortuosity of porous electrodes is important for understanding the performance of lithium-ion batteries and optimizing the design of electrode microstructures. In this work, a new method for estimating the tortuosity of porous electrodes is proposed based on radical tessellation, and the results agree well with those calculated by empirical formulas and finite element simulations. Compared with empirical formulas, the proposed method can estimate tortuosity for more complicated microstructures, regardless of particle distribution and size dispersity; compared with finite element simulations, the proposed method offers a significant advantage in computational efficiency. Based on the method, the influence of different microstructure characters on the tortuosity is discussed. It is found that in addition to the porosity, the particle size and particle aggregation morphology are all critical in influencing the tortuosity of the porous electrode. Finally, the tortuosity obtained by this method is integrated into the Pseudo-2-dimensional (P2D) model for the calculation of effective properties, and the results show that this method offers an efficient way in improving the prediction accuracy of P2D models.

Title: Separating the bulk and interface contribution of spin-orbit torque in ferromagnet-Heavy metal bilayers tuned by variation of resistivity of heavy metal
Authors: Abu Bakkar Miah, Dhananjaya Mahapatra, Soumik Aon, Harekrishna Bhunia, Partha Mitra
Abstract: Harmonic Hall measurements were conducted on a series of Ferromagnetic metal/Heavy metal (FM/HM) bilayers with beta-Tungsten (W) as the HM and in-plane magnetized permalloy (Py) as the FM and the efficiencies of the two orthogonal components of the spin orbit-torque were extracted. Two sets of Hall bar-shaped devices were considered where the HM resistivity systematically varied over a wide range (sim150-1000 muOmega-cm) while the FM layer remained the same and each set having a different aspect ratio of voltage pickup line width and Hall bar width. Using numerical simulations of current distribution at the region between voltage pickup lines we have normalised the SOT efficiencies and examined their dependence. The current-induced spin-orbit torque efficiency in ferromagnetic metal (FM)/heavy metal (HM) bilayers is quantitatively investigated in this this http URL-W, known for its high spin-orbit coupling, served as the HM layer, while Py, an FM with an in-plane magnetic anisotropy, comprised the other layer. We performed a thorough analysis of the second harmonic Hall resistance (R_{xy}^{2\omega}) obtained from Py/beta-W bilayer devices, systematically varying the resistivity (rho_W) of the beta-W layer within the range of 200 to 1000 \mu\Omega-cm by employing a fixed current density (J_W\sim0.8\times10^{11} A/m^2) through beta-W. Through this analysis, we derived the Slonczewski-like efficiency (xi_{SL}) and field-like efficiency (\xi_{FL}) as a function of rho_W. Notably, the device with a resistivity of 980 muOmega-cm exhibited the highest xi_{SL}, yielding a value of -0.42 0.09. These results highlight the promising potential of highly resistiv beta-W as a material of interest in spintronics research.

Title: Field-induced Multi-$\boldsymbol{\vec{Q}}$ States in a Pyrochlore Heisenberg Magnet
Authors: Cecilie Glittum, Olav F. Syljuåsen
Abstract: We construct exact ground states of the $J_1$-$J_{3b}$ classical Heisenberg model on the pyrochlore lattice in the presence of a magnetic field. They are non-coplanar multi-$\vec{Q}$ spin configurations with a large magnetic unit cell that generalize the previously found coplanar sublattice pairing states. Using linear spin wave theory, we show that entropy favors these multi-$\vec{Q}$ states at low temperatures in high magnetic fields. This is confirmed by Monte Carlo simulations, and a phase diagram is constructed. We also calculate the zero-temperature dynamical structure factor. Besides the usual Goldstone modes associated with the ordering $\vec{Q}$s, we find high intensity gapless modes at momenta where there are no Bragg peaks.

Title: Phenomenological Scaling Crossovers in Non-Equilibrium Critical Dynamics
Authors: Rong Li, Qirui Ding, Weicheng Cui
Abstract: Dynamical universality plays a fundamental role in understanding the scaling properties of critical dynamics, including absorbing phase transitions and physical aging. Although individual universality classes have been extensively studied, the theoretical framework for scaling crossovers between distinct dynamical regimes remains underdeveloped. In this work, we propose a phenomenological approach to describe dynamic scaling crossovers in reaction-diffusion systems, utilizing a Bernoulli differential equation with time-dependent reaction coefficients. Under a new scaling hypothesis for spatial fluctuations, we analytically derive five universal power-law crossover functions. These solutions accurately describe experimental observations of absorbing phase transitions in turbulent liquid crystals and reaction-diffusion crossovers in exciton-exciton recombination, revealing possible mechanisms associated with many-body correlations and two-component dynamics. These findings suggest the existence of universal scaling laws governing the transition between different dynamical states, motivating further studies using field-theoretic approaches and renormalization group analyses.

Title: Tailoring the breathing-mode distortions in nickelate-ferroelectric heterostructures
Authors: Guillaume Krieger, Chia-Ping Su, Hoshang Sahib, Raymond Fan, Paul Steadman, Alexandre Gloter, Nathalie Viart, Daniele Preziosi
Abstract: In transition metal oxides electron-electron interaction and lattice degree of freedom are basic ingredients of emergent phenomena, such as metal-to-insulator transition (MIT) and superconductivity. Perovskite rare-earth nickelates are largely studied for their temperature-driven MIT which is accompanied by a breathing mode distortion, and associated to a bond-disproportionation of the expanded (3d8L0) and compressed (3d8L2) NiO6 octahedra. Steric effects control the onset temperature of the MIT, the latter being concomitant or not with a complex antiferromagnetic spin arrangement depending upon the choice of the rare earth ion (TMIT>TNeel). Interface engineering of oxygen octahedra tilting, as imposed by the symmetry and orientation of the substrate, has resulted in an efficient pathway to modify both TMIT and TNeel, hence, suggesting a key role of the electron-phonon coupling for both transport and magnetic properties in nickelate thin films. Here, via a combination of resonant elastic X-ray scattering and transport experiments, we show a control over both TMIT and TNeel in heteroepitaxial PZT(d)/NNO(7 nm)//STO heterostructures, which are characterized by different strains and polarization states of the PZT layer grown at different thicknesses d. We found the expected NNO bulk behaviour, for a fully relaxed PZT layer showing a monodomain polarization state. On the other side, an almost 30 K difference, is found for a fully strained PZT characterized by a multidomain texture of the polarization state. We discuss our results in terms of an altered breathing distortion pattern of the underlying nickelate layer as supported by X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements. We infer that locally different polar distortions controlled by a combination of polarization direction and strength of the strain state play the main role in the observed TMIT and TNeel variations.

Title: Quantitative comparison of power grid reinforcements
Authors: Bálint Hartmann, Géza Ódor, Kristóf Benedek, István Papp, Michelle T. Cirunay
Abstract: This paper presents a quantitative comparison of power grid reinforcement strategies. We evaluate three approaches: (1) doubling transmission links (bridges) between different communities, (2) adding bypasses around weakly synchronized nodes, and (3) reinforcing edges that trigger the largest cascade failures. We use two different models of the Hungarian high-voltage network. These models are built from the official data provided by the transmission system operator, thus eliminating the assumptions typically used in other studies. The coupling strength distribution of the Hungarian models shows good agreement with our previous works using the European and North American grids. Additionally, we examine the occurrence of Braess' paradox, where added transmission capacity unexpectedly reduces overall stability. Our results show that reinforcement through community-based bridge duplication yields the most significant improvements across all parameters. A visual comparison highlights differences between this method and traditional reinforcement approaches. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first attempt to quantitatively compare results of oscillator-based studies with those relying on power system analysis software. Characteristic results of line-cut simulations reveal cascade size distributions with fat-tailed decays for medium coupling strengths, while exponential behavior emerges for small and large couplings. The observed exponents are reminiscent of the continuously changing exponents due to Griffiths effects near a hybrid type of phase transition.

Title: Raman Forbidden Layer-Breathing Modes in Layered Semiconductor Materials Activated by Phonon and Optical Cavity Effects
Authors: Miao-Ling Lin, Jiang-Bin Wu, Xue-Lu Liu, Tao Liu, Rui Mei, Heng Wu, Shan Guan, Jia-Liang Xie, Jun-Wei Luo, Lin-Wang Wang, Andrea C. Ferrari, Ping-Heng Tan
Abstract: We report Raman forbidden layer-breathing modes (LBMs) in layered semiconductor materials (LSMs). The intensity distribution of all observed LBMs depends on layer number, incident light wavelength and refractive index mismatch between LSM and underlying substrate. These results are understood by a Raman scattering theory via the proposed spatial interference model, where the naturally occurring optical and phonon cavities in LSMs enable spatially coherent photon-phonon coupling mediated by the corresponding one-dimensional periodic electronic states. Our work reveals the spatial coherence of photon and phonon fields on the phonon excitation via photon/phonon cavity engineering.

Title: Synchronization of propagating spin waves in spin Hall oscillators: A micromagnetic study
Authors: Mohammad Haidar
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the synchronization of propagating spin waves in a novel spin torque oscillator device layout using micromagnetic simulations. This design enables individual probing of the dc current in each oscillator, allowing precise control over the synchronization state and providing direct phase measurement. Our findings reveal that two adjacent oscillators achieve phase locking when they maintain a constant phase difference, either in phase or anti-phase, depending on their separation distance. This work offers new insights into STO synchronization mechanisms and paves the way for improved control and functionality in spintronic devices.

Title: Optical pumping and initialization of a hole spin in site-controlled InGaAs pyramidal quantum dots
Authors: R. A. Barcan, I. Samaras, K. Barr, G. Juska, E. Pelucchi, K. G. Lagoudakis
Abstract: We investigate site-controlled In$_{0.25}$Ga$_{0.75}$As quantum dots in (111)B GaAs pyramidal recesses as spin qubits. Combining scanning confocal cryomicroscopy, magneto-photoluminescence studies and resonant excitation, we identify and isolate a positively charged exciton with a hole-spin in its ground state. Application of a strong 5 T magnetic field parallel to the growth axis, induces a fourfold splitting of the energy levels of the positively charged exciton creating an optically addressable double-lambda system. We combine weak above-band and resonant excitation to demonstrate spin pumping and high-fidelity spin initialization through all four optical transitions and study the system behavior as a function of the resonant driving strength showing the existence of a robust spin that can be optically pumped and initialized. These results demonstrate the potential of these quantum dots for precise spin manipulation and their relevance for future quantum hardware.

Title: First-passage-time statistics of active Brownian particles: A perturbative approach
Authors: Yanis Baouche, Magali Le Goff, Christina Kurzthaler, Thomas Franosch
Abstract: We study the first-passage-time (FPT) properties of active Brownian particles to reach an absorbing wall in two dimensions. Employing a perturbation approach we obtain exact analytical predictions for the survival and FPT distributions for small Péclet numbers, measuring the importance of self-propulsion relative to diffusion. While randomly oriented active agents reach the wall faster than their passive counterpart, their initial orientation plays a crucial role in the FPT statistics. Using the median as a metric, we quantify this anisotropy and find that it becomes more pronounced at distances where persistent active motion starts to dominate diffusion.

Title: Cavity-mediated charge and pair-density waves in a unitary Fermi gas
Authors: Timo Zwettler, Filip Marijanović, Tabea Bühler, Sambuddha Chattopadhyay, Giulia Del Pace, Luka Skolc, Victor Helson, Shun Uchino, Eugene Demler, Jean-Philippe Brantut
Abstract: Coherent light-matter interactions between a quantum gas and light in a high-finesse cavity can drive self-ordering phase transitions. To date, such phenomena have involved exclusively single-atom coupling to light, resulting in coupled charge-density or spin-density wave and superradiant order. In this work, we engineer simultaneous coupling of cavity photons to both single atoms and fermionic pairs, which are also mutually coupled due to strong correlations in the unitary Fermi gas. This interplay gives rise to an interference between the charge-density wave and a pair-density wave, where the short-range pair correlation function is spontaneously modulated in space. We observe this effect by tracking the onset of superradiance as the photon-pair coupling is varied in strength and sign, revealing constructive or destructive interference of the three orders with a coupling mediated by strong light-matter and atom-atom interactions. Our observations are compared with mean-field theory where the coupling strength between atomic- and pair-density waves is controlled by higher-order correlations in the Fermi gas. These results demonstrate the potential of cavity quantum electrodynamics to produce and observe exotic orders in strongly correlated matter, paving the way for the quantum simulation of complex quantum matter using ultracold atoms.

Title: The dynamics of skyrmion shrinking
Authors: Frederik Austrup, Wolfgang Häusler, Michael Lau, Michael Thorwart
Abstract: When magnetic skyrmions decay, their size in real space decreases in a finite time before they eventually collapse. We construct an effective continuum model and use its dynamics to describe the shrinking behavior of skyrmions before they collapse. Using the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation and the time derivative of the vector field, we find a set of coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equation for the time dependent effective skyrmion radius and its helicity. In particular, we use a triangular-shaped skyrmion profile of its polar angle. Contrary to the commonly expected simple exponential decrease in size, we reveal a more complicated time dependence, in which the time-dependent radius crosses over from an exponential decay towards a square root decrease, $\sim (t - t_c)^{1/2}$, near a critical time $t_c$ at which it collapses. This critical time is found to depend logarithmically on the lattice constant. In addition, we examine the interplay between the shrinking dynamics and an accompanying transformation through different skyrmion configurations, depending on the various system parameters. The findings are verified by numerical studies on the lattice, supporting the predictions from the theoretical continuum model.

Abstract: In this study, we explore the ferroelectric domain structure and mechanical properties of PbTiO$_3$-based membranes, which develops a well-ordered and crystallographic-oriented ripple pattern upon release from their growth substrate. The ferrolectric domain structure of the PbTiO$_3$ layer was examined at various length scales using optical second harmonic generation, piezoresponse force microscopy, and scanning transmission electron microscopy. These methods reveal the presence of purely in-plane domains organized into superdomains at the crest of the ripples, while an in-plane/out-of-plane domain structure was observed in the flat regions separating the ripples, in agreement with phase-field simulations. The mechanical properties of the membrane were assessed using contact resonance force microscopy, which identified distinct mechanical behaviors at the ripples compared to the flat regions. This study shows that the physical properties of the ferroelectric layer in membranes can be locally controlled within an ordered array of ripples, with well-defined geometric characteristics.

Title: Floquet-Engineering of Feshbach Resonances in Ultracold Gases
Authors: Alexander Guthmann, Felix Lang, Louisa Marie Kienesberger, Sian Barbosa, Artur Widera
Abstract: Scattering resonances are fundamental in science, spanning energy scales from stellar nuclear fusion to ultracold collisions. In ultracold quantum gases, magnetic Feshbach resonances have transformed quantum many-body research by enabling precise interaction control between atoms. Here, we demonstrate unprecedented control to engineer new Feshbach resonances at tunable positions via Floquet driving in a $^{6}$Li atom gas, achieved through strong magnetic field modulation at MHz frequencies. This periodic modulation creates new resonances whenever dressed molecular levels cross the atomic threshold. By adding a second modulation at twice the base frequency, we tune the asymmetry of resonance loss profiles and suppress two-body losses from Floquet heating. This technique enhances control over atomic interactions, expanding possibilities for quantum simulations of complex systems and studies of exotic quantum phases.

Title: Automatic determination of quasicrystalline patterns from microscopy images
Authors: Tano Kim Kender, Marco Corrias, Cesare Franchini
Abstract: Quasicrystals are aperiodically ordered solids that exhibit long-range order without translational periodicity, bridging the gap between crystalline and amorphous materials. Due to their lack of translational periodicity, information on atomic arrangements in quasicrystals cannot be extracted by current crystalline lattice recognition softwares. This work introduces a method to automatically detect quasicrystalline atomic arrangements and tiling using image feature recognition coupled with machine learning, tailored towards quasiperiodic tilings with 8-, 10- and 12-fold rotational symmetry. Atom positions are identified using clustering of feature descriptors. Subsequent nearest-neighbor analysis and border following on the interatomic connections deliver the tiling. Support vector machines further increase the quality of the results, reaching an accuracy consistent with those reported in the literature. A statistical analysis of the results is performed. The code is now part of the open-source package AiSurf.

Title: Collective modes in superconductors including Coulomb repulsion
Authors: Joshua Althüser, Götz S. Uhrig
Abstract: We numerically study the collective excitations present in isotropic superconductors including a screened Coulomb interaction. By varying the screening strength, we analyze its impact on the system. We use a formulation of the effective phonon-mediated interaction between electrons that depends on the energy transfer between particles, rather than being a constant in a small energy shell around the Fermi edge. This justifies considering also rather large attractive interactions. We compute the system's Green's functions using the iterated equations of motion (iEoM) approach, which ultimately enables a quantitative analysis of collective excitations. For weak couplings, we identify the well-known amplitude (Higgs) mode at the two-particle continuum's lower edge and the phase (Anderson-Bogoliubov) mode at $\omega = 0$ for a neutral system, which shifts to higher energies as the Coulomb interaction is switched on. As the phononic coupling is increased, the Higgs mode separates from the continuum, and additional phase and amplitude modes appear, persisting even in the presence Coulomb interactions.

Title: The open driven two-level system at conical intersections of quasienergies
Authors: Sigmund Kohler
Abstract: We study the stationary state of an ac-driven two-level system under particle exchange with a fermionic environment. A particular question addressed is whether there exist limits in which the populations of the Floquet states are determined by their quasienergies or their mean energies, respectively. The focus lies on parameters in the vicinity of conical intersections of quasienergies, because there the two kinds of energies behave rather differently, such that the characteristics of the two intuitive limits are most pronounced. A main finding is a crossover from a Floquet-Gibbs state at low temperatures to a mean-energy dominated state at intermediate temperatures. Analytical estimates are confirmed by numerical calculations.

Title: Machine Learning for Improved Density Functional Theory Thermodynamics
Authors: Sergei I. Simak, Erna K. Delczeg-Czirjak, Olle Eriksson
Abstract: The predictive accuracy of density functional theory (DFT) for alloy formation enthalpies is often limited by intrinsic energy resolution errors, particularly in ternary phase stability calculations. In this work, we present a machine learning (ML) approach to systematically correct these errors, improving the reliability of first-principles predictions. A neural network model has been trained to predict the discrepancy between DFT-calculated and experimentally measured enthalpies for binary and ternary alloys and compounds. The model utilizes a structured feature set comprising elemental concentrations, atomic numbers, and interaction terms to capture key chemical and structural effects. By applying supervised learning and rigorous data curation we ensure a robust and physically meaningful correction. The model is implemented as a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) regressor with three hidden layers, optimized through leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) and k-fold cross-validation to prevent overfitting. We illustrate the effectiveness of this method by applying it to the Al-Ni-Pd and Al-Ni-Ti systems, which are of interest for high-temperature applications in aerospace and protective coatings.

Title: Three-dimensional flat band in ultra-thin Kagome metal Mn3Sn film

Abstract: Flat bands with small energy dispersion can give rise to strongly correlated electronic and topological phases, especially when located at the Fermi level. Whilst flat bands have been experimentally realized in two-dimensional (2D) twisted van der Waals heterostructures, they are highly sensitive to twist angle, necessitating complex fabrication techniques. Geometrically frustrated kagome lattices have emerged as an attractive platform as they natively host flat bands that have been observed experimentally in quasi-2D bulk-crystal kagome metals. An outstanding experimental question is whether flat bands can be realized in atomically thin metals, with opportunities for stronger electron-electron interactions through tuning of the surrounding dielectric environment. Here we use angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning tunnelling microscopy and band structure calculations to show that ultra-thin films of the kagome metal Mn3Sn host a robust dispersionless flat band with a bandwidth of 50 meV. Furthermore, we demonstrate chemical tuning of the flat band to near the Fermi level via manganese defect engineering. The realization of tunable kagome-derived flat bands in an ultra-thin kagome metal, represents a promising platform to study strongly correlated and topological phenomena, with applications in quantum computing, spintronics and low-energy electronics.

Title: Discovery of unconventional charge-spin-intertwined density wave in magnetic kagome metal GdTi3Bi4
Authors: Xianghe Han, Hui Chen, Zhongyi Cao, Jingwen Guo, Fucong Fei, Hengxin Tan, Jianfeng Guo, Yanhao Shi, Runnong Zhou, Ruwen Wang, Zhen Zhao, Haitao Yang, Fengqi Song, Shiyu Zhu, Binghai Yan, Ziqiang Wang, Hong-Jun Gao
Abstract: The symmetry breaking and its interplay among spin, charge, and lattice degrees of freedom is crucial for understanding correlated quantum states such as charge density waves (CDWs) and unconventional superconductivity. Here, we report the discovery by low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy of unconventional charge-spin-intertwined density waves in magnetic kagome metal GdTi3Bi4, which exhibits the one-third magnetization plateau. We reveal the emergence of 3Q CDWs incommensurate with the crystalline lattice in both periodicity and orientation, breaking all mirror and rotation symmetries. The CDW exhibits incommensurate-commensurate transitions in an applied magnetic field and transitions between 3Q and 1Q CDWs as a function of field and temperature, accompanied by changes in the spatial symmetries. Remarkably, the quantum and classic melting of the CDWs exhibits a phase structure which is consistent with the magnetization phase diagram of bulk GdTi3Bi4, providing strong evidence for the intertwined charge-spin density wave order. The origin of the charge-spin intertwinement is further evidenced by the observed hybridization between itinerant electrons and Gd local moments. Our findings uncover an unconventional form of charge-spin orders and offer new insights into a broad class of multi-components density wave formation in kagome and other correlated quantum materials.

Title: Impact of on-site potentials on $q$-breathers in nonlinear chains
Authors: Lin Deng, Chengguan Fang, Hang Yu, Yisen Wang, Zhigang Zhu, Weicheng Fu, Sergej Flach, Liang Huang
Abstract: On-site potentials are ubiquitous in physical systems and strongly influence their heat transport and energy localization. These potentials will inevitably affect the dynamical properties of $q$-breathers (QBs), defined as periodic orbits exponentially localized in normal mode space. By integrating on-site terms into the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou-$\beta$ system, this work utilizes numerical simulations and Floquet analysis to systematically explore the influence of on-site potentials on QB stability. For most QBs, except those at the phonon band edges, the instability is primarily governed by parametric resonance, and effectively described by coupled Mathieu equations. This approach provides a theoretical expression for the instability thresholds, which aligns well with numerical results. We demonstrate that the instability thresholds can be controlled through the strength of on-site potentials, and for a strong enough quadratic on-site potential, the QBs are always stable. Furthermore, the instability threshold is highly sensitive to the seed mode, in stark contrast to systems without on-site potentials. In addition, the instability phase diagrams exhibit joint interplay between different terms in the Hamiltonian, such as the quadratic on-site and quartic inter-site interaction terms, in regulating the QB dynamics. These findings offer valuable insights into QB stability and the manipulation of localized excitations in diverse physical systems with on-site potentials.

Abstract: Powder X-ray diffraction (pXRD) experiments are a cornerstone for materials structure characterization. Despite their widespread application, analyzing pXRD diffractograms still presents a significant challenge to automation and a bottleneck in high-throughput discovery in self-driving labs. Machine learning promises to resolve this bottleneck by enabling automated powder diffraction analysis. A notable difficulty in applying machine learning to this domain is the lack of sufficiently sized experimental datasets, which has constrained researchers to train primarily on simulated data. However, models trained on simulated pXRD patterns showed limited generalization to experimental patterns, particularly for low-quality experimental patterns with high noise levels and elevated backgrounds. With the Open Experimental Powder X-Ray Diffraction Database (opXRD), we provide an openly available and easily accessible dataset of labeled and unlabeled experimental powder diffractograms. Labeled opXRD data can be used to evaluate the performance of models on experimental data and unlabeled opXRD data can help improve the performance of models on experimental data, e.g. through transfer learning methods. We collected \numpatterns diffractograms, 2179 of them labeled, from a wide spectrum of materials classes. We hope this ongoing effort can guide machine learning research toward fully automated analysis of pXRD data and thus enable future self-driving materials labs.

Title: Optical control of the spin-Hall effect in a two-dimensional hole gas
Authors: Simone Rossi, Valentina Caprotti, Andrea Filippi, Emiliano Bonera, Jacopo Pedrini, Roberto Raimondi, Maksym Myronov, Fabio Pezzoli
Abstract: Relativistic effects influence the motion of charged particles in solids by intertwining spin and momentum. The resulting phenomena exhibit rich and intriguing properties that can unveil radically new quantum devices. In this context, the two-dimensional hole gas formed in group IV heterostructures is a particularly promising platform, owning to a notable spin-orbit coupling. However, the exploitation of spin-momentum locking and precise manipulation of spin currents has remained elusive thus far. Here we use the modulation-doping technique to break inversion symmetry at novel Ge1-xSnx/Ge interfaces and explore spin-orbit phenomena in the emergent Rashba-coupled hole gases. Magneto-optical investigations demonstrate the unusual establishment of a staggered band alignment with carrier lifetime in the ns range. Optical spin orientation is then leveraged to directly inject spin-polarized currents in the Rashba-split 2D gas. Spin-to-charge conversion is shown to genuinely occur at the staggered gap through the inverse spin-Hall effect. This provides unprecedented access to low-order contributions of the spin-orbit Hamiltonian. Moreover, it leads to the startling demonstration that the spin Hall angle can be optically controlled by modifying the Rashba coupling through the photoexcitation density. Ge1-xSnx quantum wells thus offer innovative solutions and functionalities stemming from their unique spin-dependent properties and intriguing quantum phenomena at the crossroad between transport and photonic realms.

Title: Effects of phonon confinement on electron transport in Si nanowire and armchair-edge graphene nanoribbon transistors: A dissipative quantum-transport study
Authors: Bimin Cai, Maarten L. Van de Put, Massimo V. Fischetti
Abstract: Electronic transport in low-dimensional structures, such as thin bodies, nanosheets, nanoribbons and nanowires, is strongly affected by electron and phonon confinement, in addition to interface roughness. Here we use a quantum-transport formulation based on empirical pseudopotentials and the Master equation to study the effect of the phonon boundary conditions on the electron transport in field effect transistors (FETs) based on a small cross-section (3$\times$3 cells) Si nanowire (NW) and a 10 armchair graphene nanoribbon (10-aGNR). For the dispersion of the confined phonons we employ a simple empirical model based on the folding of the bulk phonon dispersion that approximates the results of the elastic-continuum model at long wavelengths. We consider two extreme cases for their boundary conditions: clamped boundary conditions (CBCs) or free-standing (FSBCs). We find that phonon confinement affects more severely the Si nanowires than graphene nanoribbons. In particular, for 3$\times$3 SiNW-FETs, CBCs result in a higher room-temperature electron mobility than FSBCs, a result consistent with what previously reported. On the contrary, in the off-equilibrium conditions seen in gate-all-around (GAA) 3$\times$3 SiNW-FETs with 7~nm gate-length, FSBCs yield a higher on-current than what is obtained assuming CBCs. However, for 10-aGNR-FETs, both the electron mobility and the on-current are higher when assuming FSBCs.

Title: Geometric Optimization of Patterned Conductive Polymer Composite-based Strain Sensors Toward Enhanced Sensing Performance
Authors: Jia-Chen Shang
Abstract: The patterned design of flexible sensors enables customized performance to meet diverse application demands. However, when multiple geometric parameters and sensing metrics are involved, experimental approaches to establish structure-performance relationships become costly and inefficient. Here, a novel universal piezoresistive model--overcoming limitations of commonly used models that are only applicable to small strains and linear responses--is developed to capture the relationship between conductivity tensor components and strain. A numerical method incorporating this model simulates the electromechanical properties of conductive composites and predicts patterned strain sensors' behavior. To validate this approach, a flexible strain sensor based on laser-induced graphene technology is fabricated and tested. Additionally, a rapid, cost-effective workflow combining Latin hypercube sampling and Pareto-optimal solutions is demonstrated for multi-parameter and multi-objective optimization of the sinusoidal-patterned sensor. This study provides valuable insights for investigating the structure-performance relationship of strain sensors and advances optimization methods for sensor designs.

Title: Equilibrium phases and phase transitions in multicritical magnetic polymers
Authors: Alberto Raiola, Emanuele Locatelli, Davide Marenduzzo, and Enzo Orlandini
Abstract: Magnetic polymers are examples of composite soft materials in which the competition between the large configurational entropy of the soft substrate (polymer) and the magnetic interaction may give rise to rich equilibrium phase diagrams as well as non-standard critical phenomena. Here, we study a self-avoiding walk model decorated by Ising spins of value $0$ and $\pm 1$ that interact according to a Blume-Emery-Griffith-like Hamiltonian. By using mean-field approximations and Monte Carlo simulations, we report the existence of three distinct equilibrium phases: swollen disordered, compact ordered, and compact disordered. Notably, these phases are separated by phase boundaries that meet at multicritical points, whose nature and location are tunable and depend on the strength of the interactions. In our conclusion, we discuss the relevance of the phase diagrams we have obtained to the physics of magnetic polymers and their application to chromatin biophysics.

Title: The route of shear to Ising superconductivity in bilayer graphene
Authors: Jose Gonzalez, Tobias Stauber
Abstract: We show that the sheared graphene bilayers can be tuned to have flat low-energy bands for sufficiently large size of their moiré supercell. In this regime, the interacting system becomes prone to develop broken-symmetry phases, with valley symmetry breaking as the dominant pattern. The strong signal of symmetry breaking favors the onset of a pairing instability in which the electrons with opposite spin projection in the Cooper pairs live in different valleys. The Fermi lines become distorted due to the repulsive Coulomb interaction, which makes the screening highly anisotropic, leading easily to attraction in some of the interaction channels. We also show that the sheared graphene bilayers offer the possibility to realize the combined breakdown of parity and valley symmetry, making them very suitable to study the interplay between correlations and topology in a two-dimensional electron system.

Title: Properties of Electrodeposited Molybdenum Disulfide on Zinc Oxide and Zinc Oxide/Zinc Sulfide Nanowires
Authors: Lee Kendall, Dawn Ford, Giovanni Zangari, Stephen McDonnell
Abstract: We developed a facile and scalable 3-step hydrothermal, electrodeposition, and annealing technique to synthesize a variety of nanowire heterostructures. The heterojunction catalysts of CP-ZnO-MoS2 and CP-ZnO-ZnS-MoS2 both saw an increase in catalytic activity in the acidic regime, with overpotentials to reach 10 mA/cm2 of 181 mV and 154 mV respectively, over their constituent materials. The CP-ZnO-ZnS-MoS2 catalysts also saw an increase in catalytic activity in the alkaline conditions, requiring only 209 mV to reach 10 mA/cm2. This has been attributed primarily to the synergistic properties of the band alignment structure and the increased surface area afforded by the nanowire structure. The 1T phase was also noted in the CP-ZnO-MoS2 sample, suggesting that this also played a role in increasing the catalytic activity of the sample. Overall, the synthesized nanowire heterostructures were found to be high-performing and gives insight into how the changing band alignment and morphology can play a significant role in increasing the catalytic performance towards HER.

Title: A high-throughput ab initio study of elemental segregation and cohesion at ferritic-iron grain boundaries
Authors: Han Lin Mai, Xiang-Yuan Cui, Tilmann Hickel, Jörg Neugebauer, Simon Ringer
Abstract: Segregation of alloying elements and impurities at grain boundaries (GBs) critically influences material behavior by affecting cohesion. In this study, we present an ab initio high-throughput evaluation of segregation energies and cohesive effects for all elements in the periodic table (Z: 1 to 92, H to U) across six model ferritic iron GBs using density functional theory (DFT). From these data, we construct comprehensive elemental maps for solute segregation tendencies and cohesion at GBs, providing guidance for segregation engineering. We systematically assess the cohesive effects of different elements in all segregating positions along multiple fracture paths with a quantum-chemistry bond-order method as well as a modified Rice-Wang theory of interfacial cohesion. The effects of segregants on the cohesion of GBs are shown to vary drastically as a function of site character, and hence their induced cohesive effects must be considered as a thermodynamic average over the spectral energy distribution. Thus, models that overlook these aspects may fail to accurately predict the impacts of varying alloying concentrations, thermal processing conditions, or GB types. The insights presented here, along with our accompanying dataset, are expected to advance our understanding of GB segregation in steels and other materials.

Title: Quantum gas microscopy of three-flavor Hubbard systems
Authors: Jirayu Mongkolkiattichai, Liyu Liu, Sohail Dasgupta, Kaden R. A. Hazzard, Peter Schauss
Abstract: Hubbard systems are paradigmatic realizations of strongly correlated many-body systems. Introducing additional species breaks the SU(2) symmetry of the Hubbard model and leads to a wide variety of novel exotic quantum phases. Three-component fermionic systems are at the heart of model systems for quantum chromodynamics where the three components reflect the three flavors. Here, we extend quantum gas microscopy to three-flavor Fermi lattice gases in the Hubbard regime. Relying on site- and flavor-resolved detection, we study the phase diagram of the three-flavor Hubbard model and find signatures of flavor-selective localization and selective pairing at temperatures down to the tunneling energy scale. Our measurements are compared with numerical linked-cluster expansion calculations. Further increase of phase space density may enable the observation of a novel pair Mott phase at half filling, and shows a path towards the study of color superfluidity and other aspects of quantum chromodynamics.

Title: How pairing mechanism dictates topology in valley-polarized superconductors with Berry curvature
Authors: Julian May-Mann, Tobias Helbig, Trithep Devakul
Abstract: We investigate how the pairing mechanism influences topological superconductivity in valley-polarized systems with Berry curvature. We demonstrate that short-range attractive interactions, such as those mediated by phonons, favor superconducting states where the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) Chern number has the same sign as the Berry curvature. In contrast, overscreened repulsive interactions, as in the Kohn-Luttinger mechanism, favor superconducting states where the BdG Chern number has the opposite sign as the Berry curvature. We establish these trends in a fully controlled limit and apply them to a recently reported chiral superconductor in rhombohedral multilayer graphene. Our theory provides a concrete experimental criterion for distinguishing between different pairing mechanisms in valley-polarized topological superconductors.

Title: Ion mobility and segregation in seed surfaces subjected to cold plasma treatments
Authors: Alvaro Perea-Brenes, Natalia Ruiz-Pino, Francisco Yubero, Jose Luis Garcia, Agustín R. Gonzalez-Elipe, Ana Gomez-Ramirez, Antonio Prados, Carmen Lopez-Santos
Abstract: Plasma treatment of seeds is an efficient procedure to accelerate germination, to improve initial stages of plant growth and for protection against pathogens infection. Most studies relate these beneficial effects with biochemical modifications affecting the metabolism and genetical growth factors of seeds and young plants. Using barley seeds, in this work we investigate the redistribution of ions in the seed surface upon their treatment with cold air plasmas. In addition, we investigate the effect of plasma in the lixiviation of ions through the seeds hull when they are immersed in water. Ions re-distribution in the outer layers of air plasma treated seeds has been experimentally determined through X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy analysis in combination with chemical in-depth profiling with gas cluster ion beams. The results show that in the shallowest layers of the seed hull (at least up to a depth of 100 nm) there is an enrichment of K+ and Ca2+ ions, in addition to changes in the O/C and N/C atomic ratios. These data have been confirmed with the electron microscopy/fluorescence analysis of seed cuts. Observations have been accounted for by a Monte Carlo model simulating the electrostatic interactions that develop between the negative charge accumulated at the seed surface due to the interaction with the plasma sheath and the positive ions existing in the interior of seeds. Furthermore, it is shown that upon water immersion of plasma treated seeds mobilized ions tend to lixiviate more efficiently than in pristine seeds. The detection of a significant concentration of NO3- anions in the water has been attributed to a secondary reaction of nitrogen species incorporated into the seeds during plasma exposure with reactive oxygen species formed on their surface during this treatment. The implications of these findings for the improvement of germination capacity of seeds are discussed.

Title: GrainPaint: A multi-scale diffusion-based generative model for microstructure reconstruction of large-scale objects
Authors: Nathan Hoffman, Cashen Diniz, Dehao Liu, Theron Rodgers, Anh Tran, Mark Fuge
Abstract: Simulation-based approaches to microstructure generation can suffer from a variety of limitations, such as high memory usage, long computational times, and difficulties in generating complex geometries. Generative machine learning models present a way around these issues, but they have previously been limited by the fixed size of their generation area. We present a new microstructure generation methodology leveraging advances in inpainting using denoising diffusion models to overcome this generation area limitation. We show that microstructures generated with the presented methodology are statistically similar to grain structures generated with a kinetic Monte Carlo simulator, SPPARKS.

Title: Medusa 84 SiH -- A novel high Selectivity Electron Beam Resist for Diamond Quantum Technologies
Authors: Oliver Roman Opaluch, Sebastian Westrich, Nimba Oshnik, Philipp Fuchs, Jan Fait, Sandra Wolff, Harry Biller, Mandy Sendel, Christoph Becher, Elke Neu
Abstract: We investigate the novel electron beam resist Medusa 84 SiH by Allresist GmbH (Germany) for nanostructuring of single crystal diamond and its effects on the spin properties of nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in nanopillars as prototypes for photonic structures. We find contrast curves comparable to those of resists previously used for this task (Hydrogensilsequioxane FOx). We present a minimum selectivity for diamond etching of 6$\pm$1. Using an adhesion-promoting silicon interlayer enables fabrication yields of up to 98\%. We measure $T_2$ times of up to $\sim$25 $\mu$s before and after processing, demonstrating that the manufactured structures are usable for diamond-based quantum sensing.

Title: Leveraging Large Language Models to Address Data Scarcity in Machine Learning: Applications in Graphene Synthesis
Authors: Devi Dutta Biswajeet, Sara Kadkhodaei
Abstract: Machine learning in materials science faces challenges due to limited experimental data, as generating synthesis data is costly and time-consuming, especially with in-house experiments. Mining data from existing literature introduces issues like mixed data quality, inconsistent formats, and variations in reporting experimental parameters, complicating the creation of consistent features for the learning algorithm. Additionally, combining continuous and discrete features can hinder the learning process with limited data. Here, we propose strategies that utilize large language models (LLMs) to enhance machine learning performance on a limited, heterogeneous dataset of graphene chemical vapor deposition synthesis compiled from existing literature. These strategies include prompting modalities for imputing missing data points and leveraging large language model embeddings to encode the complex nomenclature of substrates reported in chemical vapor deposition experiments. The proposed strategies enhance graphene layer classification using a support vector machine (SVM) model, increasing binary classification accuracy from 39% to 65% and ternary accuracy from 52% to 72%. We compare the performance of the SVM and a GPT-4 model, both trained and fine-tuned on the same data. Our results demonstrate that the numerical classifier, when combined with LLM-driven data enhancements, outperforms the standalone LLM predictor, highlighting that in data-scarce scenarios, improving predictive learning with LLM strategies requires more than simple fine-tuning on datasets. Instead, it necessitates sophisticated approaches for data imputation and feature space homogenization to achieve optimal performance. The proposed strategies emphasize data enhancement techniques, offering a broadly applicable framework for improving machine learning performance on scarce, inhomogeneous datasets.

Title: Entanglement Transitions in Noisy Quantum Circuits on Trees
Authors: Vikram Ravindranath, Yiqiu Han, Xiao Chen
Abstract: Decoherence is ubiquitous, and poses a significant impediment to the observation of quantum phenomena, such as the measurement-induced entanglement phase transition (MIPT). In this work, we study entanglement transitions in quantum circuits on trees, subject to both noise and measurements. We uncover a rich phase diagram that describes the ability of a tree quantum circuit to retain quantum or classical information in the presence of decoherence. By developing a mapping between the dynamics of information on the tree to a classical Markov process -- also defined on the tree -- we obtain exact solutions to the entanglement transitions displayed by the circuit under various noise and measurement strengths. Moreover, we find a host of phenomena, including the MIPT, which are \textit{robust} to decoherence. The analytical tractability facilitated by the method developed in this paper showcases the first example of an exactly solvable noise-robust MIPT, and holds promise for studies on broader, tree-like circuits.

Title: High Harmonic Generation from a Noble Metal

Abstract: High-harmonic generation (HHG) in solids has typically been explored in transparent dielectrics and semiconductors. Metals have long been dismissed due to their strong reflectivity at infrared wavelengths. Here, we demonstrate HHG from silver - a noble metal - using few-cycle near-infrared laser pulses at near-normal incidence. Our results show that sub-cycle electron dynamics within the material's penetration depth can drive high-order harmonics, challenging the prevailing notion that metals are unsuited for infrared-driven strong-field processes. Despite silver's high reflectivity and large free-electron density, we observe nonperturbative harmonics extending into the extreme ultraviolet (up to 20 eV). Moreover, silver's multi-shot damage threshold proves surprisingly high (30 TW/cm^2) - comparable to large-bandgap dielectrics like magnesium oxide - thereby enabling intense strong-field processes in a metallic environment. Measuring the orientation dependence of the emitted harmonics reveals that the process arises from coherent electron dynamics in the crystal lattice, rather than from a plasma-driven mechanism. Time-dependent density-matrix simulations based on maximally localized Wannier functions show that low-order harmonics predominantly originate from conduction electrons near the Fermi surface (s- and p-type orbitals), whereas higher harmonics rely on bound d-electron excitations. These findings establish metals - long thought unfavorable for HHG - as a promising platform for ultrafast strong-field physics, extending high-harmonic spectroscopy to regimes in which lattice order and plasma formation directly intersect. This work expands the frontier of solid-state HHG to all-metallic attosecond pulse generation and underscores the potential of metals as robust XUV sources for advanced attosecond metrology.

Title: Many-Body Vertex Effects: Time-Dependent Interaction Kernel with Correlated Multi-Excitons in the Bethe-Salpeter Equation
Authors: Brian Cunningham
Abstract: Building on a beyond-GW many-body framework that incorporates higher-order vertex effects in the self-energy - giving rise to T-matrix and second-order exchange contributions - this approach is extended to the kernel in the Bethe-Salpeter Equation (BSE) for the reducible polarization. This results in a frequency-dependent interaction kernel that naturally captures random phase approximation (RPA) effects, dynamical excitonic interactions, and the correlated propagation of multiple correlated electron-hole pairs that model multi- (including bi- and tri-) excitonic effects, relevant for nonlinear optics and high harmonic generation. These processes emerge from including the functional derivatives of the screening and vertex with respect to the Greens function in the vertex, enabling a fully ab initio, time-dependent treatment of correlation effects. By focusing on the reducible rather than irreducible polarization, this approach provides a computationally viable framework for capturing complex many-body interactions for calculating the self-energy, optical spectra and EELS. The resulting interaction kernel is relatively straightforward and clearly delineates the physical processes that are included and omitted. The method is expected to facilitate the integration of advanced many-body effects into state-of-the-art software packages, offering a universal and highly accurate framework for the description of sub-atomic correlations. Such advancements are crucial for the development of semiconductor, optoelectronic, superconducting and antimatter technologies, and ensuring that theoretical modeling evolves alongside exascale and accelerated computing.

Title: Preparing Tetra-Digit Long-Range Entangled States via Unified Sequential Quantum Circuit
Authors: Yu-Tao Hu, Meng-Yuan Li, Peng Ye
Abstract: The quest to systematically prepare long-range entangled phases has gained momentum with advances in quantum circuit design, particularly through sequential quantum circuits (SQCs) that constrain entanglement growth via locality and depth constraints. This work introduces a \textit{unified} SQC framework to prepare ground states of Tetra-Digit (TD) quantum spin models -- a class of long-range entangled stabilizer codes labeled by a four-digit index $[d_n,d_s,d_l,D]$ -- which encompass Toric Codes across dimensions and the X-cube fracton phase as special cases. Featuring a hierarchical structure of entanglement renormalization group, TD models host spatially extended excitations (e.g., loops, membranes, and exotic non-manifold objects) with constrained mobility and deformability, and exhibit system-size-dependent ground state degeneracies that scale exponentially with a polynomial in linear sizes. We demonstrate the unified SQC through low-dimension examples first, graphically and algebraically, and then extend to general cases, with a detailed proof for the effectiveness of general SQC given in the appendix. With experimental feasibility via synthetic dimensions in quantum simulators, this framework bridges a great variety of gapped long-range entangled states cross dimensions through quantum circuits and shows plentiful mathematical and physical structures in TD models. Through unifying previously disparate preparation strategies, it offers a pathway toward engineered topological phases and fault-tolerant technologies.

Title: Quantum decoherence of nitrogen-vacancy spin ensembles in a nitrogen spin bath in diamond under dynamical decoupling
Authors: Huijin Park, Mykyta Onizhuk, Eunsang Lee, Harim Lim, Junghyun Lee, Sangwon Oh, Giulia Galli, Hosung Seo
Abstract: The negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond has emerged as a leading qubit platform for quantum technology applications. One of the key challenges for NV-based quantum applications is building an accurate model to predict its decoherence properties and their quantum nature. In this study, we combine theory and experiment to investigate NV decoherence dynamics in the presence of nitrogen donor (P1 center) baths, which is one of the dominant decoherence sources in diamond. We employ a cluster-correlation expansion (CCE) method to compute the NV decoherence under the Hahn-echo (HE) and Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) pulse sequences at various P1 concentrations from 1ppm to 300 ppm. We show that the coherence time (T2) increases with the number of pi pulses applied, indicating that the NV spin is decoupled from the P1 bath. Notably, we find that T2 scales quadratically as a function of the pulse number, on a logarithmic scale, as opposed to the linear scaling predicted by widely accepted semi-classical theories in the literature. In our experiment, we measure the CPMG signal for two diamond samples with high P1 concentrations of 0.8ppm and 13ppm. We demonstrate that the T2 scaling is indeed quadratic, thus confirming our theoretical predictions. Our results show that the quantum bath model combined with the CCE method can accurately capture the quantum nature of the P1-driven NV decoherence. Our study opens a new avenue for developing a complete noise model that could be used to optimize the performance of NV-based quantum devices.

Title: Step-by-step design guide of a cryogenic three-axis vector magnet
Authors: Gaia Da Prato, Yong Yu, Ronald Bode, Simon Gröblacher
Abstract: A tunable magnetic field at low temperatures is essential for numerous applications, including spintronics, magnetic resonance imaging, and condensed matter physics. While commercial superconducting vector magnets are available, they are complex, expensive, and often not adaptable to specific experimental needs. As a result, simple in-house designs are often being used in research environments. However, no comprehensive step-by-step guide for their construction currently exists. In this work, we provide a detailed manual for designing and building a cryogenically compatible three-axis vector magnet. The system is tested at the mixing chamber of a dilution refrigerator at temperatures ranging from 15 mK to 4 K, with no significant increase in base temperature. Safety measures are implemented to mitigate heating from quenching. The coils are successfully driven with DC currents as high as 3 A, generating magnetic fields of up to 2.5 T. Magnetic field measurements using Hall sensors demonstrate good agreement with the predictions of the designed performance.

Title: Metrological symmetries in singular quantum multi-parameter estimation
Authors: George Mihailescu, Saubhik Sarkar, Abolfazl Bayat, Steve Campbell, Andrew K. Mitchell
Abstract: The theoretical foundation of quantum sensing is rooted in the Cramér-Rao formalism, which establishes quantitative precision bounds for a given quantum probe. In many practical scenarios, where more than one parameter is unknown, the multi-parameter Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) applies. Since this is a matrix inequality involving the inverse of the quantum Fisher information matrix (QFIM), the formalism breaks down when the QFIM is singular. In this paper, we examine the physical origins of such singularities, showing that they result from an over-parametrization on the metrological level. This is itself caused by emergent metrological symmetries, whereby the same set of measurement outcomes are obtained for different combinations of system parameters. Although the number of effective parameters is equal to the number of non-zero QFIM eigenvalues, the Cramér-Rao formalism typically does not provide information about the effective parameter encoding. Instead, we demonstrate through a series of concrete examples that Bayesian estimation can provide deep insights. In particular, the metrological symmetries appear in the Bayesian posterior distribution as lines of persistent likelihood running through the space of unknown parameters. These lines are contour lines of the effective parameters which, through suitable parameter transformations, can be estimated and follow their own effective CRBs.

Title: Localized necking under global compression in two-scale metallic hierarchical solids
Authors: Naresh Chockalingam S., Narayan K. Sundaram
Abstract: Hierarchically structured cellular solids have attracted increasing attention for their superior mass-specific mechanical properties. Using a remeshing-based continuum finite element (FE) framework, we reveal that two-scale metallic hierarchical solids exhibit a distinct, localized deformation mode that involves necking and fracture of microscale tension members even at small global compressive strains (3-5%). The tensile failure is always preceded by plastic buckling of a complementary compression member. This combined necking-buckling (NB) mode critically underlies the collapse of hexagon-triangle (HTH) hierarchical lattices over a wide range of relative densities and length-scale ratios and is also seen in diamond-triangle (DTH) lattices. In lattices with very slender microscale members, necking is prevented by a competing failure mode that involves coordinated buckling (CB) of multiple members. Our custom remeshing FE framework is critical to resolve the localized large plastic strains, ductile failure, and complex local modes of deformation (including cusp formation) that are characteristic of the NB mode. A theoretical buckling analysis supports the inevitability of the NB and CB modes in HTH lattices. The occurrence of the NB mode has consequences for energy absorption by two-scale hierarchical solids, and hence influences their design.

Title: Note on surface defects in multiscalar critical models
Authors: Andrii Anataichuk, Sabine Harribey
Abstract: This paper studies generic surface defects for multiscalar critical models using a perturbative $\epsilon$ expansion in $4-\epsilon$ dimensions. The beta functions of the defect couplings for a generic multiscalar bulk with quartic interactions are computed at first non-trivial order in $\epsilon$. Specific bulks of interest are then considered: $O(N)$, hypercubic, hypertetrahdral, and biconical $O(m)\times O(n)$. In each case, we compute fixed points for the defect couplings and determine the remaining bulk symmetry. Expanding beyond the $O(N)$ model, we find a greater variety of patterns of symmetry breaking.

Title: Global graph features unveiled by unsupervised geometric deep learning
Authors: Mirja Granfors, Jesús Pineda, Blanca Zufiria Gerbolés, Joana B. Pereira, Carlo Manzo, Giovanni Volpe
Abstract: Graphs provide a powerful framework for modeling complex systems, but their structural variability makes analysis and classification challenging. To address this, we introduce GAUDI (Graph Autoencoder Uncovering Descriptive Information), a novel unsupervised geometric deep learning framework that captures both local details and global structure. GAUDI employs an innovative hourglass architecture with hierarchical pooling and upsampling layers, linked through skip connections to preserve essential connectivity information throughout the encoding-decoding process. By mapping different realizations of a system - generated from the same underlying parameters - into a continuous, structured latent space, GAUDI disentangles invariant process-level features from stochastic noise. We demonstrate its power across multiple applications, including modeling small-world networks, characterizing protein assemblies from super-resolution microscopy, analyzing collective motion in the Vicsek model, and capturing age-related changes in brain connectivity. This approach not only improves the analysis of complex graphs but also provides new insights into emergent phenomena across diverse scientific domains.

Title: Juggling with Tensor Bases in Functional Approaches
Authors: Jens Braun, Andreas Geißel, Jan M. Pawlowski, Franz R. Sattler, Nicolas Wink
Abstract: Systematic expansion schemes in functional approaches require the inclusion of higher order vertices. These vertices are expanded in independent tensor bases with a rapidly increasing number of basis elements. Amongst the related tasks are the construction of bases and projection operators, the importance ordering of their elements, and the optimisation of such tensor bases, as well as an analysis of their regularity in momentum space. We present progress in all these directions and introduce the Mathematica package TensorBases designed for the aforementioned tasks.

Title: Stability and reactivity of double icosahedron Ag$_{17}$M$_2$ (M=Ni, Cu, Zn) clusters
Authors: Peter Ludwig Rodríguez-Kessler
Abstract: Herein, the structure and stability of double icosahedron Ag$_{17}$M$_2$ (M = Ni, Cu, Zn) clusters are investigated using density functional theory (DFT) computations. The results indicate that the clusters favor endohedral configurations in the doublet state, as confirmed with four different functionals: BP86, PBE0, B3PW91, and TPSSh. Additionally, the doped clusters exhibit higher ionization energies and electronegativities compared those of the bare Ag$_{19}$ cluster. After doping, the ELF function increases at the Ag sites, which reveals important implications for catalysis.

Title: All-optical stochastic switching of magnetization textures in Fe$_3$Sn$_2$

Abstract: The all-optical control of magnetization at room temperature broadens the scope of applications of spin degrees-of-freedom in data storage, spintronics, and quantum computing. Topological magnetic spin structures, such as skyrmions, are of particular interest due to their particle-like properties, small size and inherent stability. Controlling skyrmion states without strong magnetic fields or large current densities would create new possibilities for their application. In this work, we utilize femtosecond optical pulses to alter the helicity of the spin configuration in dipolar skyrmions formed in the kagome magnet Fe$_3$Sn$_2$ in the absence of an external magnetic field and at room temperature. In situ Lorentz transmission electron microscopy is used to visualize the stochastic, light-induced switching process of chiral Néel caps, while the internal Bloch component of the dipolar skyrmions remain unchanged. In addition to this switching process, we observe the interconversion between type I skyrmionic and type II bubble configurations depending on the external magnetic field and illumination conditions. To corroborate the spin states and the light-induced magnetization dynamics, micromagnetic modelling and simulations of the resulting electron phase shift maps are conducted to elucidate the spin rearrangement induced by individual femtosecond optical pulses.

Title: Quantum State Designs from Minimally Random Quantum Circuits
Authors: Jonathon Riddell, Katja Klobas, Bruno Bertini
Abstract: Random many-body states are both a useful tool to model certain physical systems and an important asset for quantum computation. Realising them, however, generally requires an exponential (in system size) amount of resources. Recent research has presented a way out by showing that one can generate random states, or more precisely a controlled approximation of them, by applying a quantum circuit built in terms of few-body unitary gates. Most of this research, however, has been focussed on the case of quantum circuits composed by completely random unitary gates. Here we consider what happens for circuits that, instead, involve a minimal degree of randomness. Specifically, we concentrate on two different settings: (a) brickwork quantum circuits with a single one-qudit random matrix at a boundary; (b) brickwork quantum circuits with fixed interactions but random one-qudit gates everywhere. We show that, for any given initial state, (a) and (b) produce a distribution of states approaching the Haar distribution in the limit of large circuit depth. More precisely, we show that the moments of the distribution produced by our circuits can approximate the ones of the Haar distribution in a depth proportional to the system size. Interestingly we find that in both Cases (a) and (b) the relaxation to the Haar distribution occurs in two steps - this is in contrast with what happens in fully random circuits. Moreover, we show that choosing appropriately the fixed interactions, for example taking the local gate to be a dual-unitary gate with high enough entangling power, minimally random circuits produce a Haar random distribution more rapidly than fully random circuits. In particular, dual-unitary circuits with maximal entangling power - i.e. perfect tensors - appear to provide the optimal quantum state design preparation for any design number.

Title: A new nanometre resolution method for probing densification ratio at nanoindentation sites in glass: Unravelling discrepancies in the literature
Authors: J.-P. Guin, V. Keryvin, L. Charleux, K. Han, J.-C. Sangleboeuf, M. Ferry
Abstract: The region of permanent densification beneath a Berkovich indentation imprint in silica glass is investigated using a novel chemical dissolution technique. The use of the similitude regime in sharp indentation testing allows one to record reliable data with a good spatial resolution that makes it possible to deal with low loads (typically below 10 mN) and, more importantly, crack-free imprints. The densified zone dissolves more quickly than the non densified regions. The analysis of the results, along the vertical axis, indicates that the densification zone is rather homogeneous with a steep transition to the non densified zone. The size of the densification zone, with respect to the initial free surface, is estimated to be around two times the maximum penetration depth of the instrumented indentation test. These findings are compared with those obtained by numerical simulations using different constitutive equations from the literature. A very good concordance between Raman spectroscopy and chemical probe results is found for imprints made with no or few cracking events during indentation testing.

Title: Signature of BKT-like spin transport in a quasi-2D antiferromagnet BaNi$_2$V$_2$O$_8$
Authors: Kurea Nakagawa, Minoru Kanega, Tomoyuki Yokouchi, Masahiro Sato, Yuki Shiomi
Abstract: In two-dimensional (2D) spin systems, the augmentation of spin fluctuations gives rise to quasi-long-range order; however, how they manifest in spin transport remains unclear. Here we investigate the spin Seebeck effect (SSE) in a quasi-2D antiferromagnet, BaNi$_2$V$_2$O$_8$, which has been reported to exhibit the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition owing to its distinct 2D nature. We found that the SSE in Pt / BaNi$_2$V$_2$O$_8$ persists well above the Néel temperature, significantly different from the behavior of 3D ordered magnets. Our numerical analysis for a 2D microscopic spin model supports the hypothesis that the observed SSE is linked to strong magnetic correlations in the BKT-like phase.

Title: Spin Seebeck Effect as a Probe for Majorana Fermions in Kitaev Spin Liquids
Authors: Yasuyuki Kato, Joji Nasu, Masahiro Sato, Tsuyoshi Okubo, Takahiro Misawa, Yukitoshi Motome
Abstract: Quantum entanglement in strongly correlated electron systems often leads to exotic elementary excitations. Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) provide a paradigmatic example, where the elementary excitations are described by fractional quasiparticles such as spinons. However, such fractional quasiparticles behave differently from electrons, making their experimental identification challenging. Here, we theoretically investigate the spin Seebeck effect, which is a thermoelectric response via a spin current, as an efficient probe of the fractional quasiparticles in QSLs, focusing on the Kitaev honeycomb model. By comprehensive studies using the real-time dynamics, the perturbation theory, and the linear spin-wave theory based on the tunnel spin-current theory, we find that the spin current is induced by thermal gradient in the Kitaev spin liquid, via the low-energy fractional Majorana excitations. This underscores the ability of Majorana fermions to carry spin current, despite lacking spin angular momentum. Furthermore, we find that the induced spin current changes its sign depending on the sign of the Kitaev interaction, indicating that the Majorana fermions contribute to the spin current with (up-)down-spin like nature when the exchange coupling is (anti)ferromagnetic. Thus, in contrast to the negative spin current already found in a one-dimensional QSL, our finding reveals that the spin Seebeck effect can exhibit either positive or negative signals, contingent upon the nature of fractional excitations in the QSLs. We also clarify contrasting field-angle dependence between the Kitaev spin liquid in the low-field limit and the high-field ferromagnetic state, which is useful for the experimental identification. Our finding suggests that the spin Seebeck effect could be used not only to detect fractional quasiparticles emerging in QSLs but also to generate and control them.

Title: Characterizing Dynamic Majorana Hybridization for Universal Quantum Computing
Authors: Themba Hodge, Eric Mascot, Dan Crawford, Stephan Rachel
Abstract: Qubits built out of Majorana zero modes (MZMs) have long been theorized as a potential pathway toward fault-tolerant topological quantum computation. Almost unavoidable in these processes is Majorana wavefunction overlap, known as hybridization, which arise throughout the process when Majorana modes get close to each other. This breaks the ground state degeneracy, leading to qubit errors in the braiding process. This work presents a simple but precise method to predict qubit errors for dynamic hybridization which varies in space and time. This includes hybridization between four or more MZMs through topological or trivial regions, or both of them. As an illustration, we characterize qubit-errors for an X-gate. We demonstrate how to utilize the hybridization to implement not only arbitrary one-qubit rotations but also a two-qubit controlled variable phase gate, providing a demonstration of universal quantum computing.

Title: Classical origins of Landau-incompatible transitions
Authors: Abhishodh Prakash, Nick G. Jones
Abstract: Continuous phase transitions where symmetry is spontaneously broken are ubiquitous in physics and often found between `Landau-compatible' phases where residual symmetries of one phase are a subset of the other. However, continuous `deconfined quantum critical' transitions between Landau-incompatible symmetry-breaking phases are known to exist in certain quantum systems, often with anomalous microscopic symmetries. In this Letter, we investigate the need for such special conditions. We show that Landau-incompatible transitions can be found in a family of well-known classical statistical mechanical models with anomaly-free symmetries, introduced by José, Kadanoff, Kirkpatrick and Nelson (Phys. Rev. B 16, 1217). The models are anisotropic deformations of the classical 2d XY model labelled by a positive integer $Q$. For a range of temperatures, even $Q$ models exhibit two Landau-incompatible partial symmetry-breaking phases and a direct transition between them for $Q \ge 4$. Characteristic features of deconfined quantum criticality, such as enhanced symmetries and melting of charged defects are easily seen in a classical setting. For odd $Q$, and corresponding temperature ranges, two regions of a single partial symmetry-breaking phase appear, split by a stable `unnecessary critical' line. We discuss experimental systems that realize these transitions and present anomaly-free quantum models that also exhibit similar phase diagrams.

Title: Dynamical phase transitions in two-dimensional Brownian Matter
Authors: Nathan O Silvano, Daniel G. Barci
Abstract: We investigate collective behavior of a system of two-dimensional interacting Brownian particles in the hydrodynamic regime. By means of the Martin-Siggia-Rose-Jenssen-de Dominicis formalism, we built up a generating functional for correlations functions. In the continuum limit, we uncover an exact symmetry under area-preserving diffeomorphism transformations that characterizes a liquid state. This symmetry leads to the conservation of local vorticity. By computing the generating functional within the saddle-point plus Gaussian fluctuations approximation, we reveal the emergence of a $U(1)$ gauge symmetry that allows us to describe the dynamics of density fluctuations as a gauge theory. We solve the corresponding equations of motion for short as well as long ranged interactions showing up the presence of multiple dynamical regimes and associated dynamical phase transitions, even for pure repulsive interactions.

Title: Partial yet definite emergence of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang class in isotropic spin chains
Authors: Kazumasa A. Takeuchi, Kazuaki Takasan, Ofer Busani, Patrik L. Ferrari, Romain Vasseur, Jacopo De Nardis
Abstract: Integrable spin chains with a continuous non-Abelian symmetry, such as the one-dimensional isotropic Heisenberg model, show superdiffusive transport with little theoretical understanding. Although recent studies reported a surprising connection to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class in that case, this view was most recently questioned by discrepancies in full counting statistics. Here, by combining extensive numerical simulations of classical and quantum integrable isotropic spin chains with a framework developed by exact studies of the KPZ class, we characterize various two-point quantities that remain hitherto unexplored in spin chains, and find full agreement with KPZ scaling laws without adjustable parameters. This establishes the partial emergence of the KPZ class in integrable isotropic spin chains. Moreover, we reveal that the KPZ scaling laws are intact in the presence of an energy current, under the appropriate Galilean boost required by the propagation of spacetime correlation.

Abstract: The concept of spin symmetries has gained renewed interest as a valuable tool for classifying unconventional magnetic phases, including altermagnets and recently identified p-wave magnets. In this work, we show that in compounds with weak spin-orbit coupling, the dominant spin and charge photoresponse is determined by spin group rather than the conventional magnetic group symmetry. As a concrete realization we consider the nonlinear shift photocurrent in Mn$_5$Si$_3$, a material that features the two possible classes of unconventional p-wave magnetism in the form of two competing spin structures, a coplanar and non-coplanar one. While both are predicted to generate shift currents based on magnetic symmetry considerations, only the non-coplanar configuration survives the spin symmetry requirements. This is numerically confirmed by our $\textit{ab-initio}$ calculations, providing a protocol to experimentally identify the spin configuration of this promising material in photogalvanic or transport measurements.

Title: Quantum Geometry Probed by Chiral Excitonic Optical Response of Chern Insulators
Authors: Wen-Xuan Qiu, Fengcheng Wu
Abstract: We theoretically derive the sum rule for the negative first moment of the absorptive optical conductivity with excitonic effects and establish its connection to the quantum weight $K$ and Chern number $C$ of the ground state. Applying this framework, we investigate the excitonic optical response of the Chern insulator at hole filling factor $\nu=1$ in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$. A single chiral exciton state, which selectively absorbs circularly polarized light of a specific handedness, dominates the optical sum rule. The chiral exciton state comprises two types of interlayer electron-hole transitions, which cancel out the total out-of-plane dipole moment. The absorption spectrum shows nearly perfect magnetic circular dichroism, which can be attributed to the nearly saturated bound $K \ge |C|$ of the Chern insulator under study. Our work illustrates the potential of using excitonic optical responses to probe quantum geometry encoded by $K$ and $C$ of Chern insulators in moiré superlattices.

Title: Scattering theory of thermal and bipolar thermoelectric diodes
Authors: José Balduque, Rafael Sánchez
Abstract: We investigate the minimal requirements that induce a nonreciprocal response to temperature differences in a mesoscopic electronic conductor. We identify two distinct mechanisms due electron-electron interactions, namely inelastic scattering and screening, to locally affect the internal temperature and potential of the device, leading to thermal and thermoelectric rectification effects in the presence of an inversion symmetry breaking. We propose resonant tunneling samples to efficiently exploit these effects, and find configurations acting as bipolar thermoelectric diodes whose current flows in the same direction irrespective of the sign of the temperature difference, either due to thermalization or to screening controlled quantum interference.

Title: DFT+DMFT investigation of the magnetic phase transition in the itinerant ferromagnet Fe$_{3}$GaTe$_{2}$
Authors: Yuanji Xu, Xintao Jin, Jiacheng Xiang, Huiyuan Zhang, Fuyang Tian
Abstract: Finding and designing ferromagnets that operate above room temperature is crucial in advancing high-performance spintronic devices. The pioneering van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnet Fe$_{3}$GaTe$_{2}$ has extended the way for spintronic applications by achieving a record-high Curie temperature among its analogues. However, the physical mechanism of increasing Curie temperature in this material still needs to be explored. Here, we systematically investigate the electronic structures and magnetic properties of Fe$_{3}$GaTe$_{2}$ as a function of temperature using strongly correlated calculations, reconciling the dual nature of $d$-electrons with both localization and itinerant characters. Significantly, our study reveals the emergence of quasi-particle flat bands driven by many-body interactions, which enhance magnetic stability through a positive feedback mechanism. Furthermore, our results demonstrate the hybridization of these flat bands at low temperatures, indicating the possible presence of heavy fermion behavior in this system. Our findings suggest that tunable flat bands near the Fermi level may serve as a key factor in realizing materials with high magnetic transition temperatures and strong magnetic anisotropy. This research provides a promising pathway for exploring next-generation spintronic devices utilizing vdW flat band systems.

Title: Strong effects of thermally induced low-spin-to-high-spin crossover on transport properties of correlated metals
Authors: Johanna Moser, Jernej Mravlje, Markus Aichhorn
Abstract: We use dynamical mean-field theory to study how electronic transport in multi-orbital metals is influenced by correlated (nominally) empty orbitals that are in proximity to the Fermi level. Specifically, we study 2 + 1 orbital and 3 + 2 orbital (i.e. t2g + eg ) models on a Bethe lattice with a crystal field that is set so that the higher lying orbitals are nearly empty at low temperatures but get a non-negligible occupancy at elevated temperature. The high temperature regime is characterized by thermal activation of carriers leading to higher magnetic response (i.e., thermally induced low-spin to high-spin transition) and substantial influence on resistivity, where one can distinguish two counteracting effects: increased scattering due to formation of high spin and increased scattering phase space on one hand, and additional parallel conduction channel on the other. The former effect is stronger and one may identify cases where resistivity increases by a factor of three at high temperatures even though the occupancy of the unoccupied band remains small (< 10%). We discuss implications of our findings for transport properties of correlated materials.

Title: On the $q$-generalised multinomial/divergence correspondence
Authors: Keisuke Okamura
Abstract: The asymptotic correspondence between the probability mass function of the $q$-deformed multinomial distribution and the $q$-generalised Kullback-Leibler divergence, also known as Tsallis relative entropy, is established. The probability mass function is generalised using the $q$-deformed algebra developed within the framework of nonextensive statistics, leading to the emergence of a family of divergence measures in the asymptotic limit as the system size increases. The coefficients in the asymptotic expansion yield Tsallis relative entropy as the leading-order term when $q$ is interpreted as an entropic parameter. Furthermore, higher-order expansion coefficients naturally introduce new divergence measures, extending Tsallis relative entropy through a one-parameter generalisation. Some fundamental properties of these extended divergences are also explored.

Title: Dynamical nonlinear optical response in time-periodic quantum systems
Authors: S. Sajad Dabiri, Reza Asgari
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical framework for calculating the linear and nonlinear optical responses of time-periodic quantum systems. Using density matrix evolution in the Floquet basis and adopting the length gauge, our approach incorporates both interband and intraband contributions of the position operator, enabling detailed insights into photon-assisted transitions and their associated optical phenomena. Notably, we identify a divergent ac response to dc fields in Floquet systems, reminiscent of a Drude peak at finite frequencies. This framework generalizes to optical tensor conductivity calculations at arbitrary perturbation orders and captures various DC photocurrents, including shift current, injection current, and Berry dipole contributions, under specific limits. To demonstrate the versatility of our method, we compute linear and nonlinear optical conductivities for one- and two-dimensional systems, revealing phenomena such as band inversions, j-photon-assisted transitions, and high harmonic generation. These results highlight the interplay between periodic driving and nonlinear optical effects, offering different avenues for exploring dynamical topological properties and their applications in ultrafast spintronics, optoelectronics, and strongly correlated systems. Our findings provide a robust platform for analyzing the complex optical behavior of driven quantum systems and guiding experimental investigations in this rapidly evolving field.

Title: Capture and release of quantum vortices using mechanical devices in low-temperature superfluids
Authors: Sanjay Shukla, Giorgio Krstulovic, Rahul Pandit
Abstract: We show that the Gross-Pitaevskii equation coupled with the wave equation for a wire (GP-W) provides a natural theoretical framework for understanding recent experiments employing a nanowire to detect a single quantum vortex in superfluid $^4 {\rm He}$. We uncover the complete spatiotemporal evolution of such wire-based vortex detection via direct numerical simulations of the GP-W system. Furthermore, by computing the spatiotemporal spectrum, we obtain the vortex-capture-induced change in the oscillation frequency of the wire. We quantify this frequency shift by plotting the wire's oscillation frequency versus time and obtain results that closely match experimental observations. In addition, we provide analytical support for our numerical results by deriving the dispersion relation for the oscillating wire, with and without a trapped vortex. We show that the Magnus force opens a gap in the wire dispersion relation. The size of the gap becomes the characteristic frequency of the wire when a vortex is trapped.

Title: Floquet engineering of effective pairing interactions in a doped band insulator
Authors: Yugo Takahashi, Hideo Miyamoto, Kazuhiko Kuroki, Tatsuya Kaneko
Abstract: We investigate the pairing state in a doped band insulator under a periodic driving field. We employ a correlated fermionic model on a honeycomb lattice, in which pairing glue is obtainable via repulsive interactions, and derive an effective model under circularly polarized light. We demonstrate that the effective pairing interaction for doped fermions obtained with the second-order perturbation theory is tunable by the frequency and amplitude of the driving field. We find the optimal frequency range to enhance the pairing interaction and show that the modified effective system can strengthen the two-body bound state. Our study suggests that external driving light can reinforce superconducting pair states in strongly correlated electron systems.

Title: Towards an ab initio theory of high-temperature superconductors: a study of multilayer cuprates
Authors: Benjamin Bacq-Labreuil, Benjamin Lacasse, André-Marie S. Tremblay, David Sénéchal, Kristjan Haule
Abstract: Significant progress towards a theory of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates has been achieved via the study of effective one- and three-band Hubbard models. Nevertheless, material-specific predictions, while essential for constructing a comprehensive theory, remain challenging due to the complex relationship between real materials and the parameters of the effective models. By combining cluster dynamical mean-field theory and density functional theory in a charge-self-consistent manner, here we show that the goal of material-specific predictions for high-temperature superconductors from first principles is within reach. We take on the challenge of explaining the remarkable physics of multilayer cuprates by focusing on the two representative Ca$_{(1+n)}$Cu$_{n}$O$_{2n}$Cl$_2$ and HgBa$_2$Ca$_{(n-1)}$Cu$_n$O$_{(2n+2)}$ families. We shed light on the microscopic origin of many salient features of multilayer cuprates, in particular the $n$-dependence of their superconducting properties. The maximum of $T_c$ for the tri-layer compounds is explained by an intertwined analysis of the charge-transfer gap, superexchange $J$, and inhomogeneous doping between the CuO$_{2}$ planes. We highlight the existence of a minimal doping (4\%) required for superconductivity to emerge. We capture material-specific properties such as the larger propensity of HgBa$_2$Ca$_{(n-1)}$Cu$_n$O$_{(2n+2)}$ to superconduct compared with Ca$_{(1+n)}$Cu$_{n}$O$_{2n}$Cl$_2$. We also find the coexistence of arcs and pockets observed with photoemission, the charge redistribution between copper and oxygen, and the link to the pseudogap. Our work establishes a framework for comprehensive studies of cuprates, enables detailed comparisons with experiment, and, through its \emph{ab initio} settings, unlocks opportunities for theoretical material design of high-temperature superconductors.

Title: Harris-Luck criterion in the plateau transition of the Integer Quantum Hall Effect
Authors: Hrant Topchyan, Win Nuding, Andreas Klümper, Ara Sedrakyan
Abstract: The Harris criterion imposes a constraint on the critical behavior of a system upon introduction of new disorder, based on its dimension $d$ and localization length exponent $\nu$. It states that the new disorder can be relevant only if $d \nu < 2$. We analyze the applicability of the Harris criterion to the GKNS network disorder formulated in the paper [I. A. Gruzberg, A. Klümper, W. Nuding, and A. Sedrakyan, Phys. Rev. B 95, 125414 (2017)] and show that the fluctuations of the geometry are relevant despite $d \nu> 2$, implying that Harris criterion should be modified. We have observed that the fluctuations of the critical point in different quenched configurations of disordered network blocks is of order $L^0$, i.e.~it does not depend on block size $L$ in contrast to the expectation based on the Harris criterion that they should decrease as $L^{-d/2}$ according to the central limit theorem. Since $L^0 > (x-x_c)$ is always satisfied near the critical point, the mentioned network disorder is relevant and the critical indices of the system can be changed. We have also shown that the GKNS disordered network is fundamentally different from Voronoi-Delaunay and dynamically triangulated random lattices: the probability of higher connectivity in the GKNS network decreases in a power law as opposed to an exponential, indicating that we are dealing with a ``scale free" network, such as the Internet, protein-protein interactions, etc.

Title: Anomalous-Hall Neel textures in altermagnetic materials
Authors: Rui-Chun Xiao, Hui Li, Hui Han, Wei Gan, Mengmeng Yang, Ding-Fu Shao, Shu-Hui Zhang, Yang Gao, Mingliang Tian, Jianhui Zhou
Abstract: Recently, the altermagnets, a new kind of colinear antiferromagnet with zero net magnetization and momentum-dependent spin-splitting of bands, have sparked great interest. Despite simple magnetic structures, these altermagnets exhibit intriguing and intricate dependence of AHE on the Néel vector, in contrast to the conventional perpendicular configuration of Hall current with magnetization in ferromagnets. In spite of being a crucial aspect in AHE research, the relationship between the AHE and the Néel vector remains largely elusive. Here, we propose a powerful "extrinsic parameter" method and further reveal diverse unconventional anomalous Hall textures in the Néel vector space, dubbed anomalous-Hall Néel textures (AHNTs) for altermagnets. Notably, we find that AHNTs resemble the spin textures in momentum space, and further reveal their symmetry origin. We identify 10 types across four categories of AHNTs in altermagnets. Meanwhile, we examine our key discoveries in prototypical altermagnets. Our work offers a complete classification of AHNTs and a thorough understanding of AHE in altermagnets.

Title: Higher-dimensional magnetic Skyrmions
Authors: Sven Bjarke Gudnason, Stefano Bolognesi, Roberto Menta
Abstract: We propose a generalization of the theory of magnetic Skyrmions in chiral magnets in two dimensions to a higher-dimensional theory with magnetic Skyrmions in three dimensions and an $S^3$ target space, requiring a 4-dimensional magnetization vector. A physical realization of our theory could be made using a synthetic dimension, recently promoted and realized in condensed matter physics. In the simplest incarnation of the theory, we find a Skyrmion and a sphaleron - the latter being an unstable soliton. Including also the Skyrme term in the theory enriches the spectrum to a small metastable Skyrmion, an unstable sphaleron and a large stable Skyrmion.

Title: Correction-to-scaling exponent for percolation and the Fortuin--Kasteleyn Potts model in two dimensions
Authors: Yihao Xu, Tao Chen, Zongzheng Zhou, Jesús Salas, Youjin Deng
Abstract: The number $n_s$ of clusters (per site) of size $s$, a central quantity in percolation theory, displays at criticality an algebraic scaling behavior of the form $n_s\simeq s^{-\tau}\, A\, (1+B s^{-\Omega})$. For the Fortuin--Kasteleyn representation of the $Q$-state Potts model in two dimensions, the Fisher exponent $\tau$ is known as a function of the real parameter $0\le Q\le4$, and, for bond percolation (the $Q\rightarrow 1$ limit), the correction-to-scaling exponent is derived as $\Omega=72/91$. We theoretically derive the exact formula for the correction-to-scaling exponent $\Omega=8/[(2g+1)(2g+3)]$ as a function of the Coulomb-gas coupling strength $g$, which is related to $Q$ by $Q=2+2\cos(2 \pi g)$. Using an efficient Monte Carlo cluster algorithm, we study the O($n$) loop model on the hexagonal lattice, which is in the same universality class as the $Q=n^2$ Potts model, and has significantly suppressed finite-size corrections and critical slowing-down. The predictions of the above formula include the exact value for percolation as a special case and agree well with the numerical estimates of $\Omega$ for both the critical and tricritical branches of the Potts model.

Title: Quantum transport of Dirac fermions in selected graphene nanosystems away from the charge-neutrality point
Authors: Adam Rycerz
Abstract: Peculiar electronic properties of graphene, including the universal dc conductivity and the pseudodiffusive shot noise, are usually attributed to a small vicinity of the charge-neutrality point, away from which electron's effective mass raises, and nanostructures in graphene start to behave similarly to familiar Sharvin contacts in semiconducting heterostructures hosting two-dimensional electron gas. Using the effective Dirac equation for low-energy excitations it can be shown that, as long as abrupt potential steps separate the sample area from the leads, graphene-specific features can be identified even relatively far from the charge-neutrality point. Namely, the conductance is reduced, comparing to the standard Sharvin value, whereas the shot noise is amplified. Here, we confront the results of earlier analytic considerations with numerical simulations of quantum transport on the honeycomb lattice, for selected systems for which considerations starting from the Dirac equation cannot be directly adapted. For a wedge-shape constriction with zigzag edges and approximately square shape of the narrowest section, the transport characteristics can be tuned from graphene-specific sub-Sharvin values to standard Sharvin values, depending on whether the electrostatic potential profile in the narrowest section is rectangular or smooth. The half-Corbino disk with rectangular potential profile exhibits both the conductance and the noise close to the sub-Sharvin values. For a circular quantum dot with two narrow openings and irregular edges, the conductance is close to the Sharvin value, and the Fano factor approaches the value of $F=1/4$. This suggests that, in experimental attempt to verify the predictions for sub-Sharvin transport regime, one should focus rather on nanosystems, for which the scatterings on edges are insignificant next to the scatterings on sample-lead interfaces.

Title: CrystalGRW: Generative Modeling of Crystal Structures with Targeted Properties via Geodesic Random Walks

Abstract: Determining whether a candidate crystalline material is thermodynamically stable depends on identifying its true ground-state structure, a central challenge in computational materials science. We introduce CrystalGRW, a diffusion-based generative model on Riemannian manifolds that proposes novel crystal configurations and can predict stable phases validated by density functional theory. The crystal properties, such as fractional coordinates, atomic types, and lattice matrices, are represented on suitable Riemannian manifolds, ensuring that new predictions generated through the diffusion process preserve the periodicity of crystal structures. We incorporate an equivariant graph neural network to also account for rotational and translational symmetries during the generation process. CrystalGRW demonstrates the ability to generate realistic crystal structures that are close to their ground states with accuracy comparable to existing models, while also enabling conditional control, such as specifying a desired crystallographic point group. These features help accelerate materials discovery and inverse design by offering stable, symmetry-consistent crystal candidates for experimental validation.

Title: Impact of phonon lifetimes on the single-photon indistinguishability in quantum emitters based on 2D materials
Authors: Alexander Steinhoff, Steffen Wilksen, Ivan Solovev, Christian Schneider, Christopher Gies
Abstract: Localized excitons in two-dimensional (2D) materials are considered as promising sources of single photons on demand. The photon indistinguishability as key figure of merit for quantum information processing is strongly influenced by the coupling of charge excitations to lattice vibrations of the surrounding semiconductor material. Here, we quantify the impact of exciton-acoustic-phonon-interaction and cavity QED effects on photon indistinguishability in a Hong-Ou-Mandel setup by solving fully quantum mechanical equations for the coupled QD-cavity-phonon system including non-Markovian effects. We find a strong reduction of indistinguishability compared to 3D systems due to increased exciton-phonon coupling efficiency. Moreover, we show that the coherence properties of photons are significantly influenced by the finite phonon lifetime in the surrounding material giving rise to pure dephasing. Only if these limitations are overcome, localized excitons in 2D semiconductors can become a new avenue for quantum light sources.

Title: Revisiting the phonon theory of liquid heat capacity: low-frequency shear modes and intramolecular vibrations
Authors: Yu Liu, Matteo Baggioli
Abstract: Modeling the heat capacity of liquids present fundamental difficulties due to the strong intermolecular particle interactions and large diffusive-like displacements. Based on the experimental evidence that the microscopic dynamics of liquids closely resemble those of solids, a phonon theory of liquid thermodynamics has been developed. Despite its success, the phonon theory of liquids relies on the questionable assumption that low-frequency shear excitations are propagating in nature and follow a Debye density of states. Furthermore, the same framework does not capture the contribution of intramolecular vibrations, which play a significant role in molecular liquids. In this work, we revisit the phonon theory of liquid heat capacity, introducing alternative approaches to model low-frequency shear modes. In particular, we consider the recently proposed idea of treating such modes as pure kinetic and we propose a novel approach based on identifying those low-frequency excitations as overdamped liquid-like modes with linear in frequency density of states. Moreover, we complete the theory by incorporating the effects of intramolecular vibrations. By comparing the theoretical predictions from these different approaches with the available data for the heat capacity of several liquids, we present a comprehensive evaluation of the original model and the newly proposed extensions. Despite all approaches perform well at low-temperatures, our results indicate that modeling low-frequency modes as overdamped liquid-like excitations yields the most accurate agreement with the data in the whole temperature range. Conversely, we demonstrate that treating these excitations as purely gas-like leads to significant inaccuracies, particularly at high temperatures.

Title: Elastic constants of single-crystalline NiTi studied by resonant ultrasound spectroscopy

Abstract: Contactless, laser-based resonant ultrasound spectroscopy was utilized to monitor changes in elastic properties in single-crystalline NiTi shape memory alloy. It was observed that the elastic behavior of the temperature-induced B19$^\prime$ martensite, which is formed by a fine mixture of variants, adopts the symmetry elements of the parent austenite phase, and thus, the changes over the transformation temperature can be represented by the temperature evolution of three cubic elastic coefficients. The experiments confirm that the transition during the cooling run is preceded by pronounced softening of the $c_{44}$ elastic coefficient, which leads to nearly complete vanishing of elastic anisotropy prior to the transition. Below the transition, this coefficient remains soft, and the character of anisotropy switches from $c_{44}/c^\prime>1$ to $c_{44}/c^\prime<1$. We rationalize this behavior from the mechanical instability of the B19$^\prime$ lattice with respect to shears along the (001)$_{B19^\prime}$ plane, which is known from first-principles calculations.

Title: Quantum Turbulence Across Dimensions: Crossover from two- to three-dimension
Authors: Weican Yang, Xin Wang, Makoto Tsubota
Abstract: We investigate the dynamic transition of quantum turbulence (QT) in a confined potential field as the system evolves from purely two-dimensional (2D) to quasi-two-dimensional, and ultimately to three-dimensional (3D), by fixing the lateral dimensions of the trapping box while varying its height. In the 2DQT, distinct Onsager vortex cluster formation and inverse energy cascade are observed, while 3DQT exhibits a direct energy cascade consistent with the Vinen turbulence decay rate, which display striking differences. By systematically altering the system height, we explore how dimensionality drives the differentiation of turbulence types and find that this transition is closely related to the excitation of Kelvin waves. Kelvin waves not only introduce additional dissipation mechanisms but also serve as mediators for direct energy transfer across scales. When the wavelength of the permitted Kelvin waves exceeds the critical size of vortex clusters, turbulence begins transitioning to 3D type, culminating in fully developed 3DQT at the characteristic scale. In the transitional region, we observe continuous variations in the decay rate and vortex cluster correlation functions.

Title: Cove-edged Chiral Graphene Nanoribbons with Chirality-Dependent Bandgap and Carrier Mobility
Authors: K. Liu, W. Zheng, S. Osella, Z. Qiu, S. Böckmann, W. Niu, L. Meingast, H. Komber, S. Obermann, R. Gillen, M. Bonn, M. R. Hansen, J. Maultzsch, H. I. Wang, J. Ma, X. Feng
Abstract: Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) have garnered significant interest due to their highly customizable physicochemical properties and potential utility in nanoelectronics. Besides controlling widths and edge structures, the inclusion of chirality in GNRs brings another dimension for fine-tuning their optoelectronic properties, but related studies remain elusive owing to the absence of feasible synthetic strategies. Here, we demonstrate a novel class of cove-edged chiral GNRs (CcGNRs) with a tunable chiral vector (n,m). Notably, the bandgap and effective mass of (n,2)- CcGNR show a distinct positive correlation with the increasing value of n, as indicated by theory. Within this GNR family, two representative members, namely, (4,2)- CcGNR and (6,2)-CcGNR, are successfully synthesized. Both CcGNRs exhibit prominently curved geometries arising from the incorporated [4]helicene motifs along their peripheries, as also evidenced by the single-crystal structures of the two respective model compounds (1 and 2). The chemical identities and optoelectronic properties of (4,2)- and (6,2)-CcGNRs are comprehensively investigated via a combination of IR, Raman, solid-state NMR, UV-vis, and THz spectroscopies as well as theoretical calculations. In line with theoretical expectation, the obtained (6,2)-CcGNR possesses a low optical bandgap of 1.37 eV along with charge carrier mobility of 8 cm2/Vs, whereas (4,2)-CcGNR exhibits a narrower bandgap of 1.26 eV with increased mobility of 14 cm2/Vs. This work opens up a new avenue to precisely engineer the bandgap and carrier mobility of GNRs by manipulating their chiral vector.

Title: Unveiling the Interfacial Reconstruction Mechanism Enabling Stable Growth of the Delafossite PdCoO2 on Al2O3 and LaAlO3
Authors: Anna Scheid, Tobias Heil, Y. Eren Suyolcu, Qi song, Niklas Enderlein, Arnaud P. Nono Tchiomo, Prosper Ngabonziza, Philipp Hansmann, Darrell G. Schlom, Peter A. van Aken
Abstract: Delafossites, comprised of noble metal (A+) and strongly correlated sublayers (BO2-), form natural superlattices with highly anisotropic properties. These properties hold significant promise for various applications, but their exploitation hinges on the successful growth of high-quality thin films on suitable substrates. Unfortunately, the unique lattice geometry of delafossites presents a significant challenge to thin-film fabrication. Different delafossites grow differently, even when deposited on the same substrate, ranging from successful epitaxy to complete growth suppression. These variations often lack a clear correlation to obvious causes like lattice mismatch. Unidentified stabilization mechanisms appear to enable growth in certain cases, allowing these materials to form stable thin films or act as buffer layers for subsequent delafossite growth. This study employs advanced scanning transmission electron microscopy techniques to investigate the nucleation mechanism underlying the stable growth of PdCoO2 films on Al2O3 and LaAlO3 substrates, grown via molecular-beam epitaxy. Our findings reveal the presence of a secondary phase within the substrate surface that stabilizes the films. This mechanism deviates from the conventional understanding of strain relief mechanisms at oxide heterostructure interfaces and differs significantly from those observed for Cu-based delafossites.

Title: Lattice distortion tuning resistivity invar effect in high entropy alloys
Authors: Hao Chen, Yuanji Xu, Lihua Liu, Yue Chen, Jan Wróbel, Daoyong Cong, Fuyang Tian, Yang Wang
Abstract: Materials with an ultra-low temperature coefficient of resistivity are desired for the temperature and flow sensors in high-precision electronic measuring systems. In this work, the Kubo-Greenwood formula, implemented in ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, is employed to predict the finite-temperature resistivity of multi-component alloys with severe lattice distortion. We observe a tiny change in resistivity over a wide temperature range in high-entropy alloys. The electronic resistivity invar effect in B2 Ni$_{25}$Co$_{25}$(HfTiZr)$_{50}$ Elinvar alloys results from a balance between intrinsic and residual resistivity. This effect is associated with atomic displacements from ideal lattice sites, which are caused by lattice thermal vibrations and chemical disorder-induced lattice distortions. It is further evidenced by a decrease in lattice distortion with temperature and changes in the electronic density of states.

Title: A novel spectroscopic probe of ultrafast magnetization dynamics in the extreme ultraviolet spectral range
Authors: Johanna Richter, Somnath Jana, Robert Behrends, Carl S. Davies, Dieter W. Engel, Martin Hennecke, Daniel Schick, Clemens von Korff Schmising, Stefan Eisebitt
Abstract: The development of spectroscopic techniques in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) spectral range has significantly advanced the understanding of ultrafast interactions in magnetic systems triggered by optical excitation. In this work, we introduce a previously missing geometry that facilitates the observation of the ultrafast magnetization dynamics of magnetic systems with an out-of-plane magnetization grown on XUV opaque substrates. This novel approach to probe ultrafast magnetization dynamics combines the magneto-optical Kerr effect with the strong dependence of a sample's reflectance near its Brewster angle. It therefore works with linearly polarized light and does not require any additional polarizing optics. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the technique by presenting both simulations and experimental data as a function of the energy and the polarization of the XUV probe radiation as well as of the delay time after optical excitation.

Title: Spatially anisotropic Kondo resonance intertwined with superconducting gap in kagome metal CsV3-xCrxSb5
Authors: Zichen Huang, Hui Chen, Zhongqin Zhang, Hao Zhang, Zhen Zhao, Ruwen Wang, Haitao Yang, Wei Ji, Ziqiang Wang, Hong-Jun Gao
Abstract: The newly-discovered chromium-based kagome metal CsCr3Sb5 has garnered significant interest due to its strong electron correlations, intertwined orders and potential for unconventional superconductivity under high pressure. However, the nature of superconducting and magnetic interactions during the transition from the parent compound CsV3Sb5 to CsCr3Sb5 remains elusive. Here, we report the discovery of spatially anisotropic Kondo resonance which intertwines with the superconducting gap, facilitated by the introduction of magnetic Cr impurities into the kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5. In addition to the gradual suppression of long-ranged charge-density-wave orders, dilute Cr dopants induce local magnetic moments, giving rise to the emergence of Kondo resonances. In addition, the Kondo resonance forms spatially anisotropic ripple-like structures around the Cr dopants, breaking all local mirror symmetries. This anisotropy arises from the antiferromagnetic coupling between itinerant electrons and the Cr-induced spin-up electrons. Remarkably, as the Kondo screening develops, the coherence peak and depth of superconducting gap with finite zero-energy conductance significantly enhances. It indicates that non-superconducting pairs at the Fermi surface in the parent compound participate in the Kondo effect, effectively screening the magnetic moments of Cr dopants while simultaneously enhancing the superfluid density. Our findings pave a unique pathway for exploring the interplay between superconductivity and local magnetic moments in kagome systems.

Title: Modulation of Spin-Orbit Coupling, Spin Textures, and Rashba-Edelstein Response in Chiral Tellurium: A First-Principles Study
Authors: Sonam Phuntsho
Abstract: Chiral semiconductors such as elemental tellurium (Te) exhibit unconventional spin textures and large charge-to-spin conversion efficiencies, yet the influence of introducing elements on these properties remains underexplored. Here, we address this gap by investigating how substituting Te with lighter (S, Se) or heavier (Sb) elements systematically modifies the spin-orbit-driven phenomena in chiral Te, including the band structure, spin Berry curvature, and Rashba-Edelstein response. The objective is to determine whether elemental substitution strategies can be leveraged to optimize collinear spin textures, enhance spin accumulation, and possibly extend spin lifetimes all crucial aspects for magnet-free spintronics. Using density functional theory calculations implemented in Quantum ESPRESSO, combined with tight-binding interpolation in PAOFLOW, we map out the element-dependent electronic states and quantify their associated spin transport coefficients. Our findings reveal that lighter elements shift the Fermi level to regions of pronounced spin splitting, thereby increasing the magnitude of spin-current conversion, whereas heavier elements can introduce or remove near-degenerate bands that strongly affect spin-orbit coupling. In both scenarios, the fundamental chirality of Te remains robust, preserving the radial or ''collinear'' spin-momentum locking. These results not only confirm that introducing elements is a potent and feasible route for tuning spin-orbit phenomena but also offer practical guidelines for experimental efforts aiming to engineer chiral semiconductors for spin devices. By correlating element identity with specific spin-texture enhancements, this study paves the way for rationally designing next-generation spintronic components free from external magnetic fields.

Title: Wyckoff Transformer: Generation of Symmetric Crystals
Authors: Nikita Kazeev, Wei Nong, Ignat Romanov, Ruiming Zhu, Andrey Ustyuzhanin, Shuya Yamazaki, Kedar Hippalgaonkar
Abstract: Symmetry rules that atoms obey when they bond together to form an ordered crystal play a fundamental role in determining their physical, chemical, and electronic properties such as electrical and thermal conductivity, optical and polarization behavior, and mechanical strength. Almost all known crystalline materials have internal symmetry. Consistently generating stable crystal structures is still an open challenge, specifically because such symmetry rules are not accounted for. To address this issue, we propose WyFormer, a generative model for materials conditioned on space group symmetry. We use Wyckoff positions as the basis for an elegant, compressed, and discrete structure representation. To model the distribution, we develop a permutation-invariant autoregressive model based on the Transformer and an absence of positional encoding. WyFormer has a unique and powerful synergy of attributes, proven by extensive experimentation: best-in-class symmetry-conditioned generation, physics-motivated inductive bias, competitive stability of the generated structures, competitive material property prediction quality, and unparalleled inference speed.

Title: Melting of devil's staircases in the long-range Dicke-Ising model
Authors: Jan Alexander Koziol, Anja Langheld, Kai Phillip Schmidt
Abstract: We present quantum phase diagrams for the antiferromagnetic long-range Ising model with a linear coupling to a single bosonic mode on the square and triangular lattice. For zero coupling, the ground-state magnetization forms a devil's staircase structure of magnetization plateaux as a function of a longitudinal field. Apart from a paramagnetic superradiant phase with a finite photon density at strong light-matter couplings, the long-range interactions lead to a plethora of intermediate phases that break the translational symmetry and have a finite photon density at the same time. We apply an adaption of the unit-cell-based mean-field calculations, which captures all possible magnetic unit cells up to a chosen extent. Further, we exploit an exact mapping of the non-superradiant phases to an effective Dicke model to calculate upper bounds for phase transitions towards superradiant phases. Finally, to treat quantum fluctuations in a quantitative fashion, we employ a generalized wormhole quantum Monte Carlo algorithm. We discuss how these three methods are used in a cooperative fashion. In the calculated phase diagrams we see several features arising from the long-range interactions: The devil's staircases of distinct magnetically ordered normal phases and non-trivial magnetically ordered superradiant phases beyond the findings for nearest-neighbor interactions. Examples are a superradiant phase with a three-sublattice magnetic order on the square lattice and the superradiant Wigner crystal with four sites per unit cell on the triangular lattice. We find the transition between normal and superradiant phases with the same (different) magnetic order to be of second order with Dicke universality (first order). Further, between superradiant phases we find first-order phase transitions, besides specially highlighted regimes for which we find indications for second-order behavior.

Title: Minimizing sensor-sample distances in scanning nitrogen-vacancy magnetometry

Abstract: Scanning magnetometry with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond has led to significant advances in the sensitive imaging of magnetic systems. The spatial resolution of the technique, however, remains limited to tens to hundreds of nanometers, even for probes where NV centers are engineered within 10 nm from the tip apex. Here, we present a correlated investigation of the crucial parameters that determine the spatial resolution: the mechanical and magnetic stand-off distances, as well as the sub-surface NV center depth in diamond. We study their contributions using mechanical approach curves, photoluminescence measurements, magnetometry scans, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of surface adsorbates. We first show that the stand-off distance is mainly limited by features on the surface of the diamond tip, hindering mechanical access. Next, we demonstrate that frequency-modulated atomic force microscopy (FM-AFM) feedback partially overcomes this issue, leading to closer and more consistent magnetic stand-off distances (26-87 nm) compared to the more common amplitude-modulated (AM-AFM) feedback (43-128 nm). FM operation thus permits improved magnetic imaging of sub-100-nm spin textures, shown for the spin cycloid in BFO and domain walls in a CoFeB synthetic antiferromagnet. Finally, by examining 1H and 19F NMR signals in soft contact with a polytetrafluoroethylene surface, we demonstrate a minimum NV-to-sample distance of 7.9+/-0.4 nm.

Title: Tuning Magnetism of Metal-Organic Framework by Different Types of Pressure
Authors: Shuang Liu, Na Su, Huixia Fu, Yan Liu, Young Sun
Abstract: The properties of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are expected to be sensitive to external pressures because of their inherently flexible structures. Although pressure-driven structural transitions have been intensively studied, the influence of pressure on magnetism has been less exploited for MOFs. Especially, the efficiency of applied pressure may strongly depend on the pressure-transmitting medium (PTM) which may have a complex interaction with MOFs. Here, we report the distinctive effects of different types of pressure, including isotropic hydrostatic pressure, quasi-hydrostatic pressure, and uniaxial pressure, on the anisotropic magnetism of the perovskite MOF, [CH3NH3][Co(COOH)3]. It is found that the hydrostatic pressure has the minimal effect whereas the uniaxial pressure has the highest efficiency in tuning magnetization and magnetic anisotropy of the MOF. First-principles calculations reveal that the applied low pressures (less than 11 kbar) do not induce notable lattice distortion in the framework or the superexchange path. Instead, the modulation of hydrogen bonds is identified as a critical factor for pressure tuning of magnetization and anisotropy. These findings underscore the potential applications of directional pressure in precisely controlling the magnetic and electronic properties of MOFs.

Cha
Abstract: Ongoing demands for smaller and more energy efficient electronic devices necessitate alternative interconnect materials with lower electrical resistivity at reduced dimensions. Despite the emergence of many promising candidates, synthesizing high quality nanostructures remains a major bottleneck in evaluating their performance. Here, we report the successful synthesis of Weyl semimetal NbAs nanowires via thermomechanical nanomolding, achieving single crystallinity and controlled diameters as small as 40 nm. Our NbAs nanowires exhibit a remarkably low room-temperature resistivity of 9.7 +/- 1.6 microOhm-cm, which is three to four times lower than their bulk counterpart. Theoretical calculations corroborate the experimental observations, attributing this exceptional resistivity reduction to surface dominant conduction with long carrier lifetime at finite temperatures. Further characterization of NbAs nanowires and bulk single crystals reveals high breakdown current density, robust stability, and superior thermal conductivity. Collectively, these properties highlight the strong potential of NbAs nanowires as next-generation interconnects, which can surpass the limitations of current copper-based interconnects. Technologically, our findings present a practical application of topological materials, while scientifically showcasing the fundamental properties uniquely accessible in nanoscale platforms.

Title: Studying the radiation of a white dwarf star falling onto a black hole

Abstract: We investigate electromagnetic and gravitational radiation generated during the process of the tidal stripping of a white dwarf star circulating a black hole. We go beyond Chandrasekhar's ideas and not only consider a white dwarf itself as a quantum object, but also describe the dynamics of a produced accretion disk in a quantum way. We model the white dwarf star as a Bose-Fermi droplet and use the quantum hydrodynamic equations to simulate the evolution of the black hole-white dwarf binary system. While going through the periastron, the white dwarf loses a small fraction of its mass. The mass falling onto a black hole is a source of powerful electromagnetic and gravitational radiation. Bursts of ultraluminous radiation are flared at each periastron passage. This resembles the recurrent flaring of X-ray sources discovered recently by Irwin et al. Gravitational energy bursts occur mainly through emission at very low frequencies. The accretion disk, formed due to stripping of the white dwarf, starts at some point to contribute continuously to radiation of both electromagnetic and gravitational types.

Title: Biomass transfer on autocatalytic reaction network: a delay differential equation formulation
Authors: Wei-Hsiang Lin
Abstract: For a biological system to grow and expand, mass must be transferred from the environment to the system and be assimilated into its reaction network. Here, I characterize the biomass transfer process for growing autocatalytic systems. By track biomass along reaction pathways, an n-dimensional ordinary differential equation (ODE) of the reaction network can be reformulated into a one-dimensional delay differential equation (DDE) for its long-term dynamics. The kernel function of the DDE summarizes the overall amplification and transfer delay of the system and serves as a signature for autocatalysis dynamics. The DDE formulation allows reaction networks of various topologies and complexities to be compared and provides rigorous estimation scheme for growth rate upon dimensional reduction of reaction networks.

Title: Predicting topological quantum phase transition from dynamics via multisite entanglement
Authors: Leela Ganesh Chandra Lakkaraju, Sudip Kumar Haldar, Aditi Sen De
Abstract: An exactly solvable Kitaev model in a two-dimensional square lattice exhibits a topological quantum phase transition which is different from the symmetry-breaking transition at zero temperature. When the ground state of a nonlinearly perturbed Kitaev model with different strengths of perturbation taken as the initial state is quenched to a pure Kitaev model, we demonstrate that various features of the dynamical state, such as the Loschmidt echo and time-averaged multipartite entanglement, can determine whether the initial state belongs to the topological phase or not. Moreover, the derivatives of the dynamical quantifiers can faithfully identify the topological quantum phase transition, which is present at equilibrium. When the individual qubits of the lattice interact with the local thermal bath repeatedly, we observe that block entanglement in dissipative dynamics can nevertheless distinguish the equilibrium phases from which the system starts evolution.

Title: Arrested on heating: controlling the motility of active droplets by temperature
Authors: Prashanth Ramesh, Yibo Chen, Petra Räder, Svenja Morsbach, Maziyar Jalaal, Corinna C Maass
Abstract: Self-propelling active matter relies on the conversion of energy from the undirected, nanoscopic scale to directed, macroscopic motion. One of the challenges in the design of synthetic active matter lies in the control of dynamic states, or motility gaits. Here, we present an experimental system of self-propelling droplets with thermally controllable and reversible dynamic states, from unsteady over meandering to persistent to arrested motion. These states are known to depend on the Péclet number of the molecular process powering the motion, which we can now tune by using a temperature sensitive mixture of surfactants as propulsion fuel. We quantify the droplet dynamics by analyzing flow and chemical fields for the individual states, comparing them to canonical models for autophoretic particles. In the context of these models, we experimentally observe, in situ, the fundamental first broken symmetry that translates an isotropic, immotile base state to self-propelled motility.

Title: Wavefunction branching: when you can't tell pure states from mixed states
Authors: Jordan K. Taylor, Ian P. McCulloch
Abstract: We propose a definition of wavefunction "branchings": quantum superpositions which can't be feasibly distinguished from the corresponding mixed state, even under time evolution. Our definition is largely independent of interpretations, requiring only that it takes many more local gates to swap branches than to distinguish them. We give several examples of states admitting such branch decompositions. Under our definition, we argue that attempts to get relative-phase information between branches will fail without frequent active error correction, that branches are effectively the opposite of good error-correcting codes, that branches effectively only grow further apart in time under natural evolution, that branches tend to absorb spatial entanglement, that branching is stronger in the presence of conserved quantities, and that branching implies effective irreversibility. Identifying these branch decompositions in many-body quantum states could shed light on the emergence of classicality, provide a metric for experimental tests at the quantum/ classical boundary, and allow for longer numerical time evolution simulations. We see this work as a generalization of the basic ideas of environmentally-induced decoherence to situations with no clear system/ environment split.

Title: Dual-unitary shadow tomography
Authors: Ahmed A. Akhtar, Namit Anand, Jeffrey Marshall, Yi-Zhuang You
Abstract: We introduce a classical shadow tomography protocol based on dual-unitary brick-wall circuits termed ``dual-unitary shadow tomography'' (DUST). To quantify the performance of DUST, we study operator spreading and Pauli weight dynamics in one-dimensional qubit systems, evolved by random two-local dual-unitary gates arranged in a brick-wall structure, ending with a final measurement layer. We do this by deriving general constraints on the Pauli weight transfer matrix and specializing to the case of dual-unitarity. Remarkably, we find that operator spreading in these circuits have a rich structure resembling that of relativistic quantum field theories, with massless chiral excitations that can decay or fuse into each other, which we call left- or right-movers. We develop a mean-field description of the Pauli weight in terms of $\rho(x,t)$, which represents the probability of having nontrivial support at site $x$ and depth $t$ starting from a fixed weight distribution. We develop an equation of state for $\rho(x,t)$ and simulate it numerically using Monte Carlo simulations. For the task of predicting operators with (nearly) full support, we show that DUST outperforms brick-wall Clifford shadows of equivalent depth. This advantage is further pronounced for small system sizes and more generally, our results are robust to finite-size effects.

Title: Fault-tolerant compiling of classically hard IQP circuits on hypercubes
Authors: Dominik Hangleiter, Marcin Kalinowski, Dolev Bluvstein, Madelyn Cain, Nishad Maskara, Xun Gao, Aleksander Kubica, Mikhail D. Lukin, Michael J. Gullans
Abstract: Realizing computationally complex quantum circuits in the presence of noise and imperfections is a challenging task. While fault-tolerant quantum computing provides a route to reducing noise, it requires a large overhead for generic algorithms. Here, we develop and analyze a hardware-efficient, fault-tolerant approach to realizing complex sampling circuits. We co-design the circuits with the appropriate quantum error correcting codes for efficient implementation in a reconfigurable neutral atom array architecture, constituting what we call a fault-tolerant compilation of the sampling algorithm. Specifically, we consider a family of $[[2^D , D, 2]]$ quantum error detecting codes whose transversal and permutation gate set can realize arbitrary degree-$D$ instantaneous quantum polynomial (IQP) circuits. Using native operations of the code and the atom array hardware, we compile a fault-tolerant and fast-scrambling family of such IQP circuits in a hypercube geometry, realized recently in the experiments by Bluvstein et al. [Nature 626, 7997 (2024)]. We develop a theory of second-moment properties of degree-$D$ IQP circuits for analyzing hardness and verification of random sampling by mapping to a statistical mechanics model. We provide evidence that sampling from hypercube IQP circuits is classically hard to simulate and analyze the linear cross-entropy benchmark (XEB) in comparison to the average fidelity. To realize a fully scalable approach, we first show that Bell sampling from degree-$4$ IQP circuits is classically intractable and can be efficiently validated. We further devise new families of $[[O(d^D),D,d]]$ color codes of increasing distance $d$, permitting exponential error suppression for transversal IQP sampling. Our results highlight fault-tolerant compiling as a powerful tool in co-designing algorithms with specific error-correcting codes and realistic hardware.

Title: Thermodynamics of photoelectric devices
Authors: Samuel L. Jacob, Artur M. Lacerda, Yonatan Dubi, John Goold
Abstract: We study the nonequilibrium steady state thermodynamics of a photodevice which can operate as a solar cell or a photoconductor, depending on the degree of asymmetry of the junction. The thermodynamic efficiency is captured by a single coefficient of performance. Using a minimal model based on a two-level system, we show that when the Coulomb interaction energy matches the transport gap of the junction, the photoconductor displays maximal response, performance, and signal-to-noise ratio, while the same regime is always detrimental for the solar cell. Nevertheless, we find that the Coulomb interaction is beneficial for the solar cell performance if it lies below the transport gap. Our work sheds important light on design principles for thermodynamically efficient photodevices in the presence of Coulomb interactions.

Title: Causality and instability in wave propagation in random time-varying media
Authors: Romain Pierrat, Julia Rocha, Rémi Carminati
Abstract: We develop a theoretical model to investigate wave propagation in media with random time-varying properties, where temporal fluctuations lead to complex scattering dynamics. Focusing on the ensemble-averaged field, we derive an exact expression for the average Green's function in the presence of finite temporal disorder, and extend our analysis to the thermodynamic limit. In contrast to spatial disorder, causality prevents recurrent scattering, allowing us to achieve a non-perturbative solution. We identify two distinct propagation regimes: one where the field oscillates with constant amplitude, and another where it grows exponentially at long times. Our findings offer new insights into wave dynamics in temporally disordered media, with potential applications in time-varying metamaterials, dynamic sensing, and imaging in turbulent or chaotic environments.

Title: A superconducting on-chip microwave cavity for tunable hybrid systems with optically trapped Rydberg atoms
Authors: Benedikt Wilde, Manuel Kaiser, Malte Reinschmidt, Andreas Günther, Dieter Koelle, Jószef Fortágh, Reinhold Kleiner, Daniel Bothner
Abstract: Hybrid quantum systems are highly promising platforms for addressing important challenges of quantum information science and quantum sensing. Their implementation, however, is technologically non-trivial, since each component typically has unique experimental requirements. Here, we work towards a hybrid system consisting of a superconducting on-chip microwave circuit in a dilution refrigerator and optically trapped ultra-cold atoms. Specifically, we focus on the design optimization of a suitable superconducting chip and on the corresponding challenges and limitations. We unfold detailed microwave-cavity engineering strategies for maximized and tunable coupling rates to atomic Rydberg-Rydberg transitions in $\mathrm{^{87}Rb}$ atoms while respecting the boundary conditions due to the presence of a laser beam near the surface of the chip. Finally, we present an experimental implementation of the superconducting microwave chip and discuss the cavity characteristics as a function of temperature and applied dc voltage. Our results illuminate the required consideration aspects for a flexible, tunable superconductor-atom hybrid system, and lay the groundwork for realizing this exciting platform in a dilution refrigerator with vacuum Rabi frequencies approaching the strong-coupling regime.

Title: Tunable Two-Species Spin Models with Rydberg Atoms in Circular and Elliptical States
Authors: Jacek Dobrzyniecki, Paula Heim, Michał Tomza
Abstract: We propose a scheme for constructing versatile quantum simulators using ultracold Rydberg atoms in long-lived circular and elliptical states. By exciting different subspaces of internal atomic states, the atoms can be used to simulate two effective spin species with different spin-spin interactions. The strengths of transverse and longitudinal spin-spin interactions, both intra- and inter-species, can be controlled within a wide range of values. This setup can be used to simulate two-species spin models or lattice models with two sublattices. We show examples of specific models which can be realized.

Title: Induced three-neutron interactions with low cutoffs for dilute neutron matter
Authors: Viswanathan Palaniappan, S. Ramanan, Michael Urban
Abstract: The properties of dilute neutron matter are mostly determined by the s-wave two-body (2N) interaction, while three-body (3N) interactions are suppressed by the Pauli principle. In a previous work, we showed that it can be advantageous to use renormalization group based effective interactions with cutoffs scaled with the Fermi momentum, especially at low densities. In that case, induced 3N interactions may become important. In this work, we compute the 3N interaction induced by the similarity renormalization group flow of the s-wave 2N interaction. We work in the momentum-space hyperspherical partial wave basis and investigate its convergence properties. Then we study the effect of the induced 3N interaction on the equation of state of dilute neutron matter. We observe that the cutoff dependence of the equation of state is strongly reduced when the effect of induced 3N interaction is included.

Title: Operator K-complexity in DSSYK: Krylov complexity equals bulk length
Authors: Marco Ambrosini, Eliezer Rabinovici, Adrián Sánchez-Garrido, Ruth Shir, Julian Sonner
Abstract: In this paper we study the notion of complexity under time evolution in chaotic quantum systems with holographic duals. Continuing on from our previous work, we turn our attention to the issue of Krylov complexity upon the insertion of a class of single-particle operators in the double-scaled SYK model. Such an operator is described by a matter-chord insertion, which splits the theory into left/right sectors, allowing us, via chord-diagram technology, to compute two different notions of complexity associated to the operator insertion: first a Krylov operator complexity, and second the Krylov complexity of a state obtained by an operator acting on the thermofield double state. We will provide both an analytic proof and detailed numerical evidence, that both Krylov complexities arise from a recursively defined basis of states characterized by a constant total chord number. As a consequence, in all cases we are able to establish that Krylov complexity is given by the expectation value of a length operator acting on the Hilbert space of the theory, expressed in terms of basis states, organized by left and right chord number. We find analytic expressions for the semiclassical limit of K-complexity, and study how the size of the operator encodes the scrambling dynamics upon the matter insertion in Krylov language. We furthermore determine the effective Hamiltonian governing the evolution of K-complexity, showing that evolution on the Krylov chain can equivalently be understood as a particle moving in a Morse potential. A particular type of triple scaling limit allows to access the gravitational sector of the theory, in which the geometrical nature of K-complexity is assured by virtue of being a total chord length, in an analogous fashion to what was found in [1] for the K-complexity of the thermofield double state.

Title: Gapped Phases in (2+1)d with Non-Invertible Symmetries: Part II
Authors: Lakshya Bhardwaj, Sakura Schafer-Nameki, Apoorv Tiwari, Alison Warman
Abstract: We use the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) to systematically characterize gapped phases in 2+1 dimensions with categorical symmetries. The SymTFTs that we consider are (3+1)d Dijkgraaf-Witten (DW) theories for finite groups $G$, whose gapped boundaries realize all so-called ``All Bosonic type" fusion 2-category symmetries. In arXiv:2408.05266 we provided the general framework and studied the case where $G$ is an abelian group. In this work we focus on the case of non-Abelian $G$. Gapped boundary conditions play a central role in the SymTFT construction of symmetric gapped phases. These fall into two broad families: minimal and non-minimal boundary conditions, respectively. The first kind corresponds to boundaries on which all line operators are obtainable as boundary projections of bulk line operators. The symmetries on such boundaries include (anomalous) 2-groups and 2-representation categories of 2-groups. Conversely non-minimal boundaries contain line operators that are intrinsic to the boundaries. The symmetries on such boundaries correspond to fusion 2-categories where modular tensor categories intertwine non-trivially with the above symmetry types. We discuss in detail the generalized charges of these symmetries and their condensation patterns that give rise to a zoo of rich beyond-Landau gapped phases. Among these are phases that exhibit novel patterns of symmetry breaking wherein the symmetry broken vacua carry distinct kinds of topological order. We exemplify this framework for the case where $G$ is a dihedral group.
