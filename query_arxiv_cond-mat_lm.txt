Title: An eco-friendly universal strategy via ribavirin to achieve highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells
Authors: Xianhu Wu, Gaojie Xia, Guanglei Cui, Jieyu Bi, Nian Liu, Jiaxin Jiang, Jilong Sun, Luyang Liu, Ping Li, Ning Lu, Zewen Zuo, Min Gu
Abstract: The grain boundaries of perovskite films prepared by the solution method are highly disordered, with a large number of defects existing at the grain boundaries. These defect sites promote the decomposition of perovskite. Here, we use ribavirin obtained through bacillus subtilis fermentation to regulate the crystal growth of perovskite, inducing changes in the work function and energy level structure of perovskite, which significantly reduces the defect density. Based on density functional theory calculations, the defect formation energies of VI, VMA, VPb, and PbI in perovskite are improved. This increases the open-circuit voltage of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/PCBM/BCP/Ag) from 1.077 to 1.151 V, and the PCE increases significantly from 17.05% to 19.86%. Unencapsulated PSCs were stored in the environment (humidity approximately 35+-5%) for long-term stability testing. After approximately 900 hours of storage, the PCE of the ribavirin-based device retains 84.33% of its initial PCE, while the control-based device retains only 13.44% of its initial PCE. The PCE of PSCs (ITO/SnO2/perovskite/Spiro-OMETAD/Ag) is increased from 20.16% to 22.14%, demonstrating the universality of this doping method. This universal doping strategy provides a new approach for improving the efficiency and stability of PSCs using green molecular doping strategies.

Title: Ferrimagnetism from quantum fluctuations in Kitaev materials
Authors: Niccolò Francini, Pedro M. Cônsoli, Lukas Janssen
Abstract: Ferrimagnetism appears in the temperature-field phase diagrams of several candidate Kitaev materials, such as the honeycomb cobaltates Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ and Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$. In a number of instances, however, the exact nature of the corresponding ground states remains the subject of ongoing debate. We show that general symmetry considerations can rule out candidate states that are incompatible with the observed ferrimagnetic behavior. In particular, we demonstrate that a ferrimagnetic response cannot be reconciled with a collinear zigzag ground state, owing to the combined time-reversal and translational symmetry inherent to that configuration. Instead, the observed behavior is fully compatible with the symmetries of noncollinear multi-$\mathbf q$ states, such as the triple-$\mathbf q$ discussed in the context of Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$. We exemplify this general result by computing the ferrimagnetic response of an extended Heisenberg-Kitaev-Gamma model with explicit sublattice symmetry breaking within linear spin-wave theory. If the model realizes a triple-$\mathbf q$ ground state, the calculated magnetization curve is well consistent with the low-temperature behavior observed in Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$. In this case, a finite magnetization remains in the zero-temperature limit as a consequence of quantum fluctuations, even if the $g$-factors on the different sublattices are identical. For a zigzag ground state, by contrast, the total magnetization vanishes both at zero and finite temperatures, independent of possible sublattice-dependent $g$-factors, as expected from the symmetry analysis. The implications of our general result for other Kitaev materials exhibiting ferrimagnetic behavior are also briefly discussed.

Title: Making rare events typical in $d$-dimensional chaotic maps
Authors: Yllari K. González-Koda, Ricardo Gutiérrez, Carlos Pérez-Espigares
Abstract: Due to the deterministic nature of chaotic systems, fluctuations in their trajectories arise solely from the choice of initial conditions. Some of these dynamical fluctuations may lead to extremely unlikely scenarios. Understanding the impact of such rare events and the trajectories that give rise to them is of significant interest across disciplines. Yet, identifying the initial conditions responsible for those events is a challenging task due to the inherent sensitivity to small perturbations of chaotic dynamics. In a recent paper [Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 227201 (2023)], this challenge was addressed by finding the effective dynamics that make rare events typical for one-dimensional chaotic maps. Here we extend such large-deviation framework to $d$-dimensional chaotic maps. Specifically, for any such map, we propose a method to find an effective topologically-conjugate map which reproduces the rare-event statistics in the long-time limit. We demonstrate the applicability of this result using several observables of paradigmatic examples of two-dimensional chaos, namely the two-dimensional tent map and Arnold's cat map.

Title: Quasiparticle band picture bridging topology and strong correlations across energy scales
Authors: Ivan Pasqua, Antonio Maria Tagliente, Gabriele Bellomia, Bartomeu Monserrat, Michele Fabrizio, Carlos-Mejuto Zaera
Abstract: Understanding the interplay between electronic correlations and band topology remains a central challenge in condensed matter physics, primarily hindered by a language mismatch problem. While band topology is naturally formulated within a single-particle band theory, strong correlations typically elude such an effective one-body description. In this work, we bridge this gap leveraging the ghost Gutzwiller (gGut) variational embedding framework, which introduces auxiliary quasiparticle degrees of freedom to recover an effective band structure description of strongly correlated systems. This approach enables an interpretable and computationally efficient treatment of correlated topological phases, resulting in energy- and momentum-resolved topological features that are directly comparable with experimental spectra. We exemplify the advantages of this framework through a detailed study of the interacting Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model. Not only does the gGut description reproduce established results, but it also reveals previously inaccessible aspects: most notably, the emergence of topologically nontrivial Hubbard bands hosting their own edge states, as well as possible ways to manipulate these through a finite magnetization. These results position the gGut framework as a promising tool for the predictive modeling of correlated topological materials.

Title: Quantum criticality and tunable Griffiths phase in superconducting twisted trilayer graphene
Authors: Phanibhusan S. Mahapatra, Haining Pan, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, J. H. Pixley, Eva Y. Andrei
Abstract: When dimensionality is reduced, enhanced quantum fluctuations can destroy long-range phase coherence, driving a superconductor insulator transition, SIT, where disorder and electronic correlations give rise to novel many-body states. Here, we report the first observation of a magnetic field tuned SIT in mirrorsymmetric twisted trilayer graphene, TTG. Remarkably, signatures of quantum criticality persist over an exceptionally broad range of magnetic fields and are well described by the formation of a quantum Griffiths phase, a regime in which rare spatially extended regions develop local order within a globally disordered phase. This leads to a quantum phase transition governed by an infinite-randomness fixed point and characterized by ultraslow relaxation dynamics. Near the quantum critical region, transport measurements reveal strongly nonlinear electrical behavior, including a current-driven reentrant transition from insulating to superconducting transport, providing direct evidence of local superconducting order. By tilting the magnetic field, we are able to collapse the broad Griffiths regime into a single quantum critical point, QCP, demonstrating a striking level of control over disorder induced quantum dynamics. Our results further show that TTG strongly violates the Pauli limit and establishes twisted trilayer graphene as a tunable platform for exploring quantum phase fluctuations, Cooper pair localization, and unconventional superconductivity.

Title: Natural super-orbitals representation of many-body operators
Authors: Maxime Debertolis
Abstract: We introduce the concept of natural super-orbitals for many-body operators, defined as the eigenvectors of the one-body super-density matrix associated with a vectorized operator. We first analyze the general analytical properties of these objects in various contexts, including the time-evolution operator of non-interacting Hamiltonians and Haar-random unitaries. We then perform a numerical investigation of the natural super-orbitals corresponding to both the time-evolution operator and a time-evolved local operator, focusing on two many-body systems: the fermionic $t\text{-}V$ chain and an impurity model, using tensor network simulations. Our results reveal that the $t\text{-}V$ model lacks a preferred super-orbital basis, while in the impurity model, the occupations of the natural orbitals for both operators decay exponentially at all times. This indicates that only a small number of orbitals contribute significantly to quantum correlations, enabling a compact matrix-product-operator representation in the natural orbital basis. Finally, we examine the spatial spread of the natural orbitals for time-evolved local operators in the impurity model and show that the complexity of this operator in the natural orbital basis saturates over time. This new framework opens the door to future research that leverages the compressed structure of operators in their natural super-orbital basis, enabling for instance the computation of out-of-time-order correlators in large interacting systems over extended time scales.

Title: Exotic superconducting states in altermagnets
Authors: Kirill Parshukov, Andreas P. Schnyder
Abstract: The interplay between magnetism and superconductivity is one of the central topics of condensed matter physics, which has recently been put into new light by the discovery of altermagnets. Here, we study this interplay from a fundamental symmetry perspective using irreducible co-representations of the altermagnetic spin-point groups. We construct and tabulate all symmetry-allowed pairing functions for altermagnets, which uncovers numerous exotic pairing states. We focus on three of them, namely: (i) a non-unitary superconductor with different spatial anisotropies for the spin-up and spin-down condensates, (ii) a half-and-half metal-superconductor where only electrons with one of the two spin components form Cooper pairs, and (iii) a spin chiral superconductor with spin-polarized edge states. Interestingly, the first of these three superconductors exhibits an unusual fractional ac Josephson current for only one of the two spin polarizations. We present phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau theories for these unconventional superconductors and show that they correspond to stable minima of the free energies. We examine their topological properties, study the effects of small spin-orbit coupling, consider possible material examples, and investigate their topological responses.

Title: Neural Network-Augmented Pfaffian Wave-functions for Scalable Simulations of Interacting Fermions
Authors: Ao Chen, Zhou-Quan Wan, Anirvan Sengupta, Antoine Georges, Christopher Roth
Abstract: Developing accurate numerical methods for strongly interacting fermions is crucial for improving our understanding of various quantum many-body phenomena, especially unconventional superconductivity. Recently, neural quantum states have emerged as a promising approach for studying correlated fermions, highlighted by the hidden fermion and backflow methods, which use neural networks to model corrections to fermionic quasiparticle orbitals. In this work, we expand these ideas to the space of Pfaffians, a wave-function that naturally expresses superconducting pairings, and propose the hidden fermion Pfaffian state (HFPS), which flexibly represents both unpaired and superconducting phases and scales to large systems with favorable asymptotic complexity. In our numerical experiments, HFPS provides state-of-the-art variational accuracy in different regimes of both the attractive and repulsive Hubbard models. We show that the HFPS is able to capture both s-wave and d-wave pairing, and therefore may be a useful tool for modeling phases with unconventional superconductivity.

Title: Spin and valley-dependent tunneling in MoS$_2$ through magnetic barrier
Authors: Ahmed Jellal, Nadia Benlakhouy, Pablo Díaz, David Laroze
Abstract: We study electron transport in monolayer molybdenum disulfide MoS$_2$ subjected to a magnetic barrier. Our analysis employs a full-band continuum model to capture the relevant physical phenomena. We focus on how electron energy, magnetic field strength, and the geometric characteristics of the barrier affect the transmission and conductance. We observe sharp resonant tunneling features emerging from quantum interference effects induced by magnetic confinement. A key outcome of our study is the discovery of distinct resonance patterns in the conduction and valence bands. These patterns are closely related to the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling in MoS$_2$ and the breaking of time-reversal symmetry by the magnetic field. This results in significant spin and valley selectivity in electron transport. We demonstrate that adjusting external parameters precisely controls spin-polarized and valley-polarized currents. We show that a magnetic barrier can control electron spin and valley in MoS$_2$, making it a promising platform for energy-efficient spintronic and valleytronic devices.

Title: Mixed-configuration approximation for multi-orbital systems out of equilibrium
Authors: Tommaso Maria Mazzocchi, Daniel Werner, Markus Aichhorn, Enrico Arrigoni
Abstract: We propose a mixed-configuration approximation based on single-band impurity solvers to efficiently study nonequilibrium multi-orbital systems at moderate computational cost. In this work, we merge the approach with the so-called auxiliary master equation approach. As benchmark, we first show that our approach reproduces the results of quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) for two-orbital impurity models at equilibrium with overall good accuracy, especially for non-degenerate orbitals. We then use our approach as impurity solver for dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) to address the case of a two-orbital, realistic layered structure, recovering the strong crystal-field-driven charge polarization observed by solving the DMFT self-consistent cycle with QMC, albeit slightly reduced. Finally, we address a prototype nonequilibrium setup by sandwiching this layer between metallic contacts subject to a bias voltage described by different chemical potentials. This simplified model demonstrates out method's potential to access nonequilibrium steady-state behavior of multi-orbital, realistic materials. These findings provide a first-step basis for theoretical studies of nonequilibrium properties of multi-orbital compounds directly in the real frequency domain.

Title: Intermediate-valence behavior in U2Rh2Sb
Authors: D. Legut, M. Krnel, P. Koželj, Yu. Prots, M. Juckel, U. Burkhardt, A. Ormeci, Yu. Grin, A. Leithe-Jasper, J. Kolorenč, E. Svanidze, U. D. Wdowik
Abstract: Intermediate-valence behavior is sometimes observed in lanthanide-based materials containing Ce, Yb, Sm or Eu. However, the number of actinide-based systems that exhibit this type of behavior is rather limited. In this work, we present the discovery and characterization of a uranium compound U2Rh2Sb, which turns out to be a candidate for the intermediate-valencebehavior. The material shows a characteristic feature in the magnetic susceptibility around T = 50 K, which can be described within the interconfiguration-fluctuation model of intermediate valence systems. We find the energy difference between the 5f3(U3+) and 5f2(U4+) states to be $\delta$Eex/kB $\approx$ 400 K and the corresponding valence fluctuation temperature to be Tvf $\approx$ 140 K. The value of the electronic specific heat coefficient $\gamma$ = 50 mJ mol-1 U K-2 signals a modest electron effective mass enhancement. The electrical resistivity indicates metallic behavior, albeit with a small residual resistivity ratio. Measurements of thermoelectric properties indicate a change of sign in the Seebeck coefficient around T = 100 K, with a minimum achieved at T = 50 K, which coincides with the broad peak observed in magnetic susceptibility. The experimental results are compared with the theoretical analysis, based on the first-principles calculations, including lattice dynamics.

Title: Sensitivity of x-ray absorption at $5d$ edges of high-valent light actinides to crystal-field strength and covalency effects
Authors: Johan Vegelius, David K. Shuh, Sergei M. Butorin
Abstract: The $5f$ states were probed in ThO$_2$ and U(VI) and U(V) oxides using x-ray absorption spectroscopy at the actinide $O_{4,5}$ edges. Measured data were analyzed by several approaches including atomic, crystal-field theory and the Anderson impurity model to take into account the hybridization of actinide valence states with oxygen $2p$ states. For Th(IV), the $5f$ states are mainly affected by the crystal-field interaction with the closest neighbors as can be seen from the corresponding spectrum of ThO$_2$. In turn, for U(VI) and U(V) oxides, the U $5f$-O $2p$ hybridization and high degree of covalency in the chemical bonding play a decisive role increasing the $5f$ occupancy and consequently governing the ground and excited state properties. That is additionally illustrated by results from the calculations of the U $5d$ x-ray photoemission spectra for U(V) in the lattice of La-doped UO$_2$.

Title: Imaging Nonlinear Spin Waves in Magnetoacoustic Devices

Abstract: Magnetoacoustic systems offer promising platforms for next-generation sensors and computing applications, but understanding their nonlinear dynamics remains challenging. Here, we use nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond to spatially map nonlinear magnon scattering processes in FeGaB/LiNbO3 magnetoacoustic devices with sub-micron resolution. We observe highly heterogeneous magnetic noise generation under acoustic driving at 1425 MHz, with responses varying dramatically across micron length scales. Time-domain measurements reveal threshold-like nonlinear behavior where NV center spin relaxation rates increase over two orders of magnitude as drive power is increased. These findings reveal microscopic noise sources that limit magnetoacoustic sensor performance while simultaneously demonstrating how acoustic mode engineering could enable selective control of nonlinear magnon processes.

Title: Revisiting the Abundance of Topological Materials
Authors: Hossein Mirhosseini, Luis Elcoro, Andreas Knüpfer, Thomas D. Kühne
Abstract: The classification of topological materials is revisited using advanced computational workflows that integrate hybrid density functional theory calculations with exact Hartree-Fock exchange. Unlike previous studies, our workflow optimizes atomic configurations obtained from the Materials Project Database, followed by precise electronic structure calculations. Our results based on hybrid density functional theory calculations reveal that only 15\% of materials are topologically nontrivial, which is in stark contrast to the previously reported 30\% based on semi-local exchange and correlation functionals. This discrepancy underscores the critical dependence of topological classifications on accurate atomic and electronic structures, rendering the abundance of topological materials much lower than generally assumed.

Title: A molecular dynamics investigation of the dependence of mechanical properties of steel nanowires on C concentration
Authors: J.K. Liyanage, M.D.Nadeesha Tharundi, Laalitha S. I. Liyanage
Abstract: The temperature dependence of mechanical properties of steel nanowires with varying carbon content was studied using molecular dynamics simulations. Four interatomic potentials were assessed, with the Modified Embedded Atom Method (MEAM) potential developed by Liyanage et al. selected for its accuracy in predicting the behavior of BCC Fe, FeC in the B1 rock salt structure, and BCC iron with carbon. Uniaxial tensile tests were conducted on FeC nanowires with carbon concentrations of 0-10% at temperatures ranging from 0.1 K to 900 K. Stress-strain curves were analyzed to determine Young's modulus, yield stress, and ultimate tensile strength (UTS). Results showed that Young's modulus increased between 0.1 K and 300 K but decreased between 600 K and 900 K with increasing carbon content. Both yield stress and UTS decreased progressively with higher carbon percentages. Common Neighbor Analysis revealed rapid formation of slip planes as carbon content increased and greater slip plane propagation at elevated temperatures, contributing to reduced nanowire strength. These findings provide insights into the influence of carbon content and temperature on the mechanical behavior of steel nanowires, which may inform the design of nanostructured steel materials for various applications.

Title: Revising the Theory of Cross Phenomena
Authors: Zi-Kui Liu
Abstract: Recently, the present author proposed a Theory of Cross Phenomena (TCP), which asserts that the flux of a molar quantity is governed solely by the gradient of its conjugate potential, as derived from the combined law of thermodynamics. This contrasts with the classical Onsager theorem, i.e., flux equations and reciprocal relations, which posit that fluxes are linearly related to the gradients of all potentials through a symmetric kinetic coefficient matrix. In the present work, the original TCP is revised with the flux equation derived from the first law of thermodynamics and the definitions of the total entropy change and the total work change of an internal process. Although the revision is foundational, both original and revised TCP frameworks lead to similar conclusions with respect to the Onsager theorem.

Title: Marginal Metals and Kosterlitz-Thouless Type Phase Transition in Disordered Altermagnets
Authors: Chang-An Li, Bo Fu, Huaiming Guo, Björn Trauzettel, Song-Bo Zhang
Abstract: Altermagnetism, a recently discovered magnetic phase characterized by spin-split bands without net magnetization, has emerged as promising platform for novel physics and potential applications. However, its stability against disorder-ubiquitous in real materials-remains poorly understood. Here, we study the electron localization properties of two-dimensional altermagnets subject to disorder. Remarkably, we discover a disorder-driven phase transition from a marginal metallic phase to an insulator, which falls into the Kosterlitz-Thouless class. We demonstrate this by convincing numerical evidence and propose a vortex-antivortex-like spin pair picture for its interpretation. Moreover, we show that the characteristic spin anisotropy of altermagnets persists but gradually fades away across the transition. These changes directly affect the spin-splitting features that are detectable in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and tunneling magnetoresistance. Our findings provide a new perspective on recent experimental observations of altermagnetism in candidate materials.

Title: Dimensional crossover of superfluid $^{3}$He in a magnetic field
Authors: Leyla Saraj, Daksh Malhotra, Aymar Muhikira, Alexander J. Shook, John P. Davis, Igor Boettcher
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments on superfluid $^3$He in nanoscale-confined geometries, we theoretically investigate the associated phase diagram in a slab geometry and perpendicular magnetic field as the size of confinement is varied. Our analysis is based on minimizing the Ginzburg--Landau free energy for the $3\times 3$ matrix superfluid order parameter for three different boundary conditions. We observe a smooth crossover from the phase diagram of the 3D system to the quasi-2D limit for slab heights of several hundred nanometres and magnetic fields of several kilogauss. We illuminate that, despite the apparent complexity of the underlying equations, many precise numerical and even analytical statements can be made about the phase structure for general values of the coefficients of the free energy functional, which can in turn be used to constrain or measure these parameters. To guide future experimental studies, we compute the phase diagram in dependence of pressure, temperature, slab height, and magnetic field.

Title: Control of fragment sizes of exploding rings
Authors: Csanád Szuszik, Ferenc Kun
Abstract: We investigate the fragmentation of ring-like brittle structures under explosive loading using a discrete element model. By systematically varying ring thickness and strain rate, we uncover a transition from one-dimensional (1D) segmentation to two-dimensional (2D) planar fragmentation and, ultimately, to complete shattering. This transition is driven by the effective dimensionality of the crack pattern, which evolves with increasing strain rate. We identify a critical ring thickness beyond which segmentation ceases, and fragmentation directly follows a power-law mass distribution characteristic of 2D systems. In the crossover regime, spanning and non-spanning fragments coexist, enabling control over the power-law exponent of the mass distribution. At very high strain rates, we observe a transition to complete shattering, where the system follows a novel scaling law relating the shattering strain rate to ring thickness. Our results provide fundamental insights into fragmentation universality classes and offer potential applications in space debris prediction, controlled detonation technologies, and materials engineering.

Title: Raman signature of cation vacancies in rare-earth nitrides
Authors: M. Markwitz, K. Van Koughnet, K. Kneisel, W. F. Holmes-Hewett, F. Natali, E. X. M. Trewick, L. Porteous, B. J. Ruck, H. J. Trodahl
Abstract: We report a coordinated Raman/computation study of the rare-earth nitrides, a series of intrinsic ferromagnetic semiconductors, to reveal the presence of cation vacancies. Their presence is signaled by a Raman-active vibrational mode at 1100-1400 cm$^{-1}$, rising steadily as the lattice contracts across the series. The mode's frequency is in excellent agreement with the computed breathing-mode vibration of the six nitrogen ions surrounding cation vacancies. The discovery of such cation vacancies opens the door for hole doping that has so far been lacking in the exploitation of rare-earth nitrides.

Title: Solid-State Dewetting of Polycrystalline Thin Films: a Phase Field Approach
Authors: Paul Hoffrogge, Nils Becker, Daniel Schneider, Britta Nestler, Axel Voigt, Marco Salvalaglio
Abstract: Solid-state dewetting (SSD) is the process by which thin solid films break up and retract on a substrate, resulting in the formation of nanostructures and islands. While SSD in single-crystalline films is generally understood as a surface-energy-driven process mediated by surface diffusion, polycrystalline films feature additional complexity due to the presence of grain boundaries. Theoretical investigations and simulation frameworks have mainly focused on single-crystalline SSD. In this work, we present and apply a multi-phase-field framework that captures key mechanisms in polycrystalline thin films with multiple grains and grain boundaries in three dimensions. By considering isotropic surface and interface energy and curvature-driven grain boundary motion, we demonstrate how the framework reproduces the key phenomenology of SSD while being consistent with predictions based on energetic arguments. We also introduce refined analytical criteria for the onset of dewetting, confirmed by numerical simulations. Key evidence is given concerning the onset of dewetting at grain-boundary triple junctions. Moreover, we showcase SSD of polycrystalline patches. This work paves the way for in-depth investigations of the morphological evolution of polycrystalline thin films.

Title: Ratchet Effects in Cyclic Pattern Formation Systems with Competing Interactions
Authors: C. Reichhardt, C.J.O. Reichhardt
Abstract: Ratchet effects can appear for particles interacting with an asymmetric potential under ac driving or for a thermal system in which a substrate is periodically flashed. Here, we show that a new type of collective ratchet effect can arise for a pattern-forming system coupled to an asymmetric substrate when the interaction potential between the particles is periodically oscillated in order to cycle the system through different patterns. We consider particles with competing short-range attraction and long-range repulsion subjected to time-dependent oscillations of the ratio between the attractive and repulsive interaction terms, which causes the system to cycle periodically between crystal and bubble states. In the presence of the substrate, this system exhibits both a positive and a reversed ratchet effect, and we show that there is a maximum in the ratchet efficiency as a function of interaction strength, ac drive frequency, and particle density. Our results could be realized for a variety of pattern-forming systems on asymmetric substrates where the pattern type or particle interactions can be oscillated.

Title: Failed superconductivity in a Mott spin liquid material
Authors: Yuxin Wang, Vladimir Dobrosavljević, Eun Sang Choi, Yohei Saito, Atsushi Kawamoto, Andrej Pustogow, Martin Dressel, Dragana Popović
Abstract: A central challenge for understanding unconventional superconductivity in most strongly correlated electronic materials is their complicated band structure and presence of competing orders. In contrast, quasi-two-dimensional organic spin liquids are single-band systems with superconductivity arising near the bandwidth-tuned Mott metal-insulator transition in the absence of other orders. Here, we study chemically substituted $\kappa$-organics in which superconducting fluctuations emerge in the phase coexistence region between the Mott insulator and the Fermi liquid. Using magnetotransport and ac susceptibility measurements, we find that global superconductivity fails to set in as temperature $T\rightarrow 0$. Our results indicate instead the presence of superconducting domains embedded in the metallic percolating cluster that undergo a magnetic field-tuned quantum superconductor-to-metal phase transition. Surprisingly, albeit consistent with the percolation picture, universal conductance fluctuations are seen at high fields in macroscopic samples. The observed interplay of the intrinsic inhomogeneity and quantum phase fluctuations provides a new insight into failed superconductivity, a phenomenon seen in various conventional and unconventional superconductors, including cuprates.

Title: Functional Neural Wavefunction Optimization
Authors: Victor Armegioiu, Juan Carrasquilla, Siddhartha Mishra, Johannes Müller, Jannes Nys, Marius Zeinhofer, Hang Zhang
Abstract: We propose a framework for the design and analysis of optimization algorithms in variational quantum Monte Carlo, drawing on geometric insights into the corresponding function space. The framework translates infinite-dimensional optimization dynamics into tractable parameter-space algorithms through a Galerkin projection onto the tangent space of the variational ansatz. This perspective unifies existing methods such as stochastic reconfiguration and Rayleigh-Gauss-Newton, provides connections to classic function-space algorithms, and motivates the derivation of novel algorithms with geometrically principled hyperparameter choices. We validate our framework with numerical experiments demonstrating its practical relevance through the accurate estimation of ground-state energies for several prototypical models in condensed matter physics modeled with neural network wavefunctions.

Title: Rate-independent hysteretic energy dissipation in collagen fibrils
Authors: Robert Magerle, Paul Zech, Martin Dehnert, Alexandra Bendixen, Andreas Otto
Abstract: Nanoindentation cycles measured with an atomic force microscope on hydrated collagen fibrils exhibit a rate-independent hysteresis with return point memory. This previously unknown energy dissipation mechanism describes in unified form elastoplastic indentation, capillary adhesion, and surface leveling at indentation velocities smaller than 1 $\mu$m s$^{-1}$, where viscous friction is negligible. A generic hysteresis model, based on force-distance data measured during one large approach-retract cycle, predicts the force (output) and the dissipated energy for arbitrary indentation trajectories (input). While both quantities are rate independent, they do depend nonlinearly on indentation history and on indentation amplitude.

Title: Spin ordering-induced fully-compensated ferrimagnetism
Authors: San-Dong Guo, Shaobo Chen, Guangzhao Wang
Abstract: Fully-compensated ferrimagnets exhibit zero net magnetic moment yet display non-relativistic global spin splitting, making them highly advantageous for constructing high-performance spintronic devices. The general strategy is to break the inversion symmetry of conventional antiferromagnets or the rotational/mirror symmetry of altermagnets to achieve fully-compensated ferrimagnets. Here, we propose to induce fully-compensated ferrimagnetism by engineering the spin ordering rather than modifying the lattice structure. Bilayer stacking engineering offers a convenient platform to verify our proposal and readily enables switching between two distinct electronic states by tuning the $\mathrm{N\acute{e}el}$ vector of one layer. By the first-principles calculations, a bilayer system is constructed with monolayer $\mathrm{Cr_2C_2S_6}$ as the elementary building block to corroborate our proposal. This strategy can also be extended to inducing altermagnetism via spin ordering engineering. Our work offers an alternative route to realize non-relativistic spin splitting in zero-net-magnetization magnets, paving the way for the advancement and construction of low-power spintronic device.

Title: Chaos in a Nonequilibrium Two-Temperature (Tx, Ty) Nosé-Hoover Cell Model
Authors: Hesam Arabzadeh, Carol Griswold Hoover, William Graham Hoover
Abstract: We revisit a two-temperature Nosé-Hoover wanderer particle embedded in a two-dimensional periodic 2x2 cell with four smooth repulsive corners to explore chaos with anisotropic thermostatting. The model employs separate thermostats in the x and y directions, enabling controlled deviations from equilibrium. By integrating the full six-dimensional equations of motion and computing the complete Lyapunov spectrum, we confirm chaos and quantify phase-space contraction with high numerical precision. The total contraction rate, interpreted as entropy production, grows nonlinearly with the thermostat anisotropy and follows a superquadratic power law, $\Lambda\propto -\delta^{2.44}$, deviating from linear-response theory. The approximate Kaplan-Yorke dimension reveals a fractal attractor that concentrates as |Tx - Ty| increases. Momentum statistics show significant non-Gaussian behavior under strong driving. Despite its dissipative nature, the model remains strictly time-reversible, offering a pedagogically rich example of microscopic reversibility coexisting with macroscopic entropy production.

Title: Quorum sensing of light-activated colloids in nematic liquid crystals
Authors: Antonio Tavera-Vázquez, David Martin, Haijie Ren, Sam Rubin, Andrés Córdoba, Rui Zhang, Vincenzo Vitelli, Juan J. de Pablo
Abstract: Motile living organisms routinely probe their surroundings to adapt in ever-evolving environments. Although synthetic microswimmers offer surrogates for self-propelled living entities, they often lack the complex feedback mechanisms that enable organisms to adapt. In this work, we present an experimental platform in which light-activated colloids dispersed in a nematic liquid crystal can (i) switch from directed to active Brownian motion depending on the nematic anchoring and (ii) mechanically adjust their motility in response to crowding, effectively enforcing quorum-sensing interactions. Both features are caused by a distinctive self-propulsion mechanism as unveiled through experiments, simulations, and theory. We characterize the dynamics of a single colloid and demonstrate that its motion is captured by an active Brownian particle model if the nematic anchoring is homeotropic, and by directed self-propulsion along the nematic director if the anchoring is planar. Next, we investigate the many-body dynamics, showing that it undergoes a clustering phase separation through effective quorum-sensing interactions. Our work suggests how to create adaptive materials with life-like capabilities using readily accessible properties of liquid crystals and colloids without explicitly engineering any of the needed mechano-chemical feedbacks.

Title: Moiré dependent Chern insulators in twisted crystalline flatbands
Authors: Wenxuan Wang, Yijie Wang, Zaizhe Zhang, Zihao Huo, Gengdong Zhou, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, X.C. Xie, Kaihui Liu, Zhida Song, Xiaobo Lu
Abstract: In moiré crystals, the competition between different isospin configurations can be tuned by twist angles and stacking orders, forming various symmetry-broken states. Here we report twisted double rhombohedral-trilayer-gaphene as a new twisted crystalline flatbands system showing rich moiré dependent topological phenomena. For small twist angles, programmable Chern insulators with Chern number C = 3 at integer moiré filling v = 1 have been observed. We have further revealed multiple first-order transitions and an exotic hidden order which can quench the Chern insulator. Interestingly, for a larger twist angle, multiple Chern insulators with C = 1 at fractional fillings including v = 1/4, 1/3 and 1/2 have been observed, whereas the Chern insulator at v = 1 is absent. Our study demonstrated the twisted flatbands from rhombohedral-multilayer-graphene as a new platform to study topological correlated physics, offering a promising pathway toward developing new devices for quantum storage and computation.

Title: Tunable Interlayer Excitons in Bilayer Graphene Nanoribbons
Authors: Alexandre R. Rocha, Rodrigo G. Amorim, Wanderlã L. Scopel, Cesar E. P. Villegas
Abstract: Vertically stacked van der Waals structures are promising platforms that enable layer engineering, opening new avenues for the quantum control of elementary excitations, including optically generated bound electron-hole pairs. Here we employ excited-state density functional calculations to demonstrate strong interlayer excitonic coupling in one-dimensional van der Waals nanostructures derived from armchair graphene nanoribbons. The excitonic response exhibits prominent peaks in the near-infrared range, mainly attributed to intralayer excitons, while interlayer excitations with absorption peak strengths of up to 13\% of the maximum absorption are also observed. Both type-I and type-II band alignments are found, which promote the formation of intralayer and interlayer excitons. Notably, interlayer excitons in these systems exhibit long-lived radiative lifetimes at room temperature, ranging from 1 nanosecond to 9.4 microseconds. Our calculations suggest the potential to tune the excitonic response and lifetimes of bilayer graphene nanoribbons via careful engineering of the stacking order.

Title: Optical Spin Sensing and Metamagnetic Phase Control in the 2D Van der Waals Magnet Yb3+-Doped CrPS4
Authors: Jacob T. Baillie, Kimo Pressler, Nick J. Adams, Faris Horani, Thom J. Snoeren, Rémi Beaulac, Daniel R. Gamelin
Abstract: The emergence of two-dimensional magnets within the van der Waals toolkit has introduced unprecedented opportunities to develop ultrathin spintronic technologies. Strong coupling between spin and optical properties in such materials can further enable novel spin-photonic capabilities of both fundamental and technological interest. Here, we investigate the optical and spin properties of the air-stable, layered A-type antiferromagnet chromium thiophosphate (CrPS4) when doped with Yb3+. We show that the collective spin properties of CrPS4 are encoded in the sharp f-f luminescence of isolated Yb3+ dopants via strong magnetic superexchange coupling between the two, and that spontaneous magnetic ordering in CrPS4 induces large exchange splittings in the narrow Yb3+ f-f photoluminescence features below TN. Spin reorientation in CrPS4 via a "spin-flop" metamagnetic transition modulates the Yb3+ f-f luminescence energies and exchange splittings. This pronounced link between spin and optical properties enables the demonstration of optically driven spin-flop transitions in CrPS4.

Title: Stable hopfions in trapped quantum droplets
Authors: Zibin Zhao, Guilong Li, Huanbo Luo, Bin Liu, Guihua Chen, Boris A. Malomed, Yongyao Li
Abstract: Hopfions are a class of three-dimensional (3D) solitons which are built as vortex tori carrying intrinsic twist of the toroidal core. They are characterized by two independent topological charges, \textit{viz}., vorticity $S$ and winding number $M$ of the intrinsic twist, whose product determines the \textit{Hopf number}, $Q_{H}=MS$, which is the basic characteristic of the hopfions. We construct hopfions as solutions of the 3D Gross-Pitaevskii equations (GPEs) for Bose-Einstein condensates in binary atomic gases. The GPE system includes the cubic mean-field self-attraction, competing with the quartic self-repulsive Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) term, which represents effects of quantum fluctuations around the mean-field state, and a trapping toroidal potential (TP). A systematic numerical analysis demonstrates that families of the states with $S=1,M=0$, i.e., $Q_{H}=0$, are stable, provided that the inner TP\ radius $R_{0}$ exceeds a critical value. Furthermore, true hopfions with $S=1,M=1\sim 7$, which correspond, accordingly, to $Q_{H}=1\sim 7$, also form partly stable families, including the case of the LHY\ superfluid, in which the nonlinearity is represented solely by the LHY term. On the other hand, the hopfion family is completely unstable in the absence of the LHY term, when only the mean-field nonlinearity is present. We illustrate the knot-like structure of the hopfions by means of an elementary geometric picture. For $Q_{H}=0$, circles which represent the \textit{preimage} of the full state do not intersect. On the contrary, for $Q_{H}\geq 1$ they intersect at points whose number is identical to $Q_{H}$. The intersecting curves form multi-petal structures with the number of petals also equal to $Q_{H}$.

Title: Frequency comb in twisted magnonic crystals
Authors: Minghao Li, Zhejunyu Jin, Zhaozhuo Zeng, Peng Yan
Abstract: While twisted magnonic crystals (MCs) have recently gained attention for their intriguing linear phenomena, such as magnon flat bands, their nonlinear dynamics -- particularly the generation of magnonic frequency combs (MFCs) -- have remained largely unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate the creation of MFCs in twisted MCs using two-tone microwave excitation. We find that finite twist angles significantly enhance three-magnon interactions, driven by the non-collinear ground-state magnetic configuration induced by interlayer dipole-dipole interactions. The number of comb teeth exhibits a plateau-like dependence on the twist angle, with the plateau's width and height saturating as the excitation frequency of the propagating magnon mode increases. This behavior reveals an optimal range of twist angles and frequencies for achieving high-quality MFCs with a large number of comb teeth. Our findings deepen the understanding of nonlinear interactions in twisted MCs and highlight their potential for advancing moiré-based materials in information processing and high-precision metrology.

Title: Polarons in two-dimensional polar materials: All-coupling variational theory
Authors: A. Kudlis, V. Shahnazaryan, I. V. Tokatly
Abstract: We present a detailed and self-contained theoretical study of polarons in two-dimensional (2D) polar materials, which extends the classical macroscopic theory of Fröhlich polarons to the 2D case. The theory is fully determined by experimentally accessible parameters, the static and optical 2D polarizabilities of a monolayer, the frequency of transverse optical phonons, and the effective mass of charge carriers. We define a single dimensionless parameter, which characterizes the coupling of electrons with longitudinal optical phonons, analyze both weak- and strong-coupling regimes, and adopt the Feynman variational path-integral approach for a high-quality interpolation between these limits. Our results provide insight into the ground-state energy and effective mass of polarons in the new generation of 2D polar monolayers.

Title: Weak low-temperature ferromagnetism and linear magnetoresistance in Lu$_{0.75}$Fe$_6$Sn$_6$ with a disordered HfFe$_6$Ge$_6$-type structure
Authors: Chenfei Shi, Zhaodi Lin, Qiyuan Liu, Junai Lv, Xiaofan Xu, Baojuan Kang, Jin-Hu Yang, Yi Liu, Jian Zhang, Shixun Cao, Jin-Ke Bao
Abstract: We report the synthesis of Lu$_{0.75}$Fe$_6$Sn$_6$ single crystals with a Fe-kagome lattice using a self-flux method. The crystal structure, magnetic, thermodynamic and electrical transport properties were investigated. Structure refinement reveals that Lu$_{0.75}$Fe$_6$Sn$_6$ has a HfFe$_6$Ge$_6$-type structure as the major framework intergrown with a CoSn-type structure, leading to a vacancy of 25% on the Lu-site and disorder on the Sn-site. It exhibits a significant magnetic anisotropy with weak ferromagnetism in the ab-plane below 40 K and antiferromagnetic behavior along the c-axis. The weak ferromagnetism is due to the canted antiferromagnetism with magnetic moment deviating from the $c$-axis to the ab-plane. Besides, an anisotropic non-saturated linear magnetoresistance is also observed in Lu$_{0.75}$Fe$_6$Sn$_6$, probably resulting from the structural disorder in the sample.

Title: On the statistical physics and thermodynamics of polymer networks: a Eulerian theory for entropic elasticity
Authors: Siyu Wang, Heng Xiao, Lin Zhan
Abstract: This study presents a Eulerian theory to elucidate the molecular kinematics in polymer networks and their connection to continuum deformation, grounded in fundamental statistical physics and thermodynamics. Three key innovations are incorporated: 1. The network behavior is described through a global thermodynamic equilibrium condition that maximizes the number of accessible microstates for all segments, instead of directly dealing with the well-established single-chain models commonly adopted in traditional approaches. A variational problem is then posed in the Eulerian framework to identify this equilibrium state under geometric fluctuation constraints. Its solution recaptures the classical single-chain model and reveals the dependence of chain kinematics upon continuum deformation. 2. The chain stretch and orientation probability are found to be explicitly specified through the Eulerian logarithmic strain and spatial direction. The resulting hyperelastic model, with only two physical parameters, outperforms the extant models with same number of parameters. It further provides a physical justification for prior models exhibiting superior predictive capabilities: the model becomes equivalent to the Biot-chain model at moderate deformations, while converging to the classical Hencky strain energy in the small strain limit. 3.A novel biaxial instability emerges as a phase transition in chain orientation. At sufficiently large deformation, chains increasingly align with the primary stretched direction, depleting their density in other directions. Consequently, the stresses in non-primary stretched directions would decrease as the loss in chain density outweighs the gain in chain force. For equal biaxial tension, instability is therefore triggered because perfect equality of the two principal stretches without any perturbation is practically unachievable.

Title: Indium Hydroxide Ceramic Targets: A Breakthrough in High-Mobility Thin-Film Transistor Technology
Authors: Hikaru Sadahira, Prashant R. Ghediya, Hyeonjun Kong, Akira Miura, Yasutaka Matsuo, Hiromichi Ohta, Yusaku Magari
Abstract: Thin-film transistors composed of a hydrogen-containing indium oxide active layer are promising candidates for backplane devices in next-generation flat panel displays, offering higher definition and faster operation. However, the hydrogen incorporation process during film deposition poses challenges for scalable and industrial development due to both safety and controllability issues. Here, we demonstrate that using indium hydroxide ceramic as the target material for film deposition overcomes the difficulties associated with hydrogen gas usage. We sintered commercially available indium hydroxide powder using a conventional ceramic process at 150-250°C in air and utilized it for the deposition of hydrogen-incorporated indium oxide films via pulsed laser deposition. The resulting indium oxide films, after thermal annealing, contained a sufficient concentration of hydrogen and exhibited very high electron mobility due to significantly grown grains. Furthermore, we confirmed that the fabricated thin-film transistors exhibited comparably high performance to those produced using the gas-phase hydrogen incorporation method. This approach offers a practical pathway for hydrogen-containing indium oxide-based thin-film transistors in next-generation flat panel displays.

Title: Adiabatic nonabelian braiding of imperfect Majoranas
Authors: Maximilian Nitsch, Viktor Svensson, William Samuelson, Konstantin Nestmann, Jeroen Danon, Karsten Flensberg, Rubén Seoane Souto, Martin Leijnse
Abstract: Demonstration of a nontrivial result of quasiparticle exchange (or braiding) is usually considered the definitive proof of a topological phase with nonabelian excitations, such as Majorana bound states (MBSs). However, in finite systems with disorder and smooth potential variations, the MBSs are imperfect in the sense that they are not fully isolated in space and can, to a varying degree, resemble conventional fermions. Here, we study the braiding properties of isolated MBSs, regular fermions, and anything in between. We find a way to compensate for the undesired splitting of the ground-state degeneracy which occurs during the protocol for imperfect MBS. This leads to a braiding outcome that depends on the degree of MBS isolation but remains robust and nonabelian except in the perfect fermion limit. Our protocol could be implemented in different platforms with nonabelian excitations, including quantum-dot-based minimal Kitaev chains.

Title: Markov dualities via the spectral decompositions of the two Markov generators in their bi-orthogonal basis of right and left eigenvectors
Authors: Cecile Monthus
Abstract: The notion of Markov duality between two Markov processes that can live in two different configurations spaces $(x,{\tilde x})$ is revisited via the spectral decompositions of the two Markov generators in their bi-orthogonal basis of right and left eigenvectors. In this formulation, the two generators should have the same eigenvalues $(-E)$ that may be complex, while the duality function $\Omega(x,{\tilde x})$ can be considered as a mapping between the right and the left eigenvectors of the two models. We describe how this spectral perspective is useful to better understand two well-known dualities between processes defined in the same configuration space: the Time-Reversal duality corresponds to an exchange between the right and the left eigenvectors that involves the steady state, while in the Siegmund duality, the left eigenvectors correspond to integrals of the dual right eigenvectors. We then focus on the famous Moment-Duality between the Wright-Fisher diffusion on the interval $x \in [0,1] $ and the Kingman Markov jump process on the semi-infinite lattice $n \in {\mathbb N}$ in order to analyze the relations between their eigenvectors living in two different configuration spaces. Finally, we discuss how the spectral perspective can be used to construct new dualities and we give an example for the case of non-degenerate real eigenvalues, where one can always construct a dual Directed Jump process on the semi-infinite lattice $n \in {\mathbb N}$, whose transitions rates are the opposite-eigenvalues.

Title: Internal dynamics and dielectric screening of confined multiexciton states
Authors: Josep Planelles, Juan I. Climente, Jose L. Movilla
Abstract: Recent experimental and computational studies suggest that biexcitons (BX) confined in large CsPbBr$_3$ nanocrystals experience reduced dielectric screening as compared to excitons (X) and trions (X$^*$). Here we provide a physical rationale to explain such a behavior. A characteristic frequency is introduced, which describes the internal dynamics of an exciton within the excitonic complex. By means of effective mass--variational Quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we show that, in large nanocrystals, the frequency is similar for X and X$^*$, but smaller for BX. Because the frequencies exceed that of the bulk longitudinal optical phonon, this leads to a reduced dielectric constant for BX, which is in contrast with the behavior of strongly confined nanocrystals.

Title: Near transform-limited single photons from rapid-thermal annealed quantum dots
Authors: Hendrik Mannel, Fabio Rimek, Marcel Zoellner, Nico Schwarz, Andreas D. Wieck, Nikolai Bart, Arne Ludwig, Martin Geller
Abstract: Single-photon emitters are essential components for quantum communication systems, enabling applications such as secure quantum key distribution and the long-term vision of a quantum internet. Among various candidates, self-assembled InAs/GaAs quantum dots (QDs) remain highly promising due to their ability to emit coherent and indistinguishable photons, as well as their compatibility with photonic integration. In this work, we investigate the impact of post-growth rapid thermal annealing (RTA) on the quantum optical properties of single self-assembled QDs embedded in a p-i-n diode structure. The annealing process induces a controlled blueshift of the emission wavelength by promoting Ga in-diffusion and intermixing. Using resonance fluorescence measurements at cryogenic temperatures (4.2 K), we investigate the single-photon statistics, the emission linewidths, and coherence time $T_2$ of the emitted photons. Our results show that, despite the high annealing temperature of $760^\circ$C, the process does not degrade the optical quality of the quantum dots strongly. Instead, we observe single-photon emission with near transform-limited linewidths, where the dephasing time $T_2$ is only a factor 1.5 above the Fourier-limit $T_2=2T_1$. These findings demonstrate that rapid thermal annealing (RTA) serves as an effective tuning method that preserves the key single-photon emission properties and may help reduce undesirable effects such as non-radiative Auger recombination in quantum photonic applications.

Title: Hidden fully-compensated ferrimagnetism
Authors: San-Dong Guo
Abstract: Incorporating zero-net-magnetization magnets that exhibit spin-splitting into spintronics delivers key advantages: faster switching dynamics, greater immunity to destabilizing fields, lower power consumption, and markedly improved overall efficiency. The collinear magnets with net-zero magnetization and spin-splitting mainly include altermagnet and fully-compensated ferrimagnet, which provide possibility to achieve hidden spin polarization (HSP) with net-zero spin polarization in total but non-zero local spin polarization. In addition to proposal of hidden altermagnetism, we hereby introduce this concept of hidden fully-compensated ferrimagnetism, where the total spin polarization is zero, but either of the two inversion-partner sectors possesses fully-compensated ferrimagnetism with non-zero local spin polarization in the real space. By the first-principle calculations, we predict that $PT$-bilayer $\mathrm{CrMoC_2S_6}$ is a possible hidden fully-compensated ferrimagnet, showing fully-compensated ferrimagnetic HSP, which can be separated and observed by an out-of-plane external electric field. Our works provide a class of hidden spin-polarized materials that facilitates the advancement of spintronics.

Title: Topologically nontrivial multicritical points
Authors: Ranjith R Kumar, Pasquale Marra
Abstract: Recently, the intriguing interplay between topology and quantum criticality has been unveiled in one-dimensional topological chains with extended nearest-neighbor couplings. In these systems, topologically distinct critical phases emerge with localized edge modes despite the vanishing bulk gap. In this work, we study the topological multicritical points at which distinct gapped and critical phases intersect. Specifically, we consider a topological chain with coupling up to the third nearest neighbors, which shows stable localized edge modes at the multicritical points. These points possess only nontrivial gapped and critical phases around them and are also characterized by the quadratic dispersion around the gap-closing points. We characterize the topological multicritical points in terms of the topological invariant obtained from the zeros of the complex function associated with the Hamiltonian. Further, we analyze the nature of zeros in the vicinity of the multicritical points by calculating the discriminants of the associated polynomial. The discriminant uniquely identifies the topological multicritical points and distinguishes them from the trivial ones. We finally study the robustness of the zero-energy modes at the multicritical points at weak disorder strengths, and reveal the presence of a topologically nontrivial gapless Anderson-localized phase at strong disorder strengths.

Title: Reviving the Search for Indium-Based Superconductors: Theoretical Prediction of Semimetallic Superconductivity in Cubic Nd$_3$In
Authors: Arafat Rahman, Alamgir Kabir, Tareq Mahmud
Abstract: The quest for materials that simultaneously exhibit superconductivity and non trivial topology has drawn significant attention in recent years, driven by their potential to host exotic quantum states. Their unique coexistence often leads to rich physics and potential applications in quantum technologies. Here, we predict cubic Nd$_3$In as an exceptional candidate in this class, combining strong-coupling superconductivity with distinctive topological features. Using first-principles calculations, we find that the strong-coupling superconductivity in Nd$_3$In arises primarily due to pronounced Fermi surface nesting, leading to an electron-phonon coupling constant of $\lambda = 1.39$. Our fully anisotropic Migdal--Eliashberg analysis yields a superconducting transition temperature $T_c \approx 14$ K at ambient pressure, increasing to 18 K under 15 GPa. Beyond superconductivity, Nd$_3$In is found to be a Weyl semimetal, as evidenced by the presence of Fermi arcs and nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariants, confirming its topological nature. The combination of strong-coupling superconductivity and nontrivial topological states makes Nd$_3$In a promising candidate for quantum transport and topological quantum computation.

Title: Quantum phase transition driven by competing intralayer and interlayer hopping of Ni-$d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals in bilayer nickelates
Authors: Xiaoyu Zhu, Wei Qin, Ping Cui, Zhenyu Zhang
Abstract: Bilayer nickelates exhibit high-temperature superconductivity under proper hydrostatic pressure or epitaxial strain, signifying the emergence of quantum phase transitions whose physical mechanisms remain unclear. Using a minimal bilayer Hubbard model incorporating only the essential Ni-$d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals, we demonstrate that a phase transition naturally arises from tuning the ratio of intralayer to interlayer hopping amplitudes. The transition point separates regimes with a rich interplay between superconducting and density-wave orders. In the regime with weaker intralayer hopping, quasi-long-range spin-density-wave and pair-density-wave orders coexist, with the former being dominant. Across the transition, the spin-density-wave order becomes short-ranged, accompanied by the emergence of the quasi-long-range charge-density-wave order. Most significantly, superconductivity is dramatically enhanced in this regime, though it no longer exhibits the pair-density-wave signature. This quantum phase transition, driven by the competition between intralayer and interlayer hopping, provides a plausible microscopic explanation for the experimentally observed correlation between the superconducting transition temperature and ratio of out-of-plane to in-plane lattice constants. Our findings may assist future efforts in optimizing experimental conditions to further enhance superconductivity in bilayer nickelates.

Title: Dipole-Induced Transition in 3-Dimensions
Authors: Itamar Procaccia, Tuhin Samanta
Abstract: The Kosterlitz-Thouless and the Hexatic phase transitions are celebrated examples of dipole (vortex, dislocation) induced transitions in condensed matter physics. For very clear reasons, these important ``topological" transitions are restricted to 2-dimensions. Here we present a genuine dipole-induced transition in the 3-dimensional response of (athermal) amorphous solids to applied strain. Similarly to the existence of a hexatic phase between normal solid and fluid, we identify an intermediate phase between a phase of normal elastic response at high pressure, and fluid matter at zero pressure. The mechanical response in the intermediate phase is accompanied by plasticity that is generically associated with ``non-affine" quadrupolar events seen in the resulting displacement field. Gradients of the quadrupolar fields act as dipole charges that screen elasticity, breaking both translational and Chiral symmetries. We highlight {\em angular} correlations that exhibit diverging correlation lengths at this transition and determine the critical scaling exponents.

Title: Significant electron-magnon scattering in layered ferromagnet Cr$_2$Te$_3$
Authors: Yujun Wang, Shunzhen Wang, Masashi Kawaguchi, Jun Uzuhashi, Akhilesh Kumar Patel, Kenji Nawa, Yuya Sakuraba, Tadakatsu Ohkubo, Hiroshi Kohno, Masamitsu Hayashi
Abstract: A layered ferromagnet Cr$_2$Te$_3$ is attracting growing interest because of its unique electronic and magnetic properties. Studies have shown that it exhibits sizable anomalous Hall effect (AHE) that changes sign with temperature. The origin of the AHE and the sign change, however, remains elusive. Here we show experimentally that electron-magnon scattering significantly contributes to the AHE in Cr$_2$Te$_3$ through magnon induced skew scattering, and that the sign change is caused by the competition with the Berry-curvature or impurity-induced side-jump contribution. The electron-magnon skew scattering is expected to arise from the exchange interaction between the itinerant Te $p$-electrons and the localized Cr $d$-electrons modified by the strong spin-orbit coupling on Te. These results suggest that the magnon-induced skew scattering can dominate the AHE in layered ferromagnets with heavy elements.

Title: Wallpaper Group-Based Mechanical Metamaterials: Dataset Including Mechanical Responses
Authors: Fleur Hendriks, Vlado Menkovski, Martin Doškář, Marc G.D. Geers, Kevin Verbeek, Ondřej Rokoš
Abstract: Mechanical metamaterials often exhibit pattern transformations through instabilities, enabling applications in, e.g., soft robotics, sound reduction, and biomedicine. These transformations and their resulting mechanical properties are closely tied to the symmetries in these metamaterials' microstructures, which remain under-explored. Designing such materials is challenging due to the unbounded design space, and while machine learning offers promising tools, they require extensive training data. Here, we present a large dataset of 2D microstructures and their macroscopic mechanical responses in the hyperelastic, finite-strain regime, including buckling. The microstructures are generated using a novel method, which covers all 17 wallpaper symmetry groups and employs Bézier curves for a rich parametric space. Mechanical responses are obtained through finite element-based computational homogenization. The dataset includes 1,020 distinct geometries, each subjected to 12 loading trajectories, totaling 12,240 trajectories. Our dataset supports the development and benchmarking of surrogate models, facilitates the study of symmetry-property relationships, and enables investigations into symmetry-breaking during pattern transformations, potentially revealing emergent behavior in mechanical metamaterials.

Title: First-passage statistics of random walks: a general approach via Riemann-Hilbert problems
Authors: Mattia Radice, Giampaolo Cristadoro
Abstract: We study first-passage statistics for one-dimensional random walks $S_n$ with independent and identically distributed jumps starting from the origin. We focus on the joint distribution of the first-passage time $\tau_b$ and first-passage position $S_{\tau_b}$ beyond a threshold $b\geq0$, as well as the distribution of $S_n$ for the walks that do not cross $b$ up to step $n$. By solving suitable Riemann-Hilbert problems, we are able to obtain exact and semi-explicit general formulae for the quantities of interest. Notably, such formulae are written solely in terms of the characteristic function of the jumps. In contrast with previous results, our approach is universally valid, applicable to both continuous and discrete, symmetric and asymmetric jump distributions. We complement our theoretical findings with explicit examples.

Title: Field-induced spin continuum in twin-free Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$ revealed by magneto-THz spectroscopy
Authors: Rongsheng Li, Liyu Shi, Yuchen Gu, Yue Chen, Xintong Li, Qiong Wu, Shuxiang Xu, Dong Wu, Yuan Li, Fa Wang, Tao Dong, Nanlin Wang
Abstract: The honeycomb magnet Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$ recently emerged as a promising candidate for realizing Kitaev quantum spin liquid with relatively low levels of structural disorder. While the precise spin Hamiltonian remains controversial, the potential existence of a quantum spin liquid or other novel quantum magnetic phases continues to stimulate investigation. Here, we study the temperature and magnetic field-dependent spin excitations of Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$ on a twin-free single crystal using magneto-terahertz (THz) spectroscopy, focusing on magnetic anisotropy and field-induced unusual phases. We observe a low-energy continuum excitation above $T_N$ and a 0.5 THz (2 meV) spin wave excitation in magnetic order under zero field. Upon applying an in-plane magnetic field, the spin waves transform to a magnetic continuum over an intermediate field range, above which the system enters a spin-polarized state. Crucially, the spin excitation spectra reveal striking anisotropy between the $\textbf{a}$ and $\textbf{b}$ crystallographic axes, demanding description by a strongly anisotropic spin model. These findings establish Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$ as a model system for investigating field-tunable quantum magnetism and potential spin liquid behavior in highly anisotropic systems.

Title: Quantum fluctuations in two-dimensional altermagnets
Authors: Niklas Cichutek, Peter Kopietz, Andreas Rückriegel
Abstract: The magnetic properties of two-dimensional altermagnets can be obtained from a square lattice Heisenberg model with antiferromagetic nearest neighbor interaction and two types of next-nearest neighbor interactions arranged in a checkerboard pattern. Using nonlinear spin-wave theory we calculate for this model the corrections to the renormalized magnon spectrum and the staggered magnetization to first order in the inverse spin quantum number $1/S$. We also show that to order $1/S^2$ the ground state energy is not sensitive to the component of the interaction which is responsible for altermagnetism. At the $\Gamma$-point the $1/S$-correction to the magnon dispersion vanishes so that quantum fluctuations do not induce a gap in the magnon spectrum of altermagnets, as expected by Goldstone's theorem. We extract the leading $1/S$-corrections to the spin-wave velocity and the effective mass characterizing the curvature of the magnon dispersion in altermagnets.

Title: Suppression of capillary instability in a confined quantum liquid filament
Authors: Francesco Ancilotto, Michele Modugno, Chiara Fort
Abstract: Quantum Bose-Bose mixtures with strong attraction can form self-bound, liquid-like droplets stabilized by quantum fluctuations. Despite equilibrium densities much lower than those of classical liquids, these droplets exhibit finite surface tension and liquid-like behaviors. Recent experiments have demonstrated Rayleigh-Plateau instability in elongated droplets confined in an optical waveguide. Here we consider the case of an infinite filament and extend the theoretical description to include transverse harmonic confinement. By solving the Bogoliubov-deGennes equations within a single-component framework, benchmarked against full Gross-Pitaevskii simulations, we show that increasing confinement progressively suppresses the instability, leading to complete stabilization beyond a critical trap frequency.

Abstract: Cold-sprayed metallic deposits are additively manufactured materials containing high levels of compressive residual stress. Here we show that the presence and intensity of this stress can be analyzed using laser-ultrasonics, provided that the sprayed material is ferromagnetic and magnetostrictive, as in the case of pure nickel. Contactless resonant ultrasound spectroscopy is used to monitor the evolution of shear modulus and internal friction parameter of two polycrystalline Ni deposits with temperature over the Curie point, which enables a direct assessment of the strength of magneto-elastic softening that is known to be strongly stress-dependent. In addition, the proposed methodology is also shown to be suitable for in-situ observation of the recrystallization process in the vicinity of the Curie point, as well as inspecting the homogeneity of the residual stress level across the thickness of the cold-sprayed deposit. Finally, a methodology for room-temperature probing of the magnetoelastic coupling is proposed and tested on the examined materials.

Title: Diagnosing phase transitions through time scale entanglement
Authors: Stefan Rohshap, Hirone Ishida, Frederic Bippus, Anna Kauch, Karsten Held, Hiroshi Shinaoka, Markus Wallerberger
Abstract: We propose a new method based on the compression of arbitrary multi-point correlators into quantics tensor trains and studying its so called bond dimension as an indicator of time scale entanglement in the system. This quantics tensor train diagnostics approach allows us to i) identify quantum phase transitions (ground state crossings) and thermal crossovers, ii) distinguish between these two by allowing flexibility through iii) using arbitrary available correlators and iv) the possibility to deal with low-accuracy input data through varying the quantics tensor train cutoffs. We verify the validity of the approach by studying the phase diagram of the Hubbard dimer, the four-site Hubbard ring with and without next-nearest neighbor hopping and the single-impurity Anderson model. We find time scale entanglement to be a system-inherent property becoming maximal at phase transitions and crossover, which translates to peaks in the quantics tensor train bond dimension of correlator functions. Additionally, the connection of the method to other physical quantities, such as various entanglement measures and susceptibilities, is shown.

Title: Sub-microsecond electric switching of large birefringence in the isotropic phase of ferroelectric nematics
Authors: Kamal Thapa, Sathyanarayana Paladugu, Oleg D. Lavrentovich
Abstract: Conventional nonpolar nematic liquid crystals, widely known for their successful display applications, are not well-suited for fast electro-optical switching because of the slow (milliseconds) field-off relaxation of the director. In this work, we demonstrate sub-microsecond field-on and field-off switching of a large (~0.1) birefringence by applying a moderate electric field (30-100) V/{\mu}m, to an isotropic film of a ferroelectric nematic material. This highly efficient electro-optical switching is rooted in the recently discovered field-induced isotropic to ferroelectric nematic phase transition [J. Szydlowska et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 216802 (2023)]. The demonstrated sub-microsecond switching of ferroelectric birefringence induced by field (FBIF) has the potential for applications in fast-switching electro-optic devices, such as phase modulators, light shutters, beam steerers, switchable optical compensators.

Title: Diverse polymorphism in Ruddlesden-Popper chalcogenides
Authors: Prakriti Kayastha, Erik Fransson, Paul Erhart, Lucy Whalley
Abstract: Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) chalcogenides are stable, non-toxic candidates for optoelectronic or thermoelectric applications. The structural diversity of RP oxides is already exploited to tune properties or achieve more advanced functionalities like multiferroicity, however, little is known about the structural evolution of RP chalcogenides. In this work, we develop a high-accuracy machine-learned interatomic potential to run large-scale molecular dynamics simulations on $Ba_{n+1}Zr_nS_{3n+1}$ for $n=1$ to $n=6$. We predict new polymorphs for each $n$-value, calculate their corresponding phase transition temperatures, and validate our approach through comparison to published experimental results. We find that the $n=1$ phase exhibits negative thermal expansion, that $n=1$ and $n=3$ undergo unusual ascending symmetry breaking, and that phases with $n\geq4$ form layer-dependent tilt patterns previously unreported for inorganic RP materials. This unique behaviour results from competition between octahedral rotations and rumpling at the rocksalt interface, and suggests new strategies for accessing advanced functionalities.

Title: Optimized Synthesis and Device Integration of Long 17-Atom-Wide Armchair Graphene Nanoribbons
Authors: Jeong Ha Hwang, Nicolò Bassi, Mayada Fadel, Oliver Braun, Tim Dumslaff, Carlo Pignedoli, Michael Stiefel, Roman Furrer, Hironobu Hayashi, Hiroko Yamada, Akimitsu Narita, Klaus Müllen, Michel Calame, Mickael L. Perrin, Roman Fasel, Pascal Ruffieux, Vincent Meunier, Gabriela Borin Barin
Abstract: Seventeen-carbon-atom-wide armchair graphene nanoribbons (17-AGNRs) are promising candidates for high-performance electronic devices due to their narrow electronic bandgap. Atomic precision in edge structure and width control is achieved through a bottom-up on-surface synthesis (OSS) approach from tailored molecular precursors in ultra-high vacuum (UHV). This synthetic protocol must be optimized to meet the structural requirements for device integration, with ribbon length being the most critical parameter. Here, we report optimized OSS conditions that produce 17-AGNRs with an average length of approximately 17 nm. This length enhancement is achieved through a gradual temperature ramping during an extended annealing period, combined with a template-like effect driven by monomer assembly at high surface coverage. The resulting 17-AGNRs are comprehensively characterized in UHV using scanning probe techniques and Raman spectroscopy. Raman measurements following substrate transfer enabled the characterization of the length distribution of GNRs on the device substrate and confirmed their stability under ambient conditions and harsh chemical environments, including acid vapors and etchants. The increased length and ambient stability of the 17-AGNRs lead to their reliable integration into device architectures. As a proof of concept, we integrate 17-AGNRs into field-effect transistors (FET) with graphene electrodes and confirm that electronic transport occurs through the GNRs. This work demonstrates the feasibility of integrating narrow-bandgap GNRs into functional devices and contributes to advancing the development of carbon-based nanoelectronics.

Title: Localization Transition for Interacting Quantum Particles in Colored-Noise Disorder
Authors: Giacomo Morpurgo, Laurent Sanchez-Palencia, Thierry Giamarchi
Abstract: We investigate the localization transition of interacting particles in a one-dimensional correlated disorder system. The disorder which we investigate allows for vanishing backwards scattering processes. We derive by two renormalization group procedures its phase diagram and predict that the localization transition point is shifted from finite attractive interaction to the non-interacting point. We finally show numerically that the scaling of the localization length with the disorder strength deviates from the usual scaling of a localized phase.

Title: A supramolecular ferroelectric with two sublattices and polarization dependent conductivity
Authors: H. Mager, M. Litterst, Sophia Klubertz, S.V. Haridas, O. Shyshov, M. von Delius, M. Kemerink
Abstract: The possibility to combine and finetune properties of functional molecular materials by chemical design is particularly relevant for organic ferroelectrics. In this work, we investigate a class of organic molecular materials that show long-range supramolecular organization into fibrillar bundles. In solid state, the material shows ferroelectric behavior resulting from two largely independent dipolar moieties that show up as two separate coercive fields in polarization-hysteresis and capacitance-voltage curves. Moreover, the material shows a long-range electronic conductivity that arises due to oxidation at the positive electrode, followed by electron transfer between neighboring molecules. We find that this conductivity is modulated by the direction and degree of ferroelectric polarization, which we interpret in terms of injection barrier modulation at low electric fields and a recently developed framework for asymmetric polaron hopping at high fields. With two distinct, partially independent dipolar moieties offering the possibility to use ferroelectric properties to modulate conductance, the materials presented herein are a promising basis for multifunctional materials.

Title: $β$-FPUT chains under time-periodic forcing
Authors: Shiva Darshan, Alessandra Iacobucci, Stefano Olla, Gabriel Stoltz
Abstract: Recent works proved a hydrodynamic limit for periodically forced atom chains with harmonic interaction and pinning, together with momentum flip. When energy is the only conserved quantity, one would expect similar results in the anharmonic case, as conjectured for the temperature profile and energy flux. However, outside the harmonic case, explicit computations are generally no longer possible, thus making a rigorous proof of this hydrodynamic limit difficult. Consequently, we numerically investigate the plausibility of this limit for the particular case of a chain with $\beta$-FPUT interactions and harmonic pinning. We present our simulation results suggesting that the conjectured PDE for the limiting temperature profile and Green--Kubo type formula for the limiting energy current conjectured are correct. We then use this Green--Kubo type formula to investigate the relationship between the energy current and period of the forcing. This relationship is investigated in the case of significant rate of momentum flip, small rate of momentum flip and no momentum flip. We compare the relationship observed in the anharmonic case to that of the harmonic case for which explicit formulae are available.

Title: Coulomb blockade thermometry based nanocalorimetry
Authors: Mari C. Cole, Maximilian T. Pelly, Craig V. Topping, Thomas Reindl, Ulrike Waizmann, Jürgan Weis, Andreas W. Rost
Abstract: Specific heat is a powerful probe offering insights into the entropy and excitation spectrum of the studied material. While it is well established, a key challenge remains the measurements of microcrystals or thin films especially in the sub-Kelvin, high magnetic field regime. Here we present a setup combining the high sensitivity of SiN$_x$ membrane based calorimetry with the absolute accuracy of Coulomb blockade thermometry to realise a nanocalorimeter for such tasks. The magnetic field independent technique of Coulomb blockade thermometry provides an on-platform thermometer combining a primary thermometry mode for in-situ calibration with a fast secondary mode suitable for specific heat measurements. The setup is validated using measurements of a 20 $\mu$g sample of Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ achieving a resolution on the order of 0.1 nJ/K at 500 mK and an absolute accuracy limited by the determination of the sample's mass. Measurements of CeRh$_2$As$_2$ further highlight the benefits of measuring microcrystals with such a device.

Title: Channel Formation Enhances Target Consumption by Chemotactic Active Brownian Particles
Authors: Vladimir Yu. Rudyak, Shahar Shinehorn, Yael Roichman
Abstract: In many situations, simply finding a target during a search is not enough. It is equally important to be able to return to that target repeatedly or to enable a larger community to locate and utilize it. While first passage time is commonly used to measure search success, relatively little is known about increasing the average rate of target encounters over time. Here, using an active Brownian particle model with chemotaxis, we demonstrate that when a searcher has no memory and there is no communication among multiple searchers, encoding information about the target's location in the environment outperforms purely memoryless strategies by boosting the overall hit rate. We further show that this approach reduces the impact of target size on a successful search and increases the total utilization time of the target.

Title: Unveiling Zn incorporation in CuInS$_2$ quantum dots: X-ray and optical analysis of doping effects, structural modifications and surface passivation

Collet, Lázaro García, Víctor Vega-Mayoral, Saül Garcia-Orrit, Iciar Arnay, Juan Cabanillas-González, Laura Simonelli, Ana Flávia Nogueira, Marco Antônio Schiavon, Thomas J. Penfold, Lazaro A. Padilha, Wojciech Gawelda
Abstract: Quantum dots (QDs) exhibit unique properties arising from their reduced size and quantum confinement effects, including exceptionally bright and tunable photoluminescence. Among these, CuInS$_{2}$ QDs have gained significant attention owing to their remarkable broadband emission, making them highly desirable for various optoelectronic applications requiring efficient luminescent nanomaterials. However, maximizing radiative recombination in CuInS$_{2}$ QDs often necessitates minimizing intragap trap states. A common approach involves the introduction of Zn during the synthesis, which typically promotes the formation of a ZnS shell that passivates the QD surface. Despite its importance, the characterization and quantification of Zn incorporation using conventional techniques, such as optical spectroscopy or electron microscopy, remains challenging. In this study, we utilized X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), in both X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectral ranges, to investigate Zn incorporation into CuInS$_{2}$ QDs with element-specific precision. This approach allowed us to detect the formation of a ZnS surface shell and to resolve the spatial distribution of Zn atoms within the QD lattice, distinguishing between Zn as a substituent, or as an interstitial defect. Additionally, we explored the optical and dynamical properties of CuInS$_{2}$ QDs using time-resolved optical spectroscopies, particularly in the presence of electron and hole acceptors. These results provide deeper insights into the role and effectiveness of the Zn-induced passivating layer, paving the way for optimizing QD performance in photoluminescence applications.

Title: Diverse high-Chern-number quantum anomalous Hall insulators in twisted rhombohedral graphene
Authors: Naitian Liu, Zhangyuan Chen, Jing Ding, Wenqiang Zhou, Hanxiao Xiang, Xinjie Fang, Linfeng Wu, Xiaowan Zhan, Le Zhang, Qianmei Chen, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Na Xin, Shuigang Xu
Abstract: Quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulators with high Chern number (C) enables multiple dissipationless edge channels for low-power-consumption electronics. We report the realization of multiple high-C QAH insulators including C=3,5,6, and 7 in twisted monolayer-rhombohedral pentalayer graphene. In twist angles of approximately 1.40°, we observe QAH effect with C=5 at a filling of one electron per moiré unit cell, persisting up to 2 Kelvin. Furthermore, incommensurate QAH insulators with C=5,6, and 7 emerge at partial fillings. In twist angles of 0.89°, Chern insulators with C=3 and C=6 appear at fillings of two and three electrons, respectively. Our findings establish twisted rhombohedral multilayer graphene as a highly tunable platform for multichannel, dissipationless electronics and for the exploration of exotic quantum Hall states beyond traditional Landau level paradigm.

Title: Geometric Criticality in Scale-Invariant Networks
Authors: Lorenzo Lucarini, Giulio Cimini, Pablo Villegas
Abstract: Dimension in physical systems determines universal properties at criticality. Yet, the impact of structural perturbations on dimensionality remains largely unexplored. Here, we characterize the attraction basins of structural fixed points in scale-invariant networks from a renormalization group perspective, demonstrating that basin stability connects to a structural phase transition. This topology-dependent effect, which we term geometric criticality, triggers a geometric breakdown hereto unknown, which induces non-trivial fractal dimensions and unveils hidden flows toward unstable structural fixed points. Our systematic study of how networks and lattices respond to disorder paves the way for future analysis of non-ergodic behavior induced by quenched disorder.

Title: Odd-even parity dependent transport in an annular Kitaev chain
Authors: Wei Wang, Zhen-Gang Zhu, Gang Su
Abstract: We investigate the impact of magnetic flux and the odd-even parity of lattice points $N$ on electron transport in an annular Kitaev chain, with an explanation provided from the energy band perspective. Three transport mechanisms including direct transmission (DT), local Andreev reflection (LAR) and crossed Andreev reflection (CAR) are considered. In particular, the connection configuration of electrodes to different lattice sites is studied, where the case that the two electrodes connected to the sites are aligned along a diameter is called as symmetric connection and otherwise as asymmetric connections. For even $N$ and asymmetric connection, the vanished LAR and CAR in symmetric connection will emerge as peaks. A more prominent observation is that the symmetry of the two resonant peaks due to DT processes located at $\phi = \pi/3$ and $\phi = 2\pi/3$ for symmetric connection will be broken, and the peak at $\phi = \pi/3$ will be largely reduced, where $\phi$ is the magnetic flux per site. Moreover, the peaks around $\phi = \pi/3$ due to LAR and CAR processes grows drastically even larger than that from DT. For LAR and CAR processes, there is no peak around $\phi = 2\pi/3$ and transmission due to these two processes are completely suppressed for $\phi>\pi/2$. Moreover, it is found that the energy bands vary with $\phi$ in a period of $\pi$ and $2\pi$ for even or odd $N$. These behaviors reflect a complicated competition from DT, LAR and CAR processes and the parity of the lattice number in the Kitaev ring, which will be interested for the quantum device based on Kitaev chain.

Title: Implementation of the magnetic force theorem for large-scale calculations of magnon bands: application to yttrium iron garnet
Authors: Thorbjørn Skovhus, Varun Rajeev Pavizhakumari, Thomas Olsen
Abstract: We present an efficient implementation of the magnetic force theorem which allows for direct evaluation of exchange parameters in q-space. The exchange parameters are calculated directly from Bloch states and the implementation does not rely on any mapping onto localized orbitals. This renders the approach well suited for high-throughput computations, where the construction of a localized basis set (for example Wannier functions) often is impractical. We demonstrate the versatility of the method by applying it to yttrium iron garnet, where we obtain excellent agreement with the experimental magnon dispersion without any prior assumptions of important exchange pathways. In particular, the calculations reveal the existence of several inequivalent exchange pathways associated with the same interatomic distances. Performing such calculations in q-space fully accounts for long-range exchange interactions and provides a convenient route for validating models obtained by fitting to inelastic neutron scattering data.

Title: Magnetic ground state and persistent spin fluctuations in triangular-lattice antiferromagnet NdZnAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$
Authors: Yantao Cao, Huanpeng Bu, Toni Shiroka, Helen C. Walker, Zhendong Fu, Zhaoming Tian, Jinkui Zhao, Hanjie Guo
Abstract: Rare-earth triangular-lattice magnets serve as an excellent platform for investigating exotic quantum magnetic phenomena. Recently, the hexaaluminate \cmao\ has been proposed to host a $U(1)$ Dirac quantum spin liquid state with dominant Ising anisotropy. Here, we report a systematic study of its analogue, \nzao, employing ac susceptibility, inelastic neutron scattering, and muon spin relaxation measurements. Inelastic neutron scattering measurements establish a well-defined $J_\mathrm{eff}$ = 1/2 ground state with moderate Ising anisotropy ($g_c$ = 4.54, $g_\mathrm{ab}$ = 1.42). Muon spin relaxation measurements reveal persistent fluctuations emerging below $\sim$15\,K, and extending down to at least 0.28 K. AC susceptibility data further indicate an absence of magnetic ordering or spin freezing down to 50\,mK, despite an overall antiferromagnetic interaction with the Curie-Weiss temprature of $-0.42$\,K. These results suggest that \nzao\ is a good candidate material for realizing a quantum spin liquid state.

Title: Large ferromagnetic-like band splitting in ultrathin ${\mathrm{SmC}}_{6}$ films
Authors: Hao Zheng, Yifu Xu, Guowei Yang, Ze Pan, Yi Wu, Yuan Zheng, Tulai Sun, Jiefeng Cao, Yi-feng Yang, Ming Shi, Chao Cao, Yang Liu
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) magnetic materials provide a unique platform for exploring quantum phases from magnetic order in reduced dimensions. While there have been extensive studies on 2D magnetic materials based on 3$d$ electrons, experimental studies on 4$f$-electron counterparts are far fewer, particularly on their electronic structure. In this study, we report the successful synthesis of ultrathin ${\mathrm{SmC}}_{6}$ films using molecular beam epitaxy. Utilizing in situ angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we uncover a large band splitting in the valence bands, which we attribute to the ferromagnetic order driven by exchange couplings between Sm 4$f$ moments and conduction electrons. Despite the small magnetic moment of Sm, the observed splitting is comparable to those of Eu- and Gd-based systems with much larger local moments. Interestingly, the surface state also exhibits splitting with similar magnitude and can be eliminated by overannealing, while the valence bands with ferromagnetic-like splittings remain robust. Our work provides spectroscopic insight to understand the electronic origin of magnetic order in Sm-based compounds. Our study also offers a platform to study 2D magnetic materials based on 4$f$ electrons.

Title: Transverse Spin Supercurrent at p-wave magnetic Josephson Junctions
Authors: Morteza Salehi
Abstract: We theoretically study a Josephson junction consisting of s-wave superconductors and a p-wave magnet. We find that in the presence of a strength vector of p-wave magnet, the electrons' and holes' dispersion relation shifts in the k-space. Additionally, we demonstrate that the perpendicular component of the strength vector converts Andreev bound states into Andreev modes that can propagate along the junction's interfaces. These modes create a transverse spin supercurrent while their transverse charge supercurrent is zero. These features open an opportunity to design superconducting spintronics devices.

Title: Volcano-Like Ferroic Transitions Deviating from the Model of Landau Theory
Authors: Yuxuan Sheng, Menghao Wu
Abstract: We predict the existence of abnormal volcano-like temperature dependence of polarization or magnetization with maxima located at elevated temperature, distinct from classical model based on Landau theory. One case is ferroelectricity with long ion displacements and quantized polarizations that cannot be used for expansion in Landau model, and the switching pathway involves various metastable phases where the polar phase is higher both in energy and entropy compared with non-polar phase. Another case is compensated antiferromagnets with two opposite spin lattices of different spin exchange constants. Such difference can be utilized for a unique type of temperature differentiated multiferroicity, where large magnetizations can be reversed upon ferroelectric switching between two Curie temperature with alternating half of spins in paramagnetic state. We demonstrate these proposals by first-principles calculations on several paradigmatic systems, including magnetic bilayers intercalated by Ag ions or metal molecules.

Title: Revisiting the Influence of Sn in Cu-Al alloys: A Third Element Effect Enabling Stainless Steel Type Aqueous Passivation Behavior
Authors: Debashish Sur, Nathan C. Smith, Elaf A. Anber, Kaitlyn L. Anderson, Peter F. Connors, Daniel Foley, Mitra L. Taheri, Junsoo Han, Christopher M. Wolverton, John R. Scully
Abstract: The influence of Sn alloying additions on the aqueous passivation behavior of Cu-Al alloys was revisited and found to function as a new third element effect in acidified 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution. The role of each element during the process of aqueous passivation was investigated using electrochemical and surface-sensitive ex-situ and in-operando spectroscopic techniques. The connection between passivation and the atomic arrangements of atoms in the solid solution was supported by first principles based cluster expansion calculations and Monte Carlo simulations probing the chemical short-range order in the Cu-Al-Sn system. High purity Sn, like high purity Cu, did not passivate in the test environment, whereas high purity Al formed a passive film with a stable passive current density of 0.01 mA/cm^2. Cu-xAl-Sn solid solution alloys where x greater than 18 at.%, containing less than 3 at.% Sn additions exhibited lower corrosion rates than Cu-xAl alloys, brought by Al(III) and Sn(IV, II) unidentified complex oxides formation on the surface. A strong influence of Sn on Al(III) passivation was observed, i.e., strongly suggesting a third element effect type behavior. Possible governing processes explaining the stainless steel type corrosion behavior are discussed, providing insights for exploring novel synergies in the design of corrosion resistant alloys.

Abstract: We demonstrate all-optical generation and detection of high-frequency (up to ~30 GHz) surface acoustic waves (SAWs) in GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures with short-period Au gratings on top. We present a sensitive method of SAWs detection by means of a polarization-sensitive pump-probe technique that exploits the narrow exciton resonance in high-quality GaAs. The elastic strain of the SAW causes modulation of the exciton energy in the time domain. As a result, even a small deformation leads to a noticeable change in the dielectric function at the detection wavelength leading to an order of magnitude increase in the detection sensitivity as compared to detection apart from the resonance. A theoretical model is developed that considers two detection schemes: one accounting for probe light diffraction and one without.

Title: Effects of Small-Chain Superexchange Dynamics on Spin-Orbit Coupled Clock Spectroscopy
Authors: Mikhail Mamaev, Ana Maria Rey, William R. Milner
Abstract: Optical lattice clocks have set records in clock precision and accuracy. Continuing to advance their performance, via probing as many atoms for the longest interrogation time affordable, requires experimentally and theoretically studying a many-body lattice system. Motivated by recent experimental results on a Fermi-degenerate three-dimensional optical lattice clock, we present a theoretical overview of Ramsey and Rabi spectroscopy in one-dimensional chains. At realistic experimental temperatures and confinement conditions, atoms are spatially localized into small chains of $\approx 1-5$ atoms. We show that in the presence of spin-orbit coupling induced by the clock laser, the spectroscopy observables are modified by superexchange interactions within each chain, and depend strongly on the length of the chain. The thermal distribution of chain lengths thus plays a key role in the spectroscopy measurements. Our results offer insight into observable many-body effects in state-of-the-art lattice clocks and suggest new directions for optimizing clock performance.

Title: Effects of Epoxy Composition on the Thermal and Network Properties of Crosslinked Thermosets: A Molecular-Dynamics Study
Authors: Venkata Rama Manoj Pola, Alexey Lyulin
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the influence of resin composition on the thermal and structural properties of crosslinked epoxy networks using molecular-dynamics simulations. The systems studied are based on mixtures of diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA) and butylated epoxy resin (BER), cured with diethyltoluenediamine (DETDA). A multi-step crosslinking algorithm was used to generate highly crosslinked networks. We systematically explored how the addition of BER affects the network topology and thermophysical behavior of the resulting thermosets. Our results show that increasing BER content leads to a progressive loosening of the network, evidenced by longer inter-nitrogen path lengths and larger Voronoi atomic volumes. This structural loosening results in a higher coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and higher atomic mobility as well as a reduction in the glass-transition temperature. To quantify local steric and topological effects, we introduce a confinement index that captures atomic-level crowding and connectivity. The index shows a strong correlation with the observed trend in glass-transition temperature, suggesting its potential as a predictive descriptor for polymer network behavior. Our findings provide molecular-level insights into how epoxy resin composition modulates network structure and thermomechanical properties.

Title: Correlated electronic structure of high-temperature superconductor Ba$_2$CuO$_{3+δ}$
Authors: Jing-Xuan Wang, Rong-Qiang He, Zhong-Yi Lu
Abstract: Cuprate superconductors have attracted extensive attention due to high critical temperatures. Conventional cuprates typically contain perfect CuO$_2$ planes which are considered as a key factor to superconductivity since the superconductivity takes place in them. However, in Ba$_2$CuO$_{3+\delta}$ with $\delta=0.2$ and O-depleted CuO$_2$ planes, superconductivity still arises even with a transition temperature as high as 73 K. Using combined density functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT) calculations, we investigated the electronic correlation and electronic structure of Ba$_2$CuO$_{3.25}$ with alternating quasi-one-dimensional (1D) CuO planes and O-depleted CuO$_2$ planes. We find that although different from the usual cuprates, the Cu atoms are still dominated by a 3$d^9$ configuration and the system is of a new kind of correlated single-orbital physics. The quasi-1D CuO planes, composed of parallel Cu-O chains, are slightly hole-doped quasi-1D Mott insulator, while the O-depleted CuO$_2$ planes are more hole doped, with a 2D correlated electronic structure, and may host superconductivity.

Title: Timescales for stochastic barrier crossing: inferring the potential from nonequilibrium data
Authors: A. J. Archer, T. Ala-Nissila, T. J. W. Honour, S. P. Fitzgerald
Abstract: Kramers' rate theory forms a cornerstone for thermally activated barrier crossing. However, its reliance on equilibrium quantities excludes analysis of nonequilibrium dynamics at early times. Most works have thus focused on obtaining rates and transition time and path distributions in equilibrium. Instead, here we consider early-time nonequilibrium dynamics in a model system of a particle with overdamped dynamics hopping over the barrier in a double-well potential, using the Smoluchowski equation (SE) and stochastic path integral (SPI) mapping of the Langevin equation. We identify several key timescales relevant to nonequilibrium dynamics and quantify them using the SE and SPI approaches. The shortest timescale corresponds to equilibration in a well at time $t \ll \tau_{\rm B}$, where $\tau_{\rm B}$ is the Brownian diffusion time. The second important timescale is when an inflexion point appears in the effective potential constructed from the density at $t \lessapprox \tau_{\rm B}$. Shortly after, the existence of a second potential well can be inferred from sufficient sampling of the dynamics. Interestingly, this timescale decreases with increasing barrier height. We find significant deviations from the equilibrium limit unless $t \gg \tau_{\rm B}$. We further calculate \red{the} density current at the barrier for bistable and asymmetric potentials and find that it crosses over to that from equilibrium rate theory at a time that does not appear to depend on the barrier height. Our results have important implications for controlling activated processes at finite times and demonstrate the importance of reaching long enough times to faithfully construct potential landscapes from experimental or simulation data.

Title: Interplay of short-range bond order and A-type antiferromagnetic order in metallic triangular lattice GdZn$_3$P$_3$
Authors: Jiesen Guo, Fan Yang, Yuzhou He, Xinyang Liu, Zheng Deng, Qinghua Zhang, Xiancheng Wang, Xianlei Sheng, Wei Li, Changqing Jin, Kan Zhao
Abstract: We investigate a hexagonal ScAl$_3$C$_3$-type antiferromagnet GdZn$_3$P$_3$ single crystal. Compared with antiferromagnetic topological material EuM$_2$X$_2$ (M=Zn, Cd; X=P, As), the GdZn$_3$P$_3$ features an additional ZnP$_3$ trigonal planar units. Notably, single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that Zn and P atoms within trigonal planar layer exhibit significant anisotropic displacement parameters with a space group of P63/mmc. Meanwhile, scanning transmission electron microscopy experiment demonstrates the presence of interstitial P atoms above and below the ZnP honeycomb lattice, suggesting potential ZnP bond instability within the ZnP$_3$ trigonal layers. Concerning the triangular Gd$^{3+}$ layer, the magnetic susceptibility $\chi$$(T)$ and heat capacity measurements reveal long-range antiferromagnetic order at T$_N$ = 4.5 K. Below T$_N$, the in-plane $\chi$$(T)$ is nearly 4 times the $\chi$$(T)$ along $c$ axis, indicative of strong magnetic anisotropy. The Curie Weiss fitting to the low temperature $\chi$$(T)$ data reveals ferromagnetic interaction ($\theta$$_{CW}$ = 5.2 K) in ab-plane, and antiferromagnetic interaction ($\theta$$_{CW}$ = -1 K) along c axis, suggesting the ground state as an A-type antiferromagnetic order. Correspondingly, the density function theory calculation shows that GdZn$_3$P$_3$ is an indirect semiconductor with a band gap 0.27 eV, supported by the resistivity measurement on polycrystal sample. Interestingly, the GdZn$_3$P$_3$ single crystal exhibits metallic conductivity with an anomaly at T$_N$, likely associated with the observation of interstitial P atoms mentioned above. Therefore, our results establish GdZn$_3$P$_3$ system as a concrete example for investigating the coupling between charge carrier and triangular lattice magnetism in the two-dimensional lattice framework, on the background of short-range bond order.

Title: High temperature modulations, meso-scale interactions and hyperscaling breakdown in Ising models with frustration: some insights from thermodynamic geometry
Authors: Soumen Khatua, Riekshika Sanwari, Vikram Patil, Anurag Sahay
Abstract: In this work we revisit the Axial Third Nearest Neighbour Ising (A3NNI) chain and examine in detail some aspects of its phase behaviour ensuing from competing interactions and resulting frustration. We probe the phase behaviour with two complimentary tools: a microscopic two-point correlation function $\mathcal{C}(n)$ which we carefully construct after appropriate spin transformations, and a macroscopic, thermodynamic curvature $R$ which we obtain from the free entropy. We report novel observations of phenomena such as hyperscaling breakdown and intermediate-ranged modulations among others. The zero field thermodynamic curvature $R_0$ is shown to systematically sub-divide the ground state phases into regions of attractive or repulsive effective interactions of varying strength. Furthermore, $R_0$ brings forth the significance of some third order moments in describing the effects of frustration, including the multiphase lines. Combined use of both the probes in the short-ranged modulated order regime confirms and further clarifies the discussion in [1] regarding the appropriate measure of high temperature correlation length in this regime.

Title: Rethinking cryptophane A for methane gas sensing: cross sensitivity to N2 and CO2 at ambient conditions
Authors: Sebastián Alberti, Thierry Brotin, Jana Jágerská
Abstract: Since the affinity of Cryptophane-A for methane was first reported in 1993, cryptophane-doped polymer films have been extensively studied as enrichment cladding layers in plasmonic, fiber-optic, and integrated waveguide-based optical sensors. While the use of cryptophane-doped layers has improved methane sensitivity compared to undoped claddings, controversy has grown over the years regarding their claimed selectivity and practical applicability. Key questions remain unresolved, including the extent of true methane enrichment at room temperature, cross-sensitivity to other gases, and the proportion of active cryptophane molecules within the polymer matrix. In this work, we employ Raman spectroscopy to provide direct and unambiguous evidence that Cryptophane-A exhibits measurable affinity for major ambient gases other than methane at room temperature. Notably, both nitrogen and carbon dioxide are shown to enter the cryptophane cavity and compete with methane for binding sites. This study underscores the value of Raman spectroscopy as a benchmark technique for investigating gas capture within host molecules at ambient conditions. It offers deeper insight into the binding behavior of Cryptophane-A and enables quantification of its relative affinities to atmospheric gases, thereby revealing both the limitations and the potential of cryptophane for future sensing applications.

Title: Spectral Feature Extraction for Robust Network Intrusion Detection Using MFCCs
Authors: HyeYoung Lee, Muhammad Nadeem, Pavel Tsoi
Abstract: The rapid expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) networks has led to a surge in security vulnerabilities, emphasizing the critical need for robust anomaly detection and classification techniques. In this work, we propose a novel approach for identifying anomalies in IoT network traffic by leveraging the Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) and ResNet-18, a deep learning model known for its effectiveness in feature extraction and image-based tasks. Learnable MFCCs enable adaptive spectral feature representation, capturing the temporal patterns inherent in network traffic more effectively than traditional fixed MFCCs. We demonstrate that transforming raw signals into MFCCs maps the data into a higher-dimensional space, enhancing class separability and enabling more effective multiclass classification. Our approach combines the strengths of MFCCs with the robust feature extraction capabilities of ResNet-18, offering a powerful framework for anomaly detection. The proposed model is evaluated on three widely used IoT intrusion detection datasets: CICIoT2023, NSL-KDD, and IoTID20. The experimental results highlight the potential of integrating adaptive signal processing techniques with deep learning architectures to achieve robust and scalable anomaly detection in heterogeneous IoT network landscapes.

Title: Scaling Relations, Morphological Stability, and Asymptotic Freedom of Plasma-Surface Deposition Dynamics
Authors: Joel Saucedo, Uday Lamba, Hasitha Mahabaduge
Abstract: Connecting plasma processing parameters to the resultant film microstructure remains a fundamental challenge in materials synthesis, one that has largely confined process design to empirical approaches. To bridge this gap, we develop a predictive analysis of coupling by applying a renormalization group (RG) analysis to an effective Hamiltonian for the stochastic dynamics of the plasma-surface interface, derived systematically from microscopic principles. The central result from this formalism is the system's exhibition of asymptotic freedom; the effective dimensionless coupling, $g$, between the plasma and the growing surface is found to weaken systematically at macroscopic length scales, a finding that provides a rigorous justification for the success of continuum-level models in describing large-scale film evolution. The RG framework yields a non-perturbative scaling relation for the mean grain area, $\langle A \rangle \propto \exp(\kappa/g)$, where $g$ itself is defined by fundamental parameters such as ion flux ($\Phi$) and ion collision time ($\tau_{\text{ion}}$). This relation reveals the origin of widely-observed empirical power-law scaling, showing it to be an effective behavior limited to specific process regimes. Crucially, the model furnishes sharp, testable predictions, including the pressure-independence of grain size within collision-dominated plasmas and a parameter-free criterion, $\Lambda_c = 1/(n^2-1)$, for the onset of morphological instability and faceting based on crystal symmetry. This work establishes a quantitative, parameter-sparse engine for predicting and ultimately controlling microstructural outcomes in thin film synthesis.

Title: Stabilizer Rényi Entropy Encodes Fusion Rules of Topological Defects and Boundaries
Authors: Masahiro Hoshino, Yuto Ashida
Abstract: We demonstrate that the stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE), a computable measure of quantum magic, can serve as an information-theoretic probe for universal properties associated with conformal defects in one-dimensional quantum critical systems. Using boundary conformal field theory, we show that open boundaries manifest as a universal logarithmic correction to the SRE, whereas topological defects yield a universal size-independent term. When multiple defects are present, we find that the universal terms in the SRE faithfully reflect the defect-fusion rules that define noninvertible symmetry algebra. These analytical predictions are corroborated by numerical calculations of the Ising model, where boundaries and topological defects are described by Cardy states and Verlinde lines, respectively.

Title: Optimal Calibration of Qubit Detuning and Crosstalk
Authors: David Shnaiderov, Matan Ben Dov, Yoav Woldiger, Assaf Hamo, Eugene Demler, Emanuele G. Dalla Torre
Abstract: Characterizing and calibrating physical qubits is essential for maintaining the performance of quantum processors. A key challenge in this process is the presence of crosstalk that complicates the estimation of individual qubit detunings. In this work, we derive optimal strategies for estimating detuning and crosstalk parameters by optimizing Ramsey interference experiments using Fisher information and the Cramer-Rao bound. We compare several calibration protocols, including measurements of a single quadrature at multiple times and of two quadratures at a single time, for a fixed number of total measurements. Our results predict that the latter approach yields the highest precision and robustness in both cases of isolated and coupled qubits. We validate experimentally our approach using a single NV center as well as superconducting transmons. Our approach enables accurate parameter extraction with significantly fewer measurements, resulting in up to a 50\% reduction in calibration time while maintaining estimation accuracy.

Title: Entanglement and Purity in Open Systems: A Breakdown of the Lindblad Approach
Authors: Raoul Serao, Aniello Quaranta, Antonio Capolupo, Fabio Franchini, Salvatore Marco Giampaolo
Abstract: We examine the effectiveness of Lindblad master equation in capturing the short-time dynamics of entanglement and purity in open quantum systems. Focusing on two interacting two-level systems interacting with a larger environment, we compare the Lindbladian approach to a full microscopic treatment. While the latter shows entanglement growth and a quadratic decay of purity, the Lindbladian method predicts a linear purity decay and can entirely suppress entanglement when the dissipative coupling exceeds the interaction strength. Introducing a time-dependent Lindbladian improves some predictions but causes inconsistencies in other observables. Our results highlight the limitations of effective models and the need for caution when applying them to describe subtle quantum behaviors.

Title: Optimal quantum transport on a ring via locally monitored chiral quantum walks
Authors: Sara Finocchiaro, Giovanni Luilli, Giuliano Benenti, Matteo G. A. Paris, Luca Razzoli
Abstract: In purely coherent transport on finite networks, destructive interference can significantly suppress transfer probabilities, which can only reach high values through careful fine-tuning of the evolution time or tailored initial-state preparations. We address this issue by investigating excitation transfer on a ring, modeling it as a locally monitored continuous-time chiral quantum walk. Chirality, introduced through time-reversal symmetry breaking, imparts a directional bias to the coherent dynamics and can lift dark states. Local monitoring, implemented via stroboscopic projective measurements at the target site, provides a practical detection protocol without requiring fine-tuning of the evolution time. By analyzing the interplay between chirality and measurement frequency, we identify optimal conditions for maximizing the asymptotic detection probability. The optimization of this transfer protocol relies on the spectral properties of the Perron-Frobenius operator, which capture the asymptotic non-unitary dynamics, and on the analysis of dark states. Our approach offers a general framework for enhancing quantum transport in monitored systems.

Title: Unifying Chemical and Electrochemical Thermodynamics of Electrodes
Authors: Archie Mingze Yao, Amal Sebastian, Venkatasubramaian Viswanathan
Abstract: Batteries are critical for electrified transportation and aviation, yet thermodynamic understanding of electrode materials remains lacking, as indicated by the often-seen violation of the second law of thermodynamics of open-circuit voltage (OCV) models. On the other hand, thermodynamic modeling rarely utilizes electrochemical data such as OCV, entropic heat (dOCV/dT), which contains rich thermodynamic information. This work introduces a framework of thermodynamic modeling of materials for electrochemical energy storage, using differentiable programming and gradient-based optimization of thermodynamic parameters. Using a modified Debye model that accounts for the phonon density of states, the thermodynamics of pure substances is modeled from experimental measurements of specific heat ($c_p$) as well as the phonon density of states $g(\omega)$. Thermodynamics of mixing is modeled with measured entropic heat and OCV data. We demonstrate the differentiable thermodynamic modeling framework with forward and inverse problems. In the forward problem, i.e. determining phase diagram of graphite anode given thermochemical and electrochemical data, we show that in addition to accurate reproduction of phase diagram of LixC6, the fitted temperature-dependent OCV of graphite reaches 3.8 mV mean absolute error (MAE) for test set data measured at 10$^\circ$C, compared with 2.9-3.6 mV MAE for training set data measured at 25$^\circ$C - 57$^\circ$C. In the inverse problem, i.e. determining OCV of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cathode from phase diagram constrained by thermochemical and electrochemical data, we demonstrate accurate reproduction of LFP OCV as well as phase diagram. This framework offers a unified treatment of chemical and electrochemical thermodynamic data for electrode materials.

Title: Magic transition in monitored free fermion dynamics
Authors: Cheng Wang, Zhi-Cheng Yang, Tianci Zhou, Xiao Chen
Abstract: We investigate magic and its connection to entanglement in 1+1 dimensional random free fermion circuits, with a focus on hybrid free fermion dynamics that can exhibit an entanglement phase transition. To quantify magic, we use the Stabilizer Rényi Entropy (SRE), which we compute numerically via a perfect sampling algorithm. We show that although the SRE remains extensive as the system transitions from a critical phase to an area-law (disentangled) phase, the structure of magic itself undergoes a delocalization phase transition. This transition is characterized using the bipartite stabilizer mutual information, which exhibits the same scaling behavior as entanglement entropy: logarithmic scaling in the critical phase and a finite constant in the area-law phase. Additionally, we explore the dynamics of SRE. While the total SRE becomes extensive in $O(1)$ time, we find that in the critical phase, the relaxation time to the steady-state value is parameterically longer than that in generic random circuits. The relaxation follows a universal form, with a relaxation time that grows linearly with the system size, providing further evidence for the critical nature of the phase.

Title: Disordered pinning models with contact number constraint
Authors: Giambattista Giacomin, Marco Zamparo
Abstract: Disordered pinning models are statistical mechanics models built on discrete renewal processes: renewal epochs in this context are called \emph{contacts}. It is well known that pinning models can undergo a localization/delocalization phase transition: in the localized phase the typical density of contacts is positive and the largest gap between contacts is at most of the order of the logarithm of the size $n$ of the system, whereas the system is void of contacts in the delocalized phase. When disorder is absent and the phase transition is discontinuous, conditioning the contact density to be positive but smaller than the minimum typical density in the localized phase has the effect of forcing to create one, and only one, macroscopic gap between two contacts, while the rest of the configuration keeps the characteristics of a localized state. However it is known that, in the presence of (bounded) disorder, this \emph{big jump phenomenon} is no longer observed, in the sense that the largest gap in the conditioned system is $o(n)$. Under minimal integrability conditions on the disorder we show that the conditioned system is localized in a very strong sense, in particular the largest gap is $O(\log n)$. The proof is achieved by exploiting the improved understanding of the localized phase of disordered pinning models developed in [34] and by establishing some refined estimates, in particular a quenched Local Central Limit Theorem. We also present an analysis of the effect of disorder on the large deviation rate function of the contact density and, as an important ingredient for the generality of our results, we establish a smoothing inequality for pinning models under minimal integrability conditions, thus generalizing [11,32].

Title: Generation of a scalar vortex in a rotational frame
Authors: M. Bordag, D. N. Voskresensky
Abstract: We consider generation from the vacuum of a scalar charged field in a rigidly rotating frame. Adding an external magnetic field opens the way to Bose condensation of the field. This phenomenon has been studied for external uniform magnetic field occupying the whole volume of the uniformly rotating cylindrical system of finite radius $R$ with a Dirichlet boundary condition imposed on it. Besides continuing this study, we consider the field formed by a flux tube of small radius. We find numerical solutions of the Ginzburg-Pitaevskii equation for the charged scalar field, the critical rotation frequencies, the mean radii and the condensate energies, and compare them with those found in a linearization scheme and with approximate analytical solutions. We show that for the same input parameters the energy of the condensate in the case of the flux tube is lower than in the case of uniform magnetic field in the whole cylinder.

Title: Higher spin Richardson-Gaudin model with time-dependent coupling: Exact dynamics
Authors: Suvendu Barik, Lieuwe Bakker, Vladimir Gritsev, Jiří Minář, Emil A. Yuzbashyan
Abstract: We determine the exact asymptotic many-body wavefunction of a spin-$s$ Richardson-Gaudin model with a coupling inversely proportional to time, for time evolution starting from the ground state at $t = 0^+$ and for arbitrary $s$. Contrary to common belief, the resulting wavefunction cannot be derived from the spin-$1/2$ case by merging spins, but instead requires independent treatment for each spin size. The steady state is non-thermal and, in contrast to the spin-$1/2$ case, does not conform to a natural Generalized Gibbs Ensemble. We show that mean-field theory is exact for any product of a finite number of spin operators on different sites. We discuss how these findings can be probed in cavity QED and trapped ion experiments.

Title: Hawking time crystal
Authors: Juan Ramón Muñoz de Nova, Fernando Sols
Abstract: We report the numerical observation of a time crystal in a quantum black-hole laser (BHL), where the genuine spontaneous character of the symmetry breaking stems from the self-amplification of spontaneous Hawking radiation. The resulting Hawking time crystal (HTC) is characterized by the periodic dependence of the out-of-time density-density correlation function, while equal-time correlations are time-independent because they embody averages over different realizations with a random oscillation phase. The HTC can be regarded as a nonlinear periodic version of the Andreev-Hawking effect, signaled by anticorrelation bands resulting from the spontaneous, quantum emission of pairs of dispersive waves and solitons into the upstream and downstream regions.

Title: Entanglement production in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Model and its variants
Authors: Tanay Pathak, Masaki Tezuka
Abstract: Understanding how quantum chaotic systems generate entanglement can provide insight into their microscopic chaotic dynamics and can help distinguish between different classes of chaotic behavior. Using von Neumann entanglement entropy, we study a nonentangled state evolved under three variants of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model with a finite number of Majorana fermions $N$. All the variants exhibit linear entanglement growth at early times, which at late times saturates to a universal value consistent with random matrix theory (RMT), but their growth rates differ. We interpret this as a large-$N$ effect, arising from the enhanced non-locality of fermionic operators in SYK and binary SYK, absent in spin operators of the spin-SYK model. Numerically, we find that these differences emerge gradually with increasing $N$. Although all variants are quantum chaotic, their entanglement dynamics reflect varying degrees of chaos and indicate that the entanglement production rate serves as a fine-grained probe of chaos beyond conventional measures. To probe its effect on thermalization properties of these models, we study the two-point autocorrelation function, finding no differences between the SYK variants, but deviations from RMT predictions for $N \geq 24$, particularly near the crossover from exponential decay to saturation regime.

Title: Disentangling Boltzmann brains, the time-asymmetry of memory, the H theorem, and the second law
Authors: David Wolpert, Carlo Rovelli, Jordan Scharnhorst
Abstract: Are you, with your perceptions, memories and observational data, a Boltzmann brain, i.e., a statistical fluctuation out of the thermal equilibrium of the universe? Arguments are given in the literature for and against taking this hypothesis seriously. Complicating these analyses have been the many subtle - and very often implicit - entanglements between related arguments that have been given for the past hypothesis, the second law, and even Bayesian inference of the reliability of experimental data. These entanglements can easily lead to circular reasoning. To help disentangle those arguments, since almost all of them involve Boltzmann's H theorem, we begin by formalizing the H theorem as a time-symmetric, time-translation invariant Markov process over the entropy values of the universe. Crucially, this process does not specify the time(s) on which we should condition it in order to infer the stochastic dynamics of our universe's entropy. Any such choice of conditioning events must be introduced as an independent assumption. This observation allows us to disentangle the standard Boltzmann brain hypothesis, its "1000CE" variant, the past hypothesis, the second law, and the reliability of our experimental data, all in a fully formal manner. In particular, we show that they all adopt the H theorem's stipulation that the universe's entropy evolves as a Markov processes, and all make an arbitrary assumption that the process should be conditioned on a single moment in time. Their only difference is what single time to condition on. In this aspect, the Boltzmann brain hypothesis and the second law are equally legitimate (or not).

Title: Temporal Brewster anomaly and collimated wave steering in Dirac materials
Authors: Seulong Kim, Kihong Kim
Abstract: Temporal disorder-random temporal fluctuations of material parameters-has recently emerged as an effective tool for controlling wave propagation, analogous to Anderson localization in spatially disordered systems. Here, we theoretically introduce and analyze the temporal Brewster anomaly in pseudospin-1/2 Dirac systems, demonstrating that Dirac waves remain delocalized along a vector potential with fixed direction despite random temporal variations in its magnitude. In contrast, waves propagating at any off-axis angle exhibit pronounced spatial localization and diffusive behavior. This directional selectivity arises from temporal impedance matching, previously identified as the mechanism suppressing temporal reflection along the vector potential axis. By analyzing temporal reflectance, wave group velocity, and pulse propagation, we establish that these systems function as dynamic directional filters, achieving collimated wave steering purely through temporal modulation. In Dirac materials, external electric fields or mechanical strain can dynamically control the orientation and strength of the vector potential modulation, enabling precise, real-time tuning of directional wave transmission. The temporal Brewster anomaly thus offers a robust and versatile approach for adaptive wave steering, promising significant technological applications in electronic and photonic devices.

Title: Statistical regimes of electromagnetic wave propagation in randomly time-varying media
Authors: Seulong Kim, Kihong Kim
Abstract: Wave propagation in time-varying media enables unique control of energy transport by breaking energy conservation through temporal modulation. Among the resulting phenomena, temporal disorder-random fluctuations in material parameters-can suppress propagation and induce localization, analogous to Anderson localization. However, the statistical nature of this process remains incompletely understood. We present a comprehensive analytical and numerical study of electromagnetic waves in spatially uniform media with randomly time-varying permittivity. Using the invariant imbedding method, we derive exact moment equations and identify three distinct statistical regimes for initially unidirectional input: gamma-distributed energy at early times, exponential behavior at intermediate times, and a quasi-log-normal distribution at long times. In contrast, symmetric bidirectional input yields true log-normal statistics across all time scales. These findings are validated by extensive calculations using two complementary disorder models-delta-correlated Gaussian noise and piecewise-constant fluctuations-demonstrating that the observed statistics are robust and governed by input symmetry and temporal dynamics. Momentum conservation further constrains long-term behavior, linking initial conditions to energy growth. Our results establish a unified framework for understanding statistical wave dynamics in time-modulated systems and offer guiding principles for the design of dynamically tunable photonic and electromagnetic devices.

Title: Topological edge states and disorder robustness in one-dimensional off-diagonal mosaic lattices
Authors: Ba Phi Nguyen, Kihong Kim
Abstract: We investigate topological edge states in one-dimensional off-diagonal mosaic lattices, where nearest-neighbor hopping amplitudes are modulated periodically with period $\kappa>1$. Analytically, we demonstrate that discrete edge states emerge at energy levels $E=\epsilon+2t\cos(\pi i/\kappa)$ ($i=1,\cdots,\kappa-1$), extending the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model to multi-band systems. Numerical simulations reveal that these edge states exhibit robust localization and characteristic nodal structures, with their properties strongly dependent on the edge configurations of long and short bonds. We further examine their stability under off-diagonal disorder, where the hopping amplitudes $\beta$ fluctuate randomly at intervals of $\kappa$. Using the inverse participation ratio as a localization measure, we show that these topological edge states remain robust over a broad range of disorder strengths. In contrast, additional $\beta$-dependent edge states (emerging for $\kappa \ge 4$) are fragile and disappear under strong disorder. These findings highlight a rich interplay between topology, periodic modulation, and disorder, offering insights for engineering multi-gap topological phases and their realization in synthetic quantum and photonic systems.

Title: Fokker-Planck equation for the Brownian motion in the post-Newtonian approximation
Authors: Gilberto M. Kremer
Abstract: A mixture of light-gas particles and Brownian heavy particles is analyzed within the framework of a post-Newtonian Boltzmann equation to determine the Fokker-Planck equation for the Brownian motion. For each species, the equilibrium distribution function refers to the corresponding post-Newtonian Maxwell-Jüttner distribution function. The expressions for the friction viscous coefficient in the first and second post-Newtonian approximations are determined, and we show their dependence on the corresponding gravitational potentials. A linear stability analysis in the Newtonian and post-Newtonian Fokker-Planck equations for the Brownian motion is developed, where the perturbations are assumed to be plane harmonic waves of small amplitudes. From a dispersion relation it follows that: (i) for perturbation wavelengths smaller than the Jeans wavelength two propagating modes -- corresponding to harmonic waves in opposite directions -- and one mode that does not propagate show up; (ii) for perturbation wavelengths bigger than the Jeans wavelength the time evolution of the perturbation corresponds to a growth or a decay and the one which grows refers to the instability.

Title: From Bound States to Quantum Spin Models: Chiral Coherent Dynamics in Topological Photonic Rings
Authors: Fatemeh Davoodi
Abstract: Topological photonic systems offer a robust platform for guiding light in the presence of disorder, but their interplay with quantum emitters remains a frontier for realizing strongly correlated quantum states. Here, we explore a ring-shaped Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) photonic lattice interfaced with multiple quantum emitters to control topologically protected chiral quantum dynamics. Using a full microscopic model that includes cascaded Lindblad dynamics and chiral emitter-bath couplings, we reveal how the topology of the bath mediates nonreciprocal, long-range interactions between emitters. These interactions lead to rich manybody spin phenomena, including robust coherence, directional energy transfer, and emergent double Néel ordering, captured by an effective spin Hamiltonian derived from the system topology. We show that topological bound states enable unidirectional emission, protect coherence against dissipation, and imprint nontrivial entanglement and mutual information patterns among the emitters. In particular, we showed that under circularly polarized excitation, the emitters not only inherit spin angular momentum from the field but also serve as transducers that coherently launch the spin-orbit-coupled topological photonic modes into the far field. Our results establish a direct bridge between topological photonic baths and emergent quantum magnetism, positioning this architecture as a promising testbed for studying chiral quantum optics, topologically protected entangled states, and long-range quantum coherence.

Title: Mesoscopic Fluctuations and Multifractality at and across Measurement-Induced Phase Transition
Authors: Igor Poboiko, Igor V. Gornyi, Alexander D. Mirlin
Abstract: We explore statistical fluctuations over the ensemble of quantum trajectories in a model of two-dimensional free fermions subject to projective monitoring of local charge across the measurement-induced phase transition. Our observables are the particle-number covariance between spatially separated regions, $G_{AB}$, and the two-point density correlation function, $\mathcal{C}(r)$. Our results exhibit a remarkable analogy to Anderson localization, with $G_{AB}$ corresponding to two-terminal conductance and $\mathcal{C}(r)$ to two-point conductance, albeit with different replica limit and unconventional symmetry class, geometry, and boundary conditions. In the delocalized phase, $G_{AB}$ exhibits ``universal'', nearly Gaussian, fluctuations with variance of order unity. In the localized phase, we find a broad distribution of $G_{AB}$ with $\overline{-\ln G_{AB}} \sim L $ (where $L$ is the system size) and the variance $\mathrm{var}(\ln G_{AB}) \sim L^\mu$, and similarly for $\mathcal{C}(r)$, with $\mu \approx 0.5$. At the transition point, the distribution function of $G_{AB}$ becomes scale-invariant and $\mathcal{C}(r)$ exhibits multifractal statistics, $\overline{\mathcal{C}^{q}(r)}\sim r^{-q(d+1) - \Delta_{q}}$. We characterize the spectrum of multifractal dimensions $\Delta_q$. Our findings lay the groundwork for mesoscopic theory of monitored systems, paving the way for various extensions.

Title: Solving Distance-Based Optimization Problems Using Optical Hardware
Authors: Guangyao Li, Richard Zhipeng Wang, Natalia G. Berloff
Abstract: We present a practical approach to solving distance-based optimization problems using optical computing hardware. The objective is to minimize an energy function defined as the weighted sum of squared differences between measured distances and the squared Euclidean distances of point coordinates. By representing coordinates as complex numbers, we map the optimization problem onto optical fields, enabling its solution through either the canonical transformation (CT) method or the gain-based bifurcation (GBB) method. To further enhance the performance of the CT method, we introduce two techniques: asynchronous update and steepened gradient. Both the CT and GBB methods can effectively solve the distance-based problem and are adaptable to various optical hardware platforms. Our optical implementation is inspired by recent progress in analog optical computing for combinatorial optimization, highlighting its promise for efficient and scalable problem-solving in high-dimensional settings.

Title: Subharmonic Shapiro steps in depinning dynamics of a 2D solid dusty plasma modulated by 1D nonlinear deformed periodic substrates
Authors: Zhaoye Wang, Nichen Yu, Ao xu, Chen Liang, C. Reichhardt, C.J.O. Reichhardt, Yan Feng
Abstract: Langevin dynamical simulations are performed to investigate the depinning dynamics of a two-dimensional solid dusty plasma, which is modulated by one-dimensional nonlinear deformed periodic substrates, and also driven by the combination of the DC and AC forces. As the DC driving force increases gradually, pronounced subharmonic and harmonic Shapiro steps are discovered under the combined modulation of the deformed substrate and the external AC drive. These observed subharmonic and harmonic Shapiro steps are attributed to the dynamic mode locking. The data analysis results indicate that the nonlinear deformed substrate strongly influences these subharmonic Shapiro steps, which can be accurately diagnosed using the fraction of sixfold coordinated particles. Furthermore, the diagnostic of the kinetic temperature clearly indicates the difference between harmonic and subharmonic Shapiro steps, i.e., the particle motion is slightly less synchronized at subharmonic Shapiro steps, caused by the unstable locations of the deformed substrate.

Title: Metrology using atoms in an array of double-well potentials
Authors: Danish Ali Hamza, Jan Chwedeńczuk
Abstract: Quantum effects, such as entanglement, Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering, and Bell correlations, can enhance metrological sensitivity beyond the standard quantum limit. These correlations are typically generated through interactions between atoms or molecules, or during the passage of a laser pulse through a birefringent crystal. Here, we consider an alternative method of generating scalable, many-body entangled states, and demonstrate their usability for quantum-enhanced metrology. Our setup is a one-dimensional (1D) array of double-well potentials holding independent and uncorrelated Bose-Einstein condensates. The beam-splitting transformation mixes the signal between adjacent wells and yields a strongly entangled state through a many-body equivalent of the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect. We demonstrate this entanglement can improve the sensitivity of quantum sensors. In our analysis, we account for the effects of atomic fluctuations and identify the optimal measurement that saturates the quantum Cramer-Rao bound.

Title: Simulating and Sampling from Quantum Circuits with 2D Tensor Networks
Authors: Manuel S. Rudolph, Joseph Tindall
Abstract: Classical simulations of quantum circuits play a vital role in the development of quantum computers and for taking the temperature of the field. Here, we classically simulate various physically-motivated circuits using 2D tensor network ansätze for the many-body wavefunction which match the geometry of the underlying quantum processor. We then employ a generalized version of the boundary Matrix Product State contraction algorithm to controllably generate samples from the resultant tensor network states. Our approach allows us to systematically converge both the quality of the final state and the samples drawn from it to the true distribution defined by the circuit. With these methods, we simulate the largest local unitary Jastrow ansatz circuit taken from recent IBM experiments to numerical precision. We also study a domain-wall quench in a two-dimensional discrete-time Heisenberg model on large heavy-hex and rotated square lattices, which reflect IBM's and Google's latest quantum processors respectively. We observe a rapid buildup of complex loop correlations on the Google Willow geometry which significantly impact the local properties of the system. Meanwhile, we find loop correlations build up extremely slowly on heavy-hex processors and have almost negligible impact on the local properties of the system, even at large circuit depths. Our results underscore the role the geometry of the quantum processor plays in classical simulability.

Title: A magneto-optical trap of silver and potassium atoms
Authors: Michael Vayninger, Angela Xiang, Nachiket D. Bhanushali, Xiaoyu Chen, Mohit Verma, Shaozhen Yang, Rohan T. Kapur, David DeMille, Zoe Z. Yan
Abstract: We demonstrate a dual magneto-optical trap of $^{109}$Ag and $^{39}$K. For silver, a decreasing-field Zeeman slower loads a MOT of $1.5{\times}10^8$ atoms at a temperature of 0.74(5) mK, with laser cooling occurring primarily on the $D_2$ line of $4d^{10}5s\; {}^2S_{1/2}\rightarrow 5p\; {}^2P_{3/2}$ at 328 nm. We create a novel Ag "dark spot MOT," where shelving the atoms in a dark state enhances the captured atom number by a factor of two and the lifetime by a factor of four. For potassium, we obtain $2{\times}10^8$ trapped atoms, and further cooling on the $D_1$ transition via grey molasses results in a cloud of $1.2{\times} 10^8$ atoms at 7(1) $\mu$K. We observe evidence of photoionization loss of the K MOT in the presence of Ag laser-cooling light, with implications for optimal dual species loading strategies. Our results on Ag point to simple and general laser cooling strategies for other coinage metals (Au, Cu). Furthermore, this work lays the foundation for the production of alkali-coinage metal degenerate quantum mixtures and highly polar molecules.

Title: The stability of long-range order in disordered systems: A generalized Ding-Zhuang argument
Authors: Yejia Chen, Jianwen Zhou, Ruifeng Liu, Hai-Jun Zhou
Abstract: The stability of long-range order against quenched disorder is a central problem in statistical mechanics. This paper develops a generalized framework extending the Ding-Zhuang method and integrated with the Pirogov-Sinai framework, establishing a systematic scheme for studying phase transitions of long-range order in disordered systems. We axiomatize the Ding-Zhuang approach into a theoretical framework consisting of the Peierls condition and a local symmetry condition. For systems in dimensions $d \geq 3$ satisfying these conditions, we prove the persistence of long-range order at low temperatures and under weak disorder, with multiple coexisting distinct Gibbs states. The framework's versatility is demonstrated for diverse models, providing a systematic extension of Peierls methods to disordered systems.

Title: Spin Relaxation Mechanisms and Nuclear Spin Entanglement of the V$_B^{-1}$ Center in hBN
Authors: Chanaprom Cholsuk, Tobias Vogl, Viktor Ivády
Abstract: The negatively charged boron vacancy $V_B^-$ defect in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has recently emerged as a promising spin qubit for sensing due to its high-temperature spin control and versatile integration into van der Waals structures. While extensive experiments have explored their coherence properties, much less is known about the spin relaxation time $T_1$ and its control-parameter dependence. In this work, we develop a parameter-free spin dynamics model based on the cluster-expansion technique to investigate $T_1$ relaxation mechanisms at low temperature. Our results reveal that the $V_B^-$ center constitutes a strongly coupled electron spin-nuclear spin core, which necessitates the inclusion of the coherent dynamics and derived memory effects of the three nearest-neighbor nitrogen nuclear spins. Using this framework, this work closely reproduces the experimentally observed $T_1$ time at $B = 90\,\mathrm{G}$ and further predicts the $T_1$ dependence on external magnetic field in the $0 \le B \le 2000\,\mathrm{G}$ interval, when the spin relaxation is predominantly driven by electron-nuclear and nuclear-nuclear flip-flop processes mediated by hyperfine and dipolar interactions. This study establishes a reliable and scalable approach for describing $T_1$ relaxation in $V_B^-$ centers and offers microscopic insights to support future developments in nuclear-spin-based quantum technologies.

Title: Opinion dynamics: Statistical physics and beyond
Authors: Michele Starnini, Fabian Baumann, Tobias Galla, David Garcia, Gerardo Iñiguez, Márton Karsai, Jan Lorenz, Katarzyna Sznajd-Weron
Abstract: Opinion dynamics, the study of how individual beliefs and collective public opinion evolve, is a fertile domain for applying statistical physics to complex social phenomena. Like physical systems, societies exhibit macroscopic regularities from localized interactions, leading to outcomes such as consensus or fragmentation. This field has grown significantly, attracting interdisciplinary methods and driven by a surge in large-scale behavioral data. This review covers its rapid progress, bridging the literature dispersion. We begin with essential concepts and definitions, encompassing the nature of opinions, microscopic and macroscopic dynamics. This foundation leads to an overview of empirical research, from lab experiments to large-scale data analysis, which informs and validates models of opinion dynamics. We then present individual-based models, categorized by their macroscopic phenomena (e.g., consensus, polarization, echo chambers) and microscopic mechanisms (e.g., homophily, assimilation). We also review social contagion phenomena, highlighting their connection to opinion dynamics. Furthermore, the review covers common analytical and computational tools, including stochastic processes, treatments, simulations, and optimization. Finally, we explore emerging frontiers, such as connecting empirical data to models and using AI agents as testbeds for novel social phenomena. By systematizing terminology and emphasizing analogies with traditional physics, this review aims to consolidate knowledge, provide a robust theoretical foundation, and shape future research in opinion dynamics.

Abstract: Fascinating in art and science, the ability to float is also captivating and relevant in practical applications, such as Penning and ion traps that are fundamental to quantum computing. In this work, we first reproduce the classic water bridge by glycerol and, as it breaks down due to thermal agitation, observe that a lump of glycerol with mass~2.5 g can float and exhibit near-periodic oscillations. Through experiments, finite element analysis, and simulations, we discover that the stability of the floating droplet is made possible by the interaction between three mechanisms: Deformation, Plasma, and Kelvin force. Note that GC falls in the class of adaptive materials that can change their properties or behavior in response to varying environmental conditions, i.e., stimuli-responsive. Furthermore, the stimuli, modified by the deformation of GC, collaborate with it to create this unique simple, yet stable, floating this http URL up by simulations, this process, operated by only a single pair of electrodes, holds the potential to develop a simple yet powerful railgun.

Abstract: Kagome lattices have emerged as an ideal platform for exploring exotic quantum phenomena in materials. Here, we report the discovery of Ti-based kagome metal YbTi3Bi4 which we characterize using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and magneto-transport, in combination with density functional theory calculations. Our ARPES results reveal the complex fermiology of YbTi3Bi4 and provide spectroscopic evidence of four flat bands. Our measurements also show the presence of multiple van Hove singularities originating from Ti 3d orbitals and a linearly-dispersing gapped Dirac-like bulk state at the K point in accord with our theoretical calculations. Our study establishes YbTi3Bi4 as a platform for exploring exotic phases in the wider LnTi3Bi4 (Ln= lanthanide) family of materials.

Title: Anderson Delocalization in Strongly-Coupled Disordered Non-Hermitian Chains
Authors: Wei-Wu Jin, Jin Liu, Xin Wang, Yu-Ran Zhang, Xueqin Huang, Xiaomin Wei, Wenbo Ju, Zhongmin Yang, Tao Liu, Franco Nori
Abstract: Disorder and non-Hermitian effects together can upend how waves localize. In a 1D disordered chain, the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) can induce Anderson delocalization, defying the usual rule that disorder in low dimensions always localizes states. While weak disorder leaves the NHSE intact, strong disorder restores Anderson localization. Here, we study a surprising twist: coupling a strongly disordered Hatano-Nelson chain to a disordered Hermitian chain with their disorder anti-symmetrically correlated. Strikingly, once the inter-chain coupling exceeds a threshold, the system undergoes Anderson delocalization irrespective of disorder strength, reinstating the NHSE with no Hermitian counterpart. This transition arises from the interplay of non-reciprocal hopping, inter-chain coupling, and engineered disorder correlations, and is captured by a real-space winding number. To confirm this, we build an electrical-circuit analog and directly observe the re-emergent NHSE via voltage measurements. Our work uncovers unexplored and experimentally accessible physics at the crossroads of non-Hermiticity and disorder.

Title: Hund's Rule, Interorbital Hybridization, and High-$T_c$ Superconductivity in the Bilayer Nickelate
Authors: Xing-Zhou Qu, Dai-Wei Qu, Xin-Wei Yi, Wei Li, Gang Su
Abstract: Understanding the pairing mechanism in bilayer nickelate superconductors constitutes a fascinating quest. Here we investigate the intriguing interplay between Hund's rule coupling and interorbital hybridization in a two-orbital model for bilayer nickelates, using a comprehensive tensor network approach: density matrix renormalization group for finite-size systems, infinite projected entangled-pair states in the thermodynamic limit, and thermal tensor networks for finite-temperature properties. We explain the pressure-dependent high-$T_c$ superconductivity observed in experiment, by identifying three distinct superconductive (SC) regimes: hybridization dominant, Hund's rule dominant, and the hybrid-Hund synergistic SC regimes. In these SC regimes, both $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals exhibit algebraic pairing correlations with similar Luttinger parameters $K_{\mathrm{SC}}$. However, the former exhibits a much stronger amplitude than the latter, with a distinctly higher SC characteristic temperature $T_c^*$, below which the pairing susceptibility diverges as $\chi_{\mathrm{SC}}(T) \sim 1/T^{2-K_{\mathrm{SC}}}$. With realistic model parameters, we find the pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ falls into the Hund's rule dominated SC regime. As hybridization further enhances with pressure, it leads to significant interorbital frustration and in turn suppresses the SC correlations, explaining the rise and fall of high-$T_c$ superconductivity under high pressure. Our results offer a comprehensive understanding of the interlayer pairing in superconducting La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.

Title: Dynamical Approach to Realize Room-Temperature Superconductivity in LaH$_{10}$
Authors: Chendi Xie, Adam D. Smith, Haoran Yan, Wei-Chih Chen, Yao Wang
Abstract: Metallic hydrogen and hydride materials stand as promising avenues to achieve room-temperature superconductivity. Characterized by their high phonon frequencies and moderate coupling strengths, several high-pressure hydrides were theoretically predicted to exhibit transition temperatures ($T_c$) exceeding 250\,K, a claim further substantiated by experimental evidence. In an effort to push $T_c$ beyond room temperature, we introduce a dynamical method that involves stimulating hydrides with mid-infrared lasers. Employing Floquet first-principles simulations, we observe that in a nonequilibrium state induced by light, both the electronic density of states and the coupling to high-energy phonons see notable enhancements. These simultaneous improvements collectively result in an estimated 20\%-30\% rise in $T_c$ in practical pump conditions. Our theoretical investigation, therefore, offers a novel strategy to potentially raise the $T_c$ of hydrides above room temperature.

Title: Identifying the Origin of Thermal Modulation of Exchange Bias in MnPS3/Fe3GeTe2 van der Waals Heterostructures

Abstract: The exchange bias phenomenon, inherent in exchange-coupled ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic systems, has intrigued researchers for decades. Van der Waals materials, with their layered structure, provide an optimal platform for probing such physical phenomena. However, achieving a facile and effective means to manipulate exchange bias in van der Waals heterostructures remains challenging. In this study, we investigate the origin of exchange bias in MnPS3/Fe3GeTe2 van der Waals heterostructures. Our work demonstrates a method to modulate unidirectional exchange anisotropy, achieving an unprecedented nearly 1000% variation through simple thermal cycling. Despite the compensated interfacial spin configuration of MnPS3, magneto-transport measurements reveal a huge 170 mT exchange bias at 5 K, one of the largest observed in van der Waals antiferromagnet-ferromagnet interfaces. This substantial magnitude of the exchange bias is linked to an anomalous weak ferromagnetic ordering in MnPS3 below 40 K. On the other hand, the tunability of exchange bias during thermal cycling is ascribed to the modified arrangement of interfacial atoms and changes in the vdW gap during field cooling. Our findings highlight a robust and easily adjustable exchange bias in van der Waals antiferromagnetic/ferromagnetic heterostructures, presenting a straightforward approach to enhance other interface-related spintronic phenomena for practical applications. A detailed study of the interface reveals migration of atoms between the layers, leading to the formation of amorphous region on either side of the van der Waals gap, underscoring the importance of precise characterization of interfaces in van der Waals heterostructures, which are often presumed to have pristine interfaces.

Title: Charge density wave with suppressed long-range structural modulation in canted antiferromagnetic kagome FeGe

Abstract: Kagome lattice can host abundant exotic quantum states such as superconductivity and charge density wave (CDW). Recently, successive orders of A-type antiferromagnetism (AFM), CDW and canted AFM have been manifested upon cooling in kagome FeGe. However, the mechanism of CDW and interaction with magnetism remains unclear. Here we investigate the evolution of CDW with temperature across the canted AFM by single-crystal x-ray diffraction, scanning tunneling microscope (STM) and resonant elastic x-ray scattering (REXS). Interestingly, CDW-induced superlattice reflections become weak after the canted AFM, although long-range CDW order is still detectable by STM and REXS. We uncover a novel long-range CDW order with suppressed structural modulation, likely due to the competition for the underlying crystal structure between CDW and canted AFM. Additionally, occupational modulations of Ge1 in the kagome plane and displacive modulations of all atoms were extracted. The results confirm Ge dimerization along the c axis and suggest a dynamic transformation between different CDW domains.

Title: Electrically tunable and enhanced nonlinearity of moiré exciton-polaritons in transition metal dichalcogenide bilayers
Authors: Kok Wee Song, Oleksandr Kyriienko
Abstract: We develop a microscopic theory for nonlinear optical response of moiré exciton-polaritons in bilayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Our theory allows to study the tunnel-coupled intralayer and interlayer excitonic modes for a wide range of twist angles ($\theta$), external electric field, and light-matter coupling, providing insights into the hybridization regime inaccessible before. Specifically, we account for the Umklapp scattering processes of two exciton-polaritons responsible for enhanced nonlinearity, and show that it is crucial for describing interactions at strong hybridization. We reveal a regime of attractive nonlinearity for moiré polaritons, stemming from the anisotropic Coulomb interactions, which can explain some of experimental features of optical response in TMD bilayers. Furthermore, within our theory we demonstrate that the attractive nonlinearity can be tuned into repulsive by applying an external electric field. Our findings show that nonlinear moiré polaritons offer a controllable platform nonlinear polaritonic devices.

Title: Stability of persistent currents in superfluid fermionic rings
Authors: Klejdja Xhani, Andrea Barresi, Marek Tylutki, Gabriel Wlazłowski, Piotr Magierski
Abstract: We investigate the stability of persistent currents in superfluid fermionic gases confined to a ring geometry. Our study, conducted at zero temperature using time-dependent density functional theory, cover interaction regimes from strong (unitary Fermi gas) to weak (Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer regime) couplings. Stability is tested against the presence of an external defect within the ring. The dissipation mechanism associated with vortex generation is present in all interaction regimes. Vortex emission is accompanied by Cooper pair breaking, which occurs even beyond the vortex core in the weakly interacting regime. The pair-breaking mechanism prevents the imprinting of a persistent current with a winding number above a threshold, which decreases as the system approach the BCS regime. Our study reveals the existence of two types of critical winding numbers above which currents cease to be persistent in Fermi superfluids: one related to the proliferation of quantum vortices and the other to the onset of the pair-breaking mechanism.

Title: Fragmentation and aggregation of cyanobacterial colonies
Authors: Yuri Z. Sinzato, Robert Uittenbogaard, Petra M. Visser, Jef Huisman, Maziyar Jalaal
Abstract: Fluid flow has a major effect on the aggregation and fragmentation of bacterial colonies. Yet, a generic framework to understand and predict how hydrodynamics affects colony size remains elusive. This study investigates how fluid flow affects the formation and maintenance of large colonial structures in cyanobacteria, using an experimental technique that precisely controls hydrodynamic conditions. We performed experiments on laboratory cultures and lake samples of the cyanobacterium Microcystis, while their colony size distribution was measured simultaneously by direct microscopic imaging. We demonstrate that EPS-embedded cells formed by cell division exhibit significant mechanical resistance to shear forces. However, at elevated hydrodynamic stress levels (exceeding those typically generated by surface wind mixing) these colonies experience fragmentation through an erosion process. We also show that single cells can aggregate into small colonies due to fluid flow. However, the structural integrity of these flow-induced colonies is weaker than that of colonies formed by cell division. We provide a mathematical analysis to support the experiments and demonstrate that a population model with two categories of colonies describes the measured size distributions. Our results shed light on the specific conditions wherein flow-induced fragmentation and aggregation of cyanobacteria are decisive and indicate that colony formation under natural conditions is mainly driven by cell division, although flow-induced aggregation could play a role in dense bloom events. These findings can be used to improve prediction models and mitigation strategies for toxic cyanobacterial blooms and also offer potential applications in other areas such as algal biotechnology or medical settings where the dynamics of biological aggregates play a significant role.

Title: Anharmonic quantum muon effects of light particles in a spin liquid material
Authors: Fabian Hotz, Matjaž Gomilšek, Tina Arh, Thomas Hicken, Polona Umek, Andrej Zorko, Hubertus Luetkens
Abstract: The quantum behavior of light nuclei and other particles in materials challenges classical intuition and introduces novel phenomena. Here we demonstrate that muon spin spectroscopy ( $\mu$SR) is a powerful tool for exploring the quantum effects of light particles, such as the muon, in condensed matter. The muon's quantum nature is profoundly influenced by the surrounding, offering a unique probe for understanding the role of light atoms and their role in shaping local electronic environments. In Zn-barlowite, a candidate quantum spin liquid, we show that standard density functional theory (DFT) methods, which treat the muon as a classical point-like particle, fail to capture its strong quantum anharmonic effects. Only by modeling the muon as a spatially extended quantum particle, thus accounting for the anharmonicity, can the experimental $\mu$SR data be understood. This approach not only improves the interpretation of $\mu$SR results but also opens the door to studying the quantum effects of other light particles, like hydrogen and lithium nuclei, which can greatly influence material properties.

Title: Ambient condition superconductivity via engineered polaronic environment
Authors: Krzysztof Kempa, Michael J. Naughton
Abstract: A vanishing dielectric function is required for longitudinal plasmonic or polaronic modes in a polarizable uniform medium and, in general, heralds the presence of singular charge fluctuations. It is also known that a vanishing dielectric function of an environment strengthens Cooper pairing in a superconductor via resonant anti-shielding (RAS), regardless of pairing origin. We combine these notions in a strategy to strongly enhance superconductivity. Specifically, we propose a superlattice of an ultrathin superconductor film in direct contact with a monolayer of a metal-organic framework material. This structure possesses a momentum-independent and resonant effective dielectric function, a key feature for RAS-enhanced superconductivity. We show that the superlattice facilitates near perfect volumetric intermixing between the superconductor and the engineered dielectric environment. To estimate the critical temperature $T_c$ enhancement, we use the unrestricted Leuven's scaling method, which relates the spectral integral of the RAS-renormalized Eliashberg function $\alpha^2$F to $T_c$, which we showed previously to be in excellent agreement with ab initio simulations, and which we posit may underlie recent observations of enhanced $T_c$ in FeSe on SrTiO$_3$. We carried out a renormalization of the bare $\alpha^2$F, dividing it directly by |$\epsilon_{DE} (\omega)|^2$, where $\epsilon_{DE} (\omega)$ is the q-independent dielectric function of the dielectric environment. Our estimates show that ambient temperature and pressure operation could be achievable in the RAS scheme. We also calculated the quantum Fisher information from the dynamic charge susceptibility in the normal state (for vanishing losses) in our proposed superlattice, and our estimate suggests the presence of superconductivity signatures well above $T_c$ due to quantum charge entanglement buildup.

Title: Covariance Linkage Assimilation method for Unobserved Data Exploration
Authors: Yosuke Harashima, Takashi Miyake, Ryuto Baba, Tomoaki Takayama, Shogo Takasuka, Yasuteru Shigeta, Yuichi Yamaguchi, Akihiko Kudo, Mikiya Fujii
Abstract: This study proposes a materials search method combining a data assimilation technique based on a multivariate Gaussian distribution with Bayesian optimization. The efficiency of the search using this method was demonstrated using a pair of example functions. By combining Bayesian optimization with the data assimilation technique, the maximum value of the example function was found more efficiently compared to ordinary Bayesian optimization without the data assimilation. A practical demonstration was also conducted by constructing a data assimilation model for the bandgap of (Sr$_{1-x_{1}-x_{2}}$La$_{x_{1}}$Na$_{x_{2}}$)(Ti$_{1-x_{1}-x_{2}}$Ga$_{x_{1}}$Ta$_{x_{2}}$)O$_{3}$. The concentration dependence of the bandgap was analyzed, and synthesis was performed with chemical compositions in the sparse region of the training data points to validate the predictions.

Title: Low energy phonons in single crystal ZrW$_{2}$O$_{8}$
Authors: R. A. Ewings, A. I. Duff, K. Refson, T. G. Perring, J. Ollivier
Abstract: ZrW$_{2}$O$_{8}$ is the prototypical example of a material exhibiting negative thermal expansion (NTE). It is now widely accepted that in ZrW$_{2}$O$_{8}$, and in many other framework materials exhibiting NTE, a collection of low energy phonon modes, as opposed to just one or two, are responsible for the anomalous thermal properties. However, quantitative verification and analysis of the density functional theory (DFT) calculations which underpin this proposal are still lacking. In particular, probing the low energy phonons directly throughout reciprocal space using inelastic neutron scattering, as opposed to other techniques which only probe the Brillouin zone center, is technically challenging and hence rarely done. Here we report inelastic neutron scattering measurements in a large number of Brillouin zones over a 400 K temperature range. We find excellent agreement between DFT calculations and experimental data at low temperature. However, the shifts in phonon modes predicted by DFT due to the reduction in lattice parameter (warming) are not observed. This is most likely due to counteractive anharmonic effects, which we verified using finite temperature molecular dynamics (MD) calculations. Notwithstanding, both DFT and MD results are consistent with NTE in ZrW$_{2}$O$_{8}$ arising from the tension effect, and by extension this explanation is supported by the neutron scattering results.

Title: Mode-Dependent Phonon Relaxation in fcc Ni: Insights from Molecular Dynamics Simulations with Frozen-Trajectory Excitations
Authors: Wojciech Marciniak, Joanna Marciniak, José Ángel Castellanos-Reyes, Jan Rusz
Abstract: We present a computational method and apply it to study phonon relaxation in face-centered cubic (fcc) nickel (Ni). The phonons are excited beyond their thermal equilibrium population, and the relaxation behavior is analyzed as a function of both the wave vector $\vec{q}$ and the phonon frequency $\omega$. To efficiently investigate these excitations, we introduce a trajectory post-processing technique, the frozen-trajectory excitation, which facilitates the $(\vec{q},\omega)$-resolved analysis. Molecular dynamics simulations combined with frozen-phonon multislice calculations predict relaxation signatures observable with time-resolved transmission electron microscopy (TEM) at 10--20 fs resolution. Our findings indicate mode dependence in the relaxation processes, highlighting the importance of considering phonon-specific behavior in ultrafast dynamics.

Title: Spin dynamics of triple-Q magnetic orderings in a triangular lattice: Implications for multi-Q orderings in general two-dimensional lattices
Authors: Pyeongjae Park, Woonghee Cho, Chaebin Kim, Yeochan An, Kazuki Iida, Ryoichi Kajimoto, Sakib Matin, Shang-Shun Zhang, Cristian D. Batista, Je-Geun Park
Abstract: Multi-Q magnetic structures on two-dimensional (2D) lattices provide a key route to realizing topological physics in 2D magnetism. A major experimental challenge is to unambiguously confirm their formation by excluding the possibility of topologically trivial multi-domain single- or double-Q magnetic orders, which cannot be distinguished using conventional diffraction techniques. Here, we propose that long-wavelength spin dynamics offers a universal diagnostic for triangular lattices: triple-Q orders that preserve rotational symmetry and single- or double-Q orders that break it exhibit qualitatively distinct anisotropies in their Goldstone mode velocities, stemming from fundamental differences in their underlying spin configurations. We validate this concept using the metallic triangular lattice antiferromagnet Co$_{0.325}$TaS$_{2}$, which hosts both a stripe-type single-Q state and a triple-Q tetrahedral ordering at different temperatures. Using inelastic neutron scattering (INS) and spin dynamics simulations, we first refine the spin Hamiltonian by fitting the paramagnetic excitation spectra, allowing us to develop an unbiased model independent of magnetic ordering. We then show that the observed velocity profiles of the Goldstone modes agree with the high-temperature model's predictions: markedly anisotropic for the single-Q phase and near isotropic for the triple-Q phase. Importantly, this contrast persists across various exchange parameters, highlighting its model-independent nature and suggesting potential applicability to other 2D lattice systems. This work provides universal insight into the dynamical properties of topological multi-Q magnetic orderings in 2D lattice structures, offering a broadly applicable diagnostic to distinguishing them from topologically trivial single- or double-Q counterparts.

Title: Purely electrical detection of the spin-splitting vector in $p$-wave magnets based on linear and nonlinear conductivities
Authors: Motohiko Ezawa
Abstract: A $p$-wave magnet has a momentum-dependent spin splitting and zero-net magnetization just as in the case of an altermagnet. It will be useful for high-density and ultra-fast memory, where the direction of the spin-splitting vector may be used as a bit. The spin-splitting vector corresponds to the Néel vector in altermagnets. However, it is a nontrivial problem to detect the spin-splitting vector in a $p$-wave magnet because time-reversal symmetry is preserved, while this is not a problem in an altermagnet because the anomalous Hall conductivity is present due to the breaking of time-reversal symmetry. Here, we show that it is possible to detect the in-plane component of the spin-splitting vector in the $p$-wave magnet by measuring the linear transverse and longitudinal Drude conductivity. Remarkably, this measurement is possible without using magnetization. Furthermore, we study the nonlinear Drude conductivity, the quantum-metric and the Berry curvature dipole induced nonlinear conductivity in the presence of tiny magnetization along the $z$\ axis. It is possible to detect the $z$-component of the spin-splitting vector by measuring the above nonlinear conductivities. We obtain analytic formulae for them in the first-order perturbation theory, which agree quite well with numerical results without perturbation.

Title: Non-equilibrium THz-phonon spin coupling in CrI3
Authors: V Shokeen, M Pavelka, R Chulkov, A Yaroslavtsev, J Rogvall, D Muradas Belinchón, U Noumbe, M Abdel-Hafiez, M Venkata Kamalakar, O Grånäs, H A Dürr
Abstract: Manipulating magnetism at the THz timescale in atomically thin ferromagnets by exploiting the interactions of spins with optical phonon modes presents an innovative idea for THz spintronics and magnonics. Utilizing the coupling of phonon modes to the magnetization could lead to new ways of generating and controlling spin wave excitations in future applications. We use femtosecond optical laser pulses to generate excitons, bound electron-hole pairs, in bulk-like ferromagnet CrI3 flakes and probe the subsequent charge and spin dynamics with optical pump-probe spectroscopy. In CrI3, exciton formation is known to drive coherent optical phonon modes with 2.4 and 3.9 THz frequencies corresponding to the bending and stretching of the Cr-I bonds. We show that both phonon modes also lead to magnetization oscillations. This establishes spin-phonon coupling for both modes, contrary to previous observations that only report the 3.9 THz phonon mode can influence the CrI3 magnetization.

Title: Investigating Stark many-body localization with continuous unitary transformation flows
Authors: Jan-Niklas Herre, Qiyu Liu, Roman Rausch, Christoph Karrasch, Dante M. Kennes
Abstract: We investigate the ergodicity-to-localization transition in interacting fermion systems subjected to a spatially uniform electric field. For that we employ the recently proposed Tensorflow Equations (TFE), a type of continuous unitary flow equations. This enables us to iteratively determine an approximate diagonal basis of the quantum many-body system. We present improvements to the method, which achieves good accuracy at small to intermediate interaction strengths, even in the absence of an electric field or disorder. Then, we examine two quantities that reveal the fate of Stark MBL in 1D and 2D. First, we investigate the structure of the resulting basis to determine the crossover between ergodic and localized regimes with respect to electric field strength. Second, we simulate long-time dynamics at infinite temperature. Our results in 1D show a localization transition at non-zero field for finite interaction that vanishes with increasing system size leading to localization at infinitesimally small field even in the presence of interactions. In 2D we find less clear signatures of localization and strong finite size effects. We establish that the TFE work accurately up to intermediate times but cannot capture higher order effects in interaction strength that lead to delocalization at longer times in finite-size Stark MBL systems.

Title: Interplay between topology and electron-electron interactions in the moiré MoTe$_{\mathrm{2}}$/WSe$_{\mathrm{2}}$ heterobilayer
Authors: Palash Saha, Louk Rademaker, Michał Zegrodnik
Abstract: We study, the interplay between topology and electron-electron interactions in the moiré MoTe\(_2\)/WSe\(_2\) heterobilayer. In our analysis we apply an effective two-band model with complex hoppings that incorporates the Ising-type spin-orbit coupling and lead to a non-trivial topology after the application of perpendicular electric field (displacement field). The model is supplemented by on-site and inter-site Coulomb repulsion terms and treated by both Hartree-Fock and Gutzwiller methods. According to our analysis, for the case of one hole per moiré unit cell, the system undergoes two phase transitions with increasing displacement field. The first one is from an in-plane 120$^\circ$ antiferromagnetic charge transfer insulator to a topological insulator. At the second transition, the system becomes topologically trivial and an out-of-plane ferrimagnetic metallic phase becomes stable. In the topological region a spontaneous spin-polarization appears and the holes are distributed in both layers. Additionally, we analyze the influence of the intersite Coulomb repulsion terms on the appearance of the topological phase as well as on the formation of the charge density wave state. We discuss the obtained results in the context of available experimental data.

Title: Fractonic superfluids. III. Hybridizing higher moments
Authors: Han-Xie Wang, Shuai A. Chen, Peng Ye
Abstract: Fractonic superfluids are featured by the interplay of spontaneously broken charge symmetry and mobility constraints on single-particle kinematics due to the conservation of higher moments, such as dipoles, angular charge moments, and quadrupoles. Building on prior studies by Yuan \textit{et al.} [\href{this https URL}{Phys. Rev. Res. 2, 023267 (2020)}] and Chen \textit{et al.} [\href{this https URL}{Phys. Rev. Res. 3, 013226 (2021)}], we study a class of fractonic superfluids, termed \textit{hybrid fractonic superfluids} (HFS), in which bosons of multiple species interact while moment hybridization is conserved. We explore the consequences of hybridization via two model series: \textit{Model Series A}, conserving total moments of the same order across species, and \textit{Model Series B}, conserving total moments of different orders. In Model Series A, we analyze dipole moment hybridization and extend the discussion to higher-order moments, examining the ground state, Goldstone modes, correlation functions, and so on. We compute the minimal spatial dimensions, where the total charge symmetry begins to get partially broken via particle-hole condensation, leading to true off-diagonal long-range order. In Model Series B, we focus on HFS with hybrid dipole-quadrupole conservation. For both series, we introduce Bose-Hubbard-type lattice models that reduce to either of both series in the weak Hubbard interaction regime. We perform a mean-field analysis on the global phase diagram and discuss experimental realizations in strongly tilted optical lattices via a third-order perturbation theory. This work, alongside prior studies, completes a trilogy on fractonic superfluids, uncovering symmetry-breaking physics emerging from higher moment conservation, leaving various promising studies for future investigation.

Title: Spin-orbit-entangled electronic structure of Ba$_2$CaOsO$_6$ studied by O $K$-edge resonant inelastic X-ray scattering

Abstract: Transition-metal ions with $5d^2$ electronic configuration in a cubic crystal field are prone to have a vanishing dipolar magnetic moment but finite higher-order multipolar moments, and they are expected to exhibit exotic physical properties. Through an investigation using resonant inelastic X-ray spectroscopy (RIXS), Raman spectroscopy, and theoretical ligand-field (LF) multiplet and $ab initio$ calculations, we fully characterized the local electronic structure of Ba$_2$CaOsO$_6$, particularly, the crystal-field symmetry of the 5$d^2$ electrons in this anomalous material. The low-energy multiplet excitations from RIXS at the oxygen $K$ edge and Raman-active phonons both show no splitting. These findings are consistent with the ground state of Os ions dominated by magnetic octupoles. Obtained parameters pave the way for further realistic microscopic studies of this highly unusual class of materials, advancing our understanding of spin-orbit physics in systems with higher-order multipoles.

Title: Spin density wave and superconductivity in the bilayer $t$-$J$ model of $\rm{La}_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7}$ under renormalized mean-field theory
Authors: Yang Tian, Yan Chen
Abstract: Motivated by the recently discovered bilayer nickelate superconductor, the pressurized $\rm{La}_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7}$, we present a renormalized mean-field theory of a bilayer single-band $t$-$J$ model, highlighting the interplay between magnetism and superconductivity. We analyze the pairing symmetry and magnetic properties of the system, predicting two distinct states in which magnetism and superconductivity coexist. As hole doping increases, the magnetic order is rapidly suppressed. The inter-layer hopping $t_{\perp}$ and coupling $J_{\perp}$ promote a transition from intra-layer $d$-wave pairing to $s$-wave pairing, which is accompanied by a shift from antiferromagnetic (AFM) order to a double spin stripe configuration. The latter has been extensively observed in ambient and high-pressure experiments. Our study offers theoretical insights into the coexistence of spin density waves and superconductivity.

Title: Optimal Estimation of Temperature
Authors: Shaoyong Zhang, Zhaoyu Fei, Xiaoguang Wang
Abstract: Over the past century, the Boltzmann entropy has been widely accepted as the standard definition of entropy for an isolated system. However, it coexists with controversial alternatives, such as the Gibbs entropy. These definitions, including the Boltzmann entropy, exhibit certain inconsistencies, both mathematically and thermodynamically. To address this challenge, we introduce the estimation theory in statistical inference into the study of thermodynamics and statistical physics for finite-sized systems. By regarding the finite-sized system as a thermometer used to measure the temperature of the heat reservoir, we show that optimal estimation of temperature yields the corresponding entropy formula for an isolated system. In the single-sample case, optimal estimation of inverse temperature (or temperature) corresponds to the Boltzmann entropy (or Gibbs entropy). These different definitions of entropy, rather than being contradictory, apply to optimal estimation of different parameters. Furthermore, via the Laplace transform, we identify a complementarity between estimation of temperature and system's energy, a concept suggested by Niels Bohr. We also correct the energy-temperature uncertainty relation, as expressed by the Cramér-Rao bound, in the large-$N$ limit. In the multiple-sample case, we generalize the definitions of both Boltzmann entropy and Gibbs entropy to achieve optimal estimation of temperature, revealing the tight connection between statistical inference and Terrell Hill's nanothermodynamics.

Title: Which chromium-sulfur compounds exist as 2D material?
Authors: Affan Safeer, Mahdi Ghorbani-Asl, Wouter Jolie, Arkady V. Krasheninnikov, Thomas Michely, Jeison Fischer
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) chromium-sulfides are synthesized by molecular beam epitaxy using graphene as a substrate. Structure characterization by employing scanning tunneling microscopy and low energy electron diffraction indicates that there are two 2D phases, Cr$_2$S$_3$-2D and Cr$_{2\frac{2}{3}}$S$_4$-2D, which have not been reported before. Cr$_{2\frac{2}{3}}$S$_4$-2D is related to bulk Cr$_5$S$_6$, but thinner than a bulk unit cell. For Cr$_2$S$_3$-2D, an even thinner material, no bulk counterpart exists. Both 2D materials are found to be structurally stable under ambient conditions and exhibit interesting electronic properties. Extensive first-principles calculations provide further insight into the electronic structure of these systems and indicate that they should be magnetic. Although single layers of CrS$_2$ were predicted to be stable by density functional theory calculations and reported in previous experimental studies, we were unable to synthesize CrS$_2$ under our range of experimental conditions.

Title: Terahertz-induced second-harmonic generation in quantum paraelectrics: hot-phonon effect
Authors: F. Yang, X. J. Li, D. Talbayev, L. Q. Chen
Abstract: Recent terahertz-pump second-harmonic-generation(SHG)-probe measurements of quantum paraelectrics observed a significant long-lived non-oscillatory SHG component following an ultrafast resonant excitation of the soft mode, which was interpreted as a signature of terahertz-induced transient ferroelectric order. Here we propose a temperature-dependent dynamic model incorporating the hot-phonon effect to simulate the soft-mode behaviors under ultrafast terahertz excitation. Its application to paraelectric KTaO3 produces quantitatively most of the features exhibited in our time-resolved SHG measurements and those in existing literature, including a long-lived non-oscillatory SHG response, SHG oscillations at twice the soft-mode frequency, SHG dampings as well as temperature and field-strength dependencies. We conclude that the observed terahertz-induced non-oscillatory SHG response in quantum paraelectrics is a consequence of the induced nonequilibrium hot-phonon effect, offering an alternative to its existing interpretation as a signature of transient ferroelectric order.

Title: Optimizing the Critical Temperature and Superfluid Density of a Metal-Superconductor Bilayer
Authors: Yutan Zhang, Philip M. Dee, Benjamin Cohen-Stead, Thomas A. Maier, Steven Johnston, Richard Scalettar
Abstract: A promising path to realizing higher superconducting transition temperatures $T_c$ is the strategic engineering of artificial heterostructures. For example, quantum materials could, in principle, be coupled with other materials to produce a more robust superconducting state. In this work, we add numerical support to the hypothesis that a strongly interacting superconductor weakened by phase fluctuations can boost its $T_c$ by hybridizing the system with a metal. Using determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC), we simulate a two-dimensional bilayer composed of an attractive Hubbard model and a metallic layer in two regimes of the interaction strength $-|U|$. In the strongly interacting regime, we find that increasing the interlayer hybridization $t_\perp$ results in a nonmonotonic enhancement of $T_c$, with an optimal value comparable to the maximum $T_c$ observed in the single-layer attractive Hubbard model, confirming trends inferred from other approaches. In the intermediate coupling regime, when $-|U|$ is close to the value associated with the maximum $T_c$ of the single-layer model, increasing $t_\perp$ tends to decrease $T_c$, implying that the correlated layer was already optimally tuned. Importantly, we demonstrate that the mechanism behind these trends is related to enhancement in the superfluid stiffness, as was initially proposed by Kivelson [Physica B: Condensed Matter 318, 61 (2002)].

Title: Strongly Repulsive 1D Gases at Higher Branches: Spin-Charge Correlation and Coupled Spin-Chain Model
Authors: Yu Chen, Xiaoling Cui
Abstract: We investigate the higher repulsive branches of one-dimensional (1D) bosonic and fermionic quantum gases beyond the super-Tonks-Girardeau regime, utilizing the Bethe-Ansatz method and exact diagonalization of small trapped clusters. In contrast to the well-studied lowest branches that are characterized by spin-charge separation, we demonstrate the emergence of strong spin-charge correlation in all higher branches with hard-core interactions. This manifests in distinct quasi-momentum distributions and energy spectra for bosons and spin-1/2 fermions, despite their fermionization. Furthermore, trapped fermions in higher branches exhibit novel spin textures, intricately linked to charge excitations, necessitating a coupled multi-chain description beyond single effective spin-chain models. Our findings unveil a rich interplay between spin and charge degrees of freedom in highly excited 1D systems, opening avenues for exploring novel quantum phenomena beyond the conventional paradigm of low-lying states.

Title: Self-organized dynamics and emergent shape spaces of active isotropic fluid surfaces
Authors: Da Gao, Huayang Sun, Rui Ma, Alexander Mietke
Abstract: Theories of self-organized active fluid surfaces have emerged as an important class of minimal models for the shape dynamics of biological membranes, cells and tissues. However, due to their inherent geometric nonlinearities and the absence of general minimization principles in active systems, it remains a major challenge to systematically study the emergent shape spaces such theories give rise to. Here, we introduce a novel variational approach that allows for a direct computation of stationary surface geometries and flows, which enables the classification of non-equilibrium phase transitions in shape spaces described by active surface theories. To achieve this, we construct a dissipation functional systematically from the entropy production in active surfaces and show how generic symmetries imposed by Onsager relations can be exploited to also account for reactive non-dissipative terms in constitutive laws. This functional is supplemented by Lagrange multipliers that relax nonlinear geometric constraints, which leads to a tractable variational problem suitable for implicit dynamic simulations and explicit calculations of non-trivial steady state geometries and flows. We apply this framework to study the dynamics of open fluid membranes and closed active fluid surfaces, and characterize the space of stationary solutions that corresponding surfaces and flows occupy. These analyses rationalize the interplay of first-order shape transitions of internally and externally forced fluid membranes, reveal degenerate regions in stationary shape spaces of mechanochemically active surfaces and identify a mechanism by which hydrodynamic screening controls the geometry of active surfaces undergoing cell division-like shape transformations.

Title: Active particles in moving traps: minimum work protocols and information efficiency of work extraction
Authors: Janik Schüttler, Rosalba Garcia-Millan, Michael E. Cates, Sarah A. M. Loos
Abstract: We revisit the elementary problem of moving a particle in a harmonic trap in finite time with minimal work cost, and extend it to the case of an active particle. By comparing the Gaussian case of an Active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particle and the non-Gaussian run-and-tumble particle, we establish general principles for thermodynamically optimal control of active matter beyond specific models. We show that the open-loop optimal protocols, which do not incorporate system-state information, are identical to those of passive particles but result in larger work fluctuations due to activity. In contrast, closed-loop (or feedback) control with a single (initial) measurement changes the optimal protocol and reduces the average work relative to the open-loop control for small enough measurement errors. Minimum work is achieved by particles with finite persistence time. As an application, we propose an active information engine which extracts work from self-propulsion. This periodic engine achieves higher information efficiency with run-and-tumble particles than with active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles. Complementing a companion paper that gives only the main results [arXiv:2407.18542], here we provide a full account of our theoretical calculations and simulation results. We include derivations of optimal protocols, work variance, impact of measurement uncertainty, and information-acquisition costs.

Title: Enhancement of persistent current in a non-Hermitian disordered ring
Authors: Suparna Sarkar, Soumya Satpathi, Swapan K. Pati
Abstract: We have studied the Aharonov-Bohm flux-induced magnetic response of a disordered non-Hermitian ring. The disorder is introduced through an on-site quasiperiodic potential described by the Aubry-André-Harper (AAH) model, incorporating a complex phase that renders the model non-Hermitian. Our findings reveal that this form of non-Hermiticity enhances the persistent current, without requiring hopping dimerization. We explore both non-interacting and interacting scenarios. In the former, we examine spinless fermions, while in the latter, we consider fermions with Hubbard interactions. The Non-Hermitian phase induces both the real and imaginary components of the current. We thoroughly analyze the energy eigenspectrum, ground state energy, and persistent current in both real and imaginary spaces for various system parameters. Our primary goal is to investigate the combined effects of non-Hermiticity and disorder strength on persistent currents. We find an enhancement in both the real and imaginary components of the persistent current with increasing disorder strength, as well as the non-Hermiticity, up to a critical value. Furthermore, we observe an enhancement in persistent current in the presence of Hubbard correlation. Our findings may provide a new route to get nontrivial characteristics in persistent current for a special type of non-Hermitian systems.

Title: Pinch-line spin liquids as layered Coulomb phases and applications to cubic models
Authors: Naïmo Davier, Flavia A. Gómez Albarracín, H. Diego Rosales, Pierre Pujol, Ludovic D. C. Jaubert
Abstract: Spin liquids form fluctuating magnetic textures which have to obey certain rules imposed by frustration. These rules can often be written in the form of a Gauss law, indicating the local conservation of an emergent electric field. In reciprocal space, these emergent Gauss laws appear as singularities known as pinch points, that are accessible to neutron-scattering measurements. But more exotic forms of electromagnetism have been stabilized in spin liquids, and in a few rare instances, these zero-dimensional singularities have been extended into one-dimensional pinch lines. Here we propose a simple framework for the design of pinch-line spin liquids in a layered structure of two-dimensional algebraic spin liquids. A plethora of models can be build within this framework, as exemplified by several concrete examples where our theory is confirmed by simulations, and where the rank of the tensorial gauge field is continuously varied along the pinch line, opening new avenues in fractonic matter. Then we use our framework to understand how the evolution of the singularity pinch point along the pinch line can be understood as the interference pattern of two emergent electric fields. Finally, we apply our intuition on these emergent electric fields in real space to generic pinch line models beyond our layered framework, and revisit the recently proposed pinch line model on the octochlore lattice.

Title: Relativistic Spin-Lattice Interaction Compatible with Discrete Translation Symmetry in Solids
Authors: Bumseop Kim, Noejung Park, Kyoung-Whan Kim
Abstract: Recent interest in orbital angular momentum has led to a rapid expansion of research on spin-orbit coupling effects in solids, while also highlighting significant technical challenges. The breaking of rotational symmetry renders the orbital angular momentum operator ill-defined, causing conceptual and computational issues in describing orbital motion. To address these issues, here we propose an alternative framework. Based on the Bloch representation of the full relativistic interaction, we derive a field that directly couples to electron spins while preserving discrete translational symmetry, thereby eliminating the need for the position operator. Our approach is fully compatible with existing first-principles computational frameworks for both static and time-dependent density functional theory. We demonstrate that this method offers a more effective description of the Edelstein and spin Hall effects compared to conventional orbital angular momentum formalisms.

Title: $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauging and self-dualities of the $XX$ model and its cousins
Authors: Lei Su
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the one-dimensional $XX$ lattice model and its cousins through the lens of momentum and winding $U(1)$ symmetries. We distinguish two closely related $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries based on their relation to the $U(1)$ symmetries, and establish a web of $\mathbb{Z}_2$-gauging relations among these models, rooted in two fundamental seeds: the $ XY \pm YX$ models. These two seeds, each self-dual under gauging of the respective $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetries, possess manifestly symmetric conserved charges, making transparent the connection between the noninvertible symmetries and the Kramers-Wannier duality. By leveraging the self-dualities of these two seed models, we derive the self-dualities of their cousins, including the $XX$ model and the Levin-Gu model, through appropriate gauging procedures. Moreover, under these gauging schemes, the lattice T-duality matrices take the form of the identity matrix. These lattice models flow to the $c =1$ compact boson conformal field theory, with a twist that depends on the lattice size modulo four. Finally, we unify the mapping structures of local conserved charges across these models, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding their symmetries and dualities.

Title: Scalable Multi-temperature Free Energy Sampling of the Alchemical Space
Authors: Ping Tuo, ZeZhu Zeng, Jiale Chen, Bingqing Cheng
Abstract: Generative models have advanced significantly in sampling material systems with continuous variables, such as atomistic structures. However, their application to discrete variables, like atom types or spin states, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce a Boltzmann generator built on discrete flow matching, specifically tailored for systems with discrete phase-space coordinates (e.g., the Ising model or crystalline compounds). This approach enables a single model to sample free energy surfaces over a wide temperature range with minimal training overhead. In addition, the model generation is scalable to larger lattice sizes than those in the training set. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the 2D Ising model, showing efficient and reliable free energy sampling. This framework provides a scalable and computationally efficient solution for discrete coordinate systems and can be extended to sample the alchemical degrees of freedom in crystalline compounds.

Title: Magnetoconductivity due to electron-electron interaction in a non-Galilean-invariant Fermi liquid
Authors: Tatia Kiliptari, Dmitrii L. Maslov
Abstract: The $T^2$-scaling of resistivity with temperature is often viewed as a classic hallmark of a Fermi-liquid (FL) behavior in metals. However, if umklapp scattering is suppressed, this scaling is not universally guaranteed to occur. In this case, the resistivity behavior is influenced by several factors, such as dimensionality (two vs. three), topology (simply- vs. multiply-connected Fermi surfaces), and (in two dimensions) the shape (convex vs. concave) of the Fermi surface (FS). Specifically for an isotropic spectrum, as well as for a two-dimensional (2D) convex FS, the $T^2$ term is absent, and the first non-zero contribution scales as $T^4\ln T$ in 2D and as $T^4$ in 3D. In this paper, we study the $T$-dependence of the resistivity, arising from electron-electron interactions, in the presence of a weak magnetic field. We show that, for an isotropic FS in any dimensions and for a convex 2D FS, the $T^2$ term is also absent in both Hall and diagonal components of the magnetoconductivity, which instead scale as $BT^4\ln T$ and $B^2T^4\ln T$, respectively, in 2D and as $BT^4$ and $B^2T^4$ in 3D. The FL-like scaling, i.e., $BT^2$ and $B^2T^2$ of the Hall and diagonal conductivities is recovered for a concave FS in 2D. Furthermore, we show that, for an isotropic spectrum, magnetoresistance is absent even in the presence of electron-electron interactions. Additionally, we examine the high-temperature limit, when electron-electron scattering prevails over electron-impurity one, and show that all the components of the conductivity tensor saturate in this limit at values that are determined by impurity scattering but, in general, differ from the corresponding values at $T=0$.

Title: Finite-time performance of a cyclic 2d quantum Ising heat engine
Authors: S. P. Katoorani, C. Kohlfürst, F. Queisser, G. Schaller, R. Schützhold
Abstract: We discuss the limit cycle regime of a finite-time quantum Otto cycle with a frictionless two-dimensional anisotropic Ising model as the working fluid. From Onsagers exact equilibrium solution, we first find optimal parameters for the operational modes of work extraction and cooling for infinitely slow cycles. The equilibrium points in these optimal cycles correspond to different phases of the model, such that the non-equilibrium dynamics during the cycle bypasses the phase transition. Finite-time cycles allow for finite power extraction or cooling currents, but for such cycles we point out that -- already within the regime of weak system-reservoir coupling -- energetic changes of the system during dissipative strokes may contain a significant portion of coupling and decoupling control work and should thus not be directly identified with heat. For ultrafast cycles, the required control work spoils performance, such that to maximize work extraction or cooling heat per cycle time, there is an optimal cycle duration. We also find that net zero-energy transitions may lead to undesired reservoir heating.

Title: Data-driven Azimuthal RHEED construction for in-situ crystal growth characterization
Authors: Abdourahman Khaireh-Walieh, Alexandre Arnoult, Sébastien Plissard, Peter R. Wiecha
Abstract: Reflection High-Energy Electron Diffraction (RHEED) is a powerful tool to probe the surface reconstruction during MBE growth. However, raw RHEED patterns are difficult to interpret, especially when the wafer is rotating. A more accessible representation of the information is therefore the so-called Azimuthal RHEED (ARHEED), an angularly resolved plot of the electron diffraction pattern during a full wafer rotation. However, ARHEED requires precise information about the rotation angle as well as of the position of the specular spot of the electron beam. We present a Deep Learning technique to automatically construct the Azimuthal RHEED from bare RHEED images, requiring no further measurement equipment. We use two artificial neural networks: an image segmentation model to track the center of the specular spot and a regression model to determine the orientation of the crystal with respect to the incident electron beam of the RHEED system. Our technique enables accurate, and potentially real-time ARHEED construction on any growth chamber equipped with a RHEED system.

Title: Many-body quantum chaos and time reversal symmetry
Authors: Weijun Wu, Saumya Shivam, Amos Chan
Abstract: We investigate universal signatures of quantum chaos in the presence of time reversal symmetry (TRS) in generic many body quantum chaotic systems (gMBQCs). We study three classes of minimal models of gMBQCs with TRS, realized through random quantum circuits with (i) local TRS, (ii) global TRS, and (iii) TRS combined with discrete time-translation symmetry. In large local Hilbert space dimension $q$, we derive the emergence of random matrix theory (RMT) universality in the spectral form factor (SFF) at times larger than the Thouless time $t_{\mathrm{Th}}$, which diverges with system sizes in gMBQCs. At times before $t_{\mathrm{Th}}$, we identify universal behaviour beyond RMT by deriving explicit scaling functions of SFF in the thermodynamic limit. In particular, in the simplest non-trivial setting - preserving global TRS while breaking time translation symmetry - we show that the SFF is mapped to the partition function of an emergent classical ferromagnetic Ising model, where the Ising spins correspond to the time-parallel and time-reversed pairings of Feynman paths, and external magnetic fields are induced by TRS-breaking mechanisms. Without relying on the large-$q$ limit, we develop a second independent derivation of the Ising scaling behaviour of SFF using space-time duality and parity symmetric non-Hermitian Ginibre ensembles. Moreover, we show that many body effects originating from time-reversed pairings of Feynman paths manifest in the two-point autocorrelation function (2PAF), the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC), and the partial spectral form factor - quantities sensitive to both eigenvalue and eigenstate correlations. We establish that the fluctuations of 2PAF are governed by an emergent three-state Potts model, leading to an exponential scaling with the operator support size, at a rate set by the three-state Potts model.

Title: Asymmetric real topology of conduction and valence bands
Authors: J. X. Dai, Chen Zhang, Y. X. Zhao
Abstract: Previously, it was believed that conduction and valence bands exhibit a symmetry: They possess opposite topological invariants (e.g., the Chern numbers of conduction and valence bands for the Chern insulator are $\pm C$). However, we present a counterexample: The second Stiefel-Whitney numbers for conduction and valence bands over the Klein bottle may be asymmetric, with one being nontrivial while the other trivial. Here, the Stiefel-Whitney classes are the characteristic classes for real Bloch functions under $PT$ symmetry with $(PT)^2=1$, and the Klein bottle is the momentum-space unit under the projective anticommutation relation of the mirror reflection reversing $x$ and the translation along the $y$ direction. The asymmetry originates from the algebraic difference of real cohomology classes over the Klein bottle and torus. This discovery is rooted in the foundation of topological band theory, and has the potential to fundamentally refresh our current understanding of topological phases.

Title: Size-Dependent Power Laws for Edge Dislocations in Nickel Superalloys: A Molecular Dynamics Study
Authors: Divyeshkumar A. Mistry, Amuthan A. Ramabathiran
Abstract: We present computational evidence using MD simulations of a size effect for the critical resolved shear stress (CRSS) of edge dislocation motion in nickel superalloys. We model the superalloy as periodically spaced cubic $\gamma'$ precipitates inside a uniform $\gamma$ matrix. We then analyze the motion of paired edge dislocations in the $\gamma$ phase when subject to an external shear stress for various volume fractions of the $\gamma'$ precipitate for temperatures in the range 300 K to 700 K. The CRSS is found to exhibit a power law dependence on the volume fraction of the $\gamma'$ precipitate with two distinct regimes which have similar exponent but markedly different prefactors across a wide range of temperatures. We present a detailed analysis of this behavior and reduce it to a linear dependence of the CRSS on the length of the $\gamma'$ precipitate along the direction of dislocation motion. We further identify the critical length scale underlying the transition between the two observed regimes as the total core width of the paired dislocations in a pure $\gamma'$ system, which includes in addition to the complex stacking fault separating the partials of the paired dislocations the width of the anti-phase boundary that is formed between the super-dislocations. We present auxillary results using spherical precipitates that exhibit the same trend, but a full analysis of the interplay between size of the precipitate, volume fraction, and other related factors is not pursued in this work. Despite the special configurations considered in this work, the results presented here highlights non-trivial size-dependent effects, provides new details on the strengthening effect of $\gamma'$ precipitates in nickel superalloys, and has important implications for larger scale dislocation dynamics studies for nickel superalloys.

Title: Quantum anomalous Hall effects and emergent $\rm{SU}(2)$ Hall ferromagnets at fractional filling of helical trilayer graphene
Authors: Sen Niu, Jason Alicea, D. N. Sheng, Yang Peng
Abstract: Helical trilayer graphene realizes a versatile moiré system for exploring correlated topological states emerging from high Chern bands. Motivated by recent experimental observations of anomalous Hall effects at fractional fillings of magic-angle helical trilayers, we focus on the higher Chern number $|C_{band}|=2$ band and explore gapped many-body Hall states beyond the conventional Landau level paradigm. Through extensive exact diagonalization, we predict novel phases unattainable in a single $|C_{band}|=1$ band. At filling $\nu=2/3$ and $\nu=1/3$, a $\sqrt{3}\times \sqrt{3}$ charge-ordered quantum Hall crystal and a Halperin fractional Chern insulator with Hall conductance $|\sigma_{H}|=2e^2/3h$ are predicted respectively, indicating strong particle-hole asymmetry of the system. At half-filling $\nu=1/2$, an extensively degenerate pseudospin Hall ferromagnet featuring emergent $\rm{SU}(2)$ symmetry is found without the band being flat. Inspired by striking robustness of the ferromagnetic degeneracy, we develop a method to unveil and quantify the emergent symmetry via pseudospin operator construction in the presence of band dispersion and Coulomb interaction, and demonstrate persistence of the $\rm{SU}(2)$ quantum numbers even far away from the chiral limit. Incorporating spin-valley degrees of freedom, we identify an optimal filling regime $\nu_{\rm{total}}=3+\nu$ for realizing the above states. Notably, inter-flavor interactions renormalize the bandwidth and stabilize all the gapped phases even in realistic sublattice corrugation parameter regimes.

Title: Neural Object Detection for 4D STEM: High-Throughput Sub-Pixel Electron Diffraction Pattern Recognition
Authors: Arda Genc, Ravit Silverstein
Abstract: High-throughput analysis of multidimensional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) datasets remains a significant challenge, limiting the broader impact on strategic materials research. Conventional workflows typically involve sequential, modular processing steps that necessitate extensive manual intervention and offline parameter tuning. In this work, we introduce an end-to-end post-processing framework for large-scale four-dimensional scanning TEM (4D-STEM) datasets, built around a highly efficient neural network-based object detection model. Central to our method is a sub-pixel accurate object center localization algorithm, which serves as the foundation for high-precision and high-throughput analysis of electron diffraction patterns. We demonstrate a strain measurement precision of 5x$10^{-4}$, quantified by the standard deviation of strain values within the strain-free Si substrate of a Si/SiGe multilayer TEM sample. Furthermore, by implementing an asynchronous, non-blocking object detection workflow, we achieve speeds exceeding 100 frames per second (fps), substantially accelerating the crystallographic phase identification and strain mapping in complex multiphase metallic alloys.

Title: Crushing, Comminution and Fracture: Extreme Particle Deformation in Three-Dimensional Granular Aggregates
Authors: Debdeep Bhattacharya, Davood Damircheli, Robert P. Lipton
Abstract: We present a high-fidelity three dimensional computational framework for simulating the bulk mechanical behavior of granular aggregates composed of deformable brittle grains. Departing from classical discrete element methods (DEM), our approach captures both inter-particle and intra-particle deformation using a nonlocal continuum formulation based on peridynamics. Each grain is individually meshed from level-set representations, enabling accurate modeling of elastic response and autonomous fracture evolution without requiring explicit crack tracking or fragment reconstruction. We validate the method through benchmark simulations, including the Kalthoff-Winkler fracture test, crushing of hollow spheres, and compound impact-crushing scenarios. The framework is further applied to large aggregates of up to 1000 sand grains of irregular shapes reconstructed from three dimensional X-ray computed tomography. Simulations reveal convergence of bulk stress response under compression, suggesting the feasibility of constructing representative volume elements (RVEs) for multiscale modeling. Finally, we investigate the role of grain geometry and topology on the macroscopic strength of the aggregate, providing insight into microstructure-driven failure mechanisms. The framework exhibits excellent strong and weak scaling behavior, with simulations executed on up to 1600 cores, demonstrating its suitability for high-performance computing environments and large-scale modeling.

Title: Graphene Nanoribbons as a Majorana Platform
Authors: Ruize Ma, Michele Pizzochero, Gaurav Chaudhary
Abstract: Graphene nanoribbons support a range of electronic phases that can be controlled via external stimuli. Zigzag-edged graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs), in particular, exhibit an antiferromagnetic insulating ground state that transitions to a half-metallic phase under a transverse electric field or when embedded inside hexagonal Boron Nitride. Here, we consider a simple model of a heterostructure of a ZGNR with an Ising superconductor and show that, the Ising superconductor with a parent s-wave spin-singlet pairing can induce spin-triplet odd-parity pairing in the half-metallic phase of the ZGNR. The resulting superconducting phase is topologically nontrivial, with gate-tunable transitions that enable the emergence of Majorana zero modes.

Title: Quantum metric and localization in a quasicrystal
Authors: Quentin Marsal, Patric Holmvall, Annica M. Black-Schaffer
Abstract: We use the quantum metric to understand the properties of quasicrystals, represented by the one-dimensional (1D) Fibonacci chain. We show that the quantum metric can relate the localization properties of the eigenstates to the scale-invariance of both the chain and its energy spectrum. In particular, the quantum metric incorporates information about distances between the local symmetry centers of each eigenstate, making it much more sensitive to the localization properties of quasicrystals than other measures of localization, such as the inverse participation ratio. We further find that a full description of localization requires us to introduce a new phasonic component to the quantum metric, and a mixed phason-position Chern number. Finally, we show that the sum of both position and phasonic components of the quantum metric is lower-bounded by the gap labels associated with each energy gap of the Fibonacci chain. This establishes a direct link between the spatial localization and fractal energy spectrum of quasicrystals. Taken together, the quantum metric provides a unifying, yet accessible, understanding of quasicrystals, rooted in their scale-invariance and with intriguing consequences also for many-body physics.

Title: Correcting systematic errors in the likelihood optimization of underdamped Langevin models of molecular dynamics trajectories
Authors: David Daniel Girardier, Hadrien Vroylandt, Sara Bonella, Fabio Pietrucci
Abstract: Since Kramers' pioneering work in 1940, significant efforts have been devoted to studying Langevin equations applied to physical and chemical reactions projected onto few collective variables, with particular focus on the inference of their parameters. While the inference for overdamped Langevin equations is well-established and widely applied, a notable gap remains in the literature for underdamped Langevin equation. This gap arises from the challenge of accessing velocities solely through finite differences of positions, resulting in spurious correlations. In this letter, we propose an analytical correction for these correlations, specifically designed for a likelihood-maximization algorithm that exploits short, non-ergodic trajectories that can be obtained at reasonable numerical cost. The accuracy and robustness of our approach are tested on a benchmark case and a realistic system. This work paves the way for applying generalized Langevin equation inference to activated phenomena, such as chemical reactions, in several scientific domains.

Title: Tunable phase transitions from semimetals to Chern insulators in two-dimensional quadratic-band-crossing materials
Authors: Wen-Hao Bian, Jing Wang
Abstract: We systematically investigate how static symmetry-breaking perturbations and dynamic Floquet terms via a polarized light manipulate the topological phase transitions in the two-dimensional quadratic-band-crossing-point (QBCP) materials. The Berry curvature shows distinct behavior in such two situations. It is linearly and quadratically proportional to the product of microstructural parameters $t_{x,z}$ for the former and the latter, respectively. The static perturbation eliminates the QBCP and opens an energy gap, which leads to the momentum-inversion symmetry of Berry curvature. This yields a nontrivial Chern number determined by the microstructural parameters. In contrast, we demonstrate that either a circularly or an elliptically polarized light breaks the time-reversal symmetry, transforming the QBCP semimetal into a Chern insulator with a quantized anomalous Hall conductivity $\sigma_{xy} = Ce^2/\hbar$, where the Chern number is governed by the polarization angle. Moreover, the linear polarization preserves the central antisymmetry of the Berry curvature, giving rise to a topological trivial insulator. These results establish a tunable topological phase transition from a QBCP semimetal to Chern insulator in the two-dimensional QBCP materials.

Title: Seeding neural network quantum states with tensor network states
Authors: Ryui Kaneko, Shimpei Goto
Abstract: We find an efficient approach to approximately convert matrix product states (MPSs) into restricted Boltzmann machine wave functions consisting of a multinomial hidden unit through a canonical polyadic (CP) decomposition of the MPSs. This method allows us to generate well-behaved initial neural network quantum states for quantum many-body ground-state calculations in polynomial time of the number of variational parameters and systematically shorten the distance between the initial states and the ground states with increasing the rank of the CP decomposition. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method by taking the transverse-field Ising model as an example and discuss possible applications of our method to more general quantum many-body systems in which the ground-state wave functions possess complex nodal structures.

Title: Electron-phonon vertex correction effect in superconducting H3S
Authors: Shashi B. Mishra, Hitoshi Mori, Elena R. Margine
Abstract: The Migdal-Eliashberg (ME) formalism provides a reliable framework for describing phonon-mediated superconductivity in the adiabatic regime, where the electronic Fermi energy exceeds the characteristic phonon energy. In this work, we go beyond this limit by incorporating first-order vertex corrections to the electron-phonon (e-ph) interaction within the Eliashberg formalism and assess their impact on the superconducting properties of H3S and Pb using first-principles calculations. For H3S, where the adiabatic assumption breaks down, we find that vertex corrections to the e-ph coupling are substantial. When combined with phonon anharmonicity and the energy dependence of the electronic density of states, the predicted critical temperature (Tc) is in very good agreement with experimental observations. In contrast, for elemental Pb, where the adiabatic approximation remains valid, vertex corrections have a negligible effect, and the calculated Tc and superconducting gap closely match the predictions of the standard ME formalism. These findings demonstrate the importance of non-adiabatic corrections in strongly coupled high-Tc hydrides and establish a robust first-principles framework for accurately predicting superconducting properties across different regimes.

Title: A unifying approach to self-organizing systems interacting via conservation laws
Authors: Frank Barrows, Guanming Zhang, Satyam Anand, Zixi Chen, Jonathan Lin, Aman Desai, Stefano Martiniani, Francesco Caravelli
Abstract: We present a unified framework for embedding and analyzing dynamical systems using generalized projection operators rooted in local conservation laws. By representing physical, biological, and engineered systems as graphs with incidence and cycle matrices, we derive dual projection operators that decompose network fluxes and potentials. This formalism aligns with principles of non-equilibrium thermodynamics and captures a broad class of systems governed by flux-forcing relationships and local constraints. We extend this approach to collective dynamics through the PRojective Embedding of Dynamical Systems (PrEDS), which lifts low-dimensional dynamics into a high-dimensional space, enabling both replication and recovery of the original dynamics. When systems fall within the PrEDS class, their collective behavior can be effectively approximated through projection onto a mean-field space. We demonstrate the versatility of PrEDS across diverse domains, including resistive and memristive circuits, adaptive flow networks (e.g., slime molds), elastic string networks, and particle swarms. Notably, we establish a direct correspondence between PrEDS and swarm dynamics, revealing new insights into optimization and self-organization. Our results offer a general theoretical foundation for analyzing complex networked systems and for designing systems that self-organize through local interactions.

Abstract: This study investigates the torsional mechanical properties of pristine iron (Fe) and carbon-doped iron (FeC) nanowires with [001] orientation through molecular dynamics simulations utilizing the Modified Embedded Atom Method (MEAM) potential developed by Liyanage et al. for accurately modeling Fe-C interactions in body-centered cubic structures. Systematic analysis across carbon concentrations (0 - 10%), temperatures (1 - 900 K), and cross-sectional dimensions 10a, 13a, 15a, ( where a = 2.81 Angstrom represents the lattice constant ) within the LAMMPS environment reveals that increasing carbon content weakens grain boundaries, reducing the maximum shear stress required to reach the critical torsional angle, while higher temperatures promote phase transitions from elastic to plastic deformation due to enhanced atomic vibrations, and larger cross-sections exhibit higher shear stress resistance attributed to strengthening effects from the outer atomic layers. By elucidating these interrelationships between carbon content, temperature, and dimensional factors, this work provides fundamental insights into the mechanical behavior of FeC nanowires under torsional loading conditions, offering valuable guidance for their potential applications in nanoelectromechanical systems, nanorobotic actuators, and advanced structural materials where precise control of mechanical properties is essential.

Title: Thermal SU(2) lattice gauge theory for the pseudogap and the transition to $d$-wave superconductivity in the cuprates
Authors: Harshit Pandey, Maine Christos, Pietro M. Bonetti, Ravi Shanker, Sayantan Sharma, Subir Sachdev
Abstract: We study a square lattice SU(2) gauge theory with link variables $U$, formulated to describe the intermediate temperature pseudogap metal phase of underdoped cuprates of hole density $p$, and its evolution into nodal $d$-wave superconductivity upon cooling. The theory features two fermionic matter sectors: one consists of SU(2)-gauge-neutral, electron-like quasiparticles forming hole pockets; the other is a critical quantum spin liquid composed of electrically neutral spinons, carrying spin $S = 1/2$, Dirac nodes, and transforming in the fundamental representation of the SU(2) gauge group. These sectors interact via a Yukawa coupling to a spinless Higgs boson $B$, which carries electric charge $+e$ and also transforms under the fundamental representation of SU(2). The theory arises from a canonical transformation of the square lattice Hubbard model and a pair of ancilla qubits on each site, along with a specific choice of the spin liquid. We employ a Born-Oppenheimer-type approximation: thermal fluctuations of the bosons $B$ and $U$ are treated classically, while the fermions are fully quantum. Monte Carlo simulations of an effective boson energy functional are consistent with a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition involving $h/(2e)$ vortices, driving the onset of $d$-wave superconductivity. Each vortex is surrounded by a halo of charge order, consistent with scanning tunneling microscopy observations by Hoffman et al. (arXiv:cond-mat/0201348). Above the transition, the electron spectral function exhibits "Fermi arcs", in agreement with ARPES data by Norman et al. (arXiv:cond-mat/9710163) and Shen et al. (Science 307, 901 (2005)). Our model also displays quantum oscillations with area $p/8$ under a magnetic field, aligning with recent evidence via the Yamaji effect by Chan et al. (arXiv:2411.10631).

Title: Analytic toolkit for the Anderson model with arbitrary disorder
Authors: Oleg Evnin
Abstract: The Anderson model in one dimension is a quantum particle on a discrete chain of sites with nearest-neighbor hopping and random on-site potentials. It is a progenitor of many further models of disordered systems, and it has spurred numerous developments in various branches of physics. The literature is silent, however, on practical analytic tools for computing the density-of-states of this model when the distribution of the on-site potentials is arbitrary. Here, supersymmetry-based techniques are employed to give an explicit linear integral equation whose solutions control the density-of-states. The output of this analytic procedure is in perfect agreement with numerical sampling. By Thouless formula, these results immediately provide analytic control over the localization length.

Title: Anomaly diagnosis via symmetry restriction in two-dimensional lattice systems
Authors: Kyle Kawagoe, Wilbur Shirley
Abstract: We describe a method for computing the anomaly of any finite unitary symmetry group $G$ acting by finite-depth quantum circuits on a two-dimensional lattice system. The anomaly is characterized by an index valued in the cohomology group $H^4(G,U(1))$, which generalizes the Else-Nayak index for locality preserving symmetries of quantum spin chains. We show that a nontrivial index precludes the existence of a trivially gapped symmetric Hamiltonian; it is also an obstruction to ``onsiteability" of the symmetry action. We illustrate our method via a simple example with $G=\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2$. Finally, we provide a diagrammatic interpretation of the anomaly formula which hints at a higher categorical structure.

Title: Fractional Thouless pumping of solitons: a unique manifestation of bulk-edge correspondence of nonlinear eigenvalue problems
Authors: Chenxi Bai, Zhaoxin Liang
Abstract: Recent foundational studies have established the bulk-edge correspondence for nonlinear eigenvalue problems using auxiliary eigenvalues $\hat{H}\Psi=\omega S(\omega)\Psi$, spanning both linear [T. Isobe et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 126601 (2024)] and nonlinear [Chenxi Bai and Zhaoxin Liang, Phys. Rev. A. 111, 042201 (2025)] Hamiltionians. This raises a fundamental question: Can eigenvalue nonlinearity generate observable physical phenomena absent in conventional approaches ($\hat{H}\Psi=E\Psi$)? In this work, we demonstrate the first uniquely nonlinear manifestation of this correspondence: fractional Thouless pumping of solitons. Through systematic investigation of nonlinear Thouless pumping in an extended Rice-Mele model with next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) couplings, we discover that the NNN parameters can induce fractional topological phases despite quantized topological invariants from conventional approaches. Crucially, these fractional phases are explained within the auxiliary eigenvalue framework, linking nonlinear spectral features directly to bulk-boundary correspondence. This work reveals novel phenomena emerging from the interplay between nonlinearity and NNN couplings, providing key insights for designing topological insulators and controlling quantum edge states in nonlinear regimes.

Title: A Cryogenic Uniaxial Strain Cell for Elastoresistance Measurements
Authors: Franz Eckelt, Isidoro Cavallaro, Ralph Wagner, Amir-Abbas Haghighirad, Thomas Wolf, Jana Wilmers, Swantje Bargmann, Christian Hess
Abstract: We present the design, implementation, and validation of a cryo-compatible strain cell for elastoresistance measurements in quantum materials. The cell is actuated by three large-format piezoelectric stacks and enables both compressive and tensile strain up to approximately $\pm5\%$. The relative displacement of the sample holders is measured in situ using a high-resolution capacitive displacement sensor, ensuring precise strain control throughout measurement. To operate the strain cell over a broad temperature range from 4.2\,K to 300\,K, a modular measurement probe was developed, allowing efficient thermal coupling and integration into cryogenic environments. The functionality and precision of the setup were demonstrated by elastoresistance measurements on the iron-based superconductor BaFe$_2$As$_2$ along the [110] direction. The results were validated against conventional techniques based on glued samples and strain gauges, showing excellent agreement in amplitude and temperature dependence of the elastoresistance coefficient. Additional tests revealed that the system remains robust under mechanical vibrations introduced by vacuum pumps, enabling stable operation even with liquid nitrogen cooling. This highlights the high mechanical and thermal reliability of the developed platform for low-temperature transport measurements under controlled uniaxial strain.

Title: The Effect of Pearl Vortices on the Shape and Position of Néel-Type Skyrmions in Superconductor-Chiral Ferromagnet Heterostructures
Authors: S. S. Apostoloff, E. S. Andriyakhina, I. S. Burmistrov
Abstract: This review presents recent work carried out at the Landau Institute for Theoretical Physics of the Russian Academy of Sciences on the study of the effect of superconducting vortices on the shape and position of Néel-type skyrmions in superconductor--chiral ferromagnet heterostructures. Based on analytical and numerical approaches, a number of effects caused by the inhomogeneous magnetic field of the vortex have been predicted: a significant increase in the skyrmion radius, a change in its chirality in the case of a coaxial configuration of the vortex and skyrmion, and modification of the skyrmion shape in the case of an eccentric configuration. Recent experiments studying these effects are discussed.

Title: Entropy-based models to randomize real-world hypergraphs
Authors: Fabio Saracco, Giovanni Petri, Renaud Lambiotte, Tiziano Squartini
Abstract: Network theory has often disregarded many-body relationships, solely focusing on pairwise interactions: neglecting them, however, can lead to misleading representations of complex systems. Hypergraphs represent a suitable framework for describing polyadic interactions. Here, we leverage the representation of hypergraphs based on the incidence matrix for extending the entropy-based approach to higher-order structures: in analogy with the Exponential Random Graphs, we introduce the Exponential Random Hypergraphs (ERHs). After exploring the asymptotic behaviour of thresholds generalising the percolation one, we apply ERHs to study real-world data. First, we generalise key network metrics to hypergraphs; then, we compute their expected value and compare it with the empirical one, in order to detect deviations from random behaviours. Our method is analytically tractable, scalable and capable of revealing structural patterns of real-world hypergraphs that differ significantly from those emerging as a consequence of simpler constraints.

Title: Nonreciprocal quantum phase transition in cavity magnonics
Authors: Ye-jun Xu, Long-hua Zhai, Peng Fu, Shou-jing Cheng, Guo-Qiang Zhang
Abstract: We investigate the nonreciprocal quantum phase transition in a cavity magnonic system driven by a parametric field, where an yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere is placed in a spinning microwave resonator. The system exhibits a rich phase diagram due to both magnon Kerr nonlinearity in YIG and parametric drive on the resonator. Especially, Sagnac-Fizeau shift caused by the spinning of the resonator brings about a significant modification in the critical driving strengths for second- and first-order quantum phase transitions, which means that the highly controllable quantum phase can be realized by the spinning speed of the resonator. More importantly, based on the difference in the detunings of the counterclockwise and clockwise modes induced by spinning direction of the resonator, we show that the phase transition in this system is nonreciprocal, that is, the quantum phase transition occurs when the cavity is driven in one direction but not the other. Our work offers an alternative path to engineer and design nonreciprocal magnonic devices.

Title: Spectra of noisy parameterized quantum circuits: Single-Ring universality
Authors: Kristian Wold, Pedro Ribeiro, Sergey Denisov
Abstract: Random unitaries are an important resource for quantum information processing. While their universal properties have been thoroughly analyzed, it is not known what happens to these properties when the unitaries are sampled on the present-day noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers. We implement parameterized circuits, which have been proposed as a means to generate random unitaries, on an IBM Quantum processor and model these implementations as quantum maps. To retrieve the maps, a machine-learning assisted tomography is used. We find the spectrum of a map to be either an annulus or a disk depending on the circuit depth and detect an annulus-disk transition. By their spectral properties, the retrieved maps appear to be very similar to a recently introduced ensemble of random maps, for which spectral densities can be analytically evaluated. Our results establish, via Dissipative Quantum Chaos theory, a connection between intrinsic properties of present-day noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computing platforms and non-Hermitian random matrix theory.

Title: Emergence of global receptive fields capturing multipartite quantum correlations
Authors: Oleg M. Sotnikov, Ilia A. Iakovlev, Evgeniy O. Kiktenko, Mikhail I. Katsnelson, Aleksey K. Fedorov, Vladimir V. Mazurenko
Abstract: In quantum physics, even simple data with a well-defined structure at the wave function level can be characterized by extremely complex correlations between its constituent elements. The inherent non-locality of the quantum correlations generally prevents one from providing their simple and transparent interpretation, which also remains a challenging problem for advanced classical techniques that approximate quantum states with neural networks. Here we show that monitoring the neural network weight space while learning quantum statistics from measurements allows to develop physical intuition about complex multipartite patterns and thus helps to construct more effective classical representations of the wave functions. Particularly, we observe the formation of distinct global convolutional structures, receptive fields in the hidden layer of the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) within the neural quantum tomography of the highly-entangled Dicke states. On this basis we propose an exact two-parameter classical representation not only for a specific quantum wave function, but for the whole family of the N-qubit Dicke states of different entanglement. Our findings suggest a fresh look at constructing convolutional neural networks for processing data with non-local patterns and pave the way for developing exact learning-based representations of entangled quantum states.

Title: Neural Projected Quantum Dynamics: a systematic study
Authors: Luca Gravina, Vincenzo Savona, Filippo Vicentini
Abstract: We investigate the challenge of classical simulation of unitary quantum dynamics with variational Monte Carlo approaches, addressing the instabilities and high computational demands of existing methods. By systematically analyzing the convergence of stochastic infidelity optimizations, examining the variance properties of key stochastic estimators, and evaluating the error scaling of multiple dynamical discretization schemes, we provide a thorough formalization and significant improvements to the projected time-dependent Variational Monte Carlo (p-tVMC) method. We benchmark our approach on a two-dimensional Ising quench, achieving state-of-the-art performance. This work establishes p-tVMC as a powerful framework for simulating the dynamics of large-scale two-dimensional quantum systems, surpassing alternative VMC strategies on the investigated benchmark problems.

Title: Symmetry verification for noisy quantum simulations of non-Abelian lattice gauge theories
Authors: Edoardo Ballini, Julius Mildenberger, Matteo M. Wauters, Philipp Hauke
Abstract: Non-Abelian gauge theories underlie our understanding of fundamental forces of modern physics. Simulating them on quantum hardware is an outstanding challenge in the rapidly evolving field of quantum simulation. A key prerequisite is the protection of local gauge symmetries against errors that, if unchecked, would lead to unphysical results. While an extensive toolkit devoted to identifying, mitigating, and ultimately correcting such errors has been developed for Abelian groups, non-commuting symmetry operators complicate the implementation of similar schemes in non-Abelian theories. Here, we discuss two techniques for error mitigation through symmetry verification, tailored for non-Abelian lattice gauge theories implemented in noisy qudit hardware: dynamical post-selection (DPS), based on mid-circuit measurements without active feedback, and post-processed symmetry verification (PSV), which combines measurements of correlations between target observables and gauge transformations. We illustrate both approaches for the discrete non-Abelian group $D_3$ in 2+1 dimensions, explaining their usefulness for current NISQ devices even in the presence of fast fluctuating noise. Our results open new avenues for robust quantum simulation of non-Abelian gauge theories, for further development of error-mitigation techniques, and for measurement-based control methods in qudit platforms.

Title: Stabilizer entropy in non-integrable quantum evolutions
Authors: Jovan Odavić, Michele Viscardi, Alioscia Hamma
Abstract: Entanglement and stabilizer entropy are both involved in the onset of complex behavior in quantum many-body systems. Their interplay is at the root of complexity of simulability, scrambling, thermalization and typicality. In this work, we study the dynamics of entanglement, stabilizer entropy, and the anti-flatness of the entanglement spectrum after a quantum quench in a spin chain. We find that free-fermion theories show a gap in the long-time behavior of these resources compared to their random matrix theory value while non-integrable models saturate it.

Title: Spectroscopic footprints of quantum friction in nonreciprocal and chiral media
Authors: O. J. Franca, Fabian Spallek, Steffen M. Giesen, Robert Berger, Kilian Singer, Stefan Aull, Stefan Yoshi Buhmann
Abstract: We investigate how the quantum friction experienced by a polarizable atom moving with constant velocity parallel to a planar interface is modified when the latter consists of chiral or nonreciprocal media, with special focus on topological insulators. We use macroscopic quantum electrodynamics to obtain the velocity-dependent Casimir-Polder frequency shift and decay rate. These results are a generalization to matter with time-reversal symmetry breaking. We illustrate our findings by examining the nonretarded and retarded limits for five examples: a perfectly conducting mirror, a perfectly reflecting nonreciprocal mirror, a three-dimensional topological insulator, a perfectly reflecting chiral mirror and an isotropic chiral medium. We find different asymptotic power laws for all these materials. Interestingly, we find two bridges between chirality and nonreciprocity through the frequency shift that arise as a consequence of the magnetoelectric coupling. Namely, the position-dependent Casimir-Polder frequency shift for the nonreciprocal case depend on a geometric magnetic field associated with photoionization of chiral molecules, the Casimir-Polder depending on the velocities for the chiral case have the optical rotatory strength as the atomic response while those for the nonreciprocal case depend on an analog of the optical rotatory strength.

Title: The Influence of V-Defects, Leakage, and Random Alloy Fluctuations on the Carrier Transport in Red InGaN MQW LEDs
Authors: Huai-Chin Huang, Shih-Min Chen, Claude Weisbuch, James S. Speck, Yuh-Renn Wu
Abstract: Red InGaN-based light-emitting diodes (LEDs) exhibit lower internal quantum efficiencies (IQEs) than violet, blue, and green InGaN LEDs due to a reduction in radiative recombination rates relative to non-radiative recombination rates as the indium composition increases. Additionally, the larger polarization and band offset barriers between high indium content InGaN quantum wells and GaN quantum barriers increase the forward voltage. In blue and green LEDs, random alloy fluctuations and V-defects play a key role in reducing the forward voltage. When V-defects are present, either naturally or intentionally introduced, they create an alternative path for carrier injection into the MQWs through the V-defect sidewalls. This injection mechanism explains the turn-on voltages of green LEDs. However, in InGaN red LEDs, these two phenomena do not reduce the forward voltage as effectively as in blue and green LEDs, and consequently, the computed forward voltage remains significantly higher than the measured one. Furthermore, currents are observed at low voltages before the turn-on voltage (\(V < \hbar\omega/e = 2.0 \, \text{V}\)) of red LEDs. To address this, we introduce dislocation-induced tail states in the modeling, suggesting that leakage current through these states may play a significant role both below and at turn-on voltages. The simulation also indicates that leakage carriers below turn-on accumulate, partially diffuse in the QWs, screen the polarization-induced barrier in the low injection regime, and further reduce the forward voltage. Despite these beneficial effects, a drawback of dislocation-induced tail states is the enhanced nonradiative recombination in the dislocation line region. This study provides a detailed analysis of device injection physics in InGaN QW red LEDs and outlines potential optimization strategies.

Title: Transitions of the Lyapunov spectrum and entanglement entropy in monitored quantum dynamics with homogeneous unitary gates
Authors: Ken Mochizuki, Ryusuke Hamazaki
Abstract: We explore the Lyapunov spectrum and entanglement entropy in systems evolved by quantum measurements and spatially homogeneous unitary gates. In models with temporally random and Floquet unitary gates, we find that the Lyapunov exponents typically converge to values independent of measurement outcomes and that spectral transitions of the Lyapunov spectrum and entanglement transitions of ground states occur at the same measurement thresholds. Our results indicate that (i) randomness due to quantum measurements is enough, or equivalently, randomness of unitary gates is not essential, for the typical convergence of the Lyapunov spectrum and that (ii) the correspondence between the spectral transition and entanglement transition is ubiquitous in a wide range of systems. We also discuss why the typical convergence occurs, in light of the uniqueness and positive definiteness of stationary states in the completely-positive trace-preserving (CPTP) dynamics averaged over random measurement outcomes.

Title: A disturbance in the force. How force fluctuations hinder dynamical friction and induce core stalling
Authors: Pierfrancesco Di Cintio, Bruno Marcos
Abstract: Dynamical friction is an important phenomena in stellar dynamics resulting in the slowing down of a test particle upon many two-body scatters with background particles. Chandrasekhar's original formulation, developed for idealized infinite and homogeneous systems, has been found to be sufficiently accurate even in models of finite extent and radially dependent density profiles. However, in some cases $N-$body simulations evidenced a breakdown of Chandrasekhar's formalism. In particular, in the case of cored stellar systems, the analytical predictions underestimate the rate of in-fall of the test particle. Several explanations for such discrepancy have been proposed so far, in spite of this it remains unclear whether the origin is a finite N effect or an effect arising from the resonance of the orbits of the test and field particles, which is independent on $N$, such as dynamical buoyancy. Here we aim at shedding some light on this issue with tailored numerical experiments. We perform ad hoc simulations of a massive tracer initially placed on a low eccentricity orbit in spherical equilibrium models with increasing resolution. We use an $N-$body code where the self-consistent interaction among the background particles can be substituted with the effect of the static smooth potential of the system's continuum limit, so that the higher order contributions to the dynamical friction arising from the formation of a wake can be neglected if needed. We find that, contrary to what reported in the previous literature, a suppression of dynamical friction happens in both cuspy and cored models. When neglecting the interaction among field particles we observe in both cases a clear $N^{-1/2}$ scaling of the radius at which dynamical friction ceases to be effective. This hints towards a granularity-induced origin of the so-called core-stalling of the massive tracer in cored models.

Title: An Agentic Framework for Autonomous Metamaterial Modeling and Inverse Design
Authors: Darui Lu, Jordan M. Malof, Willie J. Padilla
Abstract: Recent significant advances in integrating multiple Large Language Model (LLM) systems have enabled Agentic Frameworks capable of performing complex tasks autonomously, including novel scientific research. We develop and demonstrate such a framework specifically for the inverse design of photonic metamaterials. When queried with a desired optical spectrum, the Agent autonomously proposes and develops a forward deep learning model, accesses external tools via APIs for tasks like simulation and optimization, utilizes memory, and generates a final design via a deep inverse method. The framework's effectiveness is demonstrated in its ability to automate, reason, plan, and adapt. Notably, the Agentic Framework possesses internal reflection and decision flexibility, permitting highly varied and potentially novel outputs.

Title: Introduction to Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Model: A Strongly Correlated System Perspective
Authors: Rishabh Jha
Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model provides an analytically tractable framework for exotic strongly correlated phases where conventional paradigms like Landau's Fermi liquid theory collapse. This review offers a pedagogical introduction to the SYK physics, highlighting its unique capacity to model \textit{strange metals} -- systems exhibiting linear-in-temperature resistivity, Planckian dissipation, and quasiparticle breakdown. We systematically construct both Majorana and complex fermion variants, transforming them into training grounds for modern many-body physics techniques, for instance, (1) large-$N$ formulations via disorder averaging and replica symmetry, (2) Schwinger-Dyson and Kadanoff-Baym equations, (3) imaginary time Matsubara formulation, (4) real-time dynamics via Keldysh formalism, and the associated (5) non-perturbative Keldysh contour deformations. These tools lay the foundation for equilibrium thermodynamics, quantum chaos, quench dynamics, and transport in the thermodynamic limit, all within a solvable, chaotic quantum system. Intended as a self-contained resource, the review bridges advanced technical machinery to physical insights, with computational implementations provided. Though principally treating the SYK model as a condensed matter laboratory, we also highlight its profound connection to quantum gravity, woven throughout this work, underscoring how this solvable chaotic fermionic model serves as a lens onto black hole thermodynamics and holographic duality.
