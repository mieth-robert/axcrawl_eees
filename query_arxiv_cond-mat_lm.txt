Title: High-quality nanostructured diamond membranes for nanoscale quantum sensing
Authors: Alexander Pakpour Tabrizi, Artur Lozovoi, Sean Karg, Tecla Bottinelli Mondandon, Melody Leung, Kai-Hung Cheng, Nathalie P. de Leon
Abstract: Deploying nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond as nanoscale quantum sensors for condensed matter and materials physics requires placing the NV centers close to the sensing target. One solution is to fabricate diamond nanostructures and integrate them with materials and devices. However, diamond etching and ion milling can introduce subsurface damage and surface defects that degrade the charge stability and spin coherence of NV centers near the surface. Here we report a procedure for fabricating low-damage nanostructured diamond membranes, and we show that this fabrication scheme preserves the optical and spin properties of state-of-the-art shallow NV center quantum sensors, within nanometers of the diamond surface, while providing significant photonic enhancement. Furthermore, we demonstrate a pick-and-place transfer method, which enables integration with diverse sensing targets.

Title: Dephasing-induced Quantum Hall Criticality in the Quantum Anomalous Hall system
Authors: Fei Yang, Dong E. Liu
Abstract: Conventional wisdom holds that static disorder is indispensable to the integer quantum Hall effect, underpinning both quantized plateaus and the plateau-plateau transition. We show that pure dephasing, without elastic disorder, is sufficient to generate the same $\theta$ driven criticality. Starting from a Keldysh formulation, we derive an open system nonlinear $\sigma$ model (NL$\sigma$M) for class A with a topological $\theta$ term but no Cooperon sector, and we demonstrate that nonperturbative instantons still govern a two parameter flow of $(\sigma_{xx},\sigma_{xy})$. Evaluating $\theta$ in a dephasing quantum anomalous Hall setting, we predict a quantum Hall critical point at $\sigma_{xy}=1/2$ with finite $\sigma_{xx}$ the hallmark of the integer quantum Hall universality class realized without Anderson localization. Boundary driven simulations of the Qi_Wu_Zhang model with local dephasing confirm this prediction and provide an experimentally aligned protocol to extract $(\sigma_{xx},\sigma_{xy})$ from Hall potential maps. By establishing dephasing as a self contained route to Hall criticality, our framework reframes plateau physics in open solid state and cold atom platforms and offers practical diagnostics for topological transport in nonunitary matter.

Title: Analytical Solution and Lie Algebra of the Relativistic Boltzmann Equation
Authors: Yi Wang, Xuan Zhao, Zhe Xu, Jin Hu
Abstract: In this work, we present a novel and more efficient approach to constructing the relativistic BKW (Bobylev, Krook, and Wu) solution. By introducing a class of ansatz functions for the distribution function, we demonstrate that within this specific ansatz space, only the equilibrium and BKW-type forms yield exact solutions to the nonlinear Boltzmann equation. Furthermore, guided by physical insight and drawing upon the framework of relativistic kinetic theory, we derive the Lie algebra of invariant transformations admitted by the relativistic Boltzmann equation. From this algebra, the corresponding symmetry group transformations can be systematically constructed.

Title: Universality and weak-ergodicity breaking in quantum quenches
Authors: Guido Giachetti, Andrea Solfanelli, Nicolò Defenu
Abstract: Sudden quenches in quantum many-body systems often lead to dynamical evolutions that unveil surprising physical behaviors. In this work, we argue that the emergence of weak ergodicity breaking following quantum quenches in certain local many-body systems is a direct consequence of lattice discretization. To support this claim, we investigate the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of quantum $O(n)$ models on a lattice. In doing so, we also revisit two puzzling results in the literature on quantum $O(n)$ models, concerning universal scaling and equilibration, and demonstrate how these apparent contradictions can be resolved by properly accounting for lattice effects.

Title: Polaron and Strain Effects on Ion Migration in WO$_3$
Authors: Matthäus Siebenhofer, Pjotrs Žguns, Bilge Yildiz
Abstract: Ion migration in WO$_3$ is a critical process for various technological applications, such as in batteries, electrochromic devices and energy-efficient brain-inspired computing devices. In this study, we investigate the migration mechanisms of H$^+$, Li$^+$, and Mg$^{2+}$ ions in monoclinic WO$_3$, and how energy barriers are affected by the presence of electron polarons and by lattice strain. Our approach in calculating the migration paths and barriers is based on density functional theory methods. The results show that the presence of polarons leads to association effects and lattice deformations that increase ion migration barriers. Therefore, the consideration of polarons is critical to accurately predict activation energies of ion migration. We further show that lattice strain modulates ion migration barriers, however, the impact of strain depends on the migrating ion. For protons that are embedded in the oxygen ion electronic shells and hop from donor to acceptor oxygens, compressive lattice strain accelerates migration by reducing the donor-acceptor distance. In contrast, the migration barriers of larger ions decrease with tensile lattice strain that increases the free space for the ion in the transition state. These insights into the effects of polarons and lattice strain are important for understanding and tuning properties of WO$_3$ when aiming for optimized device characteristics.

Title: Mechanical and electrical properties of a nano-gap or how to play the nano-accordion
Authors: Simon Hettler, Raul Arenal
Abstract: In-situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) has become an important technique to study dynamic processes at highest spatial resolution and one branch is the investigation of phenomena related with electrical currents. Here, we present experimental results obtained from a peculiar in-situ TEM device, which was prepared with the aim to analyze the relationship between (thermo)electric properties and specific crystal orientations of a misfit layered compound. The formation of a nano-sized gap at a grain boundary facilitated a precisely controllable mechanical bending of the device by application of differential heating currents. The devices' electrical properties were found to be substantially influenced by the gap, leading to a high intrinsic voltage. This voltage additionally depends on the vacuum environment and on the history of applied heating currents. These findings are largely attributed to the presence of adsorbed molecules within the gap region. The electrical in-situ TEM studies of this work illustrate that interior surfaces can strongly influence electrical properties even under high vacuum conditions.

Title: Decoupling Composition and Band Gap in $κ$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ Heterostructures via STEM-EELS
Authors: Annett Thøgersen, Georg Muntingh, Lasse Vines, Øystein Prytz, Max Kneiß, Marius Grundmann, Holger von Wenckstern, Ingvild J. T. Jensen
Abstract: High-resolution mapping of electronic properties at oxide heterointerfaces remains challenging due to probe delocalization and overlapping signals. In this work, we employ monochromated, probe-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy combined with electron energy-loss spectroscopy (STEM-EELS) to resolve band gap variations across $\kappa$-Ga$_2$O$_3$-based multilayers with nanometer-scale precision. A custom automated quantitative-based EELS analysis framework enabled automated band gap fitting and visualization, ensuring reproducibility and high spatial resolution. By optimizing acquisition parameters and quantifying inelastic delocalization, we demonstrate reliable extraction of band gap excitations from layers only a few nanometers thick. For heterostructures grown on ITO templates, strain at defect-free interfaces induces a gradual band gap transition from $5.08~\mathrm{eV}$ to $4.28~\mathrm{eV}$ over $\sim 10~\mathrm{nm}$, despite an abrupt compositional change. In contrast, ZnO-based templates introduce structural defects that relieve strain, yielding band gaps consistent with composition. These results establish STEM-EELS as a powerful tool for nanoscale electronic characterization and highlight the dominant role of interfacial strain over composition in governing local band structure.

Title: Lyapunov exponents explain disorder-induced polarization and soliton teleportation in a mechanical Markov system
Authors: Will Stephenson, Nan Cheng, Kai Sun, Xiaoming Mao
Abstract: Using a mapping between spatial disorder and temporal stochasticity, we develop a new framework using Lyapunov exponents to explain exotic wave localization and mobility phenomena in disordered one-dimensional (1D) mechanical systems that can be constructed via a spatial analog of a Markov process, which we call ``mechanical Markov systems.'' We show that disorder induces robust polarization of zero modes (ZMs) in these mechanical Markov systems, and this phenomenon is explained using Lyapunov exponents. Remarkably, these ZMs become mobile solitons in the nonlinear regime despite the disorder-controlled localization of all other modes, and display a set of new nonlinear dynamics features including reflectionless chirality-dependent teleportation, which can also be explained using Lyapunov exponents. Our results establish the Markov formalism as a powerful tool to explain and design localization and dynamics in disordered mechanical systems, opening opportunities for programmable metamaterials with novel linear and nonlinear responses.

Title: Average density of Bloch electrons in a homogeneous magnetic field: a second-order response
Authors: Benjamin M. Fregoso
Abstract: We compute the average density of a three-dimensional multiband crystal of arbitrary symmetry, metal or insulator, to first and second order in a weak static magnetic field. To linear order and for insulators, the density follows the well-known Streda formula, but for metals there is an extra contribution from the orbital magnetic moments at the Fermi surface. To second order, we find that the average density depends on several microscopic processes. Among these, the quantum metric tensor plays an important role by generating a pseudo-magnetic moment resulting from the rotation of the Bloch wave functions in the complex projective plane. We also discuss the implications of our results for the volume and pressure. The method we develop is explicitly gauge invariant, considers intraband and interband processes on equal footing, accommodates relaxation processes, and can be readily extended to other observables.

Title: Probing short-range gravity using quantum reflection
Authors: J. Boynewicz, C. A. Sackett
Abstract: Quantum reflection occurs when ultra-cold atoms are incident on a material surface with sufficiently low velocity. The reflecting matter wave can interfere with the incident wave to form a detectable pattern, and this pattern contains information about atom-surface interactions at micrometer scales. We discuss how such an interferometer could be used to probe for anomalous short-range forces that are predicted by some beyond-standard model theories. We compare a simple analytical model for the anomalous phase to numerical solution of both the linear and non-linear Schrodinger equations, finding good agreement. With interactions, the phase does depend on the atomic density, which can be a source of noise. We nonetheless predict that under realistic conditions, the reflection technique can reach sensitivities approaching those obtained with macroscopic objects, and significantly improve the limits on anomalous coupling to atoms.

Title: The mechanical latching memory of an adhesive tape
Authors: Sebanti Chattopadhyay, Carys Chase-Mayoral, Nathan Keim
Abstract: The storage and retrieval of mechanical imprints from past perturbations is a central theme in soft matter physics. Here we study this effect in the partial peeling of an ordinary adhesive tape, which leaves a line of strong adhesion at the stopping point. We show how this behavior can be used to mechanically store and retrieve the amplitudes of successive peeling cycles. This multiple-memory behavior resembles the well-known return-point memory found in many systems with hysteresis, but crucially the driving here is rectified: peeling is unidirectional, where each cycle begins and ends with the tape flat on the substrate. This condition means that the tape demonstrates a distinct principle for multiple memories. By considering another mechanism that was recently proposed, we establish ``latching'' as a generic principle for memories formed under rectified driving, with multiple physical realizations. We show separately that tape can be tuned to erase memories partially and also demonstrate the function of tape as a mechanical computing device that extracts features from input sequences and compares successive values.

Title: TEM Agent: enhancing transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with modern AI tools
Authors: Morgan K. Wall, Alexander J. Pattison, Edward S. Barnard, Stephanie M. Ribet, Peter Ercius
Abstract: Recent improvements in large language models (LLMs) have had a dramatic effect on capabilities and productivity across many disciplines involving critical thinking and writing. The development of the model context protocol (MCP) provides a way to extend the power of LLMs to a specific set of tasks or scientific equipment with help from curated tools and resources. Here, we describe a framework called TEM Agent designed for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) that leverages the benefits of LLMs through a MCP approach. We simultaneously access and control several subsystems of the TEM, a data management platform, and high performance computing resources through text-based instructions. We demonstrate the abilities of the TEM Agent to set up and complete intricate workflows using a simplified set of MCP tools and resources accompanying a commercial LLM without any additional training. The use of a framework such as the TEM Agent simplifies access to complex microscope ecosystems comprised of several vendor and custom systems enhancing the ability of users to accomplish microscopy experiments across a range of difficulty levels.

Title: Material-Based Intelligence: Self-organizing, Autonomous and Adaptive Cognition Embodied in Physical Substrates
Authors: Vladimir A. Baulin, Rudolf M. Füchslin, Achille Giacometti, Helmut Hauser, Marco Werner
Abstract: The design of intelligent materials often draws parallels with the complex adaptive behaviors of biological organisms, where robust functionality stems from sophisticated hierarchical organization and emergent long-distance coordination among a myriad local components. Current synthetic materials, despite integrating advanced sensors and actuators, predominantly demonstrate only simple, pre-programmed stimulus-response functionalities, falling short of robustly autonomous intelligent behavior. These systems typically execute tasks determined by rigid design or external control, fundamentally lacking the intricate internal feedback loops, dynamic adaptation, self-generated learning, and genuine self-determination characteristic of biological agents. This perspective proposes a fundamentally different approach focusing on architectures where material-based intelligence is not pre-designed, but arises spontaneously from self-organization harnessing far-from-equilibrium dynamics. This work explores interdisciplinary concepts from material physics, chemistry, biology, and computation, identifying concrete pathways toward developing materials that not only react, but actively perceive, adapt, learn, self-correct, and potentially self-construct, moving beyond biomimicry to cultivate fully synthetic, self-evolving systems without external control. This framework outlines the fundamental requirements for, and constraints upon, future architectures where complex, goal-directed functionalities emerge synergistically from integrated local processes, distinguishing material-based intelligence from traditional hardware-software divisions. This demands that concepts of high-level goals and robust, replicable memory mechanisms are encoded and enacted through the material's inherent dynamics, inherently blurring the distinction between system output and process.

Title: Complex Eigenvalues in a pseudo-Hermitian \b{eta}-Laguerre ensemble
Authors: Cleverson Andrade Goulart, Gleb Oshanin, Mauricio Porto Pato
Abstract: Non-Hermitian PT-symmetric models have been extensively studied in recent years. Following the seminal work that reduced classical random matrix ensembles to a tridiagonal form, several efforts have aimed to generalize this framework to non-Hermitian extensions of the so-called \b{eta}-ensembles. In particular, while the transition of eigenvalues from the real axis to the complex plane has been well characterized for the \b{eta}-Hermite ensemble under symmetry breaking, the behavior of the \b{eta}-Laguerre ensemble in a similar non-Hermitian setting remains less understood. In this work, we investigate an ensemble of unstable matrices isospectral to the \b{eta}-Laguerre ensemble. Introducing a small non-Hermitian perturbation breaks the symmetry and drives the eigenvalues into the complex plane. We derive analytical expressions for the loci of complex-conjugate eigenvalue pairs, which organize into a balloon-like structure in the complex plane, followed by a discrete finite line of real eigenvalues. The asymptotic behavior of these eigenvalues is analyzed in the large matrix-size limit, and our theoretical predictions are supported by numerical simulations.

Title: Mobile chemical cage: Revealing the origin of anomalous lithium diffusion in liquid $Li_{17}Pb_{83}$ alloy
Authors: Sensen Lin, Yang Gao, Yongheng Lu, Yongkuan Zhang, Yiqiang Sun
Abstract: The high-temperature performance of liquid $Li_{17}Pb_{83}$, a key fusion reactor material, is governed by its atomic-scale dynamics. Using ab initio molecular dynamics, we discover that lithium diffusion is not free but confined within cages formed by lead atoms, a phenomenon we term the chemical cage effect. Structurally, RDF and CSRO analyses confirm a stable local environment where Li is preferentially surrounded by Pb. Dynamically, the MSD and NGP reveal anomalous, heterogeneous lithium diffusion characterized by repeated cage-breaking events. The double-exponential relaxation of the Li-Pb bond probability further distinguishes the escape dynamics of Li from surface and bulk cages. ELF and DOS analyses identify the polar covalent Li-Pb bond as the electronic origin of this cage. This study establishes the chemical bond-directed synergistic cage effect as the core mechanism in $Li_{17}Pb_{83}$, moving beyond traditional geometric constraint models and providing a new paradigm to understand transport in multi-component liquid alloys.

Title: Quasi-linear magnetoresistance and paramagnetic singularity in Hypervalent Bismuthide
Authors: Zhongchen Xu, Yi Yan, Zhihao Liu, Jie Pang, Guohao Dong, Xiutong Deng, Shengnan Zhang, Xianmin Zhang, Youguo Shi, Quansheng Wu
Abstract: Materials featuring hypervalent bismuth motifs have generated immense interest due to their extraordinary electronic structure and exotic quantum transport. In this study, we synthesized high-quality single crystals of La3ScBi5 characterized by one-dimensional hypervalent bismuth chains and performed a systematic investigation of the magnetoresistive behavior and quantum oscillations. The metallic La3ScBi5 exhibits a low-temperature plateau of electrical resistivity and quasi-linear positive magnetoresistance, with anisotropic magnetoresistive behaviors suggesting the presence of anisotropic Fermi surfaces. This distinctive transport phenomenon is perfectly elucidated by first-principles calculations utilizing the semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory. Furthermore, the nonlinear Hall resistivity pointed towards a multiband electronic structure, characterized by the coexistence of electron and hole carriers, which is further supported by our first-principles calculations. Angle-dependent de Haas-van Alphen oscillations are crucial for further elucidating its Fermiology and topological characteristics. Intriguingly, magnetization measurements unveiled a notable paramagnetic singularity at low fields, which might suggest the nontrivial nature of the surface states. Our findings underscore the interplay between transport phenomena and the unique electronic structure of hypervalent bismuthide La3ScBi5, opening avenues for exploring novel electronic applications.

Title: Phonon Thermal Hall Effect: The Roles of Disorder, Annealing, and Metallic Contacts
Authors: Qiaochao Xiang, Xiaokang Li, Xiaodong Guo, Kamran Behnia, Zengwei Zhu
Abstract: The phonon thermal Hall effect (THE) is a ubiquitous yet poorly understood phenomenon in insulators. Its microscopic origin remains debated, partly due to significant sample-dependent variations that hint at uncontrolled experimental parameters. Using SrTiO$_3$ as a model system, we identify disorder and uncontrolled strain as suppressors of a thermal Hall signal. Crystals with high thermal conductivity exhibit a substantial thermal Hall angle $\nabla T_y / \nabla T_x$ (up to 0.3\% at 9 T), whereas the effect is virtually absent in disordered samples. Crucially, annealing (in air atmosphere) these disordered samples partially restores the THE (approximately 0.1\% at 9 T) with little effect on the longitudinal thermal conductivity. This decoupling reveals that the amplitude of THE is not simply set by the phonon mean free path. Furthermore, measurements performed with metallic and insulating contacts yield identical results on the same sample. This definitively rules out parasitic signals as the effect's origin. Our work, by establishing the phonon THE as an intrinsic property of the crystal lattice and extremely sensitive to disorder, sharply constrains theoretical scenarios.

Title: Introduction to the Modern Theory of Bose-Einstein Condensation, Superfluidity, and Superconductivity
Authors: Phil Attard
Abstract: The modern theory of Bose-Einstein condensation, superfluidity, and superconductivity is reviewed. The thermodynamic principle for superfluid flow and the equation of motion for condensed bosons are given. Computer simulations of Lennard-Jones $^4$He give the $\lambda$-transition and the superfluid viscosity. The statistical mechanical theory of high-temperature superconductivity is presented. Critical comparison is made with older approaches, such as ground energy state condensation, irrotational superfluid flow, and the macroscopic wavefunction.

Title: MicroEvoEval: A Systematic Evaluation Framework for Image-Based Microstructure Evolution Prediction
Authors: Qinyi Zhang, Duanyu Feng, Ronghui Han, Yangshuai Wang, Hao Wang
Abstract: Simulating microstructure evolution (MicroEvo) is vital for materials design but demands high numerical accuracy, efficiency, and physical fidelity. Although recent studies on deep learning (DL) offer a promising alternative to traditional solvers, the field lacks standardized benchmarks. Existing studies are flawed due to a lack of comparing specialized MicroEvo DL models with state-of-the-art spatio-temporal architectures, an overemphasis on numerical accuracy over physical fidelity, and a failure to analyze error propagation over time. To address these gaps, we introduce MicroEvoEval, the first comprehensive benchmark for image-based microstructure evolution prediction. We evaluate 14 models, encompassing both domain-specific and general-purpose architectures, across four representative MicroEvo tasks with datasets specifically structured for both short- and long-term assessment. Our multi-faceted evaluation framework goes beyond numerical accuracy and computational cost, incorporating a curated set of structure-preserving metrics to assess physical fidelity. Our extensive evaluations yield several key insights. Notably, we find that modern architectures (e.g., VMamba), not only achieve superior long-term stability and physical fidelity but also operate with an order-of-magnitude greater computational efficiency. The results highlight the necessity of holistic evaluation and identify these modern architectures as a highly promising direction for developing efficient and reliable surrogate models in data-driven materials science.

Title: AC magnetometry of van der Waals magnets using ultrasensitive Graphene Hall sensors
Authors: Eugene Park, Jihoon Keum, Ji-Hwan Baek, Hyuncheol Kim, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Gwan-Hyoung Lee, Je-Geun Park
Abstract: Probing the dynamical magnetic properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials requires sensitive techniques capable of detecting small magnetic fields from nanoscale samples. We demonstrate quantitative AC and DC magnetometry of a ferromagnetic Fe3-xGeTe2 nanoflakes using ultrasensitive graphene Hall sensors. These devices achieve record-low magnetic field detection noise at both cryogenic and room temperature, enabled by hBN encapsulation, low-resistance fluorographene contacts, and a novel fabrication process. We perform quantitative AC susceptibility measurements up to 1 kHz, resolving both real and imaginary components with nanotesla-scale sensitivity and milliradian phase accuracy, the first such measurement in a van der Waals magnet. Our results establish graphene Hall sensors as a powerful and broadly applicable platform for studying magnetic and superconducting phases near the 2D limit.

Title: Higher-order topological superconductivity in type-II time-reversal-symmetric Weyl semimetals with a hybrid pairing
Authors: Junkang Huang, Z. D. Wang, Tao Zhou
Abstract: We employed the self-consistent method on a two-orbital type-II time-reversal-symmetric Weyl semimetal, revealing a hybrid pairing of singlet $s$-wave and triplet $p$-wave. We present a detailed analysis of the normal-state electronic structure and the self-consistent results. Our findings indicate that the selection of hybrid pairings is governed by distinct surface Fermi-arc configurations: specifically, $s$-wave pairing dominates on the bottom surface, while $p$-wave pairing prevails on the top. Furthermore, the emergent superconducting state is a second-order topological superconductors with hinge states in the system. Our results identify type-II time-reversal-invariant Weyl semimetals as a promising intrinsic platform for realizing unconventional and topological superconductivity.

Title: High-speed, High-Resolution, Three-Dimensional Imaging of Threading Dislocations in beta-$Ga_{2}O_{3}$ via Phase-Contrast Microscopy
Authors: Yukari Ishiakwa, Daiki Katsube, Yongzhao Yao, Koji Sato, Kohei Sasaki
Abstract: This study presents a nondestructive, high-resolution method for three-dimensional imaging of threading dislocations in beta-$Ga_{2}O_{3}$ (010) using phase-contrast microscopy (PCM). A one-to-one correspondence between dislocation contrasts in PCM images and synchrotron X-ray topography (SR-XRT) images confirms the detection capability of PCM. Compared to SR-XRT, PCM provides enhanced spatial resolution, enabling the distinction of closely spaced dislocations with sub-10-micrometer separation. PCM facilitates direct visualization of dislocation propagation paths along the depth (z) direction by systematically shifting the focal plane into the crystal. In addition, the projection of stacked PCM images enables in-plane (XY) tracing of dislocation lines, providing insight into the preferred slip systems in beta-$Ga_{2}O_{3}$. This work establishes PCM as a versatile and laboratory-accessible technique for three-dimensional, nondestructive characterization of dislocations across entire wide-bandgap semiconductor wafers within a practically acceptable time frame.

Title: High-throughput, Non-Destructive, Three-Dimensional Imaging of GaN Threading Dislocations with in-Plane Burgers Vector Component via Phase-Contrast Microscopy
Authors: Yukari Ishiakwa, Ryo Hattori, Yongzhao Yao, Daiki Katsube, Koji Sato
Abstract: We demonstrate a nondestructive, high-throughput method for observing dislocations in GaN (0001) using phase-contrast microscopy (PCM). The PCM images (359x300 $\mu$m$^2$) analyzed in this study were acquired with an exposure time of 3 ms per image. The one-to-one correspondence between threading dislocation (TD) contrasts in PCM images and the corresponding contrasts in multiphoton excitation photoluminescence (MPPL) images provides clear evidence that PCM can detect TDs with in-plane Burgers vector components. The contrast shape in PCM reflects the inclination of dislocations with respect to the surface normal: dot contrasts correspond to vertical dislocations, whereas line contrasts correspond to inclined dislocations. By shifting the focal plane from the top surface to the back surface, the three-dimensional propagation paths of dislocations can be visualized. The PCM image obtained represents a projection of threading dislocations within a thickness of approximately 43 $\mu$m. Dislocations spaced as close as 1.3 $\mu$m can be individually resolved. In addition, the capability of PCM to detect scratches, subsurface scratches, facet boundaries, and voids was demonstrated. This study establishes PCM as a versatile and laboratory-accessible technique for three-dimensional, nondestructive characterization of dislocations and other defects in wide-bandgap semiconductors.

Title: Control and optimisation of irreversible processes in non-equilibrium systems
Authors: Antonio Patrón Castro
Abstract: This thesis is devoted to the study of physical systems embedded within the field of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. Specifically, the state of the systems of interest constitutes a stochastic process that can be externally driven by a set of controllable parameters. On the one hand, for systems in contact with a thermal bath, we have studied the emergence of strong memory effects and glassy behaviour upon varying the bath temperature, and how these are related to the existence of non-equilibrium attractors governing the dynamics. On the other hand, for overdamped harmonic systems, we have studied the problem of minimising the connection time between arbitrary stationary (either equilibrium or non-equilibrium) states, by suitably varying either the bath temperature or the stiffnesses of the potential.

Title: Stability, electronic disruption, and anisotropic superconductivity of hydrogenated trilayer metal tetraborides (MB$_{4}$H; M=Be, Mg, Ca, Al)
Authors: Jakkapat Seeyangnok, Udomsilp Pinsook, Graeme J. Ackland
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in MgB$_2$ (\(T_c = 39\) K) \cite{nagamatsu2001superconductivity} established metal diborides (MB$_2$) as a promising class of conventional superconductors. Recent advances in fabrication techniques have enabled the synthesis of 2D MgB$_2$ with a \(T_c\) of 36 K \cite{cheng2018fabrication}, reigniting interest in layered metal borides. This has led to predictions of superconductivity in various 2D metal borides, including MB$_4$ (M = Be, Mg, Ca, Al), with CaB$_4$ exhibiting the highest estimated \(T_c\) of 36.1 K. To explore the impact of hydrogenation on superconductivity, we systematically investigate two-dimensional hydrogenated trilayer metal borides (MB$_4$H; M = Be, Mg, Ca, Al). Our results reveal that these materials retain a metallic nature dominated by boron \(p\)-orbitals, while hydrogenation significantly alters their band dispersion and Fermi surface topology. Phonon calculations confirm their dynamical stability and reveal strong electron-phonon interactions, leading to multi-gap superconductivity. Among the studied compounds, MgB$_4$H, AlB$_4$H, and CaB$_4$H exhibit possible two superconducting gaps, with CaB$_4$H showing the strongest electron-phonon coupling, resulting in an intrinsic superconducting transition temperature of 64 K. In contrast, AlB$_4$H shows the weakest coupling, with \(T_c = 22\) K. The calculated electron-phonon coupling constants (\(\lambda\)) range from 0.62 to 0.99, demonstrating the tunability of superconducting properties through elemental substitution. These findings provide valuable insights into superconductivity in hydrogenated metal borides and highlight their potential for high-\(T_c\) applications.

Title: Magnetization plateau and anisotropic magnetoresistance in the frustrated Kondo-lattice compound Ce3ScBi5
Authors: Zhongchen Xu, Yaxian Wang, Cuiwei Zhang, Hongxiong Liu, Xin Han, Liusuo Wu, Xianmin Zhang, Quansheng Wu, Youguo Shi
Abstract: Kondo metals with geometric frustration offer fertile ground for exploring exotic states of matter with a field-induced fractional magnetization platform and nonsaturating magnetoresistance. Herein, a Ce3ScBi5 single crystal with anti-Hf5Sn3Cu hexagonal structure was successfully synthesized via the bismuth self-flux method, leading to the formation of cerium cations arranged in a frustrated structure within a distorted kagome lattice. Magnetic measurements exhibit two distinct antiferromagnetic transitions at 4.1 and 5.9 K. Specifically, the occurrence of multiple metamagnetic transitions between magnetization plateaus is evidenced upon applying magnetic fields perpendicular to the c axis. Transport measurements highlight remarkable Kondo-lattice characteristics and anisotropic magnetoresistance in Ce3ScBi5. The anomalous Hall contributions are observed at low temperatures under critical fields, suggesting Fermi surface reconstruction in a subset of the metamagnetic transitions. We have constructed a temperature-field phase diagram to provide comprehensive information on the complex magnetic structures arising from competitive interactions. Our work establishes Ce3ScBi5 and related materials as a unique platform for exploring low-dimensional quantum fluctuations in bulk crystals, and analyzes the critical role of geometric frustration in Kondo and Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida physical frameworks.

Title: Evidence for spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry at a non-conformal quantum critical point
Authors: R. Flores-Calderón, M. Zündel
Abstract: In this work, we present evidence for the spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry in a nearest-neighbour interacting spin-1 chain tuned to a quantum critical point at $T=0$ between two XY quasi-long-range order phases differing by the spontaneous breaking of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. Despite the one-dimensional nature of the system, which typically prevents such a continuous symmetry breaking due to the Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner theorem, the presence of a Berry phase term in the quantum model allows us to observe, using matrix product state methods, a finite perpendicular magnetization. Moreover, the quasi-long-range decay of the correlation function becomes truly long-range order, and the dynamical structure factor displays a characteristic Bragg peak together with sharp gapless modes. Our results imply the quantum phase transition has an anomalous dimension of $\eta \simeq 1$ together with the dynamical critical exponent $z\simeq 3/2$, known from the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class in one dimension. We perform a perturbative renormalization group calculation about the upper critical dimension $d_c=2$ that we could close at second loop order. We find an interacting fixed point with critical exponents distinct from the Ising ones. Together, our findings suggest the nature of the fixed point to be non-perturbative. We propose a field-theory that we believe to improve the quantitative results.

Title: Stability Frontiers and Mixed-dimensional physics in the Kagome Intermetallics Ln3ScBi5 (Ln = La-Nd, Sm)
Authors: Zhongchen Xu, Wenbo Ma, Shijun Guo, Ziyi Zhang, Quansheng Wu, Xianmin Zhang, Xiuliang Yuan, Youguo Shi
Abstract: Low-dimensional physics provides profound insights into strongly correlated interactions, leading to enhanced quantum effects and the emergence of exotic quantum states. The Ln3ScBi5 family stands out as a chemically versatile kagome platform with mixed low-dimensional structural framework and tunable physical properties. Our research initiates with a comprehensive evaluation of the currently known Ln3ScBi5 (Ln = La-Nd, Sm) materials, providing a robust methodology for assessing their stability frontiers within this system. Focusing on Pr3ScBi5, we investigate the influence of the zigzag chains of quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) motifs and the distorted kagome layers of quasi-two-dimensional (Q2D) networks in the mixed-dimensional structure on the intricate magnetic ground states and unique spin fluctuations. Our study reveals that the noncollinear antiferromagnetic (AFM) moments of Pr3+ ions are confined within the Q2D kagome planes, displaying minimal in-plane anisotropy. In contrast, a strong AFM coupling is observed within the Q1D zigzag chains, significantly constraining spin motion. Notably, the magnetic frustration is partially the consequence of coupling to conduction electrons via the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya Yosida (RKKY) interaction, highlighting a promising framework for future investigations into mixed-dimensional frustration in Ln3ScBi5 systems.

Title: Discovery of a new magnesium iron boride Mg4Fe1.1B13.9 in the Mg-Fe-B-N system
Authors: N.D. Zhigadlo
Abstract: A new boron-rich ternary phase, Mg4Fe1.1B13.9, was discovered in the Mg-Fe-B-N quaternary system. This novel phase appears in the form of plate-like shaped crystals formed on the surface of Fe-substituted MgB2 during high-pressure, high-temperature (HPHT) solution growth at 3 GPa and 1960 C. Mg4Fe1.1B13.9 crystallizes in an orthorhombic structure with space group Pnam (No. 62) and lattice parameters a = 10.95(2) A, b = 7.07(1) A, and c = 8.72(1) A. Structural refinement reveals a layered architecture composed of alternating layers of Mg-Fe and boron, with boron atoms forming 5-, 6-, and 7-membered ring motifs. A structural comparison indicates that Mg4Fe1.1B13.9 is closely related to the Y2ReB6-type borides. This discovery highlights the effectiveness of the HPHT synthesis in accessing new, complex boron-rich phases. As research in the binary Mg-B system approaches saturation, the identification of Mg4Fe1.1B13.9 offers new insights into the formation of phases in the Mg-Fe-B-N system. This paves the way for the guided synthesis of novel borides with unique properties in other multicomponent systems.

Title: Enhanced spectral range of strain-induced tuning of quantum dots in circular Bragg grating cavities
Authors: Ivan Gamov, Matthias Sauter, Samuel Huber, Quirin Buchinger, Peter Gschwandtner, Ulrike Wallrabe, Sven Höfling, Tobias Huber-Loyola
Abstract: Tunable sources of entangled and single photons are essential for implementing entanglement-based quantum information protocols, as quantum teleportation and entanglement swapping depend on photon indistinguishability. Tunable devices are fabricated from indium arsenide (InAs) quantum dots (QDs) embedded in gallium arsenide (GaAs) nanomembranes placed on monolithic piezoelectric substrates. Circular Bragg grating (CBG) resonators enhance emission brightness and exploit the Purcell effect; however, the inclusion of CBGs reduces strain-mediated tunability compared to planar nanomembranes. A simple and effective solution is introduced: filling the CBG trenches with a stiff dielectric (aluminum oxide) via atomic layer deposition (ALD) restores up to 95% of the tunability of planar structures. Finite element analysis (FEA) confirms that the tunability loss originates from bending in the device layers due to strain relief in the CBG geometry. Lowering the stiffness of intermediate layers between the QDs and the piezoelectric actuator, such as in bonding or reflector layers, further increases strain losses in uncoated CBGs. Coated devices maintain 98-99% strain-tuning efficiency across all simulated underlayer stiffnesses. The results demonstrate that advantageous optical cavity properties can be effectively combined with piezoelectric strain tuning, enabling scalable, bright, and tunable quantum light sources.

Title: Measuring irreversibility in stochastic systems by categorizing single-molecule displacements
Authors: Alvaro Lanza, Inés Martínez-Martín, Rafael Tapia-Rojo, Stefano Bo
Abstract: Quantifying the irreversibility and dissipation of non-equilibrium processes is crucial to understanding their behavior, assessing their possible capabilities, and characterizing their efficiency. We introduce a physical quantity that quantifies the irreversibility of stochastic Langevin systems from the observation of individual molecules' displacements. Categorizing these displacements into a few groups based on their initial and final position allows us to measure irreversibility precisely without the need to know the forces and magnitude of the fluctuations acting on the system. Our model-free estimate of irreversibility is related to entropy production by a conditional fluctuation theorem and provides a lower bound to the average entropy production. We validate the method on single-molecule force spectroscopy experiments of proteins subject to force ramps. We show that irreversibility is sensitive to detailed features of the energy landscape underlying the protein folding dynamics and suggest how our methods can be employed to unveil key properties of protein folding processes.

Title: Mean-field theory of the DNLS equation at positive and negative absolute temperatures
Authors: Michele Giusfredi, Stefano Iubini, Antonio Politi, Paolo Politi
Abstract: The Discrete Non Linear Schrödinger (DNLS) model, due to the existence of two conserved quantities, displays an equilibrium transition between a homogeneous phase at positive absolute temperature and a localized phase at negative absolute temperature. Here, we provide a mean-field theory of DNLS and show that this approximation is semi-quantitatively correct in the whole phase diagram, becoming exact in proximity of the transition. Our mean-field theory shows that the passage from stable positive-temperature to metastable negative-temperature states is smooth.

Title: Determining extended Markov parameterizations for vector-valued generalized Langevin Equations
Authors: Niklas Bockius, Maximilian Braun, Kay Hofmann, Friederike Schmid, Martin Hanke
Abstract: The generalized Langevin equation is used as a model for various coarse-grained physical processes, e.g., the time evolution of the velocity of a given larger particle in an implicitly represented solvent, when the relevant time scales of the dynamics of the larger particle and the solvent particles are not strictly separated. Since this equation involves an integrated history of past velocities, considerable efforts have been made to approximate this dynamics by data-driven Markov models, where auxiliary variables are used to compensate for the memory term. In recent works we have developed two algorithms which can be used for this purpose, provided the dynamics in question are scalar processes. Here we extend these algorithms to vector-valued processes. As a physical test bed we consider an S-shaped particle sliding on a planar substrate, which gives rise to a truly two-dimensional velocity process. The two algorithms provide Markov approximations of this process with 10-20 auxiliary variables and a very accurate fit of the given autocorrelation data over the entire time interval where these data are non-negligible.

Title: First-principles evidence for conventional superconductivity in a quasicrystal approximant
Authors: Pedro N. Ferreira, Roman Lucrezi, Sangmin Lee, Lucy Nathwani, Matthew Julian, Rohit P. Prasankumar, Warren E. Pickett, Chris J. Pickard, Philip Kim, Christoph Heil
Abstract: Quasicrystals (QCs) host long-range order without translational symmetry, a regime in which the very foundations of BCS theory are not straightforwardly applicable, yet experiments on QCs and their approximant crystals (ACs) point to conventional, $s$-wave, electron-phonon coupled superconductivity. With this work we directly address this seeming contradiction from first principles. Using state-of-the-art \textit{ab initio} methods, we compute the superconducting properties of the recently discovered AC Al$_{13}$Os$_4$ and quantitatively reproduce its bulk $T_\text{c}$. This constitutes, to our knowledge, the first \emph{ab initio} determination of $T_\text{c}$ for an AC and establishes that the electron-phonon framework is predictive in these systems as well. Using the generalized quasichemical approximation for alloy modeling in the decagonal Al-Os family, we predict tunable superconductivity in Al$_{13}$Os$_{4-x}$Re$_x$ and Al$_{13}$Os$_{4-x}$Ir$_x$; in particular, Al$_{13}$Re$_4$ is dynamically stable and estimated to have a $T_\text{c}$ about 30% above Al$_{13}$Os$_4$. Finally, we argue that $T_\text{c}$ obtained for ACs provides practical bounds for the $T_\text{c}$ of their parent QCs, suggesting that the quasicrystalline counterparts of Al$_{13}$Os$_4$ and Al$_{13}$Re$_4$ could harbor the highest $T_\text{c}$ among QCs yet.

Title: Discontinuous transition in explosive percolation via local suppression
Authors: Young Sul Cho
Abstract: We study an explosive percolation model in which a link is randomly added and neighboring nodes sequentially rewire their links to suppress the growth of large clusters. In this manner, the rewiring nodes spread outward starting from the initial node closest to the added link. We show that a discontinuous transition emerges even when the total number of rewiring nodes after each link addition is finite. This finding implies that adding a link using the information of the cluster sizes attached to a finite set of link candidates (local information) can lead to a discontinuous transition if link rewiring is allowed. This result thus extends the previous result that a discontinuous transition arises only when a link is added using the information of the cluster sizes attached to an infinite number of link candidates (global information) in the absence of rewiring.

Title: Assessing Band Gap Stability of Organic Semiconductor Thin Films for Flexible Electronic Applications
Authors: Mahya Ghorab, Ayush K. Ranga, Arnulf Materny, Veit Wagner, Mojtaba Joodaki
Abstract: Integration of organic semiconductors into flexible electronics requires that their optoelectronic properties remain stable under mechanical deformation. Among these, the optical band gap governs exciton generation and limits photovoltaic voltage, making it a key parameter for strain-resilient design. In this work, we investigate band gap shifts in poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/P3HT thin films deposited on flexible poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) substrates under uniaxial tensile strain ranging from 1\% to 10\%. Samples were subjected to mechanical deformation and then characterized by ultraviolet--visible (UV--Vis) absorption spectroscopy. The optical band gaps extracted using a standardized Tauc analysis and statistically validated through equivalence testing and robust regression models. We find that up to 7\% strain, the band gap shift ($\Delta E_g$) remains effectively invariant, independent of annealing condition or stack configuration, demonstrating electronic stability. However, at 10\% strain, all groups exhibit a reproducible widening of $\sim$4--5~meV. This threshold-like behavior marks a transition from mechanical accommodation to electronic perturbation. These findings confirm that the optical band gap in semicrystalline P3HT-based thin films is robust under practical deformation, which provides clear strain thresholds to inform mechanical modeling and device-level simulation of flexible organic optoelectronic systems.

Title: Phase transformations in metastable $β$ Zr15Nb alloy revealed by in-situ methods
Authors: Anna Veverková, Kristína Bartha, Jozef Veselý, Pere Barriobero-Vila, Jiří Kozlík, Petr Doležal, Jiří Pospíšil, Jana Šmilauerová, Josef Stráský
Abstract: This study examines the phase transitions occurring during linear heating of the Zr15Nb alloy through a comprehensive, multi-technique methodology comprising in-situ high-energy synchrotron X-ray diffraction (HEXRD), electrical resistance measurements, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and thermal expansion analysis, supplemented by ex-situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The findings reveal a complex sequence of phase transformations and corresponding structural changes over a broad temperature range (from room temperature up to 800 $°$C). Two distinct body-centered cubic (bcc) $\beta$ phases - $\beta_{Zr}$ and $\beta_{Nb}$ - with closely related lattice parameters are identified. At room temperature, the microstructure is characterized by a mixture of the metastable $\beta_{Zr}$ + $\omega_{ath}$ phase. Upon heating, $\beta_{Zr}$ progressively decomposes, giving rise to the formation of $\beta_{Nb}$. TEM observation revealed the cuboidal shape of the $\omega_{iso}$ particles resulting from the high lattice misfit between $\beta$ and $\omega$ phase. The $\omega$ solvus temperature is determined to be approximately 555 $°$C, as evidenced by in situ HEXRD and abrupt changes in the alloy's thermal and electrical properties. The growth of the $\alpha$ phase occurs after the dissolution of the $\omega$ phase, resulting in a pronounced increase in thermal expansion.

Title: Hydrogen permeability prediction in palladium alloys and virtual screening of B2-phase stabilized Pd(100-x-y)CuxMy ternary alloys using machine learning
Authors: Eric Kolor, Edoardo Magnone, Muhammad Harussani Moklis, Md. Rubel, Sasipa Boonyubol, Koichi Mikami, Jeffrey S. Cross
Abstract: We present a forward prediction material screening framework designed to discover Pd-Cu alloys with improved B2 phase stability, thereby unlocking simultaneous $H_2$ generation and utilization. First, we trained CatBoost models with literature-derived Pd alloy data to predict $H_2$ permeability from composition and testing conditions. We evaluated fractional, composition-based, and physics-informed descriptors, individually and in combination, and showed that sequential Pearson filtering and fold-wise SHAP-based recursive feature elimination with cross-fold aggregation reduced errors while controlling complexity. Guided by the one-SE rule, a narrower domain-informed set of 13 features provided the best accuracy parsimony trade-off ($R^2=0.81$), only 0.01 below the max. $R^2$ achievable with 3x the number of features. SHAP analysis indicated that high permeability is promoted by elevated temperature, lattice expansion relative to Pd, atomic size mismatch, and favorable mixing tendencies. Second, the selected model was applied to screen $Pd_{(100-x-y)}Cu_{x}M_{y}$ spanning 16 co-dopants M for B2 stabilization. For each M system, we obtained the Pareto set of compositions that minimize Pd content and Miedema heat of formation and maximize the permeability, then picked three compounds, including that with the highest predicted permeability, the lowest Miedema heat of formation, and the lowest Pd content. With a final filter considering M concentration for single-phase Pd-M solution formation, we recommend Pd48.48Cu43.00Y8.52, Pd49.08Cu42.45Sc8.47, Pd56.09Cu33.70La10.21, and Pd52.68Cu40.44Mg6.88 for experimental validation. We predict those alloys to exhibit permeabilities 1.7 to 1.9 higher than B2 Pd60Cu40. Our framework provides plausible experimental targets and a scalable pathway for designing stable, high-temperature, H2-selective Pd-alloy membranes.

Title: Dynamical Orbital Angular Momentum Induced by Chiral Phonons
Authors: Dapeng Yao, Dongwook Go, Yuriy Mokrousov, Shuichi Murakami
Abstract: We show that the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of electrons is dynamically induced by chiral phonons. The induced OAM originates from the adiabatic evolution in which electrons dynamically acquire Berry phase. By introducing a tight-binding model with p orbitals on a honeycomb lattice, we show a microscopic picture that chiral phonons modulate orbital overlaps of electrons, and calculate the generated OAM, whose sign depends on phonon chirality. We then construct an effective model for valley phonons with different phonon pseudoangular momenta (PAM) and identity their distinct intervalley-scattering channels. Our model obeys the selection rule between phonons and electrons with the orbital degree of freedom. Extending this framework to d-orbital electrons, our model is applied to describe the induced OAM in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides. Our results reveal a direct lattice-OAM transfer mechanism that emerges even in materials with weak spin-orbital coupling, opening a new promising way for orbitronics applications.

Title: Quantum-droplet interferometry
Authors: Sriganapathy Raghav, Boris Malomed, Utpal Roy
Abstract: We propose atom interferometers based on quantum droplet (QD), which is also being reported as a superior platform for interferometry. The emphasis has been given to harmonic-oscillator (HO) or ring-shaped potentials. In the HO trap, a Gaussian barrier induces coherent splitting; in the ring, one or two barriers guide the splitting and subsequent recombination. The atom number and relative mean-field interaction strength critically affect the interferometric performance. The transmission-coefficient analysis identifies values of the barrier parameters for the balanced $50:50$ splitting. The post-recombination atom-number imbalance serves as a sensitive indicator of the relative phase between merging daughter QDs. We demonstrate that the HO-based setup may serve as a tilt-meter and target detector, and the ring geometry may be used as a compact QD Sagnac interferometer for rotation sensing.

Title: Infinite-component $BF$ field theory: Nexus of fracton order, Toeplitz braiding, and non-Hermitian amplification
Authors: Bo-Xi Li, Peng Ye
Abstract: Building on the recent study of Toeplitz braiding by Li et al. [Phys. Rev. B 110, 205108 (2024)], we introduce \textit{infinite-component} $BF$ (i$BF$) theories by stacking topological $BF$ theories along a fourth ($w$) spatial direction and coupling them in a translationally invariant manner. The i$BF$ framework captures the low-energy physics of 4D fracton topological orders in which both particle and loop excitations exhibit restricted mobility along the stacking direction, and their particle-loop braiding statistics are encoded in asymmetric, integer-valued Toeplitz $K$ matrices. We identify a novel form of particle-loop braiding, termed \textit{Toeplitz braiding}, originating from boundary zero singular modes (ZSMs) of the $K$ matrix. In the thermodynamic limit, nontrivial braiding phases persist even when the particle and loop reside on opposite 3D boundaries, as the boundary ZSMs dominate the nonvanishing off-diagonal elements of $K^{-1}$ and govern boundary-driven braiding behavior. Analytical and numerical studies of i$BF$ theories with Hatano-Nelson-type and non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-type Toeplitz $K$ matrices confirm the correspondence between ZSMs and Toeplitz braiding. The i$BF$ construction thus forges a bridge between strongly correlated topological field theory and noninteracting non-Hermitian physics, where ZSMs underlie the non-Hermitian amplification effect. Possible extensions include 3-loop and Borromean-rings Toeplitz braiding induced by twisted topological terms, generalized entanglement renormalization, and foliation structures within i$BF$ theories. An intriguing analogy to the scenario of parallel universes is also briefly discussed.

Title: Dynamic structure factor of a monatomic cubic crystal
Authors: Arsene Yerle, Pierre Gaspard, Joel Mabillard
Abstract: The spectral function of density fluctuations, also known as the dynamic structure factor, of a monatomic cubic crystal with vacancies is derived from the macroscopic equations describing transport in crystalline solids. The resonances of the spectral function are identified as a Brillouin doublet of sound propagation, a central Rayleigh peak of heat diffusion, as for perfect crystals, and another central sharp peak associated with vacancy diffusion. Analytical expressions for the heat and vacancy diffusivities, speeds of sound, and sound damping coefficients are obtained. The theoretical results are compared to molecular dynamics simulations of a face-centered cubic crystal of hard spheres.

Abstract: Laser-generated surface acoustic waves (SAW) facilitate an efficient information processing in modern spintronics and magnonics. The ability to tune SAW parameters is crucial to achieve an acoustic control over magnonic properties. Such tunability can be achieved in phase-changing magnetic materials accommodating both spin waves and SAWs. A promising material is FeRh alloy, a metallic antiferromagnet at room temperature undergoing a phase transition into ferromagnetic state accompanied by a crystal lattice expansion at 370 K. This transition can also be induced by femtosecond laser pulses. In this paper we use the phase transition in 60 nm Fe49Rh51 film to optically generate pulses of Gigahertz quasi-Rayleigh SAWs. We detect them via photoelastic effect and show that the lattice transformation during phase transition is a dominant strain-generation mechanism for above-threshold excitation. The weight of this contribution rises as the sample is heated closer to AFM-FM transition temperature and 'switches off' when heated above it allowing to control the SAW amplitude. A model based on thermodynamical parameters of Fe49Rh51 shows that the lattice transformation occurring within 95 ps effectively contributes to SAW generation happening at a comparable timescale, while non-equilibrium fast kinetics of the phase transition does not.

Abstract: The specific heat of expanded graphite (EG) and EG--multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) composites (1.0 and 3.0 wt.\% MWCNTs) was measured between 2 and 300~K. The low-temperature heat capacity is dominated by out-of-plane flexural phonons with quadratic dispersion, characteristic of two-dimensional layered systems. Compared with crystalline graphite, EG exhibits enhanced heat capacity due to increased defect density and reduced interlayer coupling. Structural characterization (XRD, Raman, EDS) confirmed variations in stacking order and defect concentration. The data were fitted using a three-term model ($C_{1}T + C_{3}T^{3} + C_{5}T^{5}$), where the negative $C_{5}$ term indicates quadratic phonon dispersion. The results demonstrate the influence of MWCNT integration and structural disorder on phonon dynamics and anisotropic heat capacity in EG-based composites.

Title: Broadband Dielectric and THz Spectroscopy on Bio-Related Matter: Water, Amino Acids, Proteins, and Blood
Authors: Peter Lunkenheimer, Sebastian Emmert, Martin Wolf, Alois Loidl
Abstract: In the present work, we examine the relevance and proper interpretation of broadband-dielectric and THz-spectroscopy data for the investigation of various types of biological matter. We provide an overview of the rich variety of different dynamic processes that can be detected by these experimental methods. Several experimental examples are discussed in detail, helping to understand the information that can be drawn from such studies. This includes dielectric spectra, extending well into the GHz region, for pure water, which can be considered as a simple but highly important biological molecule. We also discuss results for a prototypical aqueous solution of a protein, belonging to one of the most important classes of biological macromolecules. Moreover, we examine broadband dielectric spectra on blood as an example of functional biological matter in organisms. To demonstrate the relevance of THz spectroscopy for the investigation of biological molecules, we finally treat such experiments applied to different amino acids.

Title: Interface tuned Enhanced and Low Temperature Quenching of Orbital Hall Currents Induce Torque and magnetoresistance in Light Metal/Nickel Bilayers
Authors: Dhananjaya Mahapatra, Harekrishna Bhunia, Manu S Pattelath, Partha Mitra
Abstract: We investigate orbital current induced effects arising from the orbital Hall effect in light-metal/ferromagnet bilayers. Thin films of Ti in ohmic contact with Ni were studied using second-harmonic longitudinal and transverse voltage measurements under an applied a.c. current. From these signals, we extract the orbital Hall torque (OHT) efficiency and the unidirectional orbital magnetoresistance (UOMR). Insertion of a Cu interlayer between the Ni/Ti interface leads to an enhancement of both OHT efficiency and UOMR compared to both Ni/Ti and Ni/Cu bilayers. Furthermore, systematic variation of Ti thickness reveals that both OHT efficiency and UOMR increase with increasing Ti thickness, indicating that the observed phenomena predominantly originate from the bulk orbital Hall effect rather than purely from interfacial mechanisms and Lowering the temperature leads to a clear reduction in both the orbital Hall torque (OHT) efficiency and the unidirectional orbital magnetoresistance (UOMR). The nearly linear and correlated temperature dependence of both parameters suggests a common underlying mechanism, namely, the orbital Hall effect in the light-metal layer, which governs both the generation of orbital current and its subsequent influence on the ferromagnet through orbital torque and orbital magnetoresistance.

Title: Probing the Critical Behavior of a Sign-Problematic Model with Monte Carlo Simulations
Authors: Ye Ling, Yuting Wang, Wenan Guo, Yhhai Liu
Abstract: The sign-problematic generalized Baxter-Wu (GBW) model with asymmetric complex couplings is mapped onto a one-dimensional quantum model. Utilizing the model's exactly known critical properties, we study the relation between the conventional and the modified average signs and the phase transitions in the GBW model. We find that the average sign develops a negative peak near the critical point, but it is not a unique indicator of phase transition, as similar features can appear in non-critical regions. While the average modified sign provides a viable probe for the phase transition, the practical effectiveness of this method is limited by the exponential scaling of computational cost with the system's volume. We propose that the universal properties of the original model can be investigated through simulating the related reference model, based on the universality assumption. Using finite-size scaling analysis based on Monte Carlo simulations, we confirm the validity of this method, which thereby provides a novel framework for investigating phase transitions in systems plagued by the sign problem.

Title: Emergent long-tail dynamics in driven magnets with dynamical frustration
Authors: Chenyue Guo, Hongzheng Zhao, Zi Cai
Abstract: In this study, we show that dynamical frustration can spontaneously emerge in frustration-free magnetic systems under periodic driving. Specifically, we consider a classical spin system and demonstrate the emergence of spin-ice physics when drive-induced heating is well suppressed. In particular, we focus on the dynamics of magnetic monopole excitations, which, in sharp contrast to their equilibrium counterparts, exhibit a non-ergodic stochastic random-walk process with long-tailed, power-law distributed waiting times, where the power-law exponent is tunable by the system's effective temperature. Heating is accelerated at intermediate driving frequencies, and the system eventually heats up to an infinite-temperature state. However, the heating time is extremely sensitive to different initial-state realizations and also follows a long-tailed power-law distribution. We show that a drive-induced short-range attractive interaction between monopoles is responsible for the long-tailed distributions observed in both monopole and heating dynamics.

Title: The parent state in kagome metals and superconductors: Chiral-nematic Fermi liquid state
Authors: Zihao Huang, Hengxing Tan, Zhen Zhao, Zhan Wang, Chengmin Shen, Haitao Yang, Bent Weber, Binghai Yan, Hui Chen, Ziqiang Wang, Hong-Jun Gao
Abstract: The kagome metals and superconductors hosting rich correlated and topological electronic states have captivated quantum materials research. These states are triggered by an unconventional chiral charge density wave (CDW) wherein a chiral superconductivity emerges at low temperatures, yet the origin of this chiral CDW order, the parent state, is unresolved. Here, we report the discovery of a parent chiral-nematic Fermi liquid state in kagome metals and superconductors. We use spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy to study Ti-doped CsV3Sb5 where the CDW is suppressed, and find that multiorbital Fermi surfaces break all mirror reflections and exhibit handedness. We observe the chiral low-energy quasiparticle dispersions, providing direct evidence for a chiral-nematic electronic structure. We further observe the direct transition from the parent state to a chiral-nematic superconducting state. Moreover, in the samples with chiral CDW, we also observe the residual chiral-nematic QPI features, demonstrating that the CDW-triggered exotic states descend from the chiral-nematic Fermi liquid. Our findings not only provide a plausible chiral-nematic parent state, but also establish a new conceptual framework for exploring the emergence and consequences of such exotic quantum phases.

Title: A scalable kinetic Monte Carlo platform enabling comprehensive simulations of charge transport dynamics in polymer-based memristive systems
Authors: Gerliz M. Gutiérrez-Finol, Kirill Zinovjev, Alejandro Gaita-Ariño, Salvador Cardona-Serra
Abstract: Polymer-assisted ion transport underpins both energy storage technologies and emerging neuromorphic computing devices. Efficient modeling of ion migration is essential for understanding the performance of batteries and memristors, but it remains challenging because of the interplay of drift, diffusion, and electrostatic interactions, as well as the limitations of continuum and molecular dynamics approaches. Addressing these challenges is particularly relevant in the context of the climate and energy crisis, where high-performance, low-carbon technologies require optimized ion-conducting materials and devices. Here, we introduce a scalable and flexible stochastic simulation platform that uses Markov chain Monte Carlo methodology to model ion migration in solid-state systems. The platform employs a vectorized, rail-based representation of device geometry, enabling rapid simulation of lateral ion transport and space-charge effects while preserving the stochastic nature of hopping events. It accommodates a wide range of material systems and can integrate experimental input parameters without code modification. We also provide an implementation of the model that takes advantage of highly energy-efficient GPUs, improving the performance and reducing the carbon footprint of the simulations. Validation using polymer-based memristive devices demonstrates the simulator's ability to capture key behaviors, including relaxation decay, current-voltage hysteresis, spike-timing-dependent plasticity, and learning/forgetting rates. By balancing computational efficiency with mesoscale physical considerations, the platform provides a versatile tool for exploring ion-driven phenomena in energy storage and neuromorphic devices, supporting exploratory research.

Title: Analytical Analysis of the Conformational and Rheological Properties of Flexible Active Polar Linear Polymers under Shear Flow
Authors: Arindam Panda, Sunil P Singh, Roland G. Winkler
Abstract: The conformational and rheological properties of active polar linear polymers (APLPs) under linear shear flow are studied analytically. We describe a discrete APLP as an inextensible flexible Gaussian bead-spring chain supplemented by active forces along the bonds. The linear, non-Hermitian equations of motion are solved by an eigenfunction expansion in terms of a biorthogonal basis set. The model reveals an intimate coupling between activity and shear flow, which implies activity-enhanced polymer conformational and rheological properties. Compared to a passive polymer, we find a significantly enhanced shrinkage transverse to the flow direction with increasing shear rate, with a power-law exponent $-4/3$, compared to the passive values of $-2/3$. This conformational change is tightly linked with a strongly amplified shear-thinning behavior, where the shear viscosity exhibits the same power law. The characteristic shear rate for the onset of these effects is determined by the activity. In the asymptotic limit of large activities, the shear-induced features become independent of activity and equal to those of passive polymers.

Abstract: Near-surface divacancy defects in cubic silicon carbide exhibit modified properties due to surface-induced symmetry breaking, as revealed by our first-principles calculations. The spin Hamiltonian is modulated by the defect's depth and orientation, providing key insights for engineering robust SiC-based quantum devices and nanoscale sensors.

Title: Spatio-temporal dynamics of surfactant driven secondary invasion in Gaussian pore networks
Authors: Debanik Bhattacharjee, Guy Z. Ramon, Yaniv Edery
Abstract: Capillarity-dominated two-phase displacement in porous media often continues beyond the initial invasion-percolation (IP) breakthrough, as surfactants alter interfacial properties and reopen pathways once sealed by capillary forces. This study examines such secondary invasion, where adsorption-driven reductions in interfacial tension and contact-angle shifts lower entry thresholds in yet uninvaded throats, enabling further displacement at a fixed inlet pressure. To capture this process, we employ a time-dependent pore-network framework that couples IP with a reduced-order transport-adsorption module. Local fluxes are governed by Poiseuille flow, interfacial adsorption follows a Langmuir isotherm, and wettability evolution is modeled through a calibrated phenomenological relation. Heterogeneity is prescribed by Gaussian throat-size distributions whose variance controls structural disorder. The resulting invasion trajectories are sigmoidal, consistent with Gaussian cumulative statistics, indicating that surfactant mass-transfer kinetics and network variance primarily rescale invasion timescales while preserving the overall functional form. The framework thus connects interfacial conditioning to time-varying capillary thresholds and reveals how surfactant-mediated processes govern post-breakthrough dynamics in heterogeneous porous systems.

Title: Spatial and Temporal Cluster Tomography of Active Matter
Authors: Leone V. Luzzatto, Mathias Casiulis, Stefano Martiniani, István A. Kovács
Abstract: Critical phase transitions have proven to be a powerful concept to capture the phenomenology of many systems, including deeply non-equilibrium ones like living systems. The study of these phase transitions has overwhelmingly relied on two-point correlation functions. In this Letter, we show that cluster tomography -- the study of one-dimensional cross-sections of the clusters that emerge near a phase transition -- is an alternative higher-order tool that efficiently locates and characterizes phase transitions in active systems. First, using motility-induced phase separation as a paradigmatic example, we show how complex geometric features of clusters, captured by spatial cluster tomography, can be used to measure critical exponents in active systems without explicitly introducing system-specific order parameters. Second, we introduce temporal cluster tomography, an analogous cluster-based measurement that characterizes the dynamical behavior of active systems. We show that cluster dynamics can be captured by a generalization of burstiness analysis in complex temporal networks. Both spatial and temporal cluster tomography are easy to implement yet powerful approaches to study non-equilibrium systems, making them useful additions to the standard toolbox of statistical physics.

Title: Impact of Electron Correlations on Infinite-Layer Cuprates and Nickelates
Authors: Xunyang Hong, Yuetong Wu, Ying Chan, Sze Tung Li, I. Biało, L. Martinelli, A. Drewanowski, Qiang Gao, Xiaolin Ren, Xingjiang Zhou, Zhihai Zhu, A. Galdi, D. G. Schlom, K. M. Shen, J. Choi, M. Garcia Fernandez, Ke-Jin Zhou, N. B. Brookes, H. M. Rønnow, Qisi Wang, J. Chang
Abstract: Optimization of unconventional superconductivity involves a balance of interaction strengths. Precise determination of correlation strength across different material families is therefore important. Here, we present a combined X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) study of infinite-layer PrNiO$_2$ and SrCuO$_2$ that enables fair comparison of their interaction strengths. For both compounds, we study the orbital and magnetic excitations and extract their dispersions along high-symmetry directions. Using a single-band Hubbard model and including higher-order exchange interactions, we derive the correlation factor $U/t$ for both compounds. A key finding is that despite a smaller Coulomb repulsion $U$, PrNiO$_2$ exhibits a correlation strength that is 20% stronger than that of its isostructural cuprate counterpart SrCuO$_2$. This indicates that a moderation of the correlation strength may further optimize superconductivity in nickelates.

Title: Finite size scaling and edge effects in the Takayasu model of aggregation diffusion with input
Authors: Rohan Banerjee Ravindran, R. Rajesh
Abstract: We analytically and numerically study the effect of finite spatial boundaries on the Takayasu model of diffusing and aggregating particles with steady monomer input in one dimension. Exact expressions are derived for the steady-state density profile, two-point correlation functions, and mean-squared density under both open and periodic boundary conditions. The single-site mass distribution exhibits a crossover from a bulk power law $P(m)\sim m^{-4/3}$ to an edge power law $P(m)\sim m^{-5/3}$, occurring near the boundaries or the condensate that forms in periodic systems. The equivalence between the two boundary conditions is shown to break down in the case of multipoint probability distributions near the edge. The exact solution identifies a distinct boundary layer and shows that the edge anomaly arises when spatial mass currents, which scale as $\mathcal{O}(L)$, dominate over the $\mathcal{O}(1)$ constant flux in mass space. We further generalize these results to mass-dependent diffusion.

Title: Dynamic Permeability in Metastable Droplet Interfacial Bilayers
Authors: Nivedina A. Sarma, David A. King, Xuefei Wu, Brett A. Helms, Paul D. Ashby, Thomas P. Russell, Ahmad K. Omar
Abstract: Membrane pores are implicated in several critical functions, including cell fusion and the transport of signaling molecules for intercellular communication. However, these structural features are often difficult to probe directly. Droplet interfacial bilayers offer a synthetic platform to study such membrane properties. We develop a theory that links size-selective transport across a metastable membrane with its transient structural properties. The central quantity of our theory is a dynamic permeability that depends on the mechanism of pore growth, which controls the transient distribution of pore sizes in the membrane. We present a mechanical perspective to derive pore growth dynamics and the resulting size distribution for growth \textit{via} Ostwald ripening and discuss how these dynamics compare to other growth mechanisms such as coalescence and growth through surfactant desorption. We find scaling relations between the transported particle size, the pore growth rate, and the time for a given fraction of particles to cross the membrane, from which one may deduce the dominant mechanism of pore growth, as well as material properties and structural features of the membrane. Finally, we suggest experiments using droplet interfacial bilayers to validate our theoretical predictions.

Title: Spin and orbital-to-charge conversion in noncentrosymmetric materials: Hall versus Rashba-Edelstein effects
Authors: Diego Garcia Ovalle, Aurelien Manchon
Abstract: We investigate spin- and orbital-to-charge conversion phenomena in nonmagnetic materials with broken inversion symmetry, treating the contributions from the Hall effect and the Rashba-Edelstein effect on an equal footing. We develop a general formalism for this interconversion based solely on macroscopic observables. The theory is validated through a case study of ferroelectric GeTe, where we find that the effective Rashba parameter obtained is smaller than previously reported values for the same material. Incorporating these parameters into a drift-diffusion model, we show that the generated charge current is primarily governed by the Rashba-Edelstein effect, rather than by the spin or orbital Hall effects. Our work redefines the spin- and orbit-to-charge interconversion coefficients in terms of directly measurable observables, encouraging the community to revisit these processes in other quantum materials lacking inversion symmetry.

Title: Force-induced Elastic Softening and Conformational Transitions in a Polyampholyte Chain
Authors: Rakesh Palariya, Sunil P. Singh
Abstract: The mechanical response of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and polyampholyte (PA) chains is vital for understanding their biological functions and designing functional materials. We investigate the force-extension behavior of a PA chain with distinct charge sequences using molecular dynamics simulations and a theoretical approach based on the generalized random-phase approximation (GRPA). A diblock PA chain under extensional force undergoes a continuous coil-to-stretch transition at weak electrostatic coupling, which sharpens into a globule-coil-like transition at stronger coupling. The GRPA theory quantitatively captures these behaviors, including the sharp conformational transition and its dependence on electrostatic strength. Simulations reveal pronounced hysteresis during the force-extension and relaxation processes. Additionally, the elastic modulus exhibits four regimes: an initial plateau, stress stiffening, an exponential stress-softening behavior, and a stress stiffening regime. Using the theoretical model and structural input of the PA chain, we have demonstrated that the elastic modulus in the elastic softening regime decreases exponentially, $E\sim \exp(-\alpha_0 f/\Gamma_e)$, as a function of $f$, which aligns with the simulation results. The elastic response of the PA chain is further examined across different charge sequences, where both elastic softening and sharp transitions are absent at smaller block lengths. Finally, coarse-grained models of IDPs such as LAF-1 and DDX4 exhibit similar nonlinear elasticity, highlighting the universality of these mechanisms. Our results establish a fundamental link between electrostatic correlations, charge sequence, and nonlinear elasticity, bridging molecular interactions and macroscopic mechanics.

Title: Photo-Switchable Cross-Linking in Polymer Gels: Effects on Surface Creasing and Network Relaxation during Swelling
Authors: Alyssa VanZanten, Surbhi Punhani-Schillinger, M. Reed Blocksome, Aditya Ketkar, Shih-Yuan Chen, Michelle M. Driscoll, Robert C. Ferrier Jr., Caroline R. Szczepanski
Abstract: Polymer gels with photo-responsive cross-links enable tunable mechanics and surface morphologies, making them promising for adaptive materials. While prior work on coumarin cross-linked gels has focused on photo-mediated events in dilute solution, their network-level mechanical responses remain unclear. Here, we design PEG hydrogels with both permanent covalent and dynamic coumarin cross-links, allowing in situ modulation of cross-linking under wavelength specific UV light. Real-time FTIR and dynamic mechanical analysis show that post-cure 365 nm irradiation drives rapid dimerization, increasing storage modulus by up to 69\%, whereas cleavage of coumarin cross-links via 254 nm post-cure irradiation has a more limited effect due to attenuation in bulk samples. Surface imaging reveals that dynamic cross-linking governs swelling-induced crease formation and evolution. Together, these results establish design principles for hydrogels with programmable mechanics and adaptive surface topographies, advancing application in smart coatings, actuators, and responsive biomaterials.

Title: Role of Wadsley Defects and Cation Disorder to Enhance MoNb12O33 Diffusion
Authors: CJ Sturgill, Manish Kumar, Nima Karimitari, Iva Milisavljevic, Coby S. Collins, Aaron Hegler, Hsin-Yun Joy Chao, Santosh Kiran Balijepalli, Scott Misture, Christopher Sutton, Morgan Stefik
Abstract: Wadsley-Roth (WR) niobates have emerged as high-rate anode materials that can combine rapid ionic diffusion with good electronic conductivity. WR compounds have been defect-enhanced by limited annealing, however, such materials often contain multiple types of defects. In particular, both Wadsley defects (variable block size) and transition metal disorder have the potential to modify transport rates, however the corresponding effects are not well understood mechanistically. Here, MoNb12O33 (MNO) was calcined at two different temperatures to compare a defect-rich condition (MNO-800) with a proximal order-rich condition (MNO-900) as assessed through XRD, XANES, EXAFS, and STEM characterizations. Galvanostatically cycled lithium half cells of MNO-800 exhibited additional capacity (307 mAh/g at 0.1C, 4.66% higher) and improved high- rate capacity of 200 mAhg-1 at 10C. ICI-based overpotential analysis identified solid state diffusion as the dominant rate limiting process where MNO-800 correspondingly exhibited ~3X faster capacity-weighted diffusivity. A machine-learning interatomic potential was trained to density functional theory and then applied with molecular dynamics (MLIP-MD) to examine the possible roles of Wadsley defects and transition metal disorder. For both defect-types, Li was found to populate and activate fast diffusion paths from window sites at lower extents of lithiation as compared to the order-rich model.

Title: Typicality of thermal states in isolated quantum systems corresponds to ubiquity of global minima in deep artificial neural networks
Authors: Takaaki Monnai
Abstract: The Neural Tangent Kernel theory theoretically guarantees the existence of a global minima of the cost function in the neighborhood of an arbitrary random initialization in deep artificial neural networks. In this paper, we show that the ubiquity of the global minima directly corresponds to the typicality of pure thermal states in isolated quantum systems by showing a common underlying mechanism, involving a few observables and the role of a Wishart-type matrix. Moreover, we demonstrate that the increase in distinguishability of the reduced density matrices of typical pure states with subsystem size corresponds to the double descent phenomenon observed by varying the width of layers in finite-width artificial neural networks.

Title: Accelerating two-dimensional tensor network optimization by preconditioning
Authors: Xing-Yu Zhang, Qi Yang, Philippe Corboz, Jutho Haegeman, Wei Tang
Abstract: We revisit gradient-based optimization for infinite projected entangled pair states (iPEPS), a tensor network ansatz for simulating many-body quantum systems. This approach is hindered by two major challenges: the high computational cost of evaluating energies and gradients, and an ill-conditioned optimization landscape that slows convergence. To reduce the number of optimization steps, we introduce an efficient preconditioner derived from the leading term of the metric tensor. We benchmark our method against standard optimization techniques on the Heisenberg and Kitaev models, demonstrating substantial improvements in overall computational efficiency. Our approach is broadly applicable across various contraction schemes, unit cell sizes, and Hamiltonians, highlighting the potential of preconditioned optimization to advance tensor network algorithms for strongly correlated systems.

Title: Probing the features of electron dispersion by tunneling between slightly twisted bilayer graphene sheets
Authors: Alexey A. Sokolik, Azat F. Aminov, Evgenii E. Vdovin, Yurii N. Khanin, Mikhail A. Kashchenko, Denis A. Bandurin, Davit A. Ghazaryan, Sergey V. Morozov, Kostya S. Novoselov
Abstract: Tunneling conductance between two bilayer graphene (BLG) sheets separated by 2 nm-thick insulating barrier was measured in two devices with the twist angles between BLGs less than 1°. At small bias voltages, the tunneling occurs with conservation of energy and momentum at the points of intersection between two relatively shifted Fermi circles. Here, we experimentally found and theoretically described signatures of electron-hole asymmetric band structure of BLG: since holes are heavier, the tunneling conductance is enhanced at the hole doping due to the higher density of states. Another key feature of BLG that we explore is gap opening in a vertical electric field with a strong polarization of electron wave function at van Hove singularities near the gap edges. This polarization, by shifting electron wave function in one BLG closer to or father from the other BLG, gives rise to asymmetric tunneling resonances in the conductance around charge neutrality points, which result in strong sensitivity of the tunneling current to minor changes of the gate voltages. The observed phenomena are reproduced by our theoretical model taking into account electrostatics of the dual-gated structure, quantum capacitance effects, and self-consistent gap openings in both BLGs.

Title: Local spreading of stabilizer Rényi entropy in a brickwork random Clifford circuit
Authors: Somnath Maity, Ryusuke Hamazaki
Abstract: Nonstabilizerness, or magic, constitutes a fundamental resource for quantum computation and a crucial ingredient for quantum advantage. Recent progress has substantially advanced the characterization of magic in many-body quantum systems, with stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE) emerging as a computable and experimentally accessible measure. In this work, we investigate the spreading of SRE in terms of single-qubit reduced density matrices, where an initial product state that contains magic in a local region evolves under brickwork random Clifford circuits. For the case with Haar-random local Clifford gates, we find that the spreading profile exhibits a diffusive structure within a ballistic light cone when viewed through a normalized version of single-qubit SRE, despite the absence of explicit conserved charges. We further examine the robustness of this non-ballistic behavior of the normalized single-qubit SRE spreading by extending the analysis to a restricted Clifford circuit, where we unveil a superdiffusive spreading.

Title: Variational Method in Quantum Field Theory
Authors: Arthur Hutsalyuk, Márton Lájer, Giuseppe Mussardo, Andrea Stampiggi
Abstract: We develop a variational framework for addressing two-dimensional non-integrable quantum field theories through the exact structure of their integrable counterparts. Concentrating on the $\varphi^4$ Landau-Ginzburg model, we use the analytical Vacuum Expectation Values and Form Factors of local operators in the sinh-Gordon theory as the foundation of a variational ansatz. In this way, we obtain controlled estimates of central physical quantities of the $\varphi^4$ theory - such as the finite-volume ground-state energy and the physical mass as a function of the coupling constant. The strengths of the variational methods are leveraged in combination with the Hamiltonian truncation techniques and the LeClair-Mussardo formula, which also allow to probe the accuracy of the variational approximation varying the system size. Within the weak-coupling regime, a detailed numerical analysis reveals the behaviour of the finite-volume spectrum, the ground-state energy, and the elastic part of the scattering matrix, showing how the rigorous machinery of integrable models can serve as a guiding light into the complex landscape of non-integrable quantum field dynamics.

Title: Experimental Realization of Thermal Reservoirs with Tunable Temperature in a Trapped-Ion Spin-Boson Simulator
Authors: Visal So, Mingjian Zhu, Midhuna Duraisamy Suganthi, Abhishek Menon, George Tomaras, Roman Zhuravel, Han Pu, Guido Pagano
Abstract: We propose and demonstrate an experimental scheme to engineer thermal baths with independently tunable temperatures and dissipation rates for the motional modes of a trapped-ion system. This approach enables robust thermal-state preparation and quantum simulations of open-system dynamics in bosonic and spin-boson models at well-controlled finite temperatures. We benchmark our protocol by experimentally realizing out-of-equilibrium dynamics of a charge-transfer model at different temperatures. We observe that, when the process occurs at a higher temperature, the transfer rate spectrum broadens, with reduced rates at small donor-acceptor energy gaps and enhanced rates at large gaps. We then employ our scheme to study local-temperature effects in a two-mode vibrationally assisted exciton transfer system, where we observe thermally activated interference pathways for excitation transfer.

Title: Fractal structure of multipartite entanglement in monitored quantum circuits
Authors: Vaibhav Sharma, Erich J Mueller
Abstract: We analyze the distribution of multipartite entanglement in states produced in a one-dimensional random monitored quantum circuit where local Clifford unitaries are interspersed with single-site measurements performed with a probability $p$. This circuit has a measurement-induced phase transition at $p=p_c$, separating a phase in which the entanglement entropy scales with the system size (a volume law state) and one in which it scales with the boundary (an area law state). We calculate the entanglement depth, corresponding to the size of the largest cluster of entangled qubits, finding that it scales as a power law with system size in both the phases. The power law exponent is 1 in the volume law phase ($p < p_c$) and continuously decreases to 0 as $p \to 1$ in the area law phase. We explain this behavior by studying the spatial distribution of entangled clusters. We find that the largest cluster of entangled qubits in these states has a fractal dimension between 0 and 1 and appears to be self-similar. Away from the critical point, this fractal dimension matches the entanglement depth power law exponent.

Title: The Emergence of Socio-Economic Structure: A First-Principles Kinetic Theory
Authors: Miguel A. Durán-Olivencia
Abstract: Bridging the gap between individual agent behavior and macroscopic societal patterns is a central challenge in the social sciences. In this work, we propose a solution to this problem via a kinetic theory formulation. We demonstrate that complex, empirically-observed phenomena, such as the concentration of populations in cities and the emergence of power-law wealth distributions, can be derived directly from a microscopic model of agents governed by underdamped Langevin dynamics. Our multi-scale derivation yields the exact mesoscopic fluctuating (Dean-Kawasaki) dynamics and the macroscopic Vlasov-Fokker-Planck system of equations. The analytical solution of this system reveals how a heterogeneous resource landscape alone is sufficient to generate the coupled structures of spatial and economic inequality, thus providing a formal link between micro-level stochasticity and macro-level deterministic order.

Title: Quantum Symmetry and Geometry in Double-Scaled SYK
Authors: Jeremy van der Heijden, Erik Verlinde, Jiuci Xu
Abstract: The emergence of the quantum $R$-matrix in the double-scaled SYK model points to an underlying quantum group structure. In this work, we identify the quantum group $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{su}(1,1))$ as a subalgebra of the chord algebra. Specifically, we construct the generators of $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{s} \mathfrak{u}(1,1))$ from combinations of operators within the chord algebra and show that the one-particle chord Hilbert space decomposes into the positive discrete series representations of $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{s} \mathfrak{u}(1,1))$. Using the coproduct structure of the quantum group, we build the multi-particle Hilbert space and establish its equivalence with previous results defined by the chord rules. In particular, we show that the quantum $R$-matrix acts as a swapping operator that reverses the ordering of open chords in each fusion channel while incorporating the corresponding $q$-weighted penalty factors. This action enables an explicit derivation of the chord Yang-Baxter relation. We further explore a realization of the quantum group generators on the quantum disk, and present a novel factorization formula for the bulk gravitational wavefunction in the presence of matter. We further discuss the relation between the $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{s} \mathfrak{u}(1,1))$ structure uncovered here and the $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{s} \mathfrak{l}(2, \mathbb{R}))$ algebra previously studied from the boundary perspective. Finally, we study the gravitational wavefunction with matter in the Schwarzian regime.

Title: High-Purity Diamond Integration on $β$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ via Microwave Plasma CVD for Enhanced Thermal Management
Authors: Saleh Ahmed Khan, Stephen Margiotta, Ahmed Ibreljic, A F M Anhar Uddin Bhuiyan
Abstract: The integration of diamond with $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ presents a promising pathway to enhance thermal management in high-power electronic devices, where the inherently low thermal conductivity of $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ can lead to localized self-heating and elevated junction temperatures. In this work, we demonstrate a scalable, low-damage method to integrate high-quality polycrystalline diamond films on (010) $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ substrates using microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition (MPCVD), enabled by dielectric interlayers and polymer-assisted electrostatic nanodiamond seeding. A systematic investigation of processing conditions was conducted to assess their effects on film morphology, grain evolution, sp3-phase purity, and optical characteristics. Diamond films grown at 800 degC exhibit grain sizes up to 126.6 nm, RMS roughness of 16.3 nm, and a sharp diamond Raman peak at around 1332 cm-1 with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 34.98 cm-1. The corresponding sp$^3$-phase purity exceeds 97.5 percent, with an optical bandgap up to 5.13 eV. Deposition time variation from 10 to 60 minutes at 800 degC results in thicknesses from 53 nm to 315 nm and corresponding grain coarsening. Interlayer comparison reveals that SiO2 yields slightly larger grains and higher purity than SiNx under identical conditions. Notably, films with more than 96 percent sp$^3$ content were achieved at temperatures as low as 480 degC, confirming the compatibility of this approach with reduced thermal budgets. These results provide a robust framework for scalable $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$/diamond integration in thermally resilient high power and RF device technologies.

Title: Cold-Atom Buoy: A Differential Magnetic Sensing Technique in Cold Quadrupole Traps
Authors: Árpád Kurkó, Dávid Nagy, Alexandra Simon, Thomas W. Clark, András Dombi, Dániel Varga, Francis B. Williams, József Fortágh, Peter Domokos, András Vukics
Abstract: We present a technique for vectorial magnetic sensing using a cold-atom cloud trapped in a magnetic quadrupole. The center of the trapped cloud is determined by absorption imaging and compared for opposite polarities of the quadrupole. In the presence of an external magnetic field, the displacement of the cloud depends on both the field's direction and magnitude. By analyzing this shift under polarity reversal, we infer the two transverse components of a homogeneous external magnetic field relative to the imaging axis, without requiring spectroscopic interrogation. Assuming micron-scale position sensitivity and typical magnetic field gradients, the method enables resolution at the milli-Gauss level. It is compatible with standard cold-atom setups and offers a practical tool for field compensation in magnetically sensitive experimental stages. As such, it establishes a bridge between traditional macroscopic magnetic field probes and atomic-physics-based precision sensors.

Title: Information Processing in Quantum Thermodynamic Systems: an Autonomous Hamiltonian Approach
Authors: Shou-I Tang, Emery Doucet, Akram Touil, Sebastian Deffner, Akira Sone
Abstract: Extending the quantum formulation of [Phys. Rev. X 3, 041003 (2013)] to a more general setting for studying the thermodynamics of information processing including initial correlations, we generalize the second law of thermodynamics to account for information processing in such autonomous systems. We consider a composite quantum system consisting of a principal system, heat bath, memory, and work source, and adopt an autonomous Hamiltonian framework. We derive constraints on the total Hamiltonian that ensure the work source to act as a catalyst preserving its original randomness, namely that the total unitary evolution must have a unitary partial transpose. We show that this requirement is equivalent to the commutativity of operators acting on the joint system of the principal system, bath, and memory, which underlies the Hamiltonian structure. Next, we generalize the quantum speed limit for the joint dynamics of system and memory to the quantum thermodynamic speed limit, from which we obtain a dynamical version of Landauer's bound. More importantly, we also interpret this quantum thermodynamic speed limit in the context of quantum hypothesis testing.

Title: Alignment frustration-induced swarming lattice in the Vicsek-Kuramoto model
Authors: Yichen Lu, Yingshan Guo, Yiyi Zhang, Tong Zhu, Zhigang Zheng
Abstract: We introduce a frustration parameter $\alpha$ into the Vicsek-Kuramoto model of self-propelled particles. While the system exhibits conventional synchronized states, such as global phase synchronization and swarming, for low frustration ($\alpha < \pi/2$), beyond the critical point $\alpha = \pi/2$, a Hopf-Turing bifurcation drives a transition to a resting hexagonal lattice, accompanied by spatiotemporal patterns such as vortex lattices and dual-cluster lattices with oscillatory unit-cell motions. Lattice dominance is governed by coupling strength and interaction radius, with a clear parametric boundary balancing pattern periodicity and particle dynamics. Our results demonstrate that purely orientational interactions are sufficient to form symmetric lattices, challenging the necessity of spatial forces and illuminating the mechanisms driving lattice formation in active matter systems.

Title: Threshold model of language competition including the bilingual state
Authors: Mikhail V. Tamm, Els Heinsalu, Stefano Scialla, Marco Patriarca
Abstract: We propose a threshold model of language competition which includes intermediate bilingual state. The model is based on the Minett-Wang model but through the introduction of thresholds in the language shift rates it incorporates the effects of memory and learning. The model is piecewise-linear, allowing the exact analytical treatment. We study the symmetric case where two competing languages are equivalent in terms of status and social pressure and provide a complete list of the various dynamical regimes. We also study several limiting regimes corresponding to asymmetric systems and characterize the full spectrum of possible asymptotic behaviors. Unlike the Minett-Wang model, which always predicts the extinction of one of the languages, the proposed new model exhibits a wide range of possible equilibrium scenarios, including equilibrium states of coexistence. Most commonly, in such coexistence regimes the minority language speakers are either completely monolingual or completely bilingual.

Abstract: Exciton condensation--an interaction-driven, macroscopically coherent paired-fermion state--offers the prospect for dissipationless energy transport in solids, akin to that in superconductivity. Although their light effective mass and strong Coulomb binding favour high transition temperatures, convincing demonstrations of pure-exciton condensation have hitherto been limited to cryogenic conditions. Here, we report the direct observation of quasi-equilibrium condensation of dark excitons in monolayer tungsten diselenide at 300 K and ambient pressure. We achieve this by creating nanoscale spacing-graded Stark traps to confine free excitons, setting the finite-size scale, non-resonant off-axis optical injection to control the local density-temperature trajectory, and employing surface plasmon polariton-enhanced microsphere-assisted microscopy to boost dark-exciton emission and directly image first-order spatial coherence with sub-diffraction resolution. We observe a sharp degeneracy threshold and a clear phase transition, evidenced by extended first-order spatial coherence with algebraic decay and a critical exponent consistent with the universal Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless criterion. Identical condensation signatures are observed in over 30 independent samples. Our work establishes a room-temperature excitonic platform for exploring strongly correlated many-body physics and advancing near-dissipationless, coherent quantum technologies.

Title: Finite-time trajectorial estimates for inhomogeneous random walks
Authors: Sébastien Ott, Yvan Velenik
Abstract: We consider integer-valued random walks with independent but not identically distributed increments, and extend to this context several classical estimates, including a local limit theorem, precise small-ball estimates (both conditional on the final point and unconditional), and bounds on the probability that the random walk trajectory remains positive up to a given time (again, both conditional on the final point and unconditional). Two key features of this work are that the bounds are non-asymptotic, holding true for finite time horizons, and, crucially, that the latter hold uniformly over an entire class of admissible increment sequences. This provides a robust framework for applications. These results are, in particular, tailored for the analysis of processes derived through a time-dependent tilting of the increments of a time-homogeneous random walk.

Title: Random Walk conditioned to stay above a non-flat floor: curvature effects
Authors: Sébastien Ott, Yvan Velenik
Abstract: Let $h:[0,1]\to\mathbb{R}$ be $C^2$ and such that $\sup_{[0,1]} h''<0$. For a (large) positive integer $n$, set $h_n(k) = n h(k/n)$ for any $k\in\{0,\dots,n\}$. We consider a random walk $(S_k)_{k\geq 0}$ with i.i.d.\ centred increments having some finite exponential moments. We are interested in the event $\{S\geq h_n\} = \{S_k\geq h_n(k)\;\forall k\in\{0,\dots,n\}\}$. It is well known that $P(S\geq h_n \,|\, S_0=0,\, S_n=\lceil h_n(n) \rceil) = e^{n\int_0^1 I(h'(s)) \,ds + o(n)}$, where $I$ is the Legendre-Fenchel transform of the log-moment generating function associated to the increments. We first prove that the leading correction is of order $e^{-\Theta(n^{1/3})}$. We then turn our attention to the conditional random walk measure $P^h_n = P(\cdot \,|\, S\geq h_n, S_0=0, S_n=\lceil h_n(n) \rceil)$. We prove that the one-point tails are of the form $\mathbb{P}_n^h (S_k \geq h_n(k) + t n^{1/3} ) = e^{-\Theta(t^{3/2})}$ for all $t<n^\beta$ for any $\beta\in (0,1/6)$. Moreover, we prove that, for any $r\geq 1$, $E_n^h((S_k-h_n(k))^r) = \Theta(n^{r/3})$ and $\mathrm{Var}_{P_n^h}(S_k) = \Theta(n^{2/3})$, for all $k$ far enough from $0$ and $n$. In addition, we show that $\mathrm{Cov}_{P_n^h}(S_k,S_\ell) \leq e^{-O(|\ell-k|/n^{2/3})}$ for all $k,\ell$ not too close to $0$ and $n$.

Title: Global Population and Carrying Capacity in the Anthropocene: the Relative Growth Rate Insight
Authors: Aleksandra Drozd-Rzoska, Agata Angelika Sojecka, Sylwester J. Rzoska
Abstract: This report provides insights into global population dynamics since the beginning of the Anthropocene, focusing on empirical data and minimizing a priori the impact of model assumptions. It explores the Relative Growth Rate concept, introduced recently to global population studies by Lehman et al. [PNAS 118, e2024150118 (2021)] and subsequently extended to its analytical counterpart [PLoS ONE 20, eo323165 (2025)]. The analysis reveals a general non-monotonic growth pattern in the Anthropocene, emphasizing the uniqueness of the Industrial Revolution era. For the first 290 years, the Doomsday critical scaling provides a superior description for population changes, with a singularity at 2026. This is followed by the crossover to an exceptional 'reversed criticality' patterm, which has held over the last six decades, to the present day. The analysis suggests that the evolution of the human Real Intelligence (RI) population during the Innovations-driven Industrial Revolution times - a period of rapidly increasing connectivity and complexity - can serve as a model counterpart for the puzzling dynamics of Artificial Intelligence (AI) growth. The final conclusion is positive: the catastropic Doomsday singularity can be avoided due to the generic system constraints , both for RI and AI.

Title: Active bacterial pattern formation in evaporating droplets
Authors: Twan J.S. Wilting, Adriana W.B.P. Reijnier, Michiel H.M. Brebels, Alexandre Villie, Remy Colin, Hanneke Gelderblom
Abstract: Bacteria living on surfaces are often confined to droplets. When these droplets evaporate, the motion of the liquid-air interface and the associated internal capillary flow confine the bacteria. Here we study how \emph{E. coli} bacteria interact with this capillary confinement and agglomerate at the droplet's contact line. We identify three different types of bacterial pattern formation that depend on the bacterial activity and the environmental conditions imposed by the evaporating droplet. When the evaporation is fast, the bacteria are slow or the suspension is dilute, a uniform contact-line deposit forms. However, when the capillary confinement concentrates the bacteria at the contact line beyond a critical number density, localized collective motion spontaneously emerges. In that case, the bacteria induce a local stirring of the liquid that allows them to self-organize into periodic patterns and enables them to collectively escape from the contact line. At very high number densities, these periodic patterns get destabilized by bacterial turbulence in the bulk of the droplet resulting in the formation of mobile bacterial plumes at the contact line. Our results show how the subtle interplay between the bacteria and the capillary flow inside the droplet that surrounds them governs their dispersal.

Title: Thermodynamic uncertainty relations for relativistic quantum thermal machines
Authors: Dimitris Moustos, Obinna Abah
Abstract: We investigate a two-qubit SWAP thermal machine -- a streamlined analogue of the four-stroke Otto cycle -- whose working medium comprises inertially moving Unruh-DeWitt qubit detectors, each coupled to a thermal quantum field bath prepared at a different temperature. In the presence of relative motion between the working medium and the thermal baths, we derive thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs) that quantify the trade-off between performance, entropy production, and power fluctuations. Our analysis identifies regimes where relativistic motion leads to stronger violation of classical TURs, previously observed in static quantum setups. In addition, we establish generalized performance bounds for the thermal machine operating as either a heat engine or a refrigerator, and discuss how relativistic motion can enhance their performances beyond the standard Carnot limits defined by rest-frame temperatures.

Authors: Felix A. Palm, Nader Mostaan, Nathan Goldman, Fabian Grusdt
Abstract: Coherent control and braiding of anyons remain central challenges in realizing topologically protected quantum operations. We propose a Ramsey interferometry protocol to directly access the geometric phases associated with anyons in fractional Chern insulators. Our approach employs impurities with individually addressable internal states that bind to the anyons, allowing their adiabatic motion and exchange under full spatial control. By combining Ramsey and spin-echo sequences, the protocol isolates the Aharonov-Bohm and exchange contributions to the total geometric phase, providing an unambiguous probe of anyonic statistics. Our scheme can potentially be implemented in cold-atom quantum simulators as well as in van der Waals heterostructures. Complementary finite-size simulations in non-interacting Chern insulators quantify the system sizes required to faithfully extract geometric phases, highlighting the role of edge effects. Our results establish impurity-based interferometry as a feasible route toward direct anyon braiding experiments in quantum simulators and lay the groundwork for future explorations of non-Abelian braiding and topological quantum control.

Title: Photothermal resistivity alignment of optical fibers to SNSPD
Authors: Martin Baránek, Dušan Lorenc, Tomáš Ščepka, Ján Šoltýs, Iuliia Vetrova, Štefan Haščík, Miroslav Grajcar, Pavol Neilinger
Abstract: We demonstrate a straightforward optoelectronic fiber alignment technique for super- conducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) that exploits the temperature- dependent resistance of the nanowire under optical absorption. The target nanowire is illuminated via the fiber, and the local absorption of light heats the wire, causing a change in its resistivity. Scanning the fiber over the nanowire, the change in its resistivity is moni- tored by lock-in amplifier, mapping the spatial photothermal response correlated to absorp- tion and coupling efficiency. The maximum of the response corresponds to optimal fiber- SNSPD alignment. This method allows for aligning the fiber to the center of the meander with sub-micron precision. The response is robust to variations in the angle and height of the fiber, providing an alternative or complement to fiber-to-chip alignment methods based on the back-reflection or transmission measurement.

Title: On three papers by Jurgens \& Crutchfield, and on the basic structure of "computational mechanics"
Authors: Peter Grassberger
Abstract: In a recent paper, Jurgens and Crutchfield [Phys. Rev. E {\bf 104}, 064107 (2021), called ``paper III" in the following] computed what they called the ``ambiguity rate" of hidden Markov processes, a concept supposedly introduced by Claude Shannon. This calculation was based on a ``mixed state" formalism introduced by them in J. Stat. Phys. {\bf 183}, 32 (2021) (``paper I"), and developed further in Chaos, {\bf 31}, 083114 (2021) (``paper II"). We point out that (i) ambiguity rates were {\it not} introduced by Shannon; (ii) their computations in paper III are wrong, because of an error made already in papers I and II; (iii) due to this error (a confusion between open sets and their closures), also many of the ``statistical complexity dimensions" computed in II are wrong; (iv) the ``mixed state" formalism of I is just the well known `forward algorithm' for hidden Markov models; (v) the `causal states' in `$\epsilon$-machines' correspond in general to {\it finite} (as opposed to infinite, as often claimed) histories; and (vi) `$\epsilon$-machines' are always countable, in contrast to frequent claims in the literature. In addition, we propose an alternative complexity measure for models where the forecasting complexity is infinite, and we point out that our results apply also beyond hidden Markov models.

Title: Efficient driving of a spin-qubit using single-atom magnets
Authors: Jose Reina-Gálvez, Hoang-Anh Le, Hong Thi Bui, Soo-hyon Phark, Nicolás Lorente, Christoph Wolf
Abstract: The realization of electron-spin resonance at the single-atom level using scanning tunneling microscopy has opened new avenues for coherent quantum sensing and quantum state manipulation at the ultimate size limit. This allows to build many-body Hamiltonians and the study of their complex physical behavior. Recently, a novel qubit platform has emerged from this field, raising questions about the driving mechanism from single-atom magnets. In this work, we demonstrate how single-atom magnets can be used to drive a nearby single spin qubit efficiently. We show that the modulation of exchange coupling is the primary driving force, which successfully reproduces Rabi rates in the tens of MHz range, consistent with experimental data, while also addressing critical aspects related to the optimization of experimental parameters.

Title: Universal Behavior in Entanglement Entropy Reveals Quantum Criticality and Underlying Symmetry Breaking
Authors: Zhe Wang, Zehui Deng, Zenan Liu, Zhiyan Wang, Yi-Ming Ding, Long Zhang, Wenan Guo, Zheng Yan
Abstract: Entanglement plays a key role in quantum physics, but how much information it can extract from many-body systems is still an open question, particularly regarding quantum criticalities and emergent symmetries. In this work, we systematically study the entanglement entropy (EE) and derivative entanglement entropy (DEE) near quantum phase transitions in various quantum many-body systems. A one-parameter scaling relation between the DEE and system size at the critical point has been derived for the first time, which successfully obtains the critical exponent via data collapse. Furthermore, we find that the EE peaks at the (emergent) symmetry enhanced first-order transition, reflecting higher symmetry breaking. This work provides a new paradigm for quantum many-body research from the perspective of EE and DEE.

Title: Millikelvin Si-MOSFETs for Quantum Electronics
Authors: Nikolai Yurttagül, Markku Kainlauri, Jan Toivonen, Sushan Khadka, Antti Kanniainen, Arvind Kumar, Diego Subero, Juha T. Muhonen, Mika Prunnila, Janne S. Lehtinen
Abstract: Large power consumption of silicon CMOS electronics is a challenge in very-large-scale integrated circuits and a major roadblock to fault-tolerant quantum computation. Matching the power dissipation of Si-MOSFETs to the thermal budget at deep cryogenic temperatures, below 1 K, requires switching performance beyond levels facilitated by currently available CMOS technologies. We have manufactured fully depleted silicon-on-insulator MOSFETs tailored for overcoming the power dissipation barrier towards sub-1 K applications. With these cryo-optimized transistors we achieve a major milestone of reaching subthreshold swing of 0.3 mV/dec at 420 mK, thereby enabling very-large-scale integration of cryo-CMOS electronics for ultra-low temperature applications.

Title: Deep-lying semi-Dirac fermions in hexagonal close-packed cadmium
Authors: Alaska Subedi, Kamran Behnia
Abstract: Semi-Dirac fermions are massless in one direction and massive in the perpendicular directions. Such quasiparticles have been proposed in various contexts in condensed matter. Using first principles calculations, we identify a pair of semi-Dirac bands anti-crossing at $-3$ eV below the Fermi level in the electronic structure of hexagonal close-packed cadmium. The linear out-of-plane dispersion is kept up to the Fermi level. We demonstrate that the dichotomy between the linear and quadratic dispersions is driven by an orientation-sensitive hybridization between the $s$ and $p_z$ orbitals. The upper semi-Dirac band produces a lens-shaped nonellipsoidal Fermi sheet whose cross-section area has a $k$-dependence that is in excellent agreement with the experimentally measured period of Sondheimer oscillations.

Title: Doped resonating-valence-bond states: Robustness of the spin-ice phases in three-dimensional Rydberg arrays
Authors: Jingya Wang, Changle Liu, Yan-Cheng Wang, Zheng Yan
Abstract: Rydberg blockade effect provides a convenient platform for simulating locally constrained many-body systems, such as quantum dimer models and quantum loop models, especially their novel phases like topological orders and gapless quantum spin ice (QSI) phases. To discuss the possible phase diagram containing different QSIs in three-dimensional (3D) Rydberg arrays, we have constructed an extended Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) Hamiltonian with equal weight superposition ground state in different fillings at the RK point. Therefore, the perfect QSIs with fixed local dimer filling and their monomer-doped states can be simulated directly by Monte Carlo sampling. Using single-mode approximation, the excitations of dimers and monomers have also been explored in different fillings. We find that, in the thermodynamical limit, even doping a small amount of monomers can disrupt the topological structure and lead to the existence of off-diagonal long-range order. However, in a finite size (as in cold-atom experiment), the property of QSI will be kept in a certain region like a crossover after doping. The phase diagram containing different QSIs and off-diagonal order phases is proposed.

Title: Finite-momentum pairing and superlattice superconductivity in valley-imbalanced rhombohedral graphene
Authors: Maine Christos, Pietro M. Bonetti, Mathias S. Scheurer
Abstract: Inspired by the recent experimental discovery of superconductivity emerging from a time-reversal symmetry-breaking normal state in tetralayer rhombohedral graphene, we here investigate superconducting instabilities in this system. We classify the possible pairing instabilities, including states with commensurate and incommensurate center of mass momenta. As rotational symmetry is broken in the latter type of pairing states, their momentum-space structure is most naturally characterized by a `valley-independent Chern number', measuring the relative chirality between the normal and superconducting state. We further demonstrate that superconductivity can condense at multiple incommensurate momenta simultaneously, leading to the spontaneous formation of a translational-symmetry-breaking superlattice superconductor. Studying multiple different pairing mechanisms and varying the degree of spin and valley polarization in the normal state, we compare the energetics of these superconductors. Our results demonstrate that valley-imbalanced rhombohedral tetralayer graphene can give rise to rich superconducting phenomenologies.

Title: CrystalFormer-RL: Reinforcement Fine-Tuning for Materials Design
Authors: Zhendong Cao, Lei Wang
Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning played an instrumental role in enhancing the instruction-following and reasoning abilities of large language models. In this work, we employ reinforcement fine-tuning for materials design, in which discriminative machine learning models are used to provide rewards to the autoregressive transformer-based materials generative model CrystalFormer. By optimizing the reward signals-such as energy above the convex hull and material properties figures of merit-reinforcement fine-tuning infuses knowledge from discriminative models into generative models. The resulting model, CrystalFormer-RL, shows enhanced stability in generated crystals and successfully discovers crystals with desirable yet conflicting material properties, such as substantial dielectric constant and band gap simultaneously. Notably, we observe that reinforcement fine-tuning not only enables the property-guided material design but also unlocks property-based material retrieval behavior of pretrained generative model. The present framework opens an exciting gateway to the synergies of the machine learning ecosystem for materials design.

Title: Controllable and Non-Dissipative Inertial Dynamics of Skyrmion in a Bosonic Platform
Authors: Imam Makhfudz
Abstract: It has been understood in the past a decade or two that the dynamics of spin or magnetization in ultrafast regime necessarily involves inertial term that reflects the reluctance to follow abrupt or sudden change in the spin or magnetization orientation. The role of inertial spin dynamics in governing the motion of Skyrmion, a topological spin texture, is elucidated. Using nonequilibrium Green's function Keldysh formalism, an equation of motion is derived in terms of collective coordinates for a Skyrmion coupled via a ``minimal coupling'' to a bath of harmonic oscillators of frequency $\omega$, modeling an optical phonon-like bosonic bath with its nearly-flat energy spectrum, and a coupling to the phonon energy density that dominates under resonance condition at the optical phonon frequency. A deterministic and non-dissipative dynamics equation of motion is obtained with an explicit mass term for the Skyrmion emerging due to the coupling, even within rigid Skyrmion picture. This results in a cyclotronic motion of Skyrmion, with a frequency that can go ultrafast, depending on that of the oscillator. Controlling the oscillator frequency can therefore guide the Skyrmion dynamics. Our theory bridges inertial dynamics and topology in magnetism and opens a pathway to ultrafast control of topological spin textures.

Title: Amorphous Solid Model of Vectorial Hopfield Neural Networks
Authors: F. Gallavotti, A. Zaccone
Abstract: We introduce a three-dimensional vectorial extension of the Hopfield associative-memory model in which each neuron is a unit vector on $S^2$ and synaptic couplings are $3\times 3$ blocks generated through a vectorial Hebbian rule. The resulting block-structured operator is mathematically analogous to the Hessian of amorphous solids and induces a rigid energy landscape with deep minima for stored patterns. Simulations and spectral analysis demonstrate that the vectorial network substantially outperforms the classical binary Hopfield model: it exhibits a memory capacity that grows linearly with connectivity, a persistent spectral gap separating stored patterns from noise, and significantly enlarged basins of attraction. These results show that geometric constraints combined with amorphous-solid-inspired structure yield associative memories with markedly enhanced stability and retrieval performance.

Title: The superconducting diode effect in Josephson junctions fabricated from structurally chiral Mo$_3$Al$_2$C
Authors: Peter T. Orban, Gregory Bassen, Evan N. Crites, Takumi Matsuo, Maxime A. Siegler, Tyrel M. McQueen
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect occurs in superconducting materials in which both spin and inversion symmetry are broken. The recently observed chirality-induced spin selectivity effect demonstrates that chiral materials break both symmetries. Thus a Josephson junction interface with the left-handed structure on one side of the junction and the right-handed structure on the other should exhibit a diode effect. Here, we report the electrical transport properties of right-handed/left-handed and right-handed/right-handed devices fabricated from single crystals of the structurally chiral superconductor Mo$_3$Al$_2$C. Fraunhofer-like magnetic diffraction patterns confirm the presence of Josephson effect in all but one of our devices. A magnetic field-induced superconducting diode effect is demonstrated in the right-handed/left-handed devices by a statistically significant difference in $I_{c+}$ and $I_{c-}$, with a maximum asymmetry of 5\%. The intrinsic superconducting diode effect is not observed in the right-handed/right-handed devices. We provide an explanation for the presence of the superconducting diode effect in the right-handed/left-handed devices.

Title: Geometric Features of Higher-Order Networks via the Spectral Triplet
Authors: Sara Najem, Dima Mrad, Mohammad Elsayed
Abstract: Our work is concerned with simplicial complexes that describe higher-order interactions in real complex systems. This description allows to go beyond the pairwise node-to-node representation that simple networks provide and to capture a hierarchy of interactions of different orders. The prime contribution of this work is the introduction of geometric measures for these simplicial complexes. We do so by noting the non-commutativity of the algebra associated with their matrix representations and consequently we bring to bear the spectral triplet formalism of Connes on these structures and then notions of associated dimensions, curvature, and distance can be computed to serve as characterizing features in addition to known topological metrics.

Title: Cavity-induced coherent magnetization and polaritons in altermagnets
Authors: Mohsen Yarmohammadi, Libor Šmejkal, James K. Freericks
Abstract: Altermagnets feature antiparallel spin sublattices with $d$-, $g$-, or $i$-wave spin order, yielding nonrelativistic spin splitting without net magnetization. We show that embedding a two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnet in a driven optical cavity induces a finite, tunable magnetization. Coherent photon driving couples selectively to electronic sublattices, and the resulting altermagnets' symmetry-broken spin texture yields a pronounced steady-state spin imbalance -- coherent magnetization -- absent in conventional antiferromagnets for the same lattice configuration. A mean-field Lindblad analysis reveals the dominance of quadratic over linear couplings. In the strong-coupling regime, distinct polariton signatures emerge in the steady state of induced magnetization. This work demonstrates cavity control of altermagnets for spintronic applications.

Title: Large deviations in the many-body localization transition: The case of the random-field XXZ chain
Authors: Greivin Alfaro Miranda, Fabien Alet, Giulio Biroli, Leticia F. Cugliandolo, Nicolas Laflorencie, Marco Tarzia
Abstract: The effect of rare system-wide resonances in the many-body localization (MBL) transition has recently attracted significant attention. They are expected to play a prominent role in the stability of the MBL phase, prompting the development of new theoretical frameworks to properly account for their statistical weight. We employ a method based on an analogy with mean-field disordered glassy systems to characterize the statistics of transmission amplitudes between distant many-body configurations in Hilbert space, and apply it to the random-field XXZ spin chain. By introducing a Lagrange multiplier, which formally plays the role of an effective temperature controlling the influence of extreme outliers in the heavy-tailed distribution of propagators, we identify three distinct regimes: (i) an ergodic phase with uniform spreading in Hilbert space, (ii) an intermediate regime where delocalization is driven by rare, disorder-dependent long-range resonances, and (iii) a robust MBL phase where such resonances cannot destabilize localization. We derive a finite-size phase diagram in the disorder--interaction plane both in the spin and in the Anderson basis that quantitatively agrees with recent numerical results based on real-space spin-spin correlation functions. We further demonstrate that even infinitesimal interactions can destroy the Anderson insulator at finite disorder, with the critical disorder remaining finite down to small interaction strengths. By visualizing resonant transmission pathways on the Hilbert space graph, we provide a complementary perspective to real-space and spectral probes, revealing how the destabilization of the MBL phase at finite sizes stems from the emergence of resonant paths that become progressively rarer and shorter-ranged deep in the localized phase.

Title: Temperley-Lieb integrable models and fusion categories
Authors: Matthew Blakeney, Luke Corcoran, Marius de Leeuw, Balazs Pozsgay, Eric Vernier
Abstract: We show that every fusion category containing a non-invertible, self-dual object $a$ gives rise to an integrable anyonic chain whose Hamiltonian density satisfies the Temperley-Lieb algebra. This spin chain arises by considering the projection onto the identity channel in the fusion process $a\otimes a$. We relate these models to Pasquier's construction of ADE lattice models. We then exploit the underlying Temperley-Lieb structure to discuss the spectrum of these models and argue that these models are gapped when the quantum dimension of $a$ is greater than 2. We show that for fusion categories where the dimension is close to 2, such as the Fib$\times$Fib and Haagerup fusion categories, the finite size effects are large and they can obscure the numerical analysis of the gap.

Title: Uncovering field-induced magnetic phase transition by direct observation of the crystal electric-field splitting in a rare-earth magnetic insulator
Authors: Hope Whitelock, Allen O. Scheie, Marissa McMaster, Ian A. Leahy, Li Xiang, Mykhaylo Ozerov, Dmitry Smirnov, Eun Sang Choi, C. dela Cruz, M. O. Ajeesh, Eliana S. Krakovsky, Daniel A. Rehn, Jie Xing, Athena S. Sefat, Minhyea Lee
Abstract: An indispensable step toward understanding magnetic interactions in rare-earth magnets is to determine the spatially anisotropic single-ion properties set by crystal electric field (CEF) physics. The CEF Hamiltonian yields a discrete energy spectrum governed by a set of parameters reflecting the local site symmetry of the magnetic ion. However, experimentally determining these parameters, especially for ones at low-symmetry sites remains highly challenging. In this work, we directly measure the CEF level splittings of CsErSe2 under magnetic fields using optical spectroscopy. This enables us to determine the CEF parameters and to predict the metamagnetic-like transition arising from a level-crossing in the ground state. We also identify a level-crossing in the first excited state that leads to a non-monotonic Zeeman splitting, which strongly influences the temperature and field dependence of the magnetization. Our results highlight the capacity of single-ion physics to drive rich and unanticipated phenomena in rare-earth magnetic insulators under applied magnetic field.

Title: The phase-field model of fracture incorporating Mohr-Coulomb, Mogi-Coulomb, and Hoek-Brown strength surfaces
Authors: S Chockalingam, Adrian Buganza Tepole, Aditya Kumar
Abstract: Classical phase-field theories of brittle fracture capture toughness-controlled crack growth but do not account for the material's strength surface, which governs fracture nucleation in the absence of cracks. The phase-field formulation of Kumar et al. (2020) proposed a blueprint for incorporating the strength surface while preserving toughness-controlled propagation by introducing a nucleation driving force and presented results for the Drucker-Prager surface. Following this blueprint, Chockalingam (2025) recently derived a general driving-force expression that incorporates arbitrary strength surfaces. The present work implements this driving force within a finite-element framework and incorporates representative strength surfaces that span diverse mathematical and physical characteristics-the Mohr-Coulomb, 3D Hoek-Brown, and Mogi-Coulomb surfaces. Through simulations of canonical fracture problems, the formulation is comprehensively validated across fracture regimes, capturing (i) nucleation under uniform stress, (ii) crack growth from large pre-existing flaws, and (iii) fracture governed jointly by strength and toughness. While the strength surfaces examined here already encompass a broad range of brittle materials, the results demonstrate the generality and robustness of the proposed driving-force construction for materials governed by arbitrary strength surfaces.

Title: Phonon-Dominated Thermal Transport and Large Violation of the Wiedemann-Franz Law in Topological Semimetal CoSi
Authors: Luyao Zhong, Xin Jin, Mingquan He, Rui Wang, Xiaoyuan Zhou, Tianqi Deng, Xiaolong Yang
Abstract: The Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law, relating the electronic thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{\rm e}$) to the electrical conductivity, is vital in numerous applications such as in the design of thermoelectric materials and in the experimental determination of the lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{\rm L}$). While the WF law is generally robust, violations are frequently observed, typically manifesting in a reduced Lorenz number ($L$) relative to the Sommerfeld value ($L_0$) due to inelastic scattering. Here, we report a pronounced departure from the WF law in the topological semimetal CoSi, where the electronic Lorenz number ($L_{\rm e}$) instead rises up to $\sim40\%$ above $L_0$. We demonstrate that this anomaly arises from strong bipolar diffusive transport, enabled by topological band-induced electron-hole compensation, which allows electrons and holes to flow cooperatively and additively enhance the heat current. Concurrently, we unveil that the lattice contribution to thermal conductivity is anomalously large and becomes the dominant component below room temperature. As a result, if $\kappa_{\rm L}$ is assumed negligible -- as conventional in metals, the resulting $L$ from the total thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{\rm tot}=\kappa_{\rm L}+\kappa_{\rm e}$) deviates from $L_0$ by more than a factor of three. Our work provides deeper insight into the unconventional thermal transport physics in topological semimetals.

Title: Dataset-Free Weight-Initialization on Restricted Boltzmann Machine
Authors: Muneki Yasuda, Ryosuke Maeno, Chako Takahashi
Abstract: In feed-forward neural networks, dataset-free weight-initialization methods such as LeCun, Xavier (or Glorot), and He initializations have been developed. These methods randomly determine the initial values of weight parameters based on specific distributions (e.g., Gaussian or uniform distributions) without using training datasets. To the best of the authors' knowledge, such a dataset-free weight-initialization method is yet to be developed for restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs), which are probabilistic neural networks consisting of two layers. In this study, we derive a dataset-free weight-initialization method for Bernoulli--Bernoulli RBMs based on statistical mechanical analysis. In the proposed weight-initialization method, the weight parameters are drawn from a Gaussian distribution with zero mean. The standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution is optimized based on our hypothesis that a standard deviation providing a larger layer correlation (LC) between the two layers improves the learning efficiency. The expression of the LC is derived based on a statistical mechanical analysis. The optimal value of the standard deviation corresponds to the maximum point of the LC. The proposed weight-initialization method is identical to Xavier initialization in a specific case (i.e., when the sizes of the two layers are the same, the random variables of the layers are $\{-1,1\}$-binary, and all bias parameters are zero). The validity of the proposed weight-initialization method is demonstrated in numerical experiments using a toy and real-world datasets.

Title: Correlated quantum machines beyond the standard second law
Authors: Milton Aguilar, Eric Lutz
Abstract: The laws of thermodynamics strongly restrict the performance of thermal machines. Standard thermodynamics, initially developed for uncorrelated macroscopic systems, does not hold for microscopic systems correlated with their environments. We here derive an exact formula for the efficiency of any cyclically driven quantum engine by using generalized laws of quantum thermodynamics that account for all possible correlations between all involved parties, including initial correlations. Furthermore, we demonstrate the existence of two basic modes of engine operation: the usual thermal case, where heat is converted into work, and a novel athermal regime, where work is extracted from entropic resources, such as system-bath correlations. In the latter regime, the efficiency is not bounded by the usual Carnot formula. Our results provide a unified formalism to determine the efficiency of correlated microscopic quantum machines.

Title: Quantifying world geography as seen through the lens of Soviet propaganda
Authors: M.V. Tamm, M. Oiva, K.D. Mukhina, M. Mets, M. Schich
Abstract: Cultural data typically contains a variety of biases. In particular, geographical locations are unequally portrayed in media, creating a distorted representation of the world. Identifying and measuring such biases is crucial to understand both the data and the socio-cultural processes that have produced them. Here we suggest to measure geographical biases in a large historical news media corpus by studying the representation of cities. Leveraging ideas of quantitative urban science, we develop a mixed quantitative-qualitative procedure, which allows us to get robust quantitative estimates of the biases. These biases can be further qualitatively interpreted resulting in a hermeneutic feedback loop. We apply this procedure to a corpus of the Soviet newsreel series 'Novosti Dnya' (News of the Day) and show that city representation grows super-linearly with city size, and is further biased by city specialization and geographical location. This allows to systematically identify geographical regions which are explicitly or sneakily emphasized by Soviet propaganda and quantify their importance.

Title: Does the square-root price impact law belong to the strict universal scalings?: quantitative support by a complete survey of the Tokyo stock exchange market
Authors: Yuki Sato, Kiyoshi Kanazawa
Abstract: Universal power laws have been scrutinised in physics and beyond, and a long-standing debate exists in econophysics regarding the strict universality of the nonlinear price impact, commonly referred to as the square-root law (SRL). The SRL posits that the average price impact $I$ follows a power law with respect to transaction volume $Q$, such that $I(Q) \propto Q^{\delta}$ with $\delta \approx 1/2$. Some researchers argue that the exponent $\delta$ should be system-specific, without universality. Conversely, others contend that $\delta$ should be exactly $1/2$ for all stocks across all countries, implying universality. However, resolving this debate requires high-precision measurements of $\delta$ with errors of around $0.1$ across hundreds of stocks, which has been extremely challenging due to the scarcity of large microscopic datasets -- those that enable tracking the trading behaviour of all individual accounts. Here we conclusively support the universality hypothesis of the SRL by a complete survey of all trading accounts for all liquid stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) over eight years. Using this comprehensive microscopic dataset, we show that the exponent $\delta$ is equal to $1/2$ within statistical errors at both the individual stock level and the individual trader level. Additionally, we rejected two prominent models supporting the nonuniversality hypothesis: the Gabaix-Gopikrishnan-Plerou-Stanley and the Farmer-Gerig-Lillo-Waelbroeck models. Our work provides exceptionally high-precision evidence for the universality hypothesis in social science and could prove useful in evaluating the price impact by large investors -- an important topic even among practitioners.

Title: Non-Stabilizerness of Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Model
Authors: Surajit Bera, Marco Schirò
Abstract: We study the non-stabilizerness or quantum magic of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev ($\rm SYK$) model, a prototype example of maximally chaotic quantum matter. We show that the Majorana spectrum of its ground state, encoding the spreading of the state in the Majorana basis, displays a Gaussian distribution as expected for chaotic quantum many-body systems. We compare our results with the case of the $\rm SYK_2$ model, describing non-chaotic random free fermions, and show that the Majorana spectrum is qualitatively different in the two cases, featuring an exponential Laplace distribution for the $\rm SYK_2$ model rather than a Gaussian. From the spectrum we extract the Stabilizer Renyi Entropy (SRE) and show that for both models it displays a linear scaling with system size, with a prefactor that is larger for the SYK model, which has therefore higher magic. Finally, we discuss the spreading of quantun magic under unitary dynamics, as described by the evolution of the Majorana spectrum and the Stabilizer Renyi Entropy starting from a stabilizer state. We show that the SRE for the $\rm SYK_2$ model equilibrates rapidly, but that in the steady-state the interacting chaotic SYK model has more magic than the simple $\rm SYK_2$. Our results suggest that the Majorana spectrum is qualitatively distinct in chaotic and non-chaotic many-body systems.

Title: Learning conformational ensembles of proteins based on backbone geometry
Authors: Nicolas Wolf, Leif Seute, Vsevolod Viliuga, Simon Wagner, Jan Stühmer, Frauke Gräter
Abstract: Deep generative models have recently been proposed for sampling protein conformations from the Boltzmann distribution, as an alternative to often prohibitively expensive Molecular Dynamics simulations. However, current state-of-the-art approaches rely on fine-tuning pre-trained folding models and evolutionary sequence information, limiting their applicability and efficiency, and introducing potential biases. In this work, we propose a flow matching model for sampling protein conformations based solely on backbone geometry - BBFlow. We introduce a geometric encoding of the backbone equilibrium structure as input and propose to condition not only the flow but also the prior distribution on the respective equilibrium structure, eliminating the need for evolutionary information. The resulting model is orders of magnitudes faster than current state-of-the-art approaches at comparable accuracy, is transferable to multi-chain proteins, and can be trained from scratch in a few GPU days. In our experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed model achieves competitive performance with reduced inference time, across not only an established benchmark of naturally occurring proteins but also de novo proteins, for which evolutionary information is scarce or absent. BBFlow is available at this https URL.

Title: Probing forced responses and causality in data-driven climate emulators: conceptual limitations and the role of reduced-order models
Authors: Fabrizio Falasca
Abstract: A central challenge in climate science and applied mathematics is developing data-driven models of multiscale systems that capture both stationary statistics and responses to external perturbations. Current neural climate emulators aim to resolve the atmosphere-ocean system in all its complexity but often struggle to reproduce forced responses, limiting their use in causal studies such as Green's function experiments. To investigate the origin of these limitations, we first examine a simplified dynamical system that retains key features of climate variability. We interpret the results through linear response theory, providing a rigorous framework to evaluate neural models beyond stationary statistics and probe causal mechanisms. We argue that the ability of multiscale systems' emulators to reproduce perturbed statistics depends critically on (i) identifying an appropriate coarse-grained representation and (ii) careful parameterizations of unresolved processes. For low-frequency climate dynamics, these insights highlight reduced-order models, tailored to specific processes and scales, as valuable alternatives to general-purpose emulators. We next consider a real-world application, developing a neural model to investigate the joint variability of the surface temperature field and radiative fluxes. The model infers a multiplicative noise process directly from data, largely reproduces the system's probability distribution, and enables causal studies through forced responses. We discuss its limitations and outline directions for future work. These results expose key challenges in data-driven modeling of multiscale physical systems and underscore the value of coarse-grained, stochastic approaches, with response theory as a principled framework to guide model design.

Title: Scattering States in One-Dimensional Non-Hermitian Baths
Authors: Jimin Li, Yuwen E. Zhang, Franco Nori, Zongping Gong
Abstract: A single quantum emitter coupled to a structured non-Hermitian environment shows anomalous bound states and real-time dynamics without Hermitian counterparts, as shown in [Gong et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 223601 (2022)]. In this work, we establish a general approach for studying the scattering states of a single quantum emitter coupled to one-dimensional non-Hermitian single-band baths. We formally solve the exact eigenvalue equation for all the scattering states defined on finite periodic lattices. In the thermodynamic limit, the formal solution reduces to the celebrated Lippmann-Schwinger equation for generic baths. In this case, we find that the scattering states are no longer linear superpositions of plane waves in general, unlike those in Hermitian systems; Instead, the wave functions exhibit a large, yet finite localization length proportional to the lattice size. Furthermore, we show and discuss the cases where the Lippmann-Schwinger equation breaks down. We find the analytical solutions for the Hatano-Nelson and unidirectional next-to-nearest-neighbor baths in the thermodynamic limit.

Authors: Pietro Marabotti, Simone Melesi, Piotr Pińkowski, Bartłomiej Pigulski, Sonia Peggiani, Alice Cartoceti, Patrick Serafini, Barbara Rossi, Valeria Russo, Sławomir Szafert, Carlo Spartaco Casari
Abstract: We report the first synthesis of halogenated organic molecules via pulsed laser ablation in liquid, specifically halopolyynes, i.e., carbon atomic wires terminated by halogen atoms, and the first Raman characterization of long halogenated wires. Using dichloromethane and a dibromomethane-containing solution, we produced a polydisperse mixtures of monohalogeanted (HC$_n$X) and dihalogenated (XC$_n$X) polyynes (X=Cl, Br; n=6-20). High-performance liquid chromatography enabled us to separate and analyze these compounds, while chemical derivatization and mass spectroscopy confirmed their molecular structures. Their formation mechanism involves carbon chain polymerization and termination by halogen atoms from atomized solvent molecules during the plasma phase. UV-Vis absorption and synchrotron-based UV Resonance Raman spectroscopy revealed that halogen terminations act as weak electron donors, slightly affecting conjugation, bond length alternation, and moderately redshifting vibronic absorption and vibrational modes. Resonance Raman spectra show selective overtone enhancement, an emerging signature behavior of carbyne-like systems. Vibrational anharmonicity measurements confirm that halopolyynes follow the universal anharmonicity law previously proposed for carbyne-like materials, solidifying their classification within this family. These findings not only expand the synthetic toolbox for carbon atomic wires but also establish halopolyynes as a versatile platform for tailoring wire terminations and developing novel materials with tunable electronic and optical properties.

Title: Quantum-to-Classical Transition via Single-Shot Generalized Measurements
Authors: Zhenyu Xu
Abstract: The quantum-to-classical transition in finite-dimensional systems is generally believed to occur asymptotically, yet this process has not been systematically examined and the mechanism governing the intermediate regime remains unclear. We address this question using an operational framework that bridges discrete generalized measurements and continuous isotropic depolarizing channels. We show that a single round of such a generalized measurement can eliminate quasiprobability negativity, that is, nonclassicality, in quantum phase space for finite-dimensional systems. From the perspective of decoherence, we find that although the overall process is continuous, the loss of quasiprobability negativity occurs abruptly, defying the conventional expectation of asymptotic decay. Additionally, we propose quantum-circuit implementations and analyze their feasibility on current quantum platforms, such as superconducting systems. Our results provide new insight into the intermediate regime of the quantum-to-classical transition in finite-dimensional systems and enable the simulation of open system dynamics through operational generalized measurements.

Title: Superuniversal Statistics with Topological Origins for non-Hermitian Scattering Singularities
Authors: Nadav Shaibe, Jared M. Erb, Steven M. Anlage
Abstract: Vortex singularities in speckle patterns formed from random superpositions of waves are an inevitable consequence of destructive interference and are consequently generic and ubiquitous. Singularities are topologically stable, meaning they persist under small perturbations and can only be removed via pairwise annihilation. They have applications including sensing, imaging and energy transfer in multiple fields such as optics, acoustics, and elastic or fluid waves. We generalize the concept of speckle patterns to arbitrary parameter spaces and any complex scalar function that describes wave phenomena involving complicated scattering. In scattering systems specifically, we are often concerned with singularities associated with complex zeros of various functions of the scattering matrix S, such as Coherent Perfect Absorption, Reflectionless Scattering Modes, Transmissionless Scattering Modes, and Exceptional Points. Experimentally, we find that all singularities share a universal statistical property: any quantity that diverges as a simple pole at a singularity has a probability distribution function with a -3 power law tail. The tail of the distribution provides an estimate for the likelihood of finding a given singularity in a generic system. We use these universal statistical results to determine that homogeneous system loss is the most important parameter determining singularity density in a given parameter space of an absorptive scattering system. Finally, we discuss events where distinct singularities coincide in parameter space, which result in higher order singularities that are not topologically protected, and we do not find universal statistical properties for them. We support our empirical results from microwave experiments with Random Matrix Theory simulations and conclude that the statistical results presented hold for all generic non-Hermitian scattering systems.

Title: High to low temperature: $O(N)$ model at large $N$
Authors: Justin R. David, Srijan Kumar
Abstract: We study the $O(N)$ vector model for scalars with quartic interaction at large $N$ on $S^1\times S^2$ without the singlet constraint. The non-trivial fixed point of the model is described by a thermal mass satisfying the gap equation at large $N$. We obtain the free energy and the energy density for the model as a series at low temperature in units of the radius of the sphere. We show these results agree with the Borel-Padé extrapolations of the high temperature expansions of the free energy and energy density obtained in our previous work. This agreement validates both the expansions and demonstrates that low temperature expansions obtained here correspond to the same solution of the gap equation studied earlier at high temperature. We obtain the ratio of the free energy of the theory at the non-trivial fixed point to that of the Gaussian theory at all values of temperature. This ratio begins at $4/5$ when the temperature is infinity, decreases to a minimum value of $0.760753$, then increases and approaches unity as the temperature is decreased.

Title: P-DRUM: Post-hoc Descriptor-based Residual Uncertainty Modeling for Machine Learning Potentials
Authors: Shih-Peng Huang, Nontawat Charoenphakdee, Yuta Tsuboi, Yong-Bin Zhuang, Wenwen Li
Abstract: Ensemble method is considered the gold standard for uncertainty quantification (UQ) in machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). However, their high computational cost can limit its practicality. Alternative techniques, such as Monte Carlo dropout and deep kernel learning, have been proposed to improve computational efficiency; however, some of these methods cannot be applied to already trained models and may affect the prediction accuracy. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient post-hoc framework for UQ that leverages the descriptor of a trained graph neural network potential to estimate residual errors. We refer to this method as post-hoc descriptor-based residual uncertainty modeling (P-DRUM). P-DRUM models the discrepancy between MLIP predictions and ground truth values, allowing these residuals to act as proxies for prediction uncertainty. We explore multiple variants of P-DRUM and benchmark them against established UQ methods, evaluating both their effectiveness and limitations.

Title: Fermion Parity Resolution of Entanglement
Authors: Christian Northe
Abstract: Entanglement is analyzed in the Majorana fermion conformal field theory (CFT) in the vacuum, in the fermion state, and in states built from conformal interfaces. In the boundary-state approach, the Hilbert space admits two factorizations for a single interval, producing distinct entanglement spectra determined by spin structures. Although Rényi and relative entropies are shown to be insensitive to these structures, symmetry-resolved entanglement naturally reveals their differences. The Majorana fermion's $\mathbb{Z}_2^F$ symmetry, generated by the fermion-parity operator $(-1)^F$, distinguishes bosonic from fermionic sectors, motivating the notion of fermion-parity resolution. While $\mathbb{Z}_2^F$ is naturally a symmetry of the vacuum and fermion reduced density matrices, the Hilbert space factorization is shown to stabilize this symmetry in conformal interface states. When an unpaired Majorana zero mode is present, fermion-parity-resolved entropies display equipartition at all orders in the UV cutoff; in its absence, the breaking of equipartition is quantified by Ramond-sector data. This behavior persists across all states considered. Connections with symmetry-protected topological phases of matter are outlined. All results are compared with twist field computations.

Title: Entanglement Sum Rule from Higher-Form Symmetries
Authors: Pei-Yao Liu
Abstract: We prove an entanglement sum rule for $(d-1)$-dimensional quantum lattice models with finite abelian higher-form symmetries, obtained by minimally coupling a sector on $p$-simplices carrying a $p$-form $G$ symmetry to a sector on $(p+1)$-simplices carrying the dual $(d-p-2)$-form $\widehat G$ symmetry (with $\widehat G$ being the Pontryagin dual of $G$). The coupling is introduced by conjugation with a symmetry-preserving operator $\mathcal{U}$ that dresses symmetry-invariant operators with appropriate Wilson operators. Our main result concerns symmetric eigenstates of the coupled model that arise by acting with $\mathcal{U}$ on direct-product symmetric eigenstates of the decoupled model: provided a topological criterion formulated via the Mayer--Vietoris sequence holds for the chosen bipartition, $\mathcal{U}$ factorizes across the cut when acting on the symmetric state, and the entanglement entropy equals the sum of the entropies of the two sectors. This framework explains and generalizes known examples in fermion-$\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory, identifies when topology obstructs the sum rule, and provides a procedure to construct new examples by gauging higher-form symmetries.

Title: A Remarkable Application of Zassenhaus Formula to Strongly Correlated Electron Systems
Authors: Louis Jourdan (LJAD), Patrick Cassam-Chenaï (LJAD)
Abstract: We show that the Zassenhaus decomposition for the exponential of the sum of two non-commuting operators, simplifies drastically when these operators satisfy a simple condition, called the no-mixed adjoint property. An important application to a Unitary Coupled Cluster method for strongly correlated electron systems is presented. This ansatz requires no Trotterization and is exact on a quantum computer with a finite number of Givens gate equals to the number of free parameters. The formulas obtained in this work also shed light on why and when optimization after Trotterization gives exact solutions in disentangled forms of unitary coupled cluster.

Title: Initial-State Typicality in Quantum Relaxation
Authors: Ruicheng Bao
Abstract: Relaxation in open quantum systems is fundamental to quantum science and technologies. Yet, the influence of the initial state on relaxation remains a central, largely unanswered question. Here, by systematically characterizing the relaxation behavior of generic initial states, we uncover a typicality phenomenon in high-dimensional open quantum systems: relaxation becomes nearly initial-state-independent as system size increases under verifiable conditions. Crucially, we prove this typicality for thermalization processes above a size-independent temperature. Our findings extend the typicality to open quantum dynamics, in turn identifying a class of systems where two widely used quantities -- the Liouvillian gap and the maximal relaxation time -- merit re-examination. We formalize this with two new concepts: the 'typical strong Mpemba effect' and the 'typical relaxation time'. Beyond these conceptual advances, our results provide practical implications: a scalable route to accelerating relaxation and a typical mixing-time benchmark that complements conventional worst-case metrics for quantum simulations and state preparation.

Title: Two variants of the friendship paradox: The condition for inequality between them
Authors: Sang Hoon Lee
Abstract: The friendship paradox -- the observation that, on average, one's friends have more friends than oneself -- admits two common formulations depending on whether averaging is performed over edges or over nodes. These two definitions, the "alter-based" and "ego-based" means, are often treated as distinct but related quantities. This paper establishes their exact analytical relationship, showing that the difference between them is governed by the degree-degree covariance normalized by the mean degree. Explicit examples demonstrate the three possible cases of positive, zero, and negative covariance, corresponding respectively to assortative, neutral, and disassortative mixing patterns. The derivation further connects the covariance form to the moment-based expression introduced by Kumar, Krackhardt, and Feld [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 121, e2306412121 (2024)], which involves the (-1)st, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd moments of the degree distribution. The two formulations are shown to be equivalent, as they should be: the moment-based representation expands the same structural dependence that the covariance form expresses in its most compact and interpretable form. The analysis thus unifies node-level and moment-level perspectives on the friendship paradox, offering both a pedagogically transparent derivation and a direct bridge to recent theoretical developments.
