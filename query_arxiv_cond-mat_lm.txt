Title: On the Jump Conditions for Shock Waves in Condensed Materials
Authors: Raj Kumar Anand
Abstract: In this article, we have proposed Rankine-Hugoniot (RH) boundary conditions at the normal shock front, which is passing through the condensed material. These RH conditions are quite general, and their convenient forms for the particle velocity, mass density, pressure, and temperature have been presented in terms of the upstream Mach number and the material parameters for the weak and the strong shocks, respectively. Finally, the effects on the mechanical quantities of the shock-compressed materials, e.g., titanium Ti6Al4V, stainless steel 304, aluminum 6061-T6, etc., have been discussed.

Title: Lattice Schwinger Model and Spacetime Supersymmetry
Authors: Yanting Cheng, Shang Liu
Abstract: Gauge theories in (1+1)D have attracted renewed attention partially due to their experimental realizations in quantum simulation platforms. In this work, we revisit the lattice massive Schwinger model and the (1+1)D lattice Abelian-Higgs model, uncovering previously overlooked universal features, including the emergence of a supersymmetric quantum critical point when the Maxwell term's coefficient changes sign. To facilitate the quantum simulation of these theories, we adopt a strategy of truncating the electric field eigenvalues to a finite subset, preserving the exact gauge and global symmetries. Our primary focus is the truncated lattice Schwinger model at $\theta=0$, a model not equivalent to familiar spin models. We find that upon reversing the sign of the Maxwell term, the second-order deconfinement-confinement transition can become first-order, and the two types of transitions are connected by a supersymmetric critical point in the tricritical Ising universality class. In the case of truncated abelian-Higgs model at $\theta=0$, which turns out to be equivalent to the quantum Blume-Capel model, the very existence of a deconfined phase requires a negative-sign Maxwell term. Similarly, there is a tricritical Ising point separating first-order and second-order phase transitions.

Title: Fractionalized Prethermalization in the One-Dimensional Hubbard Model
Authors: Anton Romen, Johannes Knolle, Michael Knap
Abstract: Prethermalization phenomena in driven systems are generally understood via a local Floquet Hamiltonian obtained from a high-frequency expansion. Remarkably, recently it has been shown that a driven Kitaev spin liquid with fractionalized excitations can realize a quasi-stationary state that is not captured by this paradigm. Instead distinct types of fractionalized excitations are characterized by vastly different temperatures-a phenomenon dubbed "fractionalized prethermalization". In our work, we analyze fractionalized prethermalization in a driven one-dimensional Hubbard model at strong coupling which hosts spin-charge fractionalization. At intermediate frequencies quasi-steady states emerge which are characterized by a low spin and high charge temperature with lifetimes set by two competing processes: the lifetime of the quasiparticles determined by Fermi's Golden rule and the exponential lifetime of the Floquet prethermal plateau. We classify drives into three categories, each giving rise to distinct (fractional) prethermalization dynamics. Resorting to a time-dependent variant of the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we systematically analyze how these drive categories are linked to the underlying driven Hubbard model, thereby providing a general understanding of the emergent thermalization dynamics. We discuss routes towards an experimental realization of this phenomenon in quantum simulation platforms.

Title: Fading ergodicity meets maximal chaos
Authors: Rafał Świętek, Patrycja Łydżba, Lev Vidmar
Abstract: Fading ergodicity provides a theoretical framework for understanding deviations from the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) near ergodicity-breaking transitions. In this work, we demonstrate that the breakdown of the ETH at the interaction-driven ergodicity-breaking critical point in the quantum sun model gives rise to to the maximally divergent fidelity susceptibility. We further extend our analysis to the energy-driven ergodicity-breaking transition associated with the many-body mobility edge. Specifically, we show that fidelity susceptibilities at energies away from the middle of the spectrum exhibit a divergent peak near the mobility edge. Finally, we argue that fading ergodicity provides a simple and accurate description of the ETH breakdown in the quantum sun model, which is accompanied with the emergence of a peak in fidelity susceptibility and the onset of maximal chaos at the ergodicity-breaking critical point.

Title: Imaging orbital Rashba induced charge transport anisotropy
Authors: Eylon Persky, Xi Wang, Giacomo Sala, Thierry C. van Thiel, Edouard Lesne, Alexander Lau, Mario Cuoco, Marc Gabay, Carmine Ortix, Andrea D. Caviglia, Beena Kalisky
Abstract: Identifying orbital textures and their effects on the electronic properties of quantum materials is a critical element in developing orbitronic devices. However, orbital effects are often entangled with the spin degree of freedom, making it difficult to uniquely identify them in charge transport phenomena. Here, we present a combination of scanning superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) current imaging, global transport measurements, and theoretical analysis, that reveals a direct contribution of orbital textures to the linear charge transport of 2D systems. Specifically, we show that in the LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface, which lacks both rotation and inversion symmetries, an anisotropic orbital Rashba coupling leads to conductivity anisotropy in zero magnetic field. We experimentally demonstrate this result by locally measuring the conductivity anisotropy, and correlating its appearance to the non-linear Hall effect, showing that the two phenomena have a common origin. Our results lay the foundations for an all--electrical probing of orbital currents in two-dimensional systems.

Title: Spin liquid state in Y-Kapellasite, Y$_3$Cu$_9$(OH)$_{19}$Cl$_8$ by external pressure controlled frustration
Authors: Dipranjan Chatterjee, Petr Doležal, Federico Abbruciati, Tobias Biesner, Katharina M. Zoch, Rustem Khasanov, Shams Sohel Islam, Guratinder Kaur, Seulki Roh, Francesco Capitani, Gaston Garbarino, Cornelius Krellner, Philippe Mendels, Edwin Kermarrec, Martin Dressel, Björn Wehinger, Andrej Pustogow, Fabrice Bert, Pascal Puphal
Abstract: Magnetic frustration is a key ingredient to prevent conventional ordering and, in combination with enhanced fluctuations in low dimensional quantum magnets, to stabilize the long sought spin liquid ground states. Most experimental spin liquid candidates inevitably deviate from perfectly frustrated models due to chemical and structural disorder, blurring the nature and origin of their ground states. Y-Kapellasite Y$_3$Cu$_9$(OH)$_{19}$Cl$_{8}$ realizes a chemically clean system with an underlying kagome sub-lattice. The crystals undergo the theoretically predicted magnetic in-plane (1/3 1/3) order from a subtle release of frustration due to a distortion of the kagome system realised by displaced Y atoms. By studying the effect of pressure on the structure and optical phonons, we show that this distortion is partially lifted by compression towards a more isotropic model of interactions, in a gradual manner, without structural transition. Using $\mu$SR, we further show that the magnetic ground state is surprisingly sensitive to the applied pressure for a mineral, and that under a moderate 2 GPa pressure, the frustration increase is sufficient to induce a fluctuating ground state. Suppressing long-range magnetic order via frustration tuning with pressure, in an ultraclean material, establishes a major step towards realizing a well-controlled spin liquid ground state.

Title: Quantifying the Complexity of Materials with Assembly Theory
Authors: Keith Y Patarroyo, Abhishek Sharma, Ian Seet, Ignas Packmore, Sara I. Walker, Leroy Cronin
Abstract: Quantifying the evolution and complexity of materials is of importance in many areas of science and engineering, where a central open challenge is developing experimental complexity measurements to distinguish random structures from evolved or engineered materials. Assembly Theory (AT) was developed to measure complexity produced by selection, evolution and technology. Here, we extend the fundamentals of AT to quantify complexity in inorganic molecules and solid-state periodic objects such as crystals, minerals and microprocessors, showing how the framework of AT can be used to distinguish naturally formed materials from evolved and engineered ones by quantifying the amount of assembly using the assembly equation defined by AT. We show how tracking the Assembly of repeated structures within a material allows us formalizing the complexity of materials in a manner accessible to measurement. We confirm the physical relevance of our formal approach, by applying it to phase transformations in crystals using the HCP to FCC transformation as a model system. To explore this approach, we introduce random stacking faults in closed-packed systems simplified to one-dimensional strings and demonstrate how Assembly can track the phase transformation. We then compare the Assembly of closed-packed structures with random or engineered faults, demonstrating its utility in distinguishing engineered materials from randomly structured ones. Our results have implications for the study of pre-genetic minerals at the origin of life, optimization of material design in the trade-off between complexity and function, and new approaches to explore material technosignatures which can be unambiguously identified as products of engineered design.

Title: Skyrmion-Skyrmionium Phase Separation and Laning Transitions via Spin-Orbit Torque Currents
Authors: N. P. Vizarim, J. C. Bellizotti Souza, C. J. O. Reichhardt, C. Reichhardt, P. A. Venegas, F. Béron
Abstract: Many driven binary systems can exhibit laning transitions when the two species have different mobilities, such as colloidal particles with opposite charges in electric fields. Another example is pedestrian or active matter systems, where particles moving in opposite directions form a phase-separated state that enhances the overall mobility. In this work, we use atomistic simulations to demonstrate that mixtures of skyrmions and skyrmioniums also exhibit pattern formation and laning transitions. Skyrmions move more slowly and at a finite Hall angle compared to skyrmioniums, which move faster and without a Hall effect. At low drives, the system forms a partially jammed phase where the skyrmionium is dragged by the surrounding skyrmions, resulting in a finite angle of motion for the skyrmionium. At higher drives, the system transitions into a laned state, but unlike colloidal systems, the lanes in the skyrmion skyrmionium mixture are tilted relative to the driving direction due to the intrinsic skyrmion Hall angle. In the laned state, the skyrmionium angle of motion is reversed when it aligns with the tilted lane structure. At even higher drives, the skyrmioniums collapse into skyrmions. Below a critical skyrmion density, both textures can move independently with few collisions, but above this density, the laning state disappears entirely, and the system transitions to a skyrmion-only state. We map out the velocity and Hall responses of the different textures and identify three distinct phases: partially jammed, laned, and skyrmion-only moving crystal states. We compare our results to recent observations of tilted laning phases in pedestrian flows, where chiral symmetry breaking in the particle interactions leads to similar behavior.

Title: Effect of hole-strain coupling on the eigenmodes of semiconductor-based nanomechanical systems
Authors: Ankang Liu, Mark Dykman
Abstract: Electron-phonon coupling can strongly affect the eigenmodes of nano- and micromechanical resonators. We study the effect of the coupling for $p$-doped semiconductor resonators. We show that the backaction from the strain-induced redistribution of the holes between and within the energy bands can lead to a nonmonotonic dependence of the modes' eigenfrequencies on temperature and to a strong mode nonlinearity that also nonmonotonically depends on temperature. Unexpectedly, we find that the nonlinearity can nonmonotonically depend on the hole density. We also briefly discuss the effect of the coupling to holes on the modes' decay rates. The results are compared with the experiment.

Title: Bound states in the continuum in cuprous oxide quantum wells
Authors: Angelos Aslanidis, Jörg Main, Patric Rommel, Stefan Scheel, Pavel A. Belov
Abstract: We propose a realistic semiconductor system containing bound states in the continuum (BICs) which allows for a practical realization. By varying the confinement strength of excitons in cuprous oxide quantum wells, we show that long-lived Rydberg states of the confined electron-hole pairs appear in the continuum background. The accuracy of calculations of the linewidths based on the coupled-channel Schrödinger equation with three channels and only few basis states is confirmed by a numerically exact solution employing a B-spline basis and the complex coordinate-rotation method. We argue that finite-sized cuprous oxide crystals, due to their large exciton binding energies, are a convenient platform for experimental identification of BICs.

Title: Atom identification in bilayer moire materials with Gomb-Net
Authors: Austin C. Houston, Sumner B. Harris, Hao Wang, Yu-Chuan Lin, David B. Geohegan, Kai Xiao, Gerd Duscher
Abstract: Moire patterns in van der Waals bilayer materials complicate the analysis of atomic-resolution images, hindering the atomic-scale insight typically attainable with scanning transmission electron microscopy. Here, we report a method to detect the positions and identity of atoms in each of the individual layers that compose bilayer heterostructures. We developed a deep learning model, Gomb-Net, which can distinguish atomic species in each individual layer, effectively deconvoluting the moire pattern to enable layer-specific mapping of strain and dopant distributions, unlike other methods which struggle with moire-induced complexity. Using this approach, we explored Se atom substitutional sites in a twisted fractional Janus WS2-WS2(1-x)Se2x heterostructure and found that layer specific implantation sites are unaffected by the moire pattern's local energetic or electronic modulation. This advancement enables atom-identification within material regimes where it was not possible before, opening new insights into previously inaccessible material physics.

Title: Exploring the mechanism of phase transitions between the hexagonal close-packed and the cuboidal structures
Authors: Andres Robles-Navarro, Shaun Cooper, Odile R. Smits, Peter Schwerdtfeger
Abstract: By introducing appropriate lattice parameters for a bi-lattice smoothly connecting the hexagonal close-packed (hcp) with the cuboidal structures, namely the body-centered (bcc) and the face centered cubic (fcc) lattices, we were able to map out the minimum energy path for a Burgers-Bain type of phase transition. We demonstrate that for three different models applied, i.e. the kissing hard-sphere model, the Lennard-Jones potential, and density functional theory for metallic lithium, the direct transition path is always from hcp to fcc with a separate path leading from fcc to bcc. This solves, at least for the models considered here, a long-standing controversy of whether or not fcc acts as an intermediate phase in martensitic type of phase transitions.

Title: Atomic Fermi superfluids with tunable pairing interactions under the influence of spin-dependent Rydberg molecular potentials
Authors: Chih-Chun Chien, Seth T. Rittenhouse, S. I. Mistakidis, H. R. Sadeghpour
Abstract: We explore the energy spectrum and eigenstates of two-component atomic Fermi superfluids with tunable pairing interactions in the presence of spin-dependent ultra long-range Rydberg molecule (ULRM) potentials, within the Bogoliubov-de Gennes formalism. The attractive ULRM potentials lead to local density accumulation, while their difference results in a local polarization potential and induces the in-gap Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states whose energies lie below the bulk energy gap. A transition from equal-population to population-imbalance occurs as the pairing strength falls below a critical value, accompanied by the emergence of local Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) like states characterized by out-of-phase wave functions and lower energies compared to the YSR states. The negative contribution emanating from the FFLO-like states also causes a sign change in the gap function within the ULRM potentials. Depending on the Rydberg state generating the ULRM potentials, the transition towards population-imbalance can be on either the BCS or the Bose-Einstein condensation side of the Fermi superfluid. Additionally, spin-polarized bound states arise along with oscillatory ``clumpy states" to compensate for the local density difference. Finally, we discuss possible experimental realizations and measurements of the composite Rydberg atom-Fermi superfluid system.

Title: Direct experimental measurement of many-body hydrodynamic interactions with optical tweezers
Authors: Dae Yeon Kim, Sachit G. Nagella, Kyu Hwan Choi, Sho C. Takatori
Abstract: Many-body hydrodynamic interactions (HIs) play an important role in the dynamics of fluid suspensions. While many-body HIs have been studied extensively using particle simulations, there is a dearth of experimental frameworks with which to quantify fluid-mediated multi-body interactions. To address this, we design an experimental method that utilizes optical laser tweezers for quantifying fluid-mediated colloidal interactions with exquisite precision and control. By inducing translation-rotation hydrodynamic coupling between trapped fluorescently-labeled colloids, we obtain a direct reporter of few- to many-body HIs experimentally. We leverage the torque-free nature of laser tweezers to enable sensitive measurements of signals between trapped colloids. First, we measure the pair HI between a stationary tracer probe and a translating particle as a function of their separation distance. We discover that our technique can precisely quantify distant fluid disturbances that are generated by ~2 pN of hydrodynamic force at 12 particle radii of separation. To study the effect of many-body HIs, we measure the rotational mobility of a probe in a three-particle setup and in a model material, a two-dimensional hexagonally-close-packed lattice, that undergoes oscillatory strain. Respectively, we discover that the probe's rotation can reverse in certain three-body configurations, and we find that rotational mobility in the crystalline array is strongly attenuated by particle rigidity. Experimental measurements are corroborated by microhydrodynamic theory and Stokesian Dynamics simulations with excellent agreement, highlighting our ability to measure accurately many-body HIs. Lastly, we extend our theoretical framework to manipulate colloidal-scale fluid flows. With experimental validation, we compute the required trajectory of a moving particle to induce a desired angular velocity of a probe.

Title: Strain energy enhanced room-temperature magnetocaloric effect in second-order magnetic transition materials
Authors: Xiaohe Liu, Ping Song, Sen Yao, Yuhao Lei, Ling Yang, Shenxiang Du, Yiran Deng, Defeng Guo
Abstract: Large magnetic entropy change (deltaSM) can realize a prominent heat transformation under the magnetic field and directly strengthen the efficacy of the magnetocaloric effect, which provides a pioneering environmentally friendly solid-state strategy to improve refrigeration capacities and efficiencies. The second-order magnetic transition (SOMT) materials have broader deltaSM peaks without thermal hysteresis compared with most first-order magnetic transition materials, making them highly attractive in magnetic refrigeration, especially in the room temperature range. Here, we report a significant enhancement of deltaSM at room temperature in single-crystal Mn5Ge3. In this SOMT system, we realize a 60% improvement of -deltaSM from 3.5 J/kgK to 5.6 J/kgK at T = 300K. This considerable enhancement of deltaSM is achieved by intentionally introducing strain energy through high-pressure constrained deformation. Both experimental results and Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the enhancement of deltaSM originates from the microscopic strain and lattice deformation induced by strain energy after deformation. This strain energy will reconstruct the energy landscape of this ferromagnetic system and enhance magnetization, resulting in a giant intensity of magnetocaloric responses. Our findings provide an approach to increase magnetic entropy change and may give fresh ideas for exploring advanced magnetocaloric materials.

Title: Unveiling resilient superconducting fluctuations in atomically thin NbSe$_2$ through Higgs mode spectroscopy
Authors: Yu Du, Gan Liu, Wei Ruan, Zhi Fang, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Ronghua Liu, Jian-Xin Li, Xiaoxiang Xi
Abstract: We report a combined electrical transport and optical study of the superconductivity in atomically thin NbSe$_2$. When subjected to an out-of-plane magnetic field, an anomalous metallic state emerges, characterized by a finite longitudinal resistance and a vanishing Hall resistance, suggesting the presence of particle-hole symmetry. We establish a superconducting Higgs mode in atomically thin samples, which reveals enduring superconducting fluctuations that withstand unexpectedly high reduced magnetic fields. These findings provide evidence of robust locally paired electrons in the anomalous metallic state, affirming its bosonic nature.

Title: Superconductivity and a van Hove singularity confined to the surface of a topological semimetal
Authors: Md Shafayat Hossain, Rajibul Islam, Zi-Jia Cheng, Zahir Muhammad, Qi Zhang, Zurab Guguchia, Jonas A. Krieger, Brian Casas, Yu-Xiao Jiang, Maksim Litskevich, Xian P. Yang, Byunghoon Kim, Tyler A. Cochran, Ilias E. Perakis, Fei Xue, Mehdi Kargarian, Weisheng Zhao, Luis Balicas, M. Zahid Hasan
Abstract: The interplay between electronic topology and superconductivity is the subject of great current interest in condensed matter physics. For example, superconductivity induced on the surface of topological insulators is predicted to be triplet in nature, while the interplay between electronic correlations and topology may lead to unconventional superconductivity as in twisted bilayer graphene. Here, we unveil an unconventional two-dimensional superconducting state in the recently discovered Dirac nodal line semimetal ZrAs2 which is exclusively confined to the top and bottom surfaces within the crystal's ab plane. As a remarkable consequence of this emergent state, we observe a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition, the hallmark of two-dimensional superconductivity. Notably, this is the first observation of a BKT transition on the surface of a three-dimensional system. Furthermore, employing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and first-principles calculations, we find that these same surfaces also host a two-dimensional van Hove singularity near the Fermi energy. The proximity of van Hove singularity to the Fermi level leads to enhanced electronic correlations contributing to the stabilization of superconductivity at the surface of ZrAs2, a unique phenomenon among topological semimetals. The surface-confined nature of the van Hove singularity, and associated superconductivity, realized for the first time, opens new avenues to explore the interplay between low-dimensional quantum topology, correlations, and superconductivity in a bulk material without resorting to the superconducting proximity effect.

Title: Spin separation and filtering assisted by topological corner states in the Kekulé lattice
Authors: Kai-Tong Wang, Hui Wang, Shijie Liu, Miaomiao Wei, Fuming Xu
Abstract: Higher-order topological corner states have been realized in two-dimensional Kekulé lattice, which can be further coupled with spin polarization through the implementation of local magnetization. In this work, we numerically investigate the spin-dependent transport properties assisted by topological corner states in the Kekulé lattice. By applying local magnetization and electric potential, the topological corner states are spin polarized with opposite spins localized at different corners, thereby demonstrating a spin-corner state locking mechanism. Transport characteristics, including transmission, local density of states, and local current density, are calculated for a two-terminal setup consisting of a diamond-shaped Kekulé lattice connected to two leads. When opposite local magnetization is applied to the corners, spin-up and spin-down electrons are perfectly separated, forming two spin-polarized conducting channels and leading to spin spatial separation. In the presence of identical local magnetization on both corners and an electric potential at one corner, the spin-polarized corner states can facilitate selective filtering of different spins and generate spin-polarized currents by tuning the energy. Furthermore, spin-resolved transmission diagrams as functions of both the Fermi energy and electric potential are presented, illustrating the global distribution of spin filtering through topological corner states.

Title: Large Spin Nernst Effect in Ni70Cu30 Alloy
Authors: Wen-Yuan Li, Chia-Hsi Lin, Guang-Yu Guo, Ssu-Yen Huang, Danru Qu
Abstract: The interplay among heat, spin, and charge is the central focus in spin caloritronic research. While the longitudinal heat-to-spin conversion via the spin Seebeck effect has been intensively studied, the transverse heat-to-spin conversion via the spin Nernst effect (SNE) has not been equally explored. One major challenge is the minuscule signals generated by the SNE, which are often mixed with the background noises. In this work, we overcome this difficulty by studying the thin films of Ni70Cu30 alloy with not only a sizable spin Hall angle but also a large Seebeck coefficient. We observe in the Ni70Cu30 alloy a large spin Nernst effect with an estimated spin Nernst angle ranging from -28% to -72%. In comparison, the spin Nernst angle for Pt is -8.2%. Our ab initio calculation reveals that the large spin Nernst conductivity in Ni70Cu30 is caused by the Fermi energy shift to the steepest slope of the spin Hall conductivity curve due to electron doping from 30% Cu. Our study provides critical directions in searching for materials with a large spin Nernst effect.

Title: Resolving the Thermal Paradox: Many-body localization or fractionalization?
Authors: Saikat Banerjee, Piers Coleman
Abstract: Thermal measurements of heat capacity and thermal conductivity in a wide range of insulators and superconductors exhibit a ``thermal paradox": a large linear specific heat reminiscent of neutral Fermi surfaces in samples that exhibit no corresponding linear temperature coefficient to the thermal conductivity. At first sight, these observations appear to support the formation of a continuum of thermally localized many-body excitations, a form of many-body localization that would be fascinating in its own right. Here, by mapping thermal conductivity measurements onto thermal RC circuits, we argue that the development of extremely long thermal relaxation times, a ``thermal bottleneck," is likely in systems with either many-body localization or neutral Fermi surfaces due to the large ratio between the electron and phonon specific heat capacities. We present a re-evaluation of thermal conductivity measurements in materials exhibiting a thermal paradox that can be used in future experiments to deliberate between these two exciting alternatives.

Title: General method for calculating transport properties of disordered mesoscopic systems based on the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism
Authors: Gaoyang Li, MiaoMiao Wei, Fuming Xu, Jian Wang
Abstract: Disorder scattering plays important roles in quantum transport as well as various Hall effects, including the second-order nonlinear Hall effect induced by Berry curvature dipole. Calculation of disorder-averaged transport properties usually requires substantial computational resources, especially for higher-order effects. Existing methods are either limited by approximation conditions or constrained by numerical stability, making it difficult to conveniently obtain average physical quantities over a wide range of disorder strength. In this work, we develop a general method for noninteracting system to obtain analytical expressions of disorder averages in finite orders of disorder strength. This method utilizes the Dyson equation to expand physical quantities expressed in terms of the Green's functions into series of disorder-averaged matrices, and the only approximation involved is the truncation of the Dyson equation. Therefore, this method not only avoids the brute force calculation of disorder samples, but also widely applies to different model systems, types of disorder, and the number of Green's functions in the expressions. We demonstrate the applicability of this general method by calculating averages of the linear conductance of a two-terminal system, the spin Hall conductance and the second-order nonlinear conductance of four-terminal Hall setups. It is found that truncation at the fourth order of disorder strength provides a reasonable accuracy and a convenient Padé treatment effectively extends its applicable range. Numerical results also confirms disorder enhancement of the second-order nonlinear Hall current in four-terminal systems. Moreover, more accurate predictions for a broader range of disorder strength can be achieved by including higher-order terms in a similar manner.

Title: Evidence of magnetoelastic coupling and magnetic phase coexistence in Mn$_{1.7}$Fe$_{1.3}$Si Heusler Alloy
Authors: Kulbhushan Mishra, Elaine T. Dias, Rajeev Joshi, A. D. Fortes, Christopher M. Howard, Rajeev Rawat, P. A. Bhobe
Abstract: Noncollinear metallic antiferromagnets, with their rapid spin dynamics, efficient spin transport, and distinctive spin textures, play a pivotal role in advancing the field of spintronics. In this study, we report a comprehensive investigation of the structural, magnetic, and transport properties of cubic Mn$_{1.7}$Fe$_{1.3}$Si Heusler compound. Temperature-dependent magnetization measurement reveals a paramagnetic to ferromagnetic transition at $T_C$ = 85 K, followed by a spin reorientation transition. Neutron diffraction data, analyzed as a function of temperature, demonstrates that the occurrence of a spin-reorientation transition is accompanied by magnetoelastic coupling, as evidenced by a change in unit cell volume below $T_C$. Magnetic structure refinement of the low-temperature neutron powder diffraction data confirms the canted antiferromagnetic ordering below 55 K. The metallic nature of the sample is confirmed by the gradual decrease in the $\rho$(T) with decreasing temperature. At low temperatures, a field-induced metamgnetic transition is observed in both, magnetization and magneto-transport measurements. The $H-T$ phase diagram shows a phase-coexistence region emerging at low temperatures for H $<$ 2.5 T. These findings provide valuable insights into the magnetic and transport behavior of the Heusler compounds, underscoring their potential for spintronic applications.

Title: Pressure-Induced Structural and Dielectric Changes in Liquid Water at Room Temperature
Authors: Yizhi Song, Xifan Wu
Abstract: Understanding the pressure-dependent dielectric properties of water is crucial for a wide range of scientific and practical applications. In this study, we employ a deep neural network trained on density functional theory data to investigate the dielectric properties of liquid water at room temperature across a pressure range of 0.1 MPa to 1000 MPa. We observe a nonlinear increase in the static dielectric constant $\epsilon_0$ with increasing pressure, a trend that is qualitatively consistent with experimental observations. This increase in $\epsilon_0$ is primarily attributed to the increase in water density under compression, which enhances collective dipole fluctuations within the hydrogen-bonding network as well as the dielectric response. Despite the increase in $\epsilon_0$, our results reveal a decrease in the Kirkwood correlation factor $G_K$ with increasing pressure. This decrease in $G_K$ is attributed to pressure-induced structural distortions in the hydrogen-bonding network, which weaken dipolar correlations by disrupting the ideal tetrahedral arrangement of water molecules.

Title: Quantifying Phase Magnitudes of Open-Source Focused-Probe 4D-STEM Ptychography Reconstructions
Authors: Toma Susi
Abstract: Accurate computational ptychographic phase reconstructions are enabled by fast direct-electron cameras with high dynamic ranges used for four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM). The availability of open software packages is making such analyses widely accessible, and especially when implemented in Python, easy to compare in terms of computational efficiency and reconstruction quality. In this contribution, I reconstruct atomic phase shifts from convergent-beam electron diffraction maps of pristine monolayer graphene, which is an ideal dose-robust uniform phase object, acquired on a Dectris ARINA detector installed in a Nion UltraSTEM 100 operated at 60 keV with a focused-probe convergence semi-angle of 34 mrad. For two different recorded maximum scattering angle settings, I compare a range of direct and iterative open-source phase reconstruction algorithms, evaluating their computational efficiency and tolerance to reciprocal-space binning and real-space thinning of the data. The quality of the phase images is assessed by quantifying the variation of atomic phase shifts using a robust parameter-based method revealing an overall agreement with some notable differences in the absolute magnitudes and the variation of the phases. Although such variation is not a major issue when analyzing data with many identical atoms, it does put limits on what level of precision can be relied upon for unique sites such as defects or dopants, which also tend to be more dose-sensitive. Overall, these findings and the accompanying open data and code provide useful guidance for the sampling required for desired levels of phase precision, and suggest particular care is required when relying on electron ptychography for quantitative analyses of atomic-scale electromagnetic properties.

Title: Removal of excess iron by annealing processes and emergence of bulk superconductivity in sulfur-substituted FeTe
Authors: Ryosuke Kurihara, Ryusuke Kogure, Tomotaka Ota, Yuto Kinoshita, Satoshi Hakamada, Masashi Tokunaga, Hiroshi Yaguchi
Abstract: There are several strategies to discover new superconductors. Growing new materials and applying high pressures can be the classic ways since superconductivity was found. Also, chemical processing, such as annealing, is another way to induce superconductivity in a non-superconducting material. Here, we show chemical processing effects in the non-superconducting material, sulfur-substituted FeTe. It has been known that superconductivity in S-substituted FeTe is induced by O$_2$ annealing. We revealed that hydrochloric acid etching and vacuum annealing for O$_2$-annealed samples made the quality of superconductivity higher by several physical property measurements. Furthermore, we visualized the superconducting regions by a magneto-optical imaging technique, indicating that the superconductivity in the processed sample was bulk. In this sample, we confirmed that the concentration of excess iron was reduced compared to that in the as-grown state. These results provide an important route to bulk superconductivity in S-substituted FeTe and its related iron-based compounds.

Title: Fractional-flux oscillations of Josephson critical currents in multi-gap superconductors: a test for unconventional superconductivity
Authors: M. Donaire, A. Cano
Abstract: Josephson-junction interferometry has played a pivotal role in uncovering unconventional superconductivity in the cuprates. Using a Ginzburg-Landau-like approach, we generalize previous results to the genuine multi-gap case. Thus, we show that fractional flux oscillations of the Josephson critical current can arise as a direct consequence of multi-gap superconductivity. These oscillations reveal key information about the underlying superconducting states, including the unconventional $s_\pm$-wave state. Thus, our findings suggest new phase-sensitive experiments to characterize the Cooper pairing of new emerging superconductors such as the nickelates.

Authors: Wilayat Khan, Alishba Tariq, Jan Minar, Sawera Durrani, Abdul Raziq, Sikander Azam, Khalid Saeed
Abstract: Nb3O2(OH) has emerged as a highly attractive photocatalyst based on its chemical stability, energetic band positions, and large active lattice sites. Compared to other various photocatalytic semiconductors, it can be synthesized easily. This study presents a systematic analysis of pristine and doped Nb3O7(OH) based on recent developments in related research. The current study summarizes the modeling approach and computationally used techniques for doped Nb3O7(OH) based photocatalysts, focusing on their structural properties, defects engineering, and band structure engineering. This study demonstrates that the Trans-Blaha modified Becke Johnson approximation (TB-mBJ) is an effective approach for optoelectronic properties of pristine and Ta/Sb-doped Nb3O7(OH). The generalized gradient approximation is used for structure optimization of all systems studied. Spin-orbit (SO) coupling is also applied to deal with the Ta f orbital and Sb d orbital in the Ta/Sb-doped systems. Doping shifts the energetic band positions and relocates the Fermi level i.e. both the valence band maximum and the conduction band minimum are relocated, decreasing the band gap from 1.7 eV (pristine), to 1.266 eV (Ta-doped)/1.203 eV (Sb-doped). Moreover, doped systems shift the optical threshold to the visible region. Transport properties like effective mass and electrical conductivity are calculated, reflecting that the mobility of charge carriers increases with the doping of Ta/Sb this http URL reduction in the band gap and red-shift in the optical properties of the Ta/Sb-doped Nb3O7(OH) to the visible region suggest their promising potential for photocatalytic activity and photoelectrochemical solar cells.

Title: Universal Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials are Ready for Solid Ion Conductors
Authors: Hongwei Du, Jian Hui, Lanting Zhang, Hong Wang
Abstract: With the rapid development of energy storage technology, high-performance solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) have become critical for next-generation lithium-ion batteries. These materials require high ionic conductivity, excellent electrochemical stability, and good mechanical properties to meet the demands of electric vehicles and portable electronics. However, traditional methods like density functional theory (DFT) and empirical force fields face challenges such as high computational costs, poor scalability, and limited accuracy across material systems. Universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) offer a promising solution with their efficiency and near-DFT-level this http URL study systematically evaluates six advanced uMLIP models (MatterSim, MACE, SevenNet, CHGNet, M3GNet, and ORBFF) in terms of energy, forces, thermodynamic properties, elastic moduli, and lithium-ion diffusion behavior. The results show that MatterSim outperforms others in nearly all metrics, particularly in complex material systems, demonstrating superior accuracy and physical consistency. Other models exhibit significant deviations due to issues like energy inconsistency or insufficient training data this http URL analysis reveals that MatterSim achieves excellent agreement with reference values in lithium-ion diffusivity calculations, especially at room temperature. Studies on Li3YCl6 and Li6PS5Cl uncover how crystal structure, anion disorder levels, and Na/Li arrangements influence ionic conductivity. Appropriate S/Cl disorder levels and optimized Na/Li arrangements enhance diffusion pathway connectivity, improving overall ionic transport performance.

Title: Monitoring Vibrational Evolution in Jahn-Teller Effect by Raman Imaging
Authors: Hai-Zhen Yu, Dingwei Chu, Yuanzhi Li, Li Wang, Yuzhi Song, Sai Duan, Chuan-Kui Wang, Zhen Xie
Abstract: The Jahn-Teller effect (JTE) reduces the geometrical symmetry of a system with degenerate electronic states via vibronic coupling, playing a pivotal role in molecular and condensed systems. In this Letter, we propose that vibrational resolved tip-enhanced Raman scattering images can visualize the vibrational evolutions in JTE in real space. Taking an experimentally viable single zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) molecule as a proof-of-principle example, not only the degenerate vibrational splitting but also the overlooked vibration mixing caused by the JTE in its anionic form can be straightforwardly characterized by Raman images. Leveraging Raman images, the controllable configuration of JTE distortion with partial isotopic substitution could be further identified. These findings establish a practical protocol to monitor the detailed vibrational evolutions when a single molecule experiences JTE, opening a door for visualization of spontaneous symmetry breaking in molecular and solid-state systems.

Title: Spontaneous in-plane anomalous Hall response observed in a ferromagnetic oxide
Authors: Shinichi Nishihaya, Yuta Matsuki, Haruto Kaminakamura, Yoshiya Murakami, Hiroaki Ishizuka, Masaki Uchida
Abstract: Recent observation of anomalous Hall effect (AHE) induced by magnetic field or spin magnetization lying in the Hall deflection plane has sparked interest in diverse mechanisms for inducing the Hall vector component perpendicular to the applied magnetic field. Such off-diagonal coupling, which is strictly constrained by symmetry of the system, provides new degrees of freedom for engineering Hall responses. However, spontaneous response as extensively studied for out-of-plane AHE remains unexplored. Here we elucidate in-plane AHE in a typical ferromagnetic oxide SrRuO$_3$. The (111)-orientated ultrathin films with in-plane easy axes of spin magnetization exhibit spontaneous AHE at zero field, which is intrinsically coupled to the in-plane spin magnetization and controllable via its direction. Systematic measurements by varying azimuthal and polar field angles further reveal complex Hall responses shaped by higher-order terms allowed by trigonal distortion of the films. Our findings highlight versatile and controllable in-plane Hall responses with out-of-plane orbital ferromagnetism.

Title: Phases and critical transport of the SU(N) Hofstadter-Hubbard model on the triangular lattice
Authors: Lu Zhang, Rongning Liu, Xue-Yang Song
Abstract: We study phases and transitions of a triangular Hubbard model subject to commensurate magnetic field, called the Hofstadter-Hubbard model. At filling one fermion per site, for the number of fermion flavors 2 <= N <= 4, we identify three distinct phases and calculate critical interaction strength from self-consistent mean-field approximation. Integer quantum Hall, chiral spin liquid, and valence bond solid (or stripe) states could be realized upon varying the Hubbard interaction U. We study the critical transport behavior using quantum Boltzmann equations for general N for the putative continuous transition from quantum Hall states to chiral spin liquid. The critical behavior serves as strong signatures of the critical theory and consequently of the existence of chiral spin liquid as the proximate phase.

Title: Modeling metamaterials by second-order rate-type constitutive relations between only the macroscopic stress and strain
Authors: Vít Průša, K. R. Rajagopal, Casey Rodriguez, Ladislav Trnka, Martin Vejvoda
Abstract: We propose a thermodynamically based approach for constructing effective rate-type constitutive relations describing finite deformations of metamaterials. The effective constitutive relations are formulated as second-order in time rate-type Eulerian constitutive relations between only the Cauchy stress tensor, the Hencky strain tensor and objective time derivatives thereof. In particular, there is no need to introduce additional quantities or concepts such as ``micro-level deformation'',``micromorphic continua'', or elastic solids with frequency dependent material properties. Moreover, the linearisation of the proposed fully nonlinear (finite deformations) constitutive relations leads, in Fourier/frequency space, to the same constitutive relations as those commonly used in theories based on the concepts of frequency dependent density and/or stiffness. From this perspective the proposed constitutive relations reproduce the behaviour predicted by the frequency dependent density and/or stiffness models, but yet they work with constant -- that is motion independent -- material properties. This is clearly more convenient from the physical point of view. Furthermore, the linearised version of the proposed constitutive relations leads to the governing partial differential equations that are particularly simple both in Fourier space as well as in physical space. Finally, we argue that the proposed fully nonlinear (finite deformations) second-order in time rate-type constitutive relations do not fall into traditional classes of models for elastic solids (hyperelastic solids/Green elastic solids, first-order in time hypoelastic solids), and that the proposed constitutive relations embody a \textit{new} class of constitutive relations characterising elastic solids.

Title: Multifunctional Altermagnet with Large Out-of-Plane Piezoelectric Response in Janus V$_{2}$AsBrO Monolayer
Authors: Qiuyue Ma, Busheng Wang, Guochun Yang, Yong Liu
Abstract: Altermagnetism has emerged as a third fundamental category of collinear magnetism, characterized by spin-splitting in symmetry-compensated collinear antiferromagnets, opening new frontiers in spintronics and condensed matter physics. Here, based on first-principles calculations, we propose a novel altermagnetic semiconductor, the asymmetric Janus V$_2$AsBrO monolayer, which exhibits a magnetic easy axis favoring the out-of-plane direction and a Néel temperature ($T_N$) exceeding room temperature. The system exhibits a strain-tunable piezovalley effect, generating valley polarization under uniaxial strain. Notably, hole doping under uniaxial strain generates a net magnetization ($M$) through a piezomagnetic mechanism. Additionally, the broken inversion symmetry endows the monolayer with a substantial out-of-plane piezoelectric coefficient $d_{31}$ (2.19 pm/V), presenting broad prospects for the development and design of novel piezoelectric devices. Our findings provide a promising candidate material for the advancement of 2D multifunctional devices in nanoelectronics, spintronics, valleytronics, and piezoelectrics.

Title: Transverse vortices induced by modulated granular shear flows of elongated particles
Authors: Sára Lévay, Philippe Claudin, Ellák Somfai, Tamás Börzsönyi
Abstract: We have performed DEM simulations of elongated grains in a shear cell for various particle aspect ratios and contact frictions, with an additional heterogeneous force perturbation in the flow direction. For a perturbation in the form of a single Fourier mode, we show that the response of the system consists of transverse secondary flows that average onto a pattern of four vortices. We have also theoretically studied this phenomenon by generalizing the granular rheology $\mu(I)$ to the case of elongated grains and computing the linear response to such a perturbation. Even if the agreement between theory and simulations remains qualitative only, we can reproduce and understand the inversion of the vortex pattern when the cell aspect ratio is increased from a vertically to a horizontally elongated cell shape, emphasizing the key role of the second normal stress difference as well as the cell geometry.

Title: Balloon regime: Drop elasticity leads to complete rebound
Authors: D. Díaz, A.G. Balasubramanian, K. Amini, X. Li, F. Lundell, S. Bagheri, O. Tammisola
Abstract: When a viscoelastic shear-thinning drop of high elasticity hits a superhydrophobic surface, a growing tail-like filament vertically emerges from the impact spot as the contact line recedes. Notably, the ligament transitions into a balloon-like shape before detaching (Balloon regime) completely from the surface. Here, we attribute the ligament formation to the liquid impalement upon impact into the surface protrusion spacing. Our findings reveal that ligament formation can be controlled by tuning the roughness and surface wettability. We show that ligament stretching mainly depends on inertia and gravity, whereas the high elasticity prevents the ligament break up, enabling complete rebounds.

Title: The speed of sound and elastic properties of single crystals of inorganic and hybrid lead-free iodide perovskites obtained by femtosecond transient optical reflectivity
Authors: Giuseppe Ammirati, Patrick O Keeffe, Stefano Turchini, Daniele Catone, Alessandra Paladini, Francesco Toschi, Stevan Gavranovic, Jan Pospisil, Giovanni Mannino, Salvatore Valastro, Faustino Martelli
Abstract: Optoelectronic devices operate under continuous thermal stress that may influence both long-term stability and optical properties of the active material. It is therefore useful to know the elastic properties of the active materials. In general, the elastic constants of a material may be deduced by the measurement of the speed of sound in that material. In this work, we report on the measurements of the speed of sound in three lead-free halide perovskites, namely the inorganic Cs3Bi2I9 and the hybrid MA3Bi2I9 and MA3Sb2I9, by means of femtosecond transient optical reflectivity that shows oscillations of the signal intensity that are related to the strain field caused by the photoexcitation of electron-hole pairs. The values of the speed of sound thus obtained have allowed us to extract the elastic constant, c11, along the propagation direction of the light. The c11 values indicate a lower stiffness of the hybrid materials, an important aspect when designing optoelectronic devices.

Title: Softened Spin Waves in Films with Perpendicular Magnetic Anisotropy: Sombrero-Like Dispersion, Negative Reflection, Bi-, and Trireflection
Authors: Nikodem Leśniewski, Yuliya S. Dadoenkova, Florian F. L. Bentivegna, Paweł Gruszecki
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the effect of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) on spin wave (SW) dynamics at low magnetic fields. PMA exerts an in-plane torque on magnetization, counteracting exchange, dipolar, and Zeeman torques, thereby significantly transforming SW dynamics. In ultrathin films, sombrero-like dispersion relation facilitates bireflection and negative reflection of SWs, while in thicker films we demonstrate anti-Larmor precession, cowboy-hat-like dispersion relation, and trireflection of SWs. These results open up new opportunities to explore wave phenomena beyond magnonics.

Title: Boson-Gutzwiller Quantum liquids on a lattice
Authors: Daniel Pérez-Cruz, Manuel Valiente
Abstract: We consider one-dimensional, interacting spinless bosons on a tight-binding lattice described by the Bose-Hubbard model. Besides attractive on-site two-body interactions, we include a three-body repulsive term such that the competition between these two forces allows the formation of self-bound liquid states. We investigate the properties of this system using the Gutzwiller approximation, showing that, indeed, this mean-field approach also supports liquid states. We find that for densities lower than the equilibrium density, the Gutzwiller method, and other mean-field approaches -- such as the Gross-Pitaevskii theory -- feature a sharp transition to the vacuum state. This, however, is avoided by considering local minima of the functional in the standard manner. We also study the excitation spectrum, and calculate the speed of sound, in full agreement with the usual expression obtained from the thermodynamic equation of state. We study their corresponding quantum droplets variationally and find that the results behave in accordance with the one-dimensional liquid drop model.

Title: Microwave pulse transparency in Flux-qubit based superconducting quantum metamaterial
Authors: S. Galovic, Z. Ivic, V. Nikolic, Z. Przulj, D. Chevizovich
Abstract: We consider the propagation of a classical microwave pulse through a simple setup of a quantum metamaterial composed of a large number of three-Josephson-junction flux qubits. We find that population inversion and electromagnetic waves propagate together as two-component nonlinear waves, exhibiting distinct features depending on the initial preparation of the qubit subsystem and the strength of the "matter"-light interaction. Three different regimes are observed. In the limit of weak nonlinearity, when all qubits are initially prepared in either the clockwise or counterclockwise persistent current state, population inversion undergoes coherent Rabi-like oscillations, with a complete transfer between these two opposite states. As nonlinearity approaches unity, the transition dynamics lose their oscillatory nature, and the system rapidly becomes frozen in a state of zero population inversion, where each qubit is trapped in a superposition with equal probabilities of clockwise and counterclockwise polarity. In the overcritical regime, population inversion exhibits pulsating behavior, but without complete transfer. In the extreme coupling limit, population inversion undergoes small-amplitude oscillations around its initial value, while the pulse amplitude oscillates around zero, indicating pulse stopping.

Title: Energy diffusion in the long-range interacting spin systems
Authors: Hideaki Nishikawa, Keiji Saito
Abstract: We investigate energy diffusion in long-range interacting spin systems, where the interaction decays algebraically as $V(r) \propto r^{-\alpha}$ with the distance $r$ between the sites. We consider prototypical spin systems, the transverse Ising model, and the XYZ model in the $D$-dimensional lattice with finite $\alpha >D$ which guarantees the thermodynamic extensivity. In one dimension, both normal and anomalous diffusion are observed, where the anomalous diffusion is attributed to anomalous enhancement of the amplitude of the equilibrium current correlation. We prove the power-law clustering property of arbitrary orders of joint cumulants in general dimensions. Applying this theorem to equal-time current correlations, we further prove several theorems leading to the statement that the sufficient condition for normal diffusion in one dimension is $\alpha > 3/2$ regardless of the models. The fluctuating hydrodynamics approach consistently explains Lévy diffusion for $\alpha < 3/2$, which implies the condition is optimal. In higher dimensions of $D \geq 2$, normal diffusion is indicated as long as $\alpha > D$. Pecular behavior for $\alpha <D$ is also discussed.

Title: Single-molecule phosphorescence and intersystem crossing in a coupled exciton-plasmon system
Authors: Abhishek Grewal, Hiroshi Imada, Kuniyuki Miwa, Miyabi Imai-Imada, Kensuke Kimura, Rafael Jaculbia, Klaus Kuhnke, Klaus Kern, Yousoo Kim
Abstract: Scanning the sharp metal tip of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) over a molecule allows tuning the coupling between the tip plasmon and a molecular fluorescence emitter. This allows access to local variations of fluorescence field enhancement and wavelength shifts, which are central parameters for characterizing the plasmon-exciton coupling. Performing the same for phosphorescence with molecular scale resolution remains a significant challenge. In this study, we present the first investigation of phosphorescence from isolated Pt-Phthalocyanine molecules by analyzing tip-enhanced emission spectra in both current-induced and laser-induced phosphorescence. The latter directly monitors singlet-to-triplet state intersystem crossing of a molecule below the tip. The study paves the way to a detailed understanding of triplet excitation pathways and their potential control at sub-molecular length scales. Additionally, the coupling of organic phosphors to plasmonic structures is a promising route for the improving light-emitting diodes.

Title: Light-induced dissipationless states in magnetic topological insulators with hexagonal warping
Authors: Mohammad Shafiei, Milorad V. Milošević
Abstract: Magnetic impurities in topological insulators (TIs) induce backscattering via magnetic torque, unlike pristine TIs where spin-orbit locking promotes dissipationless surface states. Here we reveal that one can suppress that unwanted backscattering and dissipation in magnetic TIs using high-frequency linearly polarized light (LPL). By carefully considering the hexagonal warping of the Fermi surface of the TI, we demonstrate how the coupling between Dirac surface states and LPL can effectively reduce backscattering on magnetic dopants, enhance carrier mobility and suppress resistance, even entirely. These findings open up avenues for designing ultra low-power sensing and spintronic technology.

Title: Panoscopic non-equilibrium fluctuation identity
Authors: Juliana Caspers, Karthika Krishna Kumar, Clemens Bechinger, Matthias Krüger
Abstract: Quantifying and characterizing fluctuations far away from equilibrium is a challenging task. We introduce and experimentally confirm an identity for a driven classical system, relating the different non-equilibrium cumulants of the observable conjugate to the driving protocol. The identity is valid from micro- to macroscopic length scales, and it encompasses the fluctuation dissipation theorem. We apply it in experiments of a Brownian probe particle confined and driven by an optical potential and suspended in a nonlinear and non-Markovian fluid.

Title: Identities for nonlinear memory kernels
Authors: Juliana Caspers, Matthias Krüger
Abstract: Perturbing a system far away from equilibrium via a time dependent protocol can formally be described by a nonlinear Volterra series expansion. Here we derive identities for the nonlinear memory kernels arising in such nonlinear expansion, including the possibility of a nonlinear coupling between perturbation and system. These identities rely on local detailed balance, and they include the fluctuation dissipation theorem as the lowest order identity. We test them in simulations for driven over- and underdamped Brownian particles. These identities for memory kernels can be recast in a series relation for the non-equilibrium cumulants of the observable conjugate to the driving and the observable described by the Volterra series.

Title: THz electric field control of spins in collinear antiferromagnet Cr$_{2}$O$_{3}$
Authors: V. R. Bilyk, R. M. Dubrovin, A. K. Zvezdin, A. I. Kirilyuk, A. V. Kimel
Abstract: The idea to find a magnet that responds to an electric field as efficiently as to its magnetic counterpart has long intrigued people's minds and recently became a cornerstone for future energy efficient and nano-scalable technologies for magnetic writing and information processing. In contrast to electric currents, a control by electric fields promises much lower dissipations and in contrast to magnetic fields, electric fields are easier to apply to a nanoscale bit. Recently, the idea to find materials and mechanisms facilitating a strong and simultaneously fast response of spins to electric field has fueled an intense research interest to electromagnons in non-collinear antiferromagnets. Here we show that THz spin resonance at the frequency 0.165 THz in collinear antiferromagnet Cr$_{2}$O$_{3}$, which does not host any electromagnons, can be excited by both THz magnetic and electric fields. The mechanisms result in comparable effects on spin dynamics, when excited by freely propagating electromagnetic wave, but have different dependencies on the orientation of the applied THz electric field and the antiferromagnetic Néel vector. Hence this discovery opens up new chapters in the research areas targeting to reveal novel principles for the fastest and energy efficient information processing - ultrafast magnetism, antiferromagnetic spintronics, and THz magnonics.

Title: High-accuracy evaluation of non-thermal magnetic states beyond spin-wave theory: applications to higher-energy states
Authors: Wesley Roberts, Michael Vogl, Roderich Moessner, Gregory A. Fiete
Abstract: We present an approximation scheme based on selective Hilbert space truncation for characterizing non-thermal states of magnetic systems beyond spin-wave theory. We study applications to states that are inaccessible through linear spin-wave theory, such as multi-magnon states and higher-energy states. Our approach is based on the existence of an exact representation of spin operators in terms of finite-order polynomials of bosonic operators. It can be applied to systems with and without a magnetically ordered ground state. The approximation exactly diagonalizes the bosonic Hamiltonian restricted to particular boson occupation subspaces, improving the conventional linear spin-wave approach and exponentially reducing the computing time relative to exact diagonalization schemes. As a test case, we apply the approach to a prototypical one-dimensional model - an XXZ spin chain with an applied magnetic field and antisymmetric exchange coupling. Here the antisymmetric coupling introduces a continuous parameter to tune the system away from its exactly solvable limit. We find excellent agreement between numerically exact eigenstates and eigenvalues and those found via the approximation scheme. Our approach applies not just to higher lying states but also to boson bound states, which could make them more accessible to theoretical predictions for comparison with experiment.

Title: Low-Defect Quantum Dot Lasers Directly Grown on Silicon Exhibiting Low Threshold Current and High Output Power at Elevated Temperatures
Authors: Konstantinos Papatryfonos, Jean-Christophe Girard, Mingchu Tang, Huiwen Deng, Alwyn J. Seeds, Christophe David, Guillemin Rodary, Huiyun Liu, David R. Selviah
Abstract: The direct growth of III-V materials on silicon is a key enabler for developing monolithically integrated lasers, offering substantial potential for ultra-dense photonic integration in vital communications and computing technologies. However, the III-V/Si lattice and thermal expansion mismatch pose significant hurdles, leading to defects that degrade lasing performance. This study overcomes this challenge, demonstrating InAs/GaAs-on-Si lasers that perform on par with top-tier lasers on native GaAs substrates. This is achieved through a newly developed epitaxial approach comprising a series of rigorously optimised growth strategies. Atomic-resolution scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy experiments reveal exceptional material quality in the active region, and elucidate the impact of each growth strategy on defect dynamics. The optimised III-V-on-silicon ridge-waveguide lasers demonstrate a continuous-wave threshold current as low as 6 mA and high-temperature operation reaching 165 °C. At 80 °C, critical for data centre applications, they maintain a 12-mA threshold and 35 mW output power. Furthermore, lasers fabricated on both Si and GaAs substrates using identical processes exhibit virtually identical average threshold current. By eliminating the performance limitations associated with the GaAs/Si mismatch, this study paves the way for robust and high-density integration of a broad spectrum of critical III-V photonic technologies into the silicon ecosystem.

Title: Superballistic paradox in electron fluids: Evidence of tomographic transport
Authors: Jorge Estrada-Álvarez, Elena Díaz, Francisco Domínguez-Adame
Abstract: Electron hydrodynamics encompasses the exotic fluid-like behavior of electrons in two-dimensional materials such as graphene. It accounts for superballistic conduction, also known as the Gurzhi effect, where increasing temperature reduces the electrical resistance. In analogy with conventional fluids, the Gurzhi effect is only expected in the hydrodynamic regime, with the decrease in the resistance occurring at intermediate temperatures. Nonetheless, experiments on electron fluids consistently show that superballistic conduction starts at close-to-zero temperatures. To address this paradox, we study hydrodynamic flow, and we find that replacing the classical dynamics with tomographic dynamics, where only head-on collisions are allowed between electrons, solves the dilemma. The latter strengthens superballistic conduction, with potential applications in low-dissipation devices, and explains its differences with the Molenkamp effect and conventional fluids dynamics. Our study reveals that the superballistic paradox is resolved by considering the electrons not as classical particles but as fermions.

Title: Giant vortex in a harmonically-trapped rotating dipolar $^{164}$Dy condensate
Authors: Luis E. Young-S., S. K. Adhikari
Abstract: We demonstrate the formation of dynamically stable giant vortices in a harmonically-trapped strongly dipolar $^{164}$Dy Bose-Einstein condensate under rotation around the polarization direction of dipolar atoms, employing the numerical solution of an improved mean-field model including a Lee-Huang-Yang-type interaction, meant to stop a collapse at high atom density. These giant vortices are stationary, obtainable by imaginary-time propagation using a Gaussian initial state, while the appropriate phase of the giant vortex is imprinted on the initial wave function. The dynamical stability of the giant vortices is established by real-time propagation during a long interval of time after a small change of a parameter.

Title: Variationally optimizing infinite projected entangled-pair states at large bond dimensions: A split-CTMRG approach
Authors: Jan Naumann, Erik Lennart Weerda, Jens Eisert, Matteo Rizzi, Philipp Schmoll
Abstract: Projected entangled-pair states (PEPS) have become a powerful tool for studying quantum many-body systems in the condensed matter and quantum materials context, particularly with advances in variational energy optimization methods. A key challenge within this framework is the computational cost associated with the contraction of the two-dimensional lattice, crucial for calculating state vector norms and expectation values. The conventional approach, using the corner transfer matrix renormalization group (CTMRG), involves combining two tensor network layers, resulting in significant time and memory demands. In this work, we introduce an alternative "split-CTMRG" algorithm, which maintains separate PEPS layers and leverages new environment tensors, reducing computational complexity while preserving accuracy. Benchmarks on quantum lattice models demonstrate substantial speedups for variational energy optimization, rendering this method valuable for large-scale PEPS simulations.

Title: Electromagnon signatures of a metastable multiferroic state
Authors: Blake S. Dastrup, Zhuquan Zhang, Peter R. Miedaner, Yu-Che Chien, Young Sun, Yan Wu, Huibo Cao, Edoardo Baldini, Keith A. Nelson
Abstract: Magnetoelectric multiferroic materials, particularly type-II multiferroics where ferroelectric polarizations arise from magnetic order, offer significant potential for the simultaneous control of magnetic and electric properties. However, it remains an open question as to how the multiferroic ground states are stabilized on the free-energy landscape in the presence of intricate competition between the magnetoelectric coupling and thermal fluctuations. In this work, by using terahertz time-domain spectroscopy in combination with an applied magnetic field, photoexcitation, and single-shot detection, we reveal the spectroscopic signatures of a magnetic-field-induced metastable multiferroic state in a hexaferrite. This state remains robust until thermal influences cause the sample to revert to the original paraelectric state. Our findings shed light on the emergence of metastable multiferroicity and its interplay with thermal dynamics.

Title: Impurity-induced moment freezing in NaFe$_x$Ru$_{1-x}$O$_2$
Authors: Alon Hendler Avidor, Brenden R. Ortiz, Paul M. Sarte, Qiang Zhang, Stephen D. Wilson
Abstract: We report the impact of magnetic impurity substitution on the quantum disordered magnetic ground state of NaRuO$_2$. Local $S=5/2$ moments are introduced into the frustrated triangular lattice of $J_{eff}=1/2$ Ru moments via Fe-substitution in NaFe$_x$Ru$_{1-x}$O$_2$, and the evolution of the magnetic ground state is reported. Local spin freezing associated with conventional spin glass behavior is observed upon Fe substitution, marking an impurity-induced freezing of the primarily dynamic magnetic ground state in NaRuO$_2$. Furthermore, local Fe moments induce a Curie-Weiss magnetic behavior in the uniform magnetic susceptibility, and the local moment magnitude is best described by dynamic Ru moments polarized about impurity sites. Our results establish an impurity-doping phenomenology consistent with inherently dynamic moments in NaRuO$_2$ that are pinned by local magnetic impurities, similar to ``swiss cheese" models of impurity-substituted copper oxides.

Title: Stretching theory of Hookean metashells
Authors: Luca Giomi
Abstract: Despite being governed by the familiar laws of Hookean mechanics, elastic shells patterned with an internal structure (i.e. metashells) exhibit a wealth of unusual mechanical properties with no counterparts in unstructured materials. Here I show that much of this behavior can be captured by a real-valued analog of the inhomogeneous Schrödinger equation, with the lateral pressure experienced by the internal structure in the role of the wave function. In the fine structure limit $-$ i.e. when the length scale associated with the internal structure is much smaller than the local radius of curvature $-$ this approach reveals the existence of localized states, in which elastic deformations are prevented to diffuse away from their origin, thereby allowing the internal structure to smoothly adapt to the intrinsic geometry of the metashell. Leveraging on an analogy with scattering states in nearly free electrons, I further show that periodic metashells, obtained from the repetition of the same structural unit periodically in space, support elastic Bloch waves, corresponding to stationary periodic configurations of the internal structure and characterized by a geometry-dependent band structure. When applied to crystalline monolayers, this approach provides a generalization of the elastic theory of interacting topological defect to compressible systems.

Title: Gapping the spin-nodal planes of an anisotropic p-wave magnet to induce a large anomalous Hall effect

Abstract: Antiferromagnets with spin splitting in the electronic structure are desired for novel spintronic phenomena in materials with nearly zero net magnetization. One of the simplest spin-split antiferromagnetic states, the $p$-wave magnet, is proposed as a result of collective instability of electron gases. Following a more recent theoretical proposal without strong electron correlations, we here report a material with the symmetry constraints for $p$-wave magnetism of conduction electrons in momentum space, based on a texture of magnetic moments in direct space. Our resonant X-ray scattering reveals coplanar, lattice-locked antiferromagnetism that satisfies the required conditions for a $p$-wave magnet: it breaks space inversion, but preserves time-reversal ($T$) symmetry up to a positional shift in direct space. Consistent with theoretical predictions, the electric conductivity is characteristically anisotropic in this $p$-wave magnet. In conducting magnets, the coupling of magnetic spins and freely moving electrons favors small distortions of the $p$-wave state, slightly breaking the $T$ symmetry and inducing a tiny net magnetization. In our material, this gentle symmetry breaking induces an anomalous Hall effect (AHE) with a giant anomalous Hall conductivity for a bulk antiferromagnet, $\sigma_{xy}>600\,$S/cm (Hall angle $>3\,\%$). The $p$-wave magnet has characteristic spin-nodal planes, and such a giant AHE can be attributed to hybridization of electron bands around these nodal regions due to $T$ breaking.

Title: Iterative quantum optimisation with a warm-started quantum state
Authors: Haomu Yuan, Songqinghao Yang, Crispin H. W. Barnes
Abstract: We provide a method to prepare a warm-started quantum state from measurements with an iterative framework to enhance the quantum approximate optimisation algorithm (QAOA). The numerical simulations show the method can effectively address the "stuck issue" of the standard QAOA using a single-string warm-started initial state described in [Cain et al., 2023]. When applied to the $3$-regular MaxCut problem, our approach achieves an improved approximation ratio, with a lower bound that iteratively converges toward the best classical algorithms for $p=1$ standard QAOA. Additionally, in the context of the discrete global minimal variance portfolio (DGMVP) model, simulations reveal a more favourable scaling of identifying the global minimal compared to the QAOA standalone, the single-string warm-started QAOA and a classical constrained sampling approach.

Title: A tutorial for mesoscale computer simulations of lipid membranes: tether pulling, tubulation and fluctuation
Authors: Maitane Muñoz-Basagoiti, Felix Frey, Billie Meadowcroft, Miguel Amaral, Adam Prada, Anđela Šarić
Abstract: Lipid membranes and membrane deformations are a long-standing area of research in soft matter and biophysics. Computer simulations have complemented analytical and experimental approaches as one of the pillars in the field. However, setting up and using membrane simulations can come with barriers due to the multidisciplinary effort involved and the vast choice of existing simulations models. In this review, we introduce the non-expert reader to coarse-grained membrane simulations (CGMS) at the mesoscale. Firstly, we give a concise overview of the modelling approaches to study fluid membranes, together with guidance to more specialized references. Secondly, we provide a conceptual guide on how to develop CGMS. Lastly, we construct a hands-on tutorial on how to apply CGMS, by providing a pedagogical examination of tether pulling, tubulation and fluctuations with three different membrane models, and discussing them in terms of their scope and how resource-intensive they are. To ease the reader's venture into the field, we provide a repository with ready-to-run tutorials.

Abstract: The confinement of electromagnetic radiation to subwavelength scales relies on strong light-matter interactions. In the infrared (IR) and terahertz (THz) spectral ranges, phonon polaritons are commonly employed to achieve extremely subdiffractional light confinement, with much lower losses as compared to plasmon polaritons. Among these, hyperbolic phonon polaritons in anisotropic materials offer a highly promising platform for light confinement, which, however, typically plateaus at values of {\lambda}0/100, with {\lambda}0 being the free-space incident wavelength. In this study, we report on ultraconfined phonon polaritons in hafnium-based dichalcogenides with confinement factors exceeding {\lambda}0/250 in the terahertz spectral range. This extreme light compression within deeply sub-wavelength thin films is enabled by the unprecedented magnitude of the light-matter coupling strength in these compounds, and the natural hyperbolicity of HfSe2 in particular. Our findings emphasize the critical role of light-matter coupling for polariton confinement, which for phonon polaritons in polar dielectrics is dictated by the transverse-longitudinal optic phonon energy splitting. Our results demonstrate transition metal dichalcogenides as an enabling platform for THz nanophotonic applications that push the limits of light control.

Title: The N-link model for slender rods in a viscous fluid: well-posedness and convergence to classical elastohydrodynamics equations
Authors: Clément Moreau (CNRS,LS2N,Nantes Univ - ECN,IMT Atlantique,Nantes Univ), François Alouges (CB), Aline Lefebvre-Lepot (CNRS,CB), Jessie Levillain (CMAP,CNES,INSA Toulouse)
Abstract: Flexible fibers at the microscopic scale, such as flagella and cilia, play essential roles in biological and synthetic systems. The dynamics of these slender filaments in viscous flows involve intricate interactions between their mechanical properties and hydrodynamic drag. In this paper, considering a 1D, planar, inextensible Euler-Bernoulli rod in a viscous fluid modeled by Resistive Force Theory, we establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions for the $N$-link model, a mechanical model, designed to approximate the continuous filament with rigid segments. Then, we prove the convergence of the $N$-link model's solutions towards the solutions to classical elastohydrodynamics equations of a flexible slender rod. This provides an existence result for the limit model, comparable to those by Mori and Ohm [Nonlinearity, 2023], in a different functional context and with different methods. Due to its mechanical foundation, the discrete system satisfies an energy dissipation law, which serves as one of the main ingredients in our proofs. Our results provide mathematical validation for the discretization strategy that consists in approximating a continuous filament by the mechanical $N$-link model, which does not correspond to a classical approximation of the underlying PDE.

Title: Theory of enhanced-by-coincidence neural information transmission
Authors: Miguel Ibáñez-Berganza, Giulio Bondanelli, Stefano Panzeri
Abstract: The activity of neurons within brain circuits has been ubiquitously reported to be correlated. The impact of these correlations on brain function has been extensively investigated. Correlations can in principle increase or decrease the information that neural populations carry about sensory stimuli, but experiments in cortical areas have mostly reported information-limiting correlations, which decrease the information encoded in the population. However, a second stream of evidence suggests that temporal correlations between the spiking activity of different neurons may increase the impact of neural activity downstream, implying that temporal correlations affect both the encoding of information and its downstream readout. The principle of how encoding and readout combine are still unclear. Here, we consider a model of transmission of stimulus information encoded in pre-synaptic input spike trains with information-limiting time-correlations to the output firing of a post-synaptic biologicaly-plausible leaky integrate and fire (LIF) readout neuron. We derive an analytical solution of the model in the diffusion approximation, in which the encoding spiking activity is treated as a continuous-time stochastic variable. An ansatz based on a separation of timescales allows us compute the stimulus information transmitted to the readout over a broad range of parameters. Our analytical results reveal that, for sufficiently low input firing rates, large enough difference in input stimulus-specific activity, and moderately large input temporal correlations, the stimulus discriminability of the firing of the LIF readout neuron can be enhanced by the presence of input time correlations, despite they decrease the stimulus information encoded in its inputs.

Title: Planckian Bounds From Local Uncertainty Relations
Authors: Saurish Chakrabarty, Zohar Nussinov
Abstract: We introduce ``local uncertainty relations'' in thermal many-body systems, from which fundamental bounds in quantum systems can be derived. These lead to universal non-relativistic speed limits (independent of interaction range) and transport coefficient bounds (e.g., those of the diffusion constant and viscosity) that are compared against experimental data.

Title: Modeling biases in binary decision-making within the generalized nonlinear q-voter model
Authors: Maciej Doniec, Pratik Mullick, Parongama Sen, Katarzyna Sznajd-Weron
Abstract: Binary decision frameworks are widely used in the social sciences, including management and economics, to understand collective behavior. In group decision-making, opinions evolve through social influence, shaping outcomes that lead to either consensus or polarization. The $q$ voter model, also known as the non-linear voter model, has been extensively studied in this context. However, the impact of an individual's current opinion on their future stance has been largely overlooked. To fill this gap, we introduce a generalized model in which an agent's opinion depends not only on its neighbors but also on its own state. As in the original $q$-voter model, a unanimous influence group of size $q$ causes the agent to adopt the group's opinion. However, if the group is not unanimous, the agent will change its opinion with a probability influenced by its current state. This introduces a bias toward a choice that reflects external factors such as politics or advertising. Our model generalizes previous $q$-voter models, including the original one, while allowing for a wider range of scenarios. We analyze the model on a complete graph, deriving the phase diagram and the exit probability for finite systems. We support our analytical approach with Monte Carlo simulations and show that they overlap even for small systems of size $N=64$. Our results show that the exit probability depends on $q$. For $q \geq 3$, the exit probability exhibits a shape that was not observed in previous models, which implies that increasing initial support for a decision does not necessarily change the final collective outcome.

Title: Agentic End-to-End De Novo Protein Design for Tailored Dynamics Using a Language Diffusion Model
Authors: Bo Ni, Markus J. Buehler
Abstract: Proteins are dynamic molecular machines whose biological functions, spanning enzymatic catalysis, signal transduction, and structural adaptation, are intrinsically linked to their motions. Designing proteins with targeted dynamic properties, however, remains a challenge due to the complex, degenerate relationships between sequence, structure, and molecular motion. Here, we introduce VibeGen, a generative AI framework that enables end-to-end de novo protein design conditioned on normal mode vibrations. VibeGen employs an agentic dual-model architecture, comprising a protein designer that generates sequence candidates based on specified vibrational modes and a protein predictor that evaluates their dynamic accuracy. This approach synergizes diversity, accuracy, and novelty during the design process. Via full-atom molecular simulations as direct validation, we demonstrate that the designed proteins accurately reproduce the prescribed normal mode amplitudes across the backbone while adopting various stable, functionally relevant structures. Notably, generated sequences are de novo, exhibiting no significant similarity to natural proteins, thereby expanding the accessible protein space beyond evolutionary constraints. Our work integrates protein dynamics into generative protein design, and establishes a direct, bidirectional link between sequence and vibrational behavior, unlocking new pathways for engineering biomolecules with tailored dynamical and functional properties. This framework holds broad implications for the rational design of flexible enzymes, dynamic scaffolds, and biomaterials, paving the way toward dynamics-informed AI-driven protein engineering.

Title: Strong field physics in open quantum systems
Authors: Neda Boroumand, Adam Thorpe, Graeme Bart, Andrew Parks, Mohamad Toutounji, Giulio Vampa, Thomas Brabec, Lu Wang
Abstract: Dephasing is the loss of phase coherence due to the interaction of an electron with the environment. The most common approach to model dephasing in light-matter interaction is the relaxation time approximation. Surprisingly, its use in intense laser physics results in a pronounced failure, because ionization {is highly overestimated.} Here, this shortcoming is corrected by developing a strong field model in which the many-body environment is represented by a heat bath. Our model reveals that ionization enhancement and suppression by several orders of magnitude are still possible, however only in more extreme parameter regimes. Our approach allows the integration of many-body physics into intense laser dynamics with minimal computational and mathematical complexity, thus facilitating the identification of novel effects in strong-field physics and attosecond {science}.

Title: Deep learning-based holography for T-linear resistivity
Authors: Byoungjoon Ahn, Hyun-Sik Jeong, Chang-Woo Ji, Keun-Young Kim, Kwan Yun
Abstract: We employ deep learning within holographic duality to investigate $T$-linear resistivity, a hallmark of strange metals. Utilizing Physics-Informed Neural Networks, we incorporate boundary data for $T$-linear resistivity and bulk differential equations into a loss function. This approach allows us to derive dilaton potentials in Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-Axion theories, capturing essential features of strange metals, such as $T$-linear resistivity and linear specific heat scaling. We also explore the impact of the resistivity slope on dilaton potentials. Regardless of slope, dilaton potentials exhibit universal exponential growth at low temperatures, driving $T$-linear resistivity and matching infrared geometric analyses. At a specific slope, our method rediscovers the Gubser-Rocha model, a well-known holographic model of strange metals. Additionally, the robustness of $T$-linear resistivity at higher temperatures correlates with the asymptotic AdS behavior of the dilaton coupling to the Maxwell term. Our findings suggest that deep learning could help uncover mechanisms in holographic condensed matter systems and advance our understanding of strange metals.

Title: Analog Quantum Teleportation
Authors: Uesli Alushi, Simone Felicetti, Roberto Di Candia
Abstract: Digital teleportation protocols make use of entanglement, local measurements and a classical communication channel to transfer quantum states between remote parties. We consider analog teleportation protocols, where classical communication is replaced by transmission through a noisy quantum channel. We show that analog teleportation protocols outperform digital protocols if and only if Alice and Bob are linked by a channel that does not reduce the entanglement of its input state. We first derive general analytical results in the broader context of Gaussian-channel simulation. Then, we apply it to the quantum teleportation of a uniformly distributed codebook of coherent states, showing that an analog protocol is optimal for a wide range of communication channel transmissivities. Our result is relevant in the intermediate case when the communication channel is far from being ideal but is not too lossy, as is the case of cryogenic links in microwave superconducting circuits.

Title: Revealing the fuel of a quantum continuous measurement-based refrigerator
Authors: Cyril Elouard, Sreenath K. Manikandan, Andrew N. Jordan, Geraldine Haack
Abstract: While quantum measurements have been shown to constitute a resource for operating quantum thermal machines, the nature of the energy exchanges involved in the interaction between system and measurement apparatus is still under debate. In this work, we show that a microscopic model of the apparatus is necessary to unambiguously determine whether quantum measurements provide energy in the form of heat or work. We illustrate this result by considering a measurement-based refrigerator, made of a double quantum dot embedded in a two-terminal device, with the charge of one of the dots being continuously monitored. Tuning the parameters of the measurement device interpolates between a heat- and a work-fueled regimes with very different thermodynamic efficiency. Notably, we demonstrate a trade-off between a maximal thermodynamic efficiency when the measurement-based refrigerator is fueled by heat and a maximal measurement efficiency quantified by the signal-to-noise ratio in the work-fueled regime. Our analysis offers a new perspective on the nature of the energy exchanges occurring during a quantum measurement, paving the way for energy optimization in quantum protocols and quantum machines.

Title: Unconventional Transport in a System with a Tower of Quantum Many-Body Scars
Authors: Gianluca Morettini, Luca Capizzi, Maurizio Fagotti, Leonardo Mazza
Abstract: We report the observation of unconventional transport phenomena in a spin-1 model that supports a tower of quantum many-body scars, and we discuss their properties uncovering their peculiar nature. In quantum many-body systems, the late-time dynamics of local observables are typically governed by conserved operators with local densities, such as energy and magnetization. In the model under investigation, however, there is an additional dynamical symmetry restricted to the subspace of the Hilbert space spanned by the quantum many-body scars. That significantly slows the decay of autocorrelation functions of certain coherent states and is responsible for an unconventional form of transport. We show that excited states with energy close to that of the quantum many-body scars play a crucial role in sustaining the transport; counterintuitively, quantum many-body scars are completely irrelevant for the aforementioned mechanism. Finally, we propose a generalized eigenstate thermalization hypothesis to describe specific properties of states with energy close to the scars.

Title: (How) Can Transformers Predict Pseudo-Random Numbers?
Authors: Tao Tao, Darshil Doshi, Dayal Singh Kalra, Tianyu He, Maissam Barkeshli
Abstract: Transformers excel at discovering patterns in sequential data, yet their fundamental limitations and learning mechanisms remain crucial topics of investigation. In this paper, we study the ability of Transformers to learn pseudo-random number sequences from linear congruential generators (LCGs), defined by the recurrence relation $x_{t+1} = a x_t + c \;\mathrm{mod}\; m$. Our analysis reveals that with sufficient architectural capacity and training data variety, Transformers can perform in-context prediction of LCG sequences with unseen moduli ($m$) and parameters ($a,c$). Through analysis of embedding layers and attention patterns, we uncover how Transformers develop algorithmic structures to learn these sequences in two scenarios of increasing complexity. First, we analyze how Transformers learn LCG sequences with unseen ($a, c$) but fixed modulus, and we demonstrate successful learning up to $m = 2^{32}$. Our analysis reveals that models learn to factorize the modulus and utilize digit-wise number representations to make sequential predictions. In the second, more challenging scenario of unseen moduli, we show that Transformers can generalize to unseen moduli up to $m_{\text{test}} = 2^{16}$. In this case, the model employs a two-step strategy: first estimating the unknown modulus from the context, then utilizing prime factorizations to generate predictions. For this task, we observe a sharp transition in the accuracy at a critical depth $=3$. We also find that the number of in-context sequence elements needed to reach high accuracy scales sublinearly with the modulus.

Title: Fluctuation theorems for quasistatic work
Authors: Pierre Nazé
Abstract: When a thermally isolated system performs a driving process in the quasistatic regime, its variation of average energy is equal to its quasistatic work. Even though presenting this simple definition, few attempts have been made to describe such quantity from the fluctuation theorem point of view. In this work, based on Jarzynski's equality, four forms of such equality are deduced. To corroborate the result, a relation with the strong inequality $\langle W\rangle\ge \langle W_{\rm qs}\rangle$ is pursued. It is concluded in the end that any of the fluctuation theorems deduced cannot derive such a postulate. Also, no contradiction is observed if the strong inequality breaks down.

Title: Fluctuation theorem for time-averaged work
Authors: Pierre Nazé
Abstract: There is evidence that taking the time average of the work performed by a thermally isolated system effectively "transforms" the adiabatic process into an isothermal one. This approach allows inherent quantities of adiabatic processes to be accessed through the definitions of isothermal processes. A fluctuation theorem is then established, linking the time-averaged work to the quasistatic work. Numerical evidence supporting this equality is provided for a classical harmonic oscillator with a driven linear equilibrium position parameter. Furthermore, the strong inequality for the average work is derived from the deduced fluctuation theorem using optimality arguments.

Title: Detecting Topological Superconductivity via Berry Curvature Effects in Spectral Functions
Authors: Yunxiang Liao, Yi-Ting Hsu
Abstract: Experimental efforts on topological superconductivity (TSC) have primarily focused on the detection of Majorana boundary modes, while the bulk properties of TSC - particularly in two dimensions (2D) - remain relatively underexplored. In this work, we theoretically propose a distinctive signature in the spectral function away from the boundaries, capable of detecting 2D chiral p-wave TSC induced in a Rashba spin-orbit-coupled (SOC) heterostructure. This signature can be probed experimentally through angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy or momentum- and energy-resolved tunneling spectroscopy under a weak magnetic field B. We show that within the topological phase, the spectral intensity of the lowest superconducting band at small momenta k~0 brightens (darkens) linearly with increasing B, whereas it darkens (brightens) in the trivial phase when the Rashba system is electron- (hole-) doped. This sharp contrast arises from the phase-space Berry curvature (BC) of Bogoliubov quasiparticles, a novel quantum geometric property that generalizes the conventional momentum-space BC. The effect of this phase-space BC can also be detected by the differential conductance away from the boundaries. Our falsifiable prediction provides an experimental avenue for detecting Rashba-induced chiral p-wave TSC without relying on Majorana mode detection, addressing a key challenge in the realization of 2D TSC.

Title: Evidence of Scaling Regimes in the Hopfield Dynamics of Whole Brain Model
Authors: Giorgio Gosti, Sauro Succi, Giancarlo Ruocco
Abstract: It is shown that a Hopfield recurrent neural network exhibits a scaling regime, whose specific exponents depend on the number of parcels used and the decay length of the coupling strength. This scaling regime recovers the picture introduced by Deco et al., according to which the process of information transfer within the human brain shows spatially correlated patterns qualitatively similar to those displayed by turbulent flows, although with a more singular exponent, 1/2 instead of 2/3. Both models employ a coupling strength which decays exponentially with the Euclidean distance between the nodes, informed by experimentally derived brain topology. Nevertheless, their mathematical nature is very different, Hopf oscillators versus a Hopfield neural network, respectively. Hence, their convergence for the same data parameters, suggests an intriguing robustness of the scaling this http URL, the present analysis shows that the Hopfield model brain remains functional by removing links above about five decay lengths, corresponding to about one sixth of the size of the global brain. This suggests that, in terms of connectivity decay length, the Hopfield brain functions in a sort of intermediate ``turbulent liquid''-like state, whose essential connections are the intermediate ones between the connectivity decay length and the global brain size. The evident sensitivity of the scaling exponent to the value of the decay length, as well as to the number of brain parcels employed, leads us to take with great caution any quantitative assessment regarding the specific nature of the scaling regime.

Title: Competing structures in a minimal double-well potential model of condensed matter
Authors: Julyan H. E. Cartwright, Bruno Escribano, Sándalo Roldán-Vargas, C. Ignacio Sainz-Díaz
Abstract: The microscopic structure of several amorphous substances often reveals complex patterns such as medium- or long-range order, spatial heterogeneity, and even local polycrystallinity. To capture all these features, models usually incorporate a refined description of the particle interaction that includes an ad hoc design of the inside of the system constituents, and use temperature as a control parameter. We show that all these features can emerge from a minimal athermal two-dimensional model where particles interact isotropically by a double-well potential, which includes an excluded volume and a maximum coordination number. The rich variety of structural patterns shown by this simple geometrical model apply to a wide range of real systems including water, silicon, and different amorphous materials.

Title: A look at the operator product expansion in critical dynamics
Authors: Carlo Pagani, Janik Sobieray
Abstract: We consider the critical relaxation of the Ising model, the so-called model A, and study its operator product expansion. Within perturbation theory, we focus on the operator product expansions of the two-point function and the response function. At the fixed point, we normalize the coefficients and the scaling variables so that the result displays universality. The role of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem is also discussed, and it is shown that it provides non-perturbative relations among the operator product expansion coefficients. Finally, the large N limit is considered.

Title: Multicomponent mixtures exhibit a vast nucleation-and-growth regime
Authors: Yicheng Qiang, Chengjie Luo, David Zwicker
Abstract: Mixtures of many interacting components can exhibit numerous coexisting droplet types. An exciting example is the cytosol of biological cells, where diverse droplets called condensates are indispensable for cellular function, but it is currently unclear how much their formation is restricted by thermodynamics. Interestingly, linear stability analysis predicts that homogeneous mixtures become more stable with increasing component count. In contrast, we show via numerical simulations and analytical scaling laws that equilibrium states typically contain many coexisting droplets. Combining both results suggests that generic multicomponent mixtures can sustain many stable states with various droplet counts, generalizing the nucleation-and-growth regime of binary mixtures. Our theory also indicates why cells exhibit much fewer condensates than components and how multistability could be leveraged to form condensates independently.

Title: Altermagnetic Polar Metallic phase in Ultra-Thin Epitaxially-Strained RuO2 Films

Abstract: Altermagnetism refers to a wide class of magnetic orders featuring magnetic sublattices with opposite spins related by rotational symmetries, resulting in non-trivial spin splitting and magnetic multipoles. However, the direct observation of the altermagnetic order parameter remains elusive. Here, by combining theoretical analysis, electrical transport, X-ray and optical spectroscopies, we establish a phase diagram in hybrid molecular beam epitaxy-grown RuO2/TiO2 (110) films, mapping symmetries along with altermagnetic/electronic/structural phase transitions as functions of film thickness and temperature. This features a novel altermagnetic metallic polar phase in epitaxially-strained 2 nm films, extending the concept of multiferroicity to altermagnets. Such a clear signature of a magnetic phase transition at ~500 K is observed exclusively in ultrathin strained films, unlike in bulk RuO2 single crystals. These results demonstrate the potential of epitaxial heterostructure design to induce altermagnetism, paving the way for emergent novel phases with multifunctional properties.

Title: Memory-induced long-range order in dynamical systems
Authors: C. Sipling, Y.-H. Zhang, M. Di Ventra
Abstract: Time non-locality, or memory, is a non-equilibrium property shared by all physical systems. Here, we show that memory is sufficient to induce a phase of spatial long-range order (LRO) even if the system's primary dynamical variables are coupled locally. This occurs when the memory degrees of freedom have slower dynamics than the primary degrees of freedom. In addition, such an LRO phase is non-perturbative, and can be understood through the lens of a correlated percolation transition of the fast degrees of freedom mediated by memory. When the two degrees of freedom have comparable time scales, the length of the effective long-range interaction shortens. We exemplify this behavior with a model of locally coupled spins and a single dynamic memory variable, but our analysis is sufficiently general to suggest that memory could induce a phase of LRO in a much wider variety of physical systems.

Title: Principal component analysis of absorbing state phase transitions
Authors: Cristiano Muzzi, Ronald Santiago Cortes, Devendra Singh Bhakuni, Asja Jelić, Andrea Gambassi, Marcello Dalmonte, Roberto Verdel
Abstract: We perform a principal component analysis (PCA) of two one-dimensional lattice models belonging to distinct nonequilibrium universality classes - directed bond percolation and branching and annihilating random walks with even number of offspring. We find that the uncentered PCA of datasets storing various system's configurations can be successfully used to determine the critical properties of these nonequilibrium phase transitions. In particular, in both cases, we obtain good estimates of the critical point and the dynamical critical exponent of the models. For directed bond percolation we are, furthermore, able to extract critical exponents associated with the correlation length and the order parameter. We discuss the relation of our analysis with low-rank approximations of datasets.

Title: Quantum Chaos in Random Ising Networks
Authors: András Grabarits, Kasturi Ranjan Swain, Mahsa Seyed Heydari, Pranav Chandarana, Fernando J. Gómez-Ruiz, Adolfo del Campo
Abstract: We report a systematic investigation of universal quantum chaotic signatures in the transverse field Ising model on an Erdős-Rényi network. This is achieved by studying local spectral measures such as the level spacing and the level velocity statistics. A spectral form factor analysis is also performed as a global measure, probing energy level correlations at arbitrary spectral distances. Our findings show that these measures capture the breakdown of chaotic behavior upon varying the connectivity and strength of the transverse field in various regimes. We demonstrate that the level spacing statistics and the spectral form factor signal this breakdown for sparsely and densely connected networks. The velocity statistics capture the surviving chaotic signatures in the sparse limit. However, these integrable-like regimes extend over a vanishingly small segment in the full range of connectivity.

Title: Half-metallicity and wandering axis ferromagnetism in Fe$_2$Ti$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$Sn (0 $< x \leq$ 0.3) Heusler Alloys
Authors: Kulbhushan Mishra, Shishir Kumar Pandey, S. Chaudhuri, Rajeev Rawat, P. A. Bhobe
Abstract: We investigate the effect of Mn substitution in Fe$_2$Ti$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$Sn on electronic structure and magnetic and electrical transport properties. The spin-polarized density of states calculations using density-functional theory (DFT) yields a half-metallic ground state in Mn-rich compositions. Localized magnetic moments at Mn sites interacting through the cloud of conduction electrons formed by Fe and Ti atoms are also predicted. Electrical resistivity and magneto-transport measurements reveal a Kondo-like ground state at low temperatures and a peculiar linear negative temperature coefficient of resistance in the high-temperature regime with a predominant electron-phonon scattering mechanism. Analysis of room temperature powder X-ray diffraction data reveals a highly ordered L2$_1$ structure and reduction of antisite disorder upon Mn substitution. The temperature-dependent magnetization measurements reveal distinct features indicative of weak anisotropy in the system. Isothermal magnetization measured as a function of the applied field helps identify the unique magnetic ground state of the half-metallic Fe$_2$Ti$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$Sn composition as a ferromagnet with a wandering axis that distinctively orients in the direction of the applied magnetic field. The measurement of X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) reveals that the random anisotropy arises due to the local lattice distortion around Mn atoms in the prepared compositions. Our findings thus provide a new perspective for studying the mechanism of half-metallicity and associated magnetic order in Heuslers.

Title: Radar shielding experiments by composite bilayer magnetic systems
Authors: Jaume Calvo-de la Rosa, Jesús López-Sánchez, Joan Manel Hernàndez, Pilar Marín, Javier Tejada
Abstract: An experimental strong increase of the reflection loss (from 25 up to 35 dBs) and an extension of the absorption bandwidth up to 20% is measured in a set of novel functional bilayer systems. We focus our work on studying the samples in an anechoic chamber under far-field real radar conditions. Each layer consists of a composite material, typically a dielectric matrix filled with random anisotropy hexaferrite and soft metallic materials (powder or wires). Combining the two types of materials into a submillimetric bilayer structure has shown unprecedented improvements in microwave absorption capacities compared to the former absorption of each layer. The capacity to improve the shielding behavior is strongly related to each layer permittivity, permeability, and thickness leading, therefore, to a strong control over the design of novel materials for stealth applications.

Title: Fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect in rhombohedral multilayer graphene with a strong displacement field
Authors: Ke Huang, Sankar Das Sarma, Xiao Li
Abstract: We investigate the fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effect in rhombohedral multilayer graphene (RnG) in the presence of a strong applied displacement field. We first introduce the interacting model of RnG, which includes the noninteracting continuum model and the many-body Coulomb interaction. We then discuss the integer quantum anomalous Hall (IQAH) effect in RnG and the role of the Hartree-Fock approach in understanding its appearance. Next, we explore the FQAH effect in RnG for $n=3$--$6$ using a combination of constrained Hartree-Fock and exact diagonalization methods. We characterize the stability of the FQAH phase by the size of the FQAH gap and find that RnG generally has a stable FQAH phase, although the required displacement field varies significantly among different $n$ values. Our work establishes the theoretical universality of both IQAH and FQAH in RnG.

Title: Interlayer Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions induced via non-linear phononics in bilayer van der Waals materials
Authors: Ze-Xun Lin, Bowen Ma, Wesley Roberts, Martin Rodriguez-Vega, Gregory A. Fiete
Abstract: We theoretically study the impact of light-driven structural changes via nonlinear phononics on the magnetic order of untwisted bilayer van der Waals materials. We consider an illustrative example of the AA-stacked bilayer honeycomb lattice and show that high-intensity light in resonance with selected phonons induces large amplitude phonon displacements that modify the magnetic Hamiltonian of the system. We performed a group theory analysis to identify the vibrational modes of the honeycomb bilayer and the nonlinear couplings among them in the strongly driven regime. We find that the structural changes in the strongly driven regime lower the symmetry relative to the equilibrium lattice and produce changes in the magnetic interactions between the local moments. In particular, the lattice symmetry changes permit a non-zero interlayer Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction that induces a magnetic state with canted local moments. Using a spin-wave analysis about the new magnetic configuration we study the corresponding changes in the magnon spectrum and identify a protocol for engineering topological band transitions using a combination of nonlinear phononics and an external magnetic field. Our work suggests a strategy to induce and control interlayer Dyzaloshinskii-Moriya interactions in a class of layered van der Waals materials, the effect of which is to modify the magnetic ground state, magnon dispersions, and related band geometric properties, including topological invariants.

Title: Spin Liquid and Superconductivity emerging from Steady States and Measurements
Authors: Kaixiang Su, Abhijat Sarma, Marcus Bintz, Thomas Kiely, Yimu Bao, Matthew P. A. Fisher, Cenke Xu
Abstract: We demonstrate that, starting with a simple fermion wave function, the steady mixed state of the evolution of a class of Lindbladians, and the ensemble created by strong local measurement of fermion density without post-selection can be mapped to the "Gutzwiller projected" wave functions in the doubled Hilbert space -- the representation of the density matrix through the Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism. A Gutzwiller projection is a broadly used approach of constructing spin liquid states. For example, if one starts with a gapless free Dirac fermion pure quantum state, the constructed mixed state corresponds to an algebraic spin liquid in the doubled Hilbert space. We also predict that for some initial fermion wave function, the mixed state created following the procedure described above is expected to have a spontaneous "strong-to-weak" U(1) symmetry breaking, which corresponds to the emergence of superconductivity in the doubled Hilbert space. We also design the experimental protocol to construct the desired physics of mixed states.

Title: Bounds and anomalies of inhomogeneous anomalous Hall effects
Authors: Christopher Ard, Evan Camrud, Olivier Pinaud, Hua Chen
Abstract: It is well recognized that interpreting transport experiment results can be challenging when the samples being measured are spatially nonuniform. However, quantitative understanding on the differences between measured and actual transport coefficients, especially the Hall effects, in inhomogeneous systems is lacking. In this work we use homogenization theory to find exact bounds of the measured or homogenized anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) in inhomogeneous conductors under minimal assumptions. In particular, we prove that the homogenized AHC cannot exceed the bounds of the local AHC. However, in common experimental setups, anomalies that appear to violate the above bounds can occur, with a popular example being the "humps" or "dips" of the Hall hysteresis curves usually ascribed to the topological Hall effect (THE). We give two examples showing how such apparent anomalies could be caused by different types of inhomogeneities and discuss their relevance in experiments.

Abstract: We investigate the monitored quantum dynamics of Gaussian mixed states and derive the universal Fokker-Planck equations that govern the stochastic time evolution of entire density-matrix spectra, obtaining their exact solutions. From these equations, we reveal an even-odd effect in purification dynamics: whereas entropy exhibits exponential decay for an even number $N$ of complex fermions, algebraic decay with divergent purification time occurs for odd $N$ as a manifestation of dynamical criticality. Additionally, we identify the universal fluctuations of entropy in the chaotic regime, serving as a non-unitary counterpart of the universal conductance fluctuations in mesoscopic electronic transport phenomena. Furthermore, we elucidate and classify the universality classes of non-unitary quantum dynamics based on fundamental symmetry. We also validate the universality of these analytical results through extensive numerical simulations across different types of models.

Title: Ergodicity breaking and restoration in models of heat transport with microscopic reversibility
Authors: Piero Olla
Abstract: The behavior of lattice models in which time reversibility is enforced at the level of trajectories (microscopic reversibility) is studied analytically. Conditions for ergodicity breaking are explored, and a few examples of systems characterized by an additional conserved quantity besides energy are presented. All the systems are characterized by ergodicity restoration when put in contact with a thermal bath, except for specific choices of the interactions between the atoms in the system and the bath. The study shows that the additional conserved quantities return to play a role in non-equilibrium conditions. The similarities with the behavior of some mesoscale systems, in which the transition rates satisfy detailed balance but not microscopic reversibility, are discussed.

Title: Exceptional topology in non-Hermitian twisted bilayer graphene
Authors: Yingyi Huang
Abstract: Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) has extraordinary electronic properties at the magic angle along with an isolated flat band at the magic angle. However, the non-Hermitian phenomena in twisted bilayer graphene remain unexplored. In this work, we study a non-Hermitian TBG formed by one-layer graphene twisted relative to another layer with gain and loss. Using a non-Hermitian generalization of the Bistritzer-MacDonald model, we find Dirac cones centered at only the $K_M$ ($K'_M$) corner of the moiré Brillouin zone at the $K'$ ($K$) valley deform into rings of exceptional points in the presence of non-Hermiticity, which is different from single-layer graphene with gain and loss, where exceptional rings appear in both $K$ and $K'$ corners of the Brillouin zone. We show that the exceptional rings are protected by non-Hermitian chiral symmetry. More interestingly, at an ``exceptional magic angle" larger than the Hermitian magic angle, the exceptional rings coincide and form non-Hermitian flat bands with zero energy and a finite lifetime. These non-Hermitian flat bands in the moiré system, which are isolated from dispersive bands, are distinguished from those in non-Hermitian frustrated lattices. In addition, we find that the non-Hermitian flat band has topological charge conserved in the moiré Brillouin zone, which is allowed for analogs of non-Hermitian fractional quantum Hall states.

Title: High-field magnetic phase diagrams of the $\textit{R}$Mn$_6$Sn$_6$ kagome metals
Authors: Nil L, Thais Victa-Trevisan, R. J. McQueeney
Abstract: $\textit{R}$Mn$_6$Sn$_6$ ($R=$~Y,~Gd$-$Lu) kagome metals are promising materials hosting flat electronic bands and Dirac points that interact with magnetism. The coupling between the two magnetic $R$ and Mn sublattices can drive complex magnetic states with potential consequences for spin and charge transport and other topological properties. Here, we use a detailed magnetic Hamiltonian to calculate and predict the magnetic phase diagrams for $\textit{R}$Mn$_6$Sn$_6$ kagome metals within the mean-field approximation. These calculations reveal a variety of collinear, non-collinear, and non-coplanar phases that arise from competition between various interlayer magnetic exchange interactions and magnetic anisotropies of the $R$ and Mn ions. We enumerate these phases and their magnetic space groups for future analysis of their impact on topological and trivial bands near the Fermi surface.

Title: Enhancement of the topological regime in elongated Josephson junctions
Authors: D. Kuiri, P. Wójcik, M. P. Nowak
Abstract: We theoretically study topological superconductivity in elongated planar Josephson junctions. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling and an in-plane magnetic field, the Josephson junction can enter the topological phase and host zero-energy Majorana bound states over a range of the superconducting phase difference centered around $\pi$, with the span of this range determined by the strength of the magnetic field. We demonstrate that the topological superconducting phase range can be greatly increased by elongation of the junction, which causes an amplification of the Zeeman-induced phase shift of Andreev bound states. We show that the appearance of trivial in-gap states that occurs in elongated junctions can prohibit the creation of Majorana modes, but it can be mitigated by further proximitization of the junction with additional superconducting contacts. The topological transition in this system can be probed by measurements of the critical current and we show that the elongation of the junction leads to a linear decrease of the transition critical magnetic field beneficial for experimental studies.

Title: The molecular nature of superfluidity: Viscosity of helium from quantum stochastic molecular dynamics simulations over real trajectories
Authors: Phil Attard
Abstract: Using quantum equations of motion for interacting bosons, stochastic molecular dynamics simulations with quantized momenta are performed for Lennard-Jones helium-4. The viscosity of the quantum liquid is significantly less than that of the classical liquid, being almost 5 times smaller at the lowest temperature studied. The classical and quantum liquids are identical except for Bose-Einstein condensation, which pinpoints the molecular mechanism for superfluidity. The results rely on the existence of stochastic but real particle trajectories, which has implications for the interpretation of quantum mechanics.

Title: Flat-band (de)localization emulated with a superconducting qubit array

Abstract: Arrays of coupled superconducting qubits are analog quantum simulators able to emulate a wide range of tight-binding models in parameter regimes that are difficult to access or adjust in natural materials. In this work, we use a superconducting qubit array to emulate a tight-binding model on the rhombic lattice, which features flat bands. Enabled by broad adjustability of the dispersion of the energy bands and of on-site disorder, we examine regimes where flat-band localization and Anderson localization compete. We observe disorder-induced localization for dispersive bands and disorder-induced delocalization for flat bands. Remarkably, we find a sudden transition between the two regimes and, in its vicinity, the semblance of quantum critical scaling.

Title: Variational Scarring in Graphene Quantum Dots
Authors: J. Keski-Rahkonen, C. Zou, A.M. Graf, Q. Yao, T. Zhu, J. Velasco Jr., E.J. Heller
Abstract: A quantum eigenstate of a classically chaotic system is referred as scarred by an unstable periodic orbit if its probability density is concentrated in the vicinity of that orbit. Recently, a new class of scarring - variational scarring - was discovered in numerical studies of disordered quantum dots, arising from near-degeneracies in the quantum spectrum associated with classical resonances of the unperturbed system. Despite the increasing body of theoretical evidence on variational scarring, its experimental observation has remained out of reach. Motivated by this dearth, we argue and demonstrate that variational scarring can occur in an elliptical quantum dot fabricated on monolayer graphene, and locally perturbed by a nanotip. Then, we further show that the fingerprint of these variational scars can potentially be detected via scanning tunneling microscopy, thus offering an attractive experimental pathway for the first validation of this puzzling quantum-chaotic phenomenon.

Title: Direct observation of thermal hysteresis in the molecular dynamics of barocaloric neopentyl glycol
Authors: Frederic Rendell-Bhatti, Markus Appel, Connor S. Inglis, Melony Dilshad, Neha Mehta, Jonathan Radcliffe, Xavier Moya, Donald A. MacLaren, David Boldrin
Abstract: Barocalorics (BCs) are emerging as promising alternatives to vapour-phase refrigerants, which are problematic as they exacerbate climate change when they inevitably leak into the atmosphere. However, the commercialisation of BC refrigerants is significantly hindered by hysteresis in the solid-solid phase transition that would be exploited in a refrigeration cycle. Here, we provide new insight into the hysteresis that is a critical step towards the rational design of viable BCs. By studying the benchmark BC plastic crystal, neopentyl glycol (NPG), we observe directly the liberation of the hydroxyl rotational modes that unlock the hydrogen bond network, distinguishing for the first time the molecular reorientation and hydroxymethyl rotational modes. We showcase the use high-resolution inelastic fixed-window scans in combination with quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS) measurements to build a comprehensive microscopic understanding of the NPG phase transition, directly tracking the molecular dynamics of the phase transition. Hysteresis previously observed in calorimetric studies of NPG is now observed directly as hysteresis in molecular rotational modes, and hence in the formation and disruption of hydrogen bonding. Furthermore, by tracking the thermal activation of three main reorientation modes, we suggest that their fractional excitations may resolve an outstanding discrepancy between measured and calculated entropy change. These results allow for direct study of the molecular dynamics that govern the thermal hysteresis of small molecule energy materials. They will be broadly applicable, as many promising BC material families possess first-order transitions involving molecular reorientations.

Title: Charge density waves and pinning by lattice anisotropy in 214 cuprates
Authors: Xiao Hu, Pedro M. Lozano, Feng Ye, Qiang Li, Jennifer Sears, Igor. A. Zaliznyak, Genda Gu, John M. Tranquada
Abstract: The detection of static charge density waves (CDWs) in La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ (LSCO) with x $\sim$ 0.12 at relatively high temperatures has raised the question of what lattice feature pins the CDWs. Some recent structural studies have concluded that some form of monoclinic distortion, indicated by the appearance of certain weak Bragg peaks (type M peaks) at otherwise forbidden positions, are responsible for CDW pinning. As a test of this idea, we present neutron diffraction results for a single crystal of La$_{2-x}$Ba$_x$CuO$_4$ (LBCO) with x = 1/8, which is known to undergo two structural transitions on cooling, from high-temperature tetragonal (HTT) to low-temperature orthorhombic (LTO) near 240 K, involving a collective tilt pattern of the corner-sharing CuO$_6$ octahedra, and from LTO to low temperature tetragonal (LTT) near 56 K, involving a new tilt pattern and the appearance of intensity at peaks of type T. We observe both type M and type T peaks in the LTT phase, while the type M peaks (but not type T) are still present in the LTO phase. Given that CDW order is observed only in the LTT phase of LBCO, it is apparent that the in-plane Cu-O bond anisotropy associated with the octahedral tilt pattern is responsible for charge pinning. We point out that evidence for a similar, but weaker, bond anisotropy has been observed previously in LSCO and should be responsible for CDW pinning there. In the case of LBCO, the monoclinic distortion may help to explain previously-reported magneto-optical evidence for gyrotropic order.

Title: Anomalous enhancement of Neel order in the $S = 1/2$ square lattice Heisenberg model under fictitious magnetic field
Authors: Takayuki Yokoyama, Yasuhiro Tada
Abstract: Fictitious magnetic fields can be introduced in quantum magnets by the strain engineering and the Aharonov-Casher effect. Here, we study impacts of a uniform fictitious magnetic field and corresponding Landau quantization on the Neel order in the $S=1/2$ Heisenberg model on the square lattice as a prototypical system of quantum magnets. We first analyze the system by using the spin-wave approximation. It is found that the staggered magnetization is enhanced by the fictitious magnetic field and it shows a simple scaling behavior with respect to the magnetic length, in contrast to a naive expectation based on the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. We also perform density matrix renormalization group calculations to fully take quantum effects into account and obtain quantitatively more accurate results. The enhancement is found to be anomalously strong and it shows a non-trivial scaling behavior or a fluctuation induced discontinuity. These results are beyond the well known understanding of correlated systems under magnetic fields called the magnetic catalysis.

Title: Persistent Haldane Phase in Carbon Tetris Chains
Authors: Anas Abdelwahab, Christoph Karrasch, Roman Rausch
Abstract: We introduce the concept of tetris chains, which are linear arrays of 4-site molecules that differ by their intermolecular hopping geometry. We investigate the fermionic symmetry-protected topological Haldane phase in these systems using Hubbard-type models. The topological phase diagrams can be understood via different competing limits and mechanisms: strong-coupling $U\gg t$, weak-coupling $U\ll t$, and the weak intermolecular hopping limit $t'\ll t$. Our particular focus is on two tetris chains that are of experimental relevance. First, we show that a Y-chain of coarse-grained nanographene molecules (triangulenes) is robustly in the Haldane phase in the whole $t'-U$ plane due to the cooperative nature of the three limits. Secondly, we study a near-homogeneous Y$^{\prime}$-chain that is closely related to the electronic model for poly(p-phenylene vinylene). In the latter case, the above mechanisms compete, but the Haldane phase manifests robustly and is stable when long-ranged Pariser-Parr-Popple interactions are added. The site-edged Hubbard ladder can also be viewed as a tetris chain, which gives a very general perspective on the emergence of its fermionic Haldane phase. Our numerical results are obtained by large-scale, SU(2)-symmetric tensor network calculations. We employ the density-matrix-renormalization group as well as the variational uniform matrix-product state (VUMPS) algorithms for finite and infinite systems, respectively. The numerics are supplemented by analytical calculations of the bandstructure winding number.

Title: Revealing spinons by proximity effect
Authors: Antonio Maria Tagliente, Carlos Mejuto-Zaera, Michele Fabrizio
Abstract: The ghost-Gutzwiller variational wavefunction within the Gutzwiller approximation is shown to stabilize a genuine paramagnetic Mott insulator in the half-filled single-band Hubbard model. This phase hosts quasiparticles that are crucial to the paramagnetic response without showing up in the single-particle spectrum, and, as such, they can be legitimately regarded as an example of Anderson's spinons. We demonstrate that these spinons at the interface with a metal reacquire charge by proximity effect and thus reemerge in the spectrum as a heavy-fermion band.

Title: Symmetry-mediated quantum coherence of $W^{5+}$ spins in an oxygen-deficient double perovskite
Authors: Shannon Bernier, Mekhola Sinha, Tyler J. Pearson, Peter V. Sushko, Paul H. Oyala, Maxime A. Siegler, W. Adam Phelan, Abby N. Neill, Danna E. Freedman, Tyrel M. McQueen
Abstract: Elucidating the factors limiting quantum coherence in real materials is essential to the development of quantum technologies. Here we report a strategic approach to determine the effect of lattice dynamics on spin coherence lifetimes using oxygen deficient double perovskites as host materials. In addition to obtaining millisecond $T_1$ spin-lattice lifetimes at T ~ 10 K, measurable quantum superpositions were observed up to room temperature. We determine that $T_2$ enhancement in $Sr_2CaWO_{6-\delta}$ over previously studied $Ba_2CaWO_{6-\delta}$ is caused by a dynamically-driven increase in effective site symmetry around the dominant paramagnetic site, assigned as $W^{5+}$ via electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Further, a combination of experimental and computational techniques enabled quantification of the relative strength of spin-phonon coupling of each phonon mode. This analysis demonstrates the effect of thermodynamics and site symmetry on the spin lifetimes of $W^{5+}$ paramagnetic defects, an important step in the process of reducing decoherence to produce longer-lived qubits.

Title: The $S=\frac{1}{2}$ XY and XYZ models on the two or higher dimensional hypercubic lattice do not possess nontrivial local conserved quantities
Authors: Naoto Shiraishi, Hal Tasaki
Abstract: We study the $S=\frac{1}{2}$ quantum spin system on the $d$-dimensional hypercubic lattice with $d\ge2$ with uniform nearest-neighbor interaction of the XY or XYZ type and arbitrary uniform magnetic field. By extending the method recently developed for quantum spin chains, we prove that the model possesses no local conserved quantities except for the trivial ones, such as the Hamiltonian. This result strongly suggests that the model is non-integrable. We note that our result applies to the XX model without a magnetic field, which is one of the easiest solvable models in one dimension.

Title: Stationary states in a very strongly dipolar molecular condensate
Authors: S K Adhikari
Abstract: A strongly dipolar $^{164}$Dy condensate of dipolar length $a_{\mathrm{dd}}=130.8a_0$, with $a_0$ the Bohr radius, hosts a wide variety of eigenstates, such as droplet, droplet-lattice, and ring-topology states, and self-bound droplets. Motivated by the observation of a very strongly dipolar condensate of NaCs molecules [Bigagli N et al. 2024 Nature 631 289], we demonstrate by numerical simulation, using an improved mean-field model, including the Lee-Huang-Yang interaction, that in a very strongly dipolar molecular condensate with $a_{\mathrm{dd}} = 2000a_0$, most of the above-mentioned states continue to exist and can appear for a much smaller number $N$ of particles ($N \lessapprox 1000$) within the present experimental possibility. However, in a harmonically-trapped very strongly dipolar rotating molecular condensate, a new type of $L=2$ giant-vortex state, with a phase drop of $2 \pi L$ along a closed path around the axis of rotation, appear, where $L$ is the angular momentum of the vortex.

Title: Majorana flat bands and anomalous proximity effects in $p$-wave magnet--superconductor hybrid systems
Authors: Yutaro Nagae, Leo Katayama, Satoshi Ikegaya
Abstract: Flat-band Majorana bound states of nodal $p$-wave superconductors give rise to striking electromagnetic anomalies, reflecting their high degree of degeneracy at the Fermi level. However, experimental investigations of these states have been limited because of the scarcity of materials exhibiting intrinsic $p$-wave superconductivity. In this Letter, we demonstrate that Majorana flat bands can emerge in a hybrid system consisting of a conventional superconductor and a $p$-wave magnet, a recently proposed class of unconventional magnets that possess a unique composite symmetry, the $[C_{2\perp}||\boldsymbol{t}]$ symmetry. The degeneracy of the flat-band Majorana bound states is protected by chiral symmetry from the BDI symmetry class, which originates from the $[C_{2\perp}||\boldsymbol{t}]$ symmetry of the $p$-wave magnet. In addition, we predict the robust appearance of a zero-bias conductance peak in a dirty normal-metal--superconductor junction containing a $p$-wave magnet, which serves as an unambiguous signature of anomalous proximity effects associated with the Majorana flat bands.

Title: Automatic Generation of Maximally Localized Wannier Functions via Optimized Projection Functions and Self-projections
Authors: Sebastian Tillack, Claudia Draxl
Abstract: We present an automatized approach towards maximally localized Wannier functions (MLWFs) applicable to both occupied and unoccupied states. We overcome limitations of the standard optimized projection function (OPF) method and its approximations by providing an exact expression for the gradient of the Wannier spread functional with respect to a single semi-unitary OPF matrix. Moreover, we demonstrate that the localization of the resulting Wannier functions (WFs) can be further improved by including projections on reasonably localized WFs, so-called self-projections.

Title: Analytical solution for the polydisperse random close packing problem in 2D
Authors: Alessio Zaccone
Abstract: An analytical theory for the random close packing density, $\phi_\textrm{RCP}$, of polydisperse hard disks is provided using an equilibrium model of crowding [A. Zaccone, Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 028002 (2022)] which has been justified on the basis of extensive numerical analysis of the maximally random jammed (MRJ) line in the phase diagram of hard spheres [Anzivino et al., J. Chem. Phys. 158, 044901 (2023)]. The solution relies on the equations of state for the hard disk fluid and provides predictions for $\phi_\textrm{RCP}$ as a function of the ratio, $s$, of the standard deviation of the distribution of disk diameters to its mean. For a power-law size distribution with $s=0.246$, the theory yields $\phi_\textrm{RCP} =0.892$, which compares well with the most recent numerical estimate $\phi_\textrm{RCP} =0.905$ based on the Monte-Carlo swap algorithms [Ghimenti, Berthier, van Wijland, Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 028202 (2024)].

Title: Dynamic Control of Third-order Nonlinear Optical Properties of Gold Nanoparticle/Liquid Crystal Composites under External Electric Fields
Authors: Shengwei Wang, Mohamed Amine Gharbi, Chandra S Yelleswarapu
Abstract: This study investigates the dynamic control of third-order nonlinear optical absorption properties of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) dispersed in nematic liquid crystals (LC). By leveraging the reconfigurable nature of liquid crystals under external electric fields, we demonstrate the ability to manipulate AuNP alignment, dimer formation, and subsequently the plasmon coupling effects. Planar oriented and degenerate LC cells were prepared, and their optical responses under varying electric fields were characterized using polarization microscopy, UV-VIS spectroscopy, and Z-scan techniques. In planar cells, the applied electric field reorients LC molecules and AuNPs, influencing plasmon coupling and the nonlinear absorption. Conversely, degenerate cells exhibit more complex behaviors due to multiple LC alignment directions. These findings illustrate the potential of AuNP/nematic LC systems for creating tunable photonic devices responsive to external stimuli.

Title: Universal Sharpness Dynamics in Neural Network Training: Fixed Point Analysis, Edge of Stability, and Route to Chaos
Authors: Dayal Singh Kalra, Tianyu He, Maissam Barkeshli
Abstract: In gradient descent dynamics of neural networks, the top eigenvalue of the loss Hessian (sharpness) displays a variety of robust phenomena throughout training. This includes early time regimes where the sharpness may decrease during early periods of training (sharpness reduction), and later time behavior such as progressive sharpening and edge of stability. We demonstrate that a simple $2$-layer linear network (UV model) trained on a single training example exhibits all of the essential sharpness phenomenology observed in real-world scenarios. By analyzing the structure of dynamical fixed points in function space and the vector field of function updates, we uncover the underlying mechanisms behind these sharpness trends. Our analysis reveals (i) the mechanism behind early sharpness reduction and progressive sharpening, (ii) the required conditions for edge of stability, (iii) the crucial role of initialization and parameterization, and (iv) a period-doubling route to chaos on the edge of stability manifold as learning rate is increased. Finally, we demonstrate that various predictions from this simplified model generalize to real-world scenarios and discuss its limitations.

Title: The allosteric lever: towards a principle of specific allosteric response
Authors: Maximilian Vossel, Bert L. de Groot, Aljaž Godec
Abstract: Allostery, the phenomenon by which the perturbation of a molecule at one site alters its behavior at a remote functional site, enables control over biomolecular function. Allosteric modulation is a promising avenue for drug discovery and is employed in the design of mechanical metamaterials. However, a general principle of allostery, i.e. a set of quantitative and transferable "ground rules", remains elusive. It is neither a set of structural motifs nor intrinsic motions. Focusing on elastic network models, we here show that an allosteric lever -- a mode-coupling pattern induced by the perturbation -- governs the directional, source-to-target, allosteric communication: a structural perturbation of an allosteric site couples the excitation of localized hard elastic modes with concerted long range soft-mode relaxation. Perturbations of non-allosteric sites instead couple hard and soft modes uniformly. The allosteric response is shown to be generally non-linear and non-reciprocal, and allows for minimal structural distortions to be efficiently transmitted to specific changes at distant sites. Allosteric levers exist in proteins and "pseudoproteins" -- networks designed to display an allosteric response. Interestingly, protein sequences that constitute allosteric transmission channels are shown to be evolutionarily conserved. To illustrate how the results may be applied in drug design, we use them to successfully predict known allosteric sites in proteins.

Title: Ising Hamiltonian Minimization: Gain-Based Computing with Manifold Reduction of Soft-Spins vs Quantum Annealing
Authors: James S. Cummins, Hayder Salman, Natalia G. Berloff
Abstract: We investigate the minimization of Ising Hamiltonians, comparing the performance of gain-based computing paradigms based on the dynamics of semi-classical soft-spin models with quantum annealing. We systematically analyze how the energy landscape for the circulant couplings of a Mobius graph evolves with increased annealing parameters. Our findings indicate that these semi-classical models face challenges due to a widening dimensionality landscape. To counteract this issue, we introduce the `manifold reduction' method, which restricts the soft-spin amplitudes to a defined phase space region. Concurrently, quantum annealing demonstrates a natural capability to navigate the Ising Hamiltonian's energy landscape due to its operation within the comprehensive Hilbert space. Our study indicates that physics-inspired or physics-enhanced optimizers will likely benefit from combining classical and quantum annealing techniques.

Title: Dynamical invariant based shortcut to equilibration in open quantum systems
Authors: Mohamed Boubakour, Shimpei Endo, Thomás Fogarty, Thomas Busch
Abstract: We propose using the dynamical invariant also known as the Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant, to speed-up the equilibration of a driven open quantum system. This allows us to reverse engineer the time-dependent master equation that describes the dynamics of the open quantum system and systematically derive a protocol that realizes a shortcut to equilibration. The method does not require additional constraints on the timescale of the dynamics beside the Born-Markov approximation and can be generically applied to boost single particle quantum engines significantly. We demonstrate it with the damped harmonic oscillator, and show that our protocol can achieve a high-fidelity control in shorter timescales than simple non-optimized protocols. We find that the system is heated during the dynamics to speed-up the equilibration, which can be considered as an analogue of the Mpemba effect in quantum control.

Title: Projected Augmented Waves (PAW) motivated mixed basis sets for small molecules
Authors: Garry Goldstein
Abstract: The success behind many pseudopotential methods, such as Projected Augmented Waves (PAW) and Phillips-Kleinman pseudopotential method, is that these methods are all electron methods in disguise. For the Phillips Kleinman and PAW pseudopotential methods we show that there is an explicit all electron reformulation. In the all electron reformulation, in the basis set, there are regular low wavevector basis wave functions and several, specially chosen, high wavevector basis wave functions that are specialized to the atomic environment relevant to nuclei of the substances studied. Using this as motivation, here we propose a new, PAW method motivated, basis set for small molecules, where we use the LO or lo (Localized Orbitals) basis wave functions, and pair them with a Gaussian basis, e.g. Gaussian type orbitals (GTO), for a hybrid basis for small molecules. Contracted Gaussian functions are also possible (CGFs). Several different, but related, LO (lo) basis wave functions are considered. We also show how to extend this idea to Slater basis set, Slater type orbitals (STO), instead of GTO orbitals, combined with LO or lo orbitals. This is done using shape functions.

Title: Annealing Dynamics of Regular Rotor Networks: Universality and Its Breakdown
Authors: András Grabarits, Gaetano Sammartino, Adolfo del Campo
Abstract: The spin-vector Monte Carlo model is widely used as a benchmark for the classicality of quantum annealers but severely restricts the time evolution. The spin-vector Langevin (SVL) model has been proposed and tested as an alternative, closely reproducing the real-time dynamics of physical quantum annealers such as D-Wave machines in the dissipative regime. We investigate the SVL annealing dynamics of classical O(2) rotors on regular graphs, identifying universal features in the nonequilibrium dynamics when changing the range of interactions and the topology of the graph. Regular graphs with low connectance or edge density exhibit universal scaling dynamics consistent with the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, which leads to a power-law dependence of the density of defects and the residual energy as a function of the annealing time. As the interaction range is increased, the power-law scaling is suppressed, and an exponential scaling with the annealing time sets in. Our results establish a universal breakdown of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism in classical systems characterized by long-range interactions, in sharp contrast with previous findings in the quantum domain.

Title: Non-Adiabatic Quantum Optimization for Crossing Quantum Phase Transitions
Authors: András Grabarits, Federico Balducci, Barry C. Sanders, Adolfo del Campo
Abstract: We consider the optimal driving of the ground state of a many-body quantum system across a quantum phase transition in finite time. In this context, excitations caused by the breakdown of adiabaticity can be minimized by adjusting the schedule of the control parameter that drives the transition. Drawing inspiration from the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, we characterize the timescale of onset of adiabaticity for several optimal control procedures. Our analysis reveals that schedules relying on local adiabaticity, such as Roland-Cerf's local adiabatic driving and the quantum adiabatic brachistochrone, fail to provide a significant speedup over the adiabatic evolution in the transverse-field Ising and long-range Kitaev models. As an alternative, we introduce a novel framework, Non-Adiabatic Quantum Optimization (NAQO), that, by exploiting the Landau-Zener formula and taking into account the role of higher-excited states, outperforms schedules obtained via both local adiabaticity and state-of-the-art numerical optimization. NAQO is not restricted to exactly solvable models, and we further confirm its superior performance in a disordered non-integrable model.

Title: Persistent Topological Negativity in a High-Temperature Mixed-State
Authors: Yonna Kim, Ali Lavasani, Sagar Vijay
Abstract: We study the entanglement structure of the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state as it thermalizes under a strongly-symmetric quantum channel describing the Metropolis-Hastings dynamics for the $d$-dimensional classical Ising model at inverse temperature $\beta$. This channel outputs the classical Gibbs state when acting on a product state in the computational basis. When applying this channel to a GHZ state in spatial dimension $d>1$, the resulting mixed state changes character at the Ising phase transition temperature from being long-range entangled to short-range-entangled as temperature increases. Nevertheless, we show that the topological entanglement negativity of a large region is insensitive to this transition and takes the same value as that of the pure GHZ state at any finite temperature $\beta>0$. We establish this result by devising a local operations and classical communication (LOCC) ``decoder" that provides matching lower and upper bounds on the negativity in the thermodynamic limit which may be of independent interest. This perspective connects the negativity to an error-correction problem on the $(d-1)$-dimensional bipartitioning surface and explains the persistent negativity in certain correlated noise models found in previous studies. Numerical results confirm our analysis.

Title: A fluctuation-dissipation theorem perspective on radiative responses to temperature perturbations
Authors: Fabrizio Falasca, Aurora Basinski-Ferris, Laure Zanna, Ming Zhao
Abstract: Radiative forcing drives warming in the Earth system, leading to changes in sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and associated radiative feedbacks. The link between changes in the top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) net radiative flux and SST patterns, known as the "pattern effect", is typically diagnosed by studying the response of atmosphere-only models to SST perturbations. In this work, we diagnose the pattern effect through response theory, by performing idealized warming perturbation experiments from unperturbed data alone. First, by studying the response at short time scales, where the response is dominated by atmospheric variability, we recover results that agree with the literature. Second, by extending the framework to longer time scales, we capture coupled interactions between the slow ocean component and the atmosphere, yielding a novel "sensitivity map" quantifying the response of the net radiative flux to SST perturbations in the coupled system. Here, feedbacks are captured by a spatiotemporal response operator, rather than time-independent maps as in traditional studies. Both formulations skillfully reconstruct changes in externally forced simulations and provide practical strategies for climate studies. The key distinction lies in their perspectives on climate feedbacks. The first formulation, closely aligned with prediction tasks, follows the traditional view in which slow variables, such as SSTs, exert a one-way influence on fast variables. The second formulation broadens this perspective by incorporating spatiotemporal interactions across state variables. This alternative approach explores how localized SST perturbations can alter the coupled dynamics, leading to temperature changes in remote areas and further impacting the radiative fluxes at later times.

Title: Entanglement enhancement induced by noise in inhomogeneously monitored systems
Authors: Cristiano Muzzi, Mikheil Tsitsishvili, Giuliano Chiriacò
Abstract: We study how stronger noise can enhance the entanglement in inhomogeneously monitored quantum systems. We consider a free fermions model composed of two coupled chains - a system chain and an ancilla chain, each subject to its own different noise - and explore the dynamics of entanglement within the system chain under different noise intensities. Our results demonstrate that, contrary to the detrimental effects typically associated with noise, certain regimes of noise on the ancilla can significantly enhance entanglement within the system. Numerical simulations demonstrate the robustness of such entanglement enhancement across various system sizes and noise parameters. This enhancement is found to be highly dependent on the hopping strength in the ancilla, suggesting that the interplay between unitary dynamics and noise can be tuned to optimize the entanglement of a quantum system.

Title: Holographic View of Mixed-State Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases in Open Quantum Systems
Authors: Shijun Sun, Jian-Hao Zhang, Zhen Bi, Yizhi You
Abstract: We establish a holographic duality between d-dimensional mixed-state symmetry-protected topological phases (mSPTs) and (d+1)-dimensional subsystem symmetry-protected topological states (SSPTs). Specifically, we show that the reduced density matrix of the boundary layer of a (d+1)-dimensional SSPT with subsystem symmetry S and global symmetry G corresponds to a d-dimensional mSPT with strong S and weak G symmetries. Conversely, we demonstrate that the wavefunction of an SSPT can be constructed by replicating the density matrix of the corresponding lower-dimensional mSPT. This mapping links the density matrix in lower dimensions to the entanglement properties of higher-dimensional wavefunctions, providing an approach for analyzing nonlinear quantities and quantum information metrics in mixed-state systems. Our duality offers a new perspective for studying intrinsic mSPTs that are unique to open quantum systems, without pure state analogs. We show that strange correlators and twisted Rényi-N correlators can diagnose these nontrivial phases and explore their connection to strange correlators in pure-state SSPTs. Furthermore, we discuss several implications of this holographic duality, including a method for preparing intrinsic mSPT states through the duality.

Title: The hockey-stick conjecture for activated random walk
Authors: Christopher Hoffman, Tobias Johnson, Matthew Junge
Abstract: We prove a conjecture of Levine and Silvestri that the driven-dissipative activated random walk model on an interval drives itself directly to and then sustains a critical density. This marks the first rigorous confirmation of a sandpile model behaving as in Bak, Tang, and Wiesenfeld's original vision of self-organized criticality.

Title: First-principle theory of the Casimir screening effect
Authors: Yu.A. Budkov, P.E. Brandyshev
Abstract: In this paper, we use the formalism of finite-temperature quantum field theory to investigate the Casimir force between flat, ideally conductive surfaces containing confined, but mobile ions. We demonstrate that, in the Gaussian approximation, the ionic fluctuations contribute separately from the electromagnetic fluctuations that are responsible for the standard Casimir effect. This is in line with the "separation hypothesis", has been previously applied on a purely intuitive basis. Our analysis demonstrates the significance of calculating the zero Matsubara frequency component in the electromagnetic contribution, using the formula developed by Schwinger et al., as opposed to the approach based on Lifshitz theory used by other researchers.

Title: Understanding Dynamics in Coarse-Grained Models: V. Extension of Coarse-Grained Dynamics Theory to Non-Hard Sphere Systems
Authors: Jaehyeok Jin, Gregory A. Voth
Abstract: Coarse-grained (CG) modeling has gained significant attention in recent years due to its wide applicability in enhancing the spatiotemporal scales of molecular simulations. While CG simulations, often performed with Hamiltonian mechanics, faithfully recapitulate structural correlations at equilibrium, they lead to ambiguously accelerated dynamics. In the first paper of this series [J. Chem. Phys. 158, 034103 (2023)], we proposed the excess entropy scaling relationship to understand the CG dynamics. Then, in the following companion paper [J. Chem. Phys. 158, 034104 (2023)], we developed a theory to map the CG system into a dynamically-consistent hard sphere system to analytically derive an expression for fast CG dynamics. However, many chemical and physical systems do not exhibit hard sphere-like behavior, limiting the extensibility of the developed theory. In this paper, we aim to generalize the theory to the non-hard sphere system based on the Weeks-Chandler-Andersen perturbation theory. Since non-hard sphere-like CG interactions affect the excess entropy term as it deviates from the hard sphere description, we explicitly account for the extra entropy to correct the non-hard sphere nature of the system. This approach is demonstrated for two different types of interactions seen in liquids, and we further provide a generalized description for any CG models using the generalized Gaussian CG models using Gaussian basis sets. Altogether, this work allows for extending the range and applicability of the hard sphere CG dynamics theory to a myriad of CG liquids.

Title: A topological theory for qLDPC: non-Clifford gates and magic state fountain on homological product codes with constant rate and beyond the $N^{1/3}$ distance barrier
Authors: Guanyu Zhu
Abstract: We develop a unified theory for fault-tolerant quantum computation in quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) and topological codes. We show that there exist hidden simplicial complex structures encoding the topological data for all qLDPC and CSS codes obtained from product construction by generalizing the Freedman-Hastings code-to-manifold mapping. This is achieved by building manifolds corresponding to high-dimensional topological expanders from the Tanner graphs of the skeleton classical or quantum codes, which further form a product manifold and an associated thickened product code defined on its triangulation with only a constant qubit overhead. This suggests that qLDPC or more generally CSS codes obtained from product constructions are topological, and hence can admit cohomology operations such as cup products, physically corresponding to higher symmetries in the underlying topological quantum field theory. When applying this mapping to a 3D hypergraph product code obtained from the product of 3 copies of good classical expander codes, we obtain the first non-Clifford logical CCZ gates via constant depth circuits on a code with constant stabilizer weight $w=O(1)$, constant rate $K=\Theta(N)$, and polynomial distance $D=\Omega(N^{1/3})$. When applied to 3D homological product codes consisting of the product of a pair of good quantum and classical LDPC codes, we can further improve the distance to $D=\Omega(\sqrt{N})$ exceeding the $N^{1/3}$ distance barrier implied by the Bravyi-König bound for conventional topological codes. Our work suggests that it is feasible to apply native logical non-Clifford gates on qLDPC codes or directly inject high-fidelity magic states as resources (`magic state fountain') without the distillation process. For the homological product construction, the fountain can inject $\Theta(\sqrt{N})$ magic states in parallel in a single round.

Authors: Fan Xia, Tian Xia, Haotian Su, Lanyue Gan, Qianlan Hu, Wanyi Wang, Ruyi Huang, Tianshun Bai, Yufan Chen, Chao Ma, Guanhua Long, Shan X. Wang, Eric Pop, Lian-Mao Peng, Youfan Hu
Abstract: The advent of 6G communication demands seamlessly integrated terminals operating above 100 GHz with low power consumption for human-centric applications. In this work, we report high-performance, flexible radio-frequency (RF) transistors based on aligned carbon nanotube (CNT) arrays, achieving, for the first time, as-measured current gain cutoff frequency ($f_{\mathrm{T}}$) and power gain cutoff frequency ($f_{\mathrm{max}}$) both exceeding 100 GHz. Electro-thermal co-design improves both heat dissipation and RF performance, despite the low thermal conductivity of the flexible substrate. The transistors deliver 0.947 mA/ $\mathrm{\mu}$m on-state current and 0.728 mS/ $\mathrm{\mu}$m transconductance. Peak extrinsic $f_{\mathrm{T}}$ and $f_{\mathrm{max}}$ reach 152 GHz and 102 GHz, with low power consumption of 199 mW/mm and 147 mW/mm, respectively, setting new performance records for flexible CNT-based RF transistors by nearly 100$\times$, outperforming all other flexible RF devices. Additionally, flexible RF amplifiers achieve output power of 64 mW/mm and power gain of 11 dB in the K-band (18 GHz), marking a significant milestone in the development of flexible RF technologies for next-generation wireless communication systems.

Title: Symmetry-Aware Bayesian Flow Networks for Crystal Generation
Authors: Laura Ruple, Luca Torresi, Henrik Schopmans, Pascal Friederich
Abstract: The discovery of new crystalline materials is essential to scientific and technological progress. However, traditional trial-and-error approaches are inefficient due to the vast search space. Recent advancements in machine learning have enabled generative models to predict new stable materials by incorporating structural symmetries and to condition the generation on desired properties. In this work, we introduce SymmBFN, a novel symmetry-aware Bayesian Flow Network (BFN) for crystalline material generation that accurately reproduces the distribution of space groups found in experimentally observed crystals. SymmBFN substantially improves efficiency, generating stable structures at least 50 times faster than the next-best method. Furthermore, we demonstrate its capability for property-conditioned generation, enabling the design of materials with tailored properties. Our findings establish BFNs as an effective tool for accelerating the discovery of crystalline materials.
