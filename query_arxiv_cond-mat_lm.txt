Title: Proper Theory of Magnon Orbital Angular Momentum
Authors: Junyu Tang, Ran Cheng
Abstract: The orbital motion of chargeless bosons, unlike that of electrons, does not generate a magnetic moment and thus cannot directly interact with magnetic fields. Utilizing the Aharonov-Casher effect and perturbation theory, we formulate a proper theory for the magnon orbital angular momentum (OAM) at finite temperatures, explicitly identifying both self-rotation and topological contributions, analogous to the electronic counterpart but with correct bosonic statistics. Comparing with previous studies on magnon OAM, the magnon spin Nernst effect can only be correctly reproduced using the proper theory for magnon OAM. In a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice, we show that the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction induces a large magnon OAM in both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic ground states. Our formulation provides a foundation for studying orbital dynamics of chargeless bosons with intrinsic spin.

Title: Electron-beam-induced Contactless Manipulation of Interlayer Twist in van der Waals Heterostructures
Authors: Nicola Curreli, Tero S. Kulmala, Riya Sebait, Nicolò Petrini, Matteo Bruno Lodi, Roman Furrer, Alessandro Fanti, Michel Calame, Ilka Kriegel
Abstract: The ability to dynamically control the relative orientation of layers in two dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures represents a critical step toward the realization of reconfigurable nanoscale devices. Existing actuation methods often rely on mechanical contact, complex architectures, or extreme operating conditions, which limit their applicability and scalability. In this work, we present a proof-of-concept demonstration of contactless electrostatic actuation based on electron-beam-induced charge injection. By locally charging an insulating hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) flake on an electrically grounded graphene layer, we create an interfacial electric field that generates in-plane electrostatic torque and induces angular displacement. We validate the induced rotation through in-situ scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and twist-dependent Raman spectroscopy.

Title: Coherent matter wave emission from an atomtronic transistor
Authors: Sasanka Dowarah, Mengxin Du, Alan Zanders, Shengwang Du, Michael Kolodrubetz, Chuanwei Zhang
Abstract: The atomtronic matter-wave triple-well transistor is theoretically predicted to exhibit current gain and act as a coherent matter-wave emitter. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of an atomtronic transistor composed of a triple-well potential -- source, gate, and drain -- modeled by the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation. We systematically explore the dependence of the drain population and the current on the source bias potential and the strength of the interatomic interaction. Our simulations reveal signatures of resonant tunneling when the source chemical potential aligns with discrete energy levels in the gate well, leading to coherent matter-wave emission in the drain. Contrary to previous many-body studies that predicted interaction-induced current gain via coupling to gate well modes, our results suggest that coherence in the drain is primarily governed by single-particle resonances, with no evident broadening from nonlinear coupling.

Title: Spin-orbit coupling and the Edelstein effect at conducting ferroelectric domain walls
Authors: Maryam A. Nasir, W. A. Atkinson
Abstract: Head-to-head ferroelectric domain walls are intrinsically charged, and are typically compensated by a mix of oppositely charged defects and free electrons. The free electrons form a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) along the domain wall. In many cases, inversion symmetry is broken at the wall, which implies that the 2DEG is subject to nontrivial spin-orbit coupling. Here, we use symmetry arguments to construct a generic six-band tight-binding electronic Hamiltonian for a $90^\circ$ head-to-head ferroelectric domain wall. The model, which includes spin-orbit physics and has a multi-orbital $t_{2g}$ band structure that is common to transition-metal perovskites, is applied to BaTiO$_3$. We find that the 2DEG develops an Ising spin texture, with spins aligned perpendicular to the domain wall. We contrast this with the Rashba spin texture that should emerge at weakly conducting $90^\circ$ head-to-tail domain walls. We then show that the head-to-head domain walls should have a measurable Edelstein effect (that is, a current-induced magnetization), even in the dilute limit and at room temperature, and describe a simple experiment to measure it.

Title: Pure many-body interactions in colloidal systems by artificial random light fields
Authors: Augustin Muster, Luis S. Froufe-Pérez
Abstract: We propose a method to generate pure many-body interactions in colloidal systems by using optical forces induced by random optical fields with an optimized spectral energy density. To assess the feasibility in general settings, we develop a simple model for Lorentzian electric and magnetic dipole response. An optimization procedure is then introduced to design the spectral energy density of the random field that minimizes pair interactions at constant electromagnetic energy density. We conclude that, under rather general circumstances, it is possible to effectively cancel pair interactions within a range of distance. Hence a colloid can be driven to interact exclusively through many-body interactions

Title: Bloch Oscillations and Landau-Zener Transitions in Flat-Band Lattices with Quadratic and Linear Band Touchings
Authors: Chenhaoyue Wang, Carlos J. Garcia-Cervera, Amartya S. Banerjee
Abstract: Bloch oscillations (BOs) describe the coherent oscillatory motion of electrons in a periodic lattice under a constant external electric field. Deviations from pure harmonic wave packet motion or irregular Bloch oscillations can occur due to Zener tunneling (Landau-Zener Transitions or LZTs), with oscillation frequencies closely tied to interband coupling strengths. Motivated by the interplay between flat-band physics and interband coupling in generating irregular BOs, here we investigate these oscillations in Lieb and Kagome lattices using two complementary approaches: coherent transport simulations and scattering matrix analysis. In the presence of unavoidable band touchings, half-fundamental and fundamental BO frequencies are observed in Lieb and Kagome lattices, respectively -- a behavior directly linked to their distinct band structures. When avoided band touchings are introduced, distinct BO frequency responses to coupling parameters in each lattice are observed. Scattering matrix analysis reveals strong coupling and potential LZTs between dispersive bands and the flat band in Kagome lattices, with the quadratic band touching enhancing interband interactions and resulting in BO dynamics that is distinct from systems with linear crossings. In contrast, the Lieb lattice -- a three level system -- shows independent coupling between the flat band and two dispersive bands, without direct LZTs occurring between the two dispersive bands themselves. Finally, to obtain a unifying perspective on these results, we examine BOs during a strain-induced transition from Kagome to Lieb lattices, and link the evolution of irregular BO frequencies to changes in band connectivity and interband coupling.

Title: Strain Effects on Electronic Properties of Cobalt-Based Coordination Nanosheets
Authors: Kento Nishigomi, Yu Yi, Souren Adhikary, Kazuhito Tsukagoshi, Katsunori Wakabayashi
Abstract: We theoretically study the strain effects on the electronic properties of cobalt-based benzenehexathiol (CoBHT) coordination nanosheets using first-principles calculations. Two distinct crystal structures, high-density structure (HDS) and low-density structure (LDS), are explored. Our results reveal that HDS behaves as a metal, while LDS exhibits semiconducting. Spin-polarized electronic band structures highlight the presence of energy band structures of Kagome lattice, and the inclusion of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) results in band gap openings at high-symmetric K points. Furthermore, we construct the tight-binding model to investigate the topological properties of CoBHT, demonstrating anomalous Hall conductivity driven by the intrinsic Berry curvature. The impact of uniaxial strain on the electronic and magnetic properties of CoBHT is also studied. Strain induces significant modifications in magnetic moments and density of states, particularly in the HDS. Anomalous Hall conductivity is enhanced under hole-doping conditions, suggesting that strain can be used to tailor the electronic properties of CoBHT for specific applications. Our findings underscore the potential of CoBHT nanosheets for use in next-generation electronic, optoelectronic, and catalytic devices with tunable properties through strain engineering.

Title: High-spin magnetic ground states of neutral dopant clusters in semiconductors
Authors: Rhine Samajdar, Haonan Zhou, R. N. Bhatt
Abstract: High-spin states hold significant promise for classical and quantum information storage and emerging magnetic memory technologies. Here, we present a systematic framework for engineering such high-spin magnetic states in dopant clusters formed from substitutional impurities in semiconductors. In single-valley materials such as gallium arsenide, impurity states are hydrogenic and exchange interactions generally favor low-spin configurations, except in special geometries. In contrast, multivalley semiconductors exhibit oscillatory form factors in their exchange couplings, enabling the controlled suppression of selected hopping processes and exchange couplings. Exploiting this feature, we demonstrate how carefully arranged impurities in aluminum arsenide, germanium, and silicon can stabilize ground states with a net spin that scale extensively with system size. Within effective mass theory and the tight-binding approximation for hopping, we construct explicit examples ranging from finite clusters to extended lattices and fractal-like tilings. In two dimensions, we identify several favorable dopant geometries supporting a net spin equal to around half of the fully polarized value in the thermodynamic limit, including one which achieves over $70\%$ polarization. Our results provide a general design principle for harnessing valley degeneracy in semiconductors to construct robust high-spin states and outline a pathway for their experimental realization via precision implantation of dopants.

Title: New Directions in Focused Ion Beam Induced Deposition for the Nanoprinting of Functional 3D Heterostructures
Authors: Frances Isabel Allen
Abstract: The focused ion beam (FIB) microscope is well established as a high-resolution machining instrument capable of site-selectively removing material down to the nanoscale. Beyond subtractive processing, however, the FIB can also add material using a technique known as focused ion beam induced deposition (FIBID), enabling the direct-write of complex nanostructures. This work explores new directions in three-dimensional nanoprinting with FIBID, harnessing unique features of helium and neon FIBs to fabricate nanoscale heterostructures, including multimaterial architectures and deposits with engineered internal voids. Detailed insight into the chemical and structural composition of these nanostructures is obtained using advanced electron microscopy, revealing buried interfaces and material transformations. Building on these results, the evolution of FIBID into a versatile platform for functional nanomaterials design is discussed, opening pathways toward next-generation nanoscale devices and technologies.

Title: Hierarchically Engineered Titanium Suboxide Films for High-Efficiency Solar Thermal Conversion
Authors: Silpa S, Ann Eliza Joseph, Srinivas G, Harish C Barshilia, Vinayak B Kamble
Abstract: We report the development of broadband solar absorber coatings based on titanium suboxide composite thin films on aluminium substrates. The films are fabricated via scalable DC magnetron sputtering using a Ti target, followed by post-annealing in a fixed $O_2$ partial pressure of 0.45 mbar. By tuning deposition time and annealing temperature, a composite phase of $Ti_2O_3$ and $TiO_2$ was achieved. The Raman mapping of the films substantiates the distribution and coexistence of the two phases. The optimized sample, deposited for 10 min and annealed at 500 $^oC$, exhibited a superior solar absorptance (${\alpha}_s$ = 0.913) and optimally low thermal emittance (${\epsilon}_t$ = 0.11). Nevertheless, the 15- and 20-min deposited films also showed a promising absorptance (>0.85) and emittance values (<0.13). Morphological studies revealed island-type nanostructures, leading to enhanced photothermal performance via electric field confinement, which is validated by optical simulations. This work provides a promising route toward efficient, scalable, and cost-effective spectrally selective solar absorbers for solar thermal applications.

Title: In-situ characterisation and data-driven crystal plasticity analysis of short-to-long crack transition in a ductile aluminium alloy
Authors: Abdalrhaman Koko, Bemin Sheen, Caitlin Green, Fionn Dunne
Abstract: Crack arrest in ductile alloys plays a critical role in damage-tolerant design for aerospace and structural applications, yet the transition from microstructure-sensitive short cracks to load-controlled long cracks remains poorly understood. Here, we present an in-situ, high-resolution experimental study of crack propagation in cold-worked 5052 aluminium alloy using scanning electron microscopy digital image correlation (SEM-DIC), electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), and novel data-driven crystal plasticity modelling that uses the SEM-DIC and EBSD directly to calculate the stress. The local (elastic) mode I and II stress intensity factors (SIFs) and the (elastic and elastoplastic) energy release rate were extracted from the DIC-measured displacement field and correlated with the crack interaction with microstructural features. We find that the microstructure-sensitive crack grows in a quasi-brittle manner at low energy release rate until reaching a critical energy release rate, where the crack's process zone becomes large enough to invoke plastic deformation that blunts the crack, marking a transition from elastically driven microstructure-sensitive crack propagation to plasticity-dominated crack arrest. Our findings establish that the short-to-long crack transition is process-zone governed, rather than being length-scale governed.

Title: Anomalous Fraunhofer patterns in Cd$_3$As$_2$ Josephson Junctions
Authors: Rak-Hee Kim, Yeongmin Jang, Bob M. Wang, Dong Yu, Yong-Joo Doh
Abstract: Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in topological superconductors are promising for quantum computing, yet their unambiguous detection remains challenging. We fabricated Josephson junctions (JJs) using Cd$_3$As$_2$ Dirac semimetal nanoribbons with NbTi superconducting electrodes to investigate topological supercurrents through Fraunhofer pattern analysis. The JJs exhibited excellent quality with high transparency ($\tau$ = 0.77) and large induced superconducting gap ($\Delta$ = 1.10 meV), confirmed by multiple Andreev reflection features. While node lifting at the third minimum of the Fraunhofer pattern was observed as a predicted signature of 4{$\pi$}-periodic topological supercurrents, our theoretical analysis demonstrates that asymmetric supercurrent distributions can reproduce this behavior without invoking MZMs. These findings reveal that anomalous Fraunhofer patterns alone cannot reliably confirm topological superconductivity, necessitating complementary experimental approaches for conclusive Majorana detection

Title: Electro-optic effects in some sliding ferroelectrics
Authors: Xueqing Wan, Zhenlong Zhang, Charles Paillard, Jinyang Ni, Lei Zhang, Zhijun Jiang, Laurent Bellaiche
Abstract: Sliding ferroelectrics, which exhibit out-of-plane polarization arising from specific stacking rather than conventional ionic displacements, are new types of ferroelectrics whose underdeveloped physics needs to be explored. Here, we investigate for the first time the electro-optic (EO) response of these materials using first-principles calculations, focusing on ZrI$_{2}$ as a prototype. We reveal that, contrary to conventional ferroelectrics, the EO effect in ZrI$_{2}$ is dominated by its electronic contribution rather than the ionic one, which promises faster EO responses. Furthermore, both biaxial and uniaxial strains significantly enhance this response, and a novel, universal-like linear relationship between the band gap and such response is discovered. We also report a large elasto-optic coefficient that is independent of biaxial strain. Similar large linear EO coefficients and properties are found in other sliding ferroelectrics, including different zirconium dihalides, as well as BN and BP bilayers. These findings highlight sliding ferroelectrics as highly promising candidates for ultrafast nonlinear optical devices and reveal novel EO mechanisms.

Title: Insulating transport in anisotropic metals: breakdown of Drude transport and the puzzling $c$-axis resistivity of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ and other layered oxides
Authors: Sophie Beck, Matthew Shammami, Lorenzo Van Muñoz, Jason Kaye, Antoine Georges, Jernej Mravlje
Abstract: We reveal a mechanism that may explain the non-metallic out-of-plane resistivity in layered metals. By carefully examining how the Drude-Boltzmann expression for the $c$-axis conductivity emerges out of the Kubo formula, we find, besides the standard metallic term proportional to the carrier lifetime $\tau$, a non-Drude contribution proportional to $1/\tau$. The Drude behavior breaks down when $1/\tau > 2 \eta^*$, the crossover value $\eta^*$ being small (and hence observable) when the $c$-axis velocities vary rapidly with the distance from the Fermi surface. We consider the Hund metal Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ as a test case, which we study within a realistic dynamical mean-field theory approach. The non-Drude behavior observed experimentally in $c$-axis transport is reproduced and explained by our considerations, showing that earlier invoked extrinsic mechanisms that involve either impurities or phonons are unnecessary. We point out that the small value of $\eta^*$ is due to a peculiar accidental cancellation due to destructive interference characteristic of body-centered tetragonal lattices.

Title: The magnon spectra of g-type altermagnet bulk CrSb
Authors: Murat Tas
Abstract: We present a calculation of the magnon spectra and chiral lifetimes of altermagnons in bulk CrSb using the many-body perturbation theory. The spin-split band structure is evident in the magnon spectra. Altermagnons attain an energy of 275 meV at the K point of the Brillouin zone. Due to large spin splitting at a specific ${\bf q}$ point along the A - M direction, lifetime differences of chiral altermagnons reach approximately 20 fs.

Title: Roton-mediated soliton bound states in binary dipolar condensates
Authors: R. M. V. Röhrs, R. N. Bisset
Abstract: We investigate the formation of bound states between dark-antidark solitary waves in two-component dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates. The excitation spectrum contains density and spin branches, and a rotonic feature of the spin branch enables long-range soliton interactions, giving rise to multiple bound states for a single pair, each with a distinct separation. We show that these bound states originate from periodic modulations of the inter-soliton potential, while individual solitons are surrounded by spatial spin-density oscillations. Both features provide direct signatures of the spin roton. Collisions between unbound solitons probe this potential, with dipolar interactions enforcing universal bouncing at low velocities, independent of soliton sign, whereas nondipolar solitons may either transmit or bounce. This distinct behavior offers a realistic path to confirming spin rotons experimentally.

Title: Observation of a Novel CDW Superstructure in Monolayer 1T-$VS_{2}$ at Room Temperature and its Evolution in Multilayers
Authors: Samanta Pal, Kaustuv Chatterjee, A. K. Raychaudhuri, Prabir Pal
Abstract: Spontaneous formation of charge density wave (CDW) superstructures in monolayers (MLs) of a two-dimensional (2D) crystal lattice is fundamental in understanding its complex quantum states. We report a successful top-down liquid phase exfoliation and stamp transfer process (LPESTP) to create ML VS\textsubscript{2}, undergoing a CDW transition at room temperature. Using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and electron diffraction (ED), we observed the coexistence of 1T and 2H polymorphic phases in VS\textsubscript{2} at room temperature, and only the 1T phase undergoes CDW transition. We discovered a novel incommensurate CDW superstructure ($\sqrt{7} \times \sqrt{7}$) R19.1\textsuperscript{o} in ML 1T-VS\textsubscript{2}. With an increase in the number of layers, the CDW order changes to a commensurate ($2 \times 2$) superstructure. Using angle-dependent photoelectron spectroscopy, we have shown that vanadium atoms self-intercalate as V\textsuperscript{3+} ions in multilayer VS\textsubscript{2} and are responsible for the evolution of the CDW superstructure from the incommensurate $\sqrt{7} \times \sqrt{7}$) R 19.1\textsuperscript{o} to the commensurate ($2\times2$) order. We also report the observation of novel Moiré superlattices in twisted bilayer 1T-VS\textsubscript{2} flakes with trapped CDW superstructure of the monolayer. Our findings provide an important platform for understanding the evolution of CDW superstructures in 1T-VS\textsubscript{2} with thickness and V self-intercalation.

Title: Hybrid MBE Route to Adsorption-Controlled Growth of BaTiO3 Membranes with Robust Polarization Switching
Authors: S. Choo, S. Varshney, J. Shah, A. K. Manjeshwar, D. K. Lee, K. A. Mkhoyan, R. D. James, B. Jalan
Abstract: Freestanding ferroelectric membranes are promising for flexible electronics, nonvolatile memory, photonics, and spintronics, but their synthesis is challenged by the need for reproducibility with precise stoichiometric control. Here, we demonstrate the adsorption-controlled growth of single-crystalline, epitaxial BaTiO3 films by hybrid molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) on a binary oxide sacrificial layer. Using a simple water-droplet lift-off method, we obtained submillimeter- to millimeter-sized membranes that retained crystallinity, as confirmed by high-resolution X-ray diffraction, and exhibited robust tetragonal symmetry by Raman spectroscopy. Impedance spectroscopy confirmed a high dielectric constant of 1340, reflecting the robust dielectric response of the membranes. Ferroelectric functionality was revealed by piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) and further verified by polarization-electric field (P-E) loop measurements with Positive-Up-Negative-Down (PUND). The P-E loops exhibited a remnant polarization of 5 microC cm-2 and a coercive field of 63 kV cm-1. These results were interpreted in relation to c- and a-domain configurations. These results establish hybrid MBE as a generalizable route for producing stoichiometry-controlled ferroelectric membranes, enabling their integration into next-generation flexible and multifunctional quantum oxide devices.

Title: Quantized Piezospintronic Effect in Moiré Systems
Authors: Mario Castro, Benjamín Mancilla, Fabian Wolff, Alvaro S. Nunez
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for generating and controlling spin currents in an antiferromagnetic twisted honeycomb bilayer in response to an elastic deformation. Utilizing a continuum model, closely based upon the seminal Bistritzer-MacDonald model, that captures the essential physics of low-energy moiré bands, we calculate the spin current response to the deformation in terms of the familiar Berry phase formalism. The resulting moiré superlattice potential modulates the electronic band structure, leading to emergent topological phases and novel transport properties such as quantized piezo responses both for spin and charge transport. This approach allows us to tune the system across different topological regimes and to explore the piezo-spintronic responses as a function of the band topology. When inversion symmetry is broken either by a sublattice potential $V$, alignment with an hBN substrate, uniaxial strain, or structural asymmetry present in the moiré superlattice, the system acquires a finite Berry curvature that is opposite in the $K$ and $K'$ valleys (protected by valley time reversal symmetry). In contrast, for strain, the valley-contrasting nature of the pseudo-gauge field ensures that the quantized response is robust and proportional to the sum of the valley Chern numbers. These notable physical properties make these systems promising candidates for groundbreaking spintronic and valleytronic devices.

Title: Lattice Translation Modulated Symmetries and TFTs
Authors: Ching-Yu Yao
Abstract: Modulated symmetries are internal symmetries that are not invariant under spacetime symmetry actions. We propose a general way to describe the lattice translation modulated symmetries in 1+1D, including the non-invertible ones, via the tensor network language. We demonstrate that the modulations can be described by some autoequivalences of the categories. Although the topological behaviors are broken because of the presence of modulations, we can still construct the modulated version of the symmetry TFT bulks by inserting a series of domain walls described by invertible bimodule categories. This structure not only recovers some known results on invertible modulated symmetries but also provides a general framework to tackle modulated symmetries in a more general setting.

Title: Adsorption-induced surface magnetism
Authors: Miloš Baljozović, Shiladitya Karmakar, André L. Fernandes Cauduro, Mothuku Shyam Sundar, Marco Lozano, Manish Kumar, Diego Soler Polo, Andreas K. Schmid, Ashutosh V. Bedekar, Pavel Jelinek, Karl-Heinz Ernst
Abstract: We report the emergence of adsorption-induced magnetism from heterohelicene molecules on a non-magnetic Cu(100) surface. Spin-polarized low-energy electron microscopy (SP-LEEM) measurements reveal spin-dependent electron reflectivity for enantiopure 7,12,17-trioxa[11]helicene (TO[11]H) monolayers, indicating the formation of a spin-polarized state localized in the topmost copper layer. Control experiments on clean Cu(100) and TO[11]H on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite show no such effect, excluding artifacts and chirality-induced spin selectivity as origins. Spin-polarized density functional theory calculations with hybrid functionals attribute the magnetism to strong chemisorption, which induces hybridization between the molecular HOMO and copper s- and d-states, driving asymmetric spin-polarized charge redistribution at the interface. An extended Newns-Anderson-Grimley model incorporating on-site Coulomb repulsion in Cu d-orbitals reproduces the emergence of interfacial spin polarization above a threshold interaction strength, highlighting the key roles of hybridization parameters and Coulomb correlation. These findings reveal a mechanism for inducing magnetism at molecule-metal interfaces without inherently magnetic components, offering new avenues for engineering spin-polarized states in organic-inorganic hybrid systems.

Title: Optimal Computation from Fluctuation Responses
Authors: Jinghao Lyu, Kyle J. Ray, James P. Crutchfield
Abstract: The energy cost of computation has emerged as a central challenge at the intersection of physics and computer science. Recent advances in statistical physics -- particularly in stochastic thermodynamics -- enable precise characterizations of work, heat, and entropy production in information-processing systems driven far from equilibrium by time-dependent control protocols. A key open question is then how to design protocols that minimize thermodynamic cost while ensur- ing correct outcomes. To this end, we develop a unified framework to identify optimal protocols using fluctuation response relations (FRR) and machine learning. Unlike previous approaches that optimize either distributions or protocols separately, our method unifies both using FRR-derived gradients. Moreover, our method is based primarily on iteratively learning from sampled noisy trajectories, which is generally much easier than solving for the optimal protocol directly from a set of governing equations. We apply the framework to canonical examples -- bit erasure in a double-well potential and translating harmonic traps -- demonstrating how to construct loss functions that trade-off energy cost against task error. The framework extends trivially to underdamped systems, and we show this by optimizing a bit-flip in an underdamped system. In all computations we test, the framework achieves the theoretically optimal protocol or achieves work costs comparable to relevant finite time bounds. In short, the results provide principled strategies for designing thermodynamically efficient protocols in physical information-processing systems. Applications range from quantum gates robust under noise to energy-efficient control of chemical and synthetic biological networks.

Title: Higher-form entanglement asymmetry and topological order
Authors: Amanda Gatto Lamas, Jacopo Gliozzi, Taylor L. Hughes
Abstract: We extend a recently defined measure of symmetry breaking, the entanglement asymmetry, to higher-form symmetries. In particular, we focus on Abelian topological order in two dimensions, which spontaneously breaks a 1-form symmetry. Using the toric code as a primary example, we compute the entanglement asymmetry and compare it to the topological entanglement entropy. We find that while the two quantities are not strictly equivalent, both are sub-leading corrections to the area law and can serve as order parameters for the topological phase. We generalize our results to non-chiral Abelian topological order and express the maximal entanglement asymmetry in terms of the quantum dimension. Finally, we discuss how the scaling of entanglement asymmetry correctly detects topological order in the deformed toric code, where 1-form symmetry breaking persists even in a trivial phase.

Title: Finding the temperature window for atomic layer deposition of ruthenium metal via efficient phonon calculations
Authors: Alexandr Fonari, Simon D. Elliott, Casey N. Brock, Yan Li, Jacob Gavartin, Mathew D. Halls
Abstract: We investigate the use of first principles thermodynamics based on periodic density functional theory (DFT) to examine the gas-surface chemistry of an oxidized ruthenium surface reacting with hydrogen gas. This reaction system features in the growth of ultrathin Ru films by atomic layer deposition (ALD). We reproduce and rationalize the experimental observation that ALD of the metal from RuO4 and H2 occurs only in a narrow temperature window above 100°C, and this validates the approach. Specifically, the temperature-dependent reaction free energies are computed for the competing potential reactions of the H2 reagent, and show that surface oxide is reduced to water, which is predicted to desorb thermally above 113°C, exposing bare Ru that can further react to surface hydride, and hence deposit Ru metal. The saturating coverages give a predicted growth rate of 0.7 Å/cycle of Ru. At lower temperatures, free energies indicate that water is retained at the surface and reacts with the RuO4 precursor to form an oxide film, also in agreement with experiment. The temperature dependence is obtained with the required accuracy by computing Gibbs free energy corrections from phonon calculations within the harmonic approximation. Surface phonons are computed rapidly and efficiently by parallelization on a cloud architecture within the Schrödinger Materials Science Suite. We also show that rotational and translational entropy of gases dominate the free energies, permitting an alternative approach without phonon calculations, which would be suitable for rapid pre-screening of gas-surface chemistries.

Title: A van der Waals material exhibiting room temperature broken inversion symmetry with ferroelectricity
Authors: Fabia F. Athena, Cooper A. Voigt, Mengkun Tian, Anjan Goswami, Emily Toph, Moses Nnaji, Fanuel Mammo, Brent K. Wagner, Sungho Jeon, Wenshan Cai, Eric M. Vogel
Abstract: Since the initial synthesis of van der Waals two-dimensional indium selenide was first documented in 1957, five distinct polymorphs and their corresponding polytypes have been identified. In this study, we report a unique phase of indium selenide via Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) analysis in the synthesized large-area films -- which we have named the $\beta^\text{p}$ phase. The quintuple layers of the $\beta^\text{p}$ phase, characterized by a unique zigzag atomic configuration with unequal indium-selenium bond lengths from the middle selenium atom, are distinct from any other previously reported phase of indium selenide. Cross-sectional STEM analysis has revealed that the $\beta^\text{p}$ layers exhibit intralayer shifting. We found that indium selenide films with $\beta^\text{p}$ layers display electric-field-induced switchable polarization characteristic of ferroelectric materials, suggesting the breaking of the inversion symmetry. Experimental observations of nonlinear optical phenomena -- Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) responses further support this conclusion. This study reports a $\beta^\text{p}$ phase of indium selenide showing ferroelectricity over large areas at room temperature in a low-dimensional limit.

Abstract: Single nuclear spins in silicon are a promising resource for quantum technologies due to their long coherence times and excellent control fidelities. Qubits and qudits have been encoded on donor nuclei, with successful demonstrations of Bell states and quantum memories on the spin-1/2 $^{31}$P and cat-qubits on the spin-7/2 $^{123}$Sb nuclei. Isoelectronic nuclear spins coupled to gate-defined quantum dots, such as the naturally occurring $^{29}$Si isotope, possess no additional charge and allow for the coupled electron to be shuttled without destroying the nuclear spin coherence. Here, we demonstrate the coupling and readout of a spin-9/2 $^{73}$Ge nuclear spin to a gate-defined quantum dot in SiMOS. The $^{73}$Ge nucleus was implanted by isotope-selective ion-implantation. We observe the hyperfine interaction (HFI) to the coupled quantum dot electron and are able to tune it from 180 kHz to 350 kHz, through the voltages applied to the lateral gate electrodes. This work lays the foundation for future spin control experiments on the spin-9/2 qudit as well as more advanced experiments such as entanglement distribution between distant nuclear spins or repeated weak measurements.

Title: Fractional quantum Hall state at $ν= 1/2$ with energy gap up to 6 K, and possible transition from one- to two-component state
Authors: Siddharth Kumar Singh, Chengyu Wang, Adbhut Gupta, Kirk W. Baldwin, Loren N. Pfeiffer, Mansour Shayegan
Abstract: The fractional quantum Hall state (FQHS) observed in the lowest Landau level at filling factor $\nu=1/2$ in wide quantum wells has been enigmatic for decades because the two-dimensional electron system (2DES) has a bilayer charge distribution but with significant interlayer tunneling. Of particular interest is whether the 1/2 FQHS in this system has a one-component (1C) or two-component (2C) origin; these are typically identified as the Pfaffian (non-Abelian) or the $\Psi_{331}$ (Abelian) FQHSs, respectively. We report here our experimental study of the evolution of the correlated states of an ultrahigh-quality 2DES confined to a 72.5-nm-wide GaAs quantum well. At the lowest densities, the 2DES displays only odd-denominator FQHSs, and the ground state at $\nu = 1/2$ is a composite fermion Fermi sea. As the density is increased, a FQHS emerges at $\nu = 1/2$, and becomes very strong. In a finite density range where the 1/2 FQHS is strongest, we also observe its daughter FQHSs at $\nu = 8/17$ and 7/13, consistent with the theoretically expected daughter states of a Pfaffian 1/2 FQHS. At the highest densities, the 2DES becomes 2C, signaled by the emergence of a bilayer Wigner crystal state and the transitions of FQHSs flanking $\nu=1/2$. The 1/2 FQHS remains robust near this transition and, notably, its charge transport energy gap exhibits an \textit{upward} cusp with a maximum value of about 6 K on the 1C side of the transition; this is the largest gap reported for any even-denominator FQHS. Our observation of the transition of the 2DES ground states near $\nu=1/2$ to 2C states at high densities, and our measurements of the robustness of the 1/2 FQHS against charge distribution asymmetry, suggest that the 1/2 FQHS also makes a transition from 1C to 2C. Such a transition from a non-Abelian to Abelian state can open avenues for topological quantum information and quantum criticality.

Title: Effective linear response in non-equilibrium anyonic systems
Authors: Gu Zhang, Igor Gornyi, Yuval Gefen
Abstract: Linear response theory serves as a fundamental tool in the study of quantum transport, extensively employed to elucidate fundamental mechanisms related to the nature of the particles involved and the underlying symmetries. This framework is, however, limited to equilibrium or near-equilibrium conditions. Here, we develop an effective linear response theory designed to describe charge and thermal quantum transport, where the reference far-from-equilibrium stationary state comprises anyons forming a dilute beam. We apply our theory to study tunnel-coupled anyonic beams in collider geometries, enabling braiding, collisions, and tunneling of anyons at the central collider. Our linear-response transport coefficients directly reflect the fractional charge and statistics of the anyons involved, avoiding the need to measure higher-order current correlations. Moreover, the emergence of finite thermoelectric (Peltier and Seebeck) coefficients signifies the presence of real anyon collisions (as opposed to virtual braiding in the time domain), intimately associated with a broken particle-hole symmetry, specific to anyonic gases.

Title: Atomistic Machine Learning with Cartesian Natural Tensors
Authors: Qun Chen, A. S. L. Subrahmanyam Pattamatta, David J. Srolovitz, Mingjian Wen
Abstract: Atomistic machine learning (ML) is a transformative tool for accurate and efficient investigation of material behavior at the atomic scale. While such models have been constructed within Cartesian space to harness geometric information and preserve intuitive physical representations, they face inherent challenges - primarily due to the lack of a systematic symmetry-preserving framework for representing arbitrary physical tensors. We address these challenges by proposing Cartesian Natural Tensor Networks (CarNet) as a general framework for atomistic ML. We first develop the theory of irreducible representations using Cartesian natural tensors (their creation, operation, as well as the decomposition and reconstruction of physical tensors such as the elastic constant tensor). Leveraging this machinery, we design an equivariant Cartesian model and demonstrate its exceptional performance across diverse atomistic ML tasks. CarNet enables the development of highly accurate and reliable interatomic potentials for both materials and molecular systems. Furthermore, structure-property relationships can be readily constructed for tensorial quantities ranging from simple properties like the dipole moment to arbitrary high-rank tensors with complex symmetries such as the elastic constant tensor -- capabilities that were previously inaccessible. This work removes theoretical barriers and unleashes the power of Cartesian approaches for advanced atomistic ML in the understanding and design of new materials.

Title: Operator dependence and robustness of spacetime-localized response in a quantum critical spin chain
Authors: Daichi Imagawa, Keiju Murata, Daisuke Yamamoto
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of spacetime-localized response in a quantum critical spin system, with particular attention to how it depends on the spatial profile and operator content of the applied perturbation, as well as its robustness against increase of amplitude and temporal discretization. Motivated by recent theoretical proposals linking such response patterns to the anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory correspondence, we numerically analyze the real-time dynamics of the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model at criticality using the time-evolving block decimation algorithm. We find that sharply localized and periodically recurring responses emerge only for specific types of perturbations, namely those that correspond to local density fields in the continuum limit. In contrast, perturbations involving other spin components produce conventional propagating excitations without localization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the response remains qualitatively robust when the time-dependent perturbation is approximated by a piecewise-linear function, highlighting the practical relevance of our findings for quantum simulation platforms with limited temporal resolution. Our results clarify the operator dependence of emergent bulk-like dynamics in critical spin chains and offer guidance for probing holographic physics in experimental settings.

Title: Dynamics of the Kac Ring Model with switching scatterers
Authors: Leonid A. Bunimovich, Emilio N. M. Cirillo, Matteo Colangeli, Lamberto Rondoni
Abstract: We introduce a generalized version of the Kac ring model in which particles are of two types, black and white. Black particles modify the environment through which all particles move, thereby inducing indirect and potentially long-range interactions among them. Unlike the inert scatterers of Kac's original model, the scatterers in our setting possess internal states that change upon interaction with black particles and can be interpreted as energy levels of the environment. This makes the model self-consistent, as it incorporates a form of particle interactions, mediated by the environment, that drives the system toward some kind of stationary state. Although indirect and long-range interactions do not necessarily promote thermodynamic states, interactions are necessary for energy to be shared among the elementary constituents of matter, enabling the establishment of equipartition, which is a prerequisite for defining temperature. Therefore, our model is one step forward in this direction, elucidating the role of interactions and energy exchange. We prove that any initial state of the system converges to a time periodic state (i.e. a phase space orbit) and describe basins of attraction for some of such asymptotic periodic states.

Title: Strong coupling phases of conserved growth models are crumpled
Authors: Debayan Jana, Abhik Basu
Abstract: We show that stochastically driven nonequilibrium conserved growth models admit strong coupling phases for sufficiently strong nonlocal chemical potentials underlying the dynamics. The models exhibit generic roughening transitions between perturbatively accessible weak coupling phases satisfying an exact relation between the dynamic $z$ and roughness $\chi$ exponents in all dimensions $d$ and strong coupling phases. In dimensions below the critical dimension, the latter phases are unstable and argued to be crumpled, and thus distinct from the well-known strong coupling rough phase of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation in dimensions $d\geq 2$. At the critical dimension, conventional spatio-temporal scaling in the weak coupling phase is logarithmically modulated and are exactly obtained. These results obtained by employing a combination of nonperturbative arguments and perturbative theories, corroborated by numerical results.

Title: Direct observation of band structure modifications from monolayer WSe2 to Janus WSSe

Abstract: Janus monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), created by post-growth substitution of the top chalcogen layer, represent a new direction for engineering 2D crystal properties. However, their rapid ambient degradation and the difficulty of obtaining large-area monolayer samples have limited the available experimental probes, leaving their detailed electronic structure near the Fermi level largely unexplored. In this work, by performing micro-focused angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy ({\mu}-ARPES) on an identical sample transformed from monolayer WSe2 to Janus WSSe via a H2 plasma-assisted chalcogen-exchange method, we reveal the evolution of its electronic band structure. We observe ARPES signature consistent with the Rashba-type spin splitting due to broken horizontal mirror symmetry, and a significant upward shift of the highest valence band at the {\Gamma}-point by approximately 160 meV. These direct observations clarify the key electronic modifications that govern the material's properties and provide a pathway for band engineering in Janus TMDs.

Title: Quantum Linear Magnetoresistance: A Modern Perspective
Authors: Shuai Li, Huichao Wang
Abstract: Magnetoresistance is a powerful probe for characterizing the intrinsic physics embedded in materials. Among its various manifestations, linear magnetoresistance has a long history and continues attracting research interest. In contemporary studies, a clear understanding of the magnetoresistance character of quantum origin is more crucial than ever for the study of emerging materials. In this perspective, we examine the linear magnetoresistance of quantum mechanism, from its theoretical basis to experimental studies, and discuss open questions and promising future research directions in this field.

Title: Ground state and excitations of quasiperiodic 1D narrow-band moiré systems: a mean field approach
Authors: Nicolau Sobrosa, Miguel Gonçalves, Bruno Amorim, Eduardo V. Castro, Pedro Ribeiro
Abstract: We demonstrate that a mean field approximation can be confidently employed in quasiperiodic moiré systems to treat interactions and quasiperiodicity on equal footing. We obtain the mean field phase diagram for an illustrative one-dimensional moiré system that exhibits narrow bands and a regime with non-interacting multifractal critical states. By systematically comparing our findings with existing exact results, we identify the regimes where the mean field approximation provides an accurate description. Interestingly, in the critical regime, we obtain a quasifractal charge density wave, consistent with the exact results. To complement this study, we employ a real-space implementation of the time-dependent Hartree-Fock, enabling the computation of the excitation spectrum and response functions at the RPA level. These findings indicate that a mean field approximation to treat systems hosting multifractal critical states, as found in two-dimensional quasiperiodic moiré systems, is an appropriate methodology.

Title: Right-eigenstate-based approach to non-Hermitian superfluidity with two-body loss
Authors: Xuezhu Liu, Ming Lu, Haiwen Liu
Abstract: We theoretically explore a non-Hermitian superfluid model with complex-valued interaction, inspired by two-body loss stemming from inelastic scattering observed in ultracold atomic experiments. Utilizing both the right-eigenstate-based mean-field theory and its biorthogonal counterpart, we study the properties of the system. Notably, the right-eigenstate-based framework produces smooth and continuous solutions, in stark contrast to the absence of nontrivial solutions and the abrupt discontinuities observed in the biorthogonal-eigenstate-based framework under moderate dissipation. In addition, the lower condensation energy obtained in the former framework suggests its superior suitability for describing this system. Furthermore, we explore the impact of backscattering, a crucial factor in realistic systems. Our analysis reveals that, facilitated by two-body loss, even moderate backscattering destabilizes the superfluid state. Sufficiently strong backscattering completely destroys it, highlighting a key mechanism for the fragility of this non-Hermitian quantum phase.

Title: More bridging ligands activate direct exchange: the case of anisotropic Kitaev effective magnetic interactions
Authors: Pritam Bhattacharyya, Nikolay A. Bogdanov, Liviu Hozoi
Abstract: A magnet is a collection of magnetic moments. How those interact is determined by what lies in between. In transition-metal and rare-earth magnetic compounds, the configuration of the ligands around each magnetic center and the connectivity of the ligand cages are therefore pivotal -- for example, the mutual interaction of magnetic species connected through one single ligand is qualitatively different from the case of two bridging anions. Two bridging ligands are encountered in Kitaev magnets. The latter represent one of the revelations of the 21st century in magnetism research: they feature highly anisotropic intersite couplings with seemingly counterintuitive directional dependence for adjacent pairs of magnetic sites and unique quantum spin-liquid ground states that can be described analytically. Current scenarios for the occurrence of pair-dependent magnetic interactions as proposed by Kitaev rely on $indirect$ exchange mechanisms based on intersite electron hopping. Analyzing the wavefunctions of Kitaev magnetic bonds at both single- and multi-configuration levels, we find however that $direct$, Coulomb exchange may be at least as important, in 5$d$ and 4$d$ $t_{2g}^5$, 3$d$ $t_{2g}^5e_g^2$, and even rare-earth 4$f^1$ Kitaev-Heisenberg magnets. Our study provides concept clarification in Kitaev magnetism research and the essential reference points for reliable computational investigation of how novel magnetic ground states can be engineered in Kitaev, Kitaev-Heisenberg, and Heisenberg edge-sharing systems.

Title: Dynamic breaking of axial symmetry of acoustic waves in crystals as the origin of nonlinear inelasticity and chaos: Analytical model and MD simulations
Authors: Zbigniew Kozioł
Abstract: A Chain of Springs and Masses (CSM) model is used in the interpretation of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of movement of atoms in FCC crystals, oriented like during typical simulations performed in studies of the dynamics of line dislocations. The proposed description is inspired by and supported by MD simulations. We find out that a force that is perpendicular to the direction of the applied external shear pressure and in the direction of line dislocations occurs within the bulk of crystal volume. The force is of a dynamic origin, and it has not been analyzed so far. It is proportional to the square of the applied pressure; It causes breaking of axial symmetry for propagation of transverse acoustic waves. It leads to a non-linear and non-elastic response of crystals and to chaotic patterns in motion of atoms. We provide an analytical derivation of an effective atomistic potential for interaction between atoms and propose an analytical model of their dynamics. The model predicts some effects that may have been overlooked in experiments and are inconsistent with the static theory of elasticity of crystals.

Title: Longitudinal transport spin polarization of spin degenerate antiferromagnets
Authors: Meng Zhu, Jianting Dong, Xinlu Li, Jiahao Shentu, Yizhuo Song, Evgeny Y. Tsymbal, Jia Zhang
Abstract: A vital goal in spintronics is the efficient electrical generation of spin currents, a pursuit that has recently focused on using antiferromagnets (AFMs) as spin current sources. It has been demonstrated that antiferromagnets with broken PT symmetry (parity + time reversal) can efficiently generate longitudinal and transverse spin currents. At the same time, it has been generally thought that antiferromagnets with PT symmetry (PT-AFMs) forbid the longitudinal spin polarization due to their spin-degenerate band structure. Here, in contrast to this common expectation, we show, using theoretical analysis based on magnetic point group symmetry, that most PT-AFMs can generate longitudinal spin currents due to spin-orbit coupling. Using density-functional theory, we calculate the longitudinal spin conductivity of representative PT-AFMs, L10-MnPt and Mn2Au, and show that its magnitude is comparable to that of their PT-broken counterparts. Our symmetry-enabled classification of antiferromagnets and theoretical results for the longitudinal spin conductivity in representative PT-AFMs expands our understanding of spin transport and shows the possibility of robust spin-current generation in a broad range of spin-degenerate antiferromagnets.

Title: Variation Monte Carlo Study on the bilayer $t-J_{\parallel}-J_{\perp}$ model for La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$
Authors: Zeyu Chen, Yu-Bo Liu, Fan Yang
Abstract: The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity (HTSC) in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has aroused significant interest in exploring the pairing mechanism. Previous studies have proposed an effective d$_{x^2-y^2}$-orbital bilayer $t-J_{\parallel}-J_{\perp}$ model, in which the electrons of the d$_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital are charge carriers, which are subject to the intralayer antiferromagnetic (AFM) superexchange $J_{\parallel}$ and the large interlayer AFM superexchange $J_{\perp}\approx 2J_{\parallel}$, with the latter transferred from the nearly half-filled and hence localized $d_{z^2}$ orbital through the strong Hund's rule coupling. Here we study this model by the variational Monte Carlo (VMC) simulation and find a dominant interlayer s-wave pairing, in which the SC order parameters have a drastic improvement compared with those of the mean field (MF) type of theories. In real materials, the Hund's coupling is finite, leading to reduced $J_{\perp}$, dictating that the MF-type theories have difficulty explaining the HTSC. However, our VMC calculations find that even for effective $J_{\perp}$ as weak as $J_{\perp}=J_{\parallel}$, the interlayer pairing is still considerably large and can be compared with the $T_c$ observed in experiments, which is very weak in MF-type theories. This result indicates the important role of the Gutzwiller projection in improving the $T_c$, which is ignored in the MF-type theories. In addition, our results show that suppressed interlayer hopping can promote interlayer pairing, which is consistent with the fact that the interlayer hopping of the d$_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is very weak. Our research offers a new perspective for understanding the pairing mechanism of bilayer nickelates and provides a reference for recent ultra-cold atom experiments in mixed-dimensional systems.

Title: Interplay of order and disorder in two-dimensional critical systems with mixed boundary conditions
Authors: E.Eisenriegler
Abstract: In spin systems such as the Ising model, the local order and disorder can be characterized by the order-parameter and energy density profiles $\langle \sigma ({\bf r}_1) \rangle$ and $\langle \epsilon ({\bf r}_2) \rangle$, respectively. Does increasing the order at ${\bf r}_1$ always decrease the disorder at ${\bf r}_2$? Does increasing the disorder at ${\bf r}_2$ always decrease the order at ${\bf r}_1$? The answer to these questions is contained in the cumulant response function $\langle\sigma ({\bf r}_1) \, \epsilon ({\bf r}_2) \rangle^{(\rm cum)}$. This correlation function vanishes in the unbounded bulk but not in systems with fixed-spin boundary conditions. Using the universal operator-product expansion of $\sigma ({\bf r}_1) \, \epsilon ({\bf r}_2)$ and exact results for the Ising model, we analyze $\langle\sigma ({\bf r}_1) \, \epsilon ({\bf r}_2) \rangle^{(\rm cum)}$ in two-dimensional critical systems defined on the $x-y$ plane with mixed $+$ and $-$ boundary conditions. Particularly interesting behavior is found when either of the operators $\sigma$ or $\epsilon$ is located on a ``zero line" in the $x-y$ plane, along which $\langle\sigma ({\bf r})\rangle$ vanishes. Results for half-plane, triangular, and rectangular geometries are presented.

Title: Self-induced buckling in hollow microgels
Authors: Leah Rank, Emanuela Zaccarelli
Abstract: Hollow microgels are elastic polymer shells easily realisable in experiments. Recent works have shown the emergence of buckling events in single hollow microgels under the effect of an added osmotic pressure. Here, we perform large-scale simulations to show that these microgels at high enough packing fractions undergo spontaneous symmetry-breaking deformations ranging from single large dents to multiple indentations, even in the absence of any externally applied stress. This buckling phenomenology is thus self-induced, solely driven by interparticle crowding. We construct a phase diagram inspired by vesicle shape theories, mapping local curvature metrics as a function of the reduced volume, to quantify these findings, and we also propose ways to observe the occurrence of buckling in experiments. The present results thus rationalise the deformations occurring in suspensions of micro- and nano-scale elastic shells, offering a synthetic analogue to biological ones, allowing direct control on buckling instabilities for potential applications. Beyond materials design, these insights may also shed light on shape regulation in natural systems such as cells and vesicles, where similar deformations are observed.

Title: Optical conductivity and band gap in the double-Weyl candidate SrSi2 at ambient pressure
Authors: L. Z. Maulana, A. A. Tsirlin, E. Uykur, Y. Saito, M. Dressel, M. Imai, A. V. Pronin
Abstract: We probe the possible double-Weyl state in cubic SrSi2 using optical spectroscopy. The complex optical conductivity was measured in a frequency range from 70 to 22 000 cm-1 at temperatures down to 10 K at ambient pressure. The optical response of SrSi2 can be well separated into the intraband (free carriers) and interband contributions. Additionally, four infrared-active phonons are detected. As follows from the optical spectra, the free-carrier density decreases with decreasing temperature, consistent with an activation behaviour. Experimental interband conductivity juxtaposed with ab initio calculations shows that conventional density-functional theory fails to describe the electronic structure of SrSi2 in the vicinity of the Fermi level. A semi-local exchange-correlation potential allows a much better agreement with the experiment, resulting in the trivial (gapped) band structure of SrSi2. The direct gap estimated from the measurements is approximately 40 meV.

Title: Classification of Weyl point trajectories in multi-terminal Josephson junctions
Authors: Kento Takemura, Tomohiro Yokoyama
Abstract: Topological protection is an attractive signature in both fundamental and applied researches because it provides an exotic and robust state. Multi-terminal Josephson junctions have recently been studied extensively owing to the emergence of topologically protected Weyl points without the need for topological materials. In this study, we examine the dynamic properties of Weyl points in multi-terminal Josephson junctions. The junctions are modulated by external parameters, such as electric gate voltage, magnetic flux, bias voltage. The Weyl points are manipulated and draw trajectories accompanied by pair creation and annihilation. The trajectories form both closed loops and open lines. We classify these trajectories using the Chern number and the phase diagram.

Title: Novel family of near-room-temperature compensated itinerant pyrochlore ferrimagnets, $R{\mathrm{In}}{\mathrm{Co}}_{4}$ ($R=$ Dy-Tm)
Authors: T. Shiotani, T. Waki, Y. Tabata, I. Kézsmárki, H. Nakamura
Abstract: We successfully synthesized single crystals of a series of C15b Laves phase compounds, $R{\mathrm{In}}{\mathrm{Co}}_{4}$ ($R=$ Dy-Tm), with Co-pyrochlore and $R$-fcc sublattices, and systematically studied their magnetic properties via magnetometry measurements. These itinerant cubic compounds, with Curie temperatures above room temperature, show compensated ferrimagnetism featuring an antiferromagnetic coupling between the two sublattices. From this series, ${\mathrm{DyInCo}}_{4}$ exhibits the highest $T_{\rm C}$ (= 368 K) and a near-room-temperature compensation point $T_{\rm cp}$ (= 295 K). $T_{\rm C}$ does not change drastically with the $R$ atom, whereas $T_{\rm cp}$ depends on the de Gennes factor of $R^{3+}$. Another magnetization anomaly is observed in all the compounds at low temperatures, which may be indicative of changes in the lattice or magnetic structure. The easy axis the ferrimagnetic moment of ${\mathrm{DyInCo}}_{4}$, ${\mathrm{ErInCo}}_{4}$, and ${\mathrm{TmInCo}}_{4}$ is found at $T =$ 5 K to be along the [001], [111] and [110] directions, respectively. However, the simple easy-axis or easy-plane ferrimagnetic picture cannot be applied to ${\mathrm{HoInCo}}_{4}$. These observations suggest that the $R$ sublattice determines magnetic anisotropy and compensation, while the Co sublattice plays a role in strong magnetic ordering. The high Curie temperature, together with the magnetization compensation point near room temperature, renders these itinerant pyrochlore magnets interesting for spintronic applications.

Title: Mixing of a binary passive particle system using smart active particles
Authors: Thomas Jacob, Siddhant Mohapatra, Rajalingam A, Sam Mathew, Pallab Sinha Mahapatra
Abstract: Controlled activity of active entities interacting with a passive environment can generate emergent system-level phenomena, positioning such systems as promising platforms for potential downstream applications in targeted drug delivery, adaptive and reconfigurable materials, microfluidic transport and related fields. The present work aims to realise an optimal mixing of two segregated species of passive particles by introducing a small fraction of active particles (2% by composition) with adaptive and intelligent behaviour, directed by a trained Artificial Neural Network-based agent. While conventional run-and-tumble particles can induce mixing in the system, the smart active particles demonstrate superior performance, achieving faster and more efficient mixing. Interestingly, an optimal mixing strategy doesn't involve a uniform dispersion of active particles in the domain, but rather limiting their motion to an eccentrically placed zone of activity, inducing a global rotational motion of the passive particles about the system centre. A transition in the directionality of the passive particles' motion is observed along the radius towards the centre, likening the active particles' motion to an ellipse-shaped void with a defined surface speed. Situated at the intersection of active matter and machine learning, this work highlights the potential of integrating adaptive learning frameworks into traditional active matter models.

Title: Braids and Beams: Exploring Fractional Statistics with Mesoscopic Anyon Colliders
Authors: Bernd Rosenow, Bertrand I. Halperin
Abstract: Anyon colliders -- quantum Hall devices where dilute quasiparticle beams collide at a quantum point contact -- provide an interferometer-free probe of anyonic exchange phases through current cross correlations. Within a non-equilibrium bosonization framework, the normalized cross-correlations take a universal form depending only on the exchange phase and the dynamical exponent, enabling experimental demonstration of anyonic statistics. This result can be interpreted as time-domain interference -- braiding in time rather than spatial exclusion or real-space interferometry. Extension to hierarchical states shows that the semiclassical step-function description of quasiparticles fails at large statistical angles. Introducing a finite soliton width resolves this issue and enables quantitative modeling of charge-$e/5$ quasiparticle collisions.

Title: Integrable Floquet Time Crystals in One Dimension
Authors: Rahul Chandra, Mahbub Rahaman, Soumyabroto Majumder, Analabha Roy, Sujit Sarkar
Abstract: We demonstrate the realization of a discrete-time crystal (DTC) phase in a family of periodically driven, one-dimensional quadratic lattice Hamiltonians that can be obtained using spin chains. These interactions preserve integrability while opening controllable gaps at resonant quasienergies and pinning the emergent quasienergy modes that are responsible for subharmonics. We demonstrate that the DTC phase is rigid in the parameter space of transverse field and an additional interaction like NNN coupling strength, with the drive frequency optimized to produce the strongest subharmonic response. We also provide a detailed phase portrait of the model, exhibiting a variety of new dynamical phases, such as a fragile time crystal and both spin-liquid and paramagnetic phases, as well as sharp quantum phase transitions between them. Finite-size scaling of the Floquet quasienergy splitting between the emergent subharmonic mode and its conjugate shows that the DTC lifetime diverges exponentially with system size. Our work thus establishes a novel mechanism for realizing robust, long-lived DTCs in one dimension, and paves the way for their experimental realization in near-term quantum simulators. Motivation for this work stems from the limitations of disorder-based stabilization schemes that rely on many-body localization and exhibit only prethermal or finite-lived plateaus, eventually restoring ergodicity. Disorder-free routes are therefore highly desirable. Integrable (or Floquet-integrable) systems provide an attractive alternative because their extensive set of conserved quantities and constrained scattering strongly restrict thermalization channels. Our construction exploits these integrable restrictions together with short-range NNN engineering to produce a clean, robust DTC that avoids the prethermal fragility of disordered realizations.

Title: Spin-wave propagation at low temperatures in YIG thin films on YSGG substrates
Authors: José Elias Abrão, Daan Weltens, Rhodri Mansell, Sebastiaan van Dijken, Lukáš Flajšman
Abstract: The use of spin waves in magnetic thin films at cryogenic temperatures has long been hindered by the lack of a suitable material platform. Yttrium iron garnet (YIG) is the leading candidate, yet it is typically grown on gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) substrates, which develop a large paramagnetic moment at low temperatures. This substrate effect limits spin-wave propagation. In this work, we demonstrate that thin YIG films grown on yttrium scandium gallium garnet (YSGG) substrates support robust spin-wave propagation in the Damon-Eshbach geometry, measurable down to 2 K under applied magnetic fields up to 150 mT. Compared with YIG/GGG, YIG/YSGG films exhibit narrower ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) linewidths at low temperatures and are free from the atomic interdiffusion effects that degrade the performance of YIG/GGG systems. These results establish YIG/YSGG thin films as a promising low-temperature platform, overcoming the intrinsic limitations of YIG/GGG and opening new opportunities for scalable magnonic and hybrid quantum devices operating under cryogenic conditions.

Title: Defects in hexagonal boron nitride for quantum technologies
Authors: Tobias Vogl, Viktor Ivády, Isaac J. Luxmoore, Hannah L. Stern
Abstract: Atomic defects in solid-state materials are building blocks for future quantum technologies, such as quantum communication networks, computers, and sensors. Until recently, a handful of defects in a small selection of host materials have been possible candidates. Recent developments have revealed that hexagonal boron nitride, a wide-bandgap two-dimensional material, hosts single-photon-emitting atomic defects with access to optically addressable electronic and nuclear spins at room temperature. Now, atomically thin quantum devices that operate at ambient conditions are a possibility. In this perspective, we discuss the recent progress, and challenges, in understanding the fundamental photophysics of defects in hBN, as well as specific opportunities they present for the development of quantum technologies.

Title: Spatially focused magnetic hyperthermia: comparison of MRSh and sLLG equations
Authors: Zs. Iszály, A. Husztek, B. Mehmeti, Z. Erdélyi, Á. Szöőr, M. Béres, J. Korózs, V. Bacsó, I. Nándori, I. G. Márián
Abstract: Magnetic hyperthermia with metallic nanoparticles is a therapeutic strategy that relies on heating cancer cells to levels sufficient to damage or destroy them. After injection, the nanoparticles accumulate in tumor tissues, where they transfer energy from the applied time-dependent magnetic field to the surrounding medium, thereby increasing the local temperature. This heating effect can be spatially focused (superlocalized) by combining AC and DC magnetic fields. Heat generation arises either from the rotation of the particle or from the rotation of its magnetic moment. The theoretical framework is provided by the Martsenyuk-Raikher-Shliomis (MRSh) equation for the former and the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (sLLG) equation for the latter. However, by using the concept of magnetic and ordinary viscosity, the results of these approaches can be directly compared, which is our goal in this work, with special emphasis on their ability to achieve spatial localization. On the basis of this comparison, we propose the use of perpendicular AC and DC magnetic fields for image-guided thermal therapy with magnetic particle imaging.

Title: On the Origin of Carrier Loss in Mg-Doped N-Polar GaN
Authors: Masahiro Kamiyama, Shashwat Rathkanthiwar, Cristyan Quiñones-García, Seiji Mita, Dolar Khachariya, Pramod Reddy, Ronny Kirste, Ramón Collazo, Zlatko Sitar
Abstract: The neutral $(V_N-3Mg_{Ga})^0$ complex was found to be the primary compensator in Mg-doped, N-polar GaN. The experimental data showed a sharp drop in hole concentration once [Mg] exceeded ~$10^{19} cm^{-3}$. Temperature-dependent Hall measurements, in conjunction with a charge balance model, revealed that the carrier loss was due to a drastic reduction in acceptor concentration ($N_A$), suggesting that a significant fraction of Mg atoms incorporated in an electrically neutral configuration. A quantitative semi-empirical model based on the grand canonical formalism pointed to the formation of $(V_N-3Mg_{Ga})^0$ complexes as the primary cause for the observed carrier loss.

Title: Dynamic micromagnetism a la Ericksen-Leslie, allowing the Einstein-de Haas and Barnett effects
Authors: Amit Acharya, Siladitya Pal
Abstract: A model of dissipative micromagnetics coupled to elasticity is developed, following the procedures of the Ericksen-Leslie theory of nematic liquid crystals allowing for angular momentum due to magnetization. An outcome is the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert theory coupled to material spin. A further power-less augmentation to the angular momentum of the theory with classical kinetic energy density is also considered, which allows for plausible approaches to model the Einstein-de Haas and Barnett effects within continuum mechanics, as well as hard magnetic soft materials treated as constrained polar materials within the overall framework.

Title: Twist dominates bending in the liquid crystal organization of bacteriophage DNA
Authors: Pei Liu, Tamara Christiani, Zhijie Wang, Fei Guo, Mariel Vazquez, M. Carme Calderer, Javier Arsuaga
Abstract: DNA frequently adopts liquid-crystalline conformations in both cells and viruses. The Oseen--Frank framework provides a powerful continuum description of these phases through three elastic moduli: splay ($K_1$), twist or cholesteric ($K_2$), and bending ($K_3$). While $K_1$ is typically assumed to dominate, the relative magnitude of $K_2$ and $K_3$ in confined DNA remains poorly understood. Here, we combine cryo-electron microscopy, liquid-crystal modeling, and knot theory to quantify this relationship in bacteriophage P4, whose genome is partially organized in a spool-like liquid-crystalline phase. We first show experimentally that the ordered DNA occupies three concentric layers within the capsid. We then formulate an Oseen--Frank model for this geometry and use it, together with the measured layer radii, to estimate the elastic ratio $\alpha = K_3/K_2$. We find $\alpha \approx 0.0064$, indicating that twist elasticity overwhelmingly dominates bending. To validate this result, we perform Langevin dynamics simulations of DNA trajectories and classify the resulting knots. The predicted knot distribution agrees with experimental data from P4, demonstrating consistency between elasticity, topology, and observed genome organization.

Title: Systematic evolution of superconducting pairing strength and Seebeck coefficients in correlated infinite-layer La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$
Authors: Motoki Osada, Shusaku Imajo, Yuji Seki, Kousuke Ishida, Tsutomu Nojima, Kohei Fujiwara, Koichi Kindo, Yusuke Nomura, Atsushi Tsukazaki
Abstract: The recently discovered superconducting infinite-layer nickelates offer a novel platform to explore an exotic pairing mechanism in multi-band systems towards high-temperature superconductivity and associated rich quantum phases, contrasting with cuprates. Here, we show that infinite-layer (La,Sr)NiO$_2$ exhibits strong-coupling superconductivity, resilient to in-plane magnetic fields exceeding 47 T at optimal doping - more than twice the Pauli limit for conventional BCS superconductors. This violation becomes pronounced towards the underdoped regime, implying an intriguing evolution of pairing glue. The unexpected observation of positive Seebeck coefficients in this regime indicates the presence of nontrivial electron correlations. Furthermore, our comprehensive investigation across the superconducting dome reveals that the evolution of (thermo)electric normal-state properties - specifically, the sign changes of the Hall and Seebeck coefficients - coincide with the evolution of superconducting anisotropy and pairing strength. This demonstrates a definitive link between electron correlations and strong-coupling superconductivity in (La,Sr)NiO$_2$, contributing to a unified framework for understanding unconventional superconductivity.

Title: Identifying non-equilibrium fluctuations in Intracellular Motion Using Recurrent Neural Networks
Authors: Tomas Basile, Natascha Leijnse, Malte Slot Lauridsen, Younes Farhangi Barooji, Amin Doostmohammadi, Karel Proesmans
Abstract: Distinguishing active from passive dynamics is a fundamental challenge in understanding the motion of living cells and other active matter systems. Here, we introduce a framework that combines physical modeling, analytical theory, and machine learning to identify and characterize active fluctuations from trajectory data. We train a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network on synthetic trajectories generated from well-defined stochastic models of active particles, enabling it to classify motion as passive or active and to infer the underlying active process. Applied to experimental trajectories of a tracer in the cytoplasm of a living cell, the method robustly identifies actively driven motion and selects an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck active noise model as the best description. Crucially, the classifier's performance on simulated data approaches the theoretical optimum that we derive, and it also yields accurate estimates of the active diffusion coefficient. This integrated approach opens a powerful route to quantify non-equilibrium fluctuations in complex biological systems from limited data.

Title: Equilibrium properties of strongly confined fluids
Authors: Ana M. Montero
Abstract: The statistical-mechanical study of the equilibrium properties of fluids, starting from the knowledge of the interparticle interaction potential, is essential to understand the role that microscopic interaction between individual particles play in the properties of the fluid. The study of these properties from a fundamental point of view is therefore a central goal in condensed matter physics. These properties, however, might vary greatly when a fluid is confined to extremely narrow channels and, therefore, must be examined separately. This thesis investigates fluids in narrow pores, where particles are forced to stay in single-file formation and cannot pass one another. The resulting systems are highly anisotropic: motion is free along the channel axis but strongly restricted transversely. To quantify these effects, equilibrium properties of the confined fluids are compared with their bulk counterparts, exposing the role of dimensionality. We also develop a novel theoretical framework based on a mapping approach that converts single-file fluids with nearest-neighbor interactions into an equivalent one-dimensional mixture. This exact isomorphism delivers closed expressions for thermodynamic and structural quantities. It allows us to compute the anisotropic pressure tensor and revises definitions of spatial correlations to take into account spatial anisotropy. The theory is applied to hard-core, square-well, square-shoulder, and anisotropic hard-body models, revealing phenomena such as zigzag ordering and structural crossovers of spatial correlations. Analytical predictions are extensively validated against Monte Carlo and molecular dynamic simulations (both original and from the literature), showing excellent agreement across the studied parameter ranges.

Title: Learning Linear Regression with Low-Rank Tasks in-Context
Authors: Kaito Takanami, Takashi Takahashi, Yoshiyuki Kabashima
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a key building block of modern large language models, yet its theoretical mechanisms remain poorly understood. It is particularly mysterious how ICL operates in real-world applications where tasks have a common structure. In this work, we address this problem by analyzing a linear attention model trained on low-rank regression tasks. Within this setting, we precisely characterize the distribution of predictions and the generalization error in the high-dimensional limit. Moreover, we find that statistical fluctuations in finite pre-training data induce an implicit regularization. Finally, we identify a sharp phase transition of the generalization error governed by task structure. These results provide a framework for understanding how transformers learn to learn the task structure.

Title: Dynamic Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch-Slonczewski equations for spintronics
Authors: Pascal Thibaudeau, Mouad Fattouhi, Liliana D. Buda-Prejbeanu
Abstract: The atomistic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation is challenged when modeling spintronic devices where Joule heating is significant, due to its core assumption of a constant magnetization magnitude. Based on a statistical framework that treats the magnetization magnitude as a dynamic variable coupled to a thermal bath, we derive a dynamic Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch-Slonczewski set of equations for torques, that captures the transient, heating-induced demagnetization that occurs during high-current operation. Integrating these dynamic equations and comparing them to their stochastic equivalents reveals that both the energy landscape and switching dynamics in high-anisotropy systems are similarly modified. This approach yields accurate and accelerated predictions of critical currents and switching times.

Title: Directed percolation transition to active turbulence driven by non-reciprocal forces
Authors: Juliane U. Klamser, Ludovic Berthier
Abstract: We numerically study the collective dynamics of dense particle assemblies driven by non-reciprocal pairwise forces of amplitude $\kappa$. At a critical value $\kappa_{\rm c}$, the system undergoes a dynamical phase transition from an absorbing state ($\kappa < \kappa_{\rm c}$) to a chaotic steady state ($\kappa > \kappa_{\rm c}$). The chaotic phase is marked by nontrivial spatiotemporal velocity correlations and mixing, reminiscent of active turbulence in self-propelled systems. The sharp onset of chaos shows critical scaling consistent with the universality class of directed percolation. We argue that this transition is generic to a broad class of locally-driven, dense disordered materials.

Title: Investigating into mechanisms of high temperature strength of refractory high-entropy alloys
Authors: Sai Anandhi Seetharaman, Soumyadipta Maiti, Ambesh Gupta, Beena Rai
Abstract: The yield strength plateau of two BCC refractory high entropy alloys (RHEAs) - MoNbTaVW and MoNbTaW was examined through hybrid Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics (MC/MD) simulations. By analyzing atomic diffusivities derived from vacancy formation and migration energies around the edge dislocation cores, the number of critical atomic swaps were calculated at different temperatures. Using hybrid MC/MD simulations of these critical swaps, we demonstrate that above 1400K, the stress required to move the dislocations gets saturated, indicating the effect of Dynamic Strain Ageing (DSA) via cross core motion. Further simulations on random solid solutions (0 MC swaps) revealed a similar plateau effect at the intermediate temperatures. This was attributed to the additional athermal stress arising from lattice distortions due to solid solution strengthening. Our findings suggest that the yield strength plateau results from an interplay between the DSA-driven diffusion process and athermal stress. Specifically, the plateau emerges from DSA mechanisms in the presence of atomic diffusion, whereas in the absence of diffusion, it is governed by athermal statistical lattice distortions. This dual mechanism framework provides a comprehensive explanation for the experimentally observed Yield strength behavior in RHEAs at intermediate temperatures.

Title: Symmetry of Dipolar Molecular Gases
Authors: D. Baillie
Abstract: Recent experiments with degenerate molecular gases dressed by elliptically polarized microwave fields have opened new avenues for engineering dipolar interactions. We identify a set of symmetries of the interaction potential, which generate degeneracies among the interaction parameters, and use these to classify the resulting spatial symmetries and equilibrium shapes of the gases. Exploiting these symmetries we analyze solutions including beyond-meanfield quantum fluctuations, and develop complementary variational results. We then map out the phase diagram of self-bound droplets and characterize their key properties.

Title: Robust Kirkwood-Buff inversion in complex mixtures via reciprocal-space methods
Authors: Rémi Busselez
Abstract: Understanding the relationship between microscopic structure and macroscopic thermodynamic properties is a central challenge in the study of complex fluids. The Kirkwood-Buff (KB) theory offers an elegant and powerful framework for bridging this gap by relating integrals over pair correlation functions to measurable thermodynamic quantities. In multicomponent systems, KB integrals connect directly to derivatives of thermodynamic potentials, including chemical potentials derivatives, partial molar volumes, and isothermal compressibility. While several computational methods exist to estimate KB integrals from molecular simulations, their application often demands careful treatment of finite-size effects and explicit extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit. Recently, alternative strategies based on the analysis of partial structure factors in reciprocal space have been proposed. Unlike real-space approaches, reciprocal-space methods avoid the additional truncation artifacts associated with direct integration or fluctuations in subensemble. They evaluate density fluctuations across the entire simulation box, fully accounting for periodic boundary conditions rather than relying on subdomains. As a result, these methods offer a compelling alternative, providing enhanced numerical stability for estimating KB integrals in complex mixtures. In this work, we extend, compare and validate these methods using binary and quaternary Lennard-Jones mixtures, as well as realistic molecular systems such as hexane-ethanol, water-urea, and aqueous NaCl mixtures. Our results provide practical guidelines for computing KB integrals and associated thermodynamic properties from canonical ensemble simulations, including recommendations on reciprocal-space extrapolation, uncertainty estimation, and linear algebra formulations of thermodynamic derivatives.

Title: Pronounced orbital-selective electron-electron correlation and electron-phonon coupling in V2Se2O
Authors: Mingzhe Hu, Ziyin Song, Jingwen Cheng, Gexing Qu, Zhanghuan Li, Yu Huang, Jundong Zhu, Guangyu Zhang, Dacheng Tian, Lan Chen, Zhijun Tu, Hechang Lei, Xiaoping Ma, Huaixin Yang, Zhongxu Wei, Genfu Chen, Hongming Weng, Tian Qian, Hang Li
Abstract: Orbital-selective many-body effects, in which electrons occupying different orbitals experience distinct interaction strengths, play a crucial role in correlated multiorbital materials. However, these effects usually manifest in a complex manner, obscuring their microscopic origins. Here, by combining angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements with theoretical calculations, we reveal pronounced orbital selectivity in both electron-electron correlation and electron-phonon coupling in the van der Waals material V2Se2O. Electron correlation induces distinct bandwidth renormalization exclusively in the V d_xy-derived band, while the bands mainly composed of the other d orbitals remain essentially unrenormalized. Orbital-resolved analyses identify that the filling number and the bandwidth are decisive factors governing orbital-dependent correlation. Simultaneously, the d_(xz/yz)-derived band exhibits a sharp kink anomaly, arising from enhanced coupling to high-energy phonon modes dominated by oxygen vibrations. Such pronounced orbital selectivity positions V2Se2O as a rare and prototypical platform for unravelling the microscopic mechanisms of orbital-selective electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions, and offers guiding principles for the design of correlated multiorbital materials.

Title: Non-resonant spin injection of exciton-polaritons with halide perovskites at room temperature
Authors: Pablo Vaquer de Nieves, Elena Sendarrubias Arias-Camisón, Jorge Cuadra, Maksim Lednev, Raúl Gago, Luis Viña, Francisco José García Vidal, Johannes Feist, Ferry Prins, Carlos Antón Solanas
Abstract: Exciton-polaritons, hybrid photon-exciton quasiparticles, constitute a useful platform for the study of light-matter interaction and nonlinear photonic applications. In this work, we realize a monolithic Tamm-plasmon microcavity embedding a thin film of two-dimensional halide perovskites with a tunable polymer spacer that controls the exciton-photon detuning. Angle-resolved optical spectroscopy at room temperature reveals the lower polariton branch dispersions in the linear regime for several detunings. Under circularly polarized, non-resonant laser excitation, the spin injection of high-energy excitons and their relaxation towards the lower polariton branch demonstrates its preservation, in contrast to the bare exciton case. The spin-polarized emission survives due to the fast decay of polaritons. Our results provide promising insights into the non-resonant spin control of polaritonic devices, including chiral lasers and switches.

Title: Stability of graphene hyperbolic pseudospheres under harsh conditions
Authors: T. P. C. Klaver, R. Gabbrielli, V. Tynianska, A. Iorio, D. Legut
Abstract: We demonstrate the high stability of simulated graphene hyperbolic pseudospheres under large externally imposed deformations and high temperature annealing. Hyperbolic pseudospheres are produced in a two-step Molecular Dynamics simulation process. First, carbon atoms are forced down a thin three-dimensional volume of a chosen shape. During this extrusion process the carbon atoms form a precursor to graphene that is unrealistically less stable than graphite or diamond. Then the unstable carbon structure is annealed inside the thin volume at high temperature, turning the carbon into realistic polycrystalline, curved graphene. Point defects naturally appear in numbers and places that stabilize the graphene in the desired shape, without high residual stresses. We applied this new methodology to the creation of graphene hyperbolic pseudosphere surfaces, which reproduce analogs to some aspects of classical or quantum gravity. The free edges of the pseudosphere cause bending of the graphene. When these free edges are removed from the simulations by attaching periodic flat graphene sheets to the pseudosphere edges, the carbon atoms assume positions just some tenths of Å from the mathematical hyperbolic pseudosphere surface. In demanding tests of their stability, the hyperbolic pseudospheres proved stable against $20^\circ$ shearing or $20\%$ elongation and then being released, which eventually raised their temperatures by $\sim 300 \ \text{K}$. Our methodology is relatively easy to use and offers a practical way to create simulated curved graphene surfaces of almost any shape. It allows for thorough testing in advance of the stability of graphene shapes that are to be produced experimentally.

Title: Repulsive-Interaction-Driven Topological Superconductivity in a Landau Level Coupled to an $s$-Wave Superconductor
Authors: Koji Kudo, Ryota Nakai, Hiroki Isobe, J. K. Jain, Kentaro Nomura
Abstract: A two-dimensional topologically nontrivial state of noninteracting electrons, such as the surface state of a three-dimensional topological insulator, is predicted to realize a topological superconductor when proximity-coupled to an ordinary $s$-wave superconductor. In contrast, noninteracting electrons partially occupying a Landau level, with Rashba spin-orbit coupling that lifts the spin degeneracy, fail to develop topological superconductivity under similar proximity coupling in the presence of the conventional Abrikosov vortex lattice. We demonstrate through exact diagonalization that, at half-filled Landau level, introducing a repulsive interaction between electrons induces topological superconductivity for a range of parameters. This appears rather surprising because a repulsive interaction is expected to inhibit, not promote, pairing, but suggests an appealing principle for realizing topological superconductivity: proximity-coupling a composite Fermi liquid to an ordinary $s$-wave superconductor.

Title: AtomWorld: A Benchmark for Evaluating Spatial Reasoning in Large Language Models on Crystalline Materials
Authors: Taoyuze Lv, Alexander Chen, Fengyu Xie, Chu Wu, Jeffrey Meng, Dongzhan Zhou, Bram Hoex, Zhicheng Zhong, Tong Xie
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at textual reasoning and are beginning to develop spatial understanding, prompting the question of whether these abilities can be combined for complex, domain-specific tasks. This question is essential in fields like materials science, where deep understanding of 3D atomic structures is fundamental. While initial studies have successfully applied LLMs to tasks involving pure crystal generation or coordinate understandings, a standardized benchmark to systematically evaluate their core reasoning abilities across diverse atomic structures has been notably absent. To address this gap, we introduce the AtomWorld benchmark to evaluate LLMs on tasks based in Crystallographic Information Files (CIFs), a standard structure representation format. These tasks, including structural editing, CIF perception, and property-guided modeling, reveal a critical limitation: current models, despite establishing promising baselines, consistently fail in structural understanding and spatial reasoning. Our experiments show that these models make frequent errors on structure modification tasks, and even in the basic CIF format understandings, potentially leading to cumulative errors in subsequent analysis and materials insights. By defining these standardized tasks, AtomWorld lays the ground for advancing LLMs toward robust atomic-scale modeling, crucial for accelerating materials research and automating scientific workflows.

Title: Correlative Analysis of Iron-Driven Structural, Optical, and Magnetic Properties in Natural Biotite Crystals

Abstract: Biotite crystals are phyllosilicate trioctahedral micas with the general chemical formula K(Mg,Fe)3AlSi3O10(OH)2 that form a solid-solution series with iron-poor phlogopite and iron-rich annite endmembers. With a wide band gap energy and a layered structure with free surface charges, biotite nanosheets can be readily obtained by cleavage methods and used as dielectrics in nanodevice fabrication for the next generation of electronics and energy harvesting. Here, a comprehensive study of biotite samples with different iron concentrations and oxidation states is presented. Structural, optical, magneto-optical, and magnetic characterizations were performed using several experimental techniques, including state-of-the-art synchrotron-based techniques, to correlate the iron chemistry (content and oxidation state) with the macroscopic properties of both minerals. The study reveals a nanoscale-homogeneous Fe distribution via synchrotron X-ray fluorescence mapping, defect-mediated optical transitions modulated by Fe3+/Fe2+ ratios, and temperature-dependent magnetic transitions from paramagnetism to competing ferro-/antiferromagnetic interactions. Furthermore, the use of these biotite crystals as substrates for ultrathin heterostructures incorporating monolayer (ML) MoSe2 is explored by magneto photoluminescence at cryogenic temperatures. The results show that the presence of iron impurities in different oxidation states significantly impacts the valley properties for ML-MoSe2. Overall, these findings offer a comprehensive interpretation of the physical properties of bulk biotites in a correlative approach, serving as a robust reference for future studies aiming to explore biotites in their ultrathin form.

Title: Finite temperature dopant-induced spin reorganization explored via tensor networks in the two-dimensional $t$-$J$ model
Authors: Yintati Zhang, Aritra Sinha, Marek M. Rams, Jacek Dziarmaga
Abstract: Doped Mott insulators host intertwined spin-charge phenomena that evolve with temperature and can culminate in stripe order or superconductivity at low temperatures. The two-dimensional $t$-$J$ model captures this interplay yet finite-temperature, infinite-size calculations remain difficult. Using purification represented by a tensor network - an infinite projected entangled-pair state (iPEPS) ansatz - we simulate the $t$-$J$ model at finite temperature directly in the thermodynamic limit, reaching temperatures down to one tenth of the hopping rate and hole concentrations up to one quarter of the lattice sites. Beyond specific heat, uniform susceptibility, and compressibility, we introduce dopant-conditioned multi-point correlators that map how holes reshape local exchange. Nearest-neighbor hole pairs produce a strong cooperative response that reinforces antiferromagnetism on the adjacent parallel bonds, and single holes weaken nearby antiferromagnetic bonds; d-wave pairing correlations remain short-ranged over the same window. These results provide experiment-compatible thermodynamic-limit benchmarks and establish dopant-conditioned correlators as incisive probes of short-range spin-texture reorganization at finite temperature.

Title: Electronic and thermal properties of the phase-change memory material, Ge2Sb2Te5, and results from spatially resolved transport calculations
Authors: Kishor Nepal, Aashish Gautam, Ridwan Hussein, Konstantinos Konstantinou, Stephen. R. Elliott, Chinonso Ugwumadu, David A. Drabold
Abstract: We report new insights into the electronic, structural, and transport (heat and charge) properties of the phase-change memory material Ge2Sb2Te5. Using realistic structural models of Konstantinou et. al. [Nat. Commun. 10, 3065 (2019)], we analyze the topology, electronic states, and lattice dynamics with density functional methods, including hybrid-functional calculations and machine-learned interatomic potentials. The Kohn-Sham orbitals near the Fermi level display a strong electron-phonon coupling, and exhibit large energy fluctuations at room temperature. The conduction tail states exhibit larger phonon-induced fluctuations than the valence tail states. To resolve transport at the atomic scale, we employ space-projected electronic conductivity and site-projected thermal conductivity methods. Local analysis of heat transport highlights the role of filamentary networks dominated by Te, with Sb and Ge making progressively smaller contributions.

Title: Refined spin Hamiltonian on the Cairo pentagonal lattice of Bi2Fe4O9

Abstract: The frustrated magnet Bi2Fe4O9 has been reported to exhibit complex spin dynamics coexisting with conventional spin wave excitations. The magnetic Fe3+ (S = 5/2) ions are arranged into a distorted two-dimensional Cairo pentagonal lattice with weak couplings between the layers, developing long-ranged non-collinear antiferromagnetic order below 245 K. In order to enable studies and modelling of the complex dynamics close to TN, we have reexamined the magnetic excitations across the complete energy scale (0 < E < 90 meV) at 10 K. We discover two distinct gaps, which can be explained by introducing, respectively, easy axis and easy plane anisotropy on the two unequivalent Fe-sites. We develop a refined spin Hamiltonian that accurately accounts for the dispersion of essentially all spin-wave branches across the full spectral range, except around 40 meV, where a splitting and dispersion are observed. We propose that this mode is derived from phonon hybridization. Polarisation analysis shows that the system has magnetic anisotropic fluctuations, consistent with our model. A continuum of scattering is observed above the spin wave branches and is found to principally be explained by an instrumental resolution effect. The full experimental mapping of the excitation spectrum and the refined spin Hamiltonian provides a foundation for future quantitative studies of spin waves coexisting with unconventional magnetic fluctuations in this frustrated magnet found at higher temperatures.

Title: Systematic cRPA study of two-dimensional MA$_2$Z$_4$ materials: From unconventional screening to correlation-driven instabilities
Authors: F. Bagherpour, Y. Yekta, H. Hadipour, E. Sasioglu, A. Khademi, S. A. Jafari, I. Mertig, S. Lounis
Abstract: Understanding the interplay between screening, electronic correlations, and collective excitations is essential for the design of two-dimensional quantum materials. Here, we present a comprehensive first-principles study of more than 60 MA$_2$Z$_4$ monolayers, encompassing semiconducting, metallic, cold-metallic, magnetic, and topological phases. Using the constrained random phase approximation (cRPA), we compute material-specific effective Coulomb interaction parameters $U$, $U'$, and $J$, including their spatial dependence across distinct correlated subspaces defined by local coordination and crystal symmetry. In semiconducting compounds, long-range nonlocal interactions persist, revealing unconventional screening and suggesting strong excitonic effects beyond simple dielectric models. In cold-metallic systems, sizable long-range Coulomb interactions remain despite the presence of free carriers, highlighting their atypical metallic screening. Among 33-valence-electron compounds, we find $U_{\mathrm{eff}} > W$ in the $\beta_2$ phase, indicating proximity to charge-density-wave or Mott instabilities. Several V- and Nb-based systems exhibit intermediate-to-strong correlation strength, with $U/W > 1 $ in multiple cases. Using cRPA-derived Stoner parameters, we identify magnetic instabilities in various V-, Nb-, Cr-, and Mn-based compounds. Finally, selected cold-metallic systems display plasmon dispersions that deviate from the conventional $\sqrt{q}$ behavior, revealing nearly non-dispersive low-energy modes. These results position MA$_2$Z$_4$ monolayers as a versatile platform for investigating correlation-driven instabilities and emergent collective behavior in two dimensions.

Title: Geometric Mechanics of Thin Periodic Surfaces
Authors: Wenqian Sun, Yanxin Feng, Christian D. Santangelo, D. Zeb Rocklin
Abstract: Thin surfaces are ubiquitous in nature, from leaves to cell membranes, and in technology, from paper to corrugated containers. Structural thinness imbues them with flexibility, the ability to easily bend under light loads, even as their much higher stretching stiffness can bear substantial stresses. When surfaces have periodic patterns of either smooth hills and valleys or sharp origami-like creases this can substantially modify their mechanical response. We show that for any such surface, there is a duality between the surface rotations of an isometric deformation and the in-plane stresses of a force-balanced configuration. This duality means that of the six possible combinations of global in-plane strain and out-of-plane bending, exactly three must be isometries. We show further that stressed configurations can be expressed in terms of both the applied deformation and the isometric deformation that is dual to the pattern of stress that arises. We identify constraints rooted in symplectic geometry on the three isometries that a single surface can generate. This framework sheds new light on the fundamental limits of the mechanical response of thin periodic surfaces, while also highlighting the role that continuum differential geometry plays in even sharply creased origami surfaces.

Title: Experimental observation of frustration and large anomalous Nernst effect in metallo-molecular spin Kondo lattice interfaces
Authors: Servet Ozdemir, Matthew Rogers, Conor J. McCluskey, Raymond G. McQuaid, Mannan Ali, Gavin Burnell, Joseph Barker, B J Hickey, Oscar Cespedes
Abstract: Frustration in Kondo spin lattice systems has led to the emergence of both spin liquids that could be chiral and strange metals that deviate from Fermi liquid behaviour when not in their antiferromagnetic ground state. In two dimensions (2D), where deviations from bulk systems are expected, Kondo spin lattice emergence have recently been observed in van der Waals systems. Metallo-molecular interfaces of supramolecular lattices have also been suggested as an alternative 2D Kondo spin lattice system where a single-ion Kondo effect as well as an inter spin-site Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) coupling has been demonstrated in scanning tunnelling spectroscopy (STS) studies. Here, going beyond ultrahigh vacuum STS studies on metallo-molecular interfaces, we report a metastable frustrated antiferromagnetic state, with ultra-high spin freezing temperatures (T_f), ranging from 240 K to 300 K on the interfaces of highly textured Pt(111) and Pt(111)/Co films with organic molecules grown in ultra-high vacuum 10^(-10) mbar. In the vicinity of the spin-freezing transition, we measure a large anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) in the Pt/Co/molecular heterostructure, with a Nernst coefficient of at least 3 microV per K. Our results suggest a 2D metallo-molecular Kondo spin lattice with high temperature quantum correlations where an ANE beyond magnetisation is manifested around room temperature.

Title: Anyon interactions in the Chern--Simons--Landau--Ginzburg model of the fractional quantum Hall effect
Authors: Paul Leask
Abstract: The interactions of anyonic quasi-particles (vortices) in the Chern--Simons extension of the Ginzburg--Landau model is investigated and we show that it manifestly realizes a hybridization of type I/II superconductivity. Through Gauss' law, each vortex simultaneously carries a flux quantum and a proportional Noether charge, thereby realizing an anyonic excitation. The Chern--Simons coupling also modifies the screening structure of the gauge fields, producing complex-conjugate masses that yield a common penetration depth with an oscillatory phase. This altered asymptotic behavior breaks the conventional type-I/type-II dichotomy of the Ginzburg--Landau model. As a result, vortex anyons experience short-range repulsion and long-range attraction, enabling the formation of separated multi-vortex bound states with non-monotonic interaction energy.

Title: Chasing Anharmonicities in Polarization-Orientation Raman Spectra of Acene Crystals with Machine Learning
Authors: Paolo Lazzaroni, Shubham Sharma, Mariana Rossi
Abstract: We present a first-principles machine-learning computational framework to investigate anharmonic effects in polarization-orientation (PO) Raman spectra of molecular crystals, focusing on anthracene and naphthalene. By combining machine learning models for interatomic potentials and polarizability tensors, we enable efficient, large-scale simulations that capture temperature-dependent vibrational dynamics beyond the harmonic approximation. Our approach reproduces key qualitative features observed experimentally. We show, systematically, what are the fingerprints of anharmonic lattice dynamics, thermal expansion, and Raman tensor symmetries on PO-Raman intensities. However, we find that the simulated polarization dependence of Raman intensities shows only subtle deviations from quasi-harmonic predictions, failing to capture the pronounced temperature-dependent changes that have been reported experimentally in anthracene. We propose that part of these inconsistencies stem from the impossibility to deconvolute certain vibrational peaks when only experimental data is available. This work therefore provides a foundation to improve the interpretation of PO-Raman experiments in complex molecular crystals with the aid of theoretical simulations.

Title: Magnetic Moment Fragmentation in an All-in-All-out Pyrochlore $\mathrm{Nd_2Sn_2O_7}$
Authors: Yi Luo, Matthew Powell, Joseph A. M. Paddison, Brenden R. Ortiz, J. Ross Stewart, Joseph W. Kolis, Adam A. Aczel
Abstract: We report single crystal neutron spectroscopy and bulk characterization on hydrothermally grown $\mathrm{Nd_2Sn_2O_7}$, revealing magnetic moment fragmentation embedded within the all-in-all-out ordered state. The spectra reveal a nearly flat band with pinch-point momentum dependence accompanied by dispersive branches that produce half-moon features across multiple Brillouin zones. These defining signatures are captured quantitatively by a minimal dipolar-octupolar spin Hamiltonian, demonstrating excellent agreement between experiment and theory. The higher flat-mode energy helps account for the absence of dynamical interference in prior $\mathrm{\mu SR}$ studies, while the lack of any photon-like excitation imposes strict constraints on the proposed Coulombic antiferromagnet scenario. Our results extend moment fragmentation to $\mathrm{Nd_2Sn_2O_7}$ and identify it as a clean, tractable platform for quantitative exploration of emergent gauge field physics in frustrated magnets.

Title: A network-based approach to measure granule size distribution for discrete element modeling of granulation
Authors: Shubham Jain, Anurag Tripathi, Jayanta Chakraborty, Jitendra Kumar
Abstract: Drum granulation is a size enlargement process where granular material is agitated with a liquid binder to form larger size granules. Discrete element modeling is increasingly being used to better understand and investigate the granulation process. However, unlike experiments the measurement of granule size within a DEM framework often necessitates an explicit quantitative definition of a granule and a corresponding granule identification method. In this work, we show that the existing definitions and the associated methods in literature are ineffective at identifying granules for dense flows such as during drum granulation. We propose an improved definition and granule identification method based on community-detection used in network science literature. The proposed method better identifies granules in a drum granulator as benchmarked against liquid-settling. We also vary granulation process parameters like liquid content and fill level and study their effect on the cumulative granule size distribution attained after drum granulation. We find that the existing granule-identification methods fail to reproduce the well-known effects of process parameters on the cumulative granule size distribution. The proposed method, based on community detection, reproduces the effects with better accuracy.

Title: Effect of ice nucleating proteins on the structure-property relationships of ice: A molecular dynamics study
Authors: A. K. Shargh, C. D. Stiles, J. A. El-Awady
Abstract: Ice-nucleating proteins (INPs) are a unique class of biological macromolecules that catalyze the freezing of supercooled water far more efficiently than homogeneous nucleation. Their remarkable efficiency has motivated applications across diverse sectors, including agricultural frost protection, food processing and packaging, biomedical cryopreservation, and even strategies for mitigating glacier ice loss. The ice-nucleation performance of INPs and the mechanical behavior of the ice they produce depend strongly on their structural and biochemical characteristics. However, the links between INP properties, the resulting ice microstructure, and their mechanical behavior have yet to be systematically established. In this study, coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulations using the machine-learned ML-BOP potential are employed to investigate how varying INP densities influence the ice nucleation temperature, the resulting ice microstructure, and the mechanical behavior of the formed ice under creep tensile loading. We find that, depending on their density, INPs can significantly raise the ice nucleation rate while altering the grain structure of ice. Our simulations reveal that INP-assisted nucleation leads to faster stabilization of the resulting polycrystalline ice composed of hexagonal ice (ice Ih) and cubic ice (ice Ic) as compared to nucleation in pure water. Moreover, higher INP densities and smaller ice grain sizes reduce the overall yield stress, while promoting diffusion-accommodated grain boundary sliding creep. These findings provide molecular-level insight into how INPs influence both the nucleation process and the mechanical behavior of ice, highlighting a pathway to engineer ice with tailored stability for real-world settings, including human activities and infrastructure in polar and icy environments.

Title: Variational optimization of projected entangled-pair states on the triangular lattice
Authors: Jan Naumann, Jens Eisert, Philipp Schmoll
Abstract: We introduce a general corner transfer matrix renormalization group algorithm tailored to projected entangled-pair states on the triangular lattice. By integrating automatic differentiation, our approach enables direct variational energy minimization on this lattice geometry. In contrast to conventional approaches that map the triangular lattice onto a square lattice with diagonal next-nearest-neighbour interactions, our native formulation yields improved variational results at the same bond dimension. This improvement stems from a more faithful and physically informed representation of the entanglement structure in the tensor network and an increased number of variational parameters. We apply our method to the antiferromagnetic nearest-neighbour Heisenberg model on the triangular and kagome lattice, and benchmark our results against previous numerical studies.

Abstract: Oxygen reduction catalysts frequently suffer from degradation under harsh operating conditions, and the limited understanding of the underlying mechanisms hampers the development of effective mitigation strategies. In this study, we integrate first-principles calculations with a time-dependent microkinetic model to investigate the deactivation pathways of six highly active metal phthalocyanines (MPc, M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Ru, Rh, and Ir) during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). We quantitatively assess the ORR processes, hydrogen peroxide generation, radical generation, and three primary degradation mechanisms, namely carbon oxidation, nitrogen protonation, and demetallation, through a reaction network involving 40 chemical species and 75 elementary reactions. Our findings reveal that the dominant degradation mechanism varies significantly across the MPcs. Under typical alkaline conditions, the primary byproducts arise from carbon oxidation, driven by .OH radical attack and structural reorganization of surface adsorbates, and from protonation at either the metal center or nitrogen sites. In the kinetics-controlled region, the ORR activity follows the order of RhPc > IrPc > FePc > MnPc > RuPc > CrPc. Notably, RhPc and IrPc demonstrate both higher ORR activity and greater stability than the widely studied FePc under elevated potentials.

Title: The two conduction bands of monolayer CrSBr on Au
Authors: Yogal Prasad Ghimirey, Laxman Nagireddy, Cephise Cacho, Neil R. Wilson, Matthew D. Watson
Abstract: We report the electronic structure of monolayer CrSBr exfoliated onto mica template-stripped gold substrates. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy reveals charge transfer from the substrate, populating the conduction band of monolayer CrSBr, accompanied by a pronounced reduction in the quasiparticle band gap. Furthermore, we observe two separate conduction bands that exhibit a splitting at the X point. This indicates a breaking of glide-mirror symmetry, which in the bulk or in a free-standing monolayer protects the band degeneracies at the Brillouin zone boundary. Our results demonstrate that ultraflat gold substrates do more than modify carrier densities and screening: they can lift symmetry-protected degeneracies and thus fundamentally reshape the band topology of 2D materials.

Title: Fermionic influence superoperator for transport through Majorana zero modes
Authors: Jia-Lin Pan, Zi-Fan Zhu, Shixuan Chen, Yu Su, Yao Wang
Abstract: In recent years, the study of Majorana signatures in quantum transport has become a central focus in condensed matter physics. Here, we present a rigorous and systematic derivation of the fermionic superoperator describing the open quantum dynamics of electron transport through Majorana zero modes, building on the techniques introduced in Phys. Rev. B 105, 035121 (2022). The numerical implementation of this superoperator is to construct its differential equivalence, the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM). The HEOM approach describes the system-bath correlated dynamics. Furthermore, we also develop a functional derivative scheme that provides exact expressions for the transport observables in terms of the auxiliary density operators introduced in the HEOM formulation. The superoperator formalism establishes a solid theoretical foundation for analyzing key transport signatures that may uncover the unique characteristics of Majorana physics in mesoscopic systems.

Title: Controlling an altermagnetic spin density wave in the kagome magnet CsCr3Sb5
Authors: Zihao Huang, Chenchao Xu, Yande Que, Yi Liu, Ranjith Shivajirao, Zheng Jue Tong, Amit Kumar, Chao Cao, Guang-Han Cao, Hong-Jun Gao, Bent Weber
Abstract: The interplay of charge and spin orders lies at the heart of correlated electron physics and plays a critical role in the emergence of unconventional quantum phases. Kagome magnets provide a particularly promising platform to investigate these phenomena, owing to their geometrically frustrated lattice structure. However, resolving spin and charge orders microscopically and establishing ways to control them remain fundamental challenges. Here, we demonstrate magnetic field control of an altermagnetic spin density wave order intertwined with charge density wave order in kagome magnet CsCr3Sb5. Scanning tunneling microscopy down to deep cryogenic temperature of 50 mK reveals two previously unreported charge density wave orders in the Sb surface. Density functional theory confirms that one of them is coupled to a spin density wave with an altermagnetic ground state. The charge density waves can be tuned in both amplitude and phase by an external magnetic field, reflected in domain switching and stripe sliding of the charge density wave. Our findings deepen the understanding of symmetry-breaking in kagome systems, providing a tunable platform to explore the interplay of electronic correlation with emergent quantum magnetism.

Title: Emergent Electronic Flat Bands Through Dislocation Defect Phase Patterning: Effective One-Dimensional Model
Authors: Aziz Fall, Kaushik Dayal
Abstract: Recent theoretical work has predicted that dislocation patterning induces anisotropic flat bands in the electronic band diagram, which can lead to unusual effects such as unconventional superconductivity. This work develops a reduced-dimensional framework to provide insights into their origin. An effective one-dimensional dislocation potential is constructed by averaging over the spatial distributions of dislocations along a singular direction. The resulting model introduces a parameter that quantifies the strain modulation, thereby providing a transparent approach to analyze the role of dislocation strain in leading to flat band formation.

Title: Comparing fine-tuning strategies of MACE machine learning force field for modeling Li-ion diffusion in LiF for batteries
Authors: Nada Alghamdi, Paolo de Angelis, Pietro Asinari, Eliodoro Chiavazzo
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are transforming materials science and engineering by enabling the study of complex phenomena, such as those critical to battery operation. In this work, we benchmark the MACE machine learning model against a well-trained DeePMD potential for predicting interstitial lithium diffusivity in LiF, a key component in the solid electrolyte interphase in Li ion batteries. Our results demonstrate that the MACE-MPA-0 foundational model achieves comparable accuracy to well-trained DeePMD, in predicting key diffusion properties based on molecular dynamics simulation, while requiring minimal or no training data. For instance, the MACE-MPA-0 predicts an activation energy Ea of 0.22 eV, the fine-tuned model with only 300 data points predicts Ea = 0.20 eV, both of which show good agreement with the DeePMD model reference value of Ea = 0.24 eV. In this work, we provide a solid test case where fine-tuning approaches - whether using data generated for DeePMD or data produced by the foundational MACE model itself - yield similar robust performance to the DeePMD potential trained with over 40,000 actively learned data, albeit requiring only a fraction of the training data.

Title: Role of chromium oxides and carbides in strengthening CoCrFeNi multi-principle element alloys
Authors: Artur Olejarz, Wenyi Huo, Anna Kosinska, Maciej Zielinski, Tomasz Stasiak, Marcin Chmielewski, Wojciech Chmurzynski, Max Rae Chu, Michael Patrick Short, Lukasz Kurpaska
Abstract: Multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs) can potentially offer exceptional material properties, but their complex, costly manufacturing limits their scalability. Chemical complexity and complex manufacturing processes lead to the formation of some secondary phases, which have a significant impact on the final properties. In this work, chromium compound dispersoid enhancements (Cr- oxides and carbides) were formed in CoCrFeNi MPEAs to enhance their microstructural and high-temperature mechanical properties. A single FCC phase was observed in the arc melted (AM) samples, chromium oxides were detected in the gas-atomized (GA) samples, and Cr2O3 with Cr23C6 or Cr7C3 was found in the mechanically alloyed (MA)samples depending on the sintering temperature. Mechanical tests at room temperature and 575°C, where no phase evolution is expected, showed that the GA samples with oxides achieved enhanced mechanical properties at 575°C. This was co-induced by precipitation strengthening, recrystallization suppression, and twinning-induced plasticity. The MA samples with carbides exhibited high strength but low ductility, with Cr7C3 outperforming Cr23C6 because of its lower hardness and twinning effects. This work links chromium compound evolution to mechanical performance of MPEAs, offering insights to optimize HEA production for high-temperature applications through controlled phase formation.

Title: Field-Theoretic Simulation of Dean-Kawasaki Dynamics for Interacting Particles
Authors: Jaehyeok Jin, Chen Liu, David R. Reichman
Abstract: The formulation of a fluctuating hydrodynamic theory for interacting particles is a crucial step in the theoretical description of liquids. The microscopic mappings proposed decades ago by Dean and Kawasaki have played a central role in the analytical treatment of such problems. However, the singular mathematical nature of the density distributions used in these derivations raises concerns about the validity and practical utility of the resulting stochastic partial differential equations, particularly for direct numerical simulations. Recent efforts have centered on establishing a rigorous coarse-graining procedure to regularize the effective Dean-Kawasaki equation. Building on this foundation, we numerically investigate weakly interacting fluids within such a regularized framework for the first time. Our work reveals, at the level of structural correlations, the effects of regularization on the Dean-Kawasaki formalism and paves the way for improved numerical approaches to simulate fluctuating hydrodynamics in liquids.

Title: Casimir Stabilization of Fluctuating Electronic Nematic Order
Authors: Ola Carlsson, Sambuddha Chattopadhyay, Jonathan B. Curtis, Frieder Lindel, Lorenzo Graziotto, Jérôme Faist, Eugene Demler
Abstract: Vacuum cavity control of quantum materials is the engineering of quantum materials systems through electromagnetic zero-point fluctuations. In this work we articulate a generic mechanism for vacuum optical control of correlated electronic order: Casimir control, where the zero-point energy of the electromagnetic continuum, the Casimir energy, depends on the properties of the material system. To assess the experimental viability of this mechanism we focus on the Casimir stabilization of fluctuating nematic order. In nematic Fermi liquids, different orientations of the electronic order are often energetically degenerate. Thus, while local domains of fixed orientation may form, thermal disordering inhibits long range order. By engineering the electromagnetic environment of the electronic system, however, we show that the Casimir energy can be used as a tool to preferentially stabilize particular orientations of the nematic order. As a concrete example, we examine the interplay between a birefringent crystal -- which sources an anisotropic electromagnetic environment -- and a quantum Hall stripe system, an archetypal nematic Fermi fluid. We show that for experimentally feasible setups, the anisotropy induced by the orientation dependent Casimir energy can be $10^4$ times larger than other mechanisms known to stabilize quantum Hall stripes. This finding convincingly implies that our setting may be realized with currently available experimental technology. Having demonstrated that the Casimir energy can be used to stabilize fluctuating nematic order, we close by discussing the implications for recent terahertz cavity experiments on quantum Hall stripes, as well as pave the road towards broader Casimir control of competing correlated electronic phases.

Title: Tritium Separation from Gaseous 1,2,3H Isotopologue Mixtures by Selective Adsorption on Ag-Exchanged Zeolite Type Y
Authors: Alexandra Becker, Holger Lippold, Michael Hirscher, Cornelius Fischer
Abstract: Efficient separation of hydrogen isotopologues is crucial for applications such as the recycling of exhaust streams in nuclear fusion reactors. Using thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS), we report, for the first time, on separation experiments of a ternary 1,2,3H isotope mixture, achieving tritium enrichment of 70% from an initially equimolar (1:1:1) gas mixture, based on selective adsorption using an Ag(I)-exchanged zeolite type Y. Further experiments on binary hydrogen isotope mixtures validated numerical predictions of the separation efficiency for T2. Specifically, the high selectivity for tritium over protium of 38.2 makes the Ag(I)-exchanged zeolite an excellent candidate for energy-efficient isotope separation at liquid-nitrogen temperature.

Title: Assessing the impact of contact time on leachate chemistry from recycled concrete aggregates
Authors: Morgan D. Sanger, Gabrielle Campagnola, Robin Ritchey, Tuncer B. Edil, Matthew Ginder-Vogel
Abstract: Recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) is recognized as a readily available, mechanically sufficient construction and demolition waste product that is suitable as a base course substitute for natural, virgin aggregate in pavement construction. Environmentally responsible applications of RCA must consider the high alkalinity, high pH leachate, and heavy metal leaching risks reported in the literature. The existing body of literature does not address discrepancies between field and laboratory measurements of RCA leachate pH, nor are there any existing studies of aged RCA leachate composition as a function of time. To consider the influence of contact time on RCA leachate, the present study evaluates recovered RCA base course samples from the Minnesota Road Research highway construction study site using modified batch test methodology. Leachate pH, alkalinity, and calcium ion (Ca2+) concentration were monitored for 24 hours to understand RCA leachate chemistry during the initial contact period. Leachate pH is high upon initial contact with water (pH > 10) and decreases over time as it reacts with atmospheric carbon dioxide. Calcium ion concentration increases rapidly in the initial contact period, then more gradually as calcium saturation is reached. Alkalinity stabilizes (50-65 mg CaCO3/L) after a dramatic increase during the initial contact period.

Title: High Cycle S-N curve prediction for Al 7075-T6 alloy using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
Authors: Aryan Patel
Abstract: Aluminum is a widely used alloy, which is susceptible to fatigue failure. Characterizing fatigue performance for materials is extremely time and cost demanding, especially for high cycle data. To help mitigate this, a transfer learning based framework has been developed using Long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) in which a source LSTM model is trained based on pure axial fatigue data for Aluminum 7075-T6 alloy which is then transferred to predict high cycle torsional S-N curves. The framework was able to accurately predict Al torsional S-N curves for a much higher cycle range. It is the belief that this framework will help to drastically mitigate the cost of gathering fatigue characteristics for different materials and help prioritize tests with better cost and time constraints.

Title: A century of the Bose-Einstein condensation concept and half a century of the JINR experiments for observation of condensate in the superfluid 4He (He II)
Authors: Valentin Zagrebnov (I2M)
Abstract: This short review is devoted to celebration of two major events in quantum physics. The first one is the birth of the concept of Bose-Einstein condensation (1925) and the second is the experimental proof that it does exist and appears in the liquid 4He simultaneously with superfluidity below the $\lambda$-point (1975). The both of these events are tightly related to the Bogoliubov theory of superfluidity (1947). The existence of condensate in the system of interacting bosons is the key ansatz of this theory. Therefore, the experiments started in JINR in 1975 confirmed this prediction of the Bogoliubov theory that superfluidity of the liquid 4He (He II) should emerge at the same time as the Bose-Einstein condensation.

Title: Mixed Stochastic-Deterministic Density Functional Theoretic Decomposition of Kubo-Greenwood Conductivities in the Projector Augmented Wave Formalism
Authors: Vidushi Sharma, Lee A. Collins, Alexander J. White
Abstract: Pairing the accuracy of Kohn-Sham density-functional framework with the efficiency of a stochastic algorithmic approach, mixed stochastic-deterministic Density Functional Theory (mDFT) achieves a favorable computational scaling with system sizes and electronic temperatures. We employ the recently developed mDFT formalism to investigate the dynamic charge-transport properties of systems in the warm dense matter regime. The optical conductivity spectra are computed for single- and multi- component mixtures of carbon, hydrogen, and beryllium using two complementary approaches: Kubo-Greenwood in the mDFT picture and real-time Time-Dependent mDFT. We further devise a decomposition of the Onsager coefficients leading up to the Kubo-Greenwood spectra to exhibit contributions from the deterministic, stochastic, and mixed electronic state transitions at different incident photon energies.

Title: A Holographic prescription for generalized Schwinger-Keldysh contours
Authors: Martin Ammon, Jette Germerodt, Christoph Sieling, Julio Virrueta
Abstract: We provide a holographic prescription to compute real-time thermal correlators with arbitrary operator ordering. In field theory, these correlation functions are captured by a multi-fold Schwinger-Keldysh time contour. We propose a holographic dual for these contours, which generalizes the gravitational Schwinger-Keldysh geometry previously advocated in the literature. Our geometry consists of multiple AdS-black holes glued together at the future and past horizons, with matching conditions determined by unitarity and the KMS condition. As a proof of concept, we solve for a probe scalar field in this geometry and compute bulk-bulk and bulk-boundary propagators, in terms of which we evaluate the 4-point functions at tree-level. We show that in perturbation theory, the lowest-order diagrams that contribute non-trivially to the out-of-time order four-point function are exchange diagrams which explore the full four-fold geometry. Furthermore, these diagrams reduce to a simple factorized expression. We propose a conjecture on the structure of higher order observables and provide a partial proof by studying a subset of the contributing diagrams.

Title: Training Variation of Physically-Informed Deep Learning Models
Authors: Ashley Lenau, Dennis Dimiduk, Stephen R. Niezgoda
Abstract: A successful deep learning network is highly dependent not only on the training dataset, but the training algorithm used to condition the network for a given task. The loss function, dataset, and tuning of hyperparameters all play an essential role in training a network, yet there is not much discussion on the reliability or reproducibility of a training algorithm. With the rise in popularity of physics-informed loss functions, this raises the question of how reliable one's loss function is in conditioning a network to enforce a particular boundary condition. Reporting the model variation is needed to assess a loss function's ability to consistently train a network to obey a given boundary condition, and provides a fairer comparison among different methods. In this work, a Pix2Pix network predicting the stress fields of high elastic contrast composites is used as a case study. Several different loss functions enforcing stress equilibrium are implemented, with each displaying different levels of variation in convergence, accuracy, and enforcing stress equilibrium across many training sessions. Suggested practices in reporting model variation are also shared.

Title: Dimension dependence of critical phenomena in long-range percolation
Authors: Tom Hutchcroft
Abstract: Statistical mechanical systems at and near their points of phase transition are expected to exhibit rich, fractal-like behaviour that is independent of the small-scale details of the system but depends strongly on the dimension in which the model is defined. Moreover, many models are conjectured to have an upper critical dimension with important quantitative and qualitative differences between critical behaviour at, above, and below the upper critical dimension. For models with long-range interactions, one expects additional transitions between effectively long-range and effectively short-range regimes, with further marginal effects on the boundary of these two regimes, leading to (at least) eight qualitatively distinct forms of critical behaviour in total for each given model. We give a broad overview of these conjectures aimed at a general mathematical audience before surveying the significant recent progress that has been made towards understanding them in the context of long-range percolation.

Title: Approaching the scaling limit of transport through lattices with dephasing
Authors: Subhajit Sarkar, Gabriela Wójtowicz, Bartłomiej Gardas, Marek M. Rams, Michael Zwolak
Abstract: We examine the stationary--state equations for lattices with generalized Markovian dephasing and relaxation. When the Hamiltonian is quadratic, the single--particle correlation matrix has a closed system of equations even in the presence of these two processes. The resulting equations have a vectorized form related to, but distinct from, Lyapunov's equation. We present an efficient solution that helps to achieve the scaling limit, e.g., of the current decay with lattice length. As an example, we study the super--diffusive--to--diffusive transition in a lattice with long--range hopping and dephasing. The approach enables calculations with up to $10^4$ sites, representing an increase of $10$ to $40$ times over prior studies. This enables a more precise extraction of the diffusion exponent, enhances agreement with theoretical results, and supports the presence of a phase transition. There is a wide range of problems that have Markovian relaxation, noise, and driving. They include quantum networks for machine--learning--based classification and extended reservoir approaches (ERAs) for transport. The results here will be useful for these classes of problems.

Title: Binary $ZnSe:Fe^{2+}$ and ternary $ZnMgSe:Fe^{2+}$ optical crystals for mid-IR applications
Authors: Sergei V. Naydenov, Oleksii K. Kapustnyk, Igor M. Pritula, Dmitro S. Sofronov, Igor S. Terzin, Nazar O. Kovalenko
Abstract: In this study, binary $ZnSe:Fe^{2+}$ crystals and ternary $Zn_{1-x}Mg_{x}Se:Fe^{2+}$ crystals $(0 < x < 0.6)$ were grown by the vertical Bridgman method in graphite crucibles under high argon pressure. A comparative characterization of the structural, energetic, and optical parameters of the obtained crystals was performed. Theoretical explanations of the observed experimental characteristics, including the specific red-shift of the absorption and emission spectra with increasing solid-solution concentration, are provided. These results could be useful for the development of new laser media based on simple and complex AIIBVI crystals and for targeted engineering of their optical properties.

Title: Clifford Circuits Augmented Grassmann Matrix Product States
Authors: Atis Yosprakob, Wei-Lin Tu, Tsuyoshi Okubo, Kouichi Okunishi, Donghoon Kim
Abstract: Recent advances in combining Clifford circuits with tensor network (TN) states have shown that classically simulable disentanglers can significantly reduce entanglement, mitigating the bond-dimension bottleneck in TN simulations. In this work, we develop a variational TN framework based on Grassmann tensor networks, which natively encode fermionic statistics while preserving locality. By incorporating locally defined Clifford circuits within the fermionic formalism, we simulate benchmark models including the tight-binding and $t$-$V$ models. Our results show that Clifford disentangling removes the classically simulable component of entanglement, leading to a reduced bond dimension and improved accuracy in ground-state energy estimates. Interestingly, imposing the natural Grassmann-evenness constraint on the Clifford circuits significantly reduces the number of disentangling gates, from 720 to just 32, yielding a far more efficient implementation. These findings highlight the potential of Clifford-augmented Grassmann TNs as a scalable and accurate tool for studying strongly correlated fermionic systems, particularly in higher dimensions.

Title: Quantum Emission in Monolayer WSe2 Transferred onto InP Nanowires
Authors: Palwinder Singh, Jasleen Kaur Jagde, Megha Jain, Edith Yeung, David B. Northeast, Simona Moisa, Seid J. Mohammed, Jean Lapointe, Una Rajnis, Annika Kienast, Philip J. Poole, Dan Dalacu, Kimberley C. Hall
Abstract: Localized quantum emitters in transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have recently emerged as solid-state candidates for on-demand sources of single photons. Due to the role of strain in the site-selective creation of TMD emitters, their hybrid integration into photonic structures such as cavities and waveguides is possible using pick-and-place methods. Here we investigate quantum emission from a hybrid structure consisting of a monolayer of WSe2 interfaced with horizontally aligned InP nanowires (NWs). Our experiments reveal multiple narrow and bright emission peaks in the 715-785 nm spectral range and g(2)(0) as low as 0.049, indicating strong antibunching and good single photon purity. The faceted nature of III-V NWs provides unique opportunities for strain engineering, including the potential for placement of emitters on the top surface for optimal coupling. Our findings pave the way for realizing hybrid quantum light sources for integrated quantum photonics that could combine III-V quantum dots with TMD emitters into a single platform.

Title: Operational Quasiprobability in Quantum Thermodynamics: Work Extraction by Coherence and Non-joint Measurability
Authors: Jeongwoo Jae, Junghee Ryu, Hoon Ryu
Abstract: We employ the operational quasiprobability (OQ) as a work distribution, which reproduces the Jarzynski equality and yields the average work consistent with the classical definition. The OQ distribution can be experimentally implemented through the end-point measurement and the two-point measurement scheme. Using this framework, we demonstrate the explicit contribution of coherence to the fluctuation, the average, and the second moment of work. In a two-level system, we show that non-joint measurability, a generalized notion of measurement incompatibility, can increase the amount of extractable work beyond the classical bound imposed by jointly measurable measurements. We further prove that the real part of Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability (KDQ) and the OQ are equivalent in two-level systems, and they are nonnegative for binary unbiased measurements if and only if the measurements are jointly measurable. In a three-level Nitrogen-vacancy center system, the OQ and the KDQ exhibit different amounts of negativities while enabling the same work extraction, implying that the magnitude of negativity is not a faithful indicator of nonclassical work. These results highlight that coherence and non-joint measurability play fundamental roles in the enhancement of work.

Title: Turning Down the Noise: Power-Law Decay and Temporal Phase Transitions
Authors: Lieuwe Bakker, Suvendu Barik, Vladimir Gritsev, Emil A. Yuzbashyan
Abstract: We determine the late-time dynamics of a generic spin ensemble with inhomogeneous broadening - equivalently, qubits with arbitrary Zeeman splittings - coupled to a dissipative environment with strength decreasing as $1/t$. The approach to the steady state follows a power law, reflecting the interplay between Hamiltonian dynamics and vanishing dissipation. The decay exponents vary non-analytically with the ramp rate, exhibiting a cusp singularity, and $n$-point correlation functions factorize into one- and two-point contributions. Our exact solution anchors a universality class of open quantum systems with explicitly time-dependent dissipation.

Title: Probing Geometry of Next Token Prediction Using Cumulant Expansion of the Softmax Entropy
Authors: Karthik Viswanathan, Sang Eon Park
Abstract: We introduce a cumulant-expansion framework for quantifying how large language models (LLMs) internalize higher-order statistical structure during next-token prediction. By treating the softmax entropy of each layer's logit distribution as a perturbation around its "center" distribution, we derive closed-form cumulant observables that isolate successively higher-order correlations. Empirically, we track these cumulants in GPT-2 and Pythia models on Pile-10K prompts. (i) Structured prompts exhibit a characteristic rise-and-plateau profile across layers, whereas token-shuffled prompts remain flat, revealing the dependence of the cumulant profile on meaningful context. (ii) During training, all cumulants increase monotonically before saturating, directly visualizing the model's progression from capturing variance to learning skew, kurtosis, and higher-order statistical structures. (iii) Mathematical prompts show distinct cumulant signatures compared to general text, quantifying how models employ fundamentally different processing mechanisms for mathematical versus linguistic content. Together, these results establish cumulant analysis as a lightweight, mathematically grounded probe of feature-learning dynamics in high-dimensional neural networks.

Title: Higher symmetry breaking and non-reciprocity in a driven-dissipative Dicke model
Authors: Jacquelyn Ho, Yue-Hui Lu, Tai Xiang, Tsai-Chen Lee, Zhenjie Yan, Dan M. Stamper-Kurn
Abstract: Higher symmetries in interacting many-body systems often give rise to new phases and unexpected dynamical behavior. Here, we theoretically investigate a variant of the Dicke model with higher-order discrete symmetry, resulting from complex-valued coupling coefficients between quantum emitters and a bosonic mode. We propose a driven-dissipative realization of this model focusing on optomechanical response of a driven atom tweezer array comprised of $n$ sub-ensembles and placed within an optical cavity, with the phase of the driving field advancing stepwise between sub-ensembles. Examining stationary points and their dynamical stability, we identify a phase diagram for $n\geq 3$ with three distinctive features: a $\mathbb{Z}_n$ ($\mathbb{Z}_{2n}$) symmetry-breaking superradiant phase for even (odd) $n$, a normal unbroken-symmetry phase that is dynamically unstable due to non-reciprocal forces between emitters, and a first-order phase transition separating these phases. This $n$-phase Dicke model may be equivalently realized in a variety of optomechanical or opto-magnonic settings, where it can serve as a testbed for studying high-order symmetry breaking and non-reciprocal interactions in open systems.

Title: Atomtronic routing of dipolar bosons in a four-well star potential
Authors: Karin Wittmann W., Leandro H. Ymai, Genessi Sá Neto, Angela Foerster
Abstract: The ability to precisely control and predict the evolution of quantum states is a fundamental requirement for advancing quantum technologies. Here, we develop tunable atomic routing protocols based on an integrable model of dipolar bosons confined in a four-well potential with a star-shaped configuration. By adjusting the system parameters, we identify a harmonic dynamical regime of the atomic population that can be treated analytically, providing a complete description of the system's behaviour for precise manipulation. We demonstrate three independent modes of control over the atomic population dynamics under the action of an external field: frequency tuning via variation in the field intensity, directional switching via spatial displacement of the field, and amplitude modulation by varying its duration. These modes operate under two distinct configurations: one source and two drains, and, in reverse order, two sources and one drain. These cases emulate an atomic 1:2 demultiplexer and 2:1 multiplexer, respectively. Our results may contribute to the development of control mechanisms in the design of quantum devices.

Title: Lovász Meets Lieb-Schultz-Mattis: Complexity in Approximate Quantum Error Correction
Authors: Jinmin Yi, Ruizhi Liu, Zhi Li
Abstract: Approximate quantum error correction (AQEC) provides a versatile framework for both quantum information processing and probing many-body entanglement. We reveal a fundamental tension between the error-correcting power of an AQEC and the hardness of code state preparation. More precisely, through a novel application of the Lovász local lemma, we establish a fundamental trade-off between local indistinguishability and circuit complexity, showing that orthogonal short-range entangled states must be distinguishable via a local operator. These results offer a powerful tool for exploring quantum circuit complexity across diverse settings. As applications, we derive stronger constraints on the complexity of AQEC codes with transversal logical gates and establish strong complexity lower bounds for W state preparation. Our framework also provides a novel perspective for systems with Lieb-Schultz-Mattis type constraints.

Title: Continuum Model of Isospectrally Patterned Lattices
Authors: Fotis K. Diakonos, P. Schmelcher
Abstract: Isospectrally patterned lattices (IPL) have recently been shown to exhibit a rich band structure comprising both regimes of localized as well as extended states. The localized states show a single center localization behaviour with a characteristic localization length. We derive a continuum analogue of the IPL which allows us to determine analytically its eigenvalue spectrum and eigenstates thereby obtaining an expression for the localization length which involves the ratio of the coupling among the cells of the lattice and the phase gradient across the lattice. This continuum model breaks chiral symmetry but still shows a pairing of partner states with positive and negative energies except for the ground state. We perform a corresponding symmetry analysis which illuminates the continuum models structure as compared to a corresponding chirally symmetric Hamiltonian.

Title: Far-from-equilibrium thermodynamics of non-Abelian thermal states
Authors: Franklin L. S. Rodrigues, Eric Lutz
Abstract: Noncommutativity of observables is a central feature of quantum physics. It plays a fundamental role in the formulation of the uncertainty principle for complementary variables and strongly affects the laws of thermodynamics for systems with noncommuting, that is, non-Abelian, conserved quantities. We here derive nonequilibrium generalizations of the second law of thermodynamics in the form of fluctuation relations, both for mechanically and thermally driven quantum systems. We identify a non-Abelian contribution to the energy and entropy balances, without which these relations would be violated. The latter term can be controlled to enhance both work extraction and nonequilibrium currents compared to what is obtained in commuting thermodynamics. These findings demonstrate that noncommutativity maybe a useful thermodynamic resource.

Abstract: We report a significant advancement in ultra low power light-by-light phase modulation using open semiconductor microcavities in the strong light-matter coupling regime. We achieve cross-phase modulation of up to 247$\pm$17 mrad per particle between laser beams attenuated to single-photon average intensities. This breakthrough extends the potential for quantum information processing and nonlinear quantum optics in strongly coupled light-matter systems, setting a new benchmark in the field without relying on atom-like emitters. Our findings suggest promising new avenues for scalable quantum optical technologies.

Title: Mixed-precision ab initio tensor network state methods adapted for NVIDIA Blackwell technology via emulated FP64 arithmetic
Authors: Cole Brower, Samuel Rodriguez Bernabeu, Jeff Hammond, John Gunnels, Sotiris S. Xanthea, Martin Ganahl, Andor Menczer, Örs Legeza
Abstract: We report cutting-edge performance results via mixed-precision spin adapted ab initio Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) electronic structure calculations utilizing the Ozaki scheme for emulating FP64 arithmetic through the use of fixed-point compute resources. By approximating the underlying matrix and tensor algebra with operations on a modest number of fixed-point representatives (``slices''), we demonstrate on smaller benchmark systems and for the active compounds of the FeMoco and cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes with complete active space (CAS) sizes of up to 113 electrons in 76 orbitals [CAS(113, 76)] and 63 electrons in 58 orbitals [CAS(63, 58)], respectively, that the chemical accuracy can be reached with mixed-precision arithmetic. We also show that, due to its variational nature, DMRG provides an ideal tool to benchmark accuracy domains, as well as the performance of new hardware developments and related numerical libraries. Detailed numerical error analysis and performance assessment are also presented for subcomponents of the DMRG algebra by systematically interpolating between double- and pseudo-half-precision. Our analyis represents the first quantum chemistry evaluation of FP64 emulation for correlated calculations capable of achieving chemical accuracy and emulation based on fixed-point arithmetic, and it paves the way for the utilization of state-of-the-art Blackwell technology in tree-like tensor network state electronic structure calculations, opening new research directions in materials sciences and beyond.

Title: Information-thermodynamic bounds on precision in interacting quantum systems
Authors: Ryotaro Honma, Tan Van Vu
Abstract: The thermodynamic uncertainty relation quantifies a trade-off between the relative fluctuations of trajectory currents and the thermodynamic cost, indicating that the current precision is fundamentally constrained by entropy production. In classical bipartite systems, it has been shown that information flow between subsystems can enhance the current precision alongside thermodynamic dissipation. In this study, we investigate how information flow, local dissipation, and quantum effects jointly constrain current fluctuations within a subsystem of interacting quantum systems. Unlike classical bipartite systems, quantum subsystems can exhibit simultaneous state changes and maintain quantum coherence, which fundamentally alters the precision-dissipation trade-off. For this general setting, we derive a quantum thermokinetic uncertainty relation for interacting multipartite systems, establishing a thermodynamic trade-off between current fluctuations, information flow, local dissipation, and quantum effects. Our analysis shows that, in addition to local dissipation, both information exchange and quantum coherence play essential roles in suppressing current fluctuations. These results have important implications for the performance of quantum thermal machines, such as information-thermodynamic engines and quantum clocks. We validate our theoretical findings through numerical simulations on two representative models: an autonomous quantum Maxwell's demon and a quantum clock. These results extend uncertainty relations to multipartite open quantum systems and elucidate the functional role of information flow in fluctuation suppression.

Title: Surface Acoustic Wave Gas Sensors: Innovations in Functional Materials, Sensing Dynamics, and Signal Analysis
Authors: Suman Acharya, Balasubramanian Srinivasan, David Shanahan, Utz Roedig, Alan O Riordan, Veda Sandeep Nagaraja
Abstract: Surface Acoustic Wave gas sensors have garnered increasing attention as highly sensitive, miniaturized, and wireless compatible platforms for molecular detection. Their unique ability to convert surface perturbations into measurable acoustic shifts makes them ideal for gas sensing across diverse environments. This review synthesizes reported SAW platforms across substrates and modes Rayleigh, SH-SAW, Love links transduction pathways to material choice, and benchmarks performance for key analytes, e.g., NO2, NH3, VOCs, CO2, etc. We catalogue nanostructured oxides, polymers, carbon based films, and hybrid heterojunction coatings, highlighting attributes such as porosity, surface chemistry, and interfacial charge transfer that govern sensitivity and reversibility. We also highlight the emerging use of SAW devices to probe adsorption desorption dynamics, offering analyte specific interaction signatures beyond equilibrium, offering a new perspective into analyte specific interaction pathways. Additionally, the integration of machine learning is discussed as a transformative tool for signal decoding, environmental compensation, and adaptive calibration. We also identify key challenges, cross sensitivity, signal drift, material degradation, and deployment at the edge and review recent strategies to address them. Looking ahead, we envision the evolution of SAW platforms into intelligent, autonomous sensing systems with applications in environmental monitoring, industrial process control, and healthcare diagnostics.

Title: The role of entropy production and thermodynamic uncertainty relations in the thermalization of open quantum systems
Authors: Álvaro Tejero
Abstract: The asymmetry between heating and cooling in open quantum systems is a hallmark of nonequilibrium dynamics, yet its thermodynamic origin has remained unclear. Here, we investigate the thermalization of a quantum system weakly coupled to a thermal bath, focusing on the entropy production rate and the quantum thermokinetic uncertainty relation (TKUR). We derive an analytical expression for the entropy production rate, showing that heating begins with a higher entropy production, which drives faster thermalization than cooling. The quantum TKUR links this asymmetry to heat current fluctuations, demonstrating that larger entropy production suppresses fluctuations, making heating more stable than cooling. Our results reveal the thermodynamic basis of asymmetric thermalization and highlight uncertainty relations as key to nonequilibrium quantum dynamics.

Title: Non-local electrical detection of spin-polarized surface currents in the 3D topological insulator BiSbTeSe$_{2}$
Authors: Shaham Jafarpisheh, Frank Volmer, Zhiwei Wang, Bárbara Canto, Yoichi Ando, Christoph Stampfer, Bernd Beschoten
Abstract: The spin-polarized surface states in topological insulators offer unique transport characteristics that make them distinguishable from trivial conductors. Here, we detect the impact of these surface states in the topological insulator BiSbTeSe$_{2}$ by electrical means using a non-local transport configuration with ferromagnetic Co/Al$_2$O$_3$ electrodes. We show that the non-local measurement allows to probe the surface currents flowing along the whole surface, i.e.~from the top along the side to the bottom surface and back to the top surface along the opposite side. Increasing the temperature increases the interaction between bulk and surface states, which shortens this non-local current path along the surface and hence leads to a complete disappearance of the non-local signal at around 20K. Interestingly, we observe that the ratio between spin signal to background signal is much larger in the non-local geometry compared to the local one. Given that the observed ratio in the non-local geometry aligns well with expectations for spin-polarized surface states, our findings suggest that an as-yet unresolved mechanism diminishes the spin signal in the local geometry.

Title: Gumbel statistics for entanglement spectra of many-body localized eigenstates
Authors: Wouter Buijsman, Vladimir Gritsev, Vadim Cheianov
Abstract: An entanglement spectrum encodes statistics beyond the entanglement entropy, of which several have been studied in the context of many-body localization. We numerically study the extreme value statistics of entanglement spectra of many-body localized eigenstates. The physical information encoded in these spectra is almost fully carried by the few smallest elements, suggesting the extreme value statistics to have physical significance. We report the surprising observation of Gumbel statistics. Our result provides an analytical, parameter-free characterization of many-body localized eigenstates.

Title: Sensitivity of the spectral form factor to short-range level statistics
Authors: Wouter Buijsman, Vadim Cheianov, Vladimir Gritsev
Abstract: The spectral form factor is a dynamical probe for level statistics of quantum systems. The early-time behaviour is commonly interpreted as a characterization of two-point correlations at large separation. We argue that this interpretation can be too restrictive by indicating that the self-correlation imposes a constraint on the spectral form factor integrated over time. More generally, we indicate that each expansion coefficient of the two-point correlation function imposes a constraint on the properly weighted time-integrated spectral form factor. We discuss how these constraints can affect the interpretation of the spectral form factor as a probe for ergodicity. We propose a new probe, which eliminates the effect of the constraint imposed by the self-correlation. The use of this probe is demonstrated for a model of randomly incomplete spectra and a Floquet model supporting many-body localization.

Title: Quantum-critical transport in marginal Fermi-liquids
Authors: Hideaki Maebashi, Chandra M. Varma
Abstract: We use the Kubo response functions to calculate the electrical and thermal conductivity and Seebeck coefficient at low temperatures and frequencies in the quantum-critical region for fermions on a lattice. The theory uses scattering of the fermions with the previously derived collective fluctuations due to topological defects of the quantum xy model coupled to fermions. The microscopic model is applicable to the fluctuations of the loop-current order in cuprates as well as to a class of quasi-two dimensional heavy-fermion and other metallic antiferromagnets, and proposed recently also for the possible loop-current order in Moiré twisted bi-layer graphene and bi-layer WSe$_2$. All these metals have a linear in temperature electrical resistivity in the quantum-critical region of their phase diagrams, often termed ``Planckian" resistivity. The solution of the Kubo equation for transport shows that vertex renormalizations to the external fields, beside those due to Aslamazov-Larkin (A-L) processes, are absent. A-L appears as an Umklapp scattering matrix, which gives a temperature independent multiplicative factor for the electrical resistivity but does not affect the thermal conductivity. We also show that the mass renormalization which gives a logarithmic enhancement of the marginal Fermi-liquid specific heat does not appear in the electrical resistivity and, more remarkably, in the thermal conductivity. On the other hand the mass renormalization $\propto \ln \omega_c/T$ appears in the Seebeck coefficient. We also discuss in detail the conservation laws which play a crucial role in all transport properties. We calculate exactly, the numerical coefficients of the transport properties for a circular Fermi-surface. The leading temperature dependences is shown to remain the same for a general Fermi-surface, but it is too messy to calculate the numerical coefficient.

Title: Critical fates induced by the interaction competition in three-dimensional tilted Dirac semimetals
Authors: Jing Wang, Jie-Qiong Li, Wen-Hao Bian, Qiao-Chu Zhang, Xiao-Yue Ren
Abstract: The interplay among Coulomb interaction, electron-phonon coupling, and phonon-phonon coupling has a significant impact on the low-energy behavior of three-dimensional type-I tilted Dirac semimetals. To investigate this phenomenon, we construct an effective theory, calculate one-loop corrections arising from all these interactions, and establish the coupled energy-dependent flows of all associated interaction parameters by adopting the renormalization-group approach. Deciphering such coupled evolutions allows us to determine a series of low-energy critical properties for these materials. At first, we present the low-energy tendencies of all interaction parameters. The tilting parameter exhibits distinct tendencies that depend heavily upon the initial anisotropy of fermion velocities. In comparison, the latter is mainly dominated by its initial value but is less sensitive to the former. Variations in these two quantities drive certain interaction parameters toward the strong anisotropy in the low-energy regime, indicating the screened interaction in specific directions, and others toward an approximate isotropy. Additionally, we observe that the tendencies of interaction parameters can be qualitatively clustered into three distinct types of fixed points, accompanied by the potential instabilities that induce an interaction-driven phase transition to a certain superconducting state. Furthermore, approaching these fixed points leads to the critical behavior of physical quantities, such as the density of states, compressibility, and specific heat, which exhibit quite different from their noninteracting counterparts and even deviate slightly from Fermi-liquid behavior. Our investigation sheds light on the intricate relationship between different types of interactions in these semimetals and provides useful insights into their fundamental properties.

Abstract: This study focuses on amorphous boron nitride ($\rm \alpha$-BN) as a novel diffusion barrier for advanced semiconductor technology, particularly addressing the critical challenge of copper diffusion in back-end-of-line (BEOL) interconnects. Owing to its ultralow dielectric constant and robust barrier properties, $\rm \alpha$-BN is examined as an alternative to conventional low-k dielectrics. The investigation primarily employs theoretical modelling, using a Gaussian Approximation Potential, to simulate and understand the atomic-level interactions. This machine learning-based approach allows the performance of realistic simulations of amorphous structure of $\rm \alpha$-BN, enabling the exploration of the impact of different film morphologies on barrier efficacy. Furthermore, we studied the electronic and optical properties of the films using a simple Tight-Binding model. In addition to the theoretical studies, we performed diffusion studies of copper through PECVD $\rm \alpha$-BN on Si. The results from both the theoretical and experimental investigations highlight the potential of $\rm \alpha$-BN as a highly effective diffusion barrier, suitable for integration in nanoelectronics. This research shows that $\rm \alpha$-BN is a promising candidate for BEOL interconnects but also demonstrates the synergy of advanced computational models and experimental methods in material innovation for semiconductor applications.

Title: Active pattern formation emergent from single-species nonreciprocity
Authors: Zhi-Feng Huang, Michael te Vrugt, Jonas Mayer Martins, Raphael Wittkowski, Hartmut Löwen
Abstract: Nonreciprocal interactions violating Newton's third law are common in a plethora of nonequilibrium situations ranging from predator-prey systems to the swarming of birds and effective colloidal interactions under flow. While many recent studies have focused on two species with nonreciprocal coupling, less is examined for the basic single-component system breaking the actio and reactio equality of force within the same species. Here, we systematically derive a field theory for the case of single-species nonreciprocal interactions from the microscopic particle dynamics, leading to a generic continuum model termed Active Model N (N denoting nonreciprocity). We explore the rich dynamics of pattern formation in this nonreciprocal system and the emergence of self-traveling states with persistent variation and flowing of active branched patterns. One particular new characteristic pattern is an interwoven self-knitting "yarn" structure with a unique feature of simultaneous development of micro- and bulk phase separations. The growth dynamics of a "ball-of-wool" active droplet towards these self-knitted yarn or branched states exhibits a crossover between different scaling behaviors. The mechanism underlying this distinct class of active phase separation is attributed to the interplay between nonreciprocity and competition of interparticle forces. Our predictions can be applied to various biological and artificial active matter systems controlled by single-species nonreciprocity.

Title: Fingerprints of Mott and Slater gaps in the core-level photoemission spectra of antiferromagnetic iridates
Authors: K. Nakagawa, A. Hariki, T. Okauchi, H. Fujiwara, K.-H. Ahn, Y. Murakami, S. Hamamoto, Y. Kanai-Nakata, T. Kadono, A. Higashiya, K. Tamasaku, M. Yabashi, T. Ishikawa, A. Sekiyama, S. Imada, J. Kuneš, K. Takase, A. Yamasaki
Abstract: We present Ir $4f$ core-level hard-x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (HAXPES) experiments conducted across antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering transition in Ruddlesden-Popper iridates Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ and Sr$_3$Ir$_2$O$_7$. The Ir $4f$ spectra exhibit distinct changes between the AFM and paramagnetic (PM) phases, with the spectral difference $I_\text{PM}-I_\text{AFM}$ showing a contrasting behavior in the two compounds. By employing computational simulations using the local-density approximation combined with the dynamical mean-field theory method, we elucidate that $I_\text{PM}-I_\text{AFM}$ primary reflects the Slater or Mott-Hubbard character of the AFM insulating state rather than material specific details. This sensitivity to fine low-energy electronic structure arises from the dependence of charge-transfer responses to the sudden creation of a localized core hole on both metal-insulator transitions and long-range AFM ordering. Our result broadens the applications of core-level HAXPES as a tool for characterization of electronic structure.

Abstract: WTe$_2$ stands out as a semimetal presenting Fermi level quantum oscillations in most measured quantities under magnetic fields. However, the electronic band structure above and below the Fermi level has not been explored completely. Here we study the electronic band structure of WTe$_2$ by quasiparticle interference with Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) and observe, with the support of Density Functional Theory (DFT), the electron and hole bands around the Fermi level. We also report on the observation of Landau quantization in atomically resolved measurements and discuss the possible connection with band structure calculations.

Title: Entropy augmentation through subadditive excess: information theory in irreversible processes
Authors: Jürgen T. Stockburger
Abstract: Within its range of applicability, the Boltzmann equation seems unique in its capacity to accurately describe the transition from almost any initial state to a self-equilibrated thermal state. Using information-theoretic methods to rephrase the key idea of Maxwell and Boltzmann, the Stoßzahlansatz, a far more general, abstract ansatz is developed. An increase of the Gibbs-Shannon-von Neumann entropy results without the usual coarse-graining. The mathematical structure of the ansatz also provides avenues for efficient computation and simulation.

Title: Spin parallel transport and holonomy in non-Euclidean curved circuits on a spherical two-dimensional electron gas
Authors: E.J. Rodríguez, A.A. Reynoso, J.P. Baltanás, D. Bercioux, D. Frustaglia
Abstract: The quantum conductance of one-dimensional (1D) circuits built on flat (Euclidean) two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) is known to display a symmetric response to the inversion of Rashba spin-orbit coupling fields in Aharonov-Casher (AC) interference patterns. Here, we show that this symmetry breaks down in curved (non-Euclidean) 1D circuits defined on spherical 2DEGs. We demonstrate that this is a consequence of parallel spin transport and holonomy on the surface of the sphere, and that a symmetric response can be recovered when considering the parallel transport condition as an offset shifting the AC pattern. We discuss 1D triangular circuits defined along geodesic arcs on the sphere as a case study, and generalize it to regular polygons and parallel curves of given latitude.

Title: On-Demand Growth of Semiconductor Heterostructures Guided by Physics-Informed Machine Learning

Abstract: Developing tailored semiconductor heterostructures on demand represents a critical capability for addressing the escalating performance demands in electronic and optoelectronic devices. However, traditional fabrication methods remain constrained by simulation-based design and iterative trial-and-error optimization. Here, we introduce SemiEpi, a self-driving platform designed for molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) to perform multi-step semiconductor heterostructure growth through in-situ monitoring and on-the-fly feedback control. By integrating standard MBE reactors, physics-informed machine learning (ML) models, and parameter initialization, SemiEpi identifies optimal initial conditions and proposes experiments for heterostructure growth, eliminating the need for extensive expertise in MBE processes. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the optimization of high-density InAs quantum dot (QD) growth with a target emission wavelength of 1240 nm, showcasing the power of SemiEpi. We achieve a QD density of 5 x 10^10 cm^-2, a 1.6-fold increase in photoluminescence (PL) intensity, and a reduced full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 29.13 meV, leveraging in-situ reflective high-energy electron diffraction monitoring with feedback control for adjusting growth temperatures. Taken together, our results highlight the potential of ML-guided systems to address challenges in multi-step heterostructure growth, facilitate the development of a hardware-independent framework, and enhance process repeatability and stability, even without exhaustive knowledge of growth parameters.

Title: Attractive and repulsive terms in multi-filament dispersion interactions
Authors: Subhojit Pal, John F. Dobson, Mathias Boström
Abstract: Filamentary objects such as nano-wires, nanotubes and DNA are of current interest in physics, nanoscience, chemistry, biology and medicine. They can interact via strong, exceptionally long-ranged many-object van der Waals (vdW, dispersion) forces, causing them to cluster into multi-object bundles. We analyse their vdW interactions perturbatively, predicting $N$-object vdW energy contributions that alternate in sign with increasing $N$. Our findings are confirmed here via the first detailed analysis of a 4-cylinder vdW model. We also provide novel insights permitting these tendencies to be understood simply in terms of electronic screening and anti-screening. Our results suggest that a non-perturbative calculation will be required for reliable prediction of dispersion interactions in these ubiquitous systems.

Title: Local Limit Disorder Characteristics of Superconducting Radio Frequency Cavities
Authors: Anastasiya Lebedeva, Matúš Hladký, Marcel Polák, František Herman
Abstract: Nowadays Nb-based superconducting radio-frequency cavities represent fundamental tools used for (Standard Model) particle acceleration, (beyond Standard Model) particle probing, and long-lifetime photon preservation. We study the SRF frequency shift in the vicinity of the critical temperature $T_c$ and the quality factor mainly at low temperatures within the Dynes superconductor model. We scrutinize and use the local limit response to the external electromagnetic field. Our approach allows for a finer analysis of the peculiar behavior of the resonant frequency shift immensely close to $T_c$, observed in recent experiments. In several regimes, we analytically elaborate on the width and depth of the resulting dip. Studying the sign of the slope of the resonant frequency shift at $T_c$ in the moderately clean regime clarifies the role of the pair-breaking and pair-conserving disorder. Next, to find the relevance of our description, we compare and also fit our results with the recent experimental data from the N-doped Nb sample presented by Zarea {\it et al.} [Front. Supercond. Mater. 3, 1 (2023), arXiv:2307.07905]. Our analysis complies with the experimental findings, especially concerning the dip width. We offer a straightforward, homogeneous-disorder-based interpretation within the moderately clean regime. Comparative analysis for three other cavities with different resonant frequencies reported by Ueki {\it et al.} [Prog. Theor. Exp. Phys. 5, 053I02 (2025), arXiv:2207.14236] points toward a similar regime. Assuming the same regime at low temperatures, we address details of the high-quality plateaus. Summing all up, this work presents (and studies the limits of) the simple, effective description of the complex problem corresponding to the electromagnetic response in the superconductors, combining homogeneous conventional pairing and two different kinds of disorder scattering.

Title: The single edge notch fracture test for viscoelastic elastomers
Authors: Farhad Kamarei, Fabio Sozio, Oscar Lopez-Pamies
Abstract: Making use of the Griffith criticality condition recently introduced by Shrimali and Lopez-Pamies (Extreme Mechanics Letters 58: 101944, 2023), this work presents a comprehensive analysis of the single edge notch fracture test for viscoelastic elastomers. The results -- comprised of a combination of a parametric study and direct comparisons with experiments -- reveal how the non-Gaussian elasticity, the nonlinear viscosity, and the intrinsic fracture energy of elastomers interact and govern when fracture nucleates from the pre-existing crack in these tests. The results also serve to quantify the limitations of existing analyses, wherein viscous effects and the actual geometries of the pre-existing cracks and the specimens are neglected.

Title: Elasto-frictional reduced model of a cyclically sheared container filled with particles
Authors: A. Faulconnier, S. Job, J. Brocail, N. Peyret, J.-L. Dion
Abstract: This article explores the hysteretic behavior and the damping features of sheared granular media using discrete element method (DEM) simulations. We consider polydisperse non-cohesive frictional spherical particles, enclosed in a container with rigid but moving walls, submitted to a cyclic simple shear superimposed to a confining pressure. The mechanical response of the grains is analyzed in the permanent regime, by fitting the macroscopic stress-strain relation applied to the box with a Dahl-like elasto-frictional model. The influence of several parameters such as the amplitude of the strain, the confining pressure, the elasticity, the friction coefficient, the size and the number of particles are explored. We find that the fitted parameters of our macroscopic Ansatz qualitatively rely on both a well-established effective medium theory of confined granular media and a well-documented rheology of granular flow. Quantitatively, we demonstrate that the single degree-of-freedom elasto-frictional reduced model reliably describes the nonlinear response of the granular layer over a wide range of operating conditions. In particular, we show that the mechanical response of a granular slab under simple shear depends on an unique dimensionless parameter, akin to an effective Coulomb threshold, at low shear/high pressure. Further, exploring higher shear/lower pressure, we evidence an optimal damping at the crossover between a loose unjammed regime and a dense elastic regime.

Title: Dynamic self-loops in networks of passive and active binary elements
Authors: Paul Baconnier, Margot H. Teunisse, Martin van Hecke
Abstract: Models of coupled binary elements capture memory effects in complex dissipative materials, such as transient responses or sequential computing, when their interactions are chosen appropriately. However, for random interactions, self-loops - cyclic transition sequences incompatible with dissipative dynamics - dominate the response and undermine statistical approaches. Here we reveal that self-loops originate from energy injection and limit cycles in the underlying physical system. We furthermore introduce interaction ensembles that strongly suppress or completely eliminate self-loops, allowing statistical studies of memory in large dissipative systems. Our work opens a route towards a unified description of passive and active multistable materials using hysteron models.

Title: Collective modes of two-species Bose-Einstein condensates in a Josephson junction barrier
Authors: Harsimranjit Kaur, Kuldeep Suthar
Abstract: The ultracold atoms are an ideal platform to implement atomtronics and Josephson junctions analogous to superconducting circuits. The collective modes of a Bose gas split by a potential barrier have been known. However, the role of barriers on the collective excitation spectra of ultracold atomic mixtures has not been examined. Here, we examine the low-lying collective modes of (an)harmonically trapped quasi-one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates in a Josephson barrier by employing the variational approach and Bogoliubov theory. We first show that the anharmonicity of the external potential leads to an increase in the critical barrier strength of mode softening in a single-species condensate. The Josephson barrier drives the softening of in-phase and out-of-phase dipole modes of two-species Bose-Einstein condensates, and consequently leads to two additional zero-energy Goldstone modes in the miscible phase, in agreement with the variational approach. Furthermore, the sandwich immiscible state results in an additional Goldstone mode due to the barrier, in contrast to the spatially symmetry-broken side-by-side profile. Our results unveil the distinct collective response of the Josephson barrier in binary mixtures owing to interspecies atomic correlations.

Title: Chiral supersolid and dissipative time crystal in Rydberg-dressed Bose-Einstein condensates with Raman-induced spin-orbit coupling
Authors: Xianghua Su, Xiping Fu, Yang He, Ying Shang, Kaiyuan Ji, Linghua Wen
Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is one of the crucial factors that affect the chiral symmetry of matter by causing the spatial symmetry breaking of the system. We find that Raman-induced SOC can induce a chiral supersolid phase with a helical antiskyrmion lattice in balanced Rydberg-dressed two-component Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in a harmonic trap by modulating the Raman coupling strength. This is in stark contrast to the mirror symmetric supersolid phase containing skyrmion-antiskyrmion lattice pair for the case of Rashba SOC. Two ground-state phase diagrams are presented as a function of the Rydberg interaction and the Raman-induced SOC. It is shown that the interplay among Raman-induced SOC, Rydberg interactions, and nonlinear contact interactions favors rich ground-state structures, including half-quantum vortex phase, stripe supersolid phase, toroidal stripe phase with a central Anderson-Toulouse coreless vortex, checkerboard supersolid phase, mirror symmetric supersolid phase, chiral supersolid phase and standing-wave supersolid phase. In addition, the effects of rotation and in-plane quadrupole magnetic field on the ground state of the system are analyzed. In these two cases, the chiral supersolid phase is broken and the ground state tends to form a miscible phase. Furthermore, we demonstrate that when the initial state is a chiral supersolid phase the rotating harmonic trapped system sustains dissipative continuous time crystal by studying the rotational dynamic behaviors of the system.

Title: Beyond holography: the entropic quantum gravity foundations of image processing
Authors: Ginestra Bianconi
Abstract: Recently, thanks to the development of artificial intelligence (AI) there is increasing scientific attention in establishing the connections between theoretical physics and AI. Traditionally, these connections have been focusing mostly on the relation between string theory and image processing and involve important theoretical paradigms such as holography. Recently G. Bianconi has formulated the Gravity from Entropy (GfE) approach to quantum gravity in which gravity is derived from the geometric quantum relative entropy (GQRE) between two metrics associated with the Lorentzian spacetime. Here it is demonstrated that the famous Perona-Malik algorithm for image processing is the gradient flow that maximizes the GfE action in its simple warm-up scenario. Specifically, this algorithm is the outcome of the maximization of the GfE action calculated between two Euclidean metrics: the one of the support of the image and the one induced by the image. As the Perona-Malik algorithm is known to preserve sharp contours, this implies that the GfE action, does not in general lead to uniform images upon iteration of the gradient flow dynamics as it would be intuitively expected from entropic actions maximising classical entropies. Rather, the outcome of the maximization of the GfE action is compatible with the preservation of complex structures. These results provide the geometrical and information theory foundations for the Perona-Malik algorithm and might contribute to establish deeper connections between GfE, machine learning and brain research.

Title: Quasi-Brittle Fracture: The Blended Approach
Authors: Semsi Coskun, Davood Damircheli, Robert Lipton
Abstract: A field theory is presented for predicting damage and fracture in quasi-brittle materials. The approach taken here is new and blends a non-local constitutive law with a two-point phase field. In this formulation, the material displacement field is uniquely determined by the initial boundary value problem. The theory naturally satisfies energy balance, with positive energy dissipation rate in accord with thermodynamics. Notably, these properties are not imposed but follow directly from the constitutive law and evolution equation when multiplying the equation of motion by the velocity and integrating by parts. In addition to elastic constants, the model requires at most three key material parameters: the strain at the onset of nonlinearity, the ultimate tensile strength, and the fracture toughness. The approach simplifies parameter identification while ensuring representation of material behavior. The approach seamlessly handles fracture evolution across loading regimes, from quasi-static to dynamic, accommodating both fast crack propagation and quasi-brittle failure under monotonic and cyclic loading. Numerical simulations show quantitative and qualitative agreement with experiments, including three-point bending tests on concrete. The model successfully captures the cyclic load-deflection response of crack mouth opening displacement, the structural size-effect related to ultimate load and specimen size, fracture originating from corner singularities in L- shaped domains, and bifurcating fast cracks.

Title: Bose-Einstein Condensation and the Lambda Transition for Interacting Lennard-Jones Helium-4
Authors: Phil Attard
Abstract: An introduction to Bose-Einstein condensation and the $\lambda$-transition is given. Results of quantum loop Monte Carlo simulations are presented for interacting Lennard-Jones helium-4. The optimum condensation fraction is found by minimizing the constrained free energy. The results show that approaching the transition the growth of pure position permutation loops and the consequent divergence of the heat capacity are enabled by the suppression of condensation and consequently of superfluidity. Condensation and superfluidity emerge at the peak of the heat capacity due to mixed position permutation chains.

Title: Diffusion of intruders in a granular gas thermostatted by a bath of elastic hard spheres
Authors: Rubén Gómez González, Vicente Garzó
Abstract: The Boltzmann kinetic equation is considered to compute the transport coefficients associated with the mass flux of intruders in a granular gas. Intruders and granular gas are immersed in a gas of elastic hard spheres (molecular gas). We assume that the granular particles are sufficiently rarefied so that the state of the molecular gas is not affected by the presence of the granular gas. Thus, the gas of elastic hard spheres can be considered as a thermostat (or bath) at a fixed temperature $T_g$. In the absence of spatial gradients, the system achieves a steady state where the temperature of the granular gas $T$ differs from that of the intruders $T_0$ (energy nonequipartition). Approximate theoretical predictions for the temperature ratio $T_0/T_g$ and the kurtosis $c_0$ associated with the intruders compare very well with Monte Carlo simulations for conditions of practical interest. For states close to the steady homogeneous state, the Boltzmann equation for the intruders is solved by means of the Chapman--Enskog method to first order in the spatial gradients. As expected, the diffusion transport coefficients are given in terms of the solutions of a set of coupled linear integral equations which are approximately solved by considering the first-Sonine approximation. In dimensionless form, the transport coefficients are nonlinear functions of the mass and diameter ratios, the coefficients of restitution, and the (reduced) bath temperature. Interestingly, previous results derived from a suspension model based on an effective fluid-solid interaction force are recovered when $m/m_g\to \infty$ and $m_0/m_g\to \infty$, where $m$, $m_0$, and $m_g$ are the masses of the granular, intruders, and molecular gas particle, respectively. Finally, as an application of our results, thermal diffusion segregation is exhaustively analysed.

Title: Non-equilibrium transport and phonon branch-resolved size effects based on a multi-temperature kinetic model
Authors: Chuang Zhang, Houssem Rezgui, Meng Lian, Hong Liang
Abstract: Non-equilibrium transport and phonon branch-resolved size effects in single-layer graphene materials are studied under a multi-temperature kinetic model, which is developed for capturing the branch-dependent electron-phonon coupling. Compared with typical macroscopic multi-temperature models, the assumption of diffusive phonon transport is abandoned in this model and replaced by the free migration and scattering of particles. The phonon branch- and size-dependent effective thermal conductivity is predicted in nanosized graphene as well as the temperature slips near the boundaries. Compared with other phonon branches, the ZA branch contributes the most to thermal conduction regardless of system sizes. Furthermore, in nanosized homogeneous graphene with a hotspot at the center, the branch-dependent thermal conductivity increases from the inside to the outside even if the system size is fixed. The thermal conductivity of ZA branch is even higher than the lattice thermal conductivity when the system size is hundreds of nanometers.

Title: Engineering second order topological superconductor hosting tunable Majorana corner modes in magnet/$d$-wave superconductor hybrid platform
Authors: Minakshi Subhadarshini, Archana Mishra, Arijit Saha
Abstract: We theoretically study the noncollinear magnetic texture effect on second-order topological superconductor (SOTSC) phase generated in unconventional $d$-wave superconductors and two-dimensional (2D) quantum spin Hall insulators (QSHI). While the interplay of the $d$-wave superconductor and QSHI has been studied as a platform to realize Majorana corner modes (MCMs), we show that the addition of the spin texture enables the tunability of these MCMs. Each corner of this hybrid system can host one or two Majorana modes depending on the system parameters, in particular, exchange strength and pitch vector of the spin texture. To characterize the higher order bulk topology, we compute the quadrupolar winding number, which directly corresponds to the number of MCMs acquiring a value of one for four corner modes and two for eight corner modes. We investigate and show the close resemblance in the topological phase diagrams obtained from the low energy effective Hamiltonian that reveals an emergent in-plane Zeeman field and spin-orbit coupling induced by the spin texture, and the real space tight binding lattice model. The microscopic pairing mechanism responsible for the appearance of SOTSC phase is investigated via an effective bulk pairing analysis, while a low-energy edge theory captures the mechanism behind tunability of MCMs. Our result paves the way for realizing SOTC with multiple MCMs which can be tuned via system parameters.

Title: General First-Principles Approach to Crystals in Finite Magnetic Fields
Authors: Chengye Lü, Yingwei Chen, Yuzhi Wang, Zhihao Dai, Zhong Fang, Xin-Gao Gong, Quansheng Wu, Hongjun Xiang
Abstract: We introduce a general first-principles methodology for computing electronic structure in a finite uniform magnetic field which allows for an arbitrary rational magnetic flux and nonlocal pseudopotentials, at a comparable time complexity of conventional plane-wave pseudopotential approaches in zero-field conditions. The versatility of this method is demonstrated through comprehensive applications to both molecular and crystalline systems, including calculations of magnetizabilities, magnetically induced currents, and magnetic energy bands. Furthermore, we provide rigorous proofs of two properties for crystals in uniform magnetic fields: the "strong translational symmetry" and "magnetic bands shift" phenomena.

Title: Interaction effects on electronic Floquet spectra: Excitonic effects
Authors: Teng Xiao, Tsan Huang, Changhua Bao, Zhiyuan Sun
Abstract: Floquet engineering of electronic states by light is a central topic in modern experiments. However, the impact of many-body interactions on the single-electron properties remains unclear in this non-equilibrium situation. We propose that interaction effects could be reasonably understood by performing perturbative expansion in both the pump field and the electron-electron interaction when computing physical quantities. As an example, we apply this approach to semiconductors and show analytically that excitonic effects, i.e., effects of electron-hole interaction, lead to dramatic corrections to the single-electron Floquet spectra even when the excitons are only virtually excited by the pump light. We compute these effects in phosphorene and monolayer MoS$_2$ for time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and ultrafast optical experiments.

Title: Solution of the Critical Dynamics of the Mean-Field Kob-Andersen Model
Authors: Gianmarco Perrupato, Tommaso Rizzo
Abstract: We analytically solve the critical dynamics of the Kob-Andersen kinetically constrained model of supercooled liquids on the Bethe lattice, employing a combinatorial argument based on the cavity method. For arbitrary values of graph connectivity z and facilitation parameter m, we demonstrate that the critical behavior of the order parameter is governed by equations of motion equivalent to those found in Mode-Coupling Theory. The resulting predictions for the dynamical exponents are validated through direct comparisons with numerical simulations that include both continuous and discontinuous transition scenarios.

Title: Anatomy of spin-orbit-torque-assisted magnetization dynamics in Co/Pt bilayers: Importance of the orbital torque
Authors: Harshita Devda, András Deák, Leandro Salemi, Levente Rózsa, László Szunyogh, Peter M. Oppeneer, Ulrich Nowak
Abstract: Understanding the mechanism driving magnetization switching in spin-orbit-torque-assisted devices remains a subject of debate. While originally attributed to the spin Hall effect and spin Rashba-Edelstein effect, recent discoveries related to orbital moments induced by the orbital Hall effect and the orbital Rashba-Edelstein effect have added complexity to the comprehension of the switching process in non-magnet/ferromagnet bilayers. Addressing this challenge, we present a quantitative investigation of a Pt/Co bilayer by employing atomistic spin dynamics simulations, incorporating the proximity-induced moments of Pt, as well as electrically induced spin and orbital moments obtained from first-principles calculations. Our layer-resolved model elucidates the damping-like and field-like nature of the induced moments by separating them according to their even and odd magnetization dependence. In addition to demonstrating that a larger field-like spin-orbit torque contribution comes from previously disregarded induced orbital moments, our work highlights the necessity of considering interactions with Pt induced moments at the interface, as they contribute significantly to the switching dynamics.

Title: Emergent curved space and gravitational lensing in quantum materials
Authors: Yugo Onishi, Nisarga Paul, Liang Fu
Abstract: We show that an effective gravitational field naturally emerges in quantum materials with long-wavelength spin (or pseudospin) textures. When the itinerant electrons' spin strongly couples to the background spin texture, it effectively behaves as a spinless particle in a curved space, with the curvature arising from quantum corrections to the electron's spin orientation. The emergent curved space gives rise to the electron lensing effect, an analog of the gravitational lensing. The lensing effect can appear in systems without (emergent) magnetic fields, such as those with coplanar spin textures. Our work shows that novel ``gravitational'' phenomena generically appear in quantum systems due to nonadiabaticity, opening new research directions in quantum physics.

Title: Tuning Steady Shear Rheology through Active Dopants
Authors: Amir Shee, Ritwik Bandyopadhyay, Haicen Yue
Abstract: We numerically investigate the steady shear rheology of mixtures of active and passive Brownian particles, with varying fractions of active components. We find that even a small fraction of active dopants triggers fluidization with comparable efficiency to fully active systems. A combined parameter, active energy, given by dopant fraction multiplied by propulsion speed squared controls the steady shear rheology and glass transition of the active-passive mixtures. These results together provide a quantitative strategy for fine-tuning the mechanical properties of a soft material with small amounts of active dopants.

Title: Beyond characteristic equations: A unified one-dimensional non-Bloch band theory via wavefunction data
Authors: Haoshu Li
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems play a central role in nonequilibrium physics, where determining the energy spectrum under open boundary conditions is a fundamental problem. Non-Bloch band theory, based on the characteristic equation $\text{det}[E - H(\beta)] = 0$, has emerged as a key tool for this task. However, we show that this framework becomes insufficient in systems with certain symmetries, where identical characteristic equations can yield different spectra. To resolve this, we develop a unified theory that incorporates additional wavefunction information beyond the characteristic equation. Our framework accurately captures spectral properties such as the energy spectrum and the end-to-end signal response in a broad class of systems, particularly those with high symmetry. It reveals the essential role of wavefunction information and symmetry in shaping non-Hermitian band theory.

Title: Giant orbital magnetization in two-dimensional materials
Authors: Martin Ovesen, Thomas Olsen
Abstract: Orbital magnetization typically plays a minor role in compounds where the magnetic properties are governed by transition metal elements. However, in some cases, the orbital magnetization may be fully unquenched, which can have dramatic consequences for magnetic anisotropy and various magnetic response properties. In the present work, we start by summarizing how unquenched orbital moments arise from particular combinations of crystal field splitting and orbital filling. We exemplify this for the cases of two-dimensional (2D) VI$_3$ and FePS$_3$, and show that Hubbard corrections as well as self-consistent spin-orbit coupling are crucial ingredients for predicting correct orbital moments from first principles calculations. We then search the Computational 2D Materials Database (C2DB) for monolayers having tetrahedral or octahedral crystal field splitting of transition metal $d$-states and orbital occupancy that is expected to lead to large orbital moments. We identify 112 monolayers with octahedral crystal field splitting and 62 monolayers with tetrahedral crystal field splitting and for materials with partially filled $t_{2g}$ bands, we verify that inclusion of Hubbard corrections as well as self-consistent spin-orbit coupling typically increases the magnitude of predicted orbital moments by an order of magnitude.

Title: Surface states and finite size effects in triple-fold semimetals
Authors: A.Yu. Prykhodko, E.V. Gorbar, P.O. Sukhachov
Abstract: Triple-fold or pseudospin-1 semimetals belong to a class of multi-fold materials in which linearly dispersive bands and flat bands intersect at the same point, forming triple-fold crossing points. We conduct an analytical investigation of topologically protected Fermi arc surface states and finite-size effects in three-dimensional (3D) triple-fold and doubly degenerate triple-fold semimetals in continuum low-energy models. Higher topological charge of the triple-fold crossing points leads to two Fermi arcs connecting the nodes. For a single triple-fold crossing point, we found that no term in the Hamiltonian with momentum-independent elements can open a gap, prompting us to consider doubly-degenerate triple-fold fermions, where the gap can be opened by mixing the degenerate copies. Thin films of triple-fold semimetals allow for mixing between the surface and bulk states in addition to the discretization of energy levels of the latter.

Title: Dynamic Avalanches: Rate-Controlled Switching and Race Conditions
Authors: Lishuai Jin, Martin van Hecke
Abstract: Avalanches are rapid cascades of rearrangements driven by cooperative flipping of hysteretic local elements. Here we show that flipping dynamics and race conditions -- where multiple elements become unstable simultaneously -- give rise to dynamic avalanches that cannot be captured by static models of interacting elements. We realize dynamic avalanches in metamaterials with controlled flipping times, and demonstrate how this allows to modify, promote, and direct avalanche behavior. Our work elucidates the crucial role of internal dynamics in complex materials and introduces dynamic design principles for materializing targeted pathways and sequential functionalities.

Title: Tailoring the Electronic Properties of Monoclinic (InxAl1-x)2O3 Alloys via Substitutional Donors and Acceptors
Authors: Mohamed Abdelilah Fadla, Myrta Grüning, Lorenzo Stella
Abstract: Ultra-wide bandgap semiconductors such as \b{eta}-Ga2O3 are ideal materials for next-generation power electronic devices. Electronic and mechanical properties of \b{eta}-Ga2O3 can be tuned by alloying with other sesquioxides, notably Al2O3 and In2O3. Moreover, by tuning the In content of a (InxAl1-x)2O3 alloy, its lattice constants can be matched to those of Ga2O3, while preserving a large conduction-band offset. In view of potential applications to \b{eta}-Ga2O3-based heterostructure, we performed atomistic modelling of (InxAl1-x)2O3 alloys using density functional theory to investigate thermodynamic and electrical properties of conventional group IV dopants (Si, Sn, C, Ge), alternative metal donors (Ta, Zr, Hf), and acceptors (Mg, Zn, Cu). The hybrid Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof functional (HSE06) is used to accurately quantify the defect formation energies, ionization levels, and concentrations over a wide range of experimentally relevant conditions for the oxygen chemical potential and temperature. In our atomistic models, Hf and Zr show favourable properties as alternative donors to Si and other group IV impurities, especially under oxygen-poor conditions. Our findings also suggest that acceptors Mg, Zn, and Cu, while they cannot promote p-doping, can be still beneficial for the compensation of unintentionally n-doped materials, e.g., to generate semi-insulating layers and improve rectification.

Title: Enhancing thermoelectric efficiency of multilayer graphene by nanomeshing
Authors: Mehrdad Rahimi, Nunzia Lubertino, Roberto Bellelli, Linsai Chen, François Mallet, Philippe Lafarge, Clément Barraud, PAscal Marti, Julien Chaste, Danièle Fournier, Maria Luisa Della Rocca
Abstract: Nanostructuring materials at small scales enables control over their physical properties, revealing behaviors not observed at larger dimensions. This strategy is particularly effective in two-dimensional (2D) materials, where surface effects dominate, and has been applied in the thermoelectric field. Here, we use multilayer graphene (4-6 nm thick) as a test platform to study the effect of nanomeshing on its thermoelectric properties. The nanomesh consists of a hexagonal array of holes, with a measured diameter and neck-width of ~360 nm and ~160 nm, respectively. The multilayer graphene is integrated into field-effect transistor-like devices supported by hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), allowing simultaneous electric and thermoelectric measurements, with nanomeshing applied to only part of the material. We use modulated thermoreflectance to investigate thermal transport in equivalent nanomeshed and pristine graphene flakes, extracting key parameters that affect thermoelectric performance. The nanomesh geometry suppresses thermal transport without significantly impacting charge transport, highlighting the different scattering lengths of phonons and electrons while enhancing the thermopower response. We observe a twofold improvement in the device power factor, PF = S^2 sigma (with S the Seebeck coefficient and sigma the electrical conductivity), at room temperature, along with a nearly threefold reduction in thermal conductivity k. The results show that nanomeshing can significantly improve the thermoelectric performance of multilayer graphene, paving the way for novel energy conversion strategies using 2D materials.

Title: Zeeman-activated Berry curvature magnetotransport from the bulk of non-magnetic metals with inversion symmetry
Authors: Rhonald Burgos Atencia, Antonio Vecchione, Denys Makarov, Carmine Ortix
Abstract: The Berry curvature (BC), a quantity encoding the geometry of electronic wavefunctions, governs various electronic transport effects in quantum materials. In magnetic systems, the BC is reponsible for the intrinsic part of the anomalous Hall conductivity. Local concentrations of BC in non-centrosymmetric materials can lead instead to the quantum nonlinear Hall effect. Here, we argue that the bulk of non-magnetic metals with inversion symmetry, systems where the BC is forced to vanish at any momentum, can be endowed with substantial concentrations of BC even with an infinitesimally small Zeeman coupling. This Zeeman-activated BC, independent of the magnetic field strength and instead related to the degree of non-parabolicity of the electronic bands, couples to the electronic orbital motion to generate a negative longitudinal magnetoresistance that scales with the relaxation time as the Drude resistivity. We show that the Zeeman-actived BC and the related intrinsic negative magnetoresistivity are generic: they appear in all centrosymmetric point groups and can occur both in topological and conventional conductors.

Title: Enhanced dispersion of active microswimmers in confined flows
Authors: Marc Lagoin (LOMA), Juliette Lacherez (LOMA), Guirec de Tournemire (LOMA), Ahmad Badr (LOMA), Yacine Amarouchene (LOMA), Antoine Allard (LOMA, UB), Thomas Salez (LOMA)
Abstract: In the presence of a laminar shear flow, the diffusion of passive colloidal particles is enhanced in the direction parallel to the flow. This classical phenomenon is known as Taylor-Aris dispersion. Besides, microorganisms, such as active microswimmers, exhibit an effective diffusive behavior at long times. Combining the two ingredients above, a natural question then emerges on how the effective diffusion of active microswimmers is altered in shear flows -- a widespread situation in natural environments with practical implications, \textit{e.g.} regarding biofilm formation. In this Letter, we investigate the motility and dispersion of \textit{Chlamydomonas reinhardtii} microalgae, within a rectangular microfluidic channel subjected to a sinusoidal Poiseuille flow. Using high-resolution optical microscopy and a particle-tracking algorithm, we reconstruct individual trajectories in various flow conditions and statistically analyze them through moment theory and sliding windowed demodulation. We find that the velocity fluctuations and the dispersion coefficient increase as the flow amplitude is increased, with only weak dependencies on the flow periodicity. Importantly, our results demonstrate that the generalization of Taylor-Aris law to active particles is valid.

Title: Strain-induced exciton mobility in layered WS2 from first principles
Authors: Amir Kleiner, Sivan Refaely-Abramson
Abstract: Exciton mobility in two-dimensional semiconductors is a key ingredient in materials-based design of optoelectronic functionalities. Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) set a good test case, with tightly bound excitons and designable flexibility that offer an ideal platform for realizing strain effects on exciton energy transfer. Here, we present an ab initio study to construct strain-induced exciton energy profiles and model exciton dynamics on top of these potential surfaces. We focus on inhomogeneously-strained monolayer WS$_2$, combining excitonic band structures derived from many-body perturbation theory for a large variety of strain profiles and calculate the change in mobility characteristics using a semiclassical ballistic transport model. We connect a wealth of strain patterns to exciton drift, diffusion, and confinement. Our results point to strain-induced regimes of super-ballistic propagation and an anomalous effective diffusion, governed entirely by the strain landscape. Our results provide structure-specific understanding of ballistic strain-tunable exciton behavior, offering design principles for engineering exciton dynamics in two-dimensional materials.

Title: Local Potential Functional Embedding Theory of Molecular Systems: Localized Orbital-Based Embedding from an Exact Density-Functional Perspective
Authors: W. Makhlouf, B. Senjean, E. Fromager
Abstract: Localized orbital-based quantum embedding, as originally formulated in the context of density matrix embedding theory (DMET), is revisited from the perspective of lattice density functional theory (DFT). An in-principle exact (in the sense of full configuration interaction) formulation of the theory, where the occupations of the localized orbitals play the role of the density, is derived for any (model or ab initio) electronic Hamiltonian. From this general formalism we deduce an exact relation between the local Hartree-exchange-correlation (Hxc) potential of the full-size Kohn-Sham (KS) lattice-like system and the embedding chemical potential that is adjusted on each embedded fragment, individually, such that both KS and embedding cluster systems reproduce the exact same local density. When well-identified density-functional approximations (that find their justification in the strongly correlated regime) are applied, a practical self-consistent local potential functional embedding theory (LPFET), where the local Hxc potential becomes the basic variable, naturally emerges from the theory. LPFET differs from previous density embedding approaches by its fragment-dependent embedding chemical potential expression, which is a simple functional of the Hxc potential. Numerical calculations on prototypical systems show the ability of such an ansatz to improve substantially the description of density profiles (localized orbitals occupation numbers in this context) in strongly correlated systems.

Title: Quantum Annealing in SK Model Employing Suzuki-Kubo-deGennes Quantum Ising Mean Field Dynamics
Authors: Soumyaditya Das, Soumyajyoti Biswas, Bikas K. Chakrabarti
Abstract: We study a quantum annealing approach for estimating the ground state energy of the Sherrington-Kirpatrick mean field spin glass model using the Suzuki-Kubo dynamics applied for individual local magnetization components. The solutions of the coupled differential equations, in discretized state, give a fast annealing algorithm (cost $N^3$) in estimating the ground state of the model: Classical ($E^0= -0.7629 \pm 0.0002$), Quantum ($E^0=-0.7623 \pm 0.0001$) and Mixed ($E^0=-0.7626 \pm 0.0001$), all of which are to be compared with the best known estimate $E^0= -0.763166726 \dots$ . We infer that the continuous nature of the magnetization variable used in the dynamics here is the reason for reaching close to the ground state quickly and also the reason for not observing the de-Almeida-Thouless line in this approach.

Title: Localization structure of electronic states in the quantum Hall effect
Authors: Alioune Seye, Marcel Filoche
Abstract: We investigate the localization of electronic states in the integer quantum Hall effect using a magnetic localization landscape (MLL) approach. By studying a continuum Schrödinger model with disordered electrostatic potential, we demonstrate that the MLL, defined via a modified landscape function incorporating magnetic effects, captures key features of quantum state localization. The MLL effective potential reveals the spatial confinement regions and provides predictions of eigenstate energies, particularly in regimes where traditional semiclassical approximations break down. Numerical simulations show that below a critical energy, states localize around minima of the effective potential, while above it, they cluster around maxima-with edge effects becoming significant near boundaries. Bridging the gap between semiclassical intuition and full quantum models, the MLL offers a robust framework to understand transport and localization in disordered quantum Hall systems, and extends the applicability of landscape theory to magnetic systems.

Title: Casimir Interaction between Polydisperse Colloids Trapped at a Fluid Interface
Authors: Seyed Emad Mousavi, Ehsan Noruzifar
Abstract: We investigate the effect of polydispersity on fluctuation-induced interactions between colloids trapped at a fluid interface. Using the scattering-matrix formalism, we calculate the interaction energy in two- and three-body systems under three mechanical boundary conditions. We find that size asymmetry can either suppress or enhance the many-body interaction compared to a monodisperse system, with the outcome depending on colloids mobility and separation. For fixed colloids, the interaction is suppressed at short separations but enhanced at large separations. In contrast, for mobile colloids, the interaction is predominantly enhanced at large distances but exhibits a competitive behavior in the near-field. This culminates in a large, multi-order-of-magnitude amplified sensitivity {to size asymmetry} for bobbing and tilting colloids at long range, highlighting a complex interplay between geometry and colloids mobility with significant implications for self-assembly.

Title: Universal relations between thermoelectrics and noise in mesoscopic transport across a tunnel junction
Authors: Andrei I. Pavlov, Mikhail N. Kiselev
Abstract: We develop a unified theory of weakly probed differential observables for currents and noise in transport experiments. Our findings uncover a set of universal transport relations between thermoelectric and noise properties of a system probed through a tunnel contact, with the Wiedemann-Franz law being just one example of such universality between charge and heat currents. We apply this theory to various quantum dot systems, including multichannel Kondo, quantum Hall and Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev quantum dots, and demonstrate that each of the microscopic theories is characterized by a set of universal relations connecting conductance and thermoelectrics with noise. Violations of these relations indicate additional energy scales emerging in a system.

Title: Noise signatures of a charged Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev dot in mesoscopic transport
Authors: Andrei I. Pavlov, Mikhail N. Kiselev
Abstract: We investigate quantum noise in a mesoscopic quantum dot serving as a realization of the charged Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model weakly coupled to a fermionic lead via a tunnel contact. We find noise signatures under voltage and temperature biases that can serve as clear markers of the SYK physics in experiments with related setups. We develop a linear response theory that treats all types of noise on the same footing and generalizes a concept of transport coefficients for charge and heat currents, as well as relations between them, to equilibrium noise power. Within this theory, we find characteristic scaling of the noise coefficients with temperature in all regimes that can be relevant for experimental realizations of the SYK dots, find a set of universal constants, with their values being unique to the SYK physics, that connect these coefficients, and characterize noise manifestations of the Coulomb blockade. Beyond SYK systems, these results may serve as a general framework for identification of non-Fermi-liquid signatures in mesoscopic transport and provide additional observables for experiments on thermoelectric phenomena.

Title: Topological invariant responsible for the stability of the Fermi surfaces in non-homogeneous systems
Authors: M.A.Zubkov
Abstract: The topological invariant responsible for the stability of Fermi point/Fermi surface in homogeneous systems is expressed through the one particle Green function, which depends on momentum. It is given by an integral over the 3D hypersurface in momentum space surrounding the Fermi surface. Notion of Fermi surface may be extended to the non - homogeneous systems using Wigner - Weyl calculus. The Fermi surface becomes coordinate dependent, it may be defined as the position of the singularity in momentum space of the Wigner transformed Green function. Then the topological invariant responsible for the stability of this Fermi surface is given by the same expression as for the homogeneous case, in which the Green function is replaced by its Wigner transformation while the ordinary products are replaced by the Moyal products. We illustrate the proposed construction by the examples of the systems, in which the given topological invariant is nontrivial and may be calculated explicitly.

Title: Confinement Reveals Hidden Splay-Bend Order in Twist-Bend Nematics
Authors: Szymon Drzazga, Piotr Kubala, Lech Longa
Abstract: Using extensive Monte Carlo (MC) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we investigate how spatial confinement affects molecular organization within thin films of the nematic twist-bend ($\mathrm{N_{TB}}$) phase. Our simulations show that confinement markedly amplifies the otherwise elusive splay-bend order, primarily by suppressing the intrinsic three-dimensional heliconical structure characteristic of bulk $\mathrm{N_{TB}}$. Remarkably, when the $\mathrm{N_{TB}}$ phase is confined between parallel walls imposing planar anchoring, and the bulk wave vector is oriented parallel to the walls, a smectic splay-bend ($\mathrm{S_{SB}}$) phase spontaneously emerges near the confining surfaces. This intermediate structure subsequently transforms into the bulk $\mathrm{N_{TB}}$ phase either directly via a smectic splay-bend-twist ($\mathrm{S_{SBT}}$) phase or through a sequence involving both the $\mathrm{S_{SBT}}$ and the nematic splay-bend-twist ($\mathrm{N_{SBT}}$) phases. Notably, the $\mathrm{N_{SBT}}$ phase becomes particularly pronounced as the molecular bend angle approaches its maximum attainable value in bulk $\mathrm{N_{TB}}$; this regime occurs in close proximity to the $\mathrm{N}\text{--}\mathrm{S_{A}}\text{--}\mathrm{S_{SB}}$ triple point on the bulk phase diagram. Our findings reveal a compelling and intricate interplay among chirality, confinement, and molecular ordering, further evidenced by the calculated elementary director distortions. Crucially, this study opens promising avenues for experimental exploration: confined thin-film geometries serve as powerful model systems for revealing and characterizing novel nematic and smectic liquid-crystal phases that remain elusive in, or currently inaccessible to, bulk experiments.

Abstract: Magnetic cooling, harnessing the temperature change in matter when exposed to a magnetic field, presents an energy-efficient and climate-friendly alternative to traditional vapor-compression refrigeration systems, with a significantly lower global warming potential. The advancement of this technology would be accelerated if irreversible losses arising from hysteresis in magnetocaloric materials were minimized. Despite extensive efforts to manipulate crystal lattice constants at the unit-cell level, mitigating hysteresis often compromises cooling performance. Herein, we address this persistent challenge by forming Sn(Ge)3/Sn(Ge)3 bonds within the unit cell of the Gd5Ge4 compound. Our approach enables an energetically favorable phase transition, leading to the elimination of thermal hysteresis. Consequently, we achieve a synergistic improvement of two key magnetocaloric figures of merit: a larger magnetic entropy change and a twofold increase in the reversible adiabatic temperature change (from 3.8 to 8 K) in the Gd5Sn2Ge2 compound. Such synergies can be extended over a wide temperature range. This study demonstrates a paradigm shift in mastering hysteresis toward simultaneously achieving exceptional magnetocaloric metrics and opens up promising avenues for gas liquefaction applications in the longstanding pursuit of sustainable energy solutions.

Title: Universal Boundary-Modes Localization from Quantum Metric Length
Authors: Xing-Lei Ma, Jin-Xin Hu, K. T. Law
Abstract: The presence of localized boundary modes is an unambiguous hallmark of topological quantum matter. While these modes are typically protected by topological invariants such as the Chern number, here we demonstrate that the {\it quantum metric length} (QML), a quantity inherent in multi-band topological systems, governs the spatial extent of flat-band topological boundary modes. We introduce a framework for constructing topological flat bands from degenerate manifolds with large quantum metric and find that the boundary modes exhibit dual phases of spatial behaviors: a conventional oscillatory decay arising from bare band dispersion, followed by another exponential decay controlled by quantum geometry. Crucially, the QML, derived from the quantum metric of the degenerate manifolds, sets a lower bound on the spatial spread of boundary states in the flat-band limit. Applying our framework to concrete models, we validate the universal role of the QML in shaping the long-range behavior of topological boundary modes. Furthermore, by tuning the QML, we unveil extraordinary non-local transport phenomena, including QML-shaped quantum Hall plateaus and anomalous Fraunhofer patterns. Our theoretical framework paves the way for engineering boundary-modes localization in topological flat-band systems.

Title: Nonreciprocal random networks and their percolation properties
Authors: Chanania Steinbock
Abstract: We study the effects of nonreciprocity and network structure on percolation. To this end, we investigate nonreciprocal random networks - directed networks for which the probability of a link occurring from node i to node j differs from the probability of the reverse link occurring from node j to node i. We analytically determine the degree and percolation properties of such networks with exactly two types of link probability, demonstrating that whether the networks are structured such that the nodes are not statistically indistinguishable has profound effects on these measures, both quantitively and in how such networks need to be approached. In particular, we develop a technique for solving the percolation problem which can be applied to both structured and unstructured networks. The method entails writing self-consistent integral and differential equations for the probability that each node will belong to the network's giant component. Exact solutions to these equations are obtained and simulations which confirm our analytic predictions are presented.

Title: Surface Topological Quantum Criticality II: Conformal manifolds, Isolated fixed points and Entanglement
Authors: Saran Vijayan, Fei Zhou
Abstract: In this article, we propose the realization of conformal manifolds, which are smooth manifolds of scale-conformal invariant interacting Hamiltonians in two-dimensional quantum many-body systems. Such phenomena can occur in various interacting systems, including topological surfaces or 2D bulks. Building on previous observations, we demonstrate that a conformal manifold can emerge as an exact solution when the number of fermion colors, \(N_c\), becomes infinite. We identify distinct exact marginal deformation operators uniquely associated with the conformal manifolds. By considering \(N_c\) as finite but large, we show that quantum fluctuations induce a fermion field renormalization that results in mildly infrared relevant or irrelevant renormalization-group (RG) flow within a conformal manifold, producing standard isolated infrared stable Wilson-Fisher fixed points. These can be grouped with ultraviolet stable fixed points into a discrete manifold due to the spontaneous symmetry breaking of an emergent \(SO(\mathcal{N})\) dynamical symmetry in the RG flow as \(N_c \rightarrow \infty\). Additionally, we find a correlation between the direction of the RG flow within the manifold and an increase in EPR-like entanglement entropy. The infrared-stable Wilson-Fisher fixed points, induced by quantum fluctuations, are linked to theories on the conformal manifold where interaction operators are maximally entangled in flavor space. Our studies provide an effective framework for addressing topological quantum critical points with high-dimensional interaction parameter spaces, potentially housing many fixed points of various stabilities. They also highlight the central role of entangled conformal operators and their entropy in shaping universality classes of surface topological quantum phase transitions. We conclude with open questions and possible future directions.

Title: Variational Gaussian Approximation in Replica Analysis of Parametric Models
Authors: Takashi Takahashi
Abstract: We revisit the replica method for analyzing inference and learning in parametric models, considering situations where the data-generating distribution is unknown or analytically intractable. Instead of assuming idealized distributions to carry out quenched averages analytically, we use a variational Gaussian approximation for the replicated system in grand canonical formalism in which the data average can be deferred and replaced by empirical averages, leading to stationarity conditions that adaptively determine the parameters of the trial Hamiltonian for each dataset. This approach clarifies how fluctuations affect information extraction and connects directly with the results of mathematical statistics or learning theory such as information criteria. As a concrete application, we analyze linear regression and derive learning curves. This includes cases with real-world datasets, where exact replica calculations are not feasible.

Title: QDFlow: A Python package for physics simulations of quantum dot devices
Authors: Donovan L. Buterakos, Sandesh S. Kalantre, Joshua Ziegler, Jacob M Taylor, Justyna P. Zwolak
Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have accelerated progress in calibrating and operating quantum dot (QD) devices. However, most ML approaches rely on access to large, representative datasets designed to capture the full spectrum of data quality encountered in practice, with both high- and low-quality data for training, benchmarking, and validation, with labels capturing key features of the device state. Collating such datasets experimentally is challenging due to limited data availability, slow measurement bandwidths, and the labor-intensive nature of labeling. QDFlow is an open-source physics simulator for multi-QD arrays that generates realistic synthetic data with ground-truth labels. QDFlow combines a self-consistent Thomas-Fermi solver, a dynamic capacitance model, and flexible noise modules to simulate charge stability diagrams and ray-based data closely resembling experiments. With an extensive set of parameters that can be varied and customizable noise models, QDFlow supports the creation of large, diverse datasets for ML development, benchmarking, and quantum device research.

Title: Spin-polarized chiral ZnIn2S4 for targeted solar-driven CO2 reduction to acetic acid
Authors: Yongping Cui, Yuanbo Li, Zhi-qiang Wang, Xueliang Zhang, Lu Han, Xueli Wang, Jinquan Chen, Aokun Liu, Lu Yu, Changlin Tian, Xue-qing Gong, Wanning Zhang, Yuxi Fang
Abstract: Acetic acid, an important industrial chemical, is a key target product for CO2 reduction due to its dual role in carbon utilization and chemical feedstock supply. Although photocatalytic CO2 reduction (PCCR) can generate acetic acid alongside other multicarbon products, its yield is typically low, limited by competing reactions and inefficient C-C coupling. Herein, we report a chiral mesostructured ZnIn2S4 (CMZI) photocatalyst that achieves a remarkable acetic acid yield of 962 {umol g-1 h-1 with a high selectivity of 97.3 %. This yield is ten times higher than the current highest reported value, while attaining state-of-the-art selectivity10. The remarkable productivity arises from synergistic effect between chiral structure and sulfur (S) sites of CMZI. Chirality-induced spin polarization in CMZI stabilizes the key triplet OCCO intermediate, significantly promoting C-C coupling efficiency. Theoretical calculations reveal that the S sites on {102} crystal facets of ZnIn2S4 exhibit thermodynamic and kinetic preferences for acetic acid formation. This work offers critical insights into catalytic strategies for CO2 reduction toward the efficient and scalable synthesis of various multicarbon products.

Title: Revisiting dissipation-driven phase transition in a Josephson junction
Authors: Diego Subero, Yu-Cheng-Chang, Miguel Monteiro, Ze-Yan Chen, Jukka P. Pekola
Abstract: Despite extensive experimental and theoretical work over several decades, Schmid-Bulgadaev quantum phase transition remains a subject of debate. Here we revisit this problem by performing systematic experiments on low-frequency current-voltage characteristics of Josephson junctions over a wide range of parameters. The experiments are conducted in a true resistive environment formed by a metallic on-chip resistor located near the junction. Over the parameter range of the experiment, we find that the transition occurs when the resistance crosses the quantum value $h/(4e^2)\simeq 6.5$ k$\Omega$ for Cooper pairs, as originally predicted. The temperature $T$ of the experiment is naturally non-zero, but our basic theoretical modeling corroborates that the observations under these conditions can serve as the basis for the conclusions made, in particular, the crossover resistance from superconducting to insulating regime is the same as that at $T=0$.

Title: Multiferroicity of oxygen-deficient Hf$_x$Zr$_{1-x}$O$_{2-y}$ nanoparticles

Laguta, Lesya P. Yurchenko, Lesya Demchenko, Myroslav V. Karpets, Olena M. Fesenko, Victor V. Vainberg, Eugene A. Eliseev
Abstract: We observed a superparamagnetic-type response of ultra-small (5 - 10 nm in size) Hf$_x$Zr$_{1-x}$O$_{2-y}$ nanoparticles prepared by the solid-state organonitrate synthesis. The Raman spectra indicate the decisive role of surface defects, presumably oxygen vacancies, for all studied x = 1, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4 and significant degree "y" of oxygen deficiency. At the same time elemental analysis did not reveal any noticeable concentration of magnetic impurities in theHf$_x$Zr$_{1-x}$O$_{2-y}$ nanopowders, and the X-ray diffraction analysis reveals the dominant presence (from 87 to 96 wt. %) of the orthorhombic phase. Therefore, the superparamagnetic response of the nanoparticles is explained by the appearance of magnetic state of oxygen vacancies accumulated near their surface. The Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire approach, density functional theory calculations and dielectric measurements reveal that the studied ultra-small Hf$_x$Zr$_{1-x}$O$_{2-y}$ nanoparticles may have ferroelectric-like properties and giant dielectric permittivity (> 10^3 - 10^5) in the frequency range 4 Hz - 10 kHz. In this work we observed that the static relative dielectric permittivity of the Hf$_x$Zr$_{1-x}$O$_{2-y}$ nanopowders overcomes 10^6 and related the colossal values with the superparaelectric states of the ultra-small cores of the this http URL, obtained results open the way for the creation of silicon-compatible multiferroics - oxygen-deficient Hf$_x$Zr$_{1-x}$O$_{2-y}$ nanoparticles with the superparamagnetic and superparaelectric properties, indispensable ultra-high k nanomaterials for advanced FETs and electronic logic elements.

Title: The Limits of Inference in Complex Systems: When Stochastic Models Become Indistinguishable
Authors: Javier Aguilar, Miguel A. Muñoz, Sandro Azaele
Abstract: Robust inference for stochastic dynamical systems is often hampered by sparse sampling and the absence of closed-form likelihoods. We introduce a Monte Carlo path-inference framework that leverages full-path statistics and bridge processes to deliver reliable parameter estimation and model selection from coarsely sampled time series, without requiring analytical solutions. Crucially, we couple mechanistic stochastic models with their inference procedures to quantify how experimental design -specifically, sampling frequency and dataset size- governs estimator precision and model distinguishability. This analysis reveals optimal sampling regimes and sharp, resolution-dependent limits beyond which competing models become empirically indistinguishable. We validate the approach across four disparate systems -trajectories of optically trapped particles, human microbiome dynamics, social-media topic mentions, and forest population time series- recovering parameters and identifying when inference is fundamentally constrained by measurement resolution, thereby clarifying ongoing debates about dominant noise sources in these systems. Together, these results establish path-based Monte Carlo as a practical, general tool for inference and model discrimination in complex systems and provide principled guidelines for designing measurements that maximize information under real-world constraints.

Title: Extrapolation of Machine-Learning Interatomic Potentials for Organic and Polymeric Systems
Authors: Natalie E. Hooven, Arthur Y. Lin, Rose K. Cersonsky
Abstract: Machine-Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) have surged in popularity due to their promise of expanding the spatiotemporal scales possible for simulating molecules with high fidelity. The accuracy of any MLIP is dependent on the data used for its training; thus, for large molecules, like polymers, where accurate training data is prohibitively difficult to obtain, it becomes necessary to pursue non-traditional methods to construct MLIPs, many of which are based on constructing MLIPs using smaller, analogous chemical systems. However, we have yet to understand the limits to which smaller molecules can be used as a proxy for extrapolating macromolecular energetics. Here, we provide a ``control study'' for such experiments, exploring the ability of MLIP approaches to extrapolate between n=1-8 n-polyalkanes at identical conditions. Through Principal Covariates Classification, we quantitatively demonstrate how convergence in chemical environments between training and testing datasets coincides with an MLIP's transferability. Additionally, we show how careful attention to the construction of an MLIP's neighbor list can promote greater transferability when considering various levels of the energetic hierarchy. Our results establish a roadmap for how one can create transferable MLIPs for macromolecular systems without the prohibitive cost of constructing system-specific training data.

Title: Room-Temperature Superconductivity at 298 K in Ternary La-Sc-H System at High-pressure Conditions
Authors: Yinggang Song, Chuanheng Ma, Hongbo Wang, Mi Zhou, Yanpeng Qi, Weizheng Cao, Shourui Li, Hanyu Liu, Guangtao Liu, Yanming Ma
Abstract: Room-temperature superconductor has been a century-long dream of humankind. Recent research on hydrogen-based superconductors (e.g., CaH6, LaH10, etc.) at high-pressure conditions lifts the record of superconducting critical temperature (Tc) up to ~250 kelvin. We here report the experimental synthesis of the first-ever room-temperature superconductor by compression on a mixture of La-Sc alloy and ammonia borane at pressures of 250-260 gigapascals (GPa) via a diamond anvil cell by a laser-heating technique. Superconductivity with an onset temperature of 271-298 kelvin at 195-266 GPa is observed by the measurement of zero electrical resistance and the suppression of Tc under applied magnetic fields. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction data unambiguously reveal that this superconductor crystallizes in a hexagonal structure with a stoichiometry LaSc2H24, in excellent agreement with our previous prediction1. Through thirteen reproducible experimental runs, we provide solid evidence of the realization of a room-temperature superconductor for the first time, marking a milestone in the field of superconductivity.

Title: Spin-phonon coupling and isotope-related pseudo-molecule vibrations in layered Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ ferromagnet
Authors: Grzegorz Krasucki, Katarzyna Olkowska-Pucko, Tomasz Woźniak, Mihai I. Sturza, Holger Kohlmann, Adam Babiński, Maciej R. Molas
Abstract: The vibrational structure of chromium germanium telluride (Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$, CGT) is investigated and a strong spin-phonon coupling is revealed. The measured high-resolution Raman scattering (RS) spectra are composed of the 10 Raman-active modes: 5A$_\textrm{g}$ and 5E$_\textrm{g}$, predicted by calculation using the density functional theory and identified using polarization-resolved RS measurements. We also studied the effect of temperature on the RS spectra of CGT from 5~K to 300~K. A strong magneto-phonon coupling in CGT is revealed at temperatures of about 150~K and 60~K, which are associated with the appearance of the local magnetic order in the material and the transition to the complete ferromagnetic phase, respectively. Moreover, a unique shape of the A$_g^5$ mode composed of a set of very narrow Raman peaks is simulated using a model that takes into account vibrations of Ge-Ge pseudo-molecules for various Ge isotopes.

Title: Spin-dependent orbital selectivity and partial Kondo-screening in magnetically ordered Hund's metal
Authors: Shivani Bhardwaj, Sudhir K. Pandey
Abstract: Hund's metallicity in 3$d$ transition metal oxides constitutes a rare class of compounds, since they have been long understood considering the dominance of Hubbard $U$. $\mathrm{LiV_2O_4}$\& $\mathrm{Sr_2CoO_4}$ belong to this rare class of metals; among them, $\mathrm{LiV_2O_4}$ has been the subject of extensive investigations for its unconventional heavy-fermion behavior, while studies on $\mathrm{Sr_2CoO_4}$ remain limited despite its anomalous ferromagnetic ground state. In this study, we report an unusual spin-orbital selective localization in $\mathrm{Sr_2CoO_4}$ leading to a sharp Kondo resonance at $\sim$70 K in the spin-$up$ channel of orbitals of $t_{2g}$ symmetry using a combination of Density functional theory and Dynamical mean field theory (DFT+DMFT) calculations. Correspondingly, an appreciable reduction in the magnetization below $T$=100 K further suggests partial Kondo screening of local moments active at low temperatures, explaining its effective spin magnetization state and upturn in its resistivity observed in experimental reports. We note a significant effect of Hund's induced spin-orbital selective incoherence in dictating the temperature evolution of its macroscopic observables e.g. spin-spin correlation function and effective local moment. Our results reveal a potentially distinct/new form of spin-dependent selectivity induced via Hund's coupling in addition to the conventional orbital-selectivity in the Hund's metals, as a plausible key mechanism in stabilizing their long-range magnetic order.

Title: Polarization dependence of spin-electric transitions in molecular exchange qubits
Authors: Filippo Troiani, Athanassios K. Boudalis
Abstract: Quasi-optical experiments are emerging as a powerful technique to probe magnetic transitions in molecular spin systems. However, the simultaneous presence of the electric- and magnetic-dipole induced transitions poses the challenge of discriminating between these two contributions. Besides, the identification of the spin-electric transitions can hardly rely on the peak intensity, because of the current uncertainties on the value of the spin-electric coupling in most molecular compounds. Here, we compute the polarizations required for electric- and magnetic-dipole induced transitions through spin-Hamiltonian models of molecular spin triangles. We show that the polarization allows a clear discrimination between the two kinds of transitions. In addition, it allows one to identify the physical origin of the zero-field splitting in the ground multiplet, a debated issue with significant implications on the coherence properties of the spin qubit implemented in molecular spin triangles.

Title: Entropic convergence and the linearized limit for the Boltzmann equation with external force
Authors: Tina Mai
Abstract: This paper extends the results regarding entropic convergence and the strong linearized limit for the Boltzmann equation (without external force) in [C. David Levermore. Entropic convergence and the linearized limit for the Boltzmann equation. Communications in Partial Differential Equations, 18(7-8):1231--1248, 1993] to the case of the Boltzmann equation with external force. Our starting point is the Boltzmann equation with an external force introduced in [Diogo Arsénio and Laure Saint-Raymond. From the Vlasov--Maxwell--Boltzmann System to Incompressible Viscous Electro-magneto-hydrodynamics, EMS Press, 2019], we then find new conditions on the force and rigorously prove the maintaining result by Levermore. More specifically, any sequence of DiPerna-Lions renormalized solutions of the Boltzmann equation with external force are shown to have fluctuations (about the global Maxwellian equilibrium $M$) that converge entropically (and hence strongly in $L^1$) to the solution of the linearized Boltzmann equation for any positive time, given that its initial fluctuations about $M$ converge entropically to the provided $L^2$ initial data of the linearized equation, where the force can be physically significant.

Title: Thermodynamics of Darwinian selection in molecular replicators
Authors: Artemy Kolchinsky
Abstract: We consider the relationship between thermodynamics, fitness, and Darwinian selection in autocatalytic molecular replicators. We uncover a thermodynamic bound that relates fitness, replication rate, and thermodynamic affinity of replication. This bound applies to a broad range of systems, including elementary and non-elementary autocatalytic reactions, polymer-based replicators, and certain kinds of autocatalytic sets. In addition, we show that the critical selection coefficient (the minimal fitness difference visible to selection) is bounded by a simple function of the affinity. Our results imply fundamental thermodynamic bounds on selection strength in molecular evolution, complementary to other bounds that arise from finite population sizes and error thresholds. These bounds may be relevant for understanding thermodynamic constraints faced by early replicators at the origin of life. We illustrate our approach on several examples, including a classic model of replicators in a chemostat.

Title: Entanglemons: Cross-platform protected qubits from entanglement
Authors: Nilotpal Chakraborty, Roderich Moessner, Benoit Doucot
Abstract: A crucial ingredient for scalable fault-tolerant quantum computing is the construction of logical qubits with low error rates and intrinsic noise protection. We propose a cross-platform construction for such hardware-level noise-protection in which the qubits are protected from depolarizing (relaxation) and dephasing errors induced by local noise. These logical qubits arise from the entanglement between two internal degrees of freedom, hence - entanglemons. Our construction is based on the emergence of collective degrees of freedom from a generalized coherent state construction, similar in spirit to spin coherent states, of a set of such internally entangled units. These degrees of freedom, for a finite number of units, parametrize the quantized version of complex projective space $\mathbb{C}$P(3). The noise protection of the entanglemon qubit is then a consequence of a weakly coupled emergent degree of freedom arising due to the non-linear geometry of complex projective space. We present two simple models for entanglemons which are platform agnostic, provide varying levels of protection and in which the qubit basis states are the two lowest energy states with a higher energy gap to other states. We end by commenting on how entanglemons could be realized in platforms ranging from superconducting circuits and trapped ion platforms to possibly also quantum Hall skyrmions in graphene and quantum dots in semiconductors. The inherent noise protection in our models combined with the platform agnosticism highlights the potential of encoding information in additional weakly coupled emergent degrees of freedom arising in non-linear geometrical spaces and curved phase spaces, thereby proposing a different route to achieve scalable fault-tolerance.

Title: Double rotatory power reversal, continuous Kerr angle, and enhanced reflectance in bi-isotropic media with anomalous Hall current
Authors: Alex Q. Costa, Pedro D. S. Silva, Manoel M. Ferreira Jr
Abstract: We investigate the optical properties of bi-isotropic materials under the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) of axion electrodynamics. Four refractive indices associated with circularly polarized waves are achieved, implying circular birefringence with rotatory power endowed with double sign reversal, an exotic optical signature for chiral dielectrics. The Kerr rotation and ellipticity are analyzed, with an unusual observation of a giant rotation angle deprived of discontinuity. Anomalous enhanced reflectance (R greater than unity) is also reported, associated with negative refraction stemming from the anomalous transport properties. These effects constitute the singular optical signature of a nonequilibrium bi-isotropic medium with the AHE.

Title: Symmetry and causality constraints on Fermi liquids
Authors: Luca V. Delacrétaz, Subham Dutta Chowdhury, Umang Mehta
Abstract: We investigate symmetry and causality constraints on interacting Fermi liquids. Whereas Galilean or Lorentz boost symmetry leads to a well-known constraint on the first Landau parameter $F_1$, we show that scale invariance similarly constrains $F_0$. In the case of conformal Fermi liquids, we show that causality constraints on the particle-hole continuum and on zero sound strongly restrict the available parameter space for interacting Fermi liquids. We also consider nonlinear response, which we show is sensitive to additional ``generalized Landau parameters'' even at lowest orders in the long wavelength limit. We impose Galilean, Lorentz and scale symmetry on these generalized Landau parameters, obtaining further nonlinear constraints. We test our constraints in several microscopic models that enter a Fermi liquid phase.

Title: Robust purely optical signatures of Floquet states in laser-dressed crystals
Authors: Vishal Tiwari, Roman Korol, Ignacio Franco
Abstract: Strong light-matter interactions can create non-equilibrium materials with on-demand novel functionalities. For periodically driven solids, the Floquet theorem provides the natural states to characterize the physical properties of these laser-dressed systems. However, signatures of the Floquet states are needed, as common experimental conditions, such as pulsed laser excitation and dissipative many-body dynamics, can disrupt their formation and survival. Here, we identify a tell-tale signature of Floquet states in the linear optical response of laser-dressed solids that remains prominent even in the presence of strong spectral congestion of bulk matter. To do so, we introduce a computationally efficient strategy based on the Floquet formalism to finally capture the full frequency-dependence in the optical response properties of realistic laser-dressed crystals, and use it investigate the Floquet engineering in a first-principle model for ZnO of full dimensionality. The computations reveal intense, spectrally isolated, laser-controllable, absorption/stimulated emission features at mid-infrared energies present for a wide range of laser-driving conditions that arise due to the hybridization of the Floquet states. As such, these spectral features open a purely optical pathway to investigate the birth and survival of Floquet states while avoiding the experimental challenges of fully reconstructing the band structure.

Abstract: Semiconductors are among the most promising platforms to implement large-scale quantum computers, as advanced manufacturing techniques allow fabrication of large quantum dot arrays. Various qubit encodings can be used to store and manipulate quantum information on these quantum dot arrays. Regardless of qubit encoding, precise control over the exchange interaction between electrons confined in quantum dots in the array is critical. Furthermore, it is necessary to execute high-fidelity quantum operations concurrently to make full use of the limited coherence of individual qubits. Here, we demonstrate the parallel operation of two exchange-only qubits, consisting of six quantum dots in a linear arrangement. Using randomized benchmarking techniques, we show that issuing pulses on the five barrier gates to modulate exchange interactions in a maximally parallel way maintains the quality of qubit control relative to sequential operation. The techniques developed to perform parallel exchange pulses can be readily adapted to other quantum-dot based encodings. Moreover, we show the first experimental demonstrations of an iSWAP gate and of a charge-locking Pauli spin blockade readout method. The results are validated using cross-entropy benchmarking, a technique useful for performance characterization of larger quantum computing systems; here it is used for the first time on a quantum system based on semiconductor technology.

Title: Donor-Acceptor Pairs near Silicon Carbide surfaces
Authors: Anil Bilgin, Ian N. Hammock, Alexander A. High, Giulia Galli
Abstract: Donor-acceptor pairs (DAPs) in wide-bandgap semiconductors are promising platforms for the realization of quantum technologies, due to their optically controllable, long-range dipolar interactions. Specifically, Al-N DAPs in bulk silicon carbide (SiC) have been predicted to enable coherent coupling over distances exceeding 10 nm. However, their practical implementations require an understanding of the properties of these pairs near surfaces and interfaces. Here, using first principles calculations we investigate how the presence of surfaces influence the stability and optical properties of Al-N DAPs in SiC, and we show that they retain favorable optical properties comparable to their bulk counterparts, despite a slight increase in electron-phonon coupling. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of surface-defect pairs (SDPs), where an electron-hole pair is generated between a near-surface defect and an occupied surface state located in the bandgap of the material. We show that vanadium-based SDPs near OH-terminated 4H-SiC surfaces exhibit dipoles naturally aligned perpendicular to the surface, greatly enhancing dipole-dipole coupling between SDPs. Our results also reveal significant polarization-dependent modulation in the stimulated emission and photoionization cross sections of V-based SDPs, which are tunable by two orders of magnitude via the polarization angle of the incident laser light. The near-surface defects investigated here provide novel possibilities for the development of hybrid quantum-classical interfaces, as they can be used to mediate information transfer between quantum nodes and integrated photonic circuits.

Title: Emergent random matrix universality in quantum operator dynamics
Authors: Oliver Lunt, Thomas Kriecherbauer, Kenneth T-R McLaughlin, Curt von Keyserlingk
Abstract: The high complexity of many-body quantum dynamics means that essentially all approaches either exploit special structure or are approximate in nature. One such approach--the memory function formalism--involves a carefully chosen split into fast and slow modes. An approximate model for the fast modes can then be used to solve for Green's functions $G(z)$ of the slow modes. Using a formulation in operator Krylov space known as the recursion method, we prove the emergence of a universal random matrix description of the fast mode dynamics. This is captured by the level-$n$ Green's function $G_n (z)$, which we show approaches universal scaling forms in the fast limit $n\to\infty$. Notably, this emergent universality can occur in both chaotic and non-chaotic systems, provided their spectral functions are smooth. This universality of $G_n (z)$ is precisely analogous to the universality of eigenvalue correlations in random matrix theory (RMT), even though there is no explicit randomness present in the Hamiltonian. At finite $z$ we show that $G_n (z)$ approaches the Wigner semicircle law, while if $G(z)$ is the Green's function of certain hydrodynamical variables, we show that at low frequencies $G_n (z)$ is instead governed by the Bessel universality class from RMT. As an application of this universality, we give a numerical method--the spectral bootstrap--for approximating spectral functions from Lanczos coefficients. Our proof involves a map to a Riemann-Hilbert problem which we solve using a steepest-descent-type method, rigorously controlled in the $n\to\infty$ limit. We are led via steepest-descent to a Coulomb gas optimization problem, and we discuss how a recent conjecture--the `Operator Growth Hypothesis--is linked to a confinement transition in this Coulomb gas. These results elevate the recursion method to a theoretically principled framework with universal content.

Title: Phases of Floquet code under local decoherence
Authors: Yuchen Tang, Yimu Bao
Abstract: Floquet code is a dynamical quantum memory with a periodically evolving logical space. As a defining feature, the code exhibits an anyon automorphism after each period, giving rise to a non-trivial evolution of each logical state. In this paper, we study the Floquet code under local decoherence and perfect measurements and demonstrate that below the decoherence threshold, the code is in a robust phase characterized by the anyon automorphism. We first derive the 3D statistical mechanics model for the maximum likelihood decoder of the 2D Floquet code under local Pauli decoherence. We identify a class of two-qubit Pauli channels under which the 3D statistical mechanics model becomes decoupled 2D models and obtain the threshold for such decoherence channels. We then propose a diagnostic of the anyon automorphism in the presence of local decoherence. We analytically show that this diagnostic distinguishes the Floquet code from the toric code under repeated syndrome measurements and undergoes a phase transition at the threshold.

Title: Long-Range Interacting Particles on a Helix: A Statistical and Correlation Analysis of Equilibrium Configurations
Authors: J.M. Dörre, F.K. Diakonos, P. Schmelcher
Abstract: We provide a statistical and correlational analysis of the spatial and energetic properties of equilibrium configurations of a few-body system of two to eight equally charged classical particles that are confined on a one-dimensional helical manifold. The two-body system has been demonstrated to yield an oscillatory effective potential, thus providing stable equilibrium configurations despite the repulsive Coulomb interactions. As the system size grows, the number of equilibria increases, approximately following a power-law. This can be attributed to the increasing complexity in the highly non-linear oscillatory behavior of the potential energy surface. This property is reflected in a crossover from a spatially regular distribution of equilibria for the two-body system to a heightened degree of disorder upon the addition of particles. However, in accordance with the repulsion within a helical winding, the observed interparticle distances in equilibrium configurations cluster around values of odd multiples of half a helical winding, thus maintaining an underlying regularity. Furthermore, an energetic hierarchy exists based on the spatial location of the local equilibria, which is subject to increasing fluctuations as the system size grows.

Title: Piezoelectric truss metamaterials: data-driven design and additive manufacturing
Authors: Saurav Sharma, Satya K. Ammu, Prakash Thakolkaran, Jovana Jovanova, Kunal Masania, Siddhant Kumar
Abstract: In the development of active animate materials, electromechanical coupling is highly attractive to realize mechanoresponsive functionality. Piezoelectricity is the most utilized electromechanical phenomenon due to the wide availability of materials that display precise and reliable coupling. However, the inherent directionality of these materials is constrained by the symmetry of their crystal structure, which limits the choice of available properties in natural piezoelectric materials. A solution to alleviate this limitation could be to leverage geometry or architecture at the mesoscale. Here, we present an integrated framework to design and 3D-print piezoelectric truss metamaterials with customizable anisotropic responses. To explore the vast design space of truss metamaterials, we employ generative machine learning to optimize the topology and geometry of truss lattices and achieve target piezoelectricity. Then, we develop an in-gel-3D printing method to fabricate polymer-ceramic piezoelectric truss metamaterial structures using a composite slurry of photo-curable resin and lead-free piezoelectric particles. The ML framework discovers designs exhibiting unconventional behaviors, including auxetic, unidirectional, and omnidirectional piezoelectricity, while the additive manufacturing technique ensures shaping freedom and precision in fabricating these metamaterials at small scales. Our results show an improvement of over 48% in the specific hydrostatic piezoelectric coefficient in optimized metamaterials over bulk lead zirconate titanate (PZT). We successfully achieved metamaterials with higher transverse piezoelectric coupling coefficient than its longitudinal coefficient, which is a phenomenon that is rare in bulk materials. Our approach enables customizable piezoelectric responses and paves the way towards the development of a new generation of electro-active animate materials.

Title: NNQS-AFQMC: Neural network quantum states enhanced fermionic quantum Monte Carlo
Authors: Zhi-Yu Xiao, Bowen Kan, Huan Ma, Bowen Zhao, Honghui Shang
Abstract: We introduce an efficient approach to implement neural network quantum states (NNQS) as trial wavefunctions in auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC). NNQS are a recently developed class of variational ansätze capable of flexibly representing many-body wavefunctions, though they often incur a high computational cost during optimization. AFQMC, on the other hand, is a powerful stochastic projector approach for ground-state calculations, but it normally requires an approximate constraint via a trial wavefunction or trial density matrix, whose quality affects the accuracy. Recently it has been shown (Xiao et al, arXiv2505.18519) that a broad class of highly correlated wave-functions can be integrated into AFQMC through stochastic sampling techniques. In this work, we apply this approach and present a direct integration of NNQS with AFQMC, allowing NNQS to serve as high-quality trial wavefunctions for AFQMC with manageable computational cost. We test the NNQS-AFQMC method on the challenging nitrogen molecule (N$_2$) at stretched geometries. Our results demonstrate that AFQMC with an NNQS trial wavefunction can attain near-exact total energies, highlighting the potential of AFQMC with NNQS to overcome longstanding challenges in strongly correlated electronic structure calculations. We also outline future research directions for improving this promising methodology.

Title: Two-photon coupling via Josephson element II: Interaction renormalizations and cross-Kerr coupling
Authors: Eugene V. Stolyarov, V. L. Andriichuk, Andrii M. Sokolov
Abstract: We study the interactions mediated by symmetric superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID), their renormalizations, and applicability of the anharmonic oscillator model for a coupled phase qubit. The coupling SQUID can switch between single- or two-photon interaction in situ. We consider a coupled resonator and an rf SQUID. The latter dwells in the vicinity of its metastable well holding a number of anharmonic energy states and acts as an artificial atom known as the phase qubit. Apart from the linear and two-photon couplings, interactions of optomechanical type and a cross-Kerr coupling arise. Near the two-photon resonance, we calculate the renormalizations due to nonresonant interactions, which are more prominent with the higher Josephson energy of the coupler. We interpret the renormalizations by depicting some of the virtual processes involved. That also allows us to determine the minimal amount of metastable states in the phase qubit for the renormalization formulas to hold.

Authors: Petr Beneš, Filip Blaschke
Abstract: We consider a class of spontaneously broken $SU(2)$ gauge theories with adjoint scalar and look for exact magnetic monopole solutions in the Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) limit. We find that some of the resulting solutions exhibit a new internal degree of freedom (a moduli space parameter) that controls the energy density profile of the monopole while keeping the total energy (mass) constant.

Title: Advancing the hBN Defects Database through Photophysical Characterization of Bulk hBN
Authors: Chanaprom Cholsuk, Sujin Suwanna, Tobias Vogl
Abstract: Quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have gained significant attention due to a wide range of defects that offer high quantum efficiency and single-photon purity at room temperature. Most theoretical studies on hBN defects simulate monolayers, as this is computationally cheaper than calculating bulk structures. However, most experimental studies are carried out on multilayer to bulk hBN, which creates additional possibilities for discrepancies between theory and experiment. In this work, we present an extended database of hBN defects that includes a comprehensive set of bulk hBN defects along with their excited-state photophysical properties. The database features over 120 neutral defects, systematically evaluated across charge states ranging from -2 to 2 (600 defects in total). For each defect, the most stable charge and spin configurations are identified and used to compute the zero-phonon line, photoluminescence spectrum, absorption spectrum, Huang-Rhys (HR) factor, interactive radiative lifetimes, transition dipole moments, and polarization characteristics. Our analysis reveals that the electron-phonon coupling strength is primarily influenced by the presence of vacancies, which tend to induce stronger lattice distortions and broaden phonon sidebands. Additionally, correlation analysis shows that while most properties are independent, the HR factor strongly correlates with the configuration coordinates. All data are publicly available at this https URL, along with a new application programming interface (API) to facilitate integration with machine learning workflows. This database is therefore designed to bridge the gap between theory and experiment, aid in the reliable identification of quantum emitters, and support the development of machine-learning-driven approaches in quantum materials research.

Title: Riemannian Optimization on Tree Tensor Networks with Application in Machine Learning
Authors: Marius Willner, Marco Trenti, Dirk Lebiedz
Abstract: Tree tensor networks (TTNs) are widely used in low-rank approximation and quantum many-body simulation. In this work, we present a formal analysis of the differential geometry underlying TTNs. Building on this foundation, we develop efficient first- and second-order optimization algorithms that exploit the intrinsic quotient structure of TTNs. Additionally, we devise a backpropagation algorithm for training TTNs in a kernel learning setting. We validate our methods through numerical experiments on a representative machine learning task.

Title: The Group-IV-Vacancy Color Center in Diamond
Authors: Fenglei Gu
Abstract: Group-IV vacancy (G4V, or XV, where X = Si, Ge, Sn, Pb) color centers constitute a novel and promising class of defects in diamonds. This chapter reviews and refines the theoretical models for the XV systems, encompassing the intrinsic interactions, including spin-orbit coupling and electron-phonon interactions, and the external interactions involving strain, electric, light, and magnetic fields. Based on the refined model, we predict their properties, explain the experimental data, and suggest follow-up experiments. This article established a solid foundation for controlling the XV system, thus paving the way for quantum information processing.

Title: Stabilizer-Shannon Renyi Equivalence: Exact Results for Quantum Critical Chains
Authors: M. A. Rajabpour
Abstract: Shannon-Renyi and stabilizer entropies are key diagnostics of structure, non-stabilizerness, phase transitions, and universality in quantum many-body states. We establish an exact correspondence for quadratic fermions: for any nondegenerate Gaussian eigenstate, the stabilizer Renyi entropy equals the Shannon-Renyi entropy of a number-conserving free-fermion eigenstate on a doubled system, evaluated in the computational basis. Specializing to the transverse-field Ising (TFI) chain, the TFI ground state stabilizer entropies maps to the Shannon-Renyi entropies of the XX-chain ground state of length $2L$. Building on this correspondence, together with other exact identities we prove, closed expressions for the stabilizer entropy at indices $\alpha=\frac{1}{2},2,4$ for a broad class of critical closed free-fermion systems were derived. Each of these can be written with respect to the universal functions of the TFI chain. We further obtain conformal-field-theory scaling laws for the stabilizer entropy under both periodic and open boundaries at arbitrary Renyi index for these critical systems.

Title: Infrared Spectroradiometry of Lithium Benzoate from 21 to 235 THz
Authors: Yoshitaka Okuyama, Youichi Ishikawa, Daishi Fujita
Abstract: This paper presents an extensive survey of the thermal radiation properties of lithium benzoate. We heated the sample from 313 to 553 K, just below the melting point, while performing an infrared spectroradiometry with an FT-IR spectrometer from 21 to 235 THz (700-7800 cm$^{-1}$). We have provided a detailed analysis of the infrared spectrum data and a comparison of the absorption spectrum of the same sample. It turned out that the recorded spectra are not only different from ordinary absorption spectra but also carry substantial information about the temperature dependence of the population of vibrationally excited states. We conclude by proposing a hypothesis on the thermal excitation mechanism of vibrational energy levels of molecules consistent with the distinct characteristics of the obtained infrared emission spectra.

Title: Error stabilized logical qubits in qudit generalizations of the monitored Kitaev model
Authors: Aayush Vijayvargia, Ezra Day-Roberts, Onur Erten
Abstract: Monitored dynamics in quantum circuits provide tunable platforms for the realization of novel non-equilibrium phases. Motivated by recent advances in monitored Kitaev circuits, we investigate the monitored dynamics of the qudit ($d=4$) generalizations of the Kitaev model on the honeycomb and square lattices. In the absence of additional perturbations, the measurement-only dynamics of these models map onto multi-flavor loop models and display either critical or area-law entanglement scaling. Magnetic field terms couple different flavors and when measured with sufficiently large probability, they enhance the stability of the area-law phase that hosts the logical qubits. In a circuit picture, these terms correspond to single-qubit measurements and can be interpreted as errors. We also examine the impact of two-qubit measurements that commute with the plaquette operator, which induce effective non-quadratic interactions between Majorana fermions. These interactions can drive a transition to a volume-law-entangled phase and, for sufficiently strong coupling, stabilize a distinct area-law phase with an additional logical qubit for the square lattice model. Our results reveal a rich interplay between quantum spin liquids and monitored circuit dynamics, highlighting new mechanisms for engineering and controlling entanglement phases in multi-flavor Majorana systems.

Title: Mpemba Effects in Quantum Complexity
Authors: Sreemayee Aditya, Alessandro Summer, Piotr Sierant, Xhek Turkeshi
Abstract: The Mpemba effect is the phenomenon whereby systems farther from equilibrium may relax faster. In this work, we show that this counterintuitive behavior appears in the very measures that define quantum complexity. Using the framework of quantum resource theories, we study the dynamics of coherence, imaginarity, non-Gaussianity, and magic state resources in random circuit models. Our results reveal that coherence and imaginarity display a quantum Mpemba effect when the system is initialized in resourceful product states, while non-Gaussianity and magic do not. Strikingly, all four resources exhibit the so-called Pontus-Mpemba effect: an initial "preheating" stage accelerates relaxation compared to direct "cooling" dynamics. Taken together, our findings show that Mpemba physics extends beyond thermodynamics and asymmetry, emerging broadly in the resource theories that capture aspects of quantum complexity.

Title: Generalized Wigner theorem for non-invertible symmetries
Authors: Gerardo Ortiz, Chinmay Giridhar, Philipp Vojta, Andriy H. Nevidomskyy, Zohar Nussinov
Abstract: We establish the conditions under which a conservation law associated with a non-invertible operator may be realized as a symmetry in quantum mechanics. As established by Wigner, all quantum symmetries must be represented by either unitary or antiunitary transformations. Relinquishing an implicit assumption of invertibility, we demonstrate that the fundamental invariance of quantum transition probabilities under the application of symmetries mandates that all non-invertible symmetries may only correspond to {\it projective} unitary or antiunitary transformations, i.e., {\it partial isometries}. This extends the notion of physical states beyond conventional rays in Hilbert space to equivalence classes in an {\it extended, gauged Hilbert space}, thereby broadening the traditional understanding of symmetry transformations in quantum theory. We discuss consequences of this result and explicitly illustrate how, in simple model systems, whether symmetries be invertible or non-invertible may be inextricably related to the particular boundary conditions that are being used.

Title: Quantum Fisher information matrices from Rényi relative entropies
Authors: Mark M. Wilde
Abstract: Quantum generalizations of the Fisher information are important in quantum information science, with applications in high energy and condensed matter physics and in quantum estimation theory, machine learning, and optimization. One can derive a quantum generalization of the Fisher information matrix in a natural way as the Hessian matrix arising in a Taylor expansion of a smooth divergence. Such an approach is appealing for quantum information theorists, given the ubiquity of divergences in quantum information theory. In contrast to the classical case, there is not a unique quantum generalization of the Fisher information matrix, similar to how there is not a unique quantum generalization of the relative entropy or the Rényi relative entropy. In this paper, I derive information matrices arising from the log-Euclidean, $\alpha$-$z$, and geometric Rényi relative entropies, with the main technical tool for doing so being the method of divided differences for calculating matrix derivatives. Interestingly, for all non-negative values of the Rényi parameter $\alpha$, the log-Euclidean Rényi relative entropy leads to the Kubo-Mori information matrix, and the geometric Rényi relative entropy leads to the right-logarithmic derivative Fisher information matrix. Thus, the resulting information matrices obey the data-processing inequality for all non-negative values of the Rényi parameter $\alpha$ even though the original quantities do not. Additionally, I derive and establish basic properties of $\alpha$-$z$ information matrices resulting from the $\alpha$-$z$ Rényi relative entropies. For parameterized thermal states and time-evolved states, I establish formulas for their $\alpha$-$z$ information matrices and hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for estimating them, with applications in quantum Boltzmann machine learning.
