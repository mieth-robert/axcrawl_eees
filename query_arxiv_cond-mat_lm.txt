Title: Magnetophoresis of Weakly Magnetic Nanoparticle Suspension Around a Wire
Authors: Mohd Bilal Khan, Peter Rassolov, Jamel Ali, Theo Siegrist, Munir Humayun, Hadi Mohammadigoushki
Abstract: We present a combined experimental and numerical study into the magnetophoresis behavior of weakly magnetic nanoparticle suspensions in the vicinity of a wire under a non-uniform magnetic field and negligible inertia. The experiments were conducted within a closed rectangular cuvette, with a wire positioned between the poles of an electromagnet. Two types of nanoparticles, paramagnetic manganese oxide and diamagnetic bismuth oxide, were studied across a broad range of concentrations (10-100 mgL), magnetic field strengths (0.25-1 T), and wire diameters (0.8-3.17 mm). Our experimental findings reveal that upon the application of a magnetic field, paramagnetic nanoparticles experience a strong, attractive force toward the wire periphery. This force generates vortices and secondary flows around the wire, depleting particles from the bulk of the cuvette and concentrating them near the wire surface. The magnetophoresis dynamics of paramagnetic nanoparticles are shown to scale with their initial concentration, wire diameter, and the strength of the external magnetic field. In contrast, diamagnetic nanoparticles exhibit markedly different behavior, with their magnetophoresis dynamics showing minimal dependence on initial concentration and magnetic field strength, while being inversely proportional to the wire diameter. Multiphysics numerical simulations complement the experimental observations, revealing the formation of field-induced particle clusters in weakly paramagnetic nanoparticles, which enhance magnetophoresis. Additionally, the critical magnetic field threshold for the onset of cluster formation is found to be lower than those predicted by theoretical models for clustering in uniform magnetic fields. Under specific conditions, including high magnetic field strengths and elevated nanoparticle concentrations, diamagnetic nanoparticles appear to undergo field-induced clustering.

Title: Spatially Local Estimates of the Thermal Conductivity of Materials
Authors: C. Ugwumadu, A. Gautam, Y. G. Lee, D. A. Drabold
Abstract: In this paper we describe a spatial decomposition of the thermal conductivity, what we name "site-projected thermal conductivity", a gauge of the thermal conduction activity at each site. The method is based on the Green-Kubo formula and the harmonic approximation, and requires the force-constant and dynamical matrices and of course the structure of a model sitting at an energy minimum. Throughout the paper, we use high quality models previously tested and compared to many experiments. We discuss the method and underlying approximations for amorphous silicon, carry our detailed analysis for amorphous silicon, then examine an amorphous-crystal silicon interface, and representative carbon materials. We identify the sites and local structures that reduce heat transport, and quantify these (estimate the spatial range) over which these "thermal defects" are effective. Similarities emerge between these filamentary structures in the amorphous silicon network which impact heat transport, electronic structure (the Urbach edge) and electronic transport.

Title: Apparent bistability from weak long-range interactions
Authors: Achilleas Lazarides, Andrea Pizzi
Abstract: Bistability, or the coexistence of two stable phases, can be broken by a bias field $h$ destabilising one of the phases via the nucleation and growth of defects. Strong long-range interactions, $1/r^\alpha$ with $\alpha$ less than the system's dimensionality $d$, can suppress the proliferation of defects and restore bistability. The case of weak long-range interactions $d<\alpha < d+1$ remains instead poorly understood. Here, we show that it supports \emph{apparent} bistability: While the system has in principle a unique stable phase, it appears bistable for all practical purposes for $\alpha < \alpha_c$, with $\alpha_c > d$ behaving like a genuine critical point. At the core of this is an exponential scaling of the critical droplet size $R_c\sim h^{-1/(\alpha - d)}$, which makes nucleating destabilizing droplets extremely unlikely for $\alpha < \alpha_c$, and such that $\alpha_c$ is mostly independent of system size. In support of these conclusions we provide field-theoretical arguments and numerics on a probabilistic cellular automaton. Overall, our results offer a way to rethink phase stability in systems with long-range interactions as well as a new route to achieve practical bistability.

Title: Interacting Electronic Topology of Nonlocal Crystals
Authors: Shu Hamanaka, Martina O. Soldini, Tsuneya Yoshida, Titus Neupert
Abstract: Nonlocal crystals are systems with translational symmetry but arbitrary range couplings or interactions between degrees of freedom. We argue that the notion of topology in such systems does not collapse to that in zero dimensions, as one may naively expect in view of the infinite interaction range. At the same time, we show that the range of available topological phases can be enriched in comparison to the case with local interactions. This is demonstrated by constructing an example of a fermionic symmetry-protected phase in one dimension in symmetry class AII with inversion symmetry, using a Hatsugai-Kohmoto-type model. The new phase exists only in a nonlocal crystal with electron-electron interactions and can be identified from symmetry eigenvalues. We construct an associated topological charge pump as a physical manifestation of its topology.

Title: Entanglement Holography in Quantum Phases via Twisted Rényi-N Correlators
Authors: Pablo Sala, Frank Pollmann, Masaki Oshikawa, Yizhi You
Abstract: We introduce a holographic framework for the entanglement Hamiltonian in symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases with area-law entanglement, whose reduced density matrix $\rho \propto e^{-H_e}$ can be treated as a lower-dimensional mixed state. By replicating $\rho$, we reconstruct the fixed-point SPT wavefunction, establishing an exact correspondence between the bulk strange correlator of the (d+1)-dimensional SPT state and the twisted Rényi-N operator of the d-dimensional reduced density matrix. Notably, the reduced density matrix exhibits long-range or quasi-long-range order along the replica direction, revealing a universal entanglement feature in SPT phases. As a colloary, we generalized the framework of twisted Rényi-N correlator to thermal states and open quantum systems, providing an alternative formulation of the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem, applicable to both closed and open systems. Finally, we extend our protocol to mixed-state SPT phases and introduce new quantum information metrics -- twisted Rényi-N correlators of the surgery operator -- to characterize the topology of mixed states.

Title: Worldline deconfinement and emergent long-range interaction in entanglement Hamiltonian and entanglement spectrum
Authors: Zenan Liu, Zhe Wang, Dao-Xin Yao, Zheng Yan
Abstract: When a system exhibits a bulk gap but gapless edge states (e.g., a symmetry-protected topological phase), the entanglement spectrum (ES) resembles the energy spectrum on virtual edge, that is the Li-Haldane conjecture. In this way, the ES plays an important probe to detect the topological phases according to this bulk-edge correspondence. When a system is fully gapped, both in bulk and edge, the ES still remains similar to the virtual edge spectrum which can be explained by the recently proposed wormhole effect in the path integral of reduced density matrix. However, what will happen in the ES when the system is fully gapless? We find that though the ES roughly seems like an edge energy spectrum, and it actually contains relevant long-range interaction which modifies the intrinsic physics of entanglement Hamiltonian (EH). Moreover, the mechanism of short-/long-range interaction in EH can be understood as the confinement/deconfinement of worldlines in a path integral of reduced density matrix. Our work demonstrates that the gapless mode can induce a long-range interaction in EH.

Title: Electron-magnon coupling at the interface of a "twin-twisted" antiferromagnet
Authors: Yue Sun, Fanhao Meng, Sijia Ke, Kun Xu, Hongrui Zhang, Aljoscha Soll, Zdeněk Sofer, Arun Majumdar, Ramamoorthy Ramesh, Jeffrey B. Neaton, Jie Yao, Joseph Orenstein
Abstract: We identify a "twin-twist" angle in orthorhombic two-dimensional magnets that maximizes interlayer orbital overlap and enables strong interfacial coupling. Focusing on the van der Waals antiferromagnet CrSBr, we show that this twist angle, near 72 deg, aligns diagonal lattice vectors across the layers, enhancing the interlayer hopping that is spin-forbidden in pristine systems and orbital-forbidden in 90-deg-twisted samples. The enhanced hopping modifies the electronic structure and activates a novel mechanism for excitation of interfacial magnons. Using optical probes we discover that excitons on one side of the interface selectively excite magnons localized on the opposite side. We show that this cross-coupling phenomenon can be understood as a consequence of the spin-transfer torque as that arises as electrons tunnel across the twin-twisted interface. Our findings demonstrate that large-angle twisting in anisotropic 2D materials offers a powerful tool for engineering spin and charge transport through controlled interlayer hybridization, opening new avenues for twisted magnetism and strongly correlated moiré physics.

Title: Study of the uniform electron gas through parametrized partition functions
Authors: Tommaso Morresi, Giovanni Garberoglio, Hongwei Xiong, Yunuo Xiong
Abstract: We investigate the energy per particle, static structure factor, and momentum distribution of the uniform electron gas for different conditions defined by the dimensionless temperature $\Theta = 0.25 - 1.0$ and average interparticle distance $r_s = 0.5 - 80.0$ using path-integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations. For small $r_\text{s}$ ($r_\text{s}\leq10$) where the sign problem is particularly challenging, we employ a recent approach based on an analytic continuation of the partition function using a real parameter $\xi$, which allows a generalization from bosons ($\xi=1$) to fermions ($\xi=-1$). We show that the results are in good agreement with other state-of-the-art methods while requiring low computational resources. For large $r_\text{s}$ ($r_\text{s}=80$), we use direct PIMC exploiting the good behaviour of the thermodynamic properties for negative $\xi$. In this framework we demonstrate that, for large $r_s$, the small negative region of $\xi$ can be utilized to extract information about the true fermionic limit, where $\xi = -1$.

Title: Mechanisms for the ultralow room-temperature resistivity of SrMoO$_3$
Authors: Jennifer Coulter, Fabian B. Kugler, Harrison LaBollita, Antoine Georges, Cyrus E. Dreyer
Abstract: Materials with exceptionally low resistivities at room temperature are currently heavily sought after for next-generation interconnects. SrMoO$_3$ has one of the lowest experimentally-reported room-temperature resistivities, yet the origin of this property has remained a mystery. Using the Boltzmann transport equation we determine that electron-phonon scattering limits transport at room temperature and is responsible for the approximate $T^2$ behavior of the resistivity at intermediate temperatures, often attributed to electron-electron Fermi-liquid scattering. We show that the weak electron-phonon coupling, which is similar to, e.g., copper, combined with high electron group velocities for states near the Fermi level, explains the low resistivity of SrMoO$_3$. Additionally, the strength of the electron-phonon coupling is found to be sensitive to structural distortions, which may explain disagreements in the literature between single crystal and thin film measurements. The electron-phonon scattering in SrMoO$_3$ is insensitive to static Coulomb interactions in the partially-filled transition-metal $d$ orbitals, in contrast to similar oxides such as SrVO$_3$. These findings have significant implications for theoretical interpretation of direct-current resistivity in transition-metal oxides and beyond.

Title: Coercive Field Reduction in Ultra-thin Al1-XScXN via Interfacial Engineering with a Scandium Electrode
Authors: Yinuo Zhang, Rajeev Kumar Rai, Giovanni Esteves, Yubo Wang, Deep M. Jariwala, Eric A. Stach, Roy H. Olsson III
Abstract: Aluminum scandium nitride (AlScN) ferroelectrics are promising for next-generation non-volatile memory applications due to their high remnant polarization as well as fast switching and scalability to nanometer thicknesses. As device dimensions shrink, the coercive field in ultra-thin ferroelectric films increases, which challenges low-voltage operation. We demonstrate that interfacial engineering through bottom electrode selection and strain management reduces this coercive field increase and improves ferroelectric performance. Robust ferroelectricity is observed in ultra-thin AlScN capacitors deposited on a Sc bottom electrode under both alternating current and direct current conditions. The coercive field is reduced by over 20 percent compared to capacitors with an Al bottom electrode. Furthermore, dynamic switching behavior is analyzed using the KAI model. At low frequencies (less than 16.7 kHz), capacitors with Sc and Al bottom electrodes exhibit comparable KAI exponents (0.036 and 0.028, respectively), indicating similar switching kinetics. However, at higher frequencies, the capacitor with an Al bottom electrode shows a significantly higher exponent (0.093), indicating stronger frequency dependence, whereas the capacitor with a Sc bottom electrode maintains a stable exponent of 0.036. Scanning Electron Nanobeam Diffraction is used to measure strain differences in AlScN thin films grown on templates with different lattice mismatch, revealing a correlation between lattice mismatch, film strain, and switching behavior in ultra-thin films.

Title: Entangled Interlocked Diamond-like (Diamondiynes) Lattices
Authors: C. M. O. Bastos, E. J. A. dos Santos, R. A. F. Alves, Alexandre C. Dias, L. A. Ribeiro Junior, D. S. Galvão
Abstract: Diamondynes, a new class of diamond-like carbon allotropes composed of carbon with sp$^2$/sp$^3$-hybridized carbon networks, exhibit unique structural motifs that have not been previously reported in carbon materials. These architectures feature sublattices that are both interlocked and capable of relative movement. Using ab initio simulations, we have conducted an extensive investigation into the structural and electronic properties of five diamondyne structures. Our results show that diamondiynes are thermodynamically stable and exhibit wide electronic band gaps, from 2.2 eV to 4.0 eV. They are flexible yet highly resistant compared to other diamond-like structures. They have relatively small cohesive energy values, consistent with the fact that one diamondyne structure (2f-unsym) has already been experimentally realized. Our results provide new physical insights into diamond-like carbon networks and suggest promising directions for the development of porous, tunable frameworks with potential applications in energy storage and conversion.

Title: Kardar--Parisi--Zhang universality in optically induced lattices of exciton--polariton condensates
Authors: D. Novokreschenov, V. Neplokh, M. Misko, N. Starkova, T. Cookson, A. Kudlis, A. Nalitov, I. A. Shelykh, A. V. Kavokin, P. Lagoudakis
Abstract: We investigate space-time coherence in one-dimensional lattices of exciton-polariton condensates formed by fully reconfigurable non-resonant optical pumping. Starting from an open-dissipative Gross-Pitaevskii equation with deterministic reservoir kinetics and stochastic condensate noise, we derive a discrete complex-field model that incorporates coherent tunnelling, reservoir-mediated dissipative coupling and gain-saturation non-linearity. Adiabatic elimination of fast density fluctuations reveals a wedge-shaped region in the complex hopping plane where the coarse-grained phase dynamics reduces to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation. By computing high-resolution phase diagrams of the temporal and spatial scaling exponents we pinpoint the boundaries separating the KPZ domain from the Edwards-Wilkinson (EW) regime. Large-scale graphics processing unit (GPU) simulations of chains containing up to $N=2000$ condensates confirm these predictions: inside the wedge the exponents converge to $\beta_{N}=\textbf{0.329}(3)\!\approx\!1/3$ and $\chi_{N}=\textbf{0.504}(4)\!\approx\!1/2$, whereas outside it the dynamics moves away from KPZ and ultimately flows toward the EW fixed point, although finite system size and finite observation time may yield intermediate effective exponents. These results pave the way to the implementation of ultrafast KPZ-simulators based on one-dimensional arrays of exciton-polariton condensates.

Title: Exploring Topological and Localization Phenomena in SSH Chains under Generalized AAH Modulation: A Computational Approach
Authors: Souvik Ghosh, Sayak Roy
Abstract: The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model serves as a canonical example of a one-dimensional topological insulator, yet its behavior under more complex, realistic conditions remains a fertile ground for research. This paper presents a comprehensive computational investigation into generalized SSH models, exploring the interplay between topology, quasi-periodic disorder, non-Hermiticity, and time-dependent driving. Using exact diagonalization and specialized numerical solvers, we map the system's phase space through its spectral properties and localization characteristics, quantified by the Inverse Participation Ratio (IPR). We demonstrate that while the standard SSH model exhibits topologically protected edge states, these are destroyed by a localization transition induced by strong Aubry-André-Harper (AAH) modulation. Further, we employ unsupervised machine learning (PCA) to autonomously classify the system's phases, revealing that strong localization can obscure underlying topological signatures. Extending the model beyond Hermiticity, we uncover the non-Hermitian skin effect, a dramatic localization of all bulk states at a boundary. Finally, we apply a periodic Floquet drive to a topologically trivial chain, successfully engineering a Floquet topological insulator characterized by the emergence of anomalous edge states at the boundaries of the quasi-energy zone. These findings collectively provide a multi-faceted view of the rich phenomena hosted in generalized 1D topological systems.

Title: Theory of bound magnetic polarons in cubic and uniaxial antiferromagnets
Authors: Dawid Bugajewski, Carmine Autieri, Tomasz Dietl
Abstract: Motivated by a recent debate about the origin of remanent magnetization and the corresponding anomalous Hall effect in antiferromagnets and their subclass, altermagnets, a theory of bound magnetic polarons (BMPs) in anisotropic antiferromagnetic semiconductors is developed. The theory describes quantitatively the experimentally observed magnitude of excess magnetization and its dependence on the magnetic field in cubic antiferromagnetic EuTe. In contrast to the cubic case, our theory predicts the presence of magnetization hysteresis below Néel temperature in antiferromagnets with uniaxial anisotropy. We show, employing material parameters implied by experimental and ab initio results, that the magnitudes of remanent magnetization and the coercive field are in accord with recent experimental observations for altermagnetic hexagonal MnTe. While the altermagnets have an intrinsic contribution to the remanent magnetization and the anomalous Hall effect, our theory explains the origin of an extrinsic contribution. Our findings address, therefore, a question about the relative contribution to the remanent magnetization of bound magnetic polarons and weak ferromagnetism driven by the antisymmetric exchange interaction, the latter weakened by the formation of antiferromagnetic domains. Furthermore, we provide the theory of BMP spontaneous spin splitting, which can be probed optically.

Title: Spontaneous emission and Purcell effect: some aspects
Authors: P. P. Abrantes, D. Szilard, C. Farina
Abstract: This chapter, part of the Proceedings of the III International Workshop on Quantum Nonstationary Systems (eds. Alexandre Dodonov and Lucas Chibebe Celeri), held in Brasilia in August 2024, offers a comprehensive overview of spontaneous emission (SE) and the Purcell effect within the broader context of quantum electrodynamics (QED) and vacuum fluctuations. It begins with a historical and theoretical review, tracing the development of classical and quantum electromagnetic theories. The chapter then examines how the SE rate of a quantum emitter is fundamentally influenced by its electromagnetic environment, the so-called Purcell effect, through canonical examples, such as emitters near perfectly conducting plates and inside cavities, as well as more advanced scenarios. Special attention is given to modern strategies for tailoring SE using engineered environments, including plasmonic cloaks, composite media near percolation thresholds, metal-insulator phase transitions, and strain-induced modulation in phosphorene. Analytical techniques, such as mode summation and Green's function formalism, are employed to describe how surrounding materials and boundary conditions affect local field modes and the local density of states. The findings underscore both the theoretical depth and experimental relevance of SE modulation, paving the way for innovations in nano-optics, quantum technologies, and advanced material design.

Title: Going beyond density functional theory accuracy: Leveraging experimental data to refine pre-trained machine learning interatomic potentials
Authors: Shriya Gumber, Lorena Alzate-Vargas, Benjamin T. Nebgen, Arjen van Veelen, Smit Kadvani, Tammie Gibson, Richard Messerly
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are inherently limited by the accuracy of the training data, usually consisting of energies and forces obtained from quantum mechanical calculations, such as density functional theory (DFT). Since DFT itself is based on several approximations, MLIPs may inherit systematic errors that lead to discrepancies with experimental data. In this paper, we use a trajectory re-weighting technique to refine DFT pre-trained MLIPs to match the target experimental Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) spectra. EXAFS spectra are sensitive to the local structural environment around an absorbing atom. Thus, refining an MLIP to improve agreement with experimental EXAFS spectra also improves the MLIP prediction of other structural properties that are not directly involved in the refinement process. We combine this re-weighting technique with transfer learning and a minimal number of training epochs to avoid overfitting to the limited experimental data. The refinement approach demonstrates significant improvement for two MLIPs reported in previous work, one for an established nuclear fuel: uranium dioxide (UO$_2$) and second one for a nuclear fuel candidate: uranium mononitride (UN). We validate the effectiveness of our approach by comparing the results obtained from the original (unrefined) DFT-based MLIP and the EXAFS-refined MLIP across various properties, such as lattice parameters, bulk modulus, heat capacity, point defect energies, elastic constants, phonon dispersion spectra, and diffusion coefficients. An accurate MLIP for nuclear fuels is extremely beneficial as it enables reliable atomistic simulation, which greatly reduces the need for large number of expensive and inherently dangerous experimental nuclear integral tests, traditionally required for the qualification of efficient and resilient fuel candidates.

Title: Statistical mechanics of fluids with hidden degrees of freedom
Authors: Masanari Shimada, Tetsuya J. Kobayashi
Abstract: Although coarse-grained models have been widely used to explain exotic phenomena in complex fluids, such as droplet formation in living cells, these conventional approaches often fail to capture the intricate microscopic degrees of freedom that such fluids inherently possess. In this study, we propose a model that incorporates distinct microscopic degrees of freedom and their interactions, without directly relying on conventional coarse-grained descriptions. By introducing two key assumptions, we show that the system can exhibit equilibrium states characterized by heterogeneous density profiles with finite length scales, resembling those typically associated with non-equilibrium phenomena. These findings highlight the importance of distinguishing between equilibrium states and non-equilibrium steady states in highly complex systems.

Title: Neel order, spin-spiral, and spin liquid ground state in frustrated three dimensional system CaMn2P2: A DFT+U and spin dynamics study
Authors: Bidyut Mallick, Sk. Soyeb Ali, S. K. Panda
Abstract: We investigate the magnetic ground state and phase transitions in the frustrated three-dimensional system CaMn2P2 using first-principles calculations combined with spin-dynamics simulations. Our DFT+U calculations reveal that CaMn2P2 exhibits an indirect gap semiconducting ground state with a localized Mn2+ electronic configuration and negligible spin-orbit coupling effects. The computed exchange interactions show that the magnetic behavior is well described by a isotropic Heisenberg Hamiltonian. In this model, there are two major couplings: the NN interaction J1 couples the two Mn layers along the c-axis and next NN J2 is in the a-b plane where Mn ions form a hexagonal layer structure. Our results show that both J1 and J2 are antiferromagnetic in nature and as a consequence J2 induce frustration owing to the in-plane triangular geometry of the Mn-ions. The J1 is found to promote long-range antiferromagnetic order, while the J2 is responsible for spin canting and disorder. Our spin-wave analysis confirms that the system stabilizes a spin-spiral ground state with a propagation vector q = (1/6 , 1/6, 0) in agreement with neutron diffraction experiments. By tuning the J2/J1 ratio, we construct a phase diagram that reveals a transition from a collinear Neel antiferromagnetic state to different spin-spiral phases, and eventually to a disordered phase at large frustration. Atomistic spin-dynamics simulations capture the temperature evolution of the magnetism and reproduce the experimentally measured magnetic data with good accuracy. Furthermore, for large J2/J1, we identify a low temperature phase with slow spin relaxation and persistent fluctuations, suggesting a spin-liquid like state. Our study provides an understanding of frustration induced magnetism in CaMn2P2 and establishes it as a realization of J1-J2 model in three-dimensional lattice for exploring emergent magnetic phases.

Title: Low and Anisotropic Thermal Conductivity in Mixed-Valent Sn$_2$S$_3$
Authors: Xingang Jiang, Yongheng Li, Weiping Guo, Qi Ren, Gang Tang, Zhong-Zhen Luo, Jiawang Hong
Abstract: Compounds of Sn, such as SnSe and SnS, exhibit novel phonon characteristics and low thermal conductivity, making them emerging star materials in the thermoelectric family. In this work, through the Boltzmann transport equation scheme and the Wigner thermal transport model, quasi-1D mixed-valent Sn$_2$S$_3$ were found to exhibit a low thermal conductivity along c-axis with a weak temperature dependence. The low thermal conductivity is attributed to the anharmonic rattling vibrations of weakly bonded Sn(II) atoms, which are influenced by the coulomb interaction of lone pairs at adjacent Sn(II) atoms. The rattling of Sn(II) induces low-frequency flat optical phonons and avoids crossing behavior. The atomic displacements and mean square displacement (MSD) analysis reveal that Sn(II) atoms exhibit significantly greater and anisotropic displacements compared to Sn(IV) and S, confirming that Sn(II) behaves as a rattler. The results obtained from this work suggest an opportunity to discover low thermal conductivity in mixed-valent compounds.

Title: Topotactic oxidation of Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates reveals new structural family: oxygen-intercalated layered perovskites
Authors: Dan Ferenc Segedin, Jinkwon Kim, Harrison LaBollita, Nicole K. Taylor, Kyeong-Yoon Baek, Suk Hyun Sung, Ari B. Turkiewicz, Grace A. Pan, Abigail Y.

Brooks, Antia S. Botana, Darrell G. Schlom, Julia A. Mundy
Abstract: Layered perovskites such as the Dion-Jacobson, Ruddlesden-Popper, and Aurivillius families host a wide range of correlated electron phenomena, from high-temperature superconductivity to multiferroicity. Here we report a new family of layered perovskites, realized through topotactic oxygen intercalation of La_{n+1}Ni_{n}O_{3n+1} (n=1-4) Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate thin films grown by ozone-assisted molecular-beam epitaxy. Post-growth ozone annealing induces a large c-axis expansion - 17.8% for La_{2}NiO_{4} (n=1) - that monotonically decreases with increasing n. Surface X-ray diffraction coupled with Coherent Bragg Rod Analysis reveals that this structural expansion arises from the intercalation of approximately 0.7 oxygen atoms per formula unit into interstitial sites within the rock salt spacer layers. The resulting structures exhibit a spacer layer composition intermediate between that of the Ruddlesden-Popper and Aurivillius phases, defining a new class of layered perovskites. Oxygen-intercalated nickelates exhibit metallicity and significantly enhanced nickel-oxygen hybridization, a feature linked to high-temperature superconductivity. Our work establishes topotactic oxidation as a powerful synthetic approach to accessing highly oxidized, metastable phases across a broad range of layered oxide systems, offering new platforms to tune properties via spacer-layer chemistry.

Authors: Daniil I. Sarypov, Dmitriy A. Pokhabov, Arthur G. Pogosov, Evgeny Yu. Zhdanov, Andrey A. Shevyrin, Alexander A. Shklyaev, Askhat K. Bakarov
Abstract: Hydrodynamic electron transport in solids, governed by momentum-conserving electron-electron collisions, offers a unique framework to explore collective phenomena. Within this framework, correlated electron motion is modeled as viscous fluid flow, with viscosity serving as the interaction parameter. Advances in electron hydrodynamics remain constrained by two unresolved issues: the questionable existence of perfect boundary slip$\unicode{x2013}$a hallmark of frictionless transport$\unicode{x2013}$in electron fluids, and the lack of quantitative experimental confirmation of the theoretical relation linking the viscosity to electron-electron scattering length. Here, we resolve this through independent measurements of these quantities in the same electron system in GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure. Our experiments provide direct evidence of perfect boundary slip in microscale constrictions$\unicode{x2013}$unprecedented phenomenon for electron liquid that parallels ultrafast water transport in carbon nanotubes. These findings bridge the fields of electron hydrodynamics and nanofluidics, highlighting the transformative potential of hydrodynamic engineering across condensed matter and fluidic technologies.

Title: GEARS H: Accurate machine-learned Hamiltonians for next-generation device-scale modeling
Authors: Anubhab Haldar, Ali K. Hamze, Nikhil Sivadas, Yongwoo Shin
Abstract: We introduce GEARS H, a state-of-the-art machine-learning Hamiltonian framework for large-scale electronic structure simulations. Using GEARS H, we present a statistical analysis of the hole concentration induced in defective $\mathrm{WSe}_2$ interfaced with Ni-doped amorphous $\mathrm{HfO}_2$ as a function of the Ni doping rate, system density, and Se vacancy rate in 72 systems ranging from 3326 to 4160 atoms-a quantity and scale of interface electronic structure calculation beyond the reach of conventional density functional theory codes and other machine-learning-based methods. We further demonstrate the versatility of our architecture by training models for a molecular system, 2D materials with and without defects, solid solution crystals, and bulk amorphous systems with covalent and ionic bonds. The mean absolute error of the inferred Hamiltonian matrix elements from the validation set is below 2.4 meV for all of these models. GEARS H outperforms other proposed machine-learning Hamiltonian frameworks, and our results indicate that machine-learning Hamiltonian methods, starting with GEARS H, are now production-ready techniques for DFT-accuracy device-scale simulation.

Title: Nonlinear Néel Spin-Orbit Torque in Centrosymmetric Antiferromagnets
Authors: Jin Cao, Weikang Wu, Huiying Liu, Shen Lai, Cong Xiao, X. C. Xie, Shengyuan A. Yang
Abstract: Electric control of Néel vector is a central task of antiferromagnetic (AFM) spintronics. The major scheme so far relies on the linear Néel torque, which however is restricted to AFMs with broken inversion symmetry. Here, we propose a nonlinear Néel spin-orbit torque, uniquely enabling electric control in the vast class of centrosymmetric AFMs, where the existing scheme fails. Importantly, its intrinsic component, rooted in sublattice-resolved band quantum geometry, offers two additional advantages: It operates also in $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric AFM insulators, where linear torque is forbidden; and it has anti-damping character, making it more efficient in driving magnetic dynamics. Combined with first-principles calculations, we predict large effect in MnRh and MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$, which can be readily detected in experiment. Our work unveils a new fundamental effect, offers a new strategy of electric control in AFM systems beyond the existing paradigm, and opens the door to the field of nonlinear AFM spintronics.

Title: Field-free perpendicular magnetization switching by altermagnet with collinear spin current
Authors: M. Q. Dong, Zhi-Xin Guo, Xin-Gao Gong
Abstract: The generation of collinear spin current (CSC), where both the propagation direction and spin-polarized direction aligned perpendicularly to the applied charge current, is crucial for efficiently manipulating systems with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy used in high-density magnetic recording. However, the efficient generation of CSC remains a challenge. In this work, based on the symmetry analysis, we propose that CSC can be effectively generated using altermagnets when the charge current is aligned along specific directions, due to spin-dependent symmetry breaking. This proposal is supported by density functional theory (DFT) and Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) calculations on a series of altermagnetic materials, including RuO2, Mn5Si3, KRu4O8 and CuF2, where unusually large CSC is produced by the charge current along certain orientations. Furthermore, we introduce a physical quantity, the spin-splitting angle, to quantify the efficiency of CSC generated by the charge current. We find that the spin-splitting angle ranges from 0.24 to 0.57 in these altermagnets, which is significantly larger than the spin-Hall angle typically observed in the anomalous spin-Hall effect, where the spin-Hall angle is generally less than 0.1. Our findings provide an effective method for manipulating spin currents, which is advantageous for the exploration of altermagnetic spintronic devices with field-free perpendicular magnetization switching.

Title: Symmetry Rules on Multipole Interactions under Crystallographic Point Groups and Application to Multiple-$Q$ Multipole States
Authors: Ryota Yambe, Satoru Hayami
Abstract: Multipole degrees of freedom describe the mutual interplay among the charge, spin, and orbital degrees of freedom in electrons, which provides a microscopic understanding of unconventional electronic orderings and their associated physical phenomena. We here show the symmetry rules on multipole interactions under crystallographic point groups in a systematic manner. Depending on the bond symmetries, we show the necessary symmetry conditions of the antisymmetric multipole interactions, which correspond to the extension of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, as well as the symmetric ones, which correspond to the extension of the compasslike interaction. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the symmetry-allowed multipole interactions can become a source of exotic multiple-$Q$ multipole orderings. As a specific example, we analyze the effective model with the antisymmetric quadrupole interaction on a triangular lattice and show the emergence of the triple-$Q$ quadrupole state. Our results indicate that multipole interactions that often arise from the heavy-fermion, frustrated, and nematic systems can potentially induce further unconventional quantum states of matter.

Title: Poor Man's Majoranon in Two Quantum Dots Dressed by Superconducting Quasi-Excitations
Authors: Zhi-Lei Zhang, Guo-Jian Qiao, C. P. Sun
Abstract: In a hybrid system consisting of two quantum dots (QDs) coupled to a superconductor (SC), zero-bias peaks in the differential conductance spectrum have been reported as potential signatures of Majorana fermions (MFs). However, such signatures typically appear only at specific parameter values of the QDs--so-called `sweet spots'--and are referred to as the Poor Man's Majorana (PMM). To investigate whether these signatures can be conclusively attributed to genuine MFs emerging over a continuous parameter range, we present an alternative approach that microscopically incorporates the superconducting effects into the QDs, rather than simply attribute them into two phenomenological parameters of QDs. This forms the dressed Majorana fermions (DMFs), which can be viewed as superpositions of quasi-excitations from both the QDs and the SC. We show that DMFs can localize at one end of a one-dimensional SC and persist across a continuous parameter range, thereby enhancing the feasibility of experimental detection. Our results provide a more accurate description of the PMM in such hybrid systems and offer practical guidance for observing end-localized PMM modes in continuous one-dimensional SC.

Title: Roadmap for electronic structure, anharmonicity, and electron-phonon calculations in locally disordered inorganic and hybrid halide perovskites
Authors: Marios Zacharias, George Volonakis, Laurent Pedesseau, Claudine Katan, Feliciano Giustino, Jacky Even
Abstract: The role of data in modern materials science becomes more valuable and accurate when effects such as electron-phonon coupling and anharmonicity are included, providing a more realistic representation of finite-temperature material behavior. Furthermore, positional polymorphism, characterized by correlated local atomic disorder usually not reported by standard diffraction techniques, is a critical yet underexplored factor in understanding the electronic structure and transport properties of energy-efficient materials, like halide perovskites. In this manuscript, we present a first-principles methodology for locally disordered (polymorphous) cubic inorganic and hybrid halide perovskites, rooted in the special displacement method, that offers a systematic and alternative approach to molecular dynamics for exploring finite-temperature properties. By enabling a unified and efficient treatment of anharmonic lattice dynamics, electron-phonon coupling, and positional polymorphism, our approach generates essential data to predict temperature-dependent phonon properties, free energies, band gaps, and effective masses. Designed with a high-throughput spirit, this framework has been applied across a range of inorganic and hybrid halide perovskites: CsPbI3, CsPbBr3, CsSnI3, CsPbCl3, MAPbI3, MAPbBr3, MASnI3, MAPbCl3, FAPbI3, FAPbBr3, FASnI3, and FAPbCl3. We provide a comprehensive comparison between theoretical and experimental results and we systematically uncover trends and insights into their electronic and thermal behavior. For all compounds, we demonstrate strong and consistent correlations between local structural disorder, band gap openings, and effective mass enhancements.

Title: Method of analysis of the spectra obtained by microfocused Brillouin light scattering
Authors: Nessrine Benaziz, Thibaut Devolder, Jean-Paul Adam
Abstract: Brillouin Light Scattering is a powerful technique to measure the microwave excitations present in a magnetic system. In microfocused mode, the light is focused on the sample using a microscope objective. This accelerates substantially the measurement but results in mixing the response of all microwave excitations into a single spectrum, such that modeling is required to disentangle the contribution of each spin wave. By assuming that a spectrum collected in microfocused mode can be approximated by the sum of all back-scattering spectra that can be collected by the microscope objective, we develop a simple and direct way of interpreting spectra. The model is compared to experimental data collected on a 50 nm thick CoFeB magnetic film. The model allows the understanding of the influence of the optical properties of a sample, of the dispersion relation of the spin wave eigenexcitations and of their thickness profiles, as well as of their populations onto the magnitudes and the lineshapes of the characteristic features of a spectrum

Title: Time reversal symmetry breaking and s-wave superconductivity in CaPd2Ge2: A $μ$SR study
Authors: V. K. Anand, A. Bhattacharyya, D. T. Adroja, K. Panda, P. K. Biswas, A. D. Hillier, B. Lake
Abstract: ${\rm CaPd_2Ge_2}$ which crystallizes in ${\rm ThCr_2Si_2}$-type body-centered tetragonal structure exhibits superconductivity below the critical temperature $T_{\rm c} = 1.69$~K\@. We have investigated the superconducting gap structure and time reversal symmetry of the ground state in ${\rm CaPd_2Ge_2}$ by means of muon spin relaxation and rotation ($\mu$SR) measurements. Our analysis of $\mu$SR data collected in transverse magnetic field reveals BCS superconductivity with a single-band $s$-wave singlet pairing and an isotropic energy gap having the value $2\Delta(0)/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c} = 3.50(1)$. Further, an increased relaxation rate in zero field $\mu$SR asymmetry spectra below $T_{\rm c} $ provides evidence for the presence of a spontaneous magnetic field in the superconducting state revealing that the time-reversal symmetry is broken in ${\rm CaPd_2Ge_2}$.

Title: Studying all-optical magnetization switching of GdFe by double-pulse laser excitation

Abstract: The tremendous interest in the technology and underlying physics of all-optical switching of magnetization brings up the question of how fast the switching can occur and how high the frequency of writing the data with ultrafast laser pulses can be. To answer this question, we excited a GdFe ferrimagnetic alloy, the magnetization of which can be reversed by single laser pulses, a phenomenon known as toggle switching, by two pulses with a certain time delay in between. Using photoemission electron microscopy and Kerr microscopy for magnetic domain imaging, we explore the effects of varying fluences of the first and second pulse as well as the time delay between the two pulses. Our results show that when the fluence of the first pulse is adjusted just above the threshold of single-pulse switching, a second pulse with about 60% of the fluence of the first pulse, arriving only 3 ps later, switches the magnetization back. This reswitching persists up to about 40 ps pulse separation. We interpret the latter as the time required for the sample to cool down and remagnetize after the first pulse. For shorter time delays below about 2 ps, no re-switching occurs. However, the effect of the two pulses adds up, enabling switching for fluences of both pulses below the threshold for single-pulse switching. Atomistic spin dynamics simulations are used to model the experimental data, successfully confirming our results.

Title: Disentangling Electronic and Ionic Nonlinear Polarization Effects in the THz Kerr Response of LaAlO$_{3}$
Authors: Chao Shen, Maximilian Frenzel, Sebastian F. Maehrlein, Zhanybek Alpichshev
Abstract: Nonlinear responses to intense terahertz (THz) fields provide unique insights into complex dynamics of contemporary material systems. However, the interpretation of the obtained data, in particular, distinguishing genuine ionic oscillations from the instantaneous electronic responses in THz Kerr effect remains challenging. Here, we combine two-dimensional Terahertz Kerr effect (2D-TKE) spectroscopy experiments and their modeling to unravel complex THz-induced temporal oscillations in twinned LaAlO$_3$ crystals at low temperatures. We identify the 1.1 THz mode as $E_g$ Raman phonon, while 0.86 THz and 0.36 THz signals are due to spurious effects resulting from the co- and counter-propagation of THz and optical probe pulses in birefringent twin domains. Furthermore, we determine that the $E_g$ mode is excited via a two-photon process, whereas THz pulse reflections at the sample surface produce a temporal response that can mimic anharmonic phonon coupling. Our findings highlight the importance of propagation effects in nonlinear THz experiments and provide a refined framework for interpreting THz polarization dynamics in birefringent crystals.

Title: Break-up of an active chiral fluid
Authors: Luke Neville, Jens Eggers, Tanniemola B. Liverpool
Abstract: We consider the non-linear dynamics governing the break-up of a two-dimensional strip of active chiral fluid. We observe that the strip thickness goes to zero at the pinch off points as a power law in finite time. Using slender body theory combined with a scaling analysis, we identify a new class of scaling exponents and scaling functions characterizing the speed and shape of break-up in these systems. The scaling analysis is in excellent agreement with direct numerical simulations of the hydrodynamic equations

Title: Optical absorption in hexagonal-diamond Si and Ge nanowires: insights from STEM-EELS experiments and ab initio theory
Authors: Luiz H. G. Tizei, Michele Re Fiorentin, Thomas Dursap, Theodorus M. van den Berg, Marc Túnica, Maurizia Palummo, Mathieu Kociak, Laetitia Vincent, Michele Amato
Abstract: Hexagonal-diamond (2H) group IV nanowires are key for advancing group IV-based lasers, quantum electronics, and photonics. Understanding their dielectric response is crucial for performance optimization, but their optical absorption properties remain unexplored. We present the first comprehensive study of optical absorption in 2H-Si and 2H-Ge nanowires, combining high-resolution STEM, monochromated EELS, and ab initio simulations. The nanowires, grown in situ in a TEM as nanobranches on GaAs stems, show excellent structural quality: single crystalline, strain-free, minimal defects, no substrate contamination, enabling access to intrinsic dielectric response. 2H-Si exhibits enhanced absorption in the visible range compared to cubic Si, with a marked onset above 2.5 eV. 2H-Ge shows absorption near 1 eV but no clear features at the direct bandgap, as predicted by ab initio simulations. A peak around 2 eV in aloof-beam spectra is attributed to a thin 3C-Ge shell. These findings clarify structure-optical response relationships in 2H materials.

Title: On the role of non-linear latent features in bipartite generative neural networks
Authors: Tony Bonnaire, Giovanni Catania, Aurélien Decelle, Beatriz Seoane
Abstract: We investigate the phase diagram and memory retrieval capabilities of bipartite energy-based neural networks, namely Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), as a function of the prior distribution imposed on their hidden units - including binary, multi-state, and ReLU-like activations. Drawing connections to the Hopfield model and employing analytical tools from statistical physics of disordered systems, we explore how the architectural choices and activation functions shape the thermodynamic properties of these models. Our analysis reveals that standard RBMs with binary hidden nodes and extensive connectivity suffer from reduced critical capacity, limiting their effectiveness as associative memories. To address this, we examine several modifications, such as introducing local biases and adopting richer hidden unit priors. These adjustments restore ordered retrieval phases and markedly improve recall performance, even at finite temperatures. Our theoretical findings, supported by finite-size Monte Carlo simulations, highlight the importance of hidden unit design in enhancing the expressive power of RBMs.

Title: On the origin of the E1 electron trap level in GaN and dilute AlxGa1-xN films
Authors: Piotr Kruszewski, Jose Coutinho, Vladimir P. Markevich, Pawel Prystawko, Lijie Sun, Jerzy Plesiewicz, Chris A. Dawe, Matthew P. Halsall, Anthony R. Peaker
Abstract: The results of high-resolution Laplace deep-level transient spectroscopy (L-DLTS) measurements applied to the E1 and FeGa electron traps in dilute AlxGa1-xN films (x = 0.063), grown by metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE) on Ammono-GaN substrates, are presented. It is shown that the electron emission signals associated with the E1 donor and the FeGa acceptor levels split into individual components due to the aluminium fluctuations in the nearest neighbour shells around the E1 and FeGa defects. The splitting patterns observed in the L-DLTS spectra are nearly identical for both signals. Furthermore, the ratios of peak magnitudes determined from the L-DLTS analysis for both the E1 and E3 traps are consistent with calculated probabilities of finding a given number of aluminium atoms in the second nearest neighbour shell around a Ga lattice site in AlxGa1-xN with x = 0.063. These findings provide strong evidence that both the E1 and the FeGa trap states in dilute AlxGa1-xN are related to defects located in the Ga sublattice. To elucidate the origin of the E1 trap in AlxGa1-xN, we have performed a comprehensive scan of possible impurities and defects in GaN and AlxGa1-xN using hybrid density functional calculations of transition levels and their associated shifts upon substitution of Ga neighbour atoms by Al. From analysis of the results, we find that the E1 electron trap in GaN and AlxGa1-xN is most likely related to a donor transition from a carbon or molybdenum impurity atom at the gallium site, respectively.

Title: Equations of state and stability condition of mixed p-spin glass model
Authors: Ali Talebi
Abstract: The Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) is a foundational model for understanding spin glass systems. It is based on the pairwise interaction between each two spins in a fully connected lattice with quenched disordered interactions. The nature of long-range interaction among spins in the (SK) model simplifies the study of this system by eliminating fluctuations. An advanced (SK) model, known as the p-spin model, introduces higher-order interactions that involve the interaction of P spins. This research focuses on the general Hamiltonian of the spin glass model with long-range interaction, referred to as the mixed p-spin glass model, which consists of adding all p-spin interaction terms. This research aims to derive the equation of states for this Hamiltonian, formulate the equation of state within the framework of the first replica symmetry breaking, and determine both the stability condition of the replica symmetric solution and the stability of the replicas belonging to the same group in the first step of replica symmetry breaking.

Title: Light-induced Floquet spin-triplet Cooper pairs in unconventional magnets
Authors: Pei-Hao Fu, Sayan Mondal, Jun-Feng Liu, Jorge Cayao
Abstract: The recently predicted unconventional magnets offer a new ground for exploring the formation of nontrivial spin states due to their inherent nonrelativistic momentum-dependent spin splitting. In this work, we consider unconventional magnets with $d$- and $p$-wave parities and investigate the effect of time-periodic light drives for inducing the formation of spin-triplet phases in the normal and superconducting states. In particular, we consider unconventional magnets without and with conventional superconductivity under linearly and circularly polarized light drives and treat the time-dependent problem within Floquet formalism, which naturally unveils photon processes and Floquet bands determining the emergent phenomena Using Floquet formalism, we reveal multiple spin-degenerate nodes in the Floquet spin density, which can be dissected into single- and double-photon processes, and connected to spin-triplet Cooper pairs. Notably, both odd- and even-frequency spin-triplet pairs can be generated by the interplay between the driving field and the unconventional magnetism. Moreover, the intrinsic spatial asymmetry of the unconventional magnet allows linearly polarized light to control magnetic and polarization directions. By tuning the driving amplitude, frequency, and polarization, Floquet spin density and pairing amplitude can be dynamically controlled, offering promising applications in Floquet engineering spintronic and superconducting devices.

Abstract: Magnetic media with artificial periodic modulation-magnonic crystals (MCs) - enable tunable spin-wave dynamics and band structure engineering. Nanoscaling enhances these capabilities, making magnonic nanocrystals promising for both fundamental studies and applications. Here, we report on the design, fabrication, and characterization of one-dimensional YIG MCs with nanoholes ($d \approx $ 150 nm) spaced $a \approx 1 \mu$m apart. Micro-focused Brillouin light scattering and propagating spin-wave spectroscopy, supported by TetraX and MuMax$^3$ simulations, reveal spin-wave transmission over 5 $\mu$m in the Damon-Eshbach configuration, and the formation of pronounced band gaps with rejection levels up to 26 dB. Detailed analysis of the spin-wave dispersion uncovered complex mode interactions, including two prominent anticrossings at 3.1 and 18.7 rad/$\mu$m, between which the spin-wave energy is predominantly carried by the $n$ = 2 mode, enabling efficient transmission. The results advance the development of functional MCs and open pathways toward 2D magnonic nanoarrays and magnonic RF nanodevices.

Title: A Taylor Series Approximation Model for Characterizing the Output Resistance of a GFET
Authors: Xiomara Ribero-Figueroa, Anibal Pacheco-Sanchez, Tzu-Jung Huang, David Jiménez, Ivan Puchades, Reydezel Torres-Torres
Abstract: The mobility-degradation-based model for the drain-to-source or output resistance of a graphene field-effect-transistor is linearized here using a Taylor series approximation. This simplification is shown to be valid from magnitudes of the gate voltage not significantly higher than the Dirac voltage, and it enables the analytical determination of the transconductance parameter, the voltage related to residual charges, and a bias-independent series resistance of the GFET. Furthermore, a continuous representation of the device's static response is achieved when substituting the extracted parameters into the model, regardless the transfer characteristic symmetry with respect to the Dirac voltage.

Title: Strongly correlated topological surface states in type-II Dirac semimetal NiTe$_{2}$
Authors: Neeraj Bhatt, Asif Ali, Deepali Sharma, Sakshi Bansal, Manasi Mandal, Ravi Prakash Singh, Ravi Shankar Singh
Abstract: Nontrivial topology in type-II Dirac semimetal NiTe$_2$ leading to topologically protected surface states give rise to fascinating phenomena holding great promise for next-generation electronic and spintronic devices. Key parameters $-$ such as lattice parameter, disorder, vacancies, and electron correlation $-$ significantly influence the electronic structure and, subsequently, the physical properties. To resolve the discrepancy between the theoretical description and experimentally observed topological surface states, we comprehensively investigate the electronic structure of NiTe$_2$ using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory. Although the bulk electronic structure is found to be well-described within mean field approaches, an accurate description of topological surface states is obtained only by incorporating surface electronic correlation. We reveal that the strongly correlated surface states forming Dirac-like conical crossing much below Fermi level have hybridized Ni 3$d$ and Te 5$p$ character. These findings underscore the intricate interplay between electron correlation and band topology, broadening our understanding of many-body correlation effects on the topological surface states in quantum materials.

Title: Electric field control of third-order nonlinear Hall effect
Authors: Jiaju Yang, Lujun Wei, Yanghui Li, Lina Chen, Wei Niu, Jiarui Chen, Jun Du, Yong Pu
Abstract: The third-order nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE) serves as a sensitive probe of energy band geometric property, providing a new paradigm for revealing the Berry curvature distribution and topological response of quantum materials. In the Weyl semimetal TaIrTe4, we report for the first time that the sign of the third-order NLHE reverses with decreasing temperature. Through scaling law analysis, we think that the third-order NLHE at high (T > 23 K) and low (T < 23 K) temperatures is dominated by Berry-connection polarizability (BCP) and impurity scattering, respectively. The third-order NLHE response strength can be effectively modulated by an additional applied in-plane constant electric field. At the high temperature region, the BCP reduction induced by the electric field leads to a decrease in the third-order NLHE response strength, while at the low temperature region, the electric field cause both BCP and impurity scattering effects to weaken, resulting in a more significant modulation of the third-order NLHE response strength. At 4 K and an electric field strength of 0.3 kV/cm, the modulated relative response strength could reach up to 65.3%. This work provides a new means to explore the third-order NLHE and a valuable reference for the development of novel electronic devices.

Title: Above 20K conventional superconductivity in Cerium
Authors: Mohd Monish, Nikhlesh S Mehta, Mona Garg, Goutam Sheet (Department of Physical Sciences, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Mohali)
Abstract: A high superconducting critical temperature (Tc) under normal laboratory conditions in a material that is chemically simple and stable, like an elemental metal, is a hitherto unattained goal of modern science and technology. Certain elemental metals are known to display reasonably high Tc only under extraordinarily high pressures where their spectroscopic characterization and application are tightly restricted. Here we show that a Tc exceeding 20 K can be realized on pure elemental Ce under uniaxial pressure created simply by pressing a sharp metallic needle on the metal. This is a breakthrough because pure Ce does not superconduct under ambient conditions and the application of 54 GPa of hydrostatic pressure yields only a low Tc of 1.8 K in the metal. In addition, by driving the area under the needle in a mechanically controlled way to the ballistic transport regime, for the first time, we spectroscopically characterized the superconducting energy gap in a high-pressure superconducting phase and found that superconducting Ce respects the conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Shrieffer (BCS) theory.

Title: Ultrafast non-volatile rewritable ferroaxial switching
Authors: Z. Zeng, M. Först, M. Fechner, D. Prabhakaran, P. G. Radaelli, A. Cavalleri
Abstract: Ultrafast switching of ferroic phases is an important research frontier, with significant technological potential. Yet, current efforts are meeting some key challenges, ranging from limited speeds in ferromagnets to intrinsic volatility of switched domains due to uncompensated depolarizing fields in ferroelectrics. Unlike these ferroic systems, ferroaxial materials host bistable states that do not break spatial-inversion or time-reversal symmetry, and are therefore immune to depolarizing fields. Yet, they are difficult to manipulate because external axial fields are not easily constructed with conventional methods. Here, we demonstrate ultrafast switching of ferroaxial order by engineering an effective axial field made up of circularly driven terahertz phonon modes. A switched ferroaxial domain remains stable for many hours and can be reversed back with a second terahertz pulse of opposite helicity. The effects demonstrated here may lead to a new platform for ultrafast information storage.

Title: Quantum magnetotransport in monolayer $\mathrm{Pt_{2}HgSe_{3}}$
Authors: Muzamil Shah, Imtiaz Khan, Kashif Sabeeh, Muhammad Sabieh Anwar, Reza Asgari
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework to investigate quantum magnetotransport in monolayer jacutingaite, focusing on its response to external electric fields and off-resonant circularly polarized laser irradiation. Our analysis reveals a sequence of topological phase transitions triggered by tuning these external parameters. We find that the zeroth LL exhibits spin- and valley-polarized splitting, leading to four distinct peaks in the DOSs for the $K$ and $K'$ valleys. Using the Kubo formalism, we calculate both longitudinal and Hall magneto-optical conductivities based on the Kane-Mele model. Our results demonstrate that external electric, magnetic, and off-resonant optical fields can control these conductivities. These findings highlight monolayer jacutingaite as a highly tunable platform with strong potential for future applications in photonics, optoelectronics, and topological quantum devices.

Title: Construction of Kondo Chains by Engineering Porphyrin π-Radicals on Au(111)

Abstract: Quantum manipulation of molecular radical spins provides a crucial platform for exploring emergent phenomena in many-body systems. Here, we combine surface-confined synthesis with scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) tip-induced dehydrogenation to achieve atom-precise engineering of quasi-one-dimensional porphyrin-based Kondo chains (1-7 units) on Au(111). Key design innovations leverage large-sized porphyrins to suppress intrachain antiferromagnetic coupling, while ${Zn}^{2+}$ chelation at porphyrin cores enhances molecule-substrate interactions to amplify Kondo effect. High-resolution STS measurements and low-energy effective modeling collectively demonstrate that ${\pi}$-radicals at each fused-porphyrin unit form Kondo singlets screened by conduction electrons. Adjacent singlets develop direct coherent coupling via quantum-state-overlap-enabled electron tunneling. Crucially, chiral symmetry in the effective model governs zero-mode distribution-present in odd-length chains yet absent in even-length chains-which dictates pronounced odd-even quantum effects in STS spectra of finite chains. Furthermore, geometric control emerges through conformational distortions modulated by chain fusion width. This enables directional tuning of the competition between Kondo screening and magnetic exchange. Tilted single/fused-triple-porphyrin chains weaken spin exchange through enhanced Kondo coupling, while parallel fused-double-porphyrin chains suppress Kondo screening via increased spin exchange. This opposing modulation of Kondo versus exchange interactions establishes an inverse control paradigm. This work simultaneously resolves the dimensional dependence of many-body correlations in confined quantum systems and pioneers approaches for quantum-critical manipulation in molecular spin architectures.

Title: Learning Chaotic Dynamics with Neuromorphic Network Dynamics
Authors: Yinhao Xu, Georg A. Gottwald, Zdenka Kuncic
Abstract: This study investigates how dynamical systems may be learned and modelled with a neuromorphic network which is itself a dynamical system. The neuromorphic network used in this study is based on a complex electrical circuit comprised of memristive elements that produce neuro-synaptic nonlinear responses to input electrical signals. To determine how computation may be performed using the physics of the underlying system, the neuromorphic network was simulated and evaluated on autonomous prediction of a multivariate chaotic time series, implemented with a reservoir computing framework. Through manipulating only input electrodes and voltages, optimal nonlinear dynamical responses were found when input voltages maximise the number of memristive components whose internal dynamics explore the entire dynamical range of the memristor model. Increasing the network coverage with the input electrodes was found to suppress other nonlinear responses that are less conducive to learning. These results provide valuable insights into how a practical neuromorphic network device can be optimised for learning complex dynamical systems using only external control parameters.

Title: Dirac edge states of two-dimensional altermagnetic topological crystalline insulators
Authors: Raghottam M. Sattigeri, Xujia Gong, Amar Fakhredine, Carmine Autieri, Giuseppe Cuono
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) metallic altermagnets present exciting opportunities for both fundamental research and practical innovations. Their ability to enhance tunneling magnetoresistance in magnetic tunnel junctions, combined with the direct control of spin currents via electric fields, makes them highly promising for spintronic devices. Moreover, the rich electronic structure of altermagnets can host nontrivial topological phases. In particular, topological crystalline insulators are compounds where the topological states are protected by both crystalline and time-reversal symmetries. Furthermore, manipulating the state of a system between topological and trivial phases through external parameters unlocks new possibilities for quantum materials and advanced electronics. We show the edge states of a 2D altermagnetic topological crystalline insulator, using as a representative example Cr$_2$BAl, a 2D MBene metallic altermagnet with a d$_{x^2-y^2}$ altermagnetic ordering. We find that the system can host an altermagnetic phase with extremely large ``weak ferrimagnetism" which is sizeable also with light atoms, only with an in-plane component of the Néel vector. The electronic structure of Cr$_2$BAl presents multiple crossings and anti-crossings in the vicinity of the Fermi level along [100] and [010] directions. When the spin-orbit coupling interaction is included, with the Néel vector along [001] direction, energy gaps open at the band crossing points, resulting in a pronounced peak in the spin Hall conductivity. The simulated Cr-B terminated [100] edge-projected band structure reveals Dirac dispersions at the bulk crossings and anti-crossings, which are absent in Cr-Al terminations.

Title: Deterministic Switching of the Néel Vector by Asymmetric Spin Torque
Authors: Shui-Sen Zhang, Zi-An Wang, Bo Li, Wen-Jian Lu, Mingliang Tian, Yu-Ping Sun, Haifeng Du, Ding-Fu Shao
Abstract: Néel vector, the order parameter of collinear antiferromagnets, serves as a state variable in associated antiferromagnetic (AFM) spintronic devices to encode information. A deterministic switching of Néel vector is crucial for the write-in operation, which, however, remains a challenging problem in AFM spintronics. Here we demonstrate, based on analytical derivation and macro-spin simulations, that Néel vector switching can be generally achieved via a current-induced spin torque, provided the spin accumulations responsible for this torque are non-identical between opposite sublattices. This condition occurs widely in AFM films, as symmetry equivalence between sublattice-dependent spin accumulations is usually absent, allowing unequal spin accumulations induced by Edelstein effect or a spin current. The consequent asymmetric spin torque leads to Néel vector dynamics fundamentally different from previous expectations. The switching conditions derived analytically agree well with simulation results and suggest various directions for further optimization. Our work establishes a general mechanism for current-induced Néel vector switching, which is in principle feasible for all collinear antiferromagnets, and thus paves the route to realize efficient writing in antiferromagnetic spintronics.

Title: From stripes to hexagons: strain-induced 2D Pb phases confined between graphene and SiC
Authors: Markus Gruschwitz, Sergii Sologub, Chitran Ghosal, Zamin Mamiyev, Yuran Niu, Alexei Zakharov, Christoph Tegenkamp
Abstract: The intercalation of metals beneath graphene offers a powerful route to stabilizing and protecting novel two-dimensional (2D) phases. The epitaxial growth of Pb monolayers on SiC(0001), combined with the relatively large spacing of the suspended graphene, makes this system particularly distinctive. Using low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) and various microscopy techniques -- including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and low-energy electron microscopy (LEEM) -- we have investigated the intercalation process across multiple length scales. Our analysis reveals the formation of different 2D Pb monolayer phases, such as stripes and hexagons, which emerge due to the interplay between substrate pinning and strain within the Pb layer, depending on local coverage. These findings provide new insights into the strain-driven stabilization of intercalated metal layers and highlight the potential of graphene as a versatile platform for engineering low-dimensional materials.

Title: Comment on "Electric conductivity of graphene: Kubo model versus a nonlocal quantum field theory model (arXiv:2403.02279v3)"
Authors: M.Bordag, N.Khusnutdinov, G.L.Klimchitskaya, V.M.Mostepanenko
Abstract: Recently, Rodriguez-Lopez, Wang, and Antezza [arXiv:2403.02279v3; Phys. Rev. B v.111, 115428 (2025)] compared the theoretical descriptions of electric conductivity of graphene given by the Kubo model and quantum field theory in terms of the polarizationtensor. According to these authors, in the spatially nonlocal case, the quantum field theoretical description contains ``hard inconsistencies". To bring the predictions of quantum field theory in agreement with those following from the Kubo model, the modified expression was used which relates the conductivity and the polarization tensor. Here, it is shown that this modification violates the the requirement of gauge invariance and, thus, is unacceptable. By comparing both theoretical approaches, we demonstrate that all the results obtained within quantum field theory are physically well justified whereas an application of the modified expression for the conductivity of graphene leads to the consequences of nonphysical character.

Title: Surface Nematic Quasi-Uniformity
Authors: Andrea Pedrini, Epifanio G. Virga
Abstract: Line fields on surfaces are a means to describe the nematic order that may pattern them. The least distorted nematic fields are called uniform, but they can only exist on surfaces with negative constant Gaussian curvature. To identify the least distorted nematic fields on a generic surface, we relax the notion of uniformity into that of quasi-uniformity and prove that all such fields are parallel transported (in Levi-Civita's sense) by the geodesics of the surface. Both global and local constructions of quasi-uniform fields are presented to illustrate both richness and significance of the proposed notion.

Title: Generalized Modulated Symmetries in $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Topological Ordered Phases
Authors: Gustavo M. Yoshitome, Heitor Casasola, Rodrigo Corso, Pedro R. S. Gomes
Abstract: We study $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological ordered phases in 2+1 dimensions characterized by generalized modulated symmetries. Such phases have explicit realizations in terms of fixed-point Hamiltonians involving commuting projectors with support $h=3,5,7,\ldots$ in the horizontal direction, which dictates the modulation of the generalized symmetries. These symmetries are sensitive to the lattice sizes. For certain sizes, they are spontaneously broken and the ground state is degenerated, while for the remaining ones, the symmetries are explicitly broken and the ground state is unique. The ground state dependence on the lattice sizes is a manifestation of the ultraviolet/infrared (UV/IR) mixing. The structure of the modulated symmetries implies that the anyons can move only in rigid steps of size $h$, leading to the notion of position-dependent anyons. The phases exhibit rich boundary physics with a variety of gapped phases, including trivial, partial and total symmetry-breaking, and SPT phases. Effective field theory descriptions are discussed, making transparent the relation between the generalized modulated symmetries and the restrictions on anyon mobility, incorporating the boundary physics in a natural way, and showing how the short-distance details can be incorporated into the continuum by means of twisted boundary conditions.

Title: Automated All-RF Tuning for Spin Qubit Readout and Control
Authors: Cornelius Carlsson, Jaime Saez-Mollejo, Federico Fedele, Stefano Calcaterra, Daniel Chrastina, Giovanni Isella, Georgios Katsaros, Natalia Ares
Abstract: Efficient tuning of spin qubits remains a major bottleneck in scaling semiconductor quantum dot-based quantum processors. A key challenge is the rapid identification of gate voltage regimes suitable for qubit initialisation, control, and readout. Here, we leverage radio-frequency charge sensing to automate spin qubit tuning, achieving a median tuning time of approximately 15 minutes. In a single continuous run, our routine identifies spin qubits at 12 distinct charge transitions in under 17 hours. Beyond tuning, our routine autonomously acquires data revealing the gate-voltage dependence of the exchange interaction, dephasing time, and quality factor -- quantities that vary substantially between charge configurations. These results represent a step change in high-throughput spin qubit tuning and provide a foundation for a systematic and automated exploration of semiconductor quantum circuits.

Title: Failure modes of irregular ceramic foam under compression: Development of a new image based strut segmentation strategy
Authors: Vinit Vijay Deshpande, Romana Piat
Abstract: The work investigates the failure modes of the microstructure of an irregular ceramic foam subjected to uniaxial compression loading. The foam material is manufactured using the direct foaming method and has polydispersed pores homogeneously distributed in the microstructure. The effective stress-strain curve and the macroscopic strength of the material differs significantly with the predictions of the Gibson-Ashby model that assumes a regular microstructure. The objective of this work is to determine the reasons. The work builds upon an image segmentation algorithm that utilizes a skeletonization method followed by geometric pruning strategies to isolate the struts in the foam microstructure. In this work, a novel pruning strategy defined by a physics-based significance measure is proposed, which identifies the struts whose failure leads to macroscopic failure of the material. The stresses in the struts are calculated by a finite element simulation, which is then utilized to determine their failure modes. This also reveals the relationship between the strut orientation and their failure this http URL energy dissipated by the individual failure modes as the loading is increased shows that there are two dominant modes which are different from the bending failure reported in the Gibson-Ashby model. These failure modes are mixed compression-tension and pure compression.

Title: Photonic chiral bulk transports manipulated by boundary freedom in three-dimensional meta-crystals
Authors: Yingxin Qi, Hanyu Wang, Qinghua Guo, Zhihong Zhu, Biao Yang
Abstract: In topological physics, one of the most intriguing phenomena is the presence of topological boundary states, accurately predicted by the well-established bulk-edge correspondence. For example, in three-dimensional Weyl semimetals, Fermi arcs emerge to connect projected Weyl points on the surface due to inheriting the bulk-edge correspondence from the integer quantum Hall effect. However, limited attention has been paid to exploring the reverse mechanism in topological crystals. In this study, we propose that boundaries can serve as an alternative degree of freedom to manipulate topological bulk transports. We analytically and experimentally validate our concept using a finite-thickness photonic meta-crystal that supports bulk nodal lines, with its zeroth modes exhibiting opposite chiral bulk transports under different boundary conditions. Notably, the mirror symmetry remains preserved across both configurations. These findings are applicable to other topological systems, providing new insights into systems with varied boundary conditions and offering the potential for the design of more compact and spatially efficient topological photonic devices.

Title: Prediction and control of geometry-induced nematic order in growing multicellular systems
Authors: Lukas Hupe, Jonas Isensee, Ramin Golestanian, Philip Bittihn
Abstract: In densely-packed two-dimensional systems of growing cells, such as rod-shaped bacteria, a number of experimental and numerical studies report distinct patterns of nematic orientational order in the presence of confinement. So far, these effects have been explained using variations of growing active nematic continuum theories, which incorporate feedback between growth-induced active stresses, the resulting material flow and nematic orientation, and were adapted to the specific geometry under investigation. Here, we first show that a direct, analytical prediction of orientation patterns based on a simple isotropic-growth assumption and the shear rate tensor of the expansion flow already covers previously observed cases. We use this method to tune orientation patterns and net topological defect charge in a systematic way using domain geometry, confirmed by agent-based simulations. We then show how this framework can be extended to quantitatively capture alignment strength, and explore its potential for cross-prediction across different geometries. Our simplified and unifying theoretical framework highlights the role of domain geometry in shaping nematic order of growing systems, and thereby provides a way to forward-engineer desired orientation patterns.

Title: Intrinsic defects and 4d/5d transition metal defects in Cr$_2$O$_3$: pathways to enhance the Néel temperature
Authors: Xuecong Wang, Sai Mu
Abstract: First-principles calculations are employed to explore avenues to increase the Néel temperature ($T_{\mathrm{N}}$) of the magnetoelectric antiferromagnet Cr$_2$O$_3$ through doping. Employing the hybrid functional method, we calculate the formation energy of intrinsic defects and transition metal dopants (Mo, W, Nb, Ta, Zr, and Hf) to assess their likelihood of formation. Intrinsic defect calculations indicate that Cr interstitials and oxygen vacancies dominate under Cr-rich conditions, whereas Cr vacancies prevail under O-rich conditions. Notably, under Cr-rich conditions, the Fermi level can be pinned slightly above mid-gap due to the formation of Cr interstitials and oxygen vacancies. To assess the influence of dopant on $T_{\mathrm{N}}$ of Cr$_2$O$_3$, we calculate the enhancement of the exchange energy for the spin on the dopant site or on adjacent Cr site using the supercell method. Our study identifies isovalent Mo and W substitution on Cr site as the most promising candidates to increase Néel temperature due to the impurity-mediated enhanced exchange interaction for half-filled bands. Formation energy calculations indicate that Mo and W substitution on Cr are easier to form under Cr-rich conditions and a Fermi level near or slightly above the midgap renders a desirable neutral Mo and W defect. This is assisted by the formation of intrinsic Cr interstitial and O vacancy under Cr-rich conditions. These findings offer a route to utilize defects for higher $T_{\mathrm{N}}$ and enhanced performance of Cr$_2$O$_3$ in magnetoelectric devices and furnish invaluable insights for directing subsequent experimental endeavors.

Title: Exact zero modes in the interacting Majorana X- and Y-junctions
Authors: Rik Mulder, Bowy M. La Rivière, Natalia Chepiga
Abstract: We report the appearance of exact zero modes in junctions of interacting Majorana wires. We consider two, three and four short Majorana chains coupled to each other at one edge and forming a longer chain with an impurity bond, Y- and X- junctions correspondingly. The exact zero modes emerge as a result of incommensurate short-range correlations resulting from interacting Majorana fermions and manifest themselves as unavoided crossing of energy levels of in-gap states continuously tuned by hopping and interaction strength. For the Y- and X-junctions, we detect four in-gap states that are clearly visible below the bulk excitations. In the X-junction, the energy levels cross pairwise; in the Y-junction, the crossings happen simultaneously in all four levels. We argue that this peculiarity is a result of fractional degrees of freedom localized at the center of junctions with an odd number of arms, which mediate the interaction of the outer edge states. Furthermore, we show that zero modes in multiple-arm junctions can be effectively modeled by a single chain with a strong impurity bond.

Title: Physical properties of $R$Co$_{2}$Al$_{8}$ ($R=$ La, Ce, Pr, Nd and Sm) single crystals: an emerging structure-type for anisotropic Kondo lattice studies
Authors: Fernando A. Garcia, Sushma Kumari, Juan Schmidt, Cris Adriano, Aashish Sapkota, Paul C. Canfield, Rebecca Flint, Raquel A. Ribeiro
Abstract: Systematic investigations of rare-earth ($R$) based intermetallic materials is a leading strategy to reveal the underlying mechanisms governing a range of physical phenomena, such as the formation of a Kondo lattice and competing electronic and magnetic anisotropies. In this work, the magnetic, thermal and transport properties of $R$Co$_{2}$Al$_{8}$ ($R=$ La, Ce, Pr, Nd and Sm) single crystals are presented. LaCo$_{2}$Al$_{8}$ is characterized as a Pauli paramagnet and transport measurements, with the current along and perpendicular to the orthorhombic $c$-axis ($\rho_{c}$ and $\rho_{ab}$, respectively), reveal a clear electronic anisotropy, with $\rho_{ab }\approx(4-7)\rho_{c }$ at $300$ K. We show that CeCo$_{2}$Al$_{8}$ is a Kondo-lattice for which the Kondo coherence temperature $T_{\text{K}}^{*}$, deduced from broad maximums in $\rho_{c}$ and $\rho_{ab}$ at $\approx$ 68 and 46 K, respectively, is also anisotropic. This finding is related to a possible underlying anisotropy of the Kondo coupling in CeCo$_{2}$Al$_{8}$. The Pr and Nd-based materials present strong easy-axis anisotropy ($c$-axis) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) orders below $T=4.84$ K and $T=8.1$ K, respectively. Metamagnetic transitions from this AFM to a spin-polarized paramagnetic phase state are investigated by isothermal magnetization measurements. The Sm-based compound is also an easy-axis AFM with a transition at $T=21.6$ K.

Title: Physics-informed Machine Learning Analysis for Nanoscale Grain Mapping by Synchrotron Laue Microdiffraction
Authors: Ka Hung Chan, Xinyue Huang, Nobumichi Tamura, Xian Chen
Abstract: Understanding the grain morphology, orientation distribution, and crystal structure of nanocrystals is essential for optimizing the mechanical and physical properties of functional materials. Synchrotron X-ray Laue microdiffraction is a powerful technique for characterizing crystal structures and orientation mapping using focused X-rays. However, when grain sizes are smaller than the beam size, mixed peaks in the Laue pattern from neighboring grains limit the resolution of grain morphology mapping. We propose a physics-informed machine learning (PIML) approach that combines a CNN feature extractor with a physics-informed filtering algorithm to overcome the spatial resolution limits of X-rays, achieving nanoscale resolution for grain mapping. Our PIML method successfully resolves the grain size, orientation distribution, and morphology of Au nanocrystals through synchrotron microdiffraction scans, showing good agreement with electron backscatter diffraction results. This PIML-assisted synchrotron microdiffraction analysis can be generalized to other diffraction-based probes, enabling the characterization of nanosized structures with micron-sized probes.

Title: From Fractionalization to Chiral Topological Superconductivity in Flat Chern Band
Authors: Daniele Guerci, Ahmed Abouelkomsan, Liang Fu
Abstract: We show that interacting electrons in a flat Chern band can form, in addition to fractional Chern insulators, a chiral $f$-wave topological superconductor that hosts neutral Majorana fermion edge modes. Superconductivity emerges from an interaction-induced metallic state that exhibits anomalous Hall effect, as observed in rhombohedral graphene and near the $\nu=\frac{2}{3}$ fractional Chern insulator in twisted transition metal dichalcogenides.

Title: Coupled reaction and diffusion governing interface evolution in solid-state batteries
Authors: Jingxuan Ding, Laura Zichi, Matteo Carli, Menghang Wang, Albert Musaelian, Yu Xie, Boris Kozinsky
Abstract: Understanding and controlling the atomistic-level reactions governing the formation of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) is crucial for the viability of next-generation solid state batteries. However, challenges persist due to difficulties in experimentally characterizing buried interfaces and limits in simulation speed and accuracy. We conduct large-scale explicit reactive simulations with quantum accuracy for a symmetric battery cell, {\symcell}, enabled by active learning and deep equivariant neural network interatomic potentials. To automatically characterize the coupled reactions and interdiffusion at the interface, we formulate and use unsupervised classification techniques based on clustering in the space of local atomic environments. Our analysis reveals the formation of a previously unreported crystalline disordered phase, Li$_2$S$_{0.72}$P$_{0.14}$Cl$_{0.14}$, in the SEI, that evaded previous predictions based purely on thermodynamics, underscoring the importance of explicit modeling of full reaction and transport kinetics. Our simulations agree with and explain experimental observations of the SEI formations and elucidate the Li creep mechanisms, critical to dendrite initiation, characterized by significant Li motion along the interface. Our approach is to crease a digital twin from first principles, without adjustable parameters fitted to experiment. As such, it offers capabilities to gain insights into atomistic dynamics governing complex heterogeneous processes in solid-state synthesis and electrochemistry.

Title: Apparent inconsistency between Streda formula and Hall conductivity in reentrant integer quantum anomalous Hall effect in twisted MoTe$_2$
Authors: Yi Huang, Seth Musser, Jihang Zhu, Yang-Zhi Chou, Sankar Das Sarma
Abstract: Recent experiments in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ (tMoTe$_2$) have uncovered a rich landscape of correlated phases. In this work, we investigate the reentrant integer quantum anomalous Hall (RIQAH) states reported in F. Xu, et. al., arXiv:2504.06972 which displays a notable mismatch between the Hall conductivity measured via transport and that inferred from the Streda formula. We argue that this discrepancy can be explained if the RIQAH state is a quantum Hall bubble phase, analogous to similar well-established phenomena in 2D GaAs quantum wells. While this explains the RIQAH state at a filling $\nu = -0.63$, the other RIQAH state at $\nu = -0.7$ has a smaller slope necessitating a different interpretation. We propose that this discrepancy arises due to a nearby resistive peak masking the true slope. Furthermore, we identify this resistive peak as a signature of a magnetic phase transition near $\nu = -0.75$, possibly driven by a Van Hove singularity. The anomalous Hall response and Landau fan evolution across this transition suggest a change in Fermi surface topology and a phase with zero Chern number, potentially corresponding to an inter-valley coherent state. These observations offer new insights into the nature of the RIQAH states and raise the possibility that the nearby superconducting phase may have an inter-valley coherent normal state.

Title: FerroAI: A Deep Learning Model for Predicting Phase Diagrams of Ferroelectric Materials
Authors: Chenbo Zhang, Xian Chen
Abstract: Composition-temperature phase diagrams are crucial for designing ferroelectric materials, however predicting them accurately remains challenging due to limited phase transformation data and the constraints of conventional methods. Here, we utilize natural language processing (NLP) to text-mine 41,597 research articles, compiling a dataset of 2,838 phase transformations across 846 ferroelectric materials. Leveraging this dataset, we develop FerroAI, a deep learning model for phase diagram prediction. FerroAI successfully predicts phase boundaries and transformations among different crystal symmetries in Ce/Zr co-doped BaTiO$3$ (BT)-$x$Ba${0.7}$Ca$_{0.3}$TiO$_3$ (BCT). It also identifies a morphotropic phase boundary in Zr/Hf co-doped BT-$x$BCT at $x = 0.3$, guiding the discovery of a new ferroelectric material with an experimentally measured dielectric constant of 9535. These results establish FerroAI as a powerful tool for phase diagram construction, guiding the design of high-performance ferroelectric materials.

Title: Consciousness via MIPT?
Authors: Alexander Gorsky
Abstract: The measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT) is a recently formulated phenomenon in out-of-equilibrium systems. The competition between unitary evolutions and measurement-induced non-unitaries leads to the transition between the entangled and disentangled phases at some critical measurement rate. We conjecture that self-organized MIPT plays a key role in the generative model of cognitive networks and the formation of the state of consciousness in the "newborn-adult" transition. To this aim, we formulate the probe-target picture for the brain and suggest that MIPT interpreted as learnability transition takes place in the mental part of the target where the sites in the cognitive networks of semantic memory are concepts. Comparison with the synchronization phase transitions in the probe is made.

Title: Negative moment of inertia of large-$N_c$ gluons on a ring
Authors: Maxim Chernodub
Abstract: We study SU($N_c$) Yang-Mills theory in $1+1$ dimensions at finite temperature on a spatial ring that rotates uniformly in a plane. We show that the effect of rotation results only in a simple kinematic enhancement of the gauge coupling $g$, which becomes rescaled by a Lorentz factor corresponding to the tangential rotational velocity of the ring. Using well-established analytic results in Yang-Mills theory in the 't Hooft limit of an infinite number of colors, we demonstrate that the moment of inertia of the large-$N_c$ gluon plasma on the ring is negative. This counterintuitive conclusion is, however, in agreement with recent first-principle numerical simulations of hot $3+1$ dimensional SU(3) Yang-Mills theory that also reported a negative moment of inertia for gluon plasma in an experimentally relevant window of temperatures above the deconfinement transition. Furthermore, we argue that our picture provides a qualitative explanation for three other intriguing features observed in lattice simulations of vortical QCD: the emergence of a spatially inhomogeneous mixed phase, the inconsistency of its spatial structure with a standard picture dictated by the Tolman-Ehrenfest law, and the enhancement of the critical deconfining temperature by rotation.

Title: Universality of stochastic control of quantum chaos with measurement and feedback
Authors: Andrew A. Allocca, Devesh K. Verma, Sriram Ganeshan, Justin H. Wilson
Abstract: We investigate quantum dynamics in the vicinity of an unstable fixed point subjected to stochastic control. The stochastic competition between the system's inherent instability (pushing trajectories away) and engineered control dynamics (drawing them back to the same point) forms the core of probabilistic control in chaotic systems. Recent studies reveal that this interplay underlies a family of measurement- and feedback-driven dynamical quantum phase transitions. To capture its universal features, we consider the inverted harmonic oscillator, a canonical model whose operator amplitudes diverge. Our control scheme, a quantum version of classical attractor dynamics, employs non-unitary evolution via measurements and conditional resets. By combining numerical simulations, a semiclassical Fokker-Planck analysis, and direct spectra of the quantum channel, we map out the control transition and uncover quantum-specific signatures of the underlying dynamics. We demonstrate the universality of our results within the quantum Arnold cat map, a paradigmatic model of quantum chaos.

Title: Large-charge Rényi entropy
Authors: Masataka Watanabe
Abstract: The charged (symmetry-resolved) vacuum Rényi entanglement entropy on a disk is computed in the limit of large U(1) global charge for any Rényi index. We show that it behaves universally for a broad class of conformal field theories including the O(2) Wilson-Fisher fixed-point, by using the effective field theory at large global charge. The result establishes one of the first concrete computations of entanglement quantities in strongly-coupled field theories.

Title: Laser Stabilised Ionising Transitions
Authors: Erika Cortese, Simone De Liberato
Abstract: We investigate a ionising electronic transition under resonant pumping. We demonstrate that, above a critical value of the pump intensity, a novel metastable electronic bound state is created, which can decay into the free electron continuum by two-photon ionization. We calculate the system's resonant fluorescence spectrum, finding results qualitatively different from the Mollow triplet expected in a bound-to-bound transition. The fluorescent emission can be used to measure the time-resolved population of the novel metastable state. Contrary to Kramers-Hennenberger atoms, stabilised by non-perturbative, non-resonant laser pulses, the physics we observe is inherently resonant and relies on perturbative level repulsion. In analogy to how the AC-Stark shift is a semiclassical version of the single-photon Rabi splitting observed in photonic cavity, the phenomenon we describe is better understood as a semiclassical version of recently observed excitons bound by a single cavity photon. Our results demonstrate a novel way to stabilise electronic states with intense laser fields, increasing our capability to design and engineer non-classical states of matter.

Abstract: Quantum observables in the form of few-point correlators are the key to characterizing the dynamics of quantum many-body systems. In dynamics with fast entanglement generation, quantum observables generally become insensitive to the details of the underlying dynamics at long times due to the effects of scrambling. In experimental systems, repeated time-reversal protocols have been successfully implemented to restore sensitivities of quantum observables. Using a 103-qubit superconducting quantum processor, we characterize ergodic dynamics using the second-order out-of-time-order correlators, OTOC$^{(2)}$. In contrast to dynamics without time reversal, OTOC$^{(2)}$ are observed to remain sensitive to the underlying dynamics at long time scales. Furthermore, by inserting Pauli operators during quantum evolution and randomizing the phases of Pauli strings in the Heisenberg picture, we observe substantial changes in OTOC$^{(2)}$ values. This indicates that OTOC$^{(2)}$ is dominated by constructive interference between Pauli strings that form large loops in configuration space. The observed interference mechanism endows OTOC$^{(2)}$ with a high degree of classical simulation complexity, which culminates in a set of large-scale OTOC$^{(2)}$ measurements exceeding the simulation capacity of known classical algorithms. Further supported by an example of Hamiltonian learning through OTOC$^{(2)}$, our results indicate a viable path to practical quantum advantage.

Title: Tracking and controlling monolayer water in gold nanogaps using extreme plasmonic spectroscopy
Authors: Elle W. Wyatt, Sarah May Sibug-Torres, Rakesh Arul, Marika Niihori, Tabitha Jones, James W. Beattie, Bart de Nijs, Jeremy J. Baumberg
Abstract: Nanogaps are ubiquitous across science, confining molecules and thus changing chemistries which influence many areas such as catalysis, corrosion, photochemistry, and sensing. However in ambient conditions, it is unclear how water solvates nanogaps and even if nominally dry, what water structure persists. Despite its low Raman cross-section, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) enables study of water at coinage metal surfaces. Using multi-layer aggregates of close-packed gold nanoparticles with sub-nanometre gaps precisely defined by organic spacer molecules, we achieve consistent and large SERS enhancements, enabling systematic study of water within these confined spaces. Ostensibly dry facets in air evidence water monolayer coatings, with hydrogen-bonding only reappearing upon immersion in solution. Under negative applied potentials, surface water is seen to re-orient at the metal facets with distinct spectral shifts among the quartet of vibrational peaks which correspond to those expected from water dimers. Comparing nanogaps in deuterated water also reveals how individual water molecules bind onto organic spacer molecules in such nanogaps. Realistic models of water dressing will enable better understanding of catalytic and contact chemistries.

Title: High-Accuracy Dispersion Surfaces Measurement Unlocks Photonic Crystal Slabs Topology
Authors: Karen Caicedo, Fabrizio Sgrignuoli, Adam Schwartzberg, Scott Duehy, Silvia Romano, Gianluigi Zito, Ivo Rendina, Vito Mocella
Abstract: Characterization of dispersion surfaces (DS) in photonic crystals (PhCs) can predict striking topological features, such as bound states in the continuum (BICs). Precise measurement of dispersion, particularly near the {\Gamma}-point, is crucial since even subtle geometric deviations significantly impact the distribution of topological charges and associated polarization singularities. Here, we propose a novel technique to measure DS of PhC slabs with high angular accuracy of up to 3 x 10^(-4) radians, and spectral accuracy of 0.2 nm within an expanded region of the Brillouin zone. Remarkably, our technique is diffraction- and aberration-free as it does not rely on optical imaging but rather on spectral mapping. The analysis of DS presented in this work demonstrates the robustness of our technique, and enables us to distinguish anisotropic BICs along a specific symmetry axis from isotropic states around the {\Gamma}-point. Moreover, the experimental DS obtained supply the information necessary to study and identify super-BICs.

Title: Van der Waals waveguide quantum electrodynamics probed by infrared nano-photoluminescence

Abstract: Atomically layered van der Waals (vdW) materials exhibit remarkable properties, including highly-confined infrared waveguide modes and the capacity for infrared emission in the monolayer limit. Here, we engineered structures that leverage both of these nano-optical functionalities. Specifically, we encased a photoluminescing atomic sheet of MoTe2 within two bulk crystals of WSe2, forming a vdW waveguide for the embedded light-emitting monolayer. The modified electromagnetic environment offered by the WSe2 waveguide alters MoTe2 spontaneous emission, a phenomenon we directly image with our interferometric nano-photoluminescence technique. We captured spatially-oscillating nanoscale patterns prompted by spontaneous emission from MoTe2 into waveguide modes of WSe2 slabs. We quantify the resulting Purcell-enhanced emission rate within the framework of a waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED) model, relating the MoTe2 spontaneous emission rate to the measured waveguide dispersion. Our work marks a significant advance in the implementation of all-vdW QED waveguides.

Title: Coupled Lindblad pseudomode theory for simulating open quantum systems
Authors: Zhen Huang, Gunhee Park, Garnet Kin-Lic Chan, Lin Lin
Abstract: Coupled Lindblad pseudomode theory is a promising approach for simulating non-Markovian quantum dynamics on both classical and quantum platforms, with dynamics that can be realized as a quantum channel. We provide theoretical evidence that the number of coupled pseudomodes only needs to scale as $\mathrm{polylog}(T/\varepsilon)$ in the simulation time $T$ and precision $\varepsilon$. Inspired by the realization problem in control theory, we also develop a robust numerical algorithm for constructing the coupled modes that avoids the non-convex optimization required by existing approaches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by computing population dynamics and absorption spectra for the spin-boson model. This work provides a significant theoretical and computational improvement to the coupled Lindblad framework, which impacts a broad range of applications from classical simulations of quantum impurity problems to quantum simulations on near-term quantum platforms.

Title: Lieb's Theorem for Bose Hubbard Models
Authors: Zhong-Chao Wei, Chong Zhao
Abstract: Using a cone-theoretical method, we prove the uniqueness of the ground state for two Bose Hubbard models. The first model is the usual Bose Hubbard model with real hopping coefficients and attractive interactions. The second model is a two-component Bose Hubbard model. Under certain conditions, we show that the ground state in the subspace with particle number $N=2n$($n$ is a positive integer) is unique for both models. For the second model, we show that the ground state has spin along the z-axis $S^{z}=0$. When the hopping coefficients are real, it has zero spin quantum number, i.e., it is a singlet. Our proofs work equally well for any arbitrary lattice.

Title: Hamiltonian Learning via Inverse Physics-Informed Neural Networks
Authors: Jie Liu, Xin Wang
Abstract: Hamiltonian learning (HL), enabling precise estimation of system parameters and underlying dynamics, plays a critical role in characterizing quantum systems. However, conventional HL methods face challenges in noise robustness and resource efficiency, especially under limited measurements. In this work, we present \textit{Inverse Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Hamiltonian Learning (iPINN-HL)}, an approach that embeds the Schrödinger equation directly into the machine learning procedure. This formulation allows the model to integrate both observational data and known physical laws to infer Hamiltonian parameters with greater accuracy and resource efficiency. We benchmark iPINN-HL against a deep-neural-network-based quantum state tomography method (denoted as DNN-HL) and demonstrate its effectiveness across several different scenarios, including one-dimensional spin chains, cross-resonance gate calibration, crosstalk identification, and real-time compensation to parameter drift. Our results show that iPINN-HL can approach the Heisenberg limit in certain settings and exhibits robustness to noises, while outperforming DNN-HL in accuracy and resource efficiency. Therefore, iPINN-HL is a powerful and flexible framework for quantum system characterization for practical tasks.

Title: Multi-entropy and the Dihedral Measures at Quantum Critical Points
Authors: Jonathan Harper, Ali Mollabashi, Tadashi Takayanagi, Kenya Tasuki
Abstract: The multi-entropy and dihedral measures are a class of tractable measures for multi-partite entanglement, which are labeled by the Rényi index (or replica number) $n$ as in the Rényi entanglement entropy. The purpose of this article is to demonstrate that these quantities are new useful probes of quantum critical points by examining concrete examples. In particular, we compute the multi-entropy and dihedral measures in the $1+1$ dimensional massless free scalar field theory on a lattice and in the transverse-field Ising model. For $n=2$, we find that the numerical results in both lattice theories quantitatively agree with those from conformal field theoretic calculations. For $n=3$ and $n=4$, we provide new predictions of these measures for the massless scalar field theory.

Title: The pursuit of happiness
Authors: Debora Princepe, Onofrio Mazzarisi, Erol Akcay, Simon A. Levin, Matteo Marsili
Abstract: Happiness, in the U.S. Declaration of Independence, was understood quite differently from today's popular notions of personal pleasure. Happiness implies a flourishing life - one of virtue, purpose, and contribution to the common good. This paper studies populations of individuals - that we call homo-felix - who maximise an objective function that we call happiness. The happiness of one individual depends on the payoffs that they receive in games they play with their peers as well as on the happiness of the peers they interact with. Individuals care more or less about others depending on whether that makes them more or less happy. This paper analyses the happiness feedback loops that result from these interactions in simple settings. We find that individuals tend to care more about individuals who are happier than what they would be by being selfish. In simple 2 x 2 game theoretic settings, we show that homo-felix can converge to a variety of equilibria which includes but goes beyond Nash equilibria. In an n-persons public good game we show that the non-cooperative Nash equilibrium is marginally unstable and a single individual who develops prosocial behaviour is able to drive almost the whole population to a cooperative state.

Title: Machine learning accelerated finite-field simulations for electrochemical interfaces
Authors: Chaoqiang Feng, Bin Jiang
Abstract: Electrochemical interfaces are of fundamental importance in electrocatalysis, batteries, and metal corrosion. Finite-field methods are one of most reliable approaches for modeling electrochemical interfaces in complete cells under realistic constant-potential conditions. However, previous finite-field studies have been limited to either expensive ab initio molecular dynamics or less accurate classical descriptions of electrodes and electrolytes. To overcome these limitations, we present a machine learning-based finite-field approach that combines two neural network models: one predicts atomic forces under applied electric fields, while the other describes the corresponding charge response. Both models are trained entirely on first-principles data without employing any classical approximations. As a proof-of-concept demonstration in a prototypical Au(100)/NaCl(aq) system, this approach not only dramatically accelerates fully first-principles finite-field simulations but also successfully extrapolates to cell potentials beyond the training range while accurately predicting key electrochemical properties. Interestingly, we reveal a turnover of both density and orientation distributions of interfacial water molecules at the anode, arising from competing interactions between the positively charged anode and adsorbed Cl$^-$ ions with water molecules as the applied potential increases. This novel computational scheme shows great promise in efficient first-principles modelling of large-scale electrochemical interfaces under potential control.

Title: Hessian Geometry of Latent Space in Generative Models
Authors: Alexander Lobashev, Dmitry Guskov, Maria Larchenko, Mikhail Tamm
Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for analyzing the latent space geometry of generative models, including statistical physics models and diffusion models, by reconstructing the Fisher information metric. The method approximates the posterior distribution of latent variables given generated samples and uses this to learn the log-partition function, which defines the Fisher metric for exponential families. Theoretical convergence guarantees are provided, and the method is validated on the Ising and TASEP models, outperforming existing baselines in reconstructing thermodynamic quantities. Applied to diffusion models, the method reveals a fractal structure of phase transitions in the latent space, characterized by abrupt changes in the Fisher metric. We demonstrate that while geodesic interpolations are approximately linear within individual phases, this linearity breaks down at phase boundaries, where the diffusion model exhibits a divergent Lipschitz constant with respect to the latent space. These findings provide new insights into the complex structure of diffusion model latent spaces and their connection to phenomena like phase transitions.

Title: Universal roughness and the dynamics of urban expansion
Authors: Ulysse Marquis, Oriol Artime, Riccardo Gallotti, Marc Barthelemy
Abstract: We present a new approach to quantity urban sprawl using tools from surface growth physics. Analyzing built-up area expansion in 19 cities (1985-2015), we uncover anisotropic growth with branch-like extensions and a piecewise linear relation between area and population. A universal local roughness exponent $\alpha_{\text{loc}} \approx 0.54$ coexists with variable exponents $\beta$, $z$. As modeling urban sprawl remains an open problem, these results offer a necessary empirical basis for theory.

Title: Kibble-Zurek dynamical scaling hypothesis in the Google analog-digital quantum simulator of the $XX$ model
Authors: Yintai Zhang, Francis A. Bayocboc Jr., Jacek Dziarmaga
Abstract: The state-of-the-art tensor networks are employed to simulate the Hamiltonian ramp in the analog-digital quantum simulation of the quantum phase transition to the quasi-long-range ordered phase of the 2D square-lattice $XX$ model [Nature 638, 79 (2025)]. We focus on the quantum Kibble-Zurek (KZ) mechanism near the quantum critical point. Using the infinite projected entangled pair state (iPEPS), we simulate an infinite lattice and demonstrate the KZ scaling hypothesis for the $XX$ correlations across a wide range of ramp times. We use the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) algorithm to simulate a finite $8\times 8$ lattice, similar to the one in the quantum simulation, and find that adiabatic finite-size effects dominate for longer ramp times, where the correlation length's growth with increasing ramp time saturates and the excitation energy's dependence on the ramp time crosses over to a power-law decay characteristic of adiabatic transitions.

Title: Constructing Quantum Many-Body Scars from Hilbert Space Fragmentation
Authors: Fan Yang, Matteo Magoni, Hannes Pichler
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) are exotic many-body states that exhibit anomalous non-thermal behavior in an otherwise ergodic system. In this work, we demonstrate a simple, scalable and intuitive construction of QMBS in a kinetically constrained quantum model exhibiting weak Hilbert space fragmentation. We show that towers of exact QMBS can be constructed by injecting a quasiparticle excitation that partially activates the frozen regions in the lattice. Meanwhile, the inelastic collision between multiple quasiparticles allows for the construction of approximate scars, whose damping is governed by an emergent two-body loss. Our findings establish direct connections between quantum many-body scarring and Hilbert space fragmentation, paving the way for systematically constructing exact and approximate QMBS. The proposed model can be readily implemented in neutral-atom quantum simulators aided by strong Rydberg interactions.

Title: Analogous supercritical crossovers in black holes and water
Authors: Shoucheng Wang, Xinyang Li, Yuliang Jin, Li Li
Abstract: We investigate the supercritical crossovers for black hole thermodynamics in the supercritical regime beyond the critical point, where small and large black holes are indistinguishable from the conventional viewpoint. We establish a refined supercritical phase diagram that comprehensively characterizes small, large, and indistinguishable black hole phases, whose boundaries are defined by two supercritical crossover lines. The universal scaling laws of the two crossover lines are fully verified using black hole thermodynamics in both the standard consideration and the extended thermodynamic phase space by treating the cosmological constant as a thermodynamic pressure. Remarkable analogies are observed when the supercritical phase diagrams of the two frameworks of black holes are compared to those corresponding to liquid-gas and liquid-liquid phase transitions. The present study can be extended to a variety of more complicated black hole backgrounds and provide valuable insights into the fundamental nature of black hole thermodynamics.

Title: Coherence and Transients in Nonlocally Coupled Dissipative Kicked Rotors
Authors: Jin Yan
Abstract: The dynamics of nonlocally coupled dissipative kicked rotors is rich and complex. In this study, we consider a network of rotors where each interacts equally with a certain range of its neighbors. We focus on the influence of the coupling strength and the coupling range, and show both analytically and numerically the critical transitions in the phase diagram, which include bifurcations of simple spatiotemporal patterns and changes in basin sizes of coherent states with different wavenumbers. We highlight that this diagram is fundamentally different from those found in other coupled systems such as in coupled logistic maps or Lorenz systems. Finally, we show an interesting domain-wall phenomenon in the coupled chaotic rotors, where a super-long transient interface state (partially regular and partially chaotic) is observed and can persist exponentially long as the coupling range increases up to a critical threshold.

Title: Landauer Principle and Thermodynamics of Computation
Authors: Pritam Chattopadhyay, Avijit Misra, Tanmoy Pandit, Goutam Paul
Abstract: According to the Landauer principle, any logically irreversible process accompanies entropy production, which results in heat dissipation in the environment. Erasing of information, one of the primary logically irreversible processes, has a lower bound on heat dissipated into the environment, called the Landauer bound (LB). However, the practical erasure processes dissipate much more heat than the LB. Recently, there have been a few experimental investigations to reach this bound both in the classical and quantum domains. There has also been a spate of activities to enquire about this LB in finite time, with finite-size heat baths, non-Markovian and nonequilibrium environment in the quantum regime where the effects of fluctuations and correlation of the systems with the bath can no longer be ignored. This article provides a comprehensive review of the recent progress on the Landauer bound, which serves as a fundamental principle in the thermodynamics of computation. We also provide a perspective for future endeavors in these directions. Furthermore, we review the recent exploration toward establishing energetic bounds of a computational process. We also review the thermodynamic aspects of error correction, which is an indispensable part of information processing and computations. In doing so, we briefly discuss the basics of these fields to provide a complete picture.

Title: Correlation functions of von Neumann entropy
Authors: Mathew W. Bub, Allic Sivaramakrishnan
Abstract: In this note, we study two-point correlation functions of modular Hamiltonians. We show that in general quantum systems, these correlators obey properties similar to those of von Neumann entropy and capacity of entanglement, both of which are special cases of these correlators. Then we specialize to two spacelike-separated spherical subregions in conformal field theories. We present direct computations of the vacuum two-point function that confirm its equivalence to the stress-tensor conformal block. We explore the two-point function in various kinematic regimes, including imaginary time separation between subsystems. The material presented in this note may be useful for further studying modular Hamiltonian correlators in generic quantum systems and in conformal field theories, including those with holographic duals.

Title: A cavity array microscope for parallel single-atom interfacing
Authors: Adam L. Shaw, Anna Soper, Danial Shadmany, Aishwarya Kumar, Lukas Palm, Da-Yeon Koh, Vassilios Kaxiras, Lavanya Taneja, Matt Jaffe, David I. Schuster, Jonathan Simon
Abstract: Neutral atom arrays and optical cavity QED systems have developed in parallel as central pillars of modern experimental quantum science. While each platform has demonstrated exceptional capabilities-such as high-fidelity quantum logic in atom arrays, and strong light-matter coupling in cavities-their combination holds promise for realizing fast and non-destructive atom measurement, building large-scale quantum networks, and engineering hybrid atom-photon Hamiltonians. However, to date, experiments integrating the two platforms have been limited to interfacing the entire atom array with one global cavity mode, a configuration that constrains addressability, parallelism, and scalability. Here we introduce the cavity array microscope, an experimental platform where each individual atom is strongly coupled to its own individual cavity across a two-dimensional array of over 40 modes. Our approach requires no nanophotonic elements, and instead uses a new free-space cavity geometry with intra-cavity lenses to realize above-unity peak cooperativity with micron-scale mode waists and spacings, compatible with typical atom array length scales while keeping atoms far from dielectric surfaces. We achieve homogeneous atom-cavity coupling, and show fast, non-destructive, parallel readout on millisecond timescales, including cavity-resolved readout into a fiber array as a proof-of-principle for future networking applications. This platform is species-agnostic and scalable, and we expect key metrics to further improve in a next-generation realization anticipated to be compatible with glass-cell-based experiments. Our work unlocks, for the first time, the regime of many-cavity QED, and opens an unexplored frontier of large-scale quantum networking with atom arrays.

Title: Experimental investigation of the flow rate--pressure drop relation of a viscoelastic Boger fluid in a deformable channel
Authors: SungGyu Chun, Ivan C. Christov, Jie Feng
Abstract: We study the steady flow-induced deformation between an incompressible non-Newtonian fluid and a three-dimensional (3D) deformable channel. Specifically, we provide a comprehensive experimental--theoretical framework for such flows of constant-viscosity viscoelastic (i.e., Boger) fluids, which allows us to quantify the influence of the fluid's viscoelasticity on the flow rate--pressure drop ($q-\Delta p$) relation. For a flow-rate-controlled regime and weakly viscoelastic flow, we find excellent agreement between the theoretical prediction and experimental results, specifically providing an experimental demonstration of how both wall compliance and fluid viscoelasticity decrease the pressure drop. To definitively demonstrate the coupled effect of wall compliance and fluid viscoelasticity (change of cross-sectional area and curving of streamlines), we perform experiments in an equivalent rigid channel, showing that both the Boger fluid and a viscosity-matched Newtonian fluid have the same pressure drop. Thus, the experimentally verified theory for the $q-\Delta p$ relation of weakly viscoelastic flows of Boger fluids in compliant channels can now be used for microfluidic system design involving complex fluids.

Title: Large-scale quantization of trace I: Finite propagation operators
Authors: Matthias Ludewig, Guo Chuan Thiang
Abstract: Inspired by parallel developments in coarse geometry in mathematics and exact macroscopic quantization in physics, we present a family of general trace formulae which are universally quantized and depend only on large-scale geometric features of the input data. They generalize, to arbitrary dimensions, formulae found by Roe in his partitioned manifold index theorem, as well as the Kubo and Kitaev formulae for 2D Hall conductance used in physics.

Title: Random site percolation thresholds on square lattice for complex neighborhoods containing sites up to the sixth coordination zone
Authors: Krzysztof Malarz (AGH University of Krakow)
Abstract: The site percolation problem is one of the core topics in statistical physics. Evaluation of the percolation threshold, which separates two phases (sometimes described as conducting and insulating), is useful for a range of problems from core condensed matter to interdisciplinary application of statistical physics in epidemiology or other transportation or connectivity problems. In this paper with Newman--Ziff fast Monte Carlo algorithm and finite-size scaling theory the random site percolation thresholds $p_c$ for a square lattice with complex neighborhoods containing sites from the sixth coordination zone are computed. Complex neighborhoods are those that contain sites from various coordination zones (which are not necessarily compact). We also present the source codes of the appropriate procedures (written in C) to be replaced in original Newman--Ziff code. Similar to results previously found for the honeycomb lattice, the percolation thresholds for complex neighborhoods on a square lattice follow the power law $p_c(\zeta)\propto\zeta^{-\gamma_2}$ with $\gamma_2=0.5454(60)$, where $\zeta=\sum_i z_i r_i$ is the weighted distance of sites in complex neighborhoods ($r_i$ and $z_i$ are the distance from the central site and the number of sites in the coordination zone $i$, respectively).

Title: Anderson Impurities In Edge States with Nonlinear and Dissipative Perturbations
Authors: Vinayak M. Kulkarni, N. S. Vidhyadhiraja
Abstract: We show that exceptional points (EPs) and non-Hermitian behavior can emerge dynamically in impurity models with Hermitian microscopic origins. Using perturbative renormalization group (RG) analysis, Fock-space diagonalization, and spin-spin relaxation time calculations, we demonstrate that nonlinear (NL) dispersion and anisotropic pseudochiral (PC) interactions generate complex fixed points and spectral defectiveness. The effective Kondo model features a square-root RG invariant linking planar and longitudinal Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya (DM) couplings, driving the onset of EPs. Our analysis reveals dissipative fixed points stabilized by an emergent Lie algebra structure and a scaling collapse in relaxation dynamics. Across both single- and two-impurity extensions, we identify a universal ``sign-reversion'' (SR) regime near critical NL coupling, where anisotropy preserves PC symmetry and SR serves as a signature of non-Hermitian flow. These results establish a new class of non-Hermitian criticality generated through RG evolution in otherwise Hermitian systems.

Title: Cold self-lubrication of sliding ice
Authors: Achraf Atila, Sergey V. Sukhomlinov, Martin H. Müser
Abstract: The low kinetic friction between ice and numerous counterbodies is commonly attributed to an interfacial water layer, which is believed to originate from pre-existing surface water or from melt water induced by high contact pressures or frictional heat. However, even the currently leading theory of frictional melting appears to defy direct experimental verification. Here we present molecular simulations of ice interfaces that reveal that ice surfaces liquefy without melting thermodynamically but predominantly by cold, displacement-driven amorphization. Despite effective self-lubrication, very small ice friction is found to require water to slip past a hydrophobic counterface -- or an excess amount of water, produced by, e.g., extreme sliding velocities.

Title: Layer Coherence Origin of Planar Hall Effect: from Charge to Multipole and Valley
Authors: Huiyuan Zheng, Dawei Zhai, Cong Xiao, Wang Yao
Abstract: We uncover a new origin of the planar Hall effect - as an intrinsic property of layer coherent electrons - that exists even in bilayer and trilayer atomically thin limit. It reforms the existing theories requiring three-dimensional orbital motion, or strong spin-orbit coupling of certain forms, which are absent in van der Waals thin films. We exemplify that the effect can be triggered by strain and interlayer sliding in twisted structures with rich tunability and strong magnitudes. Furthermore, this layer coherence mechanism broadens the conceptual framework to include planar multipole Hall effect, and valley Hall effect induced by in-plane pseudo-magnetic field, outreaching the existing mechanisms. The layer mechanism also provides a new route towards quantized Hall response upon a topological phase transition induced by in-plane magnetic field. These results unveil the unexplored potential of quantum layertronics and moiré flat band for planar transport in 2D materials.

Title: Observation of Universal Expansion Anisotropy from Cold Atoms to Hot Quark-Gluon Plasma
Authors: Ke Li, Hong-Fang Song, Hao-Jie Xu, Yu-Liang Sun, Fuqiang Wang
Abstract: Azimuthal anisotropy has been ubiquitously observed in high-energy proton-proton, proton-nucleus, and nucleus-nucleus (heavy-ion) collisions, shaking the early belief that those anisotropies require an intense phase of multiple interactions between the created particles. This work reports a study of anisotropic expansion of cold $^{6}$Li Fermi gases, initially trapped in an anisotropic potential, as a function of the interaction strength that can be readily tuned by an external magnetic field. It is found that the expansion anisotropy builds up quickly at small interaction strength, without the need of a large amount of interactions. An unexpected and quantitative universal scaling of the expansion anisotropy is observed for the first time between cold atom and heavy-ion systems as a function of the number of collisions per particle or opacity ($n_{\rm coll}$), despite their vast differences in scale and physics. The expansion isotropy in both the cold atom gases and heavy-ion collisions increases smoothly and shows no sign of saturation in the observed opacity range, with an approximate power-law dependence of $\sqrt{n_{\rm coll}}$, characteristic of random walks. This universality potentially unifies a variety of vastly different physical systems, from weakly interacting dilute gases to the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma of the early universe.

Abstract: The computational power and fault-tolerance of future large-scale quantum processors derive in large part from the connectivity between the qubits. One approach to increase connectivity is to engineer qubit-qubit interactions at a distance. Alternatively, the connectivity can be increased by physically displacing the qubits. This has been explored in trapped-ion experiments and using neutral atoms trapped with optical tweezers. For semiconductor spin qubits, several studies have investigated spin coherent shuttling of individual electrons, but high-fidelity transport over extended distances remains to be demonstrated. Here we report shuttling of an electron inside an isotopically purified Si/SiGe heterostructure using electric gate potentials. First, we form static quantum dots, and study how spin coherence decays as we repeatedly move a single electron between up to five dots. Next, we create a traveling wave potential to transport an electron in a moving quantum dot. This second method shows substantially better spin coherence than the first. It allows us to displace an electron over an effective distance of 10 $\mu$m in under 200 ns with an average fidelity of 99.5%. These results will guide future efforts to realize large-scale semiconductor quantum processors, making use of electron shuttling both within and between qubit arrays.

Title: Defects Enhance Stability in 12-fold Symmetric Soft-Matter Quasicrystals
Authors: Alptuğ Ulugöl, Robert J. Hardeman, Frank Smallenburg, Laura Filion
Abstract: Quasicrystals are materials that exhibit long-range order without translational periodicity. In soft matter, the most commonly observed quasicrystal has 12-fold symmetry and consists of tilings made out of squares and triangles. Intriguingly, both in experiments and simulations, these tilings nearly always appear with many vacancy-related defects that are connected to an additional tile: a rhombus. In this letter, we explore the role of rhombus defects on the entropy of square-triangle 12-fold quasicrystals. We introduce a novel lattice-based Monte Carlo simulation method that uses open boundaries to allow the concentration of defects to fluctuate. Our simulations show that rhombus tiles significantly increase the configurational entropy of the quasicrystal phase, enhancing its stability. These findings highlight the critical role of defects in stabilizing soft-matter quasicrystals.

Title: Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations and integrable hyperbolic Landau-Zener models
Authors: Suvendu Barik, Lieuwe Bakker, Vladimir Gritsev, Emil A. Yuzbashyan
Abstract: We study the relationship between integrable Landau-Zener (LZ) models and Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (KZ) equations. The latter are originally equations for the correlation functions of two-dimensional conformal field theories, but can also be interpreted as multi-time Schrödinger equations. The general LZ problem is to find probabilities of tunneling from eigenstates at $t=t_\text{in}$ to eigenstates at $t\to+\infty$ for an $N\times N$ time-dependent Hamiltonian $\hat H(t)$. A number of such problems are exactly solvable in the sense that their tunneling probabilities are elementary functions of Hamiltonian parameters. Recently, it has been proposed that exactly solvable LZ models of this type map to KZ equations. Here we use this connection to identify and solve a class of integrable LZ models with hyperbolic time dependence, $\hat H(t)=\hat A+\hat B/t$, for $N=2, 3$, and $4$, where $\hat A$ and $\hat B$ are time-independent matrices.

Title: On modeling fracture of soft polymers
Authors: Aditya Konale, Vikas Srivastava
Abstract: Soft polymers are ubiquitous materials in nature and as engineering materials with properties varying from rate-independent to rate-dependent. Current fracture toughness measures are non-unique for rate-dependent soft materials for varying loading profiles and specimen geometries. Works on modeling fracture in rate-dependent soft polymers are limited to specific pre-cracked geometries. There is no generally agreed-upon model for the fracture of soft polymers. We propose and show that a critical value of stress work can be used as a measure of fracture resistance in soft polymers. We develop a damage model to predict fracture in soft polymers. In the model, the energetic part of the critical stress work is proposed as a damage initiation criterion that has the ability to capture failure surfaces. The damage growth is modeled through a generalized gradient-damage framework. The fracture model is validated for both elastomers and viscous soft polymers by comparing model predictions against experimental results for different materials (ethylene propylene diene monomer - EPDM, EPS25 vitrimer, styrene butadiene rubber - SBR, natural rubber - NR, and polyborosiloxane - PBS), a variety of specimen geometries, and loading conditions. The model can predict key physical phenomena such as brittle and ductile responses and different fracture profiles. The microstructural quantities, such as subchain dissociation energy during the fracture of polymers, can be predicted from the macroscopic model parameters.

Title: Bulk photovoltaic effect in ferroelectric and antiferroelectric phases of antimony sulphoiodide investigated by means of ab-initio simulations
Authors: Giuseppe Cuono, Subhadeep Bandyopadhyay, Andrea Droghetti, Silvia Picozzi
Abstract: We employ first-principles calculations to investigate the ferroelectric properties and the bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) of antimony sulfur iodide (SbSI). The BPVE enables direct sunlight-to-electricity conversion in homogeneous materials and, in ferroelectric compounds, can be tuned via an electric field controlling the polarization. However, most ferroelectrics are oxides with large band gaps exceeding the energy of visible light, thereby limiting their photovoltaic performance. SbSI, featuring a visible-range band gap, combines remarkable photovoltaic capabilities with a spin-textured band structure, coupling charge and spin degrees of freedom. Our calculations predict ferroelectric and antiferroelectric phases with comparable band gaps but distinct spin textures, relevant for spintronics applications. The BPVE is driven by the linear and circular photogalvanic effects, exhibiting high photoconductivities under visible light. Furthermore, it serves as a diagnostic tool to identify the material phase, with the circular photogalvanic effect reflecting spin texture changes. Thanks to its multifunctional properties, SbSI emerges as a promising candidate for solar energy conversion and advanced electronics, with potential applications extending to spintronics.

Title: Determining the $^3$P$_0$ excited-state tune-out wavelength of $^{174}$Yb in a triple-magic lattice
Authors: Tim O. Höhn, René A. Villela, Er Zu, Leonardo Bezzo, Ronen M. Kroeze, Monika Aidelsburger
Abstract: Precise state-dependent control of optical potentials is of great importance for various applications utilizing cold neutral atoms. In particular, tune-out wavelengths for the clock state pair in alkaline-earth(-like) atoms provide maximally state-selective trap conditions that hold promise for the realization of novel approaches in quantum computation and simulation. While several ground-state tune-out wavelengths have been determined, similar experimental studies for metastable excited states are challenged by inelastic collisions and Raman losses, so far prohibiting precise measurements of excited-state tune-out conditions. In this work we report on the measurement of a tune-out wavelength for the metastable $^3$P$_0$ clock state in $^{174}$Yb at $519.920(9)\,$THz. In order to circumvent collisional losses, we isolate individual $^3$P$_0$ atoms in a clock-magic-wavelength lattice at $759\,$nm. To minimize the limitation imposed by Raman scattering, we further implement resolved sideband cooling on the clock transition, which allows us to reduce the lattice depth and surpass lifetimes of $5\,$s. The precision of the tune-out measurement is further enhanced by fluorescence imaging in a triple-magic configuration, where we implement molasses cooling on the $^3$P$_1$ intercombination line and identify a magic angle of $38.5(9)^\circ$ in the clock-magic lattice.

Title: Phase-Space Approach to Wannier Pairing and Bogoliubov Orbitals in Square-Octagon Lattices
Authors: Rajesh O. Sharma, Tanmoy Das
Abstract: Low-energy lattice models are the cornerstone for studying many-body physics and interactions between the system and measurement fields. A key challenge is identifying appropriate quasiparticle states that canonically transform between momentum and real space while retaining the correlation, entanglement, and geometric properties - generally called the Wannier obstruction. Here, we introduce a phase-space approach to bypass these obstructions. Instead of treating the phase space as a manifold, we embed a real space through a Bloch vector space at each momentum. Orbital and spin states are introduced through product states with the Bloch vector, while quantum statistics, correlations, topology, and entanglements are inherited from the Hamiltonian. We apply this framework to explore the unconventional pairing symmetry and the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) equation in phase space. Our findings demonstrate that while superconductivity exhibits global coherence, the local Wannier orbital symmetry primarily determines the pairing symmetry. We analytically solve the spin-fluctuation-mediated pairing symmetry on the phase space by engineering a flat band with artificial gauge fields. We validate the model on the square-octagon superconductor Lu$_2$Fe$_3$Si$_5$ using density functional theory (DFT), revealing the coexistence of nodeless $s^{\pm}$ and nodal $s_{z^2}$ pairing symmetries. This phase-space framework provides a robust, obstruction-free lattice model for complex many-body systems and their exotic excitations.

Title: Interaction of dopants with the I$_3$-type basal stacking fault in hexagonal-diamond Si
Authors: Marc Túnica, Perpetua Wanjiru Muchiri, Alberto Zobelli, Anna Marzegalli, Emilio Scalise, Michele Amato
Abstract: Recently synthesized hexagonal-diamond silicon, germanium, and silicon-germanium nanowires exhibit remarkable optical and electronic properties when compared to cubic-diamond polytypes. Because of the metastability of the hexagonal-diamond phase, I$_3$-type basal stacking faults are frequently observed in these materials. Understanding and modulating the interaction between these extended defects and dopants are essential for advancing the design and performance of these novel semiconductors. In the present study, we employ density functional theory calculations to investigate the interaction of extrinsic dopants (group III, IV, and V elements) with the I$_3$-type basal stacking fault in hexagonal-diamond silicon. Contrary to the behavior observed in cubic-diamond silicon with intrinsic stacking faults, we demonstrate that neutral and negatively charged $p$-type impurities exhibit a marked tendency to occupy lattice sites far from the I$_3$-type basal stacking fault. The interaction of acceptors with the planar defect reduces their energetic stability. However, this effect is much less pronounced for neutral or positively charged $n$-type dopants and isovalent impurities. The thermodynamic energy barrier to segregation for these dopants is small and may even become negative, indicating a tendency to segregate into the fault. Through a detailed analysis of structural modifications, ionization effects, and impurity-level charge density distribution, we show that the origin of this behavior can be attributed to variations in the impurity's steric effects and its wave function character. Finally, all these results are validated by considering the extreme case of an abrupt hexagonal/cubic silicon interface, where acceptor segregation from the cubic to the hexagonal region is demonstrated, confirming the behavior observed for $p$-type dopants near the I$_3$-type defect.

Title: Functional interpolation expansion for nonequilibrium correlated impurities
Authors: Daniel Werner, Enrico Arrigoni
Abstract: We present a functional interpolation approach within the auxiliary master equation framework to efficiently and accurately solve correlated impurity problems in nonequilibrium dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). By leveraging a near-exact auxiliary bath representation, the method estimates corrections via interpolation over a few bath realisations, significantly reducing computational cost and increasing accuracy. We illustrate the approach on the Anderson impurity model and on the Hubbard model within DMFT, capturing equilibrium and long-lived photodoped states.

Title: Ranked percolation model for the caking time of amorphous molecular powders
Authors: Vasco C. Braz, Nuno A. M. Araújo
Abstract: When amorphous molecular powders are exposed to high humidity levels or temperatures, the particle viscosity increases due to plasticization, promoting the formation of sinter bridges between pairs of particles in contact. Over time, these bridges facilitate particle agglomeration, eventually leading to the formation of a macroscopic cake that alters the mechanical properties and affects product quality. In this work, we model the caking process of amorphous powders subjected to a temperature shock as a bond percolation problem and investigate how particle bed heterogeneities influence the percolation threshold and, consequently, the expected caking times. Our findings indicate that a slight dispersion in particle size lowers the percolation threshold compared to a monodisperse bed or random percolation in polydisperse systems. Furthermore, we show that the expected caking time exhibits a non-monotonic behavior with the size dispersion, initially decreasing for low dispersion values and increasing for higher values. These results provide insights into the role of the particle size distribution on the caking dynamics of amorphous molecular powders

Title: Universal Bound States with Bose-Fermi Duality in Microwave-Shielded Polar Molecules
Authors: Tingting Shi, Haitian Wang, Xiaoling Cui
Abstract: We investigate universal bound states of microwave-shielded ultracold polar molecules. Under a highly elliptic microwave field, few-molecule scatterings in three dimension are shown to be governed by effective one-dimensional (1D) models. These models well reproduce the tetratomic (two-molecule) bound state and the Born-Oppenheimer potential in three-molecule sector. For hexatomic systems comprising three identical molecules, we find the lowest bound state emerge concurrently with tetratomic state, with binding energy exceeding twice of the latter. Strikingly, all these bound states display Bose-Fermi duality, i.e., they share identical energies and spatial densities in both bosonic and fermionic molecular systems. Universal features of these bound states are supported by the 1D nature of effective scattering and a large repulsive core in the reduced effective potential. For large molecule ensembles, our results suggest the formation of elongated self-bound droplets with crystalline patterns in both bosonic and fermionic polar molecules.

Title: Conduction Band Structure and Ultrafast Dynamics of Ferroelectric $α$-GeTe(111)
Authors: Geoffroy Kremer, Laurent Nicolaï, Frédéric Chassot, Julian Maklar, Christopher W. Nicholson, J. Hugo Dil, Juraj Krempaský, Gunther Springholz, Ralph Ernstorfer, Jan Minár, Laurenz Rettig, Claude Monney
Abstract: $\alpha$-GeTe(111) is a non-centrosymmetric ferroelectric (FE) material for which a significative lattice distortion combined with a strong spin-orbit interaction gives rise to giant Rashba split states in the bulk and at the surface, which have been intensively probed in the occupied valence states using static angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Nevertheless, its unoccupied conduction band structure remains unexplored, in particular the experimental determination of its electronic band gap across momentum space. Using time-resolved ARPES based on high-repetition rate and extreme ultraviolet femtosecond (fs) laser, we unveil the band structure of $\alpha$-GeTe(111) in the full Brillouin zone, both in the valence and conduction states, as well as the exploration of its out-of-equilibrium dynamics. Our work confirms the semiconducting nature of $\alpha$-GeTe(111) with a 0.85 eV indirect band gap, which provides an upper limit for comparison to density functional theory calculations. We finally reveal the dominant scattering mechanisms of photoexcited carriers during the out-of-equilibrium dynamics under fs light pulses.

Title: Real-space observation of salt-dependent aging in Laponite gels
Authors: Shunichi Saito, Sooyeon Kim, Yuichi Taniguchi, Miho Yanagisawa
Abstract: Colloidal gels gradually evolve as their structures reorganize, a process known as aging. Understanding this behavior is essential for fundamental science and practical applications such as drug delivery and tissue engineering. This study examines the aging of low-concentration Laponite suspensions with varying salt concentrations using fluorescence microscopy, scattering imaging, and particle tracking microrheology. Structural heterogeneity appeared earlier at higher salt concentrations, and the average size of aggregates decreased as the salt concentration increased further. Fourier transform analysis corroborated these trends, and scattering images showed similar results. Microrheology revealed distinct dynamics in Laponite-rich and Laponite-poor regions: the poor phase exhibited liquid-like behavior, while the rich phase exhibited gel-like properties. Further analysis suggested the presence of submicron or nanoscale structural heterogeneities within the rich phase. These findings provide insight into how aging and salt concentration shape the structure and dynamics of colloidal gels.

Title: The Two-Fluid Theory for Superfluid Hydrodynamics and Rotational Motion
Authors: Phil Attard
Abstract: The two-fluid theory for superfluid hydrodynamics is derived from the fountain pressure result that condensed bosons move at constant entropy and are driven by the chemical potential gradient. Explicit results for $^4$He show that the superfluid has vorticity, which is consistent with measured data but inconsistent with Landau's principle that superfluid flow is irrotational.

Title: Tailoring the Electronic Configurations of YPc$_2$ on Cu(111): Decoupling Strategies for Molecular Spin Qubits Platforms
Authors: Soyoung Oh, Franklin. H. Cho, We-hyo Soe, Jisoo Yu, Hong Bui, Lukas Spree, Caroline Hommel, Wonjun Jang, Soo-hyon Phark, Luciano Colazzo, Christoph Wolf, Fabio Donati
Abstract: Among the potential spin qubit candidates, yttrium phthalocyanine double-decker (YPc$_2$) features a diamagnetic metal ion core that stabilizes the molecular structure, while its magnetic properties arise primarily from an unpaired electron (S=1/2) delocalized over the two phthalocyanine (Pc) ligands. Understanding its properties in the proximity of metal electrodes is crucial to assess its potential use in molecular spin qubits architectures. Here, we investigated the morphology and electronic structure of this molecule adsorbed on Cu(111) surface using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). On Cu(111), YPc$_2$ adsorbs flat, with isolated molecules showing a preferred orientation along the <111> crystal axes. Moreover, we observed two different types of self-assembly molecular packing when growing molecular patches. For YPc$_2$ in direct contact with Cu(111), STM revealed a widely separated highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (HOMO/LUMO), suggesting the quenching of the unpaired spin. Conversely, when YPc$_2$ is separated from the metal substrate by a few-layer thick diamagnetic zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) layer, we found the HOMO to split into singly occupied and singly unoccupied molecular orbitals (SOMO/SUMO). We observed that more than 2 layers of ZnPc are needed to avoid intermixing between the two molecules and spin quenching in YPc2. Density functional theory (DFT) reveals the spin quenching is due to the hybridization between YPc$_2$ and Cu(111) states, confirming the importance of using suitable decoupling layers to preserve the unpaired molecular spin. Our results suggest the potential of YPc$_2$/ZnPc heterostructures as a stable and effective molecular spin qubit platform and validate the possibility of integrating this molecular spin qubit candidate in future quantum logic devices.

Title: Cavity-Mediated Gas-Liquid Transition
Authors: Fan Zhang, Haowei Li, Wei Yi
Abstract: We study the gas-liquid transition in a binary Bose-Einstein condensate, where the two Zeeman-shifted hyperfine spin components are coupled by cavity-assisted Raman processes. Below a critical Zeeman field, the cavity becomes superradiant for an infinitesimally small pumping strength, where the enhanced superradiance is facilitated by the simultaneous formation of quantum droplet, a self-bound liquid phase stabilized by quantum fluctuations. Above the critical Zeeman field, the gas-liquid transition only takes place after the system becomes superradiant at a finite pumping strength. As the back action of the gas-liquid transition, the superradiant cavity field undergoes an abrupt jump at the first-order transition point. Furthermore, as a result of the fixed density ratio of the quantum droplet, the cavity field exhibits a linear scaling with the pumping strength in the liquid phase. These features serve as prominent signals for the cavity-mediated gas-liquid transition and coexistence, which derive from the interplay of Zeeman field, cavity-assisted spin mixing, and quantum fluctuations.

Title: Unusual Valence of Ru and Prediction of Magnetism, Anomalous Hall Conductivity in a Newly Synthesized Double Perovskite Compound Ca_2CoRuO_6
Authors: Koushik Pradhan, Soumya Ghorai, Prabuddha Sanyal, Ryan Morrow, Bernd Büchner, Thirupathaiah Setti, Tanusri Saha Dasgupta
Abstract: With a goal to expand on the family of double perovskite compounds, hosting 3d transition metal and 4d or 5d transition metal, two new ordered double perovskite compounds, Ca$_2$FeRuO$_6$ and Ca$_2$CoRuO$_6$ are synthesized following the prediction of a recent high throughput machine-learning study [Phys. Rev. Materials 3, 084418]. Experimentally both compounds are found to stabilize in monoclinic symmetry, which is consistent with the high-throughput prediction for Ca$_2$FeRuO$_6$, but at odd for Ca$_2$CoRuO$_6$. Among the two synthesized compounds, the properties of Ca$_2$CoRuO$_6$, investigated employing the first principles technique and model Hamiltonian calculation, appear promising. The monoclinic structured Ca$_2$CoRuO$_6$ is found to stabilize unusual 6+ valence of Ru, and support a half-metallic ground state with uncompensated net moment. As predicted by our first-principles study, the finite spin-orbit coupling at the Ru site contributes to the non-trivial topology of the band structure of monoclinic Ca$_2$CoRuO$_6$, resulting in a moderately large value of anomalous Hall conductivity. Our theoretical predictions should encourage further experimental investigation of this newly synthesized compound.

Title: Asymmetric Electronic Band Alignment and Potentially Enhanced Thermoelectric Properties in Phase-Separated Mg2X (X=Si,Ge,Sn) Alloys
Authors: Byungki Ryu, Samuel Foster, Eun-Ae Choi, Sungjin Park, Jaywan Chung, Johannes de Boor, Pawel Ziolkowski, Eckhard Müller, Seung Zeon Han, SuDong Park, Neophytos Neophytou
Abstract: The Mg2X (X=Si, Ge, Sn) based alloy is an eco-friendly thermoelectric material for mid-temperature applications. The Mg2Si1-xSnx and Mg2Ge1-xSnx alloys can be phase-separated into Si(Ge)- and Sn-rich phases during material synthesis, leading to a nanocomposite with locally varying electronic band structure. First-principles calculations reveal that the valence band offset is eight-times larger than the conduction band offset at the interface between Si- and Sn-rich phases for x=0.6, showing type-I and asymmetric band alignment (0.092 eV versus 0.013 eV). Using Boltzmann transport theory and thermionic emission calculations, we show that the large valence band energy discontinuity could allow for energy filtering effects to take place that can potentially increase the power factor substantially in the p-type material system if designed appropriately.

Title: Exact, Average, and Broken Symmetries in a Simple Adaptive Monitored Circuit
Authors: Zhi Li, Zhu-Xi Luo
Abstract: Symmetry is a powerful tool for understanding phases of matter in equilibrium. Quantum circuits with measurements have recently emerged as a platform for novel states of matter intrinsically out of equilibrium. Can symmetry be used as an organizing principle for these novel states, their phases and phase transitions? In this work, we give an affirmative answer to this question in a simple adaptive monitored circuit, which hosts an ordering transition in addition to a separate entanglement transition, upon tuning a single parameter. Starting from a symmetry-breaking initial state, depending on the tuning parameter, the steady state could (i) remain symmetry-broken, (ii) exhibit the average symmetry in the ensemble of trajectories, or (iii) exhibit the exact symmetry for each trajectory. The ordering transition is mapped to the transition in a classical majority vote model, described by the Ising universality class, while the entanglement transition lies in the percolation class. Numerical simulations are further presented to support the analytical understandings.

Title: Can one hear the full nonlinearity of a PDE from its small excitations?
Authors: Maxim Olshanii, Danshyl Boodhoo
Abstract: In this article, we show how one can restore an unknown nonlinear partial differential equation of a sine-Gordon type from its linearization around an unknown stationary kink. The key idea is to regard the ground state of the linear problem as the translation-related Goldstone mode of the nonlinear PDE sought after.

Title: Scattering near-field optical microscopy at 1-nm resolution using ultralow tip oscillation amplitudes
Authors: Akitoshi Shiotari, Jun Nishida, Adnan Hammud, Fabian Schulz, Martin Wolf, Takashi Kumagai, Melanie Müller
Abstract: Scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM) allows for the observation of the optical response of material surfaces with a resolution far below the diffraction limit. Based on amplitude-modulation atomic force microscopy (AFM) with typical tapping amplitudes of tens of nanometers, a spatial resolution of 10-100 nm is routinely achieved in s-SNOM. However, optical imaging and spectroscopy of atomic-scale structures remain a substantial challenge. Here, we developed ultralow tip oscillation amplitude s-SNOM (ULA-SNOM), where the ultra-confined field localized at a 1-nm-scale gap between a plasmonic tip and sample is combined with frequency-modulation (non-contact) AFM in a stable cryogenic ultrahigh vacuum environment. Using a silver tip under visible laser illumination with a constant 1-nm amplitude oscillation, we obtain a material-contrast image of silicon islands on a silver surface with 1-nm lateral resolution, which surpasses the conventional limits of s-SNOM. ULA-SNOM paves the way for the acquisition of optical information from atomic-scale structures, such as single photo-active defects and molecules.

Title: Shape and Size-Dependent Surface Plasmonic Resonances of Liquid Metal Alloy (EGaIn) Nanoparticles
Authors: Sina Jamalzadegan, Mohammadreza Zare, Micah J. Dickens, Florian Schenk, Alireza Velayati, Maksym Yarema, Michael D. Dickey, Qingshan Wei
Abstract: Liquid metals (LM) are emerging plasmonic nanomaterials with transformable surface plasmon resonances (SPR) due to their liquid-like deformability. This study delves into the plasmonic properties of LM nanoparticles, with a focus on EGaIn (eutectic gallium-indium)-based materials. Leveraging Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) simulations and experimental validations for spherical liquid metal nanoparticles plasmonic properties, we explored the localized SPR (LSPR) effects of EGaIn nanoparticles with various shapes, including nanospheres, dimers, nanorods, nanodisks, nanoellipses, nanocubes, and nanocuboids, in the broad range of ultraviolet (UV)-visible-near infrared (NIR) spectrum. While EGaIn is conventionally known as a UV-active metal alloy, this study reveals unique LSPR features of EGaIn (e.g., higher order resonances, polar and quadrupolar modes) in the broader visible and NIR wavelength ranges, providing a comprehensive map of LSPR properties for different shapes of EGaIn nanoparticles. These findings offer new insights into the dependence of the optical properties of EGaIn nanoparticles on their geometries for diverse applications, ranging from biosensing, nanoelectronics, to optomechanical systems.

Title: A Dynamical Equation for the Lorenz Curve: Dynamics of incomplete moments of probability distributions arising from Fokker-Planck equations
Authors: David W. Cohen, Merek Johnson, Bruce M. Boghosian
Abstract: Fokker-Planck equations (forward Kolmogorov equations) evolve probability densities in time from an initial condition. For distributions over the real line, these evolution equations can sometimes be transformed into dynamics over the incomplete zeroth and first moments. We call this perspective the Lorenz dynamics of the system after the Lorenz curve description of distributions of wealth. This offers the benefit of presenting the dynamics over a compact domain. The integral transformation is motivated and then stated for a general class of Fokker-Planck equations. Following this, the transformed equation is solved for the heat equation and some variants thereof. Finally, some equations arising from the application of kinetic theory to idealized economic systems are transformed and analyzed in this new light.

Title: Learning Radical Excited States from Sparse Data
Authors: Jingkun Shen, Lucy E. Walker, Kevin Ma, James D. Green, Hugo Bronstein, Keith T. Butler, Timothy J. H. Hele
Abstract: Emissive organic radicals are currently of great interest for their potential use in the next generation of highly efficient organic light emitting diode (OLED) devices and as molecular qubits. However, simulating their optoelectronic properties is challenging, largely due to spin-contamination and the multireference character of their excited states. Here we present a data-driven approach where, for the first time, the excited electronic states of organic radicals are learned directly from experimental excited state data, using a much smaller amount of data than typically required by Machine Learning. We adopt ExROPPP, a fast and spin-pure semiempirical method for calculation of the excited states of radicals, as a surrogate physical model for which we learn the optimal set of parameters. To achieve this we compile the largest known database of organic radical geometries and their UV-vis data, which we use to train our model. Our trained model gives Root Mean Square (RMS) and mean absolute errors for excited state energies of 0.24 and 0.16 eV respectively, improving hugely over ExROPPP with literature parameters. Four new organic radicals are synthesised and we test the model on their spectra, finding even lower errors and similar correlation as for the testing set. This model paves the way for the high throughput discovery of next generation radical-based optoelectronics.

Title: Sphere free energy of scalar field theories with cubic interactions
Authors: Simone Giombi, Elizabeth Himwich, Andrei Katsevich, Igor Klebanov, Zimo Sun
Abstract: The dimensional continuation approach to calculating the free energy of $d$-dimensional Euclidean CFT on the round sphere $S^d$ has been used to develop its $4-\epsilon$ expansion for a number of well-known non-supersymmetric theories, such as the $O(N)$ model. The resulting estimate of the sphere free energy $F$ in the 3D Ising model has turned out to be in good agreement with the numerical value obtained using the fuzzy sphere regularization. In this paper, we develop the $6-\epsilon$ expansions for CFTs on $S^d$ described by scalar field theory with cubic interactions and use their resummations to estimate the values of $F$. In particular, we study the theories with purely imaginary coupling constants, which describe non-unitary universality classes arising when certain conformal minimal models are continued above two dimensions. The Yang-Lee model $M(2,5)$ is described by a field theory with one scalar field, while the $D$-series $M(3,8)$ model is described by two scalar fields. We also study the $OSp(1|2)$ symmetric cubic theory of one commuting and two anti-commuting scalar fields, which appears to describe the critical behavior of random spanning forests. In the course of our work, we revisit the calculations of beta functions of marginal operators containing the curvature. We also use another method for approximating $F$, which relies on perturbation theory around the bilocal action near the long-range/short-range crossover. The numerical values it gives for $F$ tend to be in good agreement with other available methods.

Title: Refining Coarse-Grained Molecular Topologies: A Bayesian Optimization Approach
Authors: Pranoy Ray, Adam P. Generale, Nikhith Vankireddy, Yuichiro Asoma, Masataka Nakauchi, Haein Lee, Katsuhisa Yoshida, Yoshishige Okuno, Surya R. Kalidindi
Abstract: Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are essential for accurately predicting the physical and chemical properties of large molecular systems across various pressure and temperature ensembles. However, the high computational costs associated with All-Atom (AA) MD simulations have led to the development of Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics (CGMD), providing a lower-dimensional compression of the AA structure into representative CG beads, offering reduced computational expense at the cost of predictive accuracy. Existing CGMD methods, such as CG-Martini (calibrated against experimental data), aim to generate an embedding of a topology that sufficiently generalizes across a range of structures. Detrimentally, in attempting to specify parameterization with applicability across molecular classes, it is unable to specialize to domain-specific applications, where sufficient accuracy and computational speed are critical. This work presents a novel approach to optimize derived results from CGMD simulations by refining the general-purpose Martini3 topologies specifically the bonded interaction parameters within a given coarse-grained mapping - for domain-specific applications using Bayesian Optimization methodologies. We have developed and validated a CG potential applicable to any degree of polymerization, representing a significant advancement in the field. Our optimized CG potential, based on the Martini3 framework, aims to achieve accuracy comparable to AAMD while maintaining the computational efficiency of CGMD. This approach bridges the gap between efficiency and accuracy in multiscale molecular simulations, potentially enabling more rapid and cost-effective molecular discovery across various scientific and technological domains.

Title: Electron Scattering via Geometric and Dynamical Decoupling
Authors: Lorenzo Bagnasacco, Fabio Taddei, Vittorio Giovannetti
Abstract: By decoupling the geometric from the dynamical contributions in the scattering dynamics, we develop a method to compute the scattering matrix of electrons in a one-dimensional coherent conductor connected to two electrodes. In particular, we demonstrate that, in the high-energy regime, the transmission matrix converges to the Berry operator of the system. We showcase the method through several examples featuring different in-plane magnetic field profiles. Notably, our results reveal the possibility of achieving near-perfect spin-flip transmission, highlighting potential applications in spintronics.

Title: Active Quantum Reservoir Engineering: Using a Qubit to Manipulate its Environment
Authors: Marcelo Janovitch, Matteo Brunelli, Patrick P. Potts
Abstract: Quantum reservoir engineering leverages dissipative processes to achieve desired behavior, with applications ranging from entanglement generation to quantum error correction. Therein, a structured environment acts as an entropy sink for the system and no time-dependent control over the system is required. We develop a theoretical framework for active reservoir engineering, where time-dependent control over a quantum system is used to manipulate its environment. In this case, the system may act as an entropy sink for the environment. Our framwork captures the dynamical interplay between system and environment, and provides an intuitive picture of how finite-size effects and system-environment correlations allow for manipulating the environment by repeated initialization of the quantum system. We illustrate our results with two examples: a superconducting qubit coupled to an environment of two-level systems and a semiconducting quantum dot coupled to nuclear spins. In both scenarios, we find qualitative agreement with previous experimental results, illustrating how active control can unlock new functionalities in open quantum systems.

Title: Quantum Complexity and Chaos in Many-Qudit Doped Clifford Circuits
Authors: Beatrice Magni, Xhek Turkeshi
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of quantum complexity and chaos in doped Clifford circuits acting on qudits of odd prime dimension $d$. Using doped Clifford Weingarten calculus and a replica tensor network formalism, we derive exact results and perform large-scale simulations in regimes challenging for tensor network and Pauli-based methods. We begin by analyzing generalized stabilizer entropies, computable magic monotones in many-qudit systems, and identify a dynamical phase transition in the doping rate, marking the breakdown of classical simulability and the onset of Haar-random behavior. The critical behavior is governed by the qudit dimension and the magic content of the non-Clifford gate. Using the qudit $T$-gate as a benchmark, we show that higher-dimensional qudits converge faster to Haar-typical stabilizer entropies. For qutrits ($d=3$), analytical predictions match numerics on brickwork circuits, showing that locality plays a limited role in magic spreading. We also examine anticoncentration and entanglement growth, showing that $O(\log N)$ non-Clifford gates suffice for approximating Haar expectation values to precision $\varepsilon$, and relate antiflatness measures to stabilizer entropies in qutrit systems. Finally, we analyze out-of-time-order correlators and show that a finite density of non-Clifford gates is needed to induce chaos, with a sharp transition fixed by the local dimension, twice that of the magic transition. Altogether, these results establish a unified framework for diagnosing complexity in doped Clifford circuits and deepen our understanding of resource theories in multiqudit systems.

Title: Isotope-agnostic motional ground-state cooling of neutral Yb atoms
Authors: Ronen M. Kroeze, René A. Villela, Er Zu, Tim O. Höhn, Monika Aidelsburger
Abstract: Efficient high-fidelity ground-state cooling of motional degrees of freedom is crucial for applications in quantum simulation, computing and metrology. Here, we demonstrate direct ground-state cooling of fermionic $^{171}$Yb and bosonic $^{174}$Yb atoms in two- and three-dimensional magic-wavelength optical lattices on the ultranarrow clock transition. Its high spectral resolution offers the potential for reaching extremely low temperatures. To ensure efficient cooling, we develop a chirped sideband cooling scheme, where we sweep the clock-laser frequency to mitigate the effects of spatial trap inhomogeneities. We further generalize the theoretical description of sideband spectra to higher-dimensional lattices for precise thermometry. We achieve 2D ground state fractions of $97\%$ for $^{171}$Yb with an average motional occupation of $\bar{n}\simeq0.015$ and provide a direct comparison with $^{174}$Yb, reaching similar cooling performance. Applying the same scheme in 3D results in $\bar{n}\simeq0.15$ limited by layer-to-layer inhomogeneities in the vertical direction. These results demonstrate efficient motional ground-state cooling in optical lattices, especially for bosonic alkaline-earth(-like) atoms, where other methods are not applicable, opening the door to novel protocols for quantum science applications with neutral atoms.
