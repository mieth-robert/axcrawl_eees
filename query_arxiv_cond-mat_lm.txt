Title: Feedback Driven Convergence, Competition, and Entanglement in Classical Stochastic Processes
Authors: Allen Lobo, Saravanan A
Abstract: We present a dynamical theory of statistical convergence in which the law of large numbers arises from outcome-outcome feedback rather than assumed independence. Defining the convergence field and its derivative, we show that empirical frequencies evolve through coupling, producing competition, finite-m fluctuations, and classical entanglement. Using the Kramers-Moyal expansion, we derive an Ito-Langevin and Fokker-Planck description, reducing in the symmetric regime to a time-dependent Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. We propose variance-based witnesses that detect outcome-space entanglement in both binary sequences and coupled Brownian trajectories, and confirm entanglement through numerical experiments. Extending the formalism yields multi-outcome feedback dynamics and finite-time cross-diffusion between Brownian particles. The results unify convergence, fluctuation, and entanglement as consequences of a single feedback-driven stochastic principle.

Title: A Unified Computational Framework for Two Dimensional Diffusion Limited Aggregation via Finite-Size Scaling, Multifractality, and Morphological Analysis
Authors: Satish Prajapati
Abstract: Diffusion-Limited Aggregation (DLA), the canonical model for non-equilibrium fractal growth, emerges from the simple rule of irreversible attachment by random walkers. Despite four decades of study, a unified computational framework reconciling its stochastic algorithm, universal fractal dimension, multifractal growth measure, and finite-size effects remains essential for applications from materials science to geomorphology. Through large-scale simulations (clusters up to $N = 10^6$ particles) in two dimensions, we perform a tripartite analysis: (1) We establish a definitive finite-size scaling collapse, extracting the universal fractal dimension $D = 1.712 \pm 0.015$ and identifying the crossover to boundary-dominated growth at a scaled mass $x_0 \approx 0.10 \pm 0.02$. (2) We quantify the full multifractal spectrum of the harmonic measure ($\Delta\alpha \approx 1.13$), directly linking the stochastic algorithm to the deterministic Laplacian growth equation $\nabla^2 p = 0$ and explaining the screening effect via an exponential decay $\eta \sim e^{-r/\xi}$ with screening length $\xi = 22.7 \pm 0.8$ lattice units. (3) We provide a complete morphological characterization, revealing power-law branch length distributions ($\tau \approx 2.1$) and angular branching preferences ($\sim 72^\circ$). This work computationally validates DLA as a robust universality class and provides a scalable methodology for analyzing diffusion-controlled pattern formation across disciplines.

Title: A large-scale nanocrystal database with aligned synthesis and properties enabling generative inverse design
Authors: Kai Gu, Yingping Liang, Senliang Peng, Aotian Guo, Haizheng Zhong, Ying Fu
Abstract: The synthesis of nanocrystals has been highly dependent on trial-and-error, due to the complex correlation between synthesis parameters and physicochemical properties. Although deep learning offers a potential methodology to achieve generative inverse design, it is still hindered by the scarcity of high-quality datasets that align nanocrystal synthesis routes with their properties. Here, we present the construction of a large-scale, aligned Nanocrystal Synthesis-Property (NSP) database and demonstrate its capability for generative inverse design. To extract structured synthesis routes and their corresponding product properties from literature, we develop NanoExtractor, a large language model (LLM) enhanced by well-designed augmentation strategies. NanoExtractor is validated against human experts, achieving a weighted average score of 88% on the test set, significantly outperforming chemistry-specialized (3%) and general-purpose LLMs (38%). The resulting NSP database contains nearly 160,000 aligned entries and serves as training data for our NanoDesigner, an LLM for inverse synthesis design. The generative capability of NanoDesigner is validated through the successful design of viable synthesis routes for both well-established PbSe nanocrystals and rarely reported MgF2 nanocrystals. Notably, the model recommends a counter-intuitive, non-stoichiometric precursor ratio (1:1) for MgF2 nanocrystals, which is experimentally confirmed as critical for suppressing byproducts. Our work bridges the gap between unstructured literature and data-driven synthesis, and also establishes a powerful human-AI collaborative paradigm for accelerating nanocrystal discovery.

Title: Molecular Adsorption of H2O on TiO2 and TiO2:Y Surfaces
Authors: Dilshod Nematov, Khilmirzo Kholmurodov, Mirzoaziz Husenzoda, Andrey Lyubchyk, Amondulloi Burhonzoda
Abstract: In this work, using theoretical calculations within the framework of the density functional theory, taking into account the dispersive VDW interaction, the processes of adsorption and interaction of a water molecule with a TiO2 surface in various configurations are investigated. At the atomic/molecular level, the interactions of a water molecule with a TiO2 surface have been studied for various orientations. The results of calculations within the framework of DFT+ VDW show that the adsorption energies of single water molecules in different initial positions on the substrate surface vary from-0.72 to-0.84 eV, and the most stable adsorbate structure is the TiO2+ H2O system upon adsorption of a molecule of water, parallel to the Y axis, because during the adsorption of H2O parallel to the Y axis, some favorable effects are observed in the band structure of titanium dioxide. On the one hand, the band gap decreases to 2.59 eV, and on the other hand, a new energy state appears in the band gap with an energy contribution of 0.17 eV, when water is physisorbed and interacts with a titanium atom at a distance of 2.12 Å and occupies a perpendicular position relative to the surface.

Title: Analysis of the Optical Properties and Electronic Structure of Semiconductors of the Cu2NiXS4 (X = Si, Ge, Sn) Family as New Promising Materials for Optoelectronic Devices
Authors: Dilshod Nematov
Abstract: In this work, the optoelectronic characteristics of kesterites of the Cu2NiXS4 system (X = Si, Ge, Sn) were studied. The electronic properties of the Cu2NiXS4 (X = Si, Ge, Sn) system were studied using first-principles calculations within the framework of density functional theory. For calculations, ab initio codes VASP and Wien2k were used. The high-precision modified Beke-Jones (mBJ) functional and the hybrid HSE06 functional were used to estimate the bandgap, electronic and optical properties. Calculations have shown that when replacing Si with Ge and Sn, the band gap decreases from 2.58 eV to 1.33 eV. Replacing Si with Ge and Sn reduces the overall density of electronic states. In addition, new deep (shallow) states are formed in the band gap of these crystals, which is confirmed by the behavior of their optical properties. The obtained band gap values are compared with existing experimental measurements, demonstrating good agreement between HSE06 calculations and experimental data. The nature of changes in the dielectric constant, absorption capacity and optical conductivity of these systems depending on the photon energy has also been studied. The statistical dielectric constant and refractive index of these materials were found. The results will help increase the amount of information about the properties of the materials under study and will allow the use of these compounds in a wider range of optoelectronic devices, in particular, in solar cells and other devices that use solar radiation to generate electric current.

Title: Anomalous Collision of Exceptional Points on Nonorientable Manifolds
Authors: Weijia Wang, Qicheng Zhang, Kun Zhang, Shuaishuai Tong, Chunyin Qiu
Abstract: Band degeneracies, ranging from Hermitian Dirac points to non-Hermitian exceptional points (EPs), play a central role in topological phase transitions. Beyond the topology of individual degeneracies, their mutual interactions yield richer phenomena. A representative example is the anomalous non-annihilating collision of pairwise-created degeneracies, previously believed to occur only in non-Abelian multiband systems. Here, we theoretically reveal and experimentally demonstrate that such an anomalous collision can emerge even in a simple two-band system without non-Abelian nature. In a two-dimensional non-Hermitian lattice whose Brillouin zone forms a nonorientable Klein bottle, two EPs with opposite topological charges, pairwise created from a hybrid point, merge into a new vortex point upon re-encounter, instead of annihilating. Remarkably, the hybrid point is a defective degeneracy featuring no eigenenergy braiding, whereas the vortex point is a non-defective degeneracy yet exhibits nontrivial eigenenergy braiding. This process manifests a non-Hermitian phase transition from a gapped phase to a gapless phase, a scenario that we directly observe in a hybrid-dimensional acoustic lattice via momentum-resolved band braid and Berry phase measurements. Our findings identify nonorientability as a new arena for engineering band degeneracies and topological phases, and pave the way for experimentally exploring the interplay between exceptional and nonorientable topology.

Title: Strain effects on the binding and diffusion energies of Au adatoms and CeO2 admolcules on Au, CeO2, MgO and SrTiO3 surfaces
Authors: Ahmad Ahmad, Ying-Cheng Chen, Jie Peng, Anter El-Azab
Abstract: First-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to study the effects of elastic strains on the binding and diffusion activation energies of Au adatom and CeO2 admolecule on Au (001), Ce-terminated CeO2 (001), MgO (001), SrO- and TiO2-terminationed SrTiO3 (001) surfaces. In preparation for computing these energies, normal and shear strains within the range 0.15% were applied in the plane of the surface of the supercell prior to placing the adsorbed species on the surface. Our study shows that the dependence of binding energies and diffusion barriers of adatoms and molecules on the strain varies significantly among surfaces. The strain was found to alter the symmetry of surface diffusion pathways causing anisotropy of the diffusion barriers. This strain-induced anisotropy depends on the orientation of the applied strains relative to the in-plane crystallographic directions of the free surface. The binding and diffusion activation energies were fit linearly in terms of strain components in the range 0.15% and the extrapolated values compared favorably to DFT computed values up to 0.5%. The scheme presented here for the computation and fitting of the binding and diffusion energies in terms of strain can be used to inform models of surface diffusion, clustering and growth of multi-component and multi-phase thin films and investigate the effect of strain on the self-organization in such systems.

Title: Asymptotic freedom, lost: Complex conformal field theory in the two-dimensional $O(N>2)$ nonlinear sigma model and its realization in the spin-1 Heisenberg chain
Authors: Christopher Yang, Thomas Scaffidi
Abstract: The two-dimensional $O(N)$ nonlinear sigma model (NLSM) is asymptotically free for $N>2$: it exhibits neither a nontrivial fixed point nor spontaneous symmetry-breaking. Here we show that a nontrivial fixed point generically does exist in the $\textit{complex}$ coupling plane and is described by a complex conformal field theory (CCFT). This CCFT fixed point is generic in the sense that it has a single relevant singlet operator, and is thus expected to arise in any non-Hermitian model with $O(N)$ symmetry upon tuning a single complex parameter. We confirm this prediction numerically by locating the CCFT at $N = 3$ in a non-Hermitian spin-1 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain, finding good agreement between the complex central charge and scaling dimensions and those obtained by analytic continuation of real fixed points from $N\leq 2$. We further construct a realistic Lindbladian for a spin-1 chain whose no-click dynamics are governed by the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian realizing the CCFT. Since the CCFT vacuum is the eigenstate with the smallest decay rate, the system naturally relaxes under dissipative dynamics toward a CFT state, thus providing a route to preparing long-range entangled states through engineered dissipation.

Title: Boltzmann theory of the inverse Edelstein effect in a two-dimensional Rashba gas
Authors: Irene Gaiardoni, Mattia Trama, Alfonso Maiellaro, Claudio Guarcello, Francesco Romeo, Roberta Citro
Abstract: We investigate the inverse Edelstein effect in a non-homogeneous system consisting of a ferromagnetic layer coupled to a Rashba two-dimensional electron gas. Within a semiclassical Boltzmann framework, we derive analytical expressions for the charge and spin currents and analyze their dependence on key parameters such as the chemical potential and the Rashba coupling strength. We show how interfacial exchange and spin-orbit interactions jointly control the efficiency of spin-to-charge conversion, leading to distinct regimes characterized by qualitatively different transport responses. A central outcome of our work is the availability of closed-form analytical results, which provide direct physical insight and enable a transparent and quantitative benchmarking with experiments on complex oxide interfaces, such as LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$.

Title: Anomalous diffusion from hydrodynamic recoupling in particle-hole symmetric fluids
Authors: Ewan McCulloch, Romain Vasseur, Sarang Gopalakrishnan
Abstract: In charged fluids obeying particle-hole symmetry, such as the Dirac fluid in graphene, charge transport is diffusive despite the presence of ballistically propagating sound waves: sound waves "hydrodynamically decouple" from the slower charge fluctuations. For quasi-one-dimensional fluids, we show that this symmetry-protected charge diffusion is not smoothly connected to the normal diffusion that arises when momentum conservation is broken by noise (or static impurities). Instead, the charge diffusion constant is a discontinuous function of noise, which (in the weak-noise limit) depends only on the ratio of momentum and energy relaxation rates. In the special limit of momentum-conserving noise (e.g., spatially uniform fluctuations of the Hamiltonian), the diffusion constant diverges in the presence of noise. We describe the resulting superdiffusion in terms of coupled Burgers equations. We present a general mechanism--hydrodynamic recoupling--by which weak noise can induce singular changes in transport coefficients. Our results highlight the limits of zero-noise extrapolation for predicting dynamical quantities like diffusion constants.

Title: Superextensive charging speeds in a correlated quantum charger
Authors: Harald Schmid, Felix von Oppen, Gil Refael, Yang Peng
Abstract: We define a quantum charger as an interacting quantum system that transfers energy between two drives. The key figure of merit characterizing a charger is its charging power. Remarkably, the presence of long-range interactions within the charger can induce a collective steady-state charging mode that depends superlinearly on the size of the charger, exceeding the performance of noninteracting, parallel units. Using the driven Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model and power-law interacting spin chains, we show that this effect persists up to a critical system size set by the breakdown of the high-frequency regime. We discuss optimal work output as well as experimentally accessible initial states. The superlinear charging effect can be probed in trapped-ion experiments, and positions interacting Floquet systems as promising platforms for enhanced energy conversion.

Title: An altermagnetic materials library in intercalated transition-metal dichalcogenides
Authors: Ezra Day-Roberts, Huan Wu, Onur Erten, A. S Botana
Abstract: Altermagnets represent a promising class of magnetic materials owing to their distinctive spin-split band structures in the absence of net magnetization. Here, we present a first-principles investigation of altermagnetism in magnetically intercalated transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) with the general formula T$_y$MX$_2$ (T= 3$d$-transition metal, M= transition-metal, X=chalcogen, $y$= 1/3 or 1/4). For a TMD host with 2H structure, compounds exhibiting A-type antiferromagnetism are $g$-wave altermagnets by symmetry. We identify several intercalated TMDs fulfilling the conditions for altermagnetic order to be realized. Several of these candidate materials display spin-splittings at the Fermi level as large as 100 meV.

Title: Symmetric topological Mott insulator and Mott semimetal
Authors: Boran Zhou, Ya-Hui Zhang
Abstract: Correlated physics in nearly flat topological bands is a central theme in the study of moiré materials. While ground states at integer fillings are typically identified as quantum Hall ferromagnets within a Hartree-Fock framework, we propose the existence of symmetric topological Mott insulators (STMIs) that transcend this Slater determinant picture. Focusing on half-filling of each flavor per unit cell, we demonstrate the existence of STMIs which exhibit a quantized charge or spin Hall response. We first establish this phase in a bilayer Haldane-Hubbard model with localized orbitals on the $A$ sublattice and dispersive band on the $B$ sublattice. Starting from a trivial Mott insulator on the $A$ sublattice, tuning the sublattice potential drives a Bose-Einstein-condensation (BEC) to Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) transition of the associated $p-\mathrm{i}p$ exciton pairing, realizing a topological Mott insulator with $C=1$ per flavor. We further generalize this construction to a single-layer spinful model, where the resulting STMI hosts charge edge modes coexisting with bulk local moments. A Mott semimetal is identified at the quantum critical point between the STMI and the trivial Mott insulator. Finally, we discuss applications to AA-stacked MoTe$_2$/WSe$_2$, proposing a ferromagnetic Chern insulator phase as a low-temperature descendant of the symmetric Mott semimetal.

Title: Thermalization in the mixed-field Ising model: An occupation number perspective
Authors: Isaías Vallejo-Fabila, Fausto Borgonovi, Felix M. Izrailev, Lea F. Santos
Abstract: The occupation number is a key observable for diagnosing thermalization, as it connects directly to standard statistical laws such as Fermi--Dirac, Bose--Einstein, and Boltzmann distributions. In the context of spin systems, it represents the population of the sublevels of the magnetization in the $z$-direction. We use this quantity to probe the onset of thermalization in the isolated quantum and classical one-dimensional spin-1 Ising model with transverse and longitudinal fields. Thermalization is achieved when the long-time average of the occupation number converges to the microcanonical prediction as the chain length $L$ increases, consistent with the emergence of ergodicity. However, the finite-size scaling analysis in the quantum model is challenged by the exponential growth of the Hilbert space with $L$. To overcome this limitation, we turn to the corresponding classical model, which enables access to much larger system sizes. By tracking the dynamics of individual spins on their three-dimensional Bloch spheres and employing tools from random matrix theory, we establish a quantitative criterion for classical ergodicity in interacting spin systems. We find that deviations from classical ergodicity decay algebraically with system size. This power-law scaling then provides a quantitative bound on the approach to thermal equilibrium in the quantum model.

Title: Exact critical-temperature bounds for two-dimensional Ising models
Authors: Davidson Noby Joseph, Igor Boettcher
Abstract: We derive exact critical-temperature bounds for the classical ferromagnetic Ising model on two-dimensional periodic tessellations of the plane. For any such tessellation or lattice, the critical temperature is bounded from a above by a universal number that is solely determined by the largest coordination number on the lattice. Crucially, these bounds are tight in some cases such as the Honeycomb, Square, and Triangular lattices. We prove the bounds using the Feynman--Kac--Ward formalism, confirm their validity for a selection of over two hundred lattices, and construct a two-dimensional lattice with 24-coordinated sites and record high critical temperature.

Title: Fermi Sets: Universal and interpretable neural architectures for fermions
Authors: Liang Fu
Abstract: We introduce Fermi Sets, a universal and physically interpretable neural architecture for fermionic many-body wavefunctions. Building on a ``parity-graded'' representation [1], we prove that any continuous fermionic wavefunction on a compact domain can be approximated to arbitrary accuracy by a linear combination of K antisymmetric basis functions--such as pairwise products or Slater determinants--multiplied by symmetric functions. A key result is that the number of required bases is provably small: K=1 suffices in one-dimensional continua (and on lattices in any dimension), K=2 suffices in two dimensions, and in higher dimensions K grows at most linearly with particle number. The antisymmetric bases can be learned by small neural networks, while the symmetric factors are implemented by permutation-invariant networks whose width scales only linearly with particle number. Thus, Fermi Sets achieve universal approximation of fermionic wavefunctions with minimal overhead while retaining clear physical interpretability.

Title: Polymer-Iron Oxide Hybrid Films for Controlling Electrokinetic Properties
Authors: Austin Dick, Xiao Tong, Kim Kisslinger, Carlos E. Colosqui, Gregory Doerk
Abstract: Electrokinetic phenomena at polymer-water interfaces are central to technologies for water purification, ion separations, and energy conversion, yet the ability to systematically control polymer surface charge and associated electrokinetic processes remains limited. Here, we demonstrate a simple liquid-phase infiltration (LPI) method to synthesize polymer-metal oxide hybrid films with controllable interfacial properties. Hydroxy-terminated poly(2-vinylpyridine) (P2VP-OH) brushes grafted to silicon substrates were infiltrated with iron nitrate from ethanolic solution, followed by low-temperature thermal treatment to convert the infiltrated precursor into iron oxide. Spectroscopic ellipsometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis confirmed oxide incorporation and hybrid film formation without polymer degradation. Electrokinetic flow characterization reveals that the hybrid films acquire the electrokinetic properties of the infiltrated oxide, with concentration-dependent streaming potentials and surface conductivities closely matching those of pure iron oxide films. These results establish metal oxide infiltration as a scalable and low-cost strategy for controlling interfacial charge in polymer surfaces. The approach introduces new materials and design parameters for tailoring ion selectivity, transport, and energy conversion, with broad implications for the development of advanced membranes, electrokinetic harvesting devices, and polymer-supported oxide electrodes.

Title: Fluids at an electrostatically active surface: Optimum in interfacial friction and electrohydrodynamic drag
Authors: Cecilia Herrero, Lyderic Bocquet, Benoit Coasne
Abstract: While fluids near a solid surface are at the core of applications in energy storage/conversion, electrochemistry/electrowetting and adsorption/catalysis, their nanoscale behavior remains only partially deciphered. Beyond conventional effects (e.g. adsorption/reaction, interfacial transport, phase transition shifts), recent experimental and theoretical studies on metallic surfaces have unraveled exotic peculiarities such as complex electrostatic screening, unexpected wetting transition, and interfacial quantum friction. These novel features require developing and embarking new tools to tackle the coupling between charge relaxation in the metal and molecular behavior in the vicinal fluid. Here, using the concept of Virtual Thomas-Fermi fluids, we employ a molecular simulation approach to investigate interfacial transport of fluid molecules and metal charge carriers at their interface--including the underlying electrostatically-driven dynamic friction and the coupling between charge current/hydrodynamic flow (the so-called electrohydrodynamic drag). While conventional numerical techniques consider either insulating materials or metallic materials described as polarizable, non-conducting media, our atom-scale strategy provides an effective yet realistic description of the solid excitation spectrum--including charge relaxation modes and conductivity. By applying this approach to water near metallic surfaces of various electrostatic screening lengths, we unveil a non-monotonous dependence of the fluid/solid friction on the metallicity with a maximum occurring as the charge dynamic structure factors of the solid and fluid strongly overlap. Moreover, we report a direct observation of the electrohydrodynamic drag which arises from the momentum transfer between the solid and liquid through dynamic electrostatic interactions and the underlying interfacial friction.

Title: X-ray photo-induced atomic motion in Phase Change Materials and conventional covalent chalcogenide glasses
Authors: Irene Festi, Antoine Cornet, Tomoki Fujita, Jens Moesggard, Alberto Ronca, Jie Shen, Michael Sprung, Shuai Wei, Fabian Westermeier, Raphael Escalier, Andrea Piarristeguy, Giacomo Baldi, Beatrice Ruta
Abstract: X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (XPCS) enables direct access to atomic-scale dynamics in disordered materials, revealing both spontaneous and X-ray-induced relaxation processes. Here, we study two compositionally similar alloy glasses near their glass transition temperatures: the phase change material (PCM) Ge15Sb85 and the non-PCM alloy Ge15Te85. Both exhibit X-ray induced atomic motion, yet with markedly different responses. Ge15Sb85 undergoes an immediate transition to a photo-induced yielding state, characterised by stationary dynamics governed solely by the absorbed dose. In contrast, Ge15Te85 shows a progressive slowing-down of the relaxation process, accompanied by a crossover from compressed to stretched exponential decay in the density autocorrelation functions. This behaviour is consistent with the emergence of liquid-like collective motion as supported by de Gennes narrowing in the wave-vector dependence of the dynamics at length scales comparable with the first sharp diffraction peak. Unlike Ge15Sb85, this alloy does not reach a stationary regime within experimental timescales, implying that the yielding transition occurs only after thousands of seconds with the available dose rate. Its response is also temperature dependent: at lower temperatures, the dynamics reflects intrinsic stress relaxation processes, whereas at higher temperatures becomes dose-controlled. These findings demonstrate that the dynamical response to X-ray excitation is not determined solely by chemical composition or bonding character, but results from the interplay between irradiation effects and structural relaxation pathways.

Title: Influence of controlled disorder on the dipolar spin ice state of Ho-based pyrochlores
Authors: A.A. Aczel, B.R. Ortiz, Y. Luo, G. Pokharel, P.M. Sarte, C. dela Cruz, J. Liu, G. Sala, S.D. Wilson, B.A. Frandsen, J.A.M. Paddison
Abstract: Pyrochlore magnets of the form $R_2B_2$O$_7$, in which rare-earth ions on the $R$-site form a three-dimensional network of corner-sharing tetrahedra, provide a canonical setting for geometrical frustration. Ho-based pyrochlores host a dipolar spin-ice ground state, characterized by Ising moments constrained by the ice rules and elementary excitations analogous to magnetic monopoles. Here we examine how controlled chemical disorder influences this state by introducing site mixing on the non-magnetic $B$-site in two compounds. Ho$_2$GaSbO$_7$ contains only Ga$^{3+}$/Sb$^{5+}$ charge disorder, whereas Ho$_2$ScSbO$_7$ exhibits both charge and substantial size disorder arising from the large ionic-radius mismatch between Sc$^{3+}$ and Sb$^{5+}$. Although both materials retain the pyrochlore structure, neutron scattering measurements reveal a reduced correlation length for the $R/B$-site cation ordering and enhanced local structural distortions in Ho$_2$ScSbO$_7$. Despite these structural differences, bulk thermodynamic measurements and magnetic diffuse scattering demonstrate that both systems exhibit the defining signatures of a dipolar spin-ice state. Low-energy inelastic neutron spectroscopy further uncovers broad magnetic excitations that develop within the dipolar spin-ice regime, a feature absent in pristine Ho pyrochlores and indicative of disorder-induced splitting of the non-Kramers ground-state doublet. Together, these results show that controlled disorder generates tunable transverse-field-driven quantum fluctuations in Ho-based pyrochlores, although the dipolar spin-ice state is remarkably robust to this disorder.

Title: Tailoring phonon-driven responses in α-MoO3 through isotopic enrichment

Abstract: The implementation of polaritonic materials into nanoscale devices requires selective tuning of parameters to realize desired spectral or thermal responses. One robust material is {\alpha}-MoO3, which as an orthorhombic crystal boasts three distinct phonon dispersions, providing three polaritonic dispersions of hyperbolic phonon polaritons (HPhPs) across the mid-infrared (MIR). Here, the tunability of both optical and thermal responses in isotopically enriched {\alpha}-MoO3 (98MoO3, Mo18O3 and 98Mo18O3) are explored. A uniform ~5 % spectral redshift from 18O enrichment is observed in both Raman- and IR-active TO phonons. Both the in- and out-of-plane thermal conductivities for the isotopic variations are reported. Ab initio calculations both replicate experimental findings and analyze the select-mode three-phonon scattering contributions. The HPhPs from each isotopic variation are probed with s-SNOM and their Q- factors are reported. A Q-factor maxima increase of ~50 % along the [100] in the RB2 and ~100 % along the [001] in the RB3 are reported for HPhPs supported in 98Mo18O3. Observations in both real and Fourier space of higher-order HPhP modes propagating in single slabs of isotopically enriched {\alpha}-MoO3 without the use of a subdiffractional surface scatterer are presented here. This work illustrates the tunability of {\alpha}-MoO3 for thermal and nanophotonic applications.

Title: $\mathbb{Z}_L$ symmetry breaking in SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard dots at zero and finite temperature
Authors: Loïc Herviou, Elodie Campan, Pierre Nataf
Abstract: We address the SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard model on a chain, with $N$ the number of degenerate orbitals, or colors, for each fermion. In the limit of both large number of colors $N$ and particles, and small number of sites $L \geq 2$, the model is proved to undergo a $\mathbb{Z}_L$ symmetry breaking for attractive local interaction amplitude $U$. Using a combination of Exact Diagonalization with full SU(N) symmetry, generalized L-levels Holstein-Primakoff transformation, Hartree-Fock method and large-N saddle point approximation of the partition function, we extend the results obtained in [PRA 111, L020201 (2025)] to $L \geq 3$ and finite temperature $T>0$. In particular, we show that at $T=0$ for $U<U_c\sim -1/N$, the ground state is L-fold degenerate, while for positive temperatures, the critical temperature is both proportional to $N$ and $U$, i.e. $T_c \propto -U N$, making this phase transition particularly suitable for large-N fermions.

Title: Wafer-scale High-k SrTiO3 Dielectrics with Rational Barrier-layer Design for Low Leakage and High Charge Density
Authors: Majid Mohseni, Shivasheesh Varshney, Seung Gyo Jeong, Amber Walton, C. Daniel Frisbie, Bharat Jalan
Abstract: High-k oxides such as SrTiO3 promise large capacitance, but their dielectric response is often limited by leakage currents due to reduced bandgaps. We show that introducing a thin barrier layer beneath SrTiO3 is a simple and effective way to suppress leakage and increase charge density. Using hybrid molecular beam epitaxy, we grew uniform SrTiO3 films on Nb:SrTiO3, CaSnO3/Nb:SrTiO3, and 2-inch SiO2/p-Si stacks to directly compare how different barrier layers influence device behavior. Both CaSnO3 and SiO2 reduce leakage, but the ultra-wide-bandgap SiO2 layer enables much higher operating voltages, yielding charge densities exceeding 5x10^13 cm^-2 at room temperature - more than a fivefold enhancement compared to devices without a barrier layer. This improvement comes with a predictable trade-off: the lower dielectric constant of SiO2 reduces overall capacitance, making its thickness an important design parameter. Together, these results demonstrate that rational barrier-layer engineering - including wafer-scale integration on Si - provides a clear pathway to achieving higher charge densities in SrTiO3-based dielectric devices.

Title: Contact resistance and interfacial engineering: Advances in high-performance 2D-TMD based devices
Authors: Xiongfang Liu, Kaijian Xing, Chi Sin Tang, Shuo Sun, Pan Chen, Dong-Chen Qi, Mark B. H. Breese, Michael S. Fuhrer, Andrew T. S. Wee, Xinmao Yin
Abstract: The development of advanced electronic devices is contingent upon sustainable material development and pioneering research breakthroughs. Traditional semiconductor-based electronic technology faces constraints in material thickness scaling and energy efficiency. Atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have emerged as promising candidates for next-generation nanoelectronics and optoelectronic applications, boasting high electron mobility, mechanical strength, and a customizable band gap. Despite these merits, the Fermi level pinning effect introduces uncontrollable Schottky barriers at metal-2D-TMD contacts, challenging prediction through the Schottky-Mott rule. These barriers fundamentally lead to elevated contact resistance and limited current-delivery capability, impeding the enhancement of 2D-TMD transistor and integrated circuit properties. In this review, we succinctly outline the Fermi pinning effect mechanism and peculiar contact resistance behavior at metal/2D-TMD interfaces. Subsequently, highlights on the recent advances in overcoming contact resistance in 2D-TMDs devices, encompassing interface interaction and hybridization, van der Waals (vdW) contacts, prefabricated metal transfer and charge-transfer doping will be addressed. Finally, the discussion extends to challenges and offers insights into future developmental prospects.

Title: Integrated magnonic chip using cascaded logic
Authors: Mengying Guo, Xudong Jing, Kristýna Davídková, Roman Verba, Zhenyu Zhou, Xueyu Guo, Carsten Dubs, Yiheng Rao, Kaiming Cai, Jing Li, Philipp Pirro, Andrii V. Chumak, Qi Wang
Abstract: The transistor transformed not only electronics but everyday life, and the integrated circuit - now simply the "chip" - made computation scalable and ubiquitous. Magnonics has long promised a parallel path to low-energy information processing by using spin waves instead of charge. Progress, however, has been limited by two fundamental obstacles: intrinsic attenuation of spin waves and the requirement for precisely normalised output intensity and input phase to ensure reliable logic operation - conditions that are difficult to maintain in large-scale circuits owing to inevitable imperfections. Here, we report an integrated magnonic circuit that overcomes both limitations through engineered nonlinearity in nanoscale yttrium iron garnet waveguides. Nonlinear self-adjustment of the spin wave phase renders logic operation insensitive to the relative phases of the inputs, while a deeply nonlinear, threshold-activated self-normalised excitation restores and standardises the output intensity. Using space-resolved micro-focused Brillouin light scattering, we demonstrate reconfigurable AND, OR and three-input majority gates and realise deterministic cascading across sequential stages, establishing a scalable on-chip logic primitive. The architecture operates with gigahertz frequencies, supports dynamic threshold control for functional reconfiguration, and is compatible with scalable integration, making it attractive for adaptive and neuromorphic computing. By resolving phase-independent operation and signal restoration at the level of device physics, this work advances magnonics from isolated proof-of-concept devices towards integrated magnonic chips that can complement advanced CMOS in energy-constrained computing tasks.

Title: Electronic band structure reconstruction in Ni$_{x}$ZrTe$_{2}$
Authors: Pedro H. A. Moya, Marli R. Cantarino, Lucas E. Correa, Leandro R. de Faria, Rodrigo M. C. Huamani, Wendell S. Silva, Claude Monney, Antonio J. S. Machado, Fernando A. Garcia
Abstract: The filling of the large van der Waals gap in Transition Metal Dichalcogenides (TMDs) often leads to lattice and electronic instabilities, which prelude the onset of a rich phenomenology. Here, we investigate the electronic structure of the TMDs ZrTe$_2$ and Ni-intercalated ZrTe$_2$ (Ni$_x$ZrTe$_2$, $x\approx 0.05$) employing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). We readily identify in Ni$_x$ZrTe$_2$ two flat bands, most likely associated with localized Ni-derived 3$d$-states, at about $\approx-0.7$ eV and $\approx-1.2$ eV in binding energy. The presence of these flat bands is observed for all temperatures ($T$) in our study. More significantly, at low-$T$, we identify an electronic structure reconstruction in Ni$_x$ZrTe$_2$, which halves the electronic periodicity along the $k_{z}$ direction. This is reminiscent of a commensurate band folding with wave-vector $q=(0,0,\pi)$. Together with previous results from macroscopic measurements, namely heat capacity and resistivity, our findings suggest that Ni intercalation drives a structural instability at $T^{*}=287$ K, which causes the observed electronic band reconstruction. Our findings invite further investigation into the structural properties of ZrTe$_2$ and of the intercalated and defect-engineered versions of this material.

Title: Thermalized buckling of extensible, semiflexible polymers
Authors: Richard Huang, David R. Nelson, Suraj Shankar
Abstract: The Euler buckling of rods is a long-studied mechanical instability, and it remains relevant to this day, as the constituent components in many biological and physical systems are linear polymers, such as microtubules or carbon nanotubes. At finite temperature, if a polymer is shorter than its persistence length, the polymer is semiflexible, and its elasticity remains rod-like. But polymers can also stretch due to their finite extensibility, which can couple to energetically cheap bending deformations in nonlinear ways when a load is applied to the system. We show how the interplay between thermal fluctuations and nonlinear elasticity dramatically modifies the Euler buckling instability for compressed semiflexible polymers in a fixed strain ensemble. We identify a Ginzburg-like length scale beyond which thermally excited undulations lead to a softened Young's modulus, while the polymer nevertheless remains semiflexible. Both perturbative calculations and numerical Monte Carlo simulations suggest a qualitative change in several scaling properties of the buckling transition. The critical compressional strain for thermal buckling now increases with system size, in contrast to athermal buckling, where it decreases with system size. Renormalization group calculations confirm this picture, and also show that thermal buckling is controlled by a new fixed point with different critical exponents compared to classical Euler buckling.

Title: Cellular wrapping of elastic particles by a supported lipid membrane
Authors: Amir Khosravanizadeh, Pierre Sens, Farshid Mohammad-Rafiee
Abstract: Constancy of life vitally depends on the internalization of particles through biomembranes. Of particular interest, cellular uptake, including phagocytosis, receptor-mediated endocytosis, and membrane fusion, critically depends on the elasticity of particles. Cellular membranes are strongly linked to a supporting cytoskeleton. However, in most previous studies, the effect of this cortical network somehow is overlooked. In this paper, we study the cellular wrapping of a membrane around a 2D elastic particle in the presence of a substrate mimicking cytoskeleton. Our simulations show that the impact of particle flexibility on the wrapping process depends on the magnitude of the membrane particle adhesion. In contrast, the extent of membrane protrusions formed around the target always increases with target stiffness. Since the extension of membrane protrusions is an essential step in the phagocytosis process, this result may indicate a selective behavior of macrophages in the phagocytosis of aged red blood cells.

Title: Realization of a universal topological waveguide by tuning adiabatic geometry
Authors: Keita Funayama, Jotaro J. Nakane, Ai Yamakage
Abstract: Quantum valley Hall-based topological phases have been attracting attention across diverse fields as a robust platform for wave guidance due to their high compatibility with engineering frameworks. Combining three representative boundary types enables topological waveguides with flexible designability and enhanced functionality. However, one of the three, namely the armchair boundary, has long been limited by inter-valley scattering, resulting in weak topological protection and severely restricting its use in practical devices. This long-standing constraint is a major barrier to realizing broadly applicable topological waveguide systems. Here, to address this challenge toward a broadly applicable design framework for topological waveguides, we experimentally demonstrate that topological adiabatic geometry implemented in a micro electromechanical system suppresses valley mixing. We found that the adiabaticity enhances immunity to defects and increases the transmission efficiency of the armchair boundary. As the adiabaticity increases, topological protection is recovered over an increasingly broad portion of the bulk band gap, extending from low to high frequencies. Furthermore, we show that the recovery of protection in the adiabatic armchair boundary enables waves to propagate through 90^° and 150^°-bent waveguides by coupling with other interface geometries. Suppressing valley mixing via adiabaticity paves the way for a universal design framework for topological waveguides and for restoring robust topological characteristics across a wide range of wave phenomena.

Title: Efficient Screening of Organic Singlet Fission Molecules Using Graph Neural Networks
Authors: Li Fu, Longfei Lv, Fan Zhang, Si Zhou, Weiwei Gao, Jijun Zhao
Abstract: Singlet fission (SF) provides a promising strategy for surpassing the Shockley-Queisser limit in photovoltaics. However, the identification of efficient SF materials is hindered by the limited availability of suitable molecular candidates and the high computational costs associated with conventional quantum-chemical methods for excited states. In this study, we introduce a high-throughput screening framework that integrates a graph neural network (GNN) with multi-level validation to accelerate the discovery of SF-active molecules. Trained on a previously reported FORMED database, the GNN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in predicting SF-relevant excited-state properties, demonstrating a mean absolute error of about 0.1 eV for S1, T1, and T2 excitation energies. This capability facilitates the efficient screening of over 20 million molecular structures from both OE62 and QO2Mol databases. Our framework significantly reduces the computational demand associated with Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory validation by four orders of magnitude and identifies 180 potential SF molecules along with more than 1000 conformers. Subsequent assessments regarding synthetic accessibility, GW approximation and Bethe-Salpeter equation calculations further highlight a subset of experimentally feasible candidates among these SF candidates. The approach presented herein exemplifies an effective strategy for accelerating the discovery of functional molecules with optoelectronic applications.

Title: Stable boundary modes for fragile topology from spontaneous PT-symmetry breaking
Authors: Kang Yang, Fei Song, Piet W. Brouwer
Abstract: Two-dimensional topological insulators protected by nonlocal symmetries or with fragile topology usually do not admit robust in-gap edge modes due to the incompatibility between the symmetry and the boundary. Here, we show that in a parity-time (PT) symmetric system robust in-gap topological edge modes can be stably induced by non-Hermitian couplings that spontaneously break the PT symmetry of the eigenstates. The topological edge modes traverse the imaginary spectral gap between a pair of fragile topological bands, which is opened by the presence of the non-Hermitian perturbation. We demonstrate that the net number of resulting in-gap modes is protected by an operator version of anomaly cancellation that extends beyond the Hermitian limit. The results imply that loss and gain can in principle drive fragile topological phenomena to stable topological phenomena.

Title: Universal coarsening of a two-dimensional Bose gas under conservative evolution
Authors: Andrew J. Groszek, Thomas P. Billam
Abstract: We investigate the phase ordering dynamics of a uniform two-dimensional Bose gas quenched to a finite temperature in the superfluid phase. Starting from a defect-rich, far-from-equilibrium state, we model the subsequent evolution with the projected Gross-Pitaevskii equation, which conserves both energy and particle number. By tuning the initial energy, we control the effective post-quench temperature and examine its role in the equilibration dynamics. We find that the gas exhibits universal behaviour at all temperatures, evidenced by spatio-temporal scaling of correlation functions and power-law growth of the correlation length $\sim t^{1/z}$, with $z$ the dynamical critical exponent. We find $z$ to be temperature dependent, with $z \approx 1.5$ for post-quench temperatures just below the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition, and $z \approx 1.9$ for quenches to near-zero temperature. Analysis of the Porod tail of the momentum distribution suggests a temperature-dependent competition between vortices and sound waves in the coarsening process. The two-time correlation function also exhibits universal scaling, decaying as $\sim t^{-\lambda/z}$, with autocorrelation exponent $\lambda$. Near the BKT transition we obtain $\lambda \approx 2$, whereas $\lambda$ is found to diverge as the effective temperature approaches zero.

Title: Protein-Water Energy Transfer via Anharmonic Low-Frequency Vibrations
Authors: Brandon Neff, Matthias Heyden
Abstract: Heat dissipation is ubiquitous in living systems, which constantly convert distinct forms of energy into each other. The transport of thermal energy in liquids and even within proteins is well understood but kinetic energy transfer across a heterogeneous molecular boundary provides additional challenges. Here, we use atomistic molecular dynamics simulations under steady-state conditions to analyze how a protein dissipates surplus thermal energy into the surrounding solvent. We specifically focus on collective degrees of freedom that govern the dynamics of the system from the diffusive regime to mid-infrared frequencies. Using a fully anharmonic analysis of molecular vibrations, we analyzed their vibrational spectra, temperatures, and heat transport efficiencies. We find that the most efficient energy transfer mechanisms are associated with solvent-mediated friction. However, this mechanism only applies to a small number of degrees of freedom of a protein. Instead, less efficient vibrational energy transfer in the far-infrared dominates heat transfer overall due to a large number of vibrations in this frequency range. A notable by-product of this work is a highly sensitive measure of deviations from energy equi-partition in equilibrium systems, which can be used to analyze non-ergodic properties.

Title: Energy-Resolved Real-Space Imaging of Orbital Nematicity in an Fe-Based Superconductor
Authors: Asato Onishi, Zifan Xu, Cédric Bareille, Yoichi Kageyama, Shigeyuki Ishida, Hiroshi Eisaki, Kota Ishihara, Kenichiro Hashimoto, Toshiyuki Taniuchi, Takasada Shibauchi
Abstract: Electronic nematicity in Fe-based superconductors is manifested by spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking and the formation of nematic domains with mutually orthogonal directions of $d_{xz}$/$d_{yz}$ orbital anisotropy. However, its energy dependence has remained largely unexplored in real space. Using 5.82-eV laser-excited photoemission electron microscopy (laser-PEEM) with an energy-selective slit, we visualize the evolution of linear dichroic (LD) contrast within individual nematic domains of Ba$_{1-x}$Na$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$ ($x\approx0.08$). We discover a sign reversal of the LD contrast at an energy $\sim0.4$ eV below the Fermi level, directly revealing an inversion of orbital anisotropy inside each domain. This behavior reflects a different energy-dependent redistribution of spectral weight between the $d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$ states, highlighting the crucial role of orbital-selective coherence in the nematic phase of Fe-based superconductors.

Title: Intrinsic Step Jamming in Nanometer-Scale KPZ-like Rough Surfaces under Interface-Limited Crystal Growth and Retreat
Authors: Noriko Akutsu, Yoshihiro Kangawa
Abstract: We investigate an intrinsic step-jamming phenomenon at the nanometer scale on Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ)-like kinetically roughened crystal surfaces that arises during interface-limited steady crystal growth or retreat. Monte Carlo simulations using the Metropolis algorithm on a restricted solid-on-solid (RSOS) lattice model demonstrate that intrinsic step jamming persists on surfaces below 20 nm. In the present model, transport processes such as surface and volume diffusion are excluded, as are elastic interactions, step-step repulsion or attraction, and stoichiometric effects. We show that intrinsic step jamming arises from asymmetric fluctuations in atomic attachment and detachment driven by biased transition probabilities under the SOS restriction, leading to collective step congestion. Asymmetric fluctuations also determine whether adatom or hole clusters grow or recede. This mechanism bears close similarity to jamming phenomena in the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP), including multi-lane variants. In contrast, symmetric thermal fluctuations generate adatom or hole clusters on terraces, thereby suppressing intrinsic step jamming. Possible routes to suppress intrinsic step jamming, including experimentally accessible strategies, are also discussed.

Title: Anisotropic Kinetics of Ion-Irradiation-Induced Phase Transition in Gallium Oxide
Authors: Taiqiao Liu, Tongtong Wang, Zeyuan Li, E Zhou, Junlei Zhao, Jiaren Feng, Xiaoyu Fei, Yuzheng Guo, Flyura Djurabekova, Sheng Liu, Zhaofu Zhang
Abstract: Radiation-tolerant semiconductors have traditionally been engineered by the principle of suppressing defect accumulation and amorphization, based on the assumption that radiation damage is inherently stochastic. Here we show that, in monoclinic $\beta$-\ce{Ga2O3}, a promising ultrawide-bandgap semiconductor, surface crystallographic orientation deterministically governs radiation tolerance through highly anisotropic kinetics of the $\beta$-to-$\gamma$ phase transition. Using machine-learning molecular dynamics coupled with a local configurational-entropy descriptor, we quantitatively map anisotropic $\beta$-to-$\gamma$ transition kinetics, showing that the critical dose, transition-layer depth, and kinetic stability of the $\gamma$-phase are fundamentally governed by surface orientation. Under ion irradiation, non-channeling surfaces such as (100), (001), and (-201) undergo severe surface amorphization, whereas the strongly channeling (010) surface resists damage accumulation and promotes subsurface $\gamma$-phase nucleation. During thermal annealing recovery process, these initial states follow two distinct recovery pathways: the channeling (010) surface reverts directly from $\gamma$-to-$\beta$, whereas non-channeling surfaces follow a sequential amorphous-to-$\gamma$-to-$\beta$ transition pathway. This work establishes surface orientation as a fundamental design principle for achieving radiation tolerance through controlled polymorphic transitions, providing a universal framework for engineering functional materials capable of withstanding extreme irradiation environments.

Title: Transformation Journey of Zr-based MOFs: Study on Mechanics and Hydrogen Storage under Doping Regulation
Authors: Yanhuai Ding, Dan Qian, Zhipeng Liu
Abstract: This study delves into the transformation journey of Zr-based Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs), focusing on enhancing their mechanical properties and hydrogen storage capacities through doping regulation. MOFs, a versatile class of crystalline porous materials, have garnered significant attention due to their unique properties and broad potential applications in gas storage, separation, catalysis, and sensing. Among them, Zr-based MOFs stand out for their exceptional stability and high surface area. This research systematically investigates six key Zr-based MOFs (UIO-66, UIO-67, UIO-68, MOF-801, MOF-802, and MOF-841) using multiscale computational methods, including molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations, and density functional theory (DFT). The study explores the impact of metal ion substitution (Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) on the mechanical and hydrogen storage properties of these MOFs. Our findings reveal that metal ion substitution significantly influences the mechanical stability and hydrogen adsorption capacity of Zr-based MOFs, providing valuable insights for the design and optimization of high-performance MOF materials.

Title: Inverse magnetic melting effect in vdW-like Kondo lattice CeSn$_{0.75}$Sb$_2$
Authors: Hai Zeng, Yiwei Chen, Zhuo Wang, Shuo Zou, Kangjian Luo, Yang Yuan, Meng Zhang, Yongkang Luo
Abstract: Given the intimate connection between magnetic orders and the interplay among multiple degrees of freedom in heavy-fermion systems, controlling and understanding the associated inverse melting effect is crucial for unveiling novel condensed-matter states and their potential applications. Here, we report the growth of single crystalline quasi-two-dimensional van-der-Waals-like Kondo lattice CeSn$_{0.75}$Sb$_2$, and its physical properties by a combination of transport / magnetic / thermodynamic measurements. We find that it hosts a fragile antiferromagnetic (AFM) order and a cluster glass (CG) ground state, both of which are highly sensitive to external fields. Upon cooling under low in-plane magnetic fields, the AFM phase evolves into a polarized paramagnetic phase, either directly or indirectly through the intermediate CG phase. This process constitutes an inverse magnetic melting effect that restores the broken translational / rotational symmetries. Our work provides a rare paradigm of inverse magnetic melting effect in vdW-like heavy-fermion materials, and enriches the physics in conventional Kondo-lattice models.

Title: Anomalous Hall transport in Mn$_{3}$Sn$_{0.5}$X$_{0.5}$C (X = Ge and Zn)
Authors: Sunil Gangwar, C. S. Yadav
Abstract: Mn-based antiperovskites that exhibit topological surface states show potential applications in spintronics, magnetoelectronics, and quantum devices owing to the interplay between magnetism and topology. In this family of compounds, Mn$3$SnC exhibits a concurrent ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic ground state below $T \sim 285$ K, along with a Berry curvature driven anomalous Hall effect. Here, we report the anomalous Hall effect in Ge- and Zn-doped Mn$3$SnC compounds, namely Mn$3$Sn${0.5}$Ge${0.5}$C (MSGC) and Mn$3$Sn${0.5}$Zn${0.5}$C (MSZC). MSGC undergoes a paramagnetic to concurrent antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic transition at $T_C \sim 300$ K, whereas MSZC exhibits a paramagnetic to ferromagnetic transition at $T_C \sim 240$ K, followed by a ferromagnetic to ferrimagnetic transition at $T_N \sim 170$ K. The electronic transport in these compounds is governed by electron-phonon and electron-magnon scattering and shows anomalous Hall resistivity $\rho^A_{xy}$. Our analysis indicates that the anomalous Hall effect arises from contributions of skew scattering and intrinsic Berry curvature mechanisms, with electron-phonon and electron-magnon scattering playing an important role in skew scattering at high temperatures. Ge and Zn doping in Mn$_3$SnC significantly enhances the anomalous Hall conductivity.

Title: Hybrid Disclination Skin-topological Effects in Non-Hermitian Circuits
Authors: Boyuan Li, Zekun Huang, Wenao Wang, Jiaxi Wang, Yu Chen, Ce Shang, Tie Jun Cui, Shuo Liu
Abstract: The bulk-disclination correspondence (BDC) is a fundamental concept in Hermitian systems that has been widely applied to predict disclination states. Recently, disclination states have also been observed and experimentally verified in non-Hermitian systems with C6 lattice symmetry, where gain and loss are introduced to induce non-Hermiticity. In this Letter, we propose a non-Hermitian two-dimensional (2D) Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) disclination model with skin-topological (ST) disclination states, and calculate its biorthogonal Zak phase. Together with the real-space disclination index, we predict the emergence of disclination states in a C4-symmetric non-Hermitian lattice and the corresponding fractional charge. We also generalize the symmetry indicator within the biorthogonal framework to predict the anomalous filling near the disclination core. Experimentally, the model is implemented on a nonreciprocal circuit platform, where we analyze the impedance matrix characterized by complex eigenfrequencies and directly observe the ST disclination states. Our work further extends the bulk-disclination correspondence to the non-Hermitian realm.

Title: Interplay of Structure and Dynamics in Solid Polymer Electrolytes: a Molecular Dynamics Study of LiPF6/polypropylene carbonate
Authors: Amaury Coste, Thomas Meyer, Claire Villevielle, Fannie Alloin, Stefano Mossa, Benoit Coasne
Abstract: Solid-state batteries (SSB) are emerging as next-generation electrochemical energy storage devices. Achieving high energy density in SSB relies on solid polymer electrolytes (SPE) that are electrochemically stable against both lithium metal and high-potential positive electrodes, two conditions that are difficult to satisfy without chemical degradation. In this work, molecular dynamics simulations are employed to investigate the relationship between structure and dynamics in carbonate-based SPE composed of polypropylene carbonate and lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF$_6$), at salt concentrations ranging from 0.32 to 1.21 mol$/$kg. Structural properties are analyzed under ambient pressure at the experimentally relevant temperature $T = 353$ K. Since the slow dynamical processes governing ion transport in these systems are inaccessible to direct molecular dynamics, transport properties are simulated at elevated temperatures up to 900 K and extrapolated to $T = 353$ K using Arrhenius behavior. The results reveal strong ionic correlations, a limited fraction of free ions, and a predominance of negatively charged clusters, especially at high salt concentration. At high temperature, the self-diffusion coefficient of Li$^+$ exceeds that of PF$_6^-$ due to weaker Li$^+$-carbonate and ion-ion interactions. However, at $T = 353$ K, Li$^+$ mobility becomes lower than that of the anion, consistent with typical experimental observations in SPE. As expected, the ionic conductivity $\sigma$ increases with temperature, while at $T = 353$ K it exhibits a maximum for salt concentrations between 1.0 and 1.1 mol$/$kg. Overall, the estimated physico-chemical parameters highlight the key role of ion correlations in SPE and suggest strategies to optimize electrolyte performance. The Arrhenius extrapolation approach used here provides valuable insight into ion transport mechanisms in solid polymer electrolytes.

Title: Observation of spin-valley locked nodal lines in a quasi-2D altermagnet

Abstract: The interplay among quantum degrees of freedom-spin, orbital and momentum-has emerged as a fertile ground for realizing magnetic quantum states with transformative potential for electronic and spintronic technologies. Prominent examples include ferromagnetic Weyl semimetals and antiferromagnetic axion insulators. Recently, altermagnets(AMs) have been identified as a distinct spin-splitting class of collinear antiferromagnets(AFMs), characterized by crystal symmetry that connects magnetic sublattices in real space and enforces C-paired spin-momentum locking in reciprocal space. These materials combine the advantages of nonrelativistic spin-polarization akin to FMs and vanished net-magnetization as AFMs, making them highly promising for spintronic applications. Furthermore, they introduce nontrivial spin-momentum locking spin texture as an additional degree of freedom for realizing novel quantum phases. In this work, we report the discovery of a new type of spin-valley-locked nodal line phase in the layered AM Rb-intercalated V{_2}Te{_2}O. By combining high-resolution spin and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with first-principles calculations, we observe the coexistence of both spinless and spinful nodal lines near the Fermi level. Remarkably, the spinful nodal lines exhibit uniform spin polarization within each valley, while displaying opposite spin polarizations across symmetry-paired valleys-a unique feature we term spin-valley-locked nodal lines, which is exclusive to AMs. Direct measurements of out-of-plane band dispersion using a side-cleaving technique reveal the two-dimensional nature of these nodal lines. Our findings not only unveil a previously unexplored topological phase in AMs where valley-locked spin as an additional quantum character but also establish RbV{_2}Te{_2}O as a promising platform for spintronics, valleytronics, and moire-engineered quantum devices.

Title: Strain Engineering of Intrinsic Anomalous Hall and Nernst Effects in Altermagnetic MnTe at Realistic Doping Levels
Authors: Weiwei Chen, Ziyu Zhou, Jie Meng, Weiyi Wang, Ye Yang, Zhongjun Li
Abstract: Hexagonal MnTe has emerged as a prototypical g-wave altermagnet, hosting time-reversal symmetry breaking in momentum space despite a vanishing net magnetization. While this symmetry breaking theoretically allows for an intrinsic anomalous Hall effect, experimentally observed signals have remained weak. In this work, we investigate the origin of this suppression and demonstrate a strategy to amplify anomalous transport responses within the experimentally accessible doping regime. Using a $\bm{k}\cdot\bm{p}$ effective model, we reveal that near the valence band maximum, which corresponds to the energy window relevant for typical hole doping ($\sim10^{19}cm^{-3}$), the intrinsic Hall effect is suppressed due to a symmetry-enforced cancellation of opposing Berry curvature contributions. We propose that breaking the crystalline symmetry via volume-conserving biaxial strain lifts this cancellation, resulting in a significant enhancement of the anomalous Hall conductivity by orders of magnitude. This strain-induced Fermi surface distortion also amplifies the anomalous Nernst effect. Furthermore, the analysis of the spin texture confirms that these strain-enabled anomalous transport signatures emerge while preserving the zero net magnetization.

Title: Surface reconstruction-driven band folding and spin-orbit enhancement at the $α$-antimonene/Au(111) interface
Authors: Thomas Pierron, José de Jesùs Villalobos Castro, Etienne Barre, Dan Wang, Stephane Pons, Dimitri Roditchev, Azzedine Bendounan, Valerie Guisset, Philippe David, Johann Coraux, Lorenzo Sponza, Sergio Vlaic
Abstract: The electronic properties of the two-dimensional (2D) $\alpha$ phase of antimonene are unique, featuring unpinned Dirac cones that can be moved with strain. Here we investigate the structural and electronic properties of an epitaxial 2D $\alpha$-antimonene, grown on Au(111). Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density-functional theory, we reveal a strong hybridization at the Sb/Au interface, which imprints a rectangular reconstruction in the Au states, producing a band folding and hybrid bands exhibiting trigonal pockets. Additionally, hybridization displaces part of the Au wavefunction in regions of large electrostatic potential gradient, thereby enhancing spin-orbit splitting. Our work underscores that the pristine electronic properties of $\alpha$-antimonene may be deeply modified by its substrate, and even overwhelmed by the bands of the latter, and also shows that spin-orbit interaction in a heavy metal (Au) can be substantially enhanced by a lighter element (Sb).

Title: Data-driven Reduction of Transfer Operators for Particle Clustering Dynamics
Authors: Nathalie Wehlitz, Grigorios A. Pavliotis, Christof Schütte, Stefanie Winkelmann
Abstract: We develop an operator-based framework to coarse-grain interacting particle systems that exhibit clustering dynamics. Starting from the particle-based transfer operator, we first construct a sequence of reduced representations: the operator is projected onto concentrations and then further reduced by representing the concentration dynamics on a geometric low-dimensional manifold and an adapted finite-state discretization. The resulting coarse-grained transfer operator is finally estimated from dynamical simulation data by inferring the transition probabilities between the Markov states. Applied to systems with multichromatic and Morse interaction potentials, the reduced model reproduces key features of the clustering process, including transitions between cluster configurations and the emergence of metastable states. Spectral analysis and transition-path analysis of the estimated operator reveal implied time scales and dominant transition pathways, providing an interpretable and efficient description of particle-clustering dynamics.

Title: ESR Investigations of the Magnetic Anisotropy in $κ$-(BETS)$_2$Mn[N(CN)$_{2}$]$_3$
Authors: Zhijie Huang, Marvin Schmidt, Savita Priya, Mark Kartsovnik, Natalia Kushch, Martin Dressel
Abstract: The two-dimensional molecular conductor $\kappa$-(BETS)$_2$Mn[N(CN)$_2$]$_3$ has been studied because of the intriguing magnetic coupling of the molecular $\pi$-electrons to the Mn$^{2+}$ ions. Utilizing X-band electron spin resonance spectroscopy we have performed comprehensive investigations of the magnetic properties, in particular on the temperature and angular dependences of the spin susceptibility, the $g$-factor and the linewidth. Due to the $\pi$-$d$-coupling, a rearrangement of the $\pi$-spins occurs: At low temperatures the $g$-factor shifts enormously with a pronounced in-plane anisotropy that flips as the temperature decreases; the lines broaden significantly; and the spin susceptibility increases upon cooling with a kink at the phase transition. By carefully analyzing the angular dependence of $g(\theta)$ and $\Delta H(\theta)$ we reveal the influence of anisotropic Zeeman interaction in addition to spin-phonon coupling. We conclude the presence of two magnetically distinct BETS chains and discuss the possibility of altermagnetic order.

Title: DeepH-pack: A general-purpose neural network package for deep-learning electronic structure calculations

Abstract: In computational physics and materials science, first-principles methods, particularly density functional theory, have become central tools for electronic structure prediction and materials design. Recently, rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have begun to reshape the research landscape, giving rise to the emerging field of deep-learning electronic structure calculations. Despite numerous pioneering studies, the field remains in its early stages; existing software implementations are often fragmented, lacking unified frameworks and standardized interfaces required for broad community adoption. Here we present DeepH-pack, a comprehensive and unified software package that integrates first-principles calculations with deep learning. By incorporating fundamental physical principles into neural-network design, such as the nearsightedness principle and the equivariance principle, DeepH-pack achieves robust cross-scale and cross-material generalizability. This allows models trained on small-scale structures to generalize to large-scale and previously unseen materials. The toolkit preserves first-principles accuracy while accelerating electronic structure calculations by several orders of magnitude, establishing an efficient and intelligent computational paradigm for large-scale materials simulation, high-throughput materials database construction, and AI-driven materials discovery.

Title: Charge Density Wave Order and Superconductivity in Janus MoXH Monolayers
Authors: Jakkapat Seeyangnok, Udomsilp Pinsook, Graeme J Ackland
Abstract: Two-dimensional Janus hydrogenated transition metal chalcogenides provide an unusual platform where lattice instabilities, electron-phonon coupling, and superconductivity are strongly intertwined. Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that Janus 2H and 1T MoXH (X = S, Se) monolayers host an intrinsic, commensurate charge density wave (CDW) ground state originating from soft phonon modes at the Brillouin zone M point. Real-space supercell optimizations confirm that the CDW reconstruction lowers the total energy and fully stabilizes the lattice, eliminating the imaginary phonon modes present in the high-symmetry metallic structures. Analysis of the electronic susceptibility shows that the CDW instability is not driven by Fermi surface nesting, but instead arises from strong electron-phonon coupling. We further reveal a material-dependent interplay between CDW order and superconductivity. In 1T MoSH, CDW formation enhances low-energy phonon contributions and strengthens electron-phonon coupling, leading to an increased superconducting transition temperature. In contrast, for 1T MoSeH and 2H MoSeH, the CDW phase suppresses electron-phonon coupling and reduces superconductivity. Finally, we show that thermal fluctuations, compressive strain, and carrier doping can selectively suppress CDW order and restore superconductivity. These results establish Janus MoXH monolayers as a tunable two-dimensional system for exploring lattice-driven charge ordering and its competition with superconductivity.

Title: Soliton Pumping in the Rice-Mele Model with On-Cell Kerr Nonlinearity
Authors: Zhe Wang, Xi-Wang Luo, Bo-Ye Sun, Zheng-Wei Zhou
Abstract: We investigate the Rice-Mele model with on-cell Kerr-type nonlinearities, where the interaction depends on the total particle number within each unit cell rather than on individual sites. This interaction enables a nontrivial interplay between topology and nonlinear dynamics in soliton pumping. In the weakly interacting regime, the ground-state soliton undergoes quantized Thouless pumping. At intermediate interaction strengths, soliton creation and annihilation break adiabaticity and disrupt quantized transport. In the strong-coupling regime, the coexistence of ground- and excited-state solitons leads to negligible coupling at energy crossings, giving rise to discrete time-translation symmetry breaking (DTTSB) in the soliton dynamics. Comparison of mean-field results with exact diagonalization along closed circular pumping paths confirms both the validity of the mean-field description and the robustness of DTTSB across different pumping trajectories. Our findings reveal how interaction-induced effects can fundamentally modify topological transport and suggest that these phenomena may be explored in cold-atom, photonic, and superconducting-circuit platforms.

Abstract: Recent experiments have established rare earth A15 type hydrides as a distinct family of high temperature superconductors that can be stabilized at significantly lower pressures compared to other superconducting hydrides. In particular, A15 type LaH5.75 was recently shown to be a high Tc superconductor. We have investigated a range of ternary substitutions and demonstrate that partial substitution of La by Ba stabilizes the A15 hydride lattice, with La0.75Ba0.25H5.75 identified as a stable compound. We calculate a superconducting transition temperature of approximately 183 K, almost double that of LaH5.75 at similar pressures. Ba typically acts as a 2 plus ion, while La is 3 plus. The reduced electron count disrupts the formation of H2 units and shifts the Fermi surface, leading to strongly enhanced electron phonon coupling. By contrast, substitution with Hf fails to produce any stable compounds. This work extends emerging alloy design principles in A15 hydride superconductors, demonstrating that doping can shift the Fermi level and tune the strength of the electron phonon coupling. These results provide concrete guidance for the experimental realization of new high Tc phases.

Title: Electron pairing in model with two overlapping bands
Authors: Igor N. Karnaukhov
Abstract: We consider the two-band Hubbard model, where electrons from different bands interact through an on-site one- and two-particle hybridization. The proposed Hamiltonian makes it possible to construct an effective theory and answer the question of the nature of pairing: conduction electrons form pairs due to two-particle hybridization of electrons from different bands, compensating for the direct Hubbard repulsion between conduction electrons. It is shown that an effective attraction between conduction electrons leads to $\eta$-pairing. The electron-electron pairing mechanism explains the presence of superconductivity at high temperatures experimentally observed in hydrogen-rich materials at high pressure.

Title: Many-electron systems with fractional electron number and spin: exact properties above and below the equilibrium total spin value
Authors: Yuli Goshen, Eli Kraisler
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the fundamental question of what is the ensemble ground state of a general, finite, many-electron system at zero temperature, with a given, possibly fractional, electron number $N_{tot}$ and a given $z$-projection of the spin, $M_{tot}$, distinguishing between low- and high-spin cases. For the low-spin case, the general form of the ensemble ground state has been rigorously derived in J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 15, 2337 (2024), finding the presence of an ambiguity in the ground state. Here we further discuss this ambiguity, and show that it can be removed via maximization of the entropy. For the high-spin case, we find that the form of the ensemble ground state strongly depends on the system in question. Furthermore, we prove three general properties which characterize the ensemble, and narrow the list of pure states it may consist of. We relate the frontier Kohn-Sham orbital energies to total energy differences, providing a generalization of the ionization potential theorem to systems with arbitrary fractional $M_{tot}$. Furthermore, we derive expressions for new derivative discontinuities, which appear as jumps in the KS potentials when crossing a boundary in the $N_{\uparrow}$-$N_{\downarrow}$ plane. Our analytical results are supported by an extensive numerical analysis of the Atomic Spectra Database of the National Institute of Standards. The new exact conditions for many-electron systems derived in this work are instrumental for development of advanced approximations in density functional theory and other many-electron methods.

Title: Multiscale Experimental Evidence of a Transitory State in the HDA-LDA Transition in Alumino-sodo-silicate Glasses
Authors: Antoine Cornet, Thierry Deschamps, Valérie Martinez, Dominique de Ligny, Christine Martinet
Abstract: The structural evolution with temperature of pure silica (SiO2), sodium-silicate (5Na2O-95SiO2, 10Na2O-90SiO2 and 25Na2O-75SiO2) and albite (15Na2O-15Al2O3-75SiO2) glasses previously densified from hot compression is monitored with a combination of small and wide angle x-ray scattering. Transient scattering maxima in the length scales associated with both techniques indicate the presence of a transitory state, suggesting the classification of the initial and final states as distinct glass states in the context of polyamorphism. In all glasses, a transient intensity peak in the small angle scattering is observed, consistent with the nucleation of a new amorphous state. Based on a comparison with the phenomenology observed in supercooled and glassy water, we propose that this structural evolution provide a strong evidence of the glass polyamorphism as the consequence of the existence of an underlying but thermodynamically defined liquid-liquid transition, independent on the polymerization degree of the system.

Title: Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations of two-dimensional electron gases in AlYN/GaN and AlScN/GaN heterostructures
Authors: Yu-Hsin Chen, Thai-Son Nguyen, Isabel Streicher, Jimy Encomendero, Stefano Leone, Huili Grace Xing, Debdeep Jena
Abstract: AlYN and AlScN have recently emerged as promising nitride materials that can be integrated with GaN to form two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) at heterojunctions. Electron transport properties in these heterostructures have been enhanced through careful design and optimization of epitaxial growth conditions. In this work, we report for the first time Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations of 2DEGs in AlYN/GaN and AlScN/GaN heterostructures, grown by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition. SdH oscillations provide direct access to key 2DEG parameters at the Fermi level: (1) carrier density, (2) electron effective mass (m* ~ 0.24 me for AlYN/GaN and m* ~ 0.25 me for AlScN/GaN), and (3) quantum scattering time (~ 68 fs for AlYN/GaN and ~ 70 fs for AlScN/GaN). These measurements of fundamental transport properties provide critical insights for advancing emerging nitride semiconductors for future high-frequency and power electronics.

Title: Signatures of moiré intralayer biexcitons and exciton-phason coupling in WSe2/WS2 heterostructures
Authors: Ranju Dalal, Harsimran Singh, Rwik Dutta, Hariharan Swaminathan, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Mit H Naik, Manish Jain, Akshay Singh
Abstract: Interactions among electronic and lattice degrees-of-freedom are foundational to various phases in condensed-matter physics, yet the dynamic interplay between excitonic and phononic quasiparticles represents an equivalent, underexplored frontier. Moiré superlattices provide an ideal platform for realizing these interactions by offering localized intralayer excitons (IALX) and ultralow-energy collective lattice modes, such as phasons. Here, by optically suppressing ultrafast charge-transfer (CT) to interlayer excitons in WSe2/WS2 heterostructures, we uncover dynamics of moiré IALX revealing long lifetimes ({\tau} > 1000 ps) arising from localized Wannier and in-plane CT nature. We then observe moiré intralayer intervalley biexcitons with binding energy ~ 16 meV, with long lifetimes due to moiré confinement. Furthermore, we find time-domain signatures of strong coupling between moiré-IALX and ~ 10 micro-eV phasons, evidenced as twist-angle-dependent GHz oscillations in IALX dynamics. Our findings establish moiré superlattices as interacting hybrid quantum systems and for engineering non-equilibrium phenomena, as well as for GHz-scale optoelectronics.

Title: Charge transport in liquid-crystalline phthalocyanine-based thin-film transistors
Authors: L. B. Avila, Zuchong Yang, Ilknur Hatice Eryilmaz, Lilian Skokan, Leonardo N Furini, Andreas Ruediger, H. Bock, I.H. Bechtold, E. Orgiu
Abstract: We investigate a series of liquid-crystalline phthalocyanines (metal-free and Cu, Zn, Ni, Co complexes) by correlating their vibrational signatures with their electronic performance in organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs). Raman spectroscopy reveals metal-dependent distortions of the phthalocyanine macrocycle, reflected in systematic shifts of the C-N-C and M-N vibrational modes. When integrated into OTFTs, all compounds exhibit markedly enhanced current response under ultrahigh vacuum compared to an N2-rich environment, demonstrating that intrinsic charge transport is strongly suppressed by atmospheric species. Temperature-dependent measurements (100-300 K) show clear threshold-voltage shifts driven by deep interface and bulk traps, while all devices display thermally activated mobility with low activation energies (14-20 meV). These results highlight how mesomorphic order, metal coordination, and environmental conditions collectively govern charge transport in liquid-crystalline phthalocyanines, offering design guidelines for their use as orientable semiconducting materials in organic electronics.

Title: Intervalley Band Crossing and Transition of Fractional Chern Insulators in Floquet Twisted Bilayer MoTe$_2$
Authors: Yuhao Shi, Zhao Liu
Abstract: We study the twisted MoTe$_2$ homobilayer coupled to periodic driving of a circularly polarized light (CPL). Using Floquet theory in the high-frequency limit, we start from the Dirac model including both the valence and conduction bands of monolayer MoTe$_2$ to derive an effective time-independent Floquet Hamiltonian. This Floquet Hamiltonian contains explicit time-reversal symmetry breaking terms that are absent if conduction bands are neglected from the beginning of the derivation. Based on the Floquet Hamiltonian, we find the increasing of CPL driving intensity can cause the crossing of Floquet bands between the two valleys. When interactions are included, we identify the redistribution of holes during the intervalley Floquet band crossing. Accordingly, the ground state of the Floquet Hamiltonian at total hole filling $5/3$ evolves from the Laughlin-type FCI in one valley to that in the other valley.

Title: Thermal conductance across bonded SiOx-SiOx interfaces in hybrid bonding process
Authors: Xingqiang Zhang, Liu Chang, Liyi Li, Zhe Cheng
Abstract: Hybrid bonding is a pivotal technology for enabling three dimensional integrated circuits. Among the foremost challenges facing 3D IC implementation is thermal management, where a deep understanding of heat conduction across bonded interfaces is essential for addressing heat dissipation and reliability issues. Nevertheless, the thermal conductance of bonded dielectric-dielectric interfaces remains poorly understood. In this study, we employ the low-temperature bonding technique integral to hybrid bonding to fabricate SiO-SiO interfaces and investigate their thermal boundary conductance using time domain thermoreflectance. Structural characterizations show high quality bonded interfaces. By fitting the data with an equivalent multilayer thermal model, we establish a lower limit TBC of 150 MW/m2-K for the SiO-SiO interfaces, which corresponds to a thermal resistance lower than that of a 9.2-nm-thick dielectric layer. These findings offer valuable insights into thermal transport in hybrid-bonded structures and provide critical guidance for the thermal design of advanced packaging solutions.

Title: An O(N) quasi-Ewald splitting method for nanoconfined electrostatics
Authors: Zecheng Gan, Xuanzhao Gao, Yuqing Li
Abstract: Simulating the dynamics of charged particles in quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) nanoconfined systems presents a significant computational challenge due to the long-range nature of electrostatic interactions and the geometric anisotropy. To address this, we introduce a novel quasi-Ewald splitting strategy tailored for particle-based simulations in such geometry. Our splitting strategy seamlessly integrates a collection of advanced numerical techniques, including optimal quadrature rules [L. N. Trefethen, SIAM Rev. 64(1)(2022), pp.132-150], fast pairwise kernel summation methods [S. Jiang and L. Greengard, Commun. Comput. Phys. 31(1)(2022), pp.1-26], and the random batch method with importance sampling in k-space [S. Jin, L. Li, Z. Xu et al., SIAM J. Sci. Comput. 43(4)(2021), pp.B937-B960]. The resulting algorithm achieves an O(N) overall computational complexity, where N denotes the total number of confined particles. Simulations of several prototype systems validate the accuracy and efficiency of our method. Furthermore, we present numerical observations specifically related to nanoconfined charged many-body systems, highlighting phenomena such as dielectric boundary effects, anisotropic diffusion, and the structure of the electrical double layer (EDL) under conditions of charge asymmetry.

Title: Phase diagram and macroscopic ground state degeneracy of frustrated spin-1/2 anisotropic Heisenberg model on diamond-decorated lattices
Authors: D. V. Dmitriev, V. Ya. Krivnov, O. A. Vasilyev
Abstract: We study the ground state properties of the anisotropic spin-1/2 Heisenberg model on lattices built from ideal diamond units with competing ferro- and antiferromagnetic interactions. The study covers the one-dimensional diamond chain and its two- and three-dimensional generalizations. The ground-state phase diagram contains four distinct phases: ferromagnetic (F), critical (C), monomer-dimer (MD), and tetramer-dimer (TD), which converge at a quadruple point. We demonstrate the presence of macroscopic ground-state degeneracy and corresponding residual entropy, which is maximal at the quadruple point and also extends throughout the MD phase and its boundaries with TD and F phases. For the diamond chain, we derive exact degeneracies, while for higher-dimensional lattices, we map the problem onto a bond percolation model or used transfer-matrix approach, enabling the numerical computation of the ground state degeneracy.

Title: Higher-Dimensional Anyons via Higher Cohomotopy
Authors: Sadok Kallel, Hisham Sati, Urs Schreiber
Abstract: We highlight that integer Heisenberg groups at level 2 underlie topological quantum phenomena: their group algebras coincide with the algebras of quantum observables of abelian anyons in fractional quantum Hall (FQH) systems on closed surfaces. Decades ago, these groups were shown to arise as the fundamental groups of the space of maps from the surface to the 2-sphere -- which has recently been understood as reflecting an effective FQH flux quantization in 2-Cohomotopy. Here we streamline and generalize this theorem using the homotopy theory of H-groups, showing that for $k \in \{1,2,4\}$, the non-torsion part of $\pi_1 \mathrm{Map}\big({(S^{2k-1})^2, S^{2k}}\big)$ is an integer Heisenberg group of level 2, where we identify this level with 2 divided by the Hopf invariant of the generator of $\pi_{4k-1}(S^{2k})$. This result implies the existence of higher-dimensional analogs of FQH anyons in the cohomotopical completion of 11D supergravity ("Hypothesis H").

Title: Novel fast Li-ion conductors for solid-state electrolytes from first-principles
Authors: Tushar Singh Thakur, Loris Ercole, Nicola Marzari
Abstract: We present a high-throughput computational screening for fast lithium-ion conductors to identify promising materials for application in all solid-state electrolytes. Starting from more than 30,000 Li-containing experimental structures sourced from Crystallography Open Database, Inorganic Crystal Structure Database and Materials Platform for Data Science, we perform highly automated calculations to identify electronic insulators. On these ~1000 structures, we use molecular dynamics simulations to estimate Li-ion diffusivities using the pinball model, which describes the potential energy landscape of diffusing lithium with accuracy similar to density functional theory while being 200-500 times faster. Then we study the ~60 most promising and previously unknown fast conductors with full first-principles molecular dynamics simulations at several temperatures to estimate their activation barriers. The results are discussed in detail for the 9 fastest conductors, including $Li_7NbO_6$ which shows a remarkable ionic conductivity of ~5 mS/cm at room temperature. We further present the entire screening protocol, including the workflows where the accuracy of the pinball model is improved self-consistently, necessary to automatically running the required calculations and analysing their results.

Title: Interface-induced band bending and charge separation in all-organic ZnPc/F$_x$ZnPc heterostructures
Authors: Stephanie Amos, Neno Fuller, Wai-Lun Chan, Hartwin Peelaers
Abstract: Organic semiconductors are attractive building blocks for electronic devices due to their low cost and flexibility. Furthermore, heterostructures with type-II band alignments can efficiently separate photogenerated charges via a charge transfer and separation process. Here, we use density functional theory (DFT) to investigate model interfaces formed by zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) and its fluorinated derivatives (F$_8$ZnPc and F$_{16}$ZnPc). We demonstrate that these interfaces not only exhibit a type-II band offset, but also band bending. The band bending causes both the LUMO and HOMO states to localize away from the interface. Therefore, the band bending creates a strong driving force for charge separation. We used ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) to experimentally confirm this predicted band bending. The wavefunction envelopes of vertically-stacked molecules resemble particle-in-a-box states, but this shape is lost when the molecules are staggered. These results elucidate how interface-induced band bending facilitates charge separation in all-organic heterostructures and suggest a design pathway toward improved performance in organic photovoltaic devices.

Title: Propulsion dispersion mediated ordering transition in active particles
Authors: Debraj Dutta, Urna Basu
Abstract: We show that dispersion in propulsion strength qualitatively alters collective behavior of active multi-particle systems interacting via short-range attractive potential, giving rise to novel ordered phases that combine spatial and orientational ordering. Considering a binary mixture of active Brownian particles with two distinct self-propulsion strengths, we find that, the interplay between interaction range, self-propulsion strengths and the relative numbers of the particles with different propulsion strengths can lead to three different phases, namely, a disordered one, and two ordered ones with partial and complete spatial and orientational ordering. The partially ordered phase is characterized by formation of a ring-like assembly of the slower particles while the faster particles diffuse randomly. Two concentric rings, comprising faster and slower particles, form in the fully ordered phase. Using the example of a truncated harmonic potential, we analytically characterize the phase boundaries and identify the associated order parameters. Our results demonstrate that propulsion dispersion provides a robust and novel route to collective ordering in attractive active matter.

Title: Spectroscopic Demarcation of Emergent Photons and Spinons in a Dipolar-Octupolar Quantum Spin Liquid
Authors: Bin Gao, Zhengbang Zhou, Tingjun Zhang, Andrey Podlesnyak, Sang-Wook Cheong, Yong Baek Kim, Pengcheng Dai
Abstract: The identification of fractionalized excitations in quantum spin liquids (QSLs) remains a central challenge in condensed matter physics. In dipolar-octupolar (DO) pyrochlores, such as $\text{Ce}_2\text{Zr}_2\text{O}_7$, the candidate $\pi$-flux quantum spin ice (QSI) state is predicted to host both gapless emergent photons and a continuum of spinons. However, resolving these modes at zero field is complicated by their spectral overlap and the presence of nonmagnetic scattering near zero energy. Here, we report neutron scattering experiments on $\text{Ce}_2\text{Zr}_2\text{O}_7$ under a magnetic field along the $[1,1,1]$ direction. In contrast to previous unpolarized studies at zero-field that relied on high-temperature subtraction, we use a same-temperature high-field subtraction protocol to isolate the photon mode. Leveraging the selective coupling of the magnetic field to the dipolar degrees of freedom, we demonstrate the spectroscopic demarcation of these excitations. We observe that weak fields ($\approx 0.15$ T) suppress the low-energy photon weight while leaving the high-energy spinon continuum robust, albeit hardened. Our results, supported by gauge mean-field theory and exact diagonalization calculations, provide strong evidence for the $\pi$-flux QSI state and introduce a powerful field-tuning protocol for investigating DO-QSLs.

Title: Kinetic Flux Equations for Ion Exchange in Silicate Glasses
Authors: Guglielmo Macrelli
Abstract: Ion exchange kinetic flux equations have been extensively investigated since the mid-twentieth century and continue to provide a fundamental framework for describing mass transport phenomena in solid materials. Despite the maturity of this field, inconsistencies remain in the literature concerning the definition, dimensional consistency, and physical interpretation of the parameters involved. A rigorous and unified treatment of these equations is therefore essential to ensure the reproducibility and comparability of theoretical and experimental studies. The present study aims to establish a coherent and systematic development of ion exchange kinetic flux equations, with particular emphasis on the consistent definition and dimensional formulation of the relevant physical quantities. Beyond refining the theoretical foundations, this study extends the classical formulation by incorporating the influence of mechanical stress on ion transport and considering cross-term interactions within the framework of linear irreversible thermodynamics. These developments provide a more comprehensive description of ion exchange kinetics, particularly as applied to silicate glasses, where coupling between chemical and mechanical effects plays a crucial role in determining transport behavior and performance.

Title: Emulating 2D Materials with Magnons
Authors: Bobby Kaman, Jinho Lim, Yingkai Liu, Axel Hoffmann
Abstract: Spin waves (magnons) in 2D materials have received increasing interest due to their unique states and potential for tunability. However, many interesting features of these systems, including Dirac points and topological states, occur at high frequencies, where experimental probes are limited. Here, we study a crystal formed by patterning a hexagonal array of holes in a perpendicularly magnetized thin film. Through simulation, we find that the magnonic band structure imitates that of graphene, but additionally has some kagome-like character and includes a few flat bands. Surprisingly, its nature can be understood using a 9-band tight-binding Hamiltonian. This clear analogy to 2D materials enables band-gap engineering in 2D, topological magnons along 1D phase boundaries, and spectrally isolated modes at 0D point defects. Interestingly, the 1D phase boundaries allow access to the valley degree of freedom through a magnonic analog of the quantum valley-Hall insulator. These approaches can be extended to other magnonic systems, but are potentially more general due to the simplicity of the model, which resembles existing results from electron, phonon, photon, and cold atom systems. This finding brings the physics of spin waves in 2D materials to more experimentally accessible scales, augments it, and outlines a few principles for controlling magnonic states.

Title: Dynamical bicontinuous networks from 3D active phase separation
Authors: Paarth Gulati, Liang Zhao, Michio Tateno, Omar A. Saleh, Zvonimir Dogic, M. Cristina Marchetti
Abstract: We study phase separation between coexisting active and passive fluids in three-dimensions, using both numerical simulation and experiments. Chaotic flows of the active phase drive giant interfacial deformations and cause the co-existing phases to interpenetrate, generating a continuously reconfiguring bicontinuous steady-state morphology that persists over the lifetime of the active fluid. We demonstrate how activity controls the structure of the bicontinuous network. Quantitative analysis reveals the dominance of dynamical steady-state sheet-like interfaces, in marked difference from the transient bicontinuous structures observed in passive liquid-liquid phase separation, where saddle-like surfaces dominate. These results demonstrate how active stresses suppress the coarsening dynamics of conventional phase separation, generating steady-state reconfigurable morphologies not accessible with conventional surface-modifying agents or through quenching of transient phase separated structures.

Title: Consistent thermodynamics reconstructed from transitions between nonequilibrium steady-states
Authors: Rémi Goerlich, Benjamin Sorkin, Dima Boriskovsky, Luís B Pires, Benjamin Lindner, Cyriaque Genet, Yael Roichman
Abstract: Constructing a thermodynamic framework for nonequilibrium systems remains a major challenge, as quantities such as temperature and free energy often become ambiguous when inferred solely from steady-state properties. Here we take a transformation-based approach and experimentally examine transitions between nonequilibrium steady states (NESS). Using an optically trapped microparticle driven by a tunable correlated stochastic force, we generate active-like steady states with controllable noise statistics. By abruptly changing the trap stiffness, we measure the stochastic work, heat, and entropy produced during NESS-to-NESS transformations. We identify a state-dependent effective temperature that restores the second law for these transitions, enabling the definition of a generalized work that incorporates the consequence of the nonequilibrium fluctuations. With this quantity, we derive and experimentally verify a Crooks-like fluctuation relation linking work distributions to a nonequilibrium free-energy difference defined through the effective temperature. Finally, we establish a fluctuation-response relation for the positional variance following stiffness changes. We demonstrate that this relation is key to distinguishing systems that can be described by a unique effective temperature (i.e., those under equilibrium or white-noise conditions) from those under colored-noise, where an equilibrium-like response cannot be restored. These results delineate the applicability and limits of effective-temperature thermodynamics in driven systems.

Title: Dynamical equivalence between resonant translocation of a polymer chain and diversity-induced resonance
Authors: Marco Patriarca, Stefano Scialla, Els Heinsalu, Marius E. Yamakou, Julyan H.E. Cartwright
Abstract: Networks of heterogeneous oscillators are often seen to display collective synchronized oscillations, even when single elements of the network do not oscillate in isolation. It has been found that it is the diversity of the individual elements that drives the phenomenon, possibly leading to the appearance of a resonance in the response. Here we study the way in which heterogeneity acts in producing an oscillatory regime in a network and show that the resonance response is based on the same physics underlying the resonant translocation regime observed in models of polymer diffusion on a substrate potential. Such a mechanical analog provides an alternative viewpoint that is useful to interpret and understand the nature of collective oscillations in heterogeneous networks.

Title: DC-powered broadband quantum-limited microwave amplifier
Authors: N. Nehra, N. Bourlet, A. H. Esmaeili, B. Monge, F. Cyrenne-Bergeron, A. Paquette, M. Arabmohammadi, A. Rogalle, Y. Lapointe, M. Hofheinz
Abstract: Fast, high-fidelity, single-shot readout of superconducting qubits in quantum processors demands quantum-limited amplifiers to preserve the optimal signal-to-noise ratio. Typically, quantum-limited amplification is achieved with parametric down-conversion of a strong pump tone, which imposes significant hardware overhead and severely limits scalability. Here, we demonstrate the first DC-powered broadband amplifier operating within 0.2 photons of the quantum limit. Our impedance-engineered Inelastic Cooper-pair Tunneling Amplifier (ICTA)-a voltage-biased SQUID in which Cooper pairs tunnel inelastically by emitting signal-idler photon pairs-operates in reflection, delivering 13 dB of average gain across a 3.5 GHz bandwidth in a single stage. Semiclassical simulations accurately predict the gain and saturation power, enabling further design improvements. By eliminating the pump-tone infrastructure, the broadband ICTA promises to dramatically reduce the hardware complexity of quantum-limited amplification in superconducting quantum processors.

Title: Lee-Yang phenomena in edge-coloured graph counting
Authors: Maximilian Wiesmann
Abstract: We study the accumulation of zeros of a polynomial arising from the enumeration of edge-coloured graphs along certain limit curves. The polynomial is a variant of an edge-chromatic polynomial, which specialises to the partition function of the ferromagnetic Ising model on a random regular graph. We call this accumulation behaviour a Lee-Yang phenomenon in analogy with the Lee-Yang theorem. The limiting loci are semialgebraic and arise from anti-Stokes curves of an exponential integral.

Title: Acoustic Analogy of Quantum Baldin Sum Rule for Optimal Causal Scattering
Authors: Sichao Qu, Zixiong Yu, Erqian Dong, Min Yang, Nicholas X. Fang
Abstract: The mass law is a cornerstone in predicting sound transmission loss, yet it neglects the constraints of causal dispersion. Current causality-based theories, such as the Rozanov limit, are applicable only to one-port reflective absorbers. Here, we derive a universal sum rule governing causal scattering in acoustic systems, establishing a rigorous analogy to the Baldin sum rule in quantum field theory. This relation reveals that the integral of the extinction cross-section is fundamentally locked by the scatterer's static effective mass and stiffness, which is validated numerically using seminal examples of underwater metamaterials. Furthermore, the proposed sum rule predicts an optimal condition for an anomalously broadened transmission loss bandwidth, as experimentally observed through the spectral shaping effect of an acoustic Fano resonator. Our findings open up an unexplored avenue for enhancing the scattering bandwidth of passive metamaterials.

Title: Tensor renormalization group approach to critical phenomena via symmetry-twisted partition functions
Authors: Shinichiro Akiyama, Raghav G. Jha, Jun Maeda, Yuya Tanizaki, Judah Unmuth-Yockey
Abstract: The locality of field theories strongly constrains the possible behaviors of symmetry-twisted partition functions, and thus they serve as order parameters to detect low-energy realizations of global symmetries, such as spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB). We demonstrate that the tensor renormalization group (TRG) offers an efficient framework to compute the symmetry-twisted partition functions, which enables us to detect the symmetry-breaking transition and also to study associated critical phenomena. As concrete examples of SSB, we investigate the two-dimensional (2D) classical Ising model and the three-dimensional (3D) classical $O(2)$ nonlinear sigma model, and we identify their critical points solely from the twisted partition function. By employing the finite-size scaling argument, we find the critical temperature $T_c=2.2017(2)$ with the critical exponent $\nu = 0.663(33)$ for the 3D $O(2)$ model. In addition, we also study the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) criticality of the 2D classical $O(2)$ model by extracting the helicity modulus from the twisted partition functions, and we obtain the BKT transition temperature, $T_{\mathrm{BKT}}=0.8928(2)$.

Title: Boundary operators in the Brownian loop soup
Authors: Federico Camia, Rongvoram Nivesvivat
Abstract: We obtain infinitely many boundary operators in the Brownian loop soup in the subcritical phase by analyzing the conformal block expansion of the two-point function that computes the probability of having two marked points on the upper half-plane being separated by Brownian loops. The resulting boundary operators are primary operators in a 2D CFT with central charge $c\leq1$ and have conformal dimensions that are non-negative integers. By comparing the above-mentioned conformal block expansion with probabilities in the Brownian loop soup, we provide a physical interpretation of the boundary operators of even dimensions as operators that insert multiple outer boundaries of Brownian loops at points on the real axis.

Title: Dimension-decaying diffusion processes as the scaling limit of condensing zero-range processes
Authors: Johel Beltrán, Kyuhyeon Choi, Claudio Landim
Abstract: In this article, we prove that, on the diffusive time scale, condensing zero-range processes converge to a dimension-decaying diffusion process on the simplex \[ \Sigma = \{(x_1,\dots,x_S) : x_i \ge 0,\; \sum_{i\in S} x_i = 1\}, \] where $S$ is a finite set. This limiting diffusion has the distinctive feature of being absorbed at the boundary of the simplex. More precisely, once the process reaches a face \[ \Sigma_A = \{(x_1,\dots,x_S) : x_i \ge 0,\; \sum_{i\in A} x_i = 1\}, \qquad A \subset S, \] it remains confined to this set and evolves in the corresponding lower-dimensional simplex according to a new diffusion whose parameters depend on the subset $A$. This mechanism repeats itself, leading to successive reductions of the dimension, until one of the vertices of the simplex is reached in finite time. At that point, the process becomes permanently trapped. The proof relies on a method to extend the domain of the associated martingale problem, which may be of independent interest and useful in other contexts.

Title: Entanglement signatures of quantum criticality in Floquet non-Hermitian topological systems
Authors: Siyuan Cheng, Rui Xie, Xiaosen Yang, Yuee Xie, Yuanping Chen
Abstract: The entanglement entropy can be an effective diagnostic tool for probing topological phase transitions. In one-dimensional single particle systems, the periodic driving generates a variety of topological phases and edge modes. In this work, we investigate the topological phase transition of the one-dimensional Floquet Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model using entanglement entropy, and construct the phase diagram based on entanglement entropy. The entanglement entropy exhibits pronounced peaks and follows the logarithmic scaling law at the phase transition points, from which we extract the central charge $c=1$. We further investigate the entanglement spectrum to accurately distinguish the different topological phases. In addition, the coupling between zero and $\pi$ modes leads to characteristic splittings in the entanglement spectrum, signaling their hybridization under periodic driving. These results remain robust in non-Hermitian regimes and in the presence of next-nearest-neighbor hopping, demonstrating the reliability and universality of entanglement entropy as a diagnostic for topological phase transitions.

Title: Who can compete with quantum computers? Lecture notes on quantum inspired tensor networks computational techniques
Authors: Xavier Waintal, Chen-How Huang, Christoph W. Groth
Abstract: This is a set of lectures on tensor networks with a strong emphasis on the core algorithms involving Matrix Product States (MPS) and Matrix Product Operators (MPO). Compared to other presentations, particular care has been given to disentangle aspects of tensor networks from the quantum many-body problem: MPO/MPS algorithms are presented as a way to deal with linear algebra on extremely (exponentially) large matrices and vectors, regardless of any particular application. The lectures include well-known algorithms to find eigenvectors of MPOs (the celebrated DMRG), solve linear problems, and recent learning algorithms that allow one to map a known function into an MPS (the Tensor Cross Interpolation, or TCI, algorithm). The lectures end with a discussion of how to represent functions and perform calculus with tensor networks using the "quantics" representation. They include the detailed analytical construction of important MPOs such as those for differentiation, indefinite integration, convolution, and the quantum Fourier transform. Three concrete applications are discussed in detail: the simulation of a quantum computer (either exactly or with compression), the simulation of a quantum annealer, and techniques to solve partial differential equations (e.g. Poisson, diffusion, or Gross-Pitaevskii) within the "quantics" representation. The lectures have been designed to be accessible to a first-year PhD student and include detailed proofs of all statements.

Title: Restoring Bloch's Theorem for Cavity Exciton Polaron-Polaritons
Authors: Michael A.D. Taylor, Yu Zhang
Abstract: We introduce a symmetry-informed representation for hybrid photon--exciton--phonon quantum electrodynamics Hamiltonians to restore Bloch's theorem. The interchange of momenta between fermions and bosons breaks crystalline excitons' translational symmetry under strong coupling. Restoring said symmetry, we efficiently compute experimentally accessible observables without introducing approximations to the Hamiltonian, enabling investigations that elucidate material properties in strong coupling with applications enhancing coherent transport and unlocking symmetry-forbidden matter transitions.

Title: Elementary Building Blocks for Cluster Mott Insulators
Authors: Vaishnavi Jayakumar, Ciarán Hickey
Abstract: Mott insulators, in which strong Coulomb interactions fully localize electrons on single atomic sites, play host to an incredibly rich and exciting array of strongly correlated physics. One can naturally extend this concept to cluster Mott insulators, wherein electrons localize not on single atoms but across clusters of atoms, forming "molecules in solids". The resulting localized degrees of freedom incorporate the full spectrum of electronic degrees of freedom, spin, orbital, and charge. These serve as the building blocks for cluster Mott insulators, and understanding them is an important first step toward understanding the many-body physics that emerges in candidate cluster Mott insulators. Here, we focus on elementary building blocks, neglecting some of the complexity present in real materials which can often obfuscate the underlying principles at play. Through an extensive set of exact theoretical calculations on clusters of varying geometry, number of orbitals, and number of electrons, we uncover some of the basic organizing principles of cluster Mott phases, particularly when interactions dominate and negate a simple single-particle picture. These include, for example, the identification of an additional "cluster Hund's rule", of cluster ground states that are best understood from a purely interacting perspective, and of several localized degrees of freedom which are protected by an unusual combination of discrete spatial or orbital symmetries. Finally, we discuss the impact of adding additional terms, relevant to material candidates, on the phase diagrams presented throughout, as well as the potential next steps in the journey to building a more complete picture of cluster Mott insulators.

Title: Observation of Shapiro steps in an ultracold atomic Josephson junction
Authors: Erik Bernhart, Marvin Röhrle, Vijay Pal Singh, Ludwig Mathey, Luigi Amico, Herwig Ott
Abstract: The current-voltage characteristic of a driven superconducting Josephson junction displays discrete steps. This phenomenon, called the Shapiro steps, forms today's voltage standard! Here, we report the observation of Shapiro steps in a driven Josephson junction in a gas of ultracold atoms. We demonstrate that the steps exhibit universal features, and provide insight into the microscopic dissipative dynamics that we directly observe in the experiment. We find that the steps are directly connected to phonon emission and nucleation of solitonic excitations, whose dynamics we follow in space and time. The experimental results are underpinned by extensive numerical simulations based on classical-field dynamics and may enable metrological and fundamental advances.

Title: Global thermodynamic manifold for conservative control of stochastic systems
Authors: Jordan R. Sawchuk, David A. Sivak
Abstract: Optimal control of stochastic systems plays a central role in nonequilibrium physics, with applications in the study of biological molecular motors and the design of single-molecule experiments. While exact analytic solutions to optimization problems are rare, under slow driving conditions, the problem can be reformulated geometrically solely in terms of equilibrium properties. In this framework, minimum-work protocols are geodesics on a thermodynamic manifold whose metric is a generalized friction tensor. Here, we introduce a new foundation for this friction-tensor formalism for conservatively driven systems. Under complete control of the potential energy, a global thermodynamic manifold (on which points are identified with instantaneous energy landscapes) has as its metric a full-control friction tensor. Arbitrary partial-control friction tensors arise naturally as inherited metrics on submanifolds of this global manifold. Leveraging a simple mathematical relationship between system dynamics and the geometry of the global manifold, we derive new expressions for the friction tensor that offer powerful tools for interpretation and computation of friction tensors and minimum-work protocols. Our results elucidate a connection between relaxation and dissipation in slowly driven systems and suggest optimization heuristics. We demonstrate the utility of these developments in three illustrative examples.

Title: Preempting Fermion Sign Problem: Unveiling Quantum Criticality through Nonequilibrium Dynamics in Imaginary Time
Authors: Yin-Kai Yu, Zhi-Xuan Li, Shuai Yin, Zi-Xiang Li
Abstract: The notorious fermion sign problem, arising from fermion statistics, presents a fundamental obstacle to the numerical simulation of quantum many-body systems. Here, we introduce a framework that circumvents the sign problem in the studies of quantum criticality and its associated phases by leveraging imaginary-time nonequilibrium critical dynamics. We demonstrate that the critical properties can be accurately determined from the system's short-time relaxation, a regime where the sign problem remains manageable for quantum Monte-Carlo (QMC) simulations. After validating this approach on two benchmark fermionic models, we apply it to the sign-problematic Hubbard model hosting SU(3)-symmetric Dirac fermions. We present the first numerically exact characterization of its quantum phase diagram, revealing a continuous transition between a Dirac semi-metal and a SU(3) antiferromagnetic phase. This transition defines an unconventional Gross-Neveu universality class that fundamentally reshapes current understanding of Gross-Neveu criticality. Our work provides a powerful tool for investigating sign-problematic systems and quantum criticality.

Title: Multimodal oscillator networks learn to solve a classification problem
Authors: Daan de Bos, Marc Serra-Garcia
Abstract: We numerically demonstrate a network of coupled oscillators that can learn to solve a classification task from a set of examples -- performing both training and inference through the nonlinear evolution of the system. We accomplish this by combining three key elements to achieve learning: A long- term memory that stores learned responses, analogous to the synapses in biological brains; a short- term memory that stores the neural activations, similar to the firing patterns of neurons; and an evolution law that updates the synapses in response to novel examples, inspired by synaptic plasticity. Achieving all three elements in wave-based information processors such as metamaterials is a significant challenge. Here, we solve it by leveraging the material multistability to implement long-term memory, and harnessing symmetries and thermal noise to realize the learning rule. Our analysis reveals that the learning mechanism, although inspired by synaptic plasticity, also shares parallelisms with bacterial evolution strategies, where mutation rates increase in the presence of noxious stimuli.

Title: Thermodynamic uncertainty relations for multi-terminal systems with broken time-reversal symmetry
Authors: Yanchao Zhang, Xinzhi Liu, Xiaolong Lü, Shanhe Su
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs) in steady-state transport for a multi-terminal system consisting of two conducting terminals and N-2 probe terminals, within the linear response regime under broken time-reversal symmetry. We independently derive exact bounds on the TURs for the steady-state particle and heat currents under a strong constraint on the Onsager coefficients. Based on our proposed exact bounds, the analysis reveals that the bounds differ for particle and heat currents and are dependent on the system parameters. Furthermore, we demonstrate that under specific parameter conditions, the TURs of the particle and heat currents have a unified minimum value that depends solely on the number of terminals.

Title: Electronic structures and multi-orbital models of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films at ambient pressure
Authors: Xunwu Hu, Wenyuan Qiu, Cun-Qun Chen, Zhihui Luo, Dao-Xin Yao
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity with a transition temperature $T_c$ exceeding 40 K in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and (La,Pr)$_{3}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films at ambient pressure marks a significant breakthrough in the field of nickelate superconductors. Using density functional theory (DFT), we propose a double-stacked two-orbital effective model for La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin film based on the Ni$-e_g$ orbitals. Our analysis of the Fermi surface reveals three electron pockets ($\alpha,\alpha^{\prime},\beta$) and two hole pockets ($\gamma,\gamma^{\prime}$), where the additional $\alpha^{\prime}$ and $\gamma^{\prime}$ pockets arise from inter-stack interactions. Furthermore, we introduce a high-energy model that incorporates O$-p$ orbitals to facilitate future studies. Calculations of spin susceptibility within the random phase approximation (RPA) indicate that magnetic correlations are enhanced by nesting of the $\gamma$ pocket, which is predominantly derived from the Ni$-d_{z^2}$ orbital. Our results provide a theoretical foundation for understanding the electronic and magnetic properties of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films.

Title: Extreme Anisotropy in the Metallic and Superconducting Phases of Rhombohedral Hexalayer Graphene
Authors: Peiyu Qin, Hai-Tian Wu, Ron Q. Nguyen, Erin Morissette, Naiyuan J. Zhang, K. Watanabe, T. Taniguchi, J.I.A. Li
Abstract: In strongly correlated electronic systems, Coulomb interactions frequently manifest through emergent electronic orders that spontaneously break rotational symmetry. Understanding how such symmetry breaking intertwines with other collective phenomena -- such as unconventional superconductivity -- and how it shapes experimental observables, particularly transport responses, remains a central challenge in modern condensed matter physics. Here, we report a metallic phase with extreme transport anisotropy in rhombohedral hexalayer graphene, with an anisotropy ratio rivaling that of quantum Hall stripe phases. At low temperature, a superconducting state emerges from this metallic phase. Strikingly, the superconductor not only inherits strong anisotropy but also exhibits a wide range of hysteretic transitions arising from the tunability of the underlying anisotropic order. Together, these findings reveal a previously unrecognized coexistence between superconductivity and extreme transport anisotropy, shedding new light on the role of rotational symmetry breaking in shaping unconventional superconductivity in rhombohedral graphene.

Title: Long-range magnetic interactions in Nd$_2$PdSi$_3$ and the formation of skyrmion phases in centrosymmetric metals

Abstract: We present an extensive X-ray and neutron scattering study of the structure and magnetic excitations of Nd$_2$PdSi$_3$, a sister compound of Gd$_2$PdSi$_3$ which was recently found to host a skyrmion lattice phase despite its centrosymmetric crystal structure. Dispersive magnetic excitations were measured throughout the Brillouin zone and modeled to determine the magnetic interactions between Nd ions. Our analysis reveals that the magnetic interactions in this system extend over large distances and are significantly affected by a crystallographic superstructure formed by ordering of the Pd and Si atoms. The results suggest that the mechanism for the skyrmion phase formation in this family of materials, specifically Gd$_2$PdSi$_3$, is through the long-range RKKY interactions rather than short-range triangular-lattice frustration.

Title: Transforming Acidic Corrosion and Embrittlement into a Hydrogen-Trapping Cage
Authors: Ankang Chen, Jiewen Liu, Zihao Huo, Chuang Liu, Yongming Sui, Xuan Liu, Qingkun Yuan, Yan Li, Guangtong Wang, Bao Yuan, Defang Duan, Gang Liu, Bo Zou
Abstract: The vision of a hydrogen economy demands efficient platforms to close the gap between sustainable proton sources and solid-state hydrogen carriers. Metal hydrides serve as key carriers, yet their synthesis remains constrained by the energy-intensive use of high-pressure H2, which fragments the hydrogen chain. Here, we overturn this paradigm by transforming two classic degradation mechanisms, acidic corrosion and hydrogen embrittlement, into a constructive materials-design strategy. We demonstrate that synergistic control of these processes in acid enables the in-situ engineering of a "hydrogen-trapping cage" (HTC) microstructure within metals. Composed of a dense defect network, this cage directly captures and stabilizes protons as hydrides under mild conditions, guided by the universal criterion |DeltaPeq| > DeltaPph. Using this platform, we synthesize over 20 hydrides, including challenging targets such as LiH and NaH, and showcase its functional power with a cage-rich titanium hydride electrocatalyst. This catalyst achieves an exceptional current density of 1.07 A cm-2 for nitrate-to-ammonia conversion, attributed to rapid H- transport within the engineered cage. This work establishes a transformative "failure-to-function" paradigm, delivering an integrated platform that unifies hydrogen capture, stabilization, and conversion.

Title: Bosonic quantum Hall droplets in rapidly rotating two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates
Authors: Zhen Cao, Siying Li, Zhendong Li, Xinyi Liu, Zhigang Wu, Mingyuan Sun
Abstract: Recent experiments demonstrate that rapidly rotating Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) near the lowest Landau level can self-organize into interaction-driven persistent quantum Hall droplet arrays. Inspired by this discovery, we investigate the formation and dynamics of single quantum Hall droplet and droplet arrays in rapidly rotating BECs. Guided by a rigorous theorem on localized many-body states for two-dimensional interacting systems in a magnetic field, we construct single quantum Hall droplet and droplet array states which are shown to be stationary solutions to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation in the rotating frame. The single quantum Hall droplet is shown to be dynamically stable, which underpins its role as the basic unit in a droplet array. The stability of the quantum Hall droplet arrays is demonstrated by their dynamic formation from a phase engineered initial condensate. Our study sheds light onto the nature of the quantum Hall droplet state in a rapidly rotating BEC and offers a new approach for generating and manipulating quantum Hall droplet arrays through designing the initial condensate phase.

Title: On the influence of reference sample properties on magnetic force microscopy calibrations
Authors: Baha Sakar, Christopher Habenschaden, Sibylle Sievers, Hans Werner Schumacher
Abstract: Magnetic force microscopy (MFM) allows the characterization of magnetic stray field distributions with high sensitivity and spatial resolution. Based on a suitable calibration procedure, MFM can also yield quantitative magnetic field values. This process typically involves measuring a reference sample to determine the distribution of the tip's stray field or stray field gradient at the sample surface. This distribution is called the tip transfer function (TTF) and is derived through regularized deconvolution in Fourier space. The properties of the reference sample and the noise characteristics of the detection system significantly influence the derived TTF, thereby limiting its validity range. In a recent study, the tip stray field distribution, and hence the TTF, of an MFM tip was independently measured in real space using a nitrogen vacancy center as a quantum sensor, revealing considerable discrepancies with the reference-sample-based TTF. Here, we analyze the influence of the feature distribution of the reference sample and the MFM measurement parameters on the resulting TTF. We explain the observed differences between quantum-calibrated stray field distributions and the classical approach by attributing them to a loss of information due to missing or suppressed spectral components. Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of the spectral coverage of the TTF. Our findings indicate that for high-quality reconstruction of the stray field of a sample under test (SUT), it is more critical to ensure a strong overlap of frequency components between the reference sample and the SUT than to achieve an accurate real-space reconstruction of the tip stray field distribution.

Title: Integrated covariances as excess observables weighted by currents and activities
Authors: Timur Aslyamov, Massimiliano Esposito
Abstract: Near equilibrium, the symmetric part of the time-integrated steady-state covariance, i.e., the time integral of correlation functions, is governed by the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, while the antisymmetric part vanishes due to Onsager reciprocity. Far from equilibrium, where these principles no longer apply, we develop a unified formalism for both symmetric and antisymmetric components of integrated covariances. We derive exact, computationally tractable expressions for these quantities, valid in arbitrary nonequilibrium steady states of Markov jump processes. Both components are expressed in terms of excess observables, a notion central to both statistical physics and reinforcement learning. Furthermore, we establish thermodynamic upper bounds for antisymmetric covariances in terms of (pseudo-)entropy production and cycle affinities. Finally, we show that the speed up of self-averaging induced by nonequilibrium drivings which preserve kinetics (activity) is bounded by the cycle affinities (thermodynamic forces).

Title: Multiscale contact mechanics for elastoplastic contacts
Authors: Andreas Almqvist, Bo N. J. Persson
Abstract: Understanding contact between rough surfaces undergoing plastic deformation is crucial in many applications. We test Persson's multiscale contact mechanics theory for elastoplastic solids, assuming a constant penetration hardness. Using a numerical model based on the boundary element method, we simulate the contact between a flat rigid surface and an elastic-perfectly plastic half-space with a randomly rough surface. The theory's predictions for elastic, plastic, and total contact area agree quantitatively with the numerical results. The simulations also support the boundary conditions assumed in the theory, namely that the stress probability vanishes at both zero and yield stress. These findings reinforce the validity of the theory for systems with constant hardness.

Title: From Ising to Potts: Physics-inspired Potts machines of coupled oscillators for low-energy sampling and combinatorial optimization
Authors: Yi Cheng, Zongli Lin
Abstract: The $q$-state Potts model is a fundamental model in statistical physics that generalizes the Ising model and plays a key role in the study of phase transitions, critical phenomena, complex systems, and combinatorial optimization. Sampling low-energy configurations of the $q$-state Potts model is essential to these studies, but it remains challenging. While physics-inspired dynamical sampling has been extensively explored for the Ising case ($q=2$) in the form of Ising machines, its generalization to general $q$-state Potts models remains largely unexplored. To fill this gap, we propose a class of physics-inspired dynamical samplers that directly target general $q$-state Potts models, which we refer to as the oscillator Potts machine (OPM). We show, through theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, that the OPM exhibits a systematic low-energy bias with respect to the underlying Potts energy landscape. Furthermore, we demonstrate, via phase perturbation analysis, that the OPM, as overdamped Langevin dynamics, can be realized with a network of self-sustaining oscillators, demonstrating that the OPM is naturally realizable in hardware using standard technology such as CMOS. We design a small-scale ring-oscillator circuit that implements a three-state OPM and validate its operation through transistor-level simulation. Leveraging the low-energy bias of the OPM for Potts models, we then apply it to large-scale max-$K$-cut problems by mapping these instances to $q$-state Potts Hamiltonians and compare its performance against established algorithms. Our results position the OPM as a promising, physically grounded dynamical system framework for multi-state sampling and combinatorial optimization.

Title: A microscopically reversible kinetic theory of flocking
Authors: Ruben Lier
Abstract: We formulate a kinetic theory of two species of hard spheres undergoing reactive collisions that convert chemical energy into kinetic energy. The model describes an active species interacting with a passive background, labeled as birds and air respectively, with the reactive collisions representing of self-propulsion. Microscopic reversibility of the reactive dynamics is imposed, and a chemostat is introduced to drive the system out of equilibrium. When the chemostat is sufficiently strong and one restricts to grazing interspecies collisions, we find that the bird momentum damping coefficient can change sign, giving rise to a flocking transition.

Title: Machine Learning H-theorem
Authors: Ruben Lier
Abstract: H-theorem provides a microscopic foundation of the Second Law of Thermodynamics and is therefore essential to establishing statistical physics, but at the same time, H-theorem has been subject to controversy that in part persists till this day. To better understand H-theorem and its relation to the arrow of time, we study the equilibration of randomly oriented and positioned hard disks with periodic boundary conditions. Using a model based on the DeepSets architecture, which imposes permutation invariance of the particle labels, we train a model to capture the irreversibility of the H-functional.

Title: Surface separation in elastoplastic contacts
Authors: Andreas Almqvist, Bo N. J. Persson
Abstract: Understanding the contact between rough surfaces undergoing plastic deformation is crucial in many applications. We study the effect of plastic deformation on the surface separation between two solids with random roughness. Assuming a constant penetration hardness, we propose a procedure within Persson's multiscale contact mechanics theory to obtain the average surface separation by applying the elastic formulation to an effective power spectrum that accounts for plastic smoothing. Deterministic numerical simulations based on the boundary element method are used to validate the procedure and show good agreement with the theoretical predictions. The treatment also provides a route to incorporate plastic stiffening of the roughness as the stress state becomes increasingly hydrostatic at large plastic deformation.

Title: Linear approximations of large deviations: Cubic diffusion test
Authors: Pelerine Tsobgni Nyawo, Hugo Touchette
Abstract: We propose a method for approximating the large deviation rate function of time-integrated observables of diffusion processes, used in statistical physics to characterize the fluctuations of nonequilibrium systems. The method is based on linearizing the effective process associated with the large deviations of the process and observable considered, and is tested for a simple one-dimensional nonlinear diffusion model involving a cubic drift. The results show that the linear approximation compares well with the exact rate function, especially in the large fluctuation regime, and that its accuracy is related to the way the linearized process localizes in space. Possible extensions and applications to more complex diffusion models are proposed for future work.

Title: Bloch oscillations of helicoidal spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates in deep optical lattices
Authors: Sumaita Sultana, Golam Ali Sekh
Abstract: We consider helicoidal spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates in deep optical lattice and study the dynamics of Bloch oscillation. We show that the variation of helicoidal gauge potential with spin-orbit coupling is different in zero-momentum and plane-wave phases. The characteristics of Bloch oscillation are different in the two phases. In the zero-momentum phase, the Bloch oscillation is harmonic while it is anharmonic in the plane-wave phase. The amplitude of Bloch oscillation is found to be affected by the helicoidal gauge potential and spin-orbit coupling. We examine that the decay of Bloch oscillation caused by mean-field interaction can be managed by helicoidal spin-orbit coupling.

Title: Non-Fermi liquid behaviour of CDW instabilities in fractionally-filled moiré flatbands
Authors: Ipsita Mandal
Abstract: Spin- and valley-polarized fractionally-filled moiré flatbands are known to host emergent Fermi-liquid phases, when analysed with the help of a dual description in terms of holes. The dominant Coulomb interactions in an almost flatband endow the fermions with a nontrivial dispersion, when the system is described in terms of the hole operators (rather than the particle operators). In particular, for one-fourth filling, the Fermi surface takes a quasi-triangular shape, which brings about the possibility of charge-density-wave (CDW) ordering in the ground state, characterised by the nesting vectors ($ \mathbf{Q}_n $). The $\mathbf{Q}_n$'s connect antipodal points of the Fermi surface (designated as hot-spots) and are found to belong to the space of reciprocal vectors of the underlying honeycomb structure. The resulting CDW order can be described in terms of instabilities caused by bosonic fields with momenta centred at $\lbrace \mathbf{Q}_n \rbrace $, coupling with the fermions residing in the vicinity of a pair of antipodal hot-spots. When there is a transition from a Fermi liquid to a CDW state, the bosons become massless (or critical), effectuating a non-Fermi liquid behaviour. We set out to identify such non-Fermi liquid phases after constructing a minimal effective action.

Title: Exploration of Altermagnetism in $\mathrm{RuO_{2}}$
Authors: Yu-Xin Li, Yiyuan Chen, Liqing Pan, Shuai Li, Song-Bo Zhang, Hai-Zhou Lu
Abstract: The fundamental role of magnetic materials in modern science and technology has driven a rapid surge in research on unconventional magnetism in recent years. In particular, altermagnets, which simultaneously exhibit zero net magnetization in real space and anisotropic spin splitting in momentum space, have garnered significant interest for both fundamental physics and technological applications. Among these, $\mathrm{RuO_{2}}$ stands as the pioneering and most extensively studied altermagnet. While the intrinsic magnetic order of $\mathrm{RuO_{2}}$ is still a subject of active debate, numerous exotic phenomena characteristic of altermagnetism have been observed in $\mathrm{RuO_{2}}$ samples. In this review, we explore each facet of the altermagnetism through specific case studies in $\mathrm{RuO_{2}}$, systematically surveying its crystal and magnetic structures, electronic band properties, and transport phenomena. We critically assess the debate surrounding the intrinsic magnetism in $\mathrm{RuO_{2}}$, incorporating evidence from altermagnetic signatures in transport, as well as contrasting results from magnetic and spectroscopic measurements. Finally, possible future research directions in this field are discussed.

Title: Variational and field-theoretical approach to exciton-exciton interactions and biexcitons in semiconductors
Authors: Peter A. Noordman, Lucas Maisel Licerán, Henk T. C. Stoof
Abstract: Bound electron-hole pairs in semiconductors known as excitons are the subject of intense research due to their potential for optoelectronic devices and applications, especially in the realm of two-dimensional materials. While the properties of free excitons in these systems are well understood, a general description of the interactions between these quasiparticles is complicated due to their composite nature, which leads to important exchange processes that can take place between the identical fermions of different excitons. In this work, we employ a variational approach to study interactions between Wannier excitons and obtain an effective interaction potential between two ground-state excitons in a system of spin-degenerate electrons and holes. This potential is in general nonlocal in position space and depends on the combined spin configurations of the electrons and holes. When particularized to the case of hydrogen-like excitons with a heavy hole, this potential becomes local and exactly reproduces the Heitler-London result for two interacting hydrogen atoms. Thus, our result can be interpreted as a generalization of the Heitler-London potential to the case of arbitrary masses. We also show how including corrections due to excited states into the theory results in a van der Waals potential at large distances, which is expected due to the induced dipole-dipole nature of the interactions. Our approach is also applicable to more complicated systems with nonhydrogenic exciton series, such as layered semiconductors with Rytova-Keldysh interactions. Additionally, we use a path-integral formalism to develop a many-body theory for a dilute gas of excitons, resulting in an excitonic action that formally includes many-body interactions between excitons. While in this approach the field representing the excitons is exactly bosonic, we clarify how the internal exchange processes arise in...

Title: plasmonX: an Open-Source Code for Nanoplasmonics
Authors: Tommaso Giovannini, Pablo Grobas Illobre, Piero Lafiosca, Luca Nicoli, Luca Bonatti, Stefano Corni, Chiara Cappelli
Abstract: We present the first public release of plasmonX, a novel open-source code for simulating the plasmonic response of complex nanostructures. The code supports both fully atomistic and implicit descriptions of nanomaterials. In particular, it employs the frequency-dependent fluctuating charges ($\omega$FQ) and dipoles ($\omega$FQF$\mu$) models to describe the response properties of atomistic structures, including simple and $d$-metals, graphene-based structures, and multi-metal nanostructures. For implicit representations, the Boundary Element Method is implemented in both the dielectric polarizable continuum model (DPCM) and integral equation formalism (IEF-PCM) variants. The distribution also includes a post-processing module that enables analysis of electric field-induced properties such as charge density and electric field patterns.

Title: Cluster percolation and dynamical scaling in the Baxter--Wu model
Authors: Alexandros Vasilopoulos, Michail Akritidis, Nikolaos G. Fytas, Martin Weigel
Abstract: We investigate the percolation behavior of Fortuin-Kasteleyn--type clusters in the spin-$1/2$ Baxter--Wu model with three-spin interactions on a triangular lattice. The considered clusters are constructed by randomly freezing one of the three sublattices, resulting in effective pairwise interactions among the remaining spins. Using Monte Carlo simulations combined with a finite-size scaling analysis, we determine the percolation temperature of these stochastic clusters and show that it coincides with the exact thermal critical point of the model. The critical exponents derived from cluster observables are consistent with those of the underlying thermal phase transition. Finally, we analyze the dynamical scaling of the multi-cluster and single-cluster algorithms resulting from the cluster construction, highlighting their efficiency and scaling behavior with system size.

Title: Distributing entanglement between distant semiconductor qubit registers using a shared-control shuttling link

Abstract: Semiconductor quantum processors have potential to scale to modular quantum computers, in which qubit registers are coupled by quantum links, enabling high connectivity and space for control circuitry. Individual spin-qubit registers have progressed to two-dimensional systems and execution of small quantum algorithms. Separately, high-fidelity spin shuttling has been demonstrated in linear channels defined by individual gate electrodes. Here, we realize the first shared-control shuttling link integrated between distant qubit registers to demonstrate quantum entanglement in a basic modular quantum processor based on hole spin qubits in germanium. We develop a protocol to compensate for spin-orbit-induced rotations during qubit transfer, allowing for shuttling between qubit registers separated by more than one micrometer in approximately a hundred nanoseconds. Combining local qubit operation with coherent shuttling, we generate Bell states formed by spins residing in separate registers. Characterizing them using quantum state tomography, we demonstrate entanglement between spin qubits in distant registers.

Title: Kinetic Inductance of Few-Layer NbSe$_2$ in the Two-Dimensional Limit

Niedzielski, Kyle Serniak, Mollie E. Schwartz, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Philip Kim, Riccardo Comin, Jeffrey A. Grover, Terry P. Orlando, Pablo Jarillo-Herrero, William D. Oliver
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) superconductors remain superconducting down to the monolayer limit, enabling the exploration of emergent physical phenomena and functionality driven by reduced dimensionality. Here, we report the characterization of the kinetic inductance of atomically thin NbSe$_2$, a two-dimensional van der Waals superconductor, using superconducting coplanar waveguides and microwave measurement techniques familiar to circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED). The kinetic inductance scales inversely with the number of NbSe$_2$ layers, reaching 1.2 nH/$\Box$ in the monolayer limit. Furthermore, the measured kinetic inductance exhibits a thickness-dependent crossover from clean- to dirty-limit behavior, with enhanced dirty-limit contributions emerging in the ultra-thin regime. These effects are likely driven by increased surface scattering, multi-band superconductivity, and geometric confinement. Additionally, the self-Kerr nonlinearity of the NbSe$_2$ films ranges from $K/2\pi$ = -0.008 to -14.7 Hz/photon, indicating its strong potential in applications requiring compact, nearly linear, high-inductance superconducting quantum devices and detectors. The fabrication and characterization techniques demonstrated here are extensible to the investigation of other two-dimensional superconductors.

Title: Counterintuitive Potential-Barrier Affinity Effect
Authors: Qiang Xu, Zhao Liu, Yanming Ma
Abstract: Electron accumulation in interatomic regions is a fundamental quantum phenomenon dictating chemical bonding and material properties, yet its origin remains elusive across disciplines. Here, we report a counterintuitive quantum effect -- potential-barrier affinity (PBA) -- revealed by solving the Schrödinger equation for a crystalline potential. PBA effect drives significant interatomic electron accumulation when electron energy exceeds the barrier maximum. This effect essentially determines interatomic electron density patterns, governing microstructures and properties of condensed matters. Our theory overturns the traditional wisdom that the interstitial electron localization in electride requires potential-well constraints or hybrid orbitals, and it serves the fundamental mechanism underlying the formation of conventional chemical bonds. This work delivers a paradigm shift in understanding electron distribution and establishes a theoretical foundation for the microscopic design of material properties.

Title: Pseudopotentials for Orbital-Free DFT: Capturing Nonlocality and Correcting Functional Approximants
Authors: Valeria Rios-Vargas, Ezekiel Oyeniyi, Xuecheng Shao, Wala Fathelrahman Ibrahim Elsayed, Sunday Joseph Ogenyi, Alex Okello, Michele Pavanello
Abstract: Developing reliable pseudopotentials for orbital-free density functional theory (OF-DFT), especially for transition metals, remains a significant challenge. In this study, we provide a theoretical framework for analyzing pseudization strategies for OF-DFT calculations. From the analysis arises a proposed pseudization method which involves constructing local pseudopotentials by targeting existing Kohn-Sham DFT pseudopotentials through an optimized effective potential procedure. We produce four distinct sets of local pseudopotentials and evaluate their accuracy and transferability on the transition metal elements. Our results indicate a substantial improvement over previously available pseudopotentials. Although current OF-DFT functionals still only reach a qualitative accuracy for transition metals, our newly developed pseudopotentials provide a rigorous framework for further methodological advancements.

Title: Langevin equation with potential of mean force: The case of anchored bath
Authors: Alex V. Plyukhin
Abstract: The potential of mean force (PMF) is an effective average potential acting on an open system, renormalized due to the interaction with the surrounding thermal bath. The PMF determines the correction to the equilibrium Gibbs distribution, but it is generally unclear how to implement the concept for time-dependent phenomena described by a (generalized) Langevin equation. We study a model where the system is a single particle (so there are no complications related to internal forces) and a non-trivial PMF is due to the presence of on-site (anchor) potentials applied to the bath particles. We found that the PMF does not merely replace the external potential, but also makes the dissipation kernel and statistical properties of noise dependent on the system's position. That dependence is determined by the internal bath and system-bath interactions and is a priori unknown. Therefore, in the general case the Langevin equation with the PMF is not closed and thus inoperable. However, for systems with linear forces the aforementioned dependence on the system's position is canceled. As an example, we consider a model where the bath is formed by the Klein-Gordon chain, i. e. a harmonic chain with on-site harmonic potentials. In that case, the generalized Langevin equation has the standard form with an external potential replaced by a quadratic PMF.

Abstract: Predicting the growth of large cracks in brittle materials is a fundamental unresolved problem in fracture mechanics. Under out-of-plane shear loading, an initially planar crack may fragment into multiple cracks, forming an echelon crack pattern. Explaining this phenomenon is essential for developing a general theory of crack growth. Although numerous empirical criteria have been proposed in the literature, none provide a unified explanation of all observed features and are largely restricted to two-dimensional growth in linear elastic isotropic materials. In this Letter, we confront a classical set of echelon crack growth experiments using two phase-field approaches: the classical variational model and a strength-constrained model. We show that, contrary to prevailing views, the variational model based solely on Griffith's energetic competition between elastic and fracture energies is fundamentally incomplete even for predicting the growth of large cracks. By incorporating a material strength surface that constrains the regions in which a crack can grow, the resulting model accurately predicts echelon crack growth without invoking any ad hoc assumptions about material or geometrical disorder. Results are presented for both soft and hard materials, confirming the model's general applicability to any brittle material. We further identify two governing non-dimensional parameters that control crack orientation and morphology and demonstrate that one of them, the ratio of shear to tensile strength, determines whether crack paths are more influenced by energy-based or stress-based empirical criteria, thereby reconciling these criteria within a single framework.

Title: Topical Review: The rise of Klein tunneling in low-dimensional materials and superlattices
Authors: Yonatan Betancur-Ocampo, Guillermo Monsivais, Vít Jakubský
Abstract: We review recent advances in Klein and anti-Klein tunneling in one- and two-dimensional materials. Using a general tight-binding framework applied to multiple periodic systems, we establish the criteria for the emergence of Klein tunneling based on the conservation of an effective reduced pseudospin. The inclusion of higher-order terms in the wave vector leads to nontrivial matching conditions for wave scattering at interfaces. We further examine the emergence of multiple types of Klein tunneling in two-dimensional materials beyond graphene, including phosphorene and borophene, as well as in one-dimensional systems such as Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattices. Finally, we discuss how these tunneling phenomena can be tested in both synthesized and artificial lattices, including elastic metamaterials, optical, photonic, phononic, and superconducting platforms, demonstrating the universality of Klein tunneling across different wave natures and length scales.

Title: Tuning Separator Chemistry: Improving Zn Anode Compatibility via Functionalized Chitin Nanofibers
Authors: Ibrahim Al Kathemi, Vishnu Arumughan, Mohamed Zbiri, Marcel Kröger, Ira Smal, Eero Kontturi, Roza Bouchal
Abstract: Aqueous zinc (Zn) batteries (AZBs) face significant challenges due to the limited compatibility of Zn anodes with conventional separators, leading to dendrite growth, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and poor cycling stability. While separator design is crucial for optimizing battery performance, its potential remains underexplored. The commonly used glass fiber (GF) filters were not originally designed as battery separators. To address their limitations, nanochitin derived from waste shrimp shells was used to fabricate separators with varying concentrations of amine and carboxylic functional groups. This study investigates how the type and concentration of these groups influence the separator's properties and performance. In a mild acidic electrolyte that protonates the amine groups, the results showed that the density of both ammonium and carboxylic groups in the separators significantly affected water structure and ionic conductivity. Quasi-Elastic Neutron Scattering (QENS) revealed that low-functionalized chitin, particularly with only ammonium groups, promotes strongly bound water with restricted mobility, thereby enhancing Zn plating and stripping kinetics. These separators exhibit exceptional Zn stability over 2000 hours at low current densities (0.5 mA/cm2), maintaining low overpotentials and stable polarization. Additionally, the full cell consisting of Zn||NaV3O8.1.5H2O showed a cycle life of over 2000 cycles at 2 A/g, demonstrating the compatibility of the nanochitin-based separators with low concentrations of functional surface groups. These results demonstrate the importance of a simple separator design for improving the overall performance of AZBs.

Title: Site-Order Optimization in the Density Matrix Renormalization Group via Multi-Site Rearrangement
Authors: Ryo Watanabe, Toshiya Hikihara, Hiroshi Ueda
Abstract: In the approaches based on matrix-product states (MPSs), such as the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method, the ordering of the sites crucially affects the computational accuracy. We investigate the performance of an algorithm that searches for the optimal site order by iterative local site rearrangement. We improve the algorithm by expanding the range of site rearrangement and apply it to a one-dimensional quantum Heisenberg model with random site permutation. The results indicate that increasing the range of the site rearrangement significantly improves the computational accuracy of the DMRG method. In particular, increasing the rearrangement range from two to three sites reduces the average relative error in the ground-state energy by 65% to 94% in the cases we tested. We also discuss the computational cost of the algorithm and its application as a preprocessing for MPS-based calculations.

Title: Lectures on insulating and conducting quantum spin liquids
Authors: Subir Sachdev
Abstract: Two of the iconic phases of the hole-doped cuprate materials are the intermediate temperature pseudogap metal and the lower temperature $d$-wave superconductor. Following the prescient suggestion of P.~W.~Anderson, there were numerous early theories of these phases as doped quantum spin liquids. However, these theories have had difficulties with two prominent observations: (i) angle-dependent magnetoresistance measurements (ADMR) in the pseudogap metal, including observation of the Yamaji effect, present convincing evidence of small hole pockets which can tunnel coherently between square lattice layers (Fang et al., Nature Physics 18, 558 (2022); Chan et al., Nature Physics 21, 1753 (2025)) and (ii) the velocities of the nodal Bogoliubov quasiparticles in the $d$-wave superconductor are highly anisotropic, with $v_F \gg v_\Delta$ (Chiao et al., Phys. Rev. B 62, 3554 (2000)). These lecture notes review how the fractionalized Fermi Liquid (FL*) state, which dopes quantum spin liquids with gauge-neutral electron-like quasiparticles, resolves both difficulties. Theories of insulating quantum spin liquids employing fractionalization of the electron spin into bosonic or fermionic partons are discussed. Doping the bosonic parton theory leads to a holon metal theory: while not appropriate for the cuprate pseudogap, this theory is argued to apply to the Lieb lattice. Doping the fermionic parton theory leads to a $d$-wave superconductor with nearly isotropic quasiparticle velocities. The construction of the FL* state in a single band Hubbard-type model is described using a quantum dimer model, followed by a more realistic description using the Ancilla Layer Model (ALM), which is then used to obtain the theory of the pseudogap and the $d$-wave superconductor.

Title: High-Performance KV$_3$Sb$_5$/WSe$_2$ van der Waals Photodetectors
Authors: Yang Yang, Shaofeng Rao, Yuxuan Hou, Jiabo Liu, Deng Hu, Yufei Guo, Jianzhou Zhao, Hechen Ren, Zhiwei Wang, Fan Yang
Abstract: Kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A = K, Rb, Cs) have recently emerged as a promising platform for exploring correlated and topological quantum states, yet their potential for optoelectronic applications remains largely unexplored. Here, we report high-performance photodetectors based on van der Waals KV$_3$Sb$_5$/WSe$_2$ heterojunctions. A high-quality Schottky interface readily forms between KV$_3$Sb$_5$ and WSe$_2$, enabling efficient separation and transport of photoinduced carriers. Under 520 nm illumination, the device achieves an open-circuit voltage up to 0.6 V, a responsivity of 809 mA/W, and a fast response time of 18.3 us. This work demonstrates the promising optoelectronic applications of Kagome metals and highlights the potential of KV$_3$Sb$_5$-based van der Waals heterostructures for high-performance photodetection.

Title: Nanocrystal Geometry Governs Phase Transformation Pathways in Palladium Hydride
Authors: Daewon Lee, Sam Oaks-Leaf, Hyeonjong Ma, Jianlong He, Zhiqi Wang, Yifeng Shi, Eonhyoung Ahn, Karen C. Bustillo, Chengyu Song, Stephanie M. Ribet, Rohan Dhall, Colin Ophus, Mark Asta, Jiwoong Yang, Younan Xia, David T. Limmer, Haimei Zheng
Abstract: Pathways and structural dynamics of phase transformations impact performance of materials in energy and information storage technologies. Palladium hydride ($\mathrm{PdH}_x$) nanocrystals are an ideal model system for studying solute-induced phase transformations, where elastic energy from lattice mismatch between $\alpha$-$\mathrm{PdH}_x$ and $\beta$-$\mathrm{PdH}_x$ phases is often considered a key to determining the transformation pathways. $\alpha/\beta$-$\mathrm{PdH}_x$ interfacial elastic energy is affected by the confined geometry of a nanocrystal. However, how nanocrystal geometry influences phase transformation pathways is largely unknown. Using in situ liquid phase transmission electron microscopy, we directly visualize hydrogenation in Pd nanocrystals with two geometries -- a nanocube and a hexagonal nanoplate. Both follow similar sequences of an initially curved nucleus, interface flattening, and reverse-stage nucleation; however, their evolving $\alpha/\beta$-$\mathrm{PdH}_x$ interfaces exhibit geometry-dependent crystallographic alignments. In nanocubes, $\{100\}$-aligned configurations conform to static elastic energy ordering, representing a pathway that maintains a local mechanical equilibrium, whereas nanoplates display both $\{110\}$- and $\{211\}$-aligned interfaces. Theoretical simulations show that geometry determines the accessibility of alternative phase transformation pathways as the system is driven far from equilibrium during hydrogenation. These findings identify geometry as a fundamental parameter for directing phase transformation pathways, offering design principles for accessing atypical configurations and improving properties of intercalation-based devices.

Title: Exact Mobility Edges in a Disorder-Free Dimerized Stark Lattice with Effective Unbounded Hopping
Authors: Yunyao Qi, Heng Lin, Quanfeng Lu, Dong Ruan, Gui-Lu Long
Abstract: We propose a disorder-free one-dimensional single-particle Hamiltonian hosting an exact mobility edge (ME), placing the system outside the assumptions of no-go theorems regarding unbounded potentials. By applying a linear Stark potential selectively to one sublattice of a dimerized chain, we generate an effective Hamiltonian with unbounded, staggered hopping amplitudes. The unbounded nature of the hopping places the model outside the scope of the Simon-Spencer theorem, while the staggered scaling allows it to evade broader constraints on Jacobi matrices. We analytically derive the bulk spectrum in reciprocal space, identifying a sharp ME where the energy magnitude equals the inter-cell hopping strength. This edge separates a continuum of extended states from two distinct localized branches: a standard unbounded Wannier-Stark ladder and an anomalous bounded branch accumulating at the ME. The existence of extended states is supported by finite-size scaling of the inverse participation ratio up to system sizes $L \sim 10^9$. Furthermore, we propose an experimental realization using photonic frequency synthetic dimensions. Our numerical results indicate that the ME is robust against potential experimental imperfections, including frequency detuning errors and photon loss, establishing a practical path for observing MEs in disorder-free systems.

Title: Optically trapped exciton-polariton condensates in a perovskite microcavity
Authors: Maciej Zaremba, Mateusz Kędziora, Laura Stańco, Krzysztof Piskorski, Kamil Kosiel, Anna Szerling, Rafał Mazur, Wiktor Piecek, Andrzej Opala, Helgi Sigurðsson, Barbara Piętka
Abstract: We demonstrate room temperature optical trapping and generation of high-order angular harmonics in exciton-polariton condensates in a monocrystalline CsPbBr$_3$ perovskite-filled microcavity. Using an annular nonresonant excitation profile focused onto the perovskite, we observed power-driven switching between different transverse modes of the optically induced trap. We explore the interplay between the perovskite crystal dimensions and the optical trap diameter that allows the condensate to transition from whispering gallery-like petal shapes to extended ripple states. Our results underline the feasibility in creating high-order quantum states in perovskite polariton condensates for reconfigurable and structured room temperature nonlinear lasing.

Title: The source of hardware-tailored codes and coding phases
Authors: Gaurav Gyawali, Henry Shackleton, Zhu-Xi Luo, Michael Lawler
Abstract: A central challenge in quantum error correction is identifying powerful quantum codes tailored to specific hardware and determining their error thresholds above which quantum information is unprotected. This problem is hard because we cannot determine the noise models for our devices. Inspired by the quantum capacity theorem, we seek an optimal quantum source of information, namely the density matrix that degrades minimally when passed through a noisy channel. We explore this idea with the Open Random Unitary Model (ORUM), a simplified model of a $N$-qubit quantum computer with competing depolarizing and dephasing channels as a stand-in for unitary gates and measurements. Through numerical optimization, we find that the ORUM hosts three discrete regimes, three "phases", the "maximally mixed source" phase, a "$\mathbb{Z}_2$ source" phase (where ORUM's $U(1)$ gauge symmetry is broken down to $\mathbb{Z}_2$), and a no-coding phase where all information is lost. These phases exhibit first-order transitions among themselves and converge at a novel zero-capacity multicritical point. These results show a remarkable similarity between the quantum capacity theorem and Jaynes' maximum entropy principle of statistical mechanics. Using the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ source, we build two codes, a classical cat code capable of correcting all the dephasing errors and a concatenated cat code capable of correcting all errors up to a distance $d=\text{min}(m,N)$ and reduces to Shor's 9-qubit code for $m=N=3$. Neither classical nor quantum code survives near the vicinity of the zero-capacity multicritical point in the source phase diagram. Applying our approach to current noisy devices could provide a systematic method for constructing quantum codes for robust computation and communication.

Title: Nonclassical Nucleation Pathways in Liquid Condensation Revealed by Simulation and Theory
Authors: Yijian Wu, Thomas Philippe, Aymane Graini, Julien Lam
Abstract: Using state-of-the-art rare-event sampling simulations, we precisely characterize the nucleation of liquid droplets from a supersaturated Lennard-Jones gas and uncover a key physical feature: critical clusters nucleate with a density that differs substantially from that of the macroscopic equilibrium liquid. Our atomistic simulations also reveal a nonclassical nucleation pathway showing simultaneous growth and densification in liquid condensation. We then exploit these insights to develop a two-variable nucleation theory, in which the cluster density is allowed to vary. Our accessible model based on the capillary approximation is able to quantitatively retrieve the numerical results in nucleation rate and critical cluster properties over a large range of supersaturation. Remarkably, the two-variable model successfully captures the observed nucleation pathway. The effectiveness of this integrated numerical and theoretical framework demonstrates that the cluster density is a decisive variable in nucleation, highlighting the limitations of the single-variable description while offering a robust foundation for its refinement.

Title: Light-Driven Skyrmion Crystal Generation in Plasmonic Metasurfaces Through the Inverse Faraday Effect
Authors: Xingyu Yang, Chantal Hareau, Tristan da Câmara Santa Clara Gomes, Jack Gartside, Mathieu Mivelle
Abstract: Skyrmions are topological structures defined by a winding vector configuration that yields a quantized topological charge. In magnetic materials, skyrmions manifest as stable, mobile spin textures, positioning them at the forefront of spintronics research. Meanwhile, their optical counterparts unlock new possibilities for manipulating and directing light at the nanoscale. Exploring the territories where magnetism and optics meet therefore holds immense promise for ultrafast control over magnetic processes. Here, we report the generation of a skyrmion-topological lattice through the inverse Faraday effect in a plasmonic metasurface. Specifically, a hexagonal array of gold nanodisks induces unidirectional drift photocurrents in each nanodisk, while counterpropagating phantom currents arise in the hexagonal interstices. This interplay creates a lattice of skyrmionic magnetic textures. Crucially, the all optical, large scale formation of skyrmions potentially at ultrafast timescales offers a pathway for integrating these topological spin textures into magnetic materials, laying the groundwork for next-generation data storage and processing technologies.

Title: Deterministic quantum trajectory via imaginary time evolution
Authors: Shivan Mittal, Bin Yan
Abstract: Stochastic quantum trajectories, such as pure state evolutions under unitary dynamics and random measurements, offer a crucial ensemble description of many-body open system dynamics. Recent studies have highlighted that individual quantum trajectories also encode essential physical information. Prominent examples include measurement induced phase transitions, where a pure quantum state corresponding to fixed measurement outcomes (trajectories) exhibits distinct entanglement phases, depending on the measurement rate. However, direct observation of this effect is hindered by an exponential post-selection barrier, whereby the probability of realizing a specific trajectory is exponentially small. We propose a deterministic method to efficiently prepare quantum trajectories in polynomial time using imaginary time evolution and, thus, overcome this fundamental challenge. We demonstrate that our method applies to a certain class of quantum states, and argue that there does not exist universal approaches for any quantum trajectories. Our result paves the way for experimentally exploring the physics of individual quantum trajectories at scale and enables direct observation of certain post-selection-dependent phenomena.

Title: The $β$-decay spectrum of Tritiated graphene: combining nuclear quantum mechanics with Density Functional Theory
Authors: Andrea Casale, Angelo Esposito, Guido Menichetti, Valentina Tozzini
Abstract: We present the results of a multi-methodological study aimed at investigating the interaction between graphene and Tritium during its $\beta$-decay to Helium, under different levels of loading and geometrical configurations. We combine Density Functional Theory (DFT), to evaluate the interaction potentials, with calculations of the decay rate, in order to study the consequences that the presence of the substrate has on the $\beta$-decay spectrum of Tritium. We determine the shape of the event rate, accounting for the effects of (part of) the corresponding condensed matter degrees of freedom. In the context of future neutrino experiments, our results provide important information aimed at the optimization of hosting material, as well as the determination of the physics reach. Furthermore, our work outlines a novel theoretical and computational scheme to address a question at the boundary between high and low energy physics. This requires non-conventional declinations of DFT combined with full quantum treatments of the nuclear configuration involved in the decay process.

Title: Matrix-product-state approach for qubits-waveguide systems in real space
Authors: Shimpei Goto
Abstract: We present a matrix-product-state-based numerical approach for simulating systems composed of several qubits and a common one-dimensional waveguide. In the presented approach, the one-dimensional waveguide is modeled in real space. Thus, one can use the advantage of matrix-product states that are suited for simulating low-entangled one-dimensional systems. The price to pay is that the vacuum of the waveguide in this modeling becomes the Bogoliubov vacuum, and one has to consider a not-so-small local Hilbert space for bosonic degrees of freedom. To manage the large local Hilbert space, we adopt the recently proposed single-site schemes. We demonstrate the potential of the presented approach by simulating superradiant phenomena within the Hamiltonian dynamics.

Title: Optical excitation and stabilization of ultracold field-linked tetratomic molecules
Authors: Bijit Mukherjee, Michał Tomza
Abstract: We propose a coherent optical population transfer of weakly bound field-linked (FL) tetratomic molecules (tetramers) to deeper FL bound states using stimulated Raman adiabatic passage. We consider static-electric-field shielded polar alkali-metal diatomic molecules and corresponding FL tetramers in their $\textrm{X}^1\Sigma^+$+$\textrm{X}^1\Sigma^+$ ground electronic state. We show that the excited metastable $\textrm{X}^1\Sigma^+$+$\textrm{b}^3\Pi$ electronic manifold supports FL tetramers in a broader range of electric fields with collisional shielding extended to zero field. We calculate the Franck-Condon factors between the ground and excited FL tetramers and show that they are highly tunable with the electric field. We also predict photoassociation of ground-state shielded molecules to the excited FL states in free-bound optical transitions. We propose proof-of-principle experiments to implement stimulated Raman adiabatic passage and photoassociation using FL tetramers, paving the way for the formation of deeply bound ultracold polyatomic molecules.

Title: All-Dielectric Metasurface with a Two-Dimensional Locally Flat Photonic Band
Authors: Minho Choi, Christopher Munley, Virat Tara, Arnab Manna, Johannes Fröch, Arthur Barnard, Arka Majumdar
Abstract: Photonic flatbands offer promising light-matter interaction due to their unique slow-light nature. In recent years, flatbands have also attracted significant interest in optical engineering because of their angle-insensitive resonant characteristics. However, to date, no studies have reported the dispersionless behavior of flatbands under arbitrary two-dimensional incident angles. Here, we present a two-dimensional photonic flatband created using a silicon metasurface with a Lieb lattice-inspired structure which demonstrates a locally flat photonic band for both transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) polarized light. Employing Fourier imaging, we analyze the energy-momentum dispersion of the flatband metasurface under arbitrary two-dimensional incident angles, demonstrating dispersionless flatbands with a change in resonance within $\pm2 nm$ up to $\pm24ô$ or $\pm5ô$, depending on the polarization state and incident angle. This geometry can be adapted for various applications in local field enhancement, enhanced photodetection, and augmented reality displays.

Title: Toward a Complexity Classification of High-Temperature Bosons: Computational Tractability and Power-Law Clustering
Authors: Xin-Hai Tong, Tomotaka Kuwahara
Abstract: Determining when quantum many-body systems admit simple, efficiently simulable structure is a central problem. High-temperature thermal states are a natural candidate for such simplicity, yet for bosons, the unbounded local Hilbert space and energy invalidate the usual expectation that large $T$ guarantees tractability. Here we investigate the resulting complexity boundary for interacting lattice bosons and show that the repulsive Bose--Hubbard class lies on the ``simple'' side. For a family with long-range hopping decaying as $r^{-\alpha}$, we prove convergence of a controlled cluster expansion, which implies (above an explicit temperature threshold) an efficient classical algorithm to approximate the partition function and a rigorous power-law clustering bound for connected correlations. More broadly, our results provide a first step toward charting complexity boundaries for high-temperature bosons and suggest the repulsive Bose--Hubbard class as a natural candidate cusp.

Title: Exact State Evolution and Energy Spectrum in Solvable Bosonic Models
Authors: Valery Shchesnovich
Abstract: Solvable bosonic models provide a fundamental framework for describing light propagation in nonlinear media, including optical down-conversion processes that generate squeezed states of light and their higher-order generalizations. In quantum optics a central objective is to determine the time evolution of a given initial state. Exact analytic solution to the state-evolution problem is presented, applicable to a broad class of solvable bosonic models and arbitrary initial states. Moreover, the characteristic equation governing the energy spectrum is derived and the eigenstates are found in the form of continued fractions and as the principal minors of the associated Jacobi matrix. The results provide a solid analytical framework for discussion of exactly solvable bosonic models.

Title: Hybrid Lattice Surgery: Non-Clifford Gates via Non-Abelian Surface Codes
Authors: Sheng-Jie Huang, Alison Warman, Sakura Schafer-Nameki, Yanzhu Chen
Abstract: In universal fault-tolerant quantum computing, implementing logical non-Clifford gates often demands substantial spacetime resources for many error-correcting codes, including the high-threshold surface code. A critical mission for realizing large-scale quantum computing is to develop simple and resource-efficient implementations of logical non-Clifford gates. We propose a novel way of implementing non-Clifford operations in the standard surface code based on hybrid lattice surgery. First we generalize the standard lattice surgery to hybrid lattice surgery, where operations of rough merge and rough split happen across different topological codes. Then we apply such procedures between Abelian and non-Abelian codes and show that this can provide non-Clifford operations in the standard surface code, in the form of a magic state or a non-Clifford gate teleportation. Complementing this, we provide a continuum topological field theory description of this hybrid lattice surgery utilizing interfaces between (2+1)d topological orders. From these considerations, we can generalize our protocol to non-Clifford gates and magic states at all finite levels of the Clifford hierarchy, as well as gates beyond the hierarchy. We also discuss protocols extending this framework to qutrits.

Title: Effects of thermal annealing and film thickness on the structural and optical properties of indium-tin-oxide thin films
Authors: Ding Xu, Wen Zhou, Yuxin Du, Junying Zhang, Wei Zhang, Jiangjing Wang
Abstract: Indium-tin oxide (ITO) is a crucial functional layer for the optoelectronic applications, such as non-volatile color display thin films based on the ITO/phase-change material (PCM)/ITO/reflective metal multilayer structures on a silicon substrate. In addition to non-volatile color tuning by PCMs, thermally induced crystallization may alter the optical properties of ITO layers as well. But the potential change in color of the ITO layers is not considered so far. In this work, we investigate the structural and optical properties of ITO thin films via X-ray diffraction, spectroscopic ellipsometry and ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry measurements. After thermal annealing at 250 °C, the ITO thin films of 15-100 nm get crystallized with strong changes in refractive index n and extinction coefficient k in the visible light range. However, for the 5-nm ITO thin film, crystallization is only observed after thermal annealing at 350 °C and the change in color is limited upon phase transition. We provide a colormap of the ITO/platinum/silicon structure in terms of the annealing temperature (150-350 °C) and ITO film thickness (5-100 nm). Our work suggests that the intrinsic change in colors of ITO layers should also be considered for the PCM-based reconfigurable display application.

Title: Entanglement Through Topological Defects: Reconciling Theory with Numerics
Authors: Christian Northe, Paolo Rossi
Abstract: Present theoretical predictions for the entanglement entropy through topological defects are violated by numerical simulations. In order to resolve this, we introduce a paradigm shift in the preparation of reduced density matrices in the presence of topological defects, and emphasize the role of defect networks with which they can be dressed. We consider the cases of grouplike and duality defects in detail for the Ising model, and find agreement with all numerically found entanglement entropies. Since our construction functions at the level of reduced density matrices, it accounts for topological defects beyond the entanglement entropy to other entanglement measures.

Title: Unsupervised Topological Phase Discovery in Periodically Driven Systems via Floquet-Bloch State
Authors: Chen-Yang Wang, Jing-Ping Xu, Ce Wang, Ya-Ping Yang
Abstract: Floquet engineering offers an unparalleled platform for realizing novel non-equilibrium topological phases. However, the unique structure of Floquet systems, which includes multiple quasienergy gaps, poses a significant challenge to classification using conventional analytical methods. We propose a novel unsupervised machine learning framework that employs a kernel defined in momentum-time ($\boldsymbol{k},t$) space, constructed directly from Floquet-Bloch eigenstates. This approach is intrinsically data-driven and requires no prior knowledge of the underlying topological invariants, providing a fundamental advantage over prior methods that rely on abstract concepts like the micromotion operator or homotopic transformations. Crucially, this work successfully reveals the intrinsic topological characteristics encoded within the Floquet eigenstates themselves. We demonstrate that our method robustly and simultaneously identifies the topological invariants associated with both the $0$-gap and the $\pi$-gap across various symmetry classes (1D AIII, 1D D, and 2D A), establishing a robust methodology for the systematic classification and discovery of complex non-equilibrium topological matter.
