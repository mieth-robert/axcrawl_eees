Title: Fluoride doping into SiO2-MgO-CaO bioactive glass nanoparticles: bioactivity, biodegradation and biocompatibility assessments
Authors: N. Esmati, T. Khodaei, E. Salahinejad, E. Sharifi
Abstract: In this research, for the first time, the structure, bioactivity, biodegradation and biocompatibility of SiO2-MgO-CaO glasses doped with different levels of fluoride were studied. The glassy powder samples were synthesized by a coprecipitation method followed by calcination at 500 C, where amorphicity and fluoride incorporation were verified by X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy, respectively. The in vitro biomineralization and biodegradation of the samples were also investigated by electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. These assessments revealed that there is an optimum level of fluoride doping to meet the highest bioactivity. Remarkably, the same level of incorporation presented the foremost biocompatibility with respect to osteoblast-like MG-63 human cells, as realized by the MTT assay and cell attachment studies.

Title: Theoretical Prediction of optimal $T_c$ for Nickelate $\mathrm{La_{3-x}Sm_{x}Ni_{2}O_{7-δ}}$
Authors: Xiuqing Huang
Abstract: Recently, the nickel-based superconductor $T_c$ record was updated to $96\ \text{K}$ in bilayer $\mathrm{La_{3-x}Sm_{x}Ni_{2}O_{7-\delta}}$ (LSNO) under pressure, raising a critical question: Can its $T_c$ exceed the 164 K benchmark of copper-based superconductors? We find that both monoclinic and tetragonal LSNO have an octahedral quantum well structure (determining $T_c$) nearly identical to $\mathrm{YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}}$ (YBCO). Based on the formula $T_c = \Lambda/\xi^{2}$ (Planck ground-state quantum well oscillator hypothesis, $\xi$ = lattice parameter-determined quantum well depth), we predict Sm-doped nickelate $T_c$ values of $93.4\ \text{K}$ (monoclinic) and $97.1\ \text{K}$ (tetragonal), in excellent agreement with experimental data ($92\ \text{K}$ and $96\ \text{K}$). Notably, despite distinct composition and symmetry (LSNO: $P2_1/m$; YBCO: $Pmmm$), their $\xi$ ($3.6629\ Å$ vs $3.6720\ Å$) and $T_c$ ($92\ \text{K}$ vs $93\ \text{K}$) are nearly identical. This validates the proposed superconducting formula and unifies copper-based and nickel-based superconductors at the angstrom-scale octahedral quantum well. Further predictions indicate the maximum achievable $T_c$ for lanthanide-based nickelates (regardless of layer number) is $\sim100\ \text{K}$.

Title: Topological phonons in anomalous Hall crystals
Authors: Mark R. Hirsbrunner, Félix Desrochers, Joe Huxford, Yong Baek Kim
Abstract: Recent experiments on few-layer graphene structures have reported indirect signatures of anomalous Hall crystals (AHCs), but the need for a top gate to stabilize the phase precludes direct imaging of the emergent electronic lattice. This situation necessitates the investigation of alternative signatures of AHCs. The gapless phonons of the emergent electronic lattice provide a clear distinction from conventional quantum Hall states, but it may be difficult to disentangle these phonons from the plethora of other possible low-lying modes. Intriguingly, the quantum geometry of the underlying electronic ground state can imprint on the collective modes, possibly leading the phonons themselves to be topological. Were this the case, the resulting neutral chiral edge modes would provide a further signature of an AHC. Using time-dependent Hartree-Fock, we compute the spectra of collective modes of Wigner crystals (WCs) and AHCs arising in minimal models and study the topology of the phonons and low-lying excitons. Across the WC to AHC transition, we observe a series of band inversions among collective modes, producing topological phonons and excitons, and a sharp sign change in the phonon Chern number upon entering the AHC phase. We conclude by discussing the relevance of collective mode topology to experiments on candidate systems for AHCs.

Title: An assessment of mechanism-based plasticity models for polycrystalline magnesium alloys
Authors: R. Vigneshwaran, Showren Datta, A. A. Benzerga, Shailendra P. Joshi
Abstract: The objective of this work is to assess computationally efficient coarse-grained plasticity models against high-fidelity crystal plasticity simulations for magnesium polycrystals over a wide range of textures and grain sizes. A basic requirement is that such models are able to capture {\it evolving} plastic anisotropy and tension-compression asymmetry. To this end, two-surface and three-surface plasticity models are considered. The two-surface constitutive formulation separately accounts for slip and twinning, while the three-surface model further apportions the contributions of basal and nonbasal slip. Model identification is based on stress-strain responses for loading along six orientations under both tension and compression. The evolution of overall plastic anisotropy, as well as microscale relative activities of slip and twin systems, is analyzed in detail. The prospects of using coarse-grained plasticity models in guiding the development of physically sound damage models for magnesium alloys are discussed.

Title: Sizes of Ferroelectricity Appearance and Disappearence in Nanosized Hafnia-Zirconia:Landau-type Theory
Authors: Anna N. Morozovska, Eugene A. Eliseev, Sergei V. Kalinin, Maksym V. Strikha
Abstract: Nanosized hafnia-zirconia HfxZr1-xO2 in the form of thin films, multilayers and heterostructures are indispensable silicon-compatible ferroelectric materials for advanced electronic memories and logic devices. The distinctive feature of nanoscale hafnia-zirconia are the critical sizes of ferroelectricity appearance, whereas the critical sizes of ferroelectricity disappearance exist in other ferroelectrics. Using the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire free energy functional with higher powers, trilinear and biquadratic couplings of polar, nonpolar and antipolar order parameters, we calculated analytically the strain-dependent critical sizes of the ferroelectricity appearance and disappearance, analyzed how the size effect and mismatch strains influence the phase diagrams and polarization switching barrier in epitaxial HfO2 thin films and nano-islands with the out-of-plane spontaneous polarization. We have shown that the critical thickness/height of out-of-plane spontaneous polarization disappearance is determined by the size dependence of the depolarization field and correlation effects. The critical thickness/height of the ferroelectricity appearance is determined by the size dependence of the effective mismatch strain considering possible appearance of misfit dislocations and lateral relaxion of strains. Derived analytical expressions can be generalized for HfxZr1-xO2 solid solutions, providing that corresponding parameters of the free energy are known from the first principles calculations.

Title: Spin Hall effect in van der Waals ferromagnet Fe$_{5}$GeTe$_{2}$
Authors: Tomoharu Ohta, Yuto Samukawa, Nan Jiang, Yasuhiro Niimi, Kohei Yamagami, Yoshinori Okada, Yoshichika Otani, Kouta Kondou
Abstract: We investigate the spin Hall effect (SHE) in a van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnet Fe$_{5}$GeTe$_{2}$ (FGT) with a Curie temperature $T_{\rm C}$ of 310 K utilizing the spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance method. In synchronization with the emergence of the ferromagnetic phase resulting in the anomalous Hall effect (AHE), a noticeable enhancement in the SHE was observed below $T_{\rm C}$. On the other hand, the SHE shows a different temperature dependence from the AHE: the effective spin Hall conductivity is clearly enhanced with decreasing temperature unlike the anomalous Hall conductivity, reflecting the variation of band-structure accompanied by the complicated magnetic ordering of the FGT. The results provide a deep understanding of the SHE in magnetic materials to open a new route for novel functionalities in vdW materials-based spintronic devices.

Title: Confinement-controlled chase-escape dynamics
Authors: R. G. Rossatto, H. Ariel Alvarez, C. Manuel Carlevaro, José Rafael Bordin
Abstract: We investigate a minimal chase-and-escape model on a two-dimensional square lattice with randomly distributed static obstacles, focusing on how geometric disorder controls collective pursuit dynamics. Chasers and escapers move according to short-range sensing rules, while the density of obstacles tunes the connectivity of the accessible space. Using a combination of geometric analysis, dynamical observables, survival statistics, and transport characterization, we establish a direct link between lattice connectivity and pursuit efficiency. A Breadth-First Search analysis reveals that obstacle-induced fragmentation leads to a progressive loss of accessibility before the percolation threshold, defining the effective initial conditions for the dynamics. The trapping time and capture cost exhibit a non-monotonic dependence on obstacle density, reflecting a competition between path elongation in connected environments and geometric confinement near the percolation threshold. Survival analysis shows that the decay of the escaper population follows a Weibull form, with characteristic time and shape parameters displaying clear crossovers as a function of obstacle density, signaling the coexistence of cooperative capture and confinement-dominated trapping. Transport properties, quantified through the mean-squared displacement exponent, further support this picture, revealing sub-diffusive dynamics and a convergence toward a geometry-controlled regime near percolation. Overall, our results demonstrate that chase--and--escape dynamics in disordered environments are governed by a geometry-driven crossover, where percolation and connectivity act as unifying control parameters for spatial, temporal, and collective behavior.

Title: Coexistence of superconductivity and charge density wave in a correlated regime
Authors: E. J. Calegari, L. C. Prauchner, A. C. Lausmann, S. G. Magalhaes
Abstract: To investigate the coexistence of superconductivity and charge density wave (CDW) in a correlated regime, we employ the Green's functions formalism, as well as the Hubbard-I approximation, as a way to introduce the correlations into the problem, in the form of a repulsive Coulomb interaction $U$. In addition, we investigate the effects of second-nearest neighbor hopping $t_1$ on a pure CDW state. The analysis of the results show that, for small values of $t_1$, both CDW and superconducting gaps compete for the same region on the Fermi surface. The increase of $t_1$ decreases the competition and may lead the system to a coexistence regime. Effects of temperature in the coexistence regime, are also investigated.

Title: Local structure characterization in particle systems
Authors: Rachael S. Skye, Erin G. Teich
Abstract: Many tools and techniques measure local structure in materials in contexts ranging from biology to geology. We provide a survey of those tools and metrics that are especially useful for analyzing particulate soft matter. The metrics we discuss can all be computed from the positions of particles, and are thus most useful when there is access to this information, either from simulation or experimental imaging. For each metric, we provide derivations, intuition regarding its implications, example uses, and references to software packages that compute the metric. Our survey encompasses characterization techniques ranging from the simplest to the most complex, and will be useful for students getting started in the structural characterization of particle systems.

Title: Dynamic nanoscale spatial heterogeneity in a perovskite to brownmillerite topotactic phase transformation
Authors: Nicolò D'Anna, Erik S. Lamb, Robin Glefke, Daseul Ham, Ishmam Nihal, Su Yong Lee, Yayoi Takamura, Oleg Shpyrko
Abstract: Phase transitions are omnipresent in modern condensed matter physics and its applications. In solids, phase transformations typically occur by nucleation and growth under non-equilibrium conditions. Under constant external conditions, $\textit{e.g.}$, constant heating temperature and pressure, the nucleation and growth dynamics are often thought of as spatially and temporally independent. Here, $\textit{in-situ}$ Bragg X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) reveals nanoscale spatial and dynamical heterogeneity in the perovskite to brownmillerite topotactic phase transformation in La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$CoO$_3$ (LSCO) thin films under constant reducing conditions over a time-span of multiple hours. Specifically, a timescale associated with domain growth remains stable, with a corresponding domain wall speed of $v_d = 6 \pm 0.5 \times10^{-4}$ nm/s ($2 \pm 0.2$ nm/h), while a slower timescale, associated with temperature driven de-pinning of domains, leads to accelerating dynamics with timescales following an aging power law with exponent $-2.2 \pm 0.5$. The experiment demonstrates that Bragg XPCS is a powerful tool to study nanoscale dynamics in phase transformations. The results are relevant for phase engineering of phase-change devices, as they show that nanoscale dynamics, linked to domain and domain-wall motion, can continuously evolve and speed up with time, even hours after the initiation of the phase transformation, with potential repercussions on electrical performance.

Title: Mechanisms of alkali ionic transport in amorphous oxyhalides solid state conductors
Authors: Luca Binci, KyuJung Jun, Bowen Deng, Gerbrand Ceder
Abstract: Amorphous oxyhalides have attracted significant attention due to their relatively high ionic conductivity ($>$1 mS cm$^{-1}$), excellent chemical stability, mechanical softness, and facile synthesis routes via standard solid-state reactions. These materials exhibit an ionic conductivity that is almost independent of the underlying chemistry, in stark contrast to what occurs in crystalline conductors. In this work, we employ an accurately fine-tuned machine learning interatomic potential to construct large-scale molecular dynamics trajectories encompassing hundreds of nanoseconds to obtain statistically converged transport properties. We find that the amorphous state consists of chain fragments of metal-anion tetrahedra of various lenght. By analyzing the residence time of alkali cations migrating around tetrahedrally-coordinated trivalent metal ions, we find that oxygen anions on the metal-anion tetrahedra limit alkali diffusion. By computing the full Einstein expression of the ionic conductivity, we demonstrate that the alkali transference number of these materials is strongly influenced by distinct-particles correlations, while at the same time they are characterized by an alkali Haven ratio close to one, implying that ionic transport is largely dictated by uncorrelated self-diffusion. Finally, by extending this analysis to chemical compositions $AMX_{2.5}\textsf{O}_{0.75}$, spanning different alkaline ($A$ = Li, Na, K), metallic ($M$ = Al, Ga, In), and halogen ($X$ = Cl, Br, I) species, we clarify why the diffusion properties of these materials remain largely insensitive to variations in atomic chemistry.

Title: Reaction-Diffusion Driven Patterns in Immiscible Alloy Thin Films
Authors: Vivek C. Peddiraju, Shourya Dutta-Gupta, Subhradeep Chatterjee
Abstract: We demonstrate local microstructural modification of thin films through film-substrate interactions. Metastable single-phase Ag-Cu thin films are deposited on Si substrates pre-patterned by FIB milling. During post-deposition annealing, localized film-substrate reaction around the milled patterns produces a distinct microstructure termed as the halo. It consists of copper silicide and almost pure Ag, while the far-field film forms a random mixture of Cu and Ag-rich domains through phase separation. We show that the extent of the halo can be controlled by varying the temperature and duration of annealing. However, its length scale does not follow the square-root time dependence typical of diffusional growth. We build a semi-analytical kinetic model of halo growth that incorporates species balance, diffusional transport and a modified Stefan condition. Predictions of the model agree well with the experimental findings and the species diffusivity through the film is obtained through an inverse optimization procedure.

Title: Weakly spin-dependent band structures of antiferromagnetic perovskite LaMO$_3$ (M = Cr, Mn, Fe)
Authors: Takuya Okugawa, Kaoru Ohno, Yusuke Noda, Shinichiro Nakamura
Abstract: We investigate spin-dependent electronic states of antiferromagnetic (AFM) lanthanum chromite (LaCrO$_3$), lanthanum manganite (LaMnO$_3$), and lanthanum ferrite (LaFeO$_3$) using spin-polarized first-principles density functional theory (DFT) with Hubbard U correction. The band structures are calculated for 15 types of their different AFM structures. It is verified for these structures that there is a very simple rule to identify which wave number k exhibits spin splitting or degeneracy in the band structure. This rule uses the symmetry operations that map the up-spin atoms onto the down-spin atoms. The resulting spin splitting is very small for the most stable spin configuration of the most stable experimental structure. We discuss a plausible benefit of this characteristic, i.e., the direction-independence of the spin current, in electrode applications.

Title: Emergence of Kugel-Khomskii physics in quarter-filled bilayer correlated systems
Authors: Guijing Duan, Yunlong Wang, Zhiguang Liao, Changle Liu, Rong Yu
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of the low-energy physics of a quarter-hole-filled two-orbital bilayer Hubbard model motivated by transition-metal bilayer systems with strong orbital-selective interlayer hybridization. By explicitly treating the strong interlayer bonding of dz2 orbitals within a molecular orbital basis and projecting out high-energy electronic states, we derive a low-energy effective Kugel-Khomskii Hamiltonian describing the interplay between electron spin and emergent layer pseudospin degrees of freedom. We map out a rich ground state phase diagram featuring diverse spin and charge ordered states. These include conventional ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases with layer staggered charge densities, a layer-coherent phase characterized by spontaneous interlayer quantum coherence, and a novel maximally spin-layer-entangled phase with a hidden composite spin-layer order. We show that this exotic hidden ordered phase arises from the spontaneous breaking of an emergent O(4) symmetry down to a O(3), manifesting a unique excitation spectrum with three entangled gapless Goldstone modes. Our results uncover a geometrically driven mechanism for realizing composite entanglement in strongly correlated bilayer systems and provide a concrete theoretical framework relevant to bilayer nickelate superconductors and other multi-component correlated materials.

Title: Emission of time-ordered photon pairs from a single polaritonic Bogoliubov mode
Authors: Ferdinand Claude, Yueguang Zhou, Sylvain Ravets, Jacqueline Bloch, Martina Morassi, Aristide Lemaître, Alberto Bramati, Anna Minguzzi, Iacopo Carusotto, Irénée Frérot, Maxime Richard
Abstract: In many-body quantum systems, interactions drive the emergence of correlations that are at the heart of the most intriguing states of matter. A remarkable example is the case of weakly interacting bosonic systems, whose ground state is a squeezed vacuum state, and whose elementary excitations have a collective nature. In this work, we report on the direct observation of the peculiar microscopic quantum structure of these elementary excitations. We perform time- and frequency-resolved two-photon correlation measurements on the fluctuations of weakly interacting polaritons in a resonantly-driven microcavity, and observe that upon decreasing the average number of fluctuation quanta below unity, large pair correlations build up together with strong time-ordering of the emitted photons. This behavior is a direct signature of the particle-hole quantum superposition which is at the heart of Bogoliubov excitations.

Title: Superconductivity in epitaxial PtSb(0001) thin films
Authors: C. Müller, S. P. Bommanaboyena, A. Badura, T. Uchimura, F. Husstedt, B. V. Schwarze, S. Banerjee, M. Ledinský, J. Michalicka, M. Míšek, M. Šindler, T. Helm, S. Fukami, F. Krizek, D. Kriegner
Abstract: We report superconductivity in epitaxial PtSb(0001) thin films grown on SrF2(111). Electrical transport measurements reveal a superconducting transition at $T_{\mathrm c}=1.72$ K. The field-induced broadening of the transition and the presence of finite upper critical fields are consistent with type-II superconductivity. We determine the resistively defined upper critical fields for magnetic fields applied perpendicular and parallel to the film plane and parameterize their temperature dependence using an anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau approach. For the thickest film ($d=50$ nm), this yields coherence lengths of $\xi_{ab}\approx 55$ nm and $\xi_c\approx 14$ nm. Current-voltage characteristics show sizeable critical currents, with a critical current density reaching $J_{\mathrm c}\approx 6e4$ A/cm$^2$ at 0.5 K. These results establish epitaxial PtSb as a superconducting thin-film platform compatible with lattice-matched heterostructures in the NiAs-type materials family.

Title: The role of ZnO/ZnS nanostructures decoration of Ni foam on the electrochemical energy storage process
Authors: Alessia Fischetti, Giacometta Mineo, Daniela Russo, Francesco Salutari, Claudio Lentini Campallegio, Elena Bruno, Jordi Arbiol, Giorgia Franzò, Salvatore Mirabella, Vincenzina Strano, M. Chiara Spadaro
Abstract: Low-cost and environmentally friendly electrochemical energy storage systems are crucial to address the increasing global energy demand. Nanomaterials can play a pivotal role in catalysing charge storage and/or exchange, still the underlying mechanism often remains poorly investigated, as for ZnO/ZnS nanostructures onto Ni foam. In this work, we investigate hydrothermally grown ZnO/ZnS nanostructures decorating Ni foam for energy storage application. Morphology, structure and composition are evaluated via electron microscopy-based methodologies. The electrochemical energy storage performance is evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements with the aim to highlight the energy storage mechanism. When nickel foam (NF) is used as substrate, the system shows a predominant pseudocapacitive behaviour. By contrast, a modest and capacitive performance is measured on graphene paper (GP). Mott-Schottky (M-S) and open circuit potential (OCP) measurements suggests a key role of hole reservoir in ZnS decoration which boosts NF performances.

Title: Effect of substrate mismatch, orientation, and flexibility on heterogeneous ice nucleation
Authors: Miguel Camarillo, Javier Oller-Iscar, María M. Conde, Jorge Ramírez, Eduardo Sanz
Abstract: Heterogeneous nucleation is the main path to ice formation on Earth. The ice nucleating ability of a certain substrate is mainly determined by both molecular interactions and the structural mismatch between the ice and the substrate lattices. We focus on the latter factor using molecular simulations of the mW model. Quantifying the effect of structural mismatch alone is challenging due to its coupling with molecular interactions. To disentangle both factors, we use a substrate composed of water molecules in such a way that any variation on the nucleation temperature can be exclusively ascribed to the structural mismatch. We find that a one per cent increase of structural mismatch leads to a decrease of approximately 4 K in the nucleation temperature. We also analyse the effect of the orientation of the substrate with respect to the liquid. The three main ice orientations (basal, primary prism and secondary prism) have a similar ice nucleating ability. We finally asses the effect of lattice flexibility by comparing substrates where molecules are immobile with others where a certain freedom to fluctuate around the lattice positions is allowed. Interestingly, we find that the latter type of substrate is more efficient in nucleating ice because it can adapt its structure to that of ice.

Title: Altermagnetism in exactly solvable model: the Ising-Kondo lattice model
Authors: Miaomiao Zhao, Wei-Wei Yang, Yin Zhong
Abstract: Altermagnet (AM), a recently identified class of collinear magnet, has garnered significant attention due to its unique combination of zero net magnetization and spin-split energy bands, leading to a variety of novel physical phenomena. Using numerically exact lattice Monte Carlo simulations, we investigate AM-like phases within the Ising-Kondo lattice model which is commonly employed to describe heavy-fermion materials. By incorporating an alternating next-nearest-neighbor hopping (NNNH) term, which arises from the influence of non-magnetic atoms in altermagnetic candidate materials, our results reveal key signatures of AM-like states, including spin-splitting quasiparticle bands and spectral functions, and demonstrate that d-wave AM remains stable across a broad range of interaction strengths, doping levels, NNNH amplitudes and temperatures, highlighting its robustness. Furthermore, through an analysis of non-magnetic impurity effects, we further confirm the d-wave symmetry of the AM phase. These findings establish a solid theoretical foundation for exploring AM-like phases in f-electron compounds, paving the way for future investigations into their exotic magnetic and electronic properties.

Title: On unconstrained solidification of spherical metallic drops
Authors: Priti Ranjan Panda, Harish Singh Dhami, Koushik Viswanathan
Abstract: The solidification of metallic droplets into powder particles involves a complex interplay between heat diffusion, surface tension, and geometric constraints. In confined, curved systems -- such as those encountered in atomisation, abrasion, and micrometeorite formation -- positive curvature and finite boundaries significantly modify classical solidification dynamics. In this study, we systematically investigate the solidification of metallic spheres, focusing on how curvature and confinement influence nucleation pathways, growth kinetics, and interfacial stability. Two competing growth modes -- radial outward and circumferential -- are analysed using Stefan-type models under a quasi-steady approximation. A generalisation of Mullins--Sekerka stability theory is developed to account for finite spherical domains, revealing that particle size and curvature introduce new destabilising parameters that govern microstructural length scales. Experimental observations of dendritic and cellular morphologies are interpreted through this framework, demonstrating that the interaction between growth fronts, undercooling, and curvature collectively determines the final particle structure. These findings underscore the need to re-evaluate classical solidification theories in the context of curved geometries, with implications for both engineered and naturally occurring metal powders.

Title: Topological $Z_4$ spin-orbital liquid on the honeycomb lattice
Authors: Masahiko G. Yamada
Abstract: The density matrix renormalisation group (DMRG) is one of the most powerful numerical methods for strongly correlated condensed matter systems. We extend DMRG to the case with the $\mathrm{SU}(N_c)$ symmetry with $N_c > 2$, including two-dimensional systems. As a killer application, we simulate the ground state of the $\mathrm{SU}(4)$ Heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice, which can potentially be realised in cold atomic systems and solid state systems like $\alpha$-ZrCl$_3$. We keep up to 12800 $\mathrm{SU}(4)$ states equivalent to more than a million $\mathrm{U}(1)$ states. This supermassive DMRG simulation reveals the quantum spin-orbital liquid ground state, which has been conjectured for more than a decade. The methodology developed here can be extended to any classical Lie groups, paving the way to a next-generation DMRG with a full symmetry implementation.

Title: Beyond Predicted ZT: Machine Learning Strategies for the Experimental Discovery of Thermoelectric Materials
Authors: Shoeb Athar, Philippe Jund
Abstract: The discovery of high-performance thermoelectric (TE) materials for advancing green energy harvesting from waste heat is an urgent need in the context of looming energy crisis and climate change. The rapid advancement of machine learning (ML) has accelerated the design of thermoelectric (TE) materials, yet a persistent "gap" remains between high-accuracy computational predictions and their successful experimental validation. While ML models frequently report impressive test scores (R^2 values of 0.90-0.98) for complex TE properties (zT, power factor, and electrical/thermal conductivity), only a handful of these predictions have culminated in the experimental discovery of new high-zT materials. In this review, we identify and discuss that the primary obstacles are poor model generalizability-stemming from the "small-data" problem, sampling biases in cross-validation, and inadequate structural representation-alongside the critical challenge of thermodynamic phase stability. Moreover, we argue that standard randomized validation often overestimates model performance by ignoring "hidden hierarchies" and clustering within chemical families. Finally, to bridge this gap between ML-predictions and experimental realization, we advocate for advanced validation strategies like PCA-based sampling and a synergetic active learning loop that integrates ML "fast filters" for stability (e.g., GNoME) with high-throughput combinatorial thin-film synthesis to rapidly map stable, high-zT compositional spaces.

Title: A Rechargeable Chromium Battery
Authors: Apurva Anjan, Adwitiya Rao, Rohit M. Manoj, Vrindha Pongalat, Varad Mahajani, Sohail Shah, Mukesh Bacchav, Chandra Veer Singh, Nikhil Koratkar
Abstract: Multivalent ions exchange multiple electrons during redox reactions, leading to the possibility of improved energy storage performance. A variety of multivalent ions, including zinc (Zn$^{2+}$), magnesium (Mg$^{2+}$), calcium (Ca$^{2+}$), aluminum (Al$^{3+}$), and indium (In$^{3+}$), have been deployed in rechargeable batteries with varying degrees of success \cite{1-9}. While chromium (Cr$^{3+}$) offers a superior volumetric capacity (approximately $11117\ \mathrm{mAh\ cm^{-3}}$) compared to the aforementioned cations, there is no report of a rechargeable chromium battery. This is because chromium metal spontaneously oxidizes to form a passivating oxide layer \cite{10} that blocks Cr$^{3+}$ ingress and egress. Here, we show that this fundamental limitation can be overcome by developing a chromium-rich high-entropy alloy. The alloy consists of five elements (Cr, bismuth (Bi), copper (Cu), tin (Sn), and nickel (Ni)), producing a multi-element native oxide rich in heterointerfaces. Some of these interfaces (such as Cr$_2$O$_3$/Bi$_2$O$_3$) exhibit a very low barrier for Cr$^{3+}$ diffusion, offering multiple pathways for efficient Cr$^{3+}$ insertion and extraction, while others (such as Cr$_2$O$_3$/CuO) block oxygen transport, thereby suppressing further oxidation. In a symmetric cell configuration, the chromium alloy supports approximately $10000$ hours (about $5000$ cycles) of reversible chromium insertion and extraction at an overpotential of only $20$ mV. The chromium-rich alloy anode was also successfully paired with a sulfur cathode to cycle reversibly in a full-cell configuration. These findings could stimulate fundamental studies on chromium-ion batteries and high-entropy alloy electrodes, opening new pathways for multivalent energy storage.

Title: Influence of Surface Functionalization on the Colloidal Stability and Magnetic Properties of Ferrite Nanoparticles
Authors: Arif Iqbal Sheikh, Radha Srinivasan
Abstract: Magnetite ferrite (Fe3O4) nanoparticles have attracted considerable interest due to their tunable physico-chemical properties and relevance in functional materials. In this work, uncoated Fe3O4 nanoparticles and surface-modified Fe3O4 nanoparticles coated with polyethylene glycol (PEG-6000) and citric acid (CA) were synthesized via a chemical co-precipitation method. The effect of surface functionalization on the structural, spectroscopic, magnetic, and colloidal properties of the nanoparticles was systematically investigated. X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the formation of phase-pure Fe3O4 with an inverse spinel structure for all the samples. Fourier transform infrared and Raman spectroscopy verified successful surface modification while preserving the Fe-O framework of the magnetite core. Dynamic light scattering and zeta potential measurements indicated improved dispersion and colloidal stability for the surface-modified nanoparticles. Magnetization studies performed at room temperature revealed superparamagnetic behaviour for all samples, accompanied by a coating-dependent reduction in saturation magnetization. Overall, the results emphasize the critical role of surface chemistry in tailoring the physicochemical, magnetic, and colloidal behaviour of Fe3O4 nanoparticles. Keywords: Fe3O4 nanoparticles, PEG, Citric acid, Co-precipitation, Surface functionalization, Zeta potential, Colloidal stability, Magnetic properties

Title: Snapping and Switching of Elastic Arches with Patterned Preferred Curvature
Authors: Michał Zmyślony, Ammar Khan, John S. Biggins
Abstract: An elastic arch is an archetypal bistable system. Here, we combine elastica theory and photo-mechanical experiments to elucidate the mechanics of an active arch with a spatio-temporally varying preferred curvature $\overline \kappa(s)$. Our shallow-arch theory completely describes any such system via the decomposition of its $\overline \kappa(s)$ into Euler-buckling modes. Intuitively, if $\overline \kappa(s)$ overlaps with the fundamental mode, it snaps the arch up/down. Conversely, non-overlapping $\overline \kappa(s)$ drives a second-order transition to a higher-order shape. Furthermore, the form of $\overline \kappa(s)$ enables control over the instability's character; we find the forms for snapping with maximum energy release and at the lowest stimulation (both binary patterns) and design forms for symmetric and asymmetric switching pathways. Analogous control can also be achieved in boundary-driven instabilities of passive arches by fabricating them with suitable $\overline \kappa(s)$. We thus anticipate our results will improve switchable/snapping elements in MEMS, robotics, and mechanical meta-materials.

Title: Magnetic exchange coupled nonreciprocal devices for cryogenic memory
Authors: Josep Ingla-Aynés, Lina Johnsen Kamra, Franklin Dai, Yasen Hou, Shouzhuo Yang, Peng Chen, Oleg A. Mukhanov, Jagadeesh S. Moodera
Abstract: As computing power demands continue to grow, superconducting electronics present an opportunity to reduce power consumption by increasing the energy efficiency of digital logic and memory. A key milestone for scaling this technology is the development of efficient superconducting memories. Such devices should be nonvolatile, scalable to high integration density and memory capacity, enable fast and low-power reading and writing operations, and be compatible with the digital logic. We present a versatile device platform to develop such nonvolatile memory devices consisting of an exchange-coupled ultra-thin superconductor encapsulated between two ferromagnetic insulators (FIs). The superconducting exchange coupling, which is tuneable by the relative alignment between the FI magnetizations, enables the switching of superconductivity on and off. We exploit this mechanism to create a superconducting nonvolatile memory where single-cell writing is realized using heat-assisted magnetic recording, and explain how it can become a contender for state-of-the-art superconducting memories. Furthermore, below their critical temperatures, the memory elements show a marked nonreciprocity, with zero magnetic field superconducting diode efficiencies exceeding $\pm$60%, showing the versatility of the proposed devices for superconducting computing.

Title: A Lindblad and Non-Hermitian Spectral Framework for Fragmentation Dynamics and Particle Size Distributions

Abstract: Population balance equations (PBEs) for pure fragmentation describe how particle size distributions (PSDs) evolve under breakage and fragment redistribution. We map a self-similar fragmentation class to: a conservative pure-jump master equation in log-size space; an exact Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) dilation whose diagonal sector reproduces that master equation; and a controlled small-jump limit where the dynamics reduce to a Fokker-Planck operator that can be symmetrized into a Schrodinger-type spectral problem. Two points ensure correctness and applicability. First, the Lindblad embedding is exact when the daughter kernel is interpreted in mass-weighted form (equivalently, when z*kappa(z) is a probability measure). Second, for genuinely non-Hermitian dynamics the stationary PSD is naturally a biorthogonal product of left and right ground states, not a naive modulus square; the usual modulus squared of psi appears only in pseudo-Hermitian or effectively dephased regimes. We then give a spectral dictionary linking typical PSD shapes to low-dimensional potential families in log-size space and outline inverse routes to infer effective potentials from data: parametric fitting with time-resolved PSDs, a direct steady-state inversion from a smoothed PSD, and an outlook toward inverse spectral ideas. A synthetic example demonstrates forward simulation and inverse parameter recovery in an Airy-type half-line model.

Title: Deterministic domain selection of antiferromagnets via magnetic fields
Authors: Sophie F. Weber, Veronika Sunko
Abstract: Antiferromagnets (AFMs) hold promise for applications in digital logic. However, switching AFM domains is challenging, as magnetic fields do not couple to the bulk antiferromagnetic order parameter. Here we show that magnetic-field-driven switching of AFM domains can in many cases be enabled by a generic reduction of magnetic exchange at surfaces. We use statistical mechanics and Monte Carlo simulations to demonstrate that an inequivalence in magnetic exchange between top and bottom surface moments, combined with the enhanced magnetic susceptibility of surface spins, can enable deterministic selection of antiferromagnetic domains depending on the magnetic-field ramping direction. We further show that this mechanism provides a natural interpretation for experimental observations of hysteresis in magneto-optical response of the van der Waals AFM $\mathrm{MnBi_2Te_4}$. Our findings highlight the critical role of surface spins in responses of antiferromagnets to magnetic fields. Furthermore, our results suggest that antiferromagnetic domain selection via purely magnetic means may be a more common and experimentally accessible phenomenon than previously assumed.

Title: Detecting the Onset and Progression of Spinodal Decomposition using Transient Grating Spectroscopy
Authors: Maxwell Rae, Merrill Chiang, Mahmudul Islam, Angus P. C. Wylie, Avery Nguyen, Myles Stapelberg, Saleem A. Al Dajani, Kristýna Repček, Tomáš Grabec, Abby Kaplan, Rodrigo Freitas, Michael P. Short
Abstract: Spinodal decomposition can degrade corrosion resistance and embrittle materials. The ability to quickly, conclusively, and non-destructively detect the onset of spinodal decomposition before catastrophic materials degradation would represent a significant advance in materials testing. We demonstrate that spinodal decomposition can be detected in binary Fe-Cr alloys via modulus stiffening using in situ and ex situ transient grating spectroscopy (TGS). The key mechanistic insight is the non-linearity in elastic moduli as function of Cr content renders a spinodally decomposed Fe-Cr alloy stiffer than an equivalent solid solution for a certain range of initial chromium compositions. We confirm the presence of spinodal decomposition in the 36 at.% chromium alloy using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), linked to known spinodal decomposition energetics, and show via atomistic simulations that elastic modulus stiffening is expected after spinodal decomposition in the 36 at.% chromium alloy. The results of this study suggest the potential use of TGS as a practical tool for non-destructive evaluation of key materials susceptible to such degradation.

Title: Two-Level System Microwave Losses in Chemically Pure Bulk Niobium Oxide Samples
Authors: Vishal Ganesan, Jiankun Zhang, Drew G. Wild, Alexey Bezryadin
Abstract: Losses from two-level systems (TLS) associated with amorphous oxides remain one of the primary limitations to the performance of superconducting resonators in quantum information science and precision measurements. Niobium resonators are widely used for these purposes, yet niobium's natural oxide stack contains various types of oxides whose relative contributions to TLS loss have not been clearly distinguished. Here, we use a superconducting 3D microwave cavity to measure chemically pure oxides \ch{Nb2O5} and \ch{NbO2}. Using this approach, we directly compare the loss characteristics of \ch{Nb2O5} and \ch{NbO2}. Our measurements show that the \ch{Nb2O5} oxide exhibits TLS-like power and temperature dependence. Analogous measurements performed on \ch{NbO2} do not show any detectable TLS loss signatures. These results provide direct experimental evidence that \ch{Nb2O5} is the dominant TLS host in niobium resonators and establish a general framework for separating oxide-specific dissipation channels

Title: A phase field model of the effects of dislocation microstructure on grain boundary motion during recrystallization
Authors: Yufan Zhang, Michael Zaiser
Abstract: The internal energy associated with the defect microstructure of strongly deformed crystals provides an important driving force for grain boundary motion during recrystallization. Typical dislocation microstructures are strongly heterogeneous and this heterogeneity affects the motion of recrystallization boundaries. In this study, a phase field model for microstructure evolution encompassing the evolution of both dislocation densities and grain order parameters is formulated. The model is employed to generate typical dislocation microstructures exhibiting multiscale features such as incidental and geometrically necessary dislocation walls. It is then used to study the motion of recrystallization boundaries in the associated complex defect energy 'landscape'. Results are compared to experimental observations.

Title: Aharonov-Casher Effect and the Coherent Flux Tunneling in the Hybrid Charge Quantum Interference Device
Authors: J. W. Dunstan, R. Shaikhaidarov, K. H. Kim, A. Shesterikov, I. Antonov, S. Linzen, E. V. Il'ichev, V. N. Antonov, O. V. Astafiev
Abstract: By exploiting the Aharonov-Casher effect we demonstrate a suppression of magnetic flux tunneling in a Hybrid Charge Quantum Interference Device. The main part of this device is two Josephson junctions with a small superconducting island between them. To minimize phase fluctuations across Josephson junctions, this structure is embedded in a compact super-inductive NbN loop. The Interference between the flux tunneling paths is determined by the island-induced charge, which is controlled by an external voltage. The charge sensitive operation of the device is subjected to poisoning by the quasiparticles generated in the NbN film.

Title: Higher order magnetoelasticity energy corrections in bcc and fcc systems
Authors: Jakub Šebesta, Ondřej Faiman, Dominik Legut
Abstract: Magnetoelastic properties play a vital role in industrial applications. Despite being hidden behind either purely magnetic or elastic behavior, magnetoelasticity takes place in a wide range of devices as transducers, acoustic actuators, or fast response sensors. In this work, we inspect the impact of higher-order terms on the anisotropic magnetostriction behavior. Regarding ab-initio calculations, the anisotropic magnetostriction can be related to the strain dependence of the magnetocrystaline energy. Commonly, the description is restricted to a linear strain dependence in the magnetoelastic energy. Here, we derive higher-order terms in strain for bcc and fcc crystal structures. Using a simple parametrization, we show that the influence of the higher-order strain terms is negligible for the studied cubic systems.

Title: Multiple Emulsions (W/O/W) for Confined Precipitation of Drug Nanoparticles
Authors: Umesh Dhumal
Abstract: Multiple emulsions offer a compelling route to confine nucleation and growth during drug precipitation, yet their practical use is frequently limited by kinetic fragility and sensitivity to formulation and processing conditions. Here, we develop an ultrasound-assisted, two-stage emulsification strategy to generate water-in-oil-in-water (W/O/W) multiple emulsions with sufficient stability to function as templates for forming drug-rich submicron particulates. We first establish an operating window using simple W/O emulsions, showing that increased Tween~80 concentration and intensified sonication (higher amplitude and larger probe) yield smaller droplets and reduced coarsening tendencies. Using this window, W/O/W emulsions are formulated and systematically screened via surfactant pairing across ionic, non-ionic, and polymeric stabilizers. Ionic--non-ionic combinations provide the most favorable droplet-size control, with CTAB--Tween~80 emerging as a practically robust formulation. Cyclohexane was selected as a reproducible platform oil for downstream precipitation using the lead CTAB--Tween~80 formulation. Finally, curcumin-loaded W/O/W constructs generate curcumin-rich submicron particulates, supporting multiple emulsions as experimentally accessible microstructured environments for particle engineering of poorly soluble drugs.

Title: In-context learning emerges in chemical reaction networks without attention
Authors: Carlos Floyd, Hector Manuel Lopez Rios, Aaron R. Dinner, Suriyanarayanan Vaikuntanathan
Abstract: We investigate whether chemical processes can perform in-context learning (ICL), a mode of computation typically associated with transformer architectures. ICL allows a system to infer task-specific rules from a sequence of examples without relying solely on fixed parameters. Traditional ICL relies on a pairwise attention mechanism which is not obviously implementable in chemical systems. However, we show theoretically and numerically that chemical processes can achieve ICL through a mechanism we call subspace projection, in which the entire input vector is mapped onto comparison subspaces, with the dominant projection determining the computational output. We illustrate this mechanism analytically in small chemical systems and show numerically that performance is robust to input encoding and dynamical choices, with the number of tunable degrees of freedom in the input encoding as a key limitation. Our results provide a blueprint for realizing ICL in chemical or other physical media and suggest new directions for designing adaptive synthetic chemical systems and understanding possible biological computation in cells.

Abstract: Tantalum dioxide (TaO2) is a metastable tantalum compound. Here, we report the epitaxial stabilization of TaO2 on Al2O3 (1-102) (r-plane sapphire) substrates using suboxide molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE) and thermal laser epitaxy (TLE), demonstrating single-oriented, monodomain growth of anisotropically strained thin films. Microstructural investigation is performed using synchrotron X-ray diffraction and scanning transmission electron microscopy. The tetravalent oxidation state of tantalum is confirmed using X-ray absorption and photoemission spectroscopy as well as electron energy-loss spectroscopy. Optical properties are investigated via spectroscopic ellipsometry and reveal a 0.3 eV Mott gap of the tantalum 5d electrons. Density-functional theory and group theoretical arguments are used to evaluate the limited stability of the rutile phase and reveal the potential to unlock a hidden metal-insulator transition concomitant with a structural phase transition to a distorted rutile phase, akin to NbO2. Our work expands the understanding of tantalum oxides and paves the way for their integration into next-generation electronic and photonic devices.

Title: Influence of CaO and SiO2 additives on the sintering behavior of Cr,Ca:YAG ceramics prepared by solid-state reaction sintering
Authors: .A. Chaika, G. Mancardi, O.M. Vovk
Abstract: Optical ceramics of yttrium aluminum garnet (Y3-xCaxAl4.95Cr0.05O12) doped with 0.1 at.% of chromium ions and 0.5, 0.8, and 1.2 at.% of calcium ions were prepared by reactive sintering in vacuum at 1750 degrees C. The influence of SiO2 and CaO sintering aids on the optical properties and microstructure of Cr,Ca:YAG ceramics was investigated. A decrease in CaO concentration led to a reduction of Cr,Ca:YAG transparency from 81 to 0 percent at 1064 nm; moreover, ceramics with lower CaO content exhibited abnormal grains and high porosity. These features were attributed to interactions between silica and calcium oxide during vacuum sintering. Two mechanisms are proposed to explain the effect of CaO and SiO2 on the formation of Ca,Cr:YAG ceramics. The first involves the formation of a liquid phase due to the CaO-SiO2 interaction during the heating stage, resulting in abnormal grain growth. The second mechanism is the mutual consumption of Si4+ and Ca2+ ions during the isothermal stage of sintering, which leads to a decrease in Cr4+ concentration. Both mechanisms negatively affect the optical and laser properties of the ceramics.

Title: Altermagnetism-driven FFLO superconductivity in finite-filling 2D lattices
Authors: Xia-Ji Liu, Hui Hu
Abstract: We systematically investigate the emergence of finite-momentum Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superconductivity in a square lattice Hubbard model with finite filling, driven by either $d_{xy}$-wave or $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave altermagnetic order in the presence of on-site $s$-wave attractive interactions. Our study combines mean-field calculation in the superconducting phase with pairing instability analysis of the normal state, incorporating the next-nearest-neighbor hopping in the single-particle dispersion relation. We demonstrate that the two types of altermagnetism have markedly different impacts on the stabilization of FFLO states. Specifically, $d_{xy}$-wave altermagnetism supports FFLO superconductivity over a broad parameter regime at low fillings, whereas $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave altermagnetism only induces FFLO pairing in a narrow range at high fillings. Furthermore, we find that the presence of a Van Hove singularity in the density of states tends to suppress FFLO superconductivity. These findings may provide guidance for experimental exploration of altermagnetism-induced FFLO states in real materials with more complex electronic structures.

Title: Electric field switching of altermagnetic spin-splitting in multiferroic skyrmions

Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions are localized magnetic structures that retain their shape and stability over time, thanks to their topological nature. Recent theoretical and experimental progress has laid the groundwork for understanding magnetic skyrmions characterized by negligible net magnetization and ultrafast dynamics. Notably, skyrmions emerging in materials with altermagnetism, a novel magnetic phase featuring lifted Kramers degeneracy-have remained unreported until now. In this study, we demonstrate that BiFeO3, a multiferroic renowned for its strong coupling between ferroelectricity and magnetism, can transit from a spin cycloid to a Neel-type skyrmion under antidamping spin-orbit torque at room temperature. Strikingly, the altermagnetic spin splitting within BiFeO3 skyrmion can be reversed through the application of an electric field, revealed via the Circular photogalvanic effect. This quasiparticle, which possesses a neutral topological charge, holds substantial promise for diverse applications-most notably, enabling the development of unconventional computing systems with low power consumption and magnetoelectric controllability.

Abstract: Random walks in random environments (RWRE) model transport in quenched disorder, incorporating spatial heterogeneity, trapping, random drift, and random geometry. This paper summarizes discrete and continuous time formulations, identifies principal transport regimes through quantitative observables (velocity, diffusivity, mean-square displacement, first-passage, large deviations, aging), and reviews core methods in one dimension (potential/valley mechanisms) and in higher dimensions (environment-seen-from-the-particle, correctors/homogenization, regeneration and ballisticity criteria).

Title: Wetting-coupled phase separation as an energetic mechanism for active bacterial adhesion
Authors: Dixi Yang, Anheng Wang, Jia Huang, Xiaofeng Zhuo, Chunming Wang, Hajime Tanaka, Jiaxing Yuan
Abstract: The rapid adhesion of motile bacteria from dilute suspensions poses a fundamental non-equilibrium problem: hydrodynamic interactions bias bacterial motion near surfaces without generating stable confinement, while electrostatic interactions are predominantly repulsive. Here, combining experiments on Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus in a polyethylene glycol/dextran aqueous two-phase system with large-scale hydrodynamic simulations, we identify wetting-coupled liquid--liquid phase separation (LLPS) as an energetic trapping mechanism for bacterial adhesion. When bacteria partition into a phase that preferentially wets the substrate, interfacial free-energy minimization creates a deep energetic trap that stabilizes adhesion and induces lateral clustering via capillary interactions. Crucially, bacterial motility plays a dual role: at low phase volume fractions, activity enhances transport into the wetting layer and promotes accumulation, whereas at higher phase volumes it suppresses adhesion through the formation of self-spinning droplets that generate hydrodynamic lift opposing interfacial trapping. Our results establish wetting-coupled LLPS as a generic physical route governing interfacial organization in active suspensions. This provides a unified energetic framework for bacterial adhesion in complex fluids, with broad implications for deciphering bacterial-cell interactions and controlling biofilm formation.

Title: Charged moiré phonons in twisted bilayer graphene
Authors: Alejandro Ramos-Alonso, Hector Ochoa
Abstract: Moiré phonons describe collective vibrations of a moiré superlattice produced by long-wavelength relative displacements of the constituent layers. Despite coming from the backfolding of the acoustic phonons of the individual layers, many of these modes become infrared active when the system is doped. We illustrate this effect by a direct calculation of the optical absorption of twisted bilayer graphene (tBG) around different twist angles, including the magic angle. Several modes -including the acoustic-like phason- acquire a dipole moment via interband matrix elements of the electron-phonon coupling (EPC) when the flat band is filled or emptied, giving rise to new resonances in the optical conductivity within the single-electron gap that are strongly affected by relaxation. The phason in particular gains a charge that equals the amount of electrons per moiré cell added/removed to/from neutrality. Geometrically, this can be understood as the topological quantization of a sliding Chern number. The charged phason yields a Drude-like conductivity with an effective mass that increases with lattice relaxation. Our findings are testable via THz spectroscopy, and provide an experimental knob to characterize EPC strength and disorder in moiré materials at small twist angles.

Title: Absence of magnetic order in epitaxial RuO2 revealed by X-ray linear dichroism

Abstract: Recently, the topic of altermagnetism has attracted tremendous attention and RuO2 have been demonstrated to be one of the most promising altermagnetic candidates. However, disputes still remain on the existence of magnetic order in RuO2. Here in this work, we employ X-ray linear dichroism (XLD), a widely utilized technique for characterizing antiferromagnets, in conjunction with photoemission electron microscopy and multiple scattering calculation to provide clear evidence of the absence of magnetic order in epitaxial RuO2 films. The observed XLD signal is nearly invariant with temperature and independent on cooling field direction, in stark contrast to the substantial magnetic order-related XLD signal predicted by multiple scattering calculation. This finding strongly suggests a nonmagnetic origin for RuO2. Furthermore, we observed significantly distinct XLD signals at the Ru M3 and O K edges in RuO2 films grown on TiO2 substrate with different surface orientations, which can be attributed to the low-symmetry crystal field. These results unequivocally demonstrate the absence of magnetic order in RuO2 and establishes XLD measurement as a robust technique for probing the low-symmetry magnetic materials.

Title: Introduction of Probability Density Alternation Method for Inverse Analyses of Integral Equations in Surface Science
Authors: Keito Hashidate, Rieko Iwayasu, Takumi Otake, Ken-ichi Amano
Abstract: Integral equations frequently arise in surface science, and in some cases, they must be treated as inverse problems. In our previous work on optical tweezers, atomic force microscopy, and surface force measurement apparatus, we performed inverse calculations to obtain the pressure between parallel plates from measured interaction forces. These inverse analyses were used to reconstruct solvation structures near solid surfaces and density distribution profiles of colloidal particles. In the course of these studies, we developed a method that enables inverse analyses through a unified and systematic procedure, hereafter referred to as the Probability Density Alternation (PDA) method. The central idea of this method is to reformulate a given integral equation in terms of probability density functions. In this letter, we demonstrate the validity of the PDA method both analytically and numerically. While the PDA method is less advantageous for single integral equations, it becomes a convenient and powerful approach for inverse analyses involving double or higher-order integral equations.

Title: Bgolearn: a Unified Bayesian Optimization Framework for Accelerating Materials Discovery
Authors: Bin Cao, Jie Xiong, Jiaxuan Ma, Yuan Tian, Yirui Hu, Mengwei He, Longhan Zhang, Jiayu Wang, Jian Hui, Li Liu, Dezhen Xue, Turab Lookman, Tong-Yi Zhang
Abstract: Efficient exploration of vast compositional and processing spaces is essential for accelerated materials discovery. Bayesian optimization (BO) provides a principled strategy for identifying optimal materials with minimal experiments, yet its adoption in materials science is hindered by implementation complexity and limited domain-specific tools. Here, we present Bgolearn, a comprehensive Python framework that makes BO accessible and practical for materials research through an intuitive interface, robust algorithms, and materials-oriented workflows. Bgolearn supports both single-objective and multi-objective Bayesian optimization with multiple acquisition functions (e.g., expected improvement, upper confidence bound, probability of improvement, and expected hypervolume improvement etc.), diverse surrogate models (including Gaussian processes, random forests, and gradient boosting etc.), and bootstrap-based uncertainty quantification. Benchmark studies show that Bgolearn reduces the number of required experiments by 40-60% compared with random search, grid search, and genetic algorithms, while maintaining comparable or superior solution quality. Its effectiveness is demonstrated not only through the studies presented in this paper, such as the identification of maximum-elastic-modulus triply periodic minimal surface structures, ultra-high-hardness high-entropy alloys, and high-strength, high-ductility medium-Mn steels, but also by numerous publications that have proven its impact in material discovery. With a modular architecture that integrates seamlessly into existing materials workflows and a graphical user interface (BgoFace) that removes programming barriers, Bgolearn establishes a practical and reliable platform for Bayesian optimization in materials science, and is openly available at this https URL.

Title: Nanoindentation induced plasticity in equiatomic MoTaW alloys by experimentally guided machine learning molecular dynamics simulations
Authors: F. J. Dominguez-Gutierrez, T. Stasiak, G. Markovic, A. Kosinska, K. Mulewska
Abstract: Refractory complex concentrated alloys (RCCA) exhibit exceptional strength and thermal stability, yet their plastic deformation mechanisms under complex contact loading remain insufficiently understood. Here, the nanoindentation response of an equiatomic MoTaW alloy is investigated through a combined experimental and atomistically resolved modeling approach. Spherical nanoindentation experiments are coupled with large scale molecular dynamics simulations employing a tabulated low dimensional Gaussian Approximation Potential (tabGAP), enabling near DFT accuracy. A physics based similarity criterion, implemented via PCA of load-displacement curves, is used to identify mechanically representative experimental responses for quantitative comparison with simulations. Indentation stress-strain curves are constructed yielding excellent agreement in the elastic regime between experiment and simulation, with reduced Young's moduli of approximately 270 GPa. Generalized stacking fault energy calculations reveal elevated unstable stacking- and twinning-fault energies in MoTaW relative to pure refractory elements, indicating suppressed localized shear and a preference for dislocation-mediated plasticity. Atomistic analyses demonstrate a strong crystallographic dependence of plastic deformation, with symmetric {110}<111> slip activation and four-fold rosette pile-ups for the [001] orientation, and anisotropic slip, strain localization, and enhanced junction formation for [011]. Local entropy and polyhedral template matching analyses further elucidate dislocation network evolution and deformation-induced local structural transformations. Overall, this study establishes a direct mechanistic link between fault energetics, orientation-dependent dislocation activity, and experimentally observed nanoindentation behavior in RCCA.

Title: Size Dependent Ternary Halide Solid Solutions in Perovskite Nanocrystals
Authors: Shai Levy, Lotte Kortstee, Georgy Dosovitskiy, Emma H. Massasa, Yaron Kauffmann, Juan Maria García-Lastra, Ivano E. Castelli, Yehonadav Bekenstein
Abstract: Crystalline solid solutions incorporate guest atoms by substituting host lattice sites up to a solubility limit dictated by solute host similarity. Solid solutions enable tuning various material properties, such as the optoelectronic behavior of halide perovskites. In bulk, incompatibility of Cl:I halide mixtures restricts exploration throughout the ternary halide Cl:Br:I compositional range. However, solubility is extended in nanocrystals which better accommodate a wider range of ions within their lattice. Through high throughput synthesis and spectroscopic characterization of over 3000 samples, along with density functional theory and cluster expansion models, we determine the solubility boundaries of ternary halide perovskite nanocrystals and demonstrate their extended size dependent miscibility. Smaller nanocrystals, with sufficient Br content, stabilize the Cl:Br:I solid solutions, suppress planar stacking fault defects and prevent halide segregation.

Title: Cryogenic interface-state filling and tunneling mechanisms in strained Ge/SiGe heterostructures

Abstract: Traps at the semiconductor-oxide interface are considered as a major source of instability in strained Ge/SiGe quantum devices, yet the quantified study of their cryogenic behavior remains limited. In this work, we investigate interface-state trapping using Hall-bar field-effect transistors fabricated on strained Ge/SiGe heterostructures. Combining transport measurements with long-term stabilization and Schrödinger-Poisson modelling, we reconstruct the gradual filling process of interface states at cryogenic condition. Using the calculated valence band profiles, we further evaluate the tunneling current density between the quantum well and the semiconductor-oxide interface. Our calculation demonstrates that the total tunneling current is consistent with a crossover from trap-assisted-tunneling-dominated transport to Fowler-Nordheim-tunneling-dominated transport under different gate bias regimes. These results refine the conventional Fowler-Nordheim-based picture of interface trapping in strained Ge/SiGe heterostructures and provide guidelines for improving Ge-based quantum device performance by improving barrier crystalline qualities and reducing dislocation-related trap densities.

Title: Unified Geometric Perspective for Spin-1 Systems: Bridging Nematic Director and Majorana Stars
Authors: Jiangnan Biguo, Rourou Ma
Abstract: We present a unified geometric approach for spin-1 systems that connects seemingly distinct geometric representations such as the nematic director, the Cartesian representation and the Majorana stellar representation. Starting from a product state of two distinguishable spin-1/2 particles, we provide a direct way to capture crucial geometric information. This perspective reveals the fundamental interplay between subspace projection and geometric constraints. This approach effectively maps magnetic solitons onto a kink model, allowing us to derive their equations of motion, a task not readily achieved with traditional methods. This simplified dynamical description reveals that the novel transition of these solitons in a harmonic trap corresponds to a fundamental transformation between kink and dip structures in the underlying geometry.

Title: Essentially No Energy Barrier Between Independent Fermionic Neural Quantum State Minima
Authors: David D. Dai, Marin Soljačić
Abstract: Neural quantum states (NQS) have proven highly effective in representing quantum many-body wavefunctions, but their loss landscape remains poorly understood and debated. Here, we demonstrate that the NQS loss landscape is more benign and similar to conventional deep learning than previously thought, exhibiting mode connectivity: independently trained NQS are connected by paths in parameter space with essentially no energy barrier. To construct these paths, we develop GeoNEB, a path optimizer integrating efficient stochastic reconfiguration with the nudged elastic band method for constructing minimum energy paths. For the strongly interacting six-electron quantum dot modeled by a $1.6$M-parameter Psiformer, we find two independent minima with expected energy barrier $\sim10^{-5}$ times smaller than the system's overall energy scale and $\sim10^{-3}$ times smaller than the linear path's barrier. The path respects physical symmetry in addition to achieving low energy, with the angular momentum remaining well quantized throughout. Our work is the first to construct optimized paths between independently trained NQS, and it suggests that the NQS loss landscape may not be as pathological as once feared.

Title: Dislocation distribution near a wall within the framework of the continuum theory of curved dislocations
Authors: István Groma, Dénes Berta, Lóránt Sándli, Péter Dusán Ispánovity
Abstract: A recently proposed generalised continuum theory of curved dislocations describes the spatial and temporal evolution of statistically stored and geometrically necessary dislocation densities as well as the curvature. The dynamics follow from a scalar plastic potential that constrains the allowed velocity fields and leads to a phase field like formulation with a nontrivial mobility function. Although conceptually related to strain gradient plasticity, the theory differs by introducing an intrinsic, evolving length scale given by the dislocation spacing. In this paper, we determine three key material independent parameters of this continuum theory by quantitatively comparing its predictions with discrete dislocation dynamics (DDD) simulations. To achieve this, we impose a narrow impenetrable wall inside the simulation volume, which blocks dislocation motion and generates characteristic spatial variations of the dislocation density fields under external loading. We show that for this geometry, the continuum equations reduce to a form that can be solved efficiently via direct numerical integration. The resulting stationary distributions of total and geometrically necessary dislocation densities are then compared to extensive 2D and 3D DDD simulations. This comparison allows us to extract the parameters that govern the back stress, the density gradient coupling, and the flow stress relation. Our results demonstrate that the continuum theory quantitatively captures the DDD observed structure of the dislocation pile up near the wall and therefore provides a reliable mesoscale description. The wall loading setup further serves as a benchmark problem to validate numerical implementations of the continuum theory in more general geometries.

Title: Tunable cornerlike states in topological type-II hyperbolic lattices
Authors: Zheng-Rong Liu, Tan Peng, Xiao-Xia Yi, Chun-Bo Hua, Rui Chen, Bin Zhou
Abstract: Type-II hyperbolic lattices constitute a new class of hyperbolic structures that are projected onto the Poincaré ring and possess both an inner and an outer boundary. In this work, we reveal the higher-order topological phases in type-II hyperbolic lattices, characterized by the generalized quadrupole moment. Unlike the type-I hyperbolic lattices where zero-energy cornerlike states exist on a single boundary, the higher-order topological phases in type-II hyperbolic lattices possess zero-energy cornerlike states localized on both the inner and outer boundaries. These findings are verified within both the modified Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model and the Benalcazar-Bernevig-Hughes model. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the higher-order topological phase remains robust against weak disorder in type-II hyperbolic lattices. Our work provides a route for realizing and controlling higher-order topological states in type-II hyperbolic lattices.

Title: A survey of active learning in materials science: Data-driven paradigm for accelerating the research pipeline
Authors: Jiaxin Chen, Tianjiao Wan, Hui Geng, Liang Xiong, Guohong Wang, Yihan Zhao, Longxiang Deng, Susu Fang, Zheng Luo, Huaimin Wang, Shanshan Wang, Kele Xu
Abstract: The exploration of materials composition, structure, and processing spaces is constrained by high dimensionality and the cost of data acquisition. While machine learning has supported property prediction and design, its effectiveness depends on labeled data, which remains expensive to generate via experiments or high-fidelity simulations. Improving data efficiency is thus a central concern in materials informatics. Active learning (AL) addresses this by coupling model training with adaptive data acquisition. Instead of static datasets, AL iteratively prioritizes candidates based on uncertainty, diversity, or task-specific objectives. By guiding data collection under limited budgets, AL offers a structured approach to decision-making, complementing physical insight with quantitative measures of informativeness. Recently, AL has been applied to computational simulation, structure optimization, and autonomous experimentation. However, the diversity of AL formulations has led to fragmented methodologies and inconsistent assessments. This Review provides a concise overview of AL methods in materials science, focusing on their role in improving data efficiency under realistic constraints. We summarize key methodological principles, representative applications, and persistent challenges, aiming to clarify the scope and limitations of AL as a practical tool within contemporary materials informatics.

Title: Fluctuation-Dissipation Limits in Quantum Thermoelectric Transport
Authors: Ousi Pan, Zhiqiang Fan, Shunjie Zhang, Jie Li, Jincan Chen, Shanhe Su
Abstract: As a fundamental measure of stability in nonequilibrium thermodynamics, fluctuations provide critical insight into the performance and reliability of heat engines. In this work, we establish universal fluctuation-dissipation bounds that directly link energy-current fluctuations to both the entropy production rate and steady-state transport currents. Our results are applicable to arbitrary temperature and chemical potential gradients and hold for all steady states within the framework of quantum scattering theory. These bounds remain robust even in regimes where quantum effects break classical thermodynamic uncertainty relations. We demonstrate their validity by using boxcar transmission functions and further derive constraints on the power output from the perspective of fluctuations and dissipation, offering a unified thermodynamic guideline for the design and evaluation of nanoscale and quantum thermal devices.

Authors: Madhav Sharma, Pooja Sindhu, Rajendra S. Dhaka
Abstract: We examine a new NASICON-type Na$_4$NiCr(PO$_4$)$_3$ material designed for high-voltage and multi-electron reactions for the sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The Rietveld refinement of the X-ray diffraction pattern, using the R$\bar{3}$c space group, confirmed the stabilization of the rhombohedral NASICON framework. Furthermore, the Raman and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy are employed to probe the structure and chemical bonding. The core-level photoemission analysis reveals the Cr$^{3+}$ and mixed Ni$^{2+}$/Ni$^{3+}$ oxidation states in the sample. Moreover, the bond valence energy landscape (BVEL) analysis, based on the refined structure, revealed a three-dimensional network of well-connected sodium sites with a migration energy barrier of 0.468 eV. The material delivered a good charge capacity at around 4.5 V, but showed no sodium-ion intercalation during discharge, resulting in negligible discharge capacity. The post-mortem analysis confirmed that the crystal structure remained intact. The calculated energy barrier values indicated a reversal in sodium site stability after cycling, though the barriers can still permit feasible ion migration. This suggests that ion transport alone cannot explain the lack of reversibility, which likely arises from intrinsically poor electronic conductivity. These findings highlight key challenges in achieving stable, reversible capacity in this system and underscore the need for doping, structural modification, and electrolyte optimization to realize its full potential as a high-voltage SIB cathode.

Title: Van der Waals superconducting electronics: materials, devices and circuit integration
Authors: Angelo Di Bernardo, Elke Scheer
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) superconductors - atomically thin crystalline materials that can be stacked into more complex heterostructures - have opened a promising avenue for superconducting electronics thanks to their properties that are otherwise difficult to obtain in other superconducting materials. These include strong resilience to high in-plane fields, electrostatic tuneability, and non-reciprocal transport rooted in inversion-symmetry breaking and strong spin-orbit coupling. In addition to highlighting the importance of these properties for superconducting electronics, this review gives an overview over the physical mechanisms that govern and influence superconductivity in vdW materials including Ising pairing, band inversion, and proximity effects at superconductor/ferromagnet interfaces that do not have an equivalent in thin-film systems. This overview then sets the basis to survey the wide range of functionalities enabled by superconducting vdW devices including gate-controlled devices, superconducting diodes, and circuit elements for readout and control of quantum bits. The review concludes with a forward look at wafer-scale growth and deterministic assembly of vdW devices, highlighting concrete pathways that can enable the transition from vdW device prototypes to deployable components for cryogenic electronics and quantum technologies.

Title: Largest connected component in duplication-divergence growing graphs with symmetric coupled divergence
Authors: Dario Borrelli
Abstract: The largest connected component in duplication-divergence growing graphs with symmetric coupled divergence is studied. Finite-size scaling reveals a phase transition occurring at a divergence rate $\delta_c$. The $\delta_c$ found stands near the locus of zero in Euler characteristic for finite-size graphs, known to be indicative of the largest connected component transition. The role of non-interacting vertices in shaping this transition, with their presence ($d=0$) and absence ($d=1$) in duplication is also discussed, suggesting a particular transformation of the time variable considered yielding a singularity locus in the natural logarithm of Euler characteristic of finite-size graphs close to that obtained with $d=1$ but from the model with $d=0$. The findings may suggest implications for bond percolation in these growing graph models.

Title: Ferromagnetic Insulator to Metal Transition in Non-Centrosymmetric Graphene Nanoribbons
Authors: Aidan P. Delgado, Michael C. Daugherty, Weichen Tang, Steven G. Louie, Felix R. Fischer
Abstract: Engineering sublattice imbalance within the unit cell of bottom-up synthesized graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) represents a versatile tool for realizing custom-tailored quantum nanomaterials. The interaction between low-energy zero-modes (ZMs) not only contributes to frontier bands but can form the basis for magnetically ordered phases. Here, we present the bottom-up synthesis of a non-centrosymmetric GNR that places all ZMs on the majority sublattice sites. Scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy reveal that strong electron-electron correlation drives the system into a ferromagnetically ordered insulating ground state featuring a sizeable band gap of Eg ~ 1.2 eV. At higher temperatures, a chemical transformation induces an insulator-to-metal transition that quenches the ferro-magnetic order. Tight-binding (TB) and first-principles density functional theory calculations corroborate our experimental observations. This work showcases how control over molecular symmetry, sublattice polarization, and ZM hybridization in bottom-up synthesized nanographenes can open a path to the exploration of many-body physics in rationally designed quantum materials.

Title: Dynamic redundancy and mortality in stochastic search
Authors: Samantha Linn, Aanjaneya Kumar
Abstract: Search processes are a fundamental part of natural and artificial systems. In such settings, the number of searchers is rarely constant: new agents may be recruited while others can abandon the search. Despite the ubiquity of these dynamics, their combined influence on search efficiency remains unexplored. Here we present a general framework for stochastic search in which independent agents progressively join and leave the process, a mechanism we term \emph{dynamic redundancy and mortality} (DRM). Under minimal assumptions on the underlying search dynamics, this framework yields exact first-passage time statistics. It further reveals surprising connections to stochastic resetting, including a regime in which the resetting mean first-passage time emerges as a universal lower bound for DRM, as well as regimes in which DRM search is faster. We illustrate our results through a detailed analysis of one-dimensional Brownian DRM search. Altogether, this work provides a rigorous foundation for studying first-passage processes with a fluctuating number of searchers, with direct relevance across physical, biological, and algorithmic systems.

Title: Percolation-Driven Magnetotransport due to Structural and Microstructural Evolution in Ultrathin Si/Fe Bilayers
Authors: S. S. Das, M. Senthil Kumar
Abstract: The anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in magnetic nanofilms is highly sensitive to the microstructural and magnetic homogeneity. However, the evolution of the microstructure and morphology near the percolation threshold, and its connection to the resulting magnetic and magnetotransport behavior in low-dimensional magnetic heterostructures, remain poorly understood. In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of the evolution of the structural, microstructural, and magnetotransport properties of Si/Fe bilayers by varying the Fe layer thickness. X-ray diffraction (XRD), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and magnetisation data reveal a percolation-driven transition from a continuous metallic film to percolative network structure of grains when tFe decreases below 30 Angstrom. Transport measurements involving longitudinal resistivity (rho), and the anomalous Hall resistivity (rho_A,h,s) show clear divergence near the percolation threshold. The purely electronic conduction channels (rho) evolve more gradually as compared to the combined electronic and magnetic ones rho_A,h,s. The percolative analysis of the structural, magnetic, and magnetotransport data yields a critical exponent in the range of 0.78 to 1.16, consistent with that of 2D-disordered systems. The AHE scaling relation between the rho_A,h,s and rho reveals a crossover of the AHE mechanism from a mixed intrinsic/side-jump contribution with a minor skew scattering component (n ~ 1.42) in the thick, low-resistive samples (tFe > 30 Angstrom) to a skew-scattering-dominant mechanism (n = 0.62) in the high-resistive films (tFe <= 30 Angstrom). This crossover coincides with the onset of structural and magnetic connectivity between the grains. Furthermore, these findings underscore the interlink between microstructure, morphology, magnetism, and Hall transport under a percolation framework.

Title: Hidden half-metallicity
Authors: San-Dong Guo, Pan Zhou
Abstract: Half-metals, featuring ideal 100\% spin polarization, are widely regarded as key materials for spintronic and quantum technologies; however, the half-metallic state is intrinsically fragile, as it relies on a delicate balance of exchange splitting and band filling and is therefore highly susceptible to disorder, external perturbations, and thermal effects. Here we introduce the concept of hidden half-metallicity, whereby the global electronic structure of a symmetry-enforced net-zero-magnetization magnet is non-half-metallic, while each of its two symmetry-related sectors is individually half-metallic, enabling robust 100\% spin polarization through a layer degree of freedom. Crucially, the vanishing net magnetization of the entire system suppresses stray fields and magnetic instabilities, rendering the half-metallic functionality inherently more robust than in conventional ferromagnetic half-metals. Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate this mechanism in a $PT$-symmetric bilayer $\mathrm{CrS_2}$, and further show that an external electric field drives the system into a seemingly forbidden fully compensated ferrimagnetic metal in which hidden half-metallicity persists. Finally, we briefly confirm the realization of hidden half-metallicity in altermagnets, establishing a general paradigm for stabilizing half-metallic behavior by embedding it in symmetry-protected hidden sectors and opening a new route toward the design and discovery of unprecedented half-metallic phases.

Title: Revealing altermagnetic Fermi surfaces with two Kondo impurities
Authors: Qiong Qin, Toshihiro Sato, Marcin Raczkowski, Jeroen van den Brink, Congjun Wu, Fakher F. Assaad
Abstract: Motivated by recent advances in the study of altermagnetism, or unconventional magnetism, and in the realization and manipulation of two-impurity Kondo physics in real materials, we propose a phase-sensitive method to explore unconventional magnetic symmetries. Our method can be implemented with spin-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy to study two-impurity Kondo phenomena on altermagnetic metals by varying the distance and orientation between magnetic impurities. Using quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we analyze the spin splitting of the Kondo resonance, whose spatial distribution sensitively captures the symmetry of the underlying altermagnetic order. Furthermore, the impurity spin correlations reflects the anisotropy of the RKKY interaction due to the altermagnetic Fermi surface splitting. This work provides a framework for studying the competition between the Kondo effect, the RKKY interaction and altermagnetism, in the simplest possible system.

Title: Improvement of a focused ion beam fabricated diamond pillar for scanning ensemble nitrogen-vacancy magnetometry probe using an ultrapure diamond
Authors: Dwi Prananto, Yifei Wang, Yuta Kainuma, Kunitaka Hayashi, Masahiko Tomitori, Toshu An
Abstract: Scanning diamond nitrogen-vacancy probe microscopy (SNVM) is an important tool for studying nanoscale condensed-matter phenomena. Ga$^+$-ion-focused-ion-beam (FIB) milling has been introduced as an available method for fabricating SNVM, while the probe diameter is limited to a few micrometers due to the Ga$^+$-induced damage. We report a method for improving the SNVM probes' quality, with an 800-nm diameter probe of ultrapure diamond, through polyvinyl alcohol and Pt/Pd capping, followed by UV/ozone exposure. The effectiveness of the method is confirmed by NVs' spin-coherence property measurements and magnetic domain structure imaging with a few-hundred-nanometer resolution and a 6.7 $\mu$T/Hz$^{1/2}$ sensitivity.

Title: Thermodynamic Driving Force Activated Phonon Scattering in InN
Authors: Zaheer Ahmad, Osama A. Rana, Shakeel Ahmad, Mark Vernon, Brendan Cross, Alexander Kozhanov
Abstract: Defect related disorder during InN growth is a major challenge for making high performance electronic and optoelectronic devices. This is partly because film quality is often described using reactor specific settings instead of general physical variables. In this study, we show that plasma assisted MOCVD growth of InN can be described using a single thermodynamic driving force coordinate. This coordinate brings together growth kinetics, defect sensitive Raman response and structural coherence across different process conditions. When we use this coordinate, the incorporation rate follows a universal activated trend with a kinetic scale of about 0.08 eV. Raman measurements show a clear crossover between a defect sparse and a defect rich regime, a disorder activated Raman metric increases quickly after the crossover, while an A1-LO control metric stays mostly the same. This suggests that short range lattice disorder, not long range polar coupling, dominates the defect activation process. X-ray diffraction shows that the out of plane coherence length stays the same for samples with the same driving force, even if reactor settings are very different. This supports the idea that structural coherence is organized by thermodynamics in this growth window. Finally, a simple kinetic Monte Carlo model using driving force biased incorporation and defect activation events matches the observed exponential trends and the two regimes, supporting the driving force approach. These results show that a transferable driving force coordinate can be used for plasma assisted InN growth and offer a quantitative way to achieve defect sparse growth conditions.

Title: Emergent Cooperative Superstructures via Order-Disorder Kinetics in Molecule-Intercalated NbSe2
Authors: Taiga Ueda, Hideki Matsuoka, Shungo Aoyagi, Shunsuke Kitou, Yijin Zhang, Fumihiko Kimura, Kenta Hagiwara, Masato Sakano, Takahiro Iwagaki, Yuiga Nakamura, Kyoko Ishizaka, Tomoki Machida, Masayuki Suda, Taka-hisa Arima, Naoya Kanazawa
Abstract: The design of quantum states at heterointerfaces has enabled a variety of emergent phenomena. Among them, molecular intercalation superlattices have attracted attention as tunable hybrid materials, formed by inserting organic molecules into van der Waals crystals, where molecular structure and chemistry provide new degrees of freedom. Traditionally, the intercalated molecules have been regarded as inactive spacers, while possible molecular ordering and its impact on the host lattice have remained largely unexplored. Here, we report the discovery of a cooperative superstructure (CSS) phase in molecule intercalated NbSe2, where ordering of the guest molecules induce a concomitant superstructure in the NbSe2 host lattice, characterized by a moiré structure due to incommensurability between the molecular layer and the inorganic lattice. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction reveals the emergence of CSS phase, accompanied by crystal symmetry lowering. Complementary resistivity and thermal-quench measurements show that the transition is governed by unusually slow order-disorder kinetics, so that the CSS phase can be selectively accessed under standard laboratory cooling rates. This kinetic behavior arises from slow molecular dynamics coupled to the host lattice, contrasting with fast charge or magnetic ordering in inorganic solids. Our findings establish molecular ordering as a route for engineering heterointerfaces, enabling thermally programmable superstructures.

Title: Derivation and Analysis of Amplitude Equation for Generalized AMB+ in Presence of Chemical Reaction
Authors: Sayantan Mondal, Prasenjit Das
Abstract: We derive and analyze the amplitude equation for the roll patterns in case of generalized Active Model B+ (AMB+) in the presence of chemical reactions. The generalized AMB+ differs from the original AMB+ introduced by Tjhung \textit{et al.} [E. Tjhung \textit{et al.}, Phys. Rev. X \textbf{8}, 031080 (2018)] by the addition of a quadratic term, $g\phi^2$, in the expression for the equilibrium part of the current. Also, the model includes a rotation-free active current of strength $\lambda$ and a rotational current of strength $\xi$. The inclusion of a chemical reaction with rate $\Gamma$ removes the conservation constraint and introduces a preferred wavenumber that governs the pattern formation below a critical reaction rate $\Gamma_c$. We argue for the analytical form of the amplitude equation based on symmetry considerations and explicitly derived it using multiscale analysis. By taking different limits of $g$, $\lambda$, and $\xi$, we recover amplitude equations for several well-known physical models as special cases and determine the nature transitions close to the onset of instability. We find that for $g = 0$, the transition is always supercritical, whereas for $g \ne 0$, the transition between the supercritical and subcritical regimes depends sensitively on the model parameters. Further, we derive the condition for the \textit{Eckhaus instability} from the stability analysis of the amplitude equation as well as from the phase diffusion equation, and find that it is independent of $g$.

Title: Spectral Topology and Delocalization in Disordered Hatano-Nelson Chains
Authors: Supriyo Ghosh, Sergej Flach
Abstract: The unidirectional Hatano-Nelson chain serves as the fundamental non-Hermitian building block of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. We investigate its Anderson localization properties under diagonal binary disorder. For weak disorder, the complex eigenvalue spectrum forms a single closed loop, which bifurcates into two distinct loops at a critical disorder threshold. Correspondingly, the spectral winding number {\nu} undergoes a transition from {\nu} = 1 in the weak-disorder regime, through {\nu} = 1/2 at the critical point, to {\nu} = 0 in the strong-disorder limit. We show that the eigenstates are exponentially localized, with a localization length that varies analytically as a function of the loop parameter. Notably, at weak and critical disorder, the spectrum hosts two completely delocalized states with diverging localization lengths. This divergence is directly correlated with the non-trivial spectral winding number. These findings remain robust under various boundary conditions, with the exception of strictly open boundaries.

Title: Interplay of Charge and Magnetic Orders in SmNiC$_2$ Mediated by Electron-Phonon Interaction
Authors: A. von Ungern-Sternberg Schwark, A.-A. Haghighirad, R. Heid, P. H. McGuinness, N. Maraytta, A. Eich, M. Merz, A. Bosak, D. A. Chaney, A. Chumakova, A. Pawbake, C. Faugeras, M. Le Tacon, S. M. Souliou
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between charge density wave (CDW) instabilities and ferromagnetism in SmNiC$_2$ using diffuse and inelastic x-ray scattering together with Raman spectroscopy. We identify a soft acoustic phonon driving the incommensurate CDW (I-CDW) and uncover a second Kohn anomaly at the wave vector of the commensurate CDW (C-CDW) stabilized in other $R$NiC$_2$ members ($R=$ rare earth). The marked softening of both phonons and their contrasting evolution with temperature reveal a competition between the two ordering tendencies. Alongside pronounced anomalies in the temperature dependence of the zone center and soft phonons, we observe the collective amplitude mode of the CDW, which collapses abruptly as ferromagnetism sets in. Surprisingly, the Kohn anomalies persist in the ferromagnetic state despite the degradation of Fermi-surface nesting conditions. Our experimental findings, supported by ab initio calculations, highlight the central role of the electron-phonon interaction in driving the CDW formation and tuning the balance between competing charge and magnetic orders.

Title: Effect of the parameters of bimodal microstructure on the mechanical properties of alumina: A case of sintering regime effects

Abstract: The effect of sintering regimes on the density, microstructure parameters, and mechanical properties of Al2O3 and Al2O3 + 0.25%MgO ceramics has been investigated. The ceramics were sintered in three regimes: Regime I - heating at a constant rate (2.5, 5, 10, 20 C/min) up to the temperature T=1650C; Regime II - heating with a varied heating rate up to 1565C with the duration corresponding to sintering at the heating rate of 10 C/min in Regime I followed by a three-fold decrease in the shrinkage rate; Regime III - two-stage sintering: heating according to Regime II up to the temperature T1+1550C, then lowering the temperature down to T2 = 1300-1500C and holding for 3 h at the T2. The sintering regimes were chosen so that the ceramics had the relative density of 97-99% and a bimodal distribution of the microstructure parameters. The Al2O3 and Al2O3 + 0.25%MgO ceramics obtained in Regimes I-III had a microstructure with abnormally large grains in a fine-grained matrix. The sizes and volume fractions of the large grains depended on the sintering regime. Most abnormally large grains had elongated shapes that leads to deviations in the crack propagation trajectories from the straight line. The optimal parameters of the bimodal microstructure parameters distribution providing enhanced mechanical properties of the ceramics (hardness, indentation fracture toughness, ultimate strength) have been determined.

Title: Analysis of contributions of plastic deformation and intergranular corrosion to corrosion-fatigue failure of Al-Mg alloys
Authors: Oleg Belkin, Vladimir Chuvil'deev, Mikhail Chegurov, Aleksey Nokhrin, Anatoly Sysoev
Abstract: The article presents the results of corrosion-fatigue tests of industrial Al-Mg alloys were conducted in air and in a 3% NaCl aqueous solution. Fatigue curves can be characterized using the Basquin equation and the plastic deformation model at the crack tip. It has been demonstrated that the primary contributions to corrosion-fatigue failure in the Al-Mg alloys at low stresses are made by the process of pitting and intergranular corrosion, and by the plastic deformation at high stresses.

Title: Field-induced magnetic phase transitions and transport anomalies in GdAlSi
Authors: Zheng Li, Sheng Xu, Yi-Yan Wang, Tian-Hao Li, Shu-Xiang Li, Jin-Jin Wang, Jun-Jian Mi, Qian Tao, Zhu-An Xu
Abstract: Magnetic topological materials hosting non-zero Berry curvature have emerged as a focus of intensive research due to their exceptional magnetoelectric coupling phenomena and potential applications in next-generation spintronic devices. In this work, we successfully synthesized high-quality GdAlSi single crystals, a prototypical member of RAlX (R = rare earth elements; X = Si/Ge) family that has been theoretically predicted to sustain a non-trivial Weyl semimetal state. Through systematic investigations of magnetic and transport properties, we identified two successive antiferromagnetic transitions at critical temperatures TN1 31.9 K and TN2 31.1 K, as evidenced by temperature-dependent resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and specific heat measurements. Notably, applied magnetic fields exceeding 8 T induce a third magnetic transition (TN3), generating a cascade of metamagnetic transitions that collectively form a dendritic phase diagram. This complex magnetic behavior is attributed to the interplay between localized Gd-4f moments and itinerant conduction electrons, possibly mediated by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. Transport measurements revealed striking stepwise anomalies in magnetoresistance when crossing phase boundaries, accompanied by pronounced hysteresis loops arising from magnetic moment flopping processes. Our results not only establish GdAlSi as a rich platform for investigating correlated topological states, but also demonstrate its potential for engineering topological phase transitions through magnetic symmetry manipulation in Weyl semimetals.

Title: Self-oscillations induced by self-induced torque in magnetic double tunnel junction
Authors: R. Arun, R. Gopal, V. K. Chandrasekar, M. Lakshmanan
Abstract: Self-oscillations of the magnetization due to self-induced torque (SIT) in a magnetic double tunnel junction that consists of perpendicularly polarized, pinned and free layers is investigated along with the field-like torque (FLT). The associated Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski equation is numerically analysed to exhibit the oscillations of magnetization driven by the current. From the numerical analysis, we show that the SIT is essential to generate os- cillations in the order of GHz and without it the magnetization reaches steady state after exhibiting switching. Without FLT, the frequency of the oscilla- tions decreases with the current while the power of oscillations increases. In the presence of the negative strength of the FLT the power spectral density confirms that the frequency, power and the Q-factor increase with the current. Also the tunability range and the rate at which the frequency enhances increase with the magnitude of the FLT.

Title: Curvature-driven shifts of the Potts transition on spherical Fibonacci graphs: a graph-convolutional transfer-learning study
Authors: Zheng Zhou, Xu-Yang Hou, Hao Guo
Abstract: We investigate the ferromagnetic $q$-state Potts model on spherical Fibonacci graphs. These graphs are constructed by embedding quasi-uniform sites on a sphere and defining interactions via a chord-distance cutoff chosen to yield a network approximating four-neighbor connectivity. By combining Swendsen-Wang cluster Monte Carlo simulations with graph convolutional networks (GCNs), which operate directly on the adjacency structure and node spins, we develop a unified phase-classification framework applicable to both regular planar lattices and curved, irregular spherical graphs. Benchmarks on planar lattices demonstrate an efficient transfer strategy: after a fixed binarization of Potts spins into an effective Ising variable, a single GCN pretrained on the Ising model can localize the transition region for different $q$ values without retraining. Applying this strategy to spherical graphs, we find that curvature- and defect-induced connectivity irregularities produce only modest shifts in the inferred transition temperatures relative to planar baselines. Further analysis shows that the curvature-induced shift of the critical temperature is most pronounced at small $q$ and diminishes rapidly as $q$ increases; this trend is consistent with the physical picture that, in two dimensions, the Potts model undergoes a transition from a continuous phase transition to a weakly first-order one for $q>4$, accompanied by a pronounced reduction of the correlation length.

Title: Optimizing the Design of a Simple Three-Sphere Magnetic Microswimmer
Authors: Theo Lequy, Andreas M. Menzel
Abstract: When swimming at low Reynolds numbers, inertial effects are negligible and reciprocal movements cannot induce net motion. Instead, symmetry breaking is necessary to achieve net propulsion. Directed swimming can be supported by magnetic fields, which simultaneously provide a versatile means of remote actuation. Thus, we analyze the motion of a straight microswimmer composed of three magnetizable beads connected by two elastic links. The swimming mechanism is based on oriented external magnetic fields that oscillate in magnitude. Through induced reversible hysteretic collapse of the two segments of the swimmer, the two pairs of beads jump into contact and separate nonreciprocally. Due to higher-order hydrodynamic interactions, net displacement results after each cycle. Different microswimmers can be tuned to different driving amplitudes and frequencies, allowing for simultaneous independent control by just one external magnetic field. The swimmer geometry and magnetic field shape are optimized for maximum swimming speed using an evolutionary optimization strategy. Thanks to the simple working principle, an experimental realization of such a microrobot seems feasible and may open new approaches for microinvasive medical interventions such as targeted drug delivery.

Title: Role of Disorder in Governing the Magnetic Properties of Cu2IrO3
Authors: Priyanka Yadav, Sumit Sarkar, Vishal Kumar, Sanjay Singh, Martin A Karlsen, Martin Etter, Sourav Chowdhury, Subhajit Nandy, Yogesh Singh
Abstract: Cu$_2$IrO$_3$ is a honeycomb iridate which has been studied recently as a candidate Kitaev quantum spin liquid. Its magnetic ground state however, has been reported to be quantum disordered, spin glassy, or magnetically ordered depending on synthesis details. We have prepared a Cu$_2$IrO$_3$ sample with large antisite disorder and studied in detail its structure (global and local), charge states, and thermodynamic properties to try to quantify and characterize the disorder and its connection to the magnetic ground state. X-ray diffraction, Extended x-ray absorption fine structure(EXAFS) and X-ray pair distribution function analysis revealed a large site disorder ($\sim$25\%), while XPS and XANES reveal mixed valence of Cu and Ir following Cu$^{1+}$ + Ir$^{4+}$ $\rightarrow$ Cu$^{2+}$ + Ir$^{3+}$. This combination of site disorder and charge redistribution generates competing antiferromagnetic interactions and magnetic frustration, resulting in dynamically fluctuating AFM clusters near 80K that freeze below 29K. These results demonstrate the crucial role of synthesis dependent disorder in determining the magnetic ground state of Cu$_2$IrO$_3$.

Title: Decoupled interband pairing in a bilayer iron-based superconductor evidenced by ultrahigh-resolution ARPES
Authors: Shichong Wang, Yuanyuan Yang, Yang Li, Wenshan Hong, Huaxun Li, Shaofeng Duan, Lingxiao Gu, Haoran Liu, Jiongyu Huang, Jianzhe Liu, Dong Qian, Guanghan Cao, Huiqian Luo, Wentao Zhang
Abstract: We present direct experimental evidence of a weakly coupled multiband superconducting state in the bilayer iron-based superconductor ACa$_2$Fe$_4$As$_4$F$_2$ (A = K, Cs) via ultrahigh-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Remarkably, the K-containing compound exhibits two distinct transition temperatures, corresponding to two separate sets of bilayer-split bands, as evidenced by temperature-dependent superconducting gap and spectral weight near the Fermi energy, while its Cs counterpart displays conventional single transition behavior. These experimental observations are well described by the weakly coupled two-band model of Eilenberger theory, which identifies suppressed interband pairing interactions between the bilayer-split bands as the key mechanism. By exploring quantum phenomena in the weak-coupling limit within a multiband system, our findings pave the way for engineering exotic superconductivity via band-selective pairing control.

Title: Janus Polymeric Giant Vesicles on Demand: A Predictive Phase Separation Approach for Efficient Formation
Authors: Eloise Equy, Emmanuel Ibarboure, Eric Grelet, Sebastien Lecommandoux
Abstract: Janus particles, with their intrinsic asymmetry, are attracting major interest in various applications, including emulsion stabilization, micro/nanomotors, imaging, and drug delivery. In this context, Janus polymersomes are particularly attractive for synthetic cell development and drug delivery systems. While they can be achieved by inducing a phase separation within their membrane, their fabrication method remains largely empirical. Here, we propose a rational approach, using Flory-Huggins theory, to predict the self-assembly of amphiphilic block copolymers into asymmetric Janus polymersomes. Our predictions are experimentally validated by forming highly stable Janus giant unilamellar vesicles (JGUVs) with a remarkable yield exceeding 90% obtained from electroformation of various biocompatible block copolymers. We also present a general phase diagram correlating mixing energy with polymersome morphology, offering a valuable tool for JGUV design. These polymersomes can be extruded to achieve quasi-monodisperse vesicles while maintaining their Janus-like morphology, paving the way for their asymmetric functionalization and use as active carriers.

Title: Sliding Charge Density Wave observed through Band Structure
Authors: S. Mandal, D. Ghoneim, A.A. Sinchenko, V.L.R. Jacques, K. Wang, L. Ortega, J. Avila, P. Dudin, A. Tejeda, D. Le Bolloch
Abstract: An incommensurate CDW may have the ability to slide, i.e., to generate an excess of current when the system is submitted to an external field. Sliding phenomenon is closely related to deformation of the periodic lattice distortion associated to the CDW. In principle, however, the sliding state can also be observed through the band structure. Here we show that broken symmetry in k-space is observed by Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES) in the sliding regime of TbTe$_3$, which could be consistent with theoretical predictions.

Title: Collinear $p$-wave magnetism and hidden orbital ferrimagnetism
Authors: Valentin Leeb, Johannes Knolle
Abstract: In the absence of spin-orbit coupling, collinear magnets are classified as even-wave magnets, i.e., either ferro-, antiferro-, or altermagnets. It is based on the belief that collinear magnets always feature an inversion-symmetric band structure, which forbids odd-wave magnetism. Here, we show that collinear magnets, which break time reversal symmetry in the non-magnetic sector, can have an inversion symmetry broken band structure and lead to unconventional types of collinear magnets. Hence, collinear odd-wave magnets do exist, and we explain that a magnetic field-induced Edelstein effect is their unique signature. We propose minimal models based on the coexistence of AFM order with compensated loop current orders for all types of collinear magnets. Our work provides a new perspective on collinear magnets and the spin-space group classification.

Title: Tuning cholesteric cellulose nanocrystal self-assembly in spherical confinement via salt and sonication
Authors: Diogo Vieira Saraiva, Anne Meike Hogeweg, Lisa Tran
Abstract: Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) self-assemble into cholesteric liquid crystals that produce structural color upon solvent removal. Although most studies examine this process in planar films, confinement within micron-sized water-in-oil droplets provides a powerful platform for resolving self-assembly dynamics in real time. Here, we investigate how two common pitch-tuning strategies, sodium chloride addition and tip sonication, govern the kinetics and structure of CNC self-assembly under spherical confinement. Polarized optical microscopy timelapses capture the evolution from isotropic suspension through tactoid nucleation and annealing to kinetic arrest and final buckling. Consistent with prior work, pitch-concentration analysis reveals a universal post-arrest regime governed by droplet shrinkage. Beyond this established behavior, we identify a pre-arrest regime in which pitch decreases rapidly and whose kinetics accelerate with increasing salt concentration and sonication dose. These parameters shift the onset of cholesteric order and gelation, thereby tuning the concentration window for tactoid coalescence. Together, these results establish droplet confinement as a quantitative platform for probing out-of-equilibrium CNC self-assembly and for kinetically programming structurally colored soft materials.

Title: Hexagonal Warping Control of Exceptional Points in Topological Insulator--Ferromagnetic Heterojunctions
Authors: Md Afsar Reja, Awadhesh Narayan
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) are non-Hermitian degeneracies, where both eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce, which are fundamentally distinct from their Hermitian counterparts. In this study, we investigate the influence of hexagonal warping on EPs emerging at the interfaces between topological insulators and ferromagnets. We demonstrate that the presence of the warping term plays a crucial role in determining the locations of the EPs. Furthermore, we show that the number as well as the positions of EPs emerging at such junctions can be tuned by an applied magnetic field. Our results establish a realistic and experimentally accessible platform for exploring non-Hermitian physics in topological insulator-ferromagnet junctions.

Abstract: The spontaneous breaking of time-reversal symmetry is a hallmark of unconventional superconductivity, typically observed in type-II superconductors. Here, we report evidence of time-reversal symmetry breaking in the type-I superconductor YbSb$_2$. Zero-field $\mu$SR measurements reveal spontaneous internal magnetic fields emerging just below the superconducting transition, while transverse-field $\mu$SR confirms a fully gapped type-I superconducting state. Our first-principles calculations identify YbSb$_2$ as a ${\mathbb Z}_2$ topological metal hosting a Dirac nodal line near the Fermi level. Symmetry analysis within the Ginzburg Landau framework indicates an internally antisymmetric nonunitary triplet (INT) state as the most probable superconducting ground state. Calculations based on an effective low-energy model further demonstrate that this INT state hosts gapless Majorana surface modes, establishing YbSb$_2$ as a topological superconductor. Our results highlight YbSb$_2$ as a unique material platform where type-I superconductivity coexists with triplet-pairing and nontrivial topology.

Title: Rheofluidics: frequency-dependent rheology of single drops
Authors: Matteo Milani, Wenyun Wang, Lorenzo Russotto, Weiyu Zong, Kevin Jahnke, David A. Weitz, Stefano Aime
Abstract: We present Rheofluidics, a microfluidic technique that measures the frequency-dependent rheology of individual micron-scale objects. We apply oscillatory hydrodynamic stresses by flowing them through channels with modulated constrictions, and measure their deformation. Unlike bulk rheology, which measures collective properties, Rheofluidics provides heretofore unattainable measurements of individual particles. We apply Rheofluidics to discover frequency-dependent surface tension of surfactants, very high-frequency viscoelasticity of microgels and unexpected frequency-dependent bending modulus of vesicles.

Title: High isothermal magnetocaloric effect in La(Fe,Si)13 based alloys
Authors: A.P. Kamantsev, Yu.S. Koshkid`ko, O.E. Kovalev, N.Yu. Nyrkov, A.V. Golovchan, A.A. Amirov, A.M. Aliev
Abstract: This work investigates the magnetocaloric effect (MCE) in LaFe_{11.6}Si_{1.4} and LaFe_{11.78}Mn_{0.41}Si_{1.32}H_{1.6} alloys under adiabatic {\Delta}T and isothermal {\Delta}Q conditions in a magnetic field of {\mu}_{0}H = 1.8 T. The studied samples exhibited high reproducibility of the {\Delta}Q-effect upon cyclic magnetic field application, which is of critical importance for magnetic cooling this http URL LaFe_{11.78}Mn_{0.41}Si_{1.32}H_{1.6} alloy demonstrate high values of the isothermal MCE, with a maximum {\Delta}Q = 3400 J/kg in a magnetic field of {\mu}0H = 1.8 T near the Curie temperature (TC) of 275 K. This value is 2.5 times higher than the well-known corresponding values for pure Gd at room temperature. Furthermore, the structural and magnetic properties of LaFe13-xSix-based alloys with Cr and Co additions were investigated using density functional theory calcula-tions. It was shown that the addition of Cr leads to a decrease in the equilibrium volume, i.e., to a com-pression of the crystal lattice, whereas Co addition causes its expansion. These changes are expected to increase or decrease the T_{C}, respectively.

Title: Magnetic field decouples nodeless surface and nodal bulk orders
Authors: Atanu Mishra, Ghulam Mohmad, Kiran Bansal, Mohd Monish, Pankaj Kumar, Chandrasekhar Yadav, Goutam Sheet
Abstract: Selective spectroscopic disentanglement of surface and bulk quantum orders remains an outstanding challenge in condensed matter physics. The candidate topological superconductor PdTe has recently been proposed to host a nodeless surface gap on top of a nodal bulk state, but their direct identification and mutual coupling remained experimentally elusive. Here, we employ magnetic-field-dependent Andreev reflection spectroscopy to spectroscopically disentangle these components. At zero magnetic field, the spectra exhibit a BCS-like gap structure, consistent with dominant transport through a fully gapped surface superconducting state. Strikingly, even a weak magnetic field leads to an abrupt suppression of the Andreev-enhanced conductance (AEC), while a residual AEC, attributable to the nodal bulk state, persists to much higher magnetic fields. The transition is accompanied by pronounced magnetic hysteresis pointing to the existence of vortex dynamics at low fields. Our findings suggest that the nodal bulk gap facilitates early vortex entry, which in turn disrupts the fragile surface superconductivity. These results establish a field-tunable decoupling of surface and bulk superconductivity and illustrate how distinct gap topologies can shape the global superconducting order in multichannel systems.

Title: Reconfigurable Oxide Nanoelectronics by Tip-induced Electron Delocalization

Abstract: Reconfigurable oxide nanoelectronics, enabled by conductive atomic force microscope (cAFM) lithography, have established complex oxide interfaces as a promising platform for quantum engineering that harnesses emergent phenomena for advanced functionalities. However, this cAFM nanofabrication process can only occur in the air, with simultaneous device decay described under the "water-cycle" writing mechanism. These restrictions pose ongoing challenges for device optimization in the quantum regime at mK temperatures. Here, we demonstrate a "waterless" cAFM lithography approach that is compatible with vacuum and cryogenic environments. Through oxygen vacancy engineering at the LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface, we have achieved nonvolatile and reconfigurable cAFM control of nanoscale interfacial polaron-electron liquid transition at mK temperatures with an ultrafine line resolution of 0.85 nm. Supported by first-principles calculations and drift-diffusion modeling, we show that tip-controlled oxygen vacancy electromigration plays a key role. This advancement bridges reconfigurable device fabrication and concurrent characterization in situ at mK temperatures, and establishes a versatile Hubbard toolbox for engineering programmable quantum phases in correlated oxides.

Title: Modulators Selectively Reshape alpha-Synuclein Phase Transitions
Authors: Holly Masson, Massimiliano Paesani, Ioana M. Ilie
Abstract: Protein phase transitions govern numerous diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. In Parkinson's disease, distinct species of the protein alpha-synuclein undergo phase transitions from highly disordered to ordered beta-rich states. The emerging species and transitions between them can be reshaped by chaperones, small molecules, peptides or antibodies. Here, we use coarse-grained simulations to understand the effect of modulators on the thermodynamics and kinetics of alpha-synuclein transformations and phase transitions. Each protein is represented as a single morphing particle that transforms from a soft sphere (disordered state) to a hard spherocylinder (beta-rich state), while modulators are modeled as soft isotropic particles mimicking small peptides. The results show that purely repulsive modulators do not alter the final outcome, i.e. fibrils form following the same mechanisms independently of the modulator concentration. Attractive interactions towards the disordered protein slow down fibril formation in a dose-dependent manner by stabilizing intermediate species, and strong attraction yields persistent disordered heteroclusters. In contrast, specific attraction to the beta-rich state results in shorter fibrils through direct modulator surface "capping" that introduce kinetic barriers to monomer templating at the fibril ends and inhibit lateral attachment. Together, these results link modulator properties and environmental conditions to the effects on nucleation, fibril elongation and off-pathway trapping, providing a quantitative roadmap for selecting modulator properties and strategies that redirect phase transitions toward desirable endpoints. Additionally, they provide guiding principles for the development of intervention strategies and the engineering of novel materials with tunable and responsive properties.

Title: Structure-Property Relationship in Zinc Sulphide Nanoparticles Synthesized by Hydrothermal and Co-precipitation Methods
Authors: Rao Uzair Ahmad, Nasir Javed
Abstract: Zinc sulphide (ZnS) is a non-toxic, wide-bandgap II-VI semiconductor well known for its optoelectronic properties and environmental friendliness. Conventional syntheses of ZnS quantum dots (QDs) often involve high temperatures or toxic reagents. This study presents a comparative investigation of hydrothermal and co-precipitation synthesis routes for ZnS QDs, emphasizing scalable, environmentally friendly production under mild conditions. Using polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) or polyethylene glycol (PEG) as capping agents, we achieved precise control over particle size, optical properties, and particle size distribution. Room temperature co-precipitation produced monodisperse ZnS QDs with crystallite size as small as 2.03 nm, while hydrothermal synthesis at elevated temperature yielded larger crystals exceeding ~6 nm. X-ray diffraction confirmed zinc-blende crystal structure in all samples, with lattice parameter shifts and peak broadening reflecting nanoscale effects. UV-Visible spectroscopy revealed tuneable optical band gaps from 3.60 eV to 3.80 eV, corresponding to strong quantum confinement in smaller particles. FTIR and DLS analyses verified effective surface capping and particle size distribution, with PVP providing greater growth suppression and stability than PEG. These results demonstrate that ambient, polymer-assisted co precipitation enables low-toxicity, energy-efficient synthesis of high-quality ZnS QDs, offering a viable route toward sustainable and scalable nanoparticle production for optoelectronic and nanomaterial applications

Title: Magnons in multiorbital Hubbard models, from Lieb to kagome
Authors: Teng-Fei Ying, Hugo U. R. Strand, Benjamin T. Zhou, Erik G. C. P. van Loon
Abstract: We investigate the magnetic orders and excitations in a half-filled Hubbard model that continuously interpolates between the Lieb and kagome lattices. Using self-consistent Hartree-Fock approximation combined with real-time two-particle response functions from the Bethe-Salpeter equation in the random phase approximation, we map the $U-t'$ phase diagram of the Lieb-kagome lattices, identifying the typical magnetic states and the corresponding magnetic excitation spectra. In addition to gapless Goldstone magnons, the ferrimagnetic and antiferromagnetic symmetry-broken phases also exhibit gapped Higgs magnon bands, which originate from amplitude fluctuations in the order parameter characterizing spontaneous symmetry breaking.

Title: Excitation spectrum of a bright solitary wave in a Bose-Einstein condensate and its connection with the Higgs and the Goldstone modes
Authors: G. M. Kavoulakis
Abstract: We consider the problem of Bose-Einstein condensed atoms, which are confined in a (quasi) one-dimensional toroidal potential. We focus on the case of an effective attractive interaction between the atoms. The formation of a localized blob (i.e., a ``bright" solitary wave) for sufficiently strong interactions provides an example of spontaneous symmetry breaking. We evaluate analytically and numerically the excitation spectrum for both cases of a homogeneous and of a localized density distribution. We identify in the excitation spectrum the emergence of the analogous to the Goldstone and the Higgs modes, evaluating various relevant observables, gaining insight into these two fundamental modes of excitation.

Title: Anisotropic anomalous Hall effect in distorted kagome GdTi3Bi4
Authors: Avdhesh K. Sharma, Bo Tai, Subhajit Roychowdhury, Premakumar Yanda, Ulrich Burkhardt, Xiaolong Feng, Claudia Felser, Chandra Shekhar
Abstract: Topological kagome magnets offer a rich landscape for exploring the intricate interplay of quantum interactions among geometry, topology, spin, and correlation. GdTi3Bi4 crystallizes in layered Ti based kagome nets intertwined with zigzag Gd chains along the a axis and orders antiferromagnetically below 15 K. Here, we present the temperature and field dependent electrical transport of GdTi3Bi4 in different directions. The material exhibits anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) of 410 S cm-1 at 2 K for B parallel c and it is completely absent for B parallel a, despite the similar magnetization observed in both orientations. This behavior is quite contradictory, as anomalous Hall effect (AHE) typically scales with the magnetization. Through first principles calculations, it is demonstrated that in the presence of time reversal symmetry broken by the Gd 4f sublattice and spin orbit coupling, the magnetization direction controls the orbital mixing in the Ti t2g bands, relocating Berry curvature hot spots and producing the observed orientation selective AHC. The results establish GdTi3Bi4 as platform for investigating new avenues of AHE, such as directional AHE, and thus shed new light on the intricate coupling between magnetic and electronic structures, paving the way for exploring novel quantum phenomena.

Title: Machine learning nonequilibrium phase transitions in charge-density wave insulators
Authors: Yunhao Fan, Sheng Zhang, Gia-Wei Chern
Abstract: Nonequilibrium electronic forces play a central role in voltage-driven phase transitions but are notoriously expensive to evaluate in dynamical simulations. Here we develop a machine learning framework for adiabatic lattice dynamics coupled to nonequilibrium electrons, and demonstrate it for a gating induced insulator to metal transition out of a charge density wave state in the Holstein model. Although exact electronic forces can be obtained from nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) calculations, their high computational cost renders long time dynamical simulations prohibitively expensive. By exploiting the locality of the electronic response, we train a neural network to directly predict instantaneous local electronic forces from the lattice configuration, thereby bypassing repeated NEGF calculations during time evolution. When combined with Brownian dynamics, the resulting machine learning force field quantitatively reproduces domain wall motion and nonequilibrium phase transition dynamics obtained from full NEGF simulations, while achieving orders of magnitude gains in computational efficiency. Our results establish direct force learning as an efficient and accurate approach for simulating nonequilibrium lattice dynamics in driven quantum materials.

Title: Aggregating swarms through morphology handling design contingencies: from the sweet spot to a rich expressivity
Authors: Jeremy Fersula, Nicolas Bredeche, Olivier Dauchot
Abstract: Morphological computing, the use of the physical design of a robot to ease the realization of a given task has been proven to be a relevant concept in the context of swarm robotics. Here we demonstrate both experimentally and numerically, that the success of such a strategy may heavily rely on the type of policy adopted by the robots, as well as on the details of the physical design. To do so, we consider a swarm of robots, composed of Kilobots embedded in an exoskeleton, the design of which controls the propensity of the robots to align or anti-align with the direction of the external force they experience. We find experimentally that the contrast that was observed between the two morphologies in the success rate of a simple phototactic task, where the robots were programmed to stop when entering a light region, becomes dramatic, if the robots are not allowed to stop, and can only slow down. Building on a faithful physical model of the self-aligning dynamics of the robots, we perform numerical simulations and demonstrate on one hand that a precise tuning of the self-aligning strength around a sweet spot is required to achieve an efficient phototactic behavior, on the other hand that exploring a range of self-alignment strength allows for a rich expressivity of collective behaviors.

Title: Observation of exceptional topology and nonlocal skin effect in Klein bottle electric circuits
Authors: Pengtao Lai, Xiangru Chen, Yugan Tang, Yejian Hu, Zhenhang Pu, Hui Liu, Weiyin Deng, Hua Cheng, Zhengyou Liu, Shuqi Chen
Abstract: Symmetry and its representation play a crucial role in topological phases, including both Hermitian and non-Hermitian paradigms. In the presence of synthetic gauge field, spatial symmetries should be projectively represented, which can modify the Brillouin manifold. However, this is often overlooked in non-Hermitian systems. Here, we present that momentum-space non-symmorphic reflection symmetry, a typical projective symmetry, induce exceptional topology and the nonlocal skin effect in a two-dimensional non-Hermitian electric circuit. We observe the total topological charges 2, rather than 0, for all exceptional points in a Brillouin Klein bottle manifold, and the phase transition when an exceptional point crosses the antiparallel boundary and flips its topological charge. We further observe a novel skin effect that the skin modes at one side are nonlocally connected to those on the opposite side separated by half of the reciprocal lattice. Our results unveil the unique non-Hermitian phenomena enabled by the projective symmetry, and open avenues for exploring the non-Hermitian topology beyond Brillouin torus manifold.

Title: Decoupling of single-particle and collective dynamics in arrested phase-separating glassy mixtures
Authors: Konstantin N. Moser, Christos N. Likos, Vittoria Sposini
Abstract: We investigate the structure and dynamics of a hard colloid--star polymer mixture in the range of its arrested phase separation, where an incipient demixing transition is interfering with a nearby vitrification line, focusing on the protein limit (smaller hard component). Soft-hard mixtures present a rich dynamics, influenced by different parameters such as the concentration of the soft and hard components, the softness of the potential, and the size ratio between the two components. Using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we characterize the single-particle and collective dynamics of the hard colloidal tracers in the soft glassy matrix. The hard tracers show diffusive behavior of the mean squared displacement accompanied by non-exponential relaxation of the intermediate scattering functions at intermediate length scales and non-Gaussian displacement distributions. Moreover, we show that the system exhibits arrested phase separation, leading to population splitting and decoupling between self- and collective dynamics of the hard colloids. Overall, we demonstrate that the interplay between arrested phase separation and glassiness leads to complex, multiscale phenomena that strongly influence the dynamics of the hard additives in the arrested matrix formed by the soft colloids.

Title: Learning About Learning: A Physics Path from Spin Glasses to Artificial Intelligence
Authors: Denis D. Caprioti, Matheus Haas, Constantino F. Vasconcelos, Mauricio Girardi-Schappo
Abstract: The Hopfield model, originally inspired by spin-glass physics, occupies a central place at the intersection of statistical mechanics, neural networks, and modern artificial intelligence. Despite its conceptual simplicity and broad applicability -- from associative memory to near-optimal solutions of combinatorial optimization problems -- it is rarely integrated into standard undergraduate physics curricula. In this paper, we present the Hopfield model as a pedagogically rich framework that naturally unifies core topics from undergraduate statistical physics, dynamical systems, linear algebra, and computational methods. We provide a concise and illustrated theoretical introduction grounded in familiar physics concepts, analyze the model's energy function, dynamics, and pattern stability, and discuss practical aspects of simulation, including a freely available simulation code. To support instruction, we conclude with classroom-ready example problems designed to mirror research practice. By explicitly connecting fundamental physics to contemporary AI applications, this work aims to help prepare physics students to understand, apply, and critically engage with the computational tools increasingly central to research, industry, and society.

Title: From coherent to fermionized microwave photons in a superconducting transmission line
Authors: Alberto Tabarelli de Fatis, Stephanie Matern, Gianluca Rastelli, Iacopo Carusotto
Abstract: We investigate superconducting transmission lines as a novel platform for realizing a quantum fluid of microwave photons in a propagating geometry. We predict that the strong photon-photon interactions provided by the intrinsic nonlinearity of Josephson junctions are sufficient to enter a regime of strongly interacting photons for realistic parameters. A suitable tapering of the transmission line parameters allows for the adiabatic conversion of an incident coherent field into a Tonks-Girardeau gas of fermionized photons close to its ground state. Signatures of the strong correlations are anticipated in the correlation properties of the transmitted light.

Title: A density functional theory study of amino acids on Mg and Mg-based alloys
Authors: John Bolin, Amanda Goold, Olof Hildeberg, Alva Limbäck, Elsebeth Schröder
Abstract: Magnesium (Mg) has mechanical properties similar to bone tissue, and Mg ions take part in the metabolism. This makes Mg of interest for biocompatible degradable body implants, provided that its high corrosion rate can be inhibited. Slightly alloying Mg and adding surface coatings can slow down the corrosion processes without significantly changing the mechanical properties. Use of coating molecules that are native to the body increase the likelihood of making the surface biocompatible, for example by use of amino acids. We here present a density functional theory (DFT) study of the adsorption on Mg(0001) of the amino acids glycine, L-proline, and L-hydroxyproline (Hyp), the main amino acid content of collagen. We investigate how binding of the functional groups of Hyp are affected when Mg(0001) is slightly alloyed with zinc, lithium or aluminium, and we also model the immersion of the systems in a water environment to see how this affects the binding.

Title: Noise2Void for Denoising Atomic Resolution Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy Images
Authors: William Thornley, Sam Sullivan-Allsop, Rongsheng Cai, Nick Clark, Roman Gorbachev, Sarah J. Haigh
Abstract: The Noise2Void technique is demonstrated for successful denoising of atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images. The technique is applied to denoising atomic resolution images and videos of gold adatoms on a graphene surface within a graphene liquid cell, with the denoised experimental data qualitatively demonstrating improved visibility of both the Au adatoms and the graphene lattice. The denoising performance is quantified by comparison to similar simulated data and the approach is found to significantly outperform both total variation and simple Gaussian blurring. Compared to other denoising methods, the Noise2Void technique has the combined advantages that it requires no manual intervention during training or denoising, no prior knowledge of the sample and is compatible with real time data acquisition rates of at least 45 frames per second.

Title: Spin-lattice model simulations of tetragonal FePt system
Authors: Jakub Šebesta, Dominik Legut
Abstract: Magnetic materials play a key role in the contemporary industry, providing unique features with a wide application potential. To study physical phenomena and design new materials, it is important to possess an appropriate tool, a model allowing simulation of desired behavior. Spin-lattice model simulations can be used to investigate spacious systems containing thousands of atoms, while complex phenomena arising from the interplay of lattice and spin dynamics can be modeled. One of the important phenomena that can be modeled in the spin lattice simulation is magnetoelastic behavior, offering direct conversion between the mechanical and magnetic energy. However, so far, only models for systems with cubic symmetry have been introduced. Therefore, here, a spin-lattice model for a system with tetragonal symmetry is proposed, where its strength is manifested by simulation of magnetoelastic properties of a characteristic representative L1$_{0}$ FePt system.

Title: From perovskite to infinite-layer nickelates: hole concentration from x-ray absorption

Abstract: The difficulty of determining cation concentrations and oxygen stoichiometry in infinite-layer nickelate thin films has so far prevented clear experimental identification of the nickel electron configuration in the superconducting phase. We used soft x-ray absorption spectroscopy to study the successive changes in PrNiO$_x$ thin films at various intermediate stages of topotactic reduction with $x=2-3$. By comparing the Ni-$L$ edge spectra to single and double cluster ligand-field calculations, we find that none of our samples exhibit a pure $d^9$ configuration. Our quantitative analysis using the charge sum rule shows that even when films are maximally reduced, the averaged number of nickel $3d$ holes is 1.35. Superconducting samples have even higher values, calling into question the previously assumed limit of hole doping. Concomitant changes in the oxygen $K$-edge absorption spectra upon reduction indicate the presence of oxygen $2p$ holes, even in the most reduced films. Overall, our results suggest a complex interplay of hole doping mechanisms resulting from self-doping effects and oxygen non-stoichiometry.

Title: Effects of random vacancies on the spin-dependent thermoelectric properties of silicene nanoribbon
Authors: D. Zambrano, C. D. Núñez, P. A. Orellana, J. P. Ramos-Andrade, L. Rosales
Abstract: The spin-dependent thermoelectric properties of silicene nanoribbon heterostructures are investigated, in which the central conductor contains a random distribution of vacancies and is connected to two pristine leads of the same material, placed in proximity to ferromagnetic insulators. The magnetic moments of the leads are analyzed in both parallel and antiparallel configurations. A tight-binding Hamiltonian and the Green's function formalism are employed to calculate the spin-resolved thermoelectric properties of the system as functions of geometrical confinement and vacancy concentration. The results demonstrate an enhancement in charge and spin-dependent thermopower, resulting in an improved thermoelectric efficiency at room temperature, which overcomes the limitations imposed by the classical Wiedemann-Franz law. These findings indicate that defective silicene nanoribbons are promising platforms for the development of efficient thermoelectric and spin-caloritronic devices.

Title: Geometric theory of constrained Schrödinger dynamics with application to time-dependent density-functional theory on a finite lattice
Authors: Eric Cancès, Théo Duez, Jari van Gog, Asbjørn Bækgaard Lauritsen, Mathieu Lewin, Julien Toulouse
Abstract: Time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) is a central tool for studying the dynamical electronic structure of molecules and solids, yet aspects of its mathematical foundations remain insufficiently understood. In this work, we revisit the foundations of TDDFT within a finite-dimensional setting by developing a general geometric framework for Schrödinger dynamics subject to prescribed expectation values of selected observables. We show that multiple natural definitions of such constrained dynamics arise from the underlying geometry of the state manifold. The conventional TDDFT formulation emerges from demanding stationarity of the action functional, while an alternative, purely geometric construction leads to a distinct form of constrained Schrödinger evolution that has not been previously explored. This alternative dynamics may provide a more mathematically robust route to TDDFT and may suggest new strategies for constructing nonadiabatic approximations. Applying the theory to interacting fermions on finite lattices, we derive novel Kohn--Sham schemes in which the density constraint is enforced via an imaginary potential or, equivalently, a nonlocal Hermitian operator. Numerical illustrations for the Hubbard dimer demonstrate the behavior of these new approaches.

Abstract: We provide a new formulation of Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TDDFT) based on the geometric structure of the set of states constrained to have a fixed density. Orbital-free TDDFT is formulated using a hydrodynamics equation involving a new universal density-to-current functional map. In the corresponding Kohn--Sham equation, the density is reproduced using a non-local operator. Numerical simulations for one-dimensional soft-Coulomb systems are provided.

Title: Prediction of superconductivity in mass-asymmetric electron-hole bilayers
Authors: Luca Nashabeh, Liang Fu
Abstract: We study density-balanced, mass-asymmetric electron-hole bilayers as a tunable platform for correlated quantum phases. With independent control of carrier density and interlayer separation, the system exhibits a rich phase diagram, including exciton condensates, Wigner crystals, and for large hole-to-electron mass ratios, an electron-liquid hole-crystal phase. This mixed phase is an analog of two-dimensional metallic hydrogen, featuring an electron liquid immersed in and coupled to a lattice of heavy holes. We show that acoustic plasmons mediate an attractive interaction between electrons, leading to BCS-type superconductivity at experimentally accessible parameters. The superconducting transition temperature is calculated from first principles, and experimental realization in van der Waals heterostructures is discussed.

Title: Universal time-temperature scaling of conductivities in random site energy and associated random barrier model
Authors: Sven Lohmann, Quinn Emilia Fischer, Justus Leiber, Philipp Maass
Abstract: Universal time-temperature scaling of conductivity spectra in disordered solids has been explained by thermally activated hopping of noninteracting particles over random energy barriers. An open problem is whether the random barrier model accounts for site energy disorder in real materials. Through mapping many-particle hopping in a disordered site energy landscape to that of independent particles in a barrier landscape, we show that time-temperature scaling is correctly described by the associated barrier model in the low temperature limit. However, the site energy model displays good scaling behavior at substantially higher temperatures than the barrier model, in agreement with experimental observations. Extending the mapping to different types of mobile charge carriers allows us to understand why time-temperature superposition can be absent in mixed alkali glasses.

Title: Controlling microalgae populations by phototactic memory
Authors: Gianni Jacucci, Davide Breoni, Pierre Illien, Luca Tubiana, Jean-François Allemand, Sylvain Gigan, Raphaël Jeanneret
Abstract: Understanding how microorganisms navigate in complex environments is a central question in active matter and biological physics. Phototaxis - the ability to use light as a navigation cue - is a widespread strategy in motile microalgae to optimise photosynthesis and avoid light-induced stress. The microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a model system for studying this behaviour, where navigation is classically attributed to a photosensitive organelle named eyespot. While this mechanism enables cells to sense the direction of incoming light, their response to light intensity gradients remains less understood. Here we show that structured light landscapes can guide microalgae populations and localise them in defined spatial regions. By analysing single-cell trajectories, we find that cells actively steer relative to the local light gradient, and a comparison with a minimal theoretical model shows that a short-time memory of light exposure acting on the transition between positive and negative phototaxis is necessary to reproduce the observed accumulation. At longer times, we observe a gradual decrease in cell number density within the trapping region, consistent with phototactic adaptation. Beyond controlling population dynamics, our results reveal new aspects of phototactic behaviour, highlighting gradient-aligned steering together with temporal integration as central mechanisms for navigation in structured environments.

Title: PFT: Phonon Fine-tuning for Machine Learned Interatomic Potentials
Authors: Teddy Koker, Abhijeet Gangan, Mit Kotak, Jaime Marian, Tess Smidt
Abstract: Many materials properties depend on higher-order derivatives of the potential energy surface, yet machine learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) trained with standard a standard loss on energy, force, and stress errors can exhibit error in curvature, degrading the prediction of vibrational properties. We introduce phonon fine-tuning (PFT), which directly supervises second-order force constants of materials by matching MLIP energy Hessians to DFT-computed force constants from finite displacement phonon calculations. To scale to large supercells, PFT stochastically samples Hessian columns and computes the loss with a single Hessian-vector product. We also use a simple co-training scheme to incorporate upstream data to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. On the MDR Phonon benchmark, PFT improves Nequix MP (trained on Materials Project) by 55% on average across phonon thermodynamic properties and achieves state-of-the-art performance among models trained on Materials Project trajectories. PFT also generalizes to improve properties beyond second-derivatives, improving thermal conductivity predictions that rely on third-order derivatives of the potential energy.

Title: Ultrafast control of spin order by linearly polarized light in noncollinear antiferromagnetic metals

Abstract: The non-thermal optical control of magnetic order offers a promising route to ultrafast, energy-efficient information technologies. Although optical manipulation of magnetism in metals has been extensively studied, experimentally demonstrated effects have so far been limited to heat-driven dynamics or helicity-dependent mechanisms. Here, we report ultrafast non-thermal control of spin order in noncollinear antiferromagnetic Mn-based antiperovskite nitrides Mn3NiN and Mn3GaN, driven solely by the polarization orientation of linearly polarized femtosecond laser pulses. Using time-resolved magneto-optical pump-probe experiments based on the Voigt effect, we observe sub-picosecond changes in magnetic order followed by picosecond relaxation. The magneto-optical response depends on the relative orientation of the pump and probe polarization planes, with linear-polarization dependence reaching up to 95%, a value unprecedented in metallic magnets. This phenomenon is observed in two different materials and persists over a wide range of excitation wavelengths, fluences, and temperatures, demonstrating its robustness. Symmetry analysis and microscopic modeling indicate that optically induced torques alone cannot fully explain the observed dynamics. We therefore propose laser-induced formation of transient spin-spiral states as a possible excitation mechanism.

Title: Resolving the energy alignment between methylammonium lead iodide and C60: an in-situ photoelectron spectroscopy study
Authors: Alberto García-Fernández, Karen Radetzky, Stefania Riva, Birgit Kammlander, Brian Rydgren, Evelyn Johannesson, Rahul Mahavir Varma, Håkan Rensmo, Ute B. Cappel
Abstract: Understanding and controlling the energy level alignment at interfaces between lead halide perovskites and electron transport layers is crucial for optimizing charge extraction by minimizing recombination losses in high-efficiency perovskite solar cells. In this work, we investigated the energy level alignment of C60 on in-situ cleaved MAPbI3 single crystals in multiple repeat experiments using photoelectron spectroscopy aiming to resolve inconsistencies reported in earlier studies. Our results show that both materials remain chemically stable upon interface formation, the strong reactions typically seen when metals contact perovskites. By analyzing Pb 4f and C 1s core level positions in detail, we determined that C60 consistently exhibits a downward energy shift toward MAPbI3, which works against efficient charge extraction. The magnitude of this shift, however, is highly sensitive to the surface composition, highlighting that small variations may lead to significant differences in results. At higher C60 coverages of more than 5 monolayers, a constant HOMO-valence band offset of 0.52 eV was obtained. Assuming a 1.86 eV HOMO-LUMO gap, the C60 LUMO is 0.25 eV below the MAPbI3 conduction band, a value favorable for charge extraction. These findings underscore the decisive role of surface chemistry on interfacial energetics, explain performance variability in perovskite devices, and demonstrate the need to control and accurately measure surface properties. Furthermore, the observed energetic alignment can explain why further interface modification by charge blocking layers or surface passivation is needed for optimized device efficiencies.

Title: A DFT study of B-doped graphene as a metal-anchor: effects of oxidation and strain
Authors: Nikola Veličković, Natalia V. Skorodumova, Ana S. Dobrota
Abstract: In this work, we present a systematic DFT investigation of the interaction between B-doped graphene and four selected metals: Mg and Zn, relevant for next-generation metal-ion batteries, and Cu and Pt, important for single-atom catalysis. Three different boron doping concentrations were considered to elucidate how dopant density influences the binding strength, charge transfer, and electronic structure of the resulting systems. In addition, the effects of biaxial strain and surface oxidation were examined to assess their impact on the reactivity and stability of B-doped graphene. The results show that boron doping substantially enhances graphene's affinity toward metal adsorption, though the extent and nature of this effect depend strongly on the metal type and doping level. For some of the metals investigated, the interaction is found to be almost entirely charge-transfer driven, with minimal orbital hybridization. Mechanical strain is found to enable fine-tuning of the metal/substrate interaction, while surface oxidation introduces a more pronounced effect by enabling direct interaction between metal atoms and oxygen functional groups in most cases, thereby significantly altering adsorption geometry and strength. These findings provide valuable insights into the design of boron-doped graphene materials for energy conversion and storage applications.

Title: Phase transition, phase separation and mode softening of a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate in an optical cavity
Authors: Jia-Ying Lin, Wei Qin, Renyuan Liao
Abstract: We investigate the superradiant phase transition in a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate with distinct atomic detunings, confined in an optical cavity and driven by a transverse pump laser. By combining perturbation theory and numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the phase transition is dominated by the red-detuned component, resulting in a phase diagram completely different from that of a single-component case under blue-detuned condition. The system exhibits spontaneous phase separation between the two components, manifested as alternating stripe patterns in the normal phase and distinct Bragg gratings in the superradiant phase. Furthermore, the Bogoliubov excitation spectrum reveals roton-type mode softening, indicating that the phase transition also corresponds to the superfluid-to-lattice supersolid transition. Our findings provide insights into the interplay between atomic detunings and collective quantum many-body phenomena, offering potential applications in quantum simulation and optical switching technologies.

Title: Serial vs parallel recall in the Blume-Every-Griffiths neural networks
Authors: Linda Albanese, Andrea Alessandrelli, Adriano Barra, Emilio N. M. Cirillo
Abstract: Fully connected Blume-Emery-Griffiths neural networks performing pattern recognition and associative memory have been heuristically studied in the past (mainly via the replica trick and under the replica symmetric assumption) as generalization of the standard Hopfield reference. In these notes, at first, by relying upon Guerra interpolation, we re-obtain the existing picture rigorously. Next we show that, due to dilution in the patterns, these networks are able to switch from serial recall (where one pattern is retrieved per time) to parallel recall (where several patterns are retrieved at once) and the larger the dilution, the stronger this emerging multi-tasking capability. In particular, we inspect the regimes of mild dilution (where solely a low storage of pattern can be enabled) and extreme dilution (where a medium storage of patterns can be sustained) separately as they give rise to different outcomes: the former displays hierarchical recall (distributing the amplitudes of the retrieved signals with different amplitudes), the latter -instead- performs a equal-strength recall (where a O(1) fraction of all the patterns is simultaneously retrieved with the same amplitude per pattern). Finally, in order to implement graded responses in the neurons, variations on theme obtained by enlarging the possible values of neural activity these neurons may sustain are also discussed generalizing the Ghatak-Sherrington model for inverse freezing in Hebbian terms.

Title: Resonant magnetic proximity hot spots in Co/hBN/graphene
Authors: Klaus Zollner, Lukas Cvitkovich, Riccardo Silvioli, Andreas V. Stier, Jaroslav Fabian
Abstract: Magnetic proximity effects in Co/hBN/graphene heterostructures are systematically analyzed via first-principles calculations, demonstrating a pronounced localized spatial variation of the induced spin polarization of graphene's Dirac states. The proximity-induced exchange coupling, magnetic moments, and tunneling spin polarization (TSP) are shown to depend sensitively on the atomic registry at the interfaces. We analyze more than twenty distinct stackings, including high- and low-symmetry configurations, and reveal that the spin splittings of graphene's Dirac bands span a wide range from 1 to 100 meV, depending on the local hybridization of Co $d_{z^2}$, hBN $p_z$, and graphene $p_z$ orbitals. The strongest proximity effects emerge at geometric resonances, or "proximity hot spots", where the three orbital states overlap maximally. The local spin polarization also depends sensitively on energy: Dirac states aligned with resonant Co orbitals experience the most pronounced exchange interaction. At these energies, the pseudospin Hamiltonian description of magnetic proximity effects breaks down. Outside these resonances, the pseudospin picture is restored. Our findings highlight the intrinsically local nature of proximity effects, governed by the spectral resonance and interlayer wavefunction overlap. We further quantify how additional hBN layers, interlayer twist, and multilayer graphene modify the proximity exchange and TSP, offering microscopic insight for designing spintronic van der Waals heterostructures with engineered interfaces and optimized spin transport.

Title: Nonlinear interaction theory for parametrically-excited spin-wave modes in confined micromagnetic systems
Authors: Massimiliano d'Aquino, Salvatore Perna, Hugo Merbouche, Grégoire De Loubens
Abstract: We present a general theoretical approach for the quantitative description of parametric excitation of spin-wave modes in confined micromagnetic systems. This type of problem belongs to a broader class of nonlinear modal dynamics that arise across many areas of physics and engineering. The ferromagnetic sample is driven by parallel pumping with an external applied magnetic field having two tones at different frequencies, which are able to trigger parametric instability of two resonant modes. The two excited spin-wave modes interact in a strongly nonlinear fashion giving rise to quasiperiodicity, hysteresis and non-commutativity of steady-state oscillation regimes. To disentangle such a complex variety of dynamics, we develop a reduced-order model based on magnetization normal modes that is amenable of appropriate analytical treatment, leading to quantitative description of parametric instability thresholds, post-instability steady-state amplitude saturation and complete determination of phase diagrams for steady-state oscillation regimes. We have performed validation of the theory using numerical simulations. The phase diagrams allow to predict and explain all the features of the nonlinear interaction between the parametrically-excited spin-wave modes and can be directly compared with experimental results.

Title: Rigorous Anderson-type lower bounds on the ground-state energy of the pyrochlore Heisenberg antiferromagnet
Authors: Péter Kránitz, Karlo Penc
Abstract: We construct rigorous Anderson-type lower bounds on the ground-state energy of the spin-$S$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the pyrochlore lattice. By formulating and optimizing a hierarchy of local cluster motifs ordered by size, we generate a sequence of increasingly tight bounds. A seven-site "hourglass" cluster composed of two corner-sharing tetrahedra furnishes an optimal lower bound that admits a closed-form expression for arbitrary spin $S$. We also derive exact lower bounds for generalized models with further-neighbor exchange, ring exchange, and scalar spin-chirality interactions. For $S=1/2$ and $S=1$, numerical optimization of an 18-site "crown" cluster containing a hexagonal loop yields rigorous lower bounds on the ground-state energy per site of the nearest-neighbor Heisenberg model with unit exchange, $e_\mathrm{GS} \geq -0.549832$ and $e_\mathrm{GS} \geq -1.632985$, respectively. We compare the resulting bounds with numerical ground-state energy estimates from the literature.

Title: Ising Supercriticality and Universal Magnetocalorics in Spiral Antiferromagnet Nd$_3$BWO$_9$
Authors: Xinyang Liu, Enze Lv, Xueling Cui, Han Ge, Fangyuan Song, Liusuo Wu, Zhaoming Tian, Peijie Sun, Gang Su, Kan Zhao, Junsen Xiang, Wei Li
Abstract: The celebrated analogy between the pressure-temperature phase diagram of a liquid-gas system and the field-temperature phase diagram of an Ising ferromagnet has long been a cornerstone for understanding universality in critical phenomena. Here we extend this analogy to a highly frustrated antiferromagnet, the kagome-layered spiral Ising compound Nd$_3$BWO$_9$. In its field-temperature phase diagram, we identify a critical endpoint (CEP) and an associated Ising supercritical regime (ISR). The CEP of the metamagnetic transition is located at ${\mu_0H_c} \simeq 1.04$ T and $T_c \simeq 0.3$ K. Above this point, the ISR emerges with supercritical crossover lines that adhere to a universal scaling law, as evidenced by the specific heat and magnetic susceptibility measurements. Remarkably, we observe a universally divergent Grueneisen ratio near the emergent CEP, $\Gamma_H \propto 1/t^{\beta+\gamma-1}$, with ${\beta} + {\gamma} \simeq 1.563$ the critical exponents of the 3D Ising universality class and $t \equiv (T - T_c)/T_c$ the reduced temperature. Our adiabatic demagnetization measurements on Nd$_3$BWO$_9$ reveal a lowest temperature of 195 mK achieved from 2 K and 4 T. Our work opens new avenues for studying supercritical physics and efficient cooling in layered-kagome, rare-earth RE$_3$BWO$_9$ family and, more broadly, in Ising-anisotropic magnets like spin ices.

Title: Interface roughening in the 3-D Ising model with tensor networks
Authors: Atsushi Ueda, Lander Burgelman, Luca Tagliacozzo, Laurens Vanderstraeten
Abstract: Interfaces in three-dimensional many-body systems can exhibit rich phenomena beyond the corresponding bulk properties. In particular, they can fluctuate and give rise to massless low energy degrees of freedom even in the presence of a gapped bulk. In this work, we present the first tensor-network study of the paradigmatic interface roughening transition of the 3-D Ising model using highly asymmetric lattices that are infinite in the $(xy)$ direction and finite in $z$. By reducing the problem to an effective 2-D tensor network, we study how truncating the $z$ direction reshapes the physics of the interface. For a truncation based on open boundary conditions, we demonstrate that varying the interface width gives rise to either a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry breaking transition (for odd $L_z$) or a smooth crossover(for even $L_z$). For antiperiodic boundary conditions, we obtain an effective $\mathbb{Z}_q$ clock model description with $q=2L_z$ that exhibits an intermediate Luttinger liquid phase with an emergent $\U(1)$ symmetry.

Title: A Polarization Hall Effect in Hydrated DNA
Authors: Mariusz Pietruszka
Abstract: Understanding how biological soft matter responds to electromagnetic fields under ambient conditions remains a central challenge, as thermal fluctuations are generally expected to suppress long-range organization. Here, we report that hydrated DNA exhibits a reproducible magnetic-field-induced transition characterized by a sharp transverse-voltage threshold (40-50 mV), followed by a regime of regular, phase-stable oscillations in the transverse polarization signal. These features emerge only beyond the threshold and display a pronounced temperature dependence, consistent with the formation of a collective mode within the hydrogen-bond network of the DNA-water interface. Motivated by recent studies of Hall-like responses carried by neutral excitations, including phonons, magnons, and excitons, we interpret the observed transverse signal in terms of coherent polarization dynamics of proton-proton-hole dipoles confined to a quasi-two-dimensional hydrated layer. Within this framework, the transverse response is attributed to a field-organized polarization mode; the measured transverse voltage arises from collective dipolar dynamics rather than steady carrier transport. These results identify hydrated DNA as a soft-matter system in which magnetic field and temperature jointly modulate collective polarization dynamics, providing a biologically relevant platform for exploring coherence and transverse responses in hydrogen-bonded media.

Title: Energetic vs Inference-Based Invisibility: Fisher-Information Analysis of Two-Layer Acoustic Near-Cloaks
Authors: J. Sumaya-Martinez, J. Mulia-Rodriguez
Abstract: Near-cloaks based on passive coatings can strongly suppress scattered-field energy in a narrow frequency band, yet an observer's ability to infer object parameters from noisy measurements need not decrease proportionally. We develop a fully theoretical two-dimensional (2D) framework for a coated acoustic cylinder in an air background. Using an exact cylindrical-harmonic solution of the Helmholtz equation, we compute the modal scattering coefficients a_m(omega) for a core of radius a surrounded by two concentric effective-fluid layers, and we design the coating to cancel the dominant low-order multipoles (monopole m=0 and dipole m=+/-1) at a target frequency, yielding a narrowband near-cloak. Beyond the conventional energetic metric (total scattering width), we quantify information-based detectability through the Fisher information matrix (FIM) and the associated Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) for joint estimation of the size-material parameter vector x=[a, rho1, c1]^T from noisy far-field data. A representative air-background study exhibits an approximately 25 dB reduction in total scattering width near the design frequency, while tr(FIM) decreases by only a few dB, demonstrating that energy-based and inference-based notions of invisibility are distinct objectives. We further provide a low-order analytic argument clarifying the mechanism behind this energetic-informational decoupling and report design-space and local-robustness diagnostics that highlight persistent trade-offs between scattering suppression and parameter identifiability.

Title: Co-doping of silicate bioceramics as a potential strategy to further enhance mono-doping consequences
Authors: Sohrab Mofakhami, Erfan Salahinejad
Abstract: Silicate bioceramics have attracted significant attention in medical applications, particularly in hard tissue regeneration, because of their controllable chemical, physical, and biological functionalities, while ensuring biocompatibility. The coordination of silicate bioceramics with mono-dopants has been extensively studied to enhance their osteogenesis, angiogenesis, and antibacterial activity. However, the concept of employing dual or multiple co-doping to further enhance these biomaterials still demands more attention. This review paper originally focuses on the effect of chemical interactions among co-dopants and the principal constituents of the silicates, on the bio-behavior of these bioceramics. Additionally, future prospects of co-doped silicate bioceramics are outlined, including in vivo studies, clinical trials, and potential commercialization.

Title: Theoretical investigation of non-Förster exciton transfer mechanisms in perylene diimide donor, phenylene bridge, and terrylene diimide acceptor systems
Authors: Lei Yang, Seogjoo J. Jang
Abstract: The rates of exciton transfer within dyads of perylene diimide and terrylene diimide connected by oligophenylene bridge units have been shown to deviate significantly from those of Förster's resonance energy transfer theory, according to single molecule spectroscopy experiments. The present work provides a detailed computational and theoretical study investigating the source of such discrepancy. Electronic spectroscopy data are calculated by time-dependent density function theory and then compared with experimental results. Electronic couplings between exciton donor and acceptor are estimated based on both transition density cube method and transition dipole approximation. These results confirm that the delocalization of exciton to the bridge parts contribute to significant enhancement of donor-acceptor electronic coupling. Mechanistic details of exciton transfer are examined by estimating the contributions of the bridge electronic states, vibrational modes of the dyads commonly coupled to both donor and acceptor, inelastic resonance energy transfer mechanism, and dark exciton states. These analyses suggest that the contribution of common vibrational modes serves as the main source of deviation from Förster's spectral overlap expression.

Title: Universal Predictors for Mixing Time more than Liouvillian Gap
Authors: Yi-Neng Zhou
Abstract: We analyze the mixing time of open quantum systems governed by the Lindblad master equation, showing it is not only determined by the Liouvillian gap, but also the trace norm of the lowest excited state of Liouvillian superoperator. By utilizing these universal predictors of mixing time, we establish general conditions for the fast and rapid mixing respectively. Specifically, we derive rapid mixing conditions for both the strong and weak dissipation regimes, formulated as sparsity constraints on the Hamiltonian and the local Lindblad operators. Our findings provide a general framework for calculating mixing time and offer a guide for designing dissipation to achieve desired mixing speeds, which has significant implications for efficient experimental state preparation.

Title: Building blocks of topological band theory for photonic crystals
Authors: Yoonseok Hwang, Vaibhav Gupta, Antonio Morales-Pérez, Chiara Devescovi, Mikel García-Díez, Juan L. Mañes, Maia G. Vergniory, Aitzol García-Etxarri, Barry Bradlyn
Abstract: We derive a framework for classifying topological bands in three-dimensional photonic band structures, where the zero frequency polarization singularity implied by Maxwell's equations complicates the direct application of existing symmetry-based approaches. Building on recent advances in the regularization of photonic bands, we use the recently introduced concept of stable real-space invariants (SRSIs) to show how photonic band structures can be unambiguously characterized in terms of equivalence classes of band representations. We classify topologically trivial photonic bands using SRSIs, treating them as the fundamental building blocks of 3D photonic band structures. This means that if certain bands cannot be constructed from these building blocks, they are necessarily topological. Furthermore, we distinguish between photonic and electronic band structures by analyzing which SRSI values are allowed in systems with and without polarization singularity. We also explore the impact of the polarization singularity on the behavior of Wilson loops, providing new insights into the topological classification of 3D photonic systems.

Title: Quantum algorithm for dephasing of coupled systems: decoupling and IQP duality
Authors: Sabrina Yue Wang, Raul A. Santos
Abstract: Noise and decoherence are ubiquitous in the dynamics of quantum systems coupled to an external environment. In the regime where environmental correlations decay rapidly, the evolution of a subsytem is well described by a Lindblad quantum master equation. In this work, we introduce a quantum algorithm for simulating unital Lindbladian dynamics by sampling unitary quantum channels without extra ancillas. Using ancillary qubits we show that this algorithm allows approximating general Lindbladians as well. For interacting dephasing Lindbladians coupling two subsystems, we develop a decoupling scheme that reduces the circuit complexity of the simulation. This is achieved by sampling from a time-correlated probability distribution - determined by the evolution of one subsystem, which specifies the stochastic circuit implemented on the complementary subsystem. We demonstrate our approach by studying a model of bosons coupled to fermions via dephasing, which naturally arises from anharmonic effects in an electron-phonon system coupled to a bath. Our method enables tracing out the bosonic degrees of freedom, reducing part of the dynamics to sampling an instantaneous quantum polynomial (IQP) circuit. The sampled bitstrings then define a corresponding fermionic problem, which in the non-interacting case can be solved efficiently classically. We comment on the computational complexity of this class of dissipative problems, using the known fact that sampling from IQP circuits is believed to be difficult classically.

Title: Controlling Rydberg atom-polariton interactions: from exceptional points to fast readout
Authors: Tamara Šumarac, Emily H. Qiu, Shai Tsesses, Peiran Niu, Adrian J. Menssen, Wenchao Xu, Valentin Walther, Uroš Delić, Soonwon Choi, Mikhail D. Lukin, Vladan Vuletić
Abstract: Rydberg atoms represent a platform underpinning many recent developments in quantum computation, simulation, sensing, and metrology. They further facilitate optical nonlinearity at the single-photon level when coupled to photons propagating in atomic clouds, which form collective atomic excitations called Rydberg polaritons, strongly interacting with each other. Here, we experimentally explore interactions between a Rydberg polariton in an atomic ensemble and a single, adjacent, Rydberg atom. We discover three different regimes of quantum dynamics corresponding to polariton blockade, coherent exchange, and probabilistic hopping, which are defined by their distinct transmission characteristics, with a transition through an exceptional point occurring between blockade and coherent exchange. We investigate the applications of such interactions for fast, non-destructive detection of Rydberg atoms and present proof-of-principle demonstrations for their potential application in nonlinear photonic networks.

Title: Physics-Informed Tree Search for High-Dimensional Computational Design
Authors: Suvo Banik, Troy D. Loeffler, Henry Chan, Sukriti Manna, Orcun Yildiz, Tom Peterka, Subramanian Sankaranarayanan
Abstract: High-dimensional design spaces underpin a wide range of physics-based modeling and computational design tasks in science and engineering. These problems are commonly formulated as constrained black-box searches over rugged objective landscapes, where function evaluations are expensive, and gradients are unavailable or unreliable. Conventional global search engines and optimizers struggle in such settings due to the exponential scaling of design spaces, the presence of multiple local basins, and the absence of physical guidance in sampling. We present a physics-informed Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework that extends policy-driven tree-based reinforcement concepts to continuous, high-dimensional scientific optimization. Our method integrates population-level decision trees with surrogate-guided directional sampling, reward shaping, and hierarchical switching between global exploration and local exploitation. These ingredients allow efficient traversal of non-convex, multimodal landscapes where physically meaningful optima are sparse. We benchmark our approach against standard global optimization baselines on a suite of canonical test functions, demonstrating superior or comparable performance in terms of convergence, robustness, and generalization. Beyond synthetic tests, we demonstrate physics-consistent applicability to (i) crystal structure optimization from clusters to bulk, (ii) fitting of classical interatomic potentials, and (iii) constrained engineering design problems. Across all cases, the method converges with high fidelity and evaluation efficiency while preserving physical constraints. Overall, our work establishes physics-informed tree search as a scalable and interpretable paradigm for computational design and high-dimensional scientific optimization, bridging discrete decision-making frameworks with continuous search in scientific design workflows.

Title: Comminution as a Non-Hermitian Quantum Field Theory: Log-Size Jump Generators, Branching Embeddings, and the Airy Solvable Sector
Authors: Juan J. Segura
Abstract: Pure-breakage population balance equations (PBEs) give the standard deterministic description of fragmentation and comminution. They predict mean particle size distributions, but they do not determine fluctuations, size-size correlations, or universality under coarse-graining. We develop a field-theoretic framework anchored in the PBE kernel inputs (selection rate and daughter distribution) and compatible with the stochastic Doi-Peliti approach. From homogeneous kernels we derive an exact Markov jump generator in log-size for a mass-weighted (tagged-mass) distribution, with a jump law that is a probability density fixed by the daughter distribution. The generator is generically non-self-adjoint, admits a Lindblad embedding, and has a second-quantized extension. The deterministic PBE appears as the one-body sector, while multi-point correlators encode finite-population fluctuations. We also give a binary-fragmentation embedding whose mean-field limit reproduces the PBE but whose higher correlators capture multiplicative cascade noise. For a linear Airy-type kernel, long-wavelength coarse-graining yields an effective Airy operator as a solvable quadratic sector about a stationary profile, producing explicit mode-sum formulas for equal-time connected two-point correlations. Overall, the framework separates what is fixed by kernel data from what requires additional stochastic modeling and links comminution kernels to universality classes.

Title: Chip-integrated metasurface-enabled single-photon skyrmion sources
Authors: Xujing Liu, Yinhui Kan, Shailesh Kumar, Liudmilla F. Kulikova, Valery A. Davydov, Viatcheslav N. Agafonov, Sergey I. Bozhevolnyi
Abstract: Skyrmions, topologically stable field configurations, have recently emerged in classical optics as structured light for high-density data applications. Achieving controllable on-chip generation of single-photon skyrmions, while being highly desirable for quantum information technologies, remains challenging due to the nanoscale confinement of quantum emitters (QEs). Here we demonstrate a metasurface-integrated quantum emitter (metaQE) platform enabling room-temperature on-chip generation of single-photon skyrmions. Near-field coupling between QEs and propitiously designed surface arrays of meta-atoms mediates spin-orbit interaction, transforming nanoscale-localized dipole emission into free-propagating topologically structured photonic modes. By exploiting this approach for structuring quantum emission from different color centers in nanodiamonds, we realize diverse skyrmionic states, including high-order anti-skyrmions and skyrmionium, and thereby demonstrate its universality across QEs. Our work establishes a unified framework for on-chip structured quantum light sources, offering versatile control of high-dimensional topological states, such as skyrmions, and advancing scalable quantum photonic technologies.

Title: Non-Abelian qLDPC: TQFT Formalism, Addressable Gauging Measurement and Application to Magic State Fountain on 2D Product Codes
Authors: Guanyu Zhu, Ryohei Kobayashi, Po-Shen Hsin
Abstract: A fundamental problem of fault-tolerant quantum computation with quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes is the tradeoff between connectivity and universality. It is widely believed that in order to perform native logical non-Clifford gates, one needs to resort to 3D product-code constructions. In this work, we extend Kitaev's framework of non-Abelian topological codes on manifolds to non-Abelian qLDPC codes (realized as Clifford-stabilizer codes) and the corresponding combinatorial topological quantum field theories (TQFT) defined on Poincaré CW complexes and certain types of general chain complexes. We also construct the spacetime path integrals as topological invariants on these complexes. Remarkably, we show that native non-Clifford logical gates can be realized using constant-rate 2D hypergraph-product codes and their Clifford-stabilizer variants. This is achieved by a spacetime path integral effectively implementing the addressable gauging measurement of a new type of 0-form subcomplex symmetries, which correspond to addressable transversal Clifford gates and become higher-form symmetries when lifted to higher-dimensional CW complexes or manifolds. Building on this structure, we apply the gauging protocol to the magic state fountain scheme for parallel preparation of $O(\sqrt{n})$ disjoint CZ magic states with code distance of $O(\sqrt{n})$, using a total number of $n$ qubits.

Title: Imaginary Gauge-steerable Edge Modes In Non-Hermitian Aubry-André-Harper Model
Authors: Yazhuang Miao, Wei Ding, Litong Wang, Xiaolong Zhao, Shengguang Liu, Xuexi Yi
Abstract: We investigate a non-Hermitian Aubry-André-Harper lattice exhibiting quasiperiodicity, featuring an imaginary gauge field that varies spatially but averages to zero. In the presence of open boundary conditions, this system is precisely mapped, through a nonunitary gauge transformation, to the Hermitian AAH model with balanced hopping terms. The mapping leaves the spectrum unchanged but reshapes each eigenfunction by a realization-dependent random-walk envelope. In a parameter regime where the Hermitian counterpart hosts spectrally isolated in-gap boundary modes, we identify two such modes with sharply different responses to the envelope: one stays anchored at the boundary, while the other is controllable via the gauge, allowing its peak intensity to be relocated solely by altering the gauge setup without modifying the associated eigenenergy. Additionally, we demonstrate that this steerable mode can be preferentially enhanced and generated from an initial bulk wavefunction by introducing mild site-specific amplification at a location determined exclusively from the Hermitian model using the biorthogonal function. These findings offer pathways for both static and dynamic manipulation of spatially adjustable in-gap states in quasiperiodic non-Hermitian lattices.

Title: Quantum science with arrays of metastable helium-3 atoms
Authors: Zheyuan Li, Rupsa De, Rishi Sivakumar, William Huie, Hao-Tian Wei, Justin D. Piel, Chris H. Greene, Kaden R. A. Hazzard, Zoe Z. Yan, Jacob P. Covey
Abstract: The motion of atoms in programmable optical tweezer arrays offers many new opportunities for neutral atom quantum science. These include inter- and intra-site atom motion for resource-efficient implementations of fermionic and bosonic modes, respectively, as well as tweezer transport for efficient compilation of arbitrary circuits. However, the exploitation of atomic motion for all three purposes and others is limited by the inertia of the atoms. We present a comprehensive architectural blueprint for the use of fermionic metastable helium-3 ($^3$He$^*$) atoms -- the lightest trappable atomic species -- in programmable optical tweezer arrays. This includes a concrete analysis of atomic structure considerations as well as Rydberg-mediated interactions. We show that inter-tweezer hopping of $^3$He$^*$ atoms can be $\gtrsim3\times$ faster than previous demonstrations with lithium-6. We also demonstrate a new toolbox for encoding and manipulating qubits directly in the tweezer trap potential, uniquely enabled by the light mass of $^3$He$^*$. Finally, we provide several examples of new opportunities for fermionic quantum simulation and computation that leverage the transport and inter-tweezer hopping of $^3$He$^*$ atom arrays. These tools present new methods to improve the resource efficiency of neutral atom quantum science that may also enable quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories and quantum chemistry outside the Born-Oppenheimer approximation

Title: Cancelling second order frequency shifts in Ge hole spin qubits via bichromatic control
Authors: Xiangjun Tan, Zhanning Wang, Wenkai Bai, Hanjie Zhu
Abstract: Germanium quantum dot hole spin qubits are compatible with fully electrical control and are progressing toward multi-qubit operations. However, their coherence is limited by charge noise and driving field induced frequency shifts, and the resulting ensemble $1/f$ dephasing. Here we theoretically demonstrate that a bichromatic driving scheme cancels the second order frequency shift from the control field without sacrificing the electric dipole spin resonance (EDSR) rate, and without additional gate design or microwave engineering. Based on this property, we further demonstrate that bichromatic control creates a wide operating window that reduces sensitivity to quasi-static charge noise and thus enhances single qubit gate fidelity. This method provides a low-power route to a stabler frequency operation in germanium hole spin qubits and is readily transferable to other semiconductor spin qubit platforms.

Title: Obstructions to Unitary Hamiltonians in Non-Unitary String-Net Models
Authors: Hanshi Yang (Northwood High School)
Abstract: The Levin-Wen string-net formalism provides a canonical mapping from spherical fusion categories to local Hamiltonians defining Topological Quantum Field Theories (TQFTs). While the topological invariance of the ground state is guaranteed by the pentagon identity, the realization of the model on a physical Hilbert space requires the category to be unitary. In this work, we investigate the obstructions arising when this construction is applied to non-unitary spherical categories, specifically the Yang-Lee model (the non-unitary minimal model $\mathcal{M}(2,5)$). We first validate our framework by explicitly constructing and verifying the Hamiltonians for rank-3 ($\text{Rep}(D_3)$), rank-5 ($\text{TY}(\mathbb{Z}_4)$), and Abelian ($\mathbb{Z}_7$) unitary categories. We then apply this machinery to the non-unitary Yang-Lee model. Using a custom gradient-descent optimization algorithm on the manifold of $F$-symbols, we demonstrate that the Yang-Lee fusion rules admit no unitary solution to the pentagon equations. We explain this failure analytically by proving that negative quantum dimensions impose an indefinite metric on the string-net space, realizing a Krein space rather than a Hilbert space. Finally, we invoke the theory of $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric quantum mechanics to interpret the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, establishing that the obstruction is intrinsic to the fusion ring and cannot be removed by unitary gauge transformations.

Abstract: Noisy and Intermediate-Scale Quantum, or NISQ, processors are sensitive to noise, prone to quantum decoherence, and are not yet capable of continuous quantum error correction for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Hence, quantum algorithms designed in the pre-fault-tolerant era cannot neglect the noisy nature of the hardware, and investigating the relationship between quantum hardware performance and the output of quantum algorithms is essential. In this work, we experimentally study how hardware-aware variational quantum circuits on a superconducting quantum processing unit can model distributions relevant to specific use-case applications for Credit Risk Analysis, e.g., standard Gaussian distributions for latent factor loading in the Gaussian Conditional Independence model. We use a transpilation technique tailored to the specific quantum hardware topology, which minimizes gate depth and connectivity violations, and we calibrate the gate rotations of the circuit to achieve an optimized output from quantum algorithms. Our results demonstrate the viability of quantum adaptation on a small-scale, proof-of-concept model inspired by financial applications and offer a good starting point for understanding the practical use of NISQ devices.

Title: Benchmarking Autonomy in Scientific Experiments: A Hierarchical Taxonomy for Autonomous Large-Scale Facilities
Authors: James Le Houx
Abstract: The transition from automated data collection to fully autonomous discovery requires a shared vocabulary to benchmark progress. While the automotive industry relies on the SAE J3016 standard, current taxonomies for autonomous science presuppose an owner-operator model that is incompatible with the operational rigidities of Large-Scale User Facilities. Here, we propose the Benchmarking Autonomy in Scientific Experiments (BASE) Scale, a 6-level taxonomy (Levels 0-5) specifically adapted for these unique constraints. Unlike owner-operator models, User Facilities require zero-shot deployment where agents must operate immediately without extensive training periods. We define the specific technical requirements for each tier, identifying the Inference Barrier (Level 3) as the critical latency threshold where decisions shift from scalar feedback to semantic digital twins. Fundamentally, this level extends the decision manifold from spatial exploration to temporal gating, enabling the agent to synchronise acquisition with the onset of transient physical events. By establishing these operational definitions, the BASE Scale provides facility directors, funding bodies, and beamline scientists with a standardised metric to assess risk, define liability, and quantify the intelligence of experimental workflows.

Title: Dynamical Correlation of the Post-quench Non-thermal Equilibrium State

Abstract: After a quantum quench, the integrable system is expected to relax to a non-thermal equilibrium state (NTES) whose local properties are believed to be governed by a generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE). Combining quench action and the form factor approach, we compute the field-field correlation in the NTES produced by an interaction quench of the Lieb-Liniger model. The spectral distribution is shown to be qualitatively different from that of a thermal equilibrium state (TES): a new dispersion branch appears whose microscopic mechanism can be traced to the algebraic decaying tail for the root density distribution function, and indicates the existence of a broader family of NTES featuring similar spectral property.

Title: Cation Dominated but Negatively Charged Na2SO4,aq-Graphene Interfaces
Authors: Ademola Soyemi, Tibor Szilvasi
Abstract: The distribution of ions and their impact on the structure of electrolyte interfaces plays an important role in many applications. Interestingly, recent experimental studies have suggested the preferential accumulation of $SO_4^{2-}$ ions at the $Na_2SO_{4,aq}$-graphene interface in disagreement with the generally known tendency of cations to accumulate at graphene-electrolyte interfaces. Herein, we resolve the atomistic structure of the $Na_2SO_{4,aq}$-graphene interfaces in the 0.1-2.0 M concentration range using machine learning interatomic potential-based simulations and simulated sum frequency generation (SFG) spectra to reveal the molecular origins of the conundrum. Our results show that Na+ ions accumulate between the outermost and second water layers whereas $SO_4^{2-}$ ions accumulate within the second interfacial water layer indicating cation dominated interfaces. We find that the interfacial region (within ~10 $Å$ of the graphene sheet) is negatively charged due to sub-stoichiometric $Na^+$/$SO_4^{2-}$ ratio at the interface. Our simulated SFG spectra show enhancement and a red-shift of the spectra in the hydrogen bonded region as a function of $Na_2SO_4$ concentration similar to measurements due to $SO_4^{2-}$-induced changes in the orientational order of water molecules in the second interfacial layer. Our study demonstrates that ion stratification and ion-induced water reorganization are key elements of understanding the electrolyte-graphene interface.

Title: Quantum state engineering of spin-orbit coupled ultracold atoms in a Morse potential
Authors: Yue Ban, Xi Chen, J. G. Muga, E. Ya Sherman
Abstract: Achieving full control of a Bose-Einstein condensate can have valuable applications in metrology, quantum information processing, and quantum condensed matter physics. We propose protocols to simultaneously control the internal (related to its pseudospin-1/2) and motional (position-related) states of a spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensate confined in a Morse potential. In the presence of synthetic spin-orbit coupling, the state transition of a noninteracting condensate can be implemented by Raman coupling and detuning terms designed by invariant-based inverse engineering. The state transfer may also be driven by tuning the direction of the spin-orbit-coupling field and modulating the magnitude of the effective synthetic magnetic field. The results can be generalized for interacting condensates by changing the time-dependent detuning to compensate for the interaction. We find that a two-level algorithm for the inverse engineering remains numerically accurate even if the entire set of possible states is considered. The proposed approach is robust against the laser-field noise and systematic device-dependent errors.

Title: Approximate FKG inequalities for phase-bound spin systems
Authors: Satyaki Mukherjee, Vilas Winstein
Abstract: The FKG inequality is an invaluable tool in monotone spin systems satisfying the FKG lattice condition, which provides positive correlations for all coordinate-wise increasing functions of spins. However, the FKG lattice condition is somewhat brittle and is not preserved when confining a spin system to a particular phase. For instance, consider the Curie-Weiss model, which is a model of a ferromagnet with two phases at low temperature corresponding to positive and negative overall magnetization. It is not a priori clear if each phase internally has positive correlations for increasing functions, or if the positive correlations in the model arise primarily from the global choice of positive or negative magnetization. In this article, we show that the individual phases do indeed satisfy an approximate form of the FKG inequality in a class of generalized higher-order Curie-Weiss models (including the standard Curie-Weiss model as a special case), as well as in ferromagnetic exponential random graph models (ERGMs). To cover both of these settings, we present a general result which allows for the derivation of such approximate FKG inequalities in a straightforward manner from inputs related to metastable mixing; we expect that this general result will be widely applicable. In addition, we derive some consequences of the approximate FKG inequality, including a version of a useful covariance inequality originally due to Newman as well as Bulinski and Shabanovich. We use this to extend the proof of the central limit theorem for ERGMs within a phase at low temperatures, due to the second author, to the non-forest phase-coexistence regime, answering a question posed by Bianchi, Collet, and Magnanini for the edge-triangle model.

Title: Direct temperature readout in nonequilibrium quantum thermometry
Authors: Yan Xie, Junjie Liu
Abstract: Quantum thermometry aims to measure temperature in nanoscale quantum systems, paralleling classical thermometry. However, temperature is not a quantum observable, and most theoretical studies have therefore concentrated on analyzing fundamental precision limits set by the quantum Fisher information through the quantum Cramer-Rao bound. In contrast, whether a direct temperature readout can be achieved in quantum thermometry remains largely unexplored, particularly under the nonequilibrium conditions prevalent in real-world applications. To address this, we develop a direct temperature readout scheme based on a thermodynamic inference strategy. The scheme integrates two conceptual developments: (i) By applying the maximum entropy principle with the thermometer's mean energy as a constraint, we assign a reference temperature to the nonequilibrium thermometer. We demonstrate that this reference temperature outperforms a commonly used effective temperature defined through equilibrium analogy. (ii) We obtain positive semi-definite error functions that lower-bound the deviation of the reference temperature from the true temperature-in analogy to the quantum Cramer-Rao bound for the mean squared error-and vanish upon thermalization with the sample. Combining the reference temperature with these error functions, we introduce a notion of corrected dynamical temperature which furnishes a postprocessed temperature readout under nonequilibrium conditions. We validate the corrected dynamical temperature in a qubit-based thermometer under a range of nonequilibrium initial states, confirming its capability to estimate the true temperature. Importantly, we find that increasing quantum coherence can enhance the precision of this readout.

Title: Simulated Annealing-based Candidate Optimization for Batch Acquisition Functions
Authors: Sk Md Ahnaf Akif Alvi, Raymundo Arróyave, Douglas Allaire
Abstract: Bayesian Optimization with multi-objective acquisition functions such as q-Expected Hypervolume Improvement (qEHVI) requires efficient candidate optimization to maximize acquisition function values. Traditional approaches rely on continuous optimization methods like Sequential Least Squares Programming (SLSQP) for candidate selection. However, these gradient-based methods can become trapped in local optima, particularly in complex or high-dimensional objective landscapes. This paper presents a simulated annealing-based approach for candidate optimization in batch acquisition functions as an alternative to conventional continuous optimization methods. We evaluate our simulated annealing approach against SLSQP across four benchmark multi-objective optimization problems: ZDT1 (30D, 2 objectives), DTLZ2 (7D, 3 objectives), Kursawe (3D, 2 objectives), and Latent-Aware (4D, 2 objectives). Our results demonstrate that simulated annealing consistently achieves superior hypervolume performance compared to SLSQP in most test functions. The improvement is particularly pronounced for DTLZ2 and Latent-Aware problems, where simulated annealing reaches significantly higher hypervolume values and maintains better convergence characteristics. The histogram analysis of objective space coverage further reveals that simulated annealing explores more diverse and optimal regions of the Pareto front. These findings suggest that metaheuristic optimization approaches like simulated annealing can provide more robust and effective candidate optimization for multi-objective Bayesian optimization, offering a promising alternative to traditional gradient-based methods for batch acquisition function optimization.

Title: Impact of Boundary Conditions on the Double-Kicked Quantum Rotor
Authors: Victoria Motsch, Nikolai Bolik, Sandro Wimberger
Abstract: We study the on-resonance Spin-1/2 Double Kicked Rotor, a periodically driven quantum system that hosts topological phases. Motivated by experimental constraints, we analyze the effects of open and periodic boundary conditions in contrast to the idealized case of infinite momentum space. As a bulk probe for topological invariants, we focus on the Mean Chiral Displacement (MCD) and show that it exhibits a pronounced sensitivity to boundary conditions, which can be traced to the dynamics in momentum space. Under open boundaries, states that would otherwise extend freely become localized at the edges of the finite momentum space, forming quasienergy edge states. While the bulk response measured by the MCD is strongly affected once the evolving wave packet reaches the boundaries, the persistence of these edge states still reflects the bulk-edge correspondence and provides reliable signatures of topological transitions.

Title: Noise enhances odor source localization
Authors: Francesco Marcolli, Martin James, Agnese Seminara
Abstract: We address the problem of inferring the location of a target that releases odor in the presence of turbulence. Input for the inference is provided by many sensors scattered within the odor plume. Drawing inspiration from distributed chemosensation in biology, we ask whether the accuracy of the inference is affected by proprioceptive noise, i.e., noise on the perceived location of the sensors. Surprisingly, in the presence of a net fluid flow, proprioceptive noise improves Bayesian inference, rather than degrading it. An optimal noise exists that efficiently leverages additional information hidden within the geometry of the odor plume. Empirical tuning of noise functions well across a range of distances and may be implemented in practice. Other sources of noise also improve accuracy, owing to their ability to break the spatiotemporal correlations of the turbulent plume. These counterintuitive benefits of noise may be leveraged to improve sensory processing in biology and robotics.

Title: Phase-field approximation of sharp-interface energies accounting for lattice symmetry
Authors: Sergio Conti, Vito Crismale, Adriana Garroni, Annalisa Malusa
Abstract: We present a phase-field approximation of sharp-interface energies defined on partitions, designed for modeling grain boundaries in polycrystals. The independent variable takes values in the orthogonal group $\mathrm{O}(d)$ modulo a lattice point group $\mathcal{G}$, reflecting the crystallographic symmetries of the underlying lattice. In the sharp-interface limit, the surface energy exhibits a Read-Shockley-type behavior for small misorientation angles, scaling as $\theta|\log\theta|$. The regularized functionals are applicable to grain growth simulation and the reconstruction of grain boundaries from imaging data.

Title: Exciton coherence propagation measured with non-local four-wave mixing micro-spectroscopy
Authors: Mateusz Raczyński, Amadeusz Dydniański, Karolina Ewa Połczyńska, Gabriela Szwed, Adam Szczerba, Jin-Woo Jung, Gilles Nogues, Wolfgang Langbein, Piotr Kossacki, Wojciech Pacuski, Jacek Kasprzak
Abstract: Coherence transfer is a multi-disciplinary topic of interest, including chemistry, biology and physics. In quantum technologies, achieving non-local coherent coupling between solid-state qubits is of the utmost importance. Here, we demonstrate that excitons - i.e. electron-hole pairs bound by the Coulomb force within a quantum well - can act as a medium for mesoscopic optical coherence transfer in semiconductors. To this end, we use a femtosecond laser pulse to resonantly generate excitons within the light cone. These excitons can then either recombine radiatively or scatter out of the light cone, gaining an in-plane momentum in the process. In samples without disorder, such as the CdTe quantum wells used here, the resulting fast excitons can diffuse over mesoscopic distances before recombining radiatively. Using coherent nonlinear micro-spectroscopy, we carry out exciton time-of-flight measurements. Specifically, we monitor the spatio-temporal propagation of launched exciton wave packets, selectively observing their coherence or density on a scale of up to 10$\,\mu$m. Our proof-of-principle experiment demonstrates that free excitons inherit a phase modulation from the optical pulsed excitation and can generate coherent links within excitonic circuits, offerring a higher level of miniaturisation and compactness than photonic or polaritonic architectures.

Title: Non Markovian Corrections to Tegmark's Decoherence Bound in Biological Media
Authors: Ramandeep Dewan
Abstract: Tegmark's widely cited bound on decoherence times in biological systems is derived under the assumption of a delta correlated, memoryless environment. In this work we show that any finite environmental memory universally induces quadratic short time decoherence, in validating the exponential decay law at early times. For an Ornstein Uhlenbeck environment we derive a closed non markovian expression for the coherence dynamics and obtain a de-coherence time that scales as the square root of the bath correlation time. In the singular limit of vanishing bath memory our result reduces exactly to Tegmark's bound. Numerical simulations based on an exact pseudomode mapping confirm the predicted scaling. These findings demonstrate that Tegmark's result applies only in the Markovian limit and does not rule out mesoscopic quantum coherence in structured biological media.

Title: Measurement-based acceleration of optical computations
Authors: I. V. Vovchenko, A. A. Zyablovsky, A. A. Pukhov, E. S. Andrianov
Abstract: Analog coprocessors are intensively developing nowadays with the aim to optimize energy computations of neural networks. In this work we focus on the possibility of using detection of collective oscillations in optical systems for computational purposes. We show that in a system of coupled resonators, collective oscillations can be used to implement matrix-vector multiplication. The matrix is formed by the coupling constants between the resonators, and the input vector is formed by the initial occupancies of the involved modes. The frequency of the collective oscillations is growing with the number of the involved modes, similarly to Rabi oscillations. The time needed for their detection, i.e., averaging, decreases with an increase in the input vector dimension. We discuss the limitations imposed on parallel computation in the system by restriction of the allowed optical frequency band.

Title: Computing quantum magic of state vectors
Authors: Piotr Sierant, Jofre Vallès-Muns, Artur Garcia-Saez
Abstract: Non-stabilizerness, also known as ``magic,'' quantifies how far a quantum state departs from the stabilizer set. It is a central resource behind quantum advantage and a useful probe of the complexity of many-body quantum states. Yet standard magic quantifiers, such as the stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE) for qubits and the mana for qutrits, are costly to evaluate numerically, with the computational complexity growing rapidly with the number $N$ of qudits. Here we introduce efficient, numerically exact algorithms that exploit the fast Hadamard transform to compute the SRE for qubits ($d=2$) and the mana for qutrits ($d=3$) for pure states given as state vectors. Our methods reduce the runtime to $O(N d^{2N})$, an exponential improvement over the naive $O(d^{3N})$ scaling, while exposing substantial parallelism and enabling GPU acceleration. We further show how to combine the fast Hadamard transform with Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the SRE of state vectors, and we extend the approach to compute the mana of mixed states. All algorithms are implemented in the open-source Julia package this http URL, which provides a high-performance, GPU-enabled toolbox for computing SRE and mana. The package, together with the methods developed in this work, offers a practical route to large-scale numerical studies of magic in quantum many-body systems.

Title: Vicsek Model Meets DBSCAN: Cluster Phases in the Vicsek Model
Authors: Hideyuki Miyahara, Hyu Yoneki, Tsuyoshi Mizohata, Vwani Roychowdhury
Abstract: The Vicsek model, which was originally proposed to explain the dynamics of bird flocking, exhibits a phase transition with respect to the absolute value of the mean velocity. Although clusters of agents can be easily observed via numerical simulations of the Vicsek model, qualitative studies are lacking. We study the clustering structure of the Vicsek model by applying DBSCAN, a recently-introduced clustering algorithm, and report that the Vicsek model shows a phase transition with respect to the number of clusters: from O(N) to O(1), with N being the number of agents, when increasing the magnitude of noise for a fixed radius that specifies the interaction of the Vicsek model. We also report that the combination of the order parameter proposed by Vicsek et al. and the number of clusters defines at least four phases of the Vicsek model.

Title: BEC with two ground-state filling rates for BCS Cooper-pairs
Authors: Juan José Valencia Acevedo, Miguel Ángel Solís Atala
Abstract: We report the effects on the thermodynamic properties of a 3D Bose gas caused by a temperature dependent energy gap between the ground state and the first excited state of the energy spectrum of the particles constituting the Bose gas which behaves like an ideal Bose gas when the gap is absent but whose properties are very different when it is present. Explicit formulae are given for the critical temperature, the condensate fraction, the internal energy and the isochoric specific heat, which are calculated for three different gaps which abruptly go to zero at a temperature $T_B$, as well as for the damped counterparts with a smoothed drop to zero. In particular, for the undamped BCS (Bardeen, Cooper and Schrieffer) gap it is observed that the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) critical temperature $T_c$ is equal to that of the ideal Bose gas $T_0$, for every $T_B \leq T_0$; surprisingly, the condensate fraction presents two different filling rates of the ground state, one at $T_c = T_0$ and another with a higher rate at $T_B < T_0$, suggesting something like a {\it two-step} BEC; also, its specific heat shows a finite jump at $T_c$ and a divergence at $T_B$ with a critical exponent $\alpha=1/2$, which is inherited from the divergence of the temperature derivative of the BCS gap at $T_B$.

Title: Codimension-Two Spiral Spin-Liquid in the Effective Honeycomb-Lattice Compound Cs$_3$Fe$_2$Cl$_9$
Authors: Shang Gao, Chris Pasco, Otkur Omar, Qiang Zhang, Daniel M. Pajerowski, Feng Ye, Matthias Frontzek, Andrew F. May, Matthew B. Stone, Andrew D. Christianson
Abstract: A codimension-two spiral spin-liquid is a correlated paramagnetic state with one-dimensional ground state degeneracy hosted within a three-dimensional lattice. Here, via neutron scattering experiments and numerical simulations, we establish the existence of a codimension-two spiral spin-liquid in the effective honeycomb-lattice compound Cs$_3$Fe$_2$Cl$_9$, which demonstrates a novel path to spiral spin-liquids by overcoming the long-standing impediment of weak further-neighbor interactions. In the long-range ordered regime, competing spiral and spin density wave orders emerge as a function of applied magnetic field, among which a possible order-by-disorder transition is identified.

Title: High-Ti induced planar-fault transformation toward superlattice extrinsic stacking faults and microtwins in crept CoNi-based superalloys
Authors: Zhida Liang, Xiang Xu, Fengxian Liu, Xi Zhang, Xin Liu, Mingyang Zhang, Jing Zhang, Li Wang, Florian Pyczak, Yinan Cui
Abstract: Controlling planar fault shearing mechanisms is key for improving the high-temperature creep performance of gamma prime-strengthened high-temperature superalloys. This work examines how the Ti concentration in L12-strengthened CoNi-based alloys affects planar fault formation during creep. Interrupted compressive creep tests were conducted at 1223 K under air with a constant load stress of 241 MPa. We found, for the first time, that high Ti additions shift the dominant gamma prime shearing mode from antiphase boundaries (APBs) in Ti-free and low-Ti alloys to superlattice extrinsic stacking faults (SESFs). Systematic ab initio calculations show that in high-Ti alloys, the elevated APB energy renders APB-shearing mode unfavorable. Nevertheless, the SESF energy decreases relative to that in low-Ti compositions, and an increased ratio of complex intrinsic stacking fault (CISF) to SESF energy promote the transformation of high-energy CISFs into lower-energy SESFs. Chemical analysis using scanning transmission electron microscopy combined with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy further reveals that, SESFs in high-Ti alloys are enriched in Ti, Mo and W, yet no grid-like ordering is observed. Together with the ab initio calculations, Mo and W additions in high Ti alloys could facilitate the transformation from L12 structure to low-energy D024 structure, indicating Mo and W segregation along SESFs is energetically favourable. Furthermore, the successive SESF thickening facilitates microtwinning in the absence of D024 ordering along SESFs, as an additional big carrier for creep strain. These new findings clarify the role of Ti in controlling planar fault shearing mechanisms, providing new insights for optimizing the creep performance of next-generation CoNi-based superalloys.

Title: Machine-learning Guided Search for Phonon-mediated Superconductivity in Boron and Carbon Compounds
Authors: Niraj K. Nepal, Lin-Lin Wang
Abstract: We present a workflow that iteratively combines \textit{ab-initio} calculations with a machine-learning (ML) guided search for superconducting compounds with both dynamical stability and instability from imaginary phonon modes, the latter of which have been largely overlooked in previous studies. Electron-phonon coupling (EPC) properties and critical temperature (T$_c$) of 417 boron, carbon, and borocarbide compounds have been calculated with density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) and isotropic Eliashberg approximation. Our study addresses T$_c$ convergence of Brillouin zone sampling with an ansatz test, stabilizing imaginary phonon modes for significant EPC contributions and comparing performance of two ML models especially when including compounds of dynamical instability. We predict a few promising superconducting compounds with formation energy just above the ground state convex hull, such as Ca$_5$B$_3$N$_6$ (35 K), TaNbC$_2$ (28.4 K), Nb$_3$B$_3$C (16.4 K), Y$_2$B$_3$C$_2$ (4.0 K), Pd$_3$CaB (7.0 K), MoRuB$_2$ (15.6 K), RuVB$_2$ (15.0 K), RuSc$_3$C$_4$ (6.6 K) among others.

Title: Chiral superconductivity from parent Chern band and its non-Abelian generalization
Authors: Yan-Qi Wang, Zhi-Qiang Gao, Hui Yang
Abstract: We propose a minimal model starting from a parent Chern band with quartic dispersion that can describe the spin-valley polarized electrons in rhombohedral tetralayer graphene. The interplay between repulsive and attractive interactions on top of that parent Chern band is studied. We conduct standard self-consistent mean-field calculations, and find a rich phase diagram that consists of metal, quantum anomalous Hall crystal, chiral topological superconductor, as well as trivial gapped Bose--Einstein condensate. In particular, there exists a topological phase transition from the chiral superconductor to the Bose--Einstein condensate at zero temperature. Motivated by the recent experimental and theoretical studies of composite Fermi liquid in rhombohedral stacked multilayer graphene, we further generalize the physical electron model to its composite fermion counterpart based on a field theory analysis. The chiral superconductor phase of the composite fermion becomes the nonabelian Moore--Read quantum Hall phase. We argue that a chiral (pseudo-)spin liquid phase can emerge in the vicinity of this Moore--Read quantum Hall phase. Our work suggests rhombohedral multilayer graphene as a potential platform for rich correlated topological phases.

Title: Two-Dimensional Active Brownian Particles Crossing a Parabolic Barrier: Finite Rectangular Domain with Absorbing Boundary Conditions
Authors: Michele Caraglio
Abstract: We solve the time-dependent Fokker-Planck equation for a two-dimensional active Brownian particle exploring a rectangular domain with absorbing boundary and in the presence of a parabolic barrier along one direction. By taking those of a passive Brownian particle as basis states and dealing with the activity as a perturbation, we provide a matrix representation of the Fokker-Planck operator and express the propagator in terms of the perturbed eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. Our solution also allows us to obtain the survival probability and the first-passage-time distribution. The non-equilibrium character of the dynamics induces a strong dependence of the latter quantities on the particle's activity, while the rotational diffusivity influences them to a minor extent.

Title: Demonstrating Electrochemical CO$_2$ Capture on Redox-Active Metal-Organic Frameworks

Abstract: Addressing climate change calls for action to control CO$_2$ pollution. Direct air and ocean capture offer a solution to this challenge. Making carbon capture competitive with alternatives, such as forestation and mineralisation, requires fundamentally novel approaches and ideas. One such approach is electrosorption, which is currently limited by the availability of suitable electrosorbents. In this work, we introduce a metal-organic copper-2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahydroxytriphenylene (Cu$_3$(HHTP)$_2$) metal-organic framework (MOF) that can act as electrosorbent for CO$_2$ capture, thereby expanding the palette of materials that can be used for this process. Cu$_3$(HHTP)$_2$ is the first MOF to switch its ability to capture and release CO$_2$ in aqueous electrolytes. By using cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) analysis, and differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS), we demonstrate reversible CO$_2$ electrosorption. Based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we provide atomistic insights into the mechanism of electrosorption and conclude that efficient CO$_2$ capture is facilitated by a combination of redox-active copper atom and aromatic HHTP ligand within Cu3(HHTP)2. By showcasing the applicability of Cu$_3$(HHTP)$_2$ -- with a CO$_2$ capacity of 2 mmol g$^{-1}$ and an adsorption enthalpy of -20 kJ mol$^{-1}$ - this study encourages further exploration of conductive redox-active MOFs in the search for superior CO$_2$ electrosorbents.

Title: Color symmetry and ferromagnetism in Potts spin glass
Authors: Hong-Bin Chen
Abstract: We consider the Potts spin glass with additional ferromagnetic interaction parametrized by $t$. It has long been observed that the Potts color symmetry breaking for the spin glass order parameter is closely related to the ferromagnetic phase transition. To clarify this, we identify a single critical value $t_\mathrm{c}$, which marks the onset of both color symmetry breaking and the transition to ferromagnetism.

Title: Universal activated aging and weak ergodicity breaking in spin and structural glasses
Authors: Bin Li, Deng Pan, Ting Qu, Yuliang Jin
Abstract: Glasses possess complex energy landscapes and exhibit non-equilibrium aging dynamics. Here, we propose a generalized trap model for activated aging based on a key static property of the energy landscape: the distribution of energy barriers. Our theory predicts that, upon cooling, weak ergodicity breaking (WEB) in quenching dynamics occurs prior to strong ergodicity breaking in equilibrium dynamics. Furthermore, the theory indicates that the characteristic size of activation clusters can be deduced from the logarithmic decay of the time-correlation function. We rigorously test the model's assumptions and predictions using the simplest spin glass model - the random energy model. The predicted aging behavior is also universally observed in paradigmatic structural glasses, including the Weeks-Chandler-Andersen (WCA) model and amorphous silica. Remarkably, applying our framework to the WCA model allows us to extract a static length from the non equilibrium dynamics, extending its observable growth range from a mere factor of 2-3 to a full order of magnitude and providing supportive evidence for the random first-order transition scenario. Finally, we propose a unified ergodic-WEB phase diagram for aging dynamics in general glassy systems.

Title: Three-dimensional quantum anomalous Hall effect in Weyl semimetals
Authors: Zhi-Qiang Zhang, Yu-Hang Li, Ming Lu, Hongfang Liu, Hailong Li, Hua Jiang, X. C. Xie
Abstract: The quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) is a quantum phenomenon in which a two-dimensional system exhibits a quantized Hall resistance $h/e^2$ in the absence of magnetic field, where $h$ is the Planck constant and $e$ is the electron charge. In this work, we extend this novel phase to three dimensions and thus propose a three-dimensional QAHE exhibiting richer and more versatile transport behaviors. We first confirm this three-dimensional QAHE through the quantized Chern number, then establish its bulk-boundary correspondence, and finally reaffirm it via the distinctive transport properties. Remarkably, we find that the three-dimensional QAHE hosts two chiral surface states along one spatial direction while a pair of chiral hinge states along another direction, and the location of the hinge states depends sensitively on the Fermi energy. These two types of boundary states are further connected through a perpendicular chiral surface states, whose chirality is also Fermi energy dependent. Consequently, depending on the transport direction, its Hall resistance can quantize to $0$, $h/e^2$, or $\pm h/e^2$ when the Fermi energy is tuned across the charge neutral point. This three-dimensional QAHE not only fill the gap in the Hall effect family but also holds significant potentials in device applications such as in-memory computing.

Title: The Impact of Ionic Anharmonicity on Superconductivity in Metal-Stuffed B-C Clathrates
Authors: Wenbo Zhao, Ying Sun, Jiaxiang Li, Peng Yuan, Toshiaki Iitaka, Xin Zhong, Hefei Li, Yue-Wen Fang, Hanyu Liu, Ion Errea, Yu Xie
Abstract: Metal-stuffed B$-$C compounds with sodalite clathrate structure have captured increasing attention due to their predicted exceptional superconductivity above liquid nitrogen temperature at ambient pressure. However, by neglecting the quantum lattice anharmonicity, the existing studies may result in an incomplete understanding of such a lightweight system. Here, using state-of-the-art ab initio methods incorporating quantum effects and machine learning potentials, we revisit the properties of a series of $XY$$\text{B}_{6}\text{C}_{6}$ clathrates where $X$ and $Y$ are metals. Our findings show that ionic quantum and anharmonic effects can harden the $E_g$ and $E_u$ vibrational modes, enabling the dynamical stability of 15 materials previously considered unstable in the harmonic approximation, including materials with previously unreported ($XY$)$^{1+}$ state, which is demonstrated here to be crucial to reach high critical temperatures. Further calculations based on the anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg equation demonstrate that the $T_\text{c}$ values for KRb$\text{B}_{6}\text{C}_{6}$ and Rb$\text{B}_{3}\text{C}_{3}$ among these stabilized compounds are 102 and 115 K at 0 and 15 GPa, respectively, both being higher than $T_\text{c}$ of 92 K of KPb$\text{B}_{6}\text{C}_{6}$ at the anharmonic level. These record-high $T_\text{c}$ values, surpassing liquid nitrogen temperatures, emphasize the importance of anharmonic effects in stabilizing B-C clathrates with large electron-phonon coupling strength and advancing the search for high-$T_\text{c}$ superconductivity at (near) ambient pressure.

Title: Aspects of the normal state resistivity of cuprate superconductors Bi2201, Tl2201 and Hg1201
Authors: Samantha Shears, Michael Arciniaga, B Sriram Shastry
Abstract: Planar normal state resistivity data from two families of hole doped single layer cuprate superconductors $Bi2201$ (Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CuO$_{6+x}$) and $Tl2201$ (Tl$_2$Ba$_2$CuO$_{6+x}$) are calculated using the extremely correlated Fermi liquid theory (ECFL). This theory was recently employed for understanding the three families of single layer cuprate superconductors LSCO, BSLCO and NCCO. Adding these two systems accounts for essentially all single layer compounds where data is available for a range of densities and temperatures. The added case of $Bi2201$ is of particular interest since it was the original system where the almost linear in temperature resistivity was reported in 1990, and has been followed up by a systematic doping analysis only recently in 2022. The $Tl2201$ system has two distinct set of band parameters that fit the same Fermi surface, providing new challenges and insights into the ECFL theory.

Title: 3D Electron Diffraction - The Missing Slice for a Complete Nanoscale Analysis of Organic Solar Cells in TEM
Authors: Irene Kraus, Mingjian Wu, Stefanie Rechberger, Johannes Will, Santanu Maiti, Konstantin Dengel, Andreas Kuhlmann, Marten Huck, Larry Lüer, Florian Bertram, Hans-Georg Steinrück, Tobias Unruh, Christoph J. Brabec, Erdmann Spiecker
Abstract: Optimizing the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs) hinges on a comprehensive understanding of their nanostructures, yet traditional characterization methods often fall short, delivering incomplete structural snapshots. We introduce elastically filtered 3D Electron Diffraction (3D ED) as a ground-breaking technique bridging full reciprocal- and real-space structural analysis within a single transmission electron microscope (TEM). Using solvent-vapor annealed DRCN5T:PC71BM, 3D ED reproduces key structural parameters from GIWAXS including lattice spacings, coherence lengths, and mosaicity, while uniquely delivering true in-plane access and direct registration with high-resolution imaging, diffraction imaging and nano-spectroscopy on the same sample. A low-dose, distributed tilt strategy plus energy filtering yields high signal-to-background below damage thresholds. Extension to a second archetypal blend (P3HT:PC71BM; annealing evolution) demonstrates generality. Our findings underscore the transformative potential of 3D ED, particularly in analysing beam-sensitive organic thin films. This paves the way for new avenues in advanced correlative structural characterization of OSCs and holds potential for application to a multitude of other nanostructured materials.

Abstract: Numerical evidence for superconductivity in the single-band Hubbard model is elusive or ambiguous despite extensive study, raising the question of whether the single-band Hubbard model is a faithful low energy effective model for cuprates, and whether explicitly including the oxygen ions will recover the properties necessary for a superconducting transition. Here we show, by using numerically exact determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) simulations of the doped Emery model, that while the single-band model exhibits strikingly T-linear resistivity, the three-band model crosses the resistivity of the single-band model from above, indicating a crossover to a more metallic transport regime. The enhanced conductivity is mainly contributed by a steep increase in the diffusivity of the three-band model at the crossover, suggesting that three-band transport is more coherent than single-band transport at lower temperatures. Below the same crossover temperature in the three-band model, the pair-field susceptibility increases more steeply than at higher temperatures or when compared to the single-band model. This suggests a possible connection between superconductivity and coherent transport, and further implies that coherent transport might be necessary for a model to capture the high-temperature superconductivity observed in hole-doped cuprates.

Title: Frustration-free free fermions and beyond
Authors: Rintaro Masaoka, Seishiro Ono, Hoi Chun Po, Haruki Watanabe
Abstract: Frustration-free Hamiltonians provide pivotal models for understanding quantum many-body systems. In this paper, we establish a general framework for frustration-free fermionic systems. First, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for a free fermion model to be frustration-free. In the case of translation-invariant, noninteracting systems, we show that any band touching between the valence and conduction bands is at least quadratic. Furthermore, by extending the Gosset-Huang inequality to fermionic systems, we demonstrate that even in interacting and non-translation-invariant cases, the finite-size gap of gapless excitations scales as $O((\log L)^2/L^2)$, provided the ground-state correlation function exhibits a power-law decay. Our results provide a foundation for studying frustration-free fermionic systems, including flat-band ferromagnetism and $\eta$-pairing states.

Title: Frustration-free free fermions
Authors: Seishiro Ono, Rintaro Masaoka, Haruki Watanabe, Hoi Chun Po
Abstract: We develop a general theory of frustration-free free-fermion systems and derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for such Hamiltonians. Assuming locality and translation invariance, we find that any band touching between the valence and the conduction bands is always quadratic or softer, which rules out the possibility of describing Dirac and Weyl semimetals using frustration-free local Hamiltonians. We further construct a frustration-free free-fermion model on the honeycomb lattice and show that its density fluctuations acquire an anomalous gap originating from the diverging quantum metric associated with the quadratic band-touching points. Nevertheless, an $O(1/L^2)$ finite-size scaling of the charge-neutral excitation gap can be verified even in the presence of interactions, consistent with the more general results we derive in an accompanying work [arXiv:2503.12879].

Title: Observation of a generalized Gibbs ensemble in photonics
Authors: Alvise Bastianello, Alexey Tikan, Francois Copie, Stephane Randoux, Pierre Suret
Abstract: In generic classical and quantum many-body systems, where typically energy and particle number are the only conserved quantities, stationary states are described by thermal equilibrium. In contrast, integrable systems showcase an infinite hierarchy of conserved quantities that inhibits conventional thermalization, forcing relaxation to a Generalized Gibbs Ensemble (GGE) -- a concept first introduced in quantum many-body physics. In this study, we provide experimental evidence for the emergence of a GGE in a photonic system. By investigating partially coherent waves propagating in a normal dispersion optical fiber, governed by the one-dimensional defocusing nonlinear Schroedinger equation, we directly measure the density of states of the spectral parameter (rapidity) to confirm the time invariance of the full set of conserved charges. We also observe the relaxation of optical power statistics to the GGE's theoretical prediction, obtained using the experimentally measured density of states. These complementary measurements unambiguously establish the formation of a GGE in our photonic platform, highlighting its potential as a powerful tool for probing many-body integrability and bridging classical and quantum integrable systems.

Title: Radiation-induced Instability of Organic-Inorganic Halide Perovskite Single Crystals
Authors: Ruitian Chen, Mingyu Xie, Tianyi Lyu, Jincong Pang, Lewei Zeng, Jiahui Zhang, Changjun Cheng, Renfei Feng, Guangda Niu, Jiang Tang, Yu Zou
Abstract: Organic-inorganic halide perovskites (OIHPs) are promising optoelectronic materials, but their instability under radiation environments restricts their durability and practical applications. Here we employ electron and synchrotron X-ray beams, individually, to investigate the radiation-induced instability of two types of OIHP single crystals (FAPbBr3 and MAPbBr3). Under the electron beam, we observe that 3-point star-style cracks grow on the surface of FAPbBr3, and bricklayer-style cracks are formed on the surface of MAPbBr3. Under the X-ray beam, a new composition without organic components appears in both FAPbBr3 and MAPbBr3. Such cracking and composition changes are attributed to the volatilization of organic components. We propose a volume-strain-based mechanism, in which the energy conversion results from the organic cation loss. Using nanoindentation, we reveal that beam radiations reduce the Youngs modulus and increase the hardness of both OIHPs. This study provides valuable insights into the structural and mechanical stabilities of OIHP single crystals in radiation environments.

Title: The microwave phase locking in Bloch transistor
Authors: Ilya Antonov, Rais Shaikhaidarov, Kyung Ho Kim, Dmitry Golubev, Sven Linzen, Evgeni V. Il'ichev, Vladimir N. Antonov, Oleg V. Astafiev
Abstract: We report on observation of two coherent quantum phenomena, the current quantization in the Josephson Junction (JJ) and the Aharonov-Casher effect. The synergy of two effects is seen as the phase locking of the JJ with the oscillating charge engaged by the microwaves (the current quantization), and a control of the phase locking phenomenon with the static charge of the gate electrode (the Aharonov-Casher effect). The experimental system consists of two coupled JJs in the regime of coherent quantum phase slip. When the microwave is applied, the quantized current plateaus appear on the I - V curve. The effect is dual to the Shapiro voltage steps in JJs. We modulate the quantized current with the static charge induced by the gate electrode. Conceptually, the system has the functionality of the Bloch Transistor: it can deliver gate-controlled quantized non-dissipative current to the quantum circuit.

Title: Microscopic theory of phonon polaritons and long wavelength dielectric response
Authors: Olle Hellman, Leeor Kronik
Abstract: We present a first-principles approach for calculating phonon-polariton dispersion relations. In this approach, phonon-photon interaction is described by quantization of a Hamiltonian that describes harmonic lattice vibrations coupled with the electromagnetic field inside the material. All Hamiltonian parameters are obtained from first-principles calculations, with diagonalization leading to non-interacting polariton quasiparticles. This method naturally includes retardation effects and resolves non-analytical behavior and ambiguities in phonon frequencies at the Brillouin zone center, especially in non-cubic and optically anisotropic materials. Furthermore, by incorporating higher-order terms in the Hamiltonian, we also account for quasiparticle interactions and spectral broadening. Specifically, we show how anharmonic effects in phonon polaritons lead to a dielectric response that challenges traditional models. The accuracy and consequences of the approach are demonstrated on GaP and GaN as harmonic test systems and PbTe and $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ as anharmonic test systems.

Title: Inferring charge-noise source locations from correlations in spin qubits
Authors: Juan S. Rojas-Arias, Akito Noiri, Jun Yoneda, Peter Stano, Takashi Nakajima, Kenta Takeda, Takashi Kobayashi, Giordano Scappucci, Seigo Tarucha, Daniel Loss
Abstract: We investigate low-frequency noise in a spin-qubit device made in isotopically purified Si/Si-Ge. Observing sizable cross-correlations among energy fluctuations of different qubits, we conclude that these fluctuations are dominated by charge noise. At low frequencies, the noise spectra are not well described by a power law; instead, they reveal the presence of a few individual two-level fluctuators (TLFs). We demonstrate that the noise cross-correlations allow one to get information on the spatial location of such individual TLFs.

Title: Engineering Altermagnetism via Layer Shifts and Spin Order in Bilayer MnPS$_3$
Authors: J. W. González, T. Brumme, E. Suárez Morell, A. M. León
Abstract: Altermagnetic materials combine compensated magnetic order with momentum-dependent spin splitting, offering a fundamentally new route for spintronic functionality beyond conventional ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. While most studies have focused on three-dimensional compounds, the emergence of altermagnetism in few-layer two-dimensional materials remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that bilayer MnPS$_3$, a prototypical 2D van der Waals magnet, can host stacking-induced altermagnetic phases. Using density-functional theory and spin-Laue symmetry analysis, we show that interlayer spin alignment and lateral displacement act as coupled symmetry control parameters that switch the system between Type II (collinear AFM) and Type III (altermagnetic) phases. Our systematic exploration reveals how specific stacking geometries enable momentum-dependent spin polarization without net magnetization, even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. These results establish stacking engineering as a powerful, purely structural route for designing tunable altermagnetic states in 2D magnets, opening pathways toward symmetry-driven spintronic and magnetoelectronic devices.

Title: Phase transitions induced by resonant light: a phenomenological approach
Authors: A. Kudlis, L. S. Ricco, H. Sigurðsson, I. A. Shelykh
Abstract: We present a phenomenological framework to describe a subclass of light-induced phase transitions (LIPTs) in condensed matter systems, specifically those mediated by the resonant generation of excitons. Our approach extends the classical Landau theory by introducing dynamic coupling between the system's order parameter and complex excitonic fields, along with Langevin-type forces that drive the system toward states of minimal free energy. The model is applied in the context of all-optical resonant magnetization switching in two-dimensional magnetic materials, particularly reproducing the experimental findings for reverse magnetization by all-optical means for a monolayer CrI$_3$. Our phenomenological model can be applied to other systems characterized by an order parameter and excitonic fields created through resonant light, offering versatility and potential to guide future experimental and theoretical studies in LIPT phenomena.

Title: Rigid spheres moving through soft solids
Authors: Tom Mullin, Tommaso Pettinari, Joshua A. Dijksman
Abstract: We present the results of an experimental investigation into buoyant rigid spheres rising through highly concentrated collections of hydrated hydrogel particles. The volume fraction of particles is such that the mechanical properties of the material are intermediate between a very viscous fluid and a soft solid. Despite the established time dependent, non-Newtonian character of hydrogels, we find that when the surface of the material is free, an immersed buoyant sphere rises with a constant speed. The effects of the motion are observed to be highly localized around the sphere. When the stress exerted on the material is changed by varying the mass of the sphere, its terminal velocity is found to depend exponentially on its buoyancy. Qualitatively distinct behavior is found when a solid lid is placed on the surface of the material. In this case, a seemingly thixotropic, sublinear time-dependent motion is found. It is observed that linear motion of the sphere is accompanied by flow at the surface of the material whereas fluid movement is suppressed when a lid is present. We use these observations to provide a hypothesis which links the exponential stress dependence of the rheology of the material to the effects of the boundary conditions on the kinematics of the intruder.

Title: Emergent QED$_3$ at the bosonic Laughlin state to superfluid transition
Authors: Taige Wang, Xue-Yang Song, Michael P. Zaletel, T. Senthil
Abstract: Quantum phase transitions between topologically ordered and symmetry-broken phases lie beyond Landau theory. A prime example is the conjectured continuous transition from the bosonic $\nu = 1/2$ Laughlin state to a superfluid, proposed to be governed by a QED$_3$--Chern--Simons (CS) critical point whose stability remains uncertain. We study half-filled bosons in the lowest Landau level subject to a lattice potential. Infinite-cylinder DMRG reveals a single continuous Laughlin--to--superfluid transition. Adiabatic flux insertion collapses the many-body gap and exposes massless Dirac quasiparticles, while momentum-resolved correlation lengths show that three lattice-related density modes share the same critical exponent, evidencing an emergent $SO(3)$ symmetry. The joint appearance of Dirac dispersion and symmetry enlargement provides microscopic support for a stable QED$_3$--CS fixed point. Our numerical strategy also offers a blueprint for exploring Landau-forbidden transitions in fractional Chern insulators and composite Fermi liquids realised in moire and cold-atom systems.

Title: Conformable Scaling and Critical Dynamics: A Unified Framework for Phase Transitions
Authors: José Weberszpil, Ralf Metzler
Abstract: We investigate the application of conformable derivatives to model critical phenomena near continuous phase transitions. By incorporating a deformation parameter into the differential structure, we derive unified expressions for thermodynamic observables such as heat capacity, magnetization, susceptibility, and coherence length, each exhibiting power-law behavior near the critical temperature. The conformable derivative framework naturally embeds scale invariance and critical slowing down into the dynamics without resorting to fully nonlocal fractional calculus. Modified Ginzburg-Landau equations are constructed to model superconducting transitions, leading to analytical expressions for the order parameter and London penetration depth. Experimental data from niobium confirm the model's applicability, showing excellent fits and capturing asymmetric scaling behavior around Tc. This work offers a bridge between classical mean-field theory and generalized scaling frameworks, with implications for both theoretical modeling and experimental analysis.

Title: Three-boson scattering hypervolume for a nonzero orbital angular momentum
Authors: Pui In Ip, Shina Tan
Abstract: We analyze the zero energy collision of three identical bosons in the same internal state with total orbital angular momentum $L=2$, assuming short range interactions. By solving the Schrödinger equation asymptotically, we derive two expansions of the wave function when three bosons are far apart or a pair of bosons and the third boson are far apart. The scattering hypervolume $D$ is defined for this collision. Unlike the scattering hypervolume defined by one of us in 2008, whose dimension is length to the fourth power, the dimension of $D$ studied in the present paper is length to the eighth power. We then derive the expression of $D$ when the interaction potentials are weak, using the Born's expansion. We also calculate the energy shift of such three bosons with three different momenta $\hbar \mathbf{k_{1}}$, $\hbar\mathbf{k_{2}}$ and $\hbar\mathbf{k_{3}}$ in a large periodic box. The obtained energy shift depends on $D^{(0)}/\Omega^{2}$ and $D/\Omega^{2}$, where $D^{(0)}$ is the three-body scattering hypervolume defined for the three-body $L=0$ collision and $\Omega$ is the volume of the periodic box. We also calculate the contribution of $D$ to the three-body T-matrix element for low-energy collisions. We then calculate the shift of the energy and the three-body recombination rate due to $D^{(0)}$ and $D$ in the dilute homogeneous Bose gas. The contribution to the three-body recombination rate constant from $D$ is proportional to $T^2$ if the temperature $T$ is much larger than the quantum degeneracy temperature but still much lower than the temperature scale at which the thermal de Broglie wave length becomes comparable to the physical range of interaction.

Title: Composite Fermion Theory of Fractional Chern Insulator Stability
Authors: Xiaodong Hu, Ying Ran, Di Xiao
Abstract: We develop a mean-field theory of the stability of fractional Chern insulators based on the dipole picture of composite fermions (CFs). We construct CFs by binding vortices to Bloch electrons and derive a CF single-particle Hamiltonian that describes a Hofstadter problem in the enlarged CF Hilbert space, with the trace-condition term emerging naturally in the small-$q$ limit as part of the CF Hamiltonian. Going beyond the small-$q$ limit, we apply our theory to twisted MoTe$_2$ and calculate its CF band structures. The resulting CF phase diagram matches closely with that from exact diagonalization, and the projected many-body wavefunctions achieve exceptionally high overlaps with the latter. Our theory provides both a microscopic understanding and a computationally efficient tool for identifying fractional Chern insulators.

Title: Observe novel tricritical phenomena in self-organized Fermi gas induced by higher order Fermi surface nesting
Authors: Yilun Xu, Feng-Xiao Sun, Qiongyi He
Abstract: Cold atom systems in optical lattices have long been recognized as an ideal platform for bridging condense matter physics and quantum optics. Here, we investigate the 1D fermionic superradiance in an optical lattice, and observe novel tricritical phenomena and multistability in finite-temperature cases. As a starting point, which can be analytically calculated, we compare the 1D and 2D Fermi gases in zero-temperature limit. It turns out that the tricritical point originates from the higher-order Fermi surface nesting (FSN), and the infrared divergence in 1D systems is absent in 2D cases. When extending to finite-temperature cases, our numerical results reveal that both quantum- and classical-type trcritical phenomena can be observed simultaneously. Moreover, there exists an optimal temperature for observing superradiance. This work provides a new approach to understanding the relation between quantum and classical phase transitions.

Title: Probing the limits of effective temperature consistency in actively driven systems
Authors: Dima Boriskovsky, Rémi Goerlich, Benjamin Lindner, Yael Roichman
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic properties of a single inertial probe driven into a nonequilibrium steady-state by random collisions with self-propelled active walkers. The probe and walkers are confined within a gravitational harmonic potential. We evaluate the robustness of the effective temperature concept in this active system by comparing values of distinct, independently motivated definitions: a generalized fluctuation-dissipation relation, a kinetic temperature, and a work fluctuation relation. Our experiments reveal that, under specific conditions, these independent measurements yield a remarkably consistent effective temperature over a wide range of system configurations. Furthermore, we also identify regimes where this consistency breaks down, which delineates the fundamental limits of extending equilibrium-like thermodynamic concepts to athermal, actively driven systems.

Title: Spin ladder quantum simulators from spin-orbit-coupled quantum dot spin qubits
Authors: Yang-Zhi Chou, Sankar Das Sarma
Abstract: Motivated by the recent Ge hole spin qubit experiments, we construct and study a two-leg spin ladder from a quantum dot array with spin-orbit couplings (SOCs), aiming to uncover the many-body phase diagrams and provide concrete guidance for the Ge hole spin qubit experiments. The spin ladder is described by an unprecedented, complex spin Hamiltonian, which contains antiferromagnetic Heisenberg exchange, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM), and anisotropic exchange interactions. We analyze the spin ladder Hamiltonian in two complementary situations, the strong rung coupling limit and the weak rung coupling limit. In the strong rung coupling limit, we systematically construct effective spin-1/2 chain models, connecting the well-studied one-dimensional spin models and providing a recipe for Hamiltonian engineering. It is worth emphasizing that effective DM interactions can be completely turned off while the microscopic DM interactions are generically inevitable. Moreover, the staggered DM interactions, which are not possible in the microscopic spin model, can also be realized in the effective spin-1/2 model. In the weak rung coupling limit, we employ Abelian bosonization and Luther-Emery fermionization, uncovering a multitude of phases. Several commensurate-incommensurate transitions are driven by both the longitudinal magnetic field and the DM interactions in the legs (chains). Remarkably, the low-energy phase diagrams show strong dependence in the DM interaction, providing a concrete way to identify the strength of SOC in the experiments. Our work bridges quantum many-body theory and spin qubit device physics, establishing spin ladders made of spin-orbit-coupled quantum dots as a promising platform for engineering exotic spin models, constructing quantum many-body states, and enabling programmable quantum computations.

Title: Average weighted ratio of consecutive level spacings for infinite-dimensional orthogonal random matrices
Authors: Wouter Buijsman
Abstract: The onset of quantum ergodicity is often quantified by the average ratio of consecutive level spacings. The reference values for ergodic quantum systems have been obtained numerically from the spectra of large but finite-dimensional random matrices. This work introduces a weighted ratio of consecutive level spacings, having the propery that the average can be computed numerically for random matrices of infinite dimension. A Painlevé differential equation is solved numerically in order to determine this average for infinite-dimensional orthogonal random matrices, thereby providing a reference value for ergodic quantum systems obeying time-reversal symmetry (provided that the time-reversal operator squares to the identity matrix). A Wigner surmise-inspired analytical calculation is found to yield a qualitatively accurate picture for the statistics of high-dimensional random matrices from each of the symmetry classes. For Poissonian level statistics, a significantly different average is found, indicating that the average weighted ratio of consecutive level spacings can be used as a probe for quantum ergodicity.

Title: Scalable hybrid quantum Monte Carlo simulation of U(1) gauge field coupled to fermions on GPU
Authors: Kexin Feng, Chuang Chen, Zi Yang Meng
Abstract: We develop a GPU-accelerated hybrid quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm to solve the fundamental yet difficult problem of $U(1)$ gauge field coupled to fermions, which gives rise to a $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state under the description of (2+1)d quantum electrodynamics QED$_3$. The algorithm renders a good acceptance rate and, more importantly, nearly linear space-time volume scaling in computational complexity $O(N_{\tau} V_s)$, where $N_\tau$ is the imaginary time dimension and $V_s$ is spatial volume, which is much more efficient than determinant QMC with scaling behavior of $O(N_\tau V_s^3)$. Such acceleration is achieved via a collection of technical improvements, including (i) the design of the efficient problem-specific preconditioner, (ii) customized CUDA kernel for matrix-vector multiplication, and (iii) CUDA Graph implementation on the GPU. These advances allow us to simulate the $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state with unprecedentedly large system sizes, which is up to $N_\tau\times L\times L = 660\times66\times66$, and reveal its novel properties. With these technical improvements, we see the asymptotic convergence in the scaling dimensions of various fermion bilinear operators and the conserved current operator when approaching the thermodynamic limit. The scaling dimensions find good agreement with field-theoretical expectation, which provides supporting evidence for the conformal nature of the $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state in the QED$_3$. Our technical advancements open an avenue to study the Dirac spin liquid state and its transition towards symmetry-breaking phases at larger system sizes and with less computational burden.

Title: Fermi sea topology and boundary geometry for free particles in one- and two-dimensional lattices
Authors: Guillermo R. Zemba
Abstract: Free gasses of spinless fermions moving on a lattice-symmetric geometric background are considered. Their topological properties at zero temperature can be used to classify their Fermi seas and associated boundaries. The flat orbifolds ${\Rb}^{d}/\Gamma$, where $\Gamma$ is the crystallographic group of symmetry in $d$-dimensional momentum space, are used to accomplish this task. Two topological classes exist for $d=1$: an interval, which is identified as a conductor, and a circumference, which corresponds to an insulator. The number of topological classes increases to 17 for $d=2$: 8 have the topology of a disk, that are generally recognized as conductors, and 4 correspond to a 2-sphere, matching insulators. Both sets eventually contain a finite number of conical singularities and reflection corners at the boundaries. The remaining cases in the listing relate to conductors (annulus, Möbius strip) and insulators (2-torus, real projective plane, Klein bottle). Examples that fall under this list are given, along with physical interpretations of the singularities. It is anticipated that the findings of this classification will be robust under perturbative interactions due to its topological character.

Title: Revisiting the Poor Man's Majoranas: The Spin-Exchange Induced Spillover Effect
Authors: J.E. Sanches, T.M. Sobreira, L.S. Ricco, M.S. Figueira, A.C. Seridonio
Abstract: We give a review on Poor Man's Majorana (PMM) modes, which are theoretically established in the minimal Kitaev chain implementation consisting of two grounded, spinless quantum dots (QDs) operating at the sweet spot condition, where electron cotunneling and crossed Andreev reflection amplitudes achieve precise balance. Particularly, we systematically review, within the Green's functions theoretical framework, the PMM hybridization dynamics under spin-exchange perturbations proposed by some of us in J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 37, 205601 (2025), which demonstrates a characteristic spatial delocalization when subjected to an exchange coupling $J$ mediated by a quantum spin $S$. This spin-exchange induced PMM spillover effect provides a spectroscopic protocol for determining the quantum statistics of $S$ through the emergent multi-level structure in the proximal QD's density of states. Our principal theoretical result establishes that the exchange interaction generates $2S+2$ ($2S+1$) satellite states symmetrically distributed about the zero-bias anomaly, serving as a definitive signature of bosonic (fermionic) spin statistics. As novelty, we demonstrate that multi-terminal environmental coupling induces significant suppression of the spin-exchange spillover mechanism. Under constrained variations of $J$, this effectively localizes the perturbed PMM within its host QD, preventing spatial hybridization with adjacent site. The absence of topological protection in this minimal Kitaev realization is strategically leveraged to: (i) Develop a novel spectroscopic technique for quantum spin characterization through PMM hybridization signatures; (ii) Propose the "environmentally induced protection", an engineered dissipative spectral stabilization for PMMs against exchange fluctuations in multi-terminal architectures.

Title: Quantum Mechanics of an Abrikosov Vortex in Nanofabricated Pinning Potential
Authors: Elmeri O. Rivasto
Abstract: A superconducting device is proposed for experimentally investigating whether an Abrikosov vortex can be modeled as a quantum mechanical quasiparticle. The design process of a type-II superconducting device capable of reliably pinning a single Abrikosov vortex is presented, creating a particle-in-a-box-like system. The proposed device consists of a cylindrically symmetric Nb film, 30 nm in diameter and 5 nm thick, with a 14 nm diameter artificial pinning center at its center. Time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau simulations indicate robust single-vortex pinning under an applied field of 6 T. The presumed quantized energy levels and associated quantum wavefunctions of the vortex quasiparticle are obtained by numerically solving the two-dimensional time-independent Schrödinger equation for this system. It is shown that distinguishing the ground and first excited states is experimentally feasible. Beyond fundamental physics studies, the application of the proposed device in cryogenic memory technology and quantum computing warrant further exploration.

Title: Thermoelectric power factors of defective scandium nitride nanostructures from first principles
Authors: Luigi Cigarini, Urszula Danuta Wdowik, Dominik Legut
Abstract: The thermoelectric properties of scandium nitride are strongly influenced by structural and electronic factors arising from defects and impurities. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which these microscopic features affect transport are not yet fully understood. Experiments show a large variability in the electronic transport properties, with a strong dependence on the experimental conditions, and attempts to improve thermoelectric efficiency often lead to conflicting effects. In this work, we employ the Landauer approach to analyze the effects of different kinds of structural defects and impurities on electronic transport in scandium nitride. This approach allows us to relate the transport mechanisms to the structural and electronic modifications introduced in the lattice, with atomistic resolution. In light of these new insights, we propose a rationale relating part of the experimental variability to its microscopic origin.

Title: Julia Set in Quantum Evolution: The case of Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions
Authors: Manmeet Kaur, Somendra M. Bhattacharjee
Abstract: Dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) are a class of non-equilibrium phase transitions that occur in many-body quantum systems during real-time evolution, rather than through parameter tuning as in conventional phase transitions. This paper presents an exact analytical approach to studying DQPTs by combining complex dynamics with the real-space renormalization group (RG). RG transformations are interpreted as iterated maps on the complex plane, establishing a connection between DQPTs and the Julia set, the boundary separating the basins of attraction of the stable fixed points. This framework is applied to a quantum quench in the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model, where we examine the sensitivity of DQPTs to variations in boundary conditions. We show that altering the topology of the spin chain can suppress DQPTs and provide a qualitative explanation based on quantum speed limits.

Title: Entropic balance with feedback control: information equalities and tight inequalities
Authors: Natalia Ruiz-Pino, Antonio Prados
Abstract: We consider overdamped physical systems evolving under a feedback-controlled fluctuating potential and in contact with a thermal bath at temperature $T$. A Markovian description of the dynamics, which keeps only the last value of the control action, is advantageous -- both from the theoretical and the practical side -- for the entropy balance. Novel second-law equalities and bounds for the extractable work are obtained, the latter being both tighter and easier to evaluate than those in the literature based on the whole chain of controller actions. The Markovian framework also allows us to prove that the bound for the extractable work that incorporates the unavailable information is saturated in a wide class of physical systems, for error-free measurements. These results are illustrated in model systems. For imperfect measurements, there appears an interval of measurement uncertainty, including the point at which work ceases to be extracted, where the new Markovian bound is tighter than the unavailable information bound.

Title: Quantum sensing of time-dependent magnetic signals with molecular spins
Authors: M. Lanza, C. Bonizzoni, O. Mironova, F. Santanni, A. Nicolini, A. Ghirri, A. Cornia, M. Affronte
Abstract: Molecular spins offer a promising platform for quantum sensing, particularly in organic, supramolecular or biological environments. Recognition of the signals by these systems is of particular interest given their possible integration into more complex structures and their possible use as sensors in close proximity to analytes. In this work, we develop two quantum sensing protocols that enable discrimination between different time-dependent magnetic field, without requiring its periodicity to match with the microwave manipulating sequence. These are based on the Hahn echo sequence and have been tested on VO(TPP) and VOPt(SOCPh$)_{4}$ molecular spins embedded in a superconducting YBCO microwave planar resonator. We report a magnetic field sensitivity up to $2.57 \cdot 10^{-7} T Hz^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ (with lower bounds approaching $2.87 \cdot 10^{-8} T Hz^{-\frac{1}{2}})$ for signals with duration of a few microseconds. Under the given conditions, the minimum signal area that can be measured is in the $10^{-10}$ T s range, suggesting a potential trade-off between minimum measurable field and the required signal duration and memory time.

Title: Dynamically stable optical trapping of thermophoretically active Janus colloids
Authors: Sanatan Halder, Manas Khan
Abstract: The ability to optically trap and manipulate artificial microswimmers such as active Janus particles (JPs) provides a breakthrough in active matter research and applications. However, it presents significant challenges because of the asymmetry in the optical properties of JPs and remains incomprehensible. Illustrating the interplay between optical and thermophoretic forces, we demonstrate dynamically stable optical trapping of Pt-silica JPs, where the force-balanced position evolves spontaneously within a localized volume around the focal point and in a vertically shifted annular confinement at low and high laser powers, respectively. Intriguingly, the orientational and orbital dynamics of JP remain strongly coupled in the delocalized confinement. Furthermore, we demonstrate simultaneous optical trapping of multiple JPs. This first report on thermophoresis of Pt-silica JPs and localized-to-delocalized crossover in the position distributions of an optically trapped active JP, verifying theoretical predictions, advances our understanding on confined active matter and their experimental realizations.

Title: Tunable optical lattices for the creation of matter-wave lattice solitons
Authors: Robbie Cruickshank, Arthur La Rooij, Ethan F. Kerr, Timon Hilker, Stefan Kuhr, Elmar Haller
Abstract: We present experimental techniques that employ an optical accordion lattice with dynamically tunable spacing to create and study bright matter-wave solitons in optical lattices. The system allows precise control of lattice parameters over a wide range of lattice spacings and depths. We detail calibration methods for the lattice parameters that are adjusted to the varying lattice spacing, and we demonstrate site-resolved atom number preparation via microwave addressing. Lattice solitons are generated through rapid quenches of the atomic interaction strength and the external trapping potential. We systematically optimize the quench parameters, such as duration and final scattering length, to maximize soliton stability. Our results provide insight into nonlinear matter-wave dynamics in discretized systems and establish a versatile platform for the controlled study of lattice solitons.

Title: Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials Enable Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Doped MoS2
Authors: Abrar Faiyad, Ashlie Martini
Abstract: We present the first computational framework for molecular dynamics simulation of MoS2 doped with 25 elements spanning metals, non-metals, and transition metals using Meta's Universal Model for Atoms machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP). Benchmarking against density functional theory calculations demonstrates the accuracy of the MLIP for simulating doped-MoS2 systems and highlights opportunities for improvement. Using the MLIP, we perform heating-cooling simulations of doped-MoS2 supercells. The simulations capture complex phenomena including dopant clustering, MoS2 layer fracturing, interlayer diffusion, and chemical compound formation at orders-of-magnitude reduced computational cost compared to density functional theory. This work provides an open-source computational workflow for application-oriented design of doped-MoS2, enabling high-throughput screening of dopant candidates and optimization of compositions for targeted tribological, electronic, and optoelectronic performance. The MLIP bridges the accuracy-efficiency gap between first-principles methods and empirical potentials, and the framework offers unprecedented opportunities for large-scale materials discovery in two-dimensional doped material systems.

Title: Thermodynamics of data
Authors: Borko Stosic
Abstract: The recently introduced concept of generalized thermodynamics is explored here in the context of 1d, 2d and 3d data analysis, performed on samples drawn from a 3d X-ray soil sample image. Different threshold levels are used to binarize the 3d sample, wherefrom relative frequencies of binary patterns are found and then used to address finite size scaling behavior of the response functions as a function of the disorder parameter (equivalent of temperature in thermodynamics). It is found that for different threshold levels response functions for increasing sample sizes approach the thermodynamic limit from different directions, with a crossover reminiscent of a transition from open to periodic boundaries of the Ising model, implying existence of a characteristic correlation scale. It is argued here that this characteristic scale corresponds to the "natural" properties of the data, where correlations within finite size samples are neither underestimated nor overestimated. In the current context of soil this scale may be related to the so-called Representative elementary volume (REV), while in other situations this characteristic scale should be interpreted in the context of the phenomenon under study.

Title: Chirality reversal at finite magnetic impurity strength and local signatures of a topological phase transition
Authors: Ruiqi Xu, Arnab Seth, Itamar Kimchi
Abstract: We study the honeycomb lattice with a single magnetic impurity modeled by adding imaginary next-nearest-neighbor hopping ih on a single hexagon. This Haldane defect gives a topological mass term to the gapless Dirac cones and generates chirality. For a small density of defects Neehus et al [arXiv:2405.19289] found that the system's chirality reverses at a critical hc ~ 0.95 associated with an unexpected tri-critical point of Dirac fermions at zero defect density. We investigate this zero-density limit by analyzing a single defect and computing two experimentally relevant measures of chirality: (1) orbital magnetization via local Chern marker, a bulk probe of all occupied states; and (2) electronic currents of low-energy states. Both probes show a chirality reversal at a critical hc ~ 0.9--1. Motivated by this consistency we propose a defect-scale toy model whose low energy states reverse their chirality at hc' ~ 0.87. Remarkably, the same pair of zero energy bound states also generate the critical point hc in the full impurity projected T-matrix. Our results show how the chirality reversal produced by an impurity can be observed either in local probes or in the global topology and suggest a possible role of the microscopic defect structure at the critical point.

Title: Two-Dimensional Altermagnetic Iron Oxyhalides: Real Chern Topology and Valley-Spin-Lattice Coupling
Authors: Yong-Kun Wang, Si Li, Shengyuan A. Yang
Abstract: Altermagnets, a novel class of collinear magnetic materials, exhibit unique spin-split band structures, yet topological insulating states in intrinsic altermagnetic systems are rare. Here, we identify monolayer Fe$_2X_2$O ($X$ = Cl, Br, I) as a new family of 2D altermagnetic real Chern insulators. These materials display robust $d$-wave altermagnetic ordering, semiconducting band gaps, and nontrivial real Chern numbers per spin channel, yielding spin-polarized topological corner modes. They also feature spin-polarized valleys with strong altermagnetism-valley-spin-lattice coupling, enabling valley-selective excitation via linear dichroism and strain-induced valley polarization. In multiferroic Fe$_2$Cl$_2$O, magnetism coexists with ferroelasticity, and an applied strain can switch the Néel vector. These findings position 2D iron oxyhalides as a promising platform for exploring altermagnetism and magnetic topological states for spintronics and valleytronics.

Title: Quantum Monte Carlo study of low-dimensional Fermi fluids of dipolar atoms
Authors: Clio Johnson, Neil D. Drummond, James P. Hague, Calum MacCormick
Abstract: Fermionic cold atoms in optical traps provide viable quantum simulators of correlation effects in electronic systems. For dressed Rydberg atoms in two-dimensional traps with out-of-plane dipole moments, a realistic model of the pairwise interaction is of repulsive dipolar $1/r^3$ form at long range, softened to a constant at short range. This study provides parameterizations of fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo energy data for ferromagnetic (one-component) and paramagnetic (two-component) two-dimensional homogeneous Fermi fluids of interacting dipolar atoms. We find itinerant ferromagnetism to be unstable within our parameter spaces for dipolar interactions both with and without softening. Our parameterization of the energy as a function of density will enable density functional theory to support experimental studies of inhomogeneous fermionic cold atom systems.

Title: A Universal Chern Model on Arbitrary Triangulations
Authors: Nigel Higson, Emil Prodan
Abstract: Given a triangulation of a closed orientable surface, we place single-mode resonators or single-orbital artificial atoms at its vertices, edges and facets, and we devise near-neighbor hopping terms derived from the boundary and Poincaré duality maps of the simplicial complex of the triangulation. Regardless of the surface or its triangulation, these terms always lead to tight-binding Hamiltonians with large and clean topological spectral gaps, carrying non-trivial Chern numbers in the limit of infinite refinement of the triangulation. We confirm this via numerical simulations, and demonstrate how these models enable topological edge modes at the surfaces of real-world objects. Furthermore, we describe a metamaterial whose dynamics reproduces that of the proposed model, thus bringing the topological metamaterials closer to real-world applications.

Title: Effective-Hamiltonian reconstruction through Bloch-wave interferometry in bulk GaAs driven by strong THz fields
Authors: Qile Wu, Seamus D. O Hara, Joseph B. Costello, Loren N. Pfeiffer, Ken W. West, Mark S. Sherwin
Abstract: Effective Hamiltonians (EHs) are powerful tools for understanding the emergent phenomena in condensed matter. Reconstructing an EH directly from experimental data is challenging due to the intricate relationship between EH parameters and observables. Complementary to ARPES, which probes surface electronic properties, bulk-sensitive techniques based on HHG and HSG have shown strong potential for EH reconstruction (EHR). We reconstruct an effective three-band electron-hole (e-h) Hamiltonian in bulk GaAs based on HSG induced by quasi-cw NIR and THz lasers. We perform polarimetry of high-order sidebands while varying the wavelength and polarization of the NIR laser and the strength of the THz field, to systematically explore the information encoded in the sidebands. Based on previous understanding of HSG in GaAs in terms of Bloch-wave interferometry (BWI), an analytic model is derived to quantitatively connect the EH parameters with the measured sideband electric fields under strong, low-frequency THz fields. Assuming that the exciton reduced mass and the parameter that defines the hole Bloch wavefunctions in GaAs are known from existing experiments, we show that the GaAs bandgap, two dephasing constants associated with two e-h species, and an EH parameter that determines the e-h reduced masses, can be simultaneously and unambiguously determined through BWI. We demonstrate that full EHR can be achieved by combining HSG measurements with absorbance spectroscopy. We find that the extracted bandgap of GaAs is about 10\,meV higher than the value inferred from previous absorbance measurements. Quantum-kinetic analysis suggests that the e-h energy in HSG may be renormalized through Fröhlich interaction that is modified by a strong THz field. We show that the energy threshold for optical-phonon emission can be suppressed by applying a strong THz field, leading to nearly constant dephasing rates.

Title: Ground states of a family of frustrated spin models for quasicrystals and their approximants
Authors: Anuradha Jagannathan
Abstract: Many new families of quasicrystal-forming magnetic alloys have been synthesized and studied in recent years. For small changes of composition, the alloys can go from quasiperiodic to periodic (approximant crystals) while conserving most of the local atomic environments. Experiments show that many of the periodic approximants order at low temperatures, with clear signatures of ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic transitions, and also in some cases undergo non-equilibrium spin glass transitions. In contrast, the quasicrystals are mostly found to be spin glasses. Systematically studying these alloys could help elucidate the role played by quasiperiodicity in (de)stabilizing long range magnetic order. In this work, we study cluster spin models with the aim of understanding the mechanisms behind various types of long range magnetic ordering in approximants and quasicrystals. These models embody key features of real systems, and to some extent are analytically tractable, both for periodic and quasiperiodic cases. For the quasicrystal, we describe two novel magnetic phases with quasiperiodic ordering. Our results should serve to motivate further studies with detailed numerical explorations of this family of models.

Title: Transverse superconducting diode without parity and time-reversal violation
Authors: Ruo-Peng Yu, Jin-Xin Hu, Zi-Ting Sun
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect (SDE) is characterized by its nonreciprocal nature in critical supercurrents. However, realizing a longitudinal SDE typically requires simultaneous time-reversal ($\mathcal{T}$) and inversion ($\mathcal{P}$) symmetry breaking in the device, raising challenges in applications. In this Letter, we reveal that an off-axis direct-current bias applied to a planar anisotropic superconductor can convert intrinsic anisotropy into transverse nonreciprocity, generating ultra-tunable SDE without breaking either $\mathcal{P}$ or $\mathcal{T}$ symmetry. Using both Ginzburg-Landau theory and self-consistent mean-field calculations, we show that diode efficiency can be continuously tuned via bias current amplitude. Notably, when the injected bias current exceeds a critical threshold, the system is driven into a ``unidirectional superconductivity" regime, where transverse dissipationless currents are permitted in only one direction. Based on this mechanism, we propose the ``current-gated orthogonal superconducting transistor (CGOST)" and demonstrate its utility in tunable supercurrent range controllers and half-wave rectifiers. Our findings open new avenues for nonreciprocal superconducting electronics.

Title: Density-dependent sodium-storage mechanisms in hard carbon materials
Authors: Alexis Front, Tapio Ala-Nissila, Miguel A. Caro
Abstract: Understanding the sodium-storage mechanism in hard carbon (HC) anodes is crucial for advancing sodium-ion battery (SIB) technology. However, the intrinsic complexity of HC microstructures and their interactions with sodium remain not fully elucidated. We present a multiscale methodology that integrates grand-canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations with a machine-learning interatomic potential based on the Gaussian approximation potential (GAP) framework to investigate sodium insertion mechanisms in hard carbons with different levels of porosity, achieved by simulating structural models with densities ranging from 0.7 to 1.9 g cm$^{-3}$. Structural and thermodynamic analyses reveal the interplay between pore size and accessibility and the relative contributions of adsorption, intercalation, and pore filling to the overall storage capacity. Low-density carbons favor pore-filling, achieving extremely high capacities at near-zero voltages, whereas high-density carbons primarily store sodium through adsorption and intercalation, leading to lower but more stable capacities. Intermediate-density carbons ($1.3-1.6$ g cm$^{-3}$) provide the most balanced performance, combining moderate capacity (480 and 310 mAh g$^{-1}$), safe operating voltages, and minimal volume expansion ($<10$\%). These findings establish a direct correlation between carbon density and electrochemical behavior, providing atomic-scale insight into how hard carbon morphology governs sodium-storage. The proposed framework offers a rational design principle for optimizing HC-based SIB anodes toward high energy density and long-term cycling stability.

Title: Electric circuit analog of Landau-Zener tunneling using time-varying elements
Authors: Enhong Cheng, Zheng Lian, Zezhou Chen, Li-Jun Lang
Abstract: Landau-Zener tunneling (LZT) is a fundamental dynamical phenomenon, ubiquitous in various quantum systems. Here, we propose a time-varying electric circuit to address the question of whether the quantum LZT can occur in classical systems. Although the underlying differential equation of motion is quite different from the Schrödinger equation and the instantaneous frequency spectrum of the proposed circuit is not linear, the probability of the LZT in circuits (circuit LZT for short), based on our generalized definition for norm-unconserved systems, still follows the laws of the LZT in quantum systems, codetermined by the linear sweeping rate $\alpha'$ and the frequency gap $\Delta$, i.e., approaching the analytical value $\exp(-\pi\Delta^2/2\alpha')$, regardless of whether the coupling is reciprocal or nonreciprocal. The deep relationship between the circuit LZT and its quantum counterpart can be established through a linearization and block-diagonalization process. Our proposal provides a general method for simulating time-dependent quantum models using time-varying electric circuits, which has been lacking in previous studies, and paves the way for studying more complicated LZT and other dynamical phenomena in circuits and other classical systems.

Title: Burgers equation from non-thermal stationary states in nearly-integrable gases
Authors: Paweł Lisiak, Maciej Łebek, Miłosz Panfil
Abstract: When a gas of particles interacts with much a larger reservoir the density dynamics on large scales is typically governed by diffusion. We study this paradigmatic problem for weakly coupled integrable systems and show that this picture gets altered, when transport is investigated on top of long-lived non-thermal states. Remarkably, for states non-invariant under parity we find Burgers equation arising in the hydrodynamic limit. We explicitly compute the diffusion constant and nonlinear advective coefficient of the Burgers equation using a variant of the Chapman-Enskog theory. We find an excellent agreement between our theory and numerical simulations of a simplified model of stochastic two-body collisions. Our conclusions are based only on Galilean invariance, existence of a small system-bath coupling parameter and a small momentum exchange between the system and the bath particles during two-body scattering.

Title: Non-thermal pairing glue of electrons in the steady state
Authors: Michele Pini, Christian H. Johansen, Francesco Piazza
Abstract: The study of mechanisms for enhancing superconductivity has been a central topic in condensed matter physics due to the combination of fundamental and technological interests. One promising route is to exploit non-equilibrium effects in the steady state. Efforts in this direction have so far focused on enhancing the pairing mechanism known from thermal equilibrium through modified distributions for the electrons or the bosons mediating the electron-electron interaction. In this work, we identify an additional pairing mechanism that is active only outside thermal equilibrium. By generalizing Eliashberg theory to non-equilibrium steady states using the Keldysh formalism, we derive a set of Eliashberg equations that capture the effect of this genuinely non-thermal pairing glue even in the weak-coupling regime. We discuss two examples where this mechanism has a major impact. First, in a temperature-bias setup, we find that superconductivity is enhanced when the boson mediator is colder than the electrons. Second, we find that an incoherent drive of the boson mediator at energies much greater than the temperature pushes the system far from thermal equilibrium but leaves the critical coupling essentially unchanged, owing to a competition between electron heating and the enhancement of pairing by the non-thermal glue.

Title: Instanton theory and fluctuation corrections to the thermal nucleation rate of a ferromagnetic superfluid
Authors: Enrique Rozas Garcia, Johannes Hofmann
Abstract: We provide a field-theoretical description of thermal nucleation in a one-dimensional ferromagnetic superfluid, a quantum-gas analogue of false-vacuum decay. The rate at which ground-state domains nucleate follows an Arrhenius law, with an exponential factor determined by a saddle-point of the energy functional -- the critical droplet or instanton -- and a magnitude fixed by small fluctuations about this configuration. We evaluate both contributions over the full parameter space, using a Gel'fand-Yaglom approach to reduce the calculation of the fluctuation spectrum to an initial-value problem. In addition, we obtain a closed-form expression for critical droplets close to the coexistence line, and use it to formulate an effective theory of domain nucleation and growth as a Kramers escape problem for the droplet size. Our results determine the parametric dependence of the nucleation rate and predict its signature in experimental images of a nucleating gas, increasing the rigor of comparisons between nucleation theory and experiment.

Title: Topological Interface States and Nonlinear Thermoelectric Performance in Armchair Graphene Nanoribbon Heterostructures
Authors: David M T Kuo
Abstract: We investigate the emergence and topological nature of interface states (IFs) in N-AGNR/$(N-2)$-AGNR/N-AGNR heterostructure (AGNRH) segments lacking translational symmetry, focusing on their relation to the end states (ESs) of the constituent armchair graphene nanoribbon (AGNR) segments. For AGNRs with $R_1$-type unit cells, the ES numbers under a longitudinal electric field follow the relations $N = N_{A(B)} \times 6 + 1$ and $N = N_{A(B)} \times 6 + 3$, whereas $R_2$-type unit cells exhibit $(N_{A(B)} + 1)$ ESs. The subscripts $A$ and $B$ denote the chirality types of the ESs. The Stark effect lifts ES degeneracy and enables clear spectral separation between ESs and IFs. Using a real-space bulk boundary perturbation approach, we show that opposite-chirality states hybridize through junction-site perturbations and may shift out of the bulk gap. The number and chirality of IFs in symmetric AGNRHs are determined by the difference between the ESs of the outer and central segments, $N_O$ and $N_C$, according to $N_{IF,\beta} = |N_{O,B(A)} - N_{C,A(B)}|$, where $\beta$ labels the chirality. Depending on whether $N_O > N_C$ or $N_C > N_O$, the resulting IFs acquire B- or A-chirality, respectively. Calculated transmission spectra ${\cal T}_{GNR}(\varepsilon)$ reveal that AGNRHs host a topological double quantum dot (TDQD) when IFs originate from the ESs of the central AGNR segment. Using an Anderson model with effective intra-dot and inter-dot Coulomb interactions, we derive an analytical expression for the tunneling current through the TDQD via a closed-form transmission coefficient. Thermoelectric analysis shows that TDQDs yield enhanced nonlinear power output in the electron-dilute and hole-dilute charge states, with Coulomb blockade suppressing thermal current but not thermal voltage.

Title: Cross-Interaction Softness as a Route to Microphase Separation in Binary Colloidal Systems
Authors: Umesh Dhumal
Abstract: Understanding how interparticle interactions govern phase behavior is central to controlling self-organization in multicomponent soft-matter systems. In particular, the role of cross-interactions between unlike components remains insufficiently understood. Here, we systematically investigate how cross-interaction character controls phase behavior in binary mixtures of hard and soft particles using coarse-grained modeling, Reference Interaction Site Model (RISM) theory, and molecular dynamics simulations. Four representative systems are examined that differ only in whether interactions between unlike particles are bounded or hard-sphere. We show that penetrable (bounded) cross-interactions are both necessary and sufficient to induce microphase separation, even in the absence of attractive forces. Such systems exhibit dispersed states, macrophase separation, and microphase-separated morphologies characterized by finite-wavelength compositional ordering. In contrast, purely hard-sphere cross interactions suppress microphase separation entirely, despite strong local clustering. Comparison between theory and simulations reveals qualitative agreement in phase topology, while simulations additionally capture hierarchical and multiscale ordering near crossover regimes. These findings establish cross-interaction softness as a fundamental design principle for controlling phase behavior in multicomponent colloidal and soft-matter systems.

Title: Symmetry and Topology in the Non-Hermitian Kitaev chain
Authors: Ayush Raj, Soham Ray, Sai Satyam Samal
Abstract: We investigate the non-Hermitian Kitaev chain with non-reciprocal hopping amplitudes and asymmetric superconducting pairing. We work out the symmetry structure of the model and show that particle-hole symmetry (PHS) is preserved throughout the entire parameter regime. As a consequence of PHS, the topological phase transition point of a finite open chain coincides with that of the periodic (infinite) system. By explicitly constructing the zero-energy wave functions (Majorana modes), we show that Majorana modes necessarily occur as reciprocal localization pairs accumulating on opposite boundaries, whose combined probability density exhibits an exact cancellation of the non-Hermitian skin effect for the zero energy modes. Excited states, by contrast, generically display skin-effect localization, with particle and hole components accumulating at opposite ends of the system. At the level of bulk topology, we further construct a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant in restricted parameter regimes that correctly distinguishes the topological and trivial phases. Finally, we present the topological phase diagram of the non-Hermitian Kitaev chain across a broad range of complex parameters and delineate the associated phase boundaries.

Title: Magnetic Structures Database from Symmetry-aided High-Throughput Calculations
Authors: Hanjing Zhou, Yuxuan Mu, Dingwen Zhang, Hangbing Chu, Di Wang, Huimei Liu, Xiangang Wan
Abstract: Magnetic structures, which play a central role in determining their physical properties, are known for only very limited compounds. Traditional theoretical methods based on first-principles calculations are fundamentally limited by the need to calculate a large space of input magnetic configurations. Here we introduce a symmetry-aided strategy based on Landau's phase transition theory. By utilizing the crystallographic space group and the Wyckoff positions of magnetic ions, we narrow down the initial magnetic configurations to a limited number of candidates via the analysis of the group representations. The magnetic ground state is subsequently determined by the lowest energy of those well-seleted magnetic configurations via first-principles calculations. Benchmarking calculations were performed on a subset of the MAGNDATA database with wave vector q=0 and fewer than 40 atoms per unit cell, comprising 302 materials. Our method successfully identified the magnetic structures for 212 of these materials. We further apply our highly efficient method to 7,520 stoichiometric transition metal compounds with fewer than 20 atoms per unit cell in the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database, and establish a magnetic structure database containing 2,900 magnetic materials. To demonstrate the utility of our database, we apply it to the systematic exploration of magnetic topological phases and altermagnets, leading to the identification of 1,070 and 392 instances, respectively.

Title: Kinetic Flux Equations for Ion Exchange in Silicate Glasses
Authors: Guglielmo Macrelli
Abstract: Ion exchange kinetic flux equations have been extensively investigated since the mid-twentieth century and continue to provide a fundamental framework for describing mass transport phenomena in solid materials. Despite the maturity of this field, inconsistencies remain in the literature concerning the definition, dimensional consistency, and physical interpretation of the parameters involved. A rigorous and unified treatment of these equations is therefore essential to ensure the reproducibility and comparability of theoretical and experimental studies. The present study aims to establish a coherent and systematic development of ion exchange kinetic flux equations, with particular emphasis on the consistent definition and dimensional formulation of the relevant physical quantities. Beyond refining the theoretical foundations, this study extends the classical formulation by incorporating the influence of mechanical stress on ion transport and considering cross-term interactions within the framework of linear irreversible thermodynamics. This study investigates ion-exchange kinetics within silicate glasses, operating under the Nernst-Planck binary interdiffusion regime. These developments provide a more comprehensive description of ion exchange kinetics, particularly as applied to silicate glasses, where coupling between chemical and mechanical effects plays a crucial role in determining transport behavior and performance.

Title: Crystal Generation using the Fully Differentiable Pipeline and Latent Space Optimization
Authors: Osman Goni Ridwan, Gilles Frapper, Hongfei Xue, Qiang Zhu
Abstract: We present a materials generation framework that couples a symmetry-conditioned variational autoencoder (CVAE) with a differentiable SO(3) power spectrum objective to steer candidates toward a specified local environment under the crystallographic constraints. In particular, we implement a fully differentiable pipeline to enable batch-wise optimization on both direct and latent crystallographic representations. Using the GPU acceleration, this implementation achieves about fivefold speed compared to our previous CPU workflow, while yielding comparable outcomes. In addition, we introduce the optimization strategy that alternatively performs optimization on the direct and latent crystal representations. This dual-level relaxation approach can effectively escape local minima defined by different objective gradients, thus increasing the success rate of generating complex structures satisfying the target local environments. This framework can be extended to systems consisting of multi-components and multi-environments, providing a scalable route to generate material structures with the target local environment.

Title: Scalable Dielectric Tensor Predictions for Inorganic Materials using Equivariant Graph Neural Networks
Authors: Haowei Hua, Chen Liang, Ding Pan, Irwin King, Shengchao Liu, Koji Tsuda, Wanyu Lin
Abstract: Accurate prediction of dielectric tensors is essential for accelerating the discovery of next-generation inorganic dielectric materials. Existing machine learning approaches, such as equivariant graph neural networks, typically rely on specially-designed network architectures to enforce O(3) equivariance. However, to preserve equivariance, these specially-designed models restrict the update of equivariant features during message passing to linear transformations or gated equivariant nonlinearities. The inability to implicitly characterize more complex nonlinear structures may reduce the predictive accuracy of the model. In this study, we introduce a frame-averaging-based approach to achieve equivariant dielectric tensor prediction. We propose GoeCTP, an O(3)-equivariant framework that predicts dielectric tensors without imposing any structural restrictions on the backbone network. We benchmark its performance against several state-of-the-art models and further employ it for large-scale virtual screening of thermodynamically stable materials from the Materials Project database. GoeCTP successfully identifies various promising candidates, such as Zr(InBr$_3$)$_2$ (band gap $E_g = 2.41$ eV, dielectric constant $\overline{\varepsilon} = 194.72$) and SeI$_2$ (anisotropy ratio $\alpha_r = 96.763$), demonstrating its accuracy and efficiency in accelerating the discovery of advanced inorganic dielectric materials.

Title: Discovery of a new weberite-type antiferroelectric: La3NbO7
Authors: Louis Alaerts, Jesse Schimpf, Xinyan Li, Jiongzhi Zheng, Ella Banyas, Jeffrey B. Neaton, Sinéad M. Griffin, Yimo Han, Lane W. Martin, Geoffroy Hautier
Abstract: Antiferroelectrics are antipolar materials which possess an electric field-induced phase transition to a polar, ferroelectric phase and offer significant potential for sensing/actuation and energy-storage applications. Known antiferroelectrics are relatively scarce and mainly based on a limited set of perovskite materials and their alloys (e.g., PbZrO$_3$, AgNbO$_3$, NaNbO$_3$). Here, a new family of lead-free, weberite-type antiferroelectrics, identified through a large-scale, first-principles computational search is introduced. The screening methodology, which connects lattice dynamics to antipolar distortions, predicted that La$_3$NbO$_7$ could exhibit antiferroelectricity. We confirm the prediction through the synthesis and characterization of epitaxial La$_3$NbO$_7$ thin films, which display the signature double hysteresis loops of an antiferroelectric material as well as clear evidence of an antipolar ground state structure from transmission electron microscopy. The antiferroelectricity in La$_3$NbO$_7$ is simpler than most known antiferroelectrics and can be explained by a Kittel-type mechanism involving the movement of niobium atoms in an oxygen octahedron through a single phonon mode which results in a smaller change in the volume during the field-induced phase transition. Additionally, it is found that La$_3$NbO$_7$ combines a high threshold field with a high breakdown field ($\approx$ 6MV/cm) - which opens up opportunities for energy-storage applications. This new weberite-type family of materials offers many opportunities to tune electrical and temperature response especially through substitutions on the rare-earth site. Ultimately, this work demonstrates a successful data-driven theory-to-experiment discovery of an entirely new family of antiferroelectrics and provides a blueprint for the future design of ferroic materials.

Title: Short-time statistics of extinction and blowup in reaction kinetics
Authors: Rotem Degany, Michael Assaf, Baruch Meerson
Abstract: We study the statistics of extinction and blowup times in well-mixed systems of stochastically reacting particles. We focus on the short-time tail, $T \to 0$, of the extinction- or blowup-time distribution $\mathcal{P}_m(T)$, where $m$ is the number of particles at $t=0$. This tail often exhibits an essential singularity at $T=0$, and we show that the singularity is captured by a time-dependent WKB (Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin) approximation applied directly to the master equation. This approximation, however, leaves undetermined a large pre-exponential factor. Here we show how to calculate this factor by applying a leading- and a subleading-order WKB approximation to the Laplace-transformed backward master equation. Accurate asymptotic results can be obtained when this WKB solution can be matched to another approximate solution (the ``inner" solution), valid for not too large $m$. We demonstrate and verify this method on three examples of reactions which are also solvable without approximations.

Title: Competing Paramagnetic Phases in the Maple-Leaf Heisenberg Antiferromagnet
Authors: Paul L. Ebert, Yasir Iqbal, Alexander Wietek
Abstract: We establish a remarkably rich ground state phase diagram in the maple-leaf lattice spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet as a function of the three symmetry-inequivalent nearest-neighbor bonds using exact diagonalization and tower-of-states analysis on clusters up to $N=36$ sites. Besides a hexagonal plaquette state, a star-shaped valence bond solid state is discovered in close vicinity to the (canted) $120^\circ$ magnetic phase, strongly reminiscent of a de-confined critical point or Dirac spin liquid scenario on the triangular lattice antiferromagnets. Moreover, an exact dimer product-state is observed next to a collinear Néel-state, similar to the Shastry-Sutherland model. All identified phases compete in a parameter regime close to the isotropic point, providing a promising region for spin liquids to emerge. By analyzing Gutzwiller-projected wave-functions we identify a sliver of parameter regime where a gapped $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ spin liquid Ansatz is in astonishing agreement with the exact $N=36$ ground state. This rich competition of paramagnetic phases demonstrates that the maple-leaf antiferromagnet is a promising platform for exotic states of matter and quantum critical phenomena.

Title: Anomalously High Phonon Thermal Conductivity Driven by Weak Electron-Phonon Coupling in Weyl Semimetals TaAs and TaP
Authors: Xianyong Ding, Xin Jin, Dengfeng Li, Jing Fan, Peng Yu, Xiaoyuan Zhou, Xiaolong Yang, Rui Wang
Abstract: In conventional metals, thermal transport is governed by electrons, with phonon contributions often considered negligible. Here, through rigorous first-principles calculations, we uncover a phonon-dominated thermal transport regime in the Weyl semimetals TaAs and TaP. Remarkably, although TaP is metallic, its phonon thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{\text{ph}}$) reaches as high as 171 Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ at room temperature, surpassing its electronic counterpart by more than a factor of five. This anomalously high $\kappa_{\text{ph}}$ is enabled by the unique electronic and phononic band structures, characterized by the Weyl nodes near the Fermi level, together with acoustic phonon bunching and a wide frequency gap in the phonon spectrum, which collectively suppress phonon-electron and phonon-phonon scattering processes. Due to the substantial phonon contribution, the derived Lorenz number deviates strongly from the conventional Wiedemann-Franz law. We further show that the significance of phonon thermal transport is universal across topological semimetals. Our work provides deeper insight into thermal transport mechanisms in topological semimetals and extends the scope for discovering materials with high thermal conductivity.

Title: Vorticity-Crystalline Order Coupling in Supersolids: Excitations and Re-entrant Phases
Authors: Malte Schubert, Koushik Mukherjee, Philipp Stürmer, Stephanie Reimann
Abstract: Rotation is a natural tool in ultracold gases to break time-reversal symmetry, yet its impact on the collective excitations of supersolids remains largely unexplored. We show theoretically that tuning the rotation frequency, rather than the interparticle interactions, can trigger the superfluid-to-supersolid transition in Bose-Einstein condensates (dBECs). Computing excitation spectra in the presence of vortices and persistent currents, we uncover a vortex-driven de-softening mechanism whereby quantized vorticity elevates the gapless Goldstone mode to a finite-energy roton, restoring superfluidity. This effect results in re-entrant supersolid phases as a function of rotation frequency, revealing a fundamental coupling between topological defects and crystalline order.

Title: Contribution of Water to Pressure and Cold Denaturation of Proteins
Authors: Valentino Bianco, Giancarlo Franzese
Abstract: The mechanisms of cold- and pressure-denaturation of proteins are matter of debate and are commonly understood as due to water-mediated interactions. Here we study several cases of proteins, with or without a unique native state, with or without hydrophilic residues, by means of a coarse-grain protein model in explicit solvent. We show, using Monte Carlo simulations, that taking into account how water at the protein interface changes its hydrogen bond properties and its density fluctuations is enough to predict protein stability regions with elliptic shapes in the temperature-pressure plane, consistent with previous theories. Our results clearly identify the different mechanisms with which water participates to denaturation and open the perspective to develop advanced computational design tools for protein engineering.

Title: Revisiting superradiance dynamics from single diamond nanocrystals with a physically consistent model for fluorescence decay
Authors: Jakub J. Borkowski, Artur Czerwinski, Piotr Kolenderski
Abstract: The paper by C. Bradac et al. [Nat. Commun. 8, 1205 (2017)] discusses room-temperature superradiance from NV color centers in diamonds. It presents a new model intended to reflect experimental characteristics of this phenomenon. To validate the model, the authors provide experimental results that are subsequently compared with numerical calculations derived from the scheme. Motivated by our own experiments with the fluorescence of similar NV samples, we attempted to create a theoretical model to accurately describe experimental systems. Initially, we aimed to incorporate the numerical equations from Bradac et al.'s paper's supplement into our own theoretical framework. However, we encountered numerous issues resulting in non-physical results such as negative photon counts or non-zero asymptotic fluorescence intensity. We identified these inconsistencies and proposed amendments to rectify them. We have developed our own framework by correctly reinterpreting the terms of the master equation. The resulting formulas produce physically meaningful results consistent with experimental data.

Abstract: The efficacy of mathematical models heavily depends on the quality of the training data, yet collecting sufficient data is often expensive and challenging. Many modeling applications require inferring parameters only as a means to predict other quantities of interest (QoI). Because models often contain many unidentifiable (sloppy) parameters, QoIs often depend on a relatively small number of parameter combinations. Therefore, we introduce an information-matching criterion based on the Fisher Information Matrix to select the most informative training data from a candidate pool. This method ensures that the selected data contain sufficient information to learn only those parameters that are needed to constrain downstream QoIs. It is formulated as a convex optimization problem, making it scalable to large models and datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach across various modeling problems in diverse scientific fields, including power systems and underwater acoustics. Finally, we use information-matching as a query function within an Active Learning loop for material science applications. In all these applications, we find that a relatively small set of optimal training data can provide the necessary information for achieving precise predictions. These results are encouraging for diverse future applications, particularly active learning in large machine learning models.

Title: Berezinskii--Kosterlitz--Thouless transition in a context-sensitive random language model
Authors: Yuma Toji, Jun Takahashi, Vwani Roychowdhury, Hideyuki Miyahara
Abstract: Several power-law critical properties involving different statistics in natural languages -- reminiscent of scaling properties of physical systems at or near phase transitions -- have been documented for decades. The recent rise of large language models has added further evidence and excitement by providing intriguing similarities with notions in physics such as scaling laws and emergent abilities. However, specific instances of classes of generative language models that exhibit phase transitions, as understood by the statistical physics community, are lacking. In this work, inspired by the one-dimensional Potts model in statistical physics, we construct a simple probabilistic language model that falls under the class of context-sensitive grammars, which we call the context-sensitive random language model, and numerically demonstrate an unambiguous phase transition in the framework of a natural language model. We explicitly show that a precisely defined order parameter -- that captures symbol frequency biases in the sentences generated by the language model -- changes from strictly zero to a strictly nonzero value (in the infinite-length limit of sentences), implying a mathematical singularity arising when tuning the parameter of the stochastic language model we consider. Furthermore, we identify the phase transition as a variant of the Berezinskii--Kosterlitz--Thouless (BKT) transition, which is known to exhibit critical properties not only at the transition point but also in the entire phase. This finding leads to the possibility that critical properties in natural languages may not require careful fine-tuning nor self-organized criticality, but are generically explained by the underlying connection between language structures and the BKT phases.

Title: Fluctuations in Various Regimes of Non-Hermiticity and a Holographic Principle
Authors: G. Akemann, M. Duits, L. D. Molag
Abstract: The variance of the number of particles in a set is an important quantity in understanding the statistics of non-interacting fermionic systems in low dimensions. An exact map of their ground state in a harmonic trap in one and two dimensions to the classical Gaussian unitary and complex Ginibre ensemble, respectively, allows to determine the counting statistics at finite and infinite system size. We will establish two new results in this setup. First, we uncover an interpolating central limit theorem between known results in one and two dimensions, for linear statistics of the elliptic Ginibre ensemble. We find an entire range of interpolating weak non-Hermiticity limits, given by a two-parameter family for the mesoscopic scaling regime. Second, we considerably generalize the proportionality between the number variance and the entanglement entropy between Fermions in a set $A$ and its complement in two dimensions. Previously known only for rotationally invariant sets and external potentials, we prove a holographic principle for general non-rotationally invariant sets and random normal matrices. It states that both number variance and entanglement entropy are proportional to the circumference of $A$.

Title: Heat as a gauge connection
Authors: Bryan W Roberts
Abstract: We show that heat defines a gauge connection on a line bundle over work configurations. Vanishing curvature is equivalent to the local existence of entropy and temperature functions such that heat can be expressed as $TdS$. A conjecture of Jauch, that entropy and temperature arise from a conservation law, is shown to follow as a special case. Global equilibrium may nevertheless fail in the presence of a thermal analogue of geometric phase.

Title: Low-loss Nb on Si superconducting resonators from a dual-use spintronics deposition chamber and with acid-free post-processing

Abstract: Magnetic impurities are known to degrade superconductivity. For this reason, physical vapor deposition chambers that have previously been used for magnetic materials have generally been avoided for making high-quality superconducting resonator devices. In this article, we show by example that such chambers can be used for this purpose; with Nb films sputtered in a chamber that continues to be used for magnetic materials, we demonstrate compact (\SI{3}{\micro\meter} gap) coplanar waveguide resonators with low-power internal quality factors near one million. We achieve this using a resist strip bath with no post-fabrication acid treatment, which results in performance comparable to previous strip baths with acid treatments. We also find evidence that this improved resist strip bath provides a better surface chemical template for post-fabrication hydrogen fluoride processing. These results are consistent across three Si substrate preparation methods, including a \SI{700}{\celsius} anneal. These results will inform nanofabrication for other superconducting materials and the integration of magnetic materials for hybrid systems.

Title: Refractive Index, Its Chromatic Dispersion, and Thermal Coefficients of Four Less Common Glycols
Authors: Anastasiya Derkachova, Daniel Jakubczyk, Gennadiy Derkachov, Kwasi Nyandey
Abstract: We report comprehensive measurements of the refractive index as a function of wavelength and temperature for four less commonly studied glycols: pentaethylene glycol, hexaethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol (mixture of isomers), and tripropylene glycol. The measurements cover the spectral range of 0.39-1.07 ${\mu}$m and temperatures from 1$°$C to 45$°$C. The data were modeled using a two-pole Sellmeier equation, with temperature dependence expressed through wavelength-dependent thermal coefficients. Four fitting models (Sellmeier and Cauchy) with different numbers of parameters were tested. For pentaethylene glycol, results from all models are shown; for the remaining glycols, only the two-pole Sellmeier fits are presented in tabular form. Thermal coefficient values for six wavelengths of practical importance are also tabulated. Experimental uncertainties in refractive index, wavelength, and temperature were rigorously evaluated and incorporated into the analysis. The influence of sample purity, including residual water content and manufacturer-reported impurities, was assessed and accounted for in the uncertainty estimates. To our knowledge, this is the first dataset to systematically characterize both chromatic dispersion and thermal variation of the refractive index for these glycols over such a broad spectral and temperature range. The validated fitting equations and parameters are suitable for use in optical modeling, materials characterisation, and related applications. All raw data are available in a publicly accessible repository.

Title: The Lee-Wick-Chern-Simons pseudo-quantum electrodynamics
Authors: M. J. Neves
Abstract: The Lee-Wick pseudo-quantum electrodynamics in the presence of a Chern-Simons term is studied in this paper. The paper starts with a non-local lagrangian density that sets the pseudo-Lee-Wick electrodynamics defined on a $1+2$ space-time added to a non-local Chern-Simons topological term. Thus, we obtain the Lee-Wick-Chern-Simons pseudo-electrodynamics as a most complete gauge invariant model that provides a light mass associated with the Chern-Simons parameter, and also includes a Lee-Wick heavy mass. We investigate classical aspects as the potential energy for the interaction of static charges through the gauge propagator. The causality of theory is discussed through the retarded Green function in the coordinate space. The gauge field of the Lee-Wick-Chern-Simons pseudo-electrodynamics is minimally coupled to the fermions sector that includes new degree of freedoms, as a Lee-Wick heavy fermion partner of the electron. The perturbative approach for the theory is presented via effective action in which we obtain the Ward identities. We study the quantum corrections at one loop, as the electron self-energy, the vacuum polarization, and the $3$-vertex. We show that the Lee-Wick mass has a fundamental role in these results, where it works like a natural regulator of the ultraviolet divergences. The $g-2$ factor for the electron is obtained as function of the LW mass, and of the CS parameter. Through the optical theorem, the Lee-Wick-Chern-Simons pseudo-electrodynamics is unitary at the tree level.

Title: Steering reaction flux by coupling product channels
Authors: Dominik Dorer, Shinsuke Haze, Jing-Lun Li, José P. D'Incao, Eberhard Tiemann, Paul S. Julienne, Markus Deiß, Johannes Hecker Denschlag
Abstract: We demonstrate a method for controlling the outcome of an ultracold chemical few-body reaction by redirecting a tunable fraction of reaction flux from one selected product channel to another one. In the reaction, three ultracold atoms collide to form a diatomic molecule. This product molecule can be produced in various internal states, characterizing the different product channels of the reaction. Our scheme relies on the coupling between two such product channels at an avoided molecular energy level crossing in the presence of an external magnetic field. The degree of coupling can be set by the magnetic field strength and allows for a widely tunable flux control between the two channels. This scheme is quite general and also holds great promise for a large variety of chemical processes with diverse species, since molecular energy level crossings are ubiquitous in molecular systems and are often easily accessible by standard laboratory equipment.

Title: Constraints on the symmetric mass generation paradigm for lattice chiral gauge theories
Authors: Maarten Golterman, Yigal Shamir
Abstract: Within the symmetric mass generation (SMG) approach to the construction of lattice chiral gauge theories, one attempts to use interactions to render mirror fermions massive without symmetry breaking, thus obtaining the desired chiral massless spectrum. If successful, the gauge field can be turned on, and thus a chiral gauge theory can be constructed in the phase in which SMG takes place. In this paper we argue that the zeros that often replace the mirror poles of fermion two-point functions in an SMG phase should be ``kinematical'' singularities. We conjecture that the SMG interactions generate opposite-chirality bound states, which combine with the gapped elementary mirror states to form massive Dirac fermions. The propagator zeros can then be avoided by choosing an appropriate set of interpolating fields that contains both elementary and composite fields. This allows us to apply general constraints on the existence of a chiral fermion spectrum which are valid in the presence of (non-gauge) interactions of arbitrary strength, including in any SMG phase. Using a suitably constructed one-particle lattice hamiltonian describing the fermion spectrum, we formulate a generalized no-go theorem which establishes the conditions for the applicability of the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem to this hamiltonian. If these conditions are satisfied, the massless fermion spectrum must be vector-like. We add some general observations on the strong coupling limit of SMG models. We also elaborate on the qualitative differences between four-dimensional and two-dimensional theories that limit the lessons that can be drawn from two-dimensional models. Finally, we compile a list of open questions which must be addressed in any SMG model in order to determine whether or not it is subject to the generalized no-go theorem.

Title: Distinct Berry Phases in a Single Triangular Möbius Microwave Resonator
Authors: E. C. I. Paterson, M. E. Tobar, M. Goryachev, J. Bourhill
Abstract: We report the experimental observation of two distinct Berry phases ($+\frac{2\pi}{3}$ and $-\frac{2\pi}{3}$) generated on the surface of a Möbius cavity resonator at microwave frequencies supporting the TE$_{1,0,n}$ mode family. This resonator consists of a twisted, mirror-asymmetric prism with a cross-section of the triangular $D_3$ symmetry group, bent around on itself to form a ring. This geometric class supports resonant modes with nonzero electromagnetic helicity (i.e. nonzero $\vec{E}\cdot\vec{B}$ product) at microwave frequencies. There exist modes with three-fold rotational symmetry as well as those that exhibit no rotational symmetry. The latter result in an accumulated Berry phase whilst the former do not, which is determined from the measured frequency shift of the modes when compared to a mirror-symmetric resonator of otherwise equivalent geometry.

Title: Do mixed states exhibit deep thermalisation?
Authors: Alan Sherry, Sthitadhi Roy
Abstract: Deep thermalisation -- where ensembles of pure states on a local subsystem, conditioned on measurement outcomes on its complement, approach universal maximum-entropy ensembles -- represents a stronger form of ergodicity than conventional thermalisation. We show that this framework fails dramatically for mixed initial states, evolved unitarily, even with infinitesimal initial mixedness. To address this, we introduce a new paradigm of deep thermalisation for mixed states, fundamentally distinct from that for pure-state ensembles. In our formulation, the deep thermal ensemble arises by tracing out auxiliary degrees of freedom from a maximum-entropy ensemble defined on an augmented system, with the ensemble structure depending explicitly on the entropy of the initial state. We demonstrate that such ensembles emerge dynamically in generic, locally interacting chaotic systems. For the self-dual kicked Ising chain, which we show to be exactly solvable for a class of mixed initial states, we find exact emergence of the so-defined mixed-state deep thermal ensemble at finite times. Our results therefore lead to fundamental insights into how maximum entropy principles and deep thermalisation manifest themselves in unitary dynamics of states with finite entropy.

Title: Irrational CFTs from coupled anyon chains with non-invertible symmetries?
Authors: António Antunes, Junchen Rong
Abstract: Irrational CFTs in 1+1d with a discrete spectrum and no conserved currents other than the stress-tensor are expected to be generic, unsolvable by standard methods, and hard to construct explicitly. We introduce a lattice model that realizes a candidate for such a CFT as a conformal phase of matter without fine-tuning. The model is constructed by coupling $N\geq3$ golden anyon chains together, preserving $N$ copies of the Fibonacci non-invertible symmetry. We use the MPS/DMRG approach to study this model numerically, which allows us to calculate the corresponding conformal data, obtaining hints of its irrationality. Along the way, we characterize the phase diagram for $N=2$ coupled chains where we identify a weakly first-order phase transition as well as critical points that we are able to identify with known rational CFTs, except for one case. We also provide an extensive list of rational CFTs with $1<c<2.1$.

Title: Complexity in multi-qubit and many-body systems
Authors: Imre Varga
Abstract: Characterizing complexity and criticality in quantum systems requires diagnostics that are both computationally tractable and physically insightful. We apply a measure of quantum state complexity for n-qubit systems, defined as the divergence between the Shannon or von Neumann entropy of the computational basis distribution and the second-order Renyi entropy. This quantity has already been used earlier termed as structural entropy and it is particularly powerful as the Renyi entropy is directly related to state purity, linear entropy, and the inverse participation ratio, providing a clear physical grounding. While other Renyi orders could be used, the second order offers a deep and established connection to these key physical quantities. We first validate the measure in canonical noise channels, showing it peaks at the boundary between quantum and classical regimes. We then demonstrate its power in many-body physics. For systems exhibiting a many-body localization transition - including deformed random matrix ensembles and a disordered Heisenberg spin chain - the complexity measure reliably signals the crossover from integrable/localized to quantum-chaotic/ergodic phases. Crucially, the maximum complexity occurs in the non-ergodic yet extended states at the transition, precisely capturing the critical region where the system is neither fully localized nor thermalized. Furthermore, within the chaotic phase, the measure correlates with the survival probability of local excitations, revealing a spectrum of thermalization properties. Our results establish that the entropic complexity is a simple, versatile, and effective probe for identifying nontrivial quantum regimes and transitions giving a new and alternative insight into such systems.

Title: A Generalized Crystalline Equivalence Principle
Authors: Devon Stockall, Matthew Yu
Abstract: We prove a general version of the crystalline equivalence principle which gives an equivalence of categories between a category of TQFTs defined on a generic space with $G$-symmetry, and a category of TQFTs with internal symmetry. We give a definition and classification of anomalies associated to TQFTs in the presence of spatial symmetry, which we then generalize to a definition of an anomaly for a categorical symmetry.

Title: Attaining Quantum Sensing Enhancement from Monitored Dissipative Time Crystals
Authors: Eoin O'Connor, Victor Montenegro, Francesco Albarelli, Matteo G. A. Paris, Abolfazl Bayat, Marco G. Genoni
Abstract: This study investigates quantum-enhanced parameter estimation through continuous monitoring in open quantum systems that exhibit a dissipative time crystal phase. We first analytically derive the global quantum Fisher information (QFI) rate for boundary time crystals (BTCs), demonstrating that within the time-crystal phase, the ultimate precision exhibits a cubic scaling with the system size, $f_{\mathrm{global}}\sim N^3$. We then generalize this finding to a broader class of dynamics, including the transverse collective dephasing (TCD) model, which achieves a time-crystal phase through a closing Liouvillian gap without requiring a dissipative phase transition. We proceed to numerically demonstrate that this maximal global QFI rate is experimentally attainable for both the BTC and TCD models, even at finite system sizes, via continuous homodyne and photodetection. Moving towards practical implementations, we analyze the precision limits under inefficient detection, revealing a critical difference: for BTC dynamics, inefficiencies asymptotically restore a classical scaling, and only a constant-factor quantum advantage remains possible. In contrast, for TCD dynamics, a super-classical scaling is still in principle observable, and our numerical simulations confirm its presence, even under inefficient measurement conditions, establishing the TCD model as a highly robust platform for quantum metrology.

Title: Irreversibility and symmetry breaking in the creation and annihilation of defects in active living matter
Authors: Avraham Beer, Efraim Dov Neimand, Yuv Agarwal, Dom Corbett, Daniel J. G. Pearce, Gil Ariel, Victor Yashunsky
Abstract: Active living matter continuously creates and annihilates topological defects in a process that remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate these dynamics in two distinct active living systems: swarming bacteria and human bronchial epithelial cells. Despite their entirely different evolutionary origins, biological functions, and physical scales, both systems exhibit half-integer defects, consistent with the nematic phase. However, in contrast to active nematic theory, we find that defect creation and annihilation undergoes spatial symmetry breaking. We propose that these results stem from a fundamental dualism between nematic structural organization and generated polar forces, which are intrinsic to living systems. Furthermore, estimation of entropy production reveals that creation and annihilation are not reversed processes. Our findings challenge conventional nematic models and emphasize the role of defect-mediated dynamics in non-equilibrium biological systems as a major source of entropy production.

Title: The Photochemical Birth of the Hydrated Electron in Liquid Water
Authors: Gonzalo Díaz Mirón, Cesare Malosso, Solana Di Pino, Colin K. Egan, Diganta Dasgupta, Christopher J. Mundy, Ali Hassanali
Abstract: The photophysics and photochemistry associated with irradiating UV light in liquid water is central to numerous physical, chemical and biological processes. One of the key events involved in this process is the generation of the hydrated electron. Despite long study from both experimental and theoretical fronts, a unified understanding of the underlying mechanisms associated with the generation of the solvated electron have remained elusive. Here, using excited-state molecular dynamics simulations of condensed phase photoexcited liquid water, we unravel the key sequence of chemical events leading to the creation of the hydrated electron on the excited state. The process begins through the excitation localized mostly on specific topological defects in the hydrogen-bond network of water which is subsequently followed by two main reaction pathways. The first, leads to the creation of a hydrogen atom culminating in non-radiative decay back to the ground-state within 100 femtoseconds. The second involves a proton coupled electron transfer, giving rise to the formation of the hydronium ion, hydroxyl radical and the hydrated excess electron on the excited-state. This process is facilitated by ultrafast coupled rotational and translational motions of water molecules leading to the formation of water mediated ion-radical pairs in the network. These species can survive on the picosecond timescale and ultimately modulate the emission of visible photons. All in all, our findings provide fresh perspectives into the interpretation of several independent time-dependent spectroscopies measured over the last decades, paving the way for new directions on both theoretical and experimental fronts.

Title: TBPLaS 2.0: a Tight-Binding Package for Large-scale Simulation
Authors: Yunhai Li, Zewen Wu, Miao Zhang, Junyi Wang, Shengjun Yuan
Abstract: The common exact diagonalization-based techniques to solving tight-binding models suffer from O(N^2) and O(N^3) scaling with respect to model size in memory and CPU time, hindering their applications in large tight-binding models. On the contrary, the tight-binding propagation method (TBPM) can achieve linear scaling in both memory and CPU time, and is capable of handling large tight-binding models with billions of orbitals. In this paper, we introduce version 2.0 of TBPLaS, a package for large-scale simulation based on TBPM. This new version brings significant improvements with many new features. Existing Python/Cython modeling tools have been thoroughly optimized, and a compatible C++ implementation of the modeling tools is now available, offering efficiency enhancement of several orders. The solvers have been rewritten in C++ from scratch, with the efficiency enhanced by several times or even by an order of magnitude. The workflow of utilizing solvers has also been unified into a more comprehensive and consistent manner. New features include spin texture, Berry curvature and Chern number calculation, partial diagonalization for specific eigenvalues and eigenstates, analytical Hamiltonian, and GPU computing support. The documentation and tutorials have also been updated to the new version. In this paper, we discuss the revisions with respect to version 1.3 and demonstrate the new features. Benchmarks on modeling tools and solvers are also provided.

Title: Self-dual bivariate bicycle codes with transversal Clifford gates
Authors: Zijian Liang, Yu-An Chen
Abstract: Bivariate bicycle codes are promising candidates for high-threshold, low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum memories. Meanwhile, color codes are the most prominent self-dual CSS codes, supporting transversal Clifford gates that have been demonstrated experimentally. In this work, we combine these advantages and introduce a broad family of self-dual bivariate bicycle codes. These codes achieve higher encoding rates than surface and color codes while admitting transversal CNOT, Hadamard, and $S$ gates. In particular, we enumerate weight-8 self-dual bivariate bicycle codes with up to $n \leq 200$ physical qubits, realized on twisted tori that enhance code distance and improve stabilizer locality. Representative examples include codes with parameters $[[n,k,d]]$: $[[16,4,4]]$, $[[40,6,6]]$, $[[56,6,8]]$, $[[64,8,8]]$, $[[120,8,12]]$, $[[152,6,16]]$, and $[[160,8,16]]$.

Title: Subsystem fidelity in two-dimensional conformal field theories
Authors: Bin Sui, Yihao Wang, Jiaju Zhang
Abstract: We investigate the short-interval expansion of the subsystem fidelity in two-dimensional conformal field theories (2D CFTs) using the operator product expansion (OPE) of twist operators. We obtain universal contributions from general quasiprimary operators valid for arbitrary 2D CFTs, along with specific results in free massless boson and fermion theories. The analytical predictions demonstrate excellent agreement with established analytical results in field theories and numerical calculations in integrable models. Furthermore, we extend the method to holographic CFTs, where subsystem fidelity serves to analyze the distinguishability of black hole microstates through the AdS/CFT correspondence. This work establishes a unified framework for quantifying quantum state distinguishability across various 2D CFTs, bridging quantum information techniques with applications in quantum gravity.

Title: Energy Reflection and Transmission of Interfaces in $T\bar{T}$-deformed CFT
Authors: Avik Banerjee, Giuseppe Policastro
Abstract: Conformal interfaces gluing a pair of two-dimensional conformal field theories enjoy a large degree of universality in terms of the coefficients of reflection and transmission of energy, that describe the scattering of conformal matter at the interface. In this article, we study these coefficients beyond conformality, by gluing a pair of $T\bar T$-deformed 2D CFTs across an interface, which requires the condition $c_L \mu_L = c_R \mu_R $ to be obeyed. We show that, at least when the interface admits a holographic description, the $T\bar T$ deformation of the CFTs can be extended to the interface. We propose a generalization of the linear matching condition in the universal sector of the undeformed ICFT to a non-linear one, which is captured by a universal antisymmetric \emph{transmission function} of the incoming fluxes. We employ the flow equations of the $T\bar T$-deformed CFTs to compute this function in two special classes of states, namely the non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) and scattering state. We show that the results can also be reproduced using holographic techniques in the bulk dual of these states.

Title: Asymptotic-freedom and massive glueballs in a qubit-regularized SU(2) gauge theory
Authors: Rui Xian Siew, Shailesh Chandrasekharan, Tanmoy Bhattacharya
Abstract: We argue that a simple qubit-regularized $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ lattice gauge theory on a plaquette chain serves as a pseudo-one-dimensional toy model for Yang-Mills theory in three spatial dimensions. We map the chain Hamiltonian to the Transverse Field Ising Model in a uniform magnetic field and demonstrate that it can be tuned to a continuum limit in which the short-distance physics is governed by the asymptotically free Ising conformal field theory describing free Majorana fermions, while the long-distance regime contains massive excitations of the $E_8$ quantum field theory that can be interpreted as one-dimensional analogues of glueballs. Furthermore, we find $\sqrt{\sigma}/m_1 = 0.249(1)$ where $\sigma$ is the string tension between two static quarks and $m_1$ is the mass of the lightest glueball.

Title: Leveraging Symmetry Merging in Pauli Propagation
Authors: Yanting Teng, Su Yeon Chang, Manuel S. Rudolph, Zoë Holmes
Abstract: We introduce a symmetry-adapted framework for simulating quantum dynamics based on Pauli propagation. When a quantum circuit possesses a symmetry, many Pauli strings evolve redundantly under actions of the symmetry group. We exploit this by merging Pauli strings related through symmetry transformations. This procedure, formalized as the symmetry-merging Pauli propagation algorithm, propagates only a minimal set of orbit representatives. Analytically, we show that symmetry merging reduces space complexity by a factor set by orbit sizes, with explicit gains for translation and permutation symmetries. Numerical benchmarks of all-to-all Heisenberg dynamics confirm improved stability, particularly under truncation and noise. Our results establish a group-theoretic framework for enhancing Pauli propagation, supported by open-source code demonstrating its practical relevance for classical quantum-dynamics simulations.

Title: Symbolic regression for defect interactions in 2D materials
Authors: Mikhail Lazarev, Andrey Ustyuzhanin
Abstract: Machine learning models have become firmly established across all scientific fields. Extracting features from data and making inferences based on them with neural network models often yields high accuracy; however, this approach has several drawbacks. Symbolic regression is a powerful technique for discovering analytical equations that describe data, providing interpretable and generalizable models capable of predicting unseen data. Symbolic regression methods have gained new momentum with the advancement of neural network technologies and offer several advantages, the main one being the interpretability of results. In this work, we examined the application of the deep symbolic regression algorithm SEGVAE to determine the properties of two-dimensional materials with defects. Comparing the results with state-of-the-art graph neural network-based methods shows comparable or, in some cases, even identical outcomes. We also discuss the applicability of this class of methods in natural sciences.

Title: MiST: Understanding the Role of Mid-Stage Scientific Training in Developing Chemical Reasoning Models
Authors: Andres M Bran, Tong Xie, Shai Pranesh, Jeffrey Meng, Xuan Vu Nguyen, Jeremy Goumaz, David Ming Segura, Ruizhi Xu, Dongzhan Zhou, Wenjie Zhang, Bram Hoex, Philippe Schwaller
Abstract: Large Language Models can develop reasoning capabilities through online fine-tuning with rule-based rewards. However, recent studies reveal a critical constraint: reinforcement learning succeeds only when the base model already assigns non-negligible probability to correct answers -- a property we term 'latent solvability'. This work investigates the emergence of chemical reasoning capabilities and what these prerequisites mean for chemistry. We identify two necessary conditions for RL-based chemical reasoning: 1) Symbolic competence, and 2) Latent chemical knowledge. We propose mid-stage scientific training (MiST): a set of mid-stage training techniques to satisfy these, including data-mixing with SMILES/CIF-aware pre-processing, continued pre-training on 2.9B tokens, and supervised fine-tuning on 1B tokens. These steps raise the latent-solvability score on 3B and 7B models by up to 1.8x, and enable RL to lift top-1 accuracy from 10.9 to 63.9% on organic reaction naming, and from 40.6 to 67.4% on inorganic material generation. Similar results are observed for other challenging chemical tasks, while producing interpretable reasoning traces. Our results define clear prerequisites for chemical reasoning training and highlight the broader role of mid-stage training in unlocking reasoning capabilities.

Title: Casimir Arc Plate Geometry: Computational Analysis of Thickness Constraints for Gold and Silver Nanomembranes in MEMS Applications
Authors: Anna-Maria Alexandrova, Jesus Valdiviezo
Abstract: A theoretical analysis of the Casimir interaction between an arc and plate is conducted, which remains unexplored despite its relevance to Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) fabrication. The configuration consists of a rigid finite plate and a flexible curved nanomembrane, with radius 100 micrometers, initially concave toward the rigid plate. The maximum thickness is evaluated for which the nanomembrane undergoes a change in curvature: from concave to convex with respect to the plate, due to the Casimir interaction. The Casimir energy for a curved surface is derived using the Proximity Force Approximation (PFA) with next-to-leading-order (NTLO) corrections. Kirchhoff-Love theory for a thin isotropic plate of constant thickness is used to estimate the bending energy. Material-dependent effects on the Casimir interaction are evaluated by comparing Au and Ag plates. The maximum thickness is derived where U_Casimir > U_bending for distances in the range of 0.1-1 micrometers. Results show curvature reversal occurs for nanomembranes with nanoscale thicknesses at the studied distances. Silver nanomembranes tolerate greater thickness than gold nanomembranes due to material-dependent properties. Comparison between NTLO-corrected PFA and perturbative PFA confirms the accuracy of the NTLO approach. The Casimir arc-to-plate geometry in MEMS enables Casimir-based actuation, enhances devices reliability, and prevents stiction. These findings provide thickness constraints for MEMS design and performance, accounting for the Casimir force.

Title: Finding Graph Isomorphisms in Heated Spaces in Almost No Time
Authors: Sara Najem, Amer E. Mouawad
Abstract: Determining whether two graphs are structurally identical is a fundamental problem with applications spanning mathematics, computer science, chemistry, and network science. Despite decades of study, graph isomorphism remains a challenging algorithmic task, particularly for highly symmetric structures. Here we introduce a new algorithmic approach based on ideas from spectral graph theory and geometry that constructs candidate correspondences between vertices using their curvatures. Any correspondence produced by the algorithm is explicitly verified, ensuring that non-isomorphic graphs are never incorrectly identified as isomorphic. Although the method does not yet guarantee success on all isomorphic inputs, we find that it correctly resolves every instance tested in deterministic polynomial time, including a broad collection of graphs known to be difficult for classical spectral techniques. These results demonstrate that enriched spectral methods can be far more powerful than previously understood, and suggest a promising direction for the practical resolution of the complexity of the graph isomorphism problem.

Title: Exact Multimode Quantization of Superconducting Circuits via Boundary Admittance

Abstract: We show that the Schur complement of the nodal admittance matrix, which reduces a multiport electromagnetic environment to the driving-point admittance $Y_{\mathrm{in}}(s)$ at the Josephson junction, naturally leads to an eigenvalue-dependent boundary condition determining the dressed mode spectrum. This identification provides a four-step quantization procedure: (i) compute or measure $Y_{\mathrm{in}}(s)$, (ii) solve the boundary condition $sY_{\mathrm{in}}(s) + 1/L_J = 0$ for dressed frequencies, (iii) synthesize an equivalent passive network, (iv) quantize with the full cosine nonlinearity retained. Within passive lumped-element circuit theory, we prove that junction participation decays as $O(\omega_n^{-1})$ at high frequencies when the junction port has finite shunt capacitance, ensuring ultraviolet convergence of perturbative sums without imposed cutoffs. The standard circuit QED parameters, coupling strength $g$, anharmonicity $\alpha$, and dispersive shift $\chi$, emerge as controlled limits with explicit validity conditions.
